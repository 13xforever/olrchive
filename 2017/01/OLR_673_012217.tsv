0	18120	This week, the internet speculates that Nintendo copied the copiers by selling ROMs downloaded
18120	20080	from the internet for its Virtual Console games.
20080	22960	But if owning a game means you can download a ROM, doesn't that also extend to the rights
22960	23960	holder?
23960	26680	And that's just one of many stories coming up right now on the show, where every gamer
26680	27680	has a voice.
27680	31600	Orange Lounge Radio
31600	34920	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
34920	36600	where every gamer has a voice.
36600	39000	It is Orange Lounge Radio.
39000	45280	Live tonight, episode number 673 for this January the 22nd of 2017.
45280	50640	My name is Rob Roberts, joining you in lovely Studio N7 in Sacramento, California.
50640	53880	Not joining us tonight unfortunately, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
53880	59000	She has a little bit of a sinus infection type thing and it also is kind of stormy outside,
59000	61640	like thunder, lightning, the whole works.
61640	65320	So she didn't feel up to the trip out here tonight because it does take her a good 20-30
65320	66320	minutes to get over here.
66320	71800	So she will, however, call us later in the show to do her regular segment, the classic
71800	74000	system of the month this week.
74000	76000	So we'll check in with her at that time.
76000	80120	But we do have in studio, as he is every week, say hello to Tech Master Loki.
80360	82360	Now is the classic system of the month...
82360	83360	Oh, you're not...
83360	85800	A classic Loki with no mic on.
85800	87320	Did I not unmute it?
87320	88320	How did I do that?
88320	89320	Try again, Loki.
89320	91000	I did not unmute me.
91000	92640	Live radio, the joys and tribulations.
92640	96960	Anyways, as I was going to say, is the classic system of the week going to be the Nintendo
96960	100040	serial system?
100040	101040	I don't know.
101040	102040	I don't...
102040	106520	I think I'm safe to say it's not tonight because I may be privy to insider information on what
106520	108160	she's picked in advance.
108200	113760	It is not the Nintendo serial system, but she may pick that in a future month.
113760	115360	It is for breakfast now.
115360	116360	It's a serial.
116360	117360	Wow.
117360	118360	How are you, Loki?
118360	119360	I'm fine.
119360	120360	Yeah?
120360	121360	I have a pizza meeting.
121360	122360	Yeah.
122360	123360	And that's always a good thing.
123360	126080	It's funny because Loki brought in a pizza to the studio tonight and I was saying, oh,
126080	129800	Alan and I were actually thinking about ordering pizza because we're kind of lazy right now
129800	130800	tonight.
130800	135520	And you know, it's that whole situation where you're kind of like out of food.
136520	140920	So you're like, I don't really want to go grocery shopping today, especially when it's
140920	141920	stormy.
141920	144160	Can I get through one more night with just a pizza?
144160	145160	All right.
145160	151440	Us here in studio, but you guys, of course, as always, in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com
151440	155760	where we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern,
155760	161320	right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.
161320	164920	Like I said, it is stormy outside tonight, a little bit of rainy.
164920	168560	So if you were going to bootleg the show any week, I would encourage you to do it tonight.
168560	173800	In fact, I think Tiger Claw is on standby just in case we have a power outage or something
173800	174800	like that.
174800	179180	However, Flock O' Jones isn't here, so that should be good as far as the power outage
179180	180180	is concerned.
180180	181180	Yes.
181180	182180	All right.
182180	183180	Anyway.
183180	187440	So there are some folks in chat over at live.vognetwork.com that are talking about something I haven't
187440	191680	talked about on the show tonight and I didn't talk about in the show in advance, but so
191680	196280	y'all may have heard on Twitter and throughout the interwebs this week, I got married on
196280	197280	Thursday.
197280	198280	Yep.
198280	206320	Alan and I made it official and we went down and had a good old courthouse wedding on Thursday.
206320	210400	As some people have phrased it, which I guess we have too, we eloped, although that's a
210400	211400	weird...
211400	217560	Usually when you say you elope, you're eloping because maybe like your parents disapprove
217560	221080	or something like that, or you're trying to get away from something, I don't know, I guess
221120	225680	every situation is different, but elope feels weird to me because the only people that we
225680	228820	actually invited to the ceremony were my parents.
228820	231400	And that was because we had to have a witness of some sort.
231400	234440	So I was like, all right, we're going to invite my parents.
234440	237660	Alan's mother passed away many years ago.
237660	244840	So we had them there, but we didn't tell any friends or any other family.
244840	245840	He didn't tell his brothers.
245840	247160	I didn't tell my sister.
247160	250640	We didn't tell really anybody else until it was done.
251360	255240	I think part of that was because, well, I guess if we eloped from anybody, we eloped
255240	260160	from the government because the whole thing was planned.
260160	263280	You guys know I don't like to get too political on this show and I'm just going to just tell
263280	265600	you the facts and how it is.
265600	269680	We made a decision the day after the election that we would get married the day before the
269680	276880	inauguration as it is our belief and wouldn't it be lovely if we get proved wrong, but it
276880	282400	is our belief that there's some in this incoming administration, especially the vice president,
282400	289380	that would try to take this right away of same sex marriage if they're given the choice.
289380	295720	And also you have to consider that Prop 8 was passed in California and Prop 8 technically
295720	298800	is still the law in California, which sucks.
298800	306000	And I think if that were to go again, I feel like having been doing this show, having talked
306000	310960	to many people out there, having seen people in my own life kind of come full circle in
310960	314280	the past eight years, which we kind of saw with our last president, right?
314280	320440	A lot of the reason why Prop 8 passed in the first place, some claim, is because our last
320440	324760	president, President Barack Obama, was on record on a recording saying, I believe marriage
324760	326440	should be between a man and a woman.
326440	330920	Well, in those eight years, he certainly evolved and I think was probably the best champion
330920	336080	of LGBT plus rights that we've ever had in the Oval Office.
336080	337080	So that part's awesome.
337080	339320	And I think a lot of people kind of came around with him.
339320	344600	So I think if Prop 8 were to happen again, it would be very different, which is great.
344600	347000	That type of aggression is awesome.
347000	351160	But the reality is, if the Supreme Court were to strike it down, Prop 8 is still going to
351160	352160	be the law.
352160	353640	So you know what?
353640	354640	So it's one of those things.
354640	359640	And I realize y'all have your own opinions, I'm sure, although the relationship between
359640	365000	Alan and I is not really your concern at the end of the day.
365000	366240	But we said, you know what?
366240	367240	This is what we want to do.
367240	368360	This is a symbolic thing.
368360	371520	We're going to get married and do it here.
371520	372600	And that's it.
372600	376440	And a lot of people have been asking me in the past couple days, does it feel different
376440	377440	now that you're married?
377440	381480	And my honest answer is, not really.
381480	383880	Alan and I have been living together for the past five years anyway.
383880	387560	So maybe there'll be more of those subtle changes later on, especially when we file
387560	389560	our taxes next year and things like that.
390520	394280	The reason why I say it that way, and I can kind of laugh about it, is because honestly,
394280	400040	this was just a logical next step progression in our relationship that we've both known
400040	401880	has been coming for a very long time.
401880	405720	And so it was one of those things where we're just going to do it right now.
405720	406720	So there it is.
406720	412920	So I'm married to Alan, and that happened just days ago.
412920	418180	Loki, let me ask you, because I get this question a lot.
418180	419780	Did marriage change things for you?
419780	423220	Because you and Nellie were together a while before you guys tied the knot, right?
423220	425940	And what has, have things changed for the two of you?
425940	429300	You just can't leave anymore.
429300	430300	I don't know if that's true.
430300	432300	I don't know if that's true.
432300	433300	All right.
433300	434300	Let's see.
434300	437420	Go into our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
437420	438420	Thank you.
438420	440620	I see a lot of people saying congratulations and I really appreciate that.
440620	441620	Thank you guys so much.
441620	442620	Let's see.
442620	447380	JD says, I call mine an elopement, courthouse wedding, no witnesses, et cetera.
447820	450140	We did have a witness and it was a family member.
450140	451140	So I think, I don't know.
451140	452140	I don't know.
452140	453140	Does that still apply?
453140	454140	I don't know.
454140	456340	I think I'm thinking too much about terms where I don't need to be.
456340	457340	Let's see.
457340	459740	SSG100Matt says, it's too bad you didn't do it earlier.
459740	463140	I think you could have gotten a signed letter from Obama congratulating you.
463140	466980	I didn't, I didn't even know that was a thing you could do.
466980	469900	Well, Obama's just a private citizen now.
469900	472900	Do you think if I sent him a letter and asked very nicely, I could still get something?
472900	473900	Maybe?
473900	475060	I don't know.
475060	477580	It's not really, it's not a high priority for us.
477580	478580	It's fine.
478580	479580	Let's see.
479580	484420	And SSG100Matt says, we may all have differences, but we can all agree that we're all happy
484420	485840	for you and Alan.
485840	490180	That's very sweet of you to say, and that's honestly some of the best wishes I could look
490180	491180	for.
491180	492180	Thank you very much.
492180	493380	I really, really appreciate that.
493380	494660	So there you go.
494660	499180	Yes, I know it's a gaming show you guys, but in a three hour show, sometimes you get the
499180	503340	updates on our personal lives and that was a pretty big one for me.
503340	504460	So there you have it.
504460	507580	And you know, Alan, you guys know him because he pops on the show every now and again.
507580	508580	He might pop on tonight.
508580	509580	We'll see.
509580	514480	But, you know, part of the reason why Alan and I click so well is because he's a big
514480	518680	fucking nerd like I am and he plays a lot of video games, although he's more a computer
518680	519680	gamer guy.
519680	524180	I think in the whole times we've lived together, I don't see him pick up a console game very
524180	528700	often at all unless we're doing like Jackbox Party Pack.
528700	532940	Like I think that's the console game I can sometimes, he'll watch me play.
532940	537700	I was playing World of Final Fantasy in the past week and he'll come in, watch me play
537700	538700	the game.
538700	541780	He'll ask a few questions about it and then he'll kind of make fun of it, which World
541780	545060	of Final Fantasy kind of lends itself very well to be made fun of because there's like
545060	550860	so many anime tropes in that game and it's really like over the top ridiculous in some
550860	551860	parts.
551860	557040	So he'll be like, you know, oh, are you playing Chibi Final Fantasy Desu Desu World of Chibi
557040	558040	Fart?
558040	561860	You know, like just make up something on the spot there.
561900	564980	So we bond a lot over games.
564980	568980	Like a game that Alan plays a lot of, in fact he's probably playing it right now if he's
568980	572340	listening to the show in the other room, I know he was playing it before the show, is
572340	573340	Overwatch.
573340	579700	He plays like, he's level, he just hit I think level 231 or something like that on PC.
579700	582020	And that's a lot of Overwatch time, right?
582020	583820	And I like Overwatch.
583820	587660	I do think Overwatch was like the best video game that was released last year in a lot
587660	594260	of ways, but like I probably wouldn't play Overwatch as much as I do if Alan didn't kind
594260	596140	of like motivate me to do that.
596140	598940	So it's like something we kind of do together.
598940	602940	And as much as it can be frustrating sometimes that we'll get matched with really good players
602940	607580	because of his skill rating as opposed to mine, like I do feel like I've learned a lot
607580	611500	more about the game and I have gotten better playing games with him.
611500	613340	So there's that.
613340	614340	All right.
614340	618700	I'll stop being sweet and over the top and all that stuff.
618700	622700	SCO and Hunter Matt in chat wants to offer different congratulations here.
622700	625100	SCO and Hunter Matt says, congrats Bobby.
625100	627380	His team is going to the Superb Owl.
627380	629100	That's right.
629100	630100	That is absolutely right.
630100	635260	Bobby did not do a live show tonight because you guys all know he does, he has this other
635260	640380	gig that he does that involves a football team in his area and said football team is
640380	641820	now going to be going to the Super Bowl.
641820	645620	So I actually, I have to check my Facebook because I actually asked him, does this mean
645620	648240	you get to play at the Lady Gaga concert in two weeks?
648240	652140	I don't, cause I don't know if they get to go to the Super Bowl or any of that stuff.
652140	653140	So we'll see.
653140	654140	We will find out.
654140	657380	I'm sure he will update you all on his show next week.
657380	658380	Let's see.
658380	662620	SCO and Hunter Matt says, I saw you bought Overwatch on console recently, Rob.
662620	664500	Yes, that is true.
664500	665820	It wasn't actually that recent though.
665820	670140	I bought it during a sale, I think Black Friday or something like that.
670180	673900	Vidpower says, wow, that's two Overwatch prestigious.
673900	674900	Yep.
674900	678540	He plays a lot of Overwatch.
678540	681540	ActDeaf says, drunk BlackWolf to call OLR.
681540	685900	Maybe, I'm sure he's in a very celebratory mood, but I don't think BlackWolf will be
685900	686900	calling tonight.
686900	689240	He's probably really tired from the day.
689240	690700	But you know who is calling in tonight?
690700	692460	We have an interview coming up in about 15 minutes.
692460	697200	We're going to be talking with a buddy of mine that's done, he's done a lot of great
697200	698200	like articles.
698800	703000	It's a neat tie-in tonight, and when he was willing to come on the show tonight, knowing
703000	707080	in the back of my mind that, oh, I'm going to announce a gay wedding on air this week,
707080	710560	I thought, oh, this is going to be the perfect guest for the show this week.
710560	714160	It's my pal Matt, Loki, aren't you excited?
714160	719240	It's my pal Matt, Matt Baum is going to be on the show, and he hosts several podcasts.
719240	726320	He did a lot of writing and YouTubes especially and articles about the marriage debate and
726320	729320	all that when that was going on leading up to the Supreme Court ruling, and he still
729320	732840	does a lot of that stuff, you know, just with those types of issues and what's going on
732840	735000	in the LGBT plus community.
735000	738940	But namely on tonight's show, we're going to talk to him about a project that he's doing
738940	744560	that has a lot to do with video games, and I really like issues like this are really
744560	748700	near and dear to my heart because I see myself in a lot of this, but the project he's going
748700	755300	to talk to us about tonight is called Playing with Pride, and it's about LGBT plus gamers
755300	759500	and a lot of what that community goes through.
759500	765520	And you know, a lot of times, when you see an article or a tweet or something from something
765520	772580	about like gamer X, usually one of the responses in there is, why do we need a gay convention?
772580	775100	When do we get a straight gaming convention?
775100	776100	Where's that?
776100	777900	You know, where's my straight pride parade and all that stuff?
777900	782780	And I think the cool thing about this project is that I think Matt's really trying to show
782780	785900	like, why, and answer that question.
785900	788500	So even though you might be sitting there thinking, well, I'm not gay, am I going to
788500	790380	be interested in this?
790380	793940	I think this is a really good chance for you to see something from the other side.
793940	798320	So anyway, I will stop talking about it and let Matt elaborate on that in about 15 minutes
798320	799780	when he joins us live.
799780	802660	But I do want to get into some gaming news right off the top of the show.
802660	804900	I want to talk about the switch.
804900	809860	And obviously, we had a very passionate, lively discussion about some of the things that are
809860	813740	everything that was announced with the switch last week at the initial press conference
813740	814900	and all that.
814900	819660	But in the last seven days, a lot more has come to light, right?
819660	823540	We've seen there's more games that are getting confirmed for the switch, right, especially
823540	824720	the indie department.
824720	829260	We saw what we saw that screenshot with cave story and 1000 to one spikes, right?
829260	831500	We saw, you know that.
831500	836840	But one thing that caught my eye was that it's also come out from some interviews and
836840	841480	some talking that there's not going to be a lot of media software out on the switch.
841480	844800	And that's a very vague way they say not a lot of media software.
844800	849120	Well, does that mean there's going to be like one software or there's just straight up no
849120	850160	software?
850160	854680	And the impression I'm getting is don't expect Netflix on this thing, right?
854680	857840	That yeah, that's incredibly dumb at this time.
857840	862280	You know, and it's, it's interesting reading like the tweets that I'm getting, and I'm
862280	866480	sure our chat room now and I turn around and look, a lot of the tweets that I'm seeing
866480	872240	out there are about like, you know, well, I don't need Netflix on the switch because
872240	876200	I have 500 other devices that all have Netflix on it.
876200	877560	And I get that.
877560	883520	But at the same time, I can't help but go, well, okay, wait, a couple things.
883520	887580	Hey, Nintendo's trying to make this argument that this is a new home console.
887580	892260	And isn't even though I in my heart of hearts believe this system is five times better when
892260	895680	you view it as a new handheld console that just happens to get more powerful when you're
895680	898640	at home, but I digress.
898640	905720	Isn't it kind of standard for home consoles to be living room central hubs that have things
905720	907840	like Netflix in them?
907840	912200	True, but you have to look at it the other way that it's not Nintendo not putting it
912200	913200	on their console.
913200	917360	It's Netflix not developing for that console.
917360	920600	So why aren't they doing it?
920600	921600	That's a good question.
921600	926080	Is it because they feel that, you know, it's obviously powerful enough to run it because,
926080	931540	you know, hell, a stupid tablet can run that.
931540	934440	Could be that they just didn't give the dev kids out to them in time.
934440	935920	It could be like a whole bunch of stuff.
935920	943440	I just think the more I hear about their system, the less like I have a preorder.
943440	946360	I'm probably not going to have a preorder by the time it comes out.
946360	948500	It's still in my possession right now.
948500	953980	But there's not, it's hardly anything convincing me to buy one right now.
953980	956460	Don't cancel it until you're sure, because it'll be hard to get it back once you do.
956460	957460	I don't care, honestly.
957460	958460	I'm just saying.
958460	963680	I mean, there's one game that's coming out, Zelda, which I can get on the Wii U anyways,
963680	967580	which by the way, they talked about what the differences are between the two systems.
967580	970820	It's like not really anything.
970820	972700	I mean, so why?
972700	976740	Going back to Netflix for a minute, here's the thing for me, because even though as much
976740	982180	as I try to look at both sides of everything that's going on in gaming, I try to be fair,
982180	986660	and I think I've given Nintendo a pretty fair shot on this show, and I have not canceled
986660	988260	either of my preorders yet.
988260	990620	Yes, I still have two.
990620	996580	But I do think this whole no Netflix thing is, I don't like it.
996580	1000500	And I know a lot of you disagree with me, and that's fine, but it just seems like a
1000500	1002580	real missed opportunity.
1002580	1007260	That's what kind of worries me about it, is that it's a real missed opportunity for Nintendo,
1007260	1011620	especially on a thing like the Switch, where it's like, okay, let's say you're watching
1011620	1016380	Netflix on the TV or something, and then, oh, somebody wants to come in and take over
1016380	1022180	the TV for something else, like news or whatever's going on, then snap, you can take that Switch
1022180	1026700	out and continue to watch yourself on the couch with some headphones.
1026700	1028580	Didn't they show that for the Wii U?
1028580	1031700	I could swear when they were plugging the Wii U, they showed that, right?
1031820	1036820	Yes, it was the whole TV thing where you could, you know, you could take that and, you know,
1036820	1041020	someone could watch TV on there, and you can watch your whatever.
1041020	1043660	So that's what's bothering me about it, you guys.
1043660	1046740	That's what's bothering me about it, is that it feels like it's a feature that was on the
1046740	1050180	Wii U that's removed on the Switch.
1050180	1051180	That's where it's weird.
1051180	1058180	And on top of that, like, YouTube, like, hell, my son uses the Wii U tablet for Minecraft,
1058180	1059180	and mainly YouTube.
1059460	1063260	And you've talked about, too, for even yourself, as much as, you know, you give Nintendo shit
1063260	1067620	on the show sometimes, you love this thing for when your wife wants to commandeer the
1067620	1073220	TV for Grey's Anatomy, you will use the Wii U gamepad to do stuff, right?
1073220	1078940	Not so much anymore, now that I have the PlayStation VR, because I'll just play PlayStation 4 games
1078940	1079940	on that.
1079940	1080940	Okay, but you have.
1080940	1084940	But if I had a tablet for the PlayStation, yeah, I'd be down with that, but I mean, at
1084940	1088700	one time, yeah, I was, when I was playing more, like, Wii U games, and hell, when Zelda
1088740	1094500	comes out, that might be the case, but yeah, it's nice to be able to do that.
1094500	1099980	It's just, I don't think, their whole, like, online portion doesn't seem fleshed out at
1099980	1100980	all.
1100980	1103740	That's why it's not coming out right away, because it's not ready yet.
1103740	1108060	There's nothing, they have no details on anything, they don't know how much it's going to cost,
1108060	1111020	they don't know what features are going to be in it.
1111020	1114900	That's not good for a console that's coming out in less than six weeks.
1114900	1118140	You don't have any idea what your online infrastructure is going to be?
1118140	1119140	Come on!
1119140	1122740	And I do want to give credit to these comments in chat right now.
1122740	1127060	ActDeft over at live.vognetwork.com says, Netflix will be on the Switch, just give it
1127060	1128060	time.
1128060	1131220	VidPower says, Nintendo said it won't be available on launch, which means it may come
1131220	1132220	in the future.
1132220	1136700	And those are both valid and good points, but it still can't help you but feel like,
1136700	1141520	wow, it feels like what we're getting in March is the beta release, and everything is going
1141520	1145740	to be building up for holiday, which is when the console is really going to launch.
1145740	1150380	And for all practical purposes, that may be exactly Nintendo's plan.
1150380	1151380	And I think it is Nintendo's plan.
1151380	1154620	I think they're going to get another, it's going to pull another 3DS is what's going
1154620	1155620	to happen with this system.
1155620	1160820	They're going to launch it unprepared, it's not going to do great, it'll do fine because
1160820	1164420	they've sold out of pre-orders, but it's not going to, you know, they're not going to sell
1164420	1168240	a ton beyond that because there's not a lot of software out there.
1168240	1172940	And how long, I mean, can Zelda really sustain your console?
1172940	1176140	I mean, look at all the games coming out for that.
1176140	1179060	So the other thing is kind of like, I sit back and I'm like, you know, all these games
1179060	1182860	are coming out for all of these are ports of really old games.
1182860	1187340	Like Mario Kart 8 is a great game, but once again, it's just being re-released with just
1187340	1193180	a fraction of a bit extra content that honestly should have been there in the first place.
1193180	1197140	Here's the thing, the Mario Kart 8 thing where you and I totally differ on this is that I'm
1197140	1201780	looking ahead to the next nerd convention when everybody brings their Switch and we're
1201780	1207100	all going to be sitting around playing Mario Kart 8 on our individual TV screens, kind
1207100	1210780	of doing something in the same room that, like, it's an experience you can't really
1210780	1212220	get on Wii U right now.
1212220	1213220	You know what I mean?
1213220	1216620	Like, that's what I'm really looking forward to in Mario Kart 8, for me personally.
1216620	1219580	And I think Splatoon is going to be a lot of the same thing as well.
1219580	1224180	And that could bode very well for other future Nintendo games because obviously Nintendo's
1224180	1225700	the party system, right?
1225700	1228860	Mario Party on the Switch is going to be lit.
1228860	1230020	But that's the problem though.
1230020	1231020	That's the problem.
1231260	1237140	That's the party system and that's, I don't party with people with my, you know, Wii or
1237140	1238140	Wii U or whatever.
1238140	1240260	Why don't you want to party, Loki?
1240260	1241860	Come on, Loki, let's party.
1241860	1244340	That's just making quite the assumption.
1244340	1251060	But still, even on top of that though, you're basically putting out, like, the game that
1251060	1255100	was out just recently for that $60 price point still.
1255100	1256660	And what am I really in with that?
1256660	1258660	Oh, the additional tracks?
1258660	1259660	Big deal.
1259660	1263420	And why don't you just patch that shit into the Wii U version?
1263420	1268420	Oh, I'm sorry, the Wii U can't handle traditional battle mode in fucking Mario Kart 8?
1268420	1269660	That's ridiculous.
1269660	1273740	Only about 10% of our audience, give or take, is going to understand this joke, but I just
1273740	1278900	think that Nintendo is really on a missed opportunity here to market the Switch as the
1278900	1280860	official party and play system.
1280860	1283260	And they're just not doing it.
1283260	1284260	Well, who knows?
1284260	1285820	Again, maybe for the holiday.
1286420	1291740	Maybe the whole thing is, get the early adopters in March so we have some good figures to push
1291740	1297980	out for our financials so we don't lose further stock faith or whatever, and then really we're
1297980	1301740	going to push this during the holiday with a bundle with 1-2 Switch because that game
1301740	1303060	ain't going to sell on its own.
1303060	1306740	Yeah, I don't think the third party support's there though.
1306740	1308900	We've been seeing stuff, but what's EA got?
1308900	1310420	EA's got FIFA.
1310420	1314780	There's no Madden on there, which is a big deal.
1314780	1315780	There's no-
1315780	1318220	But FIFA's there though, which is bigger than Madden.
1318220	1320700	Yeah, but you know why FIFA's there?
1320700	1325980	Because not until up to a couple years ago did they still stop- they basically are still
1325980	1335340	producing the PlayStation 2 and the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 versions of those games because
1335340	1342140	other parts of the world don't have a lot of market saturation for the newer consoles.
1342140	1343660	That's not true for Madden.
1343660	1346300	That's not true for NHL.
1346300	1353900	That is true still for NBA 2K I believe, but it's just- and even with that though, those
1353900	1359780	engines are still running on versions of the game that were several years old.
1359780	1363780	Pro Evo was doing that for a while with Konami, and all they were doing was roster updates,
1363780	1366380	running on the same engine as late from 2012.
1366380	1375140	So the thing is, they're providing support for the system, but very shitty-ass support
1375140	1376140	for it.
1376140	1379900	And even Ubisoft, what are they really bringing to the system?
1379900	1382460	Shit that came out already, they're just porting over to it.
1382460	1383540	Like Rayman?
1383540	1387140	They're not developing a new Rayman game, it's just a fucking game that came out- what,
1387140	1388140	the Wii U launch?
1388140	1393300	I mean, come on, this is piss poor support from third parties.
1393300	1396900	The ports of years old games is concerning.
1396900	1402020	I think indies can get away with it a little more than some of the big boys, but you guys
1402020	1407180	know how I felt about the Skyrim thing, but to be fair, there are others who strongly
1407180	1411100	feel that Skyrim being a portable presence is going to be a huge asset.
1411100	1415220	But I want to see how that thing runs, because the thing I'm worried about is, first off,
1415220	1418460	it's not going to be the new- I don't think it's going to be the remastered Skyrim.
1418460	1423020	I think it could be just a port of the Xbox 360 PlayStation 3 version.
1423020	1427980	I mean, which would be okay, I guess, but there's just- at this point, I mean, that
1427980	1433540	sounds cool, but I even thought about it, like, why would I drop $400 for the system
1433540	1440140	in the game when I could just upgrade or buy a new laptop that can run Skyrim on the go
1440140	1441140	anyways?
1441140	1445780	And that's kind of what I'd be doing, because wherever I go, I bring my laptop, and if I'm
1445780	1450180	going to be playing games on the Switch, it's going to be at my desk at work, and I could
1450180	1456220	just easily pop out a laptop and play with an Xbox 360 controller, so why should I drop
1456220	1457300	it for that?
1457300	1463300	I mean, the Mario game looks alright, but I didn't buy the Mario game on the Wii U.
1463300	1465180	Let me go to chat for some more chat comments.
1465180	1470120	Barb over in chat, my favorite character in Stranger Things, says, everyone single take
1470120	1473220	a shot every time Rob makes a sex reference.
1473220	1475420	I hope you all aren't driving anywhere tonight.
1475420	1479540	Let's see, Dungeon Buster says, the lack of games I'm interested in is concerning.
1479580	1483820	I have a feeling that after Breath of the Wild, the Switch will just sit there while
1483820	1487860	Steam and PS4 fill the gaps for, well, everything else.
1487860	1489820	I disagree-ish.
1489820	1491220	I kind of get the concern there.
1491220	1495420	I definitely think Nintendo is trying to do this whole initial launch, and then you will
1495420	1498220	definitely see something for Holiday and Mario and all that.
1498220	1502780	But I do feel like, unlike the Wii U, they are trying to do at least something every
1502780	1505140	month to kind of keep it going.
1505140	1507180	April is Mario Kart, right?
1507180	1509020	Arms will probably be May.
1509020	1513540	Splatoon 2 is going to be June, and I honestly don't know what's beyond that.
1513540	1517220	Maybe June is E3 and we can get more announcements and so forth, but I do feel like they're trying
1517220	1521780	to pepper out some of these other releases to kind of sustain the year, if that makes
1521780	1522780	sense.
1522780	1526180	This is one little difference I see there than what we saw at Wii U, but this is a different
1526180	1527220	type of launch, too.
1527220	1529100	It's going to be launching in March, not November.
1529100	1530740	Still, that's just like the Wii U.
1530740	1533220	That's exactly like the Wii U.
1533220	1538980	Lack of third-party support, one major title coming out from Nintendo every month or so
1539980	1546060	and that's fine that Nintendo puts out decent games, but is first-party going to be enough
1546060	1548420	to drive people wanting this system?
1548420	1554780	And I, you know, I was on board with the Wii, I bought a ton of stuff for it, you know,
1554780	1556640	I played it for a while and then I didn't.
1556640	1560540	I didn't play it for a while because, you know, most of the stuff that came out later
1560540	1564940	on was multi-platform stuff and it's like, well shit, it's just way better on other systems.
1564940	1569460	The Wii U, you know, I bought a lot of stuff digital because, you know, mainly because
1569460	1570460	my son wanted to play stuff.
1570460	1576540	I bought Splatoon, never got into it, so Splatoon 2, I don't give a shit about that.
1576540	1579460	Mario Maker's pretty fun, but that's not on the new system.
1579460	1580460	Yet.
1580460	1581460	Yet.
1581460	1585020	Well, goodie, I'm not going to wait until 2018 to play a game that I have right now.
1585020	1587700	Let me get a couple more comments here because I want to make sure we get to our interview.
1587700	1591780	RPGfan says, I hear you, Loki, I'm a single player, Nintendo doesn't have much for me
1591780	1594860	beyond Zelda these days.
1595780	1597780	What about Xenoblade?
1597780	1599340	I never got into Xenoblade.
1599340	1601140	I think it's kind of cool.
1601140	1605040	Let's see, what was the other thing I wanted to say about the whole, I don't remember the
1605040	1607740	comment that put this out here.
1607740	1611260	I think maybe it was Darth Tetsuya saying, is Netflix, Hulu really that much of a deal
1611260	1612260	breaker?
1612260	1616660	Here's the last thing I want to say on Netflix that's weird to me, okay, is that Netflix
1616660	1620340	recently introduced this thing where you can actually download movies and watch them on
1620340	1621340	the go.
1621340	1624500	I think somebody in chat was saying something about, does anybody watch Netflix on portable
1624540	1625540	devices?
1625540	1631780	Yes, when I was flying to and from MAGFest, since DC is a long flight, I was watching
1631780	1633420	Netflix on my phone.
1633420	1638060	I downloaded a movie called Hurricane Bianca, which if you all watch Drag Race, you know
1638060	1639300	what that is.
1639300	1642980	I downloaded that movie and I was able to actually watch it on the flight.
1642980	1646580	That's something kind of new for Netflix that the Switch could really benefit from, is that
1646580	1651340	okay, so obviously this handheld Switch thing doesn't have a cell signal so you're not going
1651340	1658620	to be able to use Netflix unless you're on Wi-Fi, but you could download movies and then
1658620	1663020	when you start them, or like you start them on the TV and it's downloading to the Switch,
1663020	1665860	so that way if you have to pick up the Switch and go somewhere, the rest of the movie is
1665860	1666860	there.
1666860	1670660	And yes, I know there's probably a lot of concerns with the whole internal storage,
1670660	1672140	but those movies are not that big.
1672140	1678380	I think that whole Hurricane Bianca was like maybe 350 megs, which isn't a lot, and we
1678380	1680060	know the Switch is expandable, yada yada yada.
1680100	1687340	And it's only 720p, so I mean it's not like you're downloading a much larger video file.
1687340	1691620	It's not that like, what I want to say is it's not that it's a deal breaker that Netflix
1691620	1696380	isn't on the system, it's that this isn't something that they wanted, that they didn't
1696380	1702240	think of it seemed like, that it's still very much to me where they're like, oh well stay
1702240	1706500	tuned for more information about our networks, you know, our online system.
1706500	1712580	It's like, this system comes out next month, you know, it's like what the fuck, or just
1712580	1713580	a month away.
1713580	1716940	I mean like, what more time am I gonna give you?
1716940	1720700	My thought was they're trying to pepper the information the same way they're peppering
1720700	1724000	the games to keep the Switch in the gaming press.
1724000	1725200	It's not helping.
1725200	1727140	It's all negative information that's coming out.
1727140	1728500	All right, all right.
1728500	1733100	We gotta move on here because we're gonna be welcoming to the show right now a very
1733100	1734700	special guest.
1734700	1739740	And I want to get our pal Matt Baum on the line who's gonna talk to us about a project
1739740	1743840	that he's working with called Playing with Pride and I think we have him on the line
1743840	1744840	right now.
1744840	1745840	Hi Matt, are you there?
1745840	1746840	Yes, I'm here.
1746840	1747840	Thanks for having me.
1747840	1748840	Thanks for being on the show.
1748840	1749840	Matt, how you doing?
1749840	1750840	I'm doing great.
1750840	1751840	How are you guys?
1751840	1752840	Good.
1752840	1753840	Did you pre-order a Switch?
1753840	1754840	Are you a Nintendo fan?
1754840	1755840	Are you into that?
1755840	1756840	Yes, yes.
1756840	1759260	So our household is very Nintendo friendly.
1759260	1763700	So my partner ordered a Switch like the day of the announcement.
1763700	1766740	And if you didn't do it the day of the announcement, you're probably not getting one right away.
1766740	1767740	Yeah, yeah.
1767740	1768740	So I'm excited.
1768740	1769740	I'm looking forward to it.
1769740	1775580	I know there's a lot of debate about the features and the power and the strange amount of storage
1775580	1776860	space and all that stuff.
1776860	1779700	But I'm just excited to play Breath of the Wild.
1779700	1782100	I'm excited for more Mario Kart.
1782100	1786260	I am curious about taking the device with me.
1786260	1788260	So yeah, I'm all for it.
1788260	1792140	I seriously think all this debate on the show, which we've done every week for the past 15
1792140	1796180	years aside, I kind of think by holiday, everything's going to be fine.
1796180	1797900	That's kind of where I'm at with it.
1797900	1798900	But anyway.
1798900	1801580	I'd like to believe that about everything in the world.
1801580	1802580	Let's hope.
1802580	1803580	Let's hope.
1803580	1807140	So anyway, we could talk about the Switch with you all night, but I want to talk about
1807140	1808540	this project that you're working on.
1808540	1810540	It's called Playing with Pride.
1810540	1812980	Tell us a little bit about this project that you're working on.
1812980	1813980	Yeah.
1813980	1817660	So in a nutshell, it's about how people's lives are transformed when gay culture and
1817660	1820580	game culture collide together.
1820580	1824620	And so the way it started is we set out to answer that question that you mentioned at
1824620	1830740	the top of the show about why gay game events or LGBT game events are important to people.
1830740	1833360	This started a couple of years ago when GamerX was getting going.
1833360	1836580	That's the game convention with the LGBT focus.
1836580	1842900	And we heard that conversation online, the questions online, oh, why do we need this?
1842900	1844100	Why do we have a gay game convention?
1844100	1846180	What does sexuality have to do with gaming?
1846180	1847860	So we're like, oh, those are good questions.
1847860	1848860	Let's find out.
1849220	1853220	We did a big road trip around the country and we interviewed people in their homes about
1853220	1856100	why they were going to GamerX.
1856100	1861200	And what we started to hear were really intense personal stories about how games help people
1861200	1866540	come out or meet their partners or find their tribe, reconcile with their family.
1866540	1870820	And so we're like, oh, there's something really important going on here.
1870820	1875260	And so what the project has turned into, we did these video interviews and we presented
1875260	1877020	some highlights at various conventions.
1877020	1880820	We showed them at PAX and GamerX and HavenCon.
1880820	1884980	We did a live stream that people can see if they go to playingwithpride.com.
1884980	1889820	You can watch a live stream that we did of some of the highlights where I talk and then
1889820	1894460	James talks and then we show some footage and go back and forth and we talk to the audience.
1894460	1897180	You can also sign up for the mailing list there at Playing with Pride for more announcements
1897180	1898760	about it.
1898760	1902420	And so now we're trying to figure out because we've got over a hundred interviews.
1902420	1905660	We've got hundreds of hours of stories.
1905660	1908880	How exactly do we want to present this to people?
1908880	1912500	And so that's one other step that we're at right now is just showing people the live
1912500	1916060	stream that we've got at playingwithpride.com and then there's a little feedback form where
1916060	1919340	people can say, oh, this is what I like, this is what I don't like, this is what I want
1919340	1920340	to see more of.
1920340	1924020	Because we've got people from all different backgrounds and all different walks of life
1924020	1927060	and all different parts of the country just sharing these stories about how games have
1927060	1929380	changed their lives.
1929380	1934300	And just a little bit of a personal testimony on this stuff as well for what I've watched
1934300	1939160	from the live stream with the interviews, I really wish I could see one of the panels
1939160	1940160	that you did.
1940160	1941160	I'd love to see that.
1941160	1943180	But I did watch the live stream bit that you did.
1943180	1948460	And just from a personal perspective, I can say being a gay guy who was really into video
1948460	1952700	games, I definitely felt like you were the outcast of two different camps.
1952700	1958740	It's like you were not pop culture savvy enough, even though I'm very pop culture savvy, but
1958740	1962740	you weren't really cool enough or whatever for the gay guys because you were a bit of
1962740	1963820	a nerd.
1963820	1967060	And then you were too gay for the nerds at some point.
1967060	1968980	So you feel like that double outcast.
1968980	1975300	So just personally to hear these other people that are saying the exact same thing is actually
1975300	1977740	really comforting for me in a way.
1977740	1980620	Yeah, it's something that we heard from a lot of people.
1980620	1983700	That feeling of, well, I don't belong with this tribe and I don't belong with this tribe
1983700	1985700	and who do I belong with?
1985700	1991380	And these are actually two groups, LGBTs and gamers are two groups that have a lot in common,
1991380	1993020	even though they don't always see eye to eye.
1993780	1998060	I think the folks in both groups have a lot to gain from playing together.
1998060	1999500	That's a really good point.
1999500	2004380	I hope a lot of people caught there is that gamers are often on the outs with the rest
2004380	2005940	of society as well.
2005940	2008220	And LGBT gets that as well.
2008220	2012940	And we could probably do more working together than shouting at each other.
2012940	2014740	Yeah, yeah, I hope so.
2014740	2018820	Because one of the things that we heard from people, we spoke to a lot of developers.
2018820	2022180	For example, we talked to people at BioWare about the creation of the character Krem
2022180	2030780	and the Iron Bull, about what happens when people are working together to make a game
2030780	2032820	more fun for everyone.
2032820	2035740	I think Krem is a really good example of that.
2035740	2040460	We spoke to, it's actually kind of amazing how this happened, because we spoke to this
2040460	2044460	one person in Vancouver about his experiences with gaming.
2044460	2049860	And he shared stories about how when he was young, he had a bootleg version of Pokemon.
2049860	2051580	I can't remember which Pokemon it was.
2051580	2053860	He had a bootleg version of one of the Pokemons.
2053860	2068740	And the save got corrupted, and the gender of the character that he was playing flipped.
2068740	2072940	And he realized, oh, this is something that matters to me, and I don't quite know why.
2072940	2076780	So we talked to him and interviewed him, and we put him in our presentation.
2076780	2080420	And so when we presented at PAX, he came to the presentation to see it.
2080420	2081420	His name is Justin Sane.
2081420	2086940	He's a great cosplayer and drag queen and community leader up in Vancouver.
2086940	2092060	And something else that we had in the presentation was Karen Weeks from BioWare talking about
2092060	2097140	the character Krem, about how that character came about, because at a feedback event that
2097140	2100460	BioWare had, they were asking people for their thoughts on the games.
2100460	2104460	And somebody came up and said about trans characters, I just want to see somebody in
2104460	2107900	the game who looks like me and isn't a monster.
2107900	2110940	And she said, well, after that, we all sat down together and we were like, we can do
2110940	2111940	this.
2111940	2113460	We can actually make this happen.
2113460	2117220	And so Justin Sane happened to be at this presentation, and afterwards he came up and
2117220	2122700	he was like, I think that person who said that was me.
2122700	2126260	I think I was the one who asked for a trans character.
2126260	2129020	And as it turns out, it was true.
2129020	2134200	And we went back and got Karen and a bunch of other BioWare folks together with Justin.
2134200	2139300	We sat them all down to talk about how he came to this event, wanted to see better trans
2139300	2142540	representation, more gender fluid representation in games.
2142540	2146580	They realized, oh, we can put people in games that we haven't, we've underserved in the
2146580	2147580	past.
2147580	2151220	And it was a great example of this virtuous cycle that happens when queer people find
2151220	2153820	their voice, find their community, and speak out.
2153820	2157420	Game developers can hear them, and it changes the way that they make games.
2157420	2161300	They make the games more inclusive so more people can enjoy them, and in turn that has
2161300	2165700	a positive effect on communities, and communities see that they're welcome in gaming, and everybody
2165700	2167140	can have a better time.
2167140	2172780	That's an outstanding story to hear, kind of like that direct influence with game makers.
2172780	2177340	But now you keep saying we, this project is not just you, your partner is involved, right?
2177340	2180060	Your partner actually worked in the game industry for a while, right?
2180060	2181060	Yeah, that's true.
2181060	2183920	James is a veteran of the game industry.
2183920	2185180	We are collaborating on this.
2185180	2186180	So he worked at LucasArts.
2186180	2187180	He worked at Capcom.
2187180	2189380	He worked at LeapFrog and some other places.
2189380	2191560	And so we're working together on this project.
2191560	2197300	He has just an encyclopedic knowledge of games, and I've absorbed as much as I can from him
2197300	2200820	through osmosis, and he's got this great knack for putting a game in front of me and saying,
2200820	2203740	I think you'll like this, and he's always right.
2203740	2208500	So it's thanks to him, because I was kind of a gamer as a kid, and then it kind of fell
2208500	2210900	away in high school and college.
2210900	2218520	And then once James and I started dating, oh gosh, many years ago, he brought me back
2218520	2219520	into the fold, essentially.
2219520	2223820	He was like, you'll like this game, and you should give this one a shot.
2223820	2224820	So it's been great.
2224820	2232140	I really enjoyed working with my partner as a partner, in all senses of the word.
2232140	2233140	That's a great story.
2233140	2234140	I love that.
2234140	2237260	And you guys didn't like, you didn't kickstart this or anything like that.
2237260	2242700	You guys took this trip you wanted to do and kind of turned it into this project, right?
2242700	2243700	Exactly.
2243700	2244700	Yeah.
2244700	2245700	There may be a kickstart in the future.
2245700	2246700	We haven't decided yet.
2246700	2250420	We haven't had a need for it yet, but we may in the future.
2250420	2251420	We'll see.
2251420	2253980	That's something that we're asking people for feedback on, like how they want to see
2253980	2256120	this project progress.
2256120	2259340	So based on their feedback, we'll decide what form it's going to take.
2259340	2265440	Well, the reality is, just to say the reality is if people want a movie, those cost money
2265440	2270360	to put on Blu-ray, so there's probably going to be a need for money there, for sure.
2270360	2271360	Yes.
2271360	2272360	Yes.
2272360	2273360	So we've done all the traveling.
2273360	2275080	So far we've done out of pocket.
2275080	2277820	And it's, you know, had a blast driving around the country.
2277820	2281880	We drove from L.A. up to Vancouver and then across the country, top of the country to
2281880	2285200	Chicago and New York and into Maine, then back through Denver.
2285200	2291880	We made a pit stop in Austin for HavenCon.
2291880	2297220	And I'm going to be in Orlando later this, in March, and so I'm hoping to do some interviews
2297220	2298220	in Orlando.
2298220	2302800	And we're also looking at Europe to talk to some people in Europe at some point in 2017.
2302800	2304520	So that's going to be a bit more of an expense.
2304520	2306800	So we're figuring that out now.
2306800	2310240	Although you have interviewed some people from overseas in this, right?
2310240	2314460	Because didn't I spot Laura, I'm going to mess up her name, but the Eurogamer writer
2314460	2316480	Laura Kate Dale is in this, right?
2316480	2319260	Yeah, from Let's Play Video Games.
2319260	2324260	We were lucky enough to catch her at GamerX in San Jose, or maybe it was Santa Clara,
2324260	2325740	but in California.
2325740	2329740	So we caught her there and we talked to Jim Sterling who, well, he lives in Mississippi,
2329740	2332940	but originally from the UK.
2332940	2337060	So yeah, we have spoken to a couple people internationally, but we want to get more people
2337060	2341660	particularly from the South, particularly from rural areas, and particularly from countries
2341660	2347620	that want it to just be the U.S. experience because we'll play games everywhere.
2347620	2348700	Well Jamie's going to be bummed.
2348700	2349700	She missed tonight's show.
2349700	2350700	She's from the South.
2350700	2351700	Maybe she's out there listening.
2351700	2356380	Anyway, how has the response been at some of these conventions that you've taken this
2356380	2357380	to?
2357380	2361080	Because you mentioned you have shown this at, or your work in progress, I should say,
2361080	2362080	at GamerX.
2362080	2363780	You've taken it to PAX.
2363780	2365880	How has the response been?
2365880	2366980	Really strong.
2366980	2368900	We've had a great reaction from folks.
2368900	2370620	People are really interested.
2370620	2374220	One of the things that we're hearing a lot is, how can I see more?
2374660	2381020	We literally have 100 and something hours of people just telling stories.
2381020	2386140	We've got people talking about, for example, one of my favorite stories is these two guys
2386140	2390820	in D.C. that throw house parties, these gamer house parties where they just throw open the
2390820	2396660	doors and bring people in, so they've got zones of like, oh, the DDR is up there and
2396660	2401460	Settlers of Catan is down in the basement and we've got Mass Effect going over here
2401460	2405740	and we've got Puerto Rico going over here.
2405740	2412180	These great games about people building up community and forming essentially chosen families,
2412180	2416340	which is something that I think is familiar to a lot of queer people.
2416340	2422620	Can I just say that the house party and doing the gaming at the house party, that is actually
2422620	2428620	how about, gosh, it probably would have been 13 years ago or so, that is how I met Captain
2428660	2434260	Spike from GameBooey.org and started a lifelong friendship and obviously they're on the network
2434260	2439700	here as well at VoG and just, you all know Spike and his immense knowledge of video games
2439700	2440700	and all that stuff.
2440700	2446020	We met and connected and started a friendship because of one of those types of house parties.
2446020	2447500	It's such a big deal.
2447500	2451860	Those gamer get-togethers and the forming of community, it's so important to people,
2451860	2454260	whether it's in real life or online.
2454260	2459180	We talked to a woman in Las Vegas who, she's a mom, she's raising a kid and her son came
2459180	2463180	to her, I think he was early teens, and was like, oh, I want to play World of Warcraft
2463180	2466980	and she was monitoring his games at the time and she's like, I don't really know what that
2466980	2469480	is so I should check it out, make sure it's appropriate.
2469480	2473940	She downloads a free trial and then within a couple of months, the whole family, they
2473940	2479820	all have gaming laptops and they are going on raids together as a family and she joined
2479820	2484640	an LGBT-friendly guild, the Spectrum Guild, and it turned into this big family for her
2484640	2489340	where now everywhere she can go all over the country and visit people from the guild.
2489340	2493860	It's so important, those communities that form, because for a lot of folks, they do
2493860	2501060	feel that they don't belong, that there's something that sets them apart and games have
2501060	2506020	a really great way, nothing does this like games of bringing people together.
2506020	2511540	It's interesting you bring up MMOs and especially Warcraft and I noticed when I was watching
2511540	2517080	the footage that you had at playingwithpride.com that Warcraft was a theme that kept coming
2517080	2520980	up and even for me, that's been a thing because I just mentioned at the top of the show, Alan
2520980	2533940	and I got married after seven years together, but when we were first together, I lived here
2533940	2536780	in Sacramento, which is a good 100 miles apart.
2536780	2539820	We couldn't just drive up on a weeknight and see each other.
2539820	2544020	One of the ways that we would hang out, I'm using my quotey fingers, was through something
2544020	2545020	like Warcraft.
2545020	2551940	Warcraft allowed us to be together even though we weren't, that makes sense.
2551940	2552940	That's something that we've heard.
2552940	2557500	Warcraft has come up again and again and again.
2557500	2561180	It's tough because we don't want to make it like Warcraft the documentary, but it kind
2561180	2564540	of works out, it's like Warcraft and Bioware.
2564540	2568900	We talked to this one person in, where was it?
2568900	2571500	Just outside San Francisco, who was in the army.
2571500	2574800	He was in the army and closeted and there was no one he could tell because it was during
2574800	2580220	Don't Ask, Don't Tell and he was introduced to Warcraft as a way to just kind of get some
2580220	2585580	alone time from everyone he was stationed with and he realized he was playing as female
2585580	2589480	characters and it was something they wanted to explore more of and then he started coming
2589480	2594440	out to Don't Ask, Don't Tell went away.
2594440	2599480	He was comfortable coming out to his friends and he went into the army because he was like,
2599480	2601840	I need to be more masculine, I need to be more manly.
2601840	2605640	And Warcraft gave him permission to play as female characters and dress up and be girly
2605640	2611960	and now the latest thing that he's done, we interviewed him just after the holidays, he
2611960	2616800	went to his army, I think it was his battalion or just the group of people he serves with,
2616800	2621240	he went to the holiday party in drag, in this big princess dress and it was a huge
2621240	2622240	hit.
2622240	2624240	Everybody loved it.
2624240	2631040	It's amazing because Warcraft made him comfortable exploring his more feminine side and not feeling
2631040	2634560	this pressure that he'd been putting on himself the whole time, oh I got to be more of a man,
2634560	2636080	I got to be more stereotypically manly.
2636080	2639200	No, you don't, you don't and games are a great way to experiment with that.
2639200	2644440	If you guys have questions, of course for Matt, our chat room is open over at live.vognetwork.com.
2644440	2647480	Y'all are being quiet in there right now, but I'm assuming you're just listening intently.
2647480	2651800	But if you do have questions, you can ask those over at live.vognetwork.com, I'll try
2651800	2654320	to fit a few in here before we have to let Matt go.
2654320	2659360	But just kind of piggybacking on the Warcraft thing, I mean that's a cool story, but I was
2659360	2664560	also, like for me personally, something that kind of caught my attention was you had a
2664560	2670560	trans individual who was talking about Warcraft and that this, you know, and I don't happen
2670560	2675360	to be trans myself, so this is something I never thought of, right?
2675360	2682800	Is that this was a trans person who was playing a female character and was able to kind of
2682800	2690120	explore femininity, feminine, I can't even say this word, the feminine side through World
2690120	2691120	of Warcraft.
2691120	2694840	And, you know, it's interesting because I even know in the past I've made these jokes
2694840	2698720	and I've probably cracked them on air about how, oh, you know everybody that's playing
2698720	2703080	a woman in World of Warcraft is just some perv dude sitting there, right?
2703080	2704080	You know?
2704080	2705080	And those types of things.
2705080	2708680	And hearing a story like that definitely stopped and made me think, huh, there's definitely
2708680	2714200	a lot more to this than these stereotypes, I suppose, that are out there.
2714200	2716320	Yeah, yeah.
2716320	2717320	It's really true.
2717320	2724760	The one person that we spoke to, Jude in Bakersfield, told us a story about how when he was presenting
2724760	2730240	as female he got more sexual harassment in the game than he did after he transitioned
2730240	2732920	and was openly trans when he played.
2732920	2736640	He got harassed more as a woman than he did as a trans person.
2736640	2741960	We also heard from Laura Dale about how she was harassed for, you know, the people she
2741960	2746520	was playing with felt that she was being inconsistent with her gender and withholding something
2746520	2751120	when in reality she was just trying to figure herself out at the time.
2751120	2758960	So yeah, it's been tough for a lot of people because for sure it is possible for LGBT people
2758960	2762240	to feel very unwelcome in games, especially when you don't see yourself.
2762240	2764960	To feel like, oh, I guess maybe I'm not a gamer.
2764960	2767360	Maybe games aren't for me.
2767360	2774040	And so that's one reason why seeing yourself in games and why queer game events matter
2774040	2775040	to people.
2775040	2779280	To see yourself reflected there and to see other people like you affirms, yeah, yeah,
2779280	2780280	you exist.
2780280	2785460	You're a person and you belong here and we are eager to play with you.
2785460	2789360	And fifth dream in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com kind of piggybacking on this story a little
2789360	2791920	bit saying, I'm kind of like that with MMOs.
2791920	2796100	I've always felt pressured to be more manly, but I always play girls in games.
2796100	2799600	And since I've been playing Final Fantasy 14, and maybe it's a coincidence, but I've
2799600	2803920	kind of said, fuck it and dress more how I want and stop trying to be so much of a dude
2803920	2804920	dude.
2804920	2807160	But then again, I'm goth, so androgyny is easier.
2807160	2808860	Yeah, that's great.
2808860	2816460	So it's not just even necessarily for LGBT only people, it's a very broad spectrum.
2816460	2822900	And actually, I wanted to ask this question because our audience here at OLR is not exclusively
2822900	2823900	LGBT.
2823900	2827140	We have a lot of straight folks that listen to this program.
2827140	2832500	And we touched on this a little bit in the beginning about like, why might a straight
2832500	2835520	individual be interested in something like playing with pride?
2835520	2840000	But what I want to ask was, since you have taken this to expos like PAX, you know, which
2840000	2845120	is definitely not I mean, there's, you know, a lot of straight guys that go to PAX, like,
2845120	2849880	have you had a response from the non LGBT community?
2849880	2851240	What kind of response have you gotten?
2851240	2852240	Like, have you?
2852240	2855280	Have you heard that this project has worked in enlightening folks or what?
2855280	2858720	Yeah, well, so our goal isn't exactly to enlighten folks.
2858720	2863080	But what we've heard is that from from straight people in particular, one of the questions
2863080	2869080	that we get a lot is just how can I make my gaming environments more welcoming?
2869080	2873280	What can I do to ensure that people are having a good time?
2873280	2880200	And you know, my advice there is to listen, to ask people, you know, just to check in.
2880200	2881200	Are you having a good time?
2881200	2882320	Are you feeling okay?
2882320	2883640	Is everything comfortable?
2883640	2886900	And if there's a problem, if anyone's making you feel uncomfortable, if there's anything
2886900	2888440	that's missing, well, what can we do to change that?
2888440	2891800	What can we do to make sure everybody's having a good time?
2891800	2895020	Never underestimate the power of just asking and listening.
2895020	2899560	So that's that's been some of the response that we've heard from people who don't consider
2899560	2904200	themselves part of the LGBT community, but want to be good allies.
2904200	2909880	You know, the two things we hear are, why is this necessary?
2909880	2915400	And I think, to be perfectly honest, you know, this meaning LGBT game spaces or LGBT game
2915400	2916400	events.
2916400	2918760	And to be honest, I don't think they're necessary.
2918760	2923200	I mean, nobody needs a game convention of any kind.
2923200	2924600	We don't need it, but we like it.
2924600	2925600	It's important to us.
2925600	2926600	It matters to us.
2926600	2931840	You know, we're not going to die if they don't happen, but they really do change our lives.
2931840	2936440	And so what we found is, you know, at that collision of gay culture and game culture,
2936440	2942080	it reveals that playing together really helps us understand each other.
2942080	2945120	And that's really what it's about, that we come together, we have a good time, we make
2945120	2953720	friends, and we understand people that we might never have considered friends before.
2953720	2958260	I want to make sure, of course, I want to make sure we amply plug the playingwithpride.com
2958260	2962380	website so folks can check out this live stream for themselves and give you that feedback
2962380	2965360	that you are seeking about what happens next.
2965360	2967520	Is this a documentary or is this a video podcast?
2967520	2971280	But I also want to make sure we talk about your other projects, because you don't just
2971280	2974040	work with this playingwithpride.com.
2974040	2978520	You host a couple of podcasts yourself, right?
2978520	2979520	That's correct.
2979520	2980640	So I have a couple.
2980640	2985560	One is The Sewers of Paris, and that's at thesewersofparis.com or wherever you get your
2985560	2986560	podcasts.
2986560	2990180	And on that show, I talk to different gay men every week about entertainment that's
2990180	2992800	changed the lives of gay men.
2992800	2999240	So you know, people share stories about how Madonna or Oscar Wilde or John Waters or whatever
2999240	3004520	it is, those pieces of culture that have made a difference to them and have transformed
3004520	3005520	things for them.
3005520	3011920	I have an amazing story on one episode from this guy who watched some real cheesy 80s
3011920	3012920	films.
3012920	3017480	He was growing up in Russia and watched some really cheesy 80s films in the 80s.
3017480	3022040	They were broadcast on this pirate TV station where you had to wake up at 2 a.m. and tune
3022040	3023620	the TV to a certain channel.
3023620	3028620	And then you'd be able to watch Curly Sue got married, Curly Sue got married.
3028620	3032980	Just silly things, trading places.
3032980	3036260	But that formed this, for him and his mom who were just living together, it was the
3036260	3041860	two of them, it formed this vision of the U.S. for them of like, oh, the United States
3041860	3046400	is a lot better than this world we're growing up in, let's get out of this country.
3046400	3052340	So his mother became a mail-order bride so that they could get out of the U.S. and move
3052340	3056260	to a place where he could, it wasn't safe for him to be a gay kid in Russia, so they
3056260	3060980	moved to Seattle where he could be openly gay in a place that was a little bit safer.
3060980	3066700	And so he's just got this amazing story about how these visions of the U.S. via weird 80s
3066700	3070460	movies on a pirate TV station essentially saved his life.
3070460	3074580	So we've got lots of stories about that, about culture that has changed the lives of gay
3074580	3075580	men.
3075580	3076580	That's at sewersofparis.com.
3076580	3079420	I feel so cliche.
3079420	3082880	When I hear an amazing story like that, I feel so cliche because for me it was the Rocky
3082880	3083880	Horror Picture Show.
3083880	3089220	So you know, there's a ton of people like that, right?
3089220	3091380	Rocky Horror has been huge for our community.
3091380	3092620	But anyway, I digress.
3092620	3093620	Yeah.
3093620	3097520	Well, I mean, it has and everybody has a different Rocky experience.
3097520	3104580	You know, for me it was watching it with the high school drama club and realizing, essentially
3104580	3109300	getting permission from the movie to like other boys and to be weird about gender.
3109300	3116980	Because you know, I was growing up in a fairly un-gay suburb of Connecticut in the 90s.
3116980	3121540	And Rocky Horror kind of opened that up to that song at the end, Don't Dream It, Be It.
3121540	3122540	Yeah, for sure.
3122540	3124500	And it says, go be what you want to be.
3124500	3129620	And that's why Tim Curry is like a legend and always will be for me.
3129620	3133260	Not to make this all about me, but it is part of the reason I'm still like, I'm pushing
3133260	3135300	40 years old and I'm still involved with Rocky Horror.
3135300	3140280	In fact, I'm hosting Rocky Horror here in Sacramento on February 11th, plug, plug.
3140280	3146820	But part of the reason I still stay involved to this day is so that that exists for me,
3146820	3148820	who's 18 now.
3148820	3154660	Yeah, the kids today growing up.
3154660	3161020	I actually did a Rocky episode last year around Halloween from this guy who was actually homeless
3161020	3164800	living in LA, just squatting in different places.
3164800	3168540	And the community that sprang up, and this is when it was first run in the late 70s,
3168540	3173140	the community that sprung up around the Rocky Horror Picture Show, for him, that was his
3173140	3174140	community.
3174140	3175140	Like those were his people.
3175140	3177660	That literally saved his life and gave him people to connect with when he had nobody
3177660	3179980	and nowhere to go.
3179980	3182820	So that's all on SursaParis.com.
3182820	3185660	My other podcast is Defining Marriage, and that's a little more casual.
3185660	3191580	It's where my partner James and I talk about the week's LGBT news, but we're very casual
3191580	3193380	and jokey and chatty about it.
3193380	3198580	So half the show is about, you know, like this week we're talking about why Taiwan might
3198580	3203100	become the first country in Asia to legalize marriage equality and we talked about why
3203100	3204100	that is.
3204100	3207540	We talked about some of the silly stuff that's happening in Australia around marriage and
3207540	3213540	also there's this debate going on, very tiresome debate in Taiwan about like, well, if we legalize
3213540	3217260	marriage, couldn't people marry the Ferris wheel?
3217260	3219580	And so, oh boy, that argument.
3219580	3220580	So we make fun of that.
3220580	3221580	Ferris wheels need love too.
3221580	3222580	Hey, stop it.
3222580	3223580	Yeah, exactly.
3223580	3224580	Oh boy.
3224580	3226980	You can love, you can love a Ferris wheel.
3226980	3231700	You just don't love a Ferris wheel.
3231700	3234740	Love is a spectrum of many different colors in my opinion.
3234740	3239100	And the color that I love Alan with is not the same color that I love a Ferris wheel
3239100	3240100	with.
3240100	3241100	Yes.
3241100	3242100	Yeah, there are differences.
3242900	3247780	I think that's a funny joke to make on behalf of the other side, but gee whiz, maybe they
3247780	3252500	can think of some differences between same sex couples and Ferris wheels.
3252500	3255860	So anyway, so we talk about half about like LGBT stuff and then we always get sidetracked
3255860	3263140	on what games we're playing and we had, you know, got way down in the weeds on whatever
3263140	3266100	it is, whether it's anime or we're watching Steven universe.
3266100	3269220	So we had a lot to say about Steven universe this week.
3269220	3273220	So it's a lot of, it's a lot of nonsense on top of whatever's happening in the news
3273220	3274420	this week.
3274420	3277820	Let me shift back to games a little bit here with a question from our chat room.
3277820	3281500	And you know, you've, you have, you know, not just your podcast, but you have a very
3281500	3286100	rich history with some of the, you know, articles that you've written for various, you know,
3286100	3289900	GLBT plus publications and so forth.
3289900	3294460	You know, you, you obviously kind of have finger on the pulse of all this stuff.
3294460	3300280	But as a gamer as well, SGA 100 Matt wants to know in our chat room over at live.fognetwork.com,
3300280	3306380	what are your thoughts on the nonsense online backlash over Tracer being gay, the Overwatch
3306380	3307380	character?
3307380	3308380	Oh boy.
3308380	3309380	Oh boy.
3309380	3311780	Look, Tracer is a lesbian, end of story.
3311780	3314280	I mean, like that's very reductive.
3314280	3315280	Maybe she's bisexual.
3315280	3316280	Who knows?
3316280	3321740	But to be fair, the creator tweeted or the character design or something tweeted she's
3321740	3322740	lesbian.
3323020	3325500	We do know her identity is lesbian.
3325500	3327940	Okay, fantastic.
3327940	3329220	I think that's great.
3329220	3333980	Yeah, I think, sure, of course the people are having this backlash where they're like,
3333980	3336180	no, no, I, but I wanted her to be straight.
3336180	3344020	Well, for heaven's sake, if you need a attractive female video game character, please consult
3344020	3346160	all other game culture.
3346160	3350020	You have your pick of everything.
3350380	3354060	Let the lesbians have Tracer for heaven's sake.
3354060	3355560	And also like, so what?
3355560	3356560	She's a lesbian.
3356560	3360600	If you still want to fantasize her as waifu, then fucking, it's a fantasy.
3360600	3361600	It's a fantasy.
3361600	3363880	Yes, that's a good point.
3363880	3365820	Tracer does not actually exist.
3365820	3367720	She is a fictional character.
3367720	3371800	So you can believe whatever you want to believe about her.
3371800	3373860	But officially, I think it's important.
3373860	3378100	It's fun to joke about it, but it is also important to say, look, there are queer characters
3378100	3381840	in games and they're powerful and their sexuality isn't like they're defined, like they don't
3381840	3386540	shoulder the burden of representation for lesbians everywhere, that she is just living
3386540	3389300	her life and being a hero and being a lesbian.
3389300	3393100	We talked to a guy here in Seattle, Ian, who put it really nicely.
3393100	3396340	He was talking about Shepard when he was playing Mass Effect.
3396340	3402380	He said, finally, I could be the gay hero I've always wanted to be.
3402380	3405940	And I mean, what an amazing opportunity to give people, if you can create a character
3405940	3410420	that makes people feel like they can be a hero and they can be gay and they can be all
3410420	3412780	the things that make up who they are all at once.
3412780	3415300	They don't have to exclude a part of themselves.
3415300	3418260	What an amazing feeling and what a great way for people to connect.
3418260	3422860	Well, I think finally I can be the gay hero I've always wanted to be is a good note for
3422860	3424260	us to end this on.

3513220	3516440	Baume, M-A-T-T B-A-U-M-E.
3516440	3519500	Thank you so much for taking the time out and being on our show this week and I really
3519500	3525560	look forward to whatever is next for Playing with Pride, be it documentary, podcasts, whatever,
3525560	3528080	whatever they decide to do with it.
3528080	3533300	Anyhow, we're going to get back into some gaming news, but not until we talk about our
3533300	3536000	gaming weeks, because we are still, we're about an hour into the show.
3536000	3539080	We haven't even talked about what types of video games we've been playing this week.
3539080	3540860	So, Loki, how was your gaming week?
3540860	3547420	So this week I did purchase a new game, so I, and whoa, I played it on Steam even.
3547420	3549740	It was Happy Room.
3549740	3554860	So like, I was watching, you know, one of the YouTubers, I watched Ollie43 and he does
3554860	3561140	a lot of pretty fun GTA 5 mod videos and so one of the games he played was Happy Room
3561140	3565500	and if you've ever played like Happy Wheels, it's basically kind of the same type of thing
3565500	3571020	where you have a rag doll that you torture through, you know, all sorts of means, whereas
3571020	3575620	Happy Wheels is more of getting from point A to point B via bike or whatever and being
3575620	3577060	horribly offensive.
3577060	3581340	This is just straight up, here's a dummy, create a death trap for the dummy, do as much
3581340	3583380	damage as you can, try to kill the dummy.
3583380	3588340	And so you do that and they have different challenges like, you know, put the dummy on
3588340	3593700	a saw blade for, you know, 10 seconds or, you know, freeze, electrocute and set on fire
3593700	3595900	and, I don't know.
3595900	3599900	So I played that all this week and I finally got to the point where I unlocked the sandbox
3599900	3603620	mode and kind of the point where I'm actually getting trophies now because all of it has
3603620	3606140	to do with killing the dummy.
3606140	3612060	So it was fun, it was like, I think it was like a 10 buck game, it was pretty cheap.
3612060	3614860	But yeah, nice time killer.
3614860	3620700	And then a little bit of Ingress and I think I did manage to play a little bit of Skyrim
3620700	3621700	Remastered.
3621700	3624020	That was about it.
3624020	3625020	Alright.
3625020	3630740	My gaming week has been kind of boring compared to previous weeks because I didn't play any
3630740	3631740	real new stuff.
3631740	3635780	I thought about getting Dragon Quest VIII on the 3DS and I really do love Dragon Quest
3635780	3640740	VIII but I think it, from what I'm hearing, it seems like it might be a little bit of
3640740	3645080	a step down from the PlayStation 2 version because like the orchestrated music can't
3645080	3649300	be in there, the little screen kind of makes it a little harder for some stuff.
3649300	3653540	So I don't know, I might still pick it up at some point but I didn't end up getting
3653540	3654540	Dragon Quest VIII.
3654540	3658420	Do you guys think I made the right decision in chat, live.foggamer.com?
3658420	3659420	Let's see.
3659420	3661980	But what I did play this week, I did play more Final Fantasy XIV which, you know, I
3661980	3662980	play a lot of that game obviously.
3662980	3667260	But they just had a new patch come out in this past week which was a new story patch.
3667260	3670180	That means there's new dungeons, there's a new raid I still got to do.
3670180	3674220	There's a lot of new stuff that opened up in Final Fantasy XIV so, you know, that team's
3674220	3678360	done a great job of making sure that like new content is coming out every two or three
3678360	3681900	months that gives you something else to do, to explore.
3681900	3683540	So that's been great.
3683540	3687620	So keeps me a fan and has kept me subscribed since the beginning of Realm Reborn really
3687620	3690100	so good job to the XIV team.
3690100	3693620	And then I also played a little bit of Overwatch, been playing that like I mentioned earlier
3693620	3694620	in the show.
3694620	3695620	Alan and I will play.
3695620	3698240	I'm trying to force myself to learn some new characters.
3698280	3704440	So I've taken a weird liking to Ana lately because I learned you kind of, you can use
3704440	3707280	her scope and you really should use her scope wherever possible.
3707280	3710520	But you can really do a lot with Ana, like not even using her scope.
3710520	3714680	Like you can actually be kind of a more effective healer, just kind of like firing bullets repeatedly
3714680	3717360	at your team and using the grenades and all the other stuff that she does.
3717360	3720600	So I'm just kind of trying to learn and Ana is not an easy character because I'm not a
3720600	3721960	very good sniper.
3721960	3726020	But I've like tried to learn how to use Widowmaker a little more so I'm kind of like forcing
3726020	3728680	myself to be a better sniper, if that makes sense.
3728680	3730860	So yeah, you don't really play Overwatch.
3730860	3735980	I'm speaking a foreign language to you right now, but I swear you're missing out, Loki.
3735980	3736980	It's a real fun game.
3736980	3738740	Even if it is a shooter, not everybody's into shooters.
3738740	3739740	I have a great time with that.
3739740	3740740	I'm in the shooters.
3740740	3744140	I just don't want to play online games because it requires me to dedicate a ton of time to
3744140	3746180	that stuff and I just don't have that time anymore.
3746180	3748820	Well, you know, but the nice thing about Overwatch is those games aren't very long.
3748820	3752920	You know, I usually I'll drop in, I'll play like two or three games and then I'll get
3752920	3755340	really frustrated and just quit.
3755340	3757040	So it's kind of like, you know, drop in, drop out.
3757040	3760200	But yeah, just been playing a little bit of Overwatch as well.
3760200	3761300	So that's pretty much been my gaming week.
3761300	3764680	I haven't really gotten around to doing any new stuff.
3764680	3767980	I did do the Hatsune Miku game they released on PlayStation 4, but I can't remember if
3767980	3772200	that was last week or this week, but they released a new Hatsune Miku game on PlayStation
3772200	3776760	4, but it's you download it and you only get like two songs.
3776760	3780860	You have to buy all the rest, but it's like it's kind of a bit of money to buy the other
3780860	3781860	song.
3781940	3786140	It's like, I think if you drop the, what is it, 50 bucks or something to get both packs,
3786140	3788380	I don't know if that's the right number, sorry guys.
3788380	3789700	It's like 240 songs.
3789700	3791020	It's a lot of songs.
3791020	3797300	So I'm kind of like teetering on that buy now button, but because Hatsune Miku is as
3797300	3800780	silly and ridiculous as it is, it is kind of a lot of fun for a music game.
3800780	3803100	Like I do, I do really enjoy it.
3803100	3806620	So like I keep hovering over that buy now button, but it's like, you know, there's going
3806620	3807620	to be a sale.
3807620	3810900	Like, you know, they're going to do a sale because it's Sega, there's going to be a sale
3810940	3814580	Black Friday or something like I can get it cheaper then, but I don't know.
3814580	3817900	The question will be, uh, can I, can I hold out that long?
3817900	3818900	I don't know.
3818900	3819900	Anyway.
3819900	3824540	Um, uh, let's see fifth dream and chat over at live.vognetwork.com says I got all the
3824540	3826900	future tones songs day one.
3826900	3830540	I've been waiting for this for a while and there's, I think people have actually tweeted
3830540	3832960	me too, that I should just take the plunge.
3832960	3835100	So I probably will, but I just haven't yet.
3835100	3838780	I've been getting a lot of use out of just those two songs that the free, free, free
3838780	3839780	thing comes with.
3839940	3841820	Anyway, so that's it for our gaming week.
3841820	3846220	So a little bit of housekeeping, of course, you can always follow us on Twitter, twitter.com
3846220	3851500	slash O L R we're also on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.
3851500	3855540	I do want to make sure I plug something here coming up this week, actually, actually it's
3855540	3856540	tomorrow.
3856540	3860380	So if you happen to be local, uh, it would be awesome if you want to drop by and say
3860380	3861380	hello.
3861380	3865140	Uh, for those of you that are local, um, Sacramento, I GDA, which, you know, we're buddies with
3865140	3869140	a Brie and Gabe and all the folks at Sac I GDA, uh, they're actually doing an event tomorrow
3869200	3875860	called developing a game from concept to paycheck success through community with T cubed.
3875860	3878300	And it's going down at hacker lab downtown.
3878300	3880700	And that's tomorrow at six o'clock Pacific.
3880700	3883140	And um, I don't know if they're going to stream it or anything like that.
3883140	3885180	Sometimes Brie gets it out, gets off the phone.
3885180	3888100	It's so exciting because I'm going to actually be down that way.
3888100	3889100	Well, not tomorrow.
3889100	3891100	Um, come say hello.
3891100	3894780	No, I'm going to be down that way in a couple of weeks, actually.
3894780	3898480	I'm going to be start working on there for about six weeks because I have a stint going
3898480	3899480	down there.
3899480	3900480	Nice.
3900480	3904420	Um, so I'm going to be talking to the creators of this T cubed, which is, which is actually
3904420	3905920	a physical game.
3905920	3910120	It's an actual like physical cube that you play like a modern version to tic tac toe
3910120	3911120	on.
3911120	3912120	Yeah, it's like a tic tac toe thing.
3912120	3918280	And then I tried playing on the prototype like back last, um, Sac I GDA arcade and unfortunately
3918280	3919860	I didn't quite get it.
3919860	3920860	It's evolved a lot.
3920860	3925080	I watched this little presentation that the guy did and the way he explained it to the
3925080	3926800	whole crowd in like five seconds.
3926800	3929200	So I imagine the game shifted a lot.
3929200	3935820	Um, so yeah, anyway, um, he started, I think they, they started though doing Android development
3935820	3937460	and it kind of shifted into this.
3937460	3940680	So anyway, uh, going to be talking to him live at this event.
3940680	3941680	They asked me to moderate it.
3941680	3945840	So that's why I'm, I'm plugging it cause I'm going to be there moderating this and uh,
3945840	3946840	talking about that.
3946840	3948360	So for you locals, come on down.
3948360	3951400	Um, I don't know if there will be punching pie, but possibly.
3951400	3952400	So check that out.
3952400	3953400	I'll be there.
3953400	3954400	Isn't that all you need?
3954400	3955400	All right.
3956160	3960080	Let's get into some gaming news Loki.
3960080	3962680	So the Oculus lawsuits already begun.
3962680	3968720	Um, of course with that Zenny max did, um, make a statement basically saying, you know,
3968720	3972880	the, you know, the trial has started and you know, we're excited to present our case and
3972880	3973880	all that stuff.
3973880	3977360	And we're so awesome and yeah, whatever.
3977360	3981880	So um, but what's, you know, a little bit more interesting here though.
3981880	3988520	Um, so Mark Zuckerberg is going to be testifying in the trial as well.
3988520	3994880	So I'm basically saying, you know, I, I don't think that, um, good virtual reality is fully
3994880	3995880	there yet.
3995880	3998680	It's going to take five or 10 more years of development before we get to where we want
3998680	3999680	to go.
3999680	4003920	And then kind of defending that, you know, they didn't actually steal the information
4003920	4011320	from, um, Zenny max, uh, it's, you know, they were saying that it's pretty common when you
4011320	4015120	announce a big deal or do something that all kinds of people are coming out of the
4015120	4018040	woodwork and claiming that they did some portion of the deal.
4018040	4023380	Um, like most people in court, I've never even heard of Zenny max before.
4023380	4029240	So he's basically kind of saying that they smelled money and so now they're coming and
4029240	4030320	try to get a piece of that.
4030320	4034320	So it's that Mariah Carey gift that's out there where it says, I don't know her when
4034320	4035320	it comes to Zenny max.
4035320	4036320	Right?
4036320	4039800	I mean, I originally, that's a kind of what it seemed like and they're like, oh yeah,
4039800	4042320	we want that $2 billion and we'll see.
4042320	4045520	I guess it'll all come out, you know, since it's going to trial now that we'll find out
4045520	4046520	what's going on.
4046520	4047520	Yeah.
4047520	4051160	Usually these things are settled and this is, there's both sides are being very stubborn
4051160	4054440	while they want $2 billion so that they aren't going to sell for that.
4054440	4059320	So interesting to see what actually happens or I don't know.
4059320	4064880	I can't help but think though, I don't really care how the outcome is either way because
4064880	4066760	I think the vibe looks like a better product.
4066760	4067760	So yeah, whatever.
4068720	4073560	Well, and it seems like a lot of folks are, are, are kind of coalescing around the vibe
4073560	4074560	right now.
4074560	4079400	I mean, I don't, I don't have the same insight into the VR scene as our pal Bobby does.
4079400	4082040	But just, you know, just based on what I see on Twitter and people to get the hands on
4082040	4086000	and all that, like it seems like there's more kind of coalescing around the vibe right now.
4086000	4087000	Right now.
4087000	4088000	Yeah.
4088000	4090840	And I mean, there's going to be more headsets coming out for sure from a lot of different
4090840	4091840	companies.
4091840	4096120	I mean, especially now they, they announced more coming from, you know, CES, you know,
4096120	4100880	it's going to tie in more with that windows holographic stuff and their virtual reality
4100880	4102920	OS type thing.
4102920	4107360	So that'll be interesting to see how that plays, you know, part of it.
4107360	4111640	But I mean, this certainly is a hassle.
4111640	4117480	Well, some other big news that happened this week Nintendo had another direct but this
4117480	4118480	one was not about the switch.
4118480	4122120	It was about the Fire Emblem series, which I'm going to admit, I don't get super into
4122120	4123480	the tactical RPGs.
4123480	4128840	So Fire Emblem's not usually a franchise that I get very invested in, but I do recognize
4128840	4132380	a lot of people really enjoy this franchise.
4132380	4136960	But you know, you might have been more happy if it was like the F-Zero direct or Metro
4136960	4137960	direct.
4137960	4140280	If it had been the F-Zero direct, I would have popped the popcorn.
4140280	4142120	I would have been on the couch with my pants off.
4142120	4143120	No, I'm just kidding.
4143120	4144120	TMI.
4144120	4145120	I'm just kidding.
4145120	4148300	But I would be very, very excited if it was an F-Zero direct, but I kind of like, here's
4148300	4149300	the thing.
4149300	4155660	Kind of accepting, not really accepting, but just trying to accept dealing with the fact
4155660	4158780	that Mario Kart has just kind of taken F-Zero's place.
4158780	4164020	And that was kind of solidified when they fucking put the F-Zero track in Mario Kart.
4164020	4167380	Yeah, but I think that's just a throwback thing.
4167380	4169140	I don't think that's necessarily anything.
4169140	4172840	It's not like Mario Kart replaced Animal Crossing or Zelda.
4172840	4174560	So I mean, they had tracks from those.
4174560	4175560	So I don't know.
4175560	4179100	I just think that it was, they wanted to do a track and they're like, oh, hey, our
4179100	4181060	cars kind of stick to things and it works.
4181060	4183300	I mean, Mario Kart 8 is no F-Zero.
4183300	4187420	Anyway, Act Def says, seriously, where's my Kirby direct?
4187420	4188660	It's the 25th anniversary.
4188660	4192380	Well, to be fair, Act Def, it's January, so there's time.
4192380	4196420	But what you can pray for right now is that Kirby will get more acknowledgement than Metroid
4196420	4197420	got.
4197420	4198420	I'm just saying.
4198420	4199420	Let's see.
4199420	4202860	And Akuma JP says, Japanese love their Fire Emblem.
4202860	4203860	That's true.
4203860	4207620	I mean, Fire Emblem was a series in Japan for a long time before we ever saw it.
4207620	4213060	And really, I kind of think we can thank Smash Brothers for finally getting Fire Emblem
4213060	4217500	over here because a lot of people were asking, who's these characters?
4217500	4220900	Why are they, it's too bad that same logic hasn't worked for Mother 3, but at least we
4220900	4221900	had Earthbound.
4221900	4222900	Yeah.
4222900	4229780	I mean, F-Zero, they had the 25th anniversary two years ago for that.
4229780	4230780	No new F-Zero yet.
4230780	4231780	No, not yet.
4231780	4232780	Where's the love?
4232780	4233780	Where's the love?
4233780	4234780	I don't know.
4234780	4236020	Anyway, so about the direct.
4236020	4239660	So for Fire Emblem fans, and even if you're a non-fan, maybe this is your chance to get
4239660	4243300	involved with the series because it's definitely going to show up everywhere.
4243300	4247540	For a series that was almost dead a few years ago, Nintendo was like, if you don't sell
4247540	4249760	a quarter million of these, we're done.
4249760	4251620	This is a remarkable turnaround for Fire Emblem.
4251620	4252620	So good for them.
4252620	4257100	But anyway, Fire Emblem Echoes Shadows of Valentia has been announced.
4257100	4261380	It's going to be a 3DS game, which I found interesting because I was ready to say, oh,
4261380	4265500	the 3DS is done as a Pokemon Sun and Moon, but that doesn't appear to be the case.
4265980	4268300	You got to keep pumping money in that just in case.
4268300	4271580	I guess, but wow, that was kind of surprising me.
4271580	4273700	And now it's kind of like, well, why not just put it on the Switch?
4273700	4275340	Because that's your new portable system.
4275340	4278780	Well, Fire Emblem will be getting a Switch game in 2018.
4278780	4281420	That was something else that they announced during this.
4281420	4284740	So not only is there going to be the 3DS game, but there is going to be a Fire Emblem Switch
4284740	4287460	game in 2018.
4287460	4292060	It is going to be the first console game since Radiant Dawn, which was released in 2008.
4292060	4294580	So that's a pretty big deal.
4294700	4297460	Fire Emblem Heroes also coming out.
4297460	4300320	This is Nintendo's next smartphone game.
4300320	4303700	So it's the follow-up of sorts to Super Mario Run.
4303700	4306620	But we knew they'd been working on Fire Emblem and Animal Crossing games.
4306620	4307820	So here we go.
4307820	4310820	Fire Emblem Heroes is on its way.
4310820	4315180	Originally in the presentation said it would only be on Google Play right away, but after
4315180	4319460	the fact came out and clarified, it will be a simultaneous release on both platforms.
4319460	4324200	February 2nd is the day, so that's not far away really for Fire Emblem Heroes.
4324200	4328280	This may be a good way for people like me who are kind of, I don't know, I don't really
4328280	4333120	like tactical RPG, but hey, when you put the price tag of free on it, I'll check it out.
4333120	4334120	Right?
4334120	4335120	So.
4335120	4336120	Well.
4336120	4340000	Well, BS, but there are going to be microtransactions in the game.
4340000	4341720	So we'll see how bad it is.
4341720	4344760	I can't believe they have actually, like, you know, I know they did that with Super
4344760	4351340	Mario Run on iOS and I just figured it was, you know, Apple being retarded.
4351340	4354460	But they had, you know, the whole, like, notify me.
4354460	4358920	It's almost like a pre-order for a free-to-play game, like, dude, nobody needs to fucking
4358920	4361460	notify me that there's something on the market, you know.
4361460	4362460	I don't care.
4362460	4364720	I have something that notifies me way faster.
4364720	4368820	It's called Twitter, just for the record, but even with that notify thing, it didn't
4368820	4369820	even really work.
4369820	4372940	Like, people got notified, like, mid-day after the game had already been out.
4372940	4377700	It worked as well as the fucking Amazon notify me when the Switch becomes in stock.
4377700	4378700	Twice.
4378700	4379900	Twice it was for sale.
4379900	4382740	Twice it did not fucking send one single notification.
4382740	4385500	I was signed up for that too and it never did send, did it?
4385500	4386500	We never, yeah.
4386500	4388060	It's like, what's the point, Amazon?
4388060	4391020	Why even have that if you're not gonna fucking use it?
4391020	4399180	Anyway, let's see, Fire Emblem Warriors also will be coming to the new Nintendo 3DS and
4399180	4405680	that of course is the, like, Hyrule Warriors Musou game.
4405680	4408780	What the hell was the original of that series?
4408780	4409780	Why can't I remember all this?
4409780	4413180	Thank you, Dynasty Warriors-esque type of game.
4413180	4417740	That will be also on the new Nintendo 3DS.
4417740	4421020	Interesting that they say just new Nintendo 3DS.
4421020	4424340	My thought is they have now written off the old 3DS.
4424340	4425340	Oh, yeah.
4425340	4426340	Interesting.
4426340	4427340	Yeah, I didn't.
4427340	4428340	Yeah.
4428340	4429340	Stupid.
4429340	4433060	Yeah, seeing as I still haven't bought a new 3DS, that doesn't bode well for me, but
4433060	4436060	I don't know, anyway.
4436060	4438980	That's pretty much what I wanted to say on Fire Emblem.
4439380	4444020	Did they come out and clarify that it would work on the older 3DS as well?
4444020	4448820	I don't think it will because, if it's the Warriors game, just because I think that they
4448820	4458420	did that for the new 3DS for Hyrule Warriors and it ran like shit on the regular 3DS.
4458420	4460980	And Act F confirms it's new 3DS only.
4460980	4461980	Wow.
4461980	4463260	Well, alright.
4463260	4464260	Good luck with that strategy.
4464260	4465260	Guess I better buy a new 3DS.
4465260	4466260	Oh, nope.
4466260	4467260	Nope.
4467260	4468260	Not gonna do it.
4468540	4470980	I still have the Switch, so I can always get the Switch version, but...
4470980	4475420	Yeah, I mean, it's not gonna be an underpowered system or anything, so...
4475420	4476420	Alright.
4476420	4477420	Anyhow.
4477420	4478420	Do you want to do this piece?
4478420	4482460	So, we have to divvy up Dark Sakura's stories, because she was slotted on our list here,
4482460	4483460	but she's not here.
4483460	4487220	She had to cancel last minute, so do you want to do this one, Loki?
4487220	4488220	Sure.
4488220	4493420	So, apparently some Zelda fans have uncovered the Breath of the Wild backstory from the
4493420	4494940	Special Edition map.
4494940	4502500	So they were showing off the map on the whole Treehouse livestream, and apparently people
4502500	4508340	have decoded the Hyrulean language on there, and so they've kind of gotten the backstory.
4508340	4511780	So here's what it says.
4511780	4518700	Hylians passed stories of a destined time long past where multiple races lived and worked
4518700	4520380	together in harmony.
4520380	4525060	The Sheikah tribe's blue aura breathed through the land.
4525060	4529380	This mutual prosperity continued until cataclysmic disaster struck.
4529380	4534020	The hero and the princess attempted to seal the terror, which became known as the Calamity
4534020	4535020	Ganon.
4535020	4536020	Ooh, Calamity Ganon.
4536020	4539020	That's not just regular Ganon, that's Calamity Ganon.
4539020	4541460	I like Calamity Jane.
4541460	4547740	Divine beasts awoke from four directions and deployed a mechanical army, which made the
4547740	4549700	king and his people fearful.
4549700	4556220	They fractured Ganon's powers and sealed him, but the Sheikahs were banished from the
4556220	4558820	land ever since.
4558820	4561620	So it's Zelda.
4561620	4567400	Ganon rose to power, they broke up the Triforce, it's fucking Zelda.
4567400	4572740	And that's okay, because that's the game we all want to play, so that sounds fine by me.
4572740	4576020	Anyhow, I hope that was, I hope that some people would have considered what we just
4576020	4580180	talked about, spoilers, but I really think there's a lot more layers to this game than
4580180	4581180	that one little piece.
4581180	4585140	So I hope your feathers weren't ruffled by us going over that, but it is, it is traveling
4585140	4586140	around.
4586140	4587140	It's a backstory.
4587140	4588140	I mean, it's like, it's fucking Zelda.
4588140	4589260	Everybody wants to know about this new Zelda.
4589260	4594380	They haven't, for all, you know, that's out there, they haven't said a lot about it.
4594380	4597740	I mean, sure, they've showed the game, they have the trailer and so forth, but we haven't,
4597740	4601420	we don't know a lot about the story, so it'd be interesting to see where it goes.
4601420	4603980	Anyhow, what else in gaming news, Loki?
4603980	4604980	All right.
4605020	4609780	So apparently the developer of the last Guitar Hero game, Freestyle Games, has been acquired
4609780	4610780	by Ubisoft.
4610780	4615540	Does that mean that they're going to work on something else?
4615540	4617660	Rocksmith, maybe?
4617660	4620020	I'm hoping not, though, because remember Freestyle is...
4620020	4621020	Or just Dance.
4621020	4623860	Eh, fuck just Dance.
4623860	4626860	Because Freestyle Games, remember, they did the DJ Hero franchise.
4626860	4627860	Yeah.
4627860	4628860	So...
4628860	4631660	Please, another DJ Hero game.
4631660	4634340	Or DJ something else game.
4634740	4636740	A DJ Smith type of game.
4636740	4637740	DJ Smith?
4637740	4639740	Maybe, I don't know, I don't know, maybe.
4639740	4640740	Beat Smith?
4640740	4641740	Maybe.
4641740	4642740	Dubstep Smith?
4642740	4648860	Well, I'm just glad to hear they're not closing, because their games, as far as I've heard,
4648860	4652660	have kind of underperformed, but I really feel like it's not their fault.
4652660	4656820	Like a lot of what happened at the DJ Hero and the Guitar Hero era was just like saturation
4656820	4657820	in the market of music games.
4657820	4663660	It's fucking Ubisoft, because they decided to have so many developers making just fucking
4663660	4667060	million Guitar Hero games, like they have four Guitar Hero games coming out each year,
4667060	4668780	which is too much.
4668780	4674580	And then on top of that, a lot of these other studios get rolled into fucking Call of Duty,
4674580	4679580	where they're just like, oh, we got four different studios working on Call of Duty, and some
4679580	4681700	working on DLC.
4681700	4686220	That would be where these guys would end up, had they not been purchased.
4686220	4687220	Yeah, that's really...
4687220	4692660	And so what the last thing they really did was Guitar Hero Live, which was like the reboot
4692660	4697380	of Guitar Hero, which really wasn't bad at all, but like, I think people were just like...
4697380	4698380	They don't care.
4698380	4699380	They don't care.
4699380	4701020	It doesn't have the impact anymore than it used to do.
4701020	4704260	So I'd be curious to see what Freestyle Games, but like you mentioned, they also do Call
4704260	4709260	of Duty stuff now, so they kind of have a very broad range of stuff they do, so it'll
4709260	4712720	be very interesting to see what they do when they team up with Ubisoft and what ends up
4712720	4713720	coming out.
4713720	4718620	But I imagine we won't hear anything until E3 at the earliest, if then, because projects
4718620	4719620	take time.
4720180	4722740	We may not hear anything until 2018, for all we know.
4722740	4727340	Anyhow, something you can do right now, especially if you have a PlayStation VR, you know, there
4727340	4732620	was a lot of VR games that hit early on when the thing first came out, but now it's been
4732620	4734340	drying up a little bit, even though it is January.
4734340	4737740	It hasn't been drying up, but there's just not a whole ton of like really great stuff.
4737740	4738740	Not a lot of compelling software, yeah.
4738740	4742240	Like they have that rollercoaster game that was supposed to be coming out that came out
4742240	4743980	and was just shit.
4743980	4747100	It was absolute dog shit.
4747100	4751820	So that was unfortunate, but there's not like really big games coming out for VR.
4751820	4757500	I mean, aside from Resident Evil 7, which is supposed to be next week, but beyond that,
4757500	4759540	there's not a whole ton on the horizon.
4759540	4764660	Well, something that's an added benefit now for PlayStation VR is that there is now support
4764660	4768420	for 360 degree videos on YouTube.
4768420	4773700	So the app has been updated, so you can actually look at these 360 degree videos.
4773780	4778580	Granted, there aren't a ton of them, but the New York Times, I guess, has a daily 360 video
4778580	4779980	that they do.
4779980	4785620	So I mentioned a lot of times when these new technologies come out, like you see the 4K
4785620	4790120	TVs on display at, you know, your local Best Buy or whatever.
4790120	4795860	They're always showing either like a sports thing or it's nature.
4795860	4801180	Like let's explore the insides of a volcano and you can see it in high definition and
4801300	4803820	you can make out every single rock that's there.
4803820	4806700	So I imagine these are the type of videos that are available on YouTube.
4806700	4810260	I don't have a PSVR, but I imagine these are the type of things that are available on YouTube
4810260	4811500	360, right?
4811500	4813220	Explore the insides of a volcano.
4813220	4815260	I haven't done that, but I've done them on my phone and stuff.
4815260	4818900	National Geographic goes to the rainforest, those types of things.
4818900	4821460	Yeah, I mean, it's just that kind of thing.
4821460	4824820	I mean, it's, I don't know, they're okay.
4824820	4827700	Like I watched them with like dolphins running along a boat or something.
4827700	4828700	Oh, the dolphins are cute.
4828700	4829700	It was all right.
4829700	4830700	It's like, okay.
4831220	4836540	A lot of them I find, you know, the 360 videos, it's like they really, I mean, there's really
4836540	4839140	no need for them to be 360.
4839140	4840140	I don't know.
4840140	4846740	Let's get a 360 video of a guar concert or something that I can just really be there
4846740	4847740	in the middle of things.
4847740	4854060	I want, I want, I want that guy to like inhale blood and then spit it all over the camera
4854060	4856300	at one of these like death metal shows.
4856300	4859740	That's what I want to do on YouTube 360 because I'm getting too old for a mosh pit.
4859780	4862300	So wouldn't that be an exciting experience?
4862300	4865920	Would you, would you watch a rock concert?
4865920	4869460	Maybe once.
4869460	4870460	Maybe one.
4870460	4871460	I don't know.
4871460	4877100	It's just, I tried, I guess I still have to try it out.
4877100	4879100	I haven't bothered to mess with that.
4879100	4880460	I played a lot of Yarsa.
4880460	4886700	I actually have, was it, I purchased, um, last sale, I think, um, that whole, um, Oh,
4887260	4889780	what the hell is it called now?
4889780	4895500	It was, it said the bar VR one where he actually can like throw bottles and like you could,
4895500	4900820	you can play, you can play games like you can play billiards and skeeball and shuffle
4900820	4903460	board and darts and all that stuff.
4903460	4907300	Or you can stack chairs, you can throw bottles, you can do all sorts of, and it's multiplayer
4907300	4908300	so you can play with other people.
4908300	4909300	You can throw bottles at people?
4909300	4911040	You can throw bottles at people.
4911040	4912040	Bar fight.
4912040	4913040	Yeah, you could.
4913040	4916580	You could do a bar fight or you can like stack chairs and then like knock them over or you
4916580	4921580	can, you know, just cheat and skeeball by like crawling up the, you know, skeeball thing
4921580	4922580	to drop the balls in.
4922580	4924860	Best use of VR yet.
4924860	4930460	It's pretty silly, but, um, more of that stuff please.
4930460	4934900	To register participation for this week's episode of orange lounge radio at vognetwork.com,
4934900	4936380	use the pass phrase option.
4936380	4942020	All right, well, uh, valve, uh, obviously they are behind the HTC Vive and hopefully
4942020	4944900	they're going to be developing some more VR games.
4944900	4949740	Uh, and it has been talked about this week that valve does have more unannounced games
4949740	4951460	in the work works.
4951460	4957220	And this is straight from the Gabe himself because he did a AMA on Reddit.
4957220	4962580	Uh, and the question that was asked was, is valve still working on any fully fledged single
4962580	4964020	player games?
4964020	4969740	And the answer that Gabe Newell gave was yes, that's it.
4969740	4976100	Just, yes, very direct and to the point, I don't really care about sequels and stuff,
4976100	4981380	but like, I'm just glad they're working on something because like, honestly they haven't
4981380	4986020	had a lot come out recently and I used to like it when it was like, when they were releasing
4986020	4989460	more stuff for you, like left for dead and portal and all that stuff, I'd be just happy
4989460	4993820	for a sequel for anything or something new even just because all their stuff is pretty
4993820	4994820	fantastic.
4995260	4999740	And apparently Gabe also replied to like a half-life three question and wrote a very
4999740	5003140	tongue in cheek, the number three must not be said.
5003140	5005380	So Gabe is self-aware everybody.
5005380	5007740	So yes, I'm sure he is aware of the internet.
5007740	5008740	I'm sure.
5008740	5009740	Yes.
5009740	5013180	Gabe has apparently heard of the internet and has seen your memes.
5013180	5014420	Look out everybody.
5014420	5015420	He's listening.
5015420	5016420	Anyway.
5016420	5021100	Uh, yeah, no clues really in the AMA what else is going on, but, uh, he did say as part
5021100	5025100	of the AMA that, uh, they are trying to get more games on the source engine.
5025100	5029180	And that is the foundation of some unannounced projects.
5029180	5030180	So there it is.
5030180	5034940	He said, listen, we are not making any games with the name, with the number three in the
5034940	5041820	title period, uh, dungeon Buster in chat says, uh, are you working on something?
5041820	5042820	Yes.
5042820	5044540	Internet loses its collective shit.
5044540	5045540	Pretty much SSG.
5045540	5046540	One hundred.
5046540	5048380	Matt says, Gabe has seen your dank memes.
5048380	5052660	He's unimpressed pretty much.
5052660	5054860	Let's all hope Gabe doesn't listen to this show.
5054860	5063140	Uh, anyway, uh, dark Tetsuya jokes, half-life two episode 2.2 see that no three in there.
5063140	5065500	Oh, there'll be a new half-life game.
5065500	5067700	It'll be like a remastered half-life game.
5067700	5070660	It'll be a half, half-life full life.
5070660	5072260	Uh, all right.
5072260	5076100	Uh, Loki what's next before we get to the classic game of the week here soon half for
5076100	5077100	life.
5077100	5078100	Okay.
5078100	5089340	Um, so Nintendo, um, you know, they had, they've released, you know, Super Mario Brothers for,
5089340	5091660	you know, many times on virtual console.
5091660	5098340	Well, the Wii, um, I want to say the, yeah, the Wii version of the game, um, apparently
5098340	5104120	someone dug through the actual files on virtual console and they found out that there's, um,
5104120	5108160	some lines of code from a header from an NES file.
5108160	5113400	Now those NES files were built originally for emulators.
5113400	5121960	Um, so this basically isn't necessarily a dump from the ROM because this was added specifically
5121960	5129360	to those things to, you know, point the emulator to the right, um, ROM files to read.
5129360	5135080	So what's kind of funny is this file actually existed on the internet prior to the Wii.
5135080	5143960	So it's almost like that they downloaded the ROM and then resold it to you and the ultimate
5143960	5144960	irony.
5144960	5145960	Yeah, I know.
5145960	5149640	It's one of those things where I noticed there's, there seems to be a lot of rage around this
5149640	5154000	story or whatever, like how dare Nintendo sell us, uh, this product.
5154000	5158800	But I'm kind of like, well, it's kind of a funny gotcha in a way.
5158800	5160000	It's not a funny gotcha.
5160000	5161000	It's basically...
5161000	5162000	What?
5162000	5163000	Why not?
5163000	5164000	It's their fucking game.
5164000	5165000	Let them do what they want.
5165000	5166000	Well, right.
5166000	5170400	I understand that, but, and it is technically their property, but it's like someone dumped
5170400	5171400	it.
5171400	5172400	Okay.
5172400	5173400	Let me, I'm trying to think of the best way to describe this.
5173400	5180600	So like, um, imagine that somebody, okay, here's a good example.
5180600	5185640	I think that we can liken this to like someone fan translating a game and then they decided
5185640	5191520	to sell the game online with those translations, you know, technically it's their thing.
5191520	5198320	It's something that was added to the game, you know, um, modified to the actual ROM file
5198320	5201640	and then they're reselling it because, hey, it's our property and we would just sue you
5201640	5202640	anyways.
5202640	5208560	I mean, it's a, such a minor thing though for this NES ROM, which is kind of funny.
5208560	5212580	I think it's one of those funny, like, haha, you know, they tell us not to download ROMs
5212580	5215860	and here they are downloading ROMs and reselling them.
5215860	5220700	Well, but it, it took a long time to figure this out.
5220700	5224060	I mean, how long is Super Mario Brothers been on the Wii Virtual Console?
5224060	5225660	The Wii's a 10 year old system now.
5225660	5229600	I don't, I don't remember what was out day one for Virtual Console, but I can't imagine
5229600	5230600	this wasn't one of them.
5230600	5233180	So it's been like 10 years until people figured this out.
5233180	5234180	Right?
5234180	5235180	Yeah.
5235180	5238500	I'm just surprised they didn't redump it themselves, but I guess the data would be the same, but
5238500	5240740	the header thing that's kind of interesting.
5240740	5246580	I wonder if it actually uses the header in their emulator or if their emulator is based
5246580	5250780	off of like, you know, one of the NES emulators out there.
5250780	5251780	Hmm.
5251780	5252780	All right.
5252780	5257660	Well, uh, let's see, I gotta get to one more story here and then we'll, uh, give Dark Sakura
5257660	5262780	a call to do our classic console of the week, but, uh, speaking of Zelda and the Wii U,
5262780	5268420	it was confirmed this week that Breath of the Wild will be the last Wii U game and that
5268420	5272140	was confirmed by Reggie Fils-Aime, the man, of course, at Nintendo's America.
5272140	5274580	I'd assume that's the last Nintendo first party, right?
5274580	5275580	Right.
5275580	5278180	From a first party standpoint, there's no new development coming after the launch of
5278180	5279180	Breath of the Wild.
5279180	5280180	Okay.
5280180	5282860	But to be fair, I mean, sure, maybe a third party will put something out, but like even
5282860	5284980	the Indies started jumping ship, right?
5284980	5287420	Everybody's like, nope, we're developing for the Switch now and if you kickstart it on
5287420	5289700	Wii U, we can move that over or whatever.
5289700	5293340	But he also said we really are at the end of life for Wii U.
5293340	5296500	So, um, confirmed that that is, that's it.
5296500	5297500	Pretty sad.
5297580	5298580	Didn't last that long.
5298580	5301980	No, Wii U really didn't last that long, but we kind of, it's not surprising though.
5301980	5305940	Nintendo really wants to shift the conversation, you know, everybody's written off the Wii
5305940	5306940	U at this point.
5306940	5308580	So Nintendo really wants to shift the conversation.
5308580	5313420	They wrote it off because of the underpowered system with underpowered specs that didn't
5313420	5317100	have third party support, kind of like their new system.
5317100	5320860	I mean, so what makes you think that this is not going to fucking be a whole repeat
5320860	5321860	of this thing?
5321860	5326780	Just because, oh, I can take it somewhere and, but when the novelty novelty runs off
5326780	5333540	on that, like it just runs out, I just, I just think they're not learning their lesson
5333540	5334540	is the thing.
5334540	5340220	Well, they, they don't really have a lot of, like if the Switch is a failure, then Nintendo
5340220	5342380	is going to be, I don't know what's going to happen.
5342380	5345740	Put out a heart, put out a console that has some fucking muscle in it.
5345740	5346740	That's what you need to do.
5346740	5349620	You'll, oh, your console's not going to be the cheapest.
5349620	5356260	Big fucking deal if you have the games and the support from third party, it won't matter.
5356260	5360180	You know, something that was posed to me the other day, which I think is worth asking is
5360180	5367020	that what if Nintendo can add a little oomph in that dock because they could sell theoretically
5367020	5371020	a dock that would be capable of 4k and all this other stuff for the system, right?
5371020	5376900	They could do a little bit more of an incremental upgrade a la PlayStation four pro or a project
5376900	5380020	Scorpio, but even cheaper because it would just be the dock.
5380020	5381020	I don't think so.
5381020	5384780	And the reason for that is because I think that the way that it actually interfaces with
5384780	5387220	the dock is it's just outputting.
5387220	5392820	It's basically extending HDMI out from the system and adding a power source.
5392820	5395660	So I don't think that, I have to actually take a look at the system, but I don't think
5395660	5398820	it's like some sort of, you know, new thing.
5398820	5404620	I bet it's just like HDMI out and power in and that's it.
5404620	5408180	You know, it may be something that, it might even not even necessarily be something that
5408180	5409820	tells it it's in the dock mode.
5409820	5414820	That could be just when it receives power from the video signal through the HDMI port
5414820	5419380	that it's, okay, now I'm in portable or docked mode or something like that, but I don't think
5419380	5422360	that they're going to be able to add any extra processing to it.
5422360	5426940	What they probably will do later on down the road is release a system that's 1080p handheld
5426940	5432740	and you know, maybe a little bit beefed up specs or something like they do with all their
5432740	5433740	other systems.
5433740	5439420	It's just, I'm just, I'm very concerned by this.
5439420	5441820	This is one of the reasons I'm very hesitant about the system.
5441820	5446980	It's like, I like the idea of a portable system, but I think I'm just buying into the hype
5446980	5450100	too much and I, I don't know.
5450100	5454940	Well, we will see what happens, but for now I want to get to a segment that we do on the
5454940	5459680	show called the classic game of the week, but what a twist.
5459680	5462220	It's going to be the classic system of the month tonight.
5462220	5467980	We're going to get our good pal Dark Sakura on the line here who's going to take us down
5467980	5472660	the memory lane so we can talk about a classic system of the week.
5472660	5473660	Hi.
5473660	5474660	Hi.
5474660	5476660	How are you?
5476660	5480140	Um, my face hurts.
5480140	5481900	Sorry about your face.
5481900	5482900	We miss you.
5482900	5483900	Me too.
5483900	5484900	Thank you.
5484900	5488900	Um, so I have a sinus infection.
5488900	5489900	Are you wrong?
5489900	5493940	Are we, is Jamie really quiet for you guys or is it just me?
5493940	5494940	I don't know.
5494940	5495940	I'm talking loudly.
5495940	5496940	Oh yeah.
5496940	5497940	I don't know.
5497940	5501260	I mean, for some reason in studio, you're not coming through very loud, but your levels
5501260	5504900	for the folks that are listening at home look like they're just fine.
5504900	5505900	Yeah.
5505900	5506900	So anyway, sorry about that.
5506900	5507900	It's live.
5507900	5508900	What can you do about it?
5508900	5509900	Uh, how has your week been?
5509900	5510900	Jamie?
5510900	5514220	Um, kill it with fire.
5514220	5515220	Sorry to hear that.
5515220	5519980	Um, shall we take a, shall we take a trip down memory lane with the classic console
5519980	5522260	of the week?
5522260	5524540	The classic console of the month.
5524540	5526260	Oh, excuse me.
5526260	5527940	The classic console of the month.
5527940	5529780	What did, what did you pick for us?
5529780	5538620	Uh, it's actually two, but they're related, uh, the FM towns and the FM towns, Marty.
5538620	5539620	All right.
5539620	5541180	The FM towns and the FM towns, Marty.
5541180	5542180	Hold on.
5542180	5544940	I'm getting, I'm getting a little bit of music up here for folks to hear.
5544940	5545940	Sorry.
5545940	5548180	Wasn't expecting you to be that loud.
5548180	5549180	There we go.
5549180	5550180	Okay.
5550180	5552460	It sounds like writing to me.
5552460	5553460	Sure is.
5554460	5563580	Well, the FM town, um, was a computer that was put out by Sujitsu, um, between 1989 and
5563580	5565580	1997.
5565580	5571460	It was meant to be, um, a multimedia and PC, um, gaming machine.
5571460	5578500	Um, in 1993, a gaming console came out called the Marty that was compatible with all the
5578500	5580900	existing FM towns games.
5581340	5588420	So the FM stands for Sujitsu Micro and towns, um, is likely coming from Charlestown to win
5588420	5593340	the 1964 Nobel Prize in system because at the time, Sujitsu was naming all of their
5593340	5596340	PC products after Nobel prize winners.
5596340	5606780	So the computer itself, it was an eight bit computer and, um, it had a lot of, uh, parts
5606780	5607780	supplied by NEC.
5608660	5614540	Um, so you probably will see a lot of crossover for games between that and the PC engine.
5614540	5623740	Um, this one also, one of the specifics with it is that it was really dedicated for, uh,
5623740	5628020	gaming and graphics, uh, uh, applications.
5628020	5634980	It ran on, um, windows three, three one and windows 95, and it had its own OS called town's
5634980	5638100	OS that was based off of, uh, DOS.
5638100	5645460	So, um, most of the games were, uh, written in assembly and C. So that gives you any kind
5645460	5650260	of indicator for, you know, about where it was in comparison to the other things that
5650260	5652180	were out at the time.
5652180	5659780	But, um, it also, um, had a, uh, a CD ROM in 1990.
5659780	5664100	So it was pretty, pretty much ahead of its time for the day.
5664100	5670740	Um, as for, uh, the, the Marty, the Marty actually had different iterations of it.
5670740	5677060	There was, uh, a version that, like I said, came out in 1993 and it was the first 32 bit
5677060	5681620	home video game system had a built-in CD ROM and disk drive.
5681620	5686420	Um, and it was meant to run, like I said, the games that were running on the, um, FM
5686420	5687420	town's PC.
5687420	5695340	There was also the FM town 42 in 1994, um, that was a little bit lower in cost and to
5695340	5698860	play some of the other games that had a faster CPU in it.
5698860	5703340	And another one that's interesting is the FM town, uh, car Marty that was built into
5703340	5707340	cars had, um, a GPS in it.
5707340	5713980	It had, um, uh, the GPS had this audio and video guidance and it could be detached from
5713980	5716440	the car and played at home.
5716440	5722400	So it was, it was pretty crazy for its time and it could run, um, its virtual resolution
5722400	5727280	up as high as, uh, 1024 by 512 back in the day.
5727280	5734320	So as far as games that came out, the systems have a ton of games, um, as you can hear in
5734320	5739200	the background, you know, that's Raiden Densetsu, which is basically just Raiden, um, for anime
5739200	5744760	fans, I had a bunch of the nineties anime games on it, like, uh, Sanzanai's, um, Dragon
5744760	5752440	Half, um, it even included some of the fighting games like Asuka 120%, um, they had Bubble
5752440	5759120	Bobble, uh, Chase HQ, uh, I'm trying to think if there's any more that we would have seen
5759120	5760120	over here.
5760120	5764000	Oh, Emerald Dragon, which I've actually covered before, um, for classic games, uh, God of
5764000	5769680	Gods and Set Special, which was Fatal Fury Special over here, um, all kinds of great
5769680	5770680	games on there.
5770680	5778160	And, uh, even I think the only, maybe the only, um, version of, uh, Traxton 2, so had
5778160	5784520	Puyo Puyo, had all kinds of interesting games, uh, Ravenloft, Return to Zor, uh, a couple
5784520	5790040	of the Logos board games, um, so yeah, it's a great system if you're trying to find one
5790040	5796720	now, they're pretty pricey, but, um, I think that there are emulators out for it, um, and
5796720	5801520	at the time these were pretty much the best versions of a lot of these things you could
5801520	5803920	get at home if you had the system.
5803920	5808000	And so that's your classic system is the FM Towns family.
5808000	5810620	I have to admit, I have never played one, unfortunately.
5810620	5814360	Is this something that exists in the gaming vault that I just have failed to see or is
5814360	5815360	this-
5815360	5818280	No, actually I'd love to have one, but I don't actually own one.
5818280	5819280	Bummer.
5819520	5822920	Alright, y'all, you know what to get Jamie for Hanukkah next year.
5822920	5831640	Well, if I were to check eBay right now, let's see how much one of them costs so I can give
5831640	5836320	you an idea of a couple, you know, how many thousands you're gonna pay for one.
5836320	5839400	Yeah, Kuma JP in the chat says it's too expensive.
5839400	5840880	I've never seen one of those.
5840880	5848280	Uh, JD in chat says I heard about this console because Zach McCracken had a 256 color port.
5848280	5857400	So right now, an FM Towns Marty boxed with image site coming with it is $700 right now.
5857400	5859400	That's pretty pricey for an old ass computer.
5859400	5862040	I found a broken one for $135.
5862040	5863040	Oh yay.
5863040	5867720	And I found one that comes with POPO for right around $500.
5867720	5870560	So that's what you're looking at for the cost.
5870560	5871560	Alright.
5871560	5876480	Well, Jamie, anything else you want to share with the listeners here before we go to break?
5876480	5877960	Um, resist.
5878640	5883640	Alright, um, have a great week, feel better, and we'll see you hopefully back in studio
5883640	5884640	in seven days.
5884640	5885640	See you then.
5885640	5886640	Alright, bye.
5886640	5887640	Bye.
5887640	5892840	There it is, your classic console of the month.
5892840	5895720	With that, we're going to take a quick break, but don't go anywhere, we have plenty more
5895720	5896720	show to come.
5896720	5901640	We're going to talk a little bit when we come back about Super Mario Run, Pokemon Go, but
5901640	5906480	not just, not just handheld stuff, we're also going to talk about Street Fighter.
5906520	5907720	Is there a Street Fighter handheld?
5907720	5910640	I hope not because it's probably not, well, I'm talking about besides like what they did
5910640	5912640	on like the Game Boy and all that stuff.
5912640	5915320	They had Street Fighter 4 3D that was on the 3DS.
5915320	5921240	Yes, I was thinking mobile phone, but I feel like there is, and I'm sure that it sucks.
5921240	5926800	I mean, if Capcom is going to put Mega Man on mobile, you better believe that Street
5926800	5929420	Fighter is probably not about the mobile version of it.
5929420	5935080	So anyway, we are going to take a break and come back with more show, including rapid
5935080	5936080	fire news.
5936080	5941880	Emails and your calls at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype, when we come back with more of Orange
5941880	5942880	Lounge Radio.
5949680	5955360	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight on the 22nd of January, 2017
5955360	5959280	with episode number 673 of our show already in progress.
5959280	5962560	If you're just joining us live, you missed a really fun part A, we were talking about
5962560	5966520	the Switch a little bit, and our pal Matt Baum joined us to talk about playing with
5966520	5967520	Pride.
5967520	5969820	So if you missed the first half of the show, I guess you're just going to have to listen
5969820	5971560	to it on the podcast.
5971560	5975720	Sadly on the podcast feed though, you don't get to take music breaks with us, so you didn't
5975720	5978640	get to hear some of the music from Ninja Gaiden that we were playing during the break here
5978640	5980720	that we were doing live.
5980720	5985360	And did you know, Loki, I can beat Ninja Gaiden one, two, and three straight through without
5985360	5988640	losing a life?
5988640	5989640	That's pretty awesome.
5989640	5993360	Yeah, actually I was sharing some alternative facts with you just then, yes.
5993360	5999160	Sorry, I was too busy and distracted looking at Bobby's little video they posted of him
5999160	6001320	making snow angels out of confetti.
6001320	6005520	Oh, with celebrating the teams going to the Super Bowl?
6005520	6006520	You can imagine I was a bit distracted.
6006520	6007520	No, that's fine, that's fine.
6007520	6011440	I think he actually has been posting on his Twitter, like people have been photoshopping
6011440	6015360	him in that video, but like with other people's faces, it's crazy, I think he's becoming a
6015360	6016360	meme or something.
6016360	6021360	I'm sure he will have lots to share on his own show next week.
6021360	6025840	So even though I'm cracking jokes about Ninja Gaiden, I don't even think I could beat the
6025840	6027300	first one when I was younger.
6027300	6031680	But I feel like I was good at video games when I was younger, like I used to be able
6031680	6036280	to beat stuff like Mega Man 2 that I go back and play now and it's like I keep dying over
6036280	6040120	and over and I don't know if it's just like I've lost the muscle memory of the levels
6040120	6045320	or whatever, but is there some like really hard to beat video game in your past, Loki,
6045320	6050300	that you beat that you're like really proud of, like I beat this video game and I am an
6050300	6053060	awesome gamer for doing so?
6053060	6054060	Um...
6054060	6057120	I don't know...
6057120	6062800	I did finish VVVVVVVVVV, except for one of the things, which was a pain in the ass and
6062800	6067800	I didn't want to do it anymore, but I got almost, I think I finished that.
6067800	6069220	I beat Rygar.
6069220	6073360	That's probably my biggest thing, because you know Rygar, you couldn't fucking save,
6073360	6075360	or it had no password, right?
6075360	6076840	The original Rygar on NES.
6076840	6079280	So it was one of those things where I had to leave it on overnight so I could come back
6079280	6080280	and play it later.
6080280	6083480	And I did, to be fair, I had a little help, I used, I don't know if it was Nintendo Power
6083480	6084480	or some other little guy.
6084480	6085480	Game Genie!
6085480	6090040	No, not that kind of cheating, like a guide, you know, this was obviously a day long before
6090040	6094320	Game Facts, but what we had back then, I think it was like a Nintendo Power or something
6094320	6096860	that had tips for getting through different levels.
6096860	6102240	So yeah, I was able to beat Rygar and heaven forbid if I could play that game for anything
6102240	6103240	now.
6103240	6109320	So anyway, let's see, I'm trying to see if anybody was answering that question over in
6109320	6113240	our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
6113240	6115760	Let's see, darktedsuya says, I was waiting for the punchline.
6115760	6119400	That's in regards to the joke I made there a minute ago.
6119400	6124680	Dungeon Buster says, a speedrunner called Arcus87 on Twitch regularly runs Ninja Gaiden
6124680	6126240	around 12 minutes.
6126240	6128560	His world record is 1142, I think.
6128560	6131160	Wow, that's pretty, that's still pretty impressive.
6131160	6136120	Speaking of world records, we should give a shout out to regular guest and OLR superfan
6136120	6142040	Flaco Jones, who apparently has officially certified the fastest time in PT right now.
6142040	6143560	But I thought he didn't have it recorded.
6143560	6148400	No, he did, he got the Elgato thing, which I thought you gave it to him or Jamie gave
6148400	6149400	it to him.
6149400	6153400	Well, one way or another, probably passed through Shane or something, I don't know,
6153400	6159120	but he got the Elgato and he has, like, it's been certified on the speedrun archive site
6159120	6160120	or something like that.
6160120	6161120	That's cool.
6161160	6165920	And he keeps bidding to try to do one of the Game Stunt Quick marathons, so whenever they
6165920	6168320	let PT in, we'll hopefully see him there.
6168320	6169320	That'll be fun.
6169320	6170320	Yeah.
6170320	6171320	Cheer him on.
6171320	6172320	Anyway.
6172320	6173320	All right.
6173320	6178920	Let's see, Rama says, Bart vs. Space Mutants could not beat it.
6178920	6181480	Well then, if you couldn't beat it, that's not an accomplishment, is it?
6181480	6185480	I remember a game, I'm just messing with you, I remember a game on Super Nintendo I played
6185480	6186960	a lot of that was also very hard.
6186960	6189840	It was Bart's Nightmare?
6189840	6191680	Bart's Scary Nightmare or something about-
6191680	6192680	Bart's Nightmare, yeah.
6192680	6193680	Is that it?
6193680	6196560	And it was, like, you would jump into a page and it was some other, like, mini-game or
6196560	6199560	something, it was weird, weird-ass game.
6199560	6203120	It's weird to think the Simpsons have been around that long, where there were Simpsons
6203120	6207720	games on the Super Nintendo, yet the Simpsons is, like, still a thing that's on TV.
6207720	6209160	Have we had Simpsons games lately?
6209160	6210160	I guess it's on mobile.
6210160	6213920	Yeah, no, they had a console game, remember EA put out that was actually supposed to be
6213920	6214920	pretty good.
6214920	6218000	I just remember that mobile game everybody's playing.
6218000	6219000	Well there's that one too.
6219480	6222520	But, like, there was actually the console game, which was supposed to be pretty good,
6222520	6227760	and they did a Family Guy game, which was, I don't know, Activision did that one, I don't
6227760	6228760	know.
6228760	6232640	Alright, let's do some rapid-fire news, travel around the gaming world and check out some
6232640	6234320	news very quick.
6234320	6237920	Loki, we'll have you do yours and you can do Jamie's as well, if you don't mind.
6237920	6242240	But definitely nothing's gonna compete with the South Park game, which, I think the new
6242240	6243240	one's coming out pretty soon.
6243240	6246160	Yeah, I think it was supposed to be pretty soon, the Fractured But Whole.
6246160	6248400	The Fractured But Whole, yeah.
6248400	6250960	That is something I'm looking forward to.
6250960	6256880	So Final Fantasy XV has been patched and now they've added some additional enhancements
6256880	6258520	to the photographing.
6258520	6263840	So now, not only will you get just the random photographs, but you can actually do your
6263840	6269160	own photographs and set up, you know, custom pictures and stuff like that, so that's kind
6269160	6270160	of cool.
6270160	6276240	They also had some new packs, so they had a Holiday Pack Plus, which was the Moogle
6276240	6283040	Chocobo Carnival that opened the Festival Ensemble costume for Noctis, and the Holiday
6283040	6289760	Pack Plus exclusive photo frames, and then they had, you know, the free version as well,
6289760	6297400	which just gave you the Moogle Chocobo Carnival and a Choco-Mog Tea for Noctis and a Holiday
6297400	6298540	Pack thing.
6298540	6300640	No word on the Gladio side story, though, huh?
6300640	6301840	No, not yet.
6301840	6305720	And then they also had a self-photographing feature that was something that was added
6305720	6310080	that was what I was just talking about, but that was also one of the things that was made
6310080	6311080	available there.
6311080	6312880	I still have yet to go back and play through this.
6312880	6317600	I am just not feeling compelled at all to play through Final Fantasy XV, which is really
6317600	6318600	sad.
6318600	6319600	It's worth it.
6319600	6320600	Even less so than Final Fantasy...
6320600	6324720	What if I had that last one that was Type Zero or whatever?
6324720	6325720	Type Zero.
6325720	6328880	I have no desire to play that.
6328880	6334000	I think XV is worth playing through and you can get through it faster than almost any
6334000	6335520	other Final Fantasy game I can think of.
6335520	6339560	I can't think of any Final Fantasy game that's probably shorter than XV, which I realize
6339560	6342840	is good news and bad news.
6342840	6346640	You can make XV a longer game with all the side quests and the other things there is
6346640	6348820	to do and, of course, there's even more coming.
6348820	6352040	But to get through the base game as it is now would probably take you less time than
6352040	6357380	it would, oh God, like even Final Fantasy VI or V.
6357380	6358640	Maybe IV is just as long.
6358640	6359640	I can't remember.
6359640	6362520	But then again, IV is always shorter.
6362520	6365440	I think it's shorter than it really is because I always forget, like, oh yeah, you have the
6365440	6368920	whole thing where you go underground and there's like half the game there.
6368920	6371640	So yeah, I don't know.
6371640	6373240	You should check it out at some point though, Loki.
6373240	6374240	I guess.
6374240	6375240	Anything else?
6375240	6383880	Yeah, and then, of course, let's see, we had some more backwards compatible games, which
6383880	6384880	is awesome.
6384880	6396000	So, for Xbox One, you're going to have now Tekken 6 and also, what else was there, Mutant
6396000	6402200	Storm Empire and Midway Arcade Origins.
6402200	6404040	So those are three games that are available now.
6404040	6409820	Man, I have the Midway Treasures thing they released on original Xbox, but I don't have
6409820	6411520	the one they did on 360.
6411520	6412520	Boo.
6412520	6413520	Yeah.
6413560	6419400	And then, of course, there was a brief cameo from Overwatch.
6419400	6424920	They had the bunny symbol from D.Va that showed up in one of the pictures from the Women's
6424920	6427760	March that happened yesterday.
6427760	6432000	And, you know, to be fair, there were a lot of, I don't know if you saw some of the clever
6432000	6435620	signs that were out there, but there were a lot of very clever done signs that were
6435620	6436620	at the mark.
6436620	6440780	God, there was, what, two million people out there yesterday, just tons and tons of people,
6440780	6442980	and all with very, you know, sassy signs.
6442980	6447220	And there was a lot of pop culture references in the signs, like, just lots.
6447220	6450580	So it's pretty cool that, like, gaming is represented there as well, but, you know,
6450580	6456220	the fact that this was also the Korea Women's March, you know, I hear D.Va's a very, very,
6456220	6460980	very popular character over there, you know, because she is also the Korean representation
6460980	6465860	in the game, but, yeah, pretty cool.
6465860	6466860	Let's see.
6466860	6471140	Also, speaking of Overwatch, there are some new skins coming to the game.
6471140	6474720	The Year of the Rooster event is going to be coming to Overwatch.
6474720	6481700	It starts on January 24th and maybe runs through the 31st, and nothing official has been confirmed
6481700	6486020	as far as what the dates are that it will be running, but apparently some image leaked
6486020	6488220	out of China, and that's where people are getting it from.
6488220	6493660	Now, Blizzard teased some images of the Lunar New Year event, including some new skins for
6493660	6497220	Mei and D.Va, that actually look really, really cool, I gotta say.
6497420	6502580	Some of the images that leaked from this picture from China that was on Reddit, there's also
6502580	6507780	going to be skins for Zenyatta, Winston, Roadhog, and Reinhardt, and who knows, maybe even more
6507780	6511140	that aren't showing up on some of the publicity photos.
6511140	6517180	A week seems pretty short for an Overwatch event, so I imagine those loot boxes, you're
6517180	6521380	going to want to try to get those fast and furious, hopefully the Arcade mode will help
6521380	6525700	you earn a few more, but if not, I'm sure Blizzard will be more than happy to take your
6525700	6531620	money to open up more loot boxes where you might get one of these skins.
6531620	6533980	So there you go.
6533980	6538380	Check that out in Overwatch, starting in this next week.
6538380	6543340	Metroid, of course, always forever in our hearts, even though Nintendo doesn't seem
6543340	6545340	to do anything official for it.
6545340	6549380	Even though Nintendo won't do anything official, that does not stop the fan community.
6549380	6553400	That's right, there is yet another fan game that's been released.
6553400	6557300	It's a prequel fan game called Metroid Rogue Dawn.
6557300	6562040	It is set before Zero Mission, and it's a mission that is mentioned in the original
6562040	6566680	Metroid game manual, and that's really all it is.
6566680	6569040	So it's not a ROM hack or anything like that.
6569040	6573900	It does use the original engine though, but apparently the team that created this rebuilt
6573900	6577880	the assets and made original music for the game.
6577880	6579520	So anyhow, that is out there now.
6579520	6585000	You can check that out at ROMhacking.net, it's actually hosting the Metroid Rogue Dawn
6585000	6586000	ROM.
6586000	6589920	I'm sure it's just a matter of time until there is a cease and desist letter placed
6589920	6590920	on this game.
6590920	6593560	So is that actually like an NES ROM?
6593560	6594560	I believe so.
6594560	6600720	So that would be awesome to stick that kind of stuff onto the NES classic thing, those
6600720	6601920	nice ROM hacks.
6601920	6606440	Speaking of ROM hacks, one thing I forgot to mention is, this is kind of file this under
6606440	6609200	that, well, because I can type thing.
6609200	6614920	Somebody has made Bubsy a playable character in Streets of Rage 2.
6614920	6615920	Why?
6615920	6617920	Because they can.
6617920	6618920	Because it's silly.
6618920	6623520	Yes, that's right, so you can actually get that ROM as well.
6623520	6630080	They have that available via ROMhacking.net, so go check that out.
6630080	6638000	But yeah, he's got his own title animation and physics, and he's replacing Max Thunder.
6638000	6639640	I think it looks silly.
6639640	6640640	Why not?
6640640	6642760	I need to see this in motion, it sounds hilarious.
6642760	6643760	It's pretty awesome.
6643760	6646240	They've got a little animation from it.
6646240	6650160	Alright, that's it for rapid fire news, so let's travel around the world and check out
6650160	6654040	what's coming out in stores this week, starting with the US, Loki.
6654040	6657720	Oh goodness, I'm totally unprepared.
6657720	6663600	Let's see, well, I believe, isn't this the week for Resident Evil?
6663600	6664960	I think you're right.
6664960	6670480	Yeah, so Resident Evil 7 is going to be coming out on Xbox One and PlayStation 4.
6670480	6674800	That would also include PlayStation VR as well.
6674800	6677920	I don't think there's much else coming out here.
6677920	6678920	Let's see.
6678920	6679920	Open.
6679920	6680920	Dammit.
6680920	6681920	Okay.
6681920	6687600	And then, what else do we have here, so...
6687600	6690320	One second here.
6690320	6692120	Links we get are for 2016.
6692120	6694920	Uh oh, oh, we need to update that, sorry about that.
6694920	6700280	Yeah, it just keeps it for like September 2016 or something like that.
6700280	6702640	Okay, there we go.
6702640	6706960	Other things that are going to be coming out as well.
6706960	6711680	Let's see, we've got Tales of Berseria.
6711680	6714440	Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, I forgot there was another Tales game.
6714440	6721600	That's going to be coming out on PC, PlayStation 4, Yakuza 0 on PlayStation 4, and then Memoranda
6721600	6728920	on PC, Mac, and Linux, The Wardrobe on PC, Mac, and Linux, TwinStar Exorcist on Vita,
6728920	6736720	Disgaea 2 is being ported to PC, and Double Dragon 4, that's coming out on PC and PlayStation
6736720	6737720	4.
6737720	6738720	Oh wow.
6738720	6745120	Yep, Digimon World Next Order on PlayStation 4, Divide on PlayStation 4, Dynasty Warriors
6745120	6754400	God Seekers on PlayStation 4 and Vita, and I believe that's it, let me just take a look
6754400	6757040	at my calendar here.
6757040	6758040	Just making sure.
6758040	6760000	Um, yeah, that's it.
6760000	6764320	Alright, then let's travel over to Japan and check out some of the releases there.
6764320	6770460	Biohazard 7, Resident Evil also gets its release in Japan this week, so it's kind of a worldwide
6770460	6773260	release of sorts, that's out on the 26th of January.
6773300	6777100	There's also some more games on the PlayStation 4, New Game, the Challenge Stage in regular
6777100	6783660	and limited edition, Momotouji Taisen Oryoku 3 in regular and limited edition, and Oh no
6783660	6788740	Katana no 4-Rhythm HD Edition in regular and limited edition.
6788740	6791180	There's lots of limited editions in Japan.
6791180	6796440	Also on the Vita, the Momotouji Taisen Oryoku 3 is also released on the Vita, as well as
6796440	6804640	Shinsei Bateki Drive Girls, Black Wolves Saga Wiege und Schwarz is out there, throw a German
6804640	6808920	name in the Japanese releases, that is also out in Japan this week on the Vita, and the
6808920	6812040	New Game Challenge Stage there as well.
6812040	6817920	One other game too, Uta no Prince Sama Repeat Love, you can get that in a regular love box
6817920	6822120	or princess box, if you so desire.
6822120	6826280	Checking out quickly the 3DS, nothing this week on the 3DS, I think things are slowing
6826280	6831020	down on that system over there, so there's really not a lot else to mention in Japan.
6831020	6838960	We could talk about the UK though, the UK has some releases coming out there, which,
6838960	6839960	what do we have on the...
6839960	6842480	Resident Evil and Sniper Ghost Warrior it looks like.
6842480	6843480	Is that it?
6843480	6844640	Yeah, that looks like it.
6844640	6850840	Just Resident Evil and Sniper, Ghost Warrior, on the Vita this, or excuse me, in Europe
6850840	6855880	this week, not on the Vita, but on the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.
6855880	6860320	It's about time to get to the mailbag, let's get to it.
6860320	6866360	Every week you guys email us, participate at orangeloungeradio.com, and we open up the
6866360	6871080	email bag, dive in, and pull out emails to read here on the show.
6871080	6875800	Usually Dark Sakura would do this, but since she's not here, I will fill in tonight.
6875800	6880280	So we're gonna start with this email from Asfer, who actually had sent this a couple
6880280	6885120	weeks ago, but I think we lost it in the mix up with the mailbag last week, so oops, sorry
6885120	6887880	about that, but we're gonna read it now.
6887880	6892240	Who says, hello again, this email is in response to a question Rob asked me on the previous
6892240	6893240	episode.
6893240	6897360	He wanted to know which Final Fantasy came out when I was 12, as Bobby Blackwolf's statement
6897360	6901360	is that a game typically will be a person's favorite Final Fantasy.
6901360	6906080	To preface this, I mentioned that while I have fond feelings for 9, Final Fantasy X
6906080	6909880	is my favorite, and one of my all-time favorite video games in general.
6909880	6915080	So I'm 27 years old, my birthday is in October, so that means I would have been, well, shit.
6915080	6921520	I was 12 at the time Final Fantasy X released on December 17th, 2001, damn it Bobby!
6921520	6924020	Final Fantasy X was the first game I ever played in the series.
6924020	6927760	I was introduced to it at a friend's house, and I was instantly captivated by the story,
6927760	6930480	characters, and the conditional turn-based battle system.
6930480	6933920	I remember after watching him play, I asked him to bring it over to my house on his next
6933920	6934920	visit.
6934920	6937000	That night, I stayed up past 7am playing this game.
6937000	6940360	I'd fallen in love with the world of Spira, and I couldn't wait to see what turns the
6940360	6944120	story would take next, and how our characters would deal with a force as unstoppable as
6944160	6945160	sin.
6945160	6948200	Damn, just thinking about it, I really wish Final Fantasy would return to a turn-based
6948200	6949200	battle system.
6949200	6953380	I like the conditional system that showed the order of attacks in X as opposed to the
6953380	6957920	active time battle system in 7, but even as that system was still very fun.
6957920	6959480	That brings up my question for you.
6959480	6963760	Do you like XV's approach on a more Kingdom Hearts-like battle system, or would you appreciate
6963760	6966400	the next Final Fantasy be more of a return to form and be turn-based?
6966400	6971260	Personally, while I enjoy XV, the battle system just doesn't feel like a Final Fantasy game
6971260	6972260	to me anymore.
6972260	6973480	Thanks for reading, Asfer.
6974120	6980040	Well, keep in mind, you can put Final Fantasy XV's battle system in what's called Wait
6980040	6983280	Mode, which does feel a little more traditional.
6983280	6985180	I actually don't prefer it.
6985180	6989960	I prefer the regular battle system that is not in Wait Mode.
6989960	6992540	I do think the game feels fine like that.
6992540	6996560	It is a little jarring, and I think when I first reviewed Final Fantasy XV on this show,
6996560	7001740	I kind of called it out as, this feels more like a spin-off game, which is what it started
7001740	7004560	out as, than it does a mainline Final Fantasy game.
7004560	7005560	That's not necessarily bad.
7005560	7008180	I mean, spin-off games can still be great games, right?
7008180	7009180	10-2, right?
7009180	7011180	It was pretty good, right?
7011180	7016500	But the interesting thing about your question is that I do feel like the turn-based Final
7016500	7020320	Fantasy thing is now relegated to the side games.
7020320	7022940	Like the mobile games have a lot of the turn-based stuff.
7022940	7023940	See, I like that.
7023940	7026820	I don't, I mean, I like the old battle systems.
7026820	7027820	I do too.
7027820	7030500	I didn't think there was really anything wrong with them.
7030500	7034660	Most people said that they got bored with them, and I mean, I don't know, it's just,
7034660	7038260	this battle system would be good for like another type of game.
7038260	7039260	Maybe not this.
7039260	7041260	I just don't, I don't know.
7041260	7045860	World of Final Fantasy, also a very recent side story game, also a turn-based battle
7045860	7047140	system in that game.
7047140	7051860	So I feel like if maybe that, and actually the whole like order of who goes when and
7051860	7053740	all that, actually it's different.
7053740	7058660	It uses a more like progressive time bar type thing, but I think you'd, as a 10 fan, you'd
7058660	7059740	find it acceptable.
7059740	7061620	That actually exists in World of Final Fantasy.
7061620	7065940	So I might actually encourage you, check out World of Final Fantasy because that might
7065940	7067300	be what you're looking for.
7067300	7070220	There are some other weird limitations in World of Final Fantasy, obviously the whole
7070220	7074480	like monster collecting and building the stacks, but you have to kind of build the right stacks
7074480	7075540	to get the most effective stuff.
7075540	7077180	I mean, there are some other complications of that.
7077180	7081740	It's not just like a quote unquote simple Final Fantasy game, like 10 was to kind of
7081740	7082740	just get into.
7082740	7087300	But I even think I said this as well when I first reviewed 15, I would really love it
7087300	7094500	if Final Fantasy 16 was a return to a 10 style game or a nine style game, something
7094500	7097540	that's the more traditional Final Fantasy.
7097540	7102740	It's almost like 15 they just tried too many different things and like...
7102740	7106500	But in 1500 was what I was going to say was about 16, what I'd like to see.
7106500	7107500	Yeah.
7107500	7110580	It's just like, I don't know, it just seems like, Oh, Hey, let's add these photo mode
7110580	7111580	in there and stuff.
7111580	7114380	It's like, okay, that's kind of unnecessary.
7114380	7118580	I mean, I know people like that kind of stuff, but it's kind of unnecessary.
7118580	7120940	But here's the weird thing about all that.
7120940	7125120	The newer Final Fantasy game in the retro setting with the pretty graphics and everything,
7125120	7127260	that's actually Final Fantasy 14.
7127260	7132380	And I think Final Fantasy 14 delivers on a lot of things that Final Fantasy fans will
7132380	7133380	be into.
7133380	7136540	But I completely understand a lot of people are turned off to it because it's MMO monthly
7136540	7137540	fee.
7137540	7143380	They're not interested, but I, you know, don't write off 14 because it's a fucking marvelous.
7143380	7148220	I mean, when I was playing Final Fantasy 14 this week, I finally wrapped up the story
7148220	7154700	for the last patch, the 3.4 patch, which was Soul Surrender, I think was the subtitle of
7154700	7155700	that.
7155700	7156700	Or is that the new patch?
7156700	7159900	I can't remember my patch names anymore, but I wrapped up the storyline in that patch and
7159900	7162100	it was so good.
7162100	7165860	Like Oh my God, at the end of it, I was just like, wow, that was like the twist they kind
7165860	7169000	of did with it was really good.
7169000	7171620	So yeah, I was really jazzed about it.
7171620	7175780	And I kind of realized, you know, I've said this about Final Fantasy Heavensward, like
7175780	7180780	the Final Fantasy Heavensward story before, so just the 3.0 story without getting into
7180780	7183380	any of the patches or whatever.
7183380	7190260	It is the best Final Fantasy story for me since like six, like it's so fucking good.
7190260	7194620	And I know many Final Fantasy fans will never play it because again, it's an MMO.
7194620	7200180	So I wish there was a way Square Enix could figure out a way to make 14.
7200180	7206100	I mean, then I guess it wouldn't really be 14, like do a free version, do the base game
7206100	7211220	for free or something and have just like NPCs you can play with or something.
7211220	7212220	I don't know.
7212220	7214380	I just, I really wish they'd figure a way to do that out.
7214380	7219180	But yeah, I think 14 is really, really good if you're a Final Fantasy fan.
7219180	7221800	The other thing I want to say with 14, which I thought was interesting, they did talk about,
7221800	7223300	you know, they've got another expansion.
7223300	7224940	So this is, they're ramping down.
7224940	7230140	This is the last or the, they're doing a two-part patch to wrap up Heavensward, the last expansion,
7230140	7231140	right?
7231140	7233460	We got the first part and then the second part's coming, I think in March.
7233460	7236820	And then in June, Stormblood, the new expansion is coming.
7236820	7241660	But this is something interesting Final Fantasy is doing as opposed to World of Warcraft.
7241660	7248040	Instead of bundling in Heavensward, the previous expansion with the base game, they're still
7248040	7252100	going to continue to sell Realm Reborn, the base game, the way that it is, but they're
7252100	7255580	bundling in Heavensward with Stormblood.
7255580	7259820	So if you buy Stormblood, you're essentially, essentially buying all expansions to catch
7259820	7261540	you up, which I think is interesting.
7261540	7263220	So why would you just play the base game though?
7263220	7266620	Well, I think the base game is there for people to try it out and see if they like it.
7266620	7270460	I guess because it's so inexpensive, like on these sales, it's like down below 10 bucks.
7270460	7271460	Oh yeah.
7271460	7272460	I don't know.
7272460	7273460	For sure.
7273460	7274460	For sure.
7274460	7278180	Anyway, that's my thoughts on Final Fantasy and all that stuff.
7278180	7283500	I think, I think 15, it seems like it's done well enough where we will see a Final Fantasy
7283500	7285900	16, but God, who knows when?
7285900	7289020	I mean, we still got that seven remake to get through first, right?
7289020	7292420	Do you think Square would be bold enough to do a Final Fantasy 16 trailer at this year's
7292420	7293420	E3?
7293420	7294420	No.
7294420	7295420	I don't know.
7295420	7300620	Anyway, next email is from Red the Haze who emails us and says, hey y'all, long time listener
7300620	7304260	here for, oh my gosh, 10, maybe 11 years this year.
7304260	7305260	Wow.
7305260	7306260	That's some dedication.
7306260	7307260	Thank you so much.
7307340	7308340	I realized it now.
7308340	7313540	Well, I just wanted to send an email to congratulate Sky and Alan on their union and I wanted to
7313540	7315140	thank you very much for that.
7315140	7319380	And I wanted to thank Sky, Dark Sakura, Loki, and everyone involved, including guests and
7319380	7324900	the audience for the decade of great entertainment, more power to y'all and best wishes.
7324900	7325900	Thank you so much.
7325900	7326900	Red the Haze.
7326900	7327900	Well, thank you.
7327900	7328900	Thank you for that email.
7328900	7329900	Not even a question or anything.
7329900	7331540	Just a positive pat on the ass.
7331540	7332540	Thank you.
7332540	7333540	I appreciate that.
7333540	7335340	Thank you for the well wishes on the wedding.
7335340	7337020	I really, really appreciate that.
7337780	7342580	One more email tonight from, uh, our good old friend, Raginator.
7342580	7347260	Hi, Robin, Loki, who, who, who knew that Dark Sakura wasn't here tonight.
7347260	7349940	So he must've wrote this through the first part of the show.
7349940	7353780	Uh, anyway, I'd like to bring up a new question to your, to you folks.
7353780	7357260	I'm sure that the two of you, as well as most of the listeners know of at least one or two
7357260	7360820	people in their lives that is more or less anti video games.
7360820	7364140	They themselves refuse to play them and won't let their kids play them.
7364140	7367900	It may be part due to the stereotype that nerds play games and they immediately go to
7367900	7372420	the Revenge of the Nerds portrayal of nerds, or they possibly want to focus solely on psychic
7372420	7375300	activity or excuse me, physical activity.
7375300	7379540	Even if it only amounts to spinning in circles, literally all that being said, what would
7379540	7381740	you say to those notions?
7381740	7384060	And Raginator continues here and we'll answer the questions.
7384060	7386860	For me, I'll say this I'm all for physical activity.
7386860	7389740	God only knows I used to be on my high school's wrestling and football teams.
7389740	7391820	Granted, I sucked at sports, but I digress.
7391820	7395460	No one in their right mind will detract from physical exercise, but mental exercise is
7395460	7398020	equally important and video games provide that.
7398020	7401800	Perhaps this is an oversimplification, but video games help develop reasoning skills
7401800	7403300	amongst other things.
7403300	7407780	Essentially all games say to the player, this is the scenario, this is your goal, and this
7407780	7410700	is the tools or mechanics at your disposal, go.
7410700	7415420	It's been shown that keeping mentally active will help stave off dementia and other issues.
7415420	7419380	Also on a more personal note, I found that gaming helps dramatically with my PTSD and
7419380	7423660	major depressive disorder, keeping my symptoms 97% or so at bay.
7423660	7427620	In terms of the stereotype, I'm not exactly sure what to say about that though.
7427620	7429820	And that is from Raginator.
7429820	7434340	So what do you think of the notions that video games, just somebody in your life hates them?
7434340	7435340	Oh, that would be your wife.
7435340	7439420	That would be my wife, except that she likes certain video games.
7439420	7442420	So that's not totally true, not totally true.
7442420	7447240	But yeah, I mean, she didn't want our kids playing video games a lot and then the kids
7447240	7451040	started annoying the shit out of her and now she's just like, just go do something
7451040	7452040	else.
7452040	7453640	I don't care what you're doing, which includes video games.
7453640	7457400	Well, here's the thing, Raginator, if I'm not mistaken, based on your calls to the show
7457400	7460720	previously, I believe you're in your thirties and you're kind of close to our age.
7460720	7463880	And I think the answer to this question has shifted a lot.
7463880	7467540	I think when we were growing up, you know, when we were around the Nintendo and the Super
7467540	7472760	Nintendo and all that stuff, I think our parents didn't have that growing up.
7472760	7479680	So it was something weird and unknown and they only knew what they saw about it on TV
7479680	7481680	or whatever.
7481680	7486040	Especially in the nineties when Mortal Kombat happened and the whole violent video games
7486040	7491380	that even went before Congress at one point and that ultimately developed in the rating
7491380	7495420	system that we have for video games today because the video game industry had the police
7495420	7498320	itself before the government did it for them, right?
7498320	7500560	So all that stuff was crazy in the media.
7500560	7505120	And so I think for that reason, video games got a certain like stereotype or stigma.
7505120	7509280	But Raginator, I really think things are kind of different now because a lot of the people
7509280	7515340	that have kids that are, you know, nine years old, 12 years old, whatever, they grew up
7515340	7516640	with video games.
7516640	7518140	So I mean, like, look at Loki.
7518140	7519560	He's a parent.
7519560	7524560	Loki grew up with video games and you have, I can never remember Josh's age, five, six,
7524560	7526240	five, six years old.
7526240	7529040	But Josh is able to play a healthy amount of Minecraft, right?
7529720	7531440	He plays an unhealthy amount of Minecraft.
7531440	7532440	It's more like watches.
7532440	7538200	He will watch videos as long as we'll let him watch videos and like anytime that there's
7538200	7543160	screens on, he'll just like kind of gravitate towards them like anything.
7543160	7544640	But you and, that sounds like me as a kid.
7544640	7547920	And he won't shut up about Minecraft like all the time.
7547920	7552520	You and Nelly, that's as parents, you guys police that what games he should play and
7552520	7554600	how long he gets to play them and all that stuff.
7554600	7559480	But you have the benefit of knowing basic stuff about video games that you kind of know
7559480	7560820	like the ins and outs, right?
7560820	7561820	You know that it's not going to...
7561820	7566280	He still watches YouTubers and YouTubers tend to swear and then they play like violent video
7566280	7567280	games on there and stuff.
7567280	7569840	I was gonna say, do you let your kid play violent games?
7569840	7572840	Uh, you know, he doesn't only, he only plays Minecraft.
7572840	7575160	He only has the Wii U that he plays on.
7575160	7578000	So it's basically Minecraft.
7578000	7580360	That's really all he plays on is just Minecraft.
7580360	7583720	And then, he had Mario Kart 8 on there.
7583720	7585520	He will play Mario Kart 8 sometimes.
7585520	7587160	He hasn't really played it in a while.
7587160	7588700	And Smash is on there.
7588700	7591700	So he'll play Smash.
7591700	7593240	But he's not really interested in that.
7593240	7594240	It's mostly Minecraft.
7594240	7600240	And then he watches Minecraft mod videos from either PopularMMOs or DanTDM.
7600240	7601680	That's his favorite YouTubers.
7601680	7604960	But anyway, it's one of those things where it's like, again, I think the public perception
7604960	7605960	has shifted a lot.
7605960	7609680	And the people that are still anti-video games are the people that are our parents' age.
7609680	7610680	You know, boomers.
7610680	7612520	You know, people in their, you know, depending on-
7612520	7613520	Which is weird.
7613520	7615600	Like, my dad's like so anti-video games.
7615600	7619920	Yeah, he had like a fucking collection of ColecoVision games, like 47 games.
7619920	7622120	But like, he bought me like a Nintendo.
7622120	7623760	He bought me a Texas Ocean's Things.
7623760	7626200	I'm like, you are a fucking gamer.
7626200	7628200	You have 47 fucking games.
7628200	7630500	That is, that's more than just a few.
7630500	7633120	There's just generational differences.
7633120	7637760	And that's why we have these silly labels like boomers, like Gen X, like millennials
7637760	7638760	and all this stuff.
7638760	7641920	Because there are just things in society that change generation to generation.
7641920	7647560	I mean, look back at some of the stuff that was cool when your parents were younger.
7647560	7652880	Like they used to think sitting on flag poles was cool and swallowing goldfish whole, right?
7652880	7653960	Pet rocks.
7653960	7656520	Can anyone ever explain the pet rock thing to me?
7656520	7659800	That's just, you know, but then at the same time, you look at what some of the kids today
7659800	7662960	are doing and it's like, you know, now I'm starting to feel like that old man, like,
7662960	7665960	you know, like, who thinks planking is funny?
7665960	7666960	It's just-
7666960	7667960	It's not funny anymore.
7667960	7668960	Exactly.
7668960	7669960	It's a fad.
7669960	7670960	There's just, yeah, exactly.
7670960	7671960	There's certain trends or whatever.
7671960	7675440	But the one other thing I want to point to is look at the sales of the classic NES and
7675440	7679360	how Nintendo like grossly underestimated how many that was going to sell.
7679360	7683360	If you want to believe that line, I'll leave that to you.
7683360	7688920	They really underestimated how many moms and dads wanted these, not just for themselves,
7688920	7692760	but to play with their kids, to introduce their kids to the same games that they were
7692760	7693760	playing.
7693760	7697760	A lot of kids, even though the technology's dated or whatever, a lot of kids are really
7697760	7698760	eating this classic stuff up.
7698760	7702440	Yeah, my kids always call anything that they see that's 8-bit Minecraft.
7702440	7704360	They're all, that game looks like Minecraft.
7704360	7709200	I'm like, no, that's just how games used to look.
7709200	7712520	And Rage Leader says in our chat room, he's there in the chat room clarifying, the thing
7712520	7716040	is, I know people within our own age group that are anti-video games, not just the baby
7716040	7717160	boomer generation.
7717160	7718160	And that's fair.
7718160	7723280	You know, people are just going to- people are going to be raised the way they were raised
7723280	7724280	sometimes.
7724280	7726960	So there's probably going to be people that still carry that.
7726960	7730800	Sorry, my wife thinks I look weird with a VR headset on, and eventually that's going
7730800	7732000	to be a norm.
7732000	7740220	In my opinion, though, if you watch movies, if you play Dungeons and Dragons, although
7740220	7744600	I suppose that gets a lot of negative stigma sometimes as well, but if you do all that,
7744600	7746360	why can't you play video games?
7746360	7749720	Video games are not that different from movies to me.
7749720	7750720	So anyway.
7750720	7751720	All right.
7751720	7752720	Let's see.
7752720	7759880	I'm going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com and let's see.
7759880	7760880	Where is it?
7760880	7763720	Kaijuta says new pet rock is that hatchling thing.
7763720	7764720	I don't even know.
7764720	7765720	What's a hatchling thing?
7765720	7768800	Isn't that that popular present or whatever it is?
7768800	7769800	I don't know.
7769800	7770800	It sounds stupid.
7770800	7771800	It sounds like a new pet.
7771800	7775800	It was a Christmas present or something, right?
7775800	7776800	Yeah.
7776800	7780520	It was a must have thing that other than the classic NES was the hatchling or whatever.
7780520	7783520	Isn't that just like that candy that's banned here in America?
7783520	7784520	That's in other countries.
7784520	7785520	Poor Loco.
7785520	7786520	No, no, no, no.
7786520	7787520	Come on.
7787520	7788520	I'm talking about...
7788520	7789520	Kinder eggs.
7789520	7790520	What's the name of that Alan?
7790520	7791520	Kinder eggs.
7791520	7792520	Thank you, Alan.
7792520	7793520	Alan knew the name of it.
7793520	7794520	Kinder egg.
7794520	7795520	You could like, it was like a chocolate or something.
7795520	7797720	There's like a prize in the middle and they were afraid that kids here would choke on
7797720	7798720	it.
7798720	7800920	Well, these are, yeah.
7800920	7801920	All right.
7801920	7802920	Thank you.
7802920	7803920	Wow.
7803920	7804920	Chat room knows their shit.
7804920	7805920	Kinder eggs.
7806040	7808040	And that's it for emails.
7808040	7814920	If you guys want to send us an email for a future week, participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
7814920	7819480	But meanwhile, we have some more news to get into, starting with Loki.
7819480	7824200	So Super Mario Brothers Run, I know it's coming to Android soon because they have that stupid
7824200	7829640	pre-order thing or pre-register, pre-notifier, whatever the fuck it is.
7829640	7834280	Some stupid equivalent of pre-ordering for a mobile device, which doesn't make any goddamn
7834280	7835280	sense.
7835640	7842360	Nintendo announced that Super Mario Run will be coming out in March on Android and you
7842360	7846720	can, like I said, you can register for updates regarding that on Google Play Store.
7846720	7849360	I will never do that because I don't fucking care.
7849360	7850800	Like, it's not going to do it.
7850800	7853080	If you have a Twitter account, you'll know when the game's out.
7853080	7854080	Exactly.
7854080	7855080	Who cares?
7855080	7860440	Just, you'll know when it's supposed to come out and you'll check it out if you want to.
7860440	7863240	I may check out the free version of the game or not.
7863240	7864240	I really don't.
7865200	7867200	It's not something that looks interesting to me.
7867200	7871840	I, you know, again, the $10 I spent on Super Mario Run, I kind of regret.
7871840	7872840	I'm just saying.
7872840	7876360	So, you know, and I, there's some people out there that strongly disagree with me and that's
7876360	7878040	fine.
7878040	7879440	That's just my personal opinion.
7879440	7881040	All right.
7881040	7887040	Well, let's talk about Pokemon Go and then maybe, Loki, you want to pick up our story.
7887040	7889960	So Pokemon Go, still going strong.
7889960	7892160	I just hit level 26 of Pokemon Go not that long ago.
7892160	7893960	I haven't really been playing it that much.
7894680	7895680	Very little.
7895680	7899560	I've been trying to do more walking, especially on, like, my lunch breaks and I love that
7899560	7901640	little Pokemon Go Plus.
7901640	7903880	It really is incentive because I try to hatch eggs.
7903880	7907800	Are those easier to find nowadays or are they still, like, super hard to find?
7907800	7910840	I don't think they are easy to find still.
7910840	7912320	Because that's a Nintendo product.
7912320	7913960	Go fig that it's hard to find.
7913960	7918960	Yeah, because they can never estimate, you know, possible consumer wants.
7918960	7923280	Well, Pokemon Go, you know, despite all the stories that say it's dead or whatever, it
7923280	7924600	made a shit ton of money.
7924600	7931560	I mean, the research firm App Annie has estimated that for 2006, Pokemon Go made a shit ton
7931560	7932560	of money.
7932560	7933800	That's actually published on the site.
7933800	7934800	Shit ton.
7934800	7935800	No, it isn't.
7935800	7936800	It says 950 million.
7936800	7937800	But that is a shit ton of money.
7937800	7939280	That's almost a billion dollars.
7939280	7944780	So, and that's, see, that's the one downside to the fact that I do walk is that I always
7944780	7950440	need those fucking incubators and so I keep spending money on incubators and I have had
7950440	7951920	to, like, tell myself to stop.
7951920	7954560	And, like, I finally got smart.
7954560	7960460	I use my infinite incubator for all my 2K eggs because you can hatch more that way.
7960460	7965840	And I will only use the pay ones for the 10K and sometimes the 5K just depending on what's
7965840	7966840	in my inventory.
7966840	7967900	So I have to buy less of them.
7967900	7972520	But I never use a pay incubator anymore for 2K because I just, I walk too much for it.
7972520	7980540	So anyway, so yeah, that is only behind Monster Strike and Clash Royale for how much money
7980540	7981540	it made.
7981580	7983500	It launched in July.
7983500	7990380	So there is a Pokemon Go update that came out recently that also fixes GPS drift apparently.
7990380	7994140	I haven't really noticed the change that much but I didn't really have a horrible problem
7994140	7995900	with this to begin with.
7995900	7999220	So yeah, the GPS drift apparently was fixed in this most recent patch.
7999220	8002020	Don't be nice if they fix that shit in Ingress.
8002020	8005940	You can also, apparently it will show eggs that have been collected from PokeStops on
8005940	8008900	the Apple Watch and some minor text fixes.
8008940	8012020	But no word yet on Gen 2 unfortunately.
8012020	8013980	We still don't have anything outside the eggs hatching.
8013980	8020860	But I finally got my last Pokemon from Gen 2, Magmar was the last one I needed.
8020860	8023280	And I got it this week, yay!
8023280	8029100	So now I have all the Gen, I even evolved all the, I got like 3 Togepies out of eggs
8029100	8032500	and I evolved it into a Togek or whatever it's called.
8032500	8035740	So I have like all the Gen 2 you can get in the game right now.
8035740	8037220	I still don't even have all the Gen 1.
8037660	8039020	Need to find some more farms.
8040020	8042460	Anyhow, what else Loki?
8042460	8048540	So Capcom is planning on more Street Fighter.
8048540	8049700	So they're going to have some more announcements.
8049700	8055200	They're going to be coming out around E3 and San Diego Comic Con.
8055200	8058220	No words exactly on what it's going to be.
8058220	8061820	But more updates for Street Fighter 5 or something.
8061820	8066940	One thing that he said though, unfortunately Rival Schools, there's no plans for anything
8066940	8067940	regarding that.
8067940	8072100	I guess they said despite some Easter eggs that were in Dead Rising 4, there's a game
8072100	8076420	I haven't played in a while, Dead Rising.
8076420	8078020	So I guess we'll have to wait and see.
8078020	8083100	I know that they have the Street Fighter 2 game, Ultra Street Fighter 2, the final challengers
8083100	8084220	that's supposed to be coming out.
8084220	8088580	Maybe part of that, maybe they're going to put in, because I know Evil Ryu I think is
8088580	8094020	probably in Street Fighter 5 already, but maybe like Violent Ken.
8094820	8098980	I wish there was a little something else, like maybe one more character in Ultra Street
8098980	8103700	Fighter 2 that wasn't just a reskin, but I also maybe understand the fact that Street
8103700	8109300	Fighter 2 was kind of done a long time ago, so maybe they don't want to throw off that
8109300	8116740	whole balance by introducing another new character into a game that's literally 20 years old
8116740	8117740	at this point.
8117740	8118740	I guess.
8118740	8119740	I don't know.
8119740	8120740	Whatever.
8120740	8121740	Stop remaking it then.
8121740	8124500	If you want to do that, then make a new game.
8124500	8127220	I just, I don't know.
8127220	8128220	Lame.
8128220	8134540	Alright, so apparently the next Game Developers Conference, we know that Tim Sweeney is going
8134540	8138380	to receive a lifetime achievement award, which is pretty awesome.
8138380	8143460	Tim Sweeney of course, founder of Epic Games, created ZZT.
8143460	8144460	Yeah?
8144460	8145460	Yes!
8145460	8146460	ZZT?
8146460	8149060	There's a game that I'd love to see it come back.
8149060	8152660	Some new ZZT.
8152660	8153660	And no other games.
8153660	8161380	Of course he helped develop Unreal, Gears of War, Unreal Engine, and I guess the Game
8161380	8167580	Developers Choice Awards will be on Wednesday, March 1st from 6.30 to 8.30 Pacific Standard
8167580	8168900	Time.
8168900	8172100	So that's pretty awesome.
8172100	8173100	He deserves it.
8173100	8174100	ZZT is awesome.
8174100	8176140	Will you be able to watch that online?
8176140	8177140	You said?
8177140	8178140	I think you should be able to, yeah.
8179140	8185100	I, you know, I sometimes forget to make that connection that it's the same guy who made
8185100	8190500	ZZT who also has a hand in all these newer games, so definitely a lifetime of accomplishments
8190500	8195140	in the game industry, so a well-deserved award, in my opinion.
8195140	8197420	And again, I can't say enough good things about ZZT.
8197420	8200940	I wish it would make a comeback as well, but I guess it would be hard in this day and age.
8200940	8202660	That'd be a great game on the Switch.
8202660	8203660	Ha ha ha ha.
8203660	8205540	Yeah, I think it would be.
8205940	8210540	All right, well, lastly tonight, before we get to the Skype line and your calls at Orange.
8210540	8213380	It'd be awesome, actually, to totally interrupt you here.
8213380	8214380	Sure.
8214380	8219140	ZZT on Steam with Steam Workshop support for levels.
8219140	8220140	I like that.
8220140	8224020	That would be fucking awesome.
8224020	8226740	But in the meantime, we have Frog Fractions 2.
8226740	8233060	Anyhow, lastly tonight, before we get to the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio, a brand
8233060	8238380	new cooking show that appeals to gamers made its debut in South Korea.
8238380	8239380	That's right.
8239380	8244020	It's a South Korean World of Warcraft cooking show aired on TV this week.
8244020	8245380	Yeah, no, really.
8245380	8246380	This really happened.
8246380	8250020	It aired, I think, just yesterday, and it's called Wow!
8250020	8251020	Recipe?
8251020	8252020	The Meal is Ready.
8252020	8254820	At least that's what the title translates to.
8254820	8261500	And it stars Choi Hun Suk, hopefully I pronounced that right, sorry, a famous chef who appears
8261500	8263100	on South Korean television.
8263100	8267540	But in this particular show, this guy happens to be a WoW player.
8267540	8274180	So he cooks dishes called murloc soup and hellhound sweet and sour fish while the guests
8274180	8277220	in the studio share stories from and about the game.
8277220	8278700	I actually think that's kind of awesome.
8278700	8283420	Like as much as we can sit here and kind of joke like LOL WoW cooking show, I mean, we
8283420	8286740	sit here and talk about video games as we're talking about food.
8286740	8288220	Well, yeah, there's one I watched.
8288220	8290060	This is kind of the perfect TV show.
8290060	8295500	Thanks to Reddit, there was a, and I now of course, I don't remember what the series
8295500	8296500	of that.
8296500	8297500	Look at my phone here real quick.
8297500	8305860	But there was a cooking show for like based off TV and movies, like different recipes
8305860	8307500	or like dishes that are in there.
8307500	8309900	They're like, well, how would they make it like one of the ones that they did was the
8309900	8315480	turkey burger from Parks and Rec where they have the burger cook off thing.
8315480	8319120	So they made the Ron Swanson burger, which is just meat and bun.
8319120	8323440	And then they made the other turkey burger thing with like all the fancy stuff on it.
8323440	8326200	And the guy's like, actually, it's pretty good.
8326200	8328880	There's a cooking channel on Twitch now, so why not?
8328880	8330880	And an eating channel.
8330880	8336000	Wait, is there a cooking channel on Twitch or am I mixing it up with the eating channel?
8336000	8338540	I think I'm mixing it up with the eating channel.
8338540	8342280	But I'm sure now that they have what the whole IRL thing, I'm sure you could do a cooking
8342280	8346120	show on Twitch and get away with it and you wouldn't, you know, get shut down if you were
8346120	8348960	themed like this particular show is.
8348960	8354520	So SSJ 100 Matt says, it sounds like the dish where they talk about stuff and cook.
8354520	8357240	I think a show like this would work great in America.
8357240	8361600	I mean, I don't know if it would show on cable television or whatever, but at the same time,
8361600	8365560	like it sounds like not that I would know firsthand, just based on what I've heard,
8365560	8368320	it sounds like it would be great stoner TV.
8368440	8372280	Like, let's talk about video games and food.
8372280	8375800	I think there's an audience for that out there, you guys.
8375800	8377800	It's just untapped, I don't know.
8377800	8380360	Anyway, Loki, did you find the name of what you were looking for?
8380360	8384920	Um, no, I think it's Andrew Ray.
8384920	8386760	I have to check, take a look here.
8386760	8387760	Yeah, it's Andrew Ray.
8387760	8391680	It's called Binging with Babish.
8391680	8395160	And so like they do Kevin's famous chili from the office.
8395200	8402480	They had the eggs wood house from Archer and that is fucking disgusting.
8402480	8404000	This is so heavy.
8404000	8405240	I kind of want to use that.
8405240	8407680	All right, we are going to open up the Skype line right now.
8407680	8410920	You can give us a call if you want to talk about anything we've talked about so far tonight,
8410920	8413040	or perhaps you have something new you'd like to discuss.
8413040	8415960	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
8415960	8420240	You can also do the old fashioned way if you must, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
8420240	8424200	But the phone lines are already ringing at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype, so let's get to it.
8424240	8425240	Hi, on Orange Lounge Radio.
8425240	8426240	Who's this?
8426240	8427240	It's Ron.
8427240	8428240	So everyone take a drink.
8428240	8429520	Hey, I will do that.
8429520	8430520	Here we go.
8430520	8431520	Drink.
8431520	8432520	Except I only have water.
8432520	8433520	Boring.
8433520	8434520	It's okay.
8434520	8435520	It's all good.
8435520	8436680	No soup waffle tonight.
8436680	8439760	You got married, so okay, you already did your drinking, so it's all good.
8439760	8440760	Maybe a little bit.
8440760	8445280	We actually, a funny story, I got to tell this aside because it was one of the moments
8445280	8447800	that really got me about the whole wedding, right?
8447800	8449760	So you know, we did this as a surprise.
8449760	8455340	We didn't tell anybody and in a very 2017 sort of way, we just knew there's really no
8455340	8457200	other way to announce it.
8457200	8461600	We told everybody on Facebook because that's just the society we live in, right?
8461600	8463640	It's a great way to get news out instantly.
8463640	8466760	So the reason why I say that is that it was really a surprise to pretty much everybody
8466760	8468920	we knew.
8468920	8472720	But Alan and I actually, we made reservations because we did this at the courthouse downtown
8472720	8478000	and then we made reservations at a really fancy French place to, you know, have dinner
8478000	8483880	as a married couple for the first time because we knew we weren't going to do any big reception.
8483880	8488880	Well when we get to the French restaurant, a friend of mine that I was doing Rocky Horror
8488880	8492600	with here in Sacramento happened to be there and she was like, you guys are dressed up
8492600	8493600	fancy.
8493600	8494600	What's happening?
8494600	8497280	And I was like, well actually we just got married and she kind of did that whole like
8497280	8498280	what?
8498280	8499880	You know, that whole thing of the surprise.
8499880	8503400	Well the reason why I tell this story, we ended up getting the table next to them, but
8503400	8506480	obviously, you know, we didn't really intrude on whatever they were doing and they didn't
8506480	8507480	really intrude on us.
8507480	8512120	But we exchanged pleasantries and they were very nice, the table and offering their congratulations
8512120	8513120	and all this stuff.
8513120	8518160	Well anyway, come the end of the night, the waiter brings by some complimentary champagne.
8518160	8522560	It says on the house and we were like, oh okay, we don't, you know, Alan especially
8522560	8526720	really doesn't drink at all, but you know, wedding night you can make an exception.
8526720	8531000	And you know, I was driving, suddenly had a little bit.
8531000	8533160	But then we were like, okay, we're ready to pay the bill.
8533160	8537360	And he said, oh, your friends at the other table already took care of it.
8537360	8539880	And I was like, you've got to be fucking kidding me.
8539880	8541400	Like in like the greatest way.
8541400	8546080	Like I think we, we let out our first married couple joint gay gasp in unison.
8546080	8551380	It turns out my friend and their party there at the table paid the bill for us and they
8551380	8554600	got the last surprise in on my wedding day.
8554600	8557760	That's pretty, that's pretty fucking awesome.
8557760	8558760	Huh?
8558760	8560800	I gotta say that's, that's a gesture I won't soon forget.
8560800	8563660	And it's one of those things where it's like, it's, it's, it's like impossible to pay back.
8563660	8564660	You know what I mean?
8564660	8570280	So I will have to pay it forward on some unsuspected married couple in the future.
8570280	8573960	Sounds like a plan, but I got a quick story about that and I'll talk about what I wanted
8573960	8574960	to call it about.
8574960	8575960	Yeah.
8575960	8578920	Let's go to the pre Facebook days around the time of MySpace.
8578920	8584080	I'm living with my older sister, her then fam, whatever.
8584080	8586440	So I get up, get dressed, go to work.
8586440	8592720	And I see her all dressed up with her husband, now husband, and I'm like, where y'all going?
8592720	8595220	They're like, oh, we're going out for lunch, whatever.
8595220	8596880	I'm just like, fine, whatever.
8596880	8601020	I go to school, go to work, come back.
8601020	8603360	My sister-in-law is stewing at the desk.
8603360	8605720	I'm just like, who pissed in your cornflakes?
8605720	8608480	And she's like, did you hear what happened?
8608480	8609480	No.
8609480	8612280	Your sister, my brother got married today.
8612280	8614920	I'm like, what do you mean they got married?
8614920	8616640	They went down to the courthouse and got married.
8616640	8621200	And I'm just sitting there like, well, that explains why they were all dressed up this
8621200	8623760	morning, huh?
8623760	8624760	That's funny.
8624760	8628400	So you, you knew that you'd seen them dressed up, but you, they just like, oh, we're going
8628400	8629400	to lunch.
8629400	8630400	Oh, okay.
8630400	8632160	No biggie.
8632160	8633160	That's funny.
8633160	8634160	That's a good story.
8634160	8638000	No, nobody saw us leaving the house since Alan and I live alone, don't have any roommates
8638000	8639000	anymore.
8639000	8641200	We just, you know, went and did our thing.
8641200	8643080	There were a lot of other couples there though.
8643080	8644080	Exactly.
8644080	8650360	Another, like an older, but another gay couple was doing the same thing we were doing.
8650360	8651360	That is hope ruptures.
8651360	8652360	Yeah.
8652360	8654760	They, they wished us congratulations and we did the same, but there was a variety of couples
8654760	8655760	there.
8655760	8658680	There was a very young looking couple getting married as well with a few of their family
8658680	8659680	members.
8659680	8662400	But anyway, marriage, they could talk all night.
8662400	8663400	Yeah.
8663400	8666040	Now let's talk the switch real quick.
8666040	8667040	Sure.
8667040	8672080	I don't know if you know, but there, there are some gaming laptops out there where you
8672080	8674000	can buy a dock for it.
8674000	8682160	And in this dock you can add a standard desktop video card and give it more power.
8682160	8685600	There are some, there's talk of some docs where you can do that.
8685600	8690800	You can add more Ram or another hard drive and stuff like that, hot swapping to make
8690800	8693920	it give it more power when you're at home.
8693920	8700760	I can see them doing something like that with the switch because I am, I had a feeling the
8700760	8708080	dock was just two USBs and additional chip set to give it more power and more memory.
8708080	8714840	Now I can see this happening if, if reports are coming out saying that the switch is not
8714840	8724480	powerful enough to run next gen games or whatever, I can see Nintendo coming up with a doc that
8724480	8726360	can do all this.
8726360	8730240	And then, so you must've been, you must've been the one that was talking about this where,
8730240	8733320	because I just brought this up with Loki during part a or something about this whole
8733320	8739040	fact that they could upgrade the doc, uh, to do like maybe some more power or whatever.
8739040	8743720	But Loki, Loki didn't seem to think that would, that would really happen when Nintendo, no,
8743720	8746920	it's not going to happen in the system that you're thinking of is like one of the razor
8746920	8751080	systems that they have, which are way overpriced in the first place and the performance out
8751080	8754920	for those docked, um, units.
8754920	8759160	It's just not the same as you would actually being an integrated cards.
8759160	8763360	It's not the, the bus isn't as fast besides you're going to be paying like way too much
8763360	8764800	money for that.
8764800	8765800	Anyways.
8765800	8771000	Um, I just, there is, they've already confirmed that there's no additional hardware in that
8771000	8773240	doc to enhance anything.
8773240	8777880	It's just literally the output is changing for the TV cause there's no point in that,
8777880	8782120	you know, outputting higher than seven 20 cause that's all the screen supports on them,
8782120	8783120	the portable.
8783120	8786280	And I would be willing to bet, you know, I haven't looked at it yet and actually one
8786280	8789120	thing, funny enough, one of the things that last night I was thinking about, I was like,
8789120	8793720	hmm, how much would it cost to make like a switch like device that actually is a PC
8793720	8795400	that I can run PC games on?
8795400	8797360	Cause that's kind of what I want to do anyways.
8797360	8802960	And so I started thinking about it a little bit and um, it probably would be pretty expensive,
8802960	8809920	but you know, the way I would have done a doc is basically just had like an HDMI and
8809920	8814400	um, power make some sort of exposed like contacts.
8814400	8818240	And then when you shove it into the doc, then it makes those connections and everything.
8818240	8822200	And I haven't gotten a close up look at the doc, but I'm guessing that's probably how
8822200	8827320	it works since I would think that, you know, having like a plug or something sitting inside
8827320	8830820	there might, you might break that or might break the connection.
8830820	8832580	So that would just make the most sense to me.
8832580	8838280	But there's, I don't, there's no additional processing within that unit, within the doc.
8838280	8840240	Not even any additional cooling either.
8840240	8845240	Oh, I kind of figured much, but that one, the laptop you're talking about, it was, it's
8845240	8850640	not a Razer if it is them, it's brand new, but I know it's Alienware that has that.
8850640	8851640	Oh, okay.
8851640	8852640	Well, whatever.
8852640	8854840	I think expensive computers and Razer comes to mind.
8854840	8856600	Well, Alienware would be up there too.
8856600	8857600	Yes.
8857600	8860120	Alienware, they're also ridiculous expensive computers.
8860120	8861120	Yeah.
8861120	8867180	Well, most Razer laptops look like a really fancy MacBook Pros that run with Windows 10.
8867180	8870260	You know, something I've been thinking about though, and I guess this doesn't directly
8870260	8873800	relate to the doc thing, but it does a little bit is that I really think a lot of people
8873800	8878220	are kind of underestimating this potential, and maybe I'm overthinking it, I don't know,
8878220	8881800	but of the Windows 10 game mode and this whole thing that's coming where they're going to
8881800	8886320	allow more of your computer processing power to be dedicated to games.
8886320	8893480	I would think that this is really going to put PCs in line with what we see Project Scorpio
8893480	8898600	is going to end up being capable of, and yet there's this whole ecosystem of you can buy
8898600	8904320	the game once and you get it on both Xbox One and Windows 10 or whatever.
8904320	8908900	It's almost like Project Scorpio, whatever that ends up being, is going to be your doc
8908900	8909900	in a way.
8909900	8910900	I don't know.
8910900	8913680	It's just something weird I've been thinking about, but I'm really curious what a game
8913680	8917560	changer, wink nod, game mode's going to be in Windows 10.
8917560	8925760	Well, I can't say this much about Project Scorpio, modular.
8925760	8930240	But that's usually why people stay away from PCs and go to consoles, is because of the
8930240	8931240	whole modular thing.
8931240	8934320	So it'd be weird if they did that.
8934320	8935320	But here's the thing.
8935320	8936320	Yeah.
8936320	8937320	PCs are modular.
8937320	8942120	It doesn't take much to do upgrades, but it does take a lot of thought and requirement
8942120	8944800	if you really want to do proper upgrades or whatever.
8944800	8950000	The way I see Scorpio's going with modular upgrades, it's going to stay on there compatible
8950000	8951000	with this.
8951000	8952000	It's going to work.
8952000	8953160	They're going to keep it simple as possible.
8953160	8957560	They're going to try to make it as simple as possible.
8957560	8959560	I don't think they're going to do that.
8959560	8963840	And honestly, I think it's just going to be just a simple setup where they sell a console.
8963840	8967160	It wouldn't make any sense anyways, because the first thing you're going to have happen,
8967160	8971000	especially now that it's Windows 10 stuff, you have a lot of these games that are Xbox
8971000	8975240	One that run on Windows 10, especially if you're looking at first-party titles.
8975240	8979880	I mean, of course, once the specs come out for this and the price, they're just going
8979880	8983920	to be like, okay, what kind of PC can it build for that same amount of money spec-wise?
8983920	8986720	And I'm sure that they'll be able to come up with something that's more powerful than
8986720	8987720	it.
8987720	8990680	It's just, I don't know.
8990680	8995440	I had to see what enhancements this is actually going to offer for the price.
8995440	9000560	And I doubt that it would go modular, because what's the point at that point?
9000560	9003960	I mean, why wouldn't you just buy a PC at that point?
9003960	9007200	And for the average consumer, that doesn't make any sense either, because they're not
9007200	9009920	going to understand how to upgrade a system.
9009920	9016800	Well, I mean, I know I've talked to a lot of people who talk about how to build their
9016800	9021540	computers and so forth, and for some it's easy, and others it's quite overwhelming.
9021540	9022540	So I get it.
9022540	9029040	I mean, you could spend $400 to build a pretty decent gaming PC, or you spend $400 on a powerful
9029040	9032680	console, everything is set, grab it, plug, and go.
9032680	9033960	It's just what it boils down to.
9033960	9038000	They just, people, console players, they want to keep it simple as possible.
9038000	9041680	All right, well, we'll see.
9041680	9045480	We got E3 is going to unveil a lot, I think, in that regard.
9045480	9048160	I think Microsoft will pour a lot into E3, so we'll see.
9048160	9050560	But anyway, Brahma, I'm going to let you go so we can get more calls, okay?
9050560	9051560	Oh, no problem, dude.
9051560	9052560	All right.
9052560	9053560	Anime Jam session.
9053560	9054560	Everybody listen.
9054560	9055560	Damn right.
9055560	9056560	All right.
9056560	9057560	Take care, my friend.
9057560	9058560	You too.
9058560	9059560	Bye.
9059560	9060560	All right.
9060560	9061560	Skypline's lit tonight.
9061560	9062560	Let's get to the next call.
9062560	9063560	Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.
9064160	9065160	Hi, this is YYR.
9065160	9066160	Hey, my friend.
9066160	9069640	Ooh, you're echoing just a little bit, but hopefully Skype will equalize there.
9069640	9071760	But what's on your mind, my friend?
9071760	9073360	Sorry if there's echoing.
9073360	9076680	It's because I'm in my dining room and there isn't much on the walls yet.
9076680	9077680	Ah, okay.
9077680	9078680	That makes sense.
9078680	9079680	So what's up?
9079680	9082680	Well, first of all, I wanted to say congratulations to you and Alan.
9082680	9083680	Welcome to the club.
9083680	9084680	Thank you.
9084680	9085680	I appreciate that.
9085680	9086680	That's right.
9086680	9087680	You got married just in the past year, too.
9087680	9090200	You were here right after your wedding, yeah.
9090200	9091200	Yeah.
9091840	9097020	It's wonderful, and I hope you guys have many, many, many, many, many years of bliss.
9097020	9098020	Thank you.
9098020	9099020	We'll try.
9099020	9103960	I will say this much on the thing you just talked about as far as why I don't think game
9103960	9106800	mode is going to be a game changer.
9106800	9108720	Universal Windows Platform.
9108720	9109720	You did here, right?
9109720	9110720	Oh, yeah.
9110720	9112340	That's a fair point, I suppose.
9112340	9119740	It's limited to UWP apps, so until the Windows Store is less of a piece of crap, I don't
9119780	9121820	think it's going to really gain much traction.
9121820	9123180	All right.
9123180	9124180	Fair perspective.
9124180	9125180	Fair perspective.
9125180	9128380	Well, what did you want to call in tonight about before you heard that?
9128380	9129380	Well, you know what?
9129380	9134300	I wanted to mention something that has pretty much flown under the radar because it's very
9134300	9142240	niche news, but fortunately, it's in our niche, so I think it's very appropriate that you
9142240	9145900	guys all know about this.
9145900	9151180	Have you heard of the Konami Arcade Championship?
9151180	9156500	I feel like yes because you brought it up before, but otherwise, no.
9156500	9158700	It's not something I've been actively following.
9158700	9159700	Okay.
9159700	9163600	Well, this is the sixth year that Konami has run this.
9163600	9170820	It's basically a yearly tournament for all of their Bimani games, and they hold preliminaries
9170820	9178320	over e-amusement on pretty much all the Bimani games, 2DX, SoundVoltex, what have you.
9178320	9182900	People compete in the preliminaries just by playing the game and playing the songs out
9182900	9185580	of the qualifying folder.
9185580	9192460	When the qualifiers are all done, basically, the top players get an all-expenses-paid trip
9192460	9196140	to Tokyo, where they compete in the finals.
9196140	9197140	Okay.
9197140	9203620	Well, interestingly enough, you may recall that this past year was the first year that
9203620	9211700	we have ever had a version of DDR released in North America officially with e-amusement.
9211700	9216820	Right, with DDR-Ace and the fact that round ones have them, right.
9216820	9223820	And so, North America was officially added as a competition region for the Konami Arcade
9223820	9225980	Championships in DDR-Ace.
9225980	9228860	I feel like there's a punchline coming.
9228860	9241740	Well, California's own Chris Chyke, aka IAmChrisForLife, and Jeff Lloyd, aka Funga, have qualified
9241740	9248740	first and second place overall, as well as a third person who I don't know personally,
9248740	9254380	and they will all be flying to Japan next month to represent us in the finals, which
9254380	9258620	will be streamed live in February over Konami's website.
9258620	9261140	Oh, there's no punchline.
9261140	9262140	This is good news.
9262140	9263460	This is great news.
9263460	9267100	I was expecting some huge Konami fuckup as a punchline.
9267100	9268820	That's the day and age that we live in.
9268820	9274780	We're like, oh, the scores got deleted, or Konami rendered it ineligible, or the machines
9274780	9280860	deleted themselves, or I was expecting some colossal Konami fuckup as a punchline.
9280860	9281860	And there's not one.
9281860	9283180	This story has a happy ending.
9283740	9285140	No, no, this is amazing.
9285140	9287780	I'm really looking forward to this.
9287780	9293700	I hope to pass this along to some major gaming websites and see if they pick up on it, because
9293700	9296900	I feel like this is a story you're not going to hear very often.
9296900	9301500	I mean, first of all, DDR's kind of an e-sport already.
9301500	9304300	There's some that listen to this show that might pluck it, but we'll see.
9304300	9305300	I know you're out there.
9305300	9306780	I know you're out there.
9306780	9307780	Say hi sometimes.
9307780	9315460	Every day, you see North Americans flying to the host country to challenge their best
9315460	9320380	at their own game, and I mean, they're all friends anyway, but it's going to be amazing
9320380	9321380	to watch.
9321380	9322380	Yeah, that'll be great.
9322380	9328460	I mean, finally, here we are in 2017, and Konami is finally kind of recognizing the
9328460	9330100	global audience of DDR.
9330100	9331100	That's fucking fantastic.
9331100	9336620	God, I wish it had been that way when we started this show 15 years ago, but say it with me.
9336620	9341780	And having spoken to both of the number one and number two players at MAGFest, they were
9341780	9343900	both there trying Kyle Ward's new game.
9343900	9344900	Did you get to try it?
9344900	9346140	I hope you did.
9346140	9347140	Here's the thing.
9347140	9351380	On my flight over there, I kind of fucked up my leg, so I had a problem kind of walking
9351380	9353480	around, so I didn't really get to...
9353480	9359260	I did like basic steps on, okay, because there was a fucking solo fourth mix, and I can't
9359260	9360260	not play solo.
9360260	9364300	So I played lightly, but there were so many crowds around Step Maniacs.
9364300	9370100	I did not play myself, however, my good pal, Jonko, who used to be on a show called Koopa
9370100	9374380	Club, we're really good friends now, and we were there, I watched him play.
9374380	9379140	He's still really good at those music games, his feet flying and all that stuff.
9379140	9382500	I can't keep up with him in my advancing age.
9382500	9385680	But I watched him play, so I feel like I got a good sense of the game, because I stood
9385680	9388300	there and I watched like, oh, it's a touch screen.
9388300	9389300	Oh, he kind of...
9389300	9390300	Oh, I see.
9390300	9391820	Kyle kind of took the re-rave cabinet and did something new with it.
9391820	9393260	Yeah, I was thrown by that too.
9393260	9396460	Yeah, so that was, you know, and I kind of liked that.
9396460	9397460	So it was really hard to hear.
9397460	9399340	And all of them were Matrixwalk jokes.
9399340	9400340	Yeah.
9400340	9401340	Yeah, yeah.
9401340	9402340	No more of that, huh?
9402340	9409260	It was really hard to hear in the songs themselves, but I certainly caught that not only did he
9409260	9414520	get to pluck some of the very classic DDR songs, I caught some Captain Jack in there,
9414520	9415580	but you know, kind of like...
9415580	9420420	And this was always the case with not just In the Groove, but then his later stuff, like
9420420	9426580	Re-Rave, where it's like, oh, there's an erotic song, a Smile DK song, you know, Kyle's very
9426580	9432580	self-aware and clearly must be, must have some sort of Konami's blessing slash we won't
9432580	9437460	sue you slash 10% of the profits type thing that allows this game to exist.
9437460	9439980	Well, you know, I did ask him about that.
9439980	9442180	I would be shocked if he can talk about it.
9442180	9447180	Well, basically what he said to me was, it was disgust.
9447180	9450260	But beyond that, he said he couldn't tell me.
9450260	9451900	He was not at liberty to tell me.
9451900	9457620	So what I gather from that is that they did discuss something and he's under NDA right
9457620	9458620	now.
9458620	9459620	Yeah.
9459620	9460620	Yeah.
9460620	9461620	And that's understandable.
9461620	9465740	They've worked something out, but the terms he can't disclose, I mean, that's a business
9465740	9466740	deal.
9466740	9467740	It's, you know, that's...
9467740	9470500	Which says to me that maybe that's good news.
9470500	9471500	So...
9471500	9472500	Oh, I think it is.
9472500	9473500	I think he...
9473500	9474500	Well, I mean, I don't know.
9474500	9475500	Fuck it.
9475500	9477380	I just need to invite him back on the show when he's ready.
9477380	9480660	He might not be ready to talk about the whole thing yet, but when he's ready, we can get
9480660	9481820	everything firsthand.
9481820	9487220	But yeah, I would, you know, I anticipate he's going big with this and he, you know,
9487220	9489860	even in just interviewing him on our show, what, God, it was probably two or three years
9489860	9490860	ago at this point.
9490860	9495460	No, the same year as PAX East Boston, so that was what, 2014, right?
9495460	9496460	So...
9496460	9497460	Sounds right.
9497460	9498460	Yeah.
9498460	9499460	So it was a little over two years ago.
9500380	9504740	He's definitely learned a lot from the legal perspective than what we were talking years
9504740	9505740	ago.
9505740	9509300	So I think the man knows how to cross his T's and dot his I's, so...
9509300	9519060	Yeah, and just to finish up, I'll just say, having talked to both Chris and Jeff at MAGFest,
9519060	9523740	they're hoping that Konami uses, you know, this opportunity to have the North Americans
9523740	9527260	come and compete at the highest level over there.
9527260	9532020	They're hoping that that will encourage Konami to expand their offerings further to North
9532020	9534460	America.
9534460	9537140	So I hope that's what comes out of it too.
9537140	9538140	That would be great.
9538140	9541100	And JD actually clarifies it was May 3rd, 2015.
9541100	9542100	It really took that long.
9542100	9543360	I thought it was...
9543360	9545020	My ears are blending together at this point.
9545020	9546580	I guess it was 2015 that was PAX East.
9546580	9548940	I know how you feel.
9548940	9549940	It's just a blur.
9549940	9554340	Yeah, that makes sense because my first MAG was 2016 and I switched to MAG from PAX East,
9554340	9555340	which I went on to.
9555340	9556340	All right, it makes sense.
9556420	9558300	Don't fucking bring facts into this, JD.
9558300	9560300	I hate it when you do that.
9560300	9564980	All right, let me put this out though, because I think this is an important point.
9564980	9568540	I want to get your perspective on this, being a big music game fan and being one of the
9568540	9572420	people that really convinced me to give MAG a try.
9572420	9577180	There's a lot of rumor, well, not even rumor, just we all see what's happening on Reddit
9577180	9580020	between MAGFest and Tokyo Attack.
9580020	9584980	And Tokyo Attack has pretty much said, we're out for next MAGFest, not happening.
9584980	9588860	So what's your reaction to that whole thing, being a music game fan?
9588860	9592460	Well, I did talk to Anthony while I was there.
9592460	9601500	Anthony is the head of Tokyo Attack and he said that MAGFest's organization has gotten
9601500	9608500	to be very complex, as you would expect when it's grown to the size that it has.
9608500	9610980	Well, it's splintering now too.
9610980	9614060	I'm just saying we're going to have MAG West this year.
9614060	9617420	They have traveling MAG shows, they have the tiny MAG show they still do.
9617420	9622900	I mean, there's all these MAG spinoffs, so definitely there's a lot of parts to the machine.
9622900	9626220	Definitely, many more than there used to be.
9626220	9634060	And basically he said that it's been difficult to coordinate and to deal with the various
9634060	9639700	heads of the Hydra, much more so now than it used to be, and he's gotten frustrated
9639700	9641220	with it.
9641220	9646060	And you know, it's his company and he has the right to make those kind of decisions
9646060	9648180	and I respect that.
9648180	9654020	And I know that definitely there'll be some holes in the lineup if they're gone.
9654020	9662780	I know that they brought Beatstream, they brought SoundVoltex and Muzecca and Bishi
9662780	9669340	Bashi as they usually do, and many other very niche, very unique games.
9669340	9676620	But that being said, if you go just by the number of machines that were there, the number
9676620	9685700	of Pump and DDR and just music games in general, even Ubeat, I would say Tokyo Attack wasn't
9685700	9690340	even 50% of it, probably closer to 30 to 40.
9690340	9697780	And so if they're not there, it's not like you won't still see 10 DDR machines.
9697780	9704180	You may not get all of the games, but there will still be plenty of music games there.
9704180	9709460	I hope Tokyo is still, I know this doesn't do you Northeasterners a lot of good unless
9709460	9713700	you travel, but I still hope Tokyo Attack has a relationship with Dragon Con, because
9713700	9716300	that was a great addition to Dragon Con last year, so we'll see.
9716300	9720140	It's not on their calendar yet, but I don't think they have a lot past the first couple
9720140	9721140	months of the year.
9721140	9724940	Well, I mean, Anthony wasn't talking about, well, I'm done with conventions.
9724940	9728780	He only specifically mentioned MagFest, so honestly, I don't think it'll affect Dragon
9728780	9733180	Con or Otacon or any of the other conventions that they've been doing regularly.
9733180	9738420	Yeah, and they are confirmed for MomoCon, which is kind of the sister convention now
9738420	9740060	in Atlanta.
9740060	9743960	And what was the other thing I was going to say, oh yeah, they took that setup right over
9743960	9748620	to the other side of DC, where Awesome Games Done Quick was doing their thing, like right
9748620	9750300	as Mag was ending.
9750300	9754020	So they're very good at what they do, for sure, for sure.
9754100	9758060	Anyway, my friend, I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up, but thanks for your call.
9758060	9762780	Hey, you're welcome, and congratulations again, and I hope you guys all have a great week.
9762780	9763780	Thank you, you too.
9763780	9764780	Take care, my friend.
9764780	9765780	Yep, take care.
9765780	9766780	All right.
9766780	9767780	Bye.
9767780	9769420	I think that is going to do it for the Skypline tonight.
9769420	9772700	I'm sorry for those that didn't get through tonight, but you can always send us an email
9772700	9778700	over at Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, but we are about done for the night, unless
9778700	9781540	I do need to check in and see if Loki has any last-minute stories for us tonight.
9781540	9783500	I do have a couple last-minute stories, actually.
9783500	9784740	Please, go for it.
9784740	9792420	So I guess it only makes sense, since VR is now a thing, but apparently, a VR film company
9792420	9800180	is rebooting the movie series Lawmoor Man, and it's going to be only viewable in a VR
9800180	9801180	headset.
9801180	9803460	So they're developing a new series based on that.
9803460	9806540	I'm not sure if that's going to be like a TV series, movies, or something like that,
9806540	9813460	but they're going to be VR movies now, so that'd be kind of cool to see.
9813500	9814500	Excited about that.
9814500	9821060	Lawmoor Man 2 was not so good, but, you know, it's got its nostalgia.
9821060	9827540	And then, I wanted to mention Games Done Quick did $2.2 million this year, so that's raised
9827540	9830580	quite a bit of money, and I got to watch quite a bit of that.
9830580	9837020	That's what I was doing in between playing games, so I'm probably going to check out
9837020	9839780	more of those on-demand videos for that as well.
9839780	9848940	And finally, EA's Patrick Soderlund, he had made a comment regarding Nintendo Switch,
9848940	9853220	and basically saying, I spoke only about FIFA today, but our company's structure let us
9853220	9858420	release all sorts of games for every platform, so we'll go wherever the gamers go.
9858420	9862780	I think Nintendo Switch will put Nintendo at the forefront of the game industry once
9862780	9863780	again.
9863780	9867220	Their approach is quite different from anything they've done in the past.
9867220	9871940	We've listened to EA, Activision, and other companies since the beginning of the Switch's
9871940	9875380	development, so we've been involved through the whole process.
9875380	9880040	They teamed up with us because they wanted to guarantee the console would be a success.
9880040	9882660	Doing business with Nintendo is very important to us.
9882660	9886380	We'd like to bring more and more games over for everyone.
9886380	9889140	So maybe third parties are on board.
9889140	9893500	All I'm saying right now is based off of what I've seen them announce, I'm not entirely
9893500	9894940	convinced yet.
9894940	9899100	And based on what YYR says in chat, I kind of tend to agree, where YYR says, I take this
9899100	9901620	EA statement to mean the same as last time on Wii U.
9901620	9903420	If people buy it, we will come.
9903420	9905300	And last time didn't happen.
9905300	9906300	Yeah.
9906300	9908300	All right.
9908300	9911820	And let's see, what else?
9911820	9913820	That's pretty much it, sadly.
9913820	9914820	All right.
9914820	9919220	Well, that is going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
9919220	9922040	Thank you guys so much for listening to the show tonight.
9922040	9924180	We appreciate all the support.
9924220	9928820	As a reminder, you can leave us a nice five-star review on a place like iTunes or Google Play
9928820	9929820	or what have you.
9929820	9931220	That stuff goes a very long way.
9931220	9932660	We really appreciate it.
9932660	9938100	Also, we don't ask for your money here on the show, so you can always spread us via
9938100	9939100	word of mouth.
9939100	9940100	It goes a long way.
9940100	9945740	Tell a friend or two about the show because we can't have an audience and voices to hear
9945740	9948420	from if they're not here to share them.
9948420	9949420	But that's going to do it.
9949420	9950420	Hooray.
9950420	9953420	We made it through the show without a power outage, although I think the rain kind of
9953420	9954420	stopped.
9954420	9955420	Yeah, it was weird.
9955420	9959140	Last night, if we were doing the show, that would have been kind of iffy because it was
9959140	9960780	like 50, 60 mile an hour winds.
9960780	9962940	The wind woke me up at four in the morning.
9962940	9963940	I don't know if you saw.
9963940	9966700	Okay, so you know how the storms last week blew our fence over?
9966700	9967700	Oh, I didn't know that.
9967700	9972460	So they fixed it, and now last night, the other half of it blew over.
9972460	9975260	Yeah, it was bad.
9975260	9976380	It was almost like a hurricane.
9976380	9978740	I'm sure some of you East Coasters are like, that's nothing.
9978740	9983460	But keep in mind, California isn't built with that kind of weather in mind.
9983460	9988140	So 60 mile an hour winds is a pretty fucking big deal, and it's fucked up the fence.
9988140	9991220	I thought it was done raining this morning, but apparently it started raining again.
9991220	9993100	It's supposed to be like off and on Sunday.
9993100	9997860	It's supposed to be moist and unstable, just like me, through tomorrow, through Monday,
9997860	10000820	and then finally sun for a week.
10000820	10002180	So that'll be nice.
10002180	10003540	Nice little break here.
10003540	10009420	So speaking of, in a week, we will see you back here in a week, in seven days, where
10009420	10012740	we will do another episode of Orange Launch Radio, talk about whatever happened in gaming
10012740	10013740	that week.
10013740	10015900	Hopefully maybe we can get another interview for you guys.
10015900	10021960	Dark Soccer should be back in seven days, and lots of bright sunshine finally.
10021960	10025780	So maybe we can get outside and play more things like Pokemon Go and the outdoor games.
10025780	10028540	But for now, we're gonna do it.
10028540	10032360	We're gonna end this episode of Orange Launch Radio and say we'll see you in seven days.
10032360	10034080	Have a great week, everybody.
10034080	10035600	Thanks Matt Baume for being here tonight.
10035600	10039280	Thank you guys for being here tonight in chat or via the podcast.
10039280	10041440	We'll see you next time here at Orange Launch Radio.
