0	17680	This year, resolve to support your favorites in video gaming without detriment or talking
17680	21480	down to others. Play together and don't deride those who do. Be critical without being
21480	26000	detrimental. But most of all, enjoy! It's a new year and a new episode of the show where
26000	35400	every gamer has a voice. Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back
35400	41240	to another episode of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio
41240	49800	back tonight after a little break with episode number 672 for this January the 15th of 2017.
49800	54480	First show of 2017, the first show of our 15th year, believe it or not, of doing this.
54480	59120	My name is Rob Roberts live in Studio N7 in Sacramento, California and joining me as
59120	65720	always say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. Balls. Is that how your 2017's been so far?
65720	70520	That's my first word on the show for 2017. I see, so it is noted. Can we put that on
70520	79200	the wiki? Balls. How's 2017 treating you so far? Yeah. Did you have a good new year? My
79200	84880	2017. Okay, everyone who knows me by now knows that I'm kind of obsessed with Aggresive
84880	92680	Retsuko. Watch episode 39 of Aggresive Retsuko. It's a minute and a half and that is exactly
92680	96720	how I feel. What is that? I don't think I know. It's a Sanrio character. The office
96720	103800	lady who's all sweet and kind of pushover and inside she's all rage. And drinks beer
103800	109040	and sings death metal karaoke. Is that like the assistant from Monsters Inc. on the ride
109040	114720	where she'll read you at the end of the ride? No. You need to see Aggresive Retsuko. Is
114720	123280	it on Netflix? Well, they're all fan subbed up there anyway. But episode 39 is basically
123280	130360	how my year has started. And how I feel about the rest of the year. Eat my fist Destiny.
130360	137080	But not the game Destiny. No. Alright. Also say hello to Techmaster Loki. Hello. Hi Loki
137080	147600	how are you? I'm fine. How is 2017 treating you so far? Fine. Same old same old just like
147600	152480	last year? Yeah. Pretty much. Alright. How was your new year? It was okay. We just hung
152480	158560	out at my mother-in-law's house. Sounds exciting. Well, she made food. So it was good. Okay.
158560	162760	Food is good. Food is very good. Hope we have lots of great food to enjoy throughout this
162760	166520	year. So yeah. It's our first show of 2017. We were gone for a little bit. Even though
166520	171960	we did a show on Christmas. That was a lot of fun. We had the next couple weeks off.
171960	177280	One for New Year's. And then I was at MAGFest last week. So I'm back. Actually, I was traveling
177280	182620	back from MAGFest during the show. I was somewhere in the air above Chicago where I'd had my
182620	187360	layover and yeah. So we weren't able to do a show last week. But now we're back and looking
187360	192560	forward to all the conventions this year. Although actually nothing on my calendar yet.
192560	195920	This is kind of the little break. I mean, the end of the year is always like, after
195920	199680	Dragon Con, it's like there's a convention every month. But so far this year is looking
199680	204620	pretty uneventful until Dragon Con is the first thing on my calendar for this year.
204620	205620	So we'll see.
205620	207640	What about Sake in the Arcade? You're forgetting.
207640	211040	Oh, of course. Thank you. Well, here's the thing about Sake in the Arcade. I don't have
211040	215000	to travel for that. That's just in our backyard. So I don't like that's kind of on a different
215000	219000	list in my mind. But no, that's a darn good point. Sake in the Arcade is coming up in
219000	223480	April. And yes, OLR, we're going to be a part of that again. Very excited to be working
223480	229160	with our pals from the Sake IGDA. I know they'll be back on the show at some point
229160	232520	to talk about the event this year. So I'm looking forward to that.
232520	236880	Anyway, we've had a pretty big week in gaming, right? So when we signed off at Christmas
236880	239960	or last time you were here, because you were here for the Christmas show, Loki, last time
239960	245800	we heard from you a month ago, we still had all these questions on the Nintendo Switch.
245800	249120	And you know, I think I remember remarking, you know, by the time you're back on this
249120	253880	show, we're going to have all our answers. Well, we got some of our answers this week.
253880	260080	And we have some new questions. So let's kick off tonight's OLR talking about Nintendo Switch.
260080	263840	First of course, I want to introduce you guys in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com
263840	267760	where we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern
267760	274640	right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at vognetwork.com, vognetwork.com and YYR pointing out in our
274640	280080	chat, aggressive Retsuko is freaking hilarious. You can find them on YouTube, though. Filters
280080	284640	are often applied to avoid copyright strikes. And I see that stuff. Like they'll flip the
284640	288560	image or they, they have a different aspect ratio or something.
288560	292760	There's also, I put a link in the chat room to where I've been watching them all.
292760	298260	JD in chat brings up Mag West. Yes. Thank you for bringing that up. I do want to attend
298260	302360	Mag West for sure. I can't remember if that was April or August. I think it's August.
302680	305960	Yeah. It's August because I remember thinking, oh gosh, I hope that's not the same time as
305960	311480	DragonCon, but it's like the week before. So that's going to be a pretty crazy time,
311480	317720	but, uh, bring it on, bring it on. I say, all right, off to the Nintendo Switch. So
318520	325160	Loki. Yes. I know the longtime listeners are, you know, you, you've always been a critic of
325160	328920	Nintendo, but it's not, you know, and again, I'm going to start off by saying this because
328920	332760	I want to reinforce Jason's message of positivity at the top of the show, which I think is a good
332760	339000	way to start 2017. Uh, I don't think anybody here hates Nintendo, but in fact, we love Nintendo
339000	346040	and it kind of, it's, it's hard sometimes to watch them make what we view as careless mistakes.
346040	350200	Would that be a fair way of putting it, Loki? A blatant oversight. Yes. Some oversight,
350200	355400	Dark Sakura? The moment you said careless mistakes, I now want to hear the forthcoming
355400	360920	rant with careless whisper play in the background. I can make that happen. So let's see. So Loki,
360920	365880	uh, if you were to, we use, we use grades at vognetwork.com A through F. How are you
365880	370280	feeling about the Nintendo Switch after everything you saw earlier this week?
370280	376120	I don't know. Like I made the, you know, the quick decision to go ahead and pre-order one
376120	381800	while I decided if I wanted it or not, because I figured it's going to be a clusterfuck trying to
381800	386200	secure pre-order. And it was, I mean, cause they were pretty much like, oh, hey,
386200	392760	it's up for pre-order and you know, gone in like an hour, you know? Yeah. I was lucky to get one
392760	398280	on Amazon. Um, like they opened it up at midnight. It's like, okay, geez. Which I was like, yay. They
398280	401240	opened it up while I'm still awake. But then I'm thinking in my head, I'm like, oh my God,
401240	405960	East coast Twitter is going to be pissed in the morning. Like that was kinda, that was a weird
405960	409720	time for them to turn the switch. I mean, cause the East coast kind of got screwed in that unless
409720	413080	you're a night owl over there. But anyway, well, and that's the thing is I was going to wait for
413080	417960	Amazon to stay up and do that. But then like, I had to go to sleep. I'm like, okay, well,
417960	423400	it's almost midnight. They haven't put it up yet. Everyone else has, I'm just gonna go to sleep and
423400	427720	wake up tomorrow. And sure enough, midnight, they put it up and it was gone. And so I ended
427720	433640	up ordering it at target or something like that. And that's where I have it right now, but I don't
433640	438440	know. They, and then of course GameStop opened up more pre-orders, but they're forcing those bundles
438440	442680	and stuff like that, which I was actually okay with picking up one of them because the price
442680	447160	difference was about 10 bucks and it came with two games, aside from Zelda, which I was going to get
447160	451960	anyways. But then like when I went to order it, it was already gone. So they only had like $600
451960	458360	bundles. I'm like, no. So if you put in a pre-order, you must be feeling some sense of
459240	461640	desire for the system. There must be something you like.
461640	466760	Here's the thing. Okay. So I'm, I like the fact that there's going to be, I like what the new
466760	471400	Mario looks like. And I like, you know, the Mario Kart and all that stuff and Zelda, you mean Zelda
471400	477560	looks fantastic. But then I really thought about what am I going to do with this? Okay. So like,
477560	484680	for example, Mario Kart 8, it's basically Mario Kart 8 that was on the Wii U, but they added a
484680	489480	couple more characters and fucking fixed battle mode, which should be a fucking patch to the
489480	495640	original game. It shouldn't be its own game. I'm paying $60, 60 bucks to, you know, pat them on
495640	499960	the back. Do we know that that's the final price for Mario Kart 8 deluxe? I'm pretty sure that's
499960	504440	60 bucks. Well, but we don't, I want to see the receipts. Is it not Amazon pre-order?
504440	509560	Knowing Nintendo, it's 60. They're charging $50 for one, two Switch, which is a piece of shit.
509560	513160	Well, that's, I have some strong feelings on that. So they're charging 50 bucks for that. So
513160	519480	sure as shit, they're going to charge $60 for Mario Kart 8 deluxe or whatever, which adds no
519480	524440	extra tracks, no tracks whatsoever. It's just a fucking battle mode, which should have been the
524440	527800	way it was in the first place. But battle tracks, battle tracks, right? Because there was talk
527800	531720	about like Luigi's mansion and there's some, there's... Yeah, the battle mode tracks. Those
531720	536680	are new, obviously, because the way they did battle mode before made no fucking sense whatsoever.
536680	540360	And like, why am I patting you on the back for fixing something that was blatantly wrong to
540360	545720	begin with? It does, I don't even understand why I would reward you with $60 of my money.
545720	548840	And then the other thing I wanted to play was Skyrim, which isn't coming out till the fall.
548840	552840	Why am I going to wait a fucking year to play a game that I have right now that I'm playing?
553560	557240	And let's be honest, it's Nintendo we're talking about here. You really think they're going to have
557240	561400	mod support in that system? Fuck no, they're not, because their system probably won't be able to
561400	565640	handle it. It'll be too complex or some shit. I mean, that's... That doesn't mean people won't
565640	570520	find a backdoor. It doesn't matter. I don't need to find a back... Why should I work on finding a
570520	576760	backdoor for their system to play Skyrim that I can... I could literally spend $400, approximately,
577320	582920	the price of the system and that to buy... Go towards another laptop to play Skyrim with mods.
582920	587320	I mean, why would I want to pay, you know, extra money for that? And then really it came down to,
587320	591480	okay, Zelda looks awesome. You know, I'm sure that, you know, on that system,
591480	594920	it's going to be graphically better and stuff. And then I'm finding out that,
594920	601480	okay, it runs 720p on the Wii U and 900p on the fucking Switch. I'm like, that's not much better.
601480	607000	That's like... I thought they said that Mario... Oh, you mean Skyrim is, because I was like...
607000	611960	No, I'm talking about Zelda. Zelda's going to run at 900p, upscale to 1080.
612920	619400	Interesting. I know Mario Kart 8 is 1080p, 60 frames a second in one player mode on the TV.
620360	624680	But then that's the thing is like games, like running portable on the games,
624680	628840	doesn't... It will underclock them and they won't maybe run at 60 frames per second. So
628840	633160	it's like all these things we don't know about it. And, you know, I came down to like,
633160	636680	I'm thinking, well, what do I really want to play this? The new Mario game looks pretty nice. I mean,
636680	641320	I've skipped a lot of the Mario games. So do I really need to pick a system up right now to
641320	646200	basically have Zelda, which I could already get on the Wii U? And why am I dropping all this money
646200	651240	for like no games coming out until the fall? It doesn't make any sense. It's like the 3DS all
651240	655480	over again. I had... There's someone that was comparing it to the 3DS. And it kind of feels
655480	661560	like that where it's like, okay, we're launching in March. It's gonna... There's... Zelda's great,
661560	666200	but it's not a really solid lineup of titles coming out. And I feel that they're gonna like
666200	671560	in August say, yeah, we fucked up. We're gonna need to drop the price of this. We're gonna need
671560	677880	to do something, you know, to fix the problem. Because I'm just... I don't know. Unless people
677880	683080	are really gonna get hyped up about these games. But hardware wise, it sounds cool. Like I like the
683080	687560	idea that, you know, they have this, you know, enhanced rumble and everything with it. And
689000	694200	those little things look pretty cool. But they're way too expensive. Like if I want to buy a second
694200	699080	pair of those, that's like 80 bucks for control. I think controllers are expensive now. And that's
699080	703480	even more expensive for shit. Fuck that. Why am I doing that? I kind of get it with the little
703480	707560	the little joy cons because there's a lot of crap in those things. I mean, there's a lot going on
707560	712600	with those. I was pretty surprised at what they were packing into that. But $70 for the Pro
712600	718040	controller, that's some side eye right there. That's a little much. That's a little much. And
718040	722200	I full on realize that PlayStation 4 controllers are not much better. They're like 60 bucks.
722200	726040	But most of the time you can get them for 30. You can get them for half price most of the time. And
726040	730360	then I'm talking like first party controllers. But that's the thing with Nintendo is it doesn't
730360	735160	really drop the price and just... And then their online plan that they're charging for online.
736120	740840	I don't know if I really am down with that. I mean, they really need to show me what they're
740920	744680	bringing with it. And that's the problem is when pushed on it, what exactly it's gonna be.
744680	750760	First off, you know, they're offering a game each month, which is like kind of on par with
750760	755560	the other services that are out there, except those services offer four or more games every
755560	761880	month. And it's for only that month. So you get the game. And I'm talking like a virtual console
761880	770120	game. That's literally less than $5 value or $10. And then they're taken away at the end of the
770120	775720	month. You only get it for the month. What kind of fucking backwards type of plan is that? When
775720	778920	they know what the marketplace is, they better not be charging very much for it.
778920	781800	I was gonna say, we don't know what Nintendo is charging for it. I think a lot of people
781800	785880	are assuming that it's gonna be the same price as Microsoft and Sony, but we don't know what
785880	789320	they're charging for it. It could be cheaper, which could position it.
789320	791800	It could be. And then what am I getting with that? I mean...
792760	797800	I'm kind of with you that Nintendo really has to convince us what you're getting with that.
797800	801960	They're like putting all their network features on a fucking app for a phone.
802600	806840	What the hell? This is a game console. I don't need my phone with me to fucking voice chat.
806840	811880	If I want to voice chat, I have fucking Skype I can do that with. Or dozens of other apps that
811880	816840	can do that. Why am I gonna pay you money to present an app for me that runs on my phone
816840	822920	and not on the damn console in the first place to do voice chat for what? For what fucking reason?
822920	826600	You know, this is the kind of work around shit that you'd have to do in like Mario Kart now,
826600	829960	because they're too worried about the kiddies and shit. Is that what it is?
829960	832920	Let me get to some of our chat comments over at live.vognetwork.com,
832920	835080	and then I want to get to DarkSakura's thoughts on this.
835880	838600	Going to chat, let's see. MegamanX400 says,
838600	842120	The controllers are really expensive. Like, try living in Canada. $100.
843000	845880	Yep. Not cheap, that's for sure. Let's see.
846600	852120	Maya in chat says, At $299 with no pack-in, we're all paying the early adopter fee.
852120	859160	Holiday 2017 will see the Switch at $249 with a pack-in game of either Splatoon 2, Switch 1-2,
859160	867560	or both. I'm kind of with you on that. I think the biggest wince and the biggest mistake I think
867560	872280	Nintendo made in that whole thing is that 1-2 Switch should be a pack-in game. Like,
873640	878200	here's the thing. Here's the thing. When people, and I know where you're going with this, Loki,
878200	885160	but again, what Nintendo did with the Wii and the Wii U is that they packed in the concept game
885160	892280	with the system. And for the Wii, that drove buku bucks because people did not buy a Wii.
892280	897080	Many people did not buy a Wii. People bought Wii Sports and the console that you needed to play it
897080	903000	on. That's what people were buying. Nintendo Land, Lightning didn't strike twice. So I'm a little
903000	907960	like, I'm a little thrown off by this 1-2 Switch thing not being included because it does seem
908600	915480	a shoot-in-the-foot move where they're relying on the Zelda thing to push the console,
915480	923400	and that maybe this 1-2 Switch is gonna be that word-of-mouth party thing maybe? I don't know.
923400	927960	That game is fucking cringey. Like, I was getting serious cringe.
927960	930760	See, I can't say that until I play it. I can't say that until I play it.
930760	935560	Watch the videos. It's enough. Watching their demonstration video is fucking cringey as shit.
936200	940040	What kind of games are they offering? Hey, we've got Table Tennis, but guess what you gotta do?
940040	944760	You gotta pretend. You gotta pretend that you're playing Table Tennis. You just swing it to the
944760	950600	ceiling. What the fuck kind of game is that? What about Wii Tennis? That's the same thing.
950600	955480	You know what? Okay. Yeah, Wii Tennis is the same thing. No, it's fucking not. You know what the
955480	960920	difference is? Rob, okay? If you right now look at me, look at me, and you swing your arm like
960920	966040	you're playing tennis. That is the fucking game that's included with that. There is no display
966040	970520	that shows players playing tennis. You don't see any sort of connection with your player playing
970520	974600	tennis where you see a visual feedback of a ball bouncing around. All you have the Nintendo Switch
974600	979240	doing is fucking sitting there as a table picture. Just saying, with the score on there.
979240	985240	I'm just saying, when my friends come over and get drunk, that milking game is gonna be the funniest
985240	990200	fucking thing that ever happened. But you know what? You know what? There's a million other
990200	994760	things. When you're fucking drunk, everything is the most fucking hilarious thing ever.
994760	1000280	It doesn't fucking matter. Why should I pay $50 for a piece of shit game that promises,
1000280	1004600	oh, maybe if my friends come over and get drunk, we'll be... As I recall, one person in this room
1004600	1009320	has been drunk, kicked to the wall, and said he's in the Matrix. That was how many years ago?
1009320	1014200	What does that matter? What is that relevant now? Proof of what people will do when they're drunk.
1014200	1018120	It doesn't matter. But seriously, what is that saying that, oh, this game will be good when I'm
1018120	1024200	fucking shit-faced? That means it's a shitty game. That's like how you date people.
1024200	1027800	I like this comment from Bobby, and then I promise we're getting to Dark Sakura. Loki,
1027800	1032440	zip it for a minute. Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, Skye, actually, the table tennis game is an
1032440	1037560	audio game. You have to play by listening to the audio. Sturlok might actually love that. Remember,
1037560	1042360	our blind gamer that calls into the show sometimes. So, fair counterpoint. All right,
1042360	1046680	Dark Sakura, I'm dying to know your take on this whole thing. So I'm sure you and Dan
1046680	1049800	watched this or the highlight reel or what have you. Where are you standing?
1049800	1050440	I slept.
1050440	1052280	You slept. Well, where are you at on this?
1053240	1056600	We're not getting one. We're not pre-ordering one. We kind of don't care.
1056600	1057960	Why? Because...
1057960	1061560	I'm kind of surprised because of the Zelda thing. So you're just opting for Zelda on Wii U?
1061560	1066920	We're getting it on Wii U. We don't want it on Switch. The whole plan is to pretty much wait
1066920	1070760	for all the hype to die down and get it once there's a decent series of games on it. Like
1070760	1075960	we did with the Wii U. We bought the Wii U when there were good games worth having a Wii U for.
1075960	1080440	So it's kind of what one of our chatters, Maya, was saying earlier. The whole fact that it's
1080440	1083560	almost a given that holiday, the price is going to drop and you're going to get a packing game.
1083560	1084200	Pretty much.
1084200	1085000	I see.
1085000	1087560	I mean, and on top of that too, I mean...
1090760	1094360	I hate to say it. We had too many damn games at my house.
1095720	1100760	What? Who are you? What have you done with Dark Sakura? New year, new you? I don't like this.
1101480	1107880	The Mario trailer looked fucking bizarre because he's, you know, Mario style in real world humans?
1107880	1114040	No. That looks creepy as fuck. He only looks good in the non-human world. Dan and I were saying,
1114040	1117240	this is like fucking Sonic Adventure. It should have been Sonic.
1117240	1118840	There's a lot of people making that comparison.
1118840	1122280	There's a lot of Sonic 06 comparisons, which is fantastic.
1123080	1129320	And then at like at least five people sent me the link to Puyo Puyo Tetris. And guess what?
1129960	1135800	I have it on PS4. I imported it. Actually, Dan imported it for me for my birthday.
1136440	1140920	Very, very text heavy, but I figured out all the menus, so it's not a big deal.
1141640	1147480	And we played the crap out of that, decided Puyo Puyo mode was more fun than Tetris mode,
1147480	1153160	you know, and in versus Dan somehow liked the Tetris one. Anyway, it's a good game. Good game.
1153160	1157960	Worth having. Worth having. I'm glad it's getting a US release. Not enough to make me buy a Switch.
1159720	1164440	And like I said, we're getting Zelda on Wii U so that I can actually, you know, play it on
1164440	1168760	on my pro control. I don't think we have a pro controller yet. No, I think we do. Anyway,
1170040	1174600	I've got options. None of those other things coming out are things I give a crap about.
1175320	1182040	So if I, one, don't give a crap about it, and number two, like saving money,
1183400	1188680	what's the logical decision? Don't spend money on something I don't need.
1188680	1194280	Don't spend money on something that won't enrich my life. I would rather buy myself,
1194280	1199240	well, I'm going to be buying another Apple Watch anyway, but I would rather spend that money on
1199240	1205000	something that's actually going to be useful and then wait until later on when there's going to be
1205000	1210040	more stuff on it that I'm actually going to be interested in and then can justify spending the
1210040	1217080	money on. Why spend money on hype? Okay, well, since I am going to be spending money on hype,
1217080	1222840	I want to talk about my position on this because I have it preordered twice because I'm nervous
1222840	1227160	that one of those preorders is going to be a joke and get yanked away because I was that paranoid
1227160	1232120	about this whole limited quantity situation. But obviously I'm only going to get one of them,
1232120	1235320	although I'm holding onto the second preorder because maybe I'll have a friend that's like,
1235320	1239080	ah, I didn't get on it right away. So I'm going to wait to see how that plays out.
1239080	1245320	But for the most part, I did preorder one. I plan on getting one. Again, I'm viewing it as
1245320	1249080	a portable and I realized that Nintendo is telling you something different. I don't really
1249080	1255000	care. I'm looking at it as a portable and I love it a whole lot more than when I look at it as only
1255000	1260840	a console. When I look at it as a portable system, I get really excited about the potential to
1260840	1265960	take this switch over to, let's say Flaco and his wife's house with Shane there or something
1265960	1269480	like that. And we both have our switches, you know, and it's not like having to like unplug
1269480	1273960	a completely different PlayStation 4 and all this stuff, which, which doesn't even support
1273960	1279240	that type of LAN gaming very easily anyway. So the switch is going to make this, you know,
1279800	1284520	in-house on the same network gaming very, very easy. And so I imagine that, okay,
1284520	1288440	it's going to be very easy for me to just pick up the switch, go to somebody else's house,
1288440	1294920	and we can play like four player Splatoon in the same place. Like having just come back from
1294920	1301480	MagFest, like I am fucking excited about next year's MagFest. And the fact that most of my
1301480	1305240	friends that are going are probably going to have switches and some of the epic games that
1305240	1309560	are going to happen because Nintendo really does know how to make those multiplayer games.
1310280	1315640	And I think things like Mario Kart, Splatoon, and yes, even though it's Mario Kart all over again
1315640	1320360	in the same, the portable element and this new element of being able to have the multiple screens
1320360	1325720	in one place where many people are playing, that's going to be a huge deal. And then, you know,
1325720	1329960	stuff like Splatoon and whatever else Nintendo announces for the holiday. Cause I don't think
1329960	1334760	we're done with 2017. I don't believe that the Mario game is the only game Nintendo's putting
1334760	1339560	out this holiday. Oh, I'm sure they'll announce more ports of Wii U games. That might be where
1339560	1344520	Smash Brothers is, but it's still even, even if it's Smash Brothers on those screens, that's still
1344520	1351160	going to be a big deal. Again, because Smash Brothers on the 3DS, not so great Smash Brothers
1351160	1356600	on the switch, I think has the potential to be awesome. And that's really what the system does
1356600	1362520	for me is that potential of being able to really get up and go. And it's just, it's very different
1362520	1368280	from the 3DS, like, because there are these, you know, larger, well, the only slightly larger
1368280	1373480	screens to be fair, but the way it's just kind of designed to set up, it's very good for like a,
1373480	1378680	the hotel room type of gaming or, you know, a living room thing where everybody's sitting
1378680	1383080	around. I'm reminded of one of my first experiences, my very first experiences ever
1383080	1388280	when I met Dark Sakura. Um, and it was actually at her house and they were having a local area
1388280	1392360	Nintendo party, a LAN party and everybody, you know, keep in mind, this was, I've known Dark
1392360	1397320	Sakura a long time, right? Cause we've been doing this show 15 years. This was like in 2002,
1398040	1404040	I think it was the house. It was around the time when I lived at Bamani Melrose place. That was
1404040	1407400	the end of 2001, right? Where if we had a pool, somebody would got pushed into it with all the
1407400	1411640	drama. Yeah. So, okay. That was the end of 2001. I'm pretty sure this was around that timeframe.
1411640	1417320	So I went over there and Dan was there and all, all his buddies, maybe mystique and people like
1417320	1420920	that. People that are listeners have no idea who these people are. We're all sitting there
1420920	1426040	and you had like, like you had like three TVs in the living room. There was like one TV back
1426040	1430360	in your room and like all these people were there and you guys were like, I don't know if you were
1430360	1435800	speed running, but you were having like a Zelda competition to see who yeah, who could get from
1435800	1443240	the beginning of Zelda to the end, the fastest. And that was like, that was, but that was when
1443240	1447400	I knew, by the way, for anybody who wants to know the history of this show, that's when I knew Jamie
1447400	1454920	was my people was when I saw that whole thing going on. And I'm kind of like this for me,
1454920	1462760	the switch is a little bit of that experience. I don't know. So I'm just, I'm, I'm jazzed about
1462760	1467480	the potential, but that's not that I don't have my concerns. I do certainly have some concerns.
1468440	1474440	I think it's weird that Nintendo is not talking about Netflix type of stuff and app support,
1474440	1479240	because I think that is important in this day and age of, of consoles that we live in,
1479240	1484360	whether they be portable or in the same room, I already expressed my concerns with one, two switch.
1484360	1490360	I think that was a really bad move to not include one, two switch with, with the switch. I think
1490360	1493400	that is a really, really bad move. I thought for sure when they showed it that that was going to
1493400	1499160	be the packing game. I thought for sure too. And I just, I, again, I just don't think it's a smart
1499160	1505560	idea to not put any type of packing game at all, uh, for a concept console such as the switch,
1505560	1509800	but we'll see, we'll see how it goes for him. The March launch is going to prove to be interesting
1509800	1513560	too. You know, we've been talking a lot about the launch lineup and all this stuff. What does
1513560	1518760	2017 look like? You know, and I think this console is breaking a lot of our traditions,
1518760	1524360	what we expect, because this isn't November. And I feel like Nintendo is going to drop this in
1524360	1531000	March, but it's going to be a slow race until how does this thing really sell during the holiday?
1531000	1533880	You know, and that's why I'm curious to see what kind of stunts Nintendo is going to pull out at
1533880	1539800	E3 for the holiday season, you know? And unlike you guys, I was really into the Mario thing.
1539800	1545400	I love the name, by the way, Mario Odyssey. I love that name. Um, and I was kind of digging it.
1545400	1550920	Is he going to require that, um, all of Peach's suitors shoot an arrow through key holes,
1551560	1557960	um, to prove that, you know, he's only the real Mario? Or is he, you know, or is there a bed made
1557960	1563080	out of a tree trunk? Super Mario Odyssey of the mind. I'm actually referring to the Odyssey.
1563080	1569480	I know you were. Anyway, uh, let's see, go into our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
1569960	1575000	Um, May Command X 400 says, it's okay, Sky, don't let them rain on your parade. You enjoy that
1575000	1578680	switch. Don't let them come for you. I'm not because everybody's allowed their opinion. And
1578680	1582840	like, I, even though Jamie says she's not getting a switch, like I actually completely understand
1582840	1587640	that viewpoint where she's looking at it going of these five games that are coming out the first day,
1588200	1592200	I don't need to drop the money on it. So I'm going to wait and see if the deal gets sweeter
1592200	1597480	come Christmas time. I feel like, um, I've gone up like five points and grown up and it sucks.
1597480	1602120	Well, I feel the same way. I mean, it's just like,
1603240	1609640	to be fair, there is a bit of, I'm a gamer and I have to have all the toys coming into play.
1609640	1615880	Like if I was a more rational human being, I might be looking with similar eyes, the dark soccer is,
1615880	1622440	but I'm not, here's my worry. Okay. My worry is I think the third party support is still going to
1622440	1627240	be very fleeting on the system. I just don't think that even though EA was there talking about FIFA,
1627560	1631800	it was fucking awkward as shit. I just don't think it's going to be there aside from,
1631800	1635720	you're going to have the typical Ubisoft fare and all that, but it's just going to,
1636520	1640840	it's going to come down to the same shit that fucking the Wii U ran into where,
1640840	1645480	hey, our modern engines don't fucking run on this. And that's going to be a problem. Yes.
1645480	1649160	I understand you want to be, you're not even more affordable at this point. You're actually
1649160	1653880	more expensive than some systems, which doesn't make any goddamn sense. And yeah, the gimmick
1653960	1658440	that you can take this places and stuff. Cool. That'll work for like a successor to the 3DS
1658440	1663160	or something. But when it comes down to it, the end of the day, which is what this is for me.
1663160	1668280	Okay. That's cool. But it's never going to perform as well as these other systems because
1669080	1676520	you can't get these other franchises granted. Yes. The first party titles may help drive the
1676520	1682120	system, but that's all you got because you can't run the call of duties or battlefields or all
1682120	1685560	these other, what happens when the next elder schools game comes out? You know,
1685560	1688760	they have Skyrim on here right now, but what happens when the next elder school six game
1688760	1693480	comes out? It's fucking fantastic or fallout five or whatever the hell the next big thing is going
1693480	1699320	to be. It's not going to run on this. And that's gonna, I know you people will play off like,
1699320	1703080	Oh, well, whatever. You know, I have another console, but it's gonna affect shit because
1703080	1707160	when they're looking at buying consoles, I want the one where all the best games are,
1707160	1710520	but they'll have the handheld support. And there's some amazing 3DS games,
1710520	1715480	things like Bravely Default that don't exist on consoles right now. So, I mean,
1715480	1719400	I get what you're saying and I don't necessarily disagree. I think Skyrim is a poor choice,
1720040	1725480	but I have heard people say, I'm excited to play Skyrim portable on the go and what have you.
1725480	1732120	I, I, I think those folks are probably the minority. I think, I think Skyrim is a choice
1732120	1737480	like releasing Arkham, uh, what was it? Arkham city or whatever on the Wii U or mass effect
1737480	1743400	three on the Wii U. I think, you know, those were bad choices to release last year's games or
1743400	1748920	six years ago's games on the Wii U. And here's the other thing now though, but see, you mentioned
1748920	1752840	Bravely Default. Now you have a system basically that's, you're developing for like a console
1752840	1758360	system because that's basically how it's set up. Before, when you're developing for 3DS,
1758360	1763080	the port that to like a console would be a lot of work. Now it's not going to be. So what's to say
1763080	1769080	that that stuff only has to go to the Switch. It's going to go everywhere. So why once again,
1769080	1773320	am I picking up a Switch when it's not going to run the games that I want to play on it?
1773320	1778040	I can't help but think Pokemon, which is a huge deal in the handheld world, but once again,
1778040	1783240	that's a first party Nintendo title aside from first party Nintendo, it's going to suffer and
1783240	1787880	let's, let's hope that first party can drive it. Cause it sure as hell didn't work for the Wii U.
1787880	1792360	You know what would be kind of cool though, is if they did a version of Pokemon Go
1793080	1796120	for the Switch that had an AR camera.
1797320	1801720	See, I'm with you. It would have been awesome to support, you know, Pokemon Go for the Switch,
1801720	1805320	except it doesn't have GPS built into it or data or anything else.
1805320	1807560	And thank God it doesn't, or it would be more expensive.
1807560	1811720	I don't think it would. Now I have a 50.
1811720	1819160	Here's, here's my crazy get, get the tinfoil hat because if Nintendo is going to be using an app
1819160	1825960	through your smartphone to do the voice chat, couldn't this Switch also use your smartphone
1825960	1829800	for GPS? No, no, it can't.
1829800	1833480	Why not? If it can use it, if it can use it for chat, why can't it use it for GPS?
1833480	1837240	GPS doesn't work that way. You can't take a third-party source for GPS. You're going to
1837240	1840040	include- Then what the fuck is the Pokemon Go Plus?
1842040	1846280	That's a Bluetooth thing that it has nothing. It's running the app. It's just an extension
1846280	1851240	of the app. It's not that your phone is still running that. All that's happening is you're
1851240	1856200	having some extra feedback coming from an additional device. It's still your app on
1856200	1859400	your phone running that thing. And couldn't the Switch leverage that the
1859400	1862760	same way the Pokemon Go Plus does? But why would I even bother at that point?
1862760	1865000	What's the point? It's like having a giant ass, like,
1865800	1870920	watch or something that doesn't make any sense. Well, since you said watch, they do have the
1870920	1873400	Go app on the watch. It doesn't make any sense. Let's put it
1873400	1881000	this way. I bought my kids cheap ass tablets for Christmas, and those had GPS built into
1881000	1885880	it. So you can't tell me that GPS is too fucking expensive to put into this device.
1885880	1889240	It just doesn't make any sense. Whatever. You know what? That's not the direction that
1889240	1894440	they're going. Fine. But I'm just, I'm worried that it's going to be the whole
1895320	1900280	Wii U all over again, because they're so confident this is different enough. I just,
1900920	1903960	you're under powering your console again, and it's going to hurt you.
1905400	1909000	Okay, going to our chat, because I got to get more chat, because you guys are lighting up
1909000	1914200	our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com. Maya saying the Wii U never saw Pokemon,
1914200	1919640	never saw Fire Emblem, never saw Metroid, never saw any serious square JRPGs. The Switch
1919640	1923960	should have all of those. Well, we're getting what? We have the Fire Emblem Musou, which,
1923960	1929480	you know, is or isn't a real Fire Emblem game. But we do see some JRPGs on this thing, right?
1929480	1934280	So, you know, there's that. Certainly, we got Dragon Quest 10 and 11.
1935400	1940520	Shimagami Tensei was in one of those reveals. So, I mean, we're going to have some stuff on
1940520	1945560	Switch. So, that's good. Let's see. Dungeon Buster in chat says, we'll see if EA and Ubisoft,
1945560	1949880	among others, evaporate their support after a year or two. Yeah, that'll be telling. The FIFA
1949880	1955000	thing, I mean, I know a lot of people, probably in the demographic that listen to this show,
1955000	1959800	probably rolled their eyes at the whole FIFA thing. But that is the world's biggest game,
1959800	1964520	even more so than Madden, because now we're talking the world, right? So, FIFA is a huge,
1964520	1969800	huge game. So, the fact that that's on the Switch, that's something. But I'm curious to kind of see,
1970120	1975000	what is the whole element of the portable and, you know, kind of some of those concepts they
1975000	1978200	were showing in that early trailer, people playing on the rooftop and all that. Is that
1978200	1982200	really going to benefit FIFA? I'm curious to see how that works out, because that's
1982760	1988520	something that Xbox One and PlayStation 4 can do. The FIFA game that's going to be right on this is
1988520	1994440	based off the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation or Xbox 360 versions of the game. They're still making
1994440	1999400	it for those systems? Wow. Well, it makes sense. It makes sense. Yes, they are updating the
1999400	2004280	rosters for it, but no, it is the version of the game that came out basically in 2012.
2004280	2009400	They haven't updated it since the new systems came out, because the new versions of the game,
2009400	2014920	obviously, are running on a different engine that, once again, the Switch cannot run.
2017240	2021400	Let's see, some folks in chat talking about Ultra Street Fighter 2. Needlecrash says,
2021400	2026520	I'm getting Ultra Street Fighter 2. I was very surprised, but I'm not paying that $40 price tag.
2027160	2031560	So yeah, the Ultra Street Fighter looked really interesting, except it does just look like that
2031560	2040040	HD remix with two additional characters just shoehorned in there. It's like SVC chaos.
2042120	2045720	Not the best comparison. You know, if it's 40 bucks, I'm certainly not going to buy it.
2045880	2052200	The HD edition was only, what, like 20? Maybe. I'm curious about that. Let's see, a couple other
2052200	2057720	comments in chat over at live.vognetwork.com. DungeonBusters brings up Xenoblade 2 and Project
2057720	2063480	Octopath Traveler. Those are some JRPGs that were shown for the system. Yeah, I'm really excited
2063480	2068280	about Xenoblade 2, that's for sure. I hope that's a holiday title. They said that was 2017, so that
2068280	2074760	could be another big release for them for the holiday. We'll see. So anyhow, Loki, we've been
2074760	2078520	bantering a lot in studio about our opinions, and obviously we have some big thoughts here,
2078520	2084040	but I'm curious about any news we might have missed about what's going on on the Switch,
2084040	2087800	like that came out of the press conference we haven't talked about yet. I know one thing,
2087800	2093640	actually, is the whole fact that the virtual console games might be online, which I've been
2093640	2097400	hemming and hawing on this show for forever is something a virtual console should be doing.
2097400	2103000	So the fact that that could actually be happening is really exciting to me. And I know some of you
2103000	2108680	are like, big effin' deal old games, but I'm like, this is gonna be awesome that I can play
2108680	2115560	something like Mario Brothers 3 with my friends who live in another state. I love that idea,
2115560	2119560	so I really hope it's true that the virtual console games are online. And this is not anything
2119560	2122520	they said in the presentation, they haven't really talked about virtual console games.
2122520	2126200	If you go to their website, though, where it talks about the whole one game a month for free,
2126200	2130520	although yes, it has borders as we found out, it talks about that the Super Nintendo games
2131400	2136760	have this online capability, but obviously they're gonna need to detail that in the next,
2136760	2141400	what, six weeks before this thing is out. Seven weeks, I don't know. Somebody give me a calendar.
2141400	2144840	But there's not a lot of time before this thing comes out, so I don't know if they're drip feeding
2144840	2149560	information to try to keep the Switch in the news every week, because that could be something
2149560	2153960	Nintendo's doing where it's like, this next week we'll talk about Netflix, and then we'll talk
2153960	2159400	about the next week virtual console, so that way it keeps bubbling up on the gaming press every
2159400	2164680	single week. That could be Nintendo's strategy leading into March 3rd, I don't know.
2164680	2168760	Or they have no fucking clue on what's going on, because people ask them like,
2168760	2173400	so what does this networking thing have? Well, stay tuned for some more information.
2174200	2178840	Dude, you're fucking selling a console that's coming out in six weeks. Have some fucking details
2178840	2183720	already. We've already been waiting how fucking long to find out the details, and you're dicking
2183720	2188200	me around some more because, oh, I'm sorry, we can't really tell you the details. Ha ha, it's
2188200	2193640	a secret. I mean, fuck you guys, seriously. I kind of think since those things have to already
2193640	2198360	be starting on assembly lines, there's some semblance of what's in that operating system.
2198360	2203160	There has to be, there has to be. We're running out of time. So I do think it's more the drip
2203160	2208280	feed. This isn't, this is an intentional drip feed of information. Nintendo really wanted to
2208280	2212600	steer the conversation to one place after this reveal with all the press they're going to get,
2212600	2215720	and they're going to continue to drive the conversation where they want it to be. That's
2215720	2223960	just, that's how this industry works. It's fucking dumb. It seriously is fucking dumb
2223960	2229080	at this point that they're going to be doing this kind of crap, but whatever. I mean, people are
2229080	2234360	going to buy the shit out of it because it's a Nintendo. Let's see, going to our chat over at
2234360	2239960	live.vognetwork.com, MegaManX400 says, my point overall is that most core gamers are complaining
2239960	2244440	that this won't have the games they want, yet they probably already have one other console already,
2244440	2249080	probably had two consoles last gen. So what's wrong with owning a PS4 and a Switch?
2250040	2253240	Nothing, if you have that kind of money, which not everybody does.
2253240	2256280	Let me put it this way. Here's what's wrong with that. Because as you get older,
2256840	2262120	like before that one, the Xbox 360 gen, I had an Xbox 360, a PlayStation 3, and a Wii.
2263160	2268040	You realize when you have three systems that you're not playing on all three systems,
2268040	2272680	that that's just money basically being thrown away because you end up really gaming on one
2272680	2278120	system or maybe one or two if you're playing those exclusives. Later on, you get smarter and
2278120	2282920	you decide, hey, this gen, I'm not going to buy every single system because you actually sit down
2283640	2287480	instead of getting caught up in the hype, you look at what's coming out for it and like, listen,
2287480	2292440	most of the games are going to be on all these platforms except for this exclusive, this
2292440	2296920	exclusive. What is most important for me to play? And you make your decisions that way because,
2298040	2302440	and once again, yeah, you may pick up a Switch because you want to play some of those Nintendo
2302520	2311080	games, but that's, for me, if I wanted to pick up a Switch, it's the prospect of, hey, I can take
2311080	2316760	games like Skyrim or these other games on the go and be able to play these, I can take my console
2316760	2321800	to work and play it on break or something like that. That's exciting, but I'm not going to be
2321800	2326600	able to play the newest Call of Duty on break on that console because it won't run on it or
2327480	2330680	it's not going to be available for it or it's just going to be Mario games.
2331400	2339160	I just, I, and why would you argue to try to be the second system in a house? Why would you
2339160	2345480	race the second place? That makes no sense. Second, I get you're still the first handheld
2347400	2351000	because everybody else hasn't gotten into the market because tablets are out there because
2351000	2356040	it's maybe not viable for Sony could have Sony still might if this works out.
2356040	2362440	Oh, you know what though? You laugh about that because they try to make a more compact console
2362440	2366440	before, but if they just said, fuck it, we're just going to make this giant tablet like console.
2366440	2371320	To be fair, to be fair, it is still working in Japan and I still kind of failed to see
2371320	2375320	this whole disconnect between why the Vita is not being pushed more here.
2376040	2382120	I'm just saying if they're successful, I mean, it's not unlike Sony and Microsoft to try to
2382120	2386280	copy something, but I think with Microsoft, they wouldn't really do it too much because you have
2386280	2391960	the surface tablets, which are, you know, kind of the surface pros can do some like gaming.
2391960	2396760	So that's almost like this, I guess, you know, you can kind of take it on the go.
2396760	2399560	So that's kind of the equivalent there. Sony doesn't really have anything like that,
2399560	2403960	but I can see them coming out with another handheld system. I mean,
2405240	2409000	who's to say they wouldn't do it if it's insanely popular? I just don't know.
2409000	2414200	And once again, too, you know, remember with the 3DS, they had all these amazing
2414200	2418680	tech pieces that were a part of that, like the whole, you know, that was the thing that
2418680	2424440	got me hyped about the 3DS was like all this, you know, glasses free 3D, which is like pretty
2424440	2429960	awesome. And then the AR stuff, which is pretty awesome. And then they just totally put that to
2429960	2435000	the wayside. It's just a portable system. So, you know, with the Switch, is everybody really
2435000	2438200	taking it as a portable system or we can just like all these extra features that the Joy-Cons
2438200	2441560	can do. We're just going to say, eh, whatever, we're just going to we're just going to game on
2441560	2446440	it and we're not going to do all these games. It's just going to be playing traditional games.
2446440	2447480	Is that bad?
2447480	2452200	It's not bad, but that's but once again, then why put all this stuff, their garbage into your
2452200	2459000	console that's going to cost extra money? I mean, I don't know. I just. I think waiting might be a
2459000	2466120	good idea just because I think everything is just too chaotic right now. We don't know what is it
2466680	2470200	slightly expensive. There's not a lineup of games. It's just.
2472280	2475400	I just don't want to get caught up in the hype. And I felt like when I first placed that preorder
2475400	2478600	that I was kind of getting caught up in the hype and I want to get it in on that. And I was like
2478600	2483480	super excited. And I started like reading up more of it and just like listening to like the
2483480	2487800	information coming back from it. And like, no, this makes any sense. Why? Why am I doing this?
2488520	2488920	I don't know.
2491080	2495080	Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com. Mega Man X 400 says realistically,
2495160	2498840	Nintendo is in last. Should they shoot for first? Yes. Are they going to hit that in one new
2498840	2504680	console? No. So aiming for second might not be bad. Flaco Jones says I do want a system for
2504680	2510840	Splatoon 2 and Mario looks great. Not that it'll actually come out this year. The Immortal Gamer
2510840	2515960	says, man, I love Loki. Not in that way. LOL. He's very rational where I find most aren't.
2517000	2522280	Let's see. YYR says, I see a lot of folks saying I'll wait for a non-portable version with a pro
2522280	2526920	controller for $200. And Maya follows that up with, they'll, they're going to be waiting a
2526920	2532600	while. You know what? You say that, but here's, here's my theory. You know, this is a little bit
2532600	2538120	foil hat, but like VR is still in its infancy right now, but that really takes off. You bet
2538120	2541960	your ass you're going to see a fucking portable version of this. That's going to be 10 AP where
2541960	2547160	they can use VR because 720 P and VR will look like fucking shit. That's never going to happen.
2547160	2551000	You're never going to be able to have like a device to plug it in and have it look nice.
2551000	2554040	So that's where another version of the system will come in.
2554040	2556280	Does Gear VR do 1080?
2557160	2561080	Gear VR, it's a phone resolution. Phones are over 1080 P.
2561080	2561480	Okay.
2561480	2565320	I mean, and you know, the resolution's a lot smaller, smaller screens. So
2567400	2570440	actually, yeah, six inch screen is going to look really weird on your face anyways,
2570440	2576840	but you know, let's just say that you did it. The resolution is just not there for VR,
2576840	2579640	so they're not going to be able to do something like that. But if that takes off,
2579640	2581000	that may be something that they look into.
2581000	2584280	I'm not really, I mean, I can see what you're saying. I'm not really interested in Nintendo
2584280	2588040	getting into the VR game. That pool's got, that pool has too many players in it right now.
2589080	2594280	And so I, I, I just, I'm not really interested in Nintendo's take on VR right now. Like I know,
2594280	2597800	I know that sounds kind of, I don't know, but I just, I'm not really interested in
2597800	2604280	Nintendo's take on VR. Like I want them to focus on building the console and attracting the third
2604280	2609160	parties and, you know, making that console a must have console that separates itself a little bit
2609240	2613400	from Xbox one and PlayStation four, where, you know, a lot of the overlap really is.
2614120	2618680	And a lot of that is due to Nintendo's strong first party and their, the nature that they just,
2618680	2624200	they don't develop for anything, but their own console, except now, of course we have the mobile
2624200	2630040	thing going on. So who knows? I'm very curious to see how that whole thing plays out where you have
2630040	2635400	the mobile phone and the switch thing kind of coexisting because Animal Crossing's future is
2635400	2639000	on mobile device. You know, you didn't hear anything about Animal Crossing on the switch,
2639000	2641800	and I think that's because it's, it's going to now be the mobile thing.
2642360	2645560	Which is too bad because I think it'd be good on the switch style, but.
2646760	2650120	I think it would be, it would be, but also I'm like, if it's going to be the same
2650120	2656040	fucking formula that it was in 2002, then leave it on mobile devices. Cause Animal Crossing
2656040	2660920	hasn't changed enough in those years. Unless the switch is like a new take on it.
2660920	2665480	We haven't mentioned yet the other things that kind of bothered me a bit. 32 gigs of onboard
2665480	2673240	storage. Really? Yeah. I, I got to admit, I was not impressed with that either. I mean,
2674120	2679720	I understand that because this uses cartridges, cartridges, like 3DS has used cartridges.
2679720	2683720	I understand that these things are not going to need to install a bunch of data. Like I'm not
2683720	2687800	going to, allegedly, I'm not going to have a 40 gigabyte install. Like I have on PlayStation
2687800	2694680	four of dragon age or whatever. Like that's just not going to exist in this world. So,
2694680	2699160	I mean, there is that, that, but if you want to download games, where the hell are you going to
2699160	2703160	put them? Micro SD cards? You're going to have to get a micro SD card. Which is fine. At least
2703160	2708040	it's not proprietary. It's still an added expense. You know what? Nintendo should be applauded for
2708680	2715640	non-proprietary stuff like the micro SD. Exactly. Sony didn't do that. USB charging.
2716200	2723400	That's great. And most of all, I think one place where Nintendo should be patted on the ass is the
2723400	2727800	fact that this console is region free. We haven't brought that up yet. Finally, Nintendo is making
2727800	2732760	the right call in that department. We don't live. I mean, the internet has broken down a lot of
2732760	2739560	these walls. Region free is the place to be. And this also means Taiko no Tatujin easily on my
2739560	2745240	Nintendo switch. So yay. Although I guess they are supposedly releasing one locally, Taiko Drum
2745240	2748840	Master, I guess it's going to, so you're going to have two different, you're going to have the
2748840	2756120	US version, the Japanese version anyway, but that's very exciting in my opinion. So let's see.
2757720	2765640	Alan Alchemy in chat says it's the year of our Beyonce 2017. Bidding should start at 64 gigs for
2765640	2772200	a budget model. Let's see. The Immortal Gamer says I'm still smarting for my PlayStation VR purchase.
2772200	2776680	Wonder what I'm going to do with the thing. Act Def says, wait, there's going to be a localized
2776680	2780920	version of Taiko for the switch. I don't quote me on it, but I thought I heard somewhere that
2780920	2784840	there is going to be a US version and a Japanese version, but even if there's not a US version,
2784840	2790040	the good news is I can just import the one from Japan. I can get Dragon Quest 10 from Japan.
2790040	2794680	Not that it's necessarily going to run. And to be fair, they didn't say that region,
2795480	2799400	region free was going to be like a mandatory thing. It sounds like developers could still
2799400	2804040	lock regions out if they wanted to. Although that's not going to be good press if they do,
2804040	2811560	but with Dragon Quest 10 being mostly online, I could kind of see it. Who knows? So anyway,
2811560	2815480	anything else on the switch that we haven't gone over yet that we need to? Loki?
2815480	2823160	I'm trying to think here. Well, they announced colors when it came out so you can get red and
2823160	2828520	blue. I have the gray one on order. Yeah. A lot of my friends are getting the neon red and blue
2828520	2835160	thing, but I'm really bothered by the fact that there's not the consistent color. So I had to get
2835160	2840520	the gray one because it just, it clashes. I don't like that it doesn't match. It's weird. That's my
2840520	2844520	thing. What do you think about the fact that they're not bringing Miiverse or Street Passes
2844520	2849080	to the switch? I almost thought, see, like had I not seen the screenshots or whatever I think
2849080	2854520	from Mario Kart, I thought that they were getting Rameses altogether, which I thought was probably
2854520	2858200	a good thing. Yeah. That is a little weird that they're not bringing Miiverse over.
2859320	2863800	I'm okay with Miiverse not coming over. Miiverse was an interesting concept, but it just,
2863800	2870040	I just, it wasn't a very easy thing to use. Miiverse is fucking clunky. That's my biggest
2870040	2875720	bitch about it. Like I should be able to press a button, but Miiverse like the way it works in
2875720	2882040	practice is horrible. Just like when I bring up my Twitter feed on my smartphone, I hit a button and
2882040	2886600	it's up in under five seconds. Like that's what needs to happen with Miiverse and it doesn't. So
2886600	2895160	I think that's one of my big problems with it. But the Street Pass thing, I kind of like that.
2895160	2902600	So I hope that Nintendo has some type of like substitute. Like I like the idea of you get data
2902600	2906200	from other people that then can be imported in the games. Are we still doing friend codes?
2906760	2912440	Let's hope not. I don't think so. I really don't. I mean, cause, and I would say the reason why I
2912440	2917240	feel that we're not is they're the only ones that does it well, but if you look at what they're
2917240	2922120	doing on the mobile devices, you connect through Facebook or Twitter and you can find your friends
2922120	2927720	and add them. You don't need any type of code. And I feel like that could be where they're going with
2927720	2932120	the switch is that they're just going to leverage existing social media as opposed to try to create
2932360	2938760	their own. I really feel like that's where that's going. So let's see, I'm trying to think if
2938760	2945560	there's any other news. Battery life, was it two to six hours, depending on what you're running?
2946680	2952040	Something's all right. Yeah, I guess that's okay. I mean, that seems comparable to a 3DS.
2952040	2956440	Maybe you're getting a little less life, but. But I mean, that's also going to be something
2956440	2963800	could be solved with third party accessories as well. Then I haven't really seen a lot of
2963800	2968840	details, but I know that, you know, with it running off the battery versus plugged in,
2968840	2976360	there's definitely frame rate issues with that. So I don't know. Can we talk a little bit about
2976360	2981480	Bomberman? Because this is a case of, well, A, it's one of the launch titles on the switch and
2981480	2986200	it's Bomberman and they'll have a lot of people excited. B, it's Konami making a game,
2987320	2992440	which is somewhat, you know, newsworthy in itself. Thoughts on the fact that Bomberman
2992440	2996040	is coming for the switch? Is this something you're excited for? Nope, because fuck Konami.
2996840	3003800	I have to admit, I'm in a similar boat. It looks, it's seriously, it looks average at best and fuck
3003800	3009400	Konami. I'm not going to jump in and buy it day one. If it's something where I watch other people
3009400	3014440	play it and they're having a whole lot of fun and really excited with it, I'll reconsider.
3015000	3019800	But because I have hesitations that Konami is incapable of making a good game anymore,
3020760	3025560	I can't say I'm going to jump in and get a day one. I have Super Bomberman 2 on the Super
3025560	3031400	Nintendo and a multi-tap. Well, there's not just like the fact that you might have the old stuff
3031400	3037080	lying around, but also the last Bomberman I remember getting that was on Xbox live or
3037080	3042040	whatever. I don't remember being that great. You know what I mean? Like I was going to be
3042040	3045560	unpopular opinion time. I kind of think Bomberman is one of those things that's kind of run its
3045560	3049560	course. Well, this one is supposed to have eight player multiplayer. So I guess that can be,
3049560	3056920	all right, that could be cool. I guess, but I mean, I don't know. It just, it, no. And even
3056920	3062520	like the new like street fighter, ultra street fighter two, I'm just like, kind of, is that
3062520	3067240	really the best you got? I mean, is that what you're offering? It's like, you have a brand
3067240	3072680	new console. Let's make a splash with a remaster of a fucking old, I mean, don't get me wrong.
3072680	3077400	Street fighter two is awesome, but come on. I mean, really? Yeah. What's going to elevate
3077400	3083960	this to 2017. I mean, you did street fighter four in the 3DS. I mean, shit, the very least
3083960	3087320	you could do something. I'm still happier at street fighter two than street fighter five.
3088360	3091800	Well, yes. You know, I know it's not going to be street fighter five, but I'm like, come on,
3091800	3099560	you did street fighter four on the, you know, the 3DS. I don't know. It just seems very silly.
3099560	3104040	Um, needle crash in chat says, uh, former Hudson soft employees were involved in making
3104040	3109080	super bomber manner. That's a fair point. Um, you know, they, they paid the people to do it. So
3109080	3115240	again, I'll give it a chance. I'm just not buying it day one. I want to, you know, see the live
3115240	3120280	stream, see my friends playing it, see some of that reaction first before I make a decision.
3120280	3125880	I'm not just going to jump in on nostalgia alone because my hate boner for the direction that that
3125880	3131400	company has been going in for a while now kind of exceeds, um, and my love of BOMBERMAN. Does
3131400	3135720	the joy con have six buttons? Yes. All of them do. There's the tiny, tiny, tiny little LNR.
3135720	3141960	Oh my God. Was it? So yeah, the joy cons, you've got the, the one good joy con and the one janky
3141960	3146520	joy con that has the fucking analog in the middle. That's going to be interesting. That's for sure.
3147000	3151160	Uh, Maya says, can we talk about how insanely awesome that Zelda trailer was? That
3151160	3157320	trailer was like, awesome. Yeah. And to maybe end this discussion on a positive note,
3157320	3162920	that trailer gave me a huge nerd boner. It was awesome. And that was like my, my complaint, you
3162920	3165960	know, before was Zelda was like some of the footage that they're showing, like how they did
3165960	3169800	like that live footage during everywhere. The last like live thing that they did where they
3169800	3174520	stream some like footage of Zelda. It's just kind of like, well, I've already seen this before,
3174520	3180440	but that trailer was fantastic. I'm freaking excited about voice acting in Zelda. Hello.
3180440	3185000	That was amazing to hear. Uh, is that Zelda is going to be getting voice acting now.
3185880	3189720	Yeah, it looks, I mean, it's going to be a fantastic, I have no doubts whatsoever
3189720	3195880	that it gives me fantastic. Yeah. I'm very excited about that. All right. Well, I think
3195880	3199560	in the interest of time, but dark soccer, one more thing. Well, just something,
3199560	3204040	if we are ending the topic, there is something that we need to announce as a thank you.
3204520	3210360	Okay. To one of our listeners, Martin, who gave us all this chocolate. What's that have to do
3210360	3214600	with the switch? Because you were ending the topic. I see. All right. I was moving forward
3214600	3218760	to thank him before we got into stories. That's true. Yes. Thank you for, um, when I decided to
3218760	3223080	start a diet two days ago, thank you for drowning us in chocolate. Although eating one of these
3223080	3227400	right now, I will say what's amazing is that there's actual stroopwafel in there, not the
3227400	3231560	liquor that we were having on the Christmas show, but actual stroopwafels. And that made me go,
3232520	3237800	so, wow. Even Loki's taken something. I never see him. I never see him pull from the food pile.
3237800	3243480	He's a picky eater. What's this banana banana is like a banana cream. And it's super good.
3243480	3250680	That sounds amazing. Can't wait. All right. Uh, let's get into how was your gaming week?
3250680	3254600	Uh, we usually like to do this towards the top of the show. Talk about the types of video games that
3254600	3258760	we have been playing this week. So dark soccer, we'll start with you. How was your gaming week?
3258760	3264040	Wow. Just a lot of world of Warcraft. Pretty much. I haven't really had time for much else.
3264040	3269400	And so not really even a lot of it, just a decent been playing that and then been watching awesome
3269400	3273880	games done quick. Oh yeah. That, that was fun to watch this week. Yeah. Save the animals,
3274840	3279480	which they did. That was the winner. That was interesting to see how that whole
3279480	3285720	bid war played out there. And I'm glad that they, because, um, I had forgotten all about the, um,
3285720	3291080	the Crouch trick for mother brain. And then remembered that, like, I found that by accident
3291080	3296280	years and years ago, but it's, it's awesome. It's a good trick. Yeah. Cool. All right. Uh,
3296280	3301400	Loki, how was your giving week? Um, I tried to place, you know, purposely cause my giving weeks
3301400	3306120	in the last few weeks have been just pretty much the similar. Um, so I tried to play different
3306120	3309320	things this time. I actually played a little bit of PlayStation VR. So actually most of the
3309320	3314200	PlayStation VR that I've been doing is because my wife's been hogging the TV. So I've been using the
3314200	3319720	place Skyrim on because it works as a second screen except my God, can we already fix the
3319720	3325240	stupid screen drifting problem already? Like I hate having the recent or that thing like every
3325240	3330840	minute or so it's just irritating. But other than that, it works all right. And it works great as
3330840	3335960	a screen. Um, I tried this one, they had like a little free, I guess it's like a video or
3335960	3340200	something called Gary, the goal, which is kind of funny. Um, so that I try that out. It's pretty
3340200	3344440	neat. Um, he basically is a seagull that's trying to get you to look away so they could eat your
3344440	3352360	food. Um, so I thought that was kind of cute and it was free. Um, what else? I started, they had
3352360	3356600	the tentacle remastered since that was one of the free games that we got with, um, PlayStation plus
3356600	3362760	this month. So, um, you know, I apparently remember quite a bit of that game and I'm almost
3362760	3367080	already finished with it after just, I can't remember, I couldn't remember how short of a
3367080	3371800	game that is. Um, so I'm, you know, playing through that a little bit. Um, it's still pretty
3371800	3376360	funny. I tried playing with the developer's commentary on and that got irritating really
3376360	3383480	fast. So I had to shut that off, unfortunately. Um, what else? I then of course, you know,
3384200	3389240	Skyrim remastered. I actually finished the whole Dawnguard stuff, or at least the main quest line
3389240	3396520	in Dawnguard. And I've been going through now the main quest line in Dragonborn. So I'll be doing
3396520	3407080	that. And then what else? I've been, uh, mobile wise, I apparently I was watching this, uh, video.
3407960	3413000	It was from, um, some YouTuber and I'm trying to remember the name of their show. It's something
3413000	3418200	that, something with skeletons. I don't remember the name of it, but it's a video game show. Um,
3419160	3422600	but they had mentioned they're all, yeah, at least it's not like that, um,
3422600	3428920	EDF tapper game that you're playing like EDF tapper game. What? And sure enough, there is
3428920	3433240	apparently an EDF tapper game that's on the phone. Oh, it's your two favorite things. I was like,
3433240	3440280	had a baby. Exactly. So of course I had to download it. It's a Tap Wars, um, or at the
3440280	3445320	Fence Force 4.1 or something like that. And it's, it's pretty stupid. And the way they program it,
3445320	3449560	of course you got to love Sandlot. Sandlot, they make, their games are glitchy as shit.
3450200	3456680	And it has not changed one bit. I'm old. It is just, the game is all 2d. It has 2d
3456680	3461800	sprites and I don't know how they got it to run so terribly, but whatever it's Earth Defense Force.
3461800	3466120	And it's also super easy to cheat in because they didn't put any checks whatsoever. It's like,
3467320	3471800	it's like, why am I not even to buy any of your stuff? Because it's just ridiculous. I can just
3471800	3477640	time warp 36 years back and forth and get tons of money. But I mean, it's, it's still a little time
3477720	3482440	waster. It's kind of fun. Um, and then what else did I play? I played a little bit of, um,
3483720	3487880	Ingress. Not too much though. I've been kind of getting burnt out a little bit on that.
3487880	3493400	And then Pokemon Go, I occasionally opened it up, but I haven't really been playing anything on
3493400	3497800	that. Um, I'm trying to think if there's anything else I played. I know I tried playing some other,
3499160	3503800	other PlayStation VR games. Oh, Bound. I tried playing Bound and that game was really weird,
3503800	3509240	except for their camera in that game is shit because you have to constantly, you have to like
3509240	3514360	basically babysit the camera. Cause you can kind of rotate the camera around your character,
3514360	3519560	but it stays fixed in that one spot. So you constantly have to keep refreshing the camera
3519560	3523880	over and over to get your, the fall of your character and just trying to make jumps and stuff
3523880	3529800	with that is really frustrating. The game is gorgeous, but it's confusing as hell what the
3529880	3536280	story is in it. Um, I just, I don't know. It was one of the games that got cheap on one of
3536280	3540680	the bigger flash sales or something, but in PlayStation VR, it's pretty cool. Um, but like
3540680	3545320	I said, the camera is just absolutely terrible. I just, I don't know what the hell they were
3545320	3549160	thinking when they made that. That's it. Were they thinking?
3551800	3555960	It does not make any sense. It really doesn't. Well, before I talk about my gaming week,
3555960	3560600	I do need to mention I ate some of that banana chocolate thing. That's amazing. So thank you,
3560600	3567560	Martin, for sending that to us. I love bananas. So, um, yeah. Yummy. Um, anyway, uh, let's see,
3567560	3571560	uh, my gaming week. So I need to talk about magfest cause you know, I went to this little,
3571560	3575720	little gaming convention on the East coast. Uh, that, uh, was the reason why I wasn't here last
3575720	3581160	week. I had a great time magfest. Um, I didn't, I was a little disappointed in myself because I
3581160	3584680	didn't force myself to play. You know, we weren't doing the video stuff this year cause Bobby
3584680	3589640	couldn't make it. Um, and so I didn't really force myself to play enough of the indie stuff.
3589640	3594600	And every time I was in that area was late at night because that's the best time to do the
3594600	3599160	arcade stuff is like one or two in the morning. And thankfully, since my body was kind of on
3599160	3604120	West coast time, still, I found myself over in that area at like three in the morning and stuff,
3604120	3607640	but like none of the indie people were there and I wouldn't expect them to be. So unfortunately,
3607640	3611720	I just kinda, I kinda missed out on a lot of that stuff. So I apologize. I really should have done
3611720	3616120	a better job trying to find some little gems in the indie thing, but it was just kind of like,
3616120	3622040	I was just going and hanging with my peeps that I went to magfest with, saw a lot of, um, awesome
3622040	3628280	bog people and, and listeners and stuff. Like for example, um, SSG100 Matt had, uh, purchased, uh,
3628280	3633080	bagels for us from New York. And I thought that was really awesome. Uh, I ran into Rama was there.
3633080	3637560	It was his first magfest and I think he had a pretty good time too. And, uh, he had, he,
3637560	3641400	he swung by the liquor store and got me some fireballs. So thank you, sir. We did drink.
3641720	3647000	All that fireball was, it was amazing. Um, and, uh, yeah, just, it was cool getting to see people.
3647000	3650840	And, uh, I did a little more of the concerts this year, actually. I probably saw more, uh,
3650840	3654600	bands than I did the first year. Uh, they didn't have like the journey live or anything,
3654600	3658200	but I still saw some good performances. Uh, I saw the proto men and they were a lot,
3658200	3662680	they were a lot of fun there. Uh, they do a lot of powerful stuff on stage. Um,
3663960	3669400	thought they did a very good job, uh, saw the tail end of bit brigade. Um, when I think they
3669400	3673960	debuted it for the first time, DuckTales, uh, they did the whole plate. Cause you know, they,
3673960	3677960	they played the soundtrack basically while somebody speed running the game. So of course
3677960	3683000	the crowd lost their mind when they started playing the moon. Um, so that was great. So I,
3683000	3688120	yeah, I had a really good time with the concerts. I even saw a couple of panels. Um, and yeah,
3688120	3693640	I really need to make sure that I get to do a panel next year or something so that the people
3693640	3697480	who wanted to meet up on Twitter and stuff, we have a date and a time and a place to do that.
3697480	3701480	Cause I know I miss some people on Twitter that wanted to say hello. So sorry for that,
3701480	3704520	but I will be back. Certainly as long as finances are good and everything,
3704520	3708520	I'll be back for magfest next year. Um, so we can try it all again. And then of course,
3708520	3712440	mag west, as somebody pointed out in chat has come in this year and uh, certainly I'll be going
3712440	3717720	to that. Um, as long as I can juggle that and dragon con that might be pushing it a little bit,
3717720	3721560	but, uh, really looking forward to that. So yeah, I had a great time at magfest. Um,
3722360	3728280	as far as games go, um, a lot of the same stuff I've been playing like Pokemon go,
3728280	3732360	I've been really, really playing more of that. Like I'm actually doing gym battles now because
3732360	3739880	I found it's pretty decent XP. Um, so I'm almost level 27. I'll probably hit level 27 tomorrow
3739880	3743640	if I go on another walk. Um, and that's been good too, is that Pokemon goes really been
3743640	3747960	incentivizing, uh, walking obviously for a catching and just in general catching Pokemon.
3747960	3753080	So, um, trying to get more into doing regular walks thanks to Pokemon go. And I think that's
3753080	3760120	been a great thing. Um, so yeah, almost level 27 in that. So that's exciting. Um, and then, um,
3760120	3766040	I've also been playing a brand new game for me on PlayStation four. And this was a game where I
3766040	3770360	really didn't like the demo. And I said, I'm not going to buy this game cause the demo is garbage,
3770360	3774440	but then a lot of people on Twitter are like, this game is really good. I love this game. It's
3774440	3777400	a lot of fun. And then, you know, I was kind of asking people, so is the demo a good
3777400	3781320	representation? Everybody said no. And then I saw the game was on sale and I said, all right,
3781320	3786120	what the hell I'm going to play world of final fantasy on PlayStation four was, um,
3786120	3791240	the new game I checked out this, uh, past week. And yeah, they're, they're right. The demo was
3791240	3797000	not here. We go again, another JRPG, like Nino Cooney with a shitty demo, but the game itself
3797000	3802040	is, is much better, uh, gives you the better exposition that you need to understand. Why
3802040	3807160	do you stack units on your head? Um, and, and explaining a lot of that and, you know, kind of,
3807160	3811640	kind of ramping up and I don't understand why these demos are not just like the first hour or
3811640	3816120	two of the game, but anyway, um, so if you haven't played world of final fantasy, it's kind of two
3816120	3821640	new characters, uh, that get involved where they are. It's kind of like, it's almost mixed with
3821640	3825240	kingdom hearts cause they're going through these doors to these different worlds, um,
3825240	3828600	that are tied to old file fantasy games. Like in the very beginning of the game,
3828600	3833720	you're in Cornelia from final fantasy one, and you actually are working with princess Sarah and
3833720	3839880	the warrior of light from that game. And so you, um, yeah, you, you kind of do little dungeons and
3839880	3845080	fights. The thing that really surprised me about world of final fantasy is that for a game that
3845080	3849720	looks very chibi and cartoony, and it's kind of like a side game, I was like, it's the difficulty
3849720	3855320	is kind of tough. Like I actually lost, uh, one of the big battles the first time I lost two of
3855320	3859080	the big battles the first time I did them, because you really have to think about like what strategy
3859080	3863880	you're going to use in the battle and you can't just go in there and mash a and expect to win.
3863880	3869800	Um, so yeah, I, I, I've, I've been enjoying world of final fantasy. I'm not sure I love it,
3870360	3875640	uh, because my, my whole like obsessive need to collect everything is kicking in and it's,
3875640	3879400	it's kind of a pain in the butt to collect some things. Cause it's not just like Pokemon. You
3879400	3884120	can't just throw Poke balls at whatever you want. Like you have to, what's called create a prism
3884120	3889720	atunity where you can throw the prism ball or whatever it is at it. And sometimes you can
3889720	3895320	create the prism atunity by just attacking it. But like I'm in an area now where you have to do fire
3895320	3901080	damage to create the prism atunity. Well, that's great, except the monsters that I've been leveling
3901080	3908760	up and using, none of them, no fire. I have ice. I have earth. I have wind. I don't have fire. So
3908760	3912680	you have no captain planet yet. No. So I've got to go back now and level something that
3912680	3916840	does have fire so I can catch these. So that whole micromanaging stuff is gonna,
3916840	3923160	is just gonna annoy the crap out of me. I know it, but, um, I, I like it enough. It's,
3923160	3927080	it's a nice little time filler until, uh, you know, things like the switch and mass effect
3927080	3933240	Andromeda come out. Uh, let's see, uh, Alan alchemy and chat says world of kawaii,
3933240	3936840	weeaboo, desu desu. Yeah. That would be the other thing I would say about the faith,
3936840	3940600	the game is that it's the most weeaboo thing I think I've ever played. Like it's just
3940600	3946440	like the writing and the tropes is just so light. Like my eyes were rolling so hard. I
3946440	3951960	could see my brain. It's like, okay, you ready for an old, uh, OLR reference? You ready?
3951960	3954680	It's like somebody let the 23rd Magus write this game.
3957240	3959080	You know what I mean by that? Right? Dark Sakura.
3961240	3965960	Yes. And I don't even mean him by his new name. I mean the old school 23rd Magus.
3966200	3975000	Anyway. Um, let's see, uh, Maya and Chad says world of final fantasy is cute as hell and
3975000	3979800	got completely swept aside by Pokemon sun and moon. Well, to be fair, Pokemon sun and moon
3979800	3984760	is probably the better game at the end of the day, but world of final fantasy, uh, I misjudged it on
3984760	3989880	the demo. Um, but I, if you're going to put a demo out there, you have to realize a lot of people are
3989880	3995000	going to judge the game based on the demo. So it's no excuse for a crappy demo. Uh, but if you did
3995000	3999320	play the demo and you didn't like it, uh, maybe check out a live stream or a YouTube, something
3999320	4002760	that's going to give you a better sense of the game. Cause I think world of final fantasy probably
4002760	4009880	deserves a little better than the, um, demo it got. All right. Uh, housekeeping. I don't have a
4009880	4014680	lot to say. We don't have any shows off scheduled cause convention seasons finally died down a
4014680	4018520	little bit and we just had a nice big break. So we should be here for the weeks to come.
4018520	4022600	So I will just say, follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR. We're also on Facebook,
4022600	4026040	facebook.com slash orange launch radio. We're on Google plus as well.
4026040	4030200	If there's a social network that you use that we're not on, let me know and we'll get there.
4030200	4034680	I guess we don't have Snapchat. That's that's one thing I've been using. I use it personally,
4034680	4038200	but I don't, we don't have an OLR thing on Snapchat. Maybe that's, maybe that'll be in
4038200	4044120	the future. Who knows? Anyway, let's get to some other gaming news. Yes. Other things happened
4044120	4051960	this week that weren't necessarily the switch, right? Loki. Um, yeah, I guess I, I mean,
4051960	4058680	it's pretty much just the switches sweep. So, um, then Reggie, when asked, you know,
4058680	4064680	cause the switch stuff. So what's going on with, uh, the NES classic edition? Well,
4064680	4069400	he says stock is going to be getting better. Uh, they're not going to have shortages on the switch
4069400	4074120	like they did with the classic click edition, but they're going to be continuing to get it back in
4074120	4078760	stock. Um, which actually I do have to pick up one, which I think we have as another story
4078760	4086200	regarding my motivation of why I want to pick up one now, but, uh, yeah. So apparently
4087080	4094840	want to see whether that actually ends up changing. I don't know. I have to admit I'm,
4094840	4098680	especially now that I'm on board with a switch, I really, I'm going to just totally pass on this
4098680	4103880	NES classic. I really don't need one at this point, you know, and I kind of felt that way
4103880	4106600	anyway, towards the end of last year, but I was like, well, maybe if I come across one,
4106840	4112200	it's funny as I was watching the task bot section of, um, AGQ, uh, you know, awesome
4112200	4117080	games done quick. Um, and they were seeing that the switch or the switch to the, uh,
4117080	4121960	classic edition is actually a Linux PC that's running, um, some sort of shell and stuff on it.
4121960	4127960	And so the way the controls get translated, it actually takes the, um, classic, uh, the
4127960	4132920	Wii controls or whatever and converts them into Xbox buttons because that's how it's built into
4132920	4139160	the Linux thing, which I thought was funny. It was funny. So pretty cool. Um, well, uh,
4140040	4145240	did they say at all, like how they know they're not going to have switched supply problems?
4145240	4150760	Cause I'm kind of like, prove it, you know, but then again, I was able to pre-order two
4150760	4155960	consoles, so I guess that's already better luck than the NES classic. So here's, there's excuse,
4155960	4161000	which makes no goddamn, well, it makes goddamn sense, but it's also a terrible excuse. Um,
4161000	4165160	so he's basically saying that it makes sense, but I don't like it. It makes sense. But is
4165160	4168760	it the fucking line that they give us? And I don't believe it at this point, um, basically said,
4168760	4174440	you know, with the classic edition that the global demand, um, was well in excess of anything they
4174440	4180360	had anticipated. So they had only expected 30 to 40 year olds to pick up the machine.
4182200	4189320	Really? And a lot of other people did, which I say to that, even if he only thought 30,
4189320	4192760	the 40 year olds are picking up the system, you still didn't put enough fucking systems
4192760	4195960	out there because how many 30 of the 40 year olds do you think are fucking out there?
4197080	4203560	I mean, really? It's a bunch of shit. Hello. Look at this show. Come on. This is what they say.
4203560	4210520	Every fucking time a system comes out. Oh, we didn't anticipate the people would like the thing.
4211800	4217320	Bullshit. Bullshit. Does this mean they are going to over anticipate the demand?
4217320	4221560	No, they won't. No, they won't. They will under anticipate it again because they,
4221560	4227160	Oh, we didn't know it was going to be so successful. If only we knew how successful
4227160	4233560	all of our Nintendo products were. I mean, those pat themselves on the back and pull this shit.
4234840	4238200	Whatever. I don't know. Maybe there won't be a huge shortage because there's not any games
4238200	4244920	coming out for it. A holiday again. I still holiday. That's still how many months away?
4244920	4249080	Yes. It's over 10 months away. Let's see what happens at E3. Anyway.
4250440	4253800	Here's a game that won't have any shortage problems because it got canceled. Nobody's
4253800	4258280	going to play it. Um, I think, I think, uh, Microsoft can probably thank Nintendo for
4258280	4263880	shifting the conversation at the end of the week. So maybe people will forget how much it stings
4263880	4270120	that they heard that scale bound was canceled. That's right. Scale bound, uh, platinum games
4270120	4275880	developed action RPG that was shown off at E3, um, has been canceled. It's not going to happen.
4275880	4281320	Uh, so folks that were really excited to see this title on the Xbox one, uh, were understandably a
4281320	4286680	little upset. Uh, anyhow, Microsoft did say, quote, after careful deliberation, Microsoft
4286680	4291160	studios has come to the decision to end production for scale bound. We're working hard to deliver an
4291160	4297000	amazing lineup of games to our fans this year, including Halo Wars 2, Crackdown 3, State of Decay
4297000	4301640	2, Sea of Thieves, and other great experiences. Hey, did you hear that? Loki Crackdown 3 is going
4301640	4306040	to happen this year. Finally. Yeah, I'm sure it is. I'll believe when I see it. Unfortunately,
4306040	4310040	scale bound will not be, and it's not just the fact that they canceled scale bound, but they're,
4310040	4315880	Microsoft's actually like yanking trailers and they're actually like pulling scale bounds. I
4315880	4320760	mean, all the stuff that was officially out there is getting rid of it. Now, obviously once on the
4320760	4325880	internet, always on the internet and a lot of gaming sites are just, you know, are reproducing
4325880	4329880	the trailer this week for everybody to, uh, experience disappointment and knowing that
4329880	4336200	they're never going to play this game anyway. Um, so there it is. Scale bound got canceled.
4336200	4340120	Um, thoughts, Loki, was that something you were interested in scale bound? What about you guys in
4340120	4346360	chat? You weren't, you weren't interested in it. No, I thought it looked like some weird devil may
4346360	4354680	cry dragon game. I thought it was interesting, but I'm not surprised. Why not? It's a new IP.
4356360	4360920	So there's, if it doesn't already have the interest behind it, that making more sequels
4360920	4365880	do, what's the point? Well, but it is platinum games who, you know, at least they kind of have
4365880	4371240	that record behind them. So, but I don't know. I mean, again, it, you know, whatever rumors or
4371240	4376760	things you want to believe, but it sounds like Microsoft's aggressive production schedule and
4376760	4381160	tactics may have not meshed well with platinum games and the way they've developed for other
4381160	4387080	consoles in the past. Uh, who knows? Uh, let's see, uh, stopping and chat says, wasn't interested
4387080	4391480	in scale bound, looked like a poor man, Xena blade, uh, dungeon Buster says, sad news about
4391480	4396120	scale bound. It was Kamiya's passion project. Yeah. And you know, as much as I'm like, Oh,
4396120	4400360	bummer, because I would have liked to see more like Japanese developed things on X-Box one.
4400360	4405560	Cause it's, it's where it's sorely lacking. I also really tried not to buy into the hype too much.
4405560	4410520	And you notice this is something I've been learning to do in games is to try not to
4410520	4416440	buy into hype of games that are not going to be out for four more years too much because things
4416440	4421720	change, uh, things get canceled and so forth. So, you know, and I'm not perfect. I still get
4421720	4428200	suckered into hype once in a while, but I tried very hard to not get my hopes too up for scale
4428200	4432120	bound based off a trailer or two. I mean, do we ever really see game play from scale bound?
4432120	4435240	Yeah, we did. Did we? Yeah. I just don't, I just don't remember it. I mean, there's,
4435240	4439640	it's been like, it was the last C3 of the show that I don't remember if that was last year's
4439640	4444440	E3 or the year before that, but we did see it. Okay. Well, not that, not that that would
4444440	4448600	necessarily match what ends up in the game. I mean, look at No Man's Sky, Final Fantasy 15,
4448600	4453960	you know, those, those things change. So, uh, and Bobby Blackwell saying there was co-op
4453960	4459000	gameplay at this year's E3. It had four player co-op against a boss. So, all right. It's just
4459000	4464920	one of those things I just forgot, which I guess happens. So, all right. But scale bound,
4464920	4468440	unfortunately, uh, not coming out for those that were looking forward to it.
4469000	4471560	Uh, Dark Sakura, hopefully this game doesn't get canceled, right?
4472280	4475960	Mass Effect Andromeda. A little late now to cancel that.
4476520	4480520	Yeah. Well, they do. I will go to Montreal and scream in French.
4482600	4487160	Uh, we'd have to go look back up how to scream the insults I'd want,
4487160	4493000	but I'm sure I could remember. So, um, the first thing that a lot of people care about,
4493000	4496360	banging. Banging is supposed to be pretty good.
4498120	4506440	Who am I fucking in Mass Effect Andromeda? Everyone, uh, the, uh, the question was, um,
4507480	4516680	put in, uh, Twitter is, uh, how, who you could bang. And the reply was so many and the banging
4516680	4521160	is pretty good. So they're taking the same approach. I like it.
4523000	4527800	Let's bone some aliens. I would like to, I would like to play a Mass Effect where I can bang more
4527800	4533000	than one person too. I'm sure you'll be able to. That would be, that would be fun. Yeah. But here's
4533000	4542520	what we know about Andromeda so far. It will be quite cinematic, quite cinematic. No shit.
4542520	4548840	It takes place between Mass Effect two and three, as we know. New characters. Of course we have new
4548840	4554680	leads. Um, and your ending in Mass Effect three doesn't matter because they're not going to be
4554680	4560440	there for it. So it doesn't matter if you picked which space magic ending happened, space magic
4560440	4565720	happens. Just deal with it. It isn't. I mean, I don't think this is spoilers when this is the
4565720	4570920	whole concept of the game, but isn't the whole idea that somewhere between Mass Effect two and
4570920	4577560	three humanity, or, or I guess, you know, the, the, uh, alliances out there in the galaxy said,
4577560	4583960	what if the Reapers do win this and put a bunch of people on a ship and flung them to the Andromeda
4583960	4590680	galaxy, 600 light years away where they could basically continue humanity just in case, um,
4591320	4596520	the Reapers did wipe everybody out. Yeah. Mission objective, continue humanity, bang as many people
4596520	4601480	as you can. It's like the plot of that, uh, Matthew McConaughey movie from a couple of years
4601480	4607320	ago. Now that was a spoiler by the way. Sorry. I don't know that movie. It was, it was interesting.
4607720	4614920	Bang. Was he, um, perhaps driving in Lincoln in that movie? No, he was, he was hiding in a
4614920	4620680	bookshelf the whole time. Come just come to find out he was fucking the bookshelf. Actually kinda.
4620680	4623960	Yeah. But again, I don't want to ruin it for people who haven't seen it, but it's been out
4623960	4627480	for like, I still haven't seen it, but I was up on spoilers. The name of the movie you're talking.
4627480	4631720	I don't, I think the interstellar was that it was interstellar. Yeah. That's it. Was it Matt Damon
4631720	4636520	in that one? And did he also need to be rescued? Um, yes. Now I could get really spoilery if you
4636520	4640760	want, but some listeners might start getting pissed off. So anyway, multiplayer is coming
4640760	4647720	back from Mass Effect Andromeda, but it's going to be more like, um, how it works in Dragon Age
4647720	4654360	Inquisition, where you can have your multiplayer characters do missions. Um, and you can, you
4654360	4660920	actually do have the ability to do multiplayer, but it's not going to be as intensely the way it
4660920	4666440	would affect the campaign like it did in Mass Effect 3. Um, also you have destructible cover
4666440	4675480	in the game, so your cover can get shot to pieces and you have to move and banging. Um, you also.
4676520	4680200	I was going to say the multiplayer isn't as intense because it's just the banging.
4681800	4685640	It's a rhythm game. Yeah. Little did you know though, it is going to be coming out for the,
4685640	4690200	uh, Nintendo switch and it's going to focus on the multiplayer mode where you basically
4690200	4696680	milk each other with those HD rumble controllers over and over again. I think I saw some YouTube
4696680	4701320	or something where somebody was doing that and like playing and the actual switch demo and went
4701320	4707000	like, this feels like jacking somebody off. And I was like, we're all thinking it girl.
4707000	4712520	Well, rather than go through all the stuff that we really do already know is the one thing that
4712520	4720280	they showed in, um, one of the previews was how the, um, the class system works that you can switch
4720280	4727480	your classes on the fly. And that's pretty cool. That's very useful. Do you do a costume change
4727480	4732680	when this class switch happens? You turn into Sailor Moon and I hope you do a twirl and that,
4732680	4738200	you know, J-pop plays all things happening. And then there will be crafting. Stop being
4738200	4745080	in chat says in space, no one can hear you moan. Wouldn't that, wouldn't that actually be in space?
4745080	4751480	No one knows you're coming. And this is something about the ending being a very big surprise
4752040	4756840	as in not having the paths when they were asked about it. So who knows? Maybe it'll be
4756840	4761160	more subtle. And yes, I did ignore the question. They're all pregnant. You have the whole paid
4761160	4766600	child support for all of those babies. Surprise. Congratulations. You got everybody pregnant.
4767560	4776360	I know they do have krogan's. Anyway, although technically that krogan would be around them
4777240	4783320	and not have been present for the genophage cure. Oops. I'm going to, I'm going to say now,
4783320	4787720	keep in mind the game isn't out. So we have no idea what the ending actually is. You ready for
4787720	4792760	my, um, you know, y'all wanted a twist day. You ready for my twist ending for Mass Effect Andromeda?
4793000	4797160	Okay. It's going to be like the ending for enterprise. The whole thing was a
4797160	4800600	fucking holodeck simulation. That's going to be the ending of the game.
4801480	4803560	So when was that coming out again? Was that a March title?
4803560	4807560	Yeah. End of March, March 21st. So it's like two or three weeks after the switch.
4810200	4815240	So I don't think it's getting canceled now at this point. There will be sex in outer space.
4815240	4819240	But with all these like big titles coming out in March and stuff, it's like, who's going to
4819320	4821720	pay attention to the switch coming out? I mean,
4821720	4829000	Well, I figure I have a good three weeks to beat Zelda and then that's it. My switch will be used
4829000	4832280	if I'm going to go to somebody else's house for like a party type thing or something. But I
4832280	4837880	wouldn't be playing Mass Effect at a place like that anyway. So Mass Mass Effect will be my
4837880	4843240	alone time. That'll be, that'll be when it's dark in the house, you know, so I can see the stars
4843880	4850680	in outer space. Uh, Tiger call wants to know, will Mass Effect Andromeda have an ED type character?
4851640	4858200	I'm sure. Um, let's see. SSU 100 Matt says, Rob, real talk, finish Zelda. You,
4858200	4862200	Hey, I'm going to try. I beat, I beat Final Fantasy 15. Okay.
4862200	4865240	I beat a game this year. Finally. There's hazelnut cream in here.
4868360	4871560	And that's the ending of Mass Effect. I haven't even played Final Fantasy 15,
4871560	4874680	aside from that five minutes. And I have had no desire to so far.
4875960	4879160	That's the ending of Mass Effect Andromeda. They go to the moon and they find
4879160	4883480	it's made of hazelnut cream and then dark soccer is there just licking the surface.
4887480	4893400	Uh, anyhow, uh, let's move on Loki. What do you have for us before we get to the classic game of
4893400	4899320	the week? Um, some more, you know, comments regarding the whole Oculus versus ZeniMax
4899320	4904600	trial that's supposed to be happening. Um, Oculus made a statement, um, because I remember for this,
4904600	4909800	it was ZeniMax saying that they had the hard drives or something and something because of
4909800	4915160	the hard drives that they had a strong case. Well, now Oculus is saying, bring it bitch.
4915160	4919720	And so they basically said, no, where are you going to present our case in court? Oculus and
4919720	4924040	founders have invested a wealth of time and money in VR. And we believe that we can, it can
4924040	4928280	fundamentally blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. We're disappointed in other companies using
4928280	4933080	the wasteful litigation to attempt to take credit for technology. It did not have a vision,
4933080	4943400	expertise, or patience to build. So we'll see. I should have had the people's court theme to play
4943400	4948680	behind you as you were talking. And ZeniMax is seeking $2 billion in damages, which is equal to
4948680	4955320	the amount of money that Facebook got or gave them, which hmm. So these things almost always end in a
4955320	4958760	settlement, but not this time. Like this is, this is going to go all the way, going to go all the
4958760	4964120	way, all the way. Judge Judy's going to render a verdict on this. Yeah. I mean, they were saying,
4964120	4968360	you know, because of the whole hard drive thing, they were saying there's not a line of ZeniMax
4968360	4973560	code or any of its technology in any of the Oculus VR products. Indeed ZeniMax had never
4973560	4979000	identified any stolen code or technology in any of the Oculus VR products. Although
4979000	4983640	ZeniMax had full source of the Oculus VR software for over a year and a half,
4983960	4989640	having received it indirectly from Oculus VR well before it was even released publicly
4990440	4997320	and have, and could have analyzed it online at any time on the Oculus developer website.
4998040	5002920	I don't know. It'd be interesting to see how this plays out. William Murderface in chat says,
5002920	5007640	maybe Oculus will also be smart and distance themselves from Palmer Lucky. We can hope anyway.
5007640	5012120	Just make that guy take the fall. Just say it was all his fault. Well, he's, he's not even involved
5012120	5016600	in the company anymore. So I don't, he's, he's kind of disappeared recently. I can't imagine why
5017480	5023560	anyway. Uh, all right, let's get to the new story to which Loki earlier referred before we get to
5023560	5026680	the classic game of the week. This is a good story to lead into it. You know what we say here at
5026680	5032360	Orange Lawn Radio, hackers going to hack and sure enough with the NES classic edition, guess what
5032360	5038520	happened? Uh, one Russian hacker opened the system up and put more games on it. In fact, there's a
5038520	5043480	screenshot floating around out there with Mass Effect, excuse me, Mass Effect 3 and 4, Mega Man
5043480	5050920	3 and 4. What a twist. You were fucking Mega Man the whole time. Uh, Mega Man 3, 4 and 5 and 6,
5050920	5057160	and all these Mega Man games are actually installed on this NES mini. It was all posted
5057160	5062520	on Reddit in English and talks about how you do it, where you basically connect the PC
5063400	5068920	via a USB cable to the NES classic mini, you boot the NES mini into the film mode,
5068920	5073880	then you unpack the system kernel, add your ROMs, repack the kernel and flash the system.
5073880	5079160	Now doesn't that sound dangerous? That's because it is, and you could fuck up your NES classic
5079160	5083000	if you do this wrong. I don't think you would be able to. I think you would imagine you'd be
5083000	5088200	able to reflash it with, you know, this, the copy of the whole ROM or whatever, but
5089160	5092040	a lot of people have done it. I want to do it once I get mine.
5092680	5096280	Now, uh, apparently it tops out at 60 games, the UI.
5097320	5100520	Baby, I think you could fit more than that though. I think they found a way.
5100520	5106040	There is 512 megs of storage, so you can fit, uh, more on there. And apparently modders have
5106040	5110840	already added Famicom to support. That was going to be my question is what if you try to put games
5110840	5115320	on here that it didn't, they didn't put, because if I remember right, the old NES from what I
5115400	5120120	remember way back in the emulation days in college, I used to get more involved with this
5120120	5124600	stuff when the Nintendo emulation was first getting out there. Like when Nesticle hit
5124600	5129000	and everybody was losing their fucking mind because that thing ran like flawlessly on a 486.
5129000	5134360	So, um, if I remember right, you have all these different mappers that the old Nintendo games are
5134360	5139480	on. And to emulate different games, you have to be able to reproduce different mappers, basically.
5139480	5143800	A lot of the old Nintendo games run on like the first or third mapper or something like that.
5143800	5148920	But there was a total of like, I think like over 200 mappers. Some of them were for very obscure
5148920	5155560	types of games, like 64 in one pirate type games. But I remember some games had really weird mappers
5155560	5159560	and like, like Castlevania three, I think was one of them where like, if you didn't emulate it
5159560	5164840	right, then the vertical level would be all screwed up. Now, granted, uh, Castlevania three
5164840	5170120	is one of the games on this thing, right? Well, no, it's one and two, not three. Yeah. So,
5170440	5177320	hmm. Anyway, I just, I would be curious if the system is even capable of emulating everything.
5177320	5180200	It's a Linux PC. I'm sure they can do something with it.
5181160	5186680	Uh, Stoppy in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, don't worry, you can trust the hack,
5186680	5191960	since when have Russian hackers done us wrong? That is exactly what I've been thinking.
5192760	5195720	Right? The moment you said Russian hacker, I'm like, fuck.
5196680	5202680	Anyhow, we can't blame all hackers that are from Russia for stuff like now. Now,
5202680	5207720	why did suddenly my NES classic vote in the last election? I don't understand anyway. Oh,
5207720	5213080	I can't. It doesn't have any internet built into it because God forbid we'd ever have the
5213080	5218440	forethought to purchase stuff. Who knew that Nintendo's forethought of cutting off online
5218440	5223240	was going to save us all anyway. Oh, wait, they didn't save us. We're doomed. Anyway. Uh,
5223880	5228360	something else to consider is that, uh, when these hackers went in there, well, not when these
5228360	5234440	hackers went in there, but, uh, apparently other hackers have found that there was a secret message
5234440	5240840	inside the Famicom version of the NES classic edition. Uh, that's right. A Japanese modder
5240840	5246040	apparently went into the system and found that there was a cute little, little message hidden
5246040	5249480	in the coding when they were, you know, getting in there, trying to inject whatever software they're
5249480	5253720	going to put in there. And the message said, this is the Hanafuda captain speaking,
5253720	5258760	launching emulation in three, two, one, many efforts, tears, and countless hours have been
5258760	5263880	put into this jewel. So please keep this place tidied up and don't break everything. Cheers,
5263880	5269080	the Hanafuda captain. Well, you know, that Nintendo started off as a, um, Hanafuda, um,
5269080	5272680	manufacturer, which are playing cards in Japan. If you didn't know that, but yeah,
5272680	5278520	very interesting. It's a cute message. And also kind of interesting that at least somebody over
5278520	5282680	there knew hackers are going to get into this thing. Like the people developing this new,
5283400	5287640	they, they had to know as gamers, like, Oh, I'm surprised that no one's extracted the emulator
5287640	5291320	out of this thing being that it's based off Linux. You would think that they build extract.
5291960	5298200	I mean, you've got a pretty good emulator for Nintendo titles. I mean, I think people would
5298200	5301720	want to get ahold of that and they've already kind of exploited a little bit.
5303160	5307720	So I think, I think it's really cute that, uh, they, they put this little message in there. So,
5307880	5311800	yeah, that's, that's been making rounds on the internet. You know, what else is cute
5311800	5313720	is the segment we do here on this show every week,
5315880	5321960	starring the very cute dark Sakura or Jamie summers. Oh, you flatter. You'll get me everywhere.
5322520	5327160	This is a segment where dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks,
5327160	5333000	Hey, you brats should be checking out this game, the classic game of the week. But wait a minute,
5333080	5340040	wait a minute. Y'all wanted a twist day. You've decided new year, new you. So we already talked
5340040	5344600	about the classic system of the week. You're not doing that this week, but you've decided,
5344600	5347400	you know what we're going to do. I want to do, I want to do something different with
5347400	5352760	this segment this year into gaming mystery. I see. So now I, now I need the unsolved
5352760	5357880	mysteries theme except I don't have a handy, but you could play spooky. All right. I don't know
5357880	5361560	if I have that one either. All right. But anyway, so this is a little different. What is different?
5361560	5369000	What is the classic game of the week? Polybius and I don't think I've played that game.
5369000	5375320	And no one's played that game. It's an urban legend. Um, but it was worth mentioning
5375880	5385400	because it's, it's one of the first gaming related urban legends, one of them. And basically
5385400	5390440	the particular, the whole thing about the game is that it was rumored to have induced different
5390440	5396200	psychological effects on people like amnesia, night terrors, and even getting people to stop
5396200	5405000	playing games at all. So it was Yaris. Yes, it was Yaris. And they said that it was released in 1981
5405000	5411480	and then a month later disappeared without a trace. No evidence that it ever existed apart
5411480	5418120	from just people talking about it. And a few other things. Now the name Polybius comes from
5418120	5425320	a Greek historian and the historian himself stated that historians should never report
5425320	5431400	what cannot be verified through witness, through witnesses. People have to have seen it. So the
5431400	5437400	name itself is its own irony because there are no true witnesses to the game's existence. Did you
5437400	5441640	pick this because of that thing going around on Facebook where everybody remembers that Sinbad
5441640	5447160	was in this movie that never fucking existed, but people swear up and down they saw Sinbad in a
5447160	5453960	movie that actually starred Shaquille O'Neal, right? Which movie? Wasn't it like Shazam? Like
5453960	5457880	everybody is convinced that Sinbad had a version of that called like- Did you see that Victoria
5457880	5461960	met him and asked him about it? I did, right? He apparently thought it was funny. Well,
5461960	5466440	apparently his reaction was he thinks it's funny and in the good old American way that you know
5466440	5473720	Sinbad's gonna do, his plan is to profit from it. His plan is to, I don't know, apparently gonna
5473800	5478600	make- It's the same thing as people remembering the Berenstain Bears being the Berenstein Bears.
5481000	5484360	Are those the same bears that are in the commercials wiping their assholes selling
5484360	5487560	toilet paper? Are those the Berenstein Bears? That's the shitstain bears.
5492840	5500840	They voted for Trump too. Stop it. Polybus. Anyway, the first documented reference about it was
5501800	5509080	an anonymous entry into coinop.org that was published on August 3rd, 1998. It mentions
5509080	5517640	that Polybius had a copyright date of 1981. The author said they had a ROM image of the game
5518520	5526040	and have extracted text from it, including a 1981- I'm going to mispronounce this because
5526040	5536200	I don't know German very well. Sine Schlosschen, which in the remainder of the information was
5536200	5542360	unknown in the about this game section had the rumors that made up the legend of the game.
5543640	5551000	And then there was also a notice about it having appeared in Portland, Oregon in 1981.
5551640	5557720	And it was so popular that it was addicting with lines forming from it,
5557720	5563240	and people fighting over who got to play next. Hey, nobody fights in Portland, first off.
5563240	5570920	This is the 80s. They might have fought, you know. Anyway, they also said that the machines
5570920	5578360	were visited by men in black that would get data from the machines to test for psychoactive effects.
5579240	5583640	And people, you know, like I said, they were saying there was amnesia, insomnia, stress,
5583640	5589800	night terrors. And then that one person became an anti-gaming activist. So basically,
5589800	5596600	Tipper Gore played it one day. No, that was the songs. Jack What's-As-Fuck played it.
5597160	5598120	Jack Voldemort?
5598120	5611000	Yeah. Now, the name Sine Schlosschen came from an odd German combination of words, a portmanteau
5611640	5617800	that combined sine, which is senses, and lochten, which is to extinguish. So it's
5617800	5627800	basically considered a sensory deprivation game. Now, of course, there are the origin of this
5628280	5637240	might come from what was described by an author named Brian Dunning, who said that he thinks that
5637240	5644520	it happened from players in Portland that fell ill on the same day in 1981 when having a migraine
5644520	5650600	after playing Tempest, and another one who played Asteroids for 28 hours in an attempt to break a
5650600	5661320	world record. There are also notices from the FBI that they raided video game arcades 10 days
5661320	5668280	later, but they were looking for gambling machines. And as we know, there's been an ongoing issue,
5668280	5675480	you know, especially in the 70s and 80s, where anti-gambling laws were affecting arcades. Well,
5675480	5681880	we just have the deal with pinball now being available in some areas because of all that.
5684040	5691400	The other thing, too, is that this myth actually might have been the inspiration for The Last
5691400	5700680	Starfighter. Hmm. Because, you know, it has a video game that's meant to test the reflexes
5700680	5710840	of somebody to be recruited into the galactic thing. And also, it was said that sine lotion
5710840	5717080	was the kind of word that a non-German speaker would create for something if they were using
5717960	5725080	an English to German dictionary. I like that. So, Polybius did get some attention from Gang Pro
5725080	5734040	back in 2003 that was in an article called Secrets and Lies. Snopes has also debunked it,
5734040	5743800	apparently. A few, you know, a few other facilities have tried to debunk it, of course.
5744440	5751160	But in the Portland Retro Gaming Expo, October 5th, 2013, there was a...
5751160	5752840	Always fucking Portland with this game.
5753800	5760280	Yeah. There was a limited run of a Polybius game that was made to use for the Atari 2600.
5760280	5768120	Guy named Chris Trimloo made it. He is the owner of Lost Classics. And it's basically all DIY.
5769240	5773800	It was based off of descriptions of the game. So, it is a game.
5773800	5779080	Now it is a game. I see. Because I was gonna say, do you know how hilarious it's gonna be
5779160	5783240	that you made a game that doesn't even exist, the class that gave it the week before Halo?
5783240	5788040	But this game does exist now. It does. Well, and I... Technically not 10 years old because
5788040	5796920	it was DIY in 2013, thus violating the rules. 2003. Oh, that was 13. Now, for you PlayStation
5796920	5806280	VR people, there is... Jeff Minter announced that he's doing Polybius for PlayStation VR.
5806280	5810680	And I'm sure that'll be quality. Well, but it's in VR. So, you know, it might...
5810680	5812920	So it must be good. It's just a Portland simulator.
5814760	5820840	But there have, of course, you know, Polybius has been so ingrained in gaming culture though,
5820840	5824920	even, you know, people who didn't know of the rumor, at least recognize the name.
5824920	5828040	And not just people who studied Greek history and philosophy.
5829960	5835720	There was a mention of it in The Simpsons in the Please Homer Don't Hammer Him episode.
5835720	5842600	There was a Polybius cabinet that was in an arcade and it had a single button
5842600	5850600	and printed the words property of US government. It's shown up in like a couple issues of Batman.
5850600	5856440	It showed up in the House of Mystery. One of Vertigo comics on a T-shirt.
5858360	5865000	It was part of the plot for Doomsday Arcade, which is a series by Escapist magazine.
5866440	5870440	It's even in Hackslash. Splatterhouse, it's even in Splatterhouse. So...
5872360	5876120	I mean, not in Splatterhouse. That issue was inspired by Polybius and Splatterhouse,
5876120	5879800	my apologies. And then there's a modern day sequel to Polybius
5882440	5889240	that's in a plot of a story called Out of Order that was, again,
5889880	5892840	in Portland themed stories called City of Weird.
5892840	5899160	So, one last thing. In Farming Simulator 17,
5899880	5904440	near Field 1 and 6, there's a broken arcade game that says Polybius is the title.
5906200	5909240	There it is. Your classic game of the week.
5909240	5915080	You know what that actually stands for, right? That name stands for multiple Starbucks on
5915080	5918760	different quarters. There's more than one. That's important.
5918760	5920680	Wow. Let's see.
5920680	5923480	ActDeftInChat over at live.fognetwork.com says,
5923480	5929000	It would have been fantastic that Polybius VR released and it had Frog Fractions 2.
5929000	5931960	Sadly, that won't be the case. Yeah, if y'all didn't hear,
5931960	5937320	in the past few weeks since we last had a show, Frog Fractions 2 is finally out there
5937320	5940280	in the wild. It's real. The jig is up. All that stuff.
5940280	5945240	So, it's hidden in a game called, what was it? Glittermitten? Glitter Grove?
5945240	5948200	Glittermitten Grove. That's it. On Steam.
5948440	5953080	Which is this whole other simulator game, and then you play that and there's tricks you do,
5953080	5958040	and Frog Fractions 2 is actually in that game. And do you know what a lot of the early stuff
5958040	5961880	in Frog Fractions 2 is directly influenced by, Loki? ZZT.
5962680	5966280	Like, a lot of the early stuff are ZZT levels that you play in Frog Fractions 2.
5966280	5971800	It's pretty fucking amazing. Well, I posted a link to one of the
5972360	5981400	articles about the game. And it's got some of the pictures of the logo and screenshots that
5981400	5986040	people have supposedly taken. So, they've gotten a logo from somewhere.
5986760	5992440	You know? It just seems to me that I think that this is...
5995480	5999000	First of all, if you've ever watched any of that ROM footage that's out,
5999240	6006200	it would give me a seizure. But it's just too bizarre that
6006200	6010680	it has to be mentioned as a classic game. Because even for a game that didn't exist,
6010680	6015960	it's been a big influence. Dark Tetsuya in chat says about
6015960	6022360	Frog Fractions 2, the easiest way to get it in Glittermitten Grove is to type apostrophe butts.
6022920	6027480	I had no idea that that was the thing. So, all you have to do is type apostrophe butts,
6027480	6031720	and that's how you get into Frog Fractions 2. And SSG100Matt says,
6031720	6035960	Frog Fractions 2 is out. Now that this is cleared away, Half-Life 3 can come out.
6035960	6041000	Well, try typing apostrophe butts in a different Valve game. Try typing apostrophe butts in Dota 2
6041000	6045960	and see what happens. The new experience. Just flood the chat with butts, butts, butts,
6045960	6050520	butts. But don't blame us when you get banned. All right. We're going to take a break. We have
6050520	6055320	plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come, though, including... Oh, and Dark Tetsuya says you don't
6055320	6058760	need the apostrophe. He was trying to put it in quotes. You just type butts. That's all you have
6058760	6065640	to... Just type butts. That should be an unlock code in every game. Can we put that on vognetwork.com
6065640	6069480	somehow if you type in butts? You get, like, loot or something.
6069480	6072680	You get a fraction of a frog. Bobby's going to hate me for even proposing that. All right.
6073240	6076280	Anyway, we're going to take a quick break. When we come back, though, we're going to have some
6076280	6081000	rapid-fire news, of course. The mailbag. I know we got some emails this week. We're going to talk
6081000	6086840	a little bit about TwitchCon. We're going to talk about an old TV show related to video gaming
6086840	6090760	coming back, and I'm very jazzed about this. I really hope they don't screw it up. Of course,
6090760	6096680	your calls at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype when we come back after this break with more of Orange
6096680	6108440	Lounge Radio. We'll be back. Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio Live tonight,
6108520	6116200	January the 15th of 2017, with episode number 672 of our program already in progress.
6116200	6121160	If you're just joining us live at vognetwork.com, you missed our little lively discussion on the
6121160	6124920	Nintendo Switch. I guess you'll just have to check it out on the podcast feed, which, of course,
6124920	6130360	you can do via iTunes, Google Play, or pretty much anywhere where you can get podcasts,
6130360	6134840	including vognetwork.com where the show is hosted. I want to also make sure at some point I give a
6134840	6142520	shout out to our pals, speaking of VOG, over at gamebuoy.org because they had me on their show
6142520	6148040	this week. We actually taped it like not even an hour after that Switch presentation was done,
6148680	6153000	so it was really cool that they invited me on their program. I was very happy to be there with
6153000	6157160	my pals, Captain Spike and First Mate Slidekick, and they're always very good about shouting out
6157160	6161640	OLR, so I want to make sure they get a nice, big, hearty shout out and check out their latest
6161640	6166280	episode, gamebuoy.org, called Switchmas. But if you don't want to hear any more Switch talk,
6166280	6171000	I think they have like 120 other episodes you can go back and check out instead on a variety
6171000	6175080	of topics. They did one recently on Civilization as well because I didn't realize Civilization had
6175080	6180280	hit a milestone. I mean, yes, the sixth game release, but it also had a birthday recently,
6180280	6183720	so they did a show about that. So, anyhow, check that out.
6185720	6190200	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,
6190200	6195880	use the passphrase number. Before we get into rapid fire news, I thought I'd bring this up
6195880	6200440	real quick. I mean, this is a heck of a question to be springing on you guys. I apologize, but
6200440	6205160	hopefully you've given this some thought at some point. But I did get a tweet earlier that had
6205160	6210360	mentioned like, hey, are you guys ever going to talk about like the best video games of 2016?
6210360	6215480	Since we kind of, you know, skipped the show at New Year's and now here we are halfway into the
6215480	6220200	first month of 2017. We kind of skipped that usual time of year when shows would talk about
6220200	6225080	this. So, I thought I would just like quickly ask, you know, so we don't neglect it completely.
6225080	6229960	Guys, what do you think was your favorite video game last year? What do you think was your
6229960	6234360	favorite video game? What do you, I guess, what was the best game? Like, if you had to look back
6234360	6239560	and say this game was the best game of 2016, what do you think you'd say? I'll start. It was,
6239560	6245400	in my opinion, the best game released in 2016 was Overwatch. I think Overwatch, the best game they
6246280	6250520	and I'm not even that big of a fan of first-person shooters, but it's, you know, it's just that great
6250520	6256440	blizzard ability to turn a genre that is not always often accessible into something that is
6256440	6261400	very easy to get into and to play. I love the diversity of the characters. And I don't even
6261400	6269400	mean that from a, you know, like sexual and country and all that stuff. Like, I just mean
6269400	6274440	the diversity of how they play. Like you have like, I mean, the first part is great too, but
6274440	6278600	I mean, like, you know, you have people that shoot rockets and, you know, every healer heals
6278600	6284040	a different way. You don't really have like copies of the same character. So it's just, it's a really
6284040	6290040	easy game to get into. And it's true. I don't play as much of it as, you know, my partner and some
6290040	6294440	of my friends, but I do own it on two different consoles. I think it's a great game and one of
6294440	6299720	the more enjoyable experiences of the year. If I had had time to put a whole list together,
6299720	6303480	you know, I was thinking about it towards the end of last year. I almost was going to put Pokemon Go
6303480	6308280	on the list. Cause I think, I think that game, you know, as much as people want to hate on its
6308280	6314120	drawbacks and yeah, you know, Pokemon Go has its drawbacks. I definitely think Pokemon Go made a
6314120	6321160	cultural impact that will look back on 2016 and say, you know, that was like the fad the summer
6321160	6327400	of 2016. And, you know, not a lot of video games get to be that. So, and I honestly, I'm still
6327400	6333880	enjoying Pokemon Go, although as a game, you can't sit here and say, it's better than Pokemon
6333880	6339880	Sun and Moon. Pokemon Sun and Moon is like an amazing handheld Pokemon game for the series.
6339880	6344120	So, you know, I think Pokemon Sun and Moon would probably be in my list somewhere, but I think my
6344120	6349480	favorite game of 2016 was probably Overwatch. And I think it was the best and like deserving of all
6349480	6353480	the game of the year awards that it's getting. Not to put you guys on the spot, but have you
6353480	6357400	thought about this at all? Loki, your, your, your best game of 2016. If we were to look back,
6357960	6363400	I don't remember what I played in 2016, honestly. I mean, I don't know. I don't even know what came
6363400	6367560	out in 2016. It's hard. You have to kind of peek at Wikipedia sometimes to kind of get a reminder.
6367560	6371400	Well, there was a lot of good stuff that came out earlier in the year too. Like I think a game
6371400	6375880	that's worthy of recognition and in most people's tops five would be like, well, in my top five be
6375880	6380840	Stardew Valley. Uh, you know, I think that was a January game, uh, for PC anyway, obviously it
6380840	6386760	came to consoles later. Yep. Didn't play it. Yeah, I know. I know. Um, dark soccer, anything
6386760	6391800	that jumps out at you as a, as the best checking the date on something. Okay. She's telling me a
6391800	6400280	second, but, um, well, what is it anyway, even if it's not 2016 specifically? Um, actually I really
6400280	6406440	enjoyed Legion. Okay. The world of Warcraft expansion. Sure. I mean, honestly, I think it's,
6406440	6409560	I think it's the best expansion they've ever done. I think I've played it pretty much to the
6409560	6414920	exclusion of a lot of other things. So, and I wish somebody would play with me. Hint, hint,
6415720	6421240	but I've really enjoyed it. I'm still playing it. I'm still digging the new classes and everything.
6421240	6425800	It really feels like a fresh game. So, okay. That's fair. I think a lot of people, I think
6425800	6430760	a lot, I think the gals from girls gone, wow, would agree with you. That's probably the best
6430760	6434600	game that came out last year. Think of anything low key or should I just move on? I don't know.
6434680	6440680	I've been playing Skyrim remastered, I guess. I mean, that's, I mean, pretty much it. I didn't
6440680	6447000	really play a whole ton of games last year. Um, I have a ton of games that I bought,
6447000	6451320	but none of them really stand out as being like really great games. So I can't,
6451320	6453960	I would have thought you might've said something related to the PlayStation VR.
6454680	6459480	I mean like until dawn Russia bless. Pretty cool. I don't know if it's like my favorite
6459480	6464360	game of last year. It's a cool experience, I guess. Um, a lot of people have been putting
6464360	6469080	rez in their year end best, which is hilarious. How old that game is. No, I'm sorry. I mean,
6469080	6473960	it's all right, but it's not, it's not like game of the year stuff. I don't know. I just didn't
6473960	6477960	really have anything. I didn't play really a lot of new games. I have a ton of some of my backlog,
6477960	6483400	but I just haven't, nothing I can think of that really like stuck out is like, oh my God,
6483400	6489320	this is so amazing. Get on it, Loki. Just kidding. All right. Let's move on and talk about some
6489880	6493640	rapid fire news. Uh, actually, actually I should go to chat and see what kind of games people have
6493640	6498920	been saying in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com. Um, Maya says, Overwatch may be the best new IP
6498920	6504200	in five years. Um, let's see. Sjoan Hunter-Mats says Mighty No. 9 was up there for me. Uh,
6504200	6510280	Forza Horizon 3 is up there also. Pokemon Go also. Um, I absolutely think Forza Horizon 3 would be
6510280	6515000	in my top three and I haven't even played that much of it, but it's, it's a fucking amazing
6515000	6520120	racing game. It really is. Uh, an arcade racer, which is a genre I really enjoy. I think Forza
6520120	6524120	Horizon 3 is just one of those games. Like I really need to invest more time in. Um,
6524120	6528680	but I think it's fucking amazing. So, uh, yeah, I probably, it's very disappointed that I didn't
6528680	6534760	see a new side truck game on that, you know, switch announcement thing that would have sold
6534760	6540840	it. Unfortunately, act deft of course, shouting out a Kirby planet, Robobot and fifth dream saying
6540840	6545080	I'm playing so many fuck tons of Stardew Valley right now. Yeah. A lot of people are, a lot of
6545080	6552520	people are. All right. Let's get to some, uh, rapid fire news. Loki. Okay. Um, so much like they did
6552520	6558600	with Just Cause 2, Just Cause 3 is getting its multiplayer mod. Um, so that's going to be coming
6558600	6563080	out on Steam pretty soon, or at least the PC version. They're saying they're expecting that
6563080	6568600	to release sometime in February or March, and it's going to support over a hundred players on
6568600	6573080	its servers. And of course it opens the door for lots of craziness, including,
6573080	6579480	you know, um, racing, death match, skydiving, they're saying role playing or free roam. Um,
6579480	6583800	I just remember Just Cause 2's multiplayer with a thousand people on a server at a time. And that
6583800	6590600	was just absolute chaos and a lot of fun to play. So I will have to check this out. I don't know if
6590600	6595880	I'm in this laptop cause Just Cause 3 doesn't run very well and I still have this on a PS4. So
6596440	6600760	that's one of those games in my backlog that I got to go back and play. That and Watch Dogs 2,
6600760	6607800	another one. Um, another thing, uh, that can actually dust off my PlayStation VR for would
6607800	6613800	be Dirt Rally. It's going to be adding PlayStation VR support on the PlayStation 4 version. That's
6613800	6620520	going to be coming some point soon. So to check it out when that comes out, cause I'm all for
6620520	6626120	more, uh, PSVR stuff. They're saying though that here's the thing that's kind of annoying though.
6626120	6635320	Um, it's being added as a download only for $12.99. So you have to, um, oh, I guess so. Okay. So the
6635320	6641640	PlayStation VR version is $12.99. It's being sold as a standalone for UK, I guess they're adding,
6641640	6649480	um, support. Hmm. Hmm. You know, there's a version of a Dirt that just came out for free on the
6649480	6653320	Humble store. It was free over the weekend. I think it's done now. Yeah. I think I already
6653320	6658120	had that. I saw that and I didn't really bother to pick it up because I'm pretty sure I have it.
6658120	6662600	And if I don't, do I really need another game to go into my massive backlog of games that I'm
6662600	6668600	probably never going to play? All right. Well, moving on to talk about a place where you're
6668600	6674200	probably not playing Pokemon Go and that's China because China is not allowing Pokemon Go, which
6674200	6678280	first off, if you're listening to this show in China, um, you should let us know. Cause I, my,
6678280	6684520	I'm just, I just assume it's banned. Um, but who knows? Uh, anyhow, uh, Pokemon Go is, uh,
6684520	6688840	not out in China and it's probably not coming out anytime soon. The official censorship body in
6688840	6693560	China has said it's not going to license any augmented reality game. So that would include
6693560	6697800	Ingress or anything else that comes to the table later on, which by the way, very surprised there
6697800	6702680	has not been a, you know, a level Pokemon Go competitor released before the holiday.
6702680	6706920	It was very surprised about that. But anyway, uh, they want to determine they being the censorship
6706920	6714360	body, if they're a danger to personal safety and national security. Um, probably not fans of people
6714360	6718760	walking around government landmarks, trying to catch a Pikachu. Not necessarily that South Korea
6718760	6724120	also doesn't allow it because they have no virtual mapping a lot of the country, uh, due to relations
6724120	6728840	with North Korea. Interesting. Hmm. Uh, I thought, but I thought they had it in South Korea. Nope.
6729880	6735800	Only in one tiny town. Okay. Interesting. All right. Uh, so anyway, yeah, uh, that's really
6735800	6740280	what it boils down to. They probably do not want you wandering into places that you're not supposed
6740280	6747080	to be just to find that must have Pokemon. So anyhow, um, we'll see if that changes at some
6747080	6750680	point, but I imagine Niantic would have to hardwire some things into it for that to change.
6751240	6755000	Um, even though we mentioned at the top of the show, I had it bookmarked here to mention the
6755000	6760840	awesome games done quick marathon, uh, raised a lot of money for the prevent cancer foundation
6760840	6767320	$2.2 million. And they raised most of that in the last day. That was a pretty impressive
6767320	6772200	thing to watch. And I actually did watch, um, a good chunk of the marathon yesterday. I saw,
6772200	6777800	uh, quite a bit of, uh, well, I watched the entire undertale. I watched a good chunk of
6777800	6782600	super Metroid and saw quite a bit of the Zelda Wind Waker too. So I was, I was watching a lot
6782600	6787000	of that on the last day, uh, could have done without some of the commentary during, during
6787000	6791160	super Metroid. If you all saw that, um, you might know what I'm referring to. I thought that was
6791160	6797400	pretty tasteless. And, um, I hope, uh, the AGDQ folks will take into consideration the need to,
6797400	6802600	uh, maybe screen people or, or give people some type of little training about what to say when
6802600	6808040	they have a mic in front of their face and lots of people, uh, watching for a charitable foundation.
6808040	6812200	But that negativity aside, um, I thought the undertale run and I'm not even super into
6812200	6816200	undertale, like a lot of people, but I thought that was a lot of fun to watch. Um, and the guy
6816200	6819800	that was streaming, it was obviously really into it. And you know, the crowd went wild when they
6819800	6824360	passed the 2 million mark. And at the end of the day, that was a really great, uh, amount of money
6824360	6830280	that they raised for charity. Uh, and I, I like these gamers doing good type of stories. I think
6830280	6837560	this, this, uh, this story that shows that our community can raise all this money for a good
6837560	6842440	cause, I think does, uh, the gaming community, a lot of good. So, um, congrats to everybody who
6842440	6847720	are involved, who were involved. Um, Dark Sakura, what do you have for us? Some stuff.
6848760	6854280	We have, um, some more games getting backwards compatibility on Xbox One. It's, uh, Bad Company
6854280	6861320	2, Battlefield 3, and Dragon Age Origins, which, uh, yay, maybe. I'd like to see, uh, how Dragon
6861320	6869320	Age Origins ends up looking. Um, you can get them from the marketplace or use the disc. Also, um,
6869880	6877560	Final Fantasy 7 Remake and Kingdom Hearts 3, they're still gonna be a while. Um,
6878440	6881720	they actually don't have a particular date on them. Just says that they're going to be
6882360	6888360	quite a bit longer to, to finish production, according to Nomura. That's it. So maybe not
6888360	6892520	going to release in 2017 as we were thinking, especially that Final Fantasy 7 Remake. Probably
6892520	6896840	not. Hmm. We'll see. All right. Let's travel around the world and check out what gaming
6896840	6901960	releases are coming out this week. Although January is not always the most exciting month.
6901960	6905960	Loki, do we have anything? Yeah, it's not a whole ton of stuff coming out, but we've got, um,
6906520	6913080	Altair Chalet Plus, the Alchemist of Dust Sea that's coming out on Vita, and Fate,
6913080	6920040	Exstella, the Umbral Star on PlayStation 4 and Vita, and then Birthdays, The Beginning
6920040	6925720	on PlayStation 4, Valkyria Revolution on PlayStation 4, Vita, and Xbox One,
6926440	6934360	and Dragon Quest VIII, Journey of the Cursed King on 3DS, and Gravity Rush 2 on PlayStation 4,
6935560	6941480	and let's see, Urban Empire on PC, and then finally about,
6943080	6949640	on that Sunday, Dawn Braben Cricket 17 on PC. All right. Well, traveling to Japan, um,
6949720	6953240	it's, you know, they've, they've got a few big releases this week in Japan, actually,
6953240	6958840	um, starting with Gravity Days 2, which over here would be Gravity Rush 2 releases on the PlayStation
6958840	6962520	4 this week in Japan. Um, so I know a lot of people looking forward to that. So that is a
6962520	6967880	release this week. Uh, also that Altair game that, uh, uh, Loki was earlier referring to also getting
6967880	6974200	its, uh, Japanese release this week. Um, Aoki Kakume no Valkyria comes out this week, uh, on
6974200	6979480	the PlayStation 4 in Japan from Sega. So I'm trying to see if that's, oh, yeah, that's,
6979480	6983240	that's exactly what it is. Azure Revolution Valkyria. Now, is that related to the Valkyria
6983240	6988200	Chronicles games? I'm assuming it has to be. So that would be kind of neat. Uh, but that is out
6988200	6993720	in Japan this week. Uh, then Birthdays, The Beginning also out in Japan. Uh, that is all
6993720	6999000	again on the PlayStation 4, the PlayStation Vita, also seeing that same Altair game, the Valkyria
6999000	7004120	game and the Aoki Kakume no Valkyria, uh, excuse me, same game there, just written two different
7004120	7009960	ways. Uh, but there's also another game in Japan this week, uh, on the Vita. Hana Oboro Sengoku
7009960	7016680	Den Ranky comes out in regular and limited editions this week on the Vita. Quickly taking a
7016680	7022760	look to see if anything is hitting the 3DS this week. Um, oh yeah, that, oh no, that's, uh, the
7022760	7027880	U.S. Uh, there is just, uh, Pucci and Yoshi's Woolly World. Well, that's still pretty exciting
7027880	7034440	on the 3DS this week. And of course, Amiibo! Plentiful to go with that. So, check it out.
7035560	7043560	Darth Sakura. For release dates in the UK, just a few. On the 17th, we have She Remembered
7043560	7050840	Caterpillars for Mac and PC. On the 18th, Gravity Rush 2 for PlayStation 4. And on the 20th, for
7050840	7058520	3DS, Dragon Quest VIII. I'm excited to play Dragon Quest VIII again. I like VIII better than VII,
7058520	7062280	even though I do have VII on the 3DS. I'm just really excited to play VIII again. VIII has some
7062280	7067640	great characters, great music. Excited. All right, uh, let's do some more news stories.
7067640	7073320	We're going to be taking your calls in about 20 minutes or so at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word
7073320	7077400	on Skype. Oh, but before we get to stories, sorry, it's that time of the show where we get to the
7077400	7081560	mailbag. I always miss it. I always miss it because it's in a different color. You can't
7081560	7085720	log into the mail? Nope, it's not working. Like, we're not working how? Internal server error.
7087480	7091160	Is it that same problem we were having a couple weeks ago? I don't remember because that was
7091160	7096760	happening when I wasn't here. Hold on a minute, because everything still auto-forwards to my
7096760	7103640	email, so I can forward these two real quick. Why don't we have Loki do a story and we'll circle
7103640	7109800	back to the mailbag in a minute while we work this out in a great live radio fashion. All right,
7109800	7117720	so Steam's reached a new milestone of 14 million concurrent users. That's right, so that's the
7117720	7123960	first time they've hit that mark in 13 years, and I guess that you're saying that it happened,
7123960	7135800	I was about 14,207,039. We're all on the same time. Of course, the highest played games for
7136600	7143720	that big period, Dota 2, Counter-Strike Global Offensive, Grand Theft Auto 5, which I really
7143720	7150280	need to pick up. Once I get a PC, they can run it better. Ark Survival Evolved, Team Fortress 2,
7150280	7155800	still pretty high up there. Garry's Mod, man, I'm surprised that's even up there that far.
7155800	7166200	Rocket League, Football Manager, Rust, and Arma 3. Yeah, so that's pretty awesome. And then,
7166200	7172920	of course, not sure about any other stats for Steam as far as, I know this year they've,
7172920	7180040	what was it, 2016 saw the growth in Steam has been ridiculous. 40% of the games on Steam
7180600	7187080	total came in 2016, which is ridiculous. And of course, a lot of those not necessarily being that
7187080	7193880	great, but through the whole Steam Greenlight process. And my Steam library is still really
7193880	7200760	huge, despite the fact that I haven't played a game on Steam in a very long time. Right?
7201480	7207240	Seriously. Yes. I think last I checked, let me take a look here real quick. Last I checked,
7207240	7214680	I think I had almost over 500 games, which is ridiculous. Let's see here. It was,
7217960	7229160	what do we got here? Too many. 523. Four of which are VR, which I don't have anything for VR.
7229960	7234200	Oh, hey, one of the things we forgot to talk about, while we were gone, the other thing
7234200	7240200	that was kind of going on with CES, and they had a lot of kind of neat stuff coming out of CES,
7240200	7245800	including new VR headsets, which I guess I want to say it was HP that was selling those,
7245800	7251160	so there's going to be some more affordable headsets coming out pretty soon. And then,
7251160	7257640	did anyone see that really trippy, like some of their prototype laptop displays or something like
7257640	7262200	that? I know that they had one that was like a triple monitor setup, which is ridiculous,
7262200	7266120	because that thing takes up, I don't even know how that would be practical. I mean,
7266120	7269400	I guess you would use that on a desktop or something, but then what's the point of having
7269400	7274520	a laptop at that point? But there are some of those laptops, they had one that was like a $9,000
7274520	7283000	laptop that was like dual, a dual GPU laptop. They had two full size 1080 Nvidia cards, and
7284120	7288760	it only had a disposable income of, or spare $9,000 for something like that.
7288760	7291400	And Brad from Pod Culture said it was stolen from the booth.
7291400	7294680	Yeah, yeah, the triple display was stolen from the booth, despite the fact that it doesn't really
7294680	7300040	work. So imagine that thing wasn't collapsible in any way, so that part of it wasn't working at all.
7300040	7306440	So you had to have walked out with this ginormous scream. I mean, how would someone not notice that?
7306440	7308840	Just a really fluffy jacket.
7309960	7313480	You look like you have bat wings or something like, I'm the Batman.
7315880	7318600	Oh, William Ritterface says two of them got stolen. Oh, well.
7318600	7319320	Oh, fantastic.
7319320	7326600	One under each arm. All right, anyway. All right, so I think we found a workaround for the mailbag,
7326600	7330120	right? I forwarded because I still get copied to those on my personal account. So
7331480	7335080	hopefully, all right, Dark Soccer is going to dive into the mailbag.
7335080	7335720	If I don't die.
7337560	7342040	Which you guys can email us, of course, every week. Participate at OrangeLoungeRedo.com.
7342040	7347000	And you will notice, come hell or high water, we'll dig those emails out of the oblivion
7347000	7350520	to share with you on the show via Dark Soccer. Dark Soccer, what's on deck tonight?
7351320	7355960	Hello, people. When I do dress up for Halloween, I wear a kigurumi.
7356680	7363800	Not only is a kigurumi a supremely easy costume to put on, but also a kigurumi is something that
7363800	7369240	I know my nieces will find to be delightful, which is my aim. Sure, some adults think a
7369240	7374040	kigurumi looks weird, and I don't care because my nieces find it delightful. Also, adults suck.
7374840	7380200	I prefer to wear a red panda kigurumi because it has a tail on the back, which I use to smack
7380200	7384440	my nieces in the face. Something they also find to be delightful. Maybe you shouldn't
7384440	7388120	hit your nieces in the face, actually. Another one that I'm going to be, the next one I'm
7388120	7394040	buying is a red panda. I see. Additionally, after your two and a half hour knot ad for
7394040	7399080	Stroopwafel, I decided to go to my local state-run liquor store to buy some.
7399960	7408600	Note I said tried. Whether it was due to high demand or purposeful institutionalized incompetence,
7408600	7413960	I was unable to find any of the tasty fuck-me-up juice that Sky and Dark Sakura seem to enjoy so much.
7413960	7418520	Okay, if you can't find it, you just take a regular waffle and just, you know, run it through
7418520	7422680	like a coffee filter. It has nothing to do with actual waffles. Well, then I really don't care
7422680	7427000	about it at all. It kind of tastes like a waffle to me, but I think the minute he said state-run
7427080	7431560	liquor store, I was like, it wasn't there. We have a place, I don't know how many-
7431560	7433160	ABC back in Alabama.
7433160	7437240	We have a place called Total Wine that has a lot of imports. It's not just wine,
7437240	7440280	they have a lot of import stuff. That's like the only place here where you can get it.
7440280	7443080	The one by my house is ordering me for Volona. I'm so happy.
7443080	7444600	Oh, really? That's funny.
7445400	7451400	Instead, I got some apricot hefeweizen, another kind of tasty fuck-me-up juice that I enjoy so
7451400	7457800	much. Staycare, retertainment trainer. The hefeweizen, I've only had one hefeweizen that I
7457800	7461080	like, and that's the pyramid hefeweizen.
7461080	7465480	I'm still bitter at the fact that my wife got rid of a waffle maker that we had a long time ago.
7465480	7469480	She just gave it away. I'm like, why? We could have had waffles.
7469480	7472280	You should have asked her for a new one for Christmas. I mean,
7472280	7474040	I guess you'll have to wait a year at this point.
7474040	7475240	I can just go buy one.
7475240	7477240	Yeah, just go buy one. You're an idiot.
7477240	7479720	I want a deep fryer as well, but she doesn't want me to have that.
7479720	7481000	You used to have a deep fryer.
7481000	7484600	I did, and it was shit, but they have the nice ones now with the baskets and all the fun stuff.
7484600	7487640	Oh, yeah, it'll be fun. Make fries at home. It'll be fun.
7488600	7489100	All right.
7490040	7494600	Well, it's delicious, and maybe we'll put the brand up somewhere
7494600	7497080	in a not-ad for the Stroopwafel Liqueur.
7497080	7502280	I'm gonna take a bottle with me to every con I go to from here on out. That'll be the thing.
7502280	7505720	Meet Rob Robertson. Drink Stroopwafel, because it's fucking good.
7505720	7507640	The official booze of Orange Andrade.
7507640	7515240	Hi, Orange Andrade. I've been a big fan since your live 365 days.
7515240	7517640	That's a long time ago. Thank you.
7517640	7520760	For over 10 years, I've been listening on and off to the three of you,
7520760	7523400	Sky Loki and Dark Sakura, to talk about video games,
7523400	7527080	the gaming lifestyle, and gaming culture, along with everything else in between.
7527080	7528680	I have a question for the three of you.
7530680	7534680	One, Sky, how do you manage to juggle multiple podcasts? I have to know.
7534680	7539000	Well, it helps when three of them are on break right now.
7541320	7543800	I haven't been doing them all regularly.
7543800	7545720	But Rob uses a time turner.
7546920	7551320	Well, I definitely know there are plans to do a new season of guys on the show.
7551320	7554760	And then, of course, once Drag Race is back for season nine,
7554760	7558280	which should be in March or April, Reading Is Fundamental will start up again.
7558280	7563000	Poke Stop podcast, I'm gonna be honest with you guys, that's in a little bit of a zone right now.
7563000	7564520	Shane and I have talked about it recently.
7565480	7569720	We'll see. It might be a monthly thing or something, but I'll let you know.
7569720	7571160	What about guys on the show?
7571160	7574200	No, I just said we're definitely going to do another season of guys on the show.
7574920	7577800	In fact, I know the first topic is going to be about vacations,
7579240	7580600	because we just took a big one.
7581320	7583560	So we are going to talk about all that stuff.
7583560	7585880	So there will be another season of guys on the show, for sure.
7586680	7588840	But as far as the other stuff.
7588920	7596120	But anyway, I look at it as like a hobby that you just dedicate certain nights of the week to.
7596120	7601240	Like this, we do this every Sunday night, and it's been that way for 15 years.
7601240	7603880	Yes, there are sometimes cases where we don't make it,
7603880	7609080	but a lot of people in their lives make room for church every Sunday night.
7609080	7611640	Not that I'm trying to equate this show to church.
7611640	7612680	No, you heathen.
7612680	7613480	I'm not going to do that.
7613560	7618360	But I'm saying a gathering of people at a time and place
7618360	7621400	that you suddenly make a part of your lifestyle.
7621400	7624280	That's what it takes to keep doing this show regularly.
7624280	7627720	So for some people, it's a bowling league on Tuesday nights,
7627720	7630680	or D&D on Saturday afternoons or something.
7630680	7631560	You know what I mean?
7631560	7634360	That's how I am able to do the podcast,
7634360	7636920	is I just have to set a time and say, okay, this is my hobby.
7637720	7641160	Also, the fact that I never get out to the movies anymore,
7641160	7644600	or watch any TV or stuff, that kind of helps,
7644600	7648040	because there's a lot of stuff that I'm just really clueless on
7648040	7650600	when it comes to nerd culture, because I don't follow.
7650600	7653160	Like Game of Thrones, I've never seen an episode.
7653160	7654520	Same thing with Walking Dead, never seen an episode.
7654520	7655560	I've watched some on YouTube.
7656920	7659160	A lot of those big nerd shows, never seen an episode.
7659160	7662520	If it's on Netflix, it's a better chance that I will have seen it at some point.
7663080	7665080	I did finally start watching Black Mirror.
7665080	7665960	I like that.
7665960	7666600	That's pretty good.
7666600	7667720	I want to watch Legion.
7668360	7668860	Legion.
7669500	7671420	The Marvel Universe one.
7671420	7671920	Oh, okay.
7672620	7674940	I haven't watched Jessica Jones or any...
7674940	7676460	I haven't watched any of the Netflix stuff.
7676460	7678140	You are coming over and watching all of it.
7678140	7679020	Daredevil, none of it.
7679020	7679820	Luke Cage, none of it.
7679820	7680860	Who cares about Daredevil?
7680860	7681660	Lemony Snicket.
7683020	7683980	No, I haven't watched it yet.
7683980	7686860	I saw the movie years ago, but I hear this is probably much different.
7686860	7687420	It's awesome.
7687420	7688860	The fact that Neil Patrick Harris is a...
7688860	7690940	Neil Patrick Harris is fantastic.
7690940	7693740	And plus, not only does it have Neil Patrick Harris,
7693740	7699180	it also has Patrick Warburton as Lemony Snicket, which is awesome.
7699180	7705020	And then the two parents, Will Arnett as the father and then the mother.
7705020	7707980	I don't remember the actress's name, but she was the one that played...
7710060	7712380	God, I can fucking see her face, but I can't remember her name.
7713420	7717900	She was in How I Met Your Mother.
7717900	7719420	She was also in Avengers.
7719420	7720300	Alison Hannigan?
7720300	7721340	No, How I Met Your Mother.
7721900	7723900	Um, the Canadian girl.
7724700	7725980	Oh, Robin Sparkles?
7725980	7726380	Yes.
7726380	7726780	Okay.
7726780	7727340	I don't know her.
7727340	7728380	I don't know her actual name.
7728380	7728940	I just know her.
7728940	7729500	So she's...
7729500	7729980	I just know her.
7729980	7730780	Let's go to the mall.
7730780	7732940	Yeah, I just can't remember her name.
7732940	7734700	But yeah, she's...
7734700	7735660	Cobie Smolders.
7735660	7736540	That's what JD says.
7736540	7737100	Uh, maybe.
7737100	7740780	Yeah, but she's played some other and just the cast is fantastic.
7741420	7741980	Good.
7741980	7743180	So second question.
7743180	7746860	Real quick, I just want to say some folks in chat saying Jessica Jones is real good.
7746860	7748780	And I'm sure these shows are good.
7748780	7750700	Just because I don't watch them doesn't mean they're not good.
7750780	7751580	But I just...
7751580	7752220	I don't...
7752220	7753100	I don't have time.
7753980	7758380	I challenge everyone who's seen Jessica Jones and never read Alias to get off your ass and
7758380	7759500	go read Alias first.
7760620	7760860	All right.
7760860	7762940	But different from the ABC show Alias.
7762940	7765580	No, the comic's so good.
7765580	7766140	All right.
7766140	7767340	Even better than the series.
7768220	7769260	Next question from the email.
7769260	7770300	Let me finish eating my chocolate.
7771980	7772940	Well, now you want me to keep talking.
7772940	7773980	Y'all made me wait.
7773980	7774940	Now it's time for you to wait.
7775900	7776620	Um, two.
7776620	7781900	Loki, as a father and someone who games, how do you find time to play games?
7781900	7782700	Just curious.
7782700	7786860	I have a 10 and a half week old and I'm still learning to establish a schedule.
7786860	7788620	Pretty difficult, but it is what it is.
7788620	7789260	He doesn't.
7790060	7791980	Uh, yes, pretty much.
7791980	7794540	No, I have to wait until everybody is asleep.
7794540	7798380	And then I stay way too late and wake up way too early.
7799820	7805740	Other times I get to play games are when I pacify them with other things.
7806300	7813660	So like my oldest son will go play games now in his room with the tablet and he'll go
7813660	7817500	watch Minecraft and play Minecraft and won't shut up about Minecraft.
7817500	7822940	And then his tablet will, he'll put the tablet away while my other son take a nap and played
7822940	7827660	on the Wii U where he watches videos of Minecraft and plays Minecraft and will shut up about
7827660	7828300	Minecraft.
7829420	7832300	We just bought another Minecraft book last night, so I don't know why I'm encouraging
7832300	7834620	this, but did you see they're putting Minecraft on the switch?
7835420	7837260	Minecraft's on everything, so it's not a big deal.
7837260	7840540	But like, I don't know, he bought, we bought him a book.
7840540	7842780	It's like an idea book type thing for Minecraft.
7842780	7843900	It's the construction guy.
7843900	7845740	They have like four of these essential guys or whatever.
7845740	7847260	So he has the essential one already.
7847260	7851100	And then he has, now it's the builder's guide, which kind of gives you, it's kind of cool.
7851100	7853980	It gives you like ideas for like roller coasters and stuff like that.
7853980	7855900	So I mean, I think it's pretty neat.
7855900	7860700	Um, and you know, he just talks about like all these mods and stuff in Minecraft.
7860700	7863740	And so like, I don't have any idea what the hell he's talking about.
7863740	7865420	Yes, I know these, these mods exist.
7865420	7869900	He's like, have you heard, have you seen the, you know, seer TNT?
7869900	7871500	It's like, it's a mod.
7871500	7872860	I just, I don't care.
7872860	7875340	I really don't care that you're telling me about all these things.
7875340	7880620	I know he wants to share, but he doesn't, like, it's literally just constant vomit of
7880620	7884060	information of Minecraft mods that I don't give a shit about.
7884940	7889260	But yeah, the fine time, what I've been doing now, like, cause my wife is hogging the TV
7889260	7893180	still, like she'll just like watch TV just to watch TV.
7893180	7894380	She can run out of shows.
7894380	7896060	Like she just got done with House.
7896060	7898780	And so we've been watching Lemony Second a couple times.
7898780	7902700	She's been watching just because she watched House and there was the woman, the actress
7902700	7905100	that plays Cuddy in House has another show.
7905100	7909340	The Girlfriend's Guide to Divorce or some shit that she's watching that I'm being
7909340	7909900	subjected to.
7909900	7915500	So I've been playing on the PlayStation VR, um, using just the 2D screen mode to play
7915500	7917980	games since I don't have a screen to play on.
7919980	7921340	So that's how I get time.
7921340	7925500	And it's usually very distracting because, um, if I'm playing while everybody's awake,
7926620	7927820	I get bothered by people.
7927820	7931020	Like if I have the VR headset on, my son wakes up from nap.
7931020	7933180	He's like going, daddy, what are you doing?
7933180	7934140	Daddy, what are you doing?
7934140	7935100	What are you doing, daddy?
7935100	7935900	What are you doing, daddy?
7935900	7937100	It's like fucking.
7937100	7939820	And then the cat like tries to get up in there too.
7939820	7942300	It's like, get the fuck off me, you stupid cat.
7942300	7943660	I'm trying to like play this game.
7943660	7945020	She's like in front of my face.
7945020	7946860	I'm like, I will say this right now.
7946860	7948780	All of that is why I don't have kids.
7948780	7951980	Nope, but I have a cat.
7951980	7952620	Aren't they precious?
7952620	7954300	I have a cat and she fucks off.
7954300	7954620	Fine.
7954620	7955420	The kids are fine.
7955420	7959740	If I put a TV show on for my one kid and give the tablet to the other kid, they don't bother
7959740	7960060	me.
7960060	7960940	All right.
7960940	7962140	That was that.
7962140	7964860	That was me, but it was a Commodore 64.
7964860	7965980	And look, look at me now.
7966700	7968540	Your kids might turn out like me someday.
7969420	7969900	Exactly.
7969900	7972940	I'd be fine with it, but he doesn't want to try like Mario or any of the hard games.
7972940	7974940	He isn't like anything is challenging.
7974940	7976140	I'm not doing it.
7976140	7977020	Sounds American.
7977020	7977340	All right.
7977420	7979340	Anyway, next part of the email.
7979340	7980140	The ones for me.
7980780	7982300	Oh, dark Sakura.
7982300	7985020	What's your criteria to meet the classic game of the week?
7985020	7987980	My two personal recommendations would be lightning force.
7987980	7990460	It's spelled like this for the US market, which I know.
7991260	7993260	And Onimusha two or three.
7993260	7996540	Forgive my grammar and the sentence as I know I'll get eviscerated.
7996540	7997740	Your grammar was actually decent.
7998300	7999180	Criteria one.
7999180	7999980	It's not Halo.
8001020	8001500	True.
8001500	8002620	Criteria one.
8002620	8003500	It's not Halo.
8003900	8007420	Criteria two, 10 years or older.
8008940	8013820	And preferably not something that's utter shit unless it's so much utter shit.
8013820	8014300	Oh my God.
8014940	8015980	Criteria three.
8015980	8018940	Something you randomly thought about on Sunday morning before the show.
8019820	8020220	I do.
8020220	8021260	I'm on Saturday night.
8023180	8023900	Have you done?
8023900	8025740	Well, actually, because I can't remember.
8025740	8028140	Have you done Derby owners club as a classic game of the week?
8028140	8029180	I think I have.
8029180	8031020	I don't think you have, because I think I have.
8031020	8032940	I think that game only recently, right?
8032940	8035180	That game only recently turned like final three long.
8036300	8037260	What, Horsey Humping?
8037900	8038400	Yeah.
8039020	8044140	But we've talked about Derby owners club a lot because of you made Politary.
8044780	8049420	And don't forget this year, I think next week will be the first classic system of the week.
8049420	8055660	So, you know, now that you asked about the formula, we have to shake up the formula this
8055660	8055980	year.
8055980	8058140	She just did a game that didn't even exist.
8058140	8060780	Got to keep you all on your toes somehow in year 15.
8061260	8064860	So she can do Half-Life 3 as a classic game of the week?
8064860	8066380	No, because it's not older than 10 years.
8068300	8070540	At least the Polybust thing goes back to 1981.
8070540	8071740	So there is that.
8071740	8072940	Although it's coming up.
8072940	8074700	How far back does the Half-Life 3 thing go?
8074700	8076220	It's almost 10 years.
8077500	8079100	Anyway, anything else on that email?
8079660	8082620	Yes, but we've already answered that one.
8082620	8085900	Finally, I have to know your overall thoughts on the Nintendo Switch.
8085900	8087260	Are you sold on it yet?
8087260	8089740	Will you three hold off until more games are announced?
8089740	8091740	The answer, by the way, is yes to all of it.
8093100	8094540	Just spread amongst us.
8094540	8095420	Thanks so much.
8095420	8096940	I'm taking the time to read my email.
8096940	8099340	Skye, I'm sorry I missed you at MagFest last Saturday.
8099900	8104220	I wish I could have talked to you more in person to pick your brain about gaming and
8104220	8105260	just life in general.
8105900	8106780	Take care, guys.
8106780	8108060	Keep up the awesome work.
8108060	8109100	Tristan, AKA...
8110380	8116300	I will fight my way onto a panel next year so I at least can say go to xballroom at ytime
8116300	8117340	and say hi.
8117660	8120460	AKA DCB Needle Crash.
8122140	8123420	Oh, they were in chat earlier.
8123420	8123980	So, all right.
8123980	8124620	Cool.
8124620	8124940	Thanks.
8124940	8126540	Thanks for being a long time listener.
8126540	8129340	A last email is...
8129340	8130540	Oh, the crap.
8131420	8138380	People don't message me during the show and I'm like, don't message me during the show.
8139820	8140380	That's what I do.
8140380	8141660	I'm not even seeing who it is.
8141660	8142460	So hold on.
8142460	8143100	Okay.
8143100	8145260	I'll look at it during a break or something.
8145260	8151340	But, you know, if I take 40 minutes to respond, you realize a little notification on my bottom
8151340	8154060	and then I have to go and change it to get the notification to stop.
8154060	8154860	And it's annoying.
8154860	8156060	Oh, I just ignore.
8156060	8157980	I just let it blink until I'm damn good.
8157980	8159180	Well, it annoys me.
8159180	8159660	Okay.
8159660	8162300	I can't let it sit and blink at me.
8162300	8163500	It's got to get checked.
8164860	8165740	Shit's got to get checked.
8165740	8168540	If I were to look at your phone right now, how many unread mails do you have?
8170220	8171500	That's you.
8172060	8172700	And you know what?
8172700	8175260	My work email, my inbox is always empty.
8175980	8178060	I have 13 unread emails right now.
8178060	8178560	Girl.
8179260	8179580	All right.
8179580	8182380	Here's an interesting article that can make the show roll.
8182380	8182880	Oh.
8183900	8190220	Published in PLOS Computational Biology, researchers applied widely used neuroscience
8190220	8196780	approaches to analyze the classic games console Atari 2600, which runs the video game Donkey Kong
8196780	8202060	and found that such approaches do not meaningfully describe how the console's microprocessor really
8202060	8202560	works.
8203260	8204540	And then the comment, it's funny.
8204540	8205980	They chose Donkey Kong too.
8205980	8211340	So it's okay.
8211340	8218060	It's using a classic game system to improve the to improve the understanding of the brain.
8219100	8220940	Okay, cool.
8220940	8225500	So like, like the way that our brain responds to situations in certain games.
8226380	8226940	Interesting.
8226940	8227500	Hold on.
8227500	8230300	Um, I'm trying to find the more information about it.
8230300	8230940	Give me a second.
8232380	8234940	Since humans designed this, this is a quote from here.
8235660	8240540	Since humans designed this processor from the transistor all the way up to the software,
8240540	8242780	we know how it works at every level.
8242780	8247100	And we have an intuition for what it means to understand the system.
8247100	8250940	Our goal was to highlight some of the deficiencies in understanding
8250940	8256220	that arise when applying contemporary and analytic techniques to big data, data sets
8256220	8257580	of computing systems.
8257580	8260940	So something like, uh, let's see deficiencies.
8261340	8263980	You need more than six weeks to make an E.T. game.
8263980	8274040	That would have been one deficiency of the Atari
8274040	8275040	You need more than four kilobytes to make an arcade perfect translation of Pac-Man.
8275040	8276040	That would be one deficiency, right?
8276040	8277980	Oh, I don't know if it quite means that, but, um, but their final thing is with careful
8277980	8282700	thought, uh, current big data approaches to neuroscience may not live up to their promise
8282700	8284540	or succeed in advancing the field.
8285180	8288540	Progress requires better experiments, theories, and data analysis approaches.
8288540	8292140	So basically computers versus brains.
8293180	8293980	Brains win.
8293980	8297820	Brains are still an completely comprehensible.
8297820	8302700	So, uh, fifth dream in chat, if you thought 13 was a lot of unread emails, fifth dream
8302700	8306140	in chat says I have over 500,000 unread emails.
8306140	8307420	I don't, I want to see the receipts.
8307420	8310860	Where's the screenshot kind of 500,000.
8310860	8314780	Um, actually maybe in my Yahoo account, I have that many unread emails, but that's kind
8314780	8316940	of like my spam dump ground.
8316940	8321740	And as I understand it, foreign countries have probably read all those emails by now.
8321740	8327580	Anyway, I recently cleaned out my Yahoo account because that's where my, um, some of my Amazon
8327580	8331980	notifications just go, which by the way, Amazon, you didn't fucking notify me when the switch
8331980	8336460	went available, despite the fact that I've marked that specifically it did twice on that
8336460	8339180	it went for sale twice in neither time.
8339180	8342060	So what's the point of having a button to notify you if they're never going to notify
8342060	8343500	you, you kind of missed the point there.
8345180	8345740	All right.
8345980	8348860	If you want to email us in a future week, that was the last one, right?
8348860	8349100	Yes.
8349100	8351980	Participate at orange lounge radio.com.
8351980	8356300	If you want to email us in a future week, uh, in the meantime, let's get back to some
8356300	8357020	gaming news.
8357020	8362220	And I think I have the next story here that talks about windows 10 and a new game mode
8362220	8364220	that is going to be coming out very soon for windows 10.
8364220	8366540	In fact, I believe it's coming out in this next week.
8366540	8372700	Uh, yes, the insider preview program will be seeing windows 10 game mode this week.
8372700	8376940	Now you're not going to see this fully functional until a later release of windows 10, but this
8376940	8383100	is supposed to help tune your PC to speed up gaming performance for both legacy windows
8383100	8385180	games and modern titles.
8385980	8390220	I believe this was something about how, um, it's supposed to dedicate more of the processing
8390220	8391820	basically to gaming.
8391820	8395900	And so it's like more of your system is dedicated to the gaming, sort of like you would see
8395900	8397180	in a console environment.
8397180	8400300	So in a little less on the multitasking abilities.
8400780	8407020	Um, anyway, that's one update of several things to come in 2017, uh, live streaming through
8407020	8410780	beam is supposed to be something that's going to be a big centerpiece on the platforms,
8410780	8412860	uh, moving into 2017.
8412860	8415820	Uh, so it'd be interesting to see how that competition with Twitch works, by the way,
8415820	8417340	I started a beam channel.
8417340	8421660	Um, and you know, for the most part, it's been just very similar to broadcasting on
8421660	8426380	Twitch, except, you know, there's less people on beam right now, but I do, I still really
8426380	8431020	like the whole interactive approach where, you know, people are earning currency as they
8431020	8435260	watch your stream and then they can dump sound clips on your stream or depending on the game
8435260	8437100	you're playing, they can actually influence the game.
8437100	8439980	I kind of like that next level where beam's going.
8439980	8443580	I got to say, you know, no matter how you might feel about Microsoft.
8443580	8448140	Uh, anyhow, also some other things happening on Xbox one, you're going to see an always
8448140	8452220	available guide with faster access to game recording and music controls and achievement
8452220	8456140	tracking overlay, a new look for Cortana and a gamer score leader board.
8456140	8460620	So lots of stuff to look forward to in the coming year on the Microsoft platforms.
8461740	8466140	Uh, let's see, William murder face and chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, while I
8466140	8471020	am intrigued, Microsoft has so far failed to impress me with their previous attempts
8471020	8472300	at helping PC gamers.
8472860	8473180	We'll see.
8473180	8474060	I'm intrigued too.
8474060	8478540	And we'll see what develops with this game mode and you know, what games actually utilize
8478540	8479100	it.
8479100	8480780	Uh, moving on dark Sakura.
8482300	8484540	Twitch Con is moving.
8485180	8491020	It's going to be in late October and they're moving to, uh, long beach.
8491820	8495660	Um, if I am right, I think, yeah, this is the long beach convention center.
8496220	8497740	Um, that I think is the same one.
8497740	8499580	The AX is at anime expo.
8500140	8503260	Um, cause it's gotten huge apparently.
8503260	8504620	So enjoy it.
8504620	8505420	If you want to go there.
8507340	8509660	Boy, everybody's just shitting on San Diego this week.
8509660	8513580	This is the second thing to move to LA area from San Diego.
8513580	8516460	No, actually Twitch Con the first year was in San Francisco.
8516460	8517340	Yes, it was.
8517340	8520300	I went for a day and it was, it was interesting.
8520300	8521900	I'd be down to go into Twitch Con again.
8521900	8527260	It's just the end of the year is so many conventions, but this year there won't be the final fantasy
8527260	8527580	thing.
8527580	8528780	So yeah, who knows?
8528780	8529420	Who knows?
8529420	8533260	And, uh, I, they haven't said if there's going to be a gamer X this year.
8533260	8534620	I don't know where that stands.
8535180	8540540	Um, and this past year in 2016 gamer X and Twitch Con with the same weekend, which meant
8540540	8541420	I couldn't do both.
8541420	8544540	So, uh, we'll see how the calendar works out this year.
8544540	8545980	So, all right.
8546700	8551020	Uh, moving on, uh, Loki, just a couple more stories that we're going to get to the skype
8551020	8552540	line at orange lounge radio.
8553180	8553900	Okay.
8553900	8559260	So apparently someone saw that there was this, um, post on Craigslist.
8559900	8567020	It's a, for a casting call for a show from the makers of catfish, the TV series called
8567020	8568540	beyond the keyboard.
8568540	8575740	They're looking for, um, people who like to troll fake gamer girls or who are sick of
8575740	8582220	fake gamer girls and booby streamers, and also who, uh, want to come, uh, confront phony
8582220	8586540	gamers face to face and show them what geek culture is really about.
8586540	8590540	And also not limited to, you know, other such topics, which you fiercely disagree with,
8590540	8595900	including feminism, gaming, vegans, conspiracy theories, rival sports teams, Syrian refugees,
8595900	8600620	immigration, black lives matter, LGBT slash trans issues, et cetera.
8600620	8606700	My God is this not a fucking completely obvious troll the troll show.
8606700	8611900	That's going to be happening where it's dumpster fire television where it's basically,
8611900	8616380	Oh, Hey, you thought you were on a show that was going to be making fun of these people,
8616380	8620540	but really they're confronting the trolls and we're going to teach you a lesson.
8621420	8623100	Like see them all exposed.
8623100	8625260	Didn't, didn't they have a show like that already?
8625260	8629260	Didn't they have a thing where like, uh, the people that they talk shit about online
8629260	8630540	would then like meet them.
8630540	8635500	It was called like, it was on, it was on the CW, which should say enough right there.
8635500	8636460	It was called a hater.
8636460	8642220	It was H eight E R and it was people that would like, uh, say things like, I fucking
8642220	8643740	hate Snooki and she sucks.
8643740	8644460	And did all this stuff.
8644460	8646460	Cause like, this is the level of celebrity of the show.
8646460	8648140	Like that gets is like Snooki and shit.
8648140	8648700	Right.
8648700	8651420	So the same people that star on celebrity apprentice.
8651420	8657580	So then, um, uh, Snooki will like confront the person and be like, how could you say
8657580	8658220	that shit about me?
8658780	8661260	You know, and this is, it's dumpster fire TV.
8661260	8663260	Like there's just, there's no other, it's dumpster.
8663260	8666380	It's a floating in the ocean dumpster fire.
8666380	8669660	Give these human pieces of shit in the attention.
8669660	8670780	It's not for them.
8670780	8671500	It's the come up.
8671500	8672300	It's the come up.
8672300	8673020	That's what it is.
8673580	8677900	And it's not even like, they're not even getting paid for it, which is kind of seriously funny,
8677900	8682860	but I mean, anybody that actually is dumb enough to believe that this is what this actually
8682860	8685260	is, that you're going on a show to make fun of people.
8685260	8686700	You are a fucking retard.
8686700	8691820	I mean, it's just, maybe you should go, maybe you should go on the show.
8692380	8692940	You know what?
8692940	8694780	I can go on any show whatsoever.
8694780	8697980	If you're going to have me confront people that I'm calling names to, I will call the
8697980	8698780	names to their face.
8698780	8700860	I don't fucking care at all.
8700860	8703660	If I say you're a fucking retard, I'm going to tell you that to your face.
8703660	8706620	It's not going to make me all of a sudden, you know, sorry.
8707260	8709020	Nintendo, I'll be with Reggie.
8709020	8712300	Reggie, what the fuck is wrong with your stupid company and their goddamn network?
8712300	8715100	I mean, can you fucking figure out internet for once?
8715100	8716700	You know what the internet is, right?
8716700	8717020	Okay.
8717660	8719500	I mean, I don't have a problem talking to him.
8722060	8726380	Fifth Dream in chat says, I think Sky is full of BS, gets to meet him on TV.
8726380	8732220	No, I wouldn't subject myself to dumpster fire TV, but I would subject myself to this.
8732220	8735020	Let's end on a positive note here because this is cool.
8735020	8740220	Shout factory is going to be doing a reboot of the infamous eighties game show.
8740220	8741420	Starrcade.
8741420	8741820	Yes.
8744460	8747260	And I am officially throwing my hat in the ring.
8747260	8748380	I want to host this show.
8748380	8749260	So fucking bad.
8749260	8750940	Like, what do I have to do?
8750940	8752620	Who do I, who do I have to blow?
8752620	8756780	Who do I have to like, what do I have to do to host the new Starrcade?
8757420	8758220	Chris Hardwick.
8758220	8758860	I can do that.
8759500	8760860	I can fucking do that wall.
8760860	8763900	What's that bouncy ball Plinko shit thing he's hosting on NBC.
8763900	8764940	Now I can do that.
8766620	8773580	Anyway, shout factory is, uh, has acquired the rights to Starrcade and they are going
8773580	8775100	to bring it back.
8775100	8780060	And, um, they are also the company behind the new mystery science theater 3000.
8780060	8785420	Uh, it's, uh, they've acquired the worldwide television format and ancillary rights to
8785420	8790060	this, and they're planning to develop a retro boot, uh, a quote here.
8790060	8793420	Starrcade is a classic game show from the eighties and is pure nostalgic fun.
8793500	8795420	We couldn't be more excited to work with the original.
8795420	8799340	So creators to retro boots, Starrcade for a new generation is going to be like, is it
8799340	8800540	going to look like the old episodes?
8800540	8802220	Like that'd be fantastic.
8802220	8805900	As we continue to actively expand our reach into production and development for new series,
8805900	8807580	movies, and scripted shows and specials.
8807580	8812460	This deal exemplifies the type of content we plan to pursue, which taps into the interests
8812460	8814620	and passions of our company's loyal fan base.
8814620	8818140	A shop factory is going to work directly with JN production company who made the original
8818140	8821820	show, uh, to create a version of this where celebrities.
8822620	8827340	Again, probably people like Snooki, uh, e-sports professionals and pro gaming types will compete
8827340	8829260	to see who is the top gamer on the planet.
8829260	8833500	Why not just normal people or, you know, the whole point is just normal people.
8833500	8837580	If this is like a retro boot type of thing, like my assumption is when I read into that,
8837580	8839340	that maybe there'll be playing classic games.
8839340	8842380	Like obviously there's an interest out there in classic gaming.
8842380	8844460	Look what just happened with the classic Nintendo.
8844460	8845900	Look at awesome games done quick.
8845900	8848140	Most of those games they play on there are very old.
8848140	8850460	I think there'd be a lot of people that would be like really into scene.
8850460	8851900	I would love a show that's awesome.
8851900	8853340	Awesome games done quick.
8853340	8857980	The show, you know, every, every like day would be like, um, you know, a few hours or
8857980	8861660	something like that, or they're going to have like an hour long show, have multi-part shows
8861660	8864780	for like, you know, games are going to take like three hours or something, but that would
8864780	8865340	be awesome.
8865340	8867100	I would totally watch that.
8867100	8871340	Uh, SSU 100 Matt says, Rob, did you get a chance to see the magfest game show thing?
8871340	8873820	They did a spirited revival of the game show Nick arcade.
8873820	8876620	No, I didn't, but I did see a gaming jeopardy.
8876620	8881100	I went to a thing where they were playing jeopardy and, um, I'm gonna, I'm gonna probably
8881100	8883340	bid to do some type of game show thing at magwest.
8883340	8891340	Cause in my career in teaching, we do games like jeopardy, like weakest link or those
8891340	8891980	types of games.
8891980	8893580	Like we do that all the time.
8893580	8896060	So I'm, I want to do a jeopardy panel.
8896060	8899740	So I'm gonna, I'm gonna throw my hat into the ring for that, at least for magwest and
8899740	8900380	see what happens.
8900940	8902220	So I think it'd be fun.
8902220	8906380	Game shows are fun, but I would really want to host this new Starrcade OMG.
8906380	8909100	SSU 100 Matt says, Rob just wants to host a game show.
8909100	8909820	Hell yeah.
8909820	8913740	That was, that was my dream in the fourth grade was to be a game show host.
8913740	8914940	Bob Barker was my idol.
8914940	8915900	He still is in many ways.
8915900	8918140	I love Bob Barker, national treasure.
8918780	8919100	Anyway.
8919900	8922140	Yet another celebrity that survived 2016.
8922140	8923020	Thank God.
8923020	8923580	Thank God.
8924540	8926060	Don't forget to spay and neuter your pets.
8926060	8926380	All right.
8927260	8927580	That's it.
8927580	8928540	We're going to skype line.
8928540	8933980	One eight seven seven game OLR username on skype, orange lounge radio, all one word.
8933980	8937340	Uh, you can give us a call and, uh, we'll talk about anything we've talked about so
8937340	8937820	far tonight.
8937820	8940780	I'm sure some of y'all have something to say on the switch, but if there's something we
8940780	8943260	miss too, we can talk about that as well.
8943260	8944140	I've got something to say.
8944140	8945340	What's that Logie?
8945340	8948700	So going back to what Reggie said, how there's going to be plenty of switch available at
8948700	8949500	launch.
8949500	8952780	GameStop has already sold out of their switch allocation and won't have any more until
8952780	8953500	after launch.
8955740	8956540	Womp womp.
8957420	8960460	I'm just waiting to get the cancel notices from the other companies as well.
8960460	8963420	But anyway, we've got a call coming in, so let's get to it.
8963420	8964540	Hi, you're on orange launch radio.
8964540	8965020	Who's this?
8966220	8966860	Hello.
8966860	8967420	Hey guys.
8967420	8967820	Hi there.
8967820	8968540	How's it going?
8968540	8969260	Oh my gosh.
8969260	8970140	There's two of you here.
8970140	8970380	Hi.
8973580	8973900	Hello.
8973900	8974940	Who is this?
8974940	8976940	Hey, it's DT and gamer girl.
8976940	8977580	Hey guys.
8977580	8978140	How you doing?
8978780	8979260	Good.
8979260	8979980	Doing well.
8979980	8980860	Good to see you both.
8980860	8981900	What's on your mind tonight?
8982780	8988860	Um, we were, well, he showed me, um, one of the shadow run, shadow run returns.
8988860	8989260	Yeah.
8989260	8992700	And I really liked it cause I've never played anything like it.
8992700	8993740	And I really liked it.
8993740	8996060	It reminded me of X-com a little bit.
8997580	9002860	I have not played shadow run returns yet, but back to Kickstarter, I have the game and
9002860	9004620	it sits with the rest of my steam library.
9005500	9006620	Shame on you.
9006620	9007900	I even have the expansion.
9007900	9011180	I'm glad someone out there is playing it when you, uh, when you're failing.
9011260	9012140	I do want to play it.
9012140	9013020	I liked shadow run.
9013020	9015500	I liked the old SES, uh, shadow run game.
9015500	9016220	Yeah.
9016220	9016620	Well, good.
9016620	9018460	I'm glad you guys are enjoying it there.
9018460	9019020	Oh yeah.
9019020	9019660	Oh yeah.
9019660	9021580	Do you guys watch any of the awesome games done quick?
9022300	9022860	A little bit.
9022860	9023340	Yeah.
9023340	9023580	Yeah.
9024220	9027180	He actually started getting me into it cause I've never heard of them until the other
9027180	9027500	day.
9027500	9029980	So I was just really happy.
9029980	9032140	Like, well, I thought it was pretty cool.
9033500	9033660	Yeah.
9033660	9037660	I mean, super Metroid is like my favorite game of all time as you all well know.
9037660	9040460	Uh, and watching the speed run of it is just always so much fun.
9040460	9041740	And it's like, even it goes so fast.
9041740	9045500	I'm always kind of like, and every year I'm like that you can do that in that game.
9045500	9046220	I never realized that.
9046220	9048700	Of course they do anything different each year in that.
9048700	9050780	Like, do they like up their straps or anything?
9050780	9054220	Like, uh, some years they'll do an any percent run.
9054220	9056220	Some years they'll do a hundred percent run.
9056220	9058860	This year was a race, a hundred percent run.
9058860	9063020	So four people did it all at once and they had to collect a hundred percent of the items.
9063020	9065900	And I think the winning time was like an hour and 22 minutes.
9065900	9067500	Don't quote me on that, but I think it was something like that.
9067500	9068300	It was less than that.
9068300	9071180	It was like an hour and 16.
9071180	9071660	Wow.
9071660	9072460	Yeah, 16.
9072460	9073100	Wow.
9073100	9077340	But yeah, I mean, it's cool to see like four people doing it at once because you know,
9077340	9080780	the two on the left side were neck and neck throughout the whole thing.
9080780	9083500	And they were only like seconds apart in the, in it.
9083500	9087820	And then one of the guys who was like in the upper right, like just made a boo boo,
9087820	9089020	like mistakes happen.
9089020	9094220	If you miss one jump, you miss one thing and it put the guy like four minutes behind everybody
9094220	9095340	else is just unfortunate.
9095340	9099660	But that's, that's the nature of speed running sometimes is that you, if you make one mistake,
9100380	9105740	it's, you know, or as somebody else was saying, is that if you die in the Super Metroid run,
9105740	9108220	it's over because you don't have time to save.
9108220	9110620	You, you can't just run to a save room and save your game.
9110620	9111980	That takes too long.
9111980	9114940	So it's quicker because it was coming down here.
9114940	9116620	Did anyone get killed during the run?
9117980	9119980	No, no, but everybody lived through the run.
9119980	9120780	Oh, okay.
9120780	9123980	And the previous run, some people didn't make it out.
9123980	9129660	And save the animals one, which kill one last year, if I remember right, and save one this
9129660	9130060	year.
9130060	9134300	And it's probably less frames to save the animals than it is to save the game.
9134940	9138700	So, you know, that's, uh, I don't think it was that big a waste.
9138700	9144140	And I did look, I looked carefully for that little dot that flies off the planet when
9144140	9145340	you save the animals.
9145340	9149500	Cause in my opinion, that's the big reward, uh, for the save the animals folk.
9149500	9150940	It says, I see the dot.
9150940	9151740	I did it.
9151740	9154220	My donations made that dot appear four times.
9155580	9158460	Anyway, um, what do you guys think on the switch?
9158460	9161980	You guys, uh, going to be getting a switch or not so into it or what?
9162940	9167420	I'm kind of iffy right now, just because I don't really see too many games that I want
9167420	9167900	yet.
9167900	9169340	So I'm going to wait.
9169340	9173660	Plus I never, I, I have a five rule or five game rule.
9173660	9176300	If there's five games that I like, then I usually get the system.
9176300	9177580	But if not, then I don't.
9177580	9180140	That way I feel like it's not a waste of money for me.
9180140	9181820	It's honestly not a bad rule.
9181820	9185660	And considering the system is only launching with five games, going to be pretty hard to
9185660	9187660	meet that rule day one, but it's not for me.
9187660	9192540	It's three, but, but yes, I think a lot of people have a rule like that.
9192540	9196620	And what that always goes back to the old, uh, golden rule of gaming here at OLR.
9196620	9199180	A system is only as good as the games that are on it, right?
9200220	9200620	Yep.
9200620	9204300	I'll probably try and get one by holiday cause all the other games will be out by then.
9204940	9205260	Yeah.
9205260	9207500	We'll see how the conversation shifts during E3.
9207500	9208140	That's for sure.
9208780	9209340	Definitely.
9209900	9214460	I'm definitely picking up, um, Breath of the Wild though for Wii, for the Wii U.
9214460	9214860	Oh yeah.
9214860	9216380	I've been waiting for that one forever.
9216380	9218380	How could you not after that trailer?
9218380	9219740	That was, uh,
9219740	9221420	Oh, there's boys acting all right.
9221420	9221820	Me too.
9222780	9226220	Like the Zelda crying thing was so like, whoa.
9226220	9229180	Like, you know, uh, yeah, it was just, it was very powerful.
9229180	9230220	I'm excited.
9230220	9233900	So, but I, I have a, I have a feeling Zelda's not just going to cry.
9233900	9237020	Zelda's going to be a bad-ass like she always, I'm hoping, I'm hoping.
9237020	9238300	So, all right.
9238300	9239740	Oh, I'm definitely getting that too.
9240460	9245260	It also reminds me of, um, oh, I can't think of the name of the game.
9245260	9246140	Nino?
9246140	9247180	No, not Nino.
9247180	9253260	Well, um, the one that, uh, the artist for, uh, Totoro worked on.
9254220	9255180	Nino Kuni?
9255180	9256060	Nino Kuni.
9256060	9256300	Yeah.
9256940	9259980	The art kind of sort of reminds me of it a little bit.
9259980	9261500	A little bit, a little bit.
9261500	9264540	Um, hey, Nino Kuni 2 should be a thing this year, huh?
9264540	9267340	They were teased that on the PlayStation 4 a long time ago.
9267340	9267580	Yeah.
9267580	9269980	I think, isn't it supposed to be coming out soon or something?
9270860	9272700	Remember Nino Kuni 2 announcement?
9272700	9273180	Remember that?
9273740	9274620	All right.
9274620	9274860	All right.
9274860	9277340	Well, you guys, I'm going to let you go so we can try to squeeze in some more calls,
9277340	9279100	but it's a pleasure to hear from you both.
9279100	9282460	Uh, have a good, uh, uh, time you guys and I'll, uh, talk to you again soon.
9283180	9283740	All right.
9283740	9283980	Bye.
9284780	9285020	Bye.
9285660	9285900	All right.
9285900	9288700	Dark Tetsuya and Gamer Girl, making a joint call in the show.
9288700	9292380	And we saw video, sorry to those of you guys, uh, on the radio.
9292380	9293420	Happens sometimes.
9293420	9295420	Uh, Orange Launch Radio, all one word on Skype.
9295420	9300060	If you want to give our show a call, uh, Dungeon Busters in chat, pointing out the
9300060	9301980	DuckTales race was really Epic.
9301980	9304540	Only a second or two difference.
9304540	9309580	Uh, VX JasonXV our fearless announcer says dying in a hundred percent races isn't very
9309580	9314460	common because the nature of getting tanks and whatnot, not dying in any percent, which
9314460	9319020	amounts to like 13%, I think is fairly common and very brutal.
9319580	9320540	Uh, let's get to the phones.
9320540	9321260	We got more calls.
9321260	9321900	It's lighting up tonight.
9321900	9322860	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9322860	9323260	Who's this?
9324060	9324940	It's a Ziba.
9324940	9325500	Hey, Ziba.
9325500	9326540	How you doing?
9326540	9327260	I'm good.
9327260	9327580	Good.
9327580	9328140	I'm sorry.
9328140	9329260	I missed you at MAGFest.
9329260	9333260	I know I was thinking that I'm like, I totally missed you at MAGFest this year, but I don't
9333260	9333500	know.
9333500	9336060	This year was just different than last year.
9336060	9337660	Like I spent a lot of time.
9337660	9338540	It's gonna sound horrible.
9338540	9343820	I spent a lot of time in room parties, which is the opposite this time.
9343820	9350300	I really did a little bit of room parties, but, um, I did a lot more, um, like I went
9350300	9354140	to a lot more things that happened in MAGFest last year.
9354140	9358540	I kind of just like, kind of went with my group around, but this time I just went on
9358540	9360460	my own and I did some of my own things.
9360460	9360780	Nice.
9360780	9362140	What kinds of things did you see?
9362780	9364540	So good thing you brought that up.
9364540	9365820	That's what I wanted to talk about.
9365820	9371020	Um, I had a really like great experience at MAGFest that I wanted to talk about.
9371020	9371580	Sure.
9371580	9375500	Um, so you do know that David Wise was there, right?
9375500	9376220	Yes, I'd heard that.
9376220	9377340	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
9377340	9377980	Okay.
9377980	9381420	So I think it was Saturday.
9382380	9388300	Um, I, after I went to a panel, I went back to my room to go get something and I heard
9388300	9389100	a knock on the door.
9390220	9394220	So I opened it up and it's one of my, um, Overclock Remix friends.
9394220	9401100	Cause I was with them in, um, um, MAGFest and she goes, David Wise is in my room.
9401100	9402140	I went, what?
9402700	9406780	So like I threw everything around and I went to her room.
9406780	9408140	Sure enough, he's there.
9408140	9413020	And there was a whole bunch of other people from OC Remix there and they were playing,
9413020	9417100	um, Donkey Kong, who was kind of funny.
9417100	9420940	Um, so like he turned and looked at me and I was like, hi.
9423180	9424140	And he's like, hi.
9425500	9431900	And, um, I kind of like sat next to him and what was really awesome is like OC Remix,
9431900	9435020	they do remixes for video games if anybody didn't know.
9435020	9436380	Um, so there was,
9436380	9437740	I don't know how anybody listened.
9437740	9440940	I don't know how anybody listening to this show could not know of OC Remix.
9440940	9441580	Seriously.
9441580	9445260	Like if you don't know, educate yourself.
9446540	9447500	Yes, that's right.
9447500	9448140	Know your roots.
9450540	9456940	So there was some, um, remixers there that have done, um, like remixes for Donkey Kong.
9456940	9462940	So they were going over like next to him with like earphones and with their phones and going,
9462940	9466940	hey Dave, can, can you listen to one of my remixes?
9467500	9469340	And he was like, yeah, sure.
9469900	9471900	So like it was a couple of them.
9471900	9478460	And, um, one of them stuck out at me because she was like, so like, like nervous talking to him.
9478460	9485260	And, um, she was gave her, gave him, um, the earphones and like played the, her song and
9485260	9487900	like his face lit up and I was like, whoa.
9488780	9494140	And, um, I didn't really listen to the remix myself, but he was just like, wow, I haven't,
9494140	9498060	I've never heard my song, um, like be made that way.
9498620	9504860	And it was just a great experience of having like people go to him with their music,
9505820	9507660	like remixed of his music.
9508460	9509980	And it was nice.
9509980	9511580	And then after that, um,
9511580	9514380	So in other words, you did do room parties.
9514460	9518140	Only your room parties had former rare composers at them.
9518140	9518640	Yes.
9519660	9523020	I see way to, way to, way to one up my stories.
9525660	9532460	So after all that, um, kind of calmed down a little bit and, uh, they left the, um,
9532460	9533900	they left Donkey Kong running.
9534780	9542460	And so it kind of got quiet and all of a sudden I started, I heard David Wise kind of hum
9542940	9543900	one of the songs.
9545660	9547820	I was funny catching him do that.
9547820	9552540	And then, um, oh man, it was, it was, oh, there was one other thing.
9552540	9557900	So, um, when they were playing, they were, they were in one of the, um, stages that was
9557900	9558700	in a cave.
9559260	9563260	I'm not really too familiar with Donkey Kong because I was, didn't really play them as
9563260	9569020	much as a kid, but, um, in one of the cave, uh, levels, there was like a dripping noise
9569020	9577020	and he was like, Hey, you know, that dripping noise was a noise in my apartment that I recorded
9577820	9583980	and we're like, Whoa, it was a so neat hearing some of his stories.
9584540	9589500	Um, I, I went to the, um, one of the panels that he was at too.
9590060	9595580	Uh, it was the game composer, um, Q and A, um, that was really neat too.
9595580	9602620	Cause I got to hear, uh, you know, some snippets of like a bunch of game composers, but, um,
9602620	9609740	but that, that like, um, part and magfest of meeting him in a room and like talking to
9609740	9611580	him, it was just a great experience.
9612300	9615820	And that sounds like one of those things you could really like only have at a magfest or
9615820	9616620	as a convention.
9616620	9620220	That's still, I mean, obviously magfest has grown very large, but it still has a lot of
9620220	9623580	like small community vibes kind of going on with it for sure.
9624300	9627100	So, but that's definitely, I agree.
9627660	9630060	That's an, that's an awesome, awesome story.
9630060	9633020	So, um, I don't, I don't blame you for ignoring me all weekend.
9633020	9635260	I w I would have to, if you had, no, I'm just kidding.
9635260	9638220	Obviously it just didn't work out and there was, I didn't have a really good space to
9638220	9641420	meet up or anything, but hopefully, hopefully, uh, next time.
9641420	9645100	So I will definitely plan on being at magfest, uh, next year.
9645100	9647100	Did you catch any of the concerts real quick?
9647740	9648220	Yes.
9648220	9650300	Um, I went to a couple.
9650380	9653180	Um, I'm trying to think of one of the names.
9653180	9655100	Um, Oh crap.
9655100	9656140	You put me on the spot.
9656140	9657100	So were you there?
9657100	9664060	Think of like proto man, David wise kind of like made my whole like memory go away, but
9664060	9665180	I went to a couple of them.
9665180	9666460	They were pretty neat.
9666460	9666780	Nice.
9667500	9668140	All right.
9668140	9672140	Well, Ziba, thanks so much for the call and for sharing the story and, uh, yeah, that's
9672140	9672460	awesome.
9672460	9675740	But you know, I think it's, it's a good reminder too, that, you know, David wise and a lot
9675740	9680060	of these gaming folks that go to these conventions, you know, they, they are
9680060	9685340	completely normal people as well that are probably truly humbled by the people that
9685340	9688620	have the positive reactions to their stuff that they do.
9688620	9693740	You know, I'm, you know, I, I don't like have these delusions that OLR is this massively
9693740	9697820	popular podcast or anything, but you know, once in a while, you know, somebody will tell
9697820	9701100	me at a convention or something like they'll tell me about a particular episode or a story.
9701100	9705260	And it's funny because oftentimes I probably can't even remember the exact episode of the
9705260	9709500	story, but I'm always humbled that people like do take those kinds of memories from
9709500	9710540	the show and so forth.
9710540	9711900	And it's just, it's, it's amazing.
9711900	9714060	And just, you know, fuzzy wuzzy feelings all over.
9714060	9715660	So yes, definitely.
9715660	9716940	Magfest does that to you.
9718220	9718700	All right.
9718700	9720780	Well, Ziba, I'm gonna let you go to try and squeeze in some more calls.
9720780	9721020	Okay.
9721660	9722060	All right.
9722060	9722380	Thanks.
9722380	9723260	Take care.
9723260	9723500	All right.
9723500	9724060	You too.
9724060	9724300	Bye.
9725260	9725580	Okay.
9725580	9727420	Our, our Skype line is on fire tonight.
9727420	9729660	You guys, I'm gonna try my best to get a couple more of these in.
9729660	9730620	Hi, you're on orange on radio.
9730620	9731500	Who's this?
9731500	9732780	Hey, what's going on everybody?
9732780	9733340	It's Ron.
9733340	9733740	Hey, Ron.
9733740	9735020	That was good to see you last week.
9735660	9735900	Dude.
9735900	9736700	It was good to see you too.
9736700	9737180	After what?
9737260	9738380	Almost 10 years.
9738380	9739020	Something like that.
9739020	9739340	Was it?
9739340	9739580	Has it?
9739580	9741340	No, it hadn't been that long, had it?
9742620	9744860	It's kind of along those lines.
9744860	9745340	Oh my God.
9745340	9747820	No, there was, there was Katsucon that one year.
9747820	9748380	Fanime.
9749020	9751340	God, it really has been a long time, hasn't it?
9751340	9753260	First was Fanime, then it was Katsucon.
9753260	9755660	So that'd be like seven or eight years.
9755660	9760620	And I cannot find one picture of you cosplaying Black Mage from Final Fantasy.
9760620	9762860	Yeah, that, that was the thing that happened, that it happened.
9763740	9766940	Yeah, you never, you never make it to Dragon Con.
9767740	9769180	That's the last time I saw you before this.
9769180	9769660	PAX East.
9769660	9770140	PAX East.
9770140	9772060	Yeah, I was like, I knew it had to be more recent than that.
9772060	9772860	Yes, PAX East.
9773420	9773820	Yes.
9775900	9776300	Awesome.
9776300	9777260	Well, what's on your mind tonight?
9777820	9778620	First things first.
9782140	9784220	You cut, you cut out there a little bit, buddy.
9784220	9785580	Try first things first again.
9786700	9790620	No, the reason why I'm cutting out a little, because I'm just kind of verklempt about how
9790620	9792540	much of an amazing time I had at Magfest.
9792540	9793980	I had a fucking ball.
9793980	9794300	That's right.
9794300	9795660	Cause that was your first Magfest.
9795740	9799580	We even kind of had to, we had to nudge you a little bit going, dude, you really should
9799580	9800700	check out Magfest.
9800700	9803580	Well, to be fair, the listeners had to do the same thing to me.
9803580	9806380	Like YYR and SSG100, Matt, like really had to pester me.
9806380	9810300	Like if you're, if you're burned out on PAX, dude, you should really, really try going
9810300	9810620	to Magfest.
9810620	9811500	No, really Rob?
9811500	9813100	Rob, fucking go to Magfest.
9813100	9813900	And so I did.
9813900	9816620	And I was like, Oh my God, why didn't you guys tell me this sooner?
9816620	9817180	We did.
9818540	9819660	You know what it is?
9819660	9821500	It's just the timing of the convention.
9821500	9826860	It's like, it's right after New Year's and I'm in, I'm in the transition of getting finances
9826860	9831100	and ready for con season 2000XX, you know?
9831100	9835580	And it's like this year, even though I said I was going, it actually snuck up on me.
9835580	9837340	I was like, Oh, right.
9837340	9839740	I could actually get my shit together for that.
9839740	9841900	I liked the February thing last year.
9841900	9844540	I know not everybody's into that, but for me, that really worked out.
9844540	9846300	I know Bobby was a big fan of that too.
9846300	9851100	I didn't like this whole like days after New Year's Eve, especially it was really weird
9851100	9854860	at work because most people at work are gone between Christmas and New Year.
9854860	9856620	And I was still there doing my thing.
9856620	9858780	And then, you know, everybody's like, Oh, how's your holiday?
9858780	9859100	Great.
9859100	9859580	Oh, wait.
9859580	9860700	Any plans now that you're back?
9860700	9863180	It's like, yeah, I'm actually going on my holiday now.
9863180	9863500	See ya.
9864700	9865740	It's like, it's weird.
9866380	9871020	You see about last year, it was mostly the East Coast cosplayers that were losing their
9871020	9874940	proverbial shit because the weekend before that was Capsicon.
9874940	9878060	And there were people deciding on which convention to go.
9878060	9880380	There are some people like, I'm doing both.
9881740	9883260	Yeah, that would be rough to do too.
9883260	9887740	That's the one thing that is going to be tough about this year is that MagWest and DragonCon
9887740	9888540	are back to back.
9888540	9893420	Thankfully, MagWest is in my backyard, but there's a really good, there's a really good
9893420	9897420	chance that with DragonCon this year, I'm just going to be like, fuck it and take the
9897420	9898540	entire week off work.
9899180	9899980	Well, there you go.
9899980	9900700	You should do that.
9900700	9903100	And I'm definitely gonna try to come down Thursday.
9903100	9904620	Oh, are you doing DragonCon this year?
9905180	9906620	No, I'm talking about MagFest.
9907180	9908140	No, I'm at MagWest.
9909100	9914940	Well, I'm sorry, I'm a little discombobulated right now because I'm still excited about
9914940	9918620	the whole thing and I'm editing photos from the con and all that craziness, you know.
9919260	9922540	Well, at least it sounds like I'll see you at MagFest 2018, if nothing else.
9923180	9923900	Yes.
9923900	9924860	Let me say a couple more things.
9924860	9925660	I'm gonna get out of here.
9925660	9926160	Yep.
9926540	9929900	My 2000 gaming pick was Azure Striker Gunvolt.
9931340	9934940	It's Mega Man X meets an angry pissed off person.
9934940	9936300	That's pretty much what it is.
9936780	9939180	I'll have to check that out because I don't think I've played that.
9939580	9941180	It's on 3DS and Steam.
9941180	9942380	It's a really fun game.
9943900	9944540	Awesome.
9944540	9946700	And you said you had something else you want to get out?
9946700	9949020	Yeah, this whole Nintendo's network.
9949020	9952700	They're going to use, I'm calling it right now, they're using the Nintendo Network ID
9952700	9958220	protocol that they start implementing around the time of the, they brought out Miitomo
9958220	9958940	and his other stuff.
9958940	9960380	That's what they're going to move to.
9960380	9962540	I don't see them using friend codes anymore.
9962540	9965980	And if they do that same with the 3DS, they're going with the Nintendo.
9966220	9967500	Nintendo network ID thing.
9967500	9968780	That's why I see them happening.
9968780	9969820	I think you're right.
9969820	9974060	Because if you guys remember, right, that was the whole reason we found out about the
9974060	9977100	NX using my quotey fingers the whole time.
9977100	9980700	The whole reason we found out about the NX when they revealed it like way earlier than
9980700	9984700	they were ready to talk about it was because they were talking about a Nintendo network
9984700	9985200	type of thing.
9987500	9995660	And to answer what Loki was saying earlier, the Switch console could use GPS, but you
9996220	10002140	has to be ready for it via Bluetooth because I have a smartwatch and it can do GPS provided
10002140	10005820	that it syncs with my phone and it pulls the GPS coordinates.
10005820	10012300	So you can, if the Switch can do Bluetooth through the smartphone and if somebody does
10012300	10018620	the right hacking, you could implement GPS and you could also implement hotspotting through
10018620	10019100	Bluetooth.
10019100	10020540	So you got that.
10020540	10023900	Yeah, which to be fair, we don't know if that Switch has Bluetooth in it.
10023900	10025100	I don't think it does, right?
10025100	10030060	It probably doesn't and they wouldn't do it like in an app like Pokemon Go or something
10030060	10034460	like that wouldn't do that because then you're trusting a Bluetooth device to provide accurate
10034460	10037500	GPS information, which that could be spoofed.
10037500	10040540	So of course, they're not going to open themselves up to that.
10040540	10041040	True.
10041500	10046060	The app would have to be on the console side and they'd have to heavily lock it down.
10046060	10052860	And looking at the prices of the Switch and accessories, I personally think the prices
10052860	10055260	are ridiculous, but you know what?
10055980	10061260	Nintendo is going to make a profit off of every single one of them consoles and accessories
10061260	10063100	and controllers sold.
10063100	10068060	Nintendo does not make a loss on the hardware they sell and that's a very hard line they
10068060	10069660	drew in their company a long time ago.
10069660	10075100	I think the only time they ever sold something at a loss was when they finally price cut
10075100	10075740	the 3DS.
10075740	10076300	I think.
10076300	10077500	Yeah, that was it.
10077500	10077980	That was it.
10078540	10079900	Unless you want to count the Virtual Boy.
10080540	10082300	Well, no, I don't.
10082300	10085660	All right, Rama, my friend, I'm gonna let you go so we can wrap up.
10086220	10086700	All right, cool.
10086700	10090060	And most likely I will be getting a Switch and I'll probably be staying at home while
10090060	10091180	I play Mario Kart 8.
10091180	10095580	It's probably going to happen, but I'm just going to wait and see more games coming out.
10095580	10099900	But that also means if you bring your Switch to MAGFest 2018, we get to all play Mario
10099900	10100380	Kart 8.
10100380	10101180	It's going to be a blast.
10101820	10105260	That will probably be the only time my Switch will leave the system.
10105260	10106060	I mean, leave the house.
10106060	10108300	So, you know, I'll price an email about this later.
10108300	10109980	So we'll definitely do some coffee later.
10109980	10110700	All right, take care.
10111340	10111980	Take care.
10112300	10114700	That's one thing that's going to end with the Switch as well.
10114700	10120140	If you may think about it for, you know, like the 3DS and DS is that SharePlay stuff.
10120140	10121180	They don't have that.
10121180	10122460	Or I think it's called SharePlay.
10122460	10126380	Remember where you one person would have the cart and then everybody else can beam the
10126380	10127340	game to their thing?
10128380	10130460	That is going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
10130460	10131900	Sorry to those that didn't get through.
10131900	10135580	But if you want to give us an email, that would be awesome.
10135580	10137580	Participate at orangelauntrader.com.
10137580	10142940	By the way, Bobby Blackwolf in chat brought a receipt from one of these tech sites saying
10142940	10145100	that, wait, I reread it.
10145100	10146700	The Switch has Bluetooth.
10146700	10148540	Bluetooth 4.1.
10148540	10150220	So it does have Bluetooth in it.
10150220	10153260	So, but again, because that's what the controllers use.
10153260	10153660	Right.
10153660	10157260	But and I also, I kind of think you're right, though, about the GPS thing is it would be
10157260	10158300	a very easy thing to spoof.
10158300	10161980	And, you know, at the end of the day, why put Pokemon Go on the Switch?
10161980	10163580	Like, it doesn't make a lot of sense.
10163660	10169500	But maybe a new Pokemon game that interacts with or excuse me, a new Pokemon game in the
10169500	10172620	sun and moon variety that interacts with Go.
10173260	10176140	I could see maybe a little more of that, but we'll we'll see.
10176140	10177340	We'll see what happens.
10177340	10182300	Have they even discussed the connectivity between Go and sun and moon already?
10182300	10185340	No, they kind of that's going to be a thing.
10185340	10186540	They shove that under the rug.
10187500	10188620	No, it's not.
10188620	10191740	I think I think Niantic just had too much problems.
10191740	10195180	They still have yet to do a live event, which is important to point out as well.
10195180	10197980	You know, we still have legendaries from Gen 1 that haven't come out.
10197980	10201340	And now we're on the eve of Gen 2 Pokemon hitting.
10201340	10206220	I mean, Gen 2 Pokemon are hitting, but there's a lot more that are still coming out soon.
10206220	10209580	A lot of people theorize we could get some developments this next week.
10209580	10211260	I kind of think they're grasping at straws.
10211260	10213900	I think Niantic is just going to dump that on us when they're getting ready.
10213900	10214940	But we'll see.
10214940	10216380	I don't want them to rush it.
10216380	10217340	Don't screw it up.
10217340	10221420	Anyway, that is going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
10221420	10225180	Thank you guys for joining us again, especially after we were gone for a little bit,
10225180	10226460	especially being two weeks off.
10226460	10227500	Thank you for being here.
10227500	10229260	If you were here live, awesome.
10229260	10230220	Great to have you here.
10230220	10232940	If you're listening on the podcast feed, appreciate that too.
10232940	10233980	Or however you're listening.
10233980	10234940	Maybe you torrented it.
10234940	10235820	I don't know.
10235820	10240620	But we always appreciate a five-star review on a place like iTunes, Google Play or wherever
10240620	10241980	it is you found this podcast.
10241980	10243660	Those reviews do go a long way.
10243660	10247420	Word of mouth is really all we have to sell this show because we don't have a giant
10248300	10251260	multimillion dollar website or advertising network behind us.
10251260	10252140	All we have is word of mouth.
10252140	10255100	So if you like what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, please tell a friend or two
10255100	10255580	about the show.
10255580	10258540	And even if you didn't like what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, hey, at least

10268380	10270860	We're going to go around and get everybody's final thought.
10270860	10273260	Since I see Dark Sakura packing up, I'll start with her.
10273260	10275820	Dark Sakura, your final thought for tonight.
10276060	10276540	Resist.
10278060	10279820	Uh, resist false icons.
10282540	10283100	All right.
10283100	10283660	Enlighten.
10283660	10285180	I'm making a statement.
10285180	10285740	Resist.
10286620	10287900	Loki, your final thought tonight.
10288620	10291260	I don't know if I'm gonna keep the switch because if I don't keep the switch, then I
10291260	10293020	can buy myself a 3D printer.
10293020	10296060	So that's exciting.
10296860	10297580	One or the other.
10298220	10298620	We'll see.
10298620	10299100	I don't know.
10299100	10303340	I'm leaving it on, especially right now, because there's also the opportunity of scalping
10303340	10306860	that shit, but, um, I don't know.
10306860	10310620	I may just be lazy and leave it on there and like, oh, hey, what's this in my doorstep?
10310620	10311020	Oh yeah.
10311020	10311340	Fit.
10311340	10311500	Shit.
10311500	10313020	I forgot that was coming out, you know?
10314060	10314460	I don't know.
10315420	10315740	All right.
10316380	10321340	My final thought this week is, um, you know, yay for a three day weekend, but let's not
10321340	10322940	forget why we have a three day weekend.
10322940	10323500	Not for me.
10323500	10324220	Sorry.
10324220	10325100	My final thought.
10326620	10332060	So I just want to, you know, say, acknowledge that tomorrow is Martin Luther King Day and,
10332540	10335100	you know, take a minute to reflect on his message.
10335820	10338540	Especially since this is going to be a very interesting week.
10339100	10344220	And for me personally, even all the national stuff aside, it's going to be a very interesting
10344220	10348060	week and I'm very excited, dare I say.
10348060	10351340	So anyhow, that's it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
10351340	10353340	Thank you guys so much for tuning into the show.
