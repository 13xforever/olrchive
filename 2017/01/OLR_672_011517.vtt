00:00.000 --> 00:17.680
This year, resolve to support your favorites in video gaming without detriment or talking

00:17.680 --> 00:21.480
down to others. Play together and don't deride those who do. Be critical without being

00:21.480 --> 00:26.000
detrimental. But most of all, enjoy! It's a new year and a new episode of the show where

00:26.000 --> 00:35.400
every gamer has a voice. Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back

00:35.400 --> 00:41.240
to another episode of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio

00:41.240 --> 00:49.800
back tonight after a little break with episode number 672 for this January the 15th of 2017.

00:49.800 --> 00:54.480
First show of 2017, the first show of our 15th year, believe it or not, of doing this.

00:54.480 --> 00:59.120
My name is Rob Roberts live in Studio N7 in Sacramento, California and joining me as

00:59.120 --> 01:05.720
always say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. Balls. Is that how your 2017's been so far?

01:05.720 --> 01:10.520
That's my first word on the show for 2017. I see, so it is noted. Can we put that on

01:10.520 --> 01:19.200
the wiki? Balls. How's 2017 treating you so far? Yeah. Did you have a good new year? My

01:19.200 --> 01:24.880
2017. Okay, everyone who knows me by now knows that I'm kind of obsessed with Aggresive

01:24.880 --> 01:32.680
Retsuko. Watch episode 39 of Aggresive Retsuko. It's a minute and a half and that is exactly

01:32.680 --> 01:36.720
how I feel. What is that? I don't think I know. It's a Sanrio character. The office

01:36.720 --> 01:43.800
lady who's all sweet and kind of pushover and inside she's all rage. And drinks beer

01:43.800 --> 01:49.040
and sings death metal karaoke. Is that like the assistant from Monsters Inc. on the ride

01:49.040 --> 01:54.720
where she'll read you at the end of the ride? No. You need to see Aggresive Retsuko. Is

01:54.720 --> 02:03.280
it on Netflix? Well, they're all fan subbed up there anyway. But episode 39 is basically

02:03.280 --> 02:10.360
how my year has started. And how I feel about the rest of the year. Eat my fist Destiny.

02:10.360 --> 02:17.080
But not the game Destiny. No. Alright. Also say hello to Techmaster Loki. Hello. Hi Loki

02:17.080 --> 02:27.600
how are you? I'm fine. How is 2017 treating you so far? Fine. Same old same old just like

02:27.600 --> 02:32.480
last year? Yeah. Pretty much. Alright. How was your new year? It was okay. We just hung

02:32.480 --> 02:38.560
out at my mother-in-law's house. Sounds exciting. Well, she made food. So it was good. Okay.

02:38.560 --> 02:42.760
Food is good. Food is very good. Hope we have lots of great food to enjoy throughout this

02:42.760 --> 02:46.520
year. So yeah. It's our first show of 2017. We were gone for a little bit. Even though

02:46.520 --> 02:51.960
we did a show on Christmas. That was a lot of fun. We had the next couple weeks off.

02:51.960 --> 02:57.280
One for New Year's. And then I was at MAGFest last week. So I'm back. Actually, I was traveling

02:57.280 --> 03:02.620
back from MAGFest during the show. I was somewhere in the air above Chicago where I'd had my

03:02.620 --> 03:07.360
layover and yeah. So we weren't able to do a show last week. But now we're back and looking

03:07.360 --> 03:12.560
forward to all the conventions this year. Although actually nothing on my calendar yet.

03:12.560 --> 03:15.920
This is kind of the little break. I mean, the end of the year is always like, after

03:15.920 --> 03:19.680
Dragon Con, it's like there's a convention every month. But so far this year is looking

03:19.680 --> 03:24.620
pretty uneventful until Dragon Con is the first thing on my calendar for this year.

03:24.620 --> 03:25.620
So we'll see.

03:25.620 --> 03:27.640
What about Sake in the Arcade? You're forgetting.

03:27.640 --> 03:31.040
Oh, of course. Thank you. Well, here's the thing about Sake in the Arcade. I don't have

03:31.040 --> 03:35.000
to travel for that. That's just in our backyard. So I don't like that's kind of on a different

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
list in my mind. But no, that's a darn good point. Sake in the Arcade is coming up in

03:39.000 --> 03:43.480
April. And yes, OLR, we're going to be a part of that again. Very excited to be working

03:43.480 --> 03:49.160
with our pals from the Sake IGDA. I know they'll be back on the show at some point

03:49.160 --> 03:52.520
to talk about the event this year. So I'm looking forward to that.

03:52.520 --> 03:56.880
Anyway, we've had a pretty big week in gaming, right? So when we signed off at Christmas

03:56.880 --> 03:59.960
or last time you were here, because you were here for the Christmas show, Loki, last time

03:59.960 --> 04:05.800
we heard from you a month ago, we still had all these questions on the Nintendo Switch.

04:05.800 --> 04:09.120
And you know, I think I remember remarking, you know, by the time you're back on this

04:09.120 --> 04:13.880
show, we're going to have all our answers. Well, we got some of our answers this week.

04:13.880 --> 04:20.080
And we have some new questions. So let's kick off tonight's OLR talking about Nintendo Switch.

04:20.080 --> 04:23.840
First of course, I want to introduce you guys in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com

04:23.840 --> 04:27.760
where we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern

04:27.760 --> 04:34.640
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at vognetwork.com, vognetwork.com and YYR pointing out in our

04:34.640 --> 04:40.080
chat, aggressive Retsuko is freaking hilarious. You can find them on YouTube, though. Filters

04:40.080 --> 04:44.640
are often applied to avoid copyright strikes. And I see that stuff. Like they'll flip the

04:44.640 --> 04:48.560
image or they, they have a different aspect ratio or something.

04:48.560 --> 04:52.760
There's also, I put a link in the chat room to where I've been watching them all.

04:52.760 --> 04:58.260
JD in chat brings up Mag West. Yes. Thank you for bringing that up. I do want to attend

04:58.260 --> 05:02.360
Mag West for sure. I can't remember if that was April or August. I think it's August.

05:02.680 --> 05:05.960
Yeah. It's August because I remember thinking, oh gosh, I hope that's not the same time as

05:05.960 --> 05:11.480
DragonCon, but it's like the week before. So that's going to be a pretty crazy time,

05:11.480 --> 05:17.720
but, uh, bring it on, bring it on. I say, all right, off to the Nintendo Switch. So

05:18.520 --> 05:25.160
Loki. Yes. I know the longtime listeners are, you know, you, you've always been a critic of

05:25.160 --> 05:28.920
Nintendo, but it's not, you know, and again, I'm going to start off by saying this because

05:28.920 --> 05:32.760
I want to reinforce Jason's message of positivity at the top of the show, which I think is a good

05:32.760 --> 05:39.000
way to start 2017. Uh, I don't think anybody here hates Nintendo, but in fact, we love Nintendo

05:39.000 --> 05:46.040
and it kind of, it's, it's hard sometimes to watch them make what we view as careless mistakes.

05:46.040 --> 05:50.200
Would that be a fair way of putting it, Loki? A blatant oversight. Yes. Some oversight,

05:50.200 --> 05:55.400
Dark Sakura? The moment you said careless mistakes, I now want to hear the forthcoming

05:55.400 --> 06:00.920
rant with careless whisper play in the background. I can make that happen. So let's see. So Loki,

06:00.920 --> 06:05.880
uh, if you were to, we use, we use grades at vognetwork.com A through F. How are you

06:05.880 --> 06:10.280
feeling about the Nintendo Switch after everything you saw earlier this week?

06:10.280 --> 06:16.120
I don't know. Like I made the, you know, the quick decision to go ahead and pre-order one

06:16.120 --> 06:21.800
while I decided if I wanted it or not, because I figured it's going to be a clusterfuck trying to

06:21.800 --> 06:26.200
secure pre-order. And it was, I mean, cause they were pretty much like, oh, hey,

06:26.200 --> 06:32.760
it's up for pre-order and you know, gone in like an hour, you know? Yeah. I was lucky to get one

06:32.760 --> 06:38.280
on Amazon. Um, like they opened it up at midnight. It's like, okay, geez. Which I was like, yay. They

06:38.280 --> 06:41.240
opened it up while I'm still awake. But then I'm thinking in my head, I'm like, oh my God,

06:41.240 --> 06:45.960
East coast Twitter is going to be pissed in the morning. Like that was kinda, that was a weird

06:45.960 --> 06:49.720
time for them to turn the switch. I mean, cause the East coast kind of got screwed in that unless

06:49.720 --> 06:53.080
you're a night owl over there. But anyway, well, and that's the thing is I was going to wait for

06:53.080 --> 06:57.960
Amazon to stay up and do that. But then like, I had to go to sleep. I'm like, okay, well,

06:57.960 --> 07:03.400
it's almost midnight. They haven't put it up yet. Everyone else has, I'm just gonna go to sleep and

07:03.400 --> 07:07.720
wake up tomorrow. And sure enough, midnight, they put it up and it was gone. And so I ended

07:07.720 --> 07:13.640
up ordering it at target or something like that. And that's where I have it right now, but I don't

07:13.640 --> 07:18.440
know. They, and then of course GameStop opened up more pre-orders, but they're forcing those bundles

07:18.440 --> 07:22.680
and stuff like that, which I was actually okay with picking up one of them because the price

07:22.680 --> 07:27.160
difference was about 10 bucks and it came with two games, aside from Zelda, which I was going to get

07:27.160 --> 07:31.960
anyways. But then like when I went to order it, it was already gone. So they only had like $600

07:31.960 --> 07:38.360
bundles. I'm like, no. So if you put in a pre-order, you must be feeling some sense of

07:39.240 --> 07:41.640
desire for the system. There must be something you like.

07:41.640 --> 07:46.760
Here's the thing. Okay. So I'm, I like the fact that there's going to be, I like what the new

07:46.760 --> 07:51.400
Mario looks like. And I like, you know, the Mario Kart and all that stuff and Zelda, you mean Zelda

07:51.400 --> 07:57.560
looks fantastic. But then I really thought about what am I going to do with this? Okay. So like,

07:57.560 --> 08:04.680
for example, Mario Kart 8, it's basically Mario Kart 8 that was on the Wii U, but they added a

08:04.680 --> 08:09.480
couple more characters and fucking fixed battle mode, which should be a fucking patch to the

08:09.480 --> 08:15.640
original game. It shouldn't be its own game. I'm paying $60, 60 bucks to, you know, pat them on

08:15.640 --> 08:19.960
the back. Do we know that that's the final price for Mario Kart 8 deluxe? I'm pretty sure that's

08:19.960 --> 08:24.440
60 bucks. Well, but we don't, I want to see the receipts. Is it not Amazon pre-order?

08:24.440 --> 08:29.560
Knowing Nintendo, it's 60. They're charging $50 for one, two Switch, which is a piece of shit.

08:29.560 --> 08:33.160
Well, that's, I have some strong feelings on that. So they're charging 50 bucks for that. So

08:33.160 --> 08:39.480
sure as shit, they're going to charge $60 for Mario Kart 8 deluxe or whatever, which adds no

08:39.480 --> 08:44.440
extra tracks, no tracks whatsoever. It's just a fucking battle mode, which should have been the

08:44.440 --> 08:47.800
way it was in the first place. But battle tracks, battle tracks, right? Because there was talk

08:47.800 --> 08:51.720
about like Luigi's mansion and there's some, there's... Yeah, the battle mode tracks. Those

08:51.720 --> 08:56.680
are new, obviously, because the way they did battle mode before made no fucking sense whatsoever.

08:56.680 --> 09:00.360
And like, why am I patting you on the back for fixing something that was blatantly wrong to

09:00.360 --> 09:05.720
begin with? It does, I don't even understand why I would reward you with $60 of my money.

09:05.720 --> 09:08.840
And then the other thing I wanted to play was Skyrim, which isn't coming out till the fall.

09:08.840 --> 09:12.840
Why am I going to wait a fucking year to play a game that I have right now that I'm playing?

09:13.560 --> 09:17.240
And let's be honest, it's Nintendo we're talking about here. You really think they're going to have

09:17.240 --> 09:21.400
mod support in that system? Fuck no, they're not, because their system probably won't be able to

09:21.400 --> 09:25.640
handle it. It'll be too complex or some shit. I mean, that's... That doesn't mean people won't

09:25.640 --> 09:30.520
find a backdoor. It doesn't matter. I don't need to find a back... Why should I work on finding a

09:30.520 --> 09:36.760
backdoor for their system to play Skyrim that I can... I could literally spend $400, approximately,

09:37.320 --> 09:42.920
the price of the system and that to buy... Go towards another laptop to play Skyrim with mods.

09:42.920 --> 09:47.320
I mean, why would I want to pay, you know, extra money for that? And then really it came down to,

09:47.320 --> 09:51.480
okay, Zelda looks awesome. You know, I'm sure that, you know, on that system,

09:51.480 --> 09:54.920
it's going to be graphically better and stuff. And then I'm finding out that,

09:54.920 --> 10:01.480
okay, it runs 720p on the Wii U and 900p on the fucking Switch. I'm like, that's not much better.

10:01.480 --> 10:07.000
That's like... I thought they said that Mario... Oh, you mean Skyrim is, because I was like...

10:07.000 --> 10:11.960
No, I'm talking about Zelda. Zelda's going to run at 900p, upscale to 1080.

10:12.920 --> 10:19.400
Interesting. I know Mario Kart 8 is 1080p, 60 frames a second in one player mode on the TV.

10:20.360 --> 10:24.680
But then that's the thing is like games, like running portable on the games,

10:24.680 --> 10:28.840
doesn't... It will underclock them and they won't maybe run at 60 frames per second. So

10:28.840 --> 10:33.160
it's like all these things we don't know about it. And, you know, I came down to like,

10:33.160 --> 10:36.680
I'm thinking, well, what do I really want to play this? The new Mario game looks pretty nice. I mean,

10:36.680 --> 10:41.320
I've skipped a lot of the Mario games. So do I really need to pick a system up right now to

10:41.320 --> 10:46.200
basically have Zelda, which I could already get on the Wii U? And why am I dropping all this money

10:46.200 --> 10:51.240
for like no games coming out until the fall? It doesn't make any sense. It's like the 3DS all

10:51.240 --> 10:55.480
over again. I had... There's someone that was comparing it to the 3DS. And it kind of feels

10:55.480 --> 11:01.560
like that where it's like, okay, we're launching in March. It's gonna... There's... Zelda's great,

11:01.560 --> 11:06.200
but it's not a really solid lineup of titles coming out. And I feel that they're gonna like

11:06.200 --> 11:11.560
in August say, yeah, we fucked up. We're gonna need to drop the price of this. We're gonna need

11:11.560 --> 11:17.880
to do something, you know, to fix the problem. Because I'm just... I don't know. Unless people

11:17.880 --> 11:23.080
are really gonna get hyped up about these games. But hardware wise, it sounds cool. Like I like the

11:23.080 --> 11:27.560
idea that, you know, they have this, you know, enhanced rumble and everything with it. And

11:29.000 --> 11:34.200
those little things look pretty cool. But they're way too expensive. Like if I want to buy a second

11:34.200 --> 11:39.080
pair of those, that's like 80 bucks for control. I think controllers are expensive now. And that's

11:39.080 --> 11:43.480
even more expensive for shit. Fuck that. Why am I doing that? I kind of get it with the little

11:43.480 --> 11:47.560
the little joy cons because there's a lot of crap in those things. I mean, there's a lot going on

11:47.560 --> 11:52.600
with those. I was pretty surprised at what they were packing into that. But $70 for the Pro

11:52.600 --> 11:58.040
controller, that's some side eye right there. That's a little much. That's a little much. And

11:58.040 --> 12:02.200
I full on realize that PlayStation 4 controllers are not much better. They're like 60 bucks.

12:02.200 --> 12:06.040
But most of the time you can get them for 30. You can get them for half price most of the time. And

12:06.040 --> 12:10.360
then I'm talking like first party controllers. But that's the thing with Nintendo is it doesn't

12:10.360 --> 12:15.160
really drop the price and just... And then their online plan that they're charging for online.

12:16.120 --> 12:20.840
I don't know if I really am down with that. I mean, they really need to show me what they're

12:20.920 --> 12:24.680
bringing with it. And that's the problem is when pushed on it, what exactly it's gonna be.

12:24.680 --> 12:30.760
First off, you know, they're offering a game each month, which is like kind of on par with

12:30.760 --> 12:35.560
the other services that are out there, except those services offer four or more games every

12:35.560 --> 12:41.880
month. And it's for only that month. So you get the game. And I'm talking like a virtual console

12:41.880 --> 12:50.120
game. That's literally less than $5 value or $10. And then they're taken away at the end of the

12:50.120 --> 12:55.720
month. You only get it for the month. What kind of fucking backwards type of plan is that? When

12:55.720 --> 12:58.920
they know what the marketplace is, they better not be charging very much for it.

12:58.920 --> 13:01.800
I was gonna say, we don't know what Nintendo is charging for it. I think a lot of people

13:01.800 --> 13:05.880
are assuming that it's gonna be the same price as Microsoft and Sony, but we don't know what

13:05.880 --> 13:09.320
they're charging for it. It could be cheaper, which could position it.

13:09.320 --> 13:11.800
It could be. And then what am I getting with that? I mean...

13:12.760 --> 13:17.800
I'm kind of with you that Nintendo really has to convince us what you're getting with that.

13:17.800 --> 13:21.960
They're like putting all their network features on a fucking app for a phone.

13:22.600 --> 13:26.840
What the hell? This is a game console. I don't need my phone with me to fucking voice chat.

13:26.840 --> 13:31.880
If I want to voice chat, I have fucking Skype I can do that with. Or dozens of other apps that

13:31.880 --> 13:36.840
can do that. Why am I gonna pay you money to present an app for me that runs on my phone

13:36.840 --> 13:42.920
and not on the damn console in the first place to do voice chat for what? For what fucking reason?

13:42.920 --> 13:46.600
You know, this is the kind of work around shit that you'd have to do in like Mario Kart now,

13:46.600 --> 13:49.960
because they're too worried about the kiddies and shit. Is that what it is?

13:49.960 --> 13:52.920
Let me get to some of our chat comments over at live.vognetwork.com,

13:52.920 --> 13:55.080
and then I want to get to DarkSakura's thoughts on this.

13:55.880 --> 13:58.600
Going to chat, let's see. MegamanX400 says,

13:58.600 --> 14:02.120
The controllers are really expensive. Like, try living in Canada. $100.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.880
Yep. Not cheap, that's for sure. Let's see.

14:06.600 --> 14:12.120
Maya in chat says, At $299 with no pack-in, we're all paying the early adopter fee.

14:12.120 --> 14:19.160
Holiday 2017 will see the Switch at $249 with a pack-in game of either Splatoon 2, Switch 1-2,

14:19.160 --> 14:27.560
or both. I'm kind of with you on that. I think the biggest wince and the biggest mistake I think

14:27.560 --> 14:32.280
Nintendo made in that whole thing is that 1-2 Switch should be a pack-in game. Like,

14:33.640 --> 14:38.200
here's the thing. Here's the thing. When people, and I know where you're going with this, Loki,

14:38.200 --> 14:45.160
but again, what Nintendo did with the Wii and the Wii U is that they packed in the concept game

14:45.160 --> 14:52.280
with the system. And for the Wii, that drove buku bucks because people did not buy a Wii.

14:52.280 --> 14:57.080
Many people did not buy a Wii. People bought Wii Sports and the console that you needed to play it

14:57.080 --> 15:03.000
on. That's what people were buying. Nintendo Land, Lightning didn't strike twice. So I'm a little

15:03.000 --> 15:07.960
like, I'm a little thrown off by this 1-2 Switch thing not being included because it does seem

15:08.600 --> 15:15.480
a shoot-in-the-foot move where they're relying on the Zelda thing to push the console,

15:15.480 --> 15:23.400
and that maybe this 1-2 Switch is gonna be that word-of-mouth party thing maybe? I don't know.

15:23.400 --> 15:27.960
That game is fucking cringey. Like, I was getting serious cringe.

15:27.960 --> 15:30.760
See, I can't say that until I play it. I can't say that until I play it.

15:30.760 --> 15:35.560
Watch the videos. It's enough. Watching their demonstration video is fucking cringey as shit.

15:36.200 --> 15:40.040
What kind of games are they offering? Hey, we've got Table Tennis, but guess what you gotta do?

15:40.040 --> 15:44.760
You gotta pretend. You gotta pretend that you're playing Table Tennis. You just swing it to the

15:44.760 --> 15:50.600
ceiling. What the fuck kind of game is that? What about Wii Tennis? That's the same thing.

15:50.600 --> 15:55.480
You know what? Okay. Yeah, Wii Tennis is the same thing. No, it's fucking not. You know what the

15:55.480 --> 16:00.920
difference is? Rob, okay? If you right now look at me, look at me, and you swing your arm like

16:00.920 --> 16:06.040
you're playing tennis. That is the fucking game that's included with that. There is no display

16:06.040 --> 16:10.520
that shows players playing tennis. You don't see any sort of connection with your player playing

16:10.520 --> 16:14.600
tennis where you see a visual feedback of a ball bouncing around. All you have the Nintendo Switch

16:14.600 --> 16:19.240
doing is fucking sitting there as a table picture. Just saying, with the score on there.

16:19.240 --> 16:25.240
I'm just saying, when my friends come over and get drunk, that milking game is gonna be the funniest

16:25.240 --> 16:30.200
fucking thing that ever happened. But you know what? You know what? There's a million other

16:30.200 --> 16:34.760
things. When you're fucking drunk, everything is the most fucking hilarious thing ever.

16:34.760 --> 16:40.280
It doesn't fucking matter. Why should I pay $50 for a piece of shit game that promises,

16:40.280 --> 16:44.600
oh, maybe if my friends come over and get drunk, we'll be... As I recall, one person in this room

16:44.600 --> 16:49.320
has been drunk, kicked to the wall, and said he's in the Matrix. That was how many years ago?

16:49.320 --> 16:54.200
What does that matter? What is that relevant now? Proof of what people will do when they're drunk.

16:54.200 --> 16:58.120
It doesn't matter. But seriously, what is that saying that, oh, this game will be good when I'm

16:58.120 --> 17:04.200
fucking shit-faced? That means it's a shitty game. That's like how you date people.

17:04.200 --> 17:07.800
I like this comment from Bobby, and then I promise we're getting to Dark Sakura. Loki,

17:07.800 --> 17:12.440
zip it for a minute. Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, Skye, actually, the table tennis game is an

17:12.440 --> 17:17.560
audio game. You have to play by listening to the audio. Sturlok might actually love that. Remember,

17:17.560 --> 17:22.360
our blind gamer that calls into the show sometimes. So, fair counterpoint. All right,

17:22.360 --> 17:26.680
Dark Sakura, I'm dying to know your take on this whole thing. So I'm sure you and Dan

17:26.680 --> 17:29.800
watched this or the highlight reel or what have you. Where are you standing?

17:29.800 --> 17:30.440
I slept.

17:30.440 --> 17:32.280
You slept. Well, where are you at on this?

17:33.240 --> 17:36.600
We're not getting one. We're not pre-ordering one. We kind of don't care.

17:36.600 --> 17:37.960
Why? Because...

17:37.960 --> 17:41.560
I'm kind of surprised because of the Zelda thing. So you're just opting for Zelda on Wii U?

17:41.560 --> 17:46.920
We're getting it on Wii U. We don't want it on Switch. The whole plan is to pretty much wait

17:46.920 --> 17:50.760
for all the hype to die down and get it once there's a decent series of games on it. Like

17:50.760 --> 17:55.960
we did with the Wii U. We bought the Wii U when there were good games worth having a Wii U for.

17:55.960 --> 18:00.440
So it's kind of what one of our chatters, Maya, was saying earlier. The whole fact that it's

18:00.440 --> 18:03.560
almost a given that holiday, the price is going to drop and you're going to get a packing game.

18:03.560 --> 18:04.200
Pretty much.

18:04.200 --> 18:05.000
I see.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.560
I mean, and on top of that too, I mean...

18:10.760 --> 18:14.360
I hate to say it. We had too many damn games at my house.

18:15.720 --> 18:20.760
What? Who are you? What have you done with Dark Sakura? New year, new you? I don't like this.

18:21.480 --> 18:27.880
The Mario trailer looked fucking bizarre because he's, you know, Mario style in real world humans?

18:27.880 --> 18:34.040
No. That looks creepy as fuck. He only looks good in the non-human world. Dan and I were saying,

18:34.040 --> 18:37.240
this is like fucking Sonic Adventure. It should have been Sonic.

18:37.240 --> 18:38.840
There's a lot of people making that comparison.

18:38.840 --> 18:42.280
There's a lot of Sonic 06 comparisons, which is fantastic.

18:43.080 --> 18:49.320
And then at like at least five people sent me the link to Puyo Puyo Tetris. And guess what?

18:49.960 --> 18:55.800
I have it on PS4. I imported it. Actually, Dan imported it for me for my birthday.

18:56.440 --> 19:00.920
Very, very text heavy, but I figured out all the menus, so it's not a big deal.

19:01.640 --> 19:07.480
And we played the crap out of that, decided Puyo Puyo mode was more fun than Tetris mode,

19:07.480 --> 19:13.160
you know, and in versus Dan somehow liked the Tetris one. Anyway, it's a good game. Good game.

19:13.160 --> 19:17.960
Worth having. Worth having. I'm glad it's getting a US release. Not enough to make me buy a Switch.

19:19.720 --> 19:24.440
And like I said, we're getting Zelda on Wii U so that I can actually, you know, play it on

19:24.440 --> 19:28.760
on my pro control. I don't think we have a pro controller yet. No, I think we do. Anyway,

19:30.040 --> 19:34.600
I've got options. None of those other things coming out are things I give a crap about.

19:35.320 --> 19:42.040
So if I, one, don't give a crap about it, and number two, like saving money,

19:43.400 --> 19:48.680
what's the logical decision? Don't spend money on something I don't need.

19:48.680 --> 19:54.280
Don't spend money on something that won't enrich my life. I would rather buy myself,

19:54.280 --> 19:59.240
well, I'm going to be buying another Apple Watch anyway, but I would rather spend that money on

19:59.240 --> 20:05.000
something that's actually going to be useful and then wait until later on when there's going to be

20:05.000 --> 20:10.040
more stuff on it that I'm actually going to be interested in and then can justify spending the

20:10.040 --> 20:17.080
money on. Why spend money on hype? Okay, well, since I am going to be spending money on hype,

20:17.080 --> 20:22.840
I want to talk about my position on this because I have it preordered twice because I'm nervous

20:22.840 --> 20:27.160
that one of those preorders is going to be a joke and get yanked away because I was that paranoid

20:27.160 --> 20:32.120
about this whole limited quantity situation. But obviously I'm only going to get one of them,

20:32.120 --> 20:35.320
although I'm holding onto the second preorder because maybe I'll have a friend that's like,

20:35.320 --> 20:39.080
ah, I didn't get on it right away. So I'm going to wait to see how that plays out.

20:39.080 --> 20:45.320
But for the most part, I did preorder one. I plan on getting one. Again, I'm viewing it as

20:45.320 --> 20:49.080
a portable and I realized that Nintendo is telling you something different. I don't really

20:49.080 --> 20:55.000
care. I'm looking at it as a portable and I love it a whole lot more than when I look at it as only

20:55.000 --> 21:00.840
a console. When I look at it as a portable system, I get really excited about the potential to

21:00.840 --> 21:05.960
take this switch over to, let's say Flaco and his wife's house with Shane there or something

21:05.960 --> 21:09.480
like that. And we both have our switches, you know, and it's not like having to like unplug

21:09.480 --> 21:13.960
a completely different PlayStation 4 and all this stuff, which, which doesn't even support

21:13.960 --> 21:19.240
that type of LAN gaming very easily anyway. So the switch is going to make this, you know,

21:19.800 --> 21:24.520
in-house on the same network gaming very, very easy. And so I imagine that, okay,

21:24.520 --> 21:28.440
it's going to be very easy for me to just pick up the switch, go to somebody else's house,

21:28.440 --> 21:34.920
and we can play like four player Splatoon in the same place. Like having just come back from

21:34.920 --> 21:41.480
MagFest, like I am fucking excited about next year's MagFest. And the fact that most of my

21:41.480 --> 21:45.240
friends that are going are probably going to have switches and some of the epic games that

21:45.240 --> 21:49.560
are going to happen because Nintendo really does know how to make those multiplayer games.

21:50.280 --> 21:55.640
And I think things like Mario Kart, Splatoon, and yes, even though it's Mario Kart all over again

21:55.640 --> 22:00.360
in the same, the portable element and this new element of being able to have the multiple screens

22:00.360 --> 22:05.720
in one place where many people are playing, that's going to be a huge deal. And then, you know,

22:05.720 --> 22:09.960
stuff like Splatoon and whatever else Nintendo announces for the holiday. Cause I don't think

22:09.960 --> 22:14.760
we're done with 2017. I don't believe that the Mario game is the only game Nintendo's putting

22:14.760 --> 22:19.560
out this holiday. Oh, I'm sure they'll announce more ports of Wii U games. That might be where

22:19.560 --> 22:24.520
Smash Brothers is, but it's still even, even if it's Smash Brothers on those screens, that's still

22:24.520 --> 22:31.160
going to be a big deal. Again, because Smash Brothers on the 3DS, not so great Smash Brothers

22:31.160 --> 22:36.600
on the switch, I think has the potential to be awesome. And that's really what the system does

22:36.600 --> 22:42.520
for me is that potential of being able to really get up and go. And it's just, it's very different

22:42.520 --> 22:48.280
from the 3DS, like, because there are these, you know, larger, well, the only slightly larger

22:48.280 --> 22:53.480
screens to be fair, but the way it's just kind of designed to set up, it's very good for like a,

22:53.480 --> 22:58.680
the hotel room type of gaming or, you know, a living room thing where everybody's sitting

22:58.680 --> 23:03.080
around. I'm reminded of one of my first experiences, my very first experiences ever

23:03.080 --> 23:08.280
when I met Dark Sakura. Um, and it was actually at her house and they were having a local area

23:08.280 --> 23:12.360
Nintendo party, a LAN party and everybody, you know, keep in mind, this was, I've known Dark

23:12.360 --> 23:17.320
Sakura a long time, right? Cause we've been doing this show 15 years. This was like in 2002,

23:18.040 --> 23:24.040
I think it was the house. It was around the time when I lived at Bamani Melrose place. That was

23:24.040 --> 23:27.400
the end of 2001, right? Where if we had a pool, somebody would got pushed into it with all the

23:27.400 --> 23:31.640
drama. Yeah. So, okay. That was the end of 2001. I'm pretty sure this was around that timeframe.

23:31.640 --> 23:37.320
So I went over there and Dan was there and all, all his buddies, maybe mystique and people like

23:37.320 --> 23:40.920
that. People that are listeners have no idea who these people are. We're all sitting there

23:40.920 --> 23:46.040
and you had like, like you had like three TVs in the living room. There was like one TV back

23:46.040 --> 23:50.360
in your room and like all these people were there and you guys were like, I don't know if you were

23:50.360 --> 23:55.800
speed running, but you were having like a Zelda competition to see who yeah, who could get from

23:55.800 --> 24:03.240
the beginning of Zelda to the end, the fastest. And that was like, that was, but that was when

24:03.240 --> 24:07.400
I knew, by the way, for anybody who wants to know the history of this show, that's when I knew Jamie

24:07.400 --> 24:14.920
was my people was when I saw that whole thing going on. And I'm kind of like this for me,

24:14.920 --> 24:22.760
the switch is a little bit of that experience. I don't know. So I'm just, I'm, I'm jazzed about

24:22.760 --> 24:27.480
the potential, but that's not that I don't have my concerns. I do certainly have some concerns.

24:28.440 --> 24:34.440
I think it's weird that Nintendo is not talking about Netflix type of stuff and app support,

24:34.440 --> 24:39.240
because I think that is important in this day and age of, of consoles that we live in,

24:39.240 --> 24:44.360
whether they be portable or in the same room, I already expressed my concerns with one, two switch.

24:44.360 --> 24:50.360
I think that was a really bad move to not include one, two switch with, with the switch. I think

24:50.360 --> 24:53.400
that is a really, really bad move. I thought for sure when they showed it that that was going to

24:53.400 --> 24:59.160
be the packing game. I thought for sure too. And I just, I, again, I just don't think it's a smart

24:59.160 --> 25:05.560
idea to not put any type of packing game at all, uh, for a concept console such as the switch,

25:05.560 --> 25:09.800
but we'll see, we'll see how it goes for him. The March launch is going to prove to be interesting

25:09.800 --> 25:13.560
too. You know, we've been talking a lot about the launch lineup and all this stuff. What does

25:13.560 --> 25:18.760
2017 look like? You know, and I think this console is breaking a lot of our traditions,

25:18.760 --> 25:24.360
what we expect, because this isn't November. And I feel like Nintendo is going to drop this in

25:24.360 --> 25:31.000
March, but it's going to be a slow race until how does this thing really sell during the holiday?

25:31.000 --> 25:33.880
You know, and that's why I'm curious to see what kind of stunts Nintendo is going to pull out at

25:33.880 --> 25:39.800
E3 for the holiday season, you know? And unlike you guys, I was really into the Mario thing.

25:39.800 --> 25:45.400
I love the name, by the way, Mario Odyssey. I love that name. Um, and I was kind of digging it.

25:45.400 --> 25:50.920
Is he going to require that, um, all of Peach's suitors shoot an arrow through key holes,

25:51.560 --> 25:57.960
um, to prove that, you know, he's only the real Mario? Or is he, you know, or is there a bed made

25:57.960 --> 26:03.080
out of a tree trunk? Super Mario Odyssey of the mind. I'm actually referring to the Odyssey.

26:03.080 --> 26:09.480
I know you were. Anyway, uh, let's see, go into our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

26:09.960 --> 26:15.000
Um, May Command X 400 says, it's okay, Sky, don't let them rain on your parade. You enjoy that

26:15.000 --> 26:18.680
switch. Don't let them come for you. I'm not because everybody's allowed their opinion. And

26:18.680 --> 26:22.840
like, I, even though Jamie says she's not getting a switch, like I actually completely understand

26:22.840 --> 26:27.640
that viewpoint where she's looking at it going of these five games that are coming out the first day,

26:28.200 --> 26:32.200
I don't need to drop the money on it. So I'm going to wait and see if the deal gets sweeter

26:32.200 --> 26:37.480
come Christmas time. I feel like, um, I've gone up like five points and grown up and it sucks.

26:37.480 --> 26:42.120
Well, I feel the same way. I mean, it's just like,

26:43.240 --> 26:49.640
to be fair, there is a bit of, I'm a gamer and I have to have all the toys coming into play.

26:49.640 --> 26:55.880
Like if I was a more rational human being, I might be looking with similar eyes, the dark soccer is,

26:55.880 --> 27:02.440
but I'm not, here's my worry. Okay. My worry is I think the third party support is still going to

27:02.440 --> 27:07.240
be very fleeting on the system. I just don't think that even though EA was there talking about FIFA,

27:07.560 --> 27:11.800
it was fucking awkward as shit. I just don't think it's going to be there aside from,

27:11.800 --> 27:15.720
you're going to have the typical Ubisoft fare and all that, but it's just going to,

27:16.520 --> 27:20.840
it's going to come down to the same shit that fucking the Wii U ran into where,

27:20.840 --> 27:25.480
hey, our modern engines don't fucking run on this. And that's going to be a problem. Yes.

27:25.480 --> 27:29.160
I understand you want to be, you're not even more affordable at this point. You're actually

27:29.160 --> 27:33.880
more expensive than some systems, which doesn't make any goddamn sense. And yeah, the gimmick

27:33.960 --> 27:38.440
that you can take this places and stuff. Cool. That'll work for like a successor to the 3DS

27:38.440 --> 27:43.160
or something. But when it comes down to it, the end of the day, which is what this is for me.

27:43.160 --> 27:48.280
Okay. That's cool. But it's never going to perform as well as these other systems because

27:49.080 --> 27:56.520
you can't get these other franchises granted. Yes. The first party titles may help drive the

27:56.520 --> 28:02.120
system, but that's all you got because you can't run the call of duties or battlefields or all

28:02.120 --> 28:05.560
these other, what happens when the next elder schools game comes out? You know,

28:05.560 --> 28:08.760
they have Skyrim on here right now, but what happens when the next elder school six game

28:08.760 --> 28:13.480
comes out? It's fucking fantastic or fallout five or whatever the hell the next big thing is going

28:13.480 --> 28:19.320
to be. It's not going to run on this. And that's gonna, I know you people will play off like,

28:19.320 --> 28:23.080
Oh, well, whatever. You know, I have another console, but it's gonna affect shit because

28:23.080 --> 28:27.160
when they're looking at buying consoles, I want the one where all the best games are,

28:27.160 --> 28:30.520
but they'll have the handheld support. And there's some amazing 3DS games,

28:30.520 --> 28:35.480
things like Bravely Default that don't exist on consoles right now. So, I mean,

28:35.480 --> 28:39.400
I get what you're saying and I don't necessarily disagree. I think Skyrim is a poor choice,

28:40.040 --> 28:45.480
but I have heard people say, I'm excited to play Skyrim portable on the go and what have you.

28:45.480 --> 28:52.120
I, I, I think those folks are probably the minority. I think, I think Skyrim is a choice

28:52.120 --> 28:57.480
like releasing Arkham, uh, what was it? Arkham city or whatever on the Wii U or mass effect

28:57.480 --> 29:03.400
three on the Wii U. I think, you know, those were bad choices to release last year's games or

29:03.400 --> 29:08.920
six years ago's games on the Wii U. And here's the other thing now though, but see, you mentioned

29:08.920 --> 29:12.840
Bravely Default. Now you have a system basically that's, you're developing for like a console

29:12.840 --> 29:18.360
system because that's basically how it's set up. Before, when you're developing for 3DS,

29:18.360 --> 29:23.080
the port that to like a console would be a lot of work. Now it's not going to be. So what's to say

29:23.080 --> 29:29.080
that that stuff only has to go to the Switch. It's going to go everywhere. So why once again,

29:29.080 --> 29:33.320
am I picking up a Switch when it's not going to run the games that I want to play on it?

29:33.320 --> 29:38.040
I can't help but think Pokemon, which is a huge deal in the handheld world, but once again,

29:38.040 --> 29:43.240
that's a first party Nintendo title aside from first party Nintendo, it's going to suffer and

29:43.240 --> 29:47.880
let's, let's hope that first party can drive it. Cause it sure as hell didn't work for the Wii U.

29:47.880 --> 29:52.360
You know what would be kind of cool though, is if they did a version of Pokemon Go

29:53.080 --> 29:56.120
for the Switch that had an AR camera.

29:57.320 --> 30:01.720
See, I'm with you. It would have been awesome to support, you know, Pokemon Go for the Switch,

30:01.720 --> 30:05.320
except it doesn't have GPS built into it or data or anything else.

30:05.320 --> 30:07.560
And thank God it doesn't, or it would be more expensive.

30:07.560 --> 30:11.720
I don't think it would. Now I have a 50.

30:11.720 --> 30:19.160
Here's, here's my crazy get, get the tinfoil hat because if Nintendo is going to be using an app

30:19.160 --> 30:25.960
through your smartphone to do the voice chat, couldn't this Switch also use your smartphone

30:25.960 --> 30:29.800
for GPS? No, no, it can't.

30:29.800 --> 30:33.480
Why not? If it can use it, if it can use it for chat, why can't it use it for GPS?

30:33.480 --> 30:37.240
GPS doesn't work that way. You can't take a third-party source for GPS. You're going to

30:37.240 --> 30:40.040
include- Then what the fuck is the Pokemon Go Plus?

30:42.040 --> 30:46.280
That's a Bluetooth thing that it has nothing. It's running the app. It's just an extension

30:46.280 --> 30:51.240
of the app. It's not that your phone is still running that. All that's happening is you're

30:51.240 --> 30:56.200
having some extra feedback coming from an additional device. It's still your app on

30:56.200 --> 30:59.400
your phone running that thing. And couldn't the Switch leverage that the

30:59.400 --> 31:02.760
same way the Pokemon Go Plus does? But why would I even bother at that point?

31:02.760 --> 31:05.000
What's the point? It's like having a giant ass, like,

31:05.800 --> 31:10.920
watch or something that doesn't make any sense. Well, since you said watch, they do have the

31:10.920 --> 31:13.400
Go app on the watch. It doesn't make any sense. Let's put it

31:13.400 --> 31:21.000
this way. I bought my kids cheap ass tablets for Christmas, and those had GPS built into

31:21.000 --> 31:25.880
it. So you can't tell me that GPS is too fucking expensive to put into this device.

31:25.880 --> 31:29.240
It just doesn't make any sense. Whatever. You know what? That's not the direction that

31:29.240 --> 31:34.440
they're going. Fine. But I'm just, I'm worried that it's going to be the whole

31:35.320 --> 31:40.280
Wii U all over again, because they're so confident this is different enough. I just,

31:40.920 --> 31:43.960
you're under powering your console again, and it's going to hurt you.

31:45.400 --> 31:49.000
Okay, going to our chat, because I got to get more chat, because you guys are lighting up

31:49.000 --> 31:54.200
our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com. Maya saying the Wii U never saw Pokemon,

31:54.200 --> 31:59.640
never saw Fire Emblem, never saw Metroid, never saw any serious square JRPGs. The Switch

31:59.640 --> 32:03.960
should have all of those. Well, we're getting what? We have the Fire Emblem Musou, which,

32:03.960 --> 32:09.480
you know, is or isn't a real Fire Emblem game. But we do see some JRPGs on this thing, right?

32:09.480 --> 32:14.280
So, you know, there's that. Certainly, we got Dragon Quest 10 and 11.

32:15.400 --> 32:20.520
Shimagami Tensei was in one of those reveals. So, I mean, we're going to have some stuff on

32:20.520 --> 32:25.560
Switch. So, that's good. Let's see. Dungeon Buster in chat says, we'll see if EA and Ubisoft,

32:25.560 --> 32:29.880
among others, evaporate their support after a year or two. Yeah, that'll be telling. The FIFA

32:29.880 --> 32:35.000
thing, I mean, I know a lot of people, probably in the demographic that listen to this show,

32:35.000 --> 32:39.800
probably rolled their eyes at the whole FIFA thing. But that is the world's biggest game,

32:39.800 --> 32:44.520
even more so than Madden, because now we're talking the world, right? So, FIFA is a huge,

32:44.520 --> 32:49.800
huge game. So, the fact that that's on the Switch, that's something. But I'm curious to kind of see,

32:50.120 --> 32:55.000
what is the whole element of the portable and, you know, kind of some of those concepts they

32:55.000 --> 32:58.200
were showing in that early trailer, people playing on the rooftop and all that. Is that

32:58.200 --> 33:02.200
really going to benefit FIFA? I'm curious to see how that works out, because that's

33:02.760 --> 33:08.520
something that Xbox One and PlayStation 4 can do. The FIFA game that's going to be right on this is

33:08.520 --> 33:14.440
based off the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation or Xbox 360 versions of the game. They're still making

33:14.440 --> 33:19.400
it for those systems? Wow. Well, it makes sense. It makes sense. Yes, they are updating the

33:19.400 --> 33:24.280
rosters for it, but no, it is the version of the game that came out basically in 2012.

33:24.280 --> 33:29.400
They haven't updated it since the new systems came out, because the new versions of the game,

33:29.400 --> 33:34.920
obviously, are running on a different engine that, once again, the Switch cannot run.

33:37.240 --> 33:41.400
Let's see, some folks in chat talking about Ultra Street Fighter 2. Needlecrash says,

33:41.400 --> 33:46.520
I'm getting Ultra Street Fighter 2. I was very surprised, but I'm not paying that $40 price tag.

33:47.160 --> 33:51.560
So yeah, the Ultra Street Fighter looked really interesting, except it does just look like that

33:51.560 --> 34:00.040
HD remix with two additional characters just shoehorned in there. It's like SVC chaos.

34:02.120 --> 34:05.720
Not the best comparison. You know, if it's 40 bucks, I'm certainly not going to buy it.

34:05.880 --> 34:12.200
The HD edition was only, what, like 20? Maybe. I'm curious about that. Let's see, a couple other

34:12.200 --> 34:17.720
comments in chat over at live.vognetwork.com. DungeonBusters brings up Xenoblade 2 and Project

34:17.720 --> 34:23.480
Octopath Traveler. Those are some JRPGs that were shown for the system. Yeah, I'm really excited

34:23.480 --> 34:28.280
about Xenoblade 2, that's for sure. I hope that's a holiday title. They said that was 2017, so that

34:28.280 --> 34:34.760
could be another big release for them for the holiday. We'll see. So anyhow, Loki, we've been

34:34.760 --> 34:38.520
bantering a lot in studio about our opinions, and obviously we have some big thoughts here,

34:38.520 --> 34:44.040
but I'm curious about any news we might have missed about what's going on on the Switch,

34:44.040 --> 34:47.800
like that came out of the press conference we haven't talked about yet. I know one thing,

34:47.800 --> 34:53.640
actually, is the whole fact that the virtual console games might be online, which I've been

34:53.640 --> 34:57.400
hemming and hawing on this show for forever is something a virtual console should be doing.

34:57.400 --> 35:03.000
So the fact that that could actually be happening is really exciting to me. And I know some of you

35:03.000 --> 35:08.680
are like, big effin' deal old games, but I'm like, this is gonna be awesome that I can play

35:08.680 --> 35:15.560
something like Mario Brothers 3 with my friends who live in another state. I love that idea,

35:15.560 --> 35:19.560
so I really hope it's true that the virtual console games are online. And this is not anything

35:19.560 --> 35:22.520
they said in the presentation, they haven't really talked about virtual console games.

35:22.520 --> 35:26.200
If you go to their website, though, where it talks about the whole one game a month for free,

35:26.200 --> 35:30.520
although yes, it has borders as we found out, it talks about that the Super Nintendo games

35:31.400 --> 35:36.760
have this online capability, but obviously they're gonna need to detail that in the next,

35:36.760 --> 35:41.400
what, six weeks before this thing is out. Seven weeks, I don't know. Somebody give me a calendar.

35:41.400 --> 35:44.840
But there's not a lot of time before this thing comes out, so I don't know if they're drip feeding

35:44.840 --> 35:49.560
information to try to keep the Switch in the news every week, because that could be something

35:49.560 --> 35:53.960
Nintendo's doing where it's like, this next week we'll talk about Netflix, and then we'll talk

35:53.960 --> 35:59.400
about the next week virtual console, so that way it keeps bubbling up on the gaming press every

35:59.400 --> 36:04.680
single week. That could be Nintendo's strategy leading into March 3rd, I don't know.

36:04.680 --> 36:08.760
Or they have no fucking clue on what's going on, because people ask them like,

36:08.760 --> 36:13.400
so what does this networking thing have? Well, stay tuned for some more information.

36:14.200 --> 36:18.840
Dude, you're fucking selling a console that's coming out in six weeks. Have some fucking details

36:18.840 --> 36:23.720
already. We've already been waiting how fucking long to find out the details, and you're dicking

36:23.720 --> 36:28.200
me around some more because, oh, I'm sorry, we can't really tell you the details. Ha ha, it's

36:28.200 --> 36:33.640
a secret. I mean, fuck you guys, seriously. I kind of think since those things have to already

36:33.640 --> 36:38.360
be starting on assembly lines, there's some semblance of what's in that operating system.

36:38.360 --> 36:43.160
There has to be, there has to be. We're running out of time. So I do think it's more the drip

36:43.160 --> 36:48.280
feed. This isn't, this is an intentional drip feed of information. Nintendo really wanted to

36:48.280 --> 36:52.600
steer the conversation to one place after this reveal with all the press they're going to get,

36:52.600 --> 36:55.720
and they're going to continue to drive the conversation where they want it to be. That's

36:55.720 --> 37:03.960
just, that's how this industry works. It's fucking dumb. It seriously is fucking dumb

37:03.960 --> 37:09.080
at this point that they're going to be doing this kind of crap, but whatever. I mean, people are

37:09.080 --> 37:14.360
going to buy the shit out of it because it's a Nintendo. Let's see, going to our chat over at

37:14.360 --> 37:19.960
live.vognetwork.com, MegaManX400 says, my point overall is that most core gamers are complaining

37:19.960 --> 37:24.440
that this won't have the games they want, yet they probably already have one other console already,

37:24.440 --> 37:29.080
probably had two consoles last gen. So what's wrong with owning a PS4 and a Switch?

37:30.040 --> 37:33.240
Nothing, if you have that kind of money, which not everybody does.

37:33.240 --> 37:36.280
Let me put it this way. Here's what's wrong with that. Because as you get older,

37:36.840 --> 37:42.120
like before that one, the Xbox 360 gen, I had an Xbox 360, a PlayStation 3, and a Wii.

37:43.160 --> 37:48.040
You realize when you have three systems that you're not playing on all three systems,

37:48.040 --> 37:52.680
that that's just money basically being thrown away because you end up really gaming on one

37:52.680 --> 37:58.120
system or maybe one or two if you're playing those exclusives. Later on, you get smarter and

37:58.120 --> 38:02.920
you decide, hey, this gen, I'm not going to buy every single system because you actually sit down

38:03.640 --> 38:07.480
instead of getting caught up in the hype, you look at what's coming out for it and like, listen,

38:07.480 --> 38:12.440
most of the games are going to be on all these platforms except for this exclusive, this

38:12.440 --> 38:16.920
exclusive. What is most important for me to play? And you make your decisions that way because,

38:18.040 --> 38:22.440
and once again, yeah, you may pick up a Switch because you want to play some of those Nintendo

38:22.520 --> 38:31.080
games, but that's, for me, if I wanted to pick up a Switch, it's the prospect of, hey, I can take

38:31.080 --> 38:36.760
games like Skyrim or these other games on the go and be able to play these, I can take my console

38:36.760 --> 38:41.800
to work and play it on break or something like that. That's exciting, but I'm not going to be

38:41.800 --> 38:46.600
able to play the newest Call of Duty on break on that console because it won't run on it or

38:47.480 --> 38:50.680
it's not going to be available for it or it's just going to be Mario games.

38:51.400 --> 38:59.160
I just, I, and why would you argue to try to be the second system in a house? Why would you

38:59.160 --> 39:05.480
race the second place? That makes no sense. Second, I get you're still the first handheld

39:07.400 --> 39:11.000
because everybody else hasn't gotten into the market because tablets are out there because

39:11.000 --> 39:16.040
it's maybe not viable for Sony could have Sony still might if this works out.

39:16.040 --> 39:22.440
Oh, you know what though? You laugh about that because they try to make a more compact console

39:22.440 --> 39:26.440
before, but if they just said, fuck it, we're just going to make this giant tablet like console.

39:26.440 --> 39:31.320
To be fair, to be fair, it is still working in Japan and I still kind of failed to see

39:31.320 --> 39:35.320
this whole disconnect between why the Vita is not being pushed more here.

39:36.040 --> 39:42.120
I'm just saying if they're successful, I mean, it's not unlike Sony and Microsoft to try to

39:42.120 --> 39:46.280
copy something, but I think with Microsoft, they wouldn't really do it too much because you have

39:46.280 --> 39:51.960
the surface tablets, which are, you know, kind of the surface pros can do some like gaming.

39:51.960 --> 39:56.760
So that's almost like this, I guess, you know, you can kind of take it on the go.

39:56.760 --> 39:59.560
So that's kind of the equivalent there. Sony doesn't really have anything like that,

39:59.560 --> 40:03.960
but I can see them coming out with another handheld system. I mean,

40:05.240 --> 40:09.000
who's to say they wouldn't do it if it's insanely popular? I just don't know.

40:09.000 --> 40:14.200
And once again, too, you know, remember with the 3DS, they had all these amazing

40:14.200 --> 40:18.680
tech pieces that were a part of that, like the whole, you know, that was the thing that

40:18.680 --> 40:24.440
got me hyped about the 3DS was like all this, you know, glasses free 3D, which is like pretty

40:24.440 --> 40:29.960
awesome. And then the AR stuff, which is pretty awesome. And then they just totally put that to

40:29.960 --> 40:35.000
the wayside. It's just a portable system. So, you know, with the Switch, is everybody really

40:35.000 --> 40:38.200
taking it as a portable system or we can just like all these extra features that the Joy-Cons

40:38.200 --> 40:41.560
can do. We're just going to say, eh, whatever, we're just going to we're just going to game on

40:41.560 --> 40:46.440
it and we're not going to do all these games. It's just going to be playing traditional games.

40:46.440 --> 40:47.480
Is that bad?

40:47.480 --> 40:52.200
It's not bad, but that's but once again, then why put all this stuff, their garbage into your

40:52.200 --> 40:59.000
console that's going to cost extra money? I mean, I don't know. I just. I think waiting might be a

40:59.000 --> 41:06.120
good idea just because I think everything is just too chaotic right now. We don't know what is it

41:06.680 --> 41:10.200
slightly expensive. There's not a lineup of games. It's just.

41:12.280 --> 41:15.400
I just don't want to get caught up in the hype. And I felt like when I first placed that preorder

41:15.400 --> 41:18.600
that I was kind of getting caught up in the hype and I want to get it in on that. And I was like

41:18.600 --> 41:23.480
super excited. And I started like reading up more of it and just like listening to like the

41:23.480 --> 41:27.800
information coming back from it. And like, no, this makes any sense. Why? Why am I doing this?

41:28.520 --> 41:28.920
I don't know.

41:31.080 --> 41:35.080
Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com. Mega Man X 400 says realistically,

41:35.160 --> 41:38.840
Nintendo is in last. Should they shoot for first? Yes. Are they going to hit that in one new

41:38.840 --> 41:44.680
console? No. So aiming for second might not be bad. Flaco Jones says I do want a system for

41:44.680 --> 41:50.840
Splatoon 2 and Mario looks great. Not that it'll actually come out this year. The Immortal Gamer

41:50.840 --> 41:55.960
says, man, I love Loki. Not in that way. LOL. He's very rational where I find most aren't.

41:57.000 --> 42:02.280
Let's see. YYR says, I see a lot of folks saying I'll wait for a non-portable version with a pro

42:02.280 --> 42:06.920
controller for $200. And Maya follows that up with, they'll, they're going to be waiting a

42:06.920 --> 42:12.600
while. You know what? You say that, but here's, here's my theory. You know, this is a little bit

42:12.600 --> 42:18.120
foil hat, but like VR is still in its infancy right now, but that really takes off. You bet

42:18.120 --> 42:21.960
your ass you're going to see a fucking portable version of this. That's going to be 10 AP where

42:21.960 --> 42:27.160
they can use VR because 720 P and VR will look like fucking shit. That's never going to happen.

42:27.160 --> 42:31.000
You're never going to be able to have like a device to plug it in and have it look nice.

42:31.000 --> 42:34.040
So that's where another version of the system will come in.

42:34.040 --> 42:36.280
Does Gear VR do 1080?

42:37.160 --> 42:41.080
Gear VR, it's a phone resolution. Phones are over 1080 P.

42:41.080 --> 42:41.480
Okay.

42:41.480 --> 42:45.320
I mean, and you know, the resolution's a lot smaller, smaller screens. So

42:47.400 --> 42:50.440
actually, yeah, six inch screen is going to look really weird on your face anyways,

42:50.440 --> 42:56.840
but you know, let's just say that you did it. The resolution is just not there for VR,

42:56.840 --> 42:59.640
so they're not going to be able to do something like that. But if that takes off,

42:59.640 --> 43:01.000
that may be something that they look into.

43:01.000 --> 43:04.280
I'm not really, I mean, I can see what you're saying. I'm not really interested in Nintendo

43:04.280 --> 43:08.040
getting into the VR game. That pool's got, that pool has too many players in it right now.

43:09.080 --> 43:14.280
And so I, I, I just, I'm not really interested in Nintendo's take on VR right now. Like I know,

43:14.280 --> 43:17.800
I know that sounds kind of, I don't know, but I just, I'm not really interested in

43:17.800 --> 43:24.280
Nintendo's take on VR. Like I want them to focus on building the console and attracting the third

43:24.280 --> 43:29.160
parties and, you know, making that console a must have console that separates itself a little bit

43:29.240 --> 43:33.400
from Xbox one and PlayStation four, where, you know, a lot of the overlap really is.

43:34.120 --> 43:38.680
And a lot of that is due to Nintendo's strong first party and their, the nature that they just,

43:38.680 --> 43:44.200
they don't develop for anything, but their own console, except now, of course we have the mobile

43:44.200 --> 43:50.040
thing going on. So who knows? I'm very curious to see how that whole thing plays out where you have

43:50.040 --> 43:55.400
the mobile phone and the switch thing kind of coexisting because Animal Crossing's future is

43:55.400 --> 43:59.000
on mobile device. You know, you didn't hear anything about Animal Crossing on the switch,

43:59.000 --> 44:01.800
and I think that's because it's, it's going to now be the mobile thing.

44:02.360 --> 44:05.560
Which is too bad because I think it'd be good on the switch style, but.

44:06.760 --> 44:10.120
I think it would be, it would be, but also I'm like, if it's going to be the same

44:10.120 --> 44:16.040
fucking formula that it was in 2002, then leave it on mobile devices. Cause Animal Crossing

44:16.040 --> 44:20.920
hasn't changed enough in those years. Unless the switch is like a new take on it.

44:20.920 --> 44:25.480
We haven't mentioned yet the other things that kind of bothered me a bit. 32 gigs of onboard

44:25.480 --> 44:33.240
storage. Really? Yeah. I, I got to admit, I was not impressed with that either. I mean,

44:34.120 --> 44:39.720
I understand that because this uses cartridges, cartridges, like 3DS has used cartridges.

44:39.720 --> 44:43.720
I understand that these things are not going to need to install a bunch of data. Like I'm not

44:43.720 --> 44:47.800
going to, allegedly, I'm not going to have a 40 gigabyte install. Like I have on PlayStation

44:47.800 --> 44:54.680
four of dragon age or whatever. Like that's just not going to exist in this world. So,

44:54.680 --> 44:59.160
I mean, there is that, that, but if you want to download games, where the hell are you going to

44:59.160 --> 45:03.160
put them? Micro SD cards? You're going to have to get a micro SD card. Which is fine. At least

45:03.160 --> 45:08.040
it's not proprietary. It's still an added expense. You know what? Nintendo should be applauded for

45:08.680 --> 45:15.640
non-proprietary stuff like the micro SD. Exactly. Sony didn't do that. USB charging.

45:16.200 --> 45:23.400
That's great. And most of all, I think one place where Nintendo should be patted on the ass is the

45:23.400 --> 45:27.800
fact that this console is region free. We haven't brought that up yet. Finally, Nintendo is making

45:27.800 --> 45:32.760
the right call in that department. We don't live. I mean, the internet has broken down a lot of

45:32.760 --> 45:39.560
these walls. Region free is the place to be. And this also means Taiko no Tatujin easily on my

45:39.560 --> 45:45.240
Nintendo switch. So yay. Although I guess they are supposedly releasing one locally, Taiko Drum

45:45.240 --> 45:48.840
Master, I guess it's going to, so you're going to have two different, you're going to have the

45:48.840 --> 45:56.120
US version, the Japanese version anyway, but that's very exciting in my opinion. So let's see.

45:57.720 --> 46:05.640
Alan Alchemy in chat says it's the year of our Beyonce 2017. Bidding should start at 64 gigs for

46:05.640 --> 46:12.200
a budget model. Let's see. The Immortal Gamer says I'm still smarting for my PlayStation VR purchase.

46:12.200 --> 46:16.680
Wonder what I'm going to do with the thing. Act Def says, wait, there's going to be a localized

46:16.680 --> 46:20.920
version of Taiko for the switch. I don't quote me on it, but I thought I heard somewhere that

46:20.920 --> 46:24.840
there is going to be a US version and a Japanese version, but even if there's not a US version,

46:24.840 --> 46:30.040
the good news is I can just import the one from Japan. I can get Dragon Quest 10 from Japan.

46:30.040 --> 46:34.680
Not that it's necessarily going to run. And to be fair, they didn't say that region,

46:35.480 --> 46:39.400
region free was going to be like a mandatory thing. It sounds like developers could still

46:39.400 --> 46:44.040
lock regions out if they wanted to. Although that's not going to be good press if they do,

46:44.040 --> 46:51.560
but with Dragon Quest 10 being mostly online, I could kind of see it. Who knows? So anyway,

46:51.560 --> 46:55.480
anything else on the switch that we haven't gone over yet that we need to? Loki?

46:55.480 --> 47:03.160
I'm trying to think here. Well, they announced colors when it came out so you can get red and

47:03.160 --> 47:08.520
blue. I have the gray one on order. Yeah. A lot of my friends are getting the neon red and blue

47:08.520 --> 47:15.160
thing, but I'm really bothered by the fact that there's not the consistent color. So I had to get

47:15.160 --> 47:20.520
the gray one because it just, it clashes. I don't like that it doesn't match. It's weird. That's my

47:20.520 --> 47:24.520
thing. What do you think about the fact that they're not bringing Miiverse or Street Passes

47:24.520 --> 47:29.080
to the switch? I almost thought, see, like had I not seen the screenshots or whatever I think

47:29.080 --> 47:34.520
from Mario Kart, I thought that they were getting Rameses altogether, which I thought was probably

47:34.520 --> 47:38.200
a good thing. Yeah. That is a little weird that they're not bringing Miiverse over.

47:39.320 --> 47:43.800
I'm okay with Miiverse not coming over. Miiverse was an interesting concept, but it just,

47:43.800 --> 47:50.040
I just, it wasn't a very easy thing to use. Miiverse is fucking clunky. That's my biggest

47:50.040 --> 47:55.720
bitch about it. Like I should be able to press a button, but Miiverse like the way it works in

47:55.720 --> 48:02.040
practice is horrible. Just like when I bring up my Twitter feed on my smartphone, I hit a button and

48:02.040 --> 48:06.600
it's up in under five seconds. Like that's what needs to happen with Miiverse and it doesn't. So

48:06.600 --> 48:15.160
I think that's one of my big problems with it. But the Street Pass thing, I kind of like that.

48:15.160 --> 48:22.600
So I hope that Nintendo has some type of like substitute. Like I like the idea of you get data

48:22.600 --> 48:26.200
from other people that then can be imported in the games. Are we still doing friend codes?

48:26.760 --> 48:32.440
Let's hope not. I don't think so. I really don't. I mean, cause, and I would say the reason why I

48:32.440 --> 48:37.240
feel that we're not is they're the only ones that does it well, but if you look at what they're

48:37.240 --> 48:42.120
doing on the mobile devices, you connect through Facebook or Twitter and you can find your friends

48:42.120 --> 48:47.720
and add them. You don't need any type of code. And I feel like that could be where they're going with

48:47.720 --> 48:52.120
the switch is that they're just going to leverage existing social media as opposed to try to create

48:52.360 --> 48:58.760
their own. I really feel like that's where that's going. So let's see, I'm trying to think if

48:58.760 --> 49:05.560
there's any other news. Battery life, was it two to six hours, depending on what you're running?

49:06.680 --> 49:12.040
Something's all right. Yeah, I guess that's okay. I mean, that seems comparable to a 3DS.

49:12.040 --> 49:16.440
Maybe you're getting a little less life, but. But I mean, that's also going to be something

49:16.440 --> 49:23.800
could be solved with third party accessories as well. Then I haven't really seen a lot of

49:23.800 --> 49:28.840
details, but I know that, you know, with it running off the battery versus plugged in,

49:28.840 --> 49:36.360
there's definitely frame rate issues with that. So I don't know. Can we talk a little bit about

49:36.360 --> 49:41.480
Bomberman? Because this is a case of, well, A, it's one of the launch titles on the switch and

49:41.480 --> 49:46.200
it's Bomberman and they'll have a lot of people excited. B, it's Konami making a game,

49:47.320 --> 49:52.440
which is somewhat, you know, newsworthy in itself. Thoughts on the fact that Bomberman

49:52.440 --> 49:56.040
is coming for the switch? Is this something you're excited for? Nope, because fuck Konami.

49:56.840 --> 50:03.800
I have to admit, I'm in a similar boat. It looks, it's seriously, it looks average at best and fuck

50:03.800 --> 50:09.400
Konami. I'm not going to jump in and buy it day one. If it's something where I watch other people

50:09.400 --> 50:14.440
play it and they're having a whole lot of fun and really excited with it, I'll reconsider.

50:15.000 --> 50:19.800
But because I have hesitations that Konami is incapable of making a good game anymore,

50:20.760 --> 50:25.560
I can't say I'm going to jump in and get a day one. I have Super Bomberman 2 on the Super

50:25.560 --> 50:31.400
Nintendo and a multi-tap. Well, there's not just like the fact that you might have the old stuff

50:31.400 --> 50:37.080
lying around, but also the last Bomberman I remember getting that was on Xbox live or

50:37.080 --> 50:42.040
whatever. I don't remember being that great. You know what I mean? Like I was going to be

50:42.040 --> 50:45.560
unpopular opinion time. I kind of think Bomberman is one of those things that's kind of run its

50:45.560 --> 50:49.560
course. Well, this one is supposed to have eight player multiplayer. So I guess that can be,

50:49.560 --> 50:56.920
all right, that could be cool. I guess, but I mean, I don't know. It just, it, no. And even

50:56.920 --> 51:02.520
like the new like street fighter, ultra street fighter two, I'm just like, kind of, is that

51:02.520 --> 51:07.240
really the best you got? I mean, is that what you're offering? It's like, you have a brand

51:07.240 --> 51:12.680
new console. Let's make a splash with a remaster of a fucking old, I mean, don't get me wrong.

51:12.680 --> 51:17.400
Street fighter two is awesome, but come on. I mean, really? Yeah. What's going to elevate

51:17.400 --> 51:23.960
this to 2017. I mean, you did street fighter four in the 3DS. I mean, shit, the very least

51:23.960 --> 51:27.320
you could do something. I'm still happier at street fighter two than street fighter five.

51:28.360 --> 51:31.800
Well, yes. You know, I know it's not going to be street fighter five, but I'm like, come on,

51:31.800 --> 51:39.560
you did street fighter four on the, you know, the 3DS. I don't know. It just seems very silly.

51:39.560 --> 51:44.040
Um, needle crash in chat says, uh, former Hudson soft employees were involved in making

51:44.040 --> 51:49.080
super bomber manner. That's a fair point. Um, you know, they, they paid the people to do it. So

51:49.080 --> 51:55.240
again, I'll give it a chance. I'm just not buying it day one. I want to, you know, see the live

51:55.240 --> 52:00.280
stream, see my friends playing it, see some of that reaction first before I make a decision.

52:00.280 --> 52:05.880
I'm not just going to jump in on nostalgia alone because my hate boner for the direction that that

52:05.880 --> 52:11.400
company has been going in for a while now kind of exceeds, um, and my love of BOMBERMAN. Does

52:11.400 --> 52:15.720
the joy con have six buttons? Yes. All of them do. There's the tiny, tiny, tiny little LNR.

52:15.720 --> 52:21.960
Oh my God. Was it? So yeah, the joy cons, you've got the, the one good joy con and the one janky

52:21.960 --> 52:26.520
joy con that has the fucking analog in the middle. That's going to be interesting. That's for sure.

52:27.000 --> 52:31.160
Uh, Maya says, can we talk about how insanely awesome that Zelda trailer was? That

52:31.160 --> 52:37.320
trailer was like, awesome. Yeah. And to maybe end this discussion on a positive note,

52:37.320 --> 52:42.920
that trailer gave me a huge nerd boner. It was awesome. And that was like my, my complaint, you

52:42.920 --> 52:45.960
know, before was Zelda was like some of the footage that they're showing, like how they did

52:45.960 --> 52:49.800
like that live footage during everywhere. The last like live thing that they did where they

52:49.800 --> 52:54.520
stream some like footage of Zelda. It's just kind of like, well, I've already seen this before,

52:54.520 --> 53:00.440
but that trailer was fantastic. I'm freaking excited about voice acting in Zelda. Hello.

53:00.440 --> 53:05.000
That was amazing to hear. Uh, is that Zelda is going to be getting voice acting now.

53:05.880 --> 53:09.720
Yeah, it looks, I mean, it's going to be a fantastic, I have no doubts whatsoever

53:09.720 --> 53:15.880
that it gives me fantastic. Yeah. I'm very excited about that. All right. Well, I think

53:15.880 --> 53:19.560
in the interest of time, but dark soccer, one more thing. Well, just something,

53:19.560 --> 53:24.040
if we are ending the topic, there is something that we need to announce as a thank you.

53:24.520 --> 53:30.360
Okay. To one of our listeners, Martin, who gave us all this chocolate. What's that have to do

53:30.360 --> 53:34.600
with the switch? Because you were ending the topic. I see. All right. I was moving forward

53:34.600 --> 53:38.760
to thank him before we got into stories. That's true. Yes. Thank you for, um, when I decided to

53:38.760 --> 53:43.080
start a diet two days ago, thank you for drowning us in chocolate. Although eating one of these

53:43.080 --> 53:47.400
right now, I will say what's amazing is that there's actual stroopwafel in there, not the

53:47.400 --> 53:51.560
liquor that we were having on the Christmas show, but actual stroopwafels. And that made me go,

53:52.520 --> 53:57.800
so, wow. Even Loki's taken something. I never see him. I never see him pull from the food pile.

53:57.800 --> 54:03.480
He's a picky eater. What's this banana banana is like a banana cream. And it's super good.

54:03.480 --> 54:10.680
That sounds amazing. Can't wait. All right. Uh, let's get into how was your gaming week?

54:10.680 --> 54:14.600
Uh, we usually like to do this towards the top of the show. Talk about the types of video games that

54:14.600 --> 54:18.760
we have been playing this week. So dark soccer, we'll start with you. How was your gaming week?

54:18.760 --> 54:24.040
Wow. Just a lot of world of Warcraft. Pretty much. I haven't really had time for much else.

54:24.040 --> 54:29.400
And so not really even a lot of it, just a decent been playing that and then been watching awesome

54:29.400 --> 54:33.880
games done quick. Oh yeah. That, that was fun to watch this week. Yeah. Save the animals,

54:34.840 --> 54:39.480
which they did. That was the winner. That was interesting to see how that whole

54:39.480 --> 54:45.720
bid war played out there. And I'm glad that they, because, um, I had forgotten all about the, um,

54:45.720 --> 54:51.080
the Crouch trick for mother brain. And then remembered that, like, I found that by accident

54:51.080 --> 54:56.280
years and years ago, but it's, it's awesome. It's a good trick. Yeah. Cool. All right. Uh,

54:56.280 --> 55:01.400
Loki, how was your giving week? Um, I tried to place, you know, purposely cause my giving weeks

55:01.400 --> 55:06.120
in the last few weeks have been just pretty much the similar. Um, so I tried to play different

55:06.120 --> 55:09.320
things this time. I actually played a little bit of PlayStation VR. So actually most of the

55:09.320 --> 55:14.200
PlayStation VR that I've been doing is because my wife's been hogging the TV. So I've been using the

55:14.200 --> 55:19.720
place Skyrim on because it works as a second screen except my God, can we already fix the

55:19.720 --> 55:25.240
stupid screen drifting problem already? Like I hate having the recent or that thing like every

55:25.240 --> 55:30.840
minute or so it's just irritating. But other than that, it works all right. And it works great as

55:30.840 --> 55:35.960
a screen. Um, I tried this one, they had like a little free, I guess it's like a video or

55:35.960 --> 55:40.200
something called Gary, the goal, which is kind of funny. Um, so that I try that out. It's pretty

55:40.200 --> 55:44.440
neat. Um, he basically is a seagull that's trying to get you to look away so they could eat your

55:44.440 --> 55:52.360
food. Um, so I thought that was kind of cute and it was free. Um, what else? I started, they had

55:52.360 --> 55:56.600
the tentacle remastered since that was one of the free games that we got with, um, PlayStation plus

55:56.600 --> 56:02.760
this month. So, um, you know, I apparently remember quite a bit of that game and I'm almost

56:02.760 --> 56:07.080
already finished with it after just, I can't remember, I couldn't remember how short of a

56:07.080 --> 56:11.800
game that is. Um, so I'm, you know, playing through that a little bit. Um, it's still pretty

56:11.800 --> 56:16.360
funny. I tried playing with the developer's commentary on and that got irritating really

56:16.360 --> 56:23.480
fast. So I had to shut that off, unfortunately. Um, what else? I then of course, you know,

56:24.200 --> 56:29.240
Skyrim remastered. I actually finished the whole Dawnguard stuff, or at least the main quest line

56:29.240 --> 56:36.520
in Dawnguard. And I've been going through now the main quest line in Dragonborn. So I'll be doing

56:36.520 --> 56:47.080
that. And then what else? I've been, uh, mobile wise, I apparently I was watching this, uh, video.

56:47.960 --> 56:53.000
It was from, um, some YouTuber and I'm trying to remember the name of their show. It's something

56:53.000 --> 56:58.200
that, something with skeletons. I don't remember the name of it, but it's a video game show. Um,

56:59.160 --> 57:02.600
but they had mentioned they're all, yeah, at least it's not like that, um,

57:02.600 --> 57:08.920
EDF tapper game that you're playing like EDF tapper game. What? And sure enough, there is

57:08.920 --> 57:13.240
apparently an EDF tapper game that's on the phone. Oh, it's your two favorite things. I was like,

57:13.240 --> 57:20.280
had a baby. Exactly. So of course I had to download it. It's a Tap Wars, um, or at the

57:20.280 --> 57:25.320
Fence Force 4.1 or something like that. And it's, it's pretty stupid. And the way they program it,

57:25.320 --> 57:29.560
of course you got to love Sandlot. Sandlot, they make, their games are glitchy as shit.

57:30.200 --> 57:36.680
And it has not changed one bit. I'm old. It is just, the game is all 2d. It has 2d

57:36.680 --> 57:41.800
sprites and I don't know how they got it to run so terribly, but whatever it's Earth Defense Force.

57:41.800 --> 57:46.120
And it's also super easy to cheat in because they didn't put any checks whatsoever. It's like,

57:47.320 --> 57:51.800
it's like, why am I not even to buy any of your stuff? Because it's just ridiculous. I can just

57:51.800 --> 57:57.640
time warp 36 years back and forth and get tons of money. But I mean, it's, it's still a little time

57:57.720 --> 58:02.440
waster. It's kind of fun. Um, and then what else did I play? I played a little bit of, um,

58:03.720 --> 58:07.880
Ingress. Not too much though. I've been kind of getting burnt out a little bit on that.

58:07.880 --> 58:13.400
And then Pokemon Go, I occasionally opened it up, but I haven't really been playing anything on

58:13.400 --> 58:17.800
that. Um, I'm trying to think if there's anything else I played. I know I tried playing some other,

58:19.160 --> 58:23.800
other PlayStation VR games. Oh, Bound. I tried playing Bound and that game was really weird,

58:23.800 --> 58:29.240
except for their camera in that game is shit because you have to constantly, you have to like

58:29.240 --> 58:34.360
basically babysit the camera. Cause you can kind of rotate the camera around your character,

58:34.360 --> 58:39.560
but it stays fixed in that one spot. So you constantly have to keep refreshing the camera

58:39.560 --> 58:43.880
over and over to get your, the fall of your character and just trying to make jumps and stuff

58:43.880 --> 58:49.800
with that is really frustrating. The game is gorgeous, but it's confusing as hell what the

58:49.880 --> 58:56.280
story is in it. Um, I just, I don't know. It was one of the games that got cheap on one of

58:56.280 --> 59:00.680
the bigger flash sales or something, but in PlayStation VR, it's pretty cool. Um, but like

59:00.680 --> 59:05.320
I said, the camera is just absolutely terrible. I just, I don't know what the hell they were

59:05.320 --> 59:09.160
thinking when they made that. That's it. Were they thinking?

59:11.800 --> 59:15.960
It does not make any sense. It really doesn't. Well, before I talk about my gaming week,

59:15.960 --> 59:20.600
I do need to mention I ate some of that banana chocolate thing. That's amazing. So thank you,

59:20.600 --> 59:27.560
Martin, for sending that to us. I love bananas. So, um, yeah. Yummy. Um, anyway, uh, let's see,

59:27.560 --> 59:31.560
uh, my gaming week. So I need to talk about magfest cause you know, I went to this little,

59:31.560 --> 59:35.720
little gaming convention on the East coast. Uh, that, uh, was the reason why I wasn't here last

59:35.720 --> 59:41.160
week. I had a great time magfest. Um, I didn't, I was a little disappointed in myself because I

59:41.160 --> 59:44.680
didn't force myself to play. You know, we weren't doing the video stuff this year cause Bobby

59:44.680 --> 59:49.640
couldn't make it. Um, and so I didn't really force myself to play enough of the indie stuff.

59:49.640 --> 59:54.600
And every time I was in that area was late at night because that's the best time to do the

59:54.600 --> 59:59.160
arcade stuff is like one or two in the morning. And thankfully, since my body was kind of on

59:59.160 --> 01:00:04.120
West coast time, still, I found myself over in that area at like three in the morning and stuff,

01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:07.640
but like none of the indie people were there and I wouldn't expect them to be. So unfortunately,

01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:11.720
I just kinda, I kinda missed out on a lot of that stuff. So I apologize. I really should have done

01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:16.120
a better job trying to find some little gems in the indie thing, but it was just kind of like,

01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:22.040
I was just going and hanging with my peeps that I went to magfest with, saw a lot of, um, awesome

01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:28.280
bog people and, and listeners and stuff. Like for example, um, SSG100 Matt had, uh, purchased, uh,

01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:33.080
bagels for us from New York. And I thought that was really awesome. Uh, I ran into Rama was there.

01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:37.560
It was his first magfest and I think he had a pretty good time too. And, uh, he had, he,

01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:41.400
he swung by the liquor store and got me some fireballs. So thank you, sir. We did drink.

01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:47.000
All that fireball was, it was amazing. Um, and, uh, yeah, just, it was cool getting to see people.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.840
And, uh, I did a little more of the concerts this year, actually. I probably saw more, uh,

01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:54.600
bands than I did the first year. Uh, they didn't have like the journey live or anything,

01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:58.200
but I still saw some good performances. Uh, I saw the proto men and they were a lot,

01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:02.680
they were a lot of fun there. Uh, they do a lot of powerful stuff on stage. Um,

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:09.400
thought they did a very good job, uh, saw the tail end of bit brigade. Um, when I think they

01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:13.960
debuted it for the first time, DuckTales, uh, they did the whole plate. Cause you know, they,

01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:17.960
they played the soundtrack basically while somebody speed running the game. So of course

01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:23.000
the crowd lost their mind when they started playing the moon. Um, so that was great. So I,

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:28.120
yeah, I had a really good time with the concerts. I even saw a couple of panels. Um, and yeah,

01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:33.640
I really need to make sure that I get to do a panel next year or something so that the people

01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:37.480
who wanted to meet up on Twitter and stuff, we have a date and a time and a place to do that.

01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:41.480
Cause I know I miss some people on Twitter that wanted to say hello. So sorry for that,

01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:44.520
but I will be back. Certainly as long as finances are good and everything,

01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:48.520
I'll be back for magfest next year. Um, so we can try it all again. And then of course,

01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:52.440
mag west, as somebody pointed out in chat has come in this year and uh, certainly I'll be going

01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:57.720
to that. Um, as long as I can juggle that and dragon con that might be pushing it a little bit,

01:01:57.720 --> 01:02:01.560
but, uh, really looking forward to that. So yeah, I had a great time at magfest. Um,

01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:08.280
as far as games go, um, a lot of the same stuff I've been playing like Pokemon go,

01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:12.360
I've been really, really playing more of that. Like I'm actually doing gym battles now because

01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:19.880
I found it's pretty decent XP. Um, so I'm almost level 27. I'll probably hit level 27 tomorrow

01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:23.640
if I go on another walk. Um, and that's been good too, is that Pokemon goes really been

01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:27.960
incentivizing, uh, walking obviously for a catching and just in general catching Pokemon.

01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:33.080
So, um, trying to get more into doing regular walks thanks to Pokemon go. And I think that's

01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:40.120
been a great thing. Um, so yeah, almost level 27 in that. So that's exciting. Um, and then, um,

01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:46.040
I've also been playing a brand new game for me on PlayStation four. And this was a game where I

01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:50.360
really didn't like the demo. And I said, I'm not going to buy this game cause the demo is garbage,

01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:54.440
but then a lot of people on Twitter are like, this game is really good. I love this game. It's

01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:57.400
a lot of fun. And then, you know, I was kind of asking people, so is the demo a good

01:02:57.400 --> 01:03:01.320
representation? Everybody said no. And then I saw the game was on sale and I said, all right,

01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:06.120
what the hell I'm going to play world of final fantasy on PlayStation four was, um,

01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:11.240
the new game I checked out this, uh, past week. And yeah, they're, they're right. The demo was

01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:17.000
not here. We go again, another JRPG, like Nino Cooney with a shitty demo, but the game itself

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:22.040
is, is much better, uh, gives you the better exposition that you need to understand. Why

01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:27.160
do you stack units on your head? Um, and, and explaining a lot of that and, you know, kind of,

01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:31.640
kind of ramping up and I don't understand why these demos are not just like the first hour or

01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:36.120
two of the game, but anyway, um, so if you haven't played world of final fantasy, it's kind of two

01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:41.640
new characters, uh, that get involved where they are. It's kind of like, it's almost mixed with

01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:45.240
kingdom hearts cause they're going through these doors to these different worlds, um,

01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:48.600
that are tied to old file fantasy games. Like in the very beginning of the game,

01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:53.720
you're in Cornelia from final fantasy one, and you actually are working with princess Sarah and

01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:59.880
the warrior of light from that game. And so you, um, yeah, you, you kind of do little dungeons and

01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:05.080
fights. The thing that really surprised me about world of final fantasy is that for a game that

01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:09.720
looks very chibi and cartoony, and it's kind of like a side game, I was like, it's the difficulty

01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:15.320
is kind of tough. Like I actually lost, uh, one of the big battles the first time I lost two of

01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:19.080
the big battles the first time I did them, because you really have to think about like what strategy

01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:23.880
you're going to use in the battle and you can't just go in there and mash a and expect to win.

01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:29.800
Um, so yeah, I, I, I've, I've been enjoying world of final fantasy. I'm not sure I love it,

01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:35.640
uh, because my, my whole like obsessive need to collect everything is kicking in and it's,

01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:39.400
it's kind of a pain in the butt to collect some things. Cause it's not just like Pokemon. You

01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:44.120
can't just throw Poke balls at whatever you want. Like you have to, what's called create a prism

01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:49.720
atunity where you can throw the prism ball or whatever it is at it. And sometimes you can

01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:55.320
create the prism atunity by just attacking it. But like I'm in an area now where you have to do fire

01:04:55.320 --> 01:05:01.080
damage to create the prism atunity. Well, that's great, except the monsters that I've been leveling

01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:08.760
up and using, none of them, no fire. I have ice. I have earth. I have wind. I don't have fire. So

01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:12.680
you have no captain planet yet. No. So I've got to go back now and level something that

01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:16.840
does have fire so I can catch these. So that whole micromanaging stuff is gonna,

01:05:16.840 --> 01:05:23.160
is just gonna annoy the crap out of me. I know it, but, um, I, I like it enough. It's,

01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:27.080
it's a nice little time filler until, uh, you know, things like the switch and mass effect

01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:33.240
Andromeda come out. Uh, let's see, uh, Alan alchemy and chat says world of kawaii,

01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:36.840
weeaboo, desu desu. Yeah. That would be the other thing I would say about the faith,

01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:40.600
the game is that it's the most weeaboo thing I think I've ever played. Like it's just

01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:46.440
like the writing and the tropes is just so light. Like my eyes were rolling so hard. I

01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:51.960
could see my brain. It's like, okay, you ready for an old, uh, OLR reference? You ready?

01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:54.680
It's like somebody let the 23rd Magus write this game.

01:05:57.240 --> 01:05:59.080
You know what I mean by that? Right? Dark Sakura.

01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:05.960
Yes. And I don't even mean him by his new name. I mean the old school 23rd Magus.

01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:15.000
Anyway. Um, let's see, uh, Maya and Chad says world of final fantasy is cute as hell and

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:19.800
got completely swept aside by Pokemon sun and moon. Well, to be fair, Pokemon sun and moon

01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:24.760
is probably the better game at the end of the day, but world of final fantasy, uh, I misjudged it on

01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:29.880
the demo. Um, but I, if you're going to put a demo out there, you have to realize a lot of people are

01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:35.000
going to judge the game based on the demo. So it's no excuse for a crappy demo. Uh, but if you did

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:39.320
play the demo and you didn't like it, uh, maybe check out a live stream or a YouTube, something

01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:42.760
that's going to give you a better sense of the game. Cause I think world of final fantasy probably

01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:49.880
deserves a little better than the, um, demo it got. All right. Uh, housekeeping. I don't have a

01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:54.680
lot to say. We don't have any shows off scheduled cause convention seasons finally died down a

01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:58.520
little bit and we just had a nice big break. So we should be here for the weeks to come.

01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:02.600
So I will just say, follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR. We're also on Facebook,

01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:06.040
facebook.com slash orange launch radio. We're on Google plus as well.

01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:10.200
If there's a social network that you use that we're not on, let me know and we'll get there.

01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:14.680
I guess we don't have Snapchat. That's that's one thing I've been using. I use it personally,

01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:18.200
but I don't, we don't have an OLR thing on Snapchat. Maybe that's, maybe that'll be in

01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:24.120
the future. Who knows? Anyway, let's get to some other gaming news. Yes. Other things happened

01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:31.960
this week that weren't necessarily the switch, right? Loki. Um, yeah, I guess I, I mean,

01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:38.680
it's pretty much just the switches sweep. So, um, then Reggie, when asked, you know,

01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:44.680
cause the switch stuff. So what's going on with, uh, the NES classic edition? Well,

01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:49.400
he says stock is going to be getting better. Uh, they're not going to have shortages on the switch

01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:54.120
like they did with the classic click edition, but they're going to be continuing to get it back in

01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:58.760
stock. Um, which actually I do have to pick up one, which I think we have as another story

01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:06.200
regarding my motivation of why I want to pick up one now, but, uh, yeah. So apparently

01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:14.840
want to see whether that actually ends up changing. I don't know. I have to admit I'm,

01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:18.680
especially now that I'm on board with a switch, I really, I'm going to just totally pass on this

01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:23.880
NES classic. I really don't need one at this point, you know, and I kind of felt that way

01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:26.600
anyway, towards the end of last year, but I was like, well, maybe if I come across one,

01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:32.200
it's funny as I was watching the task bot section of, um, AGQ, uh, you know, awesome

01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:37.080
games done quick. Um, and they were seeing that the switch or the switch to the, uh,

01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:41.960
classic edition is actually a Linux PC that's running, um, some sort of shell and stuff on it.

01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:47.960
And so the way the controls get translated, it actually takes the, um, classic, uh, the

01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:52.920
Wii controls or whatever and converts them into Xbox buttons because that's how it's built into

01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:59.160
the Linux thing, which I thought was funny. It was funny. So pretty cool. Um, well, uh,

01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:05.240
did they say at all, like how they know they're not going to have switched supply problems?

01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:10.760
Cause I'm kind of like, prove it, you know, but then again, I was able to pre-order two

01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:15.960
consoles, so I guess that's already better luck than the NES classic. So here's, there's excuse,

01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:21.000
which makes no goddamn, well, it makes goddamn sense, but it's also a terrible excuse. Um,

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:25.160
so he's basically saying that it makes sense, but I don't like it. It makes sense. But is

01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:28.760
it the fucking line that they give us? And I don't believe it at this point, um, basically said,

01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:34.440
you know, with the classic edition that the global demand, um, was well in excess of anything they

01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:40.360
had anticipated. So they had only expected 30 to 40 year olds to pick up the machine.

01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:49.320
Really? And a lot of other people did, which I say to that, even if he only thought 30,

01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:52.760
the 40 year olds are picking up the system, you still didn't put enough fucking systems

01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:55.960
out there because how many 30 of the 40 year olds do you think are fucking out there?

01:09:57.080 --> 01:10:03.560
I mean, really? It's a bunch of shit. Hello. Look at this show. Come on. This is what they say.

01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:10.520
Every fucking time a system comes out. Oh, we didn't anticipate the people would like the thing.

01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:17.320
Bullshit. Bullshit. Does this mean they are going to over anticipate the demand?

01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:21.560
No, they won't. No, they won't. They will under anticipate it again because they,

01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:27.160
Oh, we didn't know it was going to be so successful. If only we knew how successful

01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:33.560
all of our Nintendo products were. I mean, those pat themselves on the back and pull this shit.

01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:38.200
Whatever. I don't know. Maybe there won't be a huge shortage because there's not any games

01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:44.920
coming out for it. A holiday again. I still holiday. That's still how many months away?

01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:49.080
Yes. It's over 10 months away. Let's see what happens at E3. Anyway.

01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:53.800
Here's a game that won't have any shortage problems because it got canceled. Nobody's

01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:58.280
going to play it. Um, I think, I think, uh, Microsoft can probably thank Nintendo for

01:10:58.280 --> 01:11:03.880
shifting the conversation at the end of the week. So maybe people will forget how much it stings

01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:10.120
that they heard that scale bound was canceled. That's right. Scale bound, uh, platinum games

01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:15.880
developed action RPG that was shown off at E3, um, has been canceled. It's not going to happen.

01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:21.320
Uh, so folks that were really excited to see this title on the Xbox one, uh, were understandably a

01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:26.680
little upset. Uh, anyhow, Microsoft did say, quote, after careful deliberation, Microsoft

01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:31.160
studios has come to the decision to end production for scale bound. We're working hard to deliver an

01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:37.000
amazing lineup of games to our fans this year, including Halo Wars 2, Crackdown 3, State of Decay

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:41.640
2, Sea of Thieves, and other great experiences. Hey, did you hear that? Loki Crackdown 3 is going

01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:46.040
to happen this year. Finally. Yeah, I'm sure it is. I'll believe when I see it. Unfortunately,

01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:50.040
scale bound will not be, and it's not just the fact that they canceled scale bound, but they're,

01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:55.880
Microsoft's actually like yanking trailers and they're actually like pulling scale bounds. I

01:11:55.880 --> 01:12:00.760
mean, all the stuff that was officially out there is getting rid of it. Now, obviously once on the

01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:05.880
internet, always on the internet and a lot of gaming sites are just, you know, are reproducing

01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:09.880
the trailer this week for everybody to, uh, experience disappointment and knowing that

01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:16.200
they're never going to play this game anyway. Um, so there it is. Scale bound got canceled.

01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:20.120
Um, thoughts, Loki, was that something you were interested in scale bound? What about you guys in

01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:26.360
chat? You weren't, you weren't interested in it. No, I thought it looked like some weird devil may

01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:34.680
cry dragon game. I thought it was interesting, but I'm not surprised. Why not? It's a new IP.

01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:40.920
So there's, if it doesn't already have the interest behind it, that making more sequels

01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:45.880
do, what's the point? Well, but it is platinum games who, you know, at least they kind of have

01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:51.240
that record behind them. So, but I don't know. I mean, again, it, you know, whatever rumors or

01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:56.760
things you want to believe, but it sounds like Microsoft's aggressive production schedule and

01:12:56.760 --> 01:13:01.160
tactics may have not meshed well with platinum games and the way they've developed for other

01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:07.080
consoles in the past. Uh, who knows? Uh, let's see, uh, stopping and chat says, wasn't interested

01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:11.480
in scale bound, looked like a poor man, Xena blade, uh, dungeon Buster says, sad news about

01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:16.120
scale bound. It was Kamiya's passion project. Yeah. And you know, as much as I'm like, Oh,

01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:20.360
bummer, because I would have liked to see more like Japanese developed things on X-Box one.

01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:25.560
Cause it's, it's where it's sorely lacking. I also really tried not to buy into the hype too much.

01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:30.520
And you notice this is something I've been learning to do in games is to try not to

01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:36.440
buy into hype of games that are not going to be out for four more years too much because things

01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:41.720
change, uh, things get canceled and so forth. So, you know, and I'm not perfect. I still get

01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:48.200
suckered into hype once in a while, but I tried very hard to not get my hopes too up for scale

01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:52.120
bound based off a trailer or two. I mean, do we ever really see game play from scale bound?

01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:55.240
Yeah, we did. Did we? Yeah. I just don't, I just don't remember it. I mean, there's,

01:13:55.240 --> 01:13:59.640
it's been like, it was the last C3 of the show that I don't remember if that was last year's

01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:04.440
E3 or the year before that, but we did see it. Okay. Well, not that, not that that would

01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:08.600
necessarily match what ends up in the game. I mean, look at No Man's Sky, Final Fantasy 15,

01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:13.960
you know, those, those things change. So, uh, and Bobby Blackwell saying there was co-op

01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:19.000
gameplay at this year's E3. It had four player co-op against a boss. So, all right. It's just

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:24.920
one of those things I just forgot, which I guess happens. So, all right. But scale bound,

01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:28.440
unfortunately, uh, not coming out for those that were looking forward to it.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.560
Uh, Dark Sakura, hopefully this game doesn't get canceled, right?

01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:35.960
Mass Effect Andromeda. A little late now to cancel that.

01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:40.520
Yeah. Well, they do. I will go to Montreal and scream in French.

01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:47.160
Uh, we'd have to go look back up how to scream the insults I'd want,

01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:53.000
but I'm sure I could remember. So, um, the first thing that a lot of people care about,

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:56.360
banging. Banging is supposed to be pretty good.

01:14:58.120 --> 01:15:06.440
Who am I fucking in Mass Effect Andromeda? Everyone, uh, the, uh, the question was, um,

01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:16.680
put in, uh, Twitter is, uh, how, who you could bang. And the reply was so many and the banging

01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:21.160
is pretty good. So they're taking the same approach. I like it.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:27.800
Let's bone some aliens. I would like to, I would like to play a Mass Effect where I can bang more

01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:33.000
than one person too. I'm sure you'll be able to. That would be, that would be fun. Yeah. But here's

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:42.520
what we know about Andromeda so far. It will be quite cinematic, quite cinematic. No shit.

01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:48.840
It takes place between Mass Effect two and three, as we know. New characters. Of course we have new

01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:54.680
leads. Um, and your ending in Mass Effect three doesn't matter because they're not going to be

01:15:54.680 --> 01:16:00.440
there for it. So it doesn't matter if you picked which space magic ending happened, space magic

01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:05.720
happens. Just deal with it. It isn't. I mean, I don't think this is spoilers when this is the

01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:10.920
whole concept of the game, but isn't the whole idea that somewhere between Mass Effect two and

01:16:10.920 --> 01:16:17.560
three humanity, or, or I guess, you know, the, the, uh, alliances out there in the galaxy said,

01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:23.960
what if the Reapers do win this and put a bunch of people on a ship and flung them to the Andromeda

01:16:23.960 --> 01:16:30.680
galaxy, 600 light years away where they could basically continue humanity just in case, um,

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:36.520
the Reapers did wipe everybody out. Yeah. Mission objective, continue humanity, bang as many people

01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:41.480
as you can. It's like the plot of that, uh, Matthew McConaughey movie from a couple of years

01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:47.320
ago. Now that was a spoiler by the way. Sorry. I don't know that movie. It was, it was interesting.

01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:54.920
Bang. Was he, um, perhaps driving in Lincoln in that movie? No, he was, he was hiding in a

01:16:54.920 --> 01:17:00.680
bookshelf the whole time. Come just come to find out he was fucking the bookshelf. Actually kinda.

01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:03.960
Yeah. But again, I don't want to ruin it for people who haven't seen it, but it's been out

01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:07.480
for like, I still haven't seen it, but I was up on spoilers. The name of the movie you're talking.

01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:11.720
I don't, I think the interstellar was that it was interstellar. Yeah. That's it. Was it Matt Damon

01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:16.520
in that one? And did he also need to be rescued? Um, yes. Now I could get really spoilery if you

01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:20.760
want, but some listeners might start getting pissed off. So anyway, multiplayer is coming

01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:27.720
back from Mass Effect Andromeda, but it's going to be more like, um, how it works in Dragon Age

01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:34.360
Inquisition, where you can have your multiplayer characters do missions. Um, and you can, you

01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:40.920
actually do have the ability to do multiplayer, but it's not going to be as intensely the way it

01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:46.440
would affect the campaign like it did in Mass Effect 3. Um, also you have destructible cover

01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:55.480
in the game, so your cover can get shot to pieces and you have to move and banging. Um, you also.

01:17:56.520 --> 01:18:00.200
I was going to say the multiplayer isn't as intense because it's just the banging.

01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:05.640
It's a rhythm game. Yeah. Little did you know though, it is going to be coming out for the,

01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:10.200
uh, Nintendo switch and it's going to focus on the multiplayer mode where you basically

01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:16.680
milk each other with those HD rumble controllers over and over again. I think I saw some YouTube

01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:21.320
or something where somebody was doing that and like playing and the actual switch demo and went

01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:27.000
like, this feels like jacking somebody off. And I was like, we're all thinking it girl.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:32.520
Well, rather than go through all the stuff that we really do already know is the one thing that

01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:40.280
they showed in, um, one of the previews was how the, um, the class system works that you can switch

01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:47.480
your classes on the fly. And that's pretty cool. That's very useful. Do you do a costume change

01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:52.680
when this class switch happens? You turn into Sailor Moon and I hope you do a twirl and that,

01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:58.200
you know, J-pop plays all things happening. And then there will be crafting. Stop being

01:18:58.200 --> 01:19:05.080
in chat says in space, no one can hear you moan. Wouldn't that, wouldn't that actually be in space?

01:19:05.080 --> 01:19:11.480
No one knows you're coming. And this is something about the ending being a very big surprise

01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:16.840
as in not having the paths when they were asked about it. So who knows? Maybe it'll be

01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:21.160
more subtle. And yes, I did ignore the question. They're all pregnant. You have the whole paid

01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:26.600
child support for all of those babies. Surprise. Congratulations. You got everybody pregnant.

01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:36.360
I know they do have krogan's. Anyway, although technically that krogan would be around them

01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:43.320
and not have been present for the genophage cure. Oops. I'm going to, I'm going to say now,

01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:47.720
keep in mind the game isn't out. So we have no idea what the ending actually is. You ready for

01:19:47.720 --> 01:19:52.760
my, um, you know, y'all wanted a twist day. You ready for my twist ending for Mass Effect Andromeda?

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:57.160
Okay. It's going to be like the ending for enterprise. The whole thing was a

01:19:57.160 --> 01:20:00.600
fucking holodeck simulation. That's going to be the ending of the game.

01:20:01.480 --> 01:20:03.560
So when was that coming out again? Was that a March title?

01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:07.560
Yeah. End of March, March 21st. So it's like two or three weeks after the switch.

01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:15.240
So I don't think it's getting canceled now at this point. There will be sex in outer space.

01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:19.240
But with all these like big titles coming out in March and stuff, it's like, who's going to

01:20:19.320 --> 01:20:21.720
pay attention to the switch coming out? I mean,

01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:29.000
Well, I figure I have a good three weeks to beat Zelda and then that's it. My switch will be used

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:32.280
if I'm going to go to somebody else's house for like a party type thing or something. But I

01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:37.880
wouldn't be playing Mass Effect at a place like that anyway. So Mass Mass Effect will be my

01:20:37.880 --> 01:20:43.240
alone time. That'll be, that'll be when it's dark in the house, you know, so I can see the stars

01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:50.680
in outer space. Uh, Tiger call wants to know, will Mass Effect Andromeda have an ED type character?

01:20:51.640 --> 01:20:58.200
I'm sure. Um, let's see. SSU 100 Matt says, Rob, real talk, finish Zelda. You,

01:20:58.200 --> 01:21:02.200
Hey, I'm going to try. I beat, I beat Final Fantasy 15. Okay.

01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:05.240
I beat a game this year. Finally. There's hazelnut cream in here.

01:21:08.360 --> 01:21:11.560
And that's the ending of Mass Effect. I haven't even played Final Fantasy 15,

01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:14.680
aside from that five minutes. And I have had no desire to so far.

01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:19.160
That's the ending of Mass Effect Andromeda. They go to the moon and they find

01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:23.480
it's made of hazelnut cream and then dark soccer is there just licking the surface.

01:21:27.480 --> 01:21:33.400
Uh, anyhow, uh, let's move on Loki. What do you have for us before we get to the classic game of

01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:39.320
the week? Um, some more, you know, comments regarding the whole Oculus versus ZeniMax

01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:44.600
trial that's supposed to be happening. Um, Oculus made a statement, um, because I remember for this,

01:21:44.600 --> 01:21:49.800
it was ZeniMax saying that they had the hard drives or something and something because of

01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:55.160
the hard drives that they had a strong case. Well, now Oculus is saying, bring it bitch.

01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:59.720
And so they basically said, no, where are you going to present our case in court? Oculus and

01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:04.040
founders have invested a wealth of time and money in VR. And we believe that we can, it can

01:22:04.040 --> 01:22:08.280
fundamentally blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. We're disappointed in other companies using

01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:13.080
the wasteful litigation to attempt to take credit for technology. It did not have a vision,

01:22:13.080 --> 01:22:23.400
expertise, or patience to build. So we'll see. I should have had the people's court theme to play

01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:28.680
behind you as you were talking. And ZeniMax is seeking $2 billion in damages, which is equal to

01:22:28.680 --> 01:22:35.320
the amount of money that Facebook got or gave them, which hmm. So these things almost always end in a

01:22:35.320 --> 01:22:38.760
settlement, but not this time. Like this is, this is going to go all the way, going to go all the

01:22:38.760 --> 01:22:44.120
way, all the way. Judge Judy's going to render a verdict on this. Yeah. I mean, they were saying,

01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:48.360
you know, because of the whole hard drive thing, they were saying there's not a line of ZeniMax

01:22:48.360 --> 01:22:53.560
code or any of its technology in any of the Oculus VR products. Indeed ZeniMax had never

01:22:53.560 --> 01:22:59.000
identified any stolen code or technology in any of the Oculus VR products. Although

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:03.640
ZeniMax had full source of the Oculus VR software for over a year and a half,

01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:09.640
having received it indirectly from Oculus VR well before it was even released publicly

01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:17.320
and have, and could have analyzed it online at any time on the Oculus developer website.

01:23:18.040 --> 01:23:22.920
I don't know. It'd be interesting to see how this plays out. William Murderface in chat says,

01:23:22.920 --> 01:23:27.640
maybe Oculus will also be smart and distance themselves from Palmer Lucky. We can hope anyway.

01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:32.120
Just make that guy take the fall. Just say it was all his fault. Well, he's, he's not even involved

01:23:32.120 --> 01:23:36.600
in the company anymore. So I don't, he's, he's kind of disappeared recently. I can't imagine why

01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:43.560
anyway. Uh, all right, let's get to the new story to which Loki earlier referred before we get to

01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:46.680
the classic game of the week. This is a good story to lead into it. You know what we say here at

01:23:46.680 --> 01:23:52.360
Orange Lawn Radio, hackers going to hack and sure enough with the NES classic edition, guess what

01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:58.520
happened? Uh, one Russian hacker opened the system up and put more games on it. In fact, there's a

01:23:58.520 --> 01:24:03.480
screenshot floating around out there with Mass Effect, excuse me, Mass Effect 3 and 4, Mega Man

01:24:03.480 --> 01:24:10.920
3 and 4. What a twist. You were fucking Mega Man the whole time. Uh, Mega Man 3, 4 and 5 and 6,

01:24:10.920 --> 01:24:17.160
and all these Mega Man games are actually installed on this NES mini. It was all posted

01:24:17.160 --> 01:24:22.520
on Reddit in English and talks about how you do it, where you basically connect the PC

01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:28.920
via a USB cable to the NES classic mini, you boot the NES mini into the film mode,

01:24:28.920 --> 01:24:33.880
then you unpack the system kernel, add your ROMs, repack the kernel and flash the system.

01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:39.160
Now doesn't that sound dangerous? That's because it is, and you could fuck up your NES classic

01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:43.000
if you do this wrong. I don't think you would be able to. I think you would imagine you'd be

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:48.200
able to reflash it with, you know, this, the copy of the whole ROM or whatever, but

01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:52.040
a lot of people have done it. I want to do it once I get mine.

01:24:52.680 --> 01:24:56.280
Now, uh, apparently it tops out at 60 games, the UI.

01:24:57.320 --> 01:25:00.520
Baby, I think you could fit more than that though. I think they found a way.

01:25:00.520 --> 01:25:06.040
There is 512 megs of storage, so you can fit, uh, more on there. And apparently modders have

01:25:06.040 --> 01:25:10.840
already added Famicom to support. That was going to be my question is what if you try to put games

01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:15.320
on here that it didn't, they didn't put, because if I remember right, the old NES from what I

01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:20.120
remember way back in the emulation days in college, I used to get more involved with this

01:25:20.120 --> 01:25:24.600
stuff when the Nintendo emulation was first getting out there. Like when Nesticle hit

01:25:24.600 --> 01:25:29.000
and everybody was losing their fucking mind because that thing ran like flawlessly on a 486.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:34.360
So, um, if I remember right, you have all these different mappers that the old Nintendo games are

01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:39.480
on. And to emulate different games, you have to be able to reproduce different mappers, basically.

01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:43.800
A lot of the old Nintendo games run on like the first or third mapper or something like that.

01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:48.920
But there was a total of like, I think like over 200 mappers. Some of them were for very obscure

01:25:48.920 --> 01:25:55.560
types of games, like 64 in one pirate type games. But I remember some games had really weird mappers

01:25:55.560 --> 01:25:59.560
and like, like Castlevania three, I think was one of them where like, if you didn't emulate it

01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:04.840
right, then the vertical level would be all screwed up. Now, granted, uh, Castlevania three

01:26:04.840 --> 01:26:10.120
is one of the games on this thing, right? Well, no, it's one and two, not three. Yeah. So,

01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:17.320
hmm. Anyway, I just, I would be curious if the system is even capable of emulating everything.

01:26:17.320 --> 01:26:20.200
It's a Linux PC. I'm sure they can do something with it.

01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:26.680
Uh, Stoppy in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, don't worry, you can trust the hack,

01:26:26.680 --> 01:26:31.960
since when have Russian hackers done us wrong? That is exactly what I've been thinking.

01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:35.720
Right? The moment you said Russian hacker, I'm like, fuck.

01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:42.680
Anyhow, we can't blame all hackers that are from Russia for stuff like now. Now,

01:26:42.680 --> 01:26:47.720
why did suddenly my NES classic vote in the last election? I don't understand anyway. Oh,

01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:53.080
I can't. It doesn't have any internet built into it because God forbid we'd ever have the

01:26:53.080 --> 01:26:58.440
forethought to purchase stuff. Who knew that Nintendo's forethought of cutting off online

01:26:58.440 --> 01:27:03.240
was going to save us all anyway. Oh, wait, they didn't save us. We're doomed. Anyway. Uh,

01:27:03.880 --> 01:27:08.360
something else to consider is that, uh, when these hackers went in there, well, not when these

01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:14.440
hackers went in there, but, uh, apparently other hackers have found that there was a secret message

01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:20.840
inside the Famicom version of the NES classic edition. Uh, that's right. A Japanese modder

01:27:20.840 --> 01:27:26.040
apparently went into the system and found that there was a cute little, little message hidden

01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:29.480
in the coding when they were, you know, getting in there, trying to inject whatever software they're

01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:33.720
going to put in there. And the message said, this is the Hanafuda captain speaking,

01:27:33.720 --> 01:27:38.760
launching emulation in three, two, one, many efforts, tears, and countless hours have been

01:27:38.760 --> 01:27:43.880
put into this jewel. So please keep this place tidied up and don't break everything. Cheers,

01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:49.080
the Hanafuda captain. Well, you know, that Nintendo started off as a, um, Hanafuda, um,

01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:52.680
manufacturer, which are playing cards in Japan. If you didn't know that, but yeah,

01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:58.520
very interesting. It's a cute message. And also kind of interesting that at least somebody over

01:27:58.520 --> 01:28:02.680
there knew hackers are going to get into this thing. Like the people developing this new,

01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:07.640
they, they had to know as gamers, like, Oh, I'm surprised that no one's extracted the emulator

01:28:07.640 --> 01:28:11.320
out of this thing being that it's based off Linux. You would think that they build extract.

01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:18.200
I mean, you've got a pretty good emulator for Nintendo titles. I mean, I think people would

01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:21.720
want to get ahold of that and they've already kind of exploited a little bit.

01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:27.720
So I think, I think it's really cute that, uh, they, they put this little message in there. So,

01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:31.800
yeah, that's, that's been making rounds on the internet. You know, what else is cute

01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:33.720
is the segment we do here on this show every week,

01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:41.960
starring the very cute dark Sakura or Jamie summers. Oh, you flatter. You'll get me everywhere.

01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:47.160
This is a segment where dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks,

01:28:47.160 --> 01:28:53.000
Hey, you brats should be checking out this game, the classic game of the week. But wait a minute,

01:28:53.080 --> 01:29:00.040
wait a minute. Y'all wanted a twist day. You've decided new year, new you. So we already talked

01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:04.600
about the classic system of the week. You're not doing that this week, but you've decided,

01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:07.400
you know what we're going to do. I want to do, I want to do something different with

01:29:07.400 --> 01:29:12.760
this segment this year into gaming mystery. I see. So now I, now I need the unsolved

01:29:12.760 --> 01:29:17.880
mysteries theme except I don't have a handy, but you could play spooky. All right. I don't know

01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:21.560
if I have that one either. All right. But anyway, so this is a little different. What is different?

01:29:21.560 --> 01:29:29.000
What is the classic game of the week? Polybius and I don't think I've played that game.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:35.320
And no one's played that game. It's an urban legend. Um, but it was worth mentioning

01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:45.400
because it's, it's one of the first gaming related urban legends, one of them. And basically

01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:50.440
the particular, the whole thing about the game is that it was rumored to have induced different

01:29:50.440 --> 01:29:56.200
psychological effects on people like amnesia, night terrors, and even getting people to stop

01:29:56.200 --> 01:30:05.000
playing games at all. So it was Yaris. Yes, it was Yaris. And they said that it was released in 1981

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:11.480
and then a month later disappeared without a trace. No evidence that it ever existed apart

01:30:11.480 --> 01:30:18.120
from just people talking about it. And a few other things. Now the name Polybius comes from

01:30:18.120 --> 01:30:25.320
a Greek historian and the historian himself stated that historians should never report

01:30:25.320 --> 01:30:31.400
what cannot be verified through witness, through witnesses. People have to have seen it. So the

01:30:31.400 --> 01:30:37.400
name itself is its own irony because there are no true witnesses to the game's existence. Did you

01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:41.640
pick this because of that thing going around on Facebook where everybody remembers that Sinbad

01:30:41.640 --> 01:30:47.160
was in this movie that never fucking existed, but people swear up and down they saw Sinbad in a

01:30:47.160 --> 01:30:53.960
movie that actually starred Shaquille O'Neal, right? Which movie? Wasn't it like Shazam? Like

01:30:53.960 --> 01:30:57.880
everybody is convinced that Sinbad had a version of that called like- Did you see that Victoria

01:30:57.880 --> 01:31:01.960
met him and asked him about it? I did, right? He apparently thought it was funny. Well,

01:31:01.960 --> 01:31:06.440
apparently his reaction was he thinks it's funny and in the good old American way that you know

01:31:06.440 --> 01:31:13.720
Sinbad's gonna do, his plan is to profit from it. His plan is to, I don't know, apparently gonna

01:31:13.800 --> 01:31:18.600
make- It's the same thing as people remembering the Berenstain Bears being the Berenstein Bears.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:24.360
Are those the same bears that are in the commercials wiping their assholes selling

01:31:24.360 --> 01:31:27.560
toilet paper? Are those the Berenstein Bears? That's the shitstain bears.

01:31:32.840 --> 01:31:40.840
They voted for Trump too. Stop it. Polybus. Anyway, the first documented reference about it was

01:31:41.800 --> 01:31:49.080
an anonymous entry into coinop.org that was published on August 3rd, 1998. It mentions

01:31:49.080 --> 01:31:57.640
that Polybius had a copyright date of 1981. The author said they had a ROM image of the game

01:31:58.520 --> 01:32:06.040
and have extracted text from it, including a 1981- I'm going to mispronounce this because

01:32:06.040 --> 01:32:16.200
I don't know German very well. Sine Schlosschen, which in the remainder of the information was

01:32:16.200 --> 01:32:22.360
unknown in the about this game section had the rumors that made up the legend of the game.

01:32:23.640 --> 01:32:31.000
And then there was also a notice about it having appeared in Portland, Oregon in 1981.

01:32:31.640 --> 01:32:37.720
And it was so popular that it was addicting with lines forming from it,

01:32:37.720 --> 01:32:43.240
and people fighting over who got to play next. Hey, nobody fights in Portland, first off.

01:32:43.240 --> 01:32:50.920
This is the 80s. They might have fought, you know. Anyway, they also said that the machines

01:32:50.920 --> 01:32:58.360
were visited by men in black that would get data from the machines to test for psychoactive effects.

01:32:59.240 --> 01:33:03.640
And people, you know, like I said, they were saying there was amnesia, insomnia, stress,

01:33:03.640 --> 01:33:09.800
night terrors. And then that one person became an anti-gaming activist. So basically,

01:33:09.800 --> 01:33:16.600
Tipper Gore played it one day. No, that was the songs. Jack What's-As-Fuck played it.

01:33:17.160 --> 01:33:18.120
Jack Voldemort?

01:33:18.120 --> 01:33:31.000
Yeah. Now, the name Sine Schlosschen came from an odd German combination of words, a portmanteau

01:33:31.640 --> 01:33:37.800
that combined sine, which is senses, and lochten, which is to extinguish. So it's

01:33:37.800 --> 01:33:47.800
basically considered a sensory deprivation game. Now, of course, there are the origin of this

01:33:48.280 --> 01:33:57.240
might come from what was described by an author named Brian Dunning, who said that he thinks that

01:33:57.240 --> 01:34:04.520
it happened from players in Portland that fell ill on the same day in 1981 when having a migraine

01:34:04.520 --> 01:34:10.600
after playing Tempest, and another one who played Asteroids for 28 hours in an attempt to break a

01:34:10.600 --> 01:34:21.320
world record. There are also notices from the FBI that they raided video game arcades 10 days

01:34:21.320 --> 01:34:28.280
later, but they were looking for gambling machines. And as we know, there's been an ongoing issue,

01:34:28.280 --> 01:34:35.480
you know, especially in the 70s and 80s, where anti-gambling laws were affecting arcades. Well,

01:34:35.480 --> 01:34:41.880
we just have the deal with pinball now being available in some areas because of all that.

01:34:44.040 --> 01:34:51.400
The other thing, too, is that this myth actually might have been the inspiration for The Last

01:34:51.400 --> 01:35:00.680
Starfighter. Hmm. Because, you know, it has a video game that's meant to test the reflexes

01:35:00.680 --> 01:35:10.840
of somebody to be recruited into the galactic thing. And also, it was said that sine lotion

01:35:10.840 --> 01:35:17.080
was the kind of word that a non-German speaker would create for something if they were using

01:35:17.960 --> 01:35:25.080
an English to German dictionary. I like that. So, Polybius did get some attention from Gang Pro

01:35:25.080 --> 01:35:34.040
back in 2003 that was in an article called Secrets and Lies. Snopes has also debunked it,

01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:43.800
apparently. A few, you know, a few other facilities have tried to debunk it, of course.

01:35:44.440 --> 01:35:51.160
But in the Portland Retro Gaming Expo, October 5th, 2013, there was a...

01:35:51.160 --> 01:35:52.840
Always fucking Portland with this game.

01:35:53.800 --> 01:36:00.280
Yeah. There was a limited run of a Polybius game that was made to use for the Atari 2600.

01:36:00.280 --> 01:36:08.120
Guy named Chris Trimloo made it. He is the owner of Lost Classics. And it's basically all DIY.

01:36:09.240 --> 01:36:13.800
It was based off of descriptions of the game. So, it is a game.

01:36:13.800 --> 01:36:19.080
Now it is a game. I see. Because I was gonna say, do you know how hilarious it's gonna be

01:36:19.160 --> 01:36:23.240
that you made a game that doesn't even exist, the class that gave it the week before Halo?

01:36:23.240 --> 01:36:28.040
But this game does exist now. It does. Well, and I... Technically not 10 years old because

01:36:28.040 --> 01:36:36.920
it was DIY in 2013, thus violating the rules. 2003. Oh, that was 13. Now, for you PlayStation

01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:46.280
VR people, there is... Jeff Minter announced that he's doing Polybius for PlayStation VR.

01:36:46.280 --> 01:36:50.680
And I'm sure that'll be quality. Well, but it's in VR. So, you know, it might...

01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:52.920
So it must be good. It's just a Portland simulator.

01:36:54.760 --> 01:37:00.840
But there have, of course, you know, Polybius has been so ingrained in gaming culture though,

01:37:00.840 --> 01:37:04.920
even, you know, people who didn't know of the rumor, at least recognize the name.

01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:08.040
And not just people who studied Greek history and philosophy.

01:37:09.960 --> 01:37:15.720
There was a mention of it in The Simpsons in the Please Homer Don't Hammer Him episode.

01:37:15.720 --> 01:37:22.600
There was a Polybius cabinet that was in an arcade and it had a single button

01:37:22.600 --> 01:37:30.600
and printed the words property of US government. It's shown up in like a couple issues of Batman.

01:37:30.600 --> 01:37:36.440
It showed up in the House of Mystery. One of Vertigo comics on a T-shirt.

01:37:38.360 --> 01:37:45.000
It was part of the plot for Doomsday Arcade, which is a series by Escapist magazine.

01:37:46.440 --> 01:37:50.440
It's even in Hackslash. Splatterhouse, it's even in Splatterhouse. So...

01:37:52.360 --> 01:37:56.120
I mean, not in Splatterhouse. That issue was inspired by Polybius and Splatterhouse,

01:37:56.120 --> 01:37:59.800
my apologies. And then there's a modern day sequel to Polybius

01:38:02.440 --> 01:38:09.240
that's in a plot of a story called Out of Order that was, again,

01:38:09.880 --> 01:38:12.840
in Portland themed stories called City of Weird.

01:38:12.840 --> 01:38:19.160
So, one last thing. In Farming Simulator 17,

01:38:19.880 --> 01:38:24.440
near Field 1 and 6, there's a broken arcade game that says Polybius is the title.

01:38:26.200 --> 01:38:29.240
There it is. Your classic game of the week.

01:38:29.240 --> 01:38:35.080
You know what that actually stands for, right? That name stands for multiple Starbucks on

01:38:35.080 --> 01:38:38.760
different quarters. There's more than one. That's important.

01:38:38.760 --> 01:38:40.680
Wow. Let's see.

01:38:40.680 --> 01:38:43.480
ActDeftInChat over at live.fognetwork.com says,

01:38:43.480 --> 01:38:49.000
It would have been fantastic that Polybius VR released and it had Frog Fractions 2.

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.960
Sadly, that won't be the case. Yeah, if y'all didn't hear,

01:38:51.960 --> 01:38:57.320
in the past few weeks since we last had a show, Frog Fractions 2 is finally out there

01:38:57.320 --> 01:39:00.280
in the wild. It's real. The jig is up. All that stuff.

01:39:00.280 --> 01:39:05.240
So, it's hidden in a game called, what was it? Glittermitten? Glitter Grove?

01:39:05.240 --> 01:39:08.200
Glittermitten Grove. That's it. On Steam.

01:39:08.440 --> 01:39:13.080
Which is this whole other simulator game, and then you play that and there's tricks you do,

01:39:13.080 --> 01:39:18.040
and Frog Fractions 2 is actually in that game. And do you know what a lot of the early stuff

01:39:18.040 --> 01:39:21.880
in Frog Fractions 2 is directly influenced by, Loki? ZZT.

01:39:22.680 --> 01:39:26.280
Like, a lot of the early stuff are ZZT levels that you play in Frog Fractions 2.

01:39:26.280 --> 01:39:31.800
It's pretty fucking amazing. Well, I posted a link to one of the

01:39:32.360 --> 01:39:41.400
articles about the game. And it's got some of the pictures of the logo and screenshots that

01:39:41.400 --> 01:39:46.040
people have supposedly taken. So, they've gotten a logo from somewhere.

01:39:46.760 --> 01:39:52.440
You know? It just seems to me that I think that this is...

01:39:55.480 --> 01:39:59.000
First of all, if you've ever watched any of that ROM footage that's out,

01:39:59.240 --> 01:40:06.200
it would give me a seizure. But it's just too bizarre that

01:40:06.200 --> 01:40:10.680
it has to be mentioned as a classic game. Because even for a game that didn't exist,

01:40:10.680 --> 01:40:15.960
it's been a big influence. Dark Tetsuya in chat says about

01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:22.360
Frog Fractions 2, the easiest way to get it in Glittermitten Grove is to type apostrophe butts.

01:40:22.920 --> 01:40:27.480
I had no idea that that was the thing. So, all you have to do is type apostrophe butts,

01:40:27.480 --> 01:40:31.720
and that's how you get into Frog Fractions 2. And SSG100Matt says,

01:40:31.720 --> 01:40:35.960
Frog Fractions 2 is out. Now that this is cleared away, Half-Life 3 can come out.

01:40:35.960 --> 01:40:41.000
Well, try typing apostrophe butts in a different Valve game. Try typing apostrophe butts in Dota 2

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:45.960
and see what happens. The new experience. Just flood the chat with butts, butts, butts,

01:40:45.960 --> 01:40:50.520
butts. But don't blame us when you get banned. All right. We're going to take a break. We have

01:40:50.520 --> 01:40:55.320
plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come, though, including... Oh, and Dark Tetsuya says you don't

01:40:55.320 --> 01:40:58.760
need the apostrophe. He was trying to put it in quotes. You just type butts. That's all you have

01:40:58.760 --> 01:41:05.640
to... Just type butts. That should be an unlock code in every game. Can we put that on vognetwork.com

01:41:05.640 --> 01:41:09.480
somehow if you type in butts? You get, like, loot or something.

01:41:09.480 --> 01:41:12.680
You get a fraction of a frog. Bobby's going to hate me for even proposing that. All right.

01:41:13.240 --> 01:41:16.280
Anyway, we're going to take a quick break. When we come back, though, we're going to have some

01:41:16.280 --> 01:41:21.000
rapid-fire news, of course. The mailbag. I know we got some emails this week. We're going to talk

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:26.840
a little bit about TwitchCon. We're going to talk about an old TV show related to video gaming

01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:30.760
coming back, and I'm very jazzed about this. I really hope they don't screw it up. Of course,

01:41:30.760 --> 01:41:36.680
your calls at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype when we come back after this break with more of Orange

01:41:36.680 --> 01:41:48.440
Lounge Radio. We'll be back. Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio Live tonight,

01:41:48.520 --> 01:41:56.200
January the 15th of 2017, with episode number 672 of our program already in progress.

01:41:56.200 --> 01:42:01.160
If you're just joining us live at vognetwork.com, you missed our little lively discussion on the

01:42:01.160 --> 01:42:04.920
Nintendo Switch. I guess you'll just have to check it out on the podcast feed, which, of course,

01:42:04.920 --> 01:42:10.360
you can do via iTunes, Google Play, or pretty much anywhere where you can get podcasts,

01:42:10.360 --> 01:42:14.840
including vognetwork.com where the show is hosted. I want to also make sure at some point I give a

01:42:14.840 --> 01:42:22.520
shout out to our pals, speaking of VOG, over at gamebuoy.org because they had me on their show

01:42:22.520 --> 01:42:28.040
this week. We actually taped it like not even an hour after that Switch presentation was done,

01:42:28.680 --> 01:42:33.000
so it was really cool that they invited me on their program. I was very happy to be there with

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:37.160
my pals, Captain Spike and First Mate Slidekick, and they're always very good about shouting out

01:42:37.160 --> 01:42:41.640
OLR, so I want to make sure they get a nice, big, hearty shout out and check out their latest

01:42:41.640 --> 01:42:46.280
episode, gamebuoy.org, called Switchmas. But if you don't want to hear any more Switch talk,

01:42:46.280 --> 01:42:51.000
I think they have like 120 other episodes you can go back and check out instead on a variety

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:55.080
of topics. They did one recently on Civilization as well because I didn't realize Civilization had

01:42:55.080 --> 01:43:00.280
hit a milestone. I mean, yes, the sixth game release, but it also had a birthday recently,

01:43:00.280 --> 01:43:03.720
so they did a show about that. So, anyhow, check that out.

01:43:05.720 --> 01:43:10.200
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,

01:43:10.200 --> 01:43:15.880
use the passphrase number. Before we get into rapid fire news, I thought I'd bring this up

01:43:15.880 --> 01:43:20.440
real quick. I mean, this is a heck of a question to be springing on you guys. I apologize, but

01:43:20.440 --> 01:43:25.160
hopefully you've given this some thought at some point. But I did get a tweet earlier that had

01:43:25.160 --> 01:43:30.360
mentioned like, hey, are you guys ever going to talk about like the best video games of 2016?

01:43:30.360 --> 01:43:35.480
Since we kind of, you know, skipped the show at New Year's and now here we are halfway into the

01:43:35.480 --> 01:43:40.200
first month of 2017. We kind of skipped that usual time of year when shows would talk about

01:43:40.200 --> 01:43:45.080
this. So, I thought I would just like quickly ask, you know, so we don't neglect it completely.

01:43:45.080 --> 01:43:49.960
Guys, what do you think was your favorite video game last year? What do you think was your

01:43:49.960 --> 01:43:54.360
favorite video game? What do you, I guess, what was the best game? Like, if you had to look back

01:43:54.360 --> 01:43:59.560
and say this game was the best game of 2016, what do you think you'd say? I'll start. It was,

01:43:59.560 --> 01:44:05.400
in my opinion, the best game released in 2016 was Overwatch. I think Overwatch, the best game they

01:44:06.280 --> 01:44:10.520
and I'm not even that big of a fan of first-person shooters, but it's, you know, it's just that great

01:44:10.520 --> 01:44:16.440
blizzard ability to turn a genre that is not always often accessible into something that is

01:44:16.440 --> 01:44:21.400
very easy to get into and to play. I love the diversity of the characters. And I don't even

01:44:21.400 --> 01:44:29.400
mean that from a, you know, like sexual and country and all that stuff. Like, I just mean

01:44:29.400 --> 01:44:34.440
the diversity of how they play. Like you have like, I mean, the first part is great too, but

01:44:34.440 --> 01:44:38.600
I mean, like, you know, you have people that shoot rockets and, you know, every healer heals

01:44:38.600 --> 01:44:44.040
a different way. You don't really have like copies of the same character. So it's just, it's a really

01:44:44.040 --> 01:44:50.040
easy game to get into. And it's true. I don't play as much of it as, you know, my partner and some

01:44:50.040 --> 01:44:54.440
of my friends, but I do own it on two different consoles. I think it's a great game and one of

01:44:54.440 --> 01:44:59.720
the more enjoyable experiences of the year. If I had had time to put a whole list together,

01:44:59.720 --> 01:45:03.480
you know, I was thinking about it towards the end of last year. I almost was going to put Pokemon Go

01:45:03.480 --> 01:45:08.280
on the list. Cause I think, I think that game, you know, as much as people want to hate on its

01:45:08.280 --> 01:45:14.120
drawbacks and yeah, you know, Pokemon Go has its drawbacks. I definitely think Pokemon Go made a

01:45:14.120 --> 01:45:21.160
cultural impact that will look back on 2016 and say, you know, that was like the fad the summer

01:45:21.160 --> 01:45:27.400
of 2016. And, you know, not a lot of video games get to be that. So, and I honestly, I'm still

01:45:27.400 --> 01:45:33.880
enjoying Pokemon Go, although as a game, you can't sit here and say, it's better than Pokemon

01:45:33.880 --> 01:45:39.880
Sun and Moon. Pokemon Sun and Moon is like an amazing handheld Pokemon game for the series.

01:45:39.880 --> 01:45:44.120
So, you know, I think Pokemon Sun and Moon would probably be in my list somewhere, but I think my

01:45:44.120 --> 01:45:49.480
favorite game of 2016 was probably Overwatch. And I think it was the best and like deserving of all

01:45:49.480 --> 01:45:53.480
the game of the year awards that it's getting. Not to put you guys on the spot, but have you

01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:57.400
thought about this at all? Loki, your, your, your best game of 2016. If we were to look back,

01:45:57.960 --> 01:46:03.400
I don't remember what I played in 2016, honestly. I mean, I don't know. I don't even know what came

01:46:03.400 --> 01:46:07.560
out in 2016. It's hard. You have to kind of peek at Wikipedia sometimes to kind of get a reminder.

01:46:07.560 --> 01:46:11.400
Well, there was a lot of good stuff that came out earlier in the year too. Like I think a game

01:46:11.400 --> 01:46:15.880
that's worthy of recognition and in most people's tops five would be like, well, in my top five be

01:46:15.880 --> 01:46:20.840
Stardew Valley. Uh, you know, I think that was a January game, uh, for PC anyway, obviously it

01:46:20.840 --> 01:46:26.760
came to consoles later. Yep. Didn't play it. Yeah, I know. I know. Um, dark soccer, anything

01:46:26.760 --> 01:46:31.800
that jumps out at you as a, as the best checking the date on something. Okay. She's telling me a

01:46:31.800 --> 01:46:40.280
second, but, um, well, what is it anyway, even if it's not 2016 specifically? Um, actually I really

01:46:40.280 --> 01:46:46.440
enjoyed Legion. Okay. The world of Warcraft expansion. Sure. I mean, honestly, I think it's,

01:46:46.440 --> 01:46:49.560
I think it's the best expansion they've ever done. I think I've played it pretty much to the

01:46:49.560 --> 01:46:54.920
exclusion of a lot of other things. So, and I wish somebody would play with me. Hint, hint,

01:46:55.720 --> 01:47:01.240
but I've really enjoyed it. I'm still playing it. I'm still digging the new classes and everything.

01:47:01.240 --> 01:47:05.800
It really feels like a fresh game. So, okay. That's fair. I think a lot of people, I think

01:47:05.800 --> 01:47:10.760
a lot, I think the gals from girls gone, wow, would agree with you. That's probably the best

01:47:10.760 --> 01:47:14.600
game that came out last year. Think of anything low key or should I just move on? I don't know.

01:47:14.680 --> 01:47:20.680
I've been playing Skyrim remastered, I guess. I mean, that's, I mean, pretty much it. I didn't

01:47:20.680 --> 01:47:27.000
really play a whole ton of games last year. Um, I have a ton of games that I bought,

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:31.320
but none of them really stand out as being like really great games. So I can't,

01:47:31.320 --> 01:47:33.960
I would have thought you might've said something related to the PlayStation VR.

01:47:34.680 --> 01:47:39.480
I mean like until dawn Russia bless. Pretty cool. I don't know if it's like my favorite

01:47:39.480 --> 01:47:44.360
game of last year. It's a cool experience, I guess. Um, a lot of people have been putting

01:47:44.360 --> 01:47:49.080
rez in their year end best, which is hilarious. How old that game is. No, I'm sorry. I mean,

01:47:49.080 --> 01:47:53.960
it's all right, but it's not, it's not like game of the year stuff. I don't know. I just didn't

01:47:53.960 --> 01:47:57.960
really have anything. I didn't play really a lot of new games. I have a ton of some of my backlog,

01:47:57.960 --> 01:48:03.400
but I just haven't, nothing I can think of that really like stuck out is like, oh my God,

01:48:03.400 --> 01:48:09.320
this is so amazing. Get on it, Loki. Just kidding. All right. Let's move on and talk about some

01:48:09.880 --> 01:48:13.640
rapid fire news. Uh, actually, actually I should go to chat and see what kind of games people have

01:48:13.640 --> 01:48:18.920
been saying in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com. Um, Maya says, Overwatch may be the best new IP

01:48:18.920 --> 01:48:24.200
in five years. Um, let's see. Sjoan Hunter-Mats says Mighty No. 9 was up there for me. Uh,

01:48:24.200 --> 01:48:30.280
Forza Horizon 3 is up there also. Pokemon Go also. Um, I absolutely think Forza Horizon 3 would be

01:48:30.280 --> 01:48:35.000
in my top three and I haven't even played that much of it, but it's, it's a fucking amazing

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:40.120
racing game. It really is. Uh, an arcade racer, which is a genre I really enjoy. I think Forza

01:48:40.120 --> 01:48:44.120
Horizon 3 is just one of those games. Like I really need to invest more time in. Um,

01:48:44.120 --> 01:48:48.680
but I think it's fucking amazing. So, uh, yeah, I probably, it's very disappointed that I didn't

01:48:48.680 --> 01:48:54.760
see a new side truck game on that, you know, switch announcement thing that would have sold

01:48:54.760 --> 01:49:00.840
it. Unfortunately, act deft of course, shouting out a Kirby planet, Robobot and fifth dream saying

01:49:00.840 --> 01:49:05.080
I'm playing so many fuck tons of Stardew Valley right now. Yeah. A lot of people are, a lot of

01:49:05.080 --> 01:49:12.520
people are. All right. Let's get to some, uh, rapid fire news. Loki. Okay. Um, so much like they did

01:49:12.520 --> 01:49:18.600
with Just Cause 2, Just Cause 3 is getting its multiplayer mod. Um, so that's going to be coming

01:49:18.600 --> 01:49:23.080
out on Steam pretty soon, or at least the PC version. They're saying they're expecting that

01:49:23.080 --> 01:49:28.600
to release sometime in February or March, and it's going to support over a hundred players on

01:49:28.600 --> 01:49:33.080
its servers. And of course it opens the door for lots of craziness, including,

01:49:33.080 --> 01:49:39.480
you know, um, racing, death match, skydiving, they're saying role playing or free roam. Um,

01:49:39.480 --> 01:49:43.800
I just remember Just Cause 2's multiplayer with a thousand people on a server at a time. And that

01:49:43.800 --> 01:49:50.600
was just absolute chaos and a lot of fun to play. So I will have to check this out. I don't know if

01:49:50.600 --> 01:49:55.880
I'm in this laptop cause Just Cause 3 doesn't run very well and I still have this on a PS4. So

01:49:56.440 --> 01:50:00.760
that's one of those games in my backlog that I got to go back and play. That and Watch Dogs 2,

01:50:00.760 --> 01:50:07.800
another one. Um, another thing, uh, that can actually dust off my PlayStation VR for would

01:50:07.800 --> 01:50:13.800
be Dirt Rally. It's going to be adding PlayStation VR support on the PlayStation 4 version. That's

01:50:13.800 --> 01:50:20.520
going to be coming some point soon. So to check it out when that comes out, cause I'm all for

01:50:20.520 --> 01:50:26.120
more, uh, PSVR stuff. They're saying though that here's the thing that's kind of annoying though.

01:50:26.120 --> 01:50:35.320
Um, it's being added as a download only for $12.99. So you have to, um, oh, I guess so. Okay. So the

01:50:35.320 --> 01:50:41.640
PlayStation VR version is $12.99. It's being sold as a standalone for UK, I guess they're adding,

01:50:41.640 --> 01:50:49.480
um, support. Hmm. Hmm. You know, there's a version of a Dirt that just came out for free on the

01:50:49.480 --> 01:50:53.320
Humble store. It was free over the weekend. I think it's done now. Yeah. I think I already

01:50:53.320 --> 01:50:58.120
had that. I saw that and I didn't really bother to pick it up because I'm pretty sure I have it.

01:50:58.120 --> 01:51:02.600
And if I don't, do I really need another game to go into my massive backlog of games that I'm

01:51:02.600 --> 01:51:08.600
probably never going to play? All right. Well, moving on to talk about a place where you're

01:51:08.600 --> 01:51:14.200
probably not playing Pokemon Go and that's China because China is not allowing Pokemon Go, which

01:51:14.200 --> 01:51:18.280
first off, if you're listening to this show in China, um, you should let us know. Cause I, my,

01:51:18.280 --> 01:51:24.520
I'm just, I just assume it's banned. Um, but who knows? Uh, anyhow, uh, Pokemon Go is, uh,

01:51:24.520 --> 01:51:28.840
not out in China and it's probably not coming out anytime soon. The official censorship body in

01:51:28.840 --> 01:51:33.560
China has said it's not going to license any augmented reality game. So that would include

01:51:33.560 --> 01:51:37.800
Ingress or anything else that comes to the table later on, which by the way, very surprised there

01:51:37.800 --> 01:51:42.680
has not been a, you know, a level Pokemon Go competitor released before the holiday.

01:51:42.680 --> 01:51:46.920
It was very surprised about that. But anyway, uh, they want to determine they being the censorship

01:51:46.920 --> 01:51:54.360
body, if they're a danger to personal safety and national security. Um, probably not fans of people

01:51:54.360 --> 01:51:58.760
walking around government landmarks, trying to catch a Pikachu. Not necessarily that South Korea

01:51:58.760 --> 01:52:04.120
also doesn't allow it because they have no virtual mapping a lot of the country, uh, due to relations

01:52:04.120 --> 01:52:08.840
with North Korea. Interesting. Hmm. Uh, I thought, but I thought they had it in South Korea. Nope.

01:52:09.880 --> 01:52:15.800
Only in one tiny town. Okay. Interesting. All right. Uh, so anyway, yeah, uh, that's really

01:52:15.800 --> 01:52:20.280
what it boils down to. They probably do not want you wandering into places that you're not supposed

01:52:20.280 --> 01:52:27.080
to be just to find that must have Pokemon. So anyhow, um, we'll see if that changes at some

01:52:27.080 --> 01:52:30.680
point, but I imagine Niantic would have to hardwire some things into it for that to change.

01:52:31.240 --> 01:52:35.000
Um, even though we mentioned at the top of the show, I had it bookmarked here to mention the

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:40.840
awesome games done quick marathon, uh, raised a lot of money for the prevent cancer foundation

01:52:40.840 --> 01:52:47.320
$2.2 million. And they raised most of that in the last day. That was a pretty impressive

01:52:47.320 --> 01:52:52.200
thing to watch. And I actually did watch, um, a good chunk of the marathon yesterday. I saw,

01:52:52.200 --> 01:52:57.800
uh, quite a bit of, uh, well, I watched the entire undertale. I watched a good chunk of

01:52:57.800 --> 01:53:02.600
super Metroid and saw quite a bit of the Zelda Wind Waker too. So I was, I was watching a lot

01:53:02.600 --> 01:53:07.000
of that on the last day, uh, could have done without some of the commentary during, during

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:11.160
super Metroid. If you all saw that, um, you might know what I'm referring to. I thought that was

01:53:11.160 --> 01:53:17.400
pretty tasteless. And, um, I hope, uh, the AGDQ folks will take into consideration the need to,

01:53:17.400 --> 01:53:22.600
uh, maybe screen people or, or give people some type of little training about what to say when

01:53:22.600 --> 01:53:28.040
they have a mic in front of their face and lots of people, uh, watching for a charitable foundation.

01:53:28.040 --> 01:53:32.200
But that negativity aside, um, I thought the undertale run and I'm not even super into

01:53:32.200 --> 01:53:36.200
undertale, like a lot of people, but I thought that was a lot of fun to watch. Um, and the guy

01:53:36.200 --> 01:53:39.800
that was streaming, it was obviously really into it. And you know, the crowd went wild when they

01:53:39.800 --> 01:53:44.360
passed the 2 million mark. And at the end of the day, that was a really great, uh, amount of money

01:53:44.360 --> 01:53:50.280
that they raised for charity. Uh, and I, I like these gamers doing good type of stories. I think

01:53:50.280 --> 01:53:57.560
this, this, uh, this story that shows that our community can raise all this money for a good

01:53:57.560 --> 01:54:02.440
cause, I think does, uh, the gaming community, a lot of good. So, um, congrats to everybody who

01:54:02.440 --> 01:54:07.720
are involved, who were involved. Um, Dark Sakura, what do you have for us? Some stuff.

01:54:08.760 --> 01:54:14.280
We have, um, some more games getting backwards compatibility on Xbox One. It's, uh, Bad Company

01:54:14.280 --> 01:54:21.320
2, Battlefield 3, and Dragon Age Origins, which, uh, yay, maybe. I'd like to see, uh, how Dragon

01:54:21.320 --> 01:54:29.320
Age Origins ends up looking. Um, you can get them from the marketplace or use the disc. Also, um,

01:54:29.880 --> 01:54:37.560
Final Fantasy 7 Remake and Kingdom Hearts 3, they're still gonna be a while. Um,

01:54:38.440 --> 01:54:41.720
they actually don't have a particular date on them. Just says that they're going to be

01:54:42.360 --> 01:54:48.360
quite a bit longer to, to finish production, according to Nomura. That's it. So maybe not

01:54:48.360 --> 01:54:52.520
going to release in 2017 as we were thinking, especially that Final Fantasy 7 Remake. Probably

01:54:52.520 --> 01:54:56.840
not. Hmm. We'll see. All right. Let's travel around the world and check out what gaming

01:54:56.840 --> 01:55:01.960
releases are coming out this week. Although January is not always the most exciting month.

01:55:01.960 --> 01:55:05.960
Loki, do we have anything? Yeah, it's not a whole ton of stuff coming out, but we've got, um,

01:55:06.520 --> 01:55:13.080
Altair Chalet Plus, the Alchemist of Dust Sea that's coming out on Vita, and Fate,

01:55:13.080 --> 01:55:20.040
Exstella, the Umbral Star on PlayStation 4 and Vita, and then Birthdays, The Beginning

01:55:20.040 --> 01:55:25.720
on PlayStation 4, Valkyria Revolution on PlayStation 4, Vita, and Xbox One,

01:55:26.440 --> 01:55:34.360
and Dragon Quest VIII, Journey of the Cursed King on 3DS, and Gravity Rush 2 on PlayStation 4,

01:55:35.560 --> 01:55:41.480
and let's see, Urban Empire on PC, and then finally about,

01:55:43.080 --> 01:55:49.640
on that Sunday, Dawn Braben Cricket 17 on PC. All right. Well, traveling to Japan, um,

01:55:49.720 --> 01:55:53.240
it's, you know, they've, they've got a few big releases this week in Japan, actually,

01:55:53.240 --> 01:55:58.840
um, starting with Gravity Days 2, which over here would be Gravity Rush 2 releases on the PlayStation

01:55:58.840 --> 01:56:02.520
4 this week in Japan. Um, so I know a lot of people looking forward to that. So that is a

01:56:02.520 --> 01:56:07.880
release this week. Uh, also that Altair game that, uh, uh, Loki was earlier referring to also getting

01:56:07.880 --> 01:56:14.200
its, uh, Japanese release this week. Um, Aoki Kakume no Valkyria comes out this week, uh, on

01:56:14.200 --> 01:56:19.480
the PlayStation 4 in Japan from Sega. So I'm trying to see if that's, oh, yeah, that's,

01:56:19.480 --> 01:56:23.240
that's exactly what it is. Azure Revolution Valkyria. Now, is that related to the Valkyria

01:56:23.240 --> 01:56:28.200
Chronicles games? I'm assuming it has to be. So that would be kind of neat. Uh, but that is out

01:56:28.200 --> 01:56:33.720
in Japan this week. Uh, then Birthdays, The Beginning also out in Japan. Uh, that is all

01:56:33.720 --> 01:56:39.000
again on the PlayStation 4, the PlayStation Vita, also seeing that same Altair game, the Valkyria

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:44.120
game and the Aoki Kakume no Valkyria, uh, excuse me, same game there, just written two different

01:56:44.120 --> 01:56:49.960
ways. Uh, but there's also another game in Japan this week, uh, on the Vita. Hana Oboro Sengoku

01:56:49.960 --> 01:56:56.680
Den Ranky comes out in regular and limited editions this week on the Vita. Quickly taking a

01:56:56.680 --> 01:57:02.760
look to see if anything is hitting the 3DS this week. Um, oh yeah, that, oh no, that's, uh, the

01:57:02.760 --> 01:57:07.880
U.S. Uh, there is just, uh, Pucci and Yoshi's Woolly World. Well, that's still pretty exciting

01:57:07.880 --> 01:57:14.440
on the 3DS this week. And of course, Amiibo! Plentiful to go with that. So, check it out.

01:57:15.560 --> 01:57:23.560
Darth Sakura. For release dates in the UK, just a few. On the 17th, we have She Remembered

01:57:23.560 --> 01:57:30.840
Caterpillars for Mac and PC. On the 18th, Gravity Rush 2 for PlayStation 4. And on the 20th, for

01:57:30.840 --> 01:57:38.520
3DS, Dragon Quest VIII. I'm excited to play Dragon Quest VIII again. I like VIII better than VII,

01:57:38.520 --> 01:57:42.280
even though I do have VII on the 3DS. I'm just really excited to play VIII again. VIII has some

01:57:42.280 --> 01:57:47.640
great characters, great music. Excited. All right, uh, let's do some more news stories.

01:57:47.640 --> 01:57:53.320
We're going to be taking your calls in about 20 minutes or so at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word

01:57:53.320 --> 01:57:57.400
on Skype. Oh, but before we get to stories, sorry, it's that time of the show where we get to the

01:57:57.400 --> 01:58:01.560
mailbag. I always miss it. I always miss it because it's in a different color. You can't

01:58:01.560 --> 01:58:05.720
log into the mail? Nope, it's not working. Like, we're not working how? Internal server error.

01:58:07.480 --> 01:58:11.160
Is it that same problem we were having a couple weeks ago? I don't remember because that was

01:58:11.160 --> 01:58:16.760
happening when I wasn't here. Hold on a minute, because everything still auto-forwards to my

01:58:16.760 --> 01:58:23.640
email, so I can forward these two real quick. Why don't we have Loki do a story and we'll circle

01:58:23.640 --> 01:58:29.800
back to the mailbag in a minute while we work this out in a great live radio fashion. All right,

01:58:29.800 --> 01:58:37.720
so Steam's reached a new milestone of 14 million concurrent users. That's right, so that's the

01:58:37.720 --> 01:58:43.960
first time they've hit that mark in 13 years, and I guess that you're saying that it happened,

01:58:43.960 --> 01:58:55.800
I was about 14,207,039. We're all on the same time. Of course, the highest played games for

01:58:56.600 --> 01:59:03.720
that big period, Dota 2, Counter-Strike Global Offensive, Grand Theft Auto 5, which I really

01:59:03.720 --> 01:59:10.280
need to pick up. Once I get a PC, they can run it better. Ark Survival Evolved, Team Fortress 2,

01:59:10.280 --> 01:59:15.800
still pretty high up there. Garry's Mod, man, I'm surprised that's even up there that far.

01:59:15.800 --> 01:59:26.200
Rocket League, Football Manager, Rust, and Arma 3. Yeah, so that's pretty awesome. And then,

01:59:26.200 --> 01:59:32.920
of course, not sure about any other stats for Steam as far as, I know this year they've,

01:59:32.920 --> 01:59:40.040
what was it, 2016 saw the growth in Steam has been ridiculous. 40% of the games on Steam

01:59:40.600 --> 01:59:47.080
total came in 2016, which is ridiculous. And of course, a lot of those not necessarily being that

01:59:47.080 --> 01:59:53.880
great, but through the whole Steam Greenlight process. And my Steam library is still really

01:59:53.880 --> 02:00:00.760
huge, despite the fact that I haven't played a game on Steam in a very long time. Right?

02:00:01.480 --> 02:00:07.240
Seriously. Yes. I think last I checked, let me take a look here real quick. Last I checked,

02:00:07.240 --> 02:00:14.680
I think I had almost over 500 games, which is ridiculous. Let's see here. It was,

02:00:17.960 --> 02:00:29.160
what do we got here? Too many. 523. Four of which are VR, which I don't have anything for VR.

02:00:29.960 --> 02:00:34.200
Oh, hey, one of the things we forgot to talk about, while we were gone, the other thing

02:00:34.200 --> 02:00:40.200
that was kind of going on with CES, and they had a lot of kind of neat stuff coming out of CES,

02:00:40.200 --> 02:00:45.800
including new VR headsets, which I guess I want to say it was HP that was selling those,

02:00:45.800 --> 02:00:51.160
so there's going to be some more affordable headsets coming out pretty soon. And then,

02:00:51.160 --> 02:00:57.640
did anyone see that really trippy, like some of their prototype laptop displays or something like

02:00:57.640 --> 02:01:02.200
that? I know that they had one that was like a triple monitor setup, which is ridiculous,

02:01:02.200 --> 02:01:06.120
because that thing takes up, I don't even know how that would be practical. I mean,

02:01:06.120 --> 02:01:09.400
I guess you would use that on a desktop or something, but then what's the point of having

02:01:09.400 --> 02:01:14.520
a laptop at that point? But there are some of those laptops, they had one that was like a $9,000

02:01:14.520 --> 02:01:23.000
laptop that was like dual, a dual GPU laptop. They had two full size 1080 Nvidia cards, and

02:01:24.120 --> 02:01:28.760
it only had a disposable income of, or spare $9,000 for something like that.

02:01:28.760 --> 02:01:31.400
And Brad from Pod Culture said it was stolen from the booth.

02:01:31.400 --> 02:01:34.680
Yeah, yeah, the triple display was stolen from the booth, despite the fact that it doesn't really

02:01:34.680 --> 02:01:40.040
work. So imagine that thing wasn't collapsible in any way, so that part of it wasn't working at all.

02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:46.440
So you had to have walked out with this ginormous scream. I mean, how would someone not notice that?

02:01:46.440 --> 02:01:48.840
Just a really fluffy jacket.

02:01:49.960 --> 02:01:53.480
You look like you have bat wings or something like, I'm the Batman.

02:01:55.880 --> 02:01:58.600
Oh, William Ritterface says two of them got stolen. Oh, well.

02:01:58.600 --> 02:01:59.320
Oh, fantastic.

02:01:59.320 --> 02:02:06.600
One under each arm. All right, anyway. All right, so I think we found a workaround for the mailbag,

02:02:06.600 --> 02:02:10.120
right? I forwarded because I still get copied to those on my personal account. So

02:02:11.480 --> 02:02:15.080
hopefully, all right, Dark Soccer is going to dive into the mailbag.

02:02:15.080 --> 02:02:15.720
If I don't die.

02:02:17.560 --> 02:02:22.040
Which you guys can email us, of course, every week. Participate at OrangeLoungeRedo.com.

02:02:22.040 --> 02:02:27.000
And you will notice, come hell or high water, we'll dig those emails out of the oblivion

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:30.520
to share with you on the show via Dark Soccer. Dark Soccer, what's on deck tonight?

02:02:31.320 --> 02:02:35.960
Hello, people. When I do dress up for Halloween, I wear a kigurumi.

02:02:36.680 --> 02:02:43.800
Not only is a kigurumi a supremely easy costume to put on, but also a kigurumi is something that

02:02:43.800 --> 02:02:49.240
I know my nieces will find to be delightful, which is my aim. Sure, some adults think a

02:02:49.240 --> 02:02:54.040
kigurumi looks weird, and I don't care because my nieces find it delightful. Also, adults suck.

02:02:54.840 --> 02:03:00.200
I prefer to wear a red panda kigurumi because it has a tail on the back, which I use to smack

02:03:00.200 --> 02:03:04.440
my nieces in the face. Something they also find to be delightful. Maybe you shouldn't

02:03:04.440 --> 02:03:08.120
hit your nieces in the face, actually. Another one that I'm going to be, the next one I'm

02:03:08.120 --> 02:03:14.040
buying is a red panda. I see. Additionally, after your two and a half hour knot ad for

02:03:14.040 --> 02:03:19.080
Stroopwafel, I decided to go to my local state-run liquor store to buy some.

02:03:19.960 --> 02:03:28.600
Note I said tried. Whether it was due to high demand or purposeful institutionalized incompetence,

02:03:28.600 --> 02:03:33.960
I was unable to find any of the tasty fuck-me-up juice that Sky and Dark Sakura seem to enjoy so much.

02:03:33.960 --> 02:03:38.520
Okay, if you can't find it, you just take a regular waffle and just, you know, run it through

02:03:38.520 --> 02:03:42.680
like a coffee filter. It has nothing to do with actual waffles. Well, then I really don't care

02:03:42.680 --> 02:03:47.000
about it at all. It kind of tastes like a waffle to me, but I think the minute he said state-run

02:03:47.080 --> 02:03:51.560
liquor store, I was like, it wasn't there. We have a place, I don't know how many-

02:03:51.560 --> 02:03:53.160
ABC back in Alabama.

02:03:53.160 --> 02:03:57.240
We have a place called Total Wine that has a lot of imports. It's not just wine,

02:03:57.240 --> 02:04:00.280
they have a lot of import stuff. That's like the only place here where you can get it.

02:04:00.280 --> 02:04:03.080
The one by my house is ordering me for Volona. I'm so happy.

02:04:03.080 --> 02:04:04.600
Oh, really? That's funny.

02:04:05.400 --> 02:04:11.400
Instead, I got some apricot hefeweizen, another kind of tasty fuck-me-up juice that I enjoy so

02:04:11.400 --> 02:04:17.800
much. Staycare, retertainment trainer. The hefeweizen, I've only had one hefeweizen that I

02:04:17.800 --> 02:04:21.080
like, and that's the pyramid hefeweizen.

02:04:21.080 --> 02:04:25.480
I'm still bitter at the fact that my wife got rid of a waffle maker that we had a long time ago.

02:04:25.480 --> 02:04:29.480
She just gave it away. I'm like, why? We could have had waffles.

02:04:29.480 --> 02:04:32.280
You should have asked her for a new one for Christmas. I mean,

02:04:32.280 --> 02:04:34.040
I guess you'll have to wait a year at this point.

02:04:34.040 --> 02:04:35.240
I can just go buy one.

02:04:35.240 --> 02:04:37.240
Yeah, just go buy one. You're an idiot.

02:04:37.240 --> 02:04:39.720
I want a deep fryer as well, but she doesn't want me to have that.

02:04:39.720 --> 02:04:41.000
You used to have a deep fryer.

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:44.600
I did, and it was shit, but they have the nice ones now with the baskets and all the fun stuff.

02:04:44.600 --> 02:04:47.640
Oh, yeah, it'll be fun. Make fries at home. It'll be fun.

02:04:48.600 --> 02:04:49.100
All right.

02:04:50.040 --> 02:04:54.600
Well, it's delicious, and maybe we'll put the brand up somewhere

02:04:54.600 --> 02:04:57.080
in a not-ad for the Stroopwafel Liqueur.

02:04:57.080 --> 02:05:02.280
I'm gonna take a bottle with me to every con I go to from here on out. That'll be the thing.

02:05:02.280 --> 02:05:05.720
Meet Rob Robertson. Drink Stroopwafel, because it's fucking good.

02:05:05.720 --> 02:05:07.640
The official booze of Orange Andrade.

02:05:07.640 --> 02:05:15.240
Hi, Orange Andrade. I've been a big fan since your live 365 days.

02:05:15.240 --> 02:05:17.640
That's a long time ago. Thank you.

02:05:17.640 --> 02:05:20.760
For over 10 years, I've been listening on and off to the three of you,

02:05:20.760 --> 02:05:23.400
Sky Loki and Dark Sakura, to talk about video games,

02:05:23.400 --> 02:05:27.080
the gaming lifestyle, and gaming culture, along with everything else in between.

02:05:27.080 --> 02:05:28.680
I have a question for the three of you.

02:05:30.680 --> 02:05:34.680
One, Sky, how do you manage to juggle multiple podcasts? I have to know.

02:05:34.680 --> 02:05:39.000
Well, it helps when three of them are on break right now.

02:05:41.320 --> 02:05:43.800
I haven't been doing them all regularly.

02:05:43.800 --> 02:05:45.720
But Rob uses a time turner.

02:05:46.920 --> 02:05:51.320
Well, I definitely know there are plans to do a new season of guys on the show.

02:05:51.320 --> 02:05:54.760
And then, of course, once Drag Race is back for season nine,

02:05:54.760 --> 02:05:58.280
which should be in March or April, Reading Is Fundamental will start up again.

02:05:58.280 --> 02:06:03.000
Poke Stop podcast, I'm gonna be honest with you guys, that's in a little bit of a zone right now.

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:04.520
Shane and I have talked about it recently.

02:06:05.480 --> 02:06:09.720
We'll see. It might be a monthly thing or something, but I'll let you know.

02:06:09.720 --> 02:06:11.160
What about guys on the show?

02:06:11.160 --> 02:06:14.200
No, I just said we're definitely going to do another season of guys on the show.

02:06:14.920 --> 02:06:17.800
In fact, I know the first topic is going to be about vacations,

02:06:19.240 --> 02:06:20.600
because we just took a big one.

02:06:21.320 --> 02:06:23.560
So we are going to talk about all that stuff.

02:06:23.560 --> 02:06:25.880
So there will be another season of guys on the show, for sure.

02:06:26.680 --> 02:06:28.840
But as far as the other stuff.

02:06:28.920 --> 02:06:36.120
But anyway, I look at it as like a hobby that you just dedicate certain nights of the week to.

02:06:36.120 --> 02:06:41.240
Like this, we do this every Sunday night, and it's been that way for 15 years.

02:06:41.240 --> 02:06:43.880
Yes, there are sometimes cases where we don't make it,

02:06:43.880 --> 02:06:49.080
but a lot of people in their lives make room for church every Sunday night.

02:06:49.080 --> 02:06:51.640
Not that I'm trying to equate this show to church.

02:06:51.640 --> 02:06:52.680
No, you heathen.

02:06:52.680 --> 02:06:53.480
I'm not going to do that.

02:06:53.560 --> 02:06:58.360
But I'm saying a gathering of people at a time and place

02:06:58.360 --> 02:07:01.400
that you suddenly make a part of your lifestyle.

02:07:01.400 --> 02:07:04.280
That's what it takes to keep doing this show regularly.

02:07:04.280 --> 02:07:07.720
So for some people, it's a bowling league on Tuesday nights,

02:07:07.720 --> 02:07:10.680
or D&D on Saturday afternoons or something.

02:07:10.680 --> 02:07:11.560
You know what I mean?

02:07:11.560 --> 02:07:14.360
That's how I am able to do the podcast,

02:07:14.360 --> 02:07:16.920
is I just have to set a time and say, okay, this is my hobby.

02:07:17.720 --> 02:07:21.160
Also, the fact that I never get out to the movies anymore,

02:07:21.160 --> 02:07:24.600
or watch any TV or stuff, that kind of helps,

02:07:24.600 --> 02:07:28.040
because there's a lot of stuff that I'm just really clueless on

02:07:28.040 --> 02:07:30.600
when it comes to nerd culture, because I don't follow.

02:07:30.600 --> 02:07:33.160
Like Game of Thrones, I've never seen an episode.

02:07:33.160 --> 02:07:34.520
Same thing with Walking Dead, never seen an episode.

02:07:34.520 --> 02:07:35.560
I've watched some on YouTube.

02:07:36.920 --> 02:07:39.160
A lot of those big nerd shows, never seen an episode.

02:07:39.160 --> 02:07:42.520
If it's on Netflix, it's a better chance that I will have seen it at some point.

02:07:43.080 --> 02:07:45.080
I did finally start watching Black Mirror.

02:07:45.080 --> 02:07:45.960
I like that.

02:07:45.960 --> 02:07:46.600
That's pretty good.

02:07:46.600 --> 02:07:47.720
I want to watch Legion.

02:07:48.360 --> 02:07:48.860
Legion.

02:07:49.500 --> 02:07:51.420
The Marvel Universe one.

02:07:51.420 --> 02:07:51.920
Oh, okay.

02:07:52.620 --> 02:07:54.940
I haven't watched Jessica Jones or any...

02:07:54.940 --> 02:07:56.460
I haven't watched any of the Netflix stuff.

02:07:56.460 --> 02:07:58.140
You are coming over and watching all of it.

02:07:58.140 --> 02:07:59.020
Daredevil, none of it.

02:07:59.020 --> 02:07:59.820
Luke Cage, none of it.

02:07:59.820 --> 02:08:00.860
Who cares about Daredevil?

02:08:00.860 --> 02:08:01.660
Lemony Snicket.

02:08:03.020 --> 02:08:03.980
No, I haven't watched it yet.

02:08:03.980 --> 02:08:06.860
I saw the movie years ago, but I hear this is probably much different.

02:08:06.860 --> 02:08:07.420
It's awesome.

02:08:07.420 --> 02:08:08.860
The fact that Neil Patrick Harris is a...

02:08:08.860 --> 02:08:10.940
Neil Patrick Harris is fantastic.

02:08:10.940 --> 02:08:13.740
And plus, not only does it have Neil Patrick Harris,

02:08:13.740 --> 02:08:19.180
it also has Patrick Warburton as Lemony Snicket, which is awesome.

02:08:19.180 --> 02:08:25.020
And then the two parents, Will Arnett as the father and then the mother.

02:08:25.020 --> 02:08:27.980
I don't remember the actress's name, but she was the one that played...

02:08:30.060 --> 02:08:32.380
God, I can fucking see her face, but I can't remember her name.

02:08:33.420 --> 02:08:37.900
She was in How I Met Your Mother.

02:08:37.900 --> 02:08:39.420
She was also in Avengers.

02:08:39.420 --> 02:08:40.300
Alison Hannigan?

02:08:40.300 --> 02:08:41.340
No, How I Met Your Mother.

02:08:41.900 --> 02:08:43.900
Um, the Canadian girl.

02:08:44.700 --> 02:08:45.980
Oh, Robin Sparkles?

02:08:45.980 --> 02:08:46.380
Yes.

02:08:46.380 --> 02:08:46.780
Okay.

02:08:46.780 --> 02:08:47.340
I don't know her.

02:08:47.340 --> 02:08:48.380
I don't know her actual name.

02:08:48.380 --> 02:08:48.940
I just know her.

02:08:48.940 --> 02:08:49.500
So she's...

02:08:49.500 --> 02:08:49.980
I just know her.

02:08:49.980 --> 02:08:50.780
Let's go to the mall.

02:08:50.780 --> 02:08:52.940
Yeah, I just can't remember her name.

02:08:52.940 --> 02:08:54.700
But yeah, she's...

02:08:54.700 --> 02:08:55.660
Cobie Smolders.

02:08:55.660 --> 02:08:56.540
That's what JD says.

02:08:56.540 --> 02:08:57.100
Uh, maybe.

02:08:57.100 --> 02:09:00.780
Yeah, but she's played some other and just the cast is fantastic.

02:09:01.420 --> 02:09:01.980
Good.

02:09:01.980 --> 02:09:03.180
So second question.

02:09:03.180 --> 02:09:06.860
Real quick, I just want to say some folks in chat saying Jessica Jones is real good.

02:09:06.860 --> 02:09:08.780
And I'm sure these shows are good.

02:09:08.780 --> 02:09:10.700
Just because I don't watch them doesn't mean they're not good.

02:09:10.780 --> 02:09:11.580
But I just...

02:09:11.580 --> 02:09:12.220
I don't...

02:09:12.220 --> 02:09:13.100
I don't have time.

02:09:13.980 --> 02:09:18.380
I challenge everyone who's seen Jessica Jones and never read Alias to get off your ass and

02:09:18.380 --> 02:09:19.500
go read Alias first.

02:09:20.620 --> 02:09:20.860
All right.

02:09:20.860 --> 02:09:22.940
But different from the ABC show Alias.

02:09:22.940 --> 02:09:25.580
No, the comic's so good.

02:09:25.580 --> 02:09:26.140
All right.

02:09:26.140 --> 02:09:27.340
Even better than the series.

02:09:28.220 --> 02:09:29.260
Next question from the email.

02:09:29.260 --> 02:09:30.300
Let me finish eating my chocolate.

02:09:31.980 --> 02:09:32.940
Well, now you want me to keep talking.

02:09:32.940 --> 02:09:33.980
Y'all made me wait.

02:09:33.980 --> 02:09:34.940
Now it's time for you to wait.

02:09:35.900 --> 02:09:36.620
Um, two.

02:09:36.620 --> 02:09:41.900
Loki, as a father and someone who games, how do you find time to play games?

02:09:41.900 --> 02:09:42.700
Just curious.

02:09:42.700 --> 02:09:46.860
I have a 10 and a half week old and I'm still learning to establish a schedule.

02:09:46.860 --> 02:09:48.620
Pretty difficult, but it is what it is.

02:09:48.620 --> 02:09:49.260
He doesn't.

02:09:50.060 --> 02:09:51.980
Uh, yes, pretty much.

02:09:51.980 --> 02:09:54.540
No, I have to wait until everybody is asleep.

02:09:54.540 --> 02:09:58.380
And then I stay way too late and wake up way too early.

02:09:59.820 --> 02:10:05.740
Other times I get to play games are when I pacify them with other things.

02:10:06.300 --> 02:10:13.660
So like my oldest son will go play games now in his room with the tablet and he'll go

02:10:13.660 --> 02:10:17.500
watch Minecraft and play Minecraft and won't shut up about Minecraft.

02:10:17.500 --> 02:10:22.940
And then his tablet will, he'll put the tablet away while my other son take a nap and played

02:10:22.940 --> 02:10:27.660
on the Wii U where he watches videos of Minecraft and plays Minecraft and will shut up about

02:10:27.660 --> 02:10:28.300
Minecraft.

02:10:29.420 --> 02:10:32.300
We just bought another Minecraft book last night, so I don't know why I'm encouraging

02:10:32.300 --> 02:10:34.620
this, but did you see they're putting Minecraft on the switch?

02:10:35.420 --> 02:10:37.260
Minecraft's on everything, so it's not a big deal.

02:10:37.260 --> 02:10:40.540
But like, I don't know, he bought, we bought him a book.

02:10:40.540 --> 02:10:42.780
It's like an idea book type thing for Minecraft.

02:10:42.780 --> 02:10:43.900
It's the construction guy.

02:10:43.900 --> 02:10:45.740
They have like four of these essential guys or whatever.

02:10:45.740 --> 02:10:47.260
So he has the essential one already.

02:10:47.260 --> 02:10:51.100
And then he has, now it's the builder's guide, which kind of gives you, it's kind of cool.

02:10:51.100 --> 02:10:53.980
It gives you like ideas for like roller coasters and stuff like that.

02:10:53.980 --> 02:10:55.900
So I mean, I think it's pretty neat.

02:10:55.900 --> 02:11:00.700
Um, and you know, he just talks about like all these mods and stuff in Minecraft.

02:11:00.700 --> 02:11:03.740
And so like, I don't have any idea what the hell he's talking about.

02:11:03.740 --> 02:11:05.420
Yes, I know these, these mods exist.

02:11:05.420 --> 02:11:09.900
He's like, have you heard, have you seen the, you know, seer TNT?

02:11:09.900 --> 02:11:11.500
It's like, it's a mod.

02:11:11.500 --> 02:11:12.860
I just, I don't care.

02:11:12.860 --> 02:11:15.340
I really don't care that you're telling me about all these things.

02:11:15.340 --> 02:11:20.620
I know he wants to share, but he doesn't, like, it's literally just constant vomit of

02:11:20.620 --> 02:11:24.060
information of Minecraft mods that I don't give a shit about.

02:11:24.940 --> 02:11:29.260
But yeah, the fine time, what I've been doing now, like, cause my wife is hogging the TV

02:11:29.260 --> 02:11:33.180
still, like she'll just like watch TV just to watch TV.

02:11:33.180 --> 02:11:34.380
She can run out of shows.

02:11:34.380 --> 02:11:36.060
Like she just got done with House.

02:11:36.060 --> 02:11:38.780
And so we've been watching Lemony Second a couple times.

02:11:38.780 --> 02:11:42.700
She's been watching just because she watched House and there was the woman, the actress

02:11:42.700 --> 02:11:45.100
that plays Cuddy in House has another show.

02:11:45.100 --> 02:11:49.340
The Girlfriend's Guide to Divorce or some shit that she's watching that I'm being

02:11:49.340 --> 02:11:49.900
subjected to.

02:11:49.900 --> 02:11:55.500
So I've been playing on the PlayStation VR, um, using just the 2D screen mode to play

02:11:55.500 --> 02:11:57.980
games since I don't have a screen to play on.

02:11:59.980 --> 02:12:01.340
So that's how I get time.

02:12:01.340 --> 02:12:05.500
And it's usually very distracting because, um, if I'm playing while everybody's awake,

02:12:06.620 --> 02:12:07.820
I get bothered by people.

02:12:07.820 --> 02:12:11.020
Like if I have the VR headset on, my son wakes up from nap.

02:12:11.020 --> 02:12:13.180
He's like going, daddy, what are you doing?

02:12:13.180 --> 02:12:14.140
Daddy, what are you doing?

02:12:14.140 --> 02:12:15.100
What are you doing, daddy?

02:12:15.100 --> 02:12:15.900
What are you doing, daddy?

02:12:15.900 --> 02:12:17.100
It's like fucking.

02:12:17.100 --> 02:12:19.820
And then the cat like tries to get up in there too.

02:12:19.820 --> 02:12:22.300
It's like, get the fuck off me, you stupid cat.

02:12:22.300 --> 02:12:23.660
I'm trying to like play this game.

02:12:23.660 --> 02:12:25.020
She's like in front of my face.

02:12:25.020 --> 02:12:26.860
I'm like, I will say this right now.

02:12:26.860 --> 02:12:28.780
All of that is why I don't have kids.

02:12:28.780 --> 02:12:31.980
Nope, but I have a cat.

02:12:31.980 --> 02:12:32.620
Aren't they precious?

02:12:32.620 --> 02:12:34.300
I have a cat and she fucks off.

02:12:34.300 --> 02:12:34.620
Fine.

02:12:34.620 --> 02:12:35.420
The kids are fine.

02:12:35.420 --> 02:12:39.740
If I put a TV show on for my one kid and give the tablet to the other kid, they don't bother

02:12:39.740 --> 02:12:40.060
me.

02:12:40.060 --> 02:12:40.940
All right.

02:12:40.940 --> 02:12:42.140
That was that.

02:12:42.140 --> 02:12:44.860
That was me, but it was a Commodore 64.

02:12:44.860 --> 02:12:45.980
And look, look at me now.

02:12:46.700 --> 02:12:48.540
Your kids might turn out like me someday.

02:12:49.420 --> 02:12:49.900
Exactly.

02:12:49.900 --> 02:12:52.940
I'd be fine with it, but he doesn't want to try like Mario or any of the hard games.

02:12:52.940 --> 02:12:54.940
He isn't like anything is challenging.

02:12:54.940 --> 02:12:56.140
I'm not doing it.

02:12:56.140 --> 02:12:57.020
Sounds American.

02:12:57.020 --> 02:12:57.340
All right.

02:12:57.420 --> 02:12:59.340
Anyway, next part of the email.

02:12:59.340 --> 02:13:00.140
The ones for me.

02:13:00.780 --> 02:13:02.300
Oh, dark Sakura.

02:13:02.300 --> 02:13:05.020
What's your criteria to meet the classic game of the week?

02:13:05.020 --> 02:13:07.980
My two personal recommendations would be lightning force.

02:13:07.980 --> 02:13:10.460
It's spelled like this for the US market, which I know.

02:13:11.260 --> 02:13:13.260
And Onimusha two or three.

02:13:13.260 --> 02:13:16.540
Forgive my grammar and the sentence as I know I'll get eviscerated.

02:13:16.540 --> 02:13:17.740
Your grammar was actually decent.

02:13:18.300 --> 02:13:19.180
Criteria one.

02:13:19.180 --> 02:13:19.980
It's not Halo.

02:13:21.020 --> 02:13:21.500
True.

02:13:21.500 --> 02:13:22.620
Criteria one.

02:13:22.620 --> 02:13:23.500
It's not Halo.

02:13:23.900 --> 02:13:27.420
Criteria two, 10 years or older.

02:13:28.940 --> 02:13:33.820
And preferably not something that's utter shit unless it's so much utter shit.

02:13:33.820 --> 02:13:34.300
Oh my God.

02:13:34.940 --> 02:13:35.980
Criteria three.

02:13:35.980 --> 02:13:38.940
Something you randomly thought about on Sunday morning before the show.

02:13:39.820 --> 02:13:40.220
I do.

02:13:40.220 --> 02:13:41.260
I'm on Saturday night.

02:13:43.180 --> 02:13:43.900
Have you done?

02:13:43.900 --> 02:13:45.740
Well, actually, because I can't remember.

02:13:45.740 --> 02:13:48.140
Have you done Derby owners club as a classic game of the week?

02:13:48.140 --> 02:13:49.180
I think I have.

02:13:49.180 --> 02:13:51.020
I don't think you have, because I think I have.

02:13:51.020 --> 02:13:52.940
I think that game only recently, right?

02:13:52.940 --> 02:13:55.180
That game only recently turned like final three long.

02:13:56.300 --> 02:13:57.260
What, Horsey Humping?

02:13:57.900 --> 02:13:58.400
Yeah.

02:13:59.020 --> 02:14:04.140
But we've talked about Derby owners club a lot because of you made Politary.

02:14:04.780 --> 02:14:09.420
And don't forget this year, I think next week will be the first classic system of the week.

02:14:09.420 --> 02:14:15.660
So, you know, now that you asked about the formula, we have to shake up the formula this

02:14:15.660 --> 02:14:15.980
year.

02:14:15.980 --> 02:14:18.140
She just did a game that didn't even exist.

02:14:18.140 --> 02:14:20.780
Got to keep you all on your toes somehow in year 15.

02:14:21.260 --> 02:14:24.860
So she can do Half-Life 3 as a classic game of the week?

02:14:24.860 --> 02:14:26.380
No, because it's not older than 10 years.

02:14:28.300 --> 02:14:30.540
At least the Polybust thing goes back to 1981.

02:14:30.540 --> 02:14:31.740
So there is that.

02:14:31.740 --> 02:14:32.940
Although it's coming up.

02:14:32.940 --> 02:14:34.700
How far back does the Half-Life 3 thing go?

02:14:34.700 --> 02:14:36.220
It's almost 10 years.

02:14:37.500 --> 02:14:39.100
Anyway, anything else on that email?

02:14:39.660 --> 02:14:42.620
Yes, but we've already answered that one.

02:14:42.620 --> 02:14:45.900
Finally, I have to know your overall thoughts on the Nintendo Switch.

02:14:45.900 --> 02:14:47.260
Are you sold on it yet?

02:14:47.260 --> 02:14:49.740
Will you three hold off until more games are announced?

02:14:49.740 --> 02:14:51.740
The answer, by the way, is yes to all of it.

02:14:53.100 --> 02:14:54.540
Just spread amongst us.

02:14:54.540 --> 02:14:55.420
Thanks so much.

02:14:55.420 --> 02:14:56.940
I'm taking the time to read my email.

02:14:56.940 --> 02:14:59.340
Skye, I'm sorry I missed you at MagFest last Saturday.

02:14:59.900 --> 02:15:04.220
I wish I could have talked to you more in person to pick your brain about gaming and

02:15:04.220 --> 02:15:05.260
just life in general.

02:15:05.900 --> 02:15:06.780
Take care, guys.

02:15:06.780 --> 02:15:08.060
Keep up the awesome work.

02:15:08.060 --> 02:15:09.100
Tristan, AKA...

02:15:10.380 --> 02:15:16.300
I will fight my way onto a panel next year so I at least can say go to xballroom at ytime

02:15:16.300 --> 02:15:17.340
and say hi.

02:15:17.660 --> 02:15:20.460
AKA DCB Needle Crash.

02:15:22.140 --> 02:15:23.420
Oh, they were in chat earlier.

02:15:23.420 --> 02:15:23.980
So, all right.

02:15:23.980 --> 02:15:24.620
Cool.

02:15:24.620 --> 02:15:24.940
Thanks.

02:15:24.940 --> 02:15:26.540
Thanks for being a long time listener.

02:15:26.540 --> 02:15:29.340
A last email is...

02:15:29.340 --> 02:15:30.540
Oh, the crap.

02:15:31.420 --> 02:15:38.380
People don't message me during the show and I'm like, don't message me during the show.

02:15:39.820 --> 02:15:40.380
That's what I do.

02:15:40.380 --> 02:15:41.660
I'm not even seeing who it is.

02:15:41.660 --> 02:15:42.460
So hold on.

02:15:42.460 --> 02:15:43.100
Okay.

02:15:43.100 --> 02:15:45.260
I'll look at it during a break or something.

02:15:45.260 --> 02:15:51.340
But, you know, if I take 40 minutes to respond, you realize a little notification on my bottom

02:15:51.340 --> 02:15:54.060
and then I have to go and change it to get the notification to stop.

02:15:54.060 --> 02:15:54.860
And it's annoying.

02:15:54.860 --> 02:15:56.060
Oh, I just ignore.

02:15:56.060 --> 02:15:57.980
I just let it blink until I'm damn good.

02:15:57.980 --> 02:15:59.180
Well, it annoys me.

02:15:59.180 --> 02:15:59.660
Okay.

02:15:59.660 --> 02:16:02.300
I can't let it sit and blink at me.

02:16:02.300 --> 02:16:03.500
It's got to get checked.

02:16:04.860 --> 02:16:05.740
Shit's got to get checked.

02:16:05.740 --> 02:16:08.540
If I were to look at your phone right now, how many unread mails do you have?

02:16:10.220 --> 02:16:11.500
That's you.

02:16:12.060 --> 02:16:12.700
And you know what?

02:16:12.700 --> 02:16:15.260
My work email, my inbox is always empty.

02:16:15.980 --> 02:16:18.060
I have 13 unread emails right now.

02:16:18.060 --> 02:16:18.560
Girl.

02:16:19.260 --> 02:16:19.580
All right.

02:16:19.580 --> 02:16:22.380
Here's an interesting article that can make the show roll.

02:16:22.380 --> 02:16:22.880
Oh.

02:16:23.900 --> 02:16:30.220
Published in PLOS Computational Biology, researchers applied widely used neuroscience

02:16:30.220 --> 02:16:36.780
approaches to analyze the classic games console Atari 2600, which runs the video game Donkey Kong

02:16:36.780 --> 02:16:42.060
and found that such approaches do not meaningfully describe how the console's microprocessor really

02:16:42.060 --> 02:16:42.560
works.

02:16:43.260 --> 02:16:44.540
And then the comment, it's funny.

02:16:44.540 --> 02:16:45.980
They chose Donkey Kong too.

02:16:45.980 --> 02:16:51.340
So it's okay.

02:16:51.340 --> 02:16:58.060
It's using a classic game system to improve the to improve the understanding of the brain.

02:16:59.100 --> 02:17:00.940
Okay, cool.

02:17:00.940 --> 02:17:05.500
So like, like the way that our brain responds to situations in certain games.

02:17:06.380 --> 02:17:06.940
Interesting.

02:17:06.940 --> 02:17:07.500
Hold on.

02:17:07.500 --> 02:17:10.300
Um, I'm trying to find the more information about it.

02:17:10.300 --> 02:17:10.940
Give me a second.

02:17:12.380 --> 02:17:14.940
Since humans designed this, this is a quote from here.

02:17:15.660 --> 02:17:20.540
Since humans designed this processor from the transistor all the way up to the software,

02:17:20.540 --> 02:17:22.780
we know how it works at every level.

02:17:22.780 --> 02:17:27.100
And we have an intuition for what it means to understand the system.

02:17:27.100 --> 02:17:30.940
Our goal was to highlight some of the deficiencies in understanding

02:17:30.940 --> 02:17:36.220
that arise when applying contemporary and analytic techniques to big data, data sets

02:17:36.220 --> 02:17:37.580
of computing systems.

02:17:37.580 --> 02:17:40.940
So something like, uh, let's see deficiencies.

02:17:41.340 --> 02:17:43.980
You need more than six weeks to make an E.T. game.

02:17:43.980 --> 02:17:54.040
That would have been one deficiency of the Atari

02:17:54.040 --> 02:17:55.040
You need more than four kilobytes to make an arcade perfect translation of Pac-Man.

02:17:55.040 --> 02:17:56.040
That would be one deficiency, right?

02:17:56.040 --> 02:17:57.980
Oh, I don't know if it quite means that, but, um, but their final thing is with careful

02:17:57.980 --> 02:18:02.700
thought, uh, current big data approaches to neuroscience may not live up to their promise

02:18:02.700 --> 02:18:04.540
or succeed in advancing the field.

02:18:05.180 --> 02:18:08.540
Progress requires better experiments, theories, and data analysis approaches.

02:18:08.540 --> 02:18:12.140
So basically computers versus brains.

02:18:13.180 --> 02:18:13.980
Brains win.

02:18:13.980 --> 02:18:17.820
Brains are still an completely comprehensible.

02:18:17.820 --> 02:18:22.700
So, uh, fifth dream in chat, if you thought 13 was a lot of unread emails, fifth dream

02:18:22.700 --> 02:18:26.140
in chat says I have over 500,000 unread emails.

02:18:26.140 --> 02:18:27.420
I don't, I want to see the receipts.

02:18:27.420 --> 02:18:30.860
Where's the screenshot kind of 500,000.

02:18:30.860 --> 02:18:34.780
Um, actually maybe in my Yahoo account, I have that many unread emails, but that's kind

02:18:34.780 --> 02:18:36.940
of like my spam dump ground.

02:18:36.940 --> 02:18:41.740
And as I understand it, foreign countries have probably read all those emails by now.

02:18:41.740 --> 02:18:47.580
Anyway, I recently cleaned out my Yahoo account because that's where my, um, some of my Amazon

02:18:47.580 --> 02:18:51.980
notifications just go, which by the way, Amazon, you didn't fucking notify me when the switch

02:18:51.980 --> 02:18:56.460
went available, despite the fact that I've marked that specifically it did twice on that

02:18:56.460 --> 02:18:59.180
it went for sale twice in neither time.

02:18:59.180 --> 02:19:02.060
So what's the point of having a button to notify you if they're never going to notify

02:19:02.060 --> 02:19:03.500
you, you kind of missed the point there.

02:19:05.180 --> 02:19:05.740
All right.

02:19:05.980 --> 02:19:08.860
If you want to email us in a future week, that was the last one, right?

02:19:08.860 --> 02:19:09.100
Yes.

02:19:09.100 --> 02:19:11.980
Participate at orange lounge radio.com.

02:19:11.980 --> 02:19:16.300
If you want to email us in a future week, uh, in the meantime, let's get back to some

02:19:16.300 --> 02:19:17.020
gaming news.

02:19:17.020 --> 02:19:22.220
And I think I have the next story here that talks about windows 10 and a new game mode

02:19:22.220 --> 02:19:24.220
that is going to be coming out very soon for windows 10.

02:19:24.220 --> 02:19:26.540
In fact, I believe it's coming out in this next week.

02:19:26.540 --> 02:19:32.700
Uh, yes, the insider preview program will be seeing windows 10 game mode this week.

02:19:32.700 --> 02:19:36.940
Now you're not going to see this fully functional until a later release of windows 10, but this

02:19:36.940 --> 02:19:43.100
is supposed to help tune your PC to speed up gaming performance for both legacy windows

02:19:43.100 --> 02:19:45.180
games and modern titles.

02:19:45.980 --> 02:19:50.220
I believe this was something about how, um, it's supposed to dedicate more of the processing

02:19:50.220 --> 02:19:51.820
basically to gaming.

02:19:51.820 --> 02:19:55.900
And so it's like more of your system is dedicated to the gaming, sort of like you would see

02:19:55.900 --> 02:19:57.180
in a console environment.

02:19:57.180 --> 02:20:00.300
So in a little less on the multitasking abilities.

02:20:00.780 --> 02:20:07.020
Um, anyway, that's one update of several things to come in 2017, uh, live streaming through

02:20:07.020 --> 02:20:10.780
beam is supposed to be something that's going to be a big centerpiece on the platforms,

02:20:10.780 --> 02:20:12.860
uh, moving into 2017.

02:20:12.860 --> 02:20:15.820
Uh, so it'd be interesting to see how that competition with Twitch works, by the way,

02:20:15.820 --> 02:20:17.340
I started a beam channel.

02:20:17.340 --> 02:20:21.660
Um, and you know, for the most part, it's been just very similar to broadcasting on

02:20:21.660 --> 02:20:26.380
Twitch, except, you know, there's less people on beam right now, but I do, I still really

02:20:26.380 --> 02:20:31.020
like the whole interactive approach where, you know, people are earning currency as they

02:20:31.020 --> 02:20:35.260
watch your stream and then they can dump sound clips on your stream or depending on the game

02:20:35.260 --> 02:20:37.100
you're playing, they can actually influence the game.

02:20:37.100 --> 02:20:39.980
I kind of like that next level where beam's going.

02:20:39.980 --> 02:20:43.580
I got to say, you know, no matter how you might feel about Microsoft.

02:20:43.580 --> 02:20:48.140
Uh, anyhow, also some other things happening on Xbox one, you're going to see an always

02:20:48.140 --> 02:20:52.220
available guide with faster access to game recording and music controls and achievement

02:20:52.220 --> 02:20:56.140
tracking overlay, a new look for Cortana and a gamer score leader board.

02:20:56.140 --> 02:21:00.620
So lots of stuff to look forward to in the coming year on the Microsoft platforms.

02:21:01.740 --> 02:21:06.140
Uh, let's see, William murder face and chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, while I

02:21:06.140 --> 02:21:11.020
am intrigued, Microsoft has so far failed to impress me with their previous attempts

02:21:11.020 --> 02:21:12.300
at helping PC gamers.

02:21:12.860 --> 02:21:13.180
We'll see.

02:21:13.180 --> 02:21:14.060
I'm intrigued too.

02:21:14.060 --> 02:21:18.540
And we'll see what develops with this game mode and you know, what games actually utilize

02:21:18.540 --> 02:21:19.100
it.

02:21:19.100 --> 02:21:20.780
Uh, moving on dark Sakura.

02:21:22.300 --> 02:21:24.540
Twitch Con is moving.

02:21:25.180 --> 02:21:31.020
It's going to be in late October and they're moving to, uh, long beach.

02:21:31.820 --> 02:21:35.660
Um, if I am right, I think, yeah, this is the long beach convention center.

02:21:36.220 --> 02:21:37.740
Um, that I think is the same one.

02:21:37.740 --> 02:21:39.580
The AX is at anime expo.

02:21:40.140 --> 02:21:43.260
Um, cause it's gotten huge apparently.

02:21:43.260 --> 02:21:44.620
So enjoy it.

02:21:44.620 --> 02:21:45.420
If you want to go there.

02:21:47.340 --> 02:21:49.660
Boy, everybody's just shitting on San Diego this week.

02:21:49.660 --> 02:21:53.580
This is the second thing to move to LA area from San Diego.

02:21:53.580 --> 02:21:56.460
No, actually Twitch Con the first year was in San Francisco.

02:21:56.460 --> 02:21:57.340
Yes, it was.

02:21:57.340 --> 02:22:00.300
I went for a day and it was, it was interesting.

02:22:00.300 --> 02:22:01.900
I'd be down to go into Twitch Con again.

02:22:01.900 --> 02:22:07.260
It's just the end of the year is so many conventions, but this year there won't be the final fantasy

02:22:07.260 --> 02:22:07.580
thing.

02:22:07.580 --> 02:22:08.780
So yeah, who knows?

02:22:08.780 --> 02:22:09.420
Who knows?

02:22:09.420 --> 02:22:13.260
And, uh, I, they haven't said if there's going to be a gamer X this year.

02:22:13.260 --> 02:22:14.620
I don't know where that stands.

02:22:15.180 --> 02:22:20.540
Um, and this past year in 2016 gamer X and Twitch Con with the same weekend, which meant

02:22:20.540 --> 02:22:21.420
I couldn't do both.

02:22:21.420 --> 02:22:24.540
So, uh, we'll see how the calendar works out this year.

02:22:24.540 --> 02:22:25.980
So, all right.

02:22:26.700 --> 02:22:31.020
Uh, moving on, uh, Loki, just a couple more stories that we're going to get to the skype

02:22:31.020 --> 02:22:32.540
line at orange lounge radio.

02:22:33.180 --> 02:22:33.900
Okay.

02:22:33.900 --> 02:22:39.260
So apparently someone saw that there was this, um, post on Craigslist.

02:22:39.900 --> 02:22:47.020
It's a, for a casting call for a show from the makers of catfish, the TV series called

02:22:47.020 --> 02:22:48.540
beyond the keyboard.

02:22:48.540 --> 02:22:55.740
They're looking for, um, people who like to troll fake gamer girls or who are sick of

02:22:55.740 --> 02:23:02.220
fake gamer girls and booby streamers, and also who, uh, want to come, uh, confront phony

02:23:02.220 --> 02:23:06.540
gamers face to face and show them what geek culture is really about.

02:23:06.540 --> 02:23:10.540
And also not limited to, you know, other such topics, which you fiercely disagree with,

02:23:10.540 --> 02:23:15.900
including feminism, gaming, vegans, conspiracy theories, rival sports teams, Syrian refugees,

02:23:15.900 --> 02:23:20.620
immigration, black lives matter, LGBT slash trans issues, et cetera.

02:23:20.620 --> 02:23:26.700
My God is this not a fucking completely obvious troll the troll show.

02:23:26.700 --> 02:23:31.900
That's going to be happening where it's dumpster fire television where it's basically,

02:23:31.900 --> 02:23:36.380
Oh, Hey, you thought you were on a show that was going to be making fun of these people,

02:23:36.380 --> 02:23:40.540
but really they're confronting the trolls and we're going to teach you a lesson.

02:23:41.420 --> 02:23:43.100
Like see them all exposed.

02:23:43.100 --> 02:23:45.260
Didn't, didn't they have a show like that already?

02:23:45.260 --> 02:23:49.260
Didn't they have a thing where like, uh, the people that they talk shit about online

02:23:49.260 --> 02:23:50.540
would then like meet them.

02:23:50.540 --> 02:23:55.500
It was called like, it was on, it was on the CW, which should say enough right there.

02:23:55.500 --> 02:23:56.460
It was called a hater.

02:23:56.460 --> 02:24:02.220
It was H eight E R and it was people that would like, uh, say things like, I fucking

02:24:02.220 --> 02:24:03.740
hate Snooki and she sucks.

02:24:03.740 --> 02:24:04.460
And did all this stuff.

02:24:04.460 --> 02:24:06.460
Cause like, this is the level of celebrity of the show.

02:24:06.460 --> 02:24:08.140
Like that gets is like Snooki and shit.

02:24:08.140 --> 02:24:08.700
Right.

02:24:08.700 --> 02:24:11.420
So the same people that star on celebrity apprentice.

02:24:11.420 --> 02:24:17.580
So then, um, uh, Snooki will like confront the person and be like, how could you say

02:24:17.580 --> 02:24:18.220
that shit about me?

02:24:18.780 --> 02:24:21.260
You know, and this is, it's dumpster fire TV.

02:24:21.260 --> 02:24:23.260
Like there's just, there's no other, it's dumpster.

02:24:23.260 --> 02:24:26.380
It's a floating in the ocean dumpster fire.

02:24:26.380 --> 02:24:29.660
Give these human pieces of shit in the attention.

02:24:29.660 --> 02:24:30.780
It's not for them.

02:24:30.780 --> 02:24:31.500
It's the come up.

02:24:31.500 --> 02:24:32.300
It's the come up.

02:24:32.300 --> 02:24:33.020
That's what it is.

02:24:33.580 --> 02:24:37.900
And it's not even like, they're not even getting paid for it, which is kind of seriously funny,

02:24:37.900 --> 02:24:42.860
but I mean, anybody that actually is dumb enough to believe that this is what this actually

02:24:42.860 --> 02:24:45.260
is, that you're going on a show to make fun of people.

02:24:45.260 --> 02:24:46.700
You are a fucking retard.

02:24:46.700 --> 02:24:51.820
I mean, it's just, maybe you should go, maybe you should go on the show.

02:24:52.380 --> 02:24:52.940
You know what?

02:24:52.940 --> 02:24:54.780
I can go on any show whatsoever.

02:24:54.780 --> 02:24:57.980
If you're going to have me confront people that I'm calling names to, I will call the

02:24:57.980 --> 02:24:58.780
names to their face.

02:24:58.780 --> 02:25:00.860
I don't fucking care at all.

02:25:00.860 --> 02:25:03.660
If I say you're a fucking retard, I'm going to tell you that to your face.

02:25:03.660 --> 02:25:06.620
It's not going to make me all of a sudden, you know, sorry.

02:25:07.260 --> 02:25:09.020
Nintendo, I'll be with Reggie.

02:25:09.020 --> 02:25:12.300
Reggie, what the fuck is wrong with your stupid company and their goddamn network?

02:25:12.300 --> 02:25:15.100
I mean, can you fucking figure out internet for once?

02:25:15.100 --> 02:25:16.700
You know what the internet is, right?

02:25:16.700 --> 02:25:17.020
Okay.

02:25:17.660 --> 02:25:19.500
I mean, I don't have a problem talking to him.

02:25:22.060 --> 02:25:26.380
Fifth Dream in chat says, I think Sky is full of BS, gets to meet him on TV.

02:25:26.380 --> 02:25:32.220
No, I wouldn't subject myself to dumpster fire TV, but I would subject myself to this.

02:25:32.220 --> 02:25:35.020
Let's end on a positive note here because this is cool.

02:25:35.020 --> 02:25:40.220
Shout factory is going to be doing a reboot of the infamous eighties game show.

02:25:40.220 --> 02:25:41.420
Starrcade.

02:25:41.420 --> 02:25:41.820
Yes.

02:25:44.460 --> 02:25:47.260
And I am officially throwing my hat in the ring.

02:25:47.260 --> 02:25:48.380
I want to host this show.

02:25:48.380 --> 02:25:49.260
So fucking bad.

02:25:49.260 --> 02:25:50.940
Like, what do I have to do?

02:25:50.940 --> 02:25:52.620
Who do I, who do I have to blow?

02:25:52.620 --> 02:25:56.780
Who do I have to like, what do I have to do to host the new Starrcade?

02:25:57.420 --> 02:25:58.220
Chris Hardwick.

02:25:58.220 --> 02:25:58.860
I can do that.

02:25:59.500 --> 02:26:00.860
I can fucking do that wall.

02:26:00.860 --> 02:26:03.900
What's that bouncy ball Plinko shit thing he's hosting on NBC.

02:26:03.900 --> 02:26:04.940
Now I can do that.

02:26:06.620 --> 02:26:13.580
Anyway, shout factory is, uh, has acquired the rights to Starrcade and they are going

02:26:13.580 --> 02:26:15.100
to bring it back.

02:26:15.100 --> 02:26:20.060
And, um, they are also the company behind the new mystery science theater 3000.

02:26:20.060 --> 02:26:25.420
Uh, it's, uh, they've acquired the worldwide television format and ancillary rights to

02:26:25.420 --> 02:26:30.060
this, and they're planning to develop a retro boot, uh, a quote here.

02:26:30.060 --> 02:26:33.420
Starrcade is a classic game show from the eighties and is pure nostalgic fun.

02:26:33.500 --> 02:26:35.420
We couldn't be more excited to work with the original.

02:26:35.420 --> 02:26:39.340
So creators to retro boots, Starrcade for a new generation is going to be like, is it

02:26:39.340 --> 02:26:40.540
going to look like the old episodes?

02:26:40.540 --> 02:26:42.220
Like that'd be fantastic.

02:26:42.220 --> 02:26:45.900
As we continue to actively expand our reach into production and development for new series,

02:26:45.900 --> 02:26:47.580
movies, and scripted shows and specials.

02:26:47.580 --> 02:26:52.460
This deal exemplifies the type of content we plan to pursue, which taps into the interests

02:26:52.460 --> 02:26:54.620
and passions of our company's loyal fan base.

02:26:54.620 --> 02:26:58.140
A shop factory is going to work directly with JN production company who made the original

02:26:58.140 --> 02:27:01.820
show, uh, to create a version of this where celebrities.

02:27:02.620 --> 02:27:07.340
Again, probably people like Snooki, uh, e-sports professionals and pro gaming types will compete

02:27:07.340 --> 02:27:09.260
to see who is the top gamer on the planet.

02:27:09.260 --> 02:27:13.500
Why not just normal people or, you know, the whole point is just normal people.

02:27:13.500 --> 02:27:17.580
If this is like a retro boot type of thing, like my assumption is when I read into that,

02:27:17.580 --> 02:27:19.340
that maybe there'll be playing classic games.

02:27:19.340 --> 02:27:22.380
Like obviously there's an interest out there in classic gaming.

02:27:22.380 --> 02:27:24.460
Look what just happened with the classic Nintendo.

02:27:24.460 --> 02:27:25.900
Look at awesome games done quick.

02:27:25.900 --> 02:27:28.140
Most of those games they play on there are very old.

02:27:28.140 --> 02:27:30.460
I think there'd be a lot of people that would be like really into scene.

02:27:30.460 --> 02:27:31.900
I would love a show that's awesome.

02:27:31.900 --> 02:27:33.340
Awesome games done quick.

02:27:33.340 --> 02:27:37.980
The show, you know, every, every like day would be like, um, you know, a few hours or

02:27:37.980 --> 02:27:41.660
something like that, or they're going to have like an hour long show, have multi-part shows

02:27:41.660 --> 02:27:44.780
for like, you know, games are going to take like three hours or something, but that would

02:27:44.780 --> 02:27:45.340
be awesome.

02:27:45.340 --> 02:27:47.100
I would totally watch that.

02:27:47.100 --> 02:27:51.340
Uh, SSU 100 Matt says, Rob, did you get a chance to see the magfest game show thing?

02:27:51.340 --> 02:27:53.820
They did a spirited revival of the game show Nick arcade.

02:27:53.820 --> 02:27:56.620
No, I didn't, but I did see a gaming jeopardy.

02:27:56.620 --> 02:28:01.100
I went to a thing where they were playing jeopardy and, um, I'm gonna, I'm gonna probably

02:28:01.100 --> 02:28:03.340
bid to do some type of game show thing at magwest.

02:28:03.340 --> 02:28:11.340
Cause in my career in teaching, we do games like jeopardy, like weakest link or those

02:28:11.340 --> 02:28:11.980
types of games.

02:28:11.980 --> 02:28:13.580
Like we do that all the time.

02:28:13.580 --> 02:28:16.060
So I'm, I want to do a jeopardy panel.

02:28:16.060 --> 02:28:19.740
So I'm gonna, I'm gonna throw my hat into the ring for that, at least for magwest and

02:28:19.740 --> 02:28:20.380
see what happens.

02:28:20.940 --> 02:28:22.220
So I think it'd be fun.

02:28:22.220 --> 02:28:26.380
Game shows are fun, but I would really want to host this new Starrcade OMG.

02:28:26.380 --> 02:28:29.100
SSU 100 Matt says, Rob just wants to host a game show.

02:28:29.100 --> 02:28:29.820
Hell yeah.

02:28:29.820 --> 02:28:33.740
That was, that was my dream in the fourth grade was to be a game show host.

02:28:33.740 --> 02:28:34.940
Bob Barker was my idol.

02:28:34.940 --> 02:28:35.900
He still is in many ways.

02:28:35.900 --> 02:28:38.140
I love Bob Barker, national treasure.

02:28:38.780 --> 02:28:39.100
Anyway.

02:28:39.900 --> 02:28:42.140
Yet another celebrity that survived 2016.

02:28:42.140 --> 02:28:43.020
Thank God.

02:28:43.020 --> 02:28:43.580
Thank God.

02:28:44.540 --> 02:28:46.060
Don't forget to spay and neuter your pets.

02:28:46.060 --> 02:28:46.380
All right.

02:28:47.260 --> 02:28:47.580
That's it.

02:28:47.580 --> 02:28:48.540
We're going to skype line.

02:28:48.540 --> 02:28:53.980
One eight seven seven game OLR username on skype, orange lounge radio, all one word.

02:28:53.980 --> 02:28:57.340
Uh, you can give us a call and, uh, we'll talk about anything we've talked about so

02:28:57.340 --> 02:28:57.820
far tonight.

02:28:57.820 --> 02:29:00.780
I'm sure some of y'all have something to say on the switch, but if there's something we

02:29:00.780 --> 02:29:03.260
miss too, we can talk about that as well.

02:29:03.260 --> 02:29:04.140
I've got something to say.

02:29:04.140 --> 02:29:05.340
What's that Logie?

02:29:05.340 --> 02:29:08.700
So going back to what Reggie said, how there's going to be plenty of switch available at

02:29:08.700 --> 02:29:09.500
launch.

02:29:09.500 --> 02:29:12.780
GameStop has already sold out of their switch allocation and won't have any more until

02:29:12.780 --> 02:29:13.500
after launch.

02:29:15.740 --> 02:29:16.540
Womp womp.

02:29:17.420 --> 02:29:20.460
I'm just waiting to get the cancel notices from the other companies as well.

02:29:20.460 --> 02:29:23.420
But anyway, we've got a call coming in, so let's get to it.

02:29:23.420 --> 02:29:24.540
Hi, you're on orange launch radio.

02:29:24.540 --> 02:29:25.020
Who's this?

02:29:26.220 --> 02:29:26.860
Hello.

02:29:26.860 --> 02:29:27.420
Hey guys.

02:29:27.420 --> 02:29:27.820
Hi there.

02:29:27.820 --> 02:29:28.540
How's it going?

02:29:28.540 --> 02:29:29.260
Oh my gosh.

02:29:29.260 --> 02:29:30.140
There's two of you here.

02:29:30.140 --> 02:29:30.380
Hi.

02:29:33.580 --> 02:29:33.900
Hello.

02:29:33.900 --> 02:29:34.940
Who is this?

02:29:34.940 --> 02:29:36.940
Hey, it's DT and gamer girl.

02:29:36.940 --> 02:29:37.580
Hey guys.

02:29:37.580 --> 02:29:38.140
How you doing?

02:29:38.780 --> 02:29:39.260
Good.

02:29:39.260 --> 02:29:39.980
Doing well.

02:29:39.980 --> 02:29:40.860
Good to see you both.

02:29:40.860 --> 02:29:41.900
What's on your mind tonight?

02:29:42.780 --> 02:29:48.860
Um, we were, well, he showed me, um, one of the shadow run, shadow run returns.

02:29:48.860 --> 02:29:49.260
Yeah.

02:29:49.260 --> 02:29:52.700
And I really liked it cause I've never played anything like it.

02:29:52.700 --> 02:29:53.740
And I really liked it.

02:29:53.740 --> 02:29:56.060
It reminded me of X-com a little bit.

02:29:57.580 --> 02:30:02.860
I have not played shadow run returns yet, but back to Kickstarter, I have the game and

02:30:02.860 --> 02:30:04.620
it sits with the rest of my steam library.

02:30:05.500 --> 02:30:06.620
Shame on you.

02:30:06.620 --> 02:30:07.900
I even have the expansion.

02:30:07.900 --> 02:30:11.180
I'm glad someone out there is playing it when you, uh, when you're failing.

02:30:11.260 --> 02:30:12.140
I do want to play it.

02:30:12.140 --> 02:30:13.020
I liked shadow run.

02:30:13.020 --> 02:30:15.500
I liked the old SES, uh, shadow run game.

02:30:15.500 --> 02:30:16.220
Yeah.

02:30:16.220 --> 02:30:16.620
Well, good.

02:30:16.620 --> 02:30:18.460
I'm glad you guys are enjoying it there.

02:30:18.460 --> 02:30:19.020
Oh yeah.

02:30:19.020 --> 02:30:19.660
Oh yeah.

02:30:19.660 --> 02:30:21.580
Do you guys watch any of the awesome games done quick?

02:30:22.300 --> 02:30:22.860
A little bit.

02:30:22.860 --> 02:30:23.340
Yeah.

02:30:23.340 --> 02:30:23.580
Yeah.

02:30:24.220 --> 02:30:27.180
He actually started getting me into it cause I've never heard of them until the other

02:30:27.180 --> 02:30:27.500
day.

02:30:27.500 --> 02:30:29.980
So I was just really happy.

02:30:29.980 --> 02:30:32.140
Like, well, I thought it was pretty cool.

02:30:33.500 --> 02:30:33.660
Yeah.

02:30:33.660 --> 02:30:37.660
I mean, super Metroid is like my favorite game of all time as you all well know.

02:30:37.660 --> 02:30:40.460
Uh, and watching the speed run of it is just always so much fun.

02:30:40.460 --> 02:30:41.740
And it's like, even it goes so fast.

02:30:41.740 --> 02:30:45.500
I'm always kind of like, and every year I'm like that you can do that in that game.

02:30:45.500 --> 02:30:46.220
I never realized that.

02:30:46.220 --> 02:30:48.700
Of course they do anything different each year in that.

02:30:48.700 --> 02:30:50.780
Like, do they like up their straps or anything?

02:30:50.780 --> 02:30:54.220
Like, uh, some years they'll do an any percent run.

02:30:54.220 --> 02:30:56.220
Some years they'll do a hundred percent run.

02:30:56.220 --> 02:30:58.860
This year was a race, a hundred percent run.

02:30:58.860 --> 02:31:03.020
So four people did it all at once and they had to collect a hundred percent of the items.

02:31:03.020 --> 02:31:05.900
And I think the winning time was like an hour and 22 minutes.

02:31:05.900 --> 02:31:07.500
Don't quote me on that, but I think it was something like that.

02:31:07.500 --> 02:31:08.300
It was less than that.

02:31:08.300 --> 02:31:11.180
It was like an hour and 16.

02:31:11.180 --> 02:31:11.660
Wow.

02:31:11.660 --> 02:31:12.460
Yeah, 16.

02:31:12.460 --> 02:31:13.100
Wow.

02:31:13.100 --> 02:31:17.340
But yeah, I mean, it's cool to see like four people doing it at once because you know,

02:31:17.340 --> 02:31:20.780
the two on the left side were neck and neck throughout the whole thing.

02:31:20.780 --> 02:31:23.500
And they were only like seconds apart in the, in it.

02:31:23.500 --> 02:31:27.820
And then one of the guys who was like in the upper right, like just made a boo boo,

02:31:27.820 --> 02:31:29.020
like mistakes happen.

02:31:29.020 --> 02:31:34.220
If you miss one jump, you miss one thing and it put the guy like four minutes behind everybody

02:31:34.220 --> 02:31:35.340
else is just unfortunate.

02:31:35.340 --> 02:31:39.660
But that's, that's the nature of speed running sometimes is that you, if you make one mistake,

02:31:40.380 --> 02:31:45.740
it's, you know, or as somebody else was saying, is that if you die in the Super Metroid run,

02:31:45.740 --> 02:31:48.220
it's over because you don't have time to save.

02:31:48.220 --> 02:31:50.620
You, you can't just run to a save room and save your game.

02:31:50.620 --> 02:31:51.980
That takes too long.

02:31:51.980 --> 02:31:54.940
So it's quicker because it was coming down here.

02:31:54.940 --> 02:31:56.620
Did anyone get killed during the run?

02:31:57.980 --> 02:31:59.980
No, no, but everybody lived through the run.

02:31:59.980 --> 02:32:00.780
Oh, okay.

02:32:00.780 --> 02:32:03.980
And the previous run, some people didn't make it out.

02:32:03.980 --> 02:32:09.660
And save the animals one, which kill one last year, if I remember right, and save one this

02:32:09.660 --> 02:32:10.060
year.

02:32:10.060 --> 02:32:14.300
And it's probably less frames to save the animals than it is to save the game.

02:32:14.940 --> 02:32:18.700
So, you know, that's, uh, I don't think it was that big a waste.

02:32:18.700 --> 02:32:24.140
And I did look, I looked carefully for that little dot that flies off the planet when

02:32:24.140 --> 02:32:25.340
you save the animals.

02:32:25.340 --> 02:32:29.500
Cause in my opinion, that's the big reward, uh, for the save the animals folk.

02:32:29.500 --> 02:32:30.940
It says, I see the dot.

02:32:30.940 --> 02:32:31.740
I did it.

02:32:31.740 --> 02:32:34.220
My donations made that dot appear four times.

02:32:35.580 --> 02:32:38.460
Anyway, um, what do you guys think on the switch?

02:32:38.460 --> 02:32:41.980
You guys, uh, going to be getting a switch or not so into it or what?

02:32:42.940 --> 02:32:47.420
I'm kind of iffy right now, just because I don't really see too many games that I want

02:32:47.420 --> 02:32:47.900
yet.

02:32:47.900 --> 02:32:49.340
So I'm going to wait.

02:32:49.340 --> 02:32:53.660
Plus I never, I, I have a five rule or five game rule.

02:32:53.660 --> 02:32:56.300
If there's five games that I like, then I usually get the system.

02:32:56.300 --> 02:32:57.580
But if not, then I don't.

02:32:57.580 --> 02:33:00.140
That way I feel like it's not a waste of money for me.

02:33:00.140 --> 02:33:01.820
It's honestly not a bad rule.

02:33:01.820 --> 02:33:05.660
And considering the system is only launching with five games, going to be pretty hard to

02:33:05.660 --> 02:33:07.660
meet that rule day one, but it's not for me.

02:33:07.660 --> 02:33:12.540
It's three, but, but yes, I think a lot of people have a rule like that.

02:33:12.540 --> 02:33:16.620
And what that always goes back to the old, uh, golden rule of gaming here at OLR.

02:33:16.620 --> 02:33:19.180
A system is only as good as the games that are on it, right?

02:33:20.220 --> 02:33:20.620
Yep.

02:33:20.620 --> 02:33:24.300
I'll probably try and get one by holiday cause all the other games will be out by then.

02:33:24.940 --> 02:33:25.260
Yeah.

02:33:25.260 --> 02:33:27.500
We'll see how the conversation shifts during E3.

02:33:27.500 --> 02:33:28.140
That's for sure.

02:33:28.780 --> 02:33:29.340
Definitely.

02:33:29.900 --> 02:33:34.460
I'm definitely picking up, um, Breath of the Wild though for Wii, for the Wii U.

02:33:34.460 --> 02:33:34.860
Oh yeah.

02:33:34.860 --> 02:33:36.380
I've been waiting for that one forever.

02:33:36.380 --> 02:33:38.380
How could you not after that trailer?

02:33:38.380 --> 02:33:39.740
That was, uh,

02:33:39.740 --> 02:33:41.420
Oh, there's boys acting all right.

02:33:41.420 --> 02:33:41.820
Me too.

02:33:42.780 --> 02:33:46.220
Like the Zelda crying thing was so like, whoa.

02:33:46.220 --> 02:33:49.180
Like, you know, uh, yeah, it was just, it was very powerful.

02:33:49.180 --> 02:33:50.220
I'm excited.

02:33:50.220 --> 02:33:53.900
So, but I, I have a, I have a feeling Zelda's not just going to cry.

02:33:53.900 --> 02:33:57.020
Zelda's going to be a bad-ass like she always, I'm hoping, I'm hoping.

02:33:57.020 --> 02:33:58.300
So, all right.

02:33:58.300 --> 02:33:59.740
Oh, I'm definitely getting that too.

02:34:00.460 --> 02:34:05.260
It also reminds me of, um, oh, I can't think of the name of the game.

02:34:05.260 --> 02:34:06.140
Nino?

02:34:06.140 --> 02:34:07.180
No, not Nino.

02:34:07.180 --> 02:34:13.260
Well, um, the one that, uh, the artist for, uh, Totoro worked on.

02:34:14.220 --> 02:34:15.180
Nino Kuni?

02:34:15.180 --> 02:34:16.060
Nino Kuni.

02:34:16.060 --> 02:34:16.300
Yeah.

02:34:16.940 --> 02:34:19.980
The art kind of sort of reminds me of it a little bit.

02:34:19.980 --> 02:34:21.500
A little bit, a little bit.

02:34:21.500 --> 02:34:24.540
Um, hey, Nino Kuni 2 should be a thing this year, huh?

02:34:24.540 --> 02:34:27.340
They were teased that on the PlayStation 4 a long time ago.

02:34:27.340 --> 02:34:27.580
Yeah.

02:34:27.580 --> 02:34:29.980
I think, isn't it supposed to be coming out soon or something?

02:34:30.860 --> 02:34:32.700
Remember Nino Kuni 2 announcement?

02:34:32.700 --> 02:34:33.180
Remember that?

02:34:33.740 --> 02:34:34.620
All right.

02:34:34.620 --> 02:34:34.860
All right.

02:34:34.860 --> 02:34:37.340
Well, you guys, I'm going to let you go so we can try to squeeze in some more calls,

02:34:37.340 --> 02:34:39.100
but it's a pleasure to hear from you both.

02:34:39.100 --> 02:34:42.460
Uh, have a good, uh, uh, time you guys and I'll, uh, talk to you again soon.

02:34:43.180 --> 02:34:43.740
All right.

02:34:43.740 --> 02:34:43.980
Bye.

02:34:44.780 --> 02:34:45.020
Bye.

02:34:45.660 --> 02:34:45.900
All right.

02:34:45.900 --> 02:34:48.700
Dark Tetsuya and Gamer Girl, making a joint call in the show.

02:34:48.700 --> 02:34:52.380
And we saw video, sorry to those of you guys, uh, on the radio.

02:34:52.380 --> 02:34:53.420
Happens sometimes.

02:34:53.420 --> 02:34:55.420
Uh, Orange Launch Radio, all one word on Skype.

02:34:55.420 --> 02:35:00.060
If you want to give our show a call, uh, Dungeon Busters in chat, pointing out the

02:35:00.060 --> 02:35:01.980
DuckTales race was really Epic.

02:35:01.980 --> 02:35:04.540
Only a second or two difference.

02:35:04.540 --> 02:35:09.580
Uh, VX JasonXV our fearless announcer says dying in a hundred percent races isn't very

02:35:09.580 --> 02:35:14.460
common because the nature of getting tanks and whatnot, not dying in any percent, which

02:35:14.460 --> 02:35:19.020
amounts to like 13%, I think is fairly common and very brutal.

02:35:19.580 --> 02:35:20.540
Uh, let's get to the phones.

02:35:20.540 --> 02:35:21.260
We got more calls.

02:35:21.260 --> 02:35:21.900
It's lighting up tonight.

02:35:21.900 --> 02:35:22.860
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:35:22.860 --> 02:35:23.260
Who's this?

02:35:24.060 --> 02:35:24.940
It's a Ziba.

02:35:24.940 --> 02:35:25.500
Hey, Ziba.

02:35:25.500 --> 02:35:26.540
How you doing?

02:35:26.540 --> 02:35:27.260
I'm good.

02:35:27.260 --> 02:35:27.580
Good.

02:35:27.580 --> 02:35:28.140
I'm sorry.

02:35:28.140 --> 02:35:29.260
I missed you at MAGFest.

02:35:29.260 --> 02:35:33.260
I know I was thinking that I'm like, I totally missed you at MAGFest this year, but I don't

02:35:33.260 --> 02:35:33.500
know.

02:35:33.500 --> 02:35:36.060
This year was just different than last year.

02:35:36.060 --> 02:35:37.660
Like I spent a lot of time.

02:35:37.660 --> 02:35:38.540
It's gonna sound horrible.

02:35:38.540 --> 02:35:43.820
I spent a lot of time in room parties, which is the opposite this time.

02:35:43.820 --> 02:35:50.300
I really did a little bit of room parties, but, um, I did a lot more, um, like I went

02:35:50.300 --> 02:35:54.140
to a lot more things that happened in MAGFest last year.

02:35:54.140 --> 02:35:58.540
I kind of just like, kind of went with my group around, but this time I just went on

02:35:58.540 --> 02:36:00.460
my own and I did some of my own things.

02:36:00.460 --> 02:36:00.780
Nice.

02:36:00.780 --> 02:36:02.140
What kinds of things did you see?

02:36:02.780 --> 02:36:04.540
So good thing you brought that up.

02:36:04.540 --> 02:36:05.820
That's what I wanted to talk about.

02:36:05.820 --> 02:36:11.020
Um, I had a really like great experience at MAGFest that I wanted to talk about.

02:36:11.020 --> 02:36:11.580
Sure.

02:36:11.580 --> 02:36:15.500
Um, so you do know that David Wise was there, right?

02:36:15.500 --> 02:36:16.220
Yes, I'd heard that.

02:36:16.220 --> 02:36:17.340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:36:17.340 --> 02:36:17.980
Okay.

02:36:17.980 --> 02:36:21.420
So I think it was Saturday.

02:36:22.380 --> 02:36:28.300
Um, I, after I went to a panel, I went back to my room to go get something and I heard

02:36:28.300 --> 02:36:29.100
a knock on the door.

02:36:30.220 --> 02:36:34.220
So I opened it up and it's one of my, um, Overclock Remix friends.

02:36:34.220 --> 02:36:41.100
Cause I was with them in, um, um, MAGFest and she goes, David Wise is in my room.

02:36:41.100 --> 02:36:42.140
I went, what?

02:36:42.700 --> 02:36:46.780
So like I threw everything around and I went to her room.

02:36:46.780 --> 02:36:48.140
Sure enough, he's there.

02:36:48.140 --> 02:36:53.020
And there was a whole bunch of other people from OC Remix there and they were playing,

02:36:53.020 --> 02:36:57.100
um, Donkey Kong, who was kind of funny.

02:36:57.100 --> 02:37:00.940
Um, so like he turned and looked at me and I was like, hi.

02:37:03.180 --> 02:37:04.140
And he's like, hi.

02:37:05.500 --> 02:37:11.900
And, um, I kind of like sat next to him and what was really awesome is like OC Remix,

02:37:11.900 --> 02:37:15.020
they do remixes for video games if anybody didn't know.

02:37:15.020 --> 02:37:16.380
Um, so there was,

02:37:16.380 --> 02:37:17.740
I don't know how anybody listened.

02:37:17.740 --> 02:37:20.940
I don't know how anybody listening to this show could not know of OC Remix.

02:37:20.940 --> 02:37:21.580
Seriously.

02:37:21.580 --> 02:37:25.260
Like if you don't know, educate yourself.

02:37:26.540 --> 02:37:27.500
Yes, that's right.

02:37:27.500 --> 02:37:28.140
Know your roots.

02:37:30.540 --> 02:37:36.940
So there was some, um, remixers there that have done, um, like remixes for Donkey Kong.

02:37:36.940 --> 02:37:42.940
So they were going over like next to him with like earphones and with their phones and going,

02:37:42.940 --> 02:37:46.940
hey Dave, can, can you listen to one of my remixes?

02:37:47.500 --> 02:37:49.340
And he was like, yeah, sure.

02:37:49.900 --> 02:37:51.900
So like it was a couple of them.

02:37:51.900 --> 02:37:58.460
And, um, one of them stuck out at me because she was like, so like, like nervous talking to him.

02:37:58.460 --> 02:38:05.260
And, um, she was gave her, gave him, um, the earphones and like played the, her song and

02:38:05.260 --> 02:38:07.900
like his face lit up and I was like, whoa.

02:38:08.780 --> 02:38:14.140
And, um, I didn't really listen to the remix myself, but he was just like, wow, I haven't,

02:38:14.140 --> 02:38:18.060
I've never heard my song, um, like be made that way.

02:38:18.620 --> 02:38:24.860
And it was just a great experience of having like people go to him with their music,

02:38:25.820 --> 02:38:27.660
like remixed of his music.

02:38:28.460 --> 02:38:29.980
And it was nice.

02:38:29.980 --> 02:38:31.580
And then after that, um,

02:38:31.580 --> 02:38:34.380
So in other words, you did do room parties.

02:38:34.460 --> 02:38:38.140
Only your room parties had former rare composers at them.

02:38:38.140 --> 02:38:38.640
Yes.

02:38:39.660 --> 02:38:43.020
I see way to, way to, way to one up my stories.

02:38:45.660 --> 02:38:52.460
So after all that, um, kind of calmed down a little bit and, uh, they left the, um,

02:38:52.460 --> 02:38:53.900
they left Donkey Kong running.

02:38:54.780 --> 02:39:02.460
And so it kind of got quiet and all of a sudden I started, I heard David Wise kind of hum

02:39:02.940 --> 02:39:03.900
one of the songs.

02:39:05.660 --> 02:39:07.820
I was funny catching him do that.

02:39:07.820 --> 02:39:12.540
And then, um, oh man, it was, it was, oh, there was one other thing.

02:39:12.540 --> 02:39:17.900
So, um, when they were playing, they were, they were in one of the, um, stages that was

02:39:17.900 --> 02:39:18.700
in a cave.

02:39:19.260 --> 02:39:23.260
I'm not really too familiar with Donkey Kong because I was, didn't really play them as

02:39:23.260 --> 02:39:29.020
much as a kid, but, um, in one of the cave, uh, levels, there was like a dripping noise

02:39:29.020 --> 02:39:37.020
and he was like, Hey, you know, that dripping noise was a noise in my apartment that I recorded

02:39:37.820 --> 02:39:43.980
and we're like, Whoa, it was a so neat hearing some of his stories.

02:39:44.540 --> 02:39:49.500
Um, I, I went to the, um, one of the panels that he was at too.

02:39:50.060 --> 02:39:55.580
Uh, it was the game composer, um, Q and A, um, that was really neat too.

02:39:55.580 --> 02:40:02.620
Cause I got to hear, uh, you know, some snippets of like a bunch of game composers, but, um,

02:40:02.620 --> 02:40:09.740
but that, that like, um, part and magfest of meeting him in a room and like talking to

02:40:09.740 --> 02:40:11.580
him, it was just a great experience.

02:40:12.300 --> 02:40:15.820
And that sounds like one of those things you could really like only have at a magfest or

02:40:15.820 --> 02:40:16.620
as a convention.

02:40:16.620 --> 02:40:20.220
That's still, I mean, obviously magfest has grown very large, but it still has a lot of

02:40:20.220 --> 02:40:23.580
like small community vibes kind of going on with it for sure.

02:40:24.300 --> 02:40:27.100
So, but that's definitely, I agree.

02:40:27.660 --> 02:40:30.060
That's an, that's an awesome, awesome story.

02:40:30.060 --> 02:40:33.020
So, um, I don't, I don't blame you for ignoring me all weekend.

02:40:33.020 --> 02:40:35.260
I w I would have to, if you had, no, I'm just kidding.

02:40:35.260 --> 02:40:38.220
Obviously it just didn't work out and there was, I didn't have a really good space to

02:40:38.220 --> 02:40:41.420
meet up or anything, but hopefully, hopefully, uh, next time.

02:40:41.420 --> 02:40:45.100
So I will definitely plan on being at magfest, uh, next year.

02:40:45.100 --> 02:40:47.100
Did you catch any of the concerts real quick?

02:40:47.740 --> 02:40:48.220
Yes.

02:40:48.220 --> 02:40:50.300
Um, I went to a couple.

02:40:50.380 --> 02:40:53.180
Um, I'm trying to think of one of the names.

02:40:53.180 --> 02:40:55.100
Um, Oh crap.

02:40:55.100 --> 02:40:56.140
You put me on the spot.

02:40:56.140 --> 02:40:57.100
So were you there?

02:40:57.100 --> 02:41:04.060
Think of like proto man, David wise kind of like made my whole like memory go away, but

02:41:04.060 --> 02:41:05.180
I went to a couple of them.

02:41:05.180 --> 02:41:06.460
They were pretty neat.

02:41:06.460 --> 02:41:06.780
Nice.

02:41:07.500 --> 02:41:08.140
All right.

02:41:08.140 --> 02:41:12.140
Well, Ziba, thanks so much for the call and for sharing the story and, uh, yeah, that's

02:41:12.140 --> 02:41:12.460
awesome.

02:41:12.460 --> 02:41:15.740
But you know, I think it's, it's a good reminder too, that, you know, David wise and a lot

02:41:15.740 --> 02:41:20.060
of these gaming folks that go to these conventions, you know, they, they are

02:41:20.060 --> 02:41:25.340
completely normal people as well that are probably truly humbled by the people that

02:41:25.340 --> 02:41:28.620
have the positive reactions to their stuff that they do.

02:41:28.620 --> 02:41:33.740
You know, I'm, you know, I, I don't like have these delusions that OLR is this massively

02:41:33.740 --> 02:41:37.820
popular podcast or anything, but you know, once in a while, you know, somebody will tell

02:41:37.820 --> 02:41:41.100
me at a convention or something like they'll tell me about a particular episode or a story.

02:41:41.100 --> 02:41:45.260
And it's funny because oftentimes I probably can't even remember the exact episode of the

02:41:45.260 --> 02:41:49.500
story, but I'm always humbled that people like do take those kinds of memories from

02:41:49.500 --> 02:41:50.540
the show and so forth.

02:41:50.540 --> 02:41:51.900
And it's just, it's, it's amazing.

02:41:51.900 --> 02:41:54.060
And just, you know, fuzzy wuzzy feelings all over.

02:41:54.060 --> 02:41:55.660
So yes, definitely.

02:41:55.660 --> 02:41:56.940
Magfest does that to you.

02:41:58.220 --> 02:41:58.700
All right.

02:41:58.700 --> 02:42:00.780
Well, Ziba, I'm gonna let you go to try and squeeze in some more calls.

02:42:00.780 --> 02:42:01.020
Okay.

02:42:01.660 --> 02:42:02.060
All right.

02:42:02.060 --> 02:42:02.380
Thanks.

02:42:02.380 --> 02:42:03.260
Take care.

02:42:03.260 --> 02:42:03.500
All right.

02:42:03.500 --> 02:42:04.060
You too.

02:42:04.060 --> 02:42:04.300
Bye.

02:42:05.260 --> 02:42:05.580
Okay.

02:42:05.580 --> 02:42:07.420
Our, our Skype line is on fire tonight.

02:42:07.420 --> 02:42:09.660
You guys, I'm gonna try my best to get a couple more of these in.

02:42:09.660 --> 02:42:10.620
Hi, you're on orange on radio.

02:42:10.620 --> 02:42:11.500
Who's this?

02:42:11.500 --> 02:42:12.780
Hey, what's going on everybody?

02:42:12.780 --> 02:42:13.340
It's Ron.

02:42:13.340 --> 02:42:13.740
Hey, Ron.

02:42:13.740 --> 02:42:15.020
That was good to see you last week.

02:42:15.660 --> 02:42:15.900
Dude.

02:42:15.900 --> 02:42:16.700
It was good to see you too.

02:42:16.700 --> 02:42:17.180
After what?

02:42:17.260 --> 02:42:18.380
Almost 10 years.

02:42:18.380 --> 02:42:19.020
Something like that.

02:42:19.020 --> 02:42:19.340
Was it?

02:42:19.340 --> 02:42:19.580
Has it?

02:42:19.580 --> 02:42:21.340
No, it hadn't been that long, had it?

02:42:22.620 --> 02:42:24.860
It's kind of along those lines.

02:42:24.860 --> 02:42:25.340
Oh my God.

02:42:25.340 --> 02:42:27.820
No, there was, there was Katsucon that one year.

02:42:27.820 --> 02:42:28.380
Fanime.

02:42:29.020 --> 02:42:31.340
God, it really has been a long time, hasn't it?

02:42:31.340 --> 02:42:33.260
First was Fanime, then it was Katsucon.

02:42:33.260 --> 02:42:35.660
So that'd be like seven or eight years.

02:42:35.660 --> 02:42:40.620
And I cannot find one picture of you cosplaying Black Mage from Final Fantasy.

02:42:40.620 --> 02:42:42.860
Yeah, that, that was the thing that happened, that it happened.

02:42:43.740 --> 02:42:46.940
Yeah, you never, you never make it to Dragon Con.

02:42:47.740 --> 02:42:49.180
That's the last time I saw you before this.

02:42:49.180 --> 02:42:49.660
PAX East.

02:42:49.660 --> 02:42:50.140
PAX East.

02:42:50.140 --> 02:42:52.060
Yeah, I was like, I knew it had to be more recent than that.

02:42:52.060 --> 02:42:52.860
Yes, PAX East.

02:42:53.420 --> 02:42:53.820
Yes.

02:42:55.900 --> 02:42:56.300
Awesome.

02:42:56.300 --> 02:42:57.260
Well, what's on your mind tonight?

02:42:57.820 --> 02:42:58.620
First things first.

02:43:02.140 --> 02:43:04.220
You cut, you cut out there a little bit, buddy.

02:43:04.220 --> 02:43:05.580
Try first things first again.

02:43:06.700 --> 02:43:10.620
No, the reason why I'm cutting out a little, because I'm just kind of verklempt about how

02:43:10.620 --> 02:43:12.540
much of an amazing time I had at Magfest.

02:43:12.540 --> 02:43:13.980
I had a fucking ball.

02:43:13.980 --> 02:43:14.300
That's right.

02:43:14.300 --> 02:43:15.660
Cause that was your first Magfest.

02:43:15.740 --> 02:43:19.580
We even kind of had to, we had to nudge you a little bit going, dude, you really should

02:43:19.580 --> 02:43:20.700
check out Magfest.

02:43:20.700 --> 02:43:23.580
Well, to be fair, the listeners had to do the same thing to me.

02:43:23.580 --> 02:43:26.380
Like YYR and SSG100, Matt, like really had to pester me.

02:43:26.380 --> 02:43:30.300
Like if you're, if you're burned out on PAX, dude, you should really, really try going

02:43:30.300 --> 02:43:30.620
to Magfest.

02:43:30.620 --> 02:43:31.500
No, really Rob?

02:43:31.500 --> 02:43:33.100
Rob, fucking go to Magfest.

02:43:33.100 --> 02:43:33.900
And so I did.

02:43:33.900 --> 02:43:36.620
And I was like, Oh my God, why didn't you guys tell me this sooner?

02:43:36.620 --> 02:43:37.180
We did.

02:43:38.540 --> 02:43:39.660
You know what it is?

02:43:39.660 --> 02:43:41.500
It's just the timing of the convention.

02:43:41.500 --> 02:43:46.860
It's like, it's right after New Year's and I'm in, I'm in the transition of getting finances

02:43:46.860 --> 02:43:51.100
and ready for con season 2000XX, you know?

02:43:51.100 --> 02:43:55.580
And it's like this year, even though I said I was going, it actually snuck up on me.

02:43:55.580 --> 02:43:57.340
I was like, Oh, right.

02:43:57.340 --> 02:43:59.740
I could actually get my shit together for that.

02:43:59.740 --> 02:44:01.900
I liked the February thing last year.

02:44:01.900 --> 02:44:04.540
I know not everybody's into that, but for me, that really worked out.

02:44:04.540 --> 02:44:06.300
I know Bobby was a big fan of that too.

02:44:06.300 --> 02:44:11.100
I didn't like this whole like days after New Year's Eve, especially it was really weird

02:44:11.100 --> 02:44:14.860
at work because most people at work are gone between Christmas and New Year.

02:44:14.860 --> 02:44:16.620
And I was still there doing my thing.

02:44:16.620 --> 02:44:18.780
And then, you know, everybody's like, Oh, how's your holiday?

02:44:18.780 --> 02:44:19.100
Great.

02:44:19.100 --> 02:44:19.580
Oh, wait.

02:44:19.580 --> 02:44:20.700
Any plans now that you're back?

02:44:20.700 --> 02:44:23.180
It's like, yeah, I'm actually going on my holiday now.

02:44:23.180 --> 02:44:23.500
See ya.

02:44:24.700 --> 02:44:25.740
It's like, it's weird.

02:44:26.380 --> 02:44:31.020
You see about last year, it was mostly the East Coast cosplayers that were losing their

02:44:31.020 --> 02:44:34.940
proverbial shit because the weekend before that was Capsicon.

02:44:34.940 --> 02:44:38.060
And there were people deciding on which convention to go.

02:44:38.060 --> 02:44:40.380
There are some people like, I'm doing both.

02:44:41.740 --> 02:44:43.260
Yeah, that would be rough to do too.

02:44:43.260 --> 02:44:47.740
That's the one thing that is going to be tough about this year is that MagWest and DragonCon

02:44:47.740 --> 02:44:48.540
are back to back.

02:44:48.540 --> 02:44:53.420
Thankfully, MagWest is in my backyard, but there's a really good, there's a really good

02:44:53.420 --> 02:44:57.420
chance that with DragonCon this year, I'm just going to be like, fuck it and take the

02:44:57.420 --> 02:44:58.540
entire week off work.

02:44:59.180 --> 02:44:59.980
Well, there you go.

02:44:59.980 --> 02:45:00.700
You should do that.

02:45:00.700 --> 02:45:03.100
And I'm definitely gonna try to come down Thursday.

02:45:03.100 --> 02:45:04.620
Oh, are you doing DragonCon this year?

02:45:05.180 --> 02:45:06.620
No, I'm talking about MagFest.

02:45:07.180 --> 02:45:08.140
No, I'm at MagWest.

02:45:09.100 --> 02:45:14.940
Well, I'm sorry, I'm a little discombobulated right now because I'm still excited about

02:45:14.940 --> 02:45:18.620
the whole thing and I'm editing photos from the con and all that craziness, you know.

02:45:19.260 --> 02:45:22.540
Well, at least it sounds like I'll see you at MagFest 2018, if nothing else.

02:45:23.180 --> 02:45:23.900
Yes.

02:45:23.900 --> 02:45:24.860
Let me say a couple more things.

02:45:24.860 --> 02:45:25.660
I'm gonna get out of here.

02:45:25.660 --> 02:45:26.160
Yep.

02:45:26.540 --> 02:45:29.900
My 2000 gaming pick was Azure Striker Gunvolt.

02:45:31.340 --> 02:45:34.940
It's Mega Man X meets an angry pissed off person.

02:45:34.940 --> 02:45:36.300
That's pretty much what it is.

02:45:36.780 --> 02:45:39.180
I'll have to check that out because I don't think I've played that.

02:45:39.580 --> 02:45:41.180
It's on 3DS and Steam.

02:45:41.180 --> 02:45:42.380
It's a really fun game.

02:45:43.900 --> 02:45:44.540
Awesome.

02:45:44.540 --> 02:45:46.700
And you said you had something else you want to get out?

02:45:46.700 --> 02:45:49.020
Yeah, this whole Nintendo's network.

02:45:49.020 --> 02:45:52.700
They're going to use, I'm calling it right now, they're using the Nintendo Network ID

02:45:52.700 --> 02:45:58.220
protocol that they start implementing around the time of the, they brought out Miitomo

02:45:58.220 --> 02:45:58.940
and his other stuff.

02:45:58.940 --> 02:46:00.380
That's what they're going to move to.

02:46:00.380 --> 02:46:02.540
I don't see them using friend codes anymore.

02:46:02.540 --> 02:46:05.980
And if they do that same with the 3DS, they're going with the Nintendo.

02:46:06.220 --> 02:46:07.500
Nintendo network ID thing.

02:46:07.500 --> 02:46:08.780
That's why I see them happening.

02:46:08.780 --> 02:46:09.820
I think you're right.

02:46:09.820 --> 02:46:14.060
Because if you guys remember, right, that was the whole reason we found out about the

02:46:14.060 --> 02:46:17.100
NX using my quotey fingers the whole time.

02:46:17.100 --> 02:46:20.700
The whole reason we found out about the NX when they revealed it like way earlier than

02:46:20.700 --> 02:46:24.700
they were ready to talk about it was because they were talking about a Nintendo network

02:46:24.700 --> 02:46:25.200
type of thing.

02:46:27.500 --> 02:46:35.660
And to answer what Loki was saying earlier, the Switch console could use GPS, but you

02:46:36.220 --> 02:46:42.140
has to be ready for it via Bluetooth because I have a smartwatch and it can do GPS provided

02:46:42.140 --> 02:46:45.820
that it syncs with my phone and it pulls the GPS coordinates.

02:46:45.820 --> 02:46:52.300
So you can, if the Switch can do Bluetooth through the smartphone and if somebody does

02:46:52.300 --> 02:46:58.620
the right hacking, you could implement GPS and you could also implement hotspotting through

02:46:58.620 --> 02:46:59.100
Bluetooth.

02:46:59.100 --> 02:47:00.540
So you got that.

02:47:00.540 --> 02:47:03.900
Yeah, which to be fair, we don't know if that Switch has Bluetooth in it.

02:47:03.900 --> 02:47:05.100
I don't think it does, right?

02:47:05.100 --> 02:47:10.060
It probably doesn't and they wouldn't do it like in an app like Pokemon Go or something

02:47:10.060 --> 02:47:14.460
like that wouldn't do that because then you're trusting a Bluetooth device to provide accurate

02:47:14.460 --> 02:47:17.500
GPS information, which that could be spoofed.

02:47:17.500 --> 02:47:20.540
So of course, they're not going to open themselves up to that.

02:47:20.540 --> 02:47:21.040
True.

02:47:21.500 --> 02:47:26.060
The app would have to be on the console side and they'd have to heavily lock it down.

02:47:26.060 --> 02:47:32.860
And looking at the prices of the Switch and accessories, I personally think the prices

02:47:32.860 --> 02:47:35.260
are ridiculous, but you know what?

02:47:35.980 --> 02:47:41.260
Nintendo is going to make a profit off of every single one of them consoles and accessories

02:47:41.260 --> 02:47:43.100
and controllers sold.

02:47:43.100 --> 02:47:48.060
Nintendo does not make a loss on the hardware they sell and that's a very hard line they

02:47:48.060 --> 02:47:49.660
drew in their company a long time ago.

02:47:49.660 --> 02:47:55.100
I think the only time they ever sold something at a loss was when they finally price cut

02:47:55.100 --> 02:47:55.740
the 3DS.

02:47:55.740 --> 02:47:56.300
I think.

02:47:56.300 --> 02:47:57.500
Yeah, that was it.

02:47:57.500 --> 02:47:57.980
That was it.

02:47:58.540 --> 02:47:59.900
Unless you want to count the Virtual Boy.

02:48:00.540 --> 02:48:02.300
Well, no, I don't.

02:48:02.300 --> 02:48:05.660
All right, Rama, my friend, I'm gonna let you go so we can wrap up.

02:48:06.220 --> 02:48:06.700
All right, cool.

02:48:06.700 --> 02:48:10.060
And most likely I will be getting a Switch and I'll probably be staying at home while

02:48:10.060 --> 02:48:11.180
I play Mario Kart 8.

02:48:11.180 --> 02:48:15.580
It's probably going to happen, but I'm just going to wait and see more games coming out.

02:48:15.580 --> 02:48:19.900
But that also means if you bring your Switch to MAGFest 2018, we get to all play Mario

02:48:19.900 --> 02:48:20.380
Kart 8.

02:48:20.380 --> 02:48:21.180
It's going to be a blast.

02:48:21.820 --> 02:48:25.260
That will probably be the only time my Switch will leave the system.

02:48:25.260 --> 02:48:26.060
I mean, leave the house.

02:48:26.060 --> 02:48:28.300
So, you know, I'll price an email about this later.

02:48:28.300 --> 02:48:29.980
So we'll definitely do some coffee later.

02:48:29.980 --> 02:48:30.700
All right, take care.

02:48:31.340 --> 02:48:31.980
Take care.

02:48:32.300 --> 02:48:34.700
That's one thing that's going to end with the Switch as well.

02:48:34.700 --> 02:48:40.140
If you may think about it for, you know, like the 3DS and DS is that SharePlay stuff.

02:48:40.140 --> 02:48:41.180
They don't have that.

02:48:41.180 --> 02:48:42.460
Or I think it's called SharePlay.

02:48:42.460 --> 02:48:46.380
Remember where you one person would have the cart and then everybody else can beam the

02:48:46.380 --> 02:48:47.340
game to their thing?

02:48:48.380 --> 02:48:50.460
That is going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

02:48:50.460 --> 02:48:51.900
Sorry to those that didn't get through.

02:48:51.900 --> 02:48:55.580
But if you want to give us an email, that would be awesome.

02:48:55.580 --> 02:48:57.580
Participate at orangelauntrader.com.

02:48:57.580 --> 02:49:02.940
By the way, Bobby Blackwolf in chat brought a receipt from one of these tech sites saying

02:49:02.940 --> 02:49:05.100
that, wait, I reread it.

02:49:05.100 --> 02:49:06.700
The Switch has Bluetooth.

02:49:06.700 --> 02:49:08.540
Bluetooth 4.1.

02:49:08.540 --> 02:49:10.220
So it does have Bluetooth in it.

02:49:10.220 --> 02:49:13.260
So, but again, because that's what the controllers use.

02:49:13.260 --> 02:49:13.660
Right.

02:49:13.660 --> 02:49:17.260
But and I also, I kind of think you're right, though, about the GPS thing is it would be

02:49:17.260 --> 02:49:18.300
a very easy thing to spoof.

02:49:18.300 --> 02:49:21.980
And, you know, at the end of the day, why put Pokemon Go on the Switch?

02:49:21.980 --> 02:49:23.580
Like, it doesn't make a lot of sense.

02:49:23.660 --> 02:49:29.500
But maybe a new Pokemon game that interacts with or excuse me, a new Pokemon game in the

02:49:29.500 --> 02:49:32.620
sun and moon variety that interacts with Go.

02:49:33.260 --> 02:49:36.140
I could see maybe a little more of that, but we'll we'll see.

02:49:36.140 --> 02:49:37.340
We'll see what happens.

02:49:37.340 --> 02:49:42.300
Have they even discussed the connectivity between Go and sun and moon already?

02:49:42.300 --> 02:49:45.340
No, they kind of that's going to be a thing.

02:49:45.340 --> 02:49:46.540
They shove that under the rug.

02:49:47.500 --> 02:49:48.620
No, it's not.

02:49:48.620 --> 02:49:51.740
I think I think Niantic just had too much problems.

02:49:51.740 --> 02:49:55.180
They still have yet to do a live event, which is important to point out as well.

02:49:55.180 --> 02:49:57.980
You know, we still have legendaries from Gen 1 that haven't come out.

02:49:57.980 --> 02:50:01.340
And now we're on the eve of Gen 2 Pokemon hitting.

02:50:01.340 --> 02:50:06.220
I mean, Gen 2 Pokemon are hitting, but there's a lot more that are still coming out soon.

02:50:06.220 --> 02:50:09.580
A lot of people theorize we could get some developments this next week.

02:50:09.580 --> 02:50:11.260
I kind of think they're grasping at straws.

02:50:11.260 --> 02:50:13.900
I think Niantic is just going to dump that on us when they're getting ready.

02:50:13.900 --> 02:50:14.940
But we'll see.

02:50:14.940 --> 02:50:16.380
I don't want them to rush it.

02:50:16.380 --> 02:50:17.340
Don't screw it up.

02:50:17.340 --> 02:50:21.420
Anyway, that is going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:50:21.420 --> 02:50:25.180
Thank you guys for joining us again, especially after we were gone for a little bit,

02:50:25.180 --> 02:50:26.460
especially being two weeks off.

02:50:26.460 --> 02:50:27.500
Thank you for being here.

02:50:27.500 --> 02:50:29.260
If you were here live, awesome.

02:50:29.260 --> 02:50:30.220
Great to have you here.

02:50:30.220 --> 02:50:32.940
If you're listening on the podcast feed, appreciate that too.

02:50:32.940 --> 02:50:33.980
Or however you're listening.

02:50:33.980 --> 02:50:34.940
Maybe you torrented it.

02:50:34.940 --> 02:50:35.820
I don't know.

02:50:35.820 --> 02:50:40.620
But we always appreciate a five-star review on a place like iTunes, Google Play or wherever

02:50:40.620 --> 02:50:41.980
it is you found this podcast.

02:50:41.980 --> 02:50:43.660
Those reviews do go a long way.

02:50:43.660 --> 02:50:47.420
Word of mouth is really all we have to sell this show because we don't have a giant

02:50:48.300 --> 02:50:51.260
multimillion dollar website or advertising network behind us.

02:50:51.260 --> 02:50:52.140
All we have is word of mouth.

02:50:52.140 --> 02:50:55.100
So if you like what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, please tell a friend or two

02:50:55.100 --> 02:50:55.580

02:50:55.580 --> 02:50:58.540
And even if you didn't like what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, hey, at least

02:50:58.540 --> 02:50:59.980
support independent podcasting.

02:50:59.980 --> 02:51:04.300
Continue to support folks who create this content for you.

02:51:05.100 --> 02:51:06.140
And again, email us.

Participate at orangelandradio.com.

02:51:08.380 --> 02:51:10.860
We're going to go around and get everybody's final thought.

02:51:10.860 --> 02:51:13.260
Since I see Dark Sakura packing up, I'll start with her.

02:51:13.260 --> 02:51:15.820
Dark Sakura, your final thought for tonight.

02:51:16.060 --> 02:51:16.540
Resist.

02:51:18.060 --> 02:51:19.820
Uh, resist false icons.

02:51:22.540 --> 02:51:23.100
All right.

02:51:23.100 --> 02:51:23.660
Enlighten.

02:51:23.660 --> 02:51:25.180
I'm making a statement.

02:51:25.180 --> 02:51:25.740
Resist.

02:51:26.620 --> 02:51:27.900
Loki, your final thought tonight.

02:51:28.620 --> 02:51:31.260
I don't know if I'm gonna keep the switch because if I don't keep the switch, then I

02:51:31.260 --> 02:51:33.020
can buy myself a 3D printer.

02:51:33.020 --> 02:51:36.060
So that's exciting.

02:51:36.860 --> 02:51:37.580
One or the other.

02:51:38.220 --> 02:51:38.620
We'll see.

02:51:38.620 --> 02:51:39.100
I don't know.

02:51:39.100 --> 02:51:43.340
I'm leaving it on, especially right now, because there's also the opportunity of scalping

02:51:43.340 --> 02:51:46.860
that shit, but, um, I don't know.

02:51:46.860 --> 02:51:50.620
I may just be lazy and leave it on there and like, oh, hey, what's this in my doorstep?

02:51:50.620 --> 02:51:51.020
Oh yeah.

02:51:51.020 --> 02:51:51.340
Fit.

02:51:51.340 --> 02:51:51.500
Shit.

02:51:51.500 --> 02:51:53.020
I forgot that was coming out, you know?

02:51:54.060 --> 02:51:54.460
I don't know.

02:51:55.420 --> 02:51:55.740
All right.

02:51:56.380 --> 02:52:01.340
My final thought this week is, um, you know, yay for a three day weekend, but let's not

02:52:01.340 --> 02:52:02.940
forget why we have a three day weekend.

02:52:02.940 --> 02:52:03.500
Not for me.

02:52:03.500 --> 02:52:04.220
Sorry.

02:52:04.220 --> 02:52:05.100
My final thought.

02:52:06.620 --> 02:52:12.060
So I just want to, you know, say, acknowledge that tomorrow is Martin Luther King Day and,

02:52:12.540 --> 02:52:15.100
you know, take a minute to reflect on his message.

02:52:15.820 --> 02:52:18.540
Especially since this is going to be a very interesting week.

02:52:19.100 --> 02:52:24.220
And for me personally, even all the national stuff aside, it's going to be a very interesting

02:52:24.220 --> 02:52:28.060
week and I'm very excited, dare I say.

02:52:28.060 --> 02:52:31.340
So anyhow, that's it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:52:31.340 --> 02:52:33.340
Thank you guys so much for tuning into the show.

02:52:33.340 --> 02:52:34.140

02:52:35.100 --> 02:52:37.260
We will see you in seven days.

02:52:37.260 --> 02:52:37.500
