00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,120
This week, the internet speculates that Nintendo copied the copiers by selling ROMs downloaded

2
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,080
from the internet for its Virtual Console games.

3
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,960
But if owning a game means you can download a ROM, doesn't that also extend to the rights

4
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:23,960
holder?

5
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,680
And that's just one of many stories coming up right now on the show, where every gamer

6
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,680
has a voice.

7
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,600
Orange Lounge Radio

8
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,920
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

9
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,600
where every gamer has a voice.

10
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,280
Live tonight, episode number 673 for this January the 22nd of 2017.

12
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,640
My name is Rob Roberts, joining you in lovely Studio N7 in Sacramento, California.

13
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,880
Not joining us tonight unfortunately, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

14
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:59,000
She has a little bit of a sinus infection type thing and it also is kind of stormy outside,

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,640
like thunder, lightning, the whole works.

16
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,320
So she didn't feel up to the trip out here tonight because it does take her a good 20-30

17
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,320
minutes to get over here.

18
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,800
So she will, however, call us later in the show to do her regular segment, the classic

19
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,000
system of the month this week.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So we'll check in with her at that time.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,120
But we do have in studio, as he is every week, say hello to Tech Master Loki.

22
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,360
Now is the classic system of the month...

23
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,360
Oh, you're not...

24
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,800
A classic Loki with no mic on.

25
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,320
Did I not unmute it?

26
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,320
How did I do that?

27
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,320
Try again, Loki.

28
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,000
I did not unmute me.

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,640
Live radio, the joys and tribulations.

30
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,960
Anyways, as I was going to say, is the classic system of the week going to be the Nintendo

31
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,040
serial system?

32
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,040
I don't know.

33
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,040
I don't...

34
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,520
I think I'm safe to say it's not tonight because I may be privy to insider information on what

35
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,160
she's picked in advance.

36
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:53,760
It is not the Nintendo serial system, but she may pick that in a future month.

37
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,360
It is for breakfast now.

38
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,360
It's a serial.

39
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,360
Wow.

40
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,360
How are you, Loki?

41
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,360
I'm fine.

42
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,360
Yeah?

43
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,360
I have a pizza meeting.

44
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,360
Yeah.

45
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,360
And that's always a good thing.

46
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,080
It's funny because Loki brought in a pizza to the studio tonight and I was saying, oh,

47
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:09,800
Alan and I were actually thinking about ordering pizza because we're kind of lazy right now

48
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,800
tonight.

49
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,520
And you know, it's that whole situation where you're kind of like out of food.

50
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:20,920
So you're like, I don't really want to go grocery shopping today, especially when it's

51
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,920
stormy.

52
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,160
Can I get through one more night with just a pizza?

53
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,160
All right.

54
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:31,440
Us here in studio, but you guys, of course, as always, in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com

55
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,760
where we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern,

56
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,320
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

57
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,920
Like I said, it is stormy outside tonight, a little bit of rainy.

58
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,560
So if you were going to bootleg the show any week, I would encourage you to do it tonight.

59
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,800
In fact, I think Tiger Claw is on standby just in case we have a power outage or something

60
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,800
like that.

61
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,180
However, Flock O' Jones isn't here, so that should be good as far as the power outage

62
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,180
is concerned.

63
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,180
Yes.

64
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,180
All right.

65
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,180
Anyway.

66
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:07,440
So there are some folks in chat over at live.vognetwork.com that are talking about something I haven't

67
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,680
talked about on the show tonight and I didn't talk about in the show in advance, but so

68
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,280
y'all may have heard on Twitter and throughout the interwebs this week, I got married on

69
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,280
Thursday.

70
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,280
Yep.

71
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:26,320
Alan and I made it official and we went down and had a good old courthouse wedding on Thursday.

72
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:30,400
As some people have phrased it, which I guess we have too, we eloped, although that's a

73
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,400
weird...

74
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:37,560
Usually when you say you elope, you're eloping because maybe like your parents disapprove

75
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,080
or something like that, or you're trying to get away from something, I don't know, I guess

76
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,680
every situation is different, but elope feels weird to me because the only people that we

77
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,820
actually invited to the ceremony were my parents.

78
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,400
And that was because we had to have a witness of some sort.

79
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,440
So I was like, all right, we're going to invite my parents.

80
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,660
Alan's mother passed away many years ago.

81
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:04,840
So we had them there, but we didn't tell any friends or any other family.

82
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,840
He didn't tell his brothers.

83
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,160
I didn't tell my sister.

84
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,640
We didn't tell really anybody else until it was done.

85
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,240
I think part of that was because, well, I guess if we eloped from anybody, we eloped

86
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:20,160
from the government because the whole thing was planned.

87
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,280
You guys know I don't like to get too political on this show and I'm just going to just tell

88
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,600
you the facts and how it is.

89
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,680
We made a decision the day after the election that we would get married the day before the

90
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:36,880
inauguration as it is our belief and wouldn't it be lovely if we get proved wrong, but it

91
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:42,400
is our belief that there's some in this incoming administration, especially the vice president,

92
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:49,380
that would try to take this right away of same sex marriage if they're given the choice.

93
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:55,720
And also you have to consider that Prop 8 was passed in California and Prop 8 technically

94
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,800
is still the law in California, which sucks.

95
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:06,000
And I think if that were to go again, I feel like having been doing this show, having talked

96
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,960
to many people out there, having seen people in my own life kind of come full circle in

97
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,280
the past eight years, which we kind of saw with our last president, right?

98
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:20,440
A lot of the reason why Prop 8 passed in the first place, some claim, is because our last

99
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:24,760
president, President Barack Obama, was on record on a recording saying, I believe marriage

100
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,440
should be between a man and a woman.

101
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,920
Well, in those eight years, he certainly evolved and I think was probably the best champion

102
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:36,080
of LGBT plus rights that we've ever had in the Oval Office.

103
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,080
So that part's awesome.

104
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,320
And I think a lot of people kind of came around with him.

105
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:44,600
So I think if Prop 8 were to happen again, it would be very different, which is great.

106
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,000
That type of aggression is awesome.

107
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,160
But the reality is, if the Supreme Court were to strike it down, Prop 8 is still going to

108
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,160
be the law.

109
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,640
So you know what?

110
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,640
So it's one of those things.

111
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:59,640
And I realize y'all have your own opinions, I'm sure, although the relationship between

112
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:05,000
Alan and I is not really your concern at the end of the day.

113
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,240
But we said, you know what?

114
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,240
This is what we want to do.

115
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,360
This is a symbolic thing.

116
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,520
We're going to get married and do it here.

117
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,600
And that's it.

118
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,440
And a lot of people have been asking me in the past couple days, does it feel different

119
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,440
now that you're married?

120
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,480
And my honest answer is, not really.

121
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,880
Alan and I have been living together for the past five years anyway.

122
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,560
So maybe there'll be more of those subtle changes later on, especially when we file

123
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,560
our taxes next year and things like that.

124
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,280
The reason why I say it that way, and I can kind of laugh about it, is because honestly,

125
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:40,040
this was just a logical next step progression in our relationship that we've both known

126
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,880
has been coming for a very long time.

127
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,720
And so it was one of those things where we're just going to do it right now.

128
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,720
So there it is.

129
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:52,920
So I'm married to Alan, and that happened just days ago.

130
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:58,180
Loki, let me ask you, because I get this question a lot.

131
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,780
Did marriage change things for you?

132
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:03,220
Because you and Nellie were together a while before you guys tied the knot, right?

133
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,940
And what has, have things changed for the two of you?

134
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:09,300
You just can't leave anymore.

135
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,300
I don't know if that's true.

136
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,300
I don't know if that's true.

137
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,300
All right.

138
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,300
Let's see.

139
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,420
Go into our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

140
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,420
Thank you.

141
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,620
I see a lot of people saying congratulations and I really appreciate that.

142
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:21,620
Thank you guys so much.

143
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,620
Let's see.

144
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:27,380
JD says, I call mine an elopement, courthouse wedding, no witnesses, et cetera.

145
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,140
We did have a witness and it was a family member.

146
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,140
So I think, I don't know.

147
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,140
I don't know.

148
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,140
Does that still apply?

149
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,140
I don't know.

150
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:36,340
I think I'm thinking too much about terms where I don't need to be.

151
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,340
Let's see.

152
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,740
SSG100Matt says, it's too bad you didn't do it earlier.

153
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:43,140
I think you could have gotten a signed letter from Obama congratulating you.

154
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:46,980
I didn't, I didn't even know that was a thing you could do.

155
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,900
Well, Obama's just a private citizen now.

156
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,900
Do you think if I sent him a letter and asked very nicely, I could still get something?

157
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:53,900
Maybe?

158
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,060
I don't know.

159
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:57,580
It's not really, it's not a high priority for us.

160
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,580
It's fine.

161
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,580
Let's see.

162
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:04,420
And SSG100Matt says, we may all have differences, but we can all agree that we're all happy

163
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,840
for you and Alan.

164
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,180
That's very sweet of you to say, and that's honestly some of the best wishes I could look

165
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,180
for.

166
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,180
Thank you very much.

167
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,380
I really, really appreciate that.

168
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,660
So there you go.

169
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:19,180
Yes, I know it's a gaming show you guys, but in a three hour show, sometimes you get the

170
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:23,340
updates on our personal lives and that was a pretty big one for me.

171
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,460
So there you have it.

172
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:27,580
And you know, Alan, you guys know him because he pops on the show every now and again.

173
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,580
He might pop on tonight.

174
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,580
We'll see.

175
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:34,480
But, you know, part of the reason why Alan and I click so well is because he's a big

176
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:38,680
fucking nerd like I am and he plays a lot of video games, although he's more a computer

177
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,680
gamer guy.

178
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,180
I think in the whole times we've lived together, I don't see him pick up a console game very

179
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:48,700
often at all unless we're doing like Jackbox Party Pack.

180
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,940
Like I think that's the console game I can sometimes, he'll watch me play.

181
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:57,700
I was playing World of Final Fantasy in the past week and he'll come in, watch me play

182
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,700
the game.

183
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:01,780
He'll ask a few questions about it and then he'll kind of make fun of it, which World

184
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:05,060
of Final Fantasy kind of lends itself very well to be made fun of because there's like

185
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:10,860
so many anime tropes in that game and it's really like over the top ridiculous in some

186
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:11,860
parts.

187
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:17,040
So he'll be like, you know, oh, are you playing Chibi Final Fantasy Desu Desu World of Chibi

188
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,040
Fart?

189
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,860
You know, like just make up something on the spot there.

190
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,980
So we bond a lot over games.

191
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:28,980
Like a game that Alan plays a lot of, in fact he's probably playing it right now if he's

192
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,340
listening to the show in the other room, I know he was playing it before the show, is

193
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,340
Overwatch.

194
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:39,700
He plays like, he's level, he just hit I think level 231 or something like that on PC.

195
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,020
And that's a lot of Overwatch time, right?

196
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,820
And I like Overwatch.

197
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:47,660
I do think Overwatch was like the best video game that was released last year in a lot

198
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:54,260
of ways, but like I probably wouldn't play Overwatch as much as I do if Alan didn't kind

199
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,140
of like motivate me to do that.

200
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:58,940
So it's like something we kind of do together.

201
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:02,940
And as much as it can be frustrating sometimes that we'll get matched with really good players

202
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:07,580
because of his skill rating as opposed to mine, like I do feel like I've learned a lot

203
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:11,500
more about the game and I have gotten better playing games with him.

204
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,340
So there's that.

205
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,340
All right.

206
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:18,700
I'll stop being sweet and over the top and all that stuff.

207
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:22,700
SCO and Hunter Matt in chat wants to offer different congratulations here.

208
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,100
SCO and Hunter Matt says, congrats Bobby.

209
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,380
His team is going to the Superb Owl.

210
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:29,100
That's right.

211
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,100
That is absolutely right.

212
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:35,260
Bobby did not do a live show tonight because you guys all know he does, he has this other

213
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:40,380
gig that he does that involves a football team in his area and said football team is

214
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,820
now going to be going to the Super Bowl.

215
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:45,620
So I actually, I have to check my Facebook because I actually asked him, does this mean

216
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:48,240
you get to play at the Lady Gaga concert in two weeks?

217
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,140
I don't, cause I don't know if they get to go to the Super Bowl or any of that stuff.

218
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,140
So we'll see.

219
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,140
We will find out.

220
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:57,380
I'm sure he will update you all on his show next week.

221
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,380
Let's see.

222
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:02,620
SCO and Hunter Matt says, I saw you bought Overwatch on console recently, Rob.

223
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,500
Yes, that is true.

224
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,820
It wasn't actually that recent though.

225
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:10,140
I bought it during a sale, I think Black Friday or something like that.

226
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:13,900
Vidpower says, wow, that's two Overwatch prestigious.

227
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:14,900
Yep.

228
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:18,540
He plays a lot of Overwatch.

229
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:21,540
ActDeaf says, drunk BlackWolf to call OLR.

230
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:25,900
Maybe, I'm sure he's in a very celebratory mood, but I don't think BlackWolf will be

231
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:26,900
calling tonight.

232
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,240
He's probably really tired from the day.

233
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,700
But you know who is calling in tonight?

234
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,460
We have an interview coming up in about 15 minutes.

235
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:37,200
We're going to be talking with a buddy of mine that's done, he's done a lot of great

236
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,200
like articles.

237
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,000
It's a neat tie-in tonight, and when he was willing to come on the show tonight, knowing

238
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,080
in the back of my mind that, oh, I'm going to announce a gay wedding on air this week,

239
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,560
I thought, oh, this is going to be the perfect guest for the show this week.

240
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,160
It's my pal Matt, Loki, aren't you excited?

241
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:59,240
It's my pal Matt, Matt Baum is going to be on the show, and he hosts several podcasts.

242
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:06,320
He did a lot of writing and YouTubes especially and articles about the marriage debate and

243
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,320
all that when that was going on leading up to the Supreme Court ruling, and he still

244
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,840
does a lot of that stuff, you know, just with those types of issues and what's going on

245
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,000
in the LGBT plus community.

246
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,940
But namely on tonight's show, we're going to talk to him about a project that he's doing

247
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:24,560
that has a lot to do with video games, and I really like issues like this are really

248
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,700
near and dear to my heart because I see myself in a lot of this, but the project he's going

249
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:35,300
to talk to us about tonight is called Playing with Pride, and it's about LGBT plus gamers

250
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:39,500
and a lot of what that community goes through.

251
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:45,520
And you know, a lot of times, when you see an article or a tweet or something from something

252
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:52,580
about like gamer X, usually one of the responses in there is, why do we need a gay convention?

253
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:55,100
When do we get a straight gaming convention?

254
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,100
Where's that?

255
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,900
You know, where's my straight pride parade and all that stuff?

256
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:02,780
And I think the cool thing about this project is that I think Matt's really trying to show

257
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:05,900
like, why, and answer that question.

258
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:08,500
So even though you might be sitting there thinking, well, I'm not gay, am I going to

259
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,380
be interested in this?

260
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:13,940
I think this is a really good chance for you to see something from the other side.

261
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:18,320
So anyway, I will stop talking about it and let Matt elaborate on that in about 15 minutes

262
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,780
when he joins us live.

263
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:22,660
But I do want to get into some gaming news right off the top of the show.

264
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,900
I want to talk about the switch.

265
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:29,860
And obviously, we had a very passionate, lively discussion about some of the things that are

266
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:33,740
everything that was announced with the switch last week at the initial press conference

267
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,900
and all that.

268
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:39,660
But in the last seven days, a lot more has come to light, right?

269
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:43,540
We've seen there's more games that are getting confirmed for the switch, right, especially

270
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,720
the indie department.

271
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,260
We saw what we saw that screenshot with cave story and 1000 to one spikes, right?

272
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,500
We saw, you know that.

273
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:56,840
But one thing that caught my eye was that it's also come out from some interviews and

274
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:01,480
some talking that there's not going to be a lot of media software out on the switch.

275
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,800
And that's a very vague way they say not a lot of media software.

276
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:09,120
Well, does that mean there's going to be like one software or there's just straight up no

277
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,160
software?

278
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,680
And the impression I'm getting is don't expect Netflix on this thing, right?

279
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:17,840
That yeah, that's incredibly dumb at this time.

280
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:22,280
You know, and it's, it's interesting reading like the tweets that I'm getting, and I'm

281
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:26,480
sure our chat room now and I turn around and look, a lot of the tweets that I'm seeing

282
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:32,240
out there are about like, you know, well, I don't need Netflix on the switch because

283
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,200
I have 500 other devices that all have Netflix on it.

284
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,560
And I get that.

285
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:43,520
But at the same time, I can't help but go, well, okay, wait, a couple things.

286
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:47,580
Hey, Nintendo's trying to make this argument that this is a new home console.

287
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:52,260
And isn't even though I in my heart of hearts believe this system is five times better when

288
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:55,680
you view it as a new handheld console that just happens to get more powerful when you're

289
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,640
at home, but I digress.

290
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:05,720
Isn't it kind of standard for home consoles to be living room central hubs that have things

291
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,840
like Netflix in them?

292
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:12,200
True, but you have to look at it the other way that it's not Nintendo not putting it

293
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,200
on their console.

294
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:17,360
It's Netflix not developing for that console.

295
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,600
So why aren't they doing it?

296
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,600
That's a good question.

297
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,080
Is it because they feel that, you know, it's obviously powerful enough to run it because,

298
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:31,540
you know, hell, a stupid tablet can run that.

299
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:34,440
Could be that they just didn't give the dev kids out to them in time.

300
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,920
It could be like a whole bunch of stuff.

301
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:43,440
I just think the more I hear about their system, the less like I have a preorder.

302
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,360
I'm probably not going to have a preorder by the time it comes out.

303
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,500
It's still in my possession right now.

304
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:53,980
But there's not, it's hardly anything convincing me to buy one right now.

305
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:56,460
Don't cancel it until you're sure, because it'll be hard to get it back once you do.

306
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,460
I don't care, honestly.

307
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,460
I'm just saying.

308
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:03,680
I mean, there's one game that's coming out, Zelda, which I can get on the Wii U anyways,

309
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,580
which by the way, they talked about what the differences are between the two systems.

310
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:10,820
It's like not really anything.

311
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,700
I mean, so why?

312
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:16,740
Going back to Netflix for a minute, here's the thing for me, because even though as much

313
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:22,180
as I try to look at both sides of everything that's going on in gaming, I try to be fair,

314
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:26,660
and I think I've given Nintendo a pretty fair shot on this show, and I have not canceled

315
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,260
either of my preorders yet.

316
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,620
Yes, I still have two.

317
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:36,580
But I do think this whole no Netflix thing is, I don't like it.

318
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:40,500
And I know a lot of you disagree with me, and that's fine, but it just seems like a

319
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,580
real missed opportunity.

320
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:47,260
That's what kind of worries me about it, is that it's a real missed opportunity for Nintendo,

321
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:51,620
especially on a thing like the Switch, where it's like, okay, let's say you're watching

322
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:56,380
Netflix on the TV or something, and then, oh, somebody wants to come in and take over

323
00:16:56,380 --> 00:17:02,180
the TV for something else, like news or whatever's going on, then snap, you can take that Switch

324
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:06,700
out and continue to watch yourself on the couch with some headphones.

325
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,580
Didn't they show that for the Wii U?

326
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:11,700
I could swear when they were plugging the Wii U, they showed that, right?

327
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:16,820
Yes, it was the whole TV thing where you could, you know, you could take that and, you know,

328
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:21,020
someone could watch TV on there, and you can watch your whatever.

329
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:23,660
So that's what's bothering me about it, you guys.

330
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:26,740
That's what's bothering me about it, is that it feels like it's a feature that was on the

331
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:30,180
Wii U that's removed on the Switch.

332
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,180
That's where it's weird.

333
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:38,180
And on top of that, like, YouTube, like, hell, my son uses the Wii U tablet for Minecraft,

334
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,180
and mainly YouTube.

335
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:43,260
And you've talked about, too, for even yourself, as much as, you know, you give Nintendo shit

336
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:47,620
on the show sometimes, you love this thing for when your wife wants to commandeer the

337
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:53,220
TV for Grey's Anatomy, you will use the Wii U gamepad to do stuff, right?

338
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:58,940
Not so much anymore, now that I have the PlayStation VR, because I'll just play PlayStation 4 games

339
00:17:58,940 --> 00:17:59,940
on that.

340
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:00,940
Okay, but you have.

341
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:04,940
But if I had a tablet for the PlayStation, yeah, I'd be down with that, but I mean, at

342
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:08,700
one time, yeah, I was, when I was playing more, like, Wii U games, and hell, when Zelda

343
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:14,500
comes out, that might be the case, but yeah, it's nice to be able to do that.

344
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:19,980
It's just, I don't think, their whole, like, online portion doesn't seem fleshed out at

345
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:20,980
all.

346
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,740
That's why it's not coming out right away, because it's not ready yet.

347
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:28,060
There's nothing, they have no details on anything, they don't know how much it's going to cost,

348
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:31,020
they don't know what features are going to be in it.

349
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:34,900
That's not good for a console that's coming out in less than six weeks.

350
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:38,140
You don't have any idea what your online infrastructure is going to be?

351
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:39,140
Come on!

352
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:42,740
And I do want to give credit to these comments in chat right now.

353
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:47,060
ActDeft over at live.vognetwork.com says, Netflix will be on the Switch, just give it

354
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,060
time.

355
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:51,220
VidPower says, Nintendo said it won't be available on launch, which means it may come

356
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,220
in the future.

357
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:56,700
And those are both valid and good points, but it still can't help you but feel like,

358
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:01,520
wow, it feels like what we're getting in March is the beta release, and everything is going

359
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,740
to be building up for holiday, which is when the console is really going to launch.

360
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:10,380
And for all practical purposes, that may be exactly Nintendo's plan.

361
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,380
And I think it is Nintendo's plan.

362
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:14,620
I think they're going to get another, it's going to pull another 3DS is what's going

363
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,620
to happen with this system.

364
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:20,820
They're going to launch it unprepared, it's not going to do great, it'll do fine because

365
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:24,420
they've sold out of pre-orders, but it's not going to, you know, they're not going to sell

366
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:28,240
a ton beyond that because there's not a lot of software out there.

367
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,940
And how long, I mean, can Zelda really sustain your console?

368
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:36,140
I mean, look at all the games coming out for that.

369
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:39,060
So the other thing is kind of like, I sit back and I'm like, you know, all these games

370
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:42,860
are coming out for all of these are ports of really old games.

371
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:47,340
Like Mario Kart 8 is a great game, but once again, it's just being re-released with just

372
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:53,180
a fraction of a bit extra content that honestly should have been there in the first place.

373
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:57,140
Here's the thing, the Mario Kart 8 thing where you and I totally differ on this is that I'm

374
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:01,780
looking ahead to the next nerd convention when everybody brings their Switch and we're

375
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:07,100
all going to be sitting around playing Mario Kart 8 on our individual TV screens, kind

376
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:10,780
of doing something in the same room that, like, it's an experience you can't really

377
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,220
get on Wii U right now.

378
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,220
You know what I mean?

379
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:16,620
Like, that's what I'm really looking forward to in Mario Kart 8, for me personally.

380
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:19,580
And I think Splatoon is going to be a lot of the same thing as well.

381
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:24,180
And that could bode very well for other future Nintendo games because obviously Nintendo's

382
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,700
the party system, right?

383
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:28,860
Mario Party on the Switch is going to be lit.

384
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,020
But that's the problem though.

385
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,020
That's the problem.

386
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:37,140
That's the party system and that's, I don't party with people with my, you know, Wii or

387
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,140
Wii U or whatever.

388
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:40,260
Why don't you want to party, Loki?

389
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,860
Come on, Loki, let's party.

390
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:44,340
That's just making quite the assumption.

391
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:51,060
But still, even on top of that though, you're basically putting out, like, the game that

392
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:55,100
was out just recently for that $60 price point still.

393
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,660
And what am I really in with that?

394
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,660
Oh, the additional tracks?

395
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,660
Big deal.

396
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:03,420
And why don't you just patch that shit into the Wii U version?

397
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:08,420
Oh, I'm sorry, the Wii U can't handle traditional battle mode in fucking Mario Kart 8?

398
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,660
That's ridiculous.

399
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:13,740
Only about 10% of our audience, give or take, is going to understand this joke, but I just

400
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:18,900
think that Nintendo is really on a missed opportunity here to market the Switch as the

401
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,860
official party and play system.

402
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:23,260
And they're just not doing it.

403
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,260
Well, who knows?

404
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,820
Again, maybe for the holiday.

405
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:31,740
Maybe the whole thing is, get the early adopters in March so we have some good figures to push

406
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:37,980
out for our financials so we don't lose further stock faith or whatever, and then really we're

407
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:41,740
going to push this during the holiday with a bundle with 1-2 Switch because that game

408
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,060
ain't going to sell on its own.

409
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:46,740
Yeah, I don't think the third party support's there though.

410
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,900
We've been seeing stuff, but what's EA got?

411
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,420
EA's got FIFA.

412
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:54,780
There's no Madden on there, which is a big deal.

413
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:55,780
There's no-

414
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:58,220
But FIFA's there though, which is bigger than Madden.

415
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:00,700
Yeah, but you know why FIFA's there?

416
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:05,980
Because not until up to a couple years ago did they still stop- they basically are still

417
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:15,340
producing the PlayStation 2 and the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 versions of those games because

418
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:22,140
other parts of the world don't have a lot of market saturation for the newer consoles.

419
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,660
That's not true for Madden.

420
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:26,300
That's not true for NHL.

421
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:33,900
That is true still for NBA 2K I believe, but it's just- and even with that though, those

422
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:39,780
engines are still running on versions of the game that were several years old.

423
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:43,780
Pro Evo was doing that for a while with Konami, and all they were doing was roster updates,

424
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:46,380
running on the same engine as late from 2012.

425
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:55,140
So the thing is, they're providing support for the system, but very shitty-ass support

426
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,140
for it.

427
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:59,900
And even Ubisoft, what are they really bringing to the system?

428
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:02,460
Shit that came out already, they're just porting over to it.

429
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,540
Like Rayman?

430
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:07,140
They're not developing a new Rayman game, it's just a fucking game that came out- what,

431
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,140
the Wii U launch?

432
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:13,300
I mean, come on, this is piss poor support from third parties.

433
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:16,900
The ports of years old games is concerning.

434
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:22,020
I think indies can get away with it a little more than some of the big boys, but you guys

435
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:27,180
know how I felt about the Skyrim thing, but to be fair, there are others who strongly

436
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:31,100
feel that Skyrim being a portable presence is going to be a huge asset.

437
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:35,220
But I want to see how that thing runs, because the thing I'm worried about is, first off,

438
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:38,460
it's not going to be the new- I don't think it's going to be the remastered Skyrim.

439
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:43,020
I think it could be just a port of the Xbox 360 PlayStation 3 version.

440
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:47,980
I mean, which would be okay, I guess, but there's just- at this point, I mean, that

441
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:53,540
sounds cool, but I even thought about it, like, why would I drop $400 for the system

442
00:23:53,540 --> 00:24:00,140
in the game when I could just upgrade or buy a new laptop that can run Skyrim on the go

443
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,140
anyways?

444
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:05,780
And that's kind of what I'd be doing, because wherever I go, I bring my laptop, and if I'm

445
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:10,180
going to be playing games on the Switch, it's going to be at my desk at work, and I could

446
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:16,220
just easily pop out a laptop and play with an Xbox 360 controller, so why should I drop

447
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:17,300
it for that?

448
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:23,300
I mean, the Mario game looks alright, but I didn't buy the Mario game on the Wii U.

449
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,180
Let me go to chat for some more chat comments.

450
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:30,120
Barb over in chat, my favorite character in Stranger Things, says, everyone single take

451
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:33,220
a shot every time Rob makes a sex reference.

452
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:35,420
I hope you all aren't driving anywhere tonight.

453
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:39,540
Let's see, Dungeon Buster says, the lack of games I'm interested in is concerning.

454
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:43,820
I have a feeling that after Breath of the Wild, the Switch will just sit there while

455
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:47,860
Steam and PS4 fill the gaps for, well, everything else.

456
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:49,820
I disagree-ish.

457
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,220
I kind of get the concern there.

458
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:55,420
I definitely think Nintendo is trying to do this whole initial launch, and then you will

459
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:58,220
definitely see something for Holiday and Mario and all that.

460
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:02,780
But I do feel like, unlike the Wii U, they are trying to do at least something every

461
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:05,140
month to kind of keep it going.

462
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:07,180
April is Mario Kart, right?

463
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:09,020
Arms will probably be May.

464
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:13,540
Splatoon 2 is going to be June, and I honestly don't know what's beyond that.

465
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:17,220
Maybe June is E3 and we can get more announcements and so forth, but I do feel like they're trying

466
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:21,780
to pepper out some of these other releases to kind of sustain the year, if that makes

467
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:22,780
sense.

468
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:26,180
This is one little difference I see there than what we saw at Wii U, but this is a different

469
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,220
type of launch, too.

470
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:29,100
It's going to be launching in March, not November.

471
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,740
Still, that's just like the Wii U.

472
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:33,220
That's exactly like the Wii U.

473
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:38,980
Lack of third-party support, one major title coming out from Nintendo every month or so

474
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:46,060
and that's fine that Nintendo puts out decent games, but is first-party going to be enough

475
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:48,420
to drive people wanting this system?

476
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:54,780
And I, you know, I was on board with the Wii, I bought a ton of stuff for it, you know,

477
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:56,640
I played it for a while and then I didn't.

478
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,540
I didn't play it for a while because, you know, most of the stuff that came out later

479
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:04,940
on was multi-platform stuff and it's like, well shit, it's just way better on other systems.

480
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:09,460
The Wii U, you know, I bought a lot of stuff digital because, you know, mainly because

481
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:10,460
my son wanted to play stuff.

482
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:16,540
I bought Splatoon, never got into it, so Splatoon 2, I don't give a shit about that.

483
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:19,460
Mario Maker's pretty fun, but that's not on the new system.

484
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,460
Yet.

485
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,460
Yet.

486
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:25,020
Well, goodie, I'm not going to wait until 2018 to play a game that I have right now.

487
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:27,700
Let me get a couple more comments here because I want to make sure we get to our interview.

488
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:31,780
RPGfan says, I hear you, Loki, I'm a single player, Nintendo doesn't have much for me

489
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:34,860
beyond Zelda these days.

490
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:37,780
What about Xenoblade?

491
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,340
I never got into Xenoblade.

492
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:41,140
I think it's kind of cool.

493
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:45,040
Let's see, what was the other thing I wanted to say about the whole, I don't remember the

494
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,740
comment that put this out here.

495
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:51,260
I think maybe it was Darth Tetsuya saying, is Netflix, Hulu really that much of a deal

496
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,260
breaker?

497
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:56,660
Here's the last thing I want to say on Netflix that's weird to me, okay, is that Netflix

498
00:26:56,660 --> 00:27:00,340
recently introduced this thing where you can actually download movies and watch them on

499
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,340
the go.

500
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:04,500
I think somebody in chat was saying something about, does anybody watch Netflix on portable

501
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,540
devices?

502
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:11,780
Yes, when I was flying to and from MAGFest, since DC is a long flight, I was watching

503
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:13,420
Netflix on my phone.

504
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:18,060
I downloaded a movie called Hurricane Bianca, which if you all watch Drag Race, you know

505
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,300
what that is.

506
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:22,980
I downloaded that movie and I was able to actually watch it on the flight.

507
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:26,580
That's something kind of new for Netflix that the Switch could really benefit from, is that

508
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:31,340
okay, so obviously this handheld Switch thing doesn't have a cell signal so you're not going

509
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:38,620
to be able to use Netflix unless you're on Wi-Fi, but you could download movies and then

510
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:43,020
when you start them, or like you start them on the TV and it's downloading to the Switch,

511
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,860
so that way if you have to pick up the Switch and go somewhere, the rest of the movie is

512
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:46,860
there.

513
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:50,660
And yes, I know there's probably a lot of concerns with the whole internal storage,

514
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:52,140
but those movies are not that big.

515
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:58,380
I think that whole Hurricane Bianca was like maybe 350 megs, which isn't a lot, and we

516
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,060
know the Switch is expandable, yada yada yada.

517
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:07,340
And it's only 720p, so I mean it's not like you're downloading a much larger video file.

518
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:11,620
It's not that like, what I want to say is it's not that it's a deal breaker that Netflix

519
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:16,380
isn't on the system, it's that this isn't something that they wanted, that they didn't

520
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:22,240
think of it seemed like, that it's still very much to me where they're like, oh well stay

521
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,500
tuned for more information about our networks, you know, our online system.

522
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:32,580
It's like, this system comes out next month, you know, it's like what the fuck, or just

523
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,580
a month away.

524
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:36,940
I mean like, what more time am I gonna give you?

525
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:40,700
My thought was they're trying to pepper the information the same way they're peppering

526
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:44,000
the games to keep the Switch in the gaming press.

527
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,200
It's not helping.

528
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,140
It's all negative information that's coming out.

529
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:48,500
All right, all right.

530
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:53,100
We gotta move on here because we're gonna be welcoming to the show right now a very

531
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,700
special guest.

532
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:59,740
And I want to get our pal Matt Baum on the line who's gonna talk to us about a project

533
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:03,840
that he's working with called Playing with Pride and I think we have him on the line

534
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,840
right now.

535
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:05,840
Hi Matt, are you there?

536
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,840
Yes, I'm here.

537
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,840
Thanks for having me.

538
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,840
Thanks for being on the show.

539
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,840
Matt, how you doing?

540
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,840
I'm doing great.

541
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:11,840
How are you guys?

542
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,840
Good.

543
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,840
Did you pre-order a Switch?

544
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,840
Are you a Nintendo fan?

545
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,840
Are you into that?

546
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,840
Yes, yes.

547
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:19,260
So our household is very Nintendo friendly.

548
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:23,700
So my partner ordered a Switch like the day of the announcement.

549
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:26,740
And if you didn't do it the day of the announcement, you're probably not getting one right away.

550
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:27,740
Yeah, yeah.

551
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:28,740
So I'm excited.

552
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,740
I'm looking forward to it.

553
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:35,580
I know there's a lot of debate about the features and the power and the strange amount of storage

554
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,860
space and all that stuff.

555
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:39,700
But I'm just excited to play Breath of the Wild.

556
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,100
I'm excited for more Mario Kart.

557
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:46,260
I am curious about taking the device with me.

558
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:48,260
So yeah, I'm all for it.

559
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:52,140
I seriously think all this debate on the show, which we've done every week for the past 15

560
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:56,180
years aside, I kind of think by holiday, everything's going to be fine.

561
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:57,900
That's kind of where I'm at with it.

562
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:58,900
But anyway.

563
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:01,580
I'd like to believe that about everything in the world.

564
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:02,580
Let's hope.

565
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:03,580
Let's hope.

566
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:07,140
So anyway, we could talk about the Switch with you all night, but I want to talk about

567
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,540
this project that you're working on.

568
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,540
It's called Playing with Pride.

569
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:12,980
Tell us a little bit about this project that you're working on.

570
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:13,980
Yeah.

571
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:17,660
So in a nutshell, it's about how people's lives are transformed when gay culture and

572
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:20,580
game culture collide together.

573
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:24,620
And so the way it started is we set out to answer that question that you mentioned at

574
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:30,740
the top of the show about why gay game events or LGBT game events are important to people.

575
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:33,360
This started a couple of years ago when GamerX was getting going.

576
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,580
That's the game convention with the LGBT focus.

577
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:42,900
And we heard that conversation online, the questions online, oh, why do we need this?

578
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,100
Why do we have a gay game convention?

579
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,180
What does sexuality have to do with gaming?

580
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,860
So we're like, oh, those are good questions.

581
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:48,860
Let's find out.

582
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:53,220
We did a big road trip around the country and we interviewed people in their homes about

583
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:56,100
why they were going to GamerX.

584
00:30:56,100 --> 00:31:01,200
And what we started to hear were really intense personal stories about how games help people

585
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:06,540
come out or meet their partners or find their tribe, reconcile with their family.

586
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:10,820
And so we're like, oh, there's something really important going on here.

587
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:15,260
And so what the project has turned into, we did these video interviews and we presented

588
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:17,020
some highlights at various conventions.

589
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:20,820
We showed them at PAX and GamerX and HavenCon.

590
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:24,980
We did a live stream that people can see if they go to playingwithpride.com.

591
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:29,820
You can watch a live stream that we did of some of the highlights where I talk and then

592
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:34,460
James talks and then we show some footage and go back and forth and we talk to the audience.

593
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:37,180
You can also sign up for the mailing list there at Playing with Pride for more announcements

594
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,760
about it.

595
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:42,420
And so now we're trying to figure out because we've got over a hundred interviews.

596
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:45,660
We've got hundreds of hours of stories.

597
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:48,880
How exactly do we want to present this to people?

598
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,500
And so that's one other step that we're at right now is just showing people the live

599
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:56,060
stream that we've got at playingwithpride.com and then there's a little feedback form where

600
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:59,340
people can say, oh, this is what I like, this is what I don't like, this is what I want

601
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,340
to see more of.

602
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:04,020
Because we've got people from all different backgrounds and all different walks of life

603
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:07,060
and all different parts of the country just sharing these stories about how games have

604
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:09,380
changed their lives.

605
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:14,300
And just a little bit of a personal testimony on this stuff as well for what I've watched

606
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:19,160
from the live stream with the interviews, I really wish I could see one of the panels

607
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,160
that you did.

608
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,160
I'd love to see that.

609
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,180
But I did watch the live stream bit that you did.

610
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:28,460
And just from a personal perspective, I can say being a gay guy who was really into video

611
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:32,700
games, I definitely felt like you were the outcast of two different camps.

612
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:38,740
It's like you were not pop culture savvy enough, even though I'm very pop culture savvy, but

613
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:42,740
you weren't really cool enough or whatever for the gay guys because you were a bit of

614
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:43,820
a nerd.

615
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:47,060
And then you were too gay for the nerds at some point.

616
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,980
So you feel like that double outcast.

617
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:55,300
So just personally to hear these other people that are saying the exact same thing is actually

618
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,740
really comforting for me in a way.

619
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:00,620
Yeah, it's something that we heard from a lot of people.

620
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:03,700
That feeling of, well, I don't belong with this tribe and I don't belong with this tribe

621
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,700
and who do I belong with?

622
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:11,380
And these are actually two groups, LGBTs and gamers are two groups that have a lot in common,

623
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,020
even though they don't always see eye to eye.

624
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:18,060
I think the folks in both groups have a lot to gain from playing together.

625
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,500
That's a really good point.

626
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:24,380
I hope a lot of people caught there is that gamers are often on the outs with the rest

627
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:25,940
of society as well.

628
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:28,220
And LGBT gets that as well.

629
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:32,940
And we could probably do more working together than shouting at each other.

630
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,740
Yeah, yeah, I hope so.

631
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:38,820
Because one of the things that we heard from people, we spoke to a lot of developers.

632
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:42,180
For example, we talked to people at BioWare about the creation of the character Krem

633
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:50,780
and the Iron Bull, about what happens when people are working together to make a game

634
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:52,820
more fun for everyone.

635
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:55,740
I think Krem is a really good example of that.

636
00:33:55,740 --> 00:34:00,460
We spoke to, it's actually kind of amazing how this happened, because we spoke to this

637
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:04,460
one person in Vancouver about his experiences with gaming.

638
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:09,860
And he shared stories about how when he was young, he had a bootleg version of Pokemon.

639
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:11,580
I can't remember which Pokemon it was.

640
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,860
He had a bootleg version of one of the Pokemons.

641
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:28,740
And the save got corrupted, and the gender of the character that he was playing flipped.

642
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:32,940
And he realized, oh, this is something that matters to me, and I don't quite know why.

643
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:36,780
So we talked to him and interviewed him, and we put him in our presentation.

644
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:40,420
And so when we presented at PAX, he came to the presentation to see it.

645
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:41,420
His name is Justin Sane.

646
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:46,940
He's a great cosplayer and drag queen and community leader up in Vancouver.

647
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:52,060
And something else that we had in the presentation was Karen Weeks from BioWare talking about

648
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:57,140
the character Krem, about how that character came about, because at a feedback event that

649
00:34:57,140 --> 00:35:00,460
BioWare had, they were asking people for their thoughts on the games.

650
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:04,460
And somebody came up and said about trans characters, I just want to see somebody in

651
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:07,900
the game who looks like me and isn't a monster.

652
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:10,940
And she said, well, after that, we all sat down together and we were like, we can do

653
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:11,940
this.

654
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,460
We can actually make this happen.

655
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:17,220
And so Justin Sane happened to be at this presentation, and afterwards he came up and

656
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:22,700
he was like, I think that person who said that was me.

657
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:26,260
I think I was the one who asked for a trans character.

658
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:29,020
And as it turns out, it was true.

659
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:34,200
And we went back and got Karen and a bunch of other BioWare folks together with Justin.

660
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:39,300
We sat them all down to talk about how he came to this event, wanted to see better trans

661
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:42,540
representation, more gender fluid representation in games.

662
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:46,580
They realized, oh, we can put people in games that we haven't, we've underserved in the

663
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:47,580
past.

664
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:51,220
And it was a great example of this virtuous cycle that happens when queer people find

665
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:53,820
their voice, find their community, and speak out.

666
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:57,420
Game developers can hear them, and it changes the way that they make games.

667
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:01,300
They make the games more inclusive so more people can enjoy them, and in turn that has

668
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:05,700
a positive effect on communities, and communities see that they're welcome in gaming, and everybody

669
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,140
can have a better time.

670
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:12,780
That's an outstanding story to hear, kind of like that direct influence with game makers.

671
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:17,340
But now you keep saying we, this project is not just you, your partner is involved, right?

672
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:20,060
Your partner actually worked in the game industry for a while, right?

673
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,060
Yeah, that's true.

674
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:23,920
James is a veteran of the game industry.

675
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,180
We are collaborating on this.

676
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,180
So he worked at LucasArts.

677
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,180
He worked at Capcom.

678
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:29,380
He worked at LeapFrog and some other places.

679
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:31,560
And so we're working together on this project.

680
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:37,300
He has just an encyclopedic knowledge of games, and I've absorbed as much as I can from him

681
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:40,820
through osmosis, and he's got this great knack for putting a game in front of me and saying,

682
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:43,740
I think you'll like this, and he's always right.

683
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:48,500
So it's thanks to him, because I was kind of a gamer as a kid, and then it kind of fell

684
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,900
away in high school and college.

685
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:58,520
And then once James and I started dating, oh gosh, many years ago, he brought me back

686
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,520
into the fold, essentially.

687
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:03,820
He was like, you'll like this game, and you should give this one a shot.

688
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:04,820
So it's been great.

689
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:12,140
I really enjoyed working with my partner as a partner, in all senses of the word.

690
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:13,140
That's a great story.

691
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,140
I love that.

692
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:17,260
And you guys didn't like, you didn't kickstart this or anything like that.

693
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:22,700
You guys took this trip you wanted to do and kind of turned it into this project, right?

694
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,700
Exactly.

695
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:24,700
Yeah.

696
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,700
There may be a kickstart in the future.

697
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:26,700
We haven't decided yet.

698
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:30,420
We haven't had a need for it yet, but we may in the future.

699
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,420
We'll see.

700
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:33,980
That's something that we're asking people for feedback on, like how they want to see

701
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:36,120
this project progress.

702
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:39,340
So based on their feedback, we'll decide what form it's going to take.

703
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:45,440
Well, the reality is, just to say the reality is if people want a movie, those cost money

704
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:50,360
to put on Blu-ray, so there's probably going to be a need for money there, for sure.

705
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,360
Yes.

706
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,360
Yes.

707
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,360
So we've done all the traveling.

708
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,080
So far we've done out of pocket.

709
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,820
And it's, you know, had a blast driving around the country.

710
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:01,880
We drove from L.A. up to Vancouver and then across the country, top of the country to

711
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:05,200
Chicago and New York and into Maine, then back through Denver.

712
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:11,880
We made a pit stop in Austin for HavenCon.

713
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:17,220
And I'm going to be in Orlando later this, in March, and so I'm hoping to do some interviews

714
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:18,220
in Orlando.

715
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:22,800
And we're also looking at Europe to talk to some people in Europe at some point in 2017.

716
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,520
So that's going to be a bit more of an expense.

717
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,800
So we're figuring that out now.

718
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,240
Although you have interviewed some people from overseas in this, right?

719
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:34,460
Because didn't I spot Laura, I'm going to mess up her name, but the Eurogamer writer

720
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:36,480
Laura Kate Dale is in this, right?

721
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,260
Yeah, from Let's Play Video Games.

722
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:44,260
We were lucky enough to catch her at GamerX in San Jose, or maybe it was Santa Clara,

723
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:45,740
but in California.

724
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:49,740
So we caught her there and we talked to Jim Sterling who, well, he lives in Mississippi,

725
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:52,940
but originally from the UK.

726
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:57,060
So yeah, we have spoken to a couple people internationally, but we want to get more people

727
00:38:57,060 --> 00:39:01,660
particularly from the South, particularly from rural areas, and particularly from countries

728
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:07,620
that want it to just be the U.S. experience because we'll play games everywhere.

729
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:08,700
Well Jamie's going to be bummed.

730
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:09,700
She missed tonight's show.

731
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:10,700
She's from the South.

732
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:11,700
Maybe she's out there listening.

733
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:16,380
Anyway, how has the response been at some of these conventions that you've taken this

734
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:17,380
to?

735
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:21,080
Because you mentioned you have shown this at, or your work in progress, I should say,

736
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,080
at GamerX.

737
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,780
You've taken it to PAX.

738
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:25,880
How has the response been?

739
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,980
Really strong.

740
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:28,900
We've had a great reaction from folks.

741
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,620
People are really interested.

742
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:34,220
One of the things that we're hearing a lot is, how can I see more?

743
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:41,020
We literally have 100 and something hours of people just telling stories.

744
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:46,140
We've got people talking about, for example, one of my favorite stories is these two guys

745
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:50,820
in D.C. that throw house parties, these gamer house parties where they just throw open the

746
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:56,660
doors and bring people in, so they've got zones of like, oh, the DDR is up there and

747
00:39:56,660 --> 00:40:01,460
Settlers of Catan is down in the basement and we've got Mass Effect going over here

748
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:05,740
and we've got Puerto Rico going over here.

749
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:12,180
These great games about people building up community and forming essentially chosen families,

750
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:16,340
which is something that I think is familiar to a lot of queer people.

751
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:22,620
Can I just say that the house party and doing the gaming at the house party, that is actually

752
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:28,620
how about, gosh, it probably would have been 13 years ago or so, that is how I met Captain

753
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:34,260
Spike from GameBooey.org and started a lifelong friendship and obviously they're on the network

754
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:39,700
here as well at VoG and just, you all know Spike and his immense knowledge of video games

755
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:40,700
and all that stuff.

756
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:46,020
We met and connected and started a friendship because of one of those types of house parties.

757
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:47,500
It's such a big deal.

758
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:51,860
Those gamer get-togethers and the forming of community, it's so important to people,

759
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:54,260
whether it's in real life or online.

760
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:59,180
We talked to a woman in Las Vegas who, she's a mom, she's raising a kid and her son came

761
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:03,180
to her, I think he was early teens, and was like, oh, I want to play World of Warcraft

762
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:06,980
and she was monitoring his games at the time and she's like, I don't really know what that

763
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:09,480
is so I should check it out, make sure it's appropriate.

764
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:13,940
She downloads a free trial and then within a couple of months, the whole family, they

765
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:19,820
all have gaming laptops and they are going on raids together as a family and she joined

766
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:24,640
an LGBT-friendly guild, the Spectrum Guild, and it turned into this big family for her

767
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:29,340
where now everywhere she can go all over the country and visit people from the guild.

768
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:33,860
It's so important, those communities that form, because for a lot of folks, they do

769
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:41,060
feel that they don't belong, that there's something that sets them apart and games have

770
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:46,020
a really great way, nothing does this like games of bringing people together.

771
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:51,540
It's interesting you bring up MMOs and especially Warcraft and I noticed when I was watching

772
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:57,080
the footage that you had at playingwithpride.com that Warcraft was a theme that kept coming

773
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:00,980
up and even for me, that's been a thing because I just mentioned at the top of the show, Alan

774
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:13,940
and I got married after seven years together, but when we were first together, I lived here

775
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:16,780
in Sacramento, which is a good 100 miles apart.

776
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:19,820
We couldn't just drive up on a weeknight and see each other.

777
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:24,020
One of the ways that we would hang out, I'm using my quotey fingers, was through something

778
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:25,020
like Warcraft.

779
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:31,940
Warcraft allowed us to be together even though we weren't, that makes sense.

780
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:32,940
That's something that we've heard.

781
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:37,500
Warcraft has come up again and again and again.

782
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:41,180
It's tough because we don't want to make it like Warcraft the documentary, but it kind

783
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:44,540
of works out, it's like Warcraft and Bioware.

784
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:48,900
We talked to this one person in, where was it?

785
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,500
Just outside San Francisco, who was in the army.

786
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:54,800
He was in the army and closeted and there was no one he could tell because it was during

787
00:42:54,800 --> 00:43:00,220
Don't Ask, Don't Tell and he was introduced to Warcraft as a way to just kind of get some

788
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:05,580
alone time from everyone he was stationed with and he realized he was playing as female

789
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:09,480
characters and it was something they wanted to explore more of and then he started coming

790
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:14,440
out to Don't Ask, Don't Tell went away.

791
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:19,480
He was comfortable coming out to his friends and he went into the army because he was like,

792
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:21,840
I need to be more masculine, I need to be more manly.

793
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:25,640
And Warcraft gave him permission to play as female characters and dress up and be girly

794
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:31,960
and now the latest thing that he's done, we interviewed him just after the holidays, he

795
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:36,800
went to his army, I think it was his battalion or just the group of people he serves with,

796
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:41,240
he went to the holiday party in drag, in this big princess dress and it was a huge

797
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,240
hit.

798
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,240
Everybody loved it.

799
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:51,040
It's amazing because Warcraft made him comfortable exploring his more feminine side and not feeling

800
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:54,560
this pressure that he'd been putting on himself the whole time, oh I got to be more of a man,

801
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,080
I got to be more stereotypically manly.

802
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:59,200
No, you don't, you don't and games are a great way to experiment with that.

803
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:04,440
If you guys have questions, of course for Matt, our chat room is open over at live.vognetwork.com.

804
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:07,480
Y'all are being quiet in there right now, but I'm assuming you're just listening intently.

805
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:11,800
But if you do have questions, you can ask those over at live.vognetwork.com, I'll try

806
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:14,320
to fit a few in here before we have to let Matt go.

807
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:19,360
But just kind of piggybacking on the Warcraft thing, I mean that's a cool story, but I was

808
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:24,560
also, like for me personally, something that kind of caught my attention was you had a

809
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:30,560
trans individual who was talking about Warcraft and that this, you know, and I don't happen

810
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:35,360
to be trans myself, so this is something I never thought of, right?

811
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:42,800
Is that this was a trans person who was playing a female character and was able to kind of

812
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:50,120
explore femininity, feminine, I can't even say this word, the feminine side through World

813
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:51,120
of Warcraft.

814
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:54,840
And, you know, it's interesting because I even know in the past I've made these jokes

815
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:58,720
and I've probably cracked them on air about how, oh, you know everybody that's playing

816
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:03,080
a woman in World of Warcraft is just some perv dude sitting there, right?

817
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:04,080
You know?

818
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,080
And those types of things.

819
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:08,680
And hearing a story like that definitely stopped and made me think, huh, there's definitely

820
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:14,200
a lot more to this than these stereotypes, I suppose, that are out there.

821
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:16,320
Yeah, yeah.

822
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:17,320
It's really true.

823
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:24,760
The one person that we spoke to, Jude in Bakersfield, told us a story about how when he was presenting

824
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:30,240
as female he got more sexual harassment in the game than he did after he transitioned

825
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,920
and was openly trans when he played.

826
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:36,640
He got harassed more as a woman than he did as a trans person.

827
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:41,960
We also heard from Laura Dale about how she was harassed for, you know, the people she

828
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:46,520
was playing with felt that she was being inconsistent with her gender and withholding something

829
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:51,120
when in reality she was just trying to figure herself out at the time.

830
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:58,960
So yeah, it's been tough for a lot of people because for sure it is possible for LGBT people

831
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:02,240
to feel very unwelcome in games, especially when you don't see yourself.

832
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,960
To feel like, oh, I guess maybe I'm not a gamer.

833
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,360
Maybe games aren't for me.

834
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:14,040
And so that's one reason why seeing yourself in games and why queer game events matter

835
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,040
to people.

836
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:19,280
To see yourself reflected there and to see other people like you affirms, yeah, yeah,

837
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,280
you exist.

838
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:25,460
You're a person and you belong here and we are eager to play with you.

839
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:29,360
And fifth dream in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com kind of piggybacking on this story a little

840
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:31,920
bit saying, I'm kind of like that with MMOs.

841
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:36,100
I've always felt pressured to be more manly, but I always play girls in games.

842
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:39,600
And since I've been playing Final Fantasy 14, and maybe it's a coincidence, but I've

843
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:43,920
kind of said, fuck it and dress more how I want and stop trying to be so much of a dude

844
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:44,920
dude.

845
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:47,160
But then again, I'm goth, so androgyny is easier.

846
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:48,860
Yeah, that's great.

847
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:56,460
So it's not just even necessarily for LGBT only people, it's a very broad spectrum.

848
00:46:56,460 --> 00:47:02,900
And actually, I wanted to ask this question because our audience here at OLR is not exclusively

849
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:03,900
LGBT.

850
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:07,140
We have a lot of straight folks that listen to this program.

851
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:12,500
And we touched on this a little bit in the beginning about like, why might a straight

852
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:15,520
individual be interested in something like playing with pride?

853
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:20,000
But what I want to ask was, since you have taken this to expos like PAX, you know, which

854
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:25,120
is definitely not I mean, there's, you know, a lot of straight guys that go to PAX, like,

855
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:29,880
have you had a response from the non LGBT community?

856
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,240
What kind of response have you gotten?

857
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:32,240
Like, have you?

858
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:35,280
Have you heard that this project has worked in enlightening folks or what?

859
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:38,720
Yeah, well, so our goal isn't exactly to enlighten folks.

860
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:43,080
But what we've heard is that from from straight people in particular, one of the questions

861
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:49,080
that we get a lot is just how can I make my gaming environments more welcoming?

862
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:53,280
What can I do to ensure that people are having a good time?

863
00:47:53,280 --> 00:48:00,200
And you know, my advice there is to listen, to ask people, you know, just to check in.

864
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:01,200
Are you having a good time?

865
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,320
Are you feeling okay?

866
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:03,640
Is everything comfortable?

867
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:06,900
And if there's a problem, if anyone's making you feel uncomfortable, if there's anything

868
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:08,440
that's missing, well, what can we do to change that?

869
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:11,800
What can we do to make sure everybody's having a good time?

870
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:15,020
Never underestimate the power of just asking and listening.

871
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:19,560
So that's that's been some of the response that we've heard from people who don't consider

872
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:24,200
themselves part of the LGBT community, but want to be good allies.

873
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:29,880
You know, the two things we hear are, why is this necessary?

874
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:35,400
And I think, to be perfectly honest, you know, this meaning LGBT game spaces or LGBT game

875
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:36,400
events.

876
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,760
And to be honest, I don't think they're necessary.

877
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:43,200
I mean, nobody needs a game convention of any kind.

878
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,600
We don't need it, but we like it.

879
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:45,600
It's important to us.

880
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:46,600
It matters to us.

881
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:51,840
You know, we're not going to die if they don't happen, but they really do change our lives.

882
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:56,440
And so what we found is, you know, at that collision of gay culture and game culture,

883
00:48:56,440 --> 00:49:02,080
it reveals that playing together really helps us understand each other.

884
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:05,120
And that's really what it's about, that we come together, we have a good time, we make

885
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:13,720
friends, and we understand people that we might never have considered friends before.

886
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:18,260
I want to make sure, of course, I want to make sure we amply plug the playingwithpride.com

887
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:22,380
website so folks can check out this live stream for themselves and give you that feedback

888
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:25,360
that you are seeking about what happens next.

889
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:27,520
Is this a documentary or is this a video podcast?

890
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:31,280
But I also want to make sure we talk about your other projects, because you don't just

891
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:34,040
work with this playingwithpride.com.

892
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:38,520
You host a couple of podcasts yourself, right?

893
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:39,520
That's correct.

894
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:40,640
So I have a couple.

895
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:45,560
One is The Sewers of Paris, and that's at thesewersofparis.com or wherever you get your

896
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:46,560
podcasts.

897
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:50,180
And on that show, I talk to different gay men every week about entertainment that's

898
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:52,800
changed the lives of gay men.

899
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:59,240
So you know, people share stories about how Madonna or Oscar Wilde or John Waters or whatever

900
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:04,520
it is, those pieces of culture that have made a difference to them and have transformed

901
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:05,520
things for them.

902
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:11,920
I have an amazing story on one episode from this guy who watched some real cheesy 80s

903
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:12,920
films.

904
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:17,480
He was growing up in Russia and watched some really cheesy 80s films in the 80s.

905
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:22,040
They were broadcast on this pirate TV station where you had to wake up at 2 a.m. and tune

906
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:23,620
the TV to a certain channel.

907
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:28,620
And then you'd be able to watch Curly Sue got married, Curly Sue got married.

908
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:32,980
Just silly things, trading places.

909
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:36,260
But that formed this, for him and his mom who were just living together, it was the

910
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:41,860
two of them, it formed this vision of the U.S. for them of like, oh, the United States

911
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:46,400
is a lot better than this world we're growing up in, let's get out of this country.

912
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:52,340
So his mother became a mail-order bride so that they could get out of the U.S. and move

913
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:56,260
to a place where he could, it wasn't safe for him to be a gay kid in Russia, so they

914
00:50:56,260 --> 00:51:00,980
moved to Seattle where he could be openly gay in a place that was a little bit safer.

915
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:06,700
And so he's just got this amazing story about how these visions of the U.S. via weird 80s

916
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:10,460
movies on a pirate TV station essentially saved his life.

917
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:14,580
So we've got lots of stories about that, about culture that has changed the lives of gay

918
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:15,580
men.

919
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:16,580
That's at sewersofparis.com.

920
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:19,420
I feel so cliche.

921
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:22,880
When I hear an amazing story like that, I feel so cliche because for me it was the Rocky

922
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:23,880
Horror Picture Show.

923
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:29,220
So you know, there's a ton of people like that, right?

924
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:31,380
Rocky Horror has been huge for our community.

925
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:32,620
But anyway, I digress.

926
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:33,620
Yeah.

927
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:37,520
Well, I mean, it has and everybody has a different Rocky experience.

928
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:44,580
You know, for me it was watching it with the high school drama club and realizing, essentially

929
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:49,300
getting permission from the movie to like other boys and to be weird about gender.

930
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:56,980
Because you know, I was growing up in a fairly un-gay suburb of Connecticut in the 90s.

931
00:51:56,980 --> 00:52:01,540
And Rocky Horror kind of opened that up to that song at the end, Don't Dream It, Be It.

932
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:02,540
Yeah, for sure.

933
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:04,500
And it says, go be what you want to be.

934
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:09,620
And that's why Tim Curry is like a legend and always will be for me.

935
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:13,260
Not to make this all about me, but it is part of the reason I'm still like, I'm pushing

936
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:15,300
40 years old and I'm still involved with Rocky Horror.

937
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:20,280
In fact, I'm hosting Rocky Horror here in Sacramento on February 11th, plug, plug.

938
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:26,820
But part of the reason I still stay involved to this day is so that that exists for me,

939
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:28,820
who's 18 now.

940
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:34,660
Yeah, the kids today growing up.

941
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:41,020
I actually did a Rocky episode last year around Halloween from this guy who was actually homeless

942
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:44,800
living in LA, just squatting in different places.

943
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:48,540
And the community that sprang up, and this is when it was first run in the late 70s,

944
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:53,140
the community that sprung up around the Rocky Horror Picture Show, for him, that was his

945
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:54,140
community.

946
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:55,140
Like those were his people.

947
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:57,660
That literally saved his life and gave him people to connect with when he had nobody

948
00:52:57,660 --> 00:52:59,980
and nowhere to go.

949
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:02,820
So that's all on SursaParis.com.

950
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:05,660
My other podcast is Defining Marriage, and that's a little more casual.

951
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:11,580
It's where my partner James and I talk about the week's LGBT news, but we're very casual

952
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:13,380
and jokey and chatty about it.

953
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:18,580
So half the show is about, you know, like this week we're talking about why Taiwan might

954
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:23,100
become the first country in Asia to legalize marriage equality and we talked about why

955
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:24,100
that is.

956
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:27,540
We talked about some of the silly stuff that's happening in Australia around marriage and

957
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:33,540
also there's this debate going on, very tiresome debate in Taiwan about like, well, if we legalize

958
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:37,260
marriage, couldn't people marry the Ferris wheel?

959
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:39,580
And so, oh boy, that argument.

960
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:40,580
So we make fun of that.

961
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:41,580
Ferris wheels need love too.

962
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:42,580
Hey, stop it.

963
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:43,580
Yeah, exactly.

964
00:53:43,580 --> 00:53:44,580
Oh boy.

965
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:46,980
You can love, you can love a Ferris wheel.

966
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:51,700
You just don't love a Ferris wheel.

967
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:54,740
Love is a spectrum of many different colors in my opinion.

968
00:53:54,740 --> 00:53:59,100
And the color that I love Alan with is not the same color that I love a Ferris wheel

969
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:00,100
with.

970
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:01,100
Yes.

971
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:02,100
Yeah, there are differences.

972
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:07,780
I think that's a funny joke to make on behalf of the other side, but gee whiz, maybe they

973
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:12,500
can think of some differences between same sex couples and Ferris wheels.

974
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:15,860
So anyway, so we talk about half about like LGBT stuff and then we always get sidetracked

975
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:23,140
on what games we're playing and we had, you know, got way down in the weeds on whatever

976
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:26,100
it is, whether it's anime or we're watching Steven universe.

977
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:29,220
So we had a lot to say about Steven universe this week.

978
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:33,220
So it's a lot of, it's a lot of nonsense on top of whatever's happening in the news

979
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:34,420
this week.

980
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:37,820
Let me shift back to games a little bit here with a question from our chat room.

981
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:41,500
And you know, you've, you have, you know, not just your podcast, but you have a very

982
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:46,100
rich history with some of the, you know, articles that you've written for various, you know,

983
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:49,900
GLBT plus publications and so forth.

984
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:54,460
You know, you, you obviously kind of have finger on the pulse of all this stuff.

985
00:54:54,460 --> 00:55:00,280
But as a gamer as well, SGA 100 Matt wants to know in our chat room over at live.fognetwork.com,

986
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:06,380
what are your thoughts on the nonsense online backlash over Tracer being gay, the Overwatch

987
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:07,380
character?

988
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:08,380
Oh boy.

989
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:09,380
Oh boy.

990
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:11,780
Look, Tracer is a lesbian, end of story.

991
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:14,280
I mean, like that's very reductive.

992
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:15,280
Maybe she's bisexual.

993
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:16,280
Who knows?

994
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:21,740
But to be fair, the creator tweeted or the character design or something tweeted she's

995
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:22,740
lesbian.

996
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:25,500
We do know her identity is lesbian.

997
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:27,940
Okay, fantastic.

998
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:29,220
I think that's great.

999
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:33,980
Yeah, I think, sure, of course the people are having this backlash where they're like,

1000
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:36,180
no, no, I, but I wanted her to be straight.

1001
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:44,020
Well, for heaven's sake, if you need a attractive female video game character, please consult

1002
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:46,160
all other game culture.

1003
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:50,020
You have your pick of everything.

1004
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:54,060
Let the lesbians have Tracer for heaven's sake.

1005
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:55,560
And also like, so what?

1006
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:56,560
She's a lesbian.

1007
00:55:56,560 --> 00:56:00,600
If you still want to fantasize her as waifu, then fucking, it's a fantasy.

1008
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:01,600
It's a fantasy.

1009
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:03,880
Yes, that's a good point.

1010
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:05,820
Tracer does not actually exist.

1011
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:07,720
She is a fictional character.

1012
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:11,800
So you can believe whatever you want to believe about her.

1013
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:13,860
But officially, I think it's important.

1014
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:18,100
It's fun to joke about it, but it is also important to say, look, there are queer characters

1015
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:21,840
in games and they're powerful and their sexuality isn't like they're defined, like they don't

1016
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:26,540
shoulder the burden of representation for lesbians everywhere, that she is just living

1017
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:29,300
her life and being a hero and being a lesbian.

1018
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:33,100
We talked to a guy here in Seattle, Ian, who put it really nicely.

1019
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:36,340
He was talking about Shepard when he was playing Mass Effect.

1020
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:42,380
He said, finally, I could be the gay hero I've always wanted to be.

1021
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:45,940
And I mean, what an amazing opportunity to give people, if you can create a character

1022
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:50,420
that makes people feel like they can be a hero and they can be gay and they can be all

1023
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:52,780
the things that make up who they are all at once.

1024
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:55,300
They don't have to exclude a part of themselves.

1025
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:58,260
What an amazing feeling and what a great way for people to connect.

1026
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:02,860
Well, I think finally I can be the gay hero I've always wanted to be is a good note for

1027
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:04,260
us to end this on.

1028
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:08,320

So that's a great way to connect with me.

1048
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:00,640
You are a busy man, Matt, and I appreciate you taking 20 minutes, almost 30 minutes actually,

1049
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:02,200
out to be on our show this week.

1050
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:06,860

1051
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:07,920
Thank you so much for being here, Matt.

1052

We seem to run into each other at conventions sometimes, so I hope I can come to your next

1055
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:21,200
Playing with Pride presentation at whatever convention I see you at next.

1056
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:22,200
Hooray!

1057
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:24,800
Yeah, I'm looking forward to that and thanks so much for having me on the show.

1058
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:25,800
Thank you.

1059
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:26,800
Take care, Matt.

1060
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:27,800
Thanks for being here.

1061
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:28,800
Alrighty.

1062
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:29,800
Bye-bye.

1063
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:30,800
Bye.

1064
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:33,220
Alright, again, that's playingwithpride.com and you can also follow Matt on Twitter, Matt

1065
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:36,440
Baume, M-A-T-T B-A-U-M-E.

1066
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:39,500
Thank you so much for taking the time out and being on our show this week and I really

1067
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:45,560
look forward to whatever is next for Playing with Pride, be it documentary, podcasts, whatever,

1068
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:48,080
whatever they decide to do with it.

1069
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:53,300
Anyhow, we're going to get back into some gaming news, but not until we talk about our

1070
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:56,000
gaming weeks, because we are still, we're about an hour into the show.

1071
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,080
We haven't even talked about what types of video games we've been playing this week.

1072
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:00,860
So, Loki, how was your gaming week?

1073
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:07,420
So this week I did purchase a new game, so I, and whoa, I played it on Steam even.

1074
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:09,740
It was Happy Room.

1075
00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:14,860
So like, I was watching, you know, one of the YouTubers, I watched Ollie43 and he does

1076
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:21,140
a lot of pretty fun GTA 5 mod videos and so one of the games he played was Happy Room

1077
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:25,500
and if you've ever played like Happy Wheels, it's basically kind of the same type of thing

1078
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:31,020
where you have a rag doll that you torture through, you know, all sorts of means, whereas

1079
00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:35,620
Happy Wheels is more of getting from point A to point B via bike or whatever and being

1080
00:59:35,620 --> 00:59:37,060
horribly offensive.

1081
00:59:37,060 --> 00:59:41,340
This is just straight up, here's a dummy, create a death trap for the dummy, do as much

1082
00:59:41,340 --> 00:59:43,380
damage as you can, try to kill the dummy.

1083
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:48,340
And so you do that and they have different challenges like, you know, put the dummy on

1084
00:59:48,340 --> 00:59:53,700
a saw blade for, you know, 10 seconds or, you know, freeze, electrocute and set on fire

1085
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:55,900
and, I don't know.

1086
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:59,900
So I played that all this week and I finally got to the point where I unlocked the sandbox

1087
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:03,620
mode and kind of the point where I'm actually getting trophies now because all of it has

1088
01:00:03,620 --> 01:00:06,140
to do with killing the dummy.

1089
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:12,060
So it was fun, it was like, I think it was like a 10 buck game, it was pretty cheap.

1090
01:00:12,060 --> 01:00:14,860
But yeah, nice time killer.

1091
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:20,700
And then a little bit of Ingress and I think I did manage to play a little bit of Skyrim

1092
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:21,700
Remastered.

1093
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:24,020
That was about it.

1094
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:25,020
Alright.

1095
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:30,740
My gaming week has been kind of boring compared to previous weeks because I didn't play any

1096
01:00:30,740 --> 01:00:31,740
real new stuff.

1097
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:35,780
I thought about getting Dragon Quest VIII on the 3DS and I really do love Dragon Quest

1098
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:40,740
VIII but I think it, from what I'm hearing, it seems like it might be a little bit of

1099
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:45,080
a step down from the PlayStation 2 version because like the orchestrated music can't

1100
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:49,300
be in there, the little screen kind of makes it a little harder for some stuff.

1101
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:53,540
So I don't know, I might still pick it up at some point but I didn't end up getting

1102
01:00:53,540 --> 01:00:54,540
Dragon Quest VIII.

1103
01:00:54,540 --> 01:00:58,420
Do you guys think I made the right decision in chat, live.foggamer.com?

1104
01:00:58,420 --> 01:00:59,420
Let's see.

1105
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:01,980
But what I did play this week, I did play more Final Fantasy XIV which, you know, I

1106
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:02,980
play a lot of that game obviously.

1107
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:07,260
But they just had a new patch come out in this past week which was a new story patch.

1108
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:10,180
That means there's new dungeons, there's a new raid I still got to do.

1109
01:01:10,180 --> 01:01:14,220
There's a lot of new stuff that opened up in Final Fantasy XIV so, you know, that team's

1110
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:18,360
done a great job of making sure that like new content is coming out every two or three

1111
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:21,900
months that gives you something else to do, to explore.

1112
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:23,540
So that's been great.

1113
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:27,620
So keeps me a fan and has kept me subscribed since the beginning of Realm Reborn really

1114
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:30,100
so good job to the XIV team.

1115
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:33,620
And then I also played a little bit of Overwatch, been playing that like I mentioned earlier

1116
01:01:33,620 --> 01:01:34,620
in the show.

1117
01:01:34,620 --> 01:01:35,620
Alan and I will play.

1118
01:01:35,620 --> 01:01:38,240
I'm trying to force myself to learn some new characters.

1119
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:44,440
So I've taken a weird liking to Ana lately because I learned you kind of, you can use

1120
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:47,280
her scope and you really should use her scope wherever possible.

1121
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:50,520
But you can really do a lot with Ana, like not even using her scope.

1122
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:54,680
Like you can actually be kind of a more effective healer, just kind of like firing bullets repeatedly

1123
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:57,360
at your team and using the grenades and all the other stuff that she does.

1124
01:01:57,360 --> 01:02:00,600
So I'm just kind of trying to learn and Ana is not an easy character because I'm not a

1125
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:01,960
very good sniper.

1126
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:06,020
But I've like tried to learn how to use Widowmaker a little more so I'm kind of like forcing

1127
01:02:06,020 --> 01:02:08,680
myself to be a better sniper, if that makes sense.

1128
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:10,860
So yeah, you don't really play Overwatch.

1129
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:15,980
I'm speaking a foreign language to you right now, but I swear you're missing out, Loki.

1130
01:02:15,980 --> 01:02:16,980
It's a real fun game.

1131
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:18,740
Even if it is a shooter, not everybody's into shooters.

1132
01:02:18,740 --> 01:02:19,740
I have a great time with that.

1133
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:20,740
I'm in the shooters.

1134
01:02:20,740 --> 01:02:24,140
I just don't want to play online games because it requires me to dedicate a ton of time to

1135
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:26,180
that stuff and I just don't have that time anymore.

1136
01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:28,820
Well, you know, but the nice thing about Overwatch is those games aren't very long.

1137
01:02:28,820 --> 01:02:32,920
You know, I usually I'll drop in, I'll play like two or three games and then I'll get

1138
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:35,340
really frustrated and just quit.

1139
01:02:35,340 --> 01:02:37,040
So it's kind of like, you know, drop in, drop out.

1140
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:40,200
But yeah, just been playing a little bit of Overwatch as well.

1141
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:41,300
So that's pretty much been my gaming week.

1142
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:44,680
I haven't really gotten around to doing any new stuff.

1143
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:47,980
I did do the Hatsune Miku game they released on PlayStation 4, but I can't remember if

1144
01:02:47,980 --> 01:02:52,200
that was last week or this week, but they released a new Hatsune Miku game on PlayStation

1145
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:56,760
4, but it's you download it and you only get like two songs.

1146
01:02:56,760 --> 01:03:00,860
You have to buy all the rest, but it's like it's kind of a bit of money to buy the other

1147
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:01,860
song.

1148
01:03:01,940 --> 01:03:06,140
It's like, I think if you drop the, what is it, 50 bucks or something to get both packs,

1149
01:03:06,140 --> 01:03:08,380
I don't know if that's the right number, sorry guys.

1150
01:03:08,380 --> 01:03:09,700
It's like 240 songs.

1151
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:11,020
It's a lot of songs.

1152
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:17,300
So I'm kind of like teetering on that buy now button, but because Hatsune Miku is as

1153
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:20,780
silly and ridiculous as it is, it is kind of a lot of fun for a music game.

1154
01:03:20,780 --> 01:03:23,100
Like I do, I do really enjoy it.

1155
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:26,620
So like I keep hovering over that buy now button, but it's like, you know, there's going

1156
01:03:26,620 --> 01:03:27,620
to be a sale.

1157
01:03:27,620 --> 01:03:30,900
Like, you know, they're going to do a sale because it's Sega, there's going to be a sale

1158
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:34,580
Black Friday or something like I can get it cheaper then, but I don't know.

1159
01:03:34,580 --> 01:03:37,900
The question will be, uh, can I, can I hold out that long?

1160
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:38,900
I don't know.

1161
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:39,900
Anyway.

1162
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:44,540
Um, uh, let's see fifth dream and chat over at live.vognetwork.com says I got all the

1163
01:03:44,540 --> 01:03:46,900
future tones songs day one.

1164
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:50,540
I've been waiting for this for a while and there's, I think people have actually tweeted

1165
01:03:50,540 --> 01:03:52,960
me too, that I should just take the plunge.

1166
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:55,100
So I probably will, but I just haven't yet.

1167
01:03:55,100 --> 01:03:58,780
I've been getting a lot of use out of just those two songs that the free, free, free

1168
01:03:58,780 --> 01:03:59,780
thing comes with.

1169
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:01,820
Anyway, so that's it for our gaming week.

1170
01:04:01,820 --> 01:04:06,220
So a little bit of housekeeping, of course, you can always follow us on Twitter, twitter.com

1171
01:04:06,220 --> 01:04:11,500
slash O L R we're also on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.

1172
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:15,540
I do want to make sure I plug something here coming up this week, actually, actually it's

1173
01:04:15,540 --> 01:04:16,540
tomorrow.

1174
01:04:16,540 --> 01:04:20,380
So if you happen to be local, uh, it would be awesome if you want to drop by and say

1175
01:04:20,380 --> 01:04:21,380
hello.

1176
01:04:21,380 --> 01:04:25,140
Uh, for those of you that are local, um, Sacramento, I GDA, which, you know, we're buddies with

1177
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:29,140
a Brie and Gabe and all the folks at Sac I GDA, uh, they're actually doing an event tomorrow

1178
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:35,860
called developing a game from concept to paycheck success through community with T cubed.

1179
01:04:35,860 --> 01:04:38,300
And it's going down at hacker lab downtown.

1180
01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:40,700
And that's tomorrow at six o'clock Pacific.

1181
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:43,140
And um, I don't know if they're going to stream it or anything like that.

1182
01:04:43,140 --> 01:04:45,180
Sometimes Brie gets it out, gets off the phone.

1183
01:04:45,180 --> 01:04:48,100
It's so exciting because I'm going to actually be down that way.

1184
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:49,100
Well, not tomorrow.

1185
01:04:49,100 --> 01:04:51,100
Um, come say hello.

1186
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:54,780
No, I'm going to be down that way in a couple of weeks, actually.

1187
01:04:54,780 --> 01:04:58,480
I'm going to be start working on there for about six weeks because I have a stint going

1188
01:04:58,480 --> 01:04:59,480
down there.

1189
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:00,480
Nice.

1190
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:04,420
Um, so I'm going to be talking to the creators of this T cubed, which is, which is actually

1191
01:05:04,420 --> 01:05:05,920
a physical game.

1192
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:10,120
It's an actual like physical cube that you play like a modern version to tic tac toe

1193
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:11,120
on.

1194
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:12,120
Yeah, it's like a tic tac toe thing.

1195
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:18,280
And then I tried playing on the prototype like back last, um, Sac I GDA arcade and unfortunately

1196
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:19,860
I didn't quite get it.

1197
01:05:19,860 --> 01:05:20,860
It's evolved a lot.

1198
01:05:20,860 --> 01:05:25,080
I watched this little presentation that the guy did and the way he explained it to the

1199
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:26,800
whole crowd in like five seconds.

1200
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:29,200
So I imagine the game shifted a lot.

1201
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:35,820
Um, so yeah, anyway, um, he started, I think they, they started though doing Android development

1202
01:05:35,820 --> 01:05:37,460
and it kind of shifted into this.

1203
01:05:37,460 --> 01:05:40,680
So anyway, uh, going to be talking to him live at this event.

1204
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:41,680
They asked me to moderate it.

1205
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:45,840
So that's why I'm, I'm plugging it cause I'm going to be there moderating this and uh,

1206
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:46,840
talking about that.

1207
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:48,360
So for you locals, come on down.

1208
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:51,400
Um, I don't know if there will be punching pie, but possibly.

1209
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:52,400
So check that out.

1210
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:53,400
I'll be there.

1211
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:54,400
Isn't that all you need?

1212
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:55,400
All right.

1213
01:05:56,160 --> 01:06:00,080
Let's get into some gaming news Loki.

1214
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:02,680
So the Oculus lawsuits already begun.

1215
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:08,720
Um, of course with that Zenny max did, um, make a statement basically saying, you know,

1216
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:12,880
the, you know, the trial has started and you know, we're excited to present our case and

1217
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:13,880
all that stuff.

1218
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:17,360
And we're so awesome and yeah, whatever.

1219
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:21,880
So um, but what's, you know, a little bit more interesting here though.

1220
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:28,520
Um, so Mark Zuckerberg is going to be testifying in the trial as well.

1221
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:34,880
So I'm basically saying, you know, I, I don't think that, um, good virtual reality is fully

1222
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:35,880
there yet.

1223
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:38,680
It's going to take five or 10 more years of development before we get to where we want

1224
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:39,680
to go.

1225
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:43,920
And then kind of defending that, you know, they didn't actually steal the information

1226
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:51,320
from, um, Zenny max, uh, it's, you know, they were saying that it's pretty common when you

1227
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:55,120
announce a big deal or do something that all kinds of people are coming out of the

1228
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:58,040
woodwork and claiming that they did some portion of the deal.

1229
01:06:58,040 --> 01:07:03,380
Um, like most people in court, I've never even heard of Zenny max before.

1230
01:07:03,380 --> 01:07:09,240
So he's basically kind of saying that they smelled money and so now they're coming and

1231
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:10,320
try to get a piece of that.

1232
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:14,320
So it's that Mariah Carey gift that's out there where it says, I don't know her when

1233
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:15,320
it comes to Zenny max.

1234
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:16,320
Right?

1235
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:19,800
I mean, I originally, that's a kind of what it seemed like and they're like, oh yeah,

1236
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:22,320
we want that $2 billion and we'll see.

1237
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:25,520
I guess it'll all come out, you know, since it's going to trial now that we'll find out

1238
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:26,520
what's going on.

1239
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:27,520
Yeah.

1240
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:31,160
Usually these things are settled and this is, there's both sides are being very stubborn

1241
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:34,440
while they want $2 billion so that they aren't going to sell for that.

1242
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:39,320
So interesting to see what actually happens or I don't know.

1243
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:44,880
I can't help but think though, I don't really care how the outcome is either way because

1244
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:46,760
I think the vibe looks like a better product.

1245
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:47,760
So yeah, whatever.

1246
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:53,560
Well, and it seems like a lot of folks are, are, are kind of coalescing around the vibe

1247
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:54,560
right now.

1248
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:59,400
I mean, I don't, I don't have the same insight into the VR scene as our pal Bobby does.

1249
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:02,040
But just, you know, just based on what I see on Twitter and people to get the hands on

1250
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:06,000
and all that, like it seems like there's more kind of coalescing around the vibe right now.

1251
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Right now.

1252
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Yeah.

1253
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,840
And I mean, there's going to be more headsets coming out for sure from a lot of different

1254
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:11,840
companies.

1255
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:16,120
I mean, especially now they, they announced more coming from, you know, CES, you know,

1256
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:20,880
it's going to tie in more with that windows holographic stuff and their virtual reality

1257
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:22,920
OS type thing.

1258
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:27,360
So that'll be interesting to see how that plays, you know, part of it.

1259
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:31,640
But I mean, this certainly is a hassle.

1260
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:37,480
Well, some other big news that happened this week Nintendo had another direct but this

1261
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:38,480
one was not about the switch.

1262
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:42,120
It was about the Fire Emblem series, which I'm going to admit, I don't get super into

1263
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:43,480
the tactical RPGs.

1264
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:48,840
So Fire Emblem's not usually a franchise that I get very invested in, but I do recognize

1265
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:52,380
a lot of people really enjoy this franchise.

1266
01:08:52,380 --> 01:08:56,960
But you know, you might have been more happy if it was like the F-Zero direct or Metro

1267
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:57,960
direct.

1268
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:00,280
If it had been the F-Zero direct, I would have popped the popcorn.

1269
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:02,120
I would have been on the couch with my pants off.

1270
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:03,120
No, I'm just kidding.

1271
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:04,120
TMI.

1272
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:05,120
I'm just kidding.

1273
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:08,300
But I would be very, very excited if it was an F-Zero direct, but I kind of like, here's

1274
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:09,300
the thing.

1275
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:15,660
Kind of accepting, not really accepting, but just trying to accept dealing with the fact

1276
01:09:15,660 --> 01:09:18,780
that Mario Kart has just kind of taken F-Zero's place.

1277
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:24,020
And that was kind of solidified when they fucking put the F-Zero track in Mario Kart.

1278
01:09:24,020 --> 01:09:27,380
Yeah, but I think that's just a throwback thing.

1279
01:09:27,380 --> 01:09:29,140
I don't think that's necessarily anything.

1280
01:09:29,140 --> 01:09:32,840
It's not like Mario Kart replaced Animal Crossing or Zelda.

1281
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:34,560
So I mean, they had tracks from those.

1282
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:35,560
So I don't know.

1283
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:39,100
I just think that it was, they wanted to do a track and they're like, oh, hey, our

1284
01:09:39,100 --> 01:09:41,060
cars kind of stick to things and it works.

1285
01:09:41,060 --> 01:09:43,300
I mean, Mario Kart 8 is no F-Zero.

1286
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:47,420
Anyway, Act Def says, seriously, where's my Kirby direct?

1287
01:09:47,420 --> 01:09:48,660
It's the 25th anniversary.

1288
01:09:48,660 --> 01:09:52,380
Well, to be fair, Act Def, it's January, so there's time.

1289
01:09:52,380 --> 01:09:56,420
But what you can pray for right now is that Kirby will get more acknowledgement than Metroid

1290
01:09:56,420 --> 01:09:57,420
got.

1291
01:09:57,420 --> 01:09:58,420
I'm just saying.

1292
01:09:58,420 --> 01:09:59,420
Let's see.

1293
01:09:59,420 --> 01:10:02,860
And Akuma JP says, Japanese love their Fire Emblem.

1294
01:10:02,860 --> 01:10:03,860
That's true.

1295
01:10:03,860 --> 01:10:07,620
I mean, Fire Emblem was a series in Japan for a long time before we ever saw it.

1296
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:13,060
And really, I kind of think we can thank Smash Brothers for finally getting Fire Emblem

1297
01:10:13,060 --> 01:10:17,500
over here because a lot of people were asking, who's these characters?

1298
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:20,900
Why are they, it's too bad that same logic hasn't worked for Mother 3, but at least we

1299
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:21,900
had Earthbound.

1300
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:22,900
Yeah.

1301
01:10:22,900 --> 01:10:29,780
I mean, F-Zero, they had the 25th anniversary two years ago for that.

1302
01:10:29,780 --> 01:10:30,780
No new F-Zero yet.

1303
01:10:30,780 --> 01:10:31,780
No, not yet.

1304
01:10:31,780 --> 01:10:32,780
Where's the love?

1305
01:10:32,780 --> 01:10:33,780
Where's the love?

1306
01:10:33,780 --> 01:10:34,780
I don't know.

1307
01:10:34,780 --> 01:10:36,020
Anyway, so about the direct.

1308
01:10:36,020 --> 01:10:39,660
So for Fire Emblem fans, and even if you're a non-fan, maybe this is your chance to get

1309
01:10:39,660 --> 01:10:43,300
involved with the series because it's definitely going to show up everywhere.

1310
01:10:43,300 --> 01:10:47,540
For a series that was almost dead a few years ago, Nintendo was like, if you don't sell

1311
01:10:47,540 --> 01:10:49,760
a quarter million of these, we're done.

1312
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:51,620
This is a remarkable turnaround for Fire Emblem.

1313
01:10:51,620 --> 01:10:52,620
So good for them.

1314
01:10:52,620 --> 01:10:57,100
But anyway, Fire Emblem Echoes Shadows of Valentia has been announced.

1315
01:10:57,100 --> 01:11:01,380
It's going to be a 3DS game, which I found interesting because I was ready to say, oh,

1316
01:11:01,380 --> 01:11:05,500
the 3DS is done as a Pokemon Sun and Moon, but that doesn't appear to be the case.

1317
01:11:05,980 --> 01:11:08,300
You got to keep pumping money in that just in case.

1318
01:11:08,300 --> 01:11:11,580
I guess, but wow, that was kind of surprising me.

1319
01:11:11,580 --> 01:11:13,700
And now it's kind of like, well, why not just put it on the Switch?

1320
01:11:13,700 --> 01:11:15,340
Because that's your new portable system.

1321
01:11:15,340 --> 01:11:18,780
Well, Fire Emblem will be getting a Switch game in 2018.

1322
01:11:18,780 --> 01:11:21,420
That was something else that they announced during this.

1323
01:11:21,420 --> 01:11:24,740
So not only is there going to be the 3DS game, but there is going to be a Fire Emblem Switch

1324
01:11:24,740 --> 01:11:27,460
game in 2018.

1325
01:11:27,460 --> 01:11:32,060
It is going to be the first console game since Radiant Dawn, which was released in 2008.

1326
01:11:32,060 --> 01:11:34,580
So that's a pretty big deal.

1327
01:11:34,700 --> 01:11:37,460
Fire Emblem Heroes also coming out.

1328
01:11:37,460 --> 01:11:40,320
This is Nintendo's next smartphone game.

1329
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:43,700
So it's the follow-up of sorts to Super Mario Run.

1330
01:11:43,700 --> 01:11:46,620
But we knew they'd been working on Fire Emblem and Animal Crossing games.

1331
01:11:46,620 --> 01:11:47,820
So here we go.

1332
01:11:47,820 --> 01:11:50,820
Fire Emblem Heroes is on its way.

1333
01:11:50,820 --> 01:11:55,180
Originally in the presentation said it would only be on Google Play right away, but after

1334
01:11:55,180 --> 01:11:59,460
the fact came out and clarified, it will be a simultaneous release on both platforms.

1335
01:11:59,460 --> 01:12:04,200
February 2nd is the day, so that's not far away really for Fire Emblem Heroes.

1336
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:08,280
This may be a good way for people like me who are kind of, I don't know, I don't really

1337
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:13,120
like tactical RPG, but hey, when you put the price tag of free on it, I'll check it out.

1338
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:14,120
Right?

1339
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:15,120
So.

1340
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:16,120
Well.

1341
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:20,000
Well, BS, but there are going to be microtransactions in the game.

1342
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,720
So we'll see how bad it is.

1343
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:24,760
I can't believe they have actually, like, you know, I know they did that with Super

1344
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:31,340
Mario Run on iOS and I just figured it was, you know, Apple being retarded.

1345
01:12:31,340 --> 01:12:34,460
But they had, you know, the whole, like, notify me.

1346
01:12:34,460 --> 01:12:38,920
It's almost like a pre-order for a free-to-play game, like, dude, nobody needs to fucking

1347
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:41,460
notify me that there's something on the market, you know.

1348
01:12:41,460 --> 01:12:42,460
I don't care.

1349
01:12:42,460 --> 01:12:44,720
I have something that notifies me way faster.

1350
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:48,820
It's called Twitter, just for the record, but even with that notify thing, it didn't

1351
01:12:48,820 --> 01:12:49,820
even really work.

1352
01:12:49,820 --> 01:12:52,940
Like, people got notified, like, mid-day after the game had already been out.

1353
01:12:52,940 --> 01:12:57,700
It worked as well as the fucking Amazon notify me when the Switch becomes in stock.

1354
01:12:57,700 --> 01:12:58,700
Twice.

1355
01:12:58,700 --> 01:12:59,900
Twice it was for sale.

1356
01:12:59,900 --> 01:13:02,740
Twice it did not fucking send one single notification.

1357
01:13:02,740 --> 01:13:05,500
I was signed up for that too and it never did send, did it?

1358
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:06,500
We never, yeah.

1359
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:08,060
It's like, what's the point, Amazon?

1360
01:13:08,060 --> 01:13:11,020
Why even have that if you're not gonna fucking use it?

1361
01:13:11,020 --> 01:13:19,180
Anyway, let's see, Fire Emblem Warriors also will be coming to the new Nintendo 3DS and

1362
01:13:19,180 --> 01:13:25,680
that of course is the, like, Hyrule Warriors Musou game.

1363
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:28,780
What the hell was the original of that series?

1364
01:13:28,780 --> 01:13:29,780
Why can't I remember all this?

1365
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:33,180
Thank you, Dynasty Warriors-esque type of game.

1366
01:13:33,180 --> 01:13:37,740
That will be also on the new Nintendo 3DS.

1367
01:13:37,740 --> 01:13:41,020
Interesting that they say just new Nintendo 3DS.

1368
01:13:41,020 --> 01:13:44,340
My thought is they have now written off the old 3DS.

1369
01:13:44,340 --> 01:13:45,340
Oh, yeah.

1370
01:13:45,340 --> 01:13:46,340
Interesting.

1371
01:13:46,340 --> 01:13:47,340
Yeah, I didn't.

1372
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:48,340
Yeah.

1373
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:49,340
Stupid.

1374
01:13:49,340 --> 01:13:53,060
Yeah, seeing as I still haven't bought a new 3DS, that doesn't bode well for me, but

1375
01:13:53,060 --> 01:13:56,060
I don't know, anyway.

1376
01:13:56,060 --> 01:13:58,980
That's pretty much what I wanted to say on Fire Emblem.

1377
01:13:59,380 --> 01:14:04,020
Did they come out and clarify that it would work on the older 3DS as well?

1378
01:14:04,020 --> 01:14:08,820
I don't think it will because, if it's the Warriors game, just because I think that they

1379
01:14:08,820 --> 01:14:18,420
did that for the new 3DS for Hyrule Warriors and it ran like shit on the regular 3DS.

1380
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:20,980
And Act F confirms it's new 3DS only.

1381
01:14:20,980 --> 01:14:21,980
Wow.

1382
01:14:21,980 --> 01:14:23,260
Well, alright.

1383
01:14:23,260 --> 01:14:24,260
Good luck with that strategy.

1384
01:14:24,260 --> 01:14:25,260
Guess I better buy a new 3DS.

1385
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:26,260
Oh, nope.

1386
01:14:26,260 --> 01:14:27,260
Nope.

1387
01:14:27,260 --> 01:14:28,260
Not gonna do it.

1388
01:14:28,540 --> 01:14:30,980
I still have the Switch, so I can always get the Switch version, but...

1389
01:14:30,980 --> 01:14:35,420
Yeah, I mean, it's not gonna be an underpowered system or anything, so...

1390
01:14:35,420 --> 01:14:36,420
Alright.

1391
01:14:36,420 --> 01:14:37,420
Anyhow.

1392
01:14:37,420 --> 01:14:38,420
Do you want to do this piece?

1393
01:14:38,420 --> 01:14:42,460
So, we have to divvy up Dark Sakura's stories, because she was slotted on our list here,

1394
01:14:42,460 --> 01:14:43,460
but she's not here.

1395
01:14:43,460 --> 01:14:47,220
She had to cancel last minute, so do you want to do this one, Loki?

1396
01:14:47,220 --> 01:14:48,220
Sure.

1397
01:14:48,220 --> 01:14:53,420
So, apparently some Zelda fans have uncovered the Breath of the Wild backstory from the

1398
01:14:53,420 --> 01:14:54,940
Special Edition map.

1399
01:14:54,940 --> 01:15:02,500
So they were showing off the map on the whole Treehouse livestream, and apparently people

1400
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:08,340
have decoded the Hyrulean language on there, and so they've kind of gotten the backstory.

1401
01:15:08,340 --> 01:15:11,780
So here's what it says.

1402
01:15:11,780 --> 01:15:18,700
Hylians passed stories of a destined time long past where multiple races lived and worked

1403
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:20,380
together in harmony.

1404
01:15:20,380 --> 01:15:25,060
The Sheikah tribe's blue aura breathed through the land.

1405
01:15:25,060 --> 01:15:29,380
This mutual prosperity continued until cataclysmic disaster struck.

1406
01:15:29,380 --> 01:15:34,020
The hero and the princess attempted to seal the terror, which became known as the Calamity

1407
01:15:34,020 --> 01:15:35,020
Ganon.

1408
01:15:35,020 --> 01:15:36,020
Ooh, Calamity Ganon.

1409
01:15:36,020 --> 01:15:39,020
That's not just regular Ganon, that's Calamity Ganon.

1410
01:15:39,020 --> 01:15:41,460
I like Calamity Jane.

1411
01:15:41,460 --> 01:15:47,740
Divine beasts awoke from four directions and deployed a mechanical army, which made the

1412
01:15:47,740 --> 01:15:49,700
king and his people fearful.

1413
01:15:49,700 --> 01:15:56,220
They fractured Ganon's powers and sealed him, but the Sheikahs were banished from the

1414
01:15:56,220 --> 01:15:58,820
land ever since.

1415
01:15:58,820 --> 01:16:01,620
So it's Zelda.

1416
01:16:01,620 --> 01:16:07,400
Ganon rose to power, they broke up the Triforce, it's fucking Zelda.

1417
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:12,740
And that's okay, because that's the game we all want to play, so that sounds fine by me.

1418
01:16:12,740 --> 01:16:16,020
Anyhow, I hope that was, I hope that some people would have considered what we just

1419
01:16:16,020 --> 01:16:20,180
talked about, spoilers, but I really think there's a lot more layers to this game than

1420
01:16:20,180 --> 01:16:21,180
that one little piece.

1421
01:16:21,180 --> 01:16:25,140
So I hope your feathers weren't ruffled by us going over that, but it is, it is traveling

1422
01:16:25,140 --> 01:16:26,140
around.

1423
01:16:26,140 --> 01:16:27,140
It's a backstory.

1424
01:16:27,140 --> 01:16:28,140
I mean, it's like, it's fucking Zelda.

1425
01:16:28,140 --> 01:16:29,260
Everybody wants to know about this new Zelda.

1426
01:16:29,260 --> 01:16:34,380
They haven't, for all, you know, that's out there, they haven't said a lot about it.

1427
01:16:34,380 --> 01:16:37,740
I mean, sure, they've showed the game, they have the trailer and so forth, but we haven't,

1428
01:16:37,740 --> 01:16:41,420
we don't know a lot about the story, so it'd be interesting to see where it goes.

1429
01:16:41,420 --> 01:16:43,980
Anyhow, what else in gaming news, Loki?

1430
01:16:43,980 --> 01:16:44,980
All right.

1431
01:16:45,020 --> 01:16:49,780
So apparently the developer of the last Guitar Hero game, Freestyle Games, has been acquired

1432
01:16:49,780 --> 01:16:50,780
by Ubisoft.

1433
01:16:50,780 --> 01:16:55,540
Does that mean that they're going to work on something else?

1434
01:16:55,540 --> 01:16:57,660
Rocksmith, maybe?

1435
01:16:57,660 --> 01:17:00,020
I'm hoping not, though, because remember Freestyle is...

1436
01:17:00,020 --> 01:17:01,020
Or just Dance.

1437
01:17:01,020 --> 01:17:03,860
Eh, fuck just Dance.

1438
01:17:03,860 --> 01:17:06,860
Because Freestyle Games, remember, they did the DJ Hero franchise.

1439
01:17:06,860 --> 01:17:07,860
Yeah.

1440
01:17:07,860 --> 01:17:08,860
So...

1441
01:17:08,860 --> 01:17:11,660
Please, another DJ Hero game.

1442
01:17:11,660 --> 01:17:14,340
Or DJ something else game.

1443
01:17:14,740 --> 01:17:16,740
A DJ Smith type of game.

1444
01:17:16,740 --> 01:17:17,740
DJ Smith?

1445
01:17:17,740 --> 01:17:19,740
Maybe, I don't know, I don't know, maybe.

1446
01:17:19,740 --> 01:17:20,740
Beat Smith?

1447
01:17:20,740 --> 01:17:21,740
Maybe.

1448
01:17:21,740 --> 01:17:22,740
Dubstep Smith?

1449
01:17:22,740 --> 01:17:28,860
Well, I'm just glad to hear they're not closing, because their games, as far as I've heard,

1450
01:17:28,860 --> 01:17:32,660
have kind of underperformed, but I really feel like it's not their fault.

1451
01:17:32,660 --> 01:17:36,820
Like a lot of what happened at the DJ Hero and the Guitar Hero era was just like saturation

1452
01:17:36,820 --> 01:17:37,820
in the market of music games.

1453
01:17:37,820 --> 01:17:43,660
It's fucking Ubisoft, because they decided to have so many developers making just fucking

1454
01:17:43,660 --> 01:17:47,060
million Guitar Hero games, like they have four Guitar Hero games coming out each year,

1455
01:17:47,060 --> 01:17:48,780
which is too much.

1456
01:17:48,780 --> 01:17:54,580
And then on top of that, a lot of these other studios get rolled into fucking Call of Duty,

1457
01:17:54,580 --> 01:17:59,580
where they're just like, oh, we got four different studios working on Call of Duty, and some

1458
01:17:59,580 --> 01:18:01,700
working on DLC.

1459
01:18:01,700 --> 01:18:06,220
That would be where these guys would end up, had they not been purchased.

1460
01:18:06,220 --> 01:18:07,220
Yeah, that's really...

1461
01:18:07,220 --> 01:18:12,660
And so what the last thing they really did was Guitar Hero Live, which was like the reboot

1462
01:18:12,660 --> 01:18:17,380
of Guitar Hero, which really wasn't bad at all, but like, I think people were just like...

1463
01:18:17,380 --> 01:18:18,380
They don't care.

1464
01:18:18,380 --> 01:18:19,380
They don't care.

1465
01:18:19,380 --> 01:18:21,020
It doesn't have the impact anymore than it used to do.

1466
01:18:21,020 --> 01:18:24,260
So I'd be curious to see what Freestyle Games, but like you mentioned, they also do Call

1467
01:18:24,260 --> 01:18:29,260
of Duty stuff now, so they kind of have a very broad range of stuff they do, so it'll

1468
01:18:29,260 --> 01:18:32,720
be very interesting to see what they do when they team up with Ubisoft and what ends up

1469
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:33,720
coming out.

1470
01:18:33,720 --> 01:18:38,620
But I imagine we won't hear anything until E3 at the earliest, if then, because projects

1471
01:18:38,620 --> 01:18:39,620
take time.

1472
01:18:40,180 --> 01:18:42,740
We may not hear anything until 2018, for all we know.

1473
01:18:42,740 --> 01:18:47,340
Anyhow, something you can do right now, especially if you have a PlayStation VR, you know, there

1474
01:18:47,340 --> 01:18:52,620
was a lot of VR games that hit early on when the thing first came out, but now it's been

1475
01:18:52,620 --> 01:18:54,340
drying up a little bit, even though it is January.

1476
01:18:54,340 --> 01:18:57,740
It hasn't been drying up, but there's just not a whole ton of like really great stuff.

1477
01:18:57,740 --> 01:18:58,740
Not a lot of compelling software, yeah.

1478
01:18:58,740 --> 01:19:02,240
Like they have that rollercoaster game that was supposed to be coming out that came out

1479
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:03,980
and was just shit.

1480
01:19:03,980 --> 01:19:07,100
It was absolute dog shit.

1481
01:19:07,100 --> 01:19:11,820
So that was unfortunate, but there's not like really big games coming out for VR.

1482
01:19:11,820 --> 01:19:17,500
I mean, aside from Resident Evil 7, which is supposed to be next week, but beyond that,

1483
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:19,540
there's not a whole ton on the horizon.

1484
01:19:19,540 --> 01:19:24,660
Well, something that's an added benefit now for PlayStation VR is that there is now support

1485
01:19:24,660 --> 01:19:28,420
for 360 degree videos on YouTube.

1486
01:19:28,420 --> 01:19:33,700
So the app has been updated, so you can actually look at these 360 degree videos.

1487
01:19:33,780 --> 01:19:38,580
Granted, there aren't a ton of them, but the New York Times, I guess, has a daily 360 video

1488
01:19:38,580 --> 01:19:39,980
that they do.

1489
01:19:39,980 --> 01:19:45,620
So I mentioned a lot of times when these new technologies come out, like you see the 4K

1490
01:19:45,620 --> 01:19:50,120
TVs on display at, you know, your local Best Buy or whatever.

1491
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:55,860
They're always showing either like a sports thing or it's nature.

1492
01:19:55,860 --> 01:20:01,180
Like let's explore the insides of a volcano and you can see it in high definition and

1493
01:20:01,300 --> 01:20:03,820
you can make out every single rock that's there.

1494
01:20:03,820 --> 01:20:06,700
So I imagine these are the type of videos that are available on YouTube.

1495
01:20:06,700 --> 01:20:10,260
I don't have a PSVR, but I imagine these are the type of things that are available on YouTube

1496
01:20:10,260 --> 01:20:11,500
360, right?

1497
01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:13,220
Explore the insides of a volcano.

1498
01:20:13,220 --> 01:20:15,260
I haven't done that, but I've done them on my phone and stuff.

1499
01:20:15,260 --> 01:20:18,900
National Geographic goes to the rainforest, those types of things.

1500
01:20:18,900 --> 01:20:21,460
Yeah, I mean, it's just that kind of thing.

1501
01:20:21,460 --> 01:20:24,820
I mean, it's, I don't know, they're okay.

1502
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:27,700
Like I watched them with like dolphins running along a boat or something.

1503
01:20:27,700 --> 01:20:28,700
Oh, the dolphins are cute.

1504
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:29,700
It was all right.

1505
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:30,700
It's like, okay.

1506
01:20:31,220 --> 01:20:36,540
A lot of them I find, you know, the 360 videos, it's like they really, I mean, there's really

1507
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:39,140
no need for them to be 360.

1508
01:20:39,140 --> 01:20:40,140
I don't know.

1509
01:20:40,140 --> 01:20:46,740
Let's get a 360 video of a guar concert or something that I can just really be there

1510
01:20:46,740 --> 01:20:47,740
in the middle of things.

1511
01:20:47,740 --> 01:20:54,060
I want, I want, I want that guy to like inhale blood and then spit it all over the camera

1512
01:20:54,060 --> 01:20:56,300
at one of these like death metal shows.

1513
01:20:56,300 --> 01:20:59,740
That's what I want to do on YouTube 360 because I'm getting too old for a mosh pit.

1514
01:20:59,780 --> 01:21:02,300
So wouldn't that be an exciting experience?

1515
01:21:02,300 --> 01:21:05,920
Would you, would you watch a rock concert?

1516
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:09,460
Maybe once.

1517
01:21:09,460 --> 01:21:10,460
Maybe one.

1518
01:21:10,460 --> 01:21:11,460
I don't know.

1519
01:21:11,460 --> 01:21:17,100
It's just, I tried, I guess I still have to try it out.

1520
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:19,100
I haven't bothered to mess with that.

1521
01:21:19,100 --> 01:21:20,460
I played a lot of Yarsa.

1522
01:21:20,460 --> 01:21:26,700
I actually have, was it, I purchased, um, last sale, I think, um, that whole, um, Oh,

1523
01:21:27,260 --> 01:21:29,780
what the hell is it called now?

1524
01:21:29,780 --> 01:21:35,500
It was, it said the bar VR one where he actually can like throw bottles and like you could,

1525
01:21:35,500 --> 01:21:40,820
you can play, you can play games like you can play billiards and skeeball and shuffle

1526
01:21:40,820 --> 01:21:43,460
board and darts and all that stuff.

1527
01:21:43,460 --> 01:21:47,300
Or you can stack chairs, you can throw bottles, you can do all sorts of, and it's multiplayer

1528
01:21:47,300 --> 01:21:48,300
so you can play with other people.

1529
01:21:48,300 --> 01:21:49,300
You can throw bottles at people?

1530
01:21:49,300 --> 01:21:51,040
You can throw bottles at people.

1531
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:52,040
Bar fight.

1532
01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:53,040
Yeah, you could.

1533
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:56,580
You could do a bar fight or you can like stack chairs and then like knock them over or you

1534
01:21:56,580 --> 01:22:01,580
can, you know, just cheat and skeeball by like crawling up the, you know, skeeball thing

1535
01:22:01,580 --> 01:22:02,580
to drop the balls in.

1536
01:22:02,580 --> 01:22:04,860
Best use of VR yet.

1537
01:22:04,860 --> 01:22:10,460
It's pretty silly, but, um, more of that stuff please.

1538
01:22:10,460 --> 01:22:14,900
To register participation for this week's episode of orange lounge radio at vognetwork.com,

1539
01:22:14,900 --> 01:22:16,380
use the pass phrase option.

1540
01:22:16,380 --> 01:22:22,020
All right, well, uh, valve, uh, obviously they are behind the HTC Vive and hopefully

1541
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:24,900
they're going to be developing some more VR games.

1542
01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:29,740
Uh, and it has been talked about this week that valve does have more unannounced games

1543
01:22:29,740 --> 01:22:31,460
in the work works.

1544
01:22:31,460 --> 01:22:37,220
And this is straight from the Gabe himself because he did a AMA on Reddit.

1545
01:22:37,220 --> 01:22:42,580
Uh, and the question that was asked was, is valve still working on any fully fledged single

1546
01:22:42,580 --> 01:22:44,020
player games?

1547
01:22:44,020 --> 01:22:49,740
And the answer that Gabe Newell gave was yes, that's it.

1548
01:22:49,740 --> 01:22:56,100
Just, yes, very direct and to the point, I don't really care about sequels and stuff,

1549
01:22:56,100 --> 01:23:01,380
but like, I'm just glad they're working on something because like, honestly they haven't

1550
01:23:01,380 --> 01:23:06,020
had a lot come out recently and I used to like it when it was like, when they were releasing

1551
01:23:06,020 --> 01:23:09,460
more stuff for you, like left for dead and portal and all that stuff, I'd be just happy

1552
01:23:09,460 --> 01:23:13,820
for a sequel for anything or something new even just because all their stuff is pretty

1553
01:23:13,820 --> 01:23:14,820
fantastic.

1554
01:23:15,260 --> 01:23:19,740
And apparently Gabe also replied to like a half-life three question and wrote a very

1555
01:23:19,740 --> 01:23:23,140
tongue in cheek, the number three must not be said.

1556
01:23:23,140 --> 01:23:25,380
So Gabe is self-aware everybody.

1557
01:23:25,380 --> 01:23:27,740
So yes, I'm sure he is aware of the internet.

1558
01:23:27,740 --> 01:23:28,740
I'm sure.

1559
01:23:28,740 --> 01:23:29,740
Yes.

1560
01:23:29,740 --> 01:23:33,180
Gabe has apparently heard of the internet and has seen your memes.

1561
01:23:33,180 --> 01:23:34,420
Look out everybody.

1562
01:23:34,420 --> 01:23:35,420
He's listening.

1563
01:23:35,420 --> 01:23:36,420
Anyway.

1564
01:23:36,420 --> 01:23:41,100
Uh, yeah, no clues really in the AMA what else is going on, but, uh, he did say as part

1565
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:45,100
of the AMA that, uh, they are trying to get more games on the source engine.

1566
01:23:45,100 --> 01:23:49,180
And that is the foundation of some unannounced projects.

1567
01:23:49,180 --> 01:23:50,180
So there it is.

1568
01:23:50,180 --> 01:23:54,940
He said, listen, we are not making any games with the name, with the number three in the

1569
01:23:54,940 --> 01:24:01,820
title period, uh, dungeon Buster in chat says, uh, are you working on something?

1570
01:24:01,820 --> 01:24:02,820
Yes.

1571
01:24:02,820 --> 01:24:04,540
Internet loses its collective shit.

1572
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:05,540
Pretty much SSG.

1573
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:06,540
One hundred.

1574
01:24:06,540 --> 01:24:08,380
Matt says, Gabe has seen your dank memes.

1575
01:24:08,380 --> 01:24:12,660
He's unimpressed pretty much.

1576
01:24:12,660 --> 01:24:14,860
Let's all hope Gabe doesn't listen to this show.

1577
01:24:14,860 --> 01:24:23,140
Uh, anyway, uh, dark Tetsuya jokes, half-life two episode 2.2 see that no three in there.

1578
01:24:23,140 --> 01:24:25,500
Oh, there'll be a new half-life game.

1579
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:27,700
It'll be like a remastered half-life game.

1580
01:24:27,700 --> 01:24:30,660
It'll be a half, half-life full life.

1581
01:24:30,660 --> 01:24:32,260
Uh, all right.

1582
01:24:32,260 --> 01:24:36,100
Uh, Loki what's next before we get to the classic game of the week here soon half for

1583
01:24:36,100 --> 01:24:37,100
life.

1584
01:24:37,100 --> 01:24:38,100
Okay.

1585
01:24:38,100 --> 01:24:49,340
Um, so Nintendo, um, you know, they had, they've released, you know, Super Mario Brothers for,

1586
01:24:49,340 --> 01:24:51,660
you know, many times on virtual console.

1587
01:24:51,660 --> 01:24:58,340
Well, the Wii, um, I want to say the, yeah, the Wii version of the game, um, apparently

1588
01:24:58,340 --> 01:25:04,120
someone dug through the actual files on virtual console and they found out that there's, um,

1589
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:08,160
some lines of code from a header from an NES file.

1590
01:25:08,160 --> 01:25:13,400
Now those NES files were built originally for emulators.

1591
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:21,960
Um, so this basically isn't necessarily a dump from the ROM because this was added specifically

1592
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:29,360
to those things to, you know, point the emulator to the right, um, ROM files to read.

1593
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:35,080
So what's kind of funny is this file actually existed on the internet prior to the Wii.

1594
01:25:35,080 --> 01:25:43,960
So it's almost like that they downloaded the ROM and then resold it to you and the ultimate

1595
01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:44,960
irony.

1596
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:45,960
Yeah, I know.

1597
01:25:45,960 --> 01:25:49,640
It's one of those things where I noticed there's, there seems to be a lot of rage around this

1598
01:25:49,640 --> 01:25:54,000
story or whatever, like how dare Nintendo sell us, uh, this product.

1599
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:58,800
But I'm kind of like, well, it's kind of a funny gotcha in a way.

1600
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:00,000
It's not a funny gotcha.

1601
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,000
It's basically...

1602
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:02,000
What?

1603
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,000
Why not?

1604
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:04,000
It's their fucking game.

1605
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,000
Let them do what they want.

1606
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:06,000
Well, right.

1607
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:10,400
I understand that, but, and it is technically their property, but it's like someone dumped

1608
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:11,400
it.

1609
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:12,400
Okay.

1610
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:13,400
Let me, I'm trying to think of the best way to describe this.

1611
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:20,600
So like, um, imagine that somebody, okay, here's a good example.

1612
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:25,640
I think that we can liken this to like someone fan translating a game and then they decided

1613
01:26:25,640 --> 01:26:31,520
to sell the game online with those translations, you know, technically it's their thing.

1614
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:38,320
It's something that was added to the game, you know, um, modified to the actual ROM file

1615
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:41,640
and then they're reselling it because, hey, it's our property and we would just sue you

1616
01:26:41,640 --> 01:26:42,640
anyways.

1617
01:26:42,640 --> 01:26:48,560
I mean, it's a, such a minor thing though for this NES ROM, which is kind of funny.

1618
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:52,580
I think it's one of those funny, like, haha, you know, they tell us not to download ROMs

1619
01:26:52,580 --> 01:26:55,860
and here they are downloading ROMs and reselling them.

1620
01:26:55,860 --> 01:27:00,700
Well, but it, it took a long time to figure this out.

1621
01:27:00,700 --> 01:27:04,060
I mean, how long is Super Mario Brothers been on the Wii Virtual Console?

1622
01:27:04,060 --> 01:27:05,660
The Wii's a 10 year old system now.

1623
01:27:05,660 --> 01:27:09,600
I don't, I don't remember what was out day one for Virtual Console, but I can't imagine

1624
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:10,600
this wasn't one of them.

1625
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:13,180
So it's been like 10 years until people figured this out.

1626
01:27:13,180 --> 01:27:14,180
Right?

1627
01:27:14,180 --> 01:27:15,180
Yeah.

1628
01:27:15,180 --> 01:27:18,500
I'm just surprised they didn't redump it themselves, but I guess the data would be the same, but

1629
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:20,740
the header thing that's kind of interesting.

1630
01:27:20,740 --> 01:27:26,580
I wonder if it actually uses the header in their emulator or if their emulator is based

1631
01:27:26,580 --> 01:27:30,780
off of like, you know, one of the NES emulators out there.

1632
01:27:30,780 --> 01:27:31,780
Hmm.

1633
01:27:31,780 --> 01:27:32,780
All right.

1634
01:27:32,780 --> 01:27:37,660
Well, uh, let's see, I gotta get to one more story here and then we'll, uh, give Dark Sakura

1635
01:27:37,660 --> 01:27:42,780
a call to do our classic console of the week, but, uh, speaking of Zelda and the Wii U,

1636
01:27:42,780 --> 01:27:48,420
it was confirmed this week that Breath of the Wild will be the last Wii U game and that

1637
01:27:48,420 --> 01:27:52,140
was confirmed by Reggie Fils-Aime, the man, of course, at Nintendo's America.

1638
01:27:52,140 --> 01:27:54,580
I'd assume that's the last Nintendo first party, right?

1639
01:27:54,580 --> 01:27:55,580
Right.

1640
01:27:55,580 --> 01:27:58,180
From a first party standpoint, there's no new development coming after the launch of

1641
01:27:58,180 --> 01:27:59,180
Breath of the Wild.

1642
01:27:59,180 --> 01:28:00,180
Okay.

1643
01:28:00,180 --> 01:28:02,860
But to be fair, I mean, sure, maybe a third party will put something out, but like even

1644
01:28:02,860 --> 01:28:04,980
the Indies started jumping ship, right?

1645
01:28:04,980 --> 01:28:07,420
Everybody's like, nope, we're developing for the Switch now and if you kickstart it on

1646
01:28:07,420 --> 01:28:09,700
Wii U, we can move that over or whatever.

1647
01:28:09,700 --> 01:28:13,340
But he also said we really are at the end of life for Wii U.

1648
01:28:13,340 --> 01:28:16,500
So, um, confirmed that that is, that's it.

1649
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:17,500
Pretty sad.

1650
01:28:17,580 --> 01:28:18,580
Didn't last that long.

1651
01:28:18,580 --> 01:28:21,980
No, Wii U really didn't last that long, but we kind of, it's not surprising though.

1652
01:28:21,980 --> 01:28:25,940
Nintendo really wants to shift the conversation, you know, everybody's written off the Wii

1653
01:28:25,940 --> 01:28:26,940
U at this point.

1654
01:28:26,940 --> 01:28:28,580
So Nintendo really wants to shift the conversation.

1655
01:28:28,580 --> 01:28:33,420
They wrote it off because of the underpowered system with underpowered specs that didn't

1656
01:28:33,420 --> 01:28:37,100
have third party support, kind of like their new system.

1657
01:28:37,100 --> 01:28:40,860
I mean, so what makes you think that this is not going to fucking be a whole repeat

1658
01:28:40,860 --> 01:28:41,860
of this thing?

1659
01:28:41,860 --> 01:28:46,780
Just because, oh, I can take it somewhere and, but when the novelty novelty runs off

1660
01:28:46,780 --> 01:28:53,540
on that, like it just runs out, I just, I just think they're not learning their lesson

1661
01:28:53,540 --> 01:28:54,540
is the thing.

1662
01:28:54,540 --> 01:29:00,220
Well, they, they don't really have a lot of, like if the Switch is a failure, then Nintendo

1663
01:29:00,220 --> 01:29:02,380
is going to be, I don't know what's going to happen.

1664
01:29:02,380 --> 01:29:05,740
Put out a heart, put out a console that has some fucking muscle in it.

1665
01:29:05,740 --> 01:29:06,740
That's what you need to do.

1666
01:29:06,740 --> 01:29:09,620
You'll, oh, your console's not going to be the cheapest.

1667
01:29:09,620 --> 01:29:16,260
Big fucking deal if you have the games and the support from third party, it won't matter.

1668
01:29:16,260 --> 01:29:20,180
You know, something that was posed to me the other day, which I think is worth asking is

1669
01:29:20,180 --> 01:29:27,020
that what if Nintendo can add a little oomph in that dock because they could sell theoretically

1670
01:29:27,020 --> 01:29:31,020
a dock that would be capable of 4k and all this other stuff for the system, right?

1671
01:29:31,020 --> 01:29:36,900
They could do a little bit more of an incremental upgrade a la PlayStation four pro or a project

1672
01:29:36,900 --> 01:29:40,020
Scorpio, but even cheaper because it would just be the dock.

1673
01:29:40,020 --> 01:29:41,020
I don't think so.

1674
01:29:41,020 --> 01:29:44,780
And the reason for that is because I think that the way that it actually interfaces with

1675
01:29:44,780 --> 01:29:47,220
the dock is it's just outputting.

1676
01:29:47,220 --> 01:29:52,820
It's basically extending HDMI out from the system and adding a power source.

1677
01:29:52,820 --> 01:29:55,660
So I don't think that, I have to actually take a look at the system, but I don't think

1678
01:29:55,660 --> 01:29:58,820
it's like some sort of, you know, new thing.

1679
01:29:58,820 --> 01:30:04,620
I bet it's just like HDMI out and power in and that's it.

1680
01:30:04,620 --> 01:30:08,180
You know, it may be something that, it might even not even necessarily be something that

1681
01:30:08,180 --> 01:30:09,820
tells it it's in the dock mode.

1682
01:30:09,820 --> 01:30:14,820
That could be just when it receives power from the video signal through the HDMI port

1683
01:30:14,820 --> 01:30:19,380
that it's, okay, now I'm in portable or docked mode or something like that, but I don't think

1684
01:30:19,380 --> 01:30:22,360
that they're going to be able to add any extra processing to it.

1685
01:30:22,360 --> 01:30:26,940
What they probably will do later on down the road is release a system that's 1080p handheld

1686
01:30:26,940 --> 01:30:32,740
and you know, maybe a little bit beefed up specs or something like they do with all their

1687
01:30:32,740 --> 01:30:33,740
other systems.

1688
01:30:33,740 --> 01:30:39,420
It's just, I'm just, I'm very concerned by this.

1689
01:30:39,420 --> 01:30:41,820
This is one of the reasons I'm very hesitant about the system.

1690
01:30:41,820 --> 01:30:46,980
It's like, I like the idea of a portable system, but I think I'm just buying into the hype

1691
01:30:46,980 --> 01:30:50,100
too much and I, I don't know.

1692
01:30:50,100 --> 01:30:54,940
Well, we will see what happens, but for now I want to get to a segment that we do on the

1693
01:30:54,940 --> 01:30:59,680
show called the classic game of the week, but what a twist.

1694
01:30:59,680 --> 01:31:02,220
It's going to be the classic system of the month tonight.

1695
01:31:02,220 --> 01:31:07,980
We're going to get our good pal Dark Sakura on the line here who's going to take us down

1696
01:31:07,980 --> 01:31:12,660
the memory lane so we can talk about a classic system of the week.

1697
01:31:12,660 --> 01:31:13,660
Hi.

1698
01:31:13,660 --> 01:31:14,660
Hi.

1699
01:31:14,660 --> 01:31:16,660
How are you?

1700
01:31:16,660 --> 01:31:20,140
Um, my face hurts.

1701
01:31:20,140 --> 01:31:21,900
Sorry about your face.

1702
01:31:21,900 --> 01:31:22,900
We miss you.

1703
01:31:22,900 --> 01:31:23,900
Me too.

1704
01:31:23,900 --> 01:31:24,900
Thank you.

1705
01:31:24,900 --> 01:31:28,900
Um, so I have a sinus infection.

1706
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:29,900
Are you wrong?

1707
01:31:29,900 --> 01:31:33,940
Are we, is Jamie really quiet for you guys or is it just me?

1708
01:31:33,940 --> 01:31:34,940
I don't know.

1709
01:31:34,940 --> 01:31:35,940
I'm talking loudly.

1710
01:31:35,940 --> 01:31:36,940
Oh yeah.

1711
01:31:36,940 --> 01:31:37,940
I don't know.

1712
01:31:37,940 --> 01:31:41,260
I mean, for some reason in studio, you're not coming through very loud, but your levels

1713
01:31:41,260 --> 01:31:44,900
for the folks that are listening at home look like they're just fine.

1714
01:31:44,900 --> 01:31:45,900
Yeah.

1715
01:31:45,900 --> 01:31:46,900
So anyway, sorry about that.

1716
01:31:46,900 --> 01:31:47,900
It's live.

1717
01:31:47,900 --> 01:31:48,900
What can you do about it?

1718
01:31:48,900 --> 01:31:49,900
Uh, how has your week been?

1719
01:31:49,900 --> 01:31:50,900
Jamie?

1720
01:31:50,900 --> 01:31:54,220
Um, kill it with fire.

1721
01:31:54,220 --> 01:31:55,220
Sorry to hear that.

1722
01:31:55,220 --> 01:31:59,980
Um, shall we take a, shall we take a trip down memory lane with the classic console

1723
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:02,260
of the week?

1724
01:32:02,260 --> 01:32:04,540
The classic console of the month.

1725
01:32:04,540 --> 01:32:06,260
Oh, excuse me.

1726
01:32:06,260 --> 01:32:07,940
The classic console of the month.

1727
01:32:07,940 --> 01:32:09,780
What did, what did you pick for us?

1728
01:32:09,780 --> 01:32:18,620
Uh, it's actually two, but they're related, uh, the FM towns and the FM towns, Marty.

1729
01:32:18,620 --> 01:32:19,620
All right.

1730
01:32:19,620 --> 01:32:21,180
The FM towns and the FM towns, Marty.

1731
01:32:21,180 --> 01:32:22,180
Hold on.

1732
01:32:22,180 --> 01:32:24,940
I'm getting, I'm getting a little bit of music up here for folks to hear.

1733
01:32:24,940 --> 01:32:25,940
Sorry.

1734
01:32:25,940 --> 01:32:28,180
Wasn't expecting you to be that loud.

1735
01:32:28,180 --> 01:32:29,180
There we go.

1736
01:32:29,180 --> 01:32:30,180
Okay.

1737
01:32:30,180 --> 01:32:32,460
It sounds like writing to me.

1738
01:32:32,460 --> 01:32:33,460
Sure is.

1739
01:32:34,460 --> 01:32:43,580
Well, the FM town, um, was a computer that was put out by Sujitsu, um, between 1989 and

1740
01:32:43,580 --> 01:32:45,580
1997.

1741
01:32:45,580 --> 01:32:51,460
It was meant to be, um, a multimedia and PC, um, gaming machine.

1742
01:32:51,460 --> 01:32:58,500
Um, in 1993, a gaming console came out called the Marty that was compatible with all the

1743
01:32:58,500 --> 01:33:00,900
existing FM towns games.

1744
01:33:01,340 --> 01:33:08,420
So the FM stands for Sujitsu Micro and towns, um, is likely coming from Charlestown to win

1745
01:33:08,420 --> 01:33:13,340
the 1964 Nobel Prize in system because at the time, Sujitsu was naming all of their

1746
01:33:13,340 --> 01:33:16,340
PC products after Nobel prize winners.

1747
01:33:16,340 --> 01:33:26,780
So the computer itself, it was an eight bit computer and, um, it had a lot of, uh, parts

1748
01:33:26,780 --> 01:33:27,780
supplied by NEC.

1749
01:33:28,660 --> 01:33:34,540
Um, so you probably will see a lot of crossover for games between that and the PC engine.

1750
01:33:34,540 --> 01:33:43,740
Um, this one also, one of the specifics with it is that it was really dedicated for, uh,

1751
01:33:43,740 --> 01:33:48,020
gaming and graphics, uh, uh, applications.

1752
01:33:48,020 --> 01:33:54,980
It ran on, um, windows three, three one and windows 95, and it had its own OS called town's

1753
01:33:54,980 --> 01:33:58,100
OS that was based off of, uh, DOS.

1754
01:33:58,100 --> 01:34:05,460
So, um, most of the games were, uh, written in assembly and C. So that gives you any kind

1755
01:34:05,460 --> 01:34:10,260
of indicator for, you know, about where it was in comparison to the other things that

1756
01:34:10,260 --> 01:34:12,180
were out at the time.

1757
01:34:12,180 --> 01:34:19,780
But, um, it also, um, had a, uh, a CD ROM in 1990.

1758
01:34:19,780 --> 01:34:24,100
So it was pretty, pretty much ahead of its time for the day.

1759
01:34:24,100 --> 01:34:30,740
Um, as for, uh, the, the Marty, the Marty actually had different iterations of it.

1760
01:34:30,740 --> 01:34:37,060
There was, uh, a version that, like I said, came out in 1993 and it was the first 32 bit

1761
01:34:37,060 --> 01:34:41,620
home video game system had a built-in CD ROM and disk drive.

1762
01:34:41,620 --> 01:34:46,420
Um, and it was meant to run, like I said, the games that were running on the, um, FM

1763
01:34:46,420 --> 01:34:47,420
town's PC.

1764
01:34:47,420 --> 01:34:55,340
There was also the FM town 42 in 1994, um, that was a little bit lower in cost and to

1765
01:34:55,340 --> 01:34:58,860
play some of the other games that had a faster CPU in it.

1766
01:34:58,860 --> 01:35:03,340
And another one that's interesting is the FM town, uh, car Marty that was built into

1767
01:35:03,340 --> 01:35:07,340
cars had, um, a GPS in it.

1768
01:35:07,340 --> 01:35:13,980
It had, um, uh, the GPS had this audio and video guidance and it could be detached from

1769
01:35:13,980 --> 01:35:16,440
the car and played at home.

1770
01:35:16,440 --> 01:35:22,400
So it was, it was pretty crazy for its time and it could run, um, its virtual resolution

1771
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:27,280
up as high as, uh, 1024 by 512 back in the day.

1772
01:35:27,280 --> 01:35:34,320
So as far as games that came out, the systems have a ton of games, um, as you can hear in

1773
01:35:34,320 --> 01:35:39,200
the background, you know, that's Raiden Densetsu, which is basically just Raiden, um, for anime

1774
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:44,760
fans, I had a bunch of the nineties anime games on it, like, uh, Sanzanai's, um, Dragon

1775
01:35:44,760 --> 01:35:52,440
Half, um, it even included some of the fighting games like Asuka 120%, um, they had Bubble

1776
01:35:52,440 --> 01:35:59,120
Bobble, uh, Chase HQ, uh, I'm trying to think if there's any more that we would have seen

1777
01:35:59,120 --> 01:36:00,120
over here.

1778
01:36:00,120 --> 01:36:04,000
Oh, Emerald Dragon, which I've actually covered before, um, for classic games, uh, God of

1779
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:09,680
Gods and Set Special, which was Fatal Fury Special over here, um, all kinds of great

1780
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:10,680
games on there.

1781
01:36:10,680 --> 01:36:18,160
And, uh, even I think the only, maybe the only, um, version of, uh, Traxton 2, so had

1782
01:36:18,160 --> 01:36:24,520
Puyo Puyo, had all kinds of interesting games, uh, Ravenloft, Return to Zor, uh, a couple

1783
01:36:24,520 --> 01:36:30,040
of the Logos board games, um, so yeah, it's a great system if you're trying to find one

1784
01:36:30,040 --> 01:36:36,720
now, they're pretty pricey, but, um, I think that there are emulators out for it, um, and

1785
01:36:36,720 --> 01:36:41,520
at the time these were pretty much the best versions of a lot of these things you could

1786
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:43,920
get at home if you had the system.

1787
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:48,000
And so that's your classic system is the FM Towns family.

1788
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,620
I have to admit, I have never played one, unfortunately.

1789
01:36:50,620 --> 01:36:54,360
Is this something that exists in the gaming vault that I just have failed to see or is

1790
01:36:54,360 --> 01:36:55,360
this-

1791
01:36:55,360 --> 01:36:58,280
No, actually I'd love to have one, but I don't actually own one.

1792
01:36:58,280 --> 01:36:59,280
Bummer.

1793
01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:02,920
Alright, y'all, you know what to get Jamie for Hanukkah next year.

1794
01:37:02,920 --> 01:37:11,640
Well, if I were to check eBay right now, let's see how much one of them costs so I can give

1795
01:37:11,640 --> 01:37:16,320
you an idea of a couple, you know, how many thousands you're gonna pay for one.

1796
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:19,400
Yeah, Kuma JP in the chat says it's too expensive.

1797
01:37:19,400 --> 01:37:20,880
I've never seen one of those.

1798
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:28,280
Uh, JD in chat says I heard about this console because Zach McCracken had a 256 color port.

1799
01:37:28,280 --> 01:37:37,400
So right now, an FM Towns Marty boxed with image site coming with it is $700 right now.

1800
01:37:37,400 --> 01:37:39,400
That's pretty pricey for an old ass computer.

1801
01:37:39,400 --> 01:37:42,040
I found a broken one for $135.

1802
01:37:42,040 --> 01:37:43,040
Oh yay.

1803
01:37:43,040 --> 01:37:47,720
And I found one that comes with POPO for right around $500.

1804
01:37:47,720 --> 01:37:50,560
So that's what you're looking at for the cost.

1805
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:51,560
Alright.

1806
01:37:51,560 --> 01:37:56,480
Well, Jamie, anything else you want to share with the listeners here before we go to break?

1807
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:57,960
Um, resist.

1808
01:37:58,640 --> 01:38:03,640
Alright, um, have a great week, feel better, and we'll see you hopefully back in studio

1809
01:38:03,640 --> 01:38:04,640
in seven days.

1810
01:38:04,640 --> 01:38:05,640
See you then.

1811
01:38:05,640 --> 01:38:06,640
Alright, bye.

1812
01:38:06,640 --> 01:38:07,640
Bye.

1813
01:38:07,640 --> 01:38:12,840
There it is, your classic console of the month.

1814
01:38:12,840 --> 01:38:15,720
With that, we're going to take a quick break, but don't go anywhere, we have plenty more

1815
01:38:15,720 --> 01:38:16,720
show to come.

1816
01:38:16,720 --> 01:38:21,640
We're going to talk a little bit when we come back about Super Mario Run, Pokemon Go, but

1817
01:38:21,640 --> 01:38:26,480
not just, not just handheld stuff, we're also going to talk about Street Fighter.

1818
01:38:26,520 --> 01:38:27,720
Is there a Street Fighter handheld?

1819
01:38:27,720 --> 01:38:30,640
I hope not because it's probably not, well, I'm talking about besides like what they did

1820
01:38:30,640 --> 01:38:32,640
on like the Game Boy and all that stuff.

1821
01:38:32,640 --> 01:38:35,320
They had Street Fighter 4 3D that was on the 3DS.

1822
01:38:35,320 --> 01:38:41,240
Yes, I was thinking mobile phone, but I feel like there is, and I'm sure that it sucks.

1823
01:38:41,240 --> 01:38:46,800
I mean, if Capcom is going to put Mega Man on mobile, you better believe that Street

1824
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:49,420
Fighter is probably not about the mobile version of it.

1825
01:38:49,420 --> 01:38:55,080
So anyway, we are going to take a break and come back with more show, including rapid

1826
01:38:55,080 --> 01:38:56,080
fire news.

1827
01:38:56,080 --> 01:39:01,880
Emails and your calls at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype, when we come back with more of Orange

1828
01:39:01,880 --> 01:39:02,880
Lounge Radio.

1829
01:39:09,680 --> 01:39:15,360
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight on the 22nd of January, 2017

1830
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:19,280
with episode number 673 of our show already in progress.

1831
01:39:19,280 --> 01:39:22,560
If you're just joining us live, you missed a really fun part A, we were talking about

1832
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:26,520
the Switch a little bit, and our pal Matt Baum joined us to talk about playing with

1833
01:39:26,520 --> 01:39:27,520
Pride.

1834
01:39:27,520 --> 01:39:29,820
So if you missed the first half of the show, I guess you're just going to have to listen

1835
01:39:29,820 --> 01:39:31,560
to it on the podcast.

1836
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:35,720
Sadly on the podcast feed though, you don't get to take music breaks with us, so you didn't

1837
01:39:35,720 --> 01:39:38,640
get to hear some of the music from Ninja Gaiden that we were playing during the break here

1838
01:39:38,640 --> 01:39:40,720
that we were doing live.

1839
01:39:40,720 --> 01:39:45,360
And did you know, Loki, I can beat Ninja Gaiden one, two, and three straight through without

1840
01:39:45,360 --> 01:39:48,640
losing a life?

1841
01:39:48,640 --> 01:39:49,640
That's pretty awesome.

1842
01:39:49,640 --> 01:39:53,360
Yeah, actually I was sharing some alternative facts with you just then, yes.

1843
01:39:53,360 --> 01:39:59,160
Sorry, I was too busy and distracted looking at Bobby's little video they posted of him

1844
01:39:59,160 --> 01:40:01,320
making snow angels out of confetti.

1845
01:40:01,320 --> 01:40:05,520
Oh, with celebrating the teams going to the Super Bowl?

1846
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:06,520
You can imagine I was a bit distracted.

1847
01:40:06,520 --> 01:40:07,520
No, that's fine, that's fine.

1848
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:11,440
I think he actually has been posting on his Twitter, like people have been photoshopping

1849
01:40:11,440 --> 01:40:15,360
him in that video, but like with other people's faces, it's crazy, I think he's becoming a

1850
01:40:15,360 --> 01:40:16,360
meme or something.

1851
01:40:16,360 --> 01:40:21,360
I'm sure he will have lots to share on his own show next week.

1852
01:40:21,360 --> 01:40:25,840
So even though I'm cracking jokes about Ninja Gaiden, I don't even think I could beat the

1853
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:27,300
first one when I was younger.

1854
01:40:27,300 --> 01:40:31,680
But I feel like I was good at video games when I was younger, like I used to be able

1855
01:40:31,680 --> 01:40:36,280
to beat stuff like Mega Man 2 that I go back and play now and it's like I keep dying over

1856
01:40:36,280 --> 01:40:40,120
and over and I don't know if it's just like I've lost the muscle memory of the levels

1857
01:40:40,120 --> 01:40:45,320
or whatever, but is there some like really hard to beat video game in your past, Loki,

1858
01:40:45,320 --> 01:40:50,300
that you beat that you're like really proud of, like I beat this video game and I am an

1859
01:40:50,300 --> 01:40:53,060
awesome gamer for doing so?

1860
01:40:53,060 --> 01:40:54,060
Um...

1861
01:40:54,060 --> 01:40:57,120
I don't know...

1862
01:40:57,120 --> 01:41:02,800
I did finish VVVVVVVVVV, except for one of the things, which was a pain in the ass and

1863
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:07,800
I didn't want to do it anymore, but I got almost, I think I finished that.

1864
01:41:07,800 --> 01:41:09,220
I beat Rygar.

1865
01:41:09,220 --> 01:41:13,360
That's probably my biggest thing, because you know Rygar, you couldn't fucking save,

1866
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:15,360
or it had no password, right?

1867
01:41:15,360 --> 01:41:16,840
The original Rygar on NES.

1868
01:41:16,840 --> 01:41:19,280
So it was one of those things where I had to leave it on overnight so I could come back

1869
01:41:19,280 --> 01:41:20,280
and play it later.

1870
01:41:20,280 --> 01:41:23,480
And I did, to be fair, I had a little help, I used, I don't know if it was Nintendo Power

1871
01:41:23,480 --> 01:41:24,480
or some other little guy.

1872
01:41:24,480 --> 01:41:25,480
Game Genie!

1873
01:41:25,480 --> 01:41:30,040
No, not that kind of cheating, like a guide, you know, this was obviously a day long before

1874
01:41:30,040 --> 01:41:34,320
Game Facts, but what we had back then, I think it was like a Nintendo Power or something

1875
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:36,860
that had tips for getting through different levels.

1876
01:41:36,860 --> 01:41:42,240
So yeah, I was able to beat Rygar and heaven forbid if I could play that game for anything

1877
01:41:42,240 --> 01:41:43,240
now.

1878
01:41:43,240 --> 01:41:49,320
So anyway, let's see, I'm trying to see if anybody was answering that question over in

1879
01:41:49,320 --> 01:41:53,240
our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

1880
01:41:53,240 --> 01:41:55,760
Let's see, darktedsuya says, I was waiting for the punchline.

1881
01:41:55,760 --> 01:41:59,400
That's in regards to the joke I made there a minute ago.

1882
01:41:59,400 --> 01:42:04,680
Dungeon Buster says, a speedrunner called Arcus87 on Twitch regularly runs Ninja Gaiden

1883
01:42:04,680 --> 01:42:06,240
around 12 minutes.

1884
01:42:06,240 --> 01:42:08,560
His world record is 1142, I think.

1885
01:42:08,560 --> 01:42:11,160
Wow, that's pretty, that's still pretty impressive.

1886
01:42:11,160 --> 01:42:16,120
Speaking of world records, we should give a shout out to regular guest and OLR superfan

1887
01:42:16,120 --> 01:42:22,040
Flaco Jones, who apparently has officially certified the fastest time in PT right now.

1888
01:42:22,040 --> 01:42:23,560
But I thought he didn't have it recorded.

1889
01:42:23,560 --> 01:42:28,400
No, he did, he got the Elgato thing, which I thought you gave it to him or Jamie gave

1890
01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:29,400
it to him.

1891
01:42:29,400 --> 01:42:33,400
Well, one way or another, probably passed through Shane or something, I don't know,

1892
01:42:33,400 --> 01:42:39,120
but he got the Elgato and he has, like, it's been certified on the speedrun archive site

1893
01:42:39,120 --> 01:42:40,120
or something like that.

1894
01:42:40,120 --> 01:42:41,120
That's cool.

1895
01:42:41,160 --> 01:42:45,920
And he keeps bidding to try to do one of the Game Stunt Quick marathons, so whenever they

1896
01:42:45,920 --> 01:42:48,320
let PT in, we'll hopefully see him there.

1897
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:49,320
That'll be fun.

1898
01:42:49,320 --> 01:42:50,320
Yeah.

1899
01:42:50,320 --> 01:42:51,320
Cheer him on.

1900
01:42:51,320 --> 01:42:52,320
Anyway.

1901
01:42:52,320 --> 01:42:53,320
All right.

1902
01:42:53,320 --> 01:42:58,920
Let's see, Rama says, Bart vs. Space Mutants could not beat it.

1903
01:42:58,920 --> 01:43:01,480
Well then, if you couldn't beat it, that's not an accomplishment, is it?

1904
01:43:01,480 --> 01:43:05,480
I remember a game, I'm just messing with you, I remember a game on Super Nintendo I played

1905
01:43:05,480 --> 01:43:06,960
a lot of that was also very hard.

1906
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:09,840
It was Bart's Nightmare?

1907
01:43:09,840 --> 01:43:11,680
Bart's Scary Nightmare or something about-

1908
01:43:11,680 --> 01:43:12,680
Bart's Nightmare, yeah.

1909
01:43:12,680 --> 01:43:13,680
Is that it?

1910
01:43:13,680 --> 01:43:16,560
And it was, like, you would jump into a page and it was some other, like, mini-game or

1911
01:43:16,560 --> 01:43:19,560
something, it was weird, weird-ass game.

1912
01:43:19,560 --> 01:43:23,120
It's weird to think the Simpsons have been around that long, where there were Simpsons

1913
01:43:23,120 --> 01:43:27,720
games on the Super Nintendo, yet the Simpsons is, like, still a thing that's on TV.

1914
01:43:27,720 --> 01:43:29,160
Have we had Simpsons games lately?

1915
01:43:29,160 --> 01:43:30,160
I guess it's on mobile.

1916
01:43:30,160 --> 01:43:33,920
Yeah, no, they had a console game, remember EA put out that was actually supposed to be

1917
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:34,920
pretty good.

1918
01:43:34,920 --> 01:43:38,000
I just remember that mobile game everybody's playing.

1919
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:39,000
Well there's that one too.

1920
01:43:39,480 --> 01:43:42,520
But, like, there was actually the console game, which was supposed to be pretty good,

1921
01:43:42,520 --> 01:43:47,760
and they did a Family Guy game, which was, I don't know, Activision did that one, I don't

1922
01:43:47,760 --> 01:43:48,760
know.

1923
01:43:48,760 --> 01:43:52,640
Alright, let's do some rapid-fire news, travel around the gaming world and check out some

1924
01:43:52,640 --> 01:43:54,320
news very quick.

1925
01:43:54,320 --> 01:43:57,920
Loki, we'll have you do yours and you can do Jamie's as well, if you don't mind.

1926
01:43:57,920 --> 01:44:02,240
But definitely nothing's gonna compete with the South Park game, which, I think the new

1927
01:44:02,240 --> 01:44:03,240
one's coming out pretty soon.

1928
01:44:03,240 --> 01:44:06,160
Yeah, I think it was supposed to be pretty soon, the Fractured But Whole.

1929
01:44:06,160 --> 01:44:08,400
The Fractured But Whole, yeah.

1930
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:10,960
That is something I'm looking forward to.

1931
01:44:10,960 --> 01:44:16,880
So Final Fantasy XV has been patched and now they've added some additional enhancements

1932
01:44:16,880 --> 01:44:18,520
to the photographing.

1933
01:44:18,520 --> 01:44:23,840
So now, not only will you get just the random photographs, but you can actually do your

1934
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:29,160
own photographs and set up, you know, custom pictures and stuff like that, so that's kind

1935
01:44:29,160 --> 01:44:30,160
of cool.

1936
01:44:30,160 --> 01:44:36,240
They also had some new packs, so they had a Holiday Pack Plus, which was the Moogle

1937
01:44:36,240 --> 01:44:43,040
Chocobo Carnival that opened the Festival Ensemble costume for Noctis, and the Holiday

1938
01:44:43,040 --> 01:44:49,760
Pack Plus exclusive photo frames, and then they had, you know, the free version as well,

1939
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:57,400
which just gave you the Moogle Chocobo Carnival and a Choco-Mog Tea for Noctis and a Holiday

1940
01:44:57,400 --> 01:44:58,540
Pack thing.

1941
01:44:58,540 --> 01:45:00,640
No word on the Gladio side story, though, huh?

1942
01:45:00,640 --> 01:45:01,840
No, not yet.

1943
01:45:01,840 --> 01:45:05,720
And then they also had a self-photographing feature that was something that was added

1944
01:45:05,720 --> 01:45:10,080
that was what I was just talking about, but that was also one of the things that was made

1945
01:45:10,080 --> 01:45:11,080
available there.

1946
01:45:11,080 --> 01:45:12,880
I still have yet to go back and play through this.

1947
01:45:12,880 --> 01:45:17,600
I am just not feeling compelled at all to play through Final Fantasy XV, which is really

1948
01:45:17,600 --> 01:45:18,600
sad.

1949
01:45:18,600 --> 01:45:19,600
It's worth it.

1950
01:45:19,600 --> 01:45:20,600
Even less so than Final Fantasy...

1951
01:45:20,600 --> 01:45:24,720
What if I had that last one that was Type Zero or whatever?

1952
01:45:24,720 --> 01:45:25,720
Type Zero.

1953
01:45:25,720 --> 01:45:28,880
I have no desire to play that.

1954
01:45:28,880 --> 01:45:34,000
I think XV is worth playing through and you can get through it faster than almost any

1955
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:35,520
other Final Fantasy game I can think of.

1956
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:39,560
I can't think of any Final Fantasy game that's probably shorter than XV, which I realize

1957
01:45:39,560 --> 01:45:42,840
is good news and bad news.

1958
01:45:42,840 --> 01:45:46,640
You can make XV a longer game with all the side quests and the other things there is

1959
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:48,820
to do and, of course, there's even more coming.

1960
01:45:48,820 --> 01:45:52,040
But to get through the base game as it is now would probably take you less time than

1961
01:45:52,040 --> 01:45:57,380
it would, oh God, like even Final Fantasy VI or V.

1962
01:45:57,380 --> 01:45:58,640
Maybe IV is just as long.

1963
01:45:58,640 --> 01:45:59,640
I can't remember.

1964
01:45:59,640 --> 01:46:02,520
But then again, IV is always shorter.

1965
01:46:02,520 --> 01:46:05,440
I think it's shorter than it really is because I always forget, like, oh yeah, you have the

1966
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:08,920
whole thing where you go underground and there's like half the game there.

1967
01:46:08,920 --> 01:46:11,640
So yeah, I don't know.

1968
01:46:11,640 --> 01:46:13,240
You should check it out at some point though, Loki.

1969
01:46:13,240 --> 01:46:14,240
I guess.

1970
01:46:14,240 --> 01:46:15,240
Anything else?

1971
01:46:15,240 --> 01:46:23,880
Yeah, and then, of course, let's see, we had some more backwards compatible games, which

1972
01:46:23,880 --> 01:46:24,880
is awesome.

1973
01:46:24,880 --> 01:46:36,000
So, for Xbox One, you're going to have now Tekken 6 and also, what else was there, Mutant

1974
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:42,200
Storm Empire and Midway Arcade Origins.

1975
01:46:42,200 --> 01:46:44,040
So those are three games that are available now.

1976
01:46:44,040 --> 01:46:49,820
Man, I have the Midway Treasures thing they released on original Xbox, but I don't have

1977
01:46:49,820 --> 01:46:51,520
the one they did on 360.

1978
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:52,520
Boo.

1979
01:46:52,520 --> 01:46:53,520
Yeah.

1980
01:46:53,560 --> 01:46:59,400
And then, of course, there was a brief cameo from Overwatch.

1981
01:46:59,400 --> 01:47:04,920
They had the bunny symbol from D.Va that showed up in one of the pictures from the Women's

1982
01:47:04,920 --> 01:47:07,760
March that happened yesterday.

1983
01:47:07,760 --> 01:47:12,000
And, you know, to be fair, there were a lot of, I don't know if you saw some of the clever

1984
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:15,620
signs that were out there, but there were a lot of very clever done signs that were

1985
01:47:15,620 --> 01:47:16,620
at the mark.

1986
01:47:16,620 --> 01:47:20,780
God, there was, what, two million people out there yesterday, just tons and tons of people,

1987
01:47:20,780 --> 01:47:22,980
and all with very, you know, sassy signs.

1988
01:47:22,980 --> 01:47:27,220
And there was a lot of pop culture references in the signs, like, just lots.

1989
01:47:27,220 --> 01:47:30,580
So it's pretty cool that, like, gaming is represented there as well, but, you know,

1990
01:47:30,580 --> 01:47:36,220
the fact that this was also the Korea Women's March, you know, I hear D.Va's a very, very,

1991
01:47:36,220 --> 01:47:40,980
very popular character over there, you know, because she is also the Korean representation

1992
01:47:40,980 --> 01:47:45,860
in the game, but, yeah, pretty cool.

1993
01:47:45,860 --> 01:47:46,860
Let's see.

1994
01:47:46,860 --> 01:47:51,140
Also, speaking of Overwatch, there are some new skins coming to the game.

1995
01:47:51,140 --> 01:47:54,720
The Year of the Rooster event is going to be coming to Overwatch.

1996
01:47:54,720 --> 01:48:01,700
It starts on January 24th and maybe runs through the 31st, and nothing official has been confirmed

1997
01:48:01,700 --> 01:48:06,020
as far as what the dates are that it will be running, but apparently some image leaked

1998
01:48:06,020 --> 01:48:08,220
out of China, and that's where people are getting it from.

1999
01:48:08,220 --> 01:48:13,660
Now, Blizzard teased some images of the Lunar New Year event, including some new skins for

2000
01:48:13,660 --> 01:48:17,220
Mei and D.Va, that actually look really, really cool, I gotta say.

2001
01:48:17,420 --> 01:48:22,580
Some of the images that leaked from this picture from China that was on Reddit, there's also

2002
01:48:22,580 --> 01:48:27,780
going to be skins for Zenyatta, Winston, Roadhog, and Reinhardt, and who knows, maybe even more

2003
01:48:27,780 --> 01:48:31,140
that aren't showing up on some of the publicity photos.

2004
01:48:31,140 --> 01:48:37,180
A week seems pretty short for an Overwatch event, so I imagine those loot boxes, you're

2005
01:48:37,180 --> 01:48:41,380
going to want to try to get those fast and furious, hopefully the Arcade mode will help

2006
01:48:41,380 --> 01:48:45,700
you earn a few more, but if not, I'm sure Blizzard will be more than happy to take your

2007
01:48:45,700 --> 01:48:51,620
money to open up more loot boxes where you might get one of these skins.

2008
01:48:51,620 --> 01:48:53,980
So there you go.

2009
01:48:53,980 --> 01:48:58,380
Check that out in Overwatch, starting in this next week.

2010
01:48:58,380 --> 01:49:03,340
Metroid, of course, always forever in our hearts, even though Nintendo doesn't seem

2011
01:49:03,340 --> 01:49:05,340
to do anything official for it.

2012
01:49:05,340 --> 01:49:09,380
Even though Nintendo won't do anything official, that does not stop the fan community.

2013
01:49:09,380 --> 01:49:13,400
That's right, there is yet another fan game that's been released.

2014
01:49:13,400 --> 01:49:17,300
It's a prequel fan game called Metroid Rogue Dawn.

2015
01:49:17,300 --> 01:49:22,040
It is set before Zero Mission, and it's a mission that is mentioned in the original

2016
01:49:22,040 --> 01:49:26,680
Metroid game manual, and that's really all it is.

2017
01:49:26,680 --> 01:49:29,040
So it's not a ROM hack or anything like that.

2018
01:49:29,040 --> 01:49:33,900
It does use the original engine though, but apparently the team that created this rebuilt

2019
01:49:33,900 --> 01:49:37,880
the assets and made original music for the game.

2020
01:49:37,880 --> 01:49:39,520
So anyhow, that is out there now.

2021
01:49:39,520 --> 01:49:45,000
You can check that out at ROMhacking.net, it's actually hosting the Metroid Rogue Dawn

2022
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:46,000
ROM.

2023
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:49,920
I'm sure it's just a matter of time until there is a cease and desist letter placed

2024
01:49:49,920 --> 01:49:50,920
on this game.

2025
01:49:50,920 --> 01:49:53,560
So is that actually like an NES ROM?

2026
01:49:53,560 --> 01:49:54,560
I believe so.

2027
01:49:54,560 --> 01:50:00,720
So that would be awesome to stick that kind of stuff onto the NES classic thing, those

2028
01:50:00,720 --> 01:50:01,920
nice ROM hacks.

2029
01:50:01,920 --> 01:50:06,440
Speaking of ROM hacks, one thing I forgot to mention is, this is kind of file this under

2030
01:50:06,440 --> 01:50:09,200
that, well, because I can type thing.

2031
01:50:09,200 --> 01:50:14,920
Somebody has made Bubsy a playable character in Streets of Rage 2.

2032
01:50:14,920 --> 01:50:15,920
Why?

2033
01:50:15,920 --> 01:50:17,920
Because they can.

2034
01:50:17,920 --> 01:50:18,920
Because it's silly.

2035
01:50:18,920 --> 01:50:23,520
Yes, that's right, so you can actually get that ROM as well.

2036
01:50:23,520 --> 01:50:30,080
They have that available via ROMhacking.net, so go check that out.

2037
01:50:30,080 --> 01:50:38,000
But yeah, he's got his own title animation and physics, and he's replacing Max Thunder.

2038
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:39,640
I think it looks silly.

2039
01:50:39,640 --> 01:50:40,640
Why not?

2040
01:50:40,640 --> 01:50:42,760
I need to see this in motion, it sounds hilarious.

2041
01:50:42,760 --> 01:50:43,760
It's pretty awesome.

2042
01:50:43,760 --> 01:50:46,240
They've got a little animation from it.

2043
01:50:46,240 --> 01:50:50,160
Alright, that's it for rapid fire news, so let's travel around the world and check out

2044
01:50:50,160 --> 01:50:54,040
what's coming out in stores this week, starting with the US, Loki.

2045
01:50:54,040 --> 01:50:57,720
Oh goodness, I'm totally unprepared.

2046
01:50:57,720 --> 01:51:03,600
Let's see, well, I believe, isn't this the week for Resident Evil?

2047
01:51:03,600 --> 01:51:04,960
I think you're right.

2048
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:10,480
Yeah, so Resident Evil 7 is going to be coming out on Xbox One and PlayStation 4.

2049
01:51:10,480 --> 01:51:14,800
That would also include PlayStation VR as well.

2050
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:17,920
I don't think there's much else coming out here.

2051
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:18,920
Let's see.

2052
01:51:18,920 --> 01:51:19,920
Open.

2053
01:51:19,920 --> 01:51:20,920
Dammit.

2054
01:51:20,920 --> 01:51:21,920
Okay.

2055
01:51:21,920 --> 01:51:27,600
And then, what else do we have here, so...

2056
01:51:27,600 --> 01:51:30,320
One second here.

2057
01:51:30,320 --> 01:51:32,120
Links we get are for 2016.

2058
01:51:32,120 --> 01:51:34,920
Uh oh, oh, we need to update that, sorry about that.

2059
01:51:34,920 --> 01:51:40,280
Yeah, it just keeps it for like September 2016 or something like that.

2060
01:51:40,280 --> 01:51:42,640
Okay, there we go.

2061
01:51:42,640 --> 01:51:46,960
Other things that are going to be coming out as well.

2062
01:51:46,960 --> 01:51:51,680
Let's see, we've got Tales of Berseria.

2063
01:51:51,680 --> 01:51:54,440
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, I forgot there was another Tales game.

2064
01:51:54,440 --> 01:52:01,600
That's going to be coming out on PC, PlayStation 4, Yakuza 0 on PlayStation 4, and then Memoranda

2065
01:52:01,600 --> 01:52:08,920
on PC, Mac, and Linux, The Wardrobe on PC, Mac, and Linux, TwinStar Exorcist on Vita,

2066
01:52:08,920 --> 01:52:16,720
Disgaea 2 is being ported to PC, and Double Dragon 4, that's coming out on PC and PlayStation

2067
01:52:16,720 --> 01:52:17,720
4.

2068
01:52:17,720 --> 01:52:18,720
Oh wow.

2069
01:52:18,720 --> 01:52:25,120
Yep, Digimon World Next Order on PlayStation 4, Divide on PlayStation 4, Dynasty Warriors

2070
01:52:25,120 --> 01:52:34,400
God Seekers on PlayStation 4 and Vita, and I believe that's it, let me just take a look

2071
01:52:34,400 --> 01:52:37,040
at my calendar here.

2072
01:52:37,040 --> 01:52:38,040
Just making sure.

2073
01:52:38,040 --> 01:52:40,000
Um, yeah, that's it.

2074
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:44,320
Alright, then let's travel over to Japan and check out some of the releases there.

2075
01:52:44,320 --> 01:52:50,460
Biohazard 7, Resident Evil also gets its release in Japan this week, so it's kind of a worldwide

2076
01:52:50,460 --> 01:52:53,260
release of sorts, that's out on the 26th of January.

2077
01:52:53,300 --> 01:52:57,100
There's also some more games on the PlayStation 4, New Game, the Challenge Stage in regular

2078
01:52:57,100 --> 01:53:03,660
and limited edition, Momotouji Taisen Oryoku 3 in regular and limited edition, and Oh no

2079
01:53:03,660 --> 01:53:08,740
Katana no 4-Rhythm HD Edition in regular and limited edition.

2080
01:53:08,740 --> 01:53:11,180
There's lots of limited editions in Japan.

2081
01:53:11,180 --> 01:53:16,440
Also on the Vita, the Momotouji Taisen Oryoku 3 is also released on the Vita, as well as

2082
01:53:16,440 --> 01:53:24,640
Shinsei Bateki Drive Girls, Black Wolves Saga Wiege und Schwarz is out there, throw a German

2083
01:53:24,640 --> 01:53:28,920
name in the Japanese releases, that is also out in Japan this week on the Vita, and the

2084
01:53:28,920 --> 01:53:32,040
New Game Challenge Stage there as well.

2085
01:53:32,040 --> 01:53:37,920
One other game too, Uta no Prince Sama Repeat Love, you can get that in a regular love box

2086
01:53:37,920 --> 01:53:42,120
or princess box, if you so desire.

2087
01:53:42,120 --> 01:53:46,280
Checking out quickly the 3DS, nothing this week on the 3DS, I think things are slowing

2088
01:53:46,280 --> 01:53:51,020
down on that system over there, so there's really not a lot else to mention in Japan.

2089
01:53:51,020 --> 01:53:58,960
We could talk about the UK though, the UK has some releases coming out there, which,

2090
01:53:58,960 --> 01:53:59,960
what do we have on the...

2091
01:53:59,960 --> 01:54:02,480
Resident Evil and Sniper Ghost Warrior it looks like.

2092
01:54:02,480 --> 01:54:03,480
Is that it?

2093
01:54:03,480 --> 01:54:04,640
Yeah, that looks like it.

2094
01:54:04,640 --> 01:54:10,840
Just Resident Evil and Sniper, Ghost Warrior, on the Vita this, or excuse me, in Europe

2095
01:54:10,840 --> 01:54:15,880
this week, not on the Vita, but on the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

2096
01:54:15,880 --> 01:54:20,320
It's about time to get to the mailbag, let's get to it.

2097
01:54:20,320 --> 01:54:26,360
Every week you guys email us, participate at orangeloungeradio.com, and we open up the

2098
01:54:26,360 --> 01:54:31,080
email bag, dive in, and pull out emails to read here on the show.

2099
01:54:31,080 --> 01:54:35,800
Usually Dark Sakura would do this, but since she's not here, I will fill in tonight.

2100
01:54:35,800 --> 01:54:40,280
So we're gonna start with this email from Asfer, who actually had sent this a couple

2101
01:54:40,280 --> 01:54:45,120
weeks ago, but I think we lost it in the mix up with the mailbag last week, so oops, sorry

2102
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:47,880
about that, but we're gonna read it now.

2103
01:54:47,880 --> 01:54:52,240
Who says, hello again, this email is in response to a question Rob asked me on the previous

2104
01:54:52,240 --> 01:54:53,240
episode.

2105
01:54:53,240 --> 01:54:57,360
He wanted to know which Final Fantasy came out when I was 12, as Bobby Blackwolf's statement

2106
01:54:57,360 --> 01:55:01,360
is that a game typically will be a person's favorite Final Fantasy.

2107
01:55:01,360 --> 01:55:06,080
To preface this, I mentioned that while I have fond feelings for 9, Final Fantasy X

2108
01:55:06,080 --> 01:55:09,880
is my favorite, and one of my all-time favorite video games in general.

2109
01:55:09,880 --> 01:55:15,080
So I'm 27 years old, my birthday is in October, so that means I would have been, well, shit.

2110
01:55:15,080 --> 01:55:21,520
I was 12 at the time Final Fantasy X released on December 17th, 2001, damn it Bobby!

2111
01:55:21,520 --> 01:55:24,020
Final Fantasy X was the first game I ever played in the series.

2112
01:55:24,020 --> 01:55:27,760
I was introduced to it at a friend's house, and I was instantly captivated by the story,

2113
01:55:27,760 --> 01:55:30,480
characters, and the conditional turn-based battle system.

2114
01:55:30,480 --> 01:55:33,920
I remember after watching him play, I asked him to bring it over to my house on his next

2115
01:55:33,920 --> 01:55:34,920
visit.

2116
01:55:34,920 --> 01:55:37,000
That night, I stayed up past 7am playing this game.

2117
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:40,360
I'd fallen in love with the world of Spira, and I couldn't wait to see what turns the

2118
01:55:40,360 --> 01:55:44,120
story would take next, and how our characters would deal with a force as unstoppable as

2119
01:55:44,160 --> 01:55:45,160
sin.

2120
01:55:45,160 --> 01:55:48,200
Damn, just thinking about it, I really wish Final Fantasy would return to a turn-based

2121
01:55:48,200 --> 01:55:49,200
battle system.

2122
01:55:49,200 --> 01:55:53,380
I like the conditional system that showed the order of attacks in X as opposed to the

2123
01:55:53,380 --> 01:55:57,920
active time battle system in 7, but even as that system was still very fun.

2124
01:55:57,920 --> 01:55:59,480
That brings up my question for you.

2125
01:55:59,480 --> 01:56:03,760
Do you like XV's approach on a more Kingdom Hearts-like battle system, or would you appreciate

2126
01:56:03,760 --> 01:56:06,400
the next Final Fantasy be more of a return to form and be turn-based?

2127
01:56:06,400 --> 01:56:11,260
Personally, while I enjoy XV, the battle system just doesn't feel like a Final Fantasy game

2128
01:56:11,260 --> 01:56:12,260
to me anymore.

2129
01:56:12,260 --> 01:56:13,480
Thanks for reading, Asfer.

2130
01:56:14,120 --> 01:56:20,040
Well, keep in mind, you can put Final Fantasy XV's battle system in what's called Wait

2131
01:56:20,040 --> 01:56:23,280
Mode, which does feel a little more traditional.

2132
01:56:23,280 --> 01:56:25,180
I actually don't prefer it.

2133
01:56:25,180 --> 01:56:29,960
I prefer the regular battle system that is not in Wait Mode.

2134
01:56:29,960 --> 01:56:32,540
I do think the game feels fine like that.

2135
01:56:32,540 --> 01:56:36,560
It is a little jarring, and I think when I first reviewed Final Fantasy XV on this show,

2136
01:56:36,560 --> 01:56:41,740
I kind of called it out as, this feels more like a spin-off game, which is what it started

2137
01:56:41,740 --> 01:56:44,560
out as, than it does a mainline Final Fantasy game.

2138
01:56:44,560 --> 01:56:45,560
That's not necessarily bad.

2139
01:56:45,560 --> 01:56:48,180
I mean, spin-off games can still be great games, right?

2140
01:56:48,180 --> 01:56:49,180
10-2, right?

2141
01:56:49,180 --> 01:56:51,180
It was pretty good, right?

2142
01:56:51,180 --> 01:56:56,500
But the interesting thing about your question is that I do feel like the turn-based Final

2143
01:56:56,500 --> 01:57:00,320
Fantasy thing is now relegated to the side games.

2144
01:57:00,320 --> 01:57:02,940
Like the mobile games have a lot of the turn-based stuff.

2145
01:57:02,940 --> 01:57:03,940
See, I like that.

2146
01:57:03,940 --> 01:57:06,820
I don't, I mean, I like the old battle systems.

2147
01:57:06,820 --> 01:57:07,820
I do too.

2148
01:57:07,820 --> 01:57:10,500
I didn't think there was really anything wrong with them.

2149
01:57:10,500 --> 01:57:14,660
Most people said that they got bored with them, and I mean, I don't know, it's just,

2150
01:57:14,660 --> 01:57:18,260
this battle system would be good for like another type of game.

2151
01:57:18,260 --> 01:57:19,260
Maybe not this.

2152
01:57:19,260 --> 01:57:21,260
I just don't, I don't know.

2153
01:57:21,260 --> 01:57:25,860
World of Final Fantasy, also a very recent side story game, also a turn-based battle

2154
01:57:25,860 --> 01:57:27,140
system in that game.

2155
01:57:27,140 --> 01:57:31,860
So I feel like if maybe that, and actually the whole like order of who goes when and

2156
01:57:31,860 --> 01:57:33,740
all that, actually it's different.

2157
01:57:33,740 --> 01:57:38,660
It uses a more like progressive time bar type thing, but I think you'd, as a 10 fan, you'd

2158
01:57:38,660 --> 01:57:39,740
find it acceptable.

2159
01:57:39,740 --> 01:57:41,620
That actually exists in World of Final Fantasy.

2160
01:57:41,620 --> 01:57:45,940
So I might actually encourage you, check out World of Final Fantasy because that might

2161
01:57:45,940 --> 01:57:47,300
be what you're looking for.

2162
01:57:47,300 --> 01:57:50,220
There are some other weird limitations in World of Final Fantasy, obviously the whole

2163
01:57:50,220 --> 01:57:54,480
like monster collecting and building the stacks, but you have to kind of build the right stacks

2164
01:57:54,480 --> 01:57:55,540
to get the most effective stuff.

2165
01:57:55,540 --> 01:57:57,180
I mean, there are some other complications of that.

2166
01:57:57,180 --> 01:58:01,740
It's not just like a quote unquote simple Final Fantasy game, like 10 was to kind of

2167
01:58:01,740 --> 01:58:02,740
just get into.

2168
01:58:02,740 --> 01:58:07,300
But I even think I said this as well when I first reviewed 15, I would really love it

2169
01:58:07,300 --> 01:58:14,500
if Final Fantasy 16 was a return to a 10 style game or a nine style game, something

2170
01:58:14,500 --> 01:58:17,540
that's the more traditional Final Fantasy.

2171
01:58:17,540 --> 01:58:22,740
It's almost like 15 they just tried too many different things and like...

2172
01:58:22,740 --> 01:58:26,500
But in 1500 was what I was going to say was about 16, what I'd like to see.

2173
01:58:26,500 --> 01:58:27,500
Yeah.

2174
01:58:27,500 --> 01:58:30,580
It's just like, I don't know, it just seems like, Oh, Hey, let's add these photo mode

2175
01:58:30,580 --> 01:58:31,580
in there and stuff.

2176
01:58:31,580 --> 01:58:34,380
It's like, okay, that's kind of unnecessary.

2177
01:58:34,380 --> 01:58:38,580
I mean, I know people like that kind of stuff, but it's kind of unnecessary.

2178
01:58:38,580 --> 01:58:40,940
But here's the weird thing about all that.

2179
01:58:40,940 --> 01:58:45,120
The newer Final Fantasy game in the retro setting with the pretty graphics and everything,

2180
01:58:45,120 --> 01:58:47,260
that's actually Final Fantasy 14.

2181
01:58:47,260 --> 01:58:52,380
And I think Final Fantasy 14 delivers on a lot of things that Final Fantasy fans will

2182
01:58:52,380 --> 01:58:53,380
be into.

2183
01:58:53,380 --> 01:58:56,540
But I completely understand a lot of people are turned off to it because it's MMO monthly

2184
01:58:56,540 --> 01:58:57,540
fee.

2185
01:58:57,540 --> 01:59:03,380
They're not interested, but I, you know, don't write off 14 because it's a fucking marvelous.

2186
01:59:03,380 --> 01:59:08,220
I mean, when I was playing Final Fantasy 14 this week, I finally wrapped up the story

2187
01:59:08,220 --> 01:59:14,700
for the last patch, the 3.4 patch, which was Soul Surrender, I think was the subtitle of

2188
01:59:14,700 --> 01:59:15,700
that.

2189
01:59:15,700 --> 01:59:16,700
Or is that the new patch?

2190
01:59:16,700 --> 01:59:19,900
I can't remember my patch names anymore, but I wrapped up the storyline in that patch and

2191
01:59:19,900 --> 01:59:22,100
it was so good.

2192
01:59:22,100 --> 01:59:25,860
Like Oh my God, at the end of it, I was just like, wow, that was like the twist they kind

2193
01:59:25,860 --> 01:59:29,000
of did with it was really good.

2194
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,620
So yeah, I was really jazzed about it.

2195
01:59:31,620 --> 01:59:35,780
And I kind of realized, you know, I've said this about Final Fantasy Heavensward, like

2196
01:59:35,780 --> 01:59:40,780
the Final Fantasy Heavensward story before, so just the 3.0 story without getting into

2197
01:59:40,780 --> 01:59:43,380
any of the patches or whatever.

2198
01:59:43,380 --> 01:59:50,260
It is the best Final Fantasy story for me since like six, like it's so fucking good.

2199
01:59:50,260 --> 01:59:54,620
And I know many Final Fantasy fans will never play it because again, it's an MMO.

2200
01:59:54,620 --> 02:00:00,180
So I wish there was a way Square Enix could figure out a way to make 14.

2201
02:00:00,180 --> 02:00:06,100
I mean, then I guess it wouldn't really be 14, like do a free version, do the base game

2202
02:00:06,100 --> 02:00:11,220
for free or something and have just like NPCs you can play with or something.

2203
02:00:11,220 --> 02:00:12,220
I don't know.

2204
02:00:12,220 --> 02:00:14,380
I just, I really wish they'd figure a way to do that out.

2205
02:00:14,380 --> 02:00:19,180
But yeah, I think 14 is really, really good if you're a Final Fantasy fan.

2206
02:00:19,180 --> 02:00:21,800
The other thing I want to say with 14, which I thought was interesting, they did talk about,

2207
02:00:21,800 --> 02:00:23,300
you know, they've got another expansion.

2208
02:00:23,300 --> 02:00:24,940
So this is, they're ramping down.

2209
02:00:24,940 --> 02:00:30,140
This is the last or the, they're doing a two-part patch to wrap up Heavensward, the last expansion,

2210
02:00:30,140 --> 02:00:31,140
right?

2211
02:00:31,140 --> 02:00:33,460
We got the first part and then the second part's coming, I think in March.

2212
02:00:33,460 --> 02:00:36,820
And then in June, Stormblood, the new expansion is coming.

2213
02:00:36,820 --> 02:00:41,660
But this is something interesting Final Fantasy is doing as opposed to World of Warcraft.

2214
02:00:41,660 --> 02:00:48,040
Instead of bundling in Heavensward, the previous expansion with the base game, they're still

2215
02:00:48,040 --> 02:00:52,100
going to continue to sell Realm Reborn, the base game, the way that it is, but they're

2216
02:00:52,100 --> 02:00:55,580
bundling in Heavensward with Stormblood.

2217
02:00:55,580 --> 02:00:59,820
So if you buy Stormblood, you're essentially, essentially buying all expansions to catch

2218
02:00:59,820 --> 02:01:01,540
you up, which I think is interesting.

2219
02:01:01,540 --> 02:01:03,220
So why would you just play the base game though?

2220
02:01:03,220 --> 02:01:06,620
Well, I think the base game is there for people to try it out and see if they like it.

2221
02:01:06,620 --> 02:01:10,460
I guess because it's so inexpensive, like on these sales, it's like down below 10 bucks.

2222
02:01:10,460 --> 02:01:11,460
Oh yeah.

2223
02:01:11,460 --> 02:01:12,460
I don't know.

2224
02:01:12,460 --> 02:01:13,460
For sure.

2225
02:01:13,460 --> 02:01:14,460
For sure.

2226
02:01:14,460 --> 02:01:18,180
Anyway, that's my thoughts on Final Fantasy and all that stuff.

2227
02:01:18,180 --> 02:01:23,500
I think, I think 15, it seems like it's done well enough where we will see a Final Fantasy

2228
02:01:23,500 --> 02:01:25,900
16, but God, who knows when?

2229
02:01:25,900 --> 02:01:29,020
I mean, we still got that seven remake to get through first, right?

2230
02:01:29,020 --> 02:01:32,420
Do you think Square would be bold enough to do a Final Fantasy 16 trailer at this year's

2231
02:01:32,420 --> 02:01:33,420
E3?

2232
02:01:33,420 --> 02:01:34,420
No.

2233
02:01:34,420 --> 02:01:35,420
I don't know.

2234
02:01:35,420 --> 02:01:40,620
Anyway, next email is from Red the Haze who emails us and says, hey y'all, long time listener

2235
02:01:40,620 --> 02:01:44,260
here for, oh my gosh, 10, maybe 11 years this year.

2236
02:01:44,260 --> 02:01:45,260
Wow.

2237
02:01:45,260 --> 02:01:46,260
That's some dedication.

2238
02:01:46,260 --> 02:01:47,260
Thank you so much.

2239
02:01:47,340 --> 02:01:48,340
I realized it now.

2240
02:01:48,340 --> 02:01:53,540
Well, I just wanted to send an email to congratulate Sky and Alan on their union and I wanted to

2241
02:01:53,540 --> 02:01:55,140
thank you very much for that.

2242
02:01:55,140 --> 02:01:59,380
And I wanted to thank Sky, Dark Sakura, Loki, and everyone involved, including guests and

2243
02:01:59,380 --> 02:02:04,900
the audience for the decade of great entertainment, more power to y'all and best wishes.

2244
02:02:04,900 --> 02:02:05,900
Thank you so much.

2245
02:02:05,900 --> 02:02:06,900
Red the Haze.

2246
02:02:06,900 --> 02:02:07,900
Well, thank you.

2247
02:02:07,900 --> 02:02:08,900
Thank you for that email.

2248
02:02:08,900 --> 02:02:09,900
Not even a question or anything.

2249
02:02:09,900 --> 02:02:11,540
Just a positive pat on the ass.

2250
02:02:11,540 --> 02:02:12,540
Thank you.

2251
02:02:12,540 --> 02:02:13,540
I appreciate that.

2252
02:02:13,540 --> 02:02:15,340
Thank you for the well wishes on the wedding.

2253
02:02:15,340 --> 02:02:17,020
I really, really appreciate that.

2254
02:02:17,780 --> 02:02:22,580
One more email tonight from, uh, our good old friend, Raginator.

2255
02:02:22,580 --> 02:02:27,260
Hi, Robin, Loki, who, who, who knew that Dark Sakura wasn't here tonight.

2256
02:02:27,260 --> 02:02:29,940
So he must've wrote this through the first part of the show.

2257
02:02:29,940 --> 02:02:33,780
Uh, anyway, I'd like to bring up a new question to your, to you folks.

2258
02:02:33,780 --> 02:02:37,260
I'm sure that the two of you, as well as most of the listeners know of at least one or two

2259
02:02:37,260 --> 02:02:40,820
people in their lives that is more or less anti video games.

2260
02:02:40,820 --> 02:02:44,140
They themselves refuse to play them and won't let their kids play them.

2261
02:02:44,140 --> 02:02:47,900
It may be part due to the stereotype that nerds play games and they immediately go to

2262
02:02:47,900 --> 02:02:52,420
the Revenge of the Nerds portrayal of nerds, or they possibly want to focus solely on psychic

2263
02:02:52,420 --> 02:02:55,300
activity or excuse me, physical activity.

2264
02:02:55,300 --> 02:02:59,540
Even if it only amounts to spinning in circles, literally all that being said, what would

2265
02:02:59,540 --> 02:03:01,740
you say to those notions?

2266
02:03:01,740 --> 02:03:04,060
And Raginator continues here and we'll answer the questions.

2267
02:03:04,060 --> 02:03:06,860
For me, I'll say this I'm all for physical activity.

2268
02:03:06,860 --> 02:03:09,740
God only knows I used to be on my high school's wrestling and football teams.

2269
02:03:09,740 --> 02:03:11,820
Granted, I sucked at sports, but I digress.

2270
02:03:11,820 --> 02:03:15,460
No one in their right mind will detract from physical exercise, but mental exercise is

2271
02:03:15,460 --> 02:03:18,020
equally important and video games provide that.

2272
02:03:18,020 --> 02:03:21,800
Perhaps this is an oversimplification, but video games help develop reasoning skills

2273
02:03:21,800 --> 02:03:23,300
amongst other things.

2274
02:03:23,300 --> 02:03:27,780
Essentially all games say to the player, this is the scenario, this is your goal, and this

2275
02:03:27,780 --> 02:03:30,700
is the tools or mechanics at your disposal, go.

2276
02:03:30,700 --> 02:03:35,420
It's been shown that keeping mentally active will help stave off dementia and other issues.

2277
02:03:35,420 --> 02:03:39,380
Also on a more personal note, I found that gaming helps dramatically with my PTSD and

2278
02:03:39,380 --> 02:03:43,660
major depressive disorder, keeping my symptoms 97% or so at bay.

2279
02:03:43,660 --> 02:03:47,620
In terms of the stereotype, I'm not exactly sure what to say about that though.

2280
02:03:47,620 --> 02:03:49,820
And that is from Raginator.

2281
02:03:49,820 --> 02:03:54,340
So what do you think of the notions that video games, just somebody in your life hates them?

2282
02:03:54,340 --> 02:03:55,340
Oh, that would be your wife.

2283
02:03:55,340 --> 02:03:59,420
That would be my wife, except that she likes certain video games.

2284
02:03:59,420 --> 02:04:02,420
So that's not totally true, not totally true.

2285
02:04:02,420 --> 02:04:07,240
But yeah, I mean, she didn't want our kids playing video games a lot and then the kids

2286
02:04:07,240 --> 02:04:11,040
started annoying the shit out of her and now she's just like, just go do something

2287
02:04:11,040 --> 02:04:12,040
else.

2288
02:04:12,040 --> 02:04:13,640
I don't care what you're doing, which includes video games.

2289
02:04:13,640 --> 02:04:17,400
Well, here's the thing, Raginator, if I'm not mistaken, based on your calls to the show

2290
02:04:17,400 --> 02:04:20,720
previously, I believe you're in your thirties and you're kind of close to our age.

2291
02:04:20,720 --> 02:04:23,880
And I think the answer to this question has shifted a lot.

2292
02:04:23,880 --> 02:04:27,540
I think when we were growing up, you know, when we were around the Nintendo and the Super

2293
02:04:27,540 --> 02:04:32,760
Nintendo and all that stuff, I think our parents didn't have that growing up.

2294
02:04:32,760 --> 02:04:39,680
So it was something weird and unknown and they only knew what they saw about it on TV

2295
02:04:39,680 --> 02:04:41,680
or whatever.

2296
02:04:41,680 --> 02:04:46,040
Especially in the nineties when Mortal Kombat happened and the whole violent video games

2297
02:04:46,040 --> 02:04:51,380
that even went before Congress at one point and that ultimately developed in the rating

2298
02:04:51,380 --> 02:04:55,420
system that we have for video games today because the video game industry had the police

2299
02:04:55,420 --> 02:04:58,320
itself before the government did it for them, right?

2300
02:04:58,320 --> 02:05:00,560
So all that stuff was crazy in the media.

2301
02:05:00,560 --> 02:05:05,120
And so I think for that reason, video games got a certain like stereotype or stigma.

2302
02:05:05,120 --> 02:05:09,280
But Raginator, I really think things are kind of different now because a lot of the people

2303
02:05:09,280 --> 02:05:15,340
that have kids that are, you know, nine years old, 12 years old, whatever, they grew up

2304
02:05:15,340 --> 02:05:16,640
with video games.

2305
02:05:16,640 --> 02:05:18,140
So I mean, like, look at Loki.

2306
02:05:18,140 --> 02:05:19,560
He's a parent.

2307
02:05:19,560 --> 02:05:24,560
Loki grew up with video games and you have, I can never remember Josh's age, five, six,

2308
02:05:24,560 --> 02:05:26,240
five, six years old.

2309
02:05:26,240 --> 02:05:29,040
But Josh is able to play a healthy amount of Minecraft, right?

2310
02:05:29,720 --> 02:05:31,440
He plays an unhealthy amount of Minecraft.

2311
02:05:31,440 --> 02:05:32,440
It's more like watches.

2312
02:05:32,440 --> 02:05:38,200
He will watch videos as long as we'll let him watch videos and like anytime that there's

2313
02:05:38,200 --> 02:05:43,160
screens on, he'll just like kind of gravitate towards them like anything.

2314
02:05:43,160 --> 02:05:44,640
But you and, that sounds like me as a kid.

2315
02:05:44,640 --> 02:05:47,920
And he won't shut up about Minecraft like all the time.

2316
02:05:47,920 --> 02:05:52,520
You and Nelly, that's as parents, you guys police that what games he should play and

2317
02:05:52,520 --> 02:05:54,600
how long he gets to play them and all that stuff.

2318
02:05:54,600 --> 02:05:59,480
But you have the benefit of knowing basic stuff about video games that you kind of know

2319
02:05:59,480 --> 02:06:00,820
like the ins and outs, right?

2320
02:06:00,820 --> 02:06:01,820
You know that it's not going to...

2321
02:06:01,820 --> 02:06:06,280
He still watches YouTubers and YouTubers tend to swear and then they play like violent video

2322
02:06:06,280 --> 02:06:07,280
games on there and stuff.

2323
02:06:07,280 --> 02:06:09,840
I was gonna say, do you let your kid play violent games?

2324
02:06:09,840 --> 02:06:12,840
Uh, you know, he doesn't only, he only plays Minecraft.

2325
02:06:12,840 --> 02:06:15,160
He only has the Wii U that he plays on.

2326
02:06:15,160 --> 02:06:18,000
So it's basically Minecraft.

2327
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,360
That's really all he plays on is just Minecraft.

2328
02:06:20,360 --> 02:06:23,720
And then, he had Mario Kart 8 on there.

2329
02:06:23,720 --> 02:06:25,520
He will play Mario Kart 8 sometimes.

2330
02:06:25,520 --> 02:06:27,160
He hasn't really played it in a while.

2331
02:06:27,160 --> 02:06:28,700
And Smash is on there.

2332
02:06:28,700 --> 02:06:31,700
So he'll play Smash.

2333
02:06:31,700 --> 02:06:33,240
But he's not really interested in that.

2334
02:06:33,240 --> 02:06:34,240
It's mostly Minecraft.

2335
02:06:34,240 --> 02:06:40,240
And then he watches Minecraft mod videos from either PopularMMOs or DanTDM.

2336
02:06:40,240 --> 02:06:41,680
That's his favorite YouTubers.

2337
02:06:41,680 --> 02:06:44,960
But anyway, it's one of those things where it's like, again, I think the public perception

2338
02:06:44,960 --> 02:06:45,960
has shifted a lot.

2339
02:06:45,960 --> 02:06:49,680
And the people that are still anti-video games are the people that are our parents' age.

2340
02:06:49,680 --> 02:06:50,680
You know, boomers.

2341
02:06:50,680 --> 02:06:52,520
You know, people in their, you know, depending on-

2342
02:06:52,520 --> 02:06:53,520
Which is weird.

2343
02:06:53,520 --> 02:06:55,600
Like, my dad's like so anti-video games.

2344
02:06:55,600 --> 02:06:59,920
Yeah, he had like a fucking collection of ColecoVision games, like 47 games.

2345
02:06:59,920 --> 02:07:02,120
But like, he bought me like a Nintendo.

2346
02:07:02,120 --> 02:07:03,760
He bought me a Texas Ocean's Things.

2347
02:07:03,760 --> 02:07:06,200
I'm like, you are a fucking gamer.

2348
02:07:06,200 --> 02:07:08,200
You have 47 fucking games.

2349
02:07:08,200 --> 02:07:10,500
That is, that's more than just a few.

2350
02:07:10,500 --> 02:07:13,120
There's just generational differences.

2351
02:07:13,120 --> 02:07:17,760
And that's why we have these silly labels like boomers, like Gen X, like millennials

2352
02:07:17,760 --> 02:07:18,760
and all this stuff.

2353
02:07:18,760 --> 02:07:21,920
Because there are just things in society that change generation to generation.

2354
02:07:21,920 --> 02:07:27,560
I mean, look back at some of the stuff that was cool when your parents were younger.

2355
02:07:27,560 --> 02:07:32,880
Like they used to think sitting on flag poles was cool and swallowing goldfish whole, right?

2356
02:07:32,880 --> 02:07:33,960
Pet rocks.

2357
02:07:33,960 --> 02:07:36,520
Can anyone ever explain the pet rock thing to me?

2358
02:07:36,520 --> 02:07:39,800
That's just, you know, but then at the same time, you look at what some of the kids today

2359
02:07:39,800 --> 02:07:42,960
are doing and it's like, you know, now I'm starting to feel like that old man, like,

2360
02:07:42,960 --> 02:07:45,960
you know, like, who thinks planking is funny?

2361
02:07:45,960 --> 02:07:46,960
It's just-

2362
02:07:46,960 --> 02:07:47,960
It's not funny anymore.

2363
02:07:47,960 --> 02:07:48,960
Exactly.

2364
02:07:48,960 --> 02:07:49,960
It's a fad.

2365
02:07:49,960 --> 02:07:50,960
There's just, yeah, exactly.

2366
02:07:50,960 --> 02:07:51,960
There's certain trends or whatever.

2367
02:07:51,960 --> 02:07:55,440
But the one other thing I want to point to is look at the sales of the classic NES and

2368
02:07:55,440 --> 02:07:59,360
how Nintendo like grossly underestimated how many that was going to sell.

2369
02:07:59,360 --> 02:08:03,360
If you want to believe that line, I'll leave that to you.

2370
02:08:03,360 --> 02:08:08,920
They really underestimated how many moms and dads wanted these, not just for themselves,

2371
02:08:08,920 --> 02:08:12,760
but to play with their kids, to introduce their kids to the same games that they were

2372
02:08:12,760 --> 02:08:13,760
playing.

2373
02:08:13,760 --> 02:08:17,760
A lot of kids, even though the technology's dated or whatever, a lot of kids are really

2374
02:08:17,760 --> 02:08:18,760
eating this classic stuff up.

2375
02:08:18,760 --> 02:08:22,440
Yeah, my kids always call anything that they see that's 8-bit Minecraft.

2376
02:08:22,440 --> 02:08:24,360
They're all, that game looks like Minecraft.

2377
02:08:24,360 --> 02:08:29,200
I'm like, no, that's just how games used to look.

2378
02:08:29,200 --> 02:08:32,520
And Rage Leader says in our chat room, he's there in the chat room clarifying, the thing

2379
02:08:32,520 --> 02:08:36,040
is, I know people within our own age group that are anti-video games, not just the baby

2380
02:08:36,040 --> 02:08:37,160
boomer generation.

2381
02:08:37,160 --> 02:08:38,160
And that's fair.

2382
02:08:38,160 --> 02:08:43,280
You know, people are just going to- people are going to be raised the way they were raised

2383
02:08:43,280 --> 02:08:44,280
sometimes.

2384
02:08:44,280 --> 02:08:46,960
So there's probably going to be people that still carry that.

2385
02:08:46,960 --> 02:08:50,800
Sorry, my wife thinks I look weird with a VR headset on, and eventually that's going

2386
02:08:50,800 --> 02:08:52,000
to be a norm.

2387
02:08:52,000 --> 02:09:00,220
In my opinion, though, if you watch movies, if you play Dungeons and Dragons, although

2388
02:09:00,220 --> 02:09:04,600
I suppose that gets a lot of negative stigma sometimes as well, but if you do all that,

2389
02:09:04,600 --> 02:09:06,360
why can't you play video games?

2390
02:09:06,360 --> 02:09:09,720
Video games are not that different from movies to me.

2391
02:09:09,720 --> 02:09:10,720
So anyway.

2392
02:09:10,720 --> 02:09:11,720
All right.

2393
02:09:11,720 --> 02:09:12,720
Let's see.

2394
02:09:12,720 --> 02:09:19,880
I'm going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com and let's see.

2395
02:09:19,880 --> 02:09:20,880
Where is it?

2396
02:09:20,880 --> 02:09:23,720
Kaijuta says new pet rock is that hatchling thing.

2397
02:09:23,720 --> 02:09:24,720
I don't even know.

2398
02:09:24,720 --> 02:09:25,720
What's a hatchling thing?

2399
02:09:25,720 --> 02:09:28,800
Isn't that that popular present or whatever it is?

2400
02:09:28,800 --> 02:09:29,800
I don't know.

2401
02:09:29,800 --> 02:09:30,800
It sounds stupid.

2402
02:09:30,800 --> 02:09:31,800
It sounds like a new pet.

2403
02:09:31,800 --> 02:09:35,800
It was a Christmas present or something, right?

2404
02:09:35,800 --> 02:09:36,800
Yeah.

2405
02:09:36,800 --> 02:09:40,520
It was a must have thing that other than the classic NES was the hatchling or whatever.

2406
02:09:40,520 --> 02:09:43,520
Isn't that just like that candy that's banned here in America?

2407
02:09:43,520 --> 02:09:44,520
That's in other countries.

2408
02:09:44,520 --> 02:09:45,520
Poor Loco.

2409
02:09:45,520 --> 02:09:46,520
No, no, no, no.

2410
02:09:46,520 --> 02:09:47,520
Come on.

2411
02:09:47,520 --> 02:09:48,520
I'm talking about...

2412
02:09:48,520 --> 02:09:49,520
Kinder eggs.

2413
02:09:49,520 --> 02:09:50,520
What's the name of that Alan?

2414
02:09:50,520 --> 02:09:51,520
Kinder eggs.

2415
02:09:51,520 --> 02:09:52,520
Thank you, Alan.

2416
02:09:52,520 --> 02:09:53,520
Alan knew the name of it.

2417
02:09:53,520 --> 02:09:54,520
Kinder egg.

2418
02:09:54,520 --> 02:09:55,520
You could like, it was like a chocolate or something.

2419
02:09:55,520 --> 02:09:57,720
There's like a prize in the middle and they were afraid that kids here would choke on

2420
02:09:57,720 --> 02:09:58,720
it.

2421
02:09:58,720 --> 02:10:00,920
Well, these are, yeah.

2422
02:10:00,920 --> 02:10:01,920
All right.

2423
02:10:01,920 --> 02:10:02,920
Thank you.

2424
02:10:02,920 --> 02:10:03,920
Wow.

2425
02:10:03,920 --> 02:10:04,920
Chat room knows their shit.

2426
02:10:04,920 --> 02:10:05,920
Kinder eggs.

2427
02:10:06,040 --> 02:10:08,040
And that's it for emails.

2428
02:10:08,040 --> 02:10:14,920
If you guys want to send us an email for a future week, participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

2429
02:10:14,920 --> 02:10:19,480
But meanwhile, we have some more news to get into, starting with Loki.

2430
02:10:19,480 --> 02:10:24,200
So Super Mario Brothers Run, I know it's coming to Android soon because they have that stupid

2431
02:10:24,200 --> 02:10:29,640
pre-order thing or pre-register, pre-notifier, whatever the fuck it is.

2432
02:10:29,640 --> 02:10:34,280
Some stupid equivalent of pre-ordering for a mobile device, which doesn't make any goddamn

2433
02:10:34,280 --> 02:10:35,280
sense.

2434
02:10:35,640 --> 02:10:42,360
Nintendo announced that Super Mario Run will be coming out in March on Android and you

2435
02:10:42,360 --> 02:10:46,720
can, like I said, you can register for updates regarding that on Google Play Store.

2436
02:10:46,720 --> 02:10:49,360
I will never do that because I don't fucking care.

2437
02:10:49,360 --> 02:10:50,800
Like, it's not going to do it.

2438
02:10:50,800 --> 02:10:53,080
If you have a Twitter account, you'll know when the game's out.

2439
02:10:53,080 --> 02:10:54,080
Exactly.

2440
02:10:54,080 --> 02:10:55,080
Who cares?

2441
02:10:55,080 --> 02:11:00,440
Just, you'll know when it's supposed to come out and you'll check it out if you want to.

2442
02:11:00,440 --> 02:11:03,240
I may check out the free version of the game or not.

2443
02:11:03,240 --> 02:11:04,240
I really don't.

2444
02:11:05,200 --> 02:11:07,200
It's not something that looks interesting to me.

2445
02:11:07,200 --> 02:11:11,840
I, you know, again, the $10 I spent on Super Mario Run, I kind of regret.

2446
02:11:11,840 --> 02:11:12,840
I'm just saying.

2447
02:11:12,840 --> 02:11:16,360
So, you know, and I, there's some people out there that strongly disagree with me and that's

2448
02:11:16,360 --> 02:11:18,040
fine.

2449
02:11:18,040 --> 02:11:19,440
That's just my personal opinion.

2450
02:11:19,440 --> 02:11:21,040
All right.

2451
02:11:21,040 --> 02:11:27,040
Well, let's talk about Pokemon Go and then maybe, Loki, you want to pick up our story.

2452
02:11:27,040 --> 02:11:29,960
So Pokemon Go, still going strong.

2453
02:11:29,960 --> 02:11:32,160
I just hit level 26 of Pokemon Go not that long ago.

2454
02:11:32,160 --> 02:11:33,960
I haven't really been playing it that much.

2455
02:11:34,680 --> 02:11:35,680
Very little.

2456
02:11:35,680 --> 02:11:39,560
I've been trying to do more walking, especially on, like, my lunch breaks and I love that

2457
02:11:39,560 --> 02:11:41,640
little Pokemon Go Plus.

2458
02:11:41,640 --> 02:11:43,880
It really is incentive because I try to hatch eggs.

2459
02:11:43,880 --> 02:11:47,800
Are those easier to find nowadays or are they still, like, super hard to find?

2460
02:11:47,800 --> 02:11:50,840
I don't think they are easy to find still.

2461
02:11:50,840 --> 02:11:52,320
Because that's a Nintendo product.

2462
02:11:52,320 --> 02:11:53,960
Go fig that it's hard to find.

2463
02:11:53,960 --> 02:11:58,960
Yeah, because they can never estimate, you know, possible consumer wants.

2464
02:11:58,960 --> 02:12:03,280
Well, Pokemon Go, you know, despite all the stories that say it's dead or whatever, it

2465
02:12:03,280 --> 02:12:04,600
made a shit ton of money.

2466
02:12:04,600 --> 02:12:11,560
I mean, the research firm App Annie has estimated that for 2006, Pokemon Go made a shit ton

2467
02:12:11,560 --> 02:12:12,560
of money.

2468
02:12:12,560 --> 02:12:13,800
That's actually published on the site.

2469
02:12:13,800 --> 02:12:14,800
Shit ton.

2470
02:12:14,800 --> 02:12:15,800
No, it isn't.

2471
02:12:15,800 --> 02:12:16,800
It says 950 million.

2472
02:12:16,800 --> 02:12:17,800
But that is a shit ton of money.

2473
02:12:17,800 --> 02:12:19,280
That's almost a billion dollars.

2474
02:12:19,280 --> 02:12:24,780
So, and that's, see, that's the one downside to the fact that I do walk is that I always

2475
02:12:24,780 --> 02:12:30,440
need those fucking incubators and so I keep spending money on incubators and I have had

2476
02:12:30,440 --> 02:12:31,920
to, like, tell myself to stop.

2477
02:12:31,920 --> 02:12:34,560
And, like, I finally got smart.

2478
02:12:34,560 --> 02:12:40,460
I use my infinite incubator for all my 2K eggs because you can hatch more that way.

2479
02:12:40,460 --> 02:12:45,840
And I will only use the pay ones for the 10K and sometimes the 5K just depending on what's

2480
02:12:45,840 --> 02:12:46,840
in my inventory.

2481
02:12:46,840 --> 02:12:47,900
So I have to buy less of them.

2482
02:12:47,900 --> 02:12:52,520
But I never use a pay incubator anymore for 2K because I just, I walk too much for it.

2483
02:12:52,520 --> 02:13:00,540
So anyway, so yeah, that is only behind Monster Strike and Clash Royale for how much money

2484
02:13:00,540 --> 02:13:01,540
it made.

2485
02:13:01,580 --> 02:13:03,500
It launched in July.

2486
02:13:03,500 --> 02:13:10,380
So there is a Pokemon Go update that came out recently that also fixes GPS drift apparently.

2487
02:13:10,380 --> 02:13:14,140
I haven't really noticed the change that much but I didn't really have a horrible problem

2488
02:13:14,140 --> 02:13:15,900
with this to begin with.

2489
02:13:15,900 --> 02:13:19,220
So yeah, the GPS drift apparently was fixed in this most recent patch.

2490
02:13:19,220 --> 02:13:22,020
Don't be nice if they fix that shit in Ingress.

2491
02:13:22,020 --> 02:13:25,940
You can also, apparently it will show eggs that have been collected from PokeStops on

2492
02:13:25,940 --> 02:13:28,900
the Apple Watch and some minor text fixes.

2493
02:13:28,940 --> 02:13:32,020
But no word yet on Gen 2 unfortunately.

2494
02:13:32,020 --> 02:13:33,980
We still don't have anything outside the eggs hatching.

2495
02:13:33,980 --> 02:13:40,860
But I finally got my last Pokemon from Gen 2, Magmar was the last one I needed.

2496
02:13:40,860 --> 02:13:43,280
And I got it this week, yay!

2497
02:13:43,280 --> 02:13:49,100
So now I have all the Gen, I even evolved all the, I got like 3 Togepies out of eggs

2498
02:13:49,100 --> 02:13:52,500
and I evolved it into a Togek or whatever it's called.

2499
02:13:52,500 --> 02:13:55,740
So I have like all the Gen 2 you can get in the game right now.

2500
02:13:55,740 --> 02:13:57,220
I still don't even have all the Gen 1.

2501
02:13:57,660 --> 02:13:59,020
Need to find some more farms.

2502
02:14:00,020 --> 02:14:02,460
Anyhow, what else Loki?

2503
02:14:02,460 --> 02:14:08,540
So Capcom is planning on more Street Fighter.

2504
02:14:08,540 --> 02:14:09,700
So they're going to have some more announcements.

2505
02:14:09,700 --> 02:14:15,200
They're going to be coming out around E3 and San Diego Comic Con.

2506
02:14:15,200 --> 02:14:18,220
No words exactly on what it's going to be.

2507
02:14:18,220 --> 02:14:21,820
But more updates for Street Fighter 5 or something.

2508
02:14:21,820 --> 02:14:26,940
One thing that he said though, unfortunately Rival Schools, there's no plans for anything

2509
02:14:26,940 --> 02:14:27,940
regarding that.

2510
02:14:27,940 --> 02:14:32,100
I guess they said despite some Easter eggs that were in Dead Rising 4, there's a game

2511
02:14:32,100 --> 02:14:36,420
I haven't played in a while, Dead Rising.

2512
02:14:36,420 --> 02:14:38,020
So I guess we'll have to wait and see.

2513
02:14:38,020 --> 02:14:43,100
I know that they have the Street Fighter 2 game, Ultra Street Fighter 2, the final challengers

2514
02:14:43,100 --> 02:14:44,220
that's supposed to be coming out.

2515
02:14:44,220 --> 02:14:48,580
Maybe part of that, maybe they're going to put in, because I know Evil Ryu I think is

2516
02:14:48,580 --> 02:14:54,020
probably in Street Fighter 5 already, but maybe like Violent Ken.

2517
02:14:54,820 --> 02:14:58,980
I wish there was a little something else, like maybe one more character in Ultra Street

2518
02:14:58,980 --> 02:15:03,700
Fighter 2 that wasn't just a reskin, but I also maybe understand the fact that Street

2519
02:15:03,700 --> 02:15:09,300
Fighter 2 was kind of done a long time ago, so maybe they don't want to throw off that

2520
02:15:09,300 --> 02:15:16,740
whole balance by introducing another new character into a game that's literally 20 years old

2521
02:15:16,740 --> 02:15:17,740
at this point.

2522
02:15:17,740 --> 02:15:18,740
I guess.

2523
02:15:18,740 --> 02:15:19,740
I don't know.

2524
02:15:19,740 --> 02:15:20,740
Whatever.

2525
02:15:20,740 --> 02:15:21,740
Stop remaking it then.

2526
02:15:21,740 --> 02:15:24,500
If you want to do that, then make a new game.

2527
02:15:24,500 --> 02:15:27,220
I just, I don't know.

2528
02:15:27,220 --> 02:15:28,220
Lame.

2529
02:15:28,220 --> 02:15:34,540
Alright, so apparently the next Game Developers Conference, we know that Tim Sweeney is going

2530
02:15:34,540 --> 02:15:38,380
to receive a lifetime achievement award, which is pretty awesome.

2531
02:15:38,380 --> 02:15:43,460
Tim Sweeney of course, founder of Epic Games, created ZZT.

2532
02:15:43,460 --> 02:15:44,460
Yeah?

2533
02:15:44,460 --> 02:15:45,460
Yes!

2534
02:15:45,460 --> 02:15:46,460
ZZT?

2535
02:15:46,460 --> 02:15:49,060
There's a game that I'd love to see it come back.

2536
02:15:49,060 --> 02:15:52,660
Some new ZZT.

2537
02:15:52,660 --> 02:15:53,660
And no other games.

2538
02:15:53,660 --> 02:16:01,380
Of course he helped develop Unreal, Gears of War, Unreal Engine, and I guess the Game

2539
02:16:01,380 --> 02:16:07,580
Developers Choice Awards will be on Wednesday, March 1st from 6.30 to 8.30 Pacific Standard

2540
02:16:07,580 --> 02:16:08,900
Time.

2541
02:16:08,900 --> 02:16:12,100
So that's pretty awesome.

2542
02:16:12,100 --> 02:16:13,100
He deserves it.

2543
02:16:13,100 --> 02:16:14,100
ZZT is awesome.

2544
02:16:14,100 --> 02:16:16,140
Will you be able to watch that online?

2545
02:16:16,140 --> 02:16:17,140
You said?

2546
02:16:17,140 --> 02:16:18,140
I think you should be able to, yeah.

2547
02:16:19,140 --> 02:16:25,100
I, you know, I sometimes forget to make that connection that it's the same guy who made

2548
02:16:25,100 --> 02:16:30,500
ZZT who also has a hand in all these newer games, so definitely a lifetime of accomplishments

2549
02:16:30,500 --> 02:16:35,140
in the game industry, so a well-deserved award, in my opinion.

2550
02:16:35,140 --> 02:16:37,420
And again, I can't say enough good things about ZZT.

2551
02:16:37,420 --> 02:16:40,940
I wish it would make a comeback as well, but I guess it would be hard in this day and age.

2552
02:16:40,940 --> 02:16:42,660
That'd be a great game on the Switch.

2553
02:16:42,660 --> 02:16:43,660
Ha ha ha ha.

2554
02:16:43,660 --> 02:16:45,540
Yeah, I think it would be.

2555
02:16:45,940 --> 02:16:50,540
All right, well, lastly tonight, before we get to the Skype line and your calls at Orange.

2556
02:16:50,540 --> 02:16:53,380
It'd be awesome, actually, to totally interrupt you here.

2557
02:16:53,380 --> 02:16:54,380
Sure.

2558
02:16:54,380 --> 02:16:59,140
ZZT on Steam with Steam Workshop support for levels.

2559
02:16:59,140 --> 02:17:00,140
I like that.

2560
02:17:00,140 --> 02:17:04,020
That would be fucking awesome.

2561
02:17:04,020 --> 02:17:06,740
But in the meantime, we have Frog Fractions 2.

2562
02:17:06,740 --> 02:17:13,060
Anyhow, lastly tonight, before we get to the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio, a brand

2563
02:17:13,060 --> 02:17:18,380
new cooking show that appeals to gamers made its debut in South Korea.

2564
02:17:18,380 --> 02:17:19,380
That's right.

2565
02:17:19,380 --> 02:17:24,020
It's a South Korean World of Warcraft cooking show aired on TV this week.

2566
02:17:24,020 --> 02:17:25,380
Yeah, no, really.

2567
02:17:25,380 --> 02:17:26,380
This really happened.

2568
02:17:26,380 --> 02:17:30,020
It aired, I think, just yesterday, and it's called Wow!

2569
02:17:30,020 --> 02:17:31,020
Recipe?

2570
02:17:31,020 --> 02:17:32,020
The Meal is Ready.

2571
02:17:32,020 --> 02:17:34,820
At least that's what the title translates to.

2572
02:17:34,820 --> 02:17:41,500
And it stars Choi Hun Suk, hopefully I pronounced that right, sorry, a famous chef who appears

2573
02:17:41,500 --> 02:17:43,100
on South Korean television.

2574
02:17:43,100 --> 02:17:47,540
But in this particular show, this guy happens to be a WoW player.

2575
02:17:47,540 --> 02:17:54,180
So he cooks dishes called murloc soup and hellhound sweet and sour fish while the guests

2576
02:17:54,180 --> 02:17:57,220
in the studio share stories from and about the game.

2577
02:17:57,220 --> 02:17:58,700
I actually think that's kind of awesome.

2578
02:17:58,700 --> 02:18:03,420
Like as much as we can sit here and kind of joke like LOL WoW cooking show, I mean, we

2579
02:18:03,420 --> 02:18:06,740
sit here and talk about video games as we're talking about food.

2580
02:18:06,740 --> 02:18:08,220
Well, yeah, there's one I watched.

2581
02:18:08,220 --> 02:18:10,060
This is kind of the perfect TV show.

2582
02:18:10,060 --> 02:18:15,500
Thanks to Reddit, there was a, and I now of course, I don't remember what the series

2583
02:18:15,500 --> 02:18:16,500
of that.

2584
02:18:16,500 --> 02:18:17,500
Look at my phone here real quick.

2585
02:18:17,500 --> 02:18:25,860
But there was a cooking show for like based off TV and movies, like different recipes

2586
02:18:25,860 --> 02:18:27,500
or like dishes that are in there.

2587
02:18:27,500 --> 02:18:29,900
They're like, well, how would they make it like one of the ones that they did was the

2588
02:18:29,900 --> 02:18:35,480
turkey burger from Parks and Rec where they have the burger cook off thing.

2589
02:18:35,480 --> 02:18:39,120
So they made the Ron Swanson burger, which is just meat and bun.

2590
02:18:39,120 --> 02:18:43,440
And then they made the other turkey burger thing with like all the fancy stuff on it.

2591
02:18:43,440 --> 02:18:46,200
And the guy's like, actually, it's pretty good.

2592
02:18:46,200 --> 02:18:48,880
There's a cooking channel on Twitch now, so why not?

2593
02:18:48,880 --> 02:18:50,880
And an eating channel.

2594
02:18:50,880 --> 02:18:56,000
Wait, is there a cooking channel on Twitch or am I mixing it up with the eating channel?

2595
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,540
I think I'm mixing it up with the eating channel.

2596
02:18:58,540 --> 02:19:02,280
But I'm sure now that they have what the whole IRL thing, I'm sure you could do a cooking

2597
02:19:02,280 --> 02:19:06,120
show on Twitch and get away with it and you wouldn't, you know, get shut down if you were

2598
02:19:06,120 --> 02:19:08,960
themed like this particular show is.

2599
02:19:08,960 --> 02:19:14,520
So SSJ 100 Matt says, it sounds like the dish where they talk about stuff and cook.

2600
02:19:14,520 --> 02:19:17,240
I think a show like this would work great in America.

2601
02:19:17,240 --> 02:19:21,600
I mean, I don't know if it would show on cable television or whatever, but at the same time,

2602
02:19:21,600 --> 02:19:25,560
like it sounds like not that I would know firsthand, just based on what I've heard,

2603
02:19:25,560 --> 02:19:28,320
it sounds like it would be great stoner TV.

2604
02:19:28,440 --> 02:19:32,280
Like, let's talk about video games and food.

2605
02:19:32,280 --> 02:19:35,800
I think there's an audience for that out there, you guys.

2606
02:19:35,800 --> 02:19:37,800
It's just untapped, I don't know.

2607
02:19:37,800 --> 02:19:40,360
Anyway, Loki, did you find the name of what you were looking for?

2608
02:19:40,360 --> 02:19:44,920
Um, no, I think it's Andrew Ray.

2609
02:19:44,920 --> 02:19:46,760
I have to check, take a look here.

2610
02:19:46,760 --> 02:19:47,760
Yeah, it's Andrew Ray.

2611
02:19:47,760 --> 02:19:51,680
It's called Binging with Babish.

2612
02:19:51,680 --> 02:19:55,160
And so like they do Kevin's famous chili from the office.

2613
02:19:55,200 --> 02:20:02,480
They had the eggs wood house from Archer and that is fucking disgusting.

2614
02:20:02,480 --> 02:20:04,000
This is so heavy.

2615
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:05,240
I kind of want to use that.

2616
02:20:05,240 --> 02:20:07,680
All right, we are going to open up the Skype line right now.

2617
02:20:07,680 --> 02:20:10,920
You can give us a call if you want to talk about anything we've talked about so far tonight,

2618
02:20:10,920 --> 02:20:13,040
or perhaps you have something new you'd like to discuss.

2619
02:20:13,040 --> 02:20:15,960
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

2620
02:20:15,960 --> 02:20:20,240
You can also do the old fashioned way if you must, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2621
02:20:20,240 --> 02:20:24,200
But the phone lines are already ringing at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype, so let's get to it.

2622
02:20:24,240 --> 02:20:25,240
Hi, on Orange Lounge Radio.

2623
02:20:25,240 --> 02:20:26,240
Who's this?

2624
02:20:26,240 --> 02:20:27,240
It's Ron.

2625
02:20:27,240 --> 02:20:28,240
So everyone take a drink.

2626
02:20:28,240 --> 02:20:29,520
Hey, I will do that.

2627
02:20:29,520 --> 02:20:30,520
Here we go.

2628
02:20:30,520 --> 02:20:31,520
Drink.

2629
02:20:31,520 --> 02:20:32,520
Except I only have water.

2630
02:20:32,520 --> 02:20:33,520
Boring.

2631
02:20:33,520 --> 02:20:34,520
It's okay.

2632
02:20:34,520 --> 02:20:35,520
It's all good.

2633
02:20:35,520 --> 02:20:36,680
No soup waffle tonight.

2634
02:20:36,680 --> 02:20:39,760
You got married, so okay, you already did your drinking, so it's all good.

2635
02:20:39,760 --> 02:20:40,760
Maybe a little bit.

2636
02:20:40,760 --> 02:20:45,280
We actually, a funny story, I got to tell this aside because it was one of the moments

2637
02:20:45,280 --> 02:20:47,800
that really got me about the whole wedding, right?

2638
02:20:47,800 --> 02:20:49,760
So you know, we did this as a surprise.

2639
02:20:49,760 --> 02:20:55,340
We didn't tell anybody and in a very 2017 sort of way, we just knew there's really no

2640
02:20:55,340 --> 02:20:57,200
other way to announce it.

2641
02:20:57,200 --> 02:21:01,600
We told everybody on Facebook because that's just the society we live in, right?

2642
02:21:01,600 --> 02:21:03,640
It's a great way to get news out instantly.

2643
02:21:03,640 --> 02:21:06,760
So the reason why I say that is that it was really a surprise to pretty much everybody

2644
02:21:06,760 --> 02:21:08,920
we knew.

2645
02:21:08,920 --> 02:21:12,720
But Alan and I actually, we made reservations because we did this at the courthouse downtown

2646
02:21:12,720 --> 02:21:18,000
and then we made reservations at a really fancy French place to, you know, have dinner

2647
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:23,880
as a married couple for the first time because we knew we weren't going to do any big reception.

2648
02:21:23,880 --> 02:21:28,880
Well when we get to the French restaurant, a friend of mine that I was doing Rocky Horror

2649
02:21:28,880 --> 02:21:32,600
with here in Sacramento happened to be there and she was like, you guys are dressed up

2650
02:21:32,600 --> 02:21:33,600
fancy.

2651
02:21:33,600 --> 02:21:34,600
What's happening?

2652
02:21:34,600 --> 02:21:37,280
And I was like, well actually we just got married and she kind of did that whole like

2653
02:21:37,280 --> 02:21:38,280
what?

2654
02:21:38,280 --> 02:21:39,880
You know, that whole thing of the surprise.

2655
02:21:39,880 --> 02:21:43,400
Well the reason why I tell this story, we ended up getting the table next to them, but

2656
02:21:43,400 --> 02:21:46,480
obviously, you know, we didn't really intrude on whatever they were doing and they didn't

2657
02:21:46,480 --> 02:21:47,480
really intrude on us.

2658
02:21:47,480 --> 02:21:52,120
But we exchanged pleasantries and they were very nice, the table and offering their congratulations

2659
02:21:52,120 --> 02:21:53,120
and all this stuff.

2660
02:21:53,120 --> 02:21:58,160
Well anyway, come the end of the night, the waiter brings by some complimentary champagne.

2661
02:21:58,160 --> 02:22:02,560
It says on the house and we were like, oh okay, we don't, you know, Alan especially

2662
02:22:02,560 --> 02:22:06,720
really doesn't drink at all, but you know, wedding night you can make an exception.

2663
02:22:06,720 --> 02:22:11,000
And you know, I was driving, suddenly had a little bit.

2664
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:13,160
But then we were like, okay, we're ready to pay the bill.

2665
02:22:13,160 --> 02:22:17,360
And he said, oh, your friends at the other table already took care of it.

2666
02:22:17,360 --> 02:22:19,880
And I was like, you've got to be fucking kidding me.

2667
02:22:19,880 --> 02:22:21,400
Like in like the greatest way.

2668
02:22:21,400 --> 02:22:26,080
Like I think we, we let out our first married couple joint gay gasp in unison.

2669
02:22:26,080 --> 02:22:31,380
It turns out my friend and their party there at the table paid the bill for us and they

2670
02:22:31,380 --> 02:22:34,600
got the last surprise in on my wedding day.

2671
02:22:34,600 --> 02:22:37,760
That's pretty, that's pretty fucking awesome.

2672
02:22:37,760 --> 02:22:38,760
Huh?

2673
02:22:38,760 --> 02:22:40,800
I gotta say that's, that's a gesture I won't soon forget.

2674
02:22:40,800 --> 02:22:43,660
And it's one of those things where it's like, it's, it's, it's like impossible to pay back.

2675
02:22:43,660 --> 02:22:44,660
You know what I mean?

2676
02:22:44,660 --> 02:22:50,280
So I will have to pay it forward on some unsuspected married couple in the future.

2677
02:22:50,280 --> 02:22:53,960
Sounds like a plan, but I got a quick story about that and I'll talk about what I wanted

2678
02:22:53,960 --> 02:22:54,960
to call it about.

2679
02:22:54,960 --> 02:22:55,960
Yeah.

2680
02:22:55,960 --> 02:22:58,920
Let's go to the pre Facebook days around the time of MySpace.

2681
02:22:58,920 --> 02:23:04,080
I'm living with my older sister, her then fam, whatever.

2682
02:23:04,080 --> 02:23:06,440
So I get up, get dressed, go to work.

2683
02:23:06,440 --> 02:23:12,720
And I see her all dressed up with her husband, now husband, and I'm like, where y'all going?

2684
02:23:12,720 --> 02:23:15,220
They're like, oh, we're going out for lunch, whatever.

2685
02:23:15,220 --> 02:23:16,880
I'm just like, fine, whatever.

2686
02:23:16,880 --> 02:23:21,020
I go to school, go to work, come back.

2687
02:23:21,020 --> 02:23:23,360
My sister-in-law is stewing at the desk.

2688
02:23:23,360 --> 02:23:25,720
I'm just like, who pissed in your cornflakes?

2689
02:23:25,720 --> 02:23:28,480
And she's like, did you hear what happened?

2690
02:23:28,480 --> 02:23:29,480
No.

2691
02:23:29,480 --> 02:23:32,280
Your sister, my brother got married today.

2692
02:23:32,280 --> 02:23:34,920
I'm like, what do you mean they got married?

2693
02:23:34,920 --> 02:23:36,640
They went down to the courthouse and got married.

2694
02:23:36,640 --> 02:23:41,200
And I'm just sitting there like, well, that explains why they were all dressed up this

2695
02:23:41,200 --> 02:23:43,760
morning, huh?

2696
02:23:43,760 --> 02:23:44,760
That's funny.

2697
02:23:44,760 --> 02:23:48,400
So you, you knew that you'd seen them dressed up, but you, they just like, oh, we're going

2698
02:23:48,400 --> 02:23:49,400
to lunch.

2699
02:23:49,400 --> 02:23:50,400
Oh, okay.

2700
02:23:50,400 --> 02:23:52,160
No biggie.

2701
02:23:52,160 --> 02:23:53,160
That's funny.

2702
02:23:53,160 --> 02:23:54,160
That's a good story.

2703
02:23:54,160 --> 02:23:58,000
No, nobody saw us leaving the house since Alan and I live alone, don't have any roommates

2704
02:23:58,000 --> 02:23:59,000
anymore.

2705
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:01,200
We just, you know, went and did our thing.

2706
02:24:01,200 --> 02:24:03,080
There were a lot of other couples there though.

2707
02:24:03,080 --> 02:24:04,080
Exactly.

2708
02:24:04,080 --> 02:24:10,360
Another, like an older, but another gay couple was doing the same thing we were doing.

2709
02:24:10,360 --> 02:24:11,360
That is hope ruptures.

2710
02:24:11,360 --> 02:24:12,360
Yeah.

2711
02:24:12,360 --> 02:24:14,760
They, they wished us congratulations and we did the same, but there was a variety of couples

2712
02:24:14,760 --> 02:24:15,760
there.

2713
02:24:15,760 --> 02:24:18,680
There was a very young looking couple getting married as well with a few of their family

2714
02:24:18,680 --> 02:24:19,680
members.

2715
02:24:19,680 --> 02:24:22,400
But anyway, marriage, they could talk all night.

2716
02:24:22,400 --> 02:24:23,400
Yeah.

2717
02:24:23,400 --> 02:24:26,040
Now let's talk the switch real quick.

2718
02:24:26,040 --> 02:24:27,040
Sure.

2719
02:24:27,040 --> 02:24:32,080
I don't know if you know, but there, there are some gaming laptops out there where you

2720
02:24:32,080 --> 02:24:34,000
can buy a dock for it.

2721
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:42,160
And in this dock you can add a standard desktop video card and give it more power.

2722
02:24:42,160 --> 02:24:45,600
There are some, there's talk of some docs where you can do that.

2723
02:24:45,600 --> 02:24:50,800
You can add more Ram or another hard drive and stuff like that, hot swapping to make

2724
02:24:50,800 --> 02:24:53,920
it give it more power when you're at home.

2725
02:24:53,920 --> 02:25:00,760
I can see them doing something like that with the switch because I am, I had a feeling the

2726
02:25:00,760 --> 02:25:08,080
dock was just two USBs and additional chip set to give it more power and more memory.

2727
02:25:08,080 --> 02:25:14,840
Now I can see this happening if, if reports are coming out saying that the switch is not

2728
02:25:14,840 --> 02:25:24,480
powerful enough to run next gen games or whatever, I can see Nintendo coming up with a doc that

2729
02:25:24,480 --> 02:25:26,360
can do all this.

2730
02:25:26,360 --> 02:25:30,240
And then, so you must've been, you must've been the one that was talking about this where,

2731
02:25:30,240 --> 02:25:33,320
because I just brought this up with Loki during part a or something about this whole

2732
02:25:33,320 --> 02:25:39,040
fact that they could upgrade the doc, uh, to do like maybe some more power or whatever.

2733
02:25:39,040 --> 02:25:43,720
But Loki, Loki didn't seem to think that would, that would really happen when Nintendo, no,

2734
02:25:43,720 --> 02:25:46,920
it's not going to happen in the system that you're thinking of is like one of the razor

2735
02:25:46,920 --> 02:25:51,080
systems that they have, which are way overpriced in the first place and the performance out

2736
02:25:51,080 --> 02:25:54,920
for those docked, um, units.

2737
02:25:54,920 --> 02:25:59,160
It's just not the same as you would actually being an integrated cards.

2738
02:25:59,160 --> 02:26:03,360
It's not the, the bus isn't as fast besides you're going to be paying like way too much

2739
02:26:03,360 --> 02:26:04,800
money for that.

2740
02:26:04,800 --> 02:26:05,800
Anyways.

2741
02:26:05,800 --> 02:26:11,000
Um, I just, there is, they've already confirmed that there's no additional hardware in that

2742
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:13,240
doc to enhance anything.

2743
02:26:13,240 --> 02:26:17,880
It's just literally the output is changing for the TV cause there's no point in that,

2744
02:26:17,880 --> 02:26:22,120
you know, outputting higher than seven 20 cause that's all the screen supports on them,

2745
02:26:22,120 --> 02:26:23,120
the portable.

2746
02:26:23,120 --> 02:26:26,280
And I would be willing to bet, you know, I haven't looked at it yet and actually one

2747
02:26:26,280 --> 02:26:29,120
thing, funny enough, one of the things that last night I was thinking about, I was like,

2748
02:26:29,120 --> 02:26:33,720
hmm, how much would it cost to make like a switch like device that actually is a PC

2749
02:26:33,720 --> 02:26:35,400
that I can run PC games on?

2750
02:26:35,400 --> 02:26:37,360
Cause that's kind of what I want to do anyways.

2751
02:26:37,360 --> 02:26:42,960
And so I started thinking about it a little bit and um, it probably would be pretty expensive,

2752
02:26:42,960 --> 02:26:49,920
but you know, the way I would have done a doc is basically just had like an HDMI and

2753
02:26:49,920 --> 02:26:54,400
um, power make some sort of exposed like contacts.

2754
02:26:54,400 --> 02:26:58,240
And then when you shove it into the doc, then it makes those connections and everything.

2755
02:26:58,240 --> 02:27:02,200
And I haven't gotten a close up look at the doc, but I'm guessing that's probably how

2756
02:27:02,200 --> 02:27:07,320
it works since I would think that, you know, having like a plug or something sitting inside

2757
02:27:07,320 --> 02:27:10,820
there might, you might break that or might break the connection.

2758
02:27:10,820 --> 02:27:12,580
So that would just make the most sense to me.

2759
02:27:12,580 --> 02:27:18,280
But there's, I don't, there's no additional processing within that unit, within the doc.

2760
02:27:18,280 --> 02:27:20,240
Not even any additional cooling either.

2761
02:27:20,240 --> 02:27:25,240
Oh, I kind of figured much, but that one, the laptop you're talking about, it was, it's

2762
02:27:25,240 --> 02:27:30,640
not a Razer if it is them, it's brand new, but I know it's Alienware that has that.

2763
02:27:30,640 --> 02:27:31,640
Oh, okay.

2764
02:27:31,640 --> 02:27:32,640
Well, whatever.

2765
02:27:32,640 --> 02:27:34,840
I think expensive computers and Razer comes to mind.

2766
02:27:34,840 --> 02:27:36,600
Well, Alienware would be up there too.

2767
02:27:36,600 --> 02:27:37,600
Yes.

2768
02:27:37,600 --> 02:27:40,120
Alienware, they're also ridiculous expensive computers.

2769
02:27:40,120 --> 02:27:41,120
Yeah.

2770
02:27:41,120 --> 02:27:47,180
Well, most Razer laptops look like a really fancy MacBook Pros that run with Windows 10.

2771
02:27:47,180 --> 02:27:50,260
You know, something I've been thinking about though, and I guess this doesn't directly

2772
02:27:50,260 --> 02:27:53,800
relate to the doc thing, but it does a little bit is that I really think a lot of people

2773
02:27:53,800 --> 02:27:58,220
are kind of underestimating this potential, and maybe I'm overthinking it, I don't know,

2774
02:27:58,220 --> 02:28:01,800
but of the Windows 10 game mode and this whole thing that's coming where they're going to

2775
02:28:01,800 --> 02:28:06,320
allow more of your computer processing power to be dedicated to games.

2776
02:28:06,320 --> 02:28:13,480
I would think that this is really going to put PCs in line with what we see Project Scorpio

2777
02:28:13,480 --> 02:28:18,600
is going to end up being capable of, and yet there's this whole ecosystem of you can buy

2778
02:28:18,600 --> 02:28:24,320
the game once and you get it on both Xbox One and Windows 10 or whatever.

2779
02:28:24,320 --> 02:28:28,900
It's almost like Project Scorpio, whatever that ends up being, is going to be your doc

2780
02:28:28,900 --> 02:28:29,900
in a way.

2781
02:28:29,900 --> 02:28:30,900
I don't know.

2782
02:28:30,900 --> 02:28:33,680
It's just something weird I've been thinking about, but I'm really curious what a game

2783
02:28:33,680 --> 02:28:37,560
changer, wink nod, game mode's going to be in Windows 10.

2784
02:28:37,560 --> 02:28:45,760
Well, I can't say this much about Project Scorpio, modular.

2785
02:28:45,760 --> 02:28:50,240
But that's usually why people stay away from PCs and go to consoles, is because of the

2786
02:28:50,240 --> 02:28:51,240
whole modular thing.

2787
02:28:51,240 --> 02:28:54,320
So it'd be weird if they did that.

2788
02:28:54,320 --> 02:28:55,320
But here's the thing.

2789
02:28:55,320 --> 02:28:56,320
Yeah.

2790
02:28:56,320 --> 02:28:57,320
PCs are modular.

2791
02:28:57,320 --> 02:29:02,120
It doesn't take much to do upgrades, but it does take a lot of thought and requirement

2792
02:29:02,120 --> 02:29:04,800
if you really want to do proper upgrades or whatever.

2793
02:29:04,800 --> 02:29:10,000
The way I see Scorpio's going with modular upgrades, it's going to stay on there compatible

2794
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:11,000
with this.

2795
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:12,000
It's going to work.

2796
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:13,160
They're going to keep it simple as possible.

2797
02:29:13,160 --> 02:29:17,560
They're going to try to make it as simple as possible.

2798
02:29:17,560 --> 02:29:19,560
I don't think they're going to do that.

2799
02:29:19,560 --> 02:29:23,840
And honestly, I think it's just going to be just a simple setup where they sell a console.

2800
02:29:23,840 --> 02:29:27,160
It wouldn't make any sense anyways, because the first thing you're going to have happen,

2801
02:29:27,160 --> 02:29:31,000
especially now that it's Windows 10 stuff, you have a lot of these games that are Xbox

2802
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:35,240
One that run on Windows 10, especially if you're looking at first-party titles.

2803
02:29:35,240 --> 02:29:39,880
I mean, of course, once the specs come out for this and the price, they're just going

2804
02:29:39,880 --> 02:29:43,920
to be like, okay, what kind of PC can it build for that same amount of money spec-wise?

2805
02:29:43,920 --> 02:29:46,720
And I'm sure that they'll be able to come up with something that's more powerful than

2806
02:29:46,720 --> 02:29:47,720
it.

2807
02:29:47,720 --> 02:29:50,680
It's just, I don't know.

2808
02:29:50,680 --> 02:29:55,440
I had to see what enhancements this is actually going to offer for the price.

2809
02:29:55,440 --> 02:30:00,560
And I doubt that it would go modular, because what's the point at that point?

2810
02:30:00,560 --> 02:30:03,960
I mean, why wouldn't you just buy a PC at that point?

2811
02:30:03,960 --> 02:30:07,200
And for the average consumer, that doesn't make any sense either, because they're not

2812
02:30:07,200 --> 02:30:09,920
going to understand how to upgrade a system.

2813
02:30:09,920 --> 02:30:16,800
Well, I mean, I know I've talked to a lot of people who talk about how to build their

2814
02:30:16,800 --> 02:30:21,540
computers and so forth, and for some it's easy, and others it's quite overwhelming.

2815
02:30:21,540 --> 02:30:22,540
So I get it.

2816
02:30:22,540 --> 02:30:29,040
I mean, you could spend $400 to build a pretty decent gaming PC, or you spend $400 on a powerful

2817
02:30:29,040 --> 02:30:32,680
console, everything is set, grab it, plug, and go.

2818
02:30:32,680 --> 02:30:33,960
It's just what it boils down to.

2819
02:30:33,960 --> 02:30:38,000
They just, people, console players, they want to keep it simple as possible.

2820
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:41,680
All right, well, we'll see.

2821
02:30:41,680 --> 02:30:45,480
We got E3 is going to unveil a lot, I think, in that regard.

2822
02:30:45,480 --> 02:30:48,160
I think Microsoft will pour a lot into E3, so we'll see.

2823
02:30:48,160 --> 02:30:50,560
But anyway, Brahma, I'm going to let you go so we can get more calls, okay?

2824
02:30:50,560 --> 02:30:51,560
Oh, no problem, dude.

2825
02:30:51,560 --> 02:30:52,560
All right.

2826
02:30:52,560 --> 02:30:53,560
Anime Jam session.

2827
02:30:53,560 --> 02:30:54,560
Everybody listen.

2828
02:30:54,560 --> 02:30:55,560
Damn right.

2829
02:30:55,560 --> 02:30:56,560
All right.

2830
02:30:56,560 --> 02:30:57,560
Take care, my friend.

2831
02:30:57,560 --> 02:30:58,560
You too.

2832
02:30:58,560 --> 02:30:59,560
Bye.

2833
02:30:59,560 --> 02:31:00,560
All right.

2834
02:31:00,560 --> 02:31:01,560
Skypline's lit tonight.

2835
02:31:01,560 --> 02:31:02,560
Let's get to the next call.

2836
02:31:02,560 --> 02:31:03,560
Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.

2837
02:31:04,160 --> 02:31:05,160
Hi, this is YYR.

2838
02:31:05,160 --> 02:31:06,160
Hey, my friend.

2839
02:31:06,160 --> 02:31:09,640
Ooh, you're echoing just a little bit, but hopefully Skype will equalize there.

2840
02:31:09,640 --> 02:31:11,760
But what's on your mind, my friend?

2841
02:31:11,760 --> 02:31:13,360
Sorry if there's echoing.

2842
02:31:13,360 --> 02:31:16,680
It's because I'm in my dining room and there isn't much on the walls yet.

2843
02:31:16,680 --> 02:31:17,680
Ah, okay.

2844
02:31:17,680 --> 02:31:18,680
That makes sense.

2845
02:31:18,680 --> 02:31:19,680
So what's up?

2846
02:31:19,680 --> 02:31:22,680
Well, first of all, I wanted to say congratulations to you and Alan.

2847
02:31:22,680 --> 02:31:23,680
Welcome to the club.

2848
02:31:23,680 --> 02:31:24,680
Thank you.

2849
02:31:24,680 --> 02:31:25,680
I appreciate that.

2850
02:31:25,680 --> 02:31:26,680
That's right.

2851
02:31:26,680 --> 02:31:27,680
You got married just in the past year, too.

2852
02:31:27,680 --> 02:31:30,200
You were here right after your wedding, yeah.

2853
02:31:30,200 --> 02:31:31,200
Yeah.

2854
02:31:31,840 --> 02:31:37,020
It's wonderful, and I hope you guys have many, many, many, many, many years of bliss.

2855
02:31:37,020 --> 02:31:38,020
Thank you.

2856
02:31:38,020 --> 02:31:39,020
We'll try.

2857
02:31:39,020 --> 02:31:43,960
I will say this much on the thing you just talked about as far as why I don't think game

2858
02:31:43,960 --> 02:31:46,800
mode is going to be a game changer.

2859
02:31:46,800 --> 02:31:48,720
Universal Windows Platform.

2860
02:31:48,720 --> 02:31:49,720
You did here, right?

2861
02:31:49,720 --> 02:31:50,720
Oh, yeah.

2862
02:31:50,720 --> 02:31:52,340
That's a fair point, I suppose.

2863
02:31:52,340 --> 02:31:59,740
It's limited to UWP apps, so until the Windows Store is less of a piece of crap, I don't

2864
02:31:59,780 --> 02:32:01,820
think it's going to really gain much traction.

2865
02:32:01,820 --> 02:32:03,180
All right.

2866
02:32:03,180 --> 02:32:04,180
Fair perspective.

2867
02:32:04,180 --> 02:32:05,180
Fair perspective.

2868
02:32:05,180 --> 02:32:08,380
Well, what did you want to call in tonight about before you heard that?

2869
02:32:08,380 --> 02:32:09,380
Well, you know what?

2870
02:32:09,380 --> 02:32:14,300
I wanted to mention something that has pretty much flown under the radar because it's very

2871
02:32:14,300 --> 02:32:22,240
niche news, but fortunately, it's in our niche, so I think it's very appropriate that you

2872
02:32:22,240 --> 02:32:25,900
guys all know about this.

2873
02:32:25,900 --> 02:32:31,180
Have you heard of the Konami Arcade Championship?

2874
02:32:31,180 --> 02:32:36,500
I feel like yes because you brought it up before, but otherwise, no.

2875
02:32:36,500 --> 02:32:38,700
It's not something I've been actively following.

2876
02:32:38,700 --> 02:32:39,700
Okay.

2877
02:32:39,700 --> 02:32:43,600
Well, this is the sixth year that Konami has run this.

2878
02:32:43,600 --> 02:32:50,820
It's basically a yearly tournament for all of their Bimani games, and they hold preliminaries

2879
02:32:50,820 --> 02:32:58,320
over e-amusement on pretty much all the Bimani games, 2DX, SoundVoltex, what have you.

2880
02:32:58,320 --> 02:33:02,900
People compete in the preliminaries just by playing the game and playing the songs out

2881
02:33:02,900 --> 02:33:05,580
of the qualifying folder.

2882
02:33:05,580 --> 02:33:12,460
When the qualifiers are all done, basically, the top players get an all-expenses-paid trip

2883
02:33:12,460 --> 02:33:16,140
to Tokyo, where they compete in the finals.

2884
02:33:16,140 --> 02:33:17,140
Okay.

2885
02:33:17,140 --> 02:33:23,620
Well, interestingly enough, you may recall that this past year was the first year that

2886
02:33:23,620 --> 02:33:31,700
we have ever had a version of DDR released in North America officially with e-amusement.

2887
02:33:31,700 --> 02:33:36,820
Right, with DDR-Ace and the fact that round ones have them, right.

2888
02:33:36,820 --> 02:33:43,820
And so, North America was officially added as a competition region for the Konami Arcade

2889
02:33:43,820 --> 02:33:45,980
Championships in DDR-Ace.

2890
02:33:45,980 --> 02:33:48,860
I feel like there's a punchline coming.

2891
02:33:48,860 --> 02:34:01,740
Well, California's own Chris Chyke, aka IAmChrisForLife, and Jeff Lloyd, aka Funga, have qualified

2892
02:34:01,740 --> 02:34:08,740
first and second place overall, as well as a third person who I don't know personally,

2893
02:34:08,740 --> 02:34:14,380
and they will all be flying to Japan next month to represent us in the finals, which

2894
02:34:14,380 --> 02:34:18,620
will be streamed live in February over Konami's website.

2895
02:34:18,620 --> 02:34:21,140
Oh, there's no punchline.

2896
02:34:21,140 --> 02:34:22,140
This is good news.

2897
02:34:22,140 --> 02:34:23,460
This is great news.

2898
02:34:23,460 --> 02:34:27,100
I was expecting some huge Konami fuckup as a punchline.

2899
02:34:27,100 --> 02:34:28,820
That's the day and age that we live in.

2900
02:34:28,820 --> 02:34:34,780
We're like, oh, the scores got deleted, or Konami rendered it ineligible, or the machines

2901
02:34:34,780 --> 02:34:40,860
deleted themselves, or I was expecting some colossal Konami fuckup as a punchline.

2902
02:34:40,860 --> 02:34:41,860
And there's not one.

2903
02:34:41,860 --> 02:34:43,180
This story has a happy ending.

2904
02:34:43,740 --> 02:34:45,140
No, no, this is amazing.

2905
02:34:45,140 --> 02:34:47,780
I'm really looking forward to this.

2906
02:34:47,780 --> 02:34:53,700
I hope to pass this along to some major gaming websites and see if they pick up on it, because

2907
02:34:53,700 --> 02:34:56,900
I feel like this is a story you're not going to hear very often.

2908
02:34:56,900 --> 02:35:01,500
I mean, first of all, DDR's kind of an e-sport already.

2909
02:35:01,500 --> 02:35:04,300
There's some that listen to this show that might pluck it, but we'll see.

2910
02:35:04,300 --> 02:35:05,300
I know you're out there.

2911
02:35:05,300 --> 02:35:06,780
I know you're out there.

2912
02:35:06,780 --> 02:35:07,780
Say hi sometimes.

2913
02:35:07,780 --> 02:35:15,460
Every day, you see North Americans flying to the host country to challenge their best

2914
02:35:15,460 --> 02:35:20,380
at their own game, and I mean, they're all friends anyway, but it's going to be amazing

2915
02:35:20,380 --> 02:35:21,380
to watch.

2916
02:35:21,380 --> 02:35:22,380
Yeah, that'll be great.

2917
02:35:22,380 --> 02:35:28,460
I mean, finally, here we are in 2017, and Konami is finally kind of recognizing the

2918
02:35:28,460 --> 02:35:30,100
global audience of DDR.

2919
02:35:30,100 --> 02:35:31,100
That's fucking fantastic.

2920
02:35:31,100 --> 02:35:36,620
God, I wish it had been that way when we started this show 15 years ago, but say it with me.

2921
02:35:36,620 --> 02:35:41,780
And having spoken to both of the number one and number two players at MAGFest, they were

2922
02:35:41,780 --> 02:35:43,900
both there trying Kyle Ward's new game.

2923
02:35:43,900 --> 02:35:44,900
Did you get to try it?

2924
02:35:44,900 --> 02:35:46,140
I hope you did.

2925
02:35:46,140 --> 02:35:47,140
Here's the thing.

2926
02:35:47,140 --> 02:35:51,380
On my flight over there, I kind of fucked up my leg, so I had a problem kind of walking

2927
02:35:51,380 --> 02:35:53,480
around, so I didn't really get to...

2928
02:35:53,480 --> 02:35:59,260
I did like basic steps on, okay, because there was a fucking solo fourth mix, and I can't

2929
02:35:59,260 --> 02:36:00,260
not play solo.

2930
02:36:00,260 --> 02:36:04,300
So I played lightly, but there were so many crowds around Step Maniacs.

2931
02:36:04,300 --> 02:36:10,100
I did not play myself, however, my good pal, Jonko, who used to be on a show called Koopa

2932
02:36:10,100 --> 02:36:14,380
Club, we're really good friends now, and we were there, I watched him play.

2933
02:36:14,380 --> 02:36:19,140
He's still really good at those music games, his feet flying and all that stuff.

2934
02:36:19,140 --> 02:36:22,500
I can't keep up with him in my advancing age.

2935
02:36:22,500 --> 02:36:25,680
But I watched him play, so I feel like I got a good sense of the game, because I stood

2936
02:36:25,680 --> 02:36:28,300
there and I watched like, oh, it's a touch screen.

2937
02:36:28,300 --> 02:36:29,300
Oh, he kind of...

2938
02:36:29,300 --> 02:36:30,300
Oh, I see.

2939
02:36:30,300 --> 02:36:31,820
Kyle kind of took the re-rave cabinet and did something new with it.

2940
02:36:31,820 --> 02:36:33,260
Yeah, I was thrown by that too.

2941
02:36:33,260 --> 02:36:36,460
Yeah, so that was, you know, and I kind of liked that.

2942
02:36:36,460 --> 02:36:37,460
So it was really hard to hear.

2943
02:36:37,460 --> 02:36:39,340
And all of them were Matrixwalk jokes.

2944
02:36:39,340 --> 02:36:40,340
Yeah.

2945
02:36:40,340 --> 02:36:41,340
Yeah, yeah.

2946
02:36:41,340 --> 02:36:42,340
No more of that, huh?

2947
02:36:42,340 --> 02:36:49,260
It was really hard to hear in the songs themselves, but I certainly caught that not only did he

2948
02:36:49,260 --> 02:36:54,520
get to pluck some of the very classic DDR songs, I caught some Captain Jack in there,

2949
02:36:54,520 --> 02:36:55,580
but you know, kind of like...

2950
02:36:55,580 --> 02:37:00,420
And this was always the case with not just In the Groove, but then his later stuff, like

2951
02:37:00,420 --> 02:37:06,580
Re-Rave, where it's like, oh, there's an erotic song, a Smile DK song, you know, Kyle's very

2952
02:37:06,580 --> 02:37:12,580
self-aware and clearly must be, must have some sort of Konami's blessing slash we won't

2953
02:37:12,580 --> 02:37:17,460
sue you slash 10% of the profits type thing that allows this game to exist.

2954
02:37:17,460 --> 02:37:19,980
Well, you know, I did ask him about that.

2955
02:37:19,980 --> 02:37:22,180
I would be shocked if he can talk about it.

2956
02:37:22,180 --> 02:37:27,180
Well, basically what he said to me was, it was disgust.

2957
02:37:27,180 --> 02:37:30,260
But beyond that, he said he couldn't tell me.

2958
02:37:30,260 --> 02:37:31,900
He was not at liberty to tell me.

2959
02:37:31,900 --> 02:37:37,620
So what I gather from that is that they did discuss something and he's under NDA right

2960
02:37:37,620 --> 02:37:38,620
now.

2961
02:37:38,620 --> 02:37:39,620
Yeah.

2962
02:37:39,620 --> 02:37:40,620
Yeah.

2963
02:37:40,620 --> 02:37:41,620
And that's understandable.

2964
02:37:41,620 --> 02:37:45,740
They've worked something out, but the terms he can't disclose, I mean, that's a business

2965
02:37:45,740 --> 02:37:46,740
deal.

2966
02:37:46,740 --> 02:37:47,740
It's, you know, that's...

2967
02:37:47,740 --> 02:37:50,500
Which says to me that maybe that's good news.

2968
02:37:50,500 --> 02:37:51,500
So...

2969
02:37:51,500 --> 02:37:52,500
Oh, I think it is.

2970
02:37:52,500 --> 02:37:53,500
I think he...

2971
02:37:53,500 --> 02:37:54,500
Well, I mean, I don't know.

2972
02:37:54,500 --> 02:37:55,500
Fuck it.

2973
02:37:55,500 --> 02:37:57,380
I just need to invite him back on the show when he's ready.

2974
02:37:57,380 --> 02:38:00,660
He might not be ready to talk about the whole thing yet, but when he's ready, we can get

2975
02:38:00,660 --> 02:38:01,820
everything firsthand.

2976
02:38:01,820 --> 02:38:07,220
But yeah, I would, you know, I anticipate he's going big with this and he, you know,

2977
02:38:07,220 --> 02:38:09,860
even in just interviewing him on our show, what, God, it was probably two or three years

2978
02:38:09,860 --> 02:38:10,860
ago at this point.

2979
02:38:10,860 --> 02:38:15,460
No, the same year as PAX East Boston, so that was what, 2014, right?

2980
02:38:15,460 --> 02:38:16,460
So...

2981
02:38:16,460 --> 02:38:17,460
Sounds right.

2982
02:38:17,460 --> 02:38:18,460
Yeah.

2983
02:38:18,460 --> 02:38:19,460
So it was a little over two years ago.

2984
02:38:20,380 --> 02:38:24,740
He's definitely learned a lot from the legal perspective than what we were talking years

2985
02:38:24,740 --> 02:38:25,740
ago.

2986
02:38:25,740 --> 02:38:29,300
So I think the man knows how to cross his T's and dot his I's, so...

2987
02:38:29,300 --> 02:38:39,060
Yeah, and just to finish up, I'll just say, having talked to both Chris and Jeff at MAGFest,

2988
02:38:39,060 --> 02:38:43,740
they're hoping that Konami uses, you know, this opportunity to have the North Americans

2989
02:38:43,740 --> 02:38:47,260
come and compete at the highest level over there.

2990
02:38:47,260 --> 02:38:52,020
They're hoping that that will encourage Konami to expand their offerings further to North

2991
02:38:52,020 --> 02:38:54,460
America.

2992
02:38:54,460 --> 02:38:57,140
So I hope that's what comes out of it too.

2993
02:38:57,140 --> 02:38:58,140
That would be great.

2994
02:38:58,140 --> 02:39:01,100
And JD actually clarifies it was May 3rd, 2015.

2995
02:39:01,100 --> 02:39:02,100
It really took that long.

2996
02:39:02,100 --> 02:39:03,360
I thought it was...

2997
02:39:03,360 --> 02:39:05,020
My ears are blending together at this point.

2998
02:39:05,020 --> 02:39:06,580
I guess it was 2015 that was PAX East.

2999
02:39:06,580 --> 02:39:08,940
I know how you feel.

3000
02:39:08,940 --> 02:39:09,940
It's just a blur.

3001
02:39:09,940 --> 02:39:14,340
Yeah, that makes sense because my first MAG was 2016 and I switched to MAG from PAX East,

3002
02:39:14,340 --> 02:39:15,340
which I went on to.

3003
02:39:15,340 --> 02:39:16,340
All right, it makes sense.

3004
02:39:16,420 --> 02:39:18,300
Don't fucking bring facts into this, JD.

3005
02:39:18,300 --> 02:39:20,300
I hate it when you do that.

3006
02:39:20,300 --> 02:39:24,980
All right, let me put this out though, because I think this is an important point.

3007
02:39:24,980 --> 02:39:28,540
I want to get your perspective on this, being a big music game fan and being one of the

3008
02:39:28,540 --> 02:39:32,420
people that really convinced me to give MAG a try.

3009
02:39:32,420 --> 02:39:37,180
There's a lot of rumor, well, not even rumor, just we all see what's happening on Reddit

3010
02:39:37,180 --> 02:39:40,020
between MAGFest and Tokyo Attack.

3011
02:39:40,020 --> 02:39:44,980
And Tokyo Attack has pretty much said, we're out for next MAGFest, not happening.

3012
02:39:44,980 --> 02:39:48,860
So what's your reaction to that whole thing, being a music game fan?

3013
02:39:48,860 --> 02:39:52,460
Well, I did talk to Anthony while I was there.

3014
02:39:52,460 --> 02:40:01,500
Anthony is the head of Tokyo Attack and he said that MAGFest's organization has gotten

3015
02:40:01,500 --> 02:40:08,500
to be very complex, as you would expect when it's grown to the size that it has.

3016
02:40:08,500 --> 02:40:10,980
Well, it's splintering now too.

3017
02:40:10,980 --> 02:40:14,060
I'm just saying we're going to have MAG West this year.

3018
02:40:14,060 --> 02:40:17,420
They have traveling MAG shows, they have the tiny MAG show they still do.

3019
02:40:17,420 --> 02:40:22,900
I mean, there's all these MAG spinoffs, so definitely there's a lot of parts to the machine.

3020
02:40:22,900 --> 02:40:26,220
Definitely, many more than there used to be.

3021
02:40:26,220 --> 02:40:34,060
And basically he said that it's been difficult to coordinate and to deal with the various

3022
02:40:34,060 --> 02:40:39,700
heads of the Hydra, much more so now than it used to be, and he's gotten frustrated

3023
02:40:39,700 --> 02:40:41,220
with it.

3024
02:40:41,220 --> 02:40:46,060
And you know, it's his company and he has the right to make those kind of decisions

3025
02:40:46,060 --> 02:40:48,180
and I respect that.

3026
02:40:48,180 --> 02:40:54,020
And I know that definitely there'll be some holes in the lineup if they're gone.

3027
02:40:54,020 --> 02:41:02,780
I know that they brought Beatstream, they brought SoundVoltex and Muzecca and Bishi

3028
02:41:02,780 --> 02:41:09,340
Bashi as they usually do, and many other very niche, very unique games.

3029
02:41:09,340 --> 02:41:16,620
But that being said, if you go just by the number of machines that were there, the number

3030
02:41:16,620 --> 02:41:25,700
of Pump and DDR and just music games in general, even Ubeat, I would say Tokyo Attack wasn't

3031
02:41:25,700 --> 02:41:30,340
even 50% of it, probably closer to 30 to 40.

3032
02:41:30,340 --> 02:41:37,780
And so if they're not there, it's not like you won't still see 10 DDR machines.

3033
02:41:37,780 --> 02:41:44,180
You may not get all of the games, but there will still be plenty of music games there.

3034
02:41:44,180 --> 02:41:49,460
I hope Tokyo is still, I know this doesn't do you Northeasterners a lot of good unless

3035
02:41:49,460 --> 02:41:53,700
you travel, but I still hope Tokyo Attack has a relationship with Dragon Con, because

3036
02:41:53,700 --> 02:41:56,300
that was a great addition to Dragon Con last year, so we'll see.

3037
02:41:56,300 --> 02:42:00,140
It's not on their calendar yet, but I don't think they have a lot past the first couple

3038
02:42:00,140 --> 02:42:01,140
months of the year.

3039
02:42:01,140 --> 02:42:04,940
Well, I mean, Anthony wasn't talking about, well, I'm done with conventions.

3040
02:42:04,940 --> 02:42:08,780
He only specifically mentioned MagFest, so honestly, I don't think it'll affect Dragon

3041
02:42:08,780 --> 02:42:13,180
Con or Otacon or any of the other conventions that they've been doing regularly.

3042
02:42:13,180 --> 02:42:18,420
Yeah, and they are confirmed for MomoCon, which is kind of the sister convention now

3043
02:42:18,420 --> 02:42:20,060
in Atlanta.

3044
02:42:20,060 --> 02:42:23,960
And what was the other thing I was going to say, oh yeah, they took that setup right over

3045
02:42:23,960 --> 02:42:28,620
to the other side of DC, where Awesome Games Done Quick was doing their thing, like right

3046
02:42:28,620 --> 02:42:30,300
as Mag was ending.

3047
02:42:30,300 --> 02:42:34,020
So they're very good at what they do, for sure, for sure.

3048
02:42:34,100 --> 02:42:38,060
Anyway, my friend, I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up, but thanks for your call.

3049
02:42:38,060 --> 02:42:42,780
Hey, you're welcome, and congratulations again, and I hope you guys all have a great week.

3050
02:42:42,780 --> 02:42:43,780
Thank you, you too.

3051
02:42:43,780 --> 02:42:44,780
Take care, my friend.

3052
02:42:44,780 --> 02:42:45,780
Yep, take care.

3053
02:42:45,780 --> 02:42:46,780
All right.

3054
02:42:46,780 --> 02:42:47,780
Bye.

3055
02:42:47,780 --> 02:42:49,420
I think that is going to do it for the Skypline tonight.

3056
02:42:49,420 --> 02:42:52,700
I'm sorry for those that didn't get through tonight, but you can always send us an email

3057
02:42:52,700 --> 02:42:58,700
over at Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, but we are about done for the night, unless

3058
02:42:58,700 --> 02:43:01,540
I do need to check in and see if Loki has any last-minute stories for us tonight.

3059
02:43:01,540 --> 02:43:03,500
I do have a couple last-minute stories, actually.

3060
02:43:03,500 --> 02:43:04,740
Please, go for it.

3061
02:43:04,740 --> 02:43:12,420
So I guess it only makes sense, since VR is now a thing, but apparently, a VR film company

3062
02:43:12,420 --> 02:43:20,180
is rebooting the movie series Lawmoor Man, and it's going to be only viewable in a VR

3063
02:43:20,180 --> 02:43:21,180
headset.

3064
02:43:21,180 --> 02:43:23,460
So they're developing a new series based on that.

3065
02:43:23,460 --> 02:43:26,540
I'm not sure if that's going to be like a TV series, movies, or something like that,

3066
02:43:26,540 --> 02:43:33,460
but they're going to be VR movies now, so that'd be kind of cool to see.

3067
02:43:33,500 --> 02:43:34,500
Excited about that.

3068
02:43:34,500 --> 02:43:41,060
Lawmoor Man 2 was not so good, but, you know, it's got its nostalgia.

3069
02:43:41,060 --> 02:43:47,540
And then, I wanted to mention Games Done Quick did $2.2 million this year, so that's raised

3070
02:43:47,540 --> 02:43:50,580
quite a bit of money, and I got to watch quite a bit of that.

3071
02:43:50,580 --> 02:43:57,020
That's what I was doing in between playing games, so I'm probably going to check out

3072
02:43:57,020 --> 02:43:59,780
more of those on-demand videos for that as well.

3073
02:43:59,780 --> 02:44:08,940
And finally, EA's Patrick Soderlund, he had made a comment regarding Nintendo Switch,

3074
02:44:08,940 --> 02:44:13,220
and basically saying, I spoke only about FIFA today, but our company's structure let us

3075
02:44:13,220 --> 02:44:18,420
release all sorts of games for every platform, so we'll go wherever the gamers go.

3076
02:44:18,420 --> 02:44:22,780
I think Nintendo Switch will put Nintendo at the forefront of the game industry once

3077
02:44:22,780 --> 02:44:23,780
again.

3078
02:44:23,780 --> 02:44:27,220
Their approach is quite different from anything they've done in the past.

3079
02:44:27,220 --> 02:44:31,940
We've listened to EA, Activision, and other companies since the beginning of the Switch's

3080
02:44:31,940 --> 02:44:35,380
development, so we've been involved through the whole process.

3081
02:44:35,380 --> 02:44:40,040
They teamed up with us because they wanted to guarantee the console would be a success.

3082
02:44:40,040 --> 02:44:42,660
Doing business with Nintendo is very important to us.

3083
02:44:42,660 --> 02:44:46,380
We'd like to bring more and more games over for everyone.

3084
02:44:46,380 --> 02:44:49,140
So maybe third parties are on board.

3085
02:44:49,140 --> 02:44:53,500
All I'm saying right now is based off of what I've seen them announce, I'm not entirely

3086
02:44:53,500 --> 02:44:54,940
convinced yet.

3087
02:44:54,940 --> 02:44:59,100
And based on what YYR says in chat, I kind of tend to agree, where YYR says, I take this

3088
02:44:59,100 --> 02:45:01,620
EA statement to mean the same as last time on Wii U.

3089
02:45:01,620 --> 02:45:03,420
If people buy it, we will come.

3090
02:45:03,420 --> 02:45:05,300
And last time didn't happen.

3091
02:45:05,300 --> 02:45:06,300
Yeah.

3092
02:45:06,300 --> 02:45:08,300
All right.

3093
02:45:08,300 --> 02:45:11,820
And let's see, what else?

3094
02:45:11,820 --> 02:45:13,820
That's pretty much it, sadly.

3095
02:45:13,820 --> 02:45:14,820
All right.

3096
02:45:14,820 --> 02:45:19,220
Well, that is going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

3097
02:45:19,220 --> 02:45:22,040
Thank you guys so much for listening to the show tonight.

3098
02:45:22,040 --> 02:45:24,180
We appreciate all the support.

3099
02:45:24,220 --> 02:45:28,820
As a reminder, you can leave us a nice five-star review on a place like iTunes or Google Play

3100
02:45:28,820 --> 02:45:29,820
or what have you.

3101
02:45:29,820 --> 02:45:31,220
That stuff goes a very long way.

3102
02:45:31,220 --> 02:45:32,660
We really appreciate it.

3103
02:45:32,660 --> 02:45:38,100
Also, we don't ask for your money here on the show, so you can always spread us via

3104
02:45:38,100 --> 02:45:39,100
word of mouth.

3105
02:45:39,100 --> 02:45:40,100
It goes a long way.

3106
02:45:40,100 --> 02:45:45,740
Tell a friend or two about the show because we can't have an audience and voices to hear

3107
02:45:45,740 --> 02:45:48,420
from if they're not here to share them.

3108
02:45:48,420 --> 02:45:49,420
But that's going to do it.

3109
02:45:49,420 --> 02:45:50,420
Hooray.

3110
02:45:50,420 --> 02:45:53,420
We made it through the show without a power outage, although I think the rain kind of

3111
02:45:53,420 --> 02:45:54,420
stopped.

3112
02:45:54,420 --> 02:45:55,420
Yeah, it was weird.

3113
02:45:55,420 --> 02:45:59,140
Last night, if we were doing the show, that would have been kind of iffy because it was

3114
02:45:59,140 --> 02:46:00,780
like 50, 60 mile an hour winds.

3115
02:46:00,780 --> 02:46:02,940
The wind woke me up at four in the morning.

3116
02:46:02,940 --> 02:46:03,940
I don't know if you saw.

3117
02:46:03,940 --> 02:46:06,700
Okay, so you know how the storms last week blew our fence over?

3118
02:46:06,700 --> 02:46:07,700
Oh, I didn't know that.

3119
02:46:07,700 --> 02:46:12,460
So they fixed it, and now last night, the other half of it blew over.

3120
02:46:12,460 --> 02:46:15,260
Yeah, it was bad.

3121
02:46:15,260 --> 02:46:16,380
It was almost like a hurricane.

3122
02:46:16,380 --> 02:46:18,740
I'm sure some of you East Coasters are like, that's nothing.

3123
02:46:18,740 --> 02:46:23,460
But keep in mind, California isn't built with that kind of weather in mind.

3124
02:46:23,460 --> 02:46:28,140
So 60 mile an hour winds is a pretty fucking big deal, and it's fucked up the fence.

3125
02:46:28,140 --> 02:46:31,220
I thought it was done raining this morning, but apparently it started raining again.

3126
02:46:31,220 --> 02:46:33,100
It's supposed to be like off and on Sunday.

3127
02:46:33,100 --> 02:46:37,860
It's supposed to be moist and unstable, just like me, through tomorrow, through Monday,

3128
02:46:37,860 --> 02:46:40,820
and then finally sun for a week.

3129
02:46:40,820 --> 02:46:42,180
So that'll be nice.

3130
02:46:42,180 --> 02:46:43,540
Nice little break here.

3131
02:46:43,540 --> 02:46:49,420
So speaking of, in a week, we will see you back here in a week, in seven days, where

3132
02:46:49,420 --> 02:46:52,740
we will do another episode of Orange Launch Radio, talk about whatever happened in gaming

3133
02:46:52,740 --> 02:46:53,740
that week.

3134
02:46:53,740 --> 02:46:55,900
Hopefully maybe we can get another interview for you guys.

3135
02:46:55,900 --> 02:47:01,960
Dark Soccer should be back in seven days, and lots of bright sunshine finally.

3136
02:47:01,960 --> 02:47:05,780
So maybe we can get outside and play more things like Pokemon Go and the outdoor games.

3137
02:47:05,780 --> 02:47:08,540
But for now, we're gonna do it.

3138
02:47:08,540 --> 02:47:12,360
We're gonna end this episode of Orange Launch Radio and say we'll see you in seven days.

3139
02:47:12,360 --> 02:47:14,080
Have a great week, everybody.

3140
02:47:14,080 --> 02:47:15,600
Thanks Matt Baume for being here tonight.

3141
02:47:15,600 --> 02:47:19,280
Thank you guys for being here tonight in chat or via the podcast.

3142
02:47:19,280 --> 02:47:21,440
We'll see you next time here at Orange Launch Radio.

3143
02:47:21,440 --> 02:47:22,440
