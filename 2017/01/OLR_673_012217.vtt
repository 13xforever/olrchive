00:00.000 --> 00:18.120
This week, the internet speculates that Nintendo copied the copiers by selling ROMs downloaded

00:18.120 --> 00:20.080
from the internet for its Virtual Console games.

00:20.080 --> 00:22.960
But if owning a game means you can download a ROM, doesn't that also extend to the rights

00:22.960 --> 00:23.960
holder?

00:23.960 --> 00:26.680
And that's just one of many stories coming up right now on the show, where every gamer

00:26.680 --> 00:27.680
has a voice.

00:27.680 --> 00:31.600
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.600 --> 00:34.920
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

00:34.920 --> 00:36.600
where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.600 --> 00:39.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio.

00:39.000 --> 00:45.280
Live tonight, episode number 673 for this January the 22nd of 2017.

00:45.280 --> 00:50.640
My name is Rob Roberts, joining you in lovely Studio N7 in Sacramento, California.

00:50.640 --> 00:53.880
Not joining us tonight unfortunately, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

00:53.880 --> 00:59.000
She has a little bit of a sinus infection type thing and it also is kind of stormy outside,

00:59.000 --> 01:01.640
like thunder, lightning, the whole works.

01:01.640 --> 01:05.320
So she didn't feel up to the trip out here tonight because it does take her a good 20-30

01:05.320 --> 01:06.320
minutes to get over here.

01:06.320 --> 01:11.800
So she will, however, call us later in the show to do her regular segment, the classic

01:11.800 --> 01:14.000
system of the month this week.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
So we'll check in with her at that time.

01:16.000 --> 01:20.120
But we do have in studio, as he is every week, say hello to Tech Master Loki.

01:20.360 --> 01:22.360
Now is the classic system of the month...

01:22.360 --> 01:23.360
Oh, you're not...

01:23.360 --> 01:25.800
A classic Loki with no mic on.

01:25.800 --> 01:27.320
Did I not unmute it?

01:27.320 --> 01:28.320
How did I do that?

01:28.320 --> 01:29.320
Try again, Loki.

01:29.320 --> 01:31.000
I did not unmute me.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.640
Live radio, the joys and tribulations.

01:32.640 --> 01:36.960
Anyways, as I was going to say, is the classic system of the week going to be the Nintendo

01:36.960 --> 01:40.040
serial system?

01:40.040 --> 01:41.040
I don't know.

01:41.040 --> 01:42.040
I don't...

01:42.040 --> 01:46.520
I think I'm safe to say it's not tonight because I may be privy to insider information on what

01:46.520 --> 01:48.160
she's picked in advance.

01:48.200 --> 01:53.760
It is not the Nintendo serial system, but she may pick that in a future month.

01:53.760 --> 01:55.360
It is for breakfast now.

01:55.360 --> 01:56.360
It's a serial.

01:56.360 --> 01:57.360
Wow.

01:57.360 --> 01:58.360
How are you, Loki?

01:58.360 --> 01:59.360
I'm fine.

01:59.360 --> 02:00.360
Yeah?

02:00.360 --> 02:01.360
I have a pizza meeting.

02:01.360 --> 02:02.360
Yeah.

02:02.360 --> 02:03.360
And that's always a good thing.

02:03.360 --> 02:06.080
It's funny because Loki brought in a pizza to the studio tonight and I was saying, oh,

02:06.080 --> 02:09.800
Alan and I were actually thinking about ordering pizza because we're kind of lazy right now

02:09.800 --> 02:10.800
tonight.

02:10.800 --> 02:15.520
And you know, it's that whole situation where you're kind of like out of food.

02:16.520 --> 02:20.920
So you're like, I don't really want to go grocery shopping today, especially when it's

02:20.920 --> 02:21.920
stormy.

02:21.920 --> 02:24.160
Can I get through one more night with just a pizza?

02:24.160 --> 02:25.160
All right.

02:25.160 --> 02:31.440
Us here in studio, but you guys, of course, as always, in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com

02:31.440 --> 02:35.760
where we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern,

02:35.760 --> 02:41.320
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

02:41.320 --> 02:44.920
Like I said, it is stormy outside tonight, a little bit of rainy.

02:44.920 --> 02:48.560
So if you were going to bootleg the show any week, I would encourage you to do it tonight.

02:48.560 --> 02:53.800
In fact, I think Tiger Claw is on standby just in case we have a power outage or something

02:53.800 --> 02:54.800
like that.

02:54.800 --> 02:59.180
However, Flock O' Jones isn't here, so that should be good as far as the power outage

02:59.180 --> 03:00.180
is concerned.

03:00.180 --> 03:01.180
Yes.

03:01.180 --> 03:02.180
All right.

03:02.180 --> 03:03.180
Anyway.

03:03.180 --> 03:07.440
So there are some folks in chat over at live.vognetwork.com that are talking about something I haven't

03:07.440 --> 03:11.680
talked about on the show tonight and I didn't talk about in the show in advance, but so

03:11.680 --> 03:16.280
y'all may have heard on Twitter and throughout the interwebs this week, I got married on

03:16.280 --> 03:17.280
Thursday.

03:17.280 --> 03:18.280
Yep.

03:18.280 --> 03:26.320
Alan and I made it official and we went down and had a good old courthouse wedding on Thursday.

03:26.320 --> 03:30.400
As some people have phrased it, which I guess we have too, we eloped, although that's a

03:30.400 --> 03:31.400
weird...

03:31.400 --> 03:37.560
Usually when you say you elope, you're eloping because maybe like your parents disapprove

03:37.560 --> 03:41.080
or something like that, or you're trying to get away from something, I don't know, I guess

03:41.120 --> 03:45.680
every situation is different, but elope feels weird to me because the only people that we

03:45.680 --> 03:48.820
actually invited to the ceremony were my parents.

03:48.820 --> 03:51.400
And that was because we had to have a witness of some sort.

03:51.400 --> 03:54.440
So I was like, all right, we're going to invite my parents.

03:54.440 --> 03:57.660
Alan's mother passed away many years ago.

03:57.660 --> 04:04.840
So we had them there, but we didn't tell any friends or any other family.

04:04.840 --> 04:05.840
He didn't tell his brothers.

04:05.840 --> 04:07.160
I didn't tell my sister.

04:07.160 --> 04:10.640
We didn't tell really anybody else until it was done.

04:11.360 --> 04:15.240
I think part of that was because, well, I guess if we eloped from anybody, we eloped

04:15.240 --> 04:20.160
from the government because the whole thing was planned.

04:20.160 --> 04:23.280
You guys know I don't like to get too political on this show and I'm just going to just tell

04:23.280 --> 04:25.600
you the facts and how it is.

04:25.600 --> 04:29.680
We made a decision the day after the election that we would get married the day before the

04:29.680 --> 04:36.880
inauguration as it is our belief and wouldn't it be lovely if we get proved wrong, but it

04:36.880 --> 04:42.400
is our belief that there's some in this incoming administration, especially the vice president,

04:42.400 --> 04:49.380
that would try to take this right away of same sex marriage if they're given the choice.

04:49.380 --> 04:55.720
And also you have to consider that Prop 8 was passed in California and Prop 8 technically

04:55.720 --> 04:58.800
is still the law in California, which sucks.

04:58.800 --> 05:06.000
And I think if that were to go again, I feel like having been doing this show, having talked

05:06.000 --> 05:10.960
to many people out there, having seen people in my own life kind of come full circle in

05:10.960 --> 05:14.280
the past eight years, which we kind of saw with our last president, right?

05:14.280 --> 05:20.440
A lot of the reason why Prop 8 passed in the first place, some claim, is because our last

05:20.440 --> 05:24.760
president, President Barack Obama, was on record on a recording saying, I believe marriage

05:24.760 --> 05:26.440
should be between a man and a woman.

05:26.440 --> 05:30.920
Well, in those eight years, he certainly evolved and I think was probably the best champion

05:30.920 --> 05:36.080
of LGBT plus rights that we've ever had in the Oval Office.

05:36.080 --> 05:37.080
So that part's awesome.

05:37.080 --> 05:39.320
And I think a lot of people kind of came around with him.

05:39.320 --> 05:44.600
So I think if Prop 8 were to happen again, it would be very different, which is great.

05:44.600 --> 05:47.000
That type of aggression is awesome.

05:47.000 --> 05:51.160
But the reality is, if the Supreme Court were to strike it down, Prop 8 is still going to

05:51.160 --> 05:52.160
be the law.

05:52.160 --> 05:53.640
So you know what?

05:53.640 --> 05:54.640
So it's one of those things.

05:54.640 --> 05:59.640
And I realize y'all have your own opinions, I'm sure, although the relationship between

05:59.640 --> 06:05.000
Alan and I is not really your concern at the end of the day.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.240
But we said, you know what?

06:06.240 --> 06:07.240
This is what we want to do.

06:07.240 --> 06:08.360
This is a symbolic thing.

06:08.360 --> 06:11.520
We're going to get married and do it here.

06:11.520 --> 06:12.600
And that's it.

06:12.600 --> 06:16.440
And a lot of people have been asking me in the past couple days, does it feel different

06:16.440 --> 06:17.440
now that you're married?

06:17.440 --> 06:21.480
And my honest answer is, not really.

06:21.480 --> 06:23.880
Alan and I have been living together for the past five years anyway.

06:23.880 --> 06:27.560
So maybe there'll be more of those subtle changes later on, especially when we file

06:27.560 --> 06:29.560
our taxes next year and things like that.

06:30.520 --> 06:34.280
The reason why I say it that way, and I can kind of laugh about it, is because honestly,

06:34.280 --> 06:40.040
this was just a logical next step progression in our relationship that we've both known

06:40.040 --> 06:41.880
has been coming for a very long time.

06:41.880 --> 06:45.720
And so it was one of those things where we're just going to do it right now.

06:45.720 --> 06:46.720
So there it is.

06:46.720 --> 06:52.920
So I'm married to Alan, and that happened just days ago.

06:52.920 --> 06:58.180
Loki, let me ask you, because I get this question a lot.

06:58.180 --> 06:59.780
Did marriage change things for you?

06:59.780 --> 07:03.220
Because you and Nellie were together a while before you guys tied the knot, right?

07:03.220 --> 07:05.940
And what has, have things changed for the two of you?

07:05.940 --> 07:09.300
You just can't leave anymore.

07:09.300 --> 07:10.300
I don't know if that's true.

07:10.300 --> 07:12.300
I don't know if that's true.

07:12.300 --> 07:13.300
All right.

07:13.300 --> 07:14.300
Let's see.

07:14.300 --> 07:17.420
Go into our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

07:17.420 --> 07:18.420
Thank you.

07:18.420 --> 07:20.620
I see a lot of people saying congratulations and I really appreciate that.

07:20.620 --> 07:21.620
Thank you guys so much.

07:21.620 --> 07:22.620
Let's see.

07:22.620 --> 07:27.380
JD says, I call mine an elopement, courthouse wedding, no witnesses, et cetera.

07:27.820 --> 07:30.140
We did have a witness and it was a family member.

07:30.140 --> 07:31.140
So I think, I don't know.

07:31.140 --> 07:32.140
I don't know.

07:32.140 --> 07:33.140
Does that still apply?

07:33.140 --> 07:34.140
I don't know.

07:34.140 --> 07:36.340
I think I'm thinking too much about terms where I don't need to be.

07:36.340 --> 07:37.340
Let's see.

07:37.340 --> 07:39.740
SSG100Matt says, it's too bad you didn't do it earlier.

07:39.740 --> 07:43.140
I think you could have gotten a signed letter from Obama congratulating you.

07:43.140 --> 07:46.980
I didn't, I didn't even know that was a thing you could do.

07:46.980 --> 07:49.900
Well, Obama's just a private citizen now.

07:49.900 --> 07:52.900
Do you think if I sent him a letter and asked very nicely, I could still get something?

07:52.900 --> 07:53.900
Maybe?

07:53.900 --> 07:55.060
I don't know.

07:55.060 --> 07:57.580
It's not really, it's not a high priority for us.

07:57.580 --> 07:58.580
It's fine.

07:58.580 --> 07:59.580
Let's see.

07:59.580 --> 08:04.420
And SSG100Matt says, we may all have differences, but we can all agree that we're all happy

08:04.420 --> 08:05.840
for you and Alan.

08:05.840 --> 08:10.180
That's very sweet of you to say, and that's honestly some of the best wishes I could look

08:10.180 --> 08:11.180
for.

08:11.180 --> 08:12.180
Thank you very much.

08:12.180 --> 08:13.380
I really, really appreciate that.

08:13.380 --> 08:14.660
So there you go.

08:14.660 --> 08:19.180
Yes, I know it's a gaming show you guys, but in a three hour show, sometimes you get the

08:19.180 --> 08:23.340
updates on our personal lives and that was a pretty big one for me.

08:23.340 --> 08:24.460
So there you have it.

08:24.460 --> 08:27.580
And you know, Alan, you guys know him because he pops on the show every now and again.

08:27.580 --> 08:28.580
He might pop on tonight.

08:28.580 --> 08:29.580
We'll see.

08:29.580 --> 08:34.480
But, you know, part of the reason why Alan and I click so well is because he's a big

08:34.480 --> 08:38.680
fucking nerd like I am and he plays a lot of video games, although he's more a computer

08:38.680 --> 08:39.680
gamer guy.

08:39.680 --> 08:44.180
I think in the whole times we've lived together, I don't see him pick up a console game very

08:44.180 --> 08:48.700
often at all unless we're doing like Jackbox Party Pack.

08:48.700 --> 08:52.940
Like I think that's the console game I can sometimes, he'll watch me play.

08:52.940 --> 08:57.700
I was playing World of Final Fantasy in the past week and he'll come in, watch me play

08:57.700 --> 08:58.700
the game.

08:58.700 --> 09:01.780
He'll ask a few questions about it and then he'll kind of make fun of it, which World

09:01.780 --> 09:05.060
of Final Fantasy kind of lends itself very well to be made fun of because there's like

09:05.060 --> 09:10.860
so many anime tropes in that game and it's really like over the top ridiculous in some

09:10.860 --> 09:11.860
parts.

09:11.860 --> 09:17.040
So he'll be like, you know, oh, are you playing Chibi Final Fantasy Desu Desu World of Chibi

09:17.040 --> 09:18.040
Fart?

09:18.040 --> 09:21.860
You know, like just make up something on the spot there.

09:21.900 --> 09:24.980
So we bond a lot over games.

09:24.980 --> 09:28.980
Like a game that Alan plays a lot of, in fact he's probably playing it right now if he's

09:28.980 --> 09:32.340
listening to the show in the other room, I know he was playing it before the show, is

09:32.340 --> 09:33.340
Overwatch.

09:33.340 --> 09:39.700
He plays like, he's level, he just hit I think level 231 or something like that on PC.

09:39.700 --> 09:42.020
And that's a lot of Overwatch time, right?

09:42.020 --> 09:43.820
And I like Overwatch.

09:43.820 --> 09:47.660
I do think Overwatch was like the best video game that was released last year in a lot

09:47.660 --> 09:54.260
of ways, but like I probably wouldn't play Overwatch as much as I do if Alan didn't kind

09:54.260 --> 09:56.140
of like motivate me to do that.

09:56.140 --> 09:58.940
So it's like something we kind of do together.

09:58.940 --> 10:02.940
And as much as it can be frustrating sometimes that we'll get matched with really good players

10:02.940 --> 10:07.580
because of his skill rating as opposed to mine, like I do feel like I've learned a lot

10:07.580 --> 10:11.500
more about the game and I have gotten better playing games with him.

10:11.500 --> 10:13.340
So there's that.

10:13.340 --> 10:14.340
All right.

10:14.340 --> 10:18.700
I'll stop being sweet and over the top and all that stuff.

10:18.700 --> 10:22.700
SCO and Hunter Matt in chat wants to offer different congratulations here.

10:22.700 --> 10:25.100
SCO and Hunter Matt says, congrats Bobby.

10:25.100 --> 10:27.380
His team is going to the Superb Owl.

10:27.380 --> 10:29.100
That's right.

10:29.100 --> 10:30.100
That is absolutely right.

10:30.100 --> 10:35.260
Bobby did not do a live show tonight because you guys all know he does, he has this other

10:35.260 --> 10:40.380
gig that he does that involves a football team in his area and said football team is

10:40.380 --> 10:41.820
now going to be going to the Super Bowl.

10:41.820 --> 10:45.620
So I actually, I have to check my Facebook because I actually asked him, does this mean

10:45.620 --> 10:48.240
you get to play at the Lady Gaga concert in two weeks?

10:48.240 --> 10:52.140
I don't, cause I don't know if they get to go to the Super Bowl or any of that stuff.

10:52.140 --> 10:53.140
So we'll see.

10:53.140 --> 10:54.140
We will find out.

10:54.140 --> 10:57.380
I'm sure he will update you all on his show next week.

10:57.380 --> 10:58.380
Let's see.

10:58.380 --> 11:02.620
SCO and Hunter Matt says, I saw you bought Overwatch on console recently, Rob.

11:02.620 --> 11:04.500
Yes, that is true.

11:04.500 --> 11:05.820
It wasn't actually that recent though.

11:05.820 --> 11:10.140
I bought it during a sale, I think Black Friday or something like that.

11:10.180 --> 11:13.900
Vidpower says, wow, that's two Overwatch prestigious.

11:13.900 --> 11:14.900
Yep.

11:14.900 --> 11:18.540
He plays a lot of Overwatch.

11:18.540 --> 11:21.540
ActDeaf says, drunk BlackWolf to call OLR.

11:21.540 --> 11:25.900
Maybe, I'm sure he's in a very celebratory mood, but I don't think BlackWolf will be

11:25.900 --> 11:26.900
calling tonight.

11:26.900 --> 11:29.240
He's probably really tired from the day.

11:29.240 --> 11:30.700
But you know who is calling in tonight?

11:30.700 --> 11:32.460
We have an interview coming up in about 15 minutes.

11:32.460 --> 11:37.200
We're going to be talking with a buddy of mine that's done, he's done a lot of great

11:37.200 --> 11:38.200
like articles.

11:38.800 --> 11:43.000
It's a neat tie-in tonight, and when he was willing to come on the show tonight, knowing

11:43.000 --> 11:47.080
in the back of my mind that, oh, I'm going to announce a gay wedding on air this week,

11:47.080 --> 11:50.560
I thought, oh, this is going to be the perfect guest for the show this week.

11:50.560 --> 11:54.160
It's my pal Matt, Loki, aren't you excited?

11:54.160 --> 11:59.240
It's my pal Matt, Matt Baum is going to be on the show, and he hosts several podcasts.

11:59.240 --> 12:06.320
He did a lot of writing and YouTubes especially and articles about the marriage debate and

12:06.320 --> 12:09.320
all that when that was going on leading up to the Supreme Court ruling, and he still

12:09.320 --> 12:12.840
does a lot of that stuff, you know, just with those types of issues and what's going on

12:12.840 --> 12:15.000
in the LGBT plus community.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.940
But namely on tonight's show, we're going to talk to him about a project that he's doing

12:18.940 --> 12:24.560
that has a lot to do with video games, and I really like issues like this are really

12:24.560 --> 12:28.700
near and dear to my heart because I see myself in a lot of this, but the project he's going

12:28.700 --> 12:35.300
to talk to us about tonight is called Playing with Pride, and it's about LGBT plus gamers

12:35.300 --> 12:39.500
and a lot of what that community goes through.

12:39.500 --> 12:45.520
And you know, a lot of times, when you see an article or a tweet or something from something

12:45.520 --> 12:52.580
about like gamer X, usually one of the responses in there is, why do we need a gay convention?

12:52.580 --> 12:55.100
When do we get a straight gaming convention?

12:55.100 --> 12:56.100
Where's that?

12:56.100 --> 12:57.900
You know, where's my straight pride parade and all that stuff?

12:57.900 --> 13:02.780
And I think the cool thing about this project is that I think Matt's really trying to show

13:02.780 --> 13:05.900
like, why, and answer that question.

13:05.900 --> 13:08.500
So even though you might be sitting there thinking, well, I'm not gay, am I going to

13:08.500 --> 13:10.380
be interested in this?

13:10.380 --> 13:13.940
I think this is a really good chance for you to see something from the other side.

13:13.940 --> 13:18.320
So anyway, I will stop talking about it and let Matt elaborate on that in about 15 minutes

13:18.320 --> 13:19.780
when he joins us live.

13:19.780 --> 13:22.660
But I do want to get into some gaming news right off the top of the show.

13:22.660 --> 13:24.900
I want to talk about the switch.

13:24.900 --> 13:29.860
And obviously, we had a very passionate, lively discussion about some of the things that are

13:29.860 --> 13:33.740
everything that was announced with the switch last week at the initial press conference

13:33.740 --> 13:34.900
and all that.

13:34.900 --> 13:39.660
But in the last seven days, a lot more has come to light, right?

13:39.660 --> 13:43.540
We've seen there's more games that are getting confirmed for the switch, right, especially

13:43.540 --> 13:44.720
the indie department.

13:44.720 --> 13:49.260
We saw what we saw that screenshot with cave story and 1000 to one spikes, right?

13:49.260 --> 13:51.500
We saw, you know that.

13:51.500 --> 13:56.840
But one thing that caught my eye was that it's also come out from some interviews and

13:56.840 --> 14:01.480
some talking that there's not going to be a lot of media software out on the switch.

14:01.480 --> 14:04.800
And that's a very vague way they say not a lot of media software.

14:04.800 --> 14:09.120
Well, does that mean there's going to be like one software or there's just straight up no

14:09.120 --> 14:10.160
software?

14:10.160 --> 14:14.680
And the impression I'm getting is don't expect Netflix on this thing, right?

14:14.680 --> 14:17.840
That yeah, that's incredibly dumb at this time.

14:17.840 --> 14:22.280
You know, and it's, it's interesting reading like the tweets that I'm getting, and I'm

14:22.280 --> 14:26.480
sure our chat room now and I turn around and look, a lot of the tweets that I'm seeing

14:26.480 --> 14:32.240
out there are about like, you know, well, I don't need Netflix on the switch because

14:32.240 --> 14:36.200
I have 500 other devices that all have Netflix on it.

14:36.200 --> 14:37.560
And I get that.

14:37.560 --> 14:43.520
But at the same time, I can't help but go, well, okay, wait, a couple things.

14:43.520 --> 14:47.580
Hey, Nintendo's trying to make this argument that this is a new home console.

14:47.580 --> 14:52.260
And isn't even though I in my heart of hearts believe this system is five times better when

14:52.260 --> 14:55.680
you view it as a new handheld console that just happens to get more powerful when you're

14:55.680 --> 14:58.640
at home, but I digress.

14:58.640 --> 15:05.720
Isn't it kind of standard for home consoles to be living room central hubs that have things

15:05.720 --> 15:07.840
like Netflix in them?

15:07.840 --> 15:12.200
True, but you have to look at it the other way that it's not Nintendo not putting it

15:12.200 --> 15:13.200
on their console.

15:13.200 --> 15:17.360
It's Netflix not developing for that console.

15:17.360 --> 15:20.600
So why aren't they doing it?

15:20.600 --> 15:21.600
That's a good question.

15:21.600 --> 15:26.080
Is it because they feel that, you know, it's obviously powerful enough to run it because,

15:26.080 --> 15:31.540
you know, hell, a stupid tablet can run that.

15:31.540 --> 15:34.440
Could be that they just didn't give the dev kids out to them in time.

15:34.440 --> 15:35.920
It could be like a whole bunch of stuff.

15:35.920 --> 15:43.440
I just think the more I hear about their system, the less like I have a preorder.

15:43.440 --> 15:46.360
I'm probably not going to have a preorder by the time it comes out.

15:46.360 --> 15:48.500
It's still in my possession right now.

15:48.500 --> 15:53.980
But there's not, it's hardly anything convincing me to buy one right now.

15:53.980 --> 15:56.460
Don't cancel it until you're sure, because it'll be hard to get it back once you do.

15:56.460 --> 15:57.460
I don't care, honestly.

15:57.460 --> 15:58.460
I'm just saying.

15:58.460 --> 16:03.680
I mean, there's one game that's coming out, Zelda, which I can get on the Wii U anyways,

16:03.680 --> 16:07.580
which by the way, they talked about what the differences are between the two systems.

16:07.580 --> 16:10.820
It's like not really anything.

16:10.820 --> 16:12.700
I mean, so why?

16:12.700 --> 16:16.740
Going back to Netflix for a minute, here's the thing for me, because even though as much

16:16.740 --> 16:22.180
as I try to look at both sides of everything that's going on in gaming, I try to be fair,

16:22.180 --> 16:26.660
and I think I've given Nintendo a pretty fair shot on this show, and I have not canceled

16:26.660 --> 16:28.260
either of my preorders yet.

16:28.260 --> 16:30.620
Yes, I still have two.

16:30.620 --> 16:36.580
But I do think this whole no Netflix thing is, I don't like it.

16:36.580 --> 16:40.500
And I know a lot of you disagree with me, and that's fine, but it just seems like a

16:40.500 --> 16:42.580
real missed opportunity.

16:42.580 --> 16:47.260
That's what kind of worries me about it, is that it's a real missed opportunity for Nintendo,

16:47.260 --> 16:51.620
especially on a thing like the Switch, where it's like, okay, let's say you're watching

16:51.620 --> 16:56.380
Netflix on the TV or something, and then, oh, somebody wants to come in and take over

16:56.380 --> 17:02.180
the TV for something else, like news or whatever's going on, then snap, you can take that Switch

17:02.180 --> 17:06.700
out and continue to watch yourself on the couch with some headphones.

17:06.700 --> 17:08.580
Didn't they show that for the Wii U?

17:08.580 --> 17:11.700
I could swear when they were plugging the Wii U, they showed that, right?

17:11.820 --> 17:16.820
Yes, it was the whole TV thing where you could, you know, you could take that and, you know,

17:16.820 --> 17:21.020
someone could watch TV on there, and you can watch your whatever.

17:21.020 --> 17:23.660
So that's what's bothering me about it, you guys.

17:23.660 --> 17:26.740
That's what's bothering me about it, is that it feels like it's a feature that was on the

17:26.740 --> 17:30.180
Wii U that's removed on the Switch.

17:30.180 --> 17:31.180
That's where it's weird.

17:31.180 --> 17:38.180
And on top of that, like, YouTube, like, hell, my son uses the Wii U tablet for Minecraft,

17:38.180 --> 17:39.180
and mainly YouTube.

17:39.460 --> 17:43.260
And you've talked about, too, for even yourself, as much as, you know, you give Nintendo shit

17:43.260 --> 17:47.620
on the show sometimes, you love this thing for when your wife wants to commandeer the

17:47.620 --> 17:53.220
TV for Grey's Anatomy, you will use the Wii U gamepad to do stuff, right?

17:53.220 --> 17:58.940
Not so much anymore, now that I have the PlayStation VR, because I'll just play PlayStation 4 games

17:58.940 --> 17:59.940
on that.

17:59.940 --> 18:00.940
Okay, but you have.

18:00.940 --> 18:04.940
But if I had a tablet for the PlayStation, yeah, I'd be down with that, but I mean, at

18:04.940 --> 18:08.700
one time, yeah, I was, when I was playing more, like, Wii U games, and hell, when Zelda

18:08.740 --> 18:14.500
comes out, that might be the case, but yeah, it's nice to be able to do that.

18:14.500 --> 18:19.980
It's just, I don't think, their whole, like, online portion doesn't seem fleshed out at

18:19.980 --> 18:20.980
all.

18:20.980 --> 18:23.740
That's why it's not coming out right away, because it's not ready yet.

18:23.740 --> 18:28.060
There's nothing, they have no details on anything, they don't know how much it's going to cost,

18:28.060 --> 18:31.020
they don't know what features are going to be in it.

18:31.020 --> 18:34.900
That's not good for a console that's coming out in less than six weeks.

18:34.900 --> 18:38.140
You don't have any idea what your online infrastructure is going to be?

18:38.140 --> 18:39.140
Come on!

18:39.140 --> 18:42.740
And I do want to give credit to these comments in chat right now.

18:42.740 --> 18:47.060
ActDeft over at live.vognetwork.com says, Netflix will be on the Switch, just give it

18:47.060 --> 18:48.060
time.

18:48.060 --> 18:51.220
VidPower says, Nintendo said it won't be available on launch, which means it may come

18:51.220 --> 18:52.220
in the future.

18:52.220 --> 18:56.700
And those are both valid and good points, but it still can't help you but feel like,

18:56.700 --> 19:01.520
wow, it feels like what we're getting in March is the beta release, and everything is going

19:01.520 --> 19:05.740
to be building up for holiday, which is when the console is really going to launch.

19:05.740 --> 19:10.380
And for all practical purposes, that may be exactly Nintendo's plan.

19:10.380 --> 19:11.380
And I think it is Nintendo's plan.

19:11.380 --> 19:14.620
I think they're going to get another, it's going to pull another 3DS is what's going

19:14.620 --> 19:15.620
to happen with this system.

19:15.620 --> 19:20.820
They're going to launch it unprepared, it's not going to do great, it'll do fine because

19:20.820 --> 19:24.420
they've sold out of pre-orders, but it's not going to, you know, they're not going to sell

19:24.420 --> 19:28.240
a ton beyond that because there's not a lot of software out there.

19:28.240 --> 19:32.940
And how long, I mean, can Zelda really sustain your console?

19:32.940 --> 19:36.140
I mean, look at all the games coming out for that.

19:36.140 --> 19:39.060
So the other thing is kind of like, I sit back and I'm like, you know, all these games

19:39.060 --> 19:42.860
are coming out for all of these are ports of really old games.

19:42.860 --> 19:47.340
Like Mario Kart 8 is a great game, but once again, it's just being re-released with just

19:47.340 --> 19:53.180
a fraction of a bit extra content that honestly should have been there in the first place.

19:53.180 --> 19:57.140
Here's the thing, the Mario Kart 8 thing where you and I totally differ on this is that I'm

19:57.140 --> 20:01.780
looking ahead to the next nerd convention when everybody brings their Switch and we're

20:01.780 --> 20:07.100
all going to be sitting around playing Mario Kart 8 on our individual TV screens, kind

20:07.100 --> 20:10.780
of doing something in the same room that, like, it's an experience you can't really

20:10.780 --> 20:12.220
get on Wii U right now.

20:12.220 --> 20:13.220
You know what I mean?

20:13.220 --> 20:16.620
Like, that's what I'm really looking forward to in Mario Kart 8, for me personally.

20:16.620 --> 20:19.580
And I think Splatoon is going to be a lot of the same thing as well.

20:19.580 --> 20:24.180
And that could bode very well for other future Nintendo games because obviously Nintendo's

20:24.180 --> 20:25.700
the party system, right?

20:25.700 --> 20:28.860
Mario Party on the Switch is going to be lit.

20:28.860 --> 20:30.020
But that's the problem though.

20:30.020 --> 20:31.020
That's the problem.

20:31.260 --> 20:37.140
That's the party system and that's, I don't party with people with my, you know, Wii or

20:37.140 --> 20:38.140
Wii U or whatever.

20:38.140 --> 20:40.260
Why don't you want to party, Loki?

20:40.260 --> 20:41.860
Come on, Loki, let's party.

20:41.860 --> 20:44.340
That's just making quite the assumption.

20:44.340 --> 20:51.060
But still, even on top of that though, you're basically putting out, like, the game that

20:51.060 --> 20:55.100
was out just recently for that $60 price point still.

20:55.100 --> 20:56.660
And what am I really in with that?

20:56.660 --> 20:58.660
Oh, the additional tracks?

20:58.660 --> 20:59.660
Big deal.

20:59.660 --> 21:03.420
And why don't you just patch that shit into the Wii U version?

21:03.420 --> 21:08.420
Oh, I'm sorry, the Wii U can't handle traditional battle mode in fucking Mario Kart 8?

21:08.420 --> 21:09.660
That's ridiculous.

21:09.660 --> 21:13.740
Only about 10% of our audience, give or take, is going to understand this joke, but I just

21:13.740 --> 21:18.900
think that Nintendo is really on a missed opportunity here to market the Switch as the

21:18.900 --> 21:20.860
official party and play system.

21:20.860 --> 21:23.260
And they're just not doing it.

21:23.260 --> 21:24.260
Well, who knows?

21:24.260 --> 21:25.820
Again, maybe for the holiday.

21:26.420 --> 21:31.740
Maybe the whole thing is, get the early adopters in March so we have some good figures to push

21:31.740 --> 21:37.980
out for our financials so we don't lose further stock faith or whatever, and then really we're

21:37.980 --> 21:41.740
going to push this during the holiday with a bundle with 1-2 Switch because that game

21:41.740 --> 21:43.060
ain't going to sell on its own.

21:43.060 --> 21:46.740
Yeah, I don't think the third party support's there though.

21:46.740 --> 21:48.900
We've been seeing stuff, but what's EA got?

21:48.900 --> 21:50.420
EA's got FIFA.

21:50.420 --> 21:54.780
There's no Madden on there, which is a big deal.

21:54.780 --> 21:55.780
There's no-

21:55.780 --> 21:58.220
But FIFA's there though, which is bigger than Madden.

21:58.220 --> 22:00.700
Yeah, but you know why FIFA's there?

22:00.700 --> 22:05.980
Because not until up to a couple years ago did they still stop- they basically are still

22:05.980 --> 22:15.340
producing the PlayStation 2 and the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 versions of those games because

22:15.340 --> 22:22.140
other parts of the world don't have a lot of market saturation for the newer consoles.

22:22.140 --> 22:23.660
That's not true for Madden.

22:23.660 --> 22:26.300
That's not true for NHL.

22:26.300 --> 22:33.900
That is true still for NBA 2K I believe, but it's just- and even with that though, those

22:33.900 --> 22:39.780
engines are still running on versions of the game that were several years old.

22:39.780 --> 22:43.780
Pro Evo was doing that for a while with Konami, and all they were doing was roster updates,

22:43.780 --> 22:46.380
running on the same engine as late from 2012.

22:46.380 --> 22:55.140
So the thing is, they're providing support for the system, but very shitty-ass support

22:55.140 --> 22:56.140
for it.

22:56.140 --> 22:59.900
And even Ubisoft, what are they really bringing to the system?

22:59.900 --> 23:02.460
Shit that came out already, they're just porting over to it.

23:02.460 --> 23:03.540
Like Rayman?

23:03.540 --> 23:07.140
They're not developing a new Rayman game, it's just a fucking game that came out- what,

23:07.140 --> 23:08.140
the Wii U launch?

23:08.140 --> 23:13.300
I mean, come on, this is piss poor support from third parties.

23:13.300 --> 23:16.900
The ports of years old games is concerning.

23:16.900 --> 23:22.020
I think indies can get away with it a little more than some of the big boys, but you guys

23:22.020 --> 23:27.180
know how I felt about the Skyrim thing, but to be fair, there are others who strongly

23:27.180 --> 23:31.100
feel that Skyrim being a portable presence is going to be a huge asset.

23:31.100 --> 23:35.220
But I want to see how that thing runs, because the thing I'm worried about is, first off,

23:35.220 --> 23:38.460
it's not going to be the new- I don't think it's going to be the remastered Skyrim.

23:38.460 --> 23:43.020
I think it could be just a port of the Xbox 360 PlayStation 3 version.

23:43.020 --> 23:47.980
I mean, which would be okay, I guess, but there's just- at this point, I mean, that

23:47.980 --> 23:53.540
sounds cool, but I even thought about it, like, why would I drop $400 for the system

23:53.540 --> 24:00.140
in the game when I could just upgrade or buy a new laptop that can run Skyrim on the go

24:00.140 --> 24:01.140
anyways?

24:01.140 --> 24:05.780
And that's kind of what I'd be doing, because wherever I go, I bring my laptop, and if I'm

24:05.780 --> 24:10.180
going to be playing games on the Switch, it's going to be at my desk at work, and I could

24:10.180 --> 24:16.220
just easily pop out a laptop and play with an Xbox 360 controller, so why should I drop

24:16.220 --> 24:17.300
it for that?

24:17.300 --> 24:23.300
I mean, the Mario game looks alright, but I didn't buy the Mario game on the Wii U.

24:23.300 --> 24:25.180
Let me go to chat for some more chat comments.

24:25.180 --> 24:30.120
Barb over in chat, my favorite character in Stranger Things, says, everyone single take

24:30.120 --> 24:33.220
a shot every time Rob makes a sex reference.

24:33.220 --> 24:35.420
I hope you all aren't driving anywhere tonight.

24:35.420 --> 24:39.540
Let's see, Dungeon Buster says, the lack of games I'm interested in is concerning.

24:39.580 --> 24:43.820
I have a feeling that after Breath of the Wild, the Switch will just sit there while

24:43.820 --> 24:47.860
Steam and PS4 fill the gaps for, well, everything else.

24:47.860 --> 24:49.820
I disagree-ish.

24:49.820 --> 24:51.220
I kind of get the concern there.

24:51.220 --> 24:55.420
I definitely think Nintendo is trying to do this whole initial launch, and then you will

24:55.420 --> 24:58.220
definitely see something for Holiday and Mario and all that.

24:58.220 --> 25:02.780
But I do feel like, unlike the Wii U, they are trying to do at least something every

25:02.780 --> 25:05.140
month to kind of keep it going.

25:05.140 --> 25:07.180
April is Mario Kart, right?

25:07.180 --> 25:09.020
Arms will probably be May.

25:09.020 --> 25:13.540
Splatoon 2 is going to be June, and I honestly don't know what's beyond that.

25:13.540 --> 25:17.220
Maybe June is E3 and we can get more announcements and so forth, but I do feel like they're trying

25:17.220 --> 25:21.780
to pepper out some of these other releases to kind of sustain the year, if that makes

25:21.780 --> 25:22.780
sense.

25:22.780 --> 25:26.180
This is one little difference I see there than what we saw at Wii U, but this is a different

25:26.180 --> 25:27.220
type of launch, too.

25:27.220 --> 25:29.100
It's going to be launching in March, not November.

25:29.100 --> 25:30.740
Still, that's just like the Wii U.

25:30.740 --> 25:33.220
That's exactly like the Wii U.

25:33.220 --> 25:38.980
Lack of third-party support, one major title coming out from Nintendo every month or so

25:39.980 --> 25:46.060
and that's fine that Nintendo puts out decent games, but is first-party going to be enough

25:46.060 --> 25:48.420
to drive people wanting this system?

25:48.420 --> 25:54.780
And I, you know, I was on board with the Wii, I bought a ton of stuff for it, you know,

25:54.780 --> 25:56.640
I played it for a while and then I didn't.

25:56.640 --> 26:00.540
I didn't play it for a while because, you know, most of the stuff that came out later

26:00.540 --> 26:04.940
on was multi-platform stuff and it's like, well shit, it's just way better on other systems.

26:04.940 --> 26:09.460
The Wii U, you know, I bought a lot of stuff digital because, you know, mainly because

26:09.460 --> 26:10.460
my son wanted to play stuff.

26:10.460 --> 26:16.540
I bought Splatoon, never got into it, so Splatoon 2, I don't give a shit about that.

26:16.540 --> 26:19.460
Mario Maker's pretty fun, but that's not on the new system.

26:19.460 --> 26:20.460
Yet.

26:20.460 --> 26:21.460
Yet.

26:21.460 --> 26:25.020
Well, goodie, I'm not going to wait until 2018 to play a game that I have right now.

26:25.020 --> 26:27.700
Let me get a couple more comments here because I want to make sure we get to our interview.

26:27.700 --> 26:31.780
RPGfan says, I hear you, Loki, I'm a single player, Nintendo doesn't have much for me

26:31.780 --> 26:34.860
beyond Zelda these days.

26:35.780 --> 26:37.780
What about Xenoblade?

26:37.780 --> 26:39.340
I never got into Xenoblade.

26:39.340 --> 26:41.140
I think it's kind of cool.

26:41.140 --> 26:45.040
Let's see, what was the other thing I wanted to say about the whole, I don't remember the

26:45.040 --> 26:47.740
comment that put this out here.

26:47.740 --> 26:51.260
I think maybe it was Darth Tetsuya saying, is Netflix, Hulu really that much of a deal

26:51.260 --> 26:52.260
breaker?

26:52.260 --> 26:56.660
Here's the last thing I want to say on Netflix that's weird to me, okay, is that Netflix

26:56.660 --> 27:00.340
recently introduced this thing where you can actually download movies and watch them on

27:00.340 --> 27:01.340
the go.

27:01.340 --> 27:04.500
I think somebody in chat was saying something about, does anybody watch Netflix on portable

27:04.540 --> 27:05.540
devices?

27:05.540 --> 27:11.780
Yes, when I was flying to and from MAGFest, since DC is a long flight, I was watching

27:11.780 --> 27:13.420
Netflix on my phone.

27:13.420 --> 27:18.060
I downloaded a movie called Hurricane Bianca, which if you all watch Drag Race, you know

27:18.060 --> 27:19.300
what that is.

27:19.300 --> 27:22.980
I downloaded that movie and I was able to actually watch it on the flight.

27:22.980 --> 27:26.580
That's something kind of new for Netflix that the Switch could really benefit from, is that

27:26.580 --> 27:31.340
okay, so obviously this handheld Switch thing doesn't have a cell signal so you're not going

27:31.340 --> 27:38.620
to be able to use Netflix unless you're on Wi-Fi, but you could download movies and then

27:38.620 --> 27:43.020
when you start them, or like you start them on the TV and it's downloading to the Switch,

27:43.020 --> 27:45.860
so that way if you have to pick up the Switch and go somewhere, the rest of the movie is

27:45.860 --> 27:46.860
there.

27:46.860 --> 27:50.660
And yes, I know there's probably a lot of concerns with the whole internal storage,

27:50.660 --> 27:52.140
but those movies are not that big.

27:52.140 --> 27:58.380
I think that whole Hurricane Bianca was like maybe 350 megs, which isn't a lot, and we

27:58.380 --> 28:00.060
know the Switch is expandable, yada yada yada.

28:00.100 --> 28:07.340
And it's only 720p, so I mean it's not like you're downloading a much larger video file.

28:07.340 --> 28:11.620
It's not that like, what I want to say is it's not that it's a deal breaker that Netflix

28:11.620 --> 28:16.380
isn't on the system, it's that this isn't something that they wanted, that they didn't

28:16.380 --> 28:22.240
think of it seemed like, that it's still very much to me where they're like, oh well stay

28:22.240 --> 28:26.500
tuned for more information about our networks, you know, our online system.

28:26.500 --> 28:32.580
It's like, this system comes out next month, you know, it's like what the fuck, or just

28:32.580 --> 28:33.580
a month away.

28:33.580 --> 28:36.940
I mean like, what more time am I gonna give you?

28:36.940 --> 28:40.700
My thought was they're trying to pepper the information the same way they're peppering

28:40.700 --> 28:44.000
the games to keep the Switch in the gaming press.

28:44.000 --> 28:45.200
It's not helping.

28:45.200 --> 28:47.140
It's all negative information that's coming out.

28:47.140 --> 28:48.500
All right, all right.

28:48.500 --> 28:53.100
We gotta move on here because we're gonna be welcoming to the show right now a very

28:53.100 --> 28:54.700
special guest.

28:54.700 --> 28:59.740
And I want to get our pal Matt Baum on the line who's gonna talk to us about a project

28:59.740 --> 29:03.840
that he's working with called Playing with Pride and I think we have him on the line

29:03.840 --> 29:04.840
right now.

29:04.840 --> 29:05.840
Hi Matt, are you there?

29:05.840 --> 29:06.840
Yes, I'm here.

29:06.840 --> 29:07.840
Thanks for having me.

29:07.840 --> 29:08.840
Thanks for being on the show.

29:08.840 --> 29:09.840
Matt, how you doing?

29:09.840 --> 29:10.840
I'm doing great.

29:10.840 --> 29:11.840
How are you guys?

29:11.840 --> 29:12.840
Good.

29:12.840 --> 29:13.840
Did you pre-order a Switch?

29:13.840 --> 29:14.840
Are you a Nintendo fan?

29:14.840 --> 29:15.840
Are you into that?

29:15.840 --> 29:16.840
Yes, yes.

29:16.840 --> 29:19.260
So our household is very Nintendo friendly.

29:19.260 --> 29:23.700
So my partner ordered a Switch like the day of the announcement.

29:23.700 --> 29:26.740
And if you didn't do it the day of the announcement, you're probably not getting one right away.

29:26.740 --> 29:27.740
Yeah, yeah.

29:27.740 --> 29:28.740
So I'm excited.

29:28.740 --> 29:29.740
I'm looking forward to it.

29:29.740 --> 29:35.580
I know there's a lot of debate about the features and the power and the strange amount of storage

29:35.580 --> 29:36.860
space and all that stuff.

29:36.860 --> 29:39.700
But I'm just excited to play Breath of the Wild.

29:39.700 --> 29:42.100
I'm excited for more Mario Kart.

29:42.100 --> 29:46.260
I am curious about taking the device with me.

29:46.260 --> 29:48.260
So yeah, I'm all for it.

29:48.260 --> 29:52.140
I seriously think all this debate on the show, which we've done every week for the past 15

29:52.140 --> 29:56.180
years aside, I kind of think by holiday, everything's going to be fine.

29:56.180 --> 29:57.900
That's kind of where I'm at with it.

29:57.900 --> 29:58.900
But anyway.

29:58.900 --> 30:01.580
I'd like to believe that about everything in the world.

30:01.580 --> 30:02.580
Let's hope.

30:02.580 --> 30:03.580
Let's hope.

30:03.580 --> 30:07.140
So anyway, we could talk about the Switch with you all night, but I want to talk about

30:07.140 --> 30:08.540
this project that you're working on.

30:08.540 --> 30:10.540
It's called Playing with Pride.

30:10.540 --> 30:12.980
Tell us a little bit about this project that you're working on.

30:12.980 --> 30:13.980
Yeah.

30:13.980 --> 30:17.660
So in a nutshell, it's about how people's lives are transformed when gay culture and

30:17.660 --> 30:20.580
game culture collide together.

30:20.580 --> 30:24.620
And so the way it started is we set out to answer that question that you mentioned at

30:24.620 --> 30:30.740
the top of the show about why gay game events or LGBT game events are important to people.

30:30.740 --> 30:33.360
This started a couple of years ago when GamerX was getting going.

30:33.360 --> 30:36.580
That's the game convention with the LGBT focus.

30:36.580 --> 30:42.900
And we heard that conversation online, the questions online, oh, why do we need this?

30:42.900 --> 30:44.100
Why do we have a gay game convention?

30:44.100 --> 30:46.180
What does sexuality have to do with gaming?

30:46.180 --> 30:47.860
So we're like, oh, those are good questions.

30:47.860 --> 30:48.860
Let's find out.

30:49.220 --> 30:53.220
We did a big road trip around the country and we interviewed people in their homes about

30:53.220 --> 30:56.100
why they were going to GamerX.

30:56.100 --> 31:01.200
And what we started to hear were really intense personal stories about how games help people

31:01.200 --> 31:06.540
come out or meet their partners or find their tribe, reconcile with their family.

31:06.540 --> 31:10.820
And so we're like, oh, there's something really important going on here.

31:10.820 --> 31:15.260
And so what the project has turned into, we did these video interviews and we presented

31:15.260 --> 31:17.020
some highlights at various conventions.

31:17.020 --> 31:20.820
We showed them at PAX and GamerX and HavenCon.

31:20.820 --> 31:24.980
We did a live stream that people can see if they go to playingwithpride.com.

31:24.980 --> 31:29.820
You can watch a live stream that we did of some of the highlights where I talk and then

31:29.820 --> 31:34.460
James talks and then we show some footage and go back and forth and we talk to the audience.

31:34.460 --> 31:37.180
You can also sign up for the mailing list there at Playing with Pride for more announcements

31:37.180 --> 31:38.760
about it.

31:38.760 --> 31:42.420
And so now we're trying to figure out because we've got over a hundred interviews.

31:42.420 --> 31:45.660
We've got hundreds of hours of stories.

31:45.660 --> 31:48.880
How exactly do we want to present this to people?

31:48.880 --> 31:52.500
And so that's one other step that we're at right now is just showing people the live

31:52.500 --> 31:56.060
stream that we've got at playingwithpride.com and then there's a little feedback form where

31:56.060 --> 31:59.340
people can say, oh, this is what I like, this is what I don't like, this is what I want

31:59.340 --> 32:00.340
to see more of.

32:00.340 --> 32:04.020
Because we've got people from all different backgrounds and all different walks of life

32:04.020 --> 32:07.060
and all different parts of the country just sharing these stories about how games have

32:07.060 --> 32:09.380
changed their lives.

32:09.380 --> 32:14.300
And just a little bit of a personal testimony on this stuff as well for what I've watched

32:14.300 --> 32:19.160
from the live stream with the interviews, I really wish I could see one of the panels

32:19.160 --> 32:20.160
that you did.

32:20.160 --> 32:21.160
I'd love to see that.

32:21.160 --> 32:23.180
But I did watch the live stream bit that you did.

32:23.180 --> 32:28.460
And just from a personal perspective, I can say being a gay guy who was really into video

32:28.460 --> 32:32.700
games, I definitely felt like you were the outcast of two different camps.

32:32.700 --> 32:38.740
It's like you were not pop culture savvy enough, even though I'm very pop culture savvy, but

32:38.740 --> 32:42.740
you weren't really cool enough or whatever for the gay guys because you were a bit of

32:42.740 --> 32:43.820
a nerd.

32:43.820 --> 32:47.060
And then you were too gay for the nerds at some point.

32:47.060 --> 32:48.980
So you feel like that double outcast.

32:48.980 --> 32:55.300
So just personally to hear these other people that are saying the exact same thing is actually

32:55.300 --> 32:57.740
really comforting for me in a way.

32:57.740 --> 33:00.620
Yeah, it's something that we heard from a lot of people.

33:00.620 --> 33:03.700
That feeling of, well, I don't belong with this tribe and I don't belong with this tribe

33:03.700 --> 33:05.700
and who do I belong with?

33:05.700 --> 33:11.380
And these are actually two groups, LGBTs and gamers are two groups that have a lot in common,

33:11.380 --> 33:13.020
even though they don't always see eye to eye.

33:13.780 --> 33:18.060
I think the folks in both groups have a lot to gain from playing together.

33:18.060 --> 33:19.500
That's a really good point.

33:19.500 --> 33:24.380
I hope a lot of people caught there is that gamers are often on the outs with the rest

33:24.380 --> 33:25.940
of society as well.

33:25.940 --> 33:28.220
And LGBT gets that as well.

33:28.220 --> 33:32.940
And we could probably do more working together than shouting at each other.

33:32.940 --> 33:34.740
Yeah, yeah, I hope so.

33:34.740 --> 33:38.820
Because one of the things that we heard from people, we spoke to a lot of developers.

33:38.820 --> 33:42.180
For example, we talked to people at BioWare about the creation of the character Krem

33:42.180 --> 33:50.780
and the Iron Bull, about what happens when people are working together to make a game

33:50.780 --> 33:52.820
more fun for everyone.

33:52.820 --> 33:55.740
I think Krem is a really good example of that.

33:55.740 --> 34:00.460
We spoke to, it's actually kind of amazing how this happened, because we spoke to this

34:00.460 --> 34:04.460
one person in Vancouver about his experiences with gaming.

34:04.460 --> 34:09.860
And he shared stories about how when he was young, he had a bootleg version of Pokemon.

34:09.860 --> 34:11.580
I can't remember which Pokemon it was.

34:11.580 --> 34:13.860
He had a bootleg version of one of the Pokemons.

34:13.860 --> 34:28.740
And the save got corrupted, and the gender of the character that he was playing flipped.

34:28.740 --> 34:32.940
And he realized, oh, this is something that matters to me, and I don't quite know why.

34:32.940 --> 34:36.780
So we talked to him and interviewed him, and we put him in our presentation.

34:36.780 --> 34:40.420
And so when we presented at PAX, he came to the presentation to see it.

34:40.420 --> 34:41.420
His name is Justin Sane.

34:41.420 --> 34:46.940
He's a great cosplayer and drag queen and community leader up in Vancouver.

34:46.940 --> 34:52.060
And something else that we had in the presentation was Karen Weeks from BioWare talking about

34:52.060 --> 34:57.140
the character Krem, about how that character came about, because at a feedback event that

34:57.140 --> 35:00.460
BioWare had, they were asking people for their thoughts on the games.

35:00.460 --> 35:04.460
And somebody came up and said about trans characters, I just want to see somebody in

35:04.460 --> 35:07.900
the game who looks like me and isn't a monster.

35:07.900 --> 35:10.940
And she said, well, after that, we all sat down together and we were like, we can do

35:10.940 --> 35:11.940
this.

35:11.940 --> 35:13.460
We can actually make this happen.

35:13.460 --> 35:17.220
And so Justin Sane happened to be at this presentation, and afterwards he came up and

35:17.220 --> 35:22.700
he was like, I think that person who said that was me.

35:22.700 --> 35:26.260
I think I was the one who asked for a trans character.

35:26.260 --> 35:29.020
And as it turns out, it was true.

35:29.020 --> 35:34.200
And we went back and got Karen and a bunch of other BioWare folks together with Justin.

35:34.200 --> 35:39.300
We sat them all down to talk about how he came to this event, wanted to see better trans

35:39.300 --> 35:42.540
representation, more gender fluid representation in games.

35:42.540 --> 35:46.580
They realized, oh, we can put people in games that we haven't, we've underserved in the

35:46.580 --> 35:47.580
past.

35:47.580 --> 35:51.220
And it was a great example of this virtuous cycle that happens when queer people find

35:51.220 --> 35:53.820
their voice, find their community, and speak out.

35:53.820 --> 35:57.420
Game developers can hear them, and it changes the way that they make games.

35:57.420 --> 36:01.300
They make the games more inclusive so more people can enjoy them, and in turn that has

36:01.300 --> 36:05.700
a positive effect on communities, and communities see that they're welcome in gaming, and everybody

36:05.700 --> 36:07.140
can have a better time.

36:07.140 --> 36:12.780
That's an outstanding story to hear, kind of like that direct influence with game makers.

36:12.780 --> 36:17.340
But now you keep saying we, this project is not just you, your partner is involved, right?

36:17.340 --> 36:20.060
Your partner actually worked in the game industry for a while, right?

36:20.060 --> 36:21.060
Yeah, that's true.

36:21.060 --> 36:23.920
James is a veteran of the game industry.

36:23.920 --> 36:25.180
We are collaborating on this.

36:25.180 --> 36:26.180
So he worked at LucasArts.

36:26.180 --> 36:27.180
He worked at Capcom.

36:27.180 --> 36:29.380
He worked at LeapFrog and some other places.

36:29.380 --> 36:31.560
And so we're working together on this project.

36:31.560 --> 36:37.300
He has just an encyclopedic knowledge of games, and I've absorbed as much as I can from him

36:37.300 --> 36:40.820
through osmosis, and he's got this great knack for putting a game in front of me and saying,

36:40.820 --> 36:43.740
I think you'll like this, and he's always right.

36:43.740 --> 36:48.500
So it's thanks to him, because I was kind of a gamer as a kid, and then it kind of fell

36:48.500 --> 36:50.900
away in high school and college.

36:50.900 --> 36:58.520
And then once James and I started dating, oh gosh, many years ago, he brought me back

36:58.520 --> 36:59.520
into the fold, essentially.

36:59.520 --> 37:03.820
He was like, you'll like this game, and you should give this one a shot.

37:03.820 --> 37:04.820
So it's been great.

37:04.820 --> 37:12.140
I really enjoyed working with my partner as a partner, in all senses of the word.

37:12.140 --> 37:13.140
That's a great story.

37:13.140 --> 37:14.140
I love that.

37:14.140 --> 37:17.260
And you guys didn't like, you didn't kickstart this or anything like that.

37:17.260 --> 37:22.700
You guys took this trip you wanted to do and kind of turned it into this project, right?

37:22.700 --> 37:23.700
Exactly.

37:23.700 --> 37:24.700
Yeah.

37:24.700 --> 37:25.700
There may be a kickstart in the future.

37:25.700 --> 37:26.700
We haven't decided yet.

37:26.700 --> 37:30.420
We haven't had a need for it yet, but we may in the future.

37:30.420 --> 37:31.420
We'll see.

37:31.420 --> 37:33.980
That's something that we're asking people for feedback on, like how they want to see

37:33.980 --> 37:36.120
this project progress.

37:36.120 --> 37:39.340
So based on their feedback, we'll decide what form it's going to take.

37:39.340 --> 37:45.440
Well, the reality is, just to say the reality is if people want a movie, those cost money

37:45.440 --> 37:50.360
to put on Blu-ray, so there's probably going to be a need for money there, for sure.

37:50.360 --> 37:51.360
Yes.

37:51.360 --> 37:52.360
Yes.

37:52.360 --> 37:53.360
So we've done all the traveling.

37:53.360 --> 37:55.080
So far we've done out of pocket.

37:55.080 --> 37:57.820
And it's, you know, had a blast driving around the country.

37:57.820 --> 38:01.880
We drove from L.A. up to Vancouver and then across the country, top of the country to

38:01.880 --> 38:05.200
Chicago and New York and into Maine, then back through Denver.

38:05.200 --> 38:11.880
We made a pit stop in Austin for HavenCon.

38:11.880 --> 38:17.220
And I'm going to be in Orlando later this, in March, and so I'm hoping to do some interviews

38:17.220 --> 38:18.220
in Orlando.

38:18.220 --> 38:22.800
And we're also looking at Europe to talk to some people in Europe at some point in 2017.

38:22.800 --> 38:24.520
So that's going to be a bit more of an expense.

38:24.520 --> 38:26.800
So we're figuring that out now.

38:26.800 --> 38:30.240
Although you have interviewed some people from overseas in this, right?

38:30.240 --> 38:34.460
Because didn't I spot Laura, I'm going to mess up her name, but the Eurogamer writer

38:34.460 --> 38:36.480
Laura Kate Dale is in this, right?

38:36.480 --> 38:39.260
Yeah, from Let's Play Video Games.

38:39.260 --> 38:44.260
We were lucky enough to catch her at GamerX in San Jose, or maybe it was Santa Clara,

38:44.260 --> 38:45.740
but in California.

38:45.740 --> 38:49.740
So we caught her there and we talked to Jim Sterling who, well, he lives in Mississippi,

38:49.740 --> 38:52.940
but originally from the UK.

38:52.940 --> 38:57.060
So yeah, we have spoken to a couple people internationally, but we want to get more people

38:57.060 --> 39:01.660
particularly from the South, particularly from rural areas, and particularly from countries

39:01.660 --> 39:07.620
that want it to just be the U.S. experience because we'll play games everywhere.

39:07.620 --> 39:08.700
Well Jamie's going to be bummed.

39:08.700 --> 39:09.700
She missed tonight's show.

39:09.700 --> 39:10.700
She's from the South.

39:10.700 --> 39:11.700
Maybe she's out there listening.

39:11.700 --> 39:16.380
Anyway, how has the response been at some of these conventions that you've taken this

39:16.380 --> 39:17.380
to?

39:17.380 --> 39:21.080
Because you mentioned you have shown this at, or your work in progress, I should say,

39:21.080 --> 39:22.080
at GamerX.

39:22.080 --> 39:23.780
You've taken it to PAX.

39:23.780 --> 39:25.880
How has the response been?

39:25.880 --> 39:26.980
Really strong.

39:26.980 --> 39:28.900
We've had a great reaction from folks.

39:28.900 --> 39:30.620
People are really interested.

39:30.620 --> 39:34.220
One of the things that we're hearing a lot is, how can I see more?

39:34.660 --> 39:41.020
We literally have 100 and something hours of people just telling stories.

39:41.020 --> 39:46.140
We've got people talking about, for example, one of my favorite stories is these two guys

39:46.140 --> 39:50.820
in D.C. that throw house parties, these gamer house parties where they just throw open the

39:50.820 --> 39:56.660
doors and bring people in, so they've got zones of like, oh, the DDR is up there and

39:56.660 --> 40:01.460
Settlers of Catan is down in the basement and we've got Mass Effect going over here

40:01.460 --> 40:05.740
and we've got Puerto Rico going over here.

40:05.740 --> 40:12.180
These great games about people building up community and forming essentially chosen families,

40:12.180 --> 40:16.340
which is something that I think is familiar to a lot of queer people.

40:16.340 --> 40:22.620
Can I just say that the house party and doing the gaming at the house party, that is actually

40:22.620 --> 40:28.620
how about, gosh, it probably would have been 13 years ago or so, that is how I met Captain

40:28.660 --> 40:34.260
Spike from GameBooey.org and started a lifelong friendship and obviously they're on the network

40:34.260 --> 40:39.700
here as well at VoG and just, you all know Spike and his immense knowledge of video games

40:39.700 --> 40:40.700
and all that stuff.

40:40.700 --> 40:46.020
We met and connected and started a friendship because of one of those types of house parties.

40:46.020 --> 40:47.500
It's such a big deal.

40:47.500 --> 40:51.860
Those gamer get-togethers and the forming of community, it's so important to people,

40:51.860 --> 40:54.260
whether it's in real life or online.

40:54.260 --> 40:59.180
We talked to a woman in Las Vegas who, she's a mom, she's raising a kid and her son came

40:59.180 --> 41:03.180
to her, I think he was early teens, and was like, oh, I want to play World of Warcraft

41:03.180 --> 41:06.980
and she was monitoring his games at the time and she's like, I don't really know what that

41:06.980 --> 41:09.480
is so I should check it out, make sure it's appropriate.

41:09.480 --> 41:13.940
She downloads a free trial and then within a couple of months, the whole family, they

41:13.940 --> 41:19.820
all have gaming laptops and they are going on raids together as a family and she joined

41:19.820 --> 41:24.640
an LGBT-friendly guild, the Spectrum Guild, and it turned into this big family for her

41:24.640 --> 41:29.340
where now everywhere she can go all over the country and visit people from the guild.

41:29.340 --> 41:33.860
It's so important, those communities that form, because for a lot of folks, they do

41:33.860 --> 41:41.060
feel that they don't belong, that there's something that sets them apart and games have

41:41.060 --> 41:46.020
a really great way, nothing does this like games of bringing people together.

41:46.020 --> 41:51.540
It's interesting you bring up MMOs and especially Warcraft and I noticed when I was watching

41:51.540 --> 41:57.080
the footage that you had at playingwithpride.com that Warcraft was a theme that kept coming

41:57.080 --> 42:00.980
up and even for me, that's been a thing because I just mentioned at the top of the show, Alan

42:00.980 --> 42:13.940
and I got married after seven years together, but when we were first together, I lived here

42:13.940 --> 42:16.780
in Sacramento, which is a good 100 miles apart.

42:16.780 --> 42:19.820
We couldn't just drive up on a weeknight and see each other.

42:19.820 --> 42:24.020
One of the ways that we would hang out, I'm using my quotey fingers, was through something

42:24.020 --> 42:25.020
like Warcraft.

42:25.020 --> 42:31.940
Warcraft allowed us to be together even though we weren't, that makes sense.

42:31.940 --> 42:32.940
That's something that we've heard.

42:32.940 --> 42:37.500
Warcraft has come up again and again and again.

42:37.500 --> 42:41.180
It's tough because we don't want to make it like Warcraft the documentary, but it kind

42:41.180 --> 42:44.540
of works out, it's like Warcraft and Bioware.

42:44.540 --> 42:48.900
We talked to this one person in, where was it?

42:48.900 --> 42:51.500
Just outside San Francisco, who was in the army.

42:51.500 --> 42:54.800
He was in the army and closeted and there was no one he could tell because it was during

42:54.800 --> 43:00.220
Don't Ask, Don't Tell and he was introduced to Warcraft as a way to just kind of get some

43:00.220 --> 43:05.580
alone time from everyone he was stationed with and he realized he was playing as female

43:05.580 --> 43:09.480
characters and it was something they wanted to explore more of and then he started coming

43:09.480 --> 43:14.440
out to Don't Ask, Don't Tell went away.

43:14.440 --> 43:19.480
He was comfortable coming out to his friends and he went into the army because he was like,

43:19.480 --> 43:21.840
I need to be more masculine, I need to be more manly.

43:21.840 --> 43:25.640
And Warcraft gave him permission to play as female characters and dress up and be girly

43:25.640 --> 43:31.960
and now the latest thing that he's done, we interviewed him just after the holidays, he

43:31.960 --> 43:36.800
went to his army, I think it was his battalion or just the group of people he serves with,

43:36.800 --> 43:41.240
he went to the holiday party in drag, in this big princess dress and it was a huge

43:41.240 --> 43:42.240
hit.

43:42.240 --> 43:44.240
Everybody loved it.

43:44.240 --> 43:51.040
It's amazing because Warcraft made him comfortable exploring his more feminine side and not feeling

43:51.040 --> 43:54.560
this pressure that he'd been putting on himself the whole time, oh I got to be more of a man,

43:54.560 --> 43:56.080
I got to be more stereotypically manly.

43:56.080 --> 43:59.200
No, you don't, you don't and games are a great way to experiment with that.

43:59.200 --> 44:04.440
If you guys have questions, of course for Matt, our chat room is open over at live.vognetwork.com.

44:04.440 --> 44:07.480
Y'all are being quiet in there right now, but I'm assuming you're just listening intently.

44:07.480 --> 44:11.800
But if you do have questions, you can ask those over at live.vognetwork.com, I'll try

44:11.800 --> 44:14.320
to fit a few in here before we have to let Matt go.

44:14.320 --> 44:19.360
But just kind of piggybacking on the Warcraft thing, I mean that's a cool story, but I was

44:19.360 --> 44:24.560
also, like for me personally, something that kind of caught my attention was you had a

44:24.560 --> 44:30.560
trans individual who was talking about Warcraft and that this, you know, and I don't happen

44:30.560 --> 44:35.360
to be trans myself, so this is something I never thought of, right?

44:35.360 --> 44:42.800
Is that this was a trans person who was playing a female character and was able to kind of

44:42.800 --> 44:50.120
explore femininity, feminine, I can't even say this word, the feminine side through World

44:50.120 --> 44:51.120
of Warcraft.

44:51.120 --> 44:54.840
And, you know, it's interesting because I even know in the past I've made these jokes

44:54.840 --> 44:58.720
and I've probably cracked them on air about how, oh, you know everybody that's playing

44:58.720 --> 45:03.080
a woman in World of Warcraft is just some perv dude sitting there, right?

45:03.080 --> 45:04.080
You know?

45:04.080 --> 45:05.080
And those types of things.

45:05.080 --> 45:08.680
And hearing a story like that definitely stopped and made me think, huh, there's definitely

45:08.680 --> 45:14.200
a lot more to this than these stereotypes, I suppose, that are out there.

45:14.200 --> 45:16.320
Yeah, yeah.

45:16.320 --> 45:17.320
It's really true.

45:17.320 --> 45:24.760
The one person that we spoke to, Jude in Bakersfield, told us a story about how when he was presenting

45:24.760 --> 45:30.240
as female he got more sexual harassment in the game than he did after he transitioned

45:30.240 --> 45:32.920
and was openly trans when he played.

45:32.920 --> 45:36.640
He got harassed more as a woman than he did as a trans person.

45:36.640 --> 45:41.960
We also heard from Laura Dale about how she was harassed for, you know, the people she

45:41.960 --> 45:46.520
was playing with felt that she was being inconsistent with her gender and withholding something

45:46.520 --> 45:51.120
when in reality she was just trying to figure herself out at the time.

45:51.120 --> 45:58.960
So yeah, it's been tough for a lot of people because for sure it is possible for LGBT people

45:58.960 --> 46:02.240
to feel very unwelcome in games, especially when you don't see yourself.

46:02.240 --> 46:04.960
To feel like, oh, I guess maybe I'm not a gamer.

46:04.960 --> 46:07.360
Maybe games aren't for me.

46:07.360 --> 46:14.040
And so that's one reason why seeing yourself in games and why queer game events matter

46:14.040 --> 46:15.040
to people.

46:15.040 --> 46:19.280
To see yourself reflected there and to see other people like you affirms, yeah, yeah,

46:19.280 --> 46:20.280
you exist.

46:20.280 --> 46:25.460
You're a person and you belong here and we are eager to play with you.

46:25.460 --> 46:29.360
And fifth dream in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com kind of piggybacking on this story a little

46:29.360 --> 46:31.920
bit saying, I'm kind of like that with MMOs.

46:31.920 --> 46:36.100
I've always felt pressured to be more manly, but I always play girls in games.

46:36.100 --> 46:39.600
And since I've been playing Final Fantasy 14, and maybe it's a coincidence, but I've

46:39.600 --> 46:43.920
kind of said, fuck it and dress more how I want and stop trying to be so much of a dude

46:43.920 --> 46:44.920
dude.

46:44.920 --> 46:47.160
But then again, I'm goth, so androgyny is easier.

46:47.160 --> 46:48.860
Yeah, that's great.

46:48.860 --> 46:56.460
So it's not just even necessarily for LGBT only people, it's a very broad spectrum.

46:56.460 --> 47:02.900
And actually, I wanted to ask this question because our audience here at OLR is not exclusively

47:02.900 --> 47:03.900
LGBT.

47:03.900 --> 47:07.140
We have a lot of straight folks that listen to this program.

47:07.140 --> 47:12.500
And we touched on this a little bit in the beginning about like, why might a straight

47:12.500 --> 47:15.520
individual be interested in something like playing with pride?

47:15.520 --> 47:20.000
But what I want to ask was, since you have taken this to expos like PAX, you know, which

47:20.000 --> 47:25.120
is definitely not I mean, there's, you know, a lot of straight guys that go to PAX, like,

47:25.120 --> 47:29.880
have you had a response from the non LGBT community?

47:29.880 --> 47:31.240
What kind of response have you gotten?

47:31.240 --> 47:32.240
Like, have you?

47:32.240 --> 47:35.280
Have you heard that this project has worked in enlightening folks or what?

47:35.280 --> 47:38.720
Yeah, well, so our goal isn't exactly to enlighten folks.

47:38.720 --> 47:43.080
But what we've heard is that from from straight people in particular, one of the questions

47:43.080 --> 47:49.080
that we get a lot is just how can I make my gaming environments more welcoming?

47:49.080 --> 47:53.280
What can I do to ensure that people are having a good time?

47:53.280 --> 48:00.200
And you know, my advice there is to listen, to ask people, you know, just to check in.

48:00.200 --> 48:01.200
Are you having a good time?

48:01.200 --> 48:02.320
Are you feeling okay?

48:02.320 --> 48:03.640
Is everything comfortable?

48:03.640 --> 48:06.900
And if there's a problem, if anyone's making you feel uncomfortable, if there's anything

48:06.900 --> 48:08.440
that's missing, well, what can we do to change that?

48:08.440 --> 48:11.800
What can we do to make sure everybody's having a good time?

48:11.800 --> 48:15.020
Never underestimate the power of just asking and listening.

48:15.020 --> 48:19.560
So that's that's been some of the response that we've heard from people who don't consider

48:19.560 --> 48:24.200
themselves part of the LGBT community, but want to be good allies.

48:24.200 --> 48:29.880
You know, the two things we hear are, why is this necessary?

48:29.880 --> 48:35.400
And I think, to be perfectly honest, you know, this meaning LGBT game spaces or LGBT game

48:35.400 --> 48:36.400
events.

48:36.400 --> 48:38.760
And to be honest, I don't think they're necessary.

48:38.760 --> 48:43.200
I mean, nobody needs a game convention of any kind.

48:43.200 --> 48:44.600
We don't need it, but we like it.

48:44.600 --> 48:45.600
It's important to us.

48:45.600 --> 48:46.600
It matters to us.

48:46.600 --> 48:51.840
You know, we're not going to die if they don't happen, but they really do change our lives.

48:51.840 --> 48:56.440
And so what we found is, you know, at that collision of gay culture and game culture,

48:56.440 --> 49:02.080
it reveals that playing together really helps us understand each other.

49:02.080 --> 49:05.120
And that's really what it's about, that we come together, we have a good time, we make

49:05.120 --> 49:13.720
friends, and we understand people that we might never have considered friends before.

49:13.720 --> 49:18.260
I want to make sure, of course, I want to make sure we amply plug the playingwithpride.com

49:18.260 --> 49:22.380
website so folks can check out this live stream for themselves and give you that feedback

49:22.380 --> 49:25.360
that you are seeking about what happens next.

49:25.360 --> 49:27.520
Is this a documentary or is this a video podcast?

49:27.520 --> 49:31.280
But I also want to make sure we talk about your other projects, because you don't just

49:31.280 --> 49:34.040
work with this playingwithpride.com.

49:34.040 --> 49:38.520
You host a couple of podcasts yourself, right?

49:38.520 --> 49:39.520
That's correct.

49:39.520 --> 49:40.640
So I have a couple.

49:40.640 --> 49:45.560
One is The Sewers of Paris, and that's at thesewersofparis.com or wherever you get your

49:45.560 --> 49:46.560
podcasts.

49:46.560 --> 49:50.180
And on that show, I talk to different gay men every week about entertainment that's

49:50.180 --> 49:52.800
changed the lives of gay men.

49:52.800 --> 49:59.240
So you know, people share stories about how Madonna or Oscar Wilde or John Waters or whatever

49:59.240 --> 50:04.520
it is, those pieces of culture that have made a difference to them and have transformed

50:04.520 --> 50:05.520
things for them.

50:05.520 --> 50:11.920
I have an amazing story on one episode from this guy who watched some real cheesy 80s

50:11.920 --> 50:12.920
films.

50:12.920 --> 50:17.480
He was growing up in Russia and watched some really cheesy 80s films in the 80s.

50:17.480 --> 50:22.040
They were broadcast on this pirate TV station where you had to wake up at 2 a.m. and tune

50:22.040 --> 50:23.620
the TV to a certain channel.

50:23.620 --> 50:28.620
And then you'd be able to watch Curly Sue got married, Curly Sue got married.

50:28.620 --> 50:32.980
Just silly things, trading places.

50:32.980 --> 50:36.260
But that formed this, for him and his mom who were just living together, it was the

50:36.260 --> 50:41.860
two of them, it formed this vision of the U.S. for them of like, oh, the United States

50:41.860 --> 50:46.400
is a lot better than this world we're growing up in, let's get out of this country.

50:46.400 --> 50:52.340
So his mother became a mail-order bride so that they could get out of the U.S. and move

50:52.340 --> 50:56.260
to a place where he could, it wasn't safe for him to be a gay kid in Russia, so they

50:56.260 --> 51:00.980
moved to Seattle where he could be openly gay in a place that was a little bit safer.

51:00.980 --> 51:06.700
And so he's just got this amazing story about how these visions of the U.S. via weird 80s

51:06.700 --> 51:10.460
movies on a pirate TV station essentially saved his life.

51:10.460 --> 51:14.580
So we've got lots of stories about that, about culture that has changed the lives of gay

51:14.580 --> 51:15.580
men.

51:15.580 --> 51:16.580
That's at sewersofparis.com.

51:16.580 --> 51:19.420
I feel so cliche.

51:19.420 --> 51:22.880
When I hear an amazing story like that, I feel so cliche because for me it was the Rocky

51:22.880 --> 51:23.880
Horror Picture Show.

51:23.880 --> 51:29.220
So you know, there's a ton of people like that, right?

51:29.220 --> 51:31.380
Rocky Horror has been huge for our community.

51:31.380 --> 51:32.620
But anyway, I digress.

51:32.620 --> 51:33.620
Yeah.

51:33.620 --> 51:37.520
Well, I mean, it has and everybody has a different Rocky experience.

51:37.520 --> 51:44.580
You know, for me it was watching it with the high school drama club and realizing, essentially

51:44.580 --> 51:49.300
getting permission from the movie to like other boys and to be weird about gender.

51:49.300 --> 51:56.980
Because you know, I was growing up in a fairly un-gay suburb of Connecticut in the 90s.

51:56.980 --> 52:01.540
And Rocky Horror kind of opened that up to that song at the end, Don't Dream It, Be It.

52:01.540 --> 52:02.540
Yeah, for sure.

52:02.540 --> 52:04.500
And it says, go be what you want to be.

52:04.500 --> 52:09.620
And that's why Tim Curry is like a legend and always will be for me.

52:09.620 --> 52:13.260
Not to make this all about me, but it is part of the reason I'm still like, I'm pushing

52:13.260 --> 52:15.300
40 years old and I'm still involved with Rocky Horror.

52:15.300 --> 52:20.280
In fact, I'm hosting Rocky Horror here in Sacramento on February 11th, plug, plug.

52:20.280 --> 52:26.820
But part of the reason I still stay involved to this day is so that that exists for me,

52:26.820 --> 52:28.820
who's 18 now.

52:28.820 --> 52:34.660
Yeah, the kids today growing up.

52:34.660 --> 52:41.020
I actually did a Rocky episode last year around Halloween from this guy who was actually homeless

52:41.020 --> 52:44.800
living in LA, just squatting in different places.

52:44.800 --> 52:48.540
And the community that sprang up, and this is when it was first run in the late 70s,

52:48.540 --> 52:53.140
the community that sprung up around the Rocky Horror Picture Show, for him, that was his

52:53.140 --> 52:54.140
community.

52:54.140 --> 52:55.140
Like those were his people.

52:55.140 --> 52:57.660
That literally saved his life and gave him people to connect with when he had nobody

52:57.660 --> 52:59.980
and nowhere to go.

52:59.980 --> 53:02.820
So that's all on SursaParis.com.

53:02.820 --> 53:05.660
My other podcast is Defining Marriage, and that's a little more casual.

53:05.660 --> 53:11.580
It's where my partner James and I talk about the week's LGBT news, but we're very casual

53:11.580 --> 53:13.380
and jokey and chatty about it.

53:13.380 --> 53:18.580
So half the show is about, you know, like this week we're talking about why Taiwan might

53:18.580 --> 53:23.100
become the first country in Asia to legalize marriage equality and we talked about why

53:23.100 --> 53:24.100
that is.

53:24.100 --> 53:27.540
We talked about some of the silly stuff that's happening in Australia around marriage and

53:27.540 --> 53:33.540
also there's this debate going on, very tiresome debate in Taiwan about like, well, if we legalize

53:33.540 --> 53:37.260
marriage, couldn't people marry the Ferris wheel?

53:37.260 --> 53:39.580
And so, oh boy, that argument.

53:39.580 --> 53:40.580
So we make fun of that.

53:40.580 --> 53:41.580
Ferris wheels need love too.

53:41.580 --> 53:42.580
Hey, stop it.

53:42.580 --> 53:43.580
Yeah, exactly.

53:43.580 --> 53:44.580
Oh boy.

53:44.580 --> 53:46.980
You can love, you can love a Ferris wheel.

53:46.980 --> 53:51.700
You just don't love a Ferris wheel.

53:51.700 --> 53:54.740
Love is a spectrum of many different colors in my opinion.

53:54.740 --> 53:59.100
And the color that I love Alan with is not the same color that I love a Ferris wheel

53:59.100 --> 54:00.100
with.

54:00.100 --> 54:01.100
Yes.

54:01.100 --> 54:02.100
Yeah, there are differences.

54:02.900 --> 54:07.780
I think that's a funny joke to make on behalf of the other side, but gee whiz, maybe they

54:07.780 --> 54:12.500
can think of some differences between same sex couples and Ferris wheels.

54:12.500 --> 54:15.860
So anyway, so we talk about half about like LGBT stuff and then we always get sidetracked

54:15.860 --> 54:23.140
on what games we're playing and we had, you know, got way down in the weeds on whatever

54:23.140 --> 54:26.100
it is, whether it's anime or we're watching Steven universe.

54:26.100 --> 54:29.220
So we had a lot to say about Steven universe this week.

54:29.220 --> 54:33.220
So it's a lot of, it's a lot of nonsense on top of whatever's happening in the news

54:33.220 --> 54:34.420
this week.

54:34.420 --> 54:37.820
Let me shift back to games a little bit here with a question from our chat room.

54:37.820 --> 54:41.500
And you know, you've, you have, you know, not just your podcast, but you have a very

54:41.500 --> 54:46.100
rich history with some of the, you know, articles that you've written for various, you know,

54:46.100 --> 54:49.900
GLBT plus publications and so forth.

54:49.900 --> 54:54.460
You know, you, you obviously kind of have finger on the pulse of all this stuff.

54:54.460 --> 55:00.280
But as a gamer as well, SGA 100 Matt wants to know in our chat room over at live.fognetwork.com,

55:00.280 --> 55:06.380
what are your thoughts on the nonsense online backlash over Tracer being gay, the Overwatch

55:06.380 --> 55:07.380
character?

55:07.380 --> 55:08.380
Oh boy.

55:08.380 --> 55:09.380
Oh boy.

55:09.380 --> 55:11.780
Look, Tracer is a lesbian, end of story.

55:11.780 --> 55:14.280
I mean, like that's very reductive.

55:14.280 --> 55:15.280
Maybe she's bisexual.

55:15.280 --> 55:16.280
Who knows?

55:16.280 --> 55:21.740
But to be fair, the creator tweeted or the character design or something tweeted she's

55:21.740 --> 55:22.740
lesbian.

55:23.020 --> 55:25.500
We do know her identity is lesbian.

55:25.500 --> 55:27.940
Okay, fantastic.

55:27.940 --> 55:29.220
I think that's great.

55:29.220 --> 55:33.980
Yeah, I think, sure, of course the people are having this backlash where they're like,

55:33.980 --> 55:36.180
no, no, I, but I wanted her to be straight.

55:36.180 --> 55:44.020
Well, for heaven's sake, if you need a attractive female video game character, please consult

55:44.020 --> 55:46.160
all other game culture.

55:46.160 --> 55:50.020
You have your pick of everything.

55:50.380 --> 55:54.060
Let the lesbians have Tracer for heaven's sake.

55:54.060 --> 55:55.560
And also like, so what?

55:55.560 --> 55:56.560
She's a lesbian.

55:56.560 --> 56:00.600
If you still want to fantasize her as waifu, then fucking, it's a fantasy.

56:00.600 --> 56:01.600
It's a fantasy.

56:01.600 --> 56:03.880
Yes, that's a good point.

56:03.880 --> 56:05.820
Tracer does not actually exist.

56:05.820 --> 56:07.720
She is a fictional character.

56:07.720 --> 56:11.800
So you can believe whatever you want to believe about her.

56:11.800 --> 56:13.860
But officially, I think it's important.

56:13.860 --> 56:18.100
It's fun to joke about it, but it is also important to say, look, there are queer characters

56:18.100 --> 56:21.840
in games and they're powerful and their sexuality isn't like they're defined, like they don't

56:21.840 --> 56:26.540
shoulder the burden of representation for lesbians everywhere, that she is just living

56:26.540 --> 56:29.300
her life and being a hero and being a lesbian.

56:29.300 --> 56:33.100
We talked to a guy here in Seattle, Ian, who put it really nicely.

56:33.100 --> 56:36.340
He was talking about Shepard when he was playing Mass Effect.

56:36.340 --> 56:42.380
He said, finally, I could be the gay hero I've always wanted to be.

56:42.380 --> 56:45.940
And I mean, what an amazing opportunity to give people, if you can create a character

56:45.940 --> 56:50.420
that makes people feel like they can be a hero and they can be gay and they can be all

56:50.420 --> 56:52.780
the things that make up who they are all at once.

56:52.780 --> 56:55.300
They don't have to exclude a part of themselves.

56:55.300 --> 56:58.260
What an amazing feeling and what a great way for people to connect.

56:58.260 --> 57:02.860
Well, I think finally I can be the gay hero I've always wanted to be is a good note for

57:02.860 --> 57:04.260
us to end this on.

57:04.260 --> 57:08.320

57:56.000 --> 58:00.640
You are a busy man, Matt, and I appreciate you taking 20 minutes, almost 30 minutes actually,

58:00.640 --> 58:02.200
out to be on our show this week.

58:02.200 --> 58:06.860
Dungeon Buster in chat saying this is a great interview and thanks for the perspective.

58:06.860 --> 58:07.920
Thank you so much for being here, Matt.

58:07.920 --> 58:12.080
Thank you guys for listening and hope to touch base with you in the future, connect

58:12.080 --> 58:13.080
with you.

58:13.080 --> 58:17.220
We seem to run into each other at conventions sometimes, so I hope I can come to your next

58:17.220 --> 58:21.200
Playing with Pride presentation at whatever convention I see you at next.

58:21.200 --> 58:22.200
Hooray!

58:22.200 --> 58:24.800
Yeah, I'm looking forward to that and thanks so much for having me on the show.

58:24.800 --> 58:25.800
Thank you.

58:25.800 --> 58:26.800
Take care, Matt.

58:26.800 --> 58:27.800
Thanks for being here.

58:27.800 --> 58:28.800
Alrighty.

58:28.800 --> 58:29.800
Bye-bye.

58:29.800 --> 58:30.800
Bye.

58:30.800 --> 58:33.220
Alright, again, that's playingwithpride.com and you can also follow Matt on Twitter, Matt

58:33.220 --> 58:36.440
Baume, M-A-T-T B-A-U-M-E.

58:36.440 --> 58:39.500
Thank you so much for taking the time out and being on our show this week and I really

58:39.500 --> 58:45.560
look forward to whatever is next for Playing with Pride, be it documentary, podcasts, whatever,

58:45.560 --> 58:48.080
whatever they decide to do with it.

58:48.080 --> 58:53.300
Anyhow, we're going to get back into some gaming news, but not until we talk about our

58:53.300 --> 58:56.000
gaming weeks, because we are still, we're about an hour into the show.

58:56.000 --> 58:59.080
We haven't even talked about what types of video games we've been playing this week.

58:59.080 --> 59:00.860
So, Loki, how was your gaming week?

59:00.860 --> 59:07.420
So this week I did purchase a new game, so I, and whoa, I played it on Steam even.

59:07.420 --> 59:09.740
It was Happy Room.

59:09.740 --> 59:14.860
So like, I was watching, you know, one of the YouTubers, I watched Ollie43 and he does

59:14.860 --> 59:21.140
a lot of pretty fun GTA 5 mod videos and so one of the games he played was Happy Room

59:21.140 --> 59:25.500
and if you've ever played like Happy Wheels, it's basically kind of the same type of thing

59:25.500 --> 59:31.020
where you have a rag doll that you torture through, you know, all sorts of means, whereas

59:31.020 --> 59:35.620
Happy Wheels is more of getting from point A to point B via bike or whatever and being

59:35.620 --> 59:37.060
horribly offensive.

59:37.060 --> 59:41.340
This is just straight up, here's a dummy, create a death trap for the dummy, do as much

59:41.340 --> 59:43.380
damage as you can, try to kill the dummy.

59:43.380 --> 59:48.340
And so you do that and they have different challenges like, you know, put the dummy on

59:48.340 --> 59:53.700
a saw blade for, you know, 10 seconds or, you know, freeze, electrocute and set on fire

59:53.700 --> 59:55.900
and, I don't know.

59:55.900 --> 59:59.900
So I played that all this week and I finally got to the point where I unlocked the sandbox

59:59.900 --> 01:00:03.620
mode and kind of the point where I'm actually getting trophies now because all of it has

01:00:03.620 --> 01:00:06.140
to do with killing the dummy.

01:00:06.140 --> 01:00:12.060
So it was fun, it was like, I think it was like a 10 buck game, it was pretty cheap.

01:00:12.060 --> 01:00:14.860
But yeah, nice time killer.

01:00:14.860 --> 01:00:20.700
And then a little bit of Ingress and I think I did manage to play a little bit of Skyrim

01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:21.700
Remastered.

01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:24.020
That was about it.

01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:25.020
Alright.

01:00:25.020 --> 01:00:30.740
My gaming week has been kind of boring compared to previous weeks because I didn't play any

01:00:30.740 --> 01:00:31.740
real new stuff.

01:00:31.740 --> 01:00:35.780
I thought about getting Dragon Quest VIII on the 3DS and I really do love Dragon Quest

01:00:35.780 --> 01:00:40.740
VIII but I think it, from what I'm hearing, it seems like it might be a little bit of

01:00:40.740 --> 01:00:45.080
a step down from the PlayStation 2 version because like the orchestrated music can't

01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:49.300
be in there, the little screen kind of makes it a little harder for some stuff.

01:00:49.300 --> 01:00:53.540
So I don't know, I might still pick it up at some point but I didn't end up getting

01:00:53.540 --> 01:00:54.540
Dragon Quest VIII.

01:00:54.540 --> 01:00:58.420
Do you guys think I made the right decision in chat, live.foggamer.com?

01:00:58.420 --> 01:00:59.420
Let's see.

01:00:59.420 --> 01:01:01.980
But what I did play this week, I did play more Final Fantasy XIV which, you know, I

01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:02.980
play a lot of that game obviously.

01:01:02.980 --> 01:01:07.260
But they just had a new patch come out in this past week which was a new story patch.

01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:10.180
That means there's new dungeons, there's a new raid I still got to do.

01:01:10.180 --> 01:01:14.220
There's a lot of new stuff that opened up in Final Fantasy XIV so, you know, that team's

01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:18.360
done a great job of making sure that like new content is coming out every two or three

01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:21.900
months that gives you something else to do, to explore.

01:01:21.900 --> 01:01:23.540
So that's been great.

01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:27.620
So keeps me a fan and has kept me subscribed since the beginning of Realm Reborn really

01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:30.100
so good job to the XIV team.

01:01:30.100 --> 01:01:33.620
And then I also played a little bit of Overwatch, been playing that like I mentioned earlier

01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:34.620
in the show.

01:01:34.620 --> 01:01:35.620
Alan and I will play.

01:01:35.620 --> 01:01:38.240
I'm trying to force myself to learn some new characters.

01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:44.440
So I've taken a weird liking to Ana lately because I learned you kind of, you can use

01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:47.280
her scope and you really should use her scope wherever possible.

01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:50.520
But you can really do a lot with Ana, like not even using her scope.

01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:54.680
Like you can actually be kind of a more effective healer, just kind of like firing bullets repeatedly

01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:57.360
at your team and using the grenades and all the other stuff that she does.

01:01:57.360 --> 01:02:00.600
So I'm just kind of trying to learn and Ana is not an easy character because I'm not a

01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:01.960
very good sniper.

01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:06.020
But I've like tried to learn how to use Widowmaker a little more so I'm kind of like forcing

01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:08.680
myself to be a better sniper, if that makes sense.

01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:10.860
So yeah, you don't really play Overwatch.

01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:15.980
I'm speaking a foreign language to you right now, but I swear you're missing out, Loki.

01:02:15.980 --> 01:02:16.980
It's a real fun game.

01:02:16.980 --> 01:02:18.740
Even if it is a shooter, not everybody's into shooters.

01:02:18.740 --> 01:02:19.740
I have a great time with that.

01:02:19.740 --> 01:02:20.740
I'm in the shooters.

01:02:20.740 --> 01:02:24.140
I just don't want to play online games because it requires me to dedicate a ton of time to

01:02:24.140 --> 01:02:26.180
that stuff and I just don't have that time anymore.

01:02:26.180 --> 01:02:28.820
Well, you know, but the nice thing about Overwatch is those games aren't very long.

01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:32.920
You know, I usually I'll drop in, I'll play like two or three games and then I'll get

01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:35.340
really frustrated and just quit.

01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:37.040
So it's kind of like, you know, drop in, drop out.

01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:40.200
But yeah, just been playing a little bit of Overwatch as well.

01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:41.300
So that's pretty much been my gaming week.

01:02:41.300 --> 01:02:44.680
I haven't really gotten around to doing any new stuff.

01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:47.980
I did do the Hatsune Miku game they released on PlayStation 4, but I can't remember if

01:02:47.980 --> 01:02:52.200
that was last week or this week, but they released a new Hatsune Miku game on PlayStation

01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:56.760
4, but it's you download it and you only get like two songs.

01:02:56.760 --> 01:03:00.860
You have to buy all the rest, but it's like it's kind of a bit of money to buy the other

01:03:00.860 --> 01:03:01.860
song.

01:03:01.940 --> 01:03:06.140
It's like, I think if you drop the, what is it, 50 bucks or something to get both packs,

01:03:06.140 --> 01:03:08.380
I don't know if that's the right number, sorry guys.

01:03:08.380 --> 01:03:09.700
It's like 240 songs.

01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:11.020
It's a lot of songs.

01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:17.300
So I'm kind of like teetering on that buy now button, but because Hatsune Miku is as

01:03:17.300 --> 01:03:20.780
silly and ridiculous as it is, it is kind of a lot of fun for a music game.

01:03:20.780 --> 01:03:23.100
Like I do, I do really enjoy it.

01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:26.620
So like I keep hovering over that buy now button, but it's like, you know, there's going

01:03:26.620 --> 01:03:27.620
to be a sale.

01:03:27.620 --> 01:03:30.900
Like, you know, they're going to do a sale because it's Sega, there's going to be a sale

01:03:30.940 --> 01:03:34.580
Black Friday or something like I can get it cheaper then, but I don't know.

01:03:34.580 --> 01:03:37.900
The question will be, uh, can I, can I hold out that long?

01:03:37.900 --> 01:03:38.900
I don't know.

01:03:38.900 --> 01:03:39.900
Anyway.

01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:44.540
Um, uh, let's see fifth dream and chat over at live.vognetwork.com says I got all the

01:03:44.540 --> 01:03:46.900
future tones songs day one.

01:03:46.900 --> 01:03:50.540
I've been waiting for this for a while and there's, I think people have actually tweeted

01:03:50.540 --> 01:03:52.960
me too, that I should just take the plunge.

01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:55.100
So I probably will, but I just haven't yet.

01:03:55.100 --> 01:03:58.780
I've been getting a lot of use out of just those two songs that the free, free, free

01:03:58.780 --> 01:03:59.780
thing comes with.

01:03:59.940 --> 01:04:01.820
Anyway, so that's it for our gaming week.

01:04:01.820 --> 01:04:06.220
So a little bit of housekeeping, of course, you can always follow us on Twitter, twitter.com

01:04:06.220 --> 01:04:11.500
slash O L R we're also on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.

01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:15.540
I do want to make sure I plug something here coming up this week, actually, actually it's

01:04:15.540 --> 01:04:16.540
tomorrow.

01:04:16.540 --> 01:04:20.380
So if you happen to be local, uh, it would be awesome if you want to drop by and say

01:04:20.380 --> 01:04:21.380
hello.

01:04:21.380 --> 01:04:25.140
Uh, for those of you that are local, um, Sacramento, I GDA, which, you know, we're buddies with

01:04:25.140 --> 01:04:29.140
a Brie and Gabe and all the folks at Sac I GDA, uh, they're actually doing an event tomorrow

01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:35.860
called developing a game from concept to paycheck success through community with T cubed.

01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:38.300
And it's going down at hacker lab downtown.

01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:40.700
And that's tomorrow at six o'clock Pacific.

01:04:40.700 --> 01:04:43.140
And um, I don't know if they're going to stream it or anything like that.

01:04:43.140 --> 01:04:45.180
Sometimes Brie gets it out, gets off the phone.

01:04:45.180 --> 01:04:48.100
It's so exciting because I'm going to actually be down that way.

01:04:48.100 --> 01:04:49.100
Well, not tomorrow.

01:04:49.100 --> 01:04:51.100
Um, come say hello.

01:04:51.100 --> 01:04:54.780
No, I'm going to be down that way in a couple of weeks, actually.

01:04:54.780 --> 01:04:58.480
I'm going to be start working on there for about six weeks because I have a stint going

01:04:58.480 --> 01:04:59.480
down there.

01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:00.480
Nice.

01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:04.420
Um, so I'm going to be talking to the creators of this T cubed, which is, which is actually

01:05:04.420 --> 01:05:05.920
a physical game.

01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:10.120
It's an actual like physical cube that you play like a modern version to tic tac toe

01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:11.120
on.

01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:12.120
Yeah, it's like a tic tac toe thing.

01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:18.280
And then I tried playing on the prototype like back last, um, Sac I GDA arcade and unfortunately

01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:19.860
I didn't quite get it.

01:05:19.860 --> 01:05:20.860
It's evolved a lot.

01:05:20.860 --> 01:05:25.080
I watched this little presentation that the guy did and the way he explained it to the

01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:26.800
whole crowd in like five seconds.

01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:29.200
So I imagine the game shifted a lot.

01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:35.820
Um, so yeah, anyway, um, he started, I think they, they started though doing Android development

01:05:35.820 --> 01:05:37.460
and it kind of shifted into this.

01:05:37.460 --> 01:05:40.680
So anyway, uh, going to be talking to him live at this event.

01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:41.680
They asked me to moderate it.

01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:45.840
So that's why I'm, I'm plugging it cause I'm going to be there moderating this and uh,

01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:46.840
talking about that.

01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:48.360
So for you locals, come on down.

01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:51.400
Um, I don't know if there will be punching pie, but possibly.

01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:52.400
So check that out.

01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:53.400
I'll be there.

01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:54.400
Isn't that all you need?

01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:55.400
All right.

01:05:56.160 --> 01:06:00.080
Let's get into some gaming news Loki.

01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:02.680
So the Oculus lawsuits already begun.

01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:08.720
Um, of course with that Zenny max did, um, make a statement basically saying, you know,

01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:12.880
the, you know, the trial has started and you know, we're excited to present our case and

01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:13.880
all that stuff.

01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:17.360
And we're so awesome and yeah, whatever.

01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:21.880
So um, but what's, you know, a little bit more interesting here though.

01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:28.520
Um, so Mark Zuckerberg is going to be testifying in the trial as well.

01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:34.880
So I'm basically saying, you know, I, I don't think that, um, good virtual reality is fully

01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:35.880
there yet.

01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:38.680
It's going to take five or 10 more years of development before we get to where we want

01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:39.680
to go.

01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:43.920
And then kind of defending that, you know, they didn't actually steal the information

01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:51.320
from, um, Zenny max, uh, it's, you know, they were saying that it's pretty common when you

01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:55.120
announce a big deal or do something that all kinds of people are coming out of the

01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:58.040
woodwork and claiming that they did some portion of the deal.

01:06:58.040 --> 01:07:03.380
Um, like most people in court, I've never even heard of Zenny max before.

01:07:03.380 --> 01:07:09.240
So he's basically kind of saying that they smelled money and so now they're coming and

01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:10.320
try to get a piece of that.

01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:14.320
So it's that Mariah Carey gift that's out there where it says, I don't know her when

01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:15.320
it comes to Zenny max.

01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:16.320
Right?

01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:19.800
I mean, I originally, that's a kind of what it seemed like and they're like, oh yeah,

01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:22.320
we want that $2 billion and we'll see.

01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:25.520
I guess it'll all come out, you know, since it's going to trial now that we'll find out

01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:26.520
what's going on.

01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:27.520
Yeah.

01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:31.160
Usually these things are settled and this is, there's both sides are being very stubborn

01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:34.440
while they want $2 billion so that they aren't going to sell for that.

01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:39.320
So interesting to see what actually happens or I don't know.

01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:44.880
I can't help but think though, I don't really care how the outcome is either way because

01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:46.760
I think the vibe looks like a better product.

01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:47.760
So yeah, whatever.

01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:53.560
Well, and it seems like a lot of folks are, are, are kind of coalescing around the vibe

01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:54.560
right now.

01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:59.400
I mean, I don't, I don't have the same insight into the VR scene as our pal Bobby does.

01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:02.040
But just, you know, just based on what I see on Twitter and people to get the hands on

01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:06.000
and all that, like it seems like there's more kind of coalescing around the vibe right now.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.000
Right now.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Yeah.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.840
And I mean, there's going to be more headsets coming out for sure from a lot of different

01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:11.840
companies.

01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:16.120
I mean, especially now they, they announced more coming from, you know, CES, you know,

01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:20.880
it's going to tie in more with that windows holographic stuff and their virtual reality

01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:22.920
OS type thing.

01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:27.360
So that'll be interesting to see how that plays, you know, part of it.

01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:31.640
But I mean, this certainly is a hassle.

01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:37.480
Well, some other big news that happened this week Nintendo had another direct but this

01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:38.480
one was not about the switch.

01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:42.120
It was about the Fire Emblem series, which I'm going to admit, I don't get super into

01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:43.480
the tactical RPGs.

01:08:43.480 --> 01:08:48.840
So Fire Emblem's not usually a franchise that I get very invested in, but I do recognize

01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:52.380
a lot of people really enjoy this franchise.

01:08:52.380 --> 01:08:56.960
But you know, you might have been more happy if it was like the F-Zero direct or Metro

01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:57.960
direct.

01:08:57.960 --> 01:09:00.280
If it had been the F-Zero direct, I would have popped the popcorn.

01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:02.120
I would have been on the couch with my pants off.

01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:03.120
No, I'm just kidding.

01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:04.120
TMI.

01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:05.120
I'm just kidding.

01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:08.300
But I would be very, very excited if it was an F-Zero direct, but I kind of like, here's

01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:09.300
the thing.

01:09:09.300 --> 01:09:15.660
Kind of accepting, not really accepting, but just trying to accept dealing with the fact

01:09:15.660 --> 01:09:18.780
that Mario Kart has just kind of taken F-Zero's place.

01:09:18.780 --> 01:09:24.020
And that was kind of solidified when they fucking put the F-Zero track in Mario Kart.

01:09:24.020 --> 01:09:27.380
Yeah, but I think that's just a throwback thing.

01:09:27.380 --> 01:09:29.140
I don't think that's necessarily anything.

01:09:29.140 --> 01:09:32.840
It's not like Mario Kart replaced Animal Crossing or Zelda.

01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:34.560
So I mean, they had tracks from those.

01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:35.560
So I don't know.

01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:39.100
I just think that it was, they wanted to do a track and they're like, oh, hey, our

01:09:39.100 --> 01:09:41.060
cars kind of stick to things and it works.

01:09:41.060 --> 01:09:43.300
I mean, Mario Kart 8 is no F-Zero.

01:09:43.300 --> 01:09:47.420
Anyway, Act Def says, seriously, where's my Kirby direct?

01:09:47.420 --> 01:09:48.660
It's the 25th anniversary.

01:09:48.660 --> 01:09:52.380
Well, to be fair, Act Def, it's January, so there's time.

01:09:52.380 --> 01:09:56.420
But what you can pray for right now is that Kirby will get more acknowledgement than Metroid

01:09:56.420 --> 01:09:57.420
got.

01:09:57.420 --> 01:09:58.420
I'm just saying.

01:09:58.420 --> 01:09:59.420
Let's see.

01:09:59.420 --> 01:10:02.860
And Akuma JP says, Japanese love their Fire Emblem.

01:10:02.860 --> 01:10:03.860
That's true.

01:10:03.860 --> 01:10:07.620
I mean, Fire Emblem was a series in Japan for a long time before we ever saw it.

01:10:07.620 --> 01:10:13.060
And really, I kind of think we can thank Smash Brothers for finally getting Fire Emblem

01:10:13.060 --> 01:10:17.500
over here because a lot of people were asking, who's these characters?

01:10:17.500 --> 01:10:20.900
Why are they, it's too bad that same logic hasn't worked for Mother 3, but at least we

01:10:20.900 --> 01:10:21.900
had Earthbound.

01:10:21.900 --> 01:10:22.900
Yeah.

01:10:22.900 --> 01:10:29.780
I mean, F-Zero, they had the 25th anniversary two years ago for that.

01:10:29.780 --> 01:10:30.780
No new F-Zero yet.

01:10:30.780 --> 01:10:31.780
No, not yet.

01:10:31.780 --> 01:10:32.780
Where's the love?

01:10:32.780 --> 01:10:33.780
Where's the love?

01:10:33.780 --> 01:10:34.780
I don't know.

01:10:34.780 --> 01:10:36.020
Anyway, so about the direct.

01:10:36.020 --> 01:10:39.660
So for Fire Emblem fans, and even if you're a non-fan, maybe this is your chance to get

01:10:39.660 --> 01:10:43.300
involved with the series because it's definitely going to show up everywhere.

01:10:43.300 --> 01:10:47.540
For a series that was almost dead a few years ago, Nintendo was like, if you don't sell

01:10:47.540 --> 01:10:49.760
a quarter million of these, we're done.

01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:51.620
This is a remarkable turnaround for Fire Emblem.

01:10:51.620 --> 01:10:52.620
So good for them.

01:10:52.620 --> 01:10:57.100
But anyway, Fire Emblem Echoes Shadows of Valentia has been announced.

01:10:57.100 --> 01:11:01.380
It's going to be a 3DS game, which I found interesting because I was ready to say, oh,

01:11:01.380 --> 01:11:05.500
the 3DS is done as a Pokemon Sun and Moon, but that doesn't appear to be the case.

01:11:05.980 --> 01:11:08.300
You got to keep pumping money in that just in case.

01:11:08.300 --> 01:11:11.580
I guess, but wow, that was kind of surprising me.

01:11:11.580 --> 01:11:13.700
And now it's kind of like, well, why not just put it on the Switch?

01:11:13.700 --> 01:11:15.340
Because that's your new portable system.

01:11:15.340 --> 01:11:18.780
Well, Fire Emblem will be getting a Switch game in 2018.

01:11:18.780 --> 01:11:21.420
That was something else that they announced during this.

01:11:21.420 --> 01:11:24.740
So not only is there going to be the 3DS game, but there is going to be a Fire Emblem Switch

01:11:24.740 --> 01:11:27.460
game in 2018.

01:11:27.460 --> 01:11:32.060
It is going to be the first console game since Radiant Dawn, which was released in 2008.

01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:34.580
So that's a pretty big deal.

01:11:34.700 --> 01:11:37.460
Fire Emblem Heroes also coming out.

01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:40.320
This is Nintendo's next smartphone game.

01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:43.700
So it's the follow-up of sorts to Super Mario Run.

01:11:43.700 --> 01:11:46.620
But we knew they'd been working on Fire Emblem and Animal Crossing games.

01:11:46.620 --> 01:11:47.820
So here we go.

01:11:47.820 --> 01:11:50.820
Fire Emblem Heroes is on its way.

01:11:50.820 --> 01:11:55.180
Originally in the presentation said it would only be on Google Play right away, but after

01:11:55.180 --> 01:11:59.460
the fact came out and clarified, it will be a simultaneous release on both platforms.

01:11:59.460 --> 01:12:04.200
February 2nd is the day, so that's not far away really for Fire Emblem Heroes.

01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:08.280
This may be a good way for people like me who are kind of, I don't know, I don't really

01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:13.120
like tactical RPG, but hey, when you put the price tag of free on it, I'll check it out.

01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:14.120
Right?

01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:15.120
So.

01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:16.120
Well.

01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:20.000
Well, BS, but there are going to be microtransactions in the game.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:21.720
So we'll see how bad it is.

01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:24.760
I can't believe they have actually, like, you know, I know they did that with Super

01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:31.340
Mario Run on iOS and I just figured it was, you know, Apple being retarded.

01:12:31.340 --> 01:12:34.460
But they had, you know, the whole, like, notify me.

01:12:34.460 --> 01:12:38.920
It's almost like a pre-order for a free-to-play game, like, dude, nobody needs to fucking

01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:41.460
notify me that there's something on the market, you know.

01:12:41.460 --> 01:12:42.460
I don't care.

01:12:42.460 --> 01:12:44.720
I have something that notifies me way faster.

01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:48.820
It's called Twitter, just for the record, but even with that notify thing, it didn't

01:12:48.820 --> 01:12:49.820
even really work.

01:12:49.820 --> 01:12:52.940
Like, people got notified, like, mid-day after the game had already been out.

01:12:52.940 --> 01:12:57.700
It worked as well as the fucking Amazon notify me when the Switch becomes in stock.

01:12:57.700 --> 01:12:58.700
Twice.

01:12:58.700 --> 01:12:59.900
Twice it was for sale.

01:12:59.900 --> 01:13:02.740
Twice it did not fucking send one single notification.

01:13:02.740 --> 01:13:05.500
I was signed up for that too and it never did send, did it?

01:13:05.500 --> 01:13:06.500
We never, yeah.

01:13:06.500 --> 01:13:08.060
It's like, what's the point, Amazon?

01:13:08.060 --> 01:13:11.020
Why even have that if you're not gonna fucking use it?

01:13:11.020 --> 01:13:19.180
Anyway, let's see, Fire Emblem Warriors also will be coming to the new Nintendo 3DS and

01:13:19.180 --> 01:13:25.680
that of course is the, like, Hyrule Warriors Musou game.

01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:28.780
What the hell was the original of that series?

01:13:28.780 --> 01:13:29.780
Why can't I remember all this?

01:13:29.780 --> 01:13:33.180
Thank you, Dynasty Warriors-esque type of game.

01:13:33.180 --> 01:13:37.740
That will be also on the new Nintendo 3DS.

01:13:37.740 --> 01:13:41.020
Interesting that they say just new Nintendo 3DS.

01:13:41.020 --> 01:13:44.340
My thought is they have now written off the old 3DS.

01:13:44.340 --> 01:13:45.340
Oh, yeah.

01:13:45.340 --> 01:13:46.340
Interesting.

01:13:46.340 --> 01:13:47.340
Yeah, I didn't.

01:13:47.340 --> 01:13:48.340
Yeah.

01:13:48.340 --> 01:13:49.340
Stupid.

01:13:49.340 --> 01:13:53.060
Yeah, seeing as I still haven't bought a new 3DS, that doesn't bode well for me, but

01:13:53.060 --> 01:13:56.060
I don't know, anyway.

01:13:56.060 --> 01:13:58.980
That's pretty much what I wanted to say on Fire Emblem.

01:13:59.380 --> 01:14:04.020
Did they come out and clarify that it would work on the older 3DS as well?

01:14:04.020 --> 01:14:08.820
I don't think it will because, if it's the Warriors game, just because I think that they

01:14:08.820 --> 01:14:18.420
did that for the new 3DS for Hyrule Warriors and it ran like shit on the regular 3DS.

01:14:18.420 --> 01:14:20.980
And Act F confirms it's new 3DS only.

01:14:20.980 --> 01:14:21.980
Wow.

01:14:21.980 --> 01:14:23.260
Well, alright.

01:14:23.260 --> 01:14:24.260
Good luck with that strategy.

01:14:24.260 --> 01:14:25.260
Guess I better buy a new 3DS.

01:14:25.260 --> 01:14:26.260
Oh, nope.

01:14:26.260 --> 01:14:27.260
Nope.

01:14:27.260 --> 01:14:28.260
Not gonna do it.

01:14:28.540 --> 01:14:30.980
I still have the Switch, so I can always get the Switch version, but...

01:14:30.980 --> 01:14:35.420
Yeah, I mean, it's not gonna be an underpowered system or anything, so...

01:14:35.420 --> 01:14:36.420
Alright.

01:14:36.420 --> 01:14:37.420
Anyhow.

01:14:37.420 --> 01:14:38.420
Do you want to do this piece?

01:14:38.420 --> 01:14:42.460
So, we have to divvy up Dark Sakura's stories, because she was slotted on our list here,

01:14:42.460 --> 01:14:43.460
but she's not here.

01:14:43.460 --> 01:14:47.220
She had to cancel last minute, so do you want to do this one, Loki?

01:14:47.220 --> 01:14:48.220
Sure.

01:14:48.220 --> 01:14:53.420
So, apparently some Zelda fans have uncovered the Breath of the Wild backstory from the

01:14:53.420 --> 01:14:54.940
Special Edition map.

01:14:54.940 --> 01:15:02.500
So they were showing off the map on the whole Treehouse livestream, and apparently people

01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:08.340
have decoded the Hyrulean language on there, and so they've kind of gotten the backstory.

01:15:08.340 --> 01:15:11.780
So here's what it says.

01:15:11.780 --> 01:15:18.700
Hylians passed stories of a destined time long past where multiple races lived and worked

01:15:18.700 --> 01:15:20.380
together in harmony.

01:15:20.380 --> 01:15:25.060
The Sheikah tribe's blue aura breathed through the land.

01:15:25.060 --> 01:15:29.380
This mutual prosperity continued until cataclysmic disaster struck.

01:15:29.380 --> 01:15:34.020
The hero and the princess attempted to seal the terror, which became known as the Calamity

01:15:34.020 --> 01:15:35.020
Ganon.

01:15:35.020 --> 01:15:36.020
Ooh, Calamity Ganon.

01:15:36.020 --> 01:15:39.020
That's not just regular Ganon, that's Calamity Ganon.

01:15:39.020 --> 01:15:41.460
I like Calamity Jane.

01:15:41.460 --> 01:15:47.740
Divine beasts awoke from four directions and deployed a mechanical army, which made the

01:15:47.740 --> 01:15:49.700
king and his people fearful.

01:15:49.700 --> 01:15:56.220
They fractured Ganon's powers and sealed him, but the Sheikahs were banished from the

01:15:56.220 --> 01:15:58.820
land ever since.

01:15:58.820 --> 01:16:01.620
So it's Zelda.

01:16:01.620 --> 01:16:07.400
Ganon rose to power, they broke up the Triforce, it's fucking Zelda.

01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:12.740
And that's okay, because that's the game we all want to play, so that sounds fine by me.

01:16:12.740 --> 01:16:16.020
Anyhow, I hope that was, I hope that some people would have considered what we just

01:16:16.020 --> 01:16:20.180
talked about, spoilers, but I really think there's a lot more layers to this game than

01:16:20.180 --> 01:16:21.180
that one little piece.

01:16:21.180 --> 01:16:25.140
So I hope your feathers weren't ruffled by us going over that, but it is, it is traveling

01:16:25.140 --> 01:16:26.140
around.

01:16:26.140 --> 01:16:27.140
It's a backstory.

01:16:27.140 --> 01:16:28.140
I mean, it's like, it's fucking Zelda.

01:16:28.140 --> 01:16:29.260
Everybody wants to know about this new Zelda.

01:16:29.260 --> 01:16:34.380
They haven't, for all, you know, that's out there, they haven't said a lot about it.

01:16:34.380 --> 01:16:37.740
I mean, sure, they've showed the game, they have the trailer and so forth, but we haven't,

01:16:37.740 --> 01:16:41.420
we don't know a lot about the story, so it'd be interesting to see where it goes.

01:16:41.420 --> 01:16:43.980
Anyhow, what else in gaming news, Loki?

01:16:43.980 --> 01:16:44.980
All right.

01:16:45.020 --> 01:16:49.780
So apparently the developer of the last Guitar Hero game, Freestyle Games, has been acquired

01:16:49.780 --> 01:16:50.780
by Ubisoft.

01:16:50.780 --> 01:16:55.540
Does that mean that they're going to work on something else?

01:16:55.540 --> 01:16:57.660
Rocksmith, maybe?

01:16:57.660 --> 01:17:00.020
I'm hoping not, though, because remember Freestyle is...

01:17:00.020 --> 01:17:01.020
Or just Dance.

01:17:01.020 --> 01:17:03.860
Eh, fuck just Dance.

01:17:03.860 --> 01:17:06.860
Because Freestyle Games, remember, they did the DJ Hero franchise.

01:17:06.860 --> 01:17:07.860
Yeah.

01:17:07.860 --> 01:17:08.860
So...

01:17:08.860 --> 01:17:11.660
Please, another DJ Hero game.

01:17:11.660 --> 01:17:14.340
Or DJ something else game.

01:17:14.740 --> 01:17:16.740
A DJ Smith type of game.

01:17:16.740 --> 01:17:17.740
DJ Smith?

01:17:17.740 --> 01:17:19.740
Maybe, I don't know, I don't know, maybe.

01:17:19.740 --> 01:17:20.740
Beat Smith?

01:17:20.740 --> 01:17:21.740
Maybe.

01:17:21.740 --> 01:17:22.740
Dubstep Smith?

01:17:22.740 --> 01:17:28.860
Well, I'm just glad to hear they're not closing, because their games, as far as I've heard,

01:17:28.860 --> 01:17:32.660
have kind of underperformed, but I really feel like it's not their fault.

01:17:32.660 --> 01:17:36.820
Like a lot of what happened at the DJ Hero and the Guitar Hero era was just like saturation

01:17:36.820 --> 01:17:37.820
in the market of music games.

01:17:37.820 --> 01:17:43.660
It's fucking Ubisoft, because they decided to have so many developers making just fucking

01:17:43.660 --> 01:17:47.060
million Guitar Hero games, like they have four Guitar Hero games coming out each year,

01:17:47.060 --> 01:17:48.780
which is too much.

01:17:48.780 --> 01:17:54.580
And then on top of that, a lot of these other studios get rolled into fucking Call of Duty,

01:17:54.580 --> 01:17:59.580
where they're just like, oh, we got four different studios working on Call of Duty, and some

01:17:59.580 --> 01:18:01.700
working on DLC.

01:18:01.700 --> 01:18:06.220
That would be where these guys would end up, had they not been purchased.

01:18:06.220 --> 01:18:07.220
Yeah, that's really...

01:18:07.220 --> 01:18:12.660
And so what the last thing they really did was Guitar Hero Live, which was like the reboot

01:18:12.660 --> 01:18:17.380
of Guitar Hero, which really wasn't bad at all, but like, I think people were just like...

01:18:17.380 --> 01:18:18.380
They don't care.

01:18:18.380 --> 01:18:19.380
They don't care.

01:18:19.380 --> 01:18:21.020
It doesn't have the impact anymore than it used to do.

01:18:21.020 --> 01:18:24.260
So I'd be curious to see what Freestyle Games, but like you mentioned, they also do Call

01:18:24.260 --> 01:18:29.260
of Duty stuff now, so they kind of have a very broad range of stuff they do, so it'll

01:18:29.260 --> 01:18:32.720
be very interesting to see what they do when they team up with Ubisoft and what ends up

01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:33.720
coming out.

01:18:33.720 --> 01:18:38.620
But I imagine we won't hear anything until E3 at the earliest, if then, because projects

01:18:38.620 --> 01:18:39.620
take time.

01:18:40.180 --> 01:18:42.740
We may not hear anything until 2018, for all we know.

01:18:42.740 --> 01:18:47.340
Anyhow, something you can do right now, especially if you have a PlayStation VR, you know, there

01:18:47.340 --> 01:18:52.620
was a lot of VR games that hit early on when the thing first came out, but now it's been

01:18:52.620 --> 01:18:54.340
drying up a little bit, even though it is January.

01:18:54.340 --> 01:18:57.740
It hasn't been drying up, but there's just not a whole ton of like really great stuff.

01:18:57.740 --> 01:18:58.740
Not a lot of compelling software, yeah.

01:18:58.740 --> 01:19:02.240
Like they have that rollercoaster game that was supposed to be coming out that came out

01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:03.980
and was just shit.

01:19:03.980 --> 01:19:07.100
It was absolute dog shit.

01:19:07.100 --> 01:19:11.820
So that was unfortunate, but there's not like really big games coming out for VR.

01:19:11.820 --> 01:19:17.500
I mean, aside from Resident Evil 7, which is supposed to be next week, but beyond that,

01:19:17.500 --> 01:19:19.540
there's not a whole ton on the horizon.

01:19:19.540 --> 01:19:24.660
Well, something that's an added benefit now for PlayStation VR is that there is now support

01:19:24.660 --> 01:19:28.420
for 360 degree videos on YouTube.

01:19:28.420 --> 01:19:33.700
So the app has been updated, so you can actually look at these 360 degree videos.

01:19:33.780 --> 01:19:38.580
Granted, there aren't a ton of them, but the New York Times, I guess, has a daily 360 video

01:19:38.580 --> 01:19:39.980
that they do.

01:19:39.980 --> 01:19:45.620
So I mentioned a lot of times when these new technologies come out, like you see the 4K

01:19:45.620 --> 01:19:50.120
TVs on display at, you know, your local Best Buy or whatever.

01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:55.860
They're always showing either like a sports thing or it's nature.

01:19:55.860 --> 01:20:01.180
Like let's explore the insides of a volcano and you can see it in high definition and

01:20:01.300 --> 01:20:03.820
you can make out every single rock that's there.

01:20:03.820 --> 01:20:06.700
So I imagine these are the type of videos that are available on YouTube.

01:20:06.700 --> 01:20:10.260
I don't have a PSVR, but I imagine these are the type of things that are available on YouTube

01:20:10.260 --> 01:20:11.500
360, right?

01:20:11.500 --> 01:20:13.220
Explore the insides of a volcano.

01:20:13.220 --> 01:20:15.260
I haven't done that, but I've done them on my phone and stuff.

01:20:15.260 --> 01:20:18.900
National Geographic goes to the rainforest, those types of things.

01:20:18.900 --> 01:20:21.460
Yeah, I mean, it's just that kind of thing.

01:20:21.460 --> 01:20:24.820
I mean, it's, I don't know, they're okay.

01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:27.700
Like I watched them with like dolphins running along a boat or something.

01:20:27.700 --> 01:20:28.700
Oh, the dolphins are cute.

01:20:28.700 --> 01:20:29.700
It was all right.

01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:30.700
It's like, okay.

01:20:31.220 --> 01:20:36.540
A lot of them I find, you know, the 360 videos, it's like they really, I mean, there's really

01:20:36.540 --> 01:20:39.140
no need for them to be 360.

01:20:39.140 --> 01:20:40.140
I don't know.

01:20:40.140 --> 01:20:46.740
Let's get a 360 video of a guar concert or something that I can just really be there

01:20:46.740 --> 01:20:47.740
in the middle of things.

01:20:47.740 --> 01:20:54.060
I want, I want, I want that guy to like inhale blood and then spit it all over the camera

01:20:54.060 --> 01:20:56.300
at one of these like death metal shows.

01:20:56.300 --> 01:20:59.740
That's what I want to do on YouTube 360 because I'm getting too old for a mosh pit.

01:20:59.780 --> 01:21:02.300
So wouldn't that be an exciting experience?

01:21:02.300 --> 01:21:05.920
Would you, would you watch a rock concert?

01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:09.460
Maybe once.

01:21:09.460 --> 01:21:10.460
Maybe one.

01:21:10.460 --> 01:21:11.460
I don't know.

01:21:11.460 --> 01:21:17.100
It's just, I tried, I guess I still have to try it out.

01:21:17.100 --> 01:21:19.100
I haven't bothered to mess with that.

01:21:19.100 --> 01:21:20.460
I played a lot of Yarsa.

01:21:20.460 --> 01:21:26.700
I actually have, was it, I purchased, um, last sale, I think, um, that whole, um, Oh,

01:21:27.260 --> 01:21:29.780
what the hell is it called now?

01:21:29.780 --> 01:21:35.500
It was, it said the bar VR one where he actually can like throw bottles and like you could,

01:21:35.500 --> 01:21:40.820
you can play, you can play games like you can play billiards and skeeball and shuffle

01:21:40.820 --> 01:21:43.460
board and darts and all that stuff.

01:21:43.460 --> 01:21:47.300
Or you can stack chairs, you can throw bottles, you can do all sorts of, and it's multiplayer

01:21:47.300 --> 01:21:48.300
so you can play with other people.

01:21:48.300 --> 01:21:49.300
You can throw bottles at people?

01:21:49.300 --> 01:21:51.040
You can throw bottles at people.

01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:52.040
Bar fight.

01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:53.040
Yeah, you could.

01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:56.580
You could do a bar fight or you can like stack chairs and then like knock them over or you

01:21:56.580 --> 01:22:01.580
can, you know, just cheat and skeeball by like crawling up the, you know, skeeball thing

01:22:01.580 --> 01:22:02.580
to drop the balls in.

01:22:02.580 --> 01:22:04.860
Best use of VR yet.

01:22:04.860 --> 01:22:10.460
It's pretty silly, but, um, more of that stuff please.

01:22:10.460 --> 01:22:14.900
To register participation for this week's episode of orange lounge radio at vognetwork.com,

01:22:14.900 --> 01:22:16.380
use the pass phrase option.

01:22:16.380 --> 01:22:22.020
All right, well, uh, valve, uh, obviously they are behind the HTC Vive and hopefully

01:22:22.020 --> 01:22:24.900
they're going to be developing some more VR games.

01:22:24.900 --> 01:22:29.740
Uh, and it has been talked about this week that valve does have more unannounced games

01:22:29.740 --> 01:22:31.460
in the work works.

01:22:31.460 --> 01:22:37.220
And this is straight from the Gabe himself because he did a AMA on Reddit.

01:22:37.220 --> 01:22:42.580
Uh, and the question that was asked was, is valve still working on any fully fledged single

01:22:42.580 --> 01:22:44.020
player games?

01:22:44.020 --> 01:22:49.740
And the answer that Gabe Newell gave was yes, that's it.

01:22:49.740 --> 01:22:56.100
Just, yes, very direct and to the point, I don't really care about sequels and stuff,

01:22:56.100 --> 01:23:01.380
but like, I'm just glad they're working on something because like, honestly they haven't

01:23:01.380 --> 01:23:06.020
had a lot come out recently and I used to like it when it was like, when they were releasing

01:23:06.020 --> 01:23:09.460
more stuff for you, like left for dead and portal and all that stuff, I'd be just happy

01:23:09.460 --> 01:23:13.820
for a sequel for anything or something new even just because all their stuff is pretty

01:23:13.820 --> 01:23:14.820
fantastic.

01:23:15.260 --> 01:23:19.740
And apparently Gabe also replied to like a half-life three question and wrote a very

01:23:19.740 --> 01:23:23.140
tongue in cheek, the number three must not be said.

01:23:23.140 --> 01:23:25.380
So Gabe is self-aware everybody.

01:23:25.380 --> 01:23:27.740
So yes, I'm sure he is aware of the internet.

01:23:27.740 --> 01:23:28.740
I'm sure.

01:23:28.740 --> 01:23:29.740
Yes.

01:23:29.740 --> 01:23:33.180
Gabe has apparently heard of the internet and has seen your memes.

01:23:33.180 --> 01:23:34.420
Look out everybody.

01:23:34.420 --> 01:23:35.420
He's listening.

01:23:35.420 --> 01:23:36.420
Anyway.

01:23:36.420 --> 01:23:41.100
Uh, yeah, no clues really in the AMA what else is going on, but, uh, he did say as part

01:23:41.100 --> 01:23:45.100
of the AMA that, uh, they are trying to get more games on the source engine.

01:23:45.100 --> 01:23:49.180
And that is the foundation of some unannounced projects.

01:23:49.180 --> 01:23:50.180
So there it is.

01:23:50.180 --> 01:23:54.940
He said, listen, we are not making any games with the name, with the number three in the

01:23:54.940 --> 01:24:01.820
title period, uh, dungeon Buster in chat says, uh, are you working on something?

01:24:01.820 --> 01:24:02.820
Yes.

01:24:02.820 --> 01:24:04.540
Internet loses its collective shit.

01:24:04.540 --> 01:24:05.540
Pretty much SSG.

01:24:05.540 --> 01:24:06.540
One hundred.

01:24:06.540 --> 01:24:08.380
Matt says, Gabe has seen your dank memes.

01:24:08.380 --> 01:24:12.660
He's unimpressed pretty much.

01:24:12.660 --> 01:24:14.860
Let's all hope Gabe doesn't listen to this show.

01:24:14.860 --> 01:24:23.140
Uh, anyway, uh, dark Tetsuya jokes, half-life two episode 2.2 see that no three in there.

01:24:23.140 --> 01:24:25.500
Oh, there'll be a new half-life game.

01:24:25.500 --> 01:24:27.700
It'll be like a remastered half-life game.

01:24:27.700 --> 01:24:30.660
It'll be a half, half-life full life.

01:24:30.660 --> 01:24:32.260
Uh, all right.

01:24:32.260 --> 01:24:36.100
Uh, Loki what's next before we get to the classic game of the week here soon half for

01:24:36.100 --> 01:24:37.100
life.

01:24:37.100 --> 01:24:38.100
Okay.

01:24:38.100 --> 01:24:49.340
Um, so Nintendo, um, you know, they had, they've released, you know, Super Mario Brothers for,

01:24:49.340 --> 01:24:51.660
you know, many times on virtual console.

01:24:51.660 --> 01:24:58.340
Well, the Wii, um, I want to say the, yeah, the Wii version of the game, um, apparently

01:24:58.340 --> 01:25:04.120
someone dug through the actual files on virtual console and they found out that there's, um,

01:25:04.120 --> 01:25:08.160
some lines of code from a header from an NES file.

01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:13.400
Now those NES files were built originally for emulators.

01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:21.960
Um, so this basically isn't necessarily a dump from the ROM because this was added specifically

01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:29.360
to those things to, you know, point the emulator to the right, um, ROM files to read.

01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:35.080
So what's kind of funny is this file actually existed on the internet prior to the Wii.

01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:43.960
So it's almost like that they downloaded the ROM and then resold it to you and the ultimate

01:25:43.960 --> 01:25:44.960
irony.

01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:45.960
Yeah, I know.

01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:49.640
It's one of those things where I noticed there's, there seems to be a lot of rage around this

01:25:49.640 --> 01:25:54.000
story or whatever, like how dare Nintendo sell us, uh, this product.

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:58.800
But I'm kind of like, well, it's kind of a funny gotcha in a way.

01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:00.000
It's not a funny gotcha.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:01.000
It's basically...

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:02.000
What?

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:03.000
Why not?

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:04.000
It's their fucking game.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:05.000
Let them do what they want.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:06.000
Well, right.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:10.400
I understand that, but, and it is technically their property, but it's like someone dumped

01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:11.400
it.

01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:12.400
Okay.

01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:13.400
Let me, I'm trying to think of the best way to describe this.

01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:20.600
So like, um, imagine that somebody, okay, here's a good example.

01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:25.640
I think that we can liken this to like someone fan translating a game and then they decided

01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:31.520
to sell the game online with those translations, you know, technically it's their thing.

01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:38.320
It's something that was added to the game, you know, um, modified to the actual ROM file

01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:41.640
and then they're reselling it because, hey, it's our property and we would just sue you

01:26:41.640 --> 01:26:42.640
anyways.

01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:48.560
I mean, it's a, such a minor thing though for this NES ROM, which is kind of funny.

01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:52.580
I think it's one of those funny, like, haha, you know, they tell us not to download ROMs

01:26:52.580 --> 01:26:55.860
and here they are downloading ROMs and reselling them.

01:26:55.860 --> 01:27:00.700
Well, but it, it took a long time to figure this out.

01:27:00.700 --> 01:27:04.060
I mean, how long is Super Mario Brothers been on the Wii Virtual Console?

01:27:04.060 --> 01:27:05.660
The Wii's a 10 year old system now.

01:27:05.660 --> 01:27:09.600
I don't, I don't remember what was out day one for Virtual Console, but I can't imagine

01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:10.600
this wasn't one of them.

01:27:10.600 --> 01:27:13.180
So it's been like 10 years until people figured this out.

01:27:13.180 --> 01:27:14.180
Right?

01:27:14.180 --> 01:27:15.180
Yeah.

01:27:15.180 --> 01:27:18.500
I'm just surprised they didn't redump it themselves, but I guess the data would be the same, but

01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:20.740
the header thing that's kind of interesting.

01:27:20.740 --> 01:27:26.580
I wonder if it actually uses the header in their emulator or if their emulator is based

01:27:26.580 --> 01:27:30.780
off of like, you know, one of the NES emulators out there.

01:27:30.780 --> 01:27:31.780
Hmm.

01:27:31.780 --> 01:27:32.780
All right.

01:27:32.780 --> 01:27:37.660
Well, uh, let's see, I gotta get to one more story here and then we'll, uh, give Dark Sakura

01:27:37.660 --> 01:27:42.780
a call to do our classic console of the week, but, uh, speaking of Zelda and the Wii U,

01:27:42.780 --> 01:27:48.420
it was confirmed this week that Breath of the Wild will be the last Wii U game and that

01:27:48.420 --> 01:27:52.140
was confirmed by Reggie Fils-Aime, the man, of course, at Nintendo's America.

01:27:52.140 --> 01:27:54.580
I'd assume that's the last Nintendo first party, right?

01:27:54.580 --> 01:27:55.580
Right.

01:27:55.580 --> 01:27:58.180
From a first party standpoint, there's no new development coming after the launch of

01:27:58.180 --> 01:27:59.180
Breath of the Wild.

01:27:59.180 --> 01:28:00.180
Okay.

01:28:00.180 --> 01:28:02.860
But to be fair, I mean, sure, maybe a third party will put something out, but like even

01:28:02.860 --> 01:28:04.980
the Indies started jumping ship, right?

01:28:04.980 --> 01:28:07.420
Everybody's like, nope, we're developing for the Switch now and if you kickstart it on

01:28:07.420 --> 01:28:09.700
Wii U, we can move that over or whatever.

01:28:09.700 --> 01:28:13.340
But he also said we really are at the end of life for Wii U.

01:28:13.340 --> 01:28:16.500
So, um, confirmed that that is, that's it.

01:28:16.500 --> 01:28:17.500
Pretty sad.

01:28:17.580 --> 01:28:18.580
Didn't last that long.

01:28:18.580 --> 01:28:21.980
No, Wii U really didn't last that long, but we kind of, it's not surprising though.

01:28:21.980 --> 01:28:25.940
Nintendo really wants to shift the conversation, you know, everybody's written off the Wii

01:28:25.940 --> 01:28:26.940
U at this point.

01:28:26.940 --> 01:28:28.580
So Nintendo really wants to shift the conversation.

01:28:28.580 --> 01:28:33.420
They wrote it off because of the underpowered system with underpowered specs that didn't

01:28:33.420 --> 01:28:37.100
have third party support, kind of like their new system.

01:28:37.100 --> 01:28:40.860
I mean, so what makes you think that this is not going to fucking be a whole repeat

01:28:40.860 --> 01:28:41.860
of this thing?

01:28:41.860 --> 01:28:46.780
Just because, oh, I can take it somewhere and, but when the novelty novelty runs off

01:28:46.780 --> 01:28:53.540
on that, like it just runs out, I just, I just think they're not learning their lesson

01:28:53.540 --> 01:28:54.540
is the thing.

01:28:54.540 --> 01:29:00.220
Well, they, they don't really have a lot of, like if the Switch is a failure, then Nintendo

01:29:00.220 --> 01:29:02.380
is going to be, I don't know what's going to happen.

01:29:02.380 --> 01:29:05.740
Put out a heart, put out a console that has some fucking muscle in it.

01:29:05.740 --> 01:29:06.740
That's what you need to do.

01:29:06.740 --> 01:29:09.620
You'll, oh, your console's not going to be the cheapest.

01:29:09.620 --> 01:29:16.260
Big fucking deal if you have the games and the support from third party, it won't matter.

01:29:16.260 --> 01:29:20.180
You know, something that was posed to me the other day, which I think is worth asking is

01:29:20.180 --> 01:29:27.020
that what if Nintendo can add a little oomph in that dock because they could sell theoretically

01:29:27.020 --> 01:29:31.020
a dock that would be capable of 4k and all this other stuff for the system, right?

01:29:31.020 --> 01:29:36.900
They could do a little bit more of an incremental upgrade a la PlayStation four pro or a project

01:29:36.900 --> 01:29:40.020
Scorpio, but even cheaper because it would just be the dock.

01:29:40.020 --> 01:29:41.020
I don't think so.

01:29:41.020 --> 01:29:44.780
And the reason for that is because I think that the way that it actually interfaces with

01:29:44.780 --> 01:29:47.220
the dock is it's just outputting.

01:29:47.220 --> 01:29:52.820
It's basically extending HDMI out from the system and adding a power source.

01:29:52.820 --> 01:29:55.660
So I don't think that, I have to actually take a look at the system, but I don't think

01:29:55.660 --> 01:29:58.820
it's like some sort of, you know, new thing.

01:29:58.820 --> 01:30:04.620
I bet it's just like HDMI out and power in and that's it.

01:30:04.620 --> 01:30:08.180
You know, it may be something that, it might even not even necessarily be something that

01:30:08.180 --> 01:30:09.820
tells it it's in the dock mode.

01:30:09.820 --> 01:30:14.820
That could be just when it receives power from the video signal through the HDMI port

01:30:14.820 --> 01:30:19.380
that it's, okay, now I'm in portable or docked mode or something like that, but I don't think

01:30:19.380 --> 01:30:22.360
that they're going to be able to add any extra processing to it.

01:30:22.360 --> 01:30:26.940
What they probably will do later on down the road is release a system that's 1080p handheld

01:30:26.940 --> 01:30:32.740
and you know, maybe a little bit beefed up specs or something like they do with all their

01:30:32.740 --> 01:30:33.740
other systems.

01:30:33.740 --> 01:30:39.420
It's just, I'm just, I'm very concerned by this.

01:30:39.420 --> 01:30:41.820
This is one of the reasons I'm very hesitant about the system.

01:30:41.820 --> 01:30:46.980
It's like, I like the idea of a portable system, but I think I'm just buying into the hype

01:30:46.980 --> 01:30:50.100
too much and I, I don't know.

01:30:50.100 --> 01:30:54.940
Well, we will see what happens, but for now I want to get to a segment that we do on the

01:30:54.940 --> 01:30:59.680
show called the classic game of the week, but what a twist.

01:30:59.680 --> 01:31:02.220
It's going to be the classic system of the month tonight.

01:31:02.220 --> 01:31:07.980
We're going to get our good pal Dark Sakura on the line here who's going to take us down

01:31:07.980 --> 01:31:12.660
the memory lane so we can talk about a classic system of the week.

01:31:12.660 --> 01:31:13.660
Hi.

01:31:13.660 --> 01:31:14.660
Hi.

01:31:14.660 --> 01:31:16.660
How are you?

01:31:16.660 --> 01:31:20.140
Um, my face hurts.

01:31:20.140 --> 01:31:21.900
Sorry about your face.

01:31:21.900 --> 01:31:22.900
We miss you.

01:31:22.900 --> 01:31:23.900
Me too.

01:31:23.900 --> 01:31:24.900
Thank you.

01:31:24.900 --> 01:31:28.900
Um, so I have a sinus infection.

01:31:28.900 --> 01:31:29.900
Are you wrong?

01:31:29.900 --> 01:31:33.940
Are we, is Jamie really quiet for you guys or is it just me?

01:31:33.940 --> 01:31:34.940
I don't know.

01:31:34.940 --> 01:31:35.940
I'm talking loudly.

01:31:35.940 --> 01:31:36.940
Oh yeah.

01:31:36.940 --> 01:31:37.940
I don't know.

01:31:37.940 --> 01:31:41.260
I mean, for some reason in studio, you're not coming through very loud, but your levels

01:31:41.260 --> 01:31:44.900
for the folks that are listening at home look like they're just fine.

01:31:44.900 --> 01:31:45.900
Yeah.

01:31:45.900 --> 01:31:46.900
So anyway, sorry about that.

01:31:46.900 --> 01:31:47.900
It's live.

01:31:47.900 --> 01:31:48.900
What can you do about it?

01:31:48.900 --> 01:31:49.900
Uh, how has your week been?

01:31:49.900 --> 01:31:50.900
Jamie?

01:31:50.900 --> 01:31:54.220
Um, kill it with fire.

01:31:54.220 --> 01:31:55.220
Sorry to hear that.

01:31:55.220 --> 01:31:59.980
Um, shall we take a, shall we take a trip down memory lane with the classic console

01:31:59.980 --> 01:32:02.260
of the week?

01:32:02.260 --> 01:32:04.540
The classic console of the month.

01:32:04.540 --> 01:32:06.260
Oh, excuse me.

01:32:06.260 --> 01:32:07.940
The classic console of the month.

01:32:07.940 --> 01:32:09.780
What did, what did you pick for us?

01:32:09.780 --> 01:32:18.620
Uh, it's actually two, but they're related, uh, the FM towns and the FM towns, Marty.

01:32:18.620 --> 01:32:19.620
All right.

01:32:19.620 --> 01:32:21.180
The FM towns and the FM towns, Marty.

01:32:21.180 --> 01:32:22.180
Hold on.

01:32:22.180 --> 01:32:24.940
I'm getting, I'm getting a little bit of music up here for folks to hear.

01:32:24.940 --> 01:32:25.940
Sorry.

01:32:25.940 --> 01:32:28.180
Wasn't expecting you to be that loud.

01:32:28.180 --> 01:32:29.180
There we go.

01:32:29.180 --> 01:32:30.180
Okay.

01:32:30.180 --> 01:32:32.460
It sounds like writing to me.

01:32:32.460 --> 01:32:33.460
Sure is.

01:32:34.460 --> 01:32:43.580
Well, the FM town, um, was a computer that was put out by Sujitsu, um, between 1989 and

01:32:43.580 --> 01:32:45.580
1997.

01:32:45.580 --> 01:32:51.460
It was meant to be, um, a multimedia and PC, um, gaming machine.

01:32:51.460 --> 01:32:58.500
Um, in 1993, a gaming console came out called the Marty that was compatible with all the

01:32:58.500 --> 01:33:00.900
existing FM towns games.

01:33:01.340 --> 01:33:08.420
So the FM stands for Sujitsu Micro and towns, um, is likely coming from Charlestown to win

01:33:08.420 --> 01:33:13.340
the 1964 Nobel Prize in system because at the time, Sujitsu was naming all of their

01:33:13.340 --> 01:33:16.340
PC products after Nobel prize winners.

01:33:16.340 --> 01:33:26.780
So the computer itself, it was an eight bit computer and, um, it had a lot of, uh, parts

01:33:26.780 --> 01:33:27.780
supplied by NEC.

01:33:28.660 --> 01:33:34.540
Um, so you probably will see a lot of crossover for games between that and the PC engine.

01:33:34.540 --> 01:33:43.740
Um, this one also, one of the specifics with it is that it was really dedicated for, uh,

01:33:43.740 --> 01:33:48.020
gaming and graphics, uh, uh, applications.

01:33:48.020 --> 01:33:54.980
It ran on, um, windows three, three one and windows 95, and it had its own OS called town's

01:33:54.980 --> 01:33:58.100
OS that was based off of, uh, DOS.

01:33:58.100 --> 01:34:05.460
So, um, most of the games were, uh, written in assembly and C. So that gives you any kind

01:34:05.460 --> 01:34:10.260
of indicator for, you know, about where it was in comparison to the other things that

01:34:10.260 --> 01:34:12.180
were out at the time.

01:34:12.180 --> 01:34:19.780
But, um, it also, um, had a, uh, a CD ROM in 1990.

01:34:19.780 --> 01:34:24.100
So it was pretty, pretty much ahead of its time for the day.

01:34:24.100 --> 01:34:30.740
Um, as for, uh, the, the Marty, the Marty actually had different iterations of it.

01:34:30.740 --> 01:34:37.060
There was, uh, a version that, like I said, came out in 1993 and it was the first 32 bit

01:34:37.060 --> 01:34:41.620
home video game system had a built-in CD ROM and disk drive.

01:34:41.620 --> 01:34:46.420
Um, and it was meant to run, like I said, the games that were running on the, um, FM

01:34:46.420 --> 01:34:47.420
town's PC.

01:34:47.420 --> 01:34:55.340
There was also the FM town 42 in 1994, um, that was a little bit lower in cost and to

01:34:55.340 --> 01:34:58.860
play some of the other games that had a faster CPU in it.

01:34:58.860 --> 01:35:03.340
And another one that's interesting is the FM town, uh, car Marty that was built into

01:35:03.340 --> 01:35:07.340
cars had, um, a GPS in it.

01:35:07.340 --> 01:35:13.980
It had, um, uh, the GPS had this audio and video guidance and it could be detached from

01:35:13.980 --> 01:35:16.440
the car and played at home.

01:35:16.440 --> 01:35:22.400
So it was, it was pretty crazy for its time and it could run, um, its virtual resolution

01:35:22.400 --> 01:35:27.280
up as high as, uh, 1024 by 512 back in the day.

01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:34.320
So as far as games that came out, the systems have a ton of games, um, as you can hear in

01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:39.200
the background, you know, that's Raiden Densetsu, which is basically just Raiden, um, for anime

01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:44.760
fans, I had a bunch of the nineties anime games on it, like, uh, Sanzanai's, um, Dragon

01:35:44.760 --> 01:35:52.440
Half, um, it even included some of the fighting games like Asuka 120%, um, they had Bubble

01:35:52.440 --> 01:35:59.120
Bobble, uh, Chase HQ, uh, I'm trying to think if there's any more that we would have seen

01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:00.120
over here.

01:36:00.120 --> 01:36:04.000
Oh, Emerald Dragon, which I've actually covered before, um, for classic games, uh, God of

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:09.680
Gods and Set Special, which was Fatal Fury Special over here, um, all kinds of great

01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:10.680
games on there.

01:36:10.680 --> 01:36:18.160
And, uh, even I think the only, maybe the only, um, version of, uh, Traxton 2, so had

01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:24.520
Puyo Puyo, had all kinds of interesting games, uh, Ravenloft, Return to Zor, uh, a couple

01:36:24.520 --> 01:36:30.040
of the Logos board games, um, so yeah, it's a great system if you're trying to find one

01:36:30.040 --> 01:36:36.720
now, they're pretty pricey, but, um, I think that there are emulators out for it, um, and

01:36:36.720 --> 01:36:41.520
at the time these were pretty much the best versions of a lot of these things you could

01:36:41.520 --> 01:36:43.920
get at home if you had the system.

01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:48.000
And so that's your classic system is the FM Towns family.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.620
I have to admit, I have never played one, unfortunately.

01:36:50.620 --> 01:36:54.360
Is this something that exists in the gaming vault that I just have failed to see or is

01:36:54.360 --> 01:36:55.360
this-

01:36:55.360 --> 01:36:58.280
No, actually I'd love to have one, but I don't actually own one.

01:36:58.280 --> 01:36:59.280
Bummer.

01:36:59.520 --> 01:37:02.920
Alright, y'all, you know what to get Jamie for Hanukkah next year.

01:37:02.920 --> 01:37:11.640
Well, if I were to check eBay right now, let's see how much one of them costs so I can give

01:37:11.640 --> 01:37:16.320
you an idea of a couple, you know, how many thousands you're gonna pay for one.

01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:19.400
Yeah, Kuma JP in the chat says it's too expensive.

01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:20.880
I've never seen one of those.

01:37:20.880 --> 01:37:28.280
Uh, JD in chat says I heard about this console because Zach McCracken had a 256 color port.

01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:37.400
So right now, an FM Towns Marty boxed with image site coming with it is $700 right now.

01:37:37.400 --> 01:37:39.400
That's pretty pricey for an old ass computer.

01:37:39.400 --> 01:37:42.040
I found a broken one for $135.

01:37:42.040 --> 01:37:43.040
Oh yay.

01:37:43.040 --> 01:37:47.720
And I found one that comes with POPO for right around $500.

01:37:47.720 --> 01:37:50.560
So that's what you're looking at for the cost.

01:37:50.560 --> 01:37:51.560
Alright.

01:37:51.560 --> 01:37:56.480
Well, Jamie, anything else you want to share with the listeners here before we go to break?

01:37:56.480 --> 01:37:57.960
Um, resist.

01:37:58.640 --> 01:38:03.640
Alright, um, have a great week, feel better, and we'll see you hopefully back in studio

01:38:03.640 --> 01:38:04.640
in seven days.

01:38:04.640 --> 01:38:05.640
See you then.

01:38:05.640 --> 01:38:06.640
Alright, bye.

01:38:06.640 --> 01:38:07.640
Bye.

01:38:07.640 --> 01:38:12.840
There it is, your classic console of the month.

01:38:12.840 --> 01:38:15.720
With that, we're going to take a quick break, but don't go anywhere, we have plenty more

01:38:15.720 --> 01:38:16.720
show to come.

01:38:16.720 --> 01:38:21.640
We're going to talk a little bit when we come back about Super Mario Run, Pokemon Go, but

01:38:21.640 --> 01:38:26.480
not just, not just handheld stuff, we're also going to talk about Street Fighter.

01:38:26.520 --> 01:38:27.720
Is there a Street Fighter handheld?

01:38:27.720 --> 01:38:30.640
I hope not because it's probably not, well, I'm talking about besides like what they did

01:38:30.640 --> 01:38:32.640
on like the Game Boy and all that stuff.

01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:35.320
They had Street Fighter 4 3D that was on the 3DS.

01:38:35.320 --> 01:38:41.240
Yes, I was thinking mobile phone, but I feel like there is, and I'm sure that it sucks.

01:38:41.240 --> 01:38:46.800
I mean, if Capcom is going to put Mega Man on mobile, you better believe that Street

01:38:46.800 --> 01:38:49.420
Fighter is probably not about the mobile version of it.

01:38:49.420 --> 01:38:55.080
So anyway, we are going to take a break and come back with more show, including rapid

01:38:55.080 --> 01:38:56.080
fire news.

01:38:56.080 --> 01:39:01.880
Emails and your calls at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype, when we come back with more of Orange

01:39:01.880 --> 01:39:02.880
Lounge Radio.

01:39:09.680 --> 01:39:15.360
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight on the 22nd of January, 2017

01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:19.280
with episode number 673 of our show already in progress.

01:39:19.280 --> 01:39:22.560
If you're just joining us live, you missed a really fun part A, we were talking about

01:39:22.560 --> 01:39:26.520
the Switch a little bit, and our pal Matt Baum joined us to talk about playing with

01:39:26.520 --> 01:39:27.520
Pride.

01:39:27.520 --> 01:39:29.820
So if you missed the first half of the show, I guess you're just going to have to listen

01:39:29.820 --> 01:39:31.560
to it on the podcast.

01:39:31.560 --> 01:39:35.720
Sadly on the podcast feed though, you don't get to take music breaks with us, so you didn't

01:39:35.720 --> 01:39:38.640
get to hear some of the music from Ninja Gaiden that we were playing during the break here

01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:40.720
that we were doing live.

01:39:40.720 --> 01:39:45.360
And did you know, Loki, I can beat Ninja Gaiden one, two, and three straight through without

01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:48.640
losing a life?

01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:49.640
That's pretty awesome.

01:39:49.640 --> 01:39:53.360
Yeah, actually I was sharing some alternative facts with you just then, yes.

01:39:53.360 --> 01:39:59.160
Sorry, I was too busy and distracted looking at Bobby's little video they posted of him

01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:01.320
making snow angels out of confetti.

01:40:01.320 --> 01:40:05.520
Oh, with celebrating the teams going to the Super Bowl?

01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:06.520
You can imagine I was a bit distracted.

01:40:06.520 --> 01:40:07.520
No, that's fine, that's fine.

01:40:07.520 --> 01:40:11.440
I think he actually has been posting on his Twitter, like people have been photoshopping

01:40:11.440 --> 01:40:15.360
him in that video, but like with other people's faces, it's crazy, I think he's becoming a

01:40:15.360 --> 01:40:16.360
meme or something.

01:40:16.360 --> 01:40:21.360
I'm sure he will have lots to share on his own show next week.

01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:25.840
So even though I'm cracking jokes about Ninja Gaiden, I don't even think I could beat the

01:40:25.840 --> 01:40:27.300
first one when I was younger.

01:40:27.300 --> 01:40:31.680
But I feel like I was good at video games when I was younger, like I used to be able

01:40:31.680 --> 01:40:36.280
to beat stuff like Mega Man 2 that I go back and play now and it's like I keep dying over

01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:40.120
and over and I don't know if it's just like I've lost the muscle memory of the levels

01:40:40.120 --> 01:40:45.320
or whatever, but is there some like really hard to beat video game in your past, Loki,

01:40:45.320 --> 01:40:50.300
that you beat that you're like really proud of, like I beat this video game and I am an

01:40:50.300 --> 01:40:53.060
awesome gamer for doing so?

01:40:53.060 --> 01:40:54.060
Um...

01:40:54.060 --> 01:40:57.120
I don't know...

01:40:57.120 --> 01:41:02.800
I did finish VVVVVVVVVV, except for one of the things, which was a pain in the ass and

01:41:02.800 --> 01:41:07.800
I didn't want to do it anymore, but I got almost, I think I finished that.

01:41:07.800 --> 01:41:09.220
I beat Rygar.

01:41:09.220 --> 01:41:13.360
That's probably my biggest thing, because you know Rygar, you couldn't fucking save,

01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:15.360
or it had no password, right?

01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:16.840
The original Rygar on NES.

01:41:16.840 --> 01:41:19.280
So it was one of those things where I had to leave it on overnight so I could come back

01:41:19.280 --> 01:41:20.280
and play it later.

01:41:20.280 --> 01:41:23.480
And I did, to be fair, I had a little help, I used, I don't know if it was Nintendo Power

01:41:23.480 --> 01:41:24.480
or some other little guy.

01:41:24.480 --> 01:41:25.480
Game Genie!

01:41:25.480 --> 01:41:30.040
No, not that kind of cheating, like a guide, you know, this was obviously a day long before

01:41:30.040 --> 01:41:34.320
Game Facts, but what we had back then, I think it was like a Nintendo Power or something

01:41:34.320 --> 01:41:36.860
that had tips for getting through different levels.

01:41:36.860 --> 01:41:42.240
So yeah, I was able to beat Rygar and heaven forbid if I could play that game for anything

01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:43.240
now.

01:41:43.240 --> 01:41:49.320
So anyway, let's see, I'm trying to see if anybody was answering that question over in

01:41:49.320 --> 01:41:53.240
our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:55.760
Let's see, darktedsuya says, I was waiting for the punchline.

01:41:55.760 --> 01:41:59.400
That's in regards to the joke I made there a minute ago.

01:41:59.400 --> 01:42:04.680
Dungeon Buster says, a speedrunner called Arcus87 on Twitch regularly runs Ninja Gaiden

01:42:04.680 --> 01:42:06.240
around 12 minutes.

01:42:06.240 --> 01:42:08.560
His world record is 1142, I think.

01:42:08.560 --> 01:42:11.160
Wow, that's pretty, that's still pretty impressive.

01:42:11.160 --> 01:42:16.120
Speaking of world records, we should give a shout out to regular guest and OLR superfan

01:42:16.120 --> 01:42:22.040
Flaco Jones, who apparently has officially certified the fastest time in PT right now.

01:42:22.040 --> 01:42:23.560
But I thought he didn't have it recorded.

01:42:23.560 --> 01:42:28.400
No, he did, he got the Elgato thing, which I thought you gave it to him or Jamie gave

01:42:28.400 --> 01:42:29.400
it to him.

01:42:29.400 --> 01:42:33.400
Well, one way or another, probably passed through Shane or something, I don't know,

01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:39.120
but he got the Elgato and he has, like, it's been certified on the speedrun archive site

01:42:39.120 --> 01:42:40.120
or something like that.

01:42:40.120 --> 01:42:41.120
That's cool.

01:42:41.160 --> 01:42:45.920
And he keeps bidding to try to do one of the Game Stunt Quick marathons, so whenever they

01:42:45.920 --> 01:42:48.320
let PT in, we'll hopefully see him there.

01:42:48.320 --> 01:42:49.320
That'll be fun.

01:42:49.320 --> 01:42:50.320
Yeah.

01:42:50.320 --> 01:42:51.320
Cheer him on.

01:42:51.320 --> 01:42:52.320
Anyway.

01:42:52.320 --> 01:42:53.320
All right.

01:42:53.320 --> 01:42:58.920
Let's see, Rama says, Bart vs. Space Mutants could not beat it.

01:42:58.920 --> 01:43:01.480
Well then, if you couldn't beat it, that's not an accomplishment, is it?

01:43:01.480 --> 01:43:05.480
I remember a game, I'm just messing with you, I remember a game on Super Nintendo I played

01:43:05.480 --> 01:43:06.960
a lot of that was also very hard.

01:43:06.960 --> 01:43:09.840
It was Bart's Nightmare?

01:43:09.840 --> 01:43:11.680
Bart's Scary Nightmare or something about-

01:43:11.680 --> 01:43:12.680
Bart's Nightmare, yeah.

01:43:12.680 --> 01:43:13.680
Is that it?

01:43:13.680 --> 01:43:16.560
And it was, like, you would jump into a page and it was some other, like, mini-game or

01:43:16.560 --> 01:43:19.560
something, it was weird, weird-ass game.

01:43:19.560 --> 01:43:23.120
It's weird to think the Simpsons have been around that long, where there were Simpsons

01:43:23.120 --> 01:43:27.720
games on the Super Nintendo, yet the Simpsons is, like, still a thing that's on TV.

01:43:27.720 --> 01:43:29.160
Have we had Simpsons games lately?

01:43:29.160 --> 01:43:30.160
I guess it's on mobile.

01:43:30.160 --> 01:43:33.920
Yeah, no, they had a console game, remember EA put out that was actually supposed to be

01:43:33.920 --> 01:43:34.920
pretty good.

01:43:34.920 --> 01:43:38.000
I just remember that mobile game everybody's playing.

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:39.000
Well there's that one too.

01:43:39.480 --> 01:43:42.520
But, like, there was actually the console game, which was supposed to be pretty good,

01:43:42.520 --> 01:43:47.760
and they did a Family Guy game, which was, I don't know, Activision did that one, I don't

01:43:47.760 --> 01:43:48.760
know.

01:43:48.760 --> 01:43:52.640
Alright, let's do some rapid-fire news, travel around the gaming world and check out some

01:43:52.640 --> 01:43:54.320
news very quick.

01:43:54.320 --> 01:43:57.920
Loki, we'll have you do yours and you can do Jamie's as well, if you don't mind.

01:43:57.920 --> 01:44:02.240
But definitely nothing's gonna compete with the South Park game, which, I think the new

01:44:02.240 --> 01:44:03.240
one's coming out pretty soon.

01:44:03.240 --> 01:44:06.160
Yeah, I think it was supposed to be pretty soon, the Fractured But Whole.

01:44:06.160 --> 01:44:08.400
The Fractured But Whole, yeah.

01:44:08.400 --> 01:44:10.960
That is something I'm looking forward to.

01:44:10.960 --> 01:44:16.880
So Final Fantasy XV has been patched and now they've added some additional enhancements

01:44:16.880 --> 01:44:18.520
to the photographing.

01:44:18.520 --> 01:44:23.840
So now, not only will you get just the random photographs, but you can actually do your

01:44:23.840 --> 01:44:29.160
own photographs and set up, you know, custom pictures and stuff like that, so that's kind

01:44:29.160 --> 01:44:30.160
of cool.

01:44:30.160 --> 01:44:36.240
They also had some new packs, so they had a Holiday Pack Plus, which was the Moogle

01:44:36.240 --> 01:44:43.040
Chocobo Carnival that opened the Festival Ensemble costume for Noctis, and the Holiday

01:44:43.040 --> 01:44:49.760
Pack Plus exclusive photo frames, and then they had, you know, the free version as well,

01:44:49.760 --> 01:44:57.400
which just gave you the Moogle Chocobo Carnival and a Choco-Mog Tea for Noctis and a Holiday

01:44:57.400 --> 01:44:58.540
Pack thing.

01:44:58.540 --> 01:45:00.640
No word on the Gladio side story, though, huh?

01:45:00.640 --> 01:45:01.840
No, not yet.

01:45:01.840 --> 01:45:05.720
And then they also had a self-photographing feature that was something that was added

01:45:05.720 --> 01:45:10.080
that was what I was just talking about, but that was also one of the things that was made

01:45:10.080 --> 01:45:11.080
available there.

01:45:11.080 --> 01:45:12.880
I still have yet to go back and play through this.

01:45:12.880 --> 01:45:17.600
I am just not feeling compelled at all to play through Final Fantasy XV, which is really

01:45:17.600 --> 01:45:18.600
sad.

01:45:18.600 --> 01:45:19.600
It's worth it.

01:45:19.600 --> 01:45:20.600
Even less so than Final Fantasy...

01:45:20.600 --> 01:45:24.720
What if I had that last one that was Type Zero or whatever?

01:45:24.720 --> 01:45:25.720
Type Zero.

01:45:25.720 --> 01:45:28.880
I have no desire to play that.

01:45:28.880 --> 01:45:34.000
I think XV is worth playing through and you can get through it faster than almost any

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:35.520
other Final Fantasy game I can think of.

01:45:35.520 --> 01:45:39.560
I can't think of any Final Fantasy game that's probably shorter than XV, which I realize

01:45:39.560 --> 01:45:42.840
is good news and bad news.

01:45:42.840 --> 01:45:46.640
You can make XV a longer game with all the side quests and the other things there is

01:45:46.640 --> 01:45:48.820
to do and, of course, there's even more coming.

01:45:48.820 --> 01:45:52.040
But to get through the base game as it is now would probably take you less time than

01:45:52.040 --> 01:45:57.380
it would, oh God, like even Final Fantasy VI or V.

01:45:57.380 --> 01:45:58.640
Maybe IV is just as long.

01:45:58.640 --> 01:45:59.640
I can't remember.

01:45:59.640 --> 01:46:02.520
But then again, IV is always shorter.

01:46:02.520 --> 01:46:05.440
I think it's shorter than it really is because I always forget, like, oh yeah, you have the

01:46:05.440 --> 01:46:08.920
whole thing where you go underground and there's like half the game there.

01:46:08.920 --> 01:46:11.640
So yeah, I don't know.

01:46:11.640 --> 01:46:13.240
You should check it out at some point though, Loki.

01:46:13.240 --> 01:46:14.240
I guess.

01:46:14.240 --> 01:46:15.240
Anything else?

01:46:15.240 --> 01:46:23.880
Yeah, and then, of course, let's see, we had some more backwards compatible games, which

01:46:23.880 --> 01:46:24.880
is awesome.

01:46:24.880 --> 01:46:36.000
So, for Xbox One, you're going to have now Tekken 6 and also, what else was there, Mutant

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:42.200
Storm Empire and Midway Arcade Origins.

01:46:42.200 --> 01:46:44.040
So those are three games that are available now.

01:46:44.040 --> 01:46:49.820
Man, I have the Midway Treasures thing they released on original Xbox, but I don't have

01:46:49.820 --> 01:46:51.520
the one they did on 360.

01:46:51.520 --> 01:46:52.520
Boo.

01:46:52.520 --> 01:46:53.520
Yeah.

01:46:53.560 --> 01:46:59.400
And then, of course, there was a brief cameo from Overwatch.

01:46:59.400 --> 01:47:04.920
They had the bunny symbol from D.Va that showed up in one of the pictures from the Women's

01:47:04.920 --> 01:47:07.760
March that happened yesterday.

01:47:07.760 --> 01:47:12.000
And, you know, to be fair, there were a lot of, I don't know if you saw some of the clever

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:15.620
signs that were out there, but there were a lot of very clever done signs that were

01:47:15.620 --> 01:47:16.620
at the mark.

01:47:16.620 --> 01:47:20.780
God, there was, what, two million people out there yesterday, just tons and tons of people,

01:47:20.780 --> 01:47:22.980
and all with very, you know, sassy signs.

01:47:22.980 --> 01:47:27.220
And there was a lot of pop culture references in the signs, like, just lots.

01:47:27.220 --> 01:47:30.580
So it's pretty cool that, like, gaming is represented there as well, but, you know,

01:47:30.580 --> 01:47:36.220
the fact that this was also the Korea Women's March, you know, I hear D.Va's a very, very,

01:47:36.220 --> 01:47:40.980
very popular character over there, you know, because she is also the Korean representation

01:47:40.980 --> 01:47:45.860
in the game, but, yeah, pretty cool.

01:47:45.860 --> 01:47:46.860
Let's see.

01:47:46.860 --> 01:47:51.140
Also, speaking of Overwatch, there are some new skins coming to the game.

01:47:51.140 --> 01:47:54.720
The Year of the Rooster event is going to be coming to Overwatch.

01:47:54.720 --> 01:48:01.700
It starts on January 24th and maybe runs through the 31st, and nothing official has been confirmed

01:48:01.700 --> 01:48:06.020
as far as what the dates are that it will be running, but apparently some image leaked

01:48:06.020 --> 01:48:08.220
out of China, and that's where people are getting it from.

01:48:08.220 --> 01:48:13.660
Now, Blizzard teased some images of the Lunar New Year event, including some new skins for

01:48:13.660 --> 01:48:17.220
Mei and D.Va, that actually look really, really cool, I gotta say.

01:48:17.420 --> 01:48:22.580
Some of the images that leaked from this picture from China that was on Reddit, there's also

01:48:22.580 --> 01:48:27.780
going to be skins for Zenyatta, Winston, Roadhog, and Reinhardt, and who knows, maybe even more

01:48:27.780 --> 01:48:31.140
that aren't showing up on some of the publicity photos.

01:48:31.140 --> 01:48:37.180
A week seems pretty short for an Overwatch event, so I imagine those loot boxes, you're

01:48:37.180 --> 01:48:41.380
going to want to try to get those fast and furious, hopefully the Arcade mode will help

01:48:41.380 --> 01:48:45.700
you earn a few more, but if not, I'm sure Blizzard will be more than happy to take your

01:48:45.700 --> 01:48:51.620
money to open up more loot boxes where you might get one of these skins.

01:48:51.620 --> 01:48:53.980
So there you go.

01:48:53.980 --> 01:48:58.380
Check that out in Overwatch, starting in this next week.

01:48:58.380 --> 01:49:03.340
Metroid, of course, always forever in our hearts, even though Nintendo doesn't seem

01:49:03.340 --> 01:49:05.340
to do anything official for it.

01:49:05.340 --> 01:49:09.380
Even though Nintendo won't do anything official, that does not stop the fan community.

01:49:09.380 --> 01:49:13.400
That's right, there is yet another fan game that's been released.

01:49:13.400 --> 01:49:17.300
It's a prequel fan game called Metroid Rogue Dawn.

01:49:17.300 --> 01:49:22.040
It is set before Zero Mission, and it's a mission that is mentioned in the original

01:49:22.040 --> 01:49:26.680
Metroid game manual, and that's really all it is.

01:49:26.680 --> 01:49:29.040
So it's not a ROM hack or anything like that.

01:49:29.040 --> 01:49:33.900
It does use the original engine though, but apparently the team that created this rebuilt

01:49:33.900 --> 01:49:37.880
the assets and made original music for the game.

01:49:37.880 --> 01:49:39.520
So anyhow, that is out there now.

01:49:39.520 --> 01:49:45.000
You can check that out at ROMhacking.net, it's actually hosting the Metroid Rogue Dawn

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:46.000
ROM.

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:49.920
I'm sure it's just a matter of time until there is a cease and desist letter placed

01:49:49.920 --> 01:49:50.920
on this game.

01:49:50.920 --> 01:49:53.560
So is that actually like an NES ROM?

01:49:53.560 --> 01:49:54.560
I believe so.

01:49:54.560 --> 01:50:00.720
So that would be awesome to stick that kind of stuff onto the NES classic thing, those

01:50:00.720 --> 01:50:01.920
nice ROM hacks.

01:50:01.920 --> 01:50:06.440
Speaking of ROM hacks, one thing I forgot to mention is, this is kind of file this under

01:50:06.440 --> 01:50:09.200
that, well, because I can type thing.

01:50:09.200 --> 01:50:14.920
Somebody has made Bubsy a playable character in Streets of Rage 2.

01:50:14.920 --> 01:50:15.920
Why?

01:50:15.920 --> 01:50:17.920
Because they can.

01:50:17.920 --> 01:50:18.920
Because it's silly.

01:50:18.920 --> 01:50:23.520
Yes, that's right, so you can actually get that ROM as well.

01:50:23.520 --> 01:50:30.080
They have that available via ROMhacking.net, so go check that out.

01:50:30.080 --> 01:50:38.000
But yeah, he's got his own title animation and physics, and he's replacing Max Thunder.

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:39.640
I think it looks silly.

01:50:39.640 --> 01:50:40.640
Why not?

01:50:40.640 --> 01:50:42.760
I need to see this in motion, it sounds hilarious.

01:50:42.760 --> 01:50:43.760
It's pretty awesome.

01:50:43.760 --> 01:50:46.240
They've got a little animation from it.

01:50:46.240 --> 01:50:50.160
Alright, that's it for rapid fire news, so let's travel around the world and check out

01:50:50.160 --> 01:50:54.040
what's coming out in stores this week, starting with the US, Loki.

01:50:54.040 --> 01:50:57.720
Oh goodness, I'm totally unprepared.

01:50:57.720 --> 01:51:03.600
Let's see, well, I believe, isn't this the week for Resident Evil?

01:51:03.600 --> 01:51:04.960
I think you're right.

01:51:04.960 --> 01:51:10.480
Yeah, so Resident Evil 7 is going to be coming out on Xbox One and PlayStation 4.

01:51:10.480 --> 01:51:14.800
That would also include PlayStation VR as well.

01:51:14.800 --> 01:51:17.920
I don't think there's much else coming out here.

01:51:17.920 --> 01:51:18.920
Let's see.

01:51:18.920 --> 01:51:19.920
Open.

01:51:19.920 --> 01:51:20.920
Dammit.

01:51:20.920 --> 01:51:21.920
Okay.

01:51:21.920 --> 01:51:27.600
And then, what else do we have here, so...

01:51:27.600 --> 01:51:30.320
One second here.

01:51:30.320 --> 01:51:32.120
Links we get are for 2016.

01:51:32.120 --> 01:51:34.920
Uh oh, oh, we need to update that, sorry about that.

01:51:34.920 --> 01:51:40.280
Yeah, it just keeps it for like September 2016 or something like that.

01:51:40.280 --> 01:51:42.640
Okay, there we go.

01:51:42.640 --> 01:51:46.960
Other things that are going to be coming out as well.

01:51:46.960 --> 01:51:51.680
Let's see, we've got Tales of Berseria.

01:51:51.680 --> 01:51:54.440
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, I forgot there was another Tales game.

01:51:54.440 --> 01:52:01.600
That's going to be coming out on PC, PlayStation 4, Yakuza 0 on PlayStation 4, and then Memoranda

01:52:01.600 --> 01:52:08.920
on PC, Mac, and Linux, The Wardrobe on PC, Mac, and Linux, TwinStar Exorcist on Vita,

01:52:08.920 --> 01:52:16.720
Disgaea 2 is being ported to PC, and Double Dragon 4, that's coming out on PC and PlayStation

01:52:16.720 --> 01:52:17.720
4.

01:52:17.720 --> 01:52:18.720
Oh wow.

01:52:18.720 --> 01:52:25.120
Yep, Digimon World Next Order on PlayStation 4, Divide on PlayStation 4, Dynasty Warriors

01:52:25.120 --> 01:52:34.400
God Seekers on PlayStation 4 and Vita, and I believe that's it, let me just take a look

01:52:34.400 --> 01:52:37.040
at my calendar here.

01:52:37.040 --> 01:52:38.040
Just making sure.

01:52:38.040 --> 01:52:40.000
Um, yeah, that's it.

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:44.320
Alright, then let's travel over to Japan and check out some of the releases there.

01:52:44.320 --> 01:52:50.460
Biohazard 7, Resident Evil also gets its release in Japan this week, so it's kind of a worldwide

01:52:50.460 --> 01:52:53.260
release of sorts, that's out on the 26th of January.

01:52:53.300 --> 01:52:57.100
There's also some more games on the PlayStation 4, New Game, the Challenge Stage in regular

01:52:57.100 --> 01:53:03.660
and limited edition, Momotouji Taisen Oryoku 3 in regular and limited edition, and Oh no

01:53:03.660 --> 01:53:08.740
Katana no 4-Rhythm HD Edition in regular and limited edition.

01:53:08.740 --> 01:53:11.180
There's lots of limited editions in Japan.

01:53:11.180 --> 01:53:16.440
Also on the Vita, the Momotouji Taisen Oryoku 3 is also released on the Vita, as well as

01:53:16.440 --> 01:53:24.640
Shinsei Bateki Drive Girls, Black Wolves Saga Wiege und Schwarz is out there, throw a German

01:53:24.640 --> 01:53:28.920
name in the Japanese releases, that is also out in Japan this week on the Vita, and the

01:53:28.920 --> 01:53:32.040
New Game Challenge Stage there as well.

01:53:32.040 --> 01:53:37.920
One other game too, Uta no Prince Sama Repeat Love, you can get that in a regular love box

01:53:37.920 --> 01:53:42.120
or princess box, if you so desire.

01:53:42.120 --> 01:53:46.280
Checking out quickly the 3DS, nothing this week on the 3DS, I think things are slowing

01:53:46.280 --> 01:53:51.020
down on that system over there, so there's really not a lot else to mention in Japan.

01:53:51.020 --> 01:53:58.960
We could talk about the UK though, the UK has some releases coming out there, which,

01:53:58.960 --> 01:53:59.960
what do we have on the...

01:53:59.960 --> 01:54:02.480
Resident Evil and Sniper Ghost Warrior it looks like.

01:54:02.480 --> 01:54:03.480
Is that it?

01:54:03.480 --> 01:54:04.640
Yeah, that looks like it.

01:54:04.640 --> 01:54:10.840
Just Resident Evil and Sniper, Ghost Warrior, on the Vita this, or excuse me, in Europe

01:54:10.840 --> 01:54:15.880
this week, not on the Vita, but on the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

01:54:15.880 --> 01:54:20.320
It's about time to get to the mailbag, let's get to it.

01:54:20.320 --> 01:54:26.360
Every week you guys email us, participate at orangeloungeradio.com, and we open up the

01:54:26.360 --> 01:54:31.080
email bag, dive in, and pull out emails to read here on the show.

01:54:31.080 --> 01:54:35.800
Usually Dark Sakura would do this, but since she's not here, I will fill in tonight.

01:54:35.800 --> 01:54:40.280
So we're gonna start with this email from Asfer, who actually had sent this a couple

01:54:40.280 --> 01:54:45.120
weeks ago, but I think we lost it in the mix up with the mailbag last week, so oops, sorry

01:54:45.120 --> 01:54:47.880
about that, but we're gonna read it now.

01:54:47.880 --> 01:54:52.240
Who says, hello again, this email is in response to a question Rob asked me on the previous

01:54:52.240 --> 01:54:53.240
episode.

01:54:53.240 --> 01:54:57.360
He wanted to know which Final Fantasy came out when I was 12, as Bobby Blackwolf's statement

01:54:57.360 --> 01:55:01.360
is that a game typically will be a person's favorite Final Fantasy.

01:55:01.360 --> 01:55:06.080
To preface this, I mentioned that while I have fond feelings for 9, Final Fantasy X

01:55:06.080 --> 01:55:09.880
is my favorite, and one of my all-time favorite video games in general.

01:55:09.880 --> 01:55:15.080
So I'm 27 years old, my birthday is in October, so that means I would have been, well, shit.

01:55:15.080 --> 01:55:21.520
I was 12 at the time Final Fantasy X released on December 17th, 2001, damn it Bobby!

01:55:21.520 --> 01:55:24.020
Final Fantasy X was the first game I ever played in the series.

01:55:24.020 --> 01:55:27.760
I was introduced to it at a friend's house, and I was instantly captivated by the story,

01:55:27.760 --> 01:55:30.480
characters, and the conditional turn-based battle system.

01:55:30.480 --> 01:55:33.920
I remember after watching him play, I asked him to bring it over to my house on his next

01:55:33.920 --> 01:55:34.920
visit.

01:55:34.920 --> 01:55:37.000
That night, I stayed up past 7am playing this game.

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:40.360
I'd fallen in love with the world of Spira, and I couldn't wait to see what turns the

01:55:40.360 --> 01:55:44.120
story would take next, and how our characters would deal with a force as unstoppable as

01:55:44.160 --> 01:55:45.160
sin.

01:55:45.160 --> 01:55:48.200
Damn, just thinking about it, I really wish Final Fantasy would return to a turn-based

01:55:48.200 --> 01:55:49.200
battle system.

01:55:49.200 --> 01:55:53.380
I like the conditional system that showed the order of attacks in X as opposed to the

01:55:53.380 --> 01:55:57.920
active time battle system in 7, but even as that system was still very fun.

01:55:57.920 --> 01:55:59.480
That brings up my question for you.

01:55:59.480 --> 01:56:03.760
Do you like XV's approach on a more Kingdom Hearts-like battle system, or would you appreciate

01:56:03.760 --> 01:56:06.400
the next Final Fantasy be more of a return to form and be turn-based?

01:56:06.400 --> 01:56:11.260
Personally, while I enjoy XV, the battle system just doesn't feel like a Final Fantasy game

01:56:11.260 --> 01:56:12.260
to me anymore.

01:56:12.260 --> 01:56:13.480
Thanks for reading, Asfer.

01:56:14.120 --> 01:56:20.040
Well, keep in mind, you can put Final Fantasy XV's battle system in what's called Wait

01:56:20.040 --> 01:56:23.280
Mode, which does feel a little more traditional.

01:56:23.280 --> 01:56:25.180
I actually don't prefer it.

01:56:25.180 --> 01:56:29.960
I prefer the regular battle system that is not in Wait Mode.

01:56:29.960 --> 01:56:32.540
I do think the game feels fine like that.

01:56:32.540 --> 01:56:36.560
It is a little jarring, and I think when I first reviewed Final Fantasy XV on this show,

01:56:36.560 --> 01:56:41.740
I kind of called it out as, this feels more like a spin-off game, which is what it started

01:56:41.740 --> 01:56:44.560
out as, than it does a mainline Final Fantasy game.

01:56:44.560 --> 01:56:45.560
That's not necessarily bad.

01:56:45.560 --> 01:56:48.180
I mean, spin-off games can still be great games, right?

01:56:48.180 --> 01:56:49.180
10-2, right?

01:56:49.180 --> 01:56:51.180
It was pretty good, right?

01:56:51.180 --> 01:56:56.500
But the interesting thing about your question is that I do feel like the turn-based Final

01:56:56.500 --> 01:57:00.320
Fantasy thing is now relegated to the side games.

01:57:00.320 --> 01:57:02.940
Like the mobile games have a lot of the turn-based stuff.

01:57:02.940 --> 01:57:03.940
See, I like that.

01:57:03.940 --> 01:57:06.820
I don't, I mean, I like the old battle systems.

01:57:06.820 --> 01:57:07.820
I do too.

01:57:07.820 --> 01:57:10.500
I didn't think there was really anything wrong with them.

01:57:10.500 --> 01:57:14.660
Most people said that they got bored with them, and I mean, I don't know, it's just,

01:57:14.660 --> 01:57:18.260
this battle system would be good for like another type of game.

01:57:18.260 --> 01:57:19.260
Maybe not this.

01:57:19.260 --> 01:57:21.260
I just don't, I don't know.

01:57:21.260 --> 01:57:25.860
World of Final Fantasy, also a very recent side story game, also a turn-based battle

01:57:25.860 --> 01:57:27.140
system in that game.

01:57:27.140 --> 01:57:31.860
So I feel like if maybe that, and actually the whole like order of who goes when and

01:57:31.860 --> 01:57:33.740
all that, actually it's different.

01:57:33.740 --> 01:57:38.660
It uses a more like progressive time bar type thing, but I think you'd, as a 10 fan, you'd

01:57:38.660 --> 01:57:39.740
find it acceptable.

01:57:39.740 --> 01:57:41.620
That actually exists in World of Final Fantasy.

01:57:41.620 --> 01:57:45.940
So I might actually encourage you, check out World of Final Fantasy because that might

01:57:45.940 --> 01:57:47.300
be what you're looking for.

01:57:47.300 --> 01:57:50.220
There are some other weird limitations in World of Final Fantasy, obviously the whole

01:57:50.220 --> 01:57:54.480
like monster collecting and building the stacks, but you have to kind of build the right stacks

01:57:54.480 --> 01:57:55.540
to get the most effective stuff.

01:57:55.540 --> 01:57:57.180
I mean, there are some other complications of that.

01:57:57.180 --> 01:58:01.740
It's not just like a quote unquote simple Final Fantasy game, like 10 was to kind of

01:58:01.740 --> 01:58:02.740
just get into.

01:58:02.740 --> 01:58:07.300
But I even think I said this as well when I first reviewed 15, I would really love it

01:58:07.300 --> 01:58:14.500
if Final Fantasy 16 was a return to a 10 style game or a nine style game, something

01:58:14.500 --> 01:58:17.540
that's the more traditional Final Fantasy.

01:58:17.540 --> 01:58:22.740
It's almost like 15 they just tried too many different things and like...

01:58:22.740 --> 01:58:26.500
But in 1500 was what I was going to say was about 16, what I'd like to see.

01:58:26.500 --> 01:58:27.500
Yeah.

01:58:27.500 --> 01:58:30.580
It's just like, I don't know, it just seems like, Oh, Hey, let's add these photo mode

01:58:30.580 --> 01:58:31.580
in there and stuff.

01:58:31.580 --> 01:58:34.380
It's like, okay, that's kind of unnecessary.

01:58:34.380 --> 01:58:38.580
I mean, I know people like that kind of stuff, but it's kind of unnecessary.

01:58:38.580 --> 01:58:40.940
But here's the weird thing about all that.

01:58:40.940 --> 01:58:45.120
The newer Final Fantasy game in the retro setting with the pretty graphics and everything,

01:58:45.120 --> 01:58:47.260
that's actually Final Fantasy 14.

01:58:47.260 --> 01:58:52.380
And I think Final Fantasy 14 delivers on a lot of things that Final Fantasy fans will

01:58:52.380 --> 01:58:53.380
be into.

01:58:53.380 --> 01:58:56.540
But I completely understand a lot of people are turned off to it because it's MMO monthly

01:58:56.540 --> 01:58:57.540
fee.

01:58:57.540 --> 01:59:03.380
They're not interested, but I, you know, don't write off 14 because it's a fucking marvelous.

01:59:03.380 --> 01:59:08.220
I mean, when I was playing Final Fantasy 14 this week, I finally wrapped up the story

01:59:08.220 --> 01:59:14.700
for the last patch, the 3.4 patch, which was Soul Surrender, I think was the subtitle of

01:59:14.700 --> 01:59:15.700
that.

01:59:15.700 --> 01:59:16.700
Or is that the new patch?

01:59:16.700 --> 01:59:19.900
I can't remember my patch names anymore, but I wrapped up the storyline in that patch and

01:59:19.900 --> 01:59:22.100
it was so good.

01:59:22.100 --> 01:59:25.860
Like Oh my God, at the end of it, I was just like, wow, that was like the twist they kind

01:59:25.860 --> 01:59:29.000
of did with it was really good.

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.620
So yeah, I was really jazzed about it.

01:59:31.620 --> 01:59:35.780
And I kind of realized, you know, I've said this about Final Fantasy Heavensward, like

01:59:35.780 --> 01:59:40.780
the Final Fantasy Heavensward story before, so just the 3.0 story without getting into

01:59:40.780 --> 01:59:43.380
any of the patches or whatever.

01:59:43.380 --> 01:59:50.260
It is the best Final Fantasy story for me since like six, like it's so fucking good.

01:59:50.260 --> 01:59:54.620
And I know many Final Fantasy fans will never play it because again, it's an MMO.

01:59:54.620 --> 02:00:00.180
So I wish there was a way Square Enix could figure out a way to make 14.

02:00:00.180 --> 02:00:06.100
I mean, then I guess it wouldn't really be 14, like do a free version, do the base game

02:00:06.100 --> 02:00:11.220
for free or something and have just like NPCs you can play with or something.

02:00:11.220 --> 02:00:12.220
I don't know.

02:00:12.220 --> 02:00:14.380
I just, I really wish they'd figure a way to do that out.

02:00:14.380 --> 02:00:19.180
But yeah, I think 14 is really, really good if you're a Final Fantasy fan.

02:00:19.180 --> 02:00:21.800
The other thing I want to say with 14, which I thought was interesting, they did talk about,

02:00:21.800 --> 02:00:23.300
you know, they've got another expansion.

02:00:23.300 --> 02:00:24.940
So this is, they're ramping down.

02:00:24.940 --> 02:00:30.140
This is the last or the, they're doing a two-part patch to wrap up Heavensward, the last expansion,

02:00:30.140 --> 02:00:31.140
right?

02:00:31.140 --> 02:00:33.460
We got the first part and then the second part's coming, I think in March.

02:00:33.460 --> 02:00:36.820
And then in June, Stormblood, the new expansion is coming.

02:00:36.820 --> 02:00:41.660
But this is something interesting Final Fantasy is doing as opposed to World of Warcraft.

02:00:41.660 --> 02:00:48.040
Instead of bundling in Heavensward, the previous expansion with the base game, they're still

02:00:48.040 --> 02:00:52.100
going to continue to sell Realm Reborn, the base game, the way that it is, but they're

02:00:52.100 --> 02:00:55.580
bundling in Heavensward with Stormblood.

02:00:55.580 --> 02:00:59.820
So if you buy Stormblood, you're essentially, essentially buying all expansions to catch

02:00:59.820 --> 02:01:01.540
you up, which I think is interesting.

02:01:01.540 --> 02:01:03.220
So why would you just play the base game though?

02:01:03.220 --> 02:01:06.620
Well, I think the base game is there for people to try it out and see if they like it.

02:01:06.620 --> 02:01:10.460
I guess because it's so inexpensive, like on these sales, it's like down below 10 bucks.

02:01:10.460 --> 02:01:11.460
Oh yeah.

02:01:11.460 --> 02:01:12.460
I don't know.

02:01:12.460 --> 02:01:13.460
For sure.

02:01:13.460 --> 02:01:14.460
For sure.

02:01:14.460 --> 02:01:18.180
Anyway, that's my thoughts on Final Fantasy and all that stuff.

02:01:18.180 --> 02:01:23.500
I think, I think 15, it seems like it's done well enough where we will see a Final Fantasy

02:01:23.500 --> 02:01:25.900
16, but God, who knows when?

02:01:25.900 --> 02:01:29.020
I mean, we still got that seven remake to get through first, right?

02:01:29.020 --> 02:01:32.420
Do you think Square would be bold enough to do a Final Fantasy 16 trailer at this year's

02:01:32.420 --> 02:01:33.420
E3?

02:01:33.420 --> 02:01:34.420
No.

02:01:34.420 --> 02:01:35.420
I don't know.

02:01:35.420 --> 02:01:40.620
Anyway, next email is from Red the Haze who emails us and says, hey y'all, long time listener

02:01:40.620 --> 02:01:44.260
here for, oh my gosh, 10, maybe 11 years this year.

02:01:44.260 --> 02:01:45.260
Wow.

02:01:45.260 --> 02:01:46.260
That's some dedication.

02:01:46.260 --> 02:01:47.260
Thank you so much.

02:01:47.340 --> 02:01:48.340
I realized it now.

02:01:48.340 --> 02:01:53.540
Well, I just wanted to send an email to congratulate Sky and Alan on their union and I wanted to

02:01:53.540 --> 02:01:55.140
thank you very much for that.

02:01:55.140 --> 02:01:59.380
And I wanted to thank Sky, Dark Sakura, Loki, and everyone involved, including guests and

02:01:59.380 --> 02:02:04.900
the audience for the decade of great entertainment, more power to y'all and best wishes.

02:02:04.900 --> 02:02:05.900
Thank you so much.

02:02:05.900 --> 02:02:06.900
Red the Haze.

02:02:06.900 --> 02:02:07.900
Well, thank you.

02:02:07.900 --> 02:02:08.900
Thank you for that email.

02:02:08.900 --> 02:02:09.900
Not even a question or anything.

02:02:09.900 --> 02:02:11.540
Just a positive pat on the ass.

02:02:11.540 --> 02:02:12.540
Thank you.

02:02:12.540 --> 02:02:13.540
I appreciate that.

02:02:13.540 --> 02:02:15.340
Thank you for the well wishes on the wedding.

02:02:15.340 --> 02:02:17.020
I really, really appreciate that.

02:02:17.780 --> 02:02:22.580
One more email tonight from, uh, our good old friend, Raginator.

02:02:22.580 --> 02:02:27.260
Hi, Robin, Loki, who, who, who knew that Dark Sakura wasn't here tonight.

02:02:27.260 --> 02:02:29.940
So he must've wrote this through the first part of the show.

02:02:29.940 --> 02:02:33.780
Uh, anyway, I'd like to bring up a new question to your, to you folks.

02:02:33.780 --> 02:02:37.260
I'm sure that the two of you, as well as most of the listeners know of at least one or two

02:02:37.260 --> 02:02:40.820
people in their lives that is more or less anti video games.

02:02:40.820 --> 02:02:44.140
They themselves refuse to play them and won't let their kids play them.

02:02:44.140 --> 02:02:47.900
It may be part due to the stereotype that nerds play games and they immediately go to

02:02:47.900 --> 02:02:52.420
the Revenge of the Nerds portrayal of nerds, or they possibly want to focus solely on psychic

02:02:52.420 --> 02:02:55.300
activity or excuse me, physical activity.

02:02:55.300 --> 02:02:59.540
Even if it only amounts to spinning in circles, literally all that being said, what would

02:02:59.540 --> 02:03:01.740
you say to those notions?

02:03:01.740 --> 02:03:04.060
And Raginator continues here and we'll answer the questions.

02:03:04.060 --> 02:03:06.860
For me, I'll say this I'm all for physical activity.

02:03:06.860 --> 02:03:09.740
God only knows I used to be on my high school's wrestling and football teams.

02:03:09.740 --> 02:03:11.820
Granted, I sucked at sports, but I digress.

02:03:11.820 --> 02:03:15.460
No one in their right mind will detract from physical exercise, but mental exercise is

02:03:15.460 --> 02:03:18.020
equally important and video games provide that.

02:03:18.020 --> 02:03:21.800
Perhaps this is an oversimplification, but video games help develop reasoning skills

02:03:21.800 --> 02:03:23.300
amongst other things.

02:03:23.300 --> 02:03:27.780
Essentially all games say to the player, this is the scenario, this is your goal, and this

02:03:27.780 --> 02:03:30.700
is the tools or mechanics at your disposal, go.

02:03:30.700 --> 02:03:35.420
It's been shown that keeping mentally active will help stave off dementia and other issues.

02:03:35.420 --> 02:03:39.380
Also on a more personal note, I found that gaming helps dramatically with my PTSD and

02:03:39.380 --> 02:03:43.660
major depressive disorder, keeping my symptoms 97% or so at bay.

02:03:43.660 --> 02:03:47.620
In terms of the stereotype, I'm not exactly sure what to say about that though.

02:03:47.620 --> 02:03:49.820
And that is from Raginator.

02:03:49.820 --> 02:03:54.340
So what do you think of the notions that video games, just somebody in your life hates them?

02:03:54.340 --> 02:03:55.340
Oh, that would be your wife.

02:03:55.340 --> 02:03:59.420
That would be my wife, except that she likes certain video games.

02:03:59.420 --> 02:04:02.420
So that's not totally true, not totally true.

02:04:02.420 --> 02:04:07.240
But yeah, I mean, she didn't want our kids playing video games a lot and then the kids

02:04:07.240 --> 02:04:11.040
started annoying the shit out of her and now she's just like, just go do something

02:04:11.040 --> 02:04:12.040
else.

02:04:12.040 --> 02:04:13.640
I don't care what you're doing, which includes video games.

02:04:13.640 --> 02:04:17.400
Well, here's the thing, Raginator, if I'm not mistaken, based on your calls to the show

02:04:17.400 --> 02:04:20.720
previously, I believe you're in your thirties and you're kind of close to our age.

02:04:20.720 --> 02:04:23.880
And I think the answer to this question has shifted a lot.

02:04:23.880 --> 02:04:27.540
I think when we were growing up, you know, when we were around the Nintendo and the Super

02:04:27.540 --> 02:04:32.760
Nintendo and all that stuff, I think our parents didn't have that growing up.

02:04:32.760 --> 02:04:39.680
So it was something weird and unknown and they only knew what they saw about it on TV

02:04:39.680 --> 02:04:41.680
or whatever.

02:04:41.680 --> 02:04:46.040
Especially in the nineties when Mortal Kombat happened and the whole violent video games

02:04:46.040 --> 02:04:51.380
that even went before Congress at one point and that ultimately developed in the rating

02:04:51.380 --> 02:04:55.420
system that we have for video games today because the video game industry had the police

02:04:55.420 --> 02:04:58.320
itself before the government did it for them, right?

02:04:58.320 --> 02:05:00.560
So all that stuff was crazy in the media.

02:05:00.560 --> 02:05:05.120
And so I think for that reason, video games got a certain like stereotype or stigma.

02:05:05.120 --> 02:05:09.280
But Raginator, I really think things are kind of different now because a lot of the people

02:05:09.280 --> 02:05:15.340
that have kids that are, you know, nine years old, 12 years old, whatever, they grew up

02:05:15.340 --> 02:05:16.640
with video games.

02:05:16.640 --> 02:05:18.140
So I mean, like, look at Loki.

02:05:18.140 --> 02:05:19.560
He's a parent.

02:05:19.560 --> 02:05:24.560
Loki grew up with video games and you have, I can never remember Josh's age, five, six,

02:05:24.560 --> 02:05:26.240
five, six years old.

02:05:26.240 --> 02:05:29.040
But Josh is able to play a healthy amount of Minecraft, right?

02:05:29.720 --> 02:05:31.440
He plays an unhealthy amount of Minecraft.

02:05:31.440 --> 02:05:32.440
It's more like watches.

02:05:32.440 --> 02:05:38.200
He will watch videos as long as we'll let him watch videos and like anytime that there's

02:05:38.200 --> 02:05:43.160
screens on, he'll just like kind of gravitate towards them like anything.

02:05:43.160 --> 02:05:44.640
But you and, that sounds like me as a kid.

02:05:44.640 --> 02:05:47.920
And he won't shut up about Minecraft like all the time.

02:05:47.920 --> 02:05:52.520
You and Nelly, that's as parents, you guys police that what games he should play and

02:05:52.520 --> 02:05:54.600
how long he gets to play them and all that stuff.

02:05:54.600 --> 02:05:59.480
But you have the benefit of knowing basic stuff about video games that you kind of know

02:05:59.480 --> 02:06:00.820
like the ins and outs, right?

02:06:00.820 --> 02:06:01.820
You know that it's not going to...

02:06:01.820 --> 02:06:06.280
He still watches YouTubers and YouTubers tend to swear and then they play like violent video

02:06:06.280 --> 02:06:07.280
games on there and stuff.

02:06:07.280 --> 02:06:09.840
I was gonna say, do you let your kid play violent games?

02:06:09.840 --> 02:06:12.840
Uh, you know, he doesn't only, he only plays Minecraft.

02:06:12.840 --> 02:06:15.160
He only has the Wii U that he plays on.

02:06:15.160 --> 02:06:18.000
So it's basically Minecraft.

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.360
That's really all he plays on is just Minecraft.

02:06:20.360 --> 02:06:23.720
And then, he had Mario Kart 8 on there.

02:06:23.720 --> 02:06:25.520
He will play Mario Kart 8 sometimes.

02:06:25.520 --> 02:06:27.160
He hasn't really played it in a while.

02:06:27.160 --> 02:06:28.700
And Smash is on there.

02:06:28.700 --> 02:06:31.700
So he'll play Smash.

02:06:31.700 --> 02:06:33.240
But he's not really interested in that.

02:06:33.240 --> 02:06:34.240
It's mostly Minecraft.

02:06:34.240 --> 02:06:40.240
And then he watches Minecraft mod videos from either PopularMMOs or DanTDM.

02:06:40.240 --> 02:06:41.680
That's his favorite YouTubers.

02:06:41.680 --> 02:06:44.960
But anyway, it's one of those things where it's like, again, I think the public perception

02:06:44.960 --> 02:06:45.960
has shifted a lot.

02:06:45.960 --> 02:06:49.680
And the people that are still anti-video games are the people that are our parents' age.

02:06:49.680 --> 02:06:50.680
You know, boomers.

02:06:50.680 --> 02:06:52.520
You know, people in their, you know, depending on-

02:06:52.520 --> 02:06:53.520
Which is weird.

02:06:53.520 --> 02:06:55.600
Like, my dad's like so anti-video games.

02:06:55.600 --> 02:06:59.920
Yeah, he had like a fucking collection of ColecoVision games, like 47 games.

02:06:59.920 --> 02:07:02.120
But like, he bought me like a Nintendo.

02:07:02.120 --> 02:07:03.760
He bought me a Texas Ocean's Things.

02:07:03.760 --> 02:07:06.200
I'm like, you are a fucking gamer.

02:07:06.200 --> 02:07:08.200
You have 47 fucking games.

02:07:08.200 --> 02:07:10.500
That is, that's more than just a few.

02:07:10.500 --> 02:07:13.120
There's just generational differences.

02:07:13.120 --> 02:07:17.760
And that's why we have these silly labels like boomers, like Gen X, like millennials

02:07:17.760 --> 02:07:18.760
and all this stuff.

02:07:18.760 --> 02:07:21.920
Because there are just things in society that change generation to generation.

02:07:21.920 --> 02:07:27.560
I mean, look back at some of the stuff that was cool when your parents were younger.

02:07:27.560 --> 02:07:32.880
Like they used to think sitting on flag poles was cool and swallowing goldfish whole, right?

02:07:32.880 --> 02:07:33.960
Pet rocks.

02:07:33.960 --> 02:07:36.520
Can anyone ever explain the pet rock thing to me?

02:07:36.520 --> 02:07:39.800
That's just, you know, but then at the same time, you look at what some of the kids today

02:07:39.800 --> 02:07:42.960
are doing and it's like, you know, now I'm starting to feel like that old man, like,

02:07:42.960 --> 02:07:45.960
you know, like, who thinks planking is funny?

02:07:45.960 --> 02:07:46.960
It's just-

02:07:46.960 --> 02:07:47.960
It's not funny anymore.

02:07:47.960 --> 02:07:48.960
Exactly.

02:07:48.960 --> 02:07:49.960
It's a fad.

02:07:49.960 --> 02:07:50.960
There's just, yeah, exactly.

02:07:50.960 --> 02:07:51.960
There's certain trends or whatever.

02:07:51.960 --> 02:07:55.440
But the one other thing I want to point to is look at the sales of the classic NES and

02:07:55.440 --> 02:07:59.360
how Nintendo like grossly underestimated how many that was going to sell.

02:07:59.360 --> 02:08:03.360
If you want to believe that line, I'll leave that to you.

02:08:03.360 --> 02:08:08.920
They really underestimated how many moms and dads wanted these, not just for themselves,

02:08:08.920 --> 02:08:12.760
but to play with their kids, to introduce their kids to the same games that they were

02:08:12.760 --> 02:08:13.760
playing.

02:08:13.760 --> 02:08:17.760
A lot of kids, even though the technology's dated or whatever, a lot of kids are really

02:08:17.760 --> 02:08:18.760
eating this classic stuff up.

02:08:18.760 --> 02:08:22.440
Yeah, my kids always call anything that they see that's 8-bit Minecraft.

02:08:22.440 --> 02:08:24.360
They're all, that game looks like Minecraft.

02:08:24.360 --> 02:08:29.200
I'm like, no, that's just how games used to look.

02:08:29.200 --> 02:08:32.520
And Rage Leader says in our chat room, he's there in the chat room clarifying, the thing

02:08:32.520 --> 02:08:36.040
is, I know people within our own age group that are anti-video games, not just the baby

02:08:36.040 --> 02:08:37.160
boomer generation.

02:08:37.160 --> 02:08:38.160
And that's fair.

02:08:38.160 --> 02:08:43.280
You know, people are just going to- people are going to be raised the way they were raised

02:08:43.280 --> 02:08:44.280
sometimes.

02:08:44.280 --> 02:08:46.960
So there's probably going to be people that still carry that.

02:08:46.960 --> 02:08:50.800
Sorry, my wife thinks I look weird with a VR headset on, and eventually that's going

02:08:50.800 --> 02:08:52.000
to be a norm.

02:08:52.000 --> 02:09:00.220
In my opinion, though, if you watch movies, if you play Dungeons and Dragons, although

02:09:00.220 --> 02:09:04.600
I suppose that gets a lot of negative stigma sometimes as well, but if you do all that,

02:09:04.600 --> 02:09:06.360
why can't you play video games?

02:09:06.360 --> 02:09:09.720
Video games are not that different from movies to me.

02:09:09.720 --> 02:09:10.720
So anyway.

02:09:10.720 --> 02:09:11.720
All right.

02:09:11.720 --> 02:09:12.720
Let's see.

02:09:12.720 --> 02:09:19.880
I'm going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com and let's see.

02:09:19.880 --> 02:09:20.880
Where is it?

02:09:20.880 --> 02:09:23.720
Kaijuta says new pet rock is that hatchling thing.

02:09:23.720 --> 02:09:24.720
I don't even know.

02:09:24.720 --> 02:09:25.720
What's a hatchling thing?

02:09:25.720 --> 02:09:28.800
Isn't that that popular present or whatever it is?

02:09:28.800 --> 02:09:29.800
I don't know.

02:09:29.800 --> 02:09:30.800
It sounds stupid.

02:09:30.800 --> 02:09:31.800
It sounds like a new pet.

02:09:31.800 --> 02:09:35.800
It was a Christmas present or something, right?

02:09:35.800 --> 02:09:36.800
Yeah.

02:09:36.800 --> 02:09:40.520
It was a must have thing that other than the classic NES was the hatchling or whatever.

02:09:40.520 --> 02:09:43.520
Isn't that just like that candy that's banned here in America?

02:09:43.520 --> 02:09:44.520
That's in other countries.

02:09:44.520 --> 02:09:45.520
Poor Loco.

02:09:45.520 --> 02:09:46.520
No, no, no, no.

02:09:46.520 --> 02:09:47.520
Come on.

02:09:47.520 --> 02:09:48.520
I'm talking about...

02:09:48.520 --> 02:09:49.520
Kinder eggs.

02:09:49.520 --> 02:09:50.520
What's the name of that Alan?

02:09:50.520 --> 02:09:51.520
Kinder eggs.

02:09:51.520 --> 02:09:52.520
Thank you, Alan.

02:09:52.520 --> 02:09:53.520
Alan knew the name of it.

02:09:53.520 --> 02:09:54.520
Kinder egg.

02:09:54.520 --> 02:09:55.520
You could like, it was like a chocolate or something.

02:09:55.520 --> 02:09:57.720
There's like a prize in the middle and they were afraid that kids here would choke on

02:09:57.720 --> 02:09:58.720
it.

02:09:58.720 --> 02:10:00.920
Well, these are, yeah.

02:10:00.920 --> 02:10:01.920
All right.

02:10:01.920 --> 02:10:02.920
Thank you.

02:10:02.920 --> 02:10:03.920
Wow.

02:10:03.920 --> 02:10:04.920
Chat room knows their shit.

02:10:04.920 --> 02:10:05.920
Kinder eggs.

02:10:06.040 --> 02:10:08.040
And that's it for emails.

02:10:08.040 --> 02:10:14.920
If you guys want to send us an email for a future week, participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

02:10:14.920 --> 02:10:19.480
But meanwhile, we have some more news to get into, starting with Loki.

02:10:19.480 --> 02:10:24.200
So Super Mario Brothers Run, I know it's coming to Android soon because they have that stupid

02:10:24.200 --> 02:10:29.640
pre-order thing or pre-register, pre-notifier, whatever the fuck it is.

02:10:29.640 --> 02:10:34.280
Some stupid equivalent of pre-ordering for a mobile device, which doesn't make any goddamn

02:10:34.280 --> 02:10:35.280
sense.

02:10:35.640 --> 02:10:42.360
Nintendo announced that Super Mario Run will be coming out in March on Android and you

02:10:42.360 --> 02:10:46.720
can, like I said, you can register for updates regarding that on Google Play Store.

02:10:46.720 --> 02:10:49.360
I will never do that because I don't fucking care.

02:10:49.360 --> 02:10:50.800
Like, it's not going to do it.

02:10:50.800 --> 02:10:53.080
If you have a Twitter account, you'll know when the game's out.

02:10:53.080 --> 02:10:54.080
Exactly.

02:10:54.080 --> 02:10:55.080
Who cares?

02:10:55.080 --> 02:11:00.440
Just, you'll know when it's supposed to come out and you'll check it out if you want to.

02:11:00.440 --> 02:11:03.240
I may check out the free version of the game or not.

02:11:03.240 --> 02:11:04.240
I really don't.

02:11:05.200 --> 02:11:07.200
It's not something that looks interesting to me.

02:11:07.200 --> 02:11:11.840
I, you know, again, the $10 I spent on Super Mario Run, I kind of regret.

02:11:11.840 --> 02:11:12.840
I'm just saying.

02:11:12.840 --> 02:11:16.360
So, you know, and I, there's some people out there that strongly disagree with me and that's

02:11:16.360 --> 02:11:18.040
fine.

02:11:18.040 --> 02:11:19.440
That's just my personal opinion.

02:11:19.440 --> 02:11:21.040
All right.

02:11:21.040 --> 02:11:27.040
Well, let's talk about Pokemon Go and then maybe, Loki, you want to pick up our story.

02:11:27.040 --> 02:11:29.960
So Pokemon Go, still going strong.

02:11:29.960 --> 02:11:32.160
I just hit level 26 of Pokemon Go not that long ago.

02:11:32.160 --> 02:11:33.960
I haven't really been playing it that much.

02:11:34.680 --> 02:11:35.680
Very little.

02:11:35.680 --> 02:11:39.560
I've been trying to do more walking, especially on, like, my lunch breaks and I love that

02:11:39.560 --> 02:11:41.640
little Pokemon Go Plus.

02:11:41.640 --> 02:11:43.880
It really is incentive because I try to hatch eggs.

02:11:43.880 --> 02:11:47.800
Are those easier to find nowadays or are they still, like, super hard to find?

02:11:47.800 --> 02:11:50.840
I don't think they are easy to find still.

02:11:50.840 --> 02:11:52.320
Because that's a Nintendo product.

02:11:52.320 --> 02:11:53.960
Go fig that it's hard to find.

02:11:53.960 --> 02:11:58.960
Yeah, because they can never estimate, you know, possible consumer wants.

02:11:58.960 --> 02:12:03.280
Well, Pokemon Go, you know, despite all the stories that say it's dead or whatever, it

02:12:03.280 --> 02:12:04.600
made a shit ton of money.

02:12:04.600 --> 02:12:11.560
I mean, the research firm App Annie has estimated that for 2006, Pokemon Go made a shit ton

02:12:11.560 --> 02:12:12.560
of money.

02:12:12.560 --> 02:12:13.800
That's actually published on the site.

02:12:13.800 --> 02:12:14.800
Shit ton.

02:12:14.800 --> 02:12:15.800
No, it isn't.

02:12:15.800 --> 02:12:16.800
It says 950 million.

02:12:16.800 --> 02:12:17.800
But that is a shit ton of money.

02:12:17.800 --> 02:12:19.280
That's almost a billion dollars.

02:12:19.280 --> 02:12:24.780
So, and that's, see, that's the one downside to the fact that I do walk is that I always

02:12:24.780 --> 02:12:30.440
need those fucking incubators and so I keep spending money on incubators and I have had

02:12:30.440 --> 02:12:31.920
to, like, tell myself to stop.

02:12:31.920 --> 02:12:34.560
And, like, I finally got smart.

02:12:34.560 --> 02:12:40.460
I use my infinite incubator for all my 2K eggs because you can hatch more that way.

02:12:40.460 --> 02:12:45.840
And I will only use the pay ones for the 10K and sometimes the 5K just depending on what's

02:12:45.840 --> 02:12:46.840
in my inventory.

02:12:46.840 --> 02:12:47.900
So I have to buy less of them.

02:12:47.900 --> 02:12:52.520
But I never use a pay incubator anymore for 2K because I just, I walk too much for it.

02:12:52.520 --> 02:13:00.540
So anyway, so yeah, that is only behind Monster Strike and Clash Royale for how much money

02:13:00.540 --> 02:13:01.540
it made.

02:13:01.580 --> 02:13:03.500
It launched in July.

02:13:03.500 --> 02:13:10.380
So there is a Pokemon Go update that came out recently that also fixes GPS drift apparently.

02:13:10.380 --> 02:13:14.140
I haven't really noticed the change that much but I didn't really have a horrible problem

02:13:14.140 --> 02:13:15.900
with this to begin with.

02:13:15.900 --> 02:13:19.220
So yeah, the GPS drift apparently was fixed in this most recent patch.

02:13:19.220 --> 02:13:22.020
Don't be nice if they fix that shit in Ingress.

02:13:22.020 --> 02:13:25.940
You can also, apparently it will show eggs that have been collected from PokeStops on

02:13:25.940 --> 02:13:28.900
the Apple Watch and some minor text fixes.

02:13:28.940 --> 02:13:32.020
But no word yet on Gen 2 unfortunately.

02:13:32.020 --> 02:13:33.980
We still don't have anything outside the eggs hatching.

02:13:33.980 --> 02:13:40.860
But I finally got my last Pokemon from Gen 2, Magmar was the last one I needed.

02:13:40.860 --> 02:13:43.280
And I got it this week, yay!

02:13:43.280 --> 02:13:49.100
So now I have all the Gen, I even evolved all the, I got like 3 Togepies out of eggs

02:13:49.100 --> 02:13:52.500
and I evolved it into a Togek or whatever it's called.

02:13:52.500 --> 02:13:55.740
So I have like all the Gen 2 you can get in the game right now.

02:13:55.740 --> 02:13:57.220
I still don't even have all the Gen 1.

02:13:57.660 --> 02:13:59.020
Need to find some more farms.

02:14:00.020 --> 02:14:02.460
Anyhow, what else Loki?

02:14:02.460 --> 02:14:08.540
So Capcom is planning on more Street Fighter.

02:14:08.540 --> 02:14:09.700
So they're going to have some more announcements.

02:14:09.700 --> 02:14:15.200
They're going to be coming out around E3 and San Diego Comic Con.

02:14:15.200 --> 02:14:18.220
No words exactly on what it's going to be.

02:14:18.220 --> 02:14:21.820
But more updates for Street Fighter 5 or something.

02:14:21.820 --> 02:14:26.940
One thing that he said though, unfortunately Rival Schools, there's no plans for anything

02:14:26.940 --> 02:14:27.940
regarding that.

02:14:27.940 --> 02:14:32.100
I guess they said despite some Easter eggs that were in Dead Rising 4, there's a game

02:14:32.100 --> 02:14:36.420
I haven't played in a while, Dead Rising.

02:14:36.420 --> 02:14:38.020
So I guess we'll have to wait and see.

02:14:38.020 --> 02:14:43.100
I know that they have the Street Fighter 2 game, Ultra Street Fighter 2, the final challengers

02:14:43.100 --> 02:14:44.220
that's supposed to be coming out.

02:14:44.220 --> 02:14:48.580
Maybe part of that, maybe they're going to put in, because I know Evil Ryu I think is

02:14:48.580 --> 02:14:54.020
probably in Street Fighter 5 already, but maybe like Violent Ken.

02:14:54.820 --> 02:14:58.980
I wish there was a little something else, like maybe one more character in Ultra Street

02:14:58.980 --> 02:15:03.700
Fighter 2 that wasn't just a reskin, but I also maybe understand the fact that Street

02:15:03.700 --> 02:15:09.300
Fighter 2 was kind of done a long time ago, so maybe they don't want to throw off that

02:15:09.300 --> 02:15:16.740
whole balance by introducing another new character into a game that's literally 20 years old

02:15:16.740 --> 02:15:17.740
at this point.

02:15:17.740 --> 02:15:18.740
I guess.

02:15:18.740 --> 02:15:19.740
I don't know.

02:15:19.740 --> 02:15:20.740
Whatever.

02:15:20.740 --> 02:15:21.740
Stop remaking it then.

02:15:21.740 --> 02:15:24.500
If you want to do that, then make a new game.

02:15:24.500 --> 02:15:27.220
I just, I don't know.

02:15:27.220 --> 02:15:28.220
Lame.

02:15:28.220 --> 02:15:34.540
Alright, so apparently the next Game Developers Conference, we know that Tim Sweeney is going

02:15:34.540 --> 02:15:38.380
to receive a lifetime achievement award, which is pretty awesome.

02:15:38.380 --> 02:15:43.460
Tim Sweeney of course, founder of Epic Games, created ZZT.

02:15:43.460 --> 02:15:44.460
Yeah?

02:15:44.460 --> 02:15:45.460
Yes!

02:15:45.460 --> 02:15:46.460
ZZT?

02:15:46.460 --> 02:15:49.060
There's a game that I'd love to see it come back.

02:15:49.060 --> 02:15:52.660
Some new ZZT.

02:15:52.660 --> 02:15:53.660
And no other games.

02:15:53.660 --> 02:16:01.380
Of course he helped develop Unreal, Gears of War, Unreal Engine, and I guess the Game

02:16:01.380 --> 02:16:07.580
Developers Choice Awards will be on Wednesday, March 1st from 6.30 to 8.30 Pacific Standard

02:16:07.580 --> 02:16:08.900
Time.

02:16:08.900 --> 02:16:12.100
So that's pretty awesome.

02:16:12.100 --> 02:16:13.100
He deserves it.

02:16:13.100 --> 02:16:14.100
ZZT is awesome.

02:16:14.100 --> 02:16:16.140
Will you be able to watch that online?

02:16:16.140 --> 02:16:17.140
You said?

02:16:17.140 --> 02:16:18.140
I think you should be able to, yeah.

02:16:19.140 --> 02:16:25.100
I, you know, I sometimes forget to make that connection that it's the same guy who made

02:16:25.100 --> 02:16:30.500
ZZT who also has a hand in all these newer games, so definitely a lifetime of accomplishments

02:16:30.500 --> 02:16:35.140
in the game industry, so a well-deserved award, in my opinion.

02:16:35.140 --> 02:16:37.420
And again, I can't say enough good things about ZZT.

02:16:37.420 --> 02:16:40.940
I wish it would make a comeback as well, but I guess it would be hard in this day and age.

02:16:40.940 --> 02:16:42.660
That'd be a great game on the Switch.

02:16:42.660 --> 02:16:43.660
Ha ha ha ha.

02:16:43.660 --> 02:16:45.540
Yeah, I think it would be.

02:16:45.940 --> 02:16:50.540
All right, well, lastly tonight, before we get to the Skype line and your calls at Orange.

02:16:50.540 --> 02:16:53.380
It'd be awesome, actually, to totally interrupt you here.

02:16:53.380 --> 02:16:54.380
Sure.

02:16:54.380 --> 02:16:59.140
ZZT on Steam with Steam Workshop support for levels.

02:16:59.140 --> 02:17:00.140
I like that.

02:17:00.140 --> 02:17:04.020
That would be fucking awesome.

02:17:04.020 --> 02:17:06.740
But in the meantime, we have Frog Fractions 2.

02:17:06.740 --> 02:17:13.060
Anyhow, lastly tonight, before we get to the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio, a brand

02:17:13.060 --> 02:17:18.380
new cooking show that appeals to gamers made its debut in South Korea.

02:17:18.380 --> 02:17:19.380
That's right.

02:17:19.380 --> 02:17:24.020
It's a South Korean World of Warcraft cooking show aired on TV this week.

02:17:24.020 --> 02:17:25.380
Yeah, no, really.

02:17:25.380 --> 02:17:26.380
This really happened.

02:17:26.380 --> 02:17:30.020
It aired, I think, just yesterday, and it's called Wow!

02:17:30.020 --> 02:17:31.020
Recipe?

02:17:31.020 --> 02:17:32.020
The Meal is Ready.

02:17:32.020 --> 02:17:34.820
At least that's what the title translates to.

02:17:34.820 --> 02:17:41.500
And it stars Choi Hun Suk, hopefully I pronounced that right, sorry, a famous chef who appears

02:17:41.500 --> 02:17:43.100
on South Korean television.

02:17:43.100 --> 02:17:47.540
But in this particular show, this guy happens to be a WoW player.

02:17:47.540 --> 02:17:54.180
So he cooks dishes called murloc soup and hellhound sweet and sour fish while the guests

02:17:54.180 --> 02:17:57.220
in the studio share stories from and about the game.

02:17:57.220 --> 02:17:58.700
I actually think that's kind of awesome.

02:17:58.700 --> 02:18:03.420
Like as much as we can sit here and kind of joke like LOL WoW cooking show, I mean, we

02:18:03.420 --> 02:18:06.740
sit here and talk about video games as we're talking about food.

02:18:06.740 --> 02:18:08.220
Well, yeah, there's one I watched.

02:18:08.220 --> 02:18:10.060
This is kind of the perfect TV show.

02:18:10.060 --> 02:18:15.500
Thanks to Reddit, there was a, and I now of course, I don't remember what the series

02:18:15.500 --> 02:18:16.500
of that.

02:18:16.500 --> 02:18:17.500
Look at my phone here real quick.

02:18:17.500 --> 02:18:25.860
But there was a cooking show for like based off TV and movies, like different recipes

02:18:25.860 --> 02:18:27.500
or like dishes that are in there.

02:18:27.500 --> 02:18:29.900
They're like, well, how would they make it like one of the ones that they did was the

02:18:29.900 --> 02:18:35.480
turkey burger from Parks and Rec where they have the burger cook off thing.

02:18:35.480 --> 02:18:39.120
So they made the Ron Swanson burger, which is just meat and bun.

02:18:39.120 --> 02:18:43.440
And then they made the other turkey burger thing with like all the fancy stuff on it.

02:18:43.440 --> 02:18:46.200
And the guy's like, actually, it's pretty good.

02:18:46.200 --> 02:18:48.880
There's a cooking channel on Twitch now, so why not?

02:18:48.880 --> 02:18:50.880
And an eating channel.

02:18:50.880 --> 02:18:56.000
Wait, is there a cooking channel on Twitch or am I mixing it up with the eating channel?

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.540
I think I'm mixing it up with the eating channel.

02:18:58.540 --> 02:19:02.280
But I'm sure now that they have what the whole IRL thing, I'm sure you could do a cooking

02:19:02.280 --> 02:19:06.120
show on Twitch and get away with it and you wouldn't, you know, get shut down if you were

02:19:06.120 --> 02:19:08.960
themed like this particular show is.

02:19:08.960 --> 02:19:14.520
So SSJ 100 Matt says, it sounds like the dish where they talk about stuff and cook.

02:19:14.520 --> 02:19:17.240
I think a show like this would work great in America.

02:19:17.240 --> 02:19:21.600
I mean, I don't know if it would show on cable television or whatever, but at the same time,

02:19:21.600 --> 02:19:25.560
like it sounds like not that I would know firsthand, just based on what I've heard,

02:19:25.560 --> 02:19:28.320
it sounds like it would be great stoner TV.

02:19:28.440 --> 02:19:32.280
Like, let's talk about video games and food.

02:19:32.280 --> 02:19:35.800
I think there's an audience for that out there, you guys.

02:19:35.800 --> 02:19:37.800
It's just untapped, I don't know.

02:19:37.800 --> 02:19:40.360
Anyway, Loki, did you find the name of what you were looking for?

02:19:40.360 --> 02:19:44.920
Um, no, I think it's Andrew Ray.

02:19:44.920 --> 02:19:46.760
I have to check, take a look here.

02:19:46.760 --> 02:19:47.760
Yeah, it's Andrew Ray.

02:19:47.760 --> 02:19:51.680
It's called Binging with Babish.

02:19:51.680 --> 02:19:55.160
And so like they do Kevin's famous chili from the office.

02:19:55.200 --> 02:20:02.480
They had the eggs wood house from Archer and that is fucking disgusting.

02:20:02.480 --> 02:20:04.000
This is so heavy.

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:05.240
I kind of want to use that.

02:20:05.240 --> 02:20:07.680
All right, we are going to open up the Skype line right now.

02:20:07.680 --> 02:20:10.920
You can give us a call if you want to talk about anything we've talked about so far tonight,

02:20:10.920 --> 02:20:13.040
or perhaps you have something new you'd like to discuss.

02:20:13.040 --> 02:20:15.960
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

02:20:15.960 --> 02:20:20.240
You can also do the old fashioned way if you must, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:20:20.240 --> 02:20:24.200
But the phone lines are already ringing at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype, so let's get to it.

02:20:24.240 --> 02:20:25.240
Hi, on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:20:25.240 --> 02:20:26.240
Who's this?

02:20:26.240 --> 02:20:27.240
It's Ron.

02:20:27.240 --> 02:20:28.240
So everyone take a drink.

02:20:28.240 --> 02:20:29.520
Hey, I will do that.

02:20:29.520 --> 02:20:30.520
Here we go.

02:20:30.520 --> 02:20:31.520
Drink.

02:20:31.520 --> 02:20:32.520
Except I only have water.

02:20:32.520 --> 02:20:33.520
Boring.

02:20:33.520 --> 02:20:34.520
It's okay.

02:20:34.520 --> 02:20:35.520
It's all good.

02:20:35.520 --> 02:20:36.680
No soup waffle tonight.

02:20:36.680 --> 02:20:39.760
You got married, so okay, you already did your drinking, so it's all good.

02:20:39.760 --> 02:20:40.760
Maybe a little bit.

02:20:40.760 --> 02:20:45.280
We actually, a funny story, I got to tell this aside because it was one of the moments

02:20:45.280 --> 02:20:47.800
that really got me about the whole wedding, right?

02:20:47.800 --> 02:20:49.760
So you know, we did this as a surprise.

02:20:49.760 --> 02:20:55.340
We didn't tell anybody and in a very 2017 sort of way, we just knew there's really no

02:20:55.340 --> 02:20:57.200
other way to announce it.

02:20:57.200 --> 02:21:01.600
We told everybody on Facebook because that's just the society we live in, right?

02:21:01.600 --> 02:21:03.640
It's a great way to get news out instantly.

02:21:03.640 --> 02:21:06.760
So the reason why I say that is that it was really a surprise to pretty much everybody

02:21:06.760 --> 02:21:08.920
we knew.

02:21:08.920 --> 02:21:12.720
But Alan and I actually, we made reservations because we did this at the courthouse downtown

02:21:12.720 --> 02:21:18.000
and then we made reservations at a really fancy French place to, you know, have dinner

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:23.880
as a married couple for the first time because we knew we weren't going to do any big reception.

02:21:23.880 --> 02:21:28.880
Well when we get to the French restaurant, a friend of mine that I was doing Rocky Horror

02:21:28.880 --> 02:21:32.600
with here in Sacramento happened to be there and she was like, you guys are dressed up

02:21:32.600 --> 02:21:33.600
fancy.

02:21:33.600 --> 02:21:34.600
What's happening?

02:21:34.600 --> 02:21:37.280
And I was like, well actually we just got married and she kind of did that whole like

02:21:37.280 --> 02:21:38.280
what?

02:21:38.280 --> 02:21:39.880
You know, that whole thing of the surprise.

02:21:39.880 --> 02:21:43.400
Well the reason why I tell this story, we ended up getting the table next to them, but

02:21:43.400 --> 02:21:46.480
obviously, you know, we didn't really intrude on whatever they were doing and they didn't

02:21:46.480 --> 02:21:47.480
really intrude on us.

02:21:47.480 --> 02:21:52.120
But we exchanged pleasantries and they were very nice, the table and offering their congratulations

02:21:52.120 --> 02:21:53.120
and all this stuff.

02:21:53.120 --> 02:21:58.160
Well anyway, come the end of the night, the waiter brings by some complimentary champagne.

02:21:58.160 --> 02:22:02.560
It says on the house and we were like, oh okay, we don't, you know, Alan especially

02:22:02.560 --> 02:22:06.720
really doesn't drink at all, but you know, wedding night you can make an exception.

02:22:06.720 --> 02:22:11.000
And you know, I was driving, suddenly had a little bit.

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:13.160
But then we were like, okay, we're ready to pay the bill.

02:22:13.160 --> 02:22:17.360
And he said, oh, your friends at the other table already took care of it.

02:22:17.360 --> 02:22:19.880
And I was like, you've got to be fucking kidding me.

02:22:19.880 --> 02:22:21.400
Like in like the greatest way.

02:22:21.400 --> 02:22:26.080
Like I think we, we let out our first married couple joint gay gasp in unison.

02:22:26.080 --> 02:22:31.380
It turns out my friend and their party there at the table paid the bill for us and they

02:22:31.380 --> 02:22:34.600
got the last surprise in on my wedding day.

02:22:34.600 --> 02:22:37.760
That's pretty, that's pretty fucking awesome.

02:22:37.760 --> 02:22:38.760
Huh?

02:22:38.760 --> 02:22:40.800
I gotta say that's, that's a gesture I won't soon forget.

02:22:40.800 --> 02:22:43.660
And it's one of those things where it's like, it's, it's, it's like impossible to pay back.

02:22:43.660 --> 02:22:44.660
You know what I mean?

02:22:44.660 --> 02:22:50.280
So I will have to pay it forward on some unsuspected married couple in the future.

02:22:50.280 --> 02:22:53.960
Sounds like a plan, but I got a quick story about that and I'll talk about what I wanted

02:22:53.960 --> 02:22:54.960
to call it about.

02:22:54.960 --> 02:22:55.960
Yeah.

02:22:55.960 --> 02:22:58.920
Let's go to the pre Facebook days around the time of MySpace.

02:22:58.920 --> 02:23:04.080
I'm living with my older sister, her then fam, whatever.

02:23:04.080 --> 02:23:06.440
So I get up, get dressed, go to work.

02:23:06.440 --> 02:23:12.720
And I see her all dressed up with her husband, now husband, and I'm like, where y'all going?

02:23:12.720 --> 02:23:15.220
They're like, oh, we're going out for lunch, whatever.

02:23:15.220 --> 02:23:16.880
I'm just like, fine, whatever.

02:23:16.880 --> 02:23:21.020
I go to school, go to work, come back.

02:23:21.020 --> 02:23:23.360
My sister-in-law is stewing at the desk.

02:23:23.360 --> 02:23:25.720
I'm just like, who pissed in your cornflakes?

02:23:25.720 --> 02:23:28.480
And she's like, did you hear what happened?

02:23:28.480 --> 02:23:29.480
No.

02:23:29.480 --> 02:23:32.280
Your sister, my brother got married today.

02:23:32.280 --> 02:23:34.920
I'm like, what do you mean they got married?

02:23:34.920 --> 02:23:36.640
They went down to the courthouse and got married.

02:23:36.640 --> 02:23:41.200
And I'm just sitting there like, well, that explains why they were all dressed up this

02:23:41.200 --> 02:23:43.760
morning, huh?

02:23:43.760 --> 02:23:44.760
That's funny.

02:23:44.760 --> 02:23:48.400
So you, you knew that you'd seen them dressed up, but you, they just like, oh, we're going

02:23:48.400 --> 02:23:49.400
to lunch.

02:23:49.400 --> 02:23:50.400
Oh, okay.

02:23:50.400 --> 02:23:52.160
No biggie.

02:23:52.160 --> 02:23:53.160
That's funny.

02:23:53.160 --> 02:23:54.160
That's a good story.

02:23:54.160 --> 02:23:58.000
No, nobody saw us leaving the house since Alan and I live alone, don't have any roommates

02:23:58.000 --> 02:23:59.000
anymore.

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:01.200
We just, you know, went and did our thing.

02:24:01.200 --> 02:24:03.080
There were a lot of other couples there though.

02:24:03.080 --> 02:24:04.080
Exactly.

02:24:04.080 --> 02:24:10.360
Another, like an older, but another gay couple was doing the same thing we were doing.

02:24:10.360 --> 02:24:11.360
That is hope ruptures.

02:24:11.360 --> 02:24:12.360
Yeah.

02:24:12.360 --> 02:24:14.760
They, they wished us congratulations and we did the same, but there was a variety of couples

02:24:14.760 --> 02:24:15.760
there.

02:24:15.760 --> 02:24:18.680
There was a very young looking couple getting married as well with a few of their family

02:24:18.680 --> 02:24:19.680
members.

02:24:19.680 --> 02:24:22.400
But anyway, marriage, they could talk all night.

02:24:22.400 --> 02:24:23.400
Yeah.

02:24:23.400 --> 02:24:26.040
Now let's talk the switch real quick.

02:24:26.040 --> 02:24:27.040
Sure.

02:24:27.040 --> 02:24:32.080
I don't know if you know, but there, there are some gaming laptops out there where you

02:24:32.080 --> 02:24:34.000
can buy a dock for it.

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:42.160
And in this dock you can add a standard desktop video card and give it more power.

02:24:42.160 --> 02:24:45.600
There are some, there's talk of some docs where you can do that.

02:24:45.600 --> 02:24:50.800
You can add more Ram or another hard drive and stuff like that, hot swapping to make

02:24:50.800 --> 02:24:53.920
it give it more power when you're at home.

02:24:53.920 --> 02:25:00.760
I can see them doing something like that with the switch because I am, I had a feeling the

02:25:00.760 --> 02:25:08.080
dock was just two USBs and additional chip set to give it more power and more memory.

02:25:08.080 --> 02:25:14.840
Now I can see this happening if, if reports are coming out saying that the switch is not

02:25:14.840 --> 02:25:24.480
powerful enough to run next gen games or whatever, I can see Nintendo coming up with a doc that

02:25:24.480 --> 02:25:26.360
can do all this.

02:25:26.360 --> 02:25:30.240
And then, so you must've been, you must've been the one that was talking about this where,

02:25:30.240 --> 02:25:33.320
because I just brought this up with Loki during part a or something about this whole

02:25:33.320 --> 02:25:39.040
fact that they could upgrade the doc, uh, to do like maybe some more power or whatever.

02:25:39.040 --> 02:25:43.720
But Loki, Loki didn't seem to think that would, that would really happen when Nintendo, no,

02:25:43.720 --> 02:25:46.920
it's not going to happen in the system that you're thinking of is like one of the razor

02:25:46.920 --> 02:25:51.080
systems that they have, which are way overpriced in the first place and the performance out

02:25:51.080 --> 02:25:54.920
for those docked, um, units.

02:25:54.920 --> 02:25:59.160
It's just not the same as you would actually being an integrated cards.

02:25:59.160 --> 02:26:03.360
It's not the, the bus isn't as fast besides you're going to be paying like way too much

02:26:03.360 --> 02:26:04.800
money for that.

02:26:04.800 --> 02:26:05.800
Anyways.

02:26:05.800 --> 02:26:11.000
Um, I just, there is, they've already confirmed that there's no additional hardware in that

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:13.240
doc to enhance anything.

02:26:13.240 --> 02:26:17.880
It's just literally the output is changing for the TV cause there's no point in that,

02:26:17.880 --> 02:26:22.120
you know, outputting higher than seven 20 cause that's all the screen supports on them,

02:26:22.120 --> 02:26:23.120
the portable.

02:26:23.120 --> 02:26:26.280
And I would be willing to bet, you know, I haven't looked at it yet and actually one

02:26:26.280 --> 02:26:29.120
thing, funny enough, one of the things that last night I was thinking about, I was like,

02:26:29.120 --> 02:26:33.720
hmm, how much would it cost to make like a switch like device that actually is a PC

02:26:33.720 --> 02:26:35.400
that I can run PC games on?

02:26:35.400 --> 02:26:37.360
Cause that's kind of what I want to do anyways.

02:26:37.360 --> 02:26:42.960
And so I started thinking about it a little bit and um, it probably would be pretty expensive,

02:26:42.960 --> 02:26:49.920
but you know, the way I would have done a doc is basically just had like an HDMI and

02:26:49.920 --> 02:26:54.400
um, power make some sort of exposed like contacts.

02:26:54.400 --> 02:26:58.240
And then when you shove it into the doc, then it makes those connections and everything.

02:26:58.240 --> 02:27:02.200
And I haven't gotten a close up look at the doc, but I'm guessing that's probably how

02:27:02.200 --> 02:27:07.320
it works since I would think that, you know, having like a plug or something sitting inside

02:27:07.320 --> 02:27:10.820
there might, you might break that or might break the connection.

02:27:10.820 --> 02:27:12.580
So that would just make the most sense to me.

02:27:12.580 --> 02:27:18.280
But there's, I don't, there's no additional processing within that unit, within the doc.

02:27:18.280 --> 02:27:20.240
Not even any additional cooling either.

02:27:20.240 --> 02:27:25.240
Oh, I kind of figured much, but that one, the laptop you're talking about, it was, it's

02:27:25.240 --> 02:27:30.640
not a Razer if it is them, it's brand new, but I know it's Alienware that has that.

02:27:30.640 --> 02:27:31.640
Oh, okay.

02:27:31.640 --> 02:27:32.640
Well, whatever.

02:27:32.640 --> 02:27:34.840
I think expensive computers and Razer comes to mind.

02:27:34.840 --> 02:27:36.600
Well, Alienware would be up there too.

02:27:36.600 --> 02:27:37.600
Yes.

02:27:37.600 --> 02:27:40.120
Alienware, they're also ridiculous expensive computers.

02:27:40.120 --> 02:27:41.120
Yeah.

02:27:41.120 --> 02:27:47.180
Well, most Razer laptops look like a really fancy MacBook Pros that run with Windows 10.

02:27:47.180 --> 02:27:50.260
You know, something I've been thinking about though, and I guess this doesn't directly

02:27:50.260 --> 02:27:53.800
relate to the doc thing, but it does a little bit is that I really think a lot of people

02:27:53.800 --> 02:27:58.220
are kind of underestimating this potential, and maybe I'm overthinking it, I don't know,

02:27:58.220 --> 02:28:01.800
but of the Windows 10 game mode and this whole thing that's coming where they're going to

02:28:01.800 --> 02:28:06.320
allow more of your computer processing power to be dedicated to games.

02:28:06.320 --> 02:28:13.480
I would think that this is really going to put PCs in line with what we see Project Scorpio

02:28:13.480 --> 02:28:18.600
is going to end up being capable of, and yet there's this whole ecosystem of you can buy

02:28:18.600 --> 02:28:24.320
the game once and you get it on both Xbox One and Windows 10 or whatever.

02:28:24.320 --> 02:28:28.900
It's almost like Project Scorpio, whatever that ends up being, is going to be your doc

02:28:28.900 --> 02:28:29.900
in a way.

02:28:29.900 --> 02:28:30.900
I don't know.

02:28:30.900 --> 02:28:33.680
It's just something weird I've been thinking about, but I'm really curious what a game

02:28:33.680 --> 02:28:37.560
changer, wink nod, game mode's going to be in Windows 10.

02:28:37.560 --> 02:28:45.760
Well, I can't say this much about Project Scorpio, modular.

02:28:45.760 --> 02:28:50.240
But that's usually why people stay away from PCs and go to consoles, is because of the

02:28:50.240 --> 02:28:51.240
whole modular thing.

02:28:51.240 --> 02:28:54.320
So it'd be weird if they did that.

02:28:54.320 --> 02:28:55.320
But here's the thing.

02:28:55.320 --> 02:28:56.320
Yeah.

02:28:56.320 --> 02:28:57.320
PCs are modular.

02:28:57.320 --> 02:29:02.120
It doesn't take much to do upgrades, but it does take a lot of thought and requirement

02:29:02.120 --> 02:29:04.800
if you really want to do proper upgrades or whatever.

02:29:04.800 --> 02:29:10.000
The way I see Scorpio's going with modular upgrades, it's going to stay on there compatible

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:11.000
with this.

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:12.000
It's going to work.

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:13.160
They're going to keep it simple as possible.

02:29:13.160 --> 02:29:17.560
They're going to try to make it as simple as possible.

02:29:17.560 --> 02:29:19.560
I don't think they're going to do that.

02:29:19.560 --> 02:29:23.840
And honestly, I think it's just going to be just a simple setup where they sell a console.

02:29:23.840 --> 02:29:27.160
It wouldn't make any sense anyways, because the first thing you're going to have happen,

02:29:27.160 --> 02:29:31.000
especially now that it's Windows 10 stuff, you have a lot of these games that are Xbox

02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:35.240
One that run on Windows 10, especially if you're looking at first-party titles.

02:29:35.240 --> 02:29:39.880
I mean, of course, once the specs come out for this and the price, they're just going

02:29:39.880 --> 02:29:43.920
to be like, okay, what kind of PC can it build for that same amount of money spec-wise?

02:29:43.920 --> 02:29:46.720
And I'm sure that they'll be able to come up with something that's more powerful than

02:29:46.720 --> 02:29:47.720
it.

02:29:47.720 --> 02:29:50.680
It's just, I don't know.

02:29:50.680 --> 02:29:55.440
I had to see what enhancements this is actually going to offer for the price.

02:29:55.440 --> 02:30:00.560
And I doubt that it would go modular, because what's the point at that point?

02:30:00.560 --> 02:30:03.960
I mean, why wouldn't you just buy a PC at that point?

02:30:03.960 --> 02:30:07.200
And for the average consumer, that doesn't make any sense either, because they're not

02:30:07.200 --> 02:30:09.920
going to understand how to upgrade a system.

02:30:09.920 --> 02:30:16.800
Well, I mean, I know I've talked to a lot of people who talk about how to build their

02:30:16.800 --> 02:30:21.540
computers and so forth, and for some it's easy, and others it's quite overwhelming.

02:30:21.540 --> 02:30:22.540
So I get it.

02:30:22.540 --> 02:30:29.040
I mean, you could spend $400 to build a pretty decent gaming PC, or you spend $400 on a powerful

02:30:29.040 --> 02:30:32.680
console, everything is set, grab it, plug, and go.

02:30:32.680 --> 02:30:33.960
It's just what it boils down to.

02:30:33.960 --> 02:30:38.000
They just, people, console players, they want to keep it simple as possible.

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:41.680
All right, well, we'll see.

02:30:41.680 --> 02:30:45.480
We got E3 is going to unveil a lot, I think, in that regard.

02:30:45.480 --> 02:30:48.160
I think Microsoft will pour a lot into E3, so we'll see.

02:30:48.160 --> 02:30:50.560
But anyway, Brahma, I'm going to let you go so we can get more calls, okay?

02:30:50.560 --> 02:30:51.560
Oh, no problem, dude.

02:30:51.560 --> 02:30:52.560
All right.

02:30:52.560 --> 02:30:53.560
Anime Jam session.

02:30:53.560 --> 02:30:54.560
Everybody listen.

02:30:54.560 --> 02:30:55.560
Damn right.

02:30:55.560 --> 02:30:56.560
All right.

02:30:56.560 --> 02:30:57.560
Take care, my friend.

02:30:57.560 --> 02:30:58.560
You too.

02:30:58.560 --> 02:30:59.560
Bye.

02:30:59.560 --> 02:31:00.560
All right.

02:31:00.560 --> 02:31:01.560
Skypline's lit tonight.

02:31:01.560 --> 02:31:02.560
Let's get to the next call.

02:31:02.560 --> 02:31:03.560
Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.

02:31:04.160 --> 02:31:05.160
Hi, this is YYR.

02:31:05.160 --> 02:31:06.160
Hey, my friend.

02:31:06.160 --> 02:31:09.640
Ooh, you're echoing just a little bit, but hopefully Skype will equalize there.

02:31:09.640 --> 02:31:11.760
But what's on your mind, my friend?

02:31:11.760 --> 02:31:13.360
Sorry if there's echoing.

02:31:13.360 --> 02:31:16.680
It's because I'm in my dining room and there isn't much on the walls yet.

02:31:16.680 --> 02:31:17.680
Ah, okay.

02:31:17.680 --> 02:31:18.680
That makes sense.

02:31:18.680 --> 02:31:19.680
So what's up?

02:31:19.680 --> 02:31:22.680
Well, first of all, I wanted to say congratulations to you and Alan.

02:31:22.680 --> 02:31:23.680
Welcome to the club.

02:31:23.680 --> 02:31:24.680
Thank you.

02:31:24.680 --> 02:31:25.680
I appreciate that.

02:31:25.680 --> 02:31:26.680
That's right.

02:31:26.680 --> 02:31:27.680
You got married just in the past year, too.

02:31:27.680 --> 02:31:30.200
You were here right after your wedding, yeah.

02:31:30.200 --> 02:31:31.200
Yeah.

02:31:31.840 --> 02:31:37.020
It's wonderful, and I hope you guys have many, many, many, many, many years of bliss.

02:31:37.020 --> 02:31:38.020
Thank you.

02:31:38.020 --> 02:31:39.020
We'll try.

02:31:39.020 --> 02:31:43.960
I will say this much on the thing you just talked about as far as why I don't think game

02:31:43.960 --> 02:31:46.800
mode is going to be a game changer.

02:31:46.800 --> 02:31:48.720
Universal Windows Platform.

02:31:48.720 --> 02:31:49.720
You did here, right?

02:31:49.720 --> 02:31:50.720
Oh, yeah.

02:31:50.720 --> 02:31:52.340
That's a fair point, I suppose.

02:31:52.340 --> 02:31:59.740
It's limited to UWP apps, so until the Windows Store is less of a piece of crap, I don't

02:31:59.780 --> 02:32:01.820
think it's going to really gain much traction.

02:32:01.820 --> 02:32:03.180
All right.

02:32:03.180 --> 02:32:04.180
Fair perspective.

02:32:04.180 --> 02:32:05.180
Fair perspective.

02:32:05.180 --> 02:32:08.380
Well, what did you want to call in tonight about before you heard that?

02:32:08.380 --> 02:32:09.380
Well, you know what?

02:32:09.380 --> 02:32:14.300
I wanted to mention something that has pretty much flown under the radar because it's very

02:32:14.300 --> 02:32:22.240
niche news, but fortunately, it's in our niche, so I think it's very appropriate that you

02:32:22.240 --> 02:32:25.900
guys all know about this.

02:32:25.900 --> 02:32:31.180
Have you heard of the Konami Arcade Championship?

02:32:31.180 --> 02:32:36.500
I feel like yes because you brought it up before, but otherwise, no.

02:32:36.500 --> 02:32:38.700
It's not something I've been actively following.

02:32:38.700 --> 02:32:39.700
Okay.

02:32:39.700 --> 02:32:43.600
Well, this is the sixth year that Konami has run this.

02:32:43.600 --> 02:32:50.820
It's basically a yearly tournament for all of their Bimani games, and they hold preliminaries

02:32:50.820 --> 02:32:58.320
over e-amusement on pretty much all the Bimani games, 2DX, SoundVoltex, what have you.

02:32:58.320 --> 02:33:02.900
People compete in the preliminaries just by playing the game and playing the songs out

02:33:02.900 --> 02:33:05.580
of the qualifying folder.

02:33:05.580 --> 02:33:12.460
When the qualifiers are all done, basically, the top players get an all-expenses-paid trip

02:33:12.460 --> 02:33:16.140
to Tokyo, where they compete in the finals.

02:33:16.140 --> 02:33:17.140
Okay.

02:33:17.140 --> 02:33:23.620
Well, interestingly enough, you may recall that this past year was the first year that

02:33:23.620 --> 02:33:31.700
we have ever had a version of DDR released in North America officially with e-amusement.

02:33:31.700 --> 02:33:36.820
Right, with DDR-Ace and the fact that round ones have them, right.

02:33:36.820 --> 02:33:43.820
And so, North America was officially added as a competition region for the Konami Arcade

02:33:43.820 --> 02:33:45.980
Championships in DDR-Ace.

02:33:45.980 --> 02:33:48.860
I feel like there's a punchline coming.

02:33:48.860 --> 02:34:01.740
Well, California's own Chris Chyke, aka IAmChrisForLife, and Jeff Lloyd, aka Funga, have qualified

02:34:01.740 --> 02:34:08.740
first and second place overall, as well as a third person who I don't know personally,

02:34:08.740 --> 02:34:14.380
and they will all be flying to Japan next month to represent us in the finals, which

02:34:14.380 --> 02:34:18.620
will be streamed live in February over Konami's website.

02:34:18.620 --> 02:34:21.140
Oh, there's no punchline.

02:34:21.140 --> 02:34:22.140
This is good news.

02:34:22.140 --> 02:34:23.460
This is great news.

02:34:23.460 --> 02:34:27.100
I was expecting some huge Konami fuckup as a punchline.

02:34:27.100 --> 02:34:28.820
That's the day and age that we live in.

02:34:28.820 --> 02:34:34.780
We're like, oh, the scores got deleted, or Konami rendered it ineligible, or the machines

02:34:34.780 --> 02:34:40.860
deleted themselves, or I was expecting some colossal Konami fuckup as a punchline.

02:34:40.860 --> 02:34:41.860
And there's not one.

02:34:41.860 --> 02:34:43.180
This story has a happy ending.

02:34:43.740 --> 02:34:45.140
No, no, this is amazing.

02:34:45.140 --> 02:34:47.780
I'm really looking forward to this.

02:34:47.780 --> 02:34:53.700
I hope to pass this along to some major gaming websites and see if they pick up on it, because

02:34:53.700 --> 02:34:56.900
I feel like this is a story you're not going to hear very often.

02:34:56.900 --> 02:35:01.500
I mean, first of all, DDR's kind of an e-sport already.

02:35:01.500 --> 02:35:04.300
There's some that listen to this show that might pluck it, but we'll see.

02:35:04.300 --> 02:35:05.300
I know you're out there.

02:35:05.300 --> 02:35:06.780
I know you're out there.

02:35:06.780 --> 02:35:07.780
Say hi sometimes.

02:35:07.780 --> 02:35:15.460
Every day, you see North Americans flying to the host country to challenge their best

02:35:15.460 --> 02:35:20.380
at their own game, and I mean, they're all friends anyway, but it's going to be amazing

02:35:20.380 --> 02:35:21.380
to watch.

02:35:21.380 --> 02:35:22.380
Yeah, that'll be great.

02:35:22.380 --> 02:35:28.460
I mean, finally, here we are in 2017, and Konami is finally kind of recognizing the

02:35:28.460 --> 02:35:30.100
global audience of DDR.

02:35:30.100 --> 02:35:31.100
That's fucking fantastic.

02:35:31.100 --> 02:35:36.620
God, I wish it had been that way when we started this show 15 years ago, but say it with me.

02:35:36.620 --> 02:35:41.780
And having spoken to both of the number one and number two players at MAGFest, they were

02:35:41.780 --> 02:35:43.900
both there trying Kyle Ward's new game.

02:35:43.900 --> 02:35:44.900
Did you get to try it?

02:35:44.900 --> 02:35:46.140
I hope you did.

02:35:46.140 --> 02:35:47.140
Here's the thing.

02:35:47.140 --> 02:35:51.380
On my flight over there, I kind of fucked up my leg, so I had a problem kind of walking

02:35:51.380 --> 02:35:53.480
around, so I didn't really get to...

02:35:53.480 --> 02:35:59.260
I did like basic steps on, okay, because there was a fucking solo fourth mix, and I can't

02:35:59.260 --> 02:36:00.260
not play solo.

02:36:00.260 --> 02:36:04.300
So I played lightly, but there were so many crowds around Step Maniacs.

02:36:04.300 --> 02:36:10.100
I did not play myself, however, my good pal, Jonko, who used to be on a show called Koopa

02:36:10.100 --> 02:36:14.380
Club, we're really good friends now, and we were there, I watched him play.

02:36:14.380 --> 02:36:19.140
He's still really good at those music games, his feet flying and all that stuff.

02:36:19.140 --> 02:36:22.500
I can't keep up with him in my advancing age.

02:36:22.500 --> 02:36:25.680
But I watched him play, so I feel like I got a good sense of the game, because I stood

02:36:25.680 --> 02:36:28.300
there and I watched like, oh, it's a touch screen.

02:36:28.300 --> 02:36:29.300
Oh, he kind of...

02:36:29.300 --> 02:36:30.300
Oh, I see.

02:36:30.300 --> 02:36:31.820
Kyle kind of took the re-rave cabinet and did something new with it.

02:36:31.820 --> 02:36:33.260
Yeah, I was thrown by that too.

02:36:33.260 --> 02:36:36.460
Yeah, so that was, you know, and I kind of liked that.

02:36:36.460 --> 02:36:37.460
So it was really hard to hear.

02:36:37.460 --> 02:36:39.340
And all of them were Matrixwalk jokes.

02:36:39.340 --> 02:36:40.340
Yeah.

02:36:40.340 --> 02:36:41.340
Yeah, yeah.

02:36:41.340 --> 02:36:42.340
No more of that, huh?

02:36:42.340 --> 02:36:49.260
It was really hard to hear in the songs themselves, but I certainly caught that not only did he

02:36:49.260 --> 02:36:54.520
get to pluck some of the very classic DDR songs, I caught some Captain Jack in there,

02:36:54.520 --> 02:36:55.580
but you know, kind of like...

02:36:55.580 --> 02:37:00.420
And this was always the case with not just In the Groove, but then his later stuff, like

02:37:00.420 --> 02:37:06.580
Re-Rave, where it's like, oh, there's an erotic song, a Smile DK song, you know, Kyle's very

02:37:06.580 --> 02:37:12.580
self-aware and clearly must be, must have some sort of Konami's blessing slash we won't

02:37:12.580 --> 02:37:17.460
sue you slash 10% of the profits type thing that allows this game to exist.

02:37:17.460 --> 02:37:19.980
Well, you know, I did ask him about that.

02:37:19.980 --> 02:37:22.180
I would be shocked if he can talk about it.

02:37:22.180 --> 02:37:27.180
Well, basically what he said to me was, it was disgust.

02:37:27.180 --> 02:37:30.260
But beyond that, he said he couldn't tell me.

02:37:30.260 --> 02:37:31.900
He was not at liberty to tell me.

02:37:31.900 --> 02:37:37.620
So what I gather from that is that they did discuss something and he's under NDA right

02:37:37.620 --> 02:37:38.620
now.

02:37:38.620 --> 02:37:39.620
Yeah.

02:37:39.620 --> 02:37:40.620
Yeah.

02:37:40.620 --> 02:37:41.620
And that's understandable.

02:37:41.620 --> 02:37:45.740
They've worked something out, but the terms he can't disclose, I mean, that's a business

02:37:45.740 --> 02:37:46.740
deal.

02:37:46.740 --> 02:37:47.740
It's, you know, that's...

02:37:47.740 --> 02:37:50.500
Which says to me that maybe that's good news.

02:37:50.500 --> 02:37:51.500
So...

02:37:51.500 --> 02:37:52.500
Oh, I think it is.

02:37:52.500 --> 02:37:53.500
I think he...

02:37:53.500 --> 02:37:54.500
Well, I mean, I don't know.

02:37:54.500 --> 02:37:55.500
Fuck it.

02:37:55.500 --> 02:37:57.380
I just need to invite him back on the show when he's ready.

02:37:57.380 --> 02:38:00.660
He might not be ready to talk about the whole thing yet, but when he's ready, we can get

02:38:00.660 --> 02:38:01.820
everything firsthand.

02:38:01.820 --> 02:38:07.220
But yeah, I would, you know, I anticipate he's going big with this and he, you know,

02:38:07.220 --> 02:38:09.860
even in just interviewing him on our show, what, God, it was probably two or three years

02:38:09.860 --> 02:38:10.860
ago at this point.

02:38:10.860 --> 02:38:15.460
No, the same year as PAX East Boston, so that was what, 2014, right?

02:38:15.460 --> 02:38:16.460
So...

02:38:16.460 --> 02:38:17.460
Sounds right.

02:38:17.460 --> 02:38:18.460
Yeah.

02:38:18.460 --> 02:38:19.460
So it was a little over two years ago.

02:38:20.380 --> 02:38:24.740
He's definitely learned a lot from the legal perspective than what we were talking years

02:38:24.740 --> 02:38:25.740
ago.

02:38:25.740 --> 02:38:29.300
So I think the man knows how to cross his T's and dot his I's, so...

02:38:29.300 --> 02:38:39.060
Yeah, and just to finish up, I'll just say, having talked to both Chris and Jeff at MAGFest,

02:38:39.060 --> 02:38:43.740
they're hoping that Konami uses, you know, this opportunity to have the North Americans

02:38:43.740 --> 02:38:47.260
come and compete at the highest level over there.

02:38:47.260 --> 02:38:52.020
They're hoping that that will encourage Konami to expand their offerings further to North

02:38:52.020 --> 02:38:54.460
America.

02:38:54.460 --> 02:38:57.140
So I hope that's what comes out of it too.

02:38:57.140 --> 02:38:58.140
That would be great.

02:38:58.140 --> 02:39:01.100
And JD actually clarifies it was May 3rd, 2015.

02:39:01.100 --> 02:39:02.100
It really took that long.

02:39:02.100 --> 02:39:03.360
I thought it was...

02:39:03.360 --> 02:39:05.020
My ears are blending together at this point.

02:39:05.020 --> 02:39:06.580
I guess it was 2015 that was PAX East.

02:39:06.580 --> 02:39:08.940
I know how you feel.

02:39:08.940 --> 02:39:09.940
It's just a blur.

02:39:09.940 --> 02:39:14.340
Yeah, that makes sense because my first MAG was 2016 and I switched to MAG from PAX East,

02:39:14.340 --> 02:39:15.340
which I went on to.

02:39:15.340 --> 02:39:16.340
All right, it makes sense.

02:39:16.420 --> 02:39:18.300
Don't fucking bring facts into this, JD.

02:39:18.300 --> 02:39:20.300
I hate it when you do that.

02:39:20.300 --> 02:39:24.980
All right, let me put this out though, because I think this is an important point.

02:39:24.980 --> 02:39:28.540
I want to get your perspective on this, being a big music game fan and being one of the

02:39:28.540 --> 02:39:32.420
people that really convinced me to give MAG a try.

02:39:32.420 --> 02:39:37.180
There's a lot of rumor, well, not even rumor, just we all see what's happening on Reddit

02:39:37.180 --> 02:39:40.020
between MAGFest and Tokyo Attack.

02:39:40.020 --> 02:39:44.980
And Tokyo Attack has pretty much said, we're out for next MAGFest, not happening.

02:39:44.980 --> 02:39:48.860
So what's your reaction to that whole thing, being a music game fan?

02:39:48.860 --> 02:39:52.460
Well, I did talk to Anthony while I was there.

02:39:52.460 --> 02:40:01.500
Anthony is the head of Tokyo Attack and he said that MAGFest's organization has gotten

02:40:01.500 --> 02:40:08.500
to be very complex, as you would expect when it's grown to the size that it has.

02:40:08.500 --> 02:40:10.980
Well, it's splintering now too.

02:40:10.980 --> 02:40:14.060
I'm just saying we're going to have MAG West this year.

02:40:14.060 --> 02:40:17.420
They have traveling MAG shows, they have the tiny MAG show they still do.

02:40:17.420 --> 02:40:22.900
I mean, there's all these MAG spinoffs, so definitely there's a lot of parts to the machine.

02:40:22.900 --> 02:40:26.220
Definitely, many more than there used to be.

02:40:26.220 --> 02:40:34.060
And basically he said that it's been difficult to coordinate and to deal with the various

02:40:34.060 --> 02:40:39.700
heads of the Hydra, much more so now than it used to be, and he's gotten frustrated

02:40:39.700 --> 02:40:41.220
with it.

02:40:41.220 --> 02:40:46.060
And you know, it's his company and he has the right to make those kind of decisions

02:40:46.060 --> 02:40:48.180
and I respect that.

02:40:48.180 --> 02:40:54.020
And I know that definitely there'll be some holes in the lineup if they're gone.

02:40:54.020 --> 02:41:02.780
I know that they brought Beatstream, they brought SoundVoltex and Muzecca and Bishi

02:41:02.780 --> 02:41:09.340
Bashi as they usually do, and many other very niche, very unique games.

02:41:09.340 --> 02:41:16.620
But that being said, if you go just by the number of machines that were there, the number

02:41:16.620 --> 02:41:25.700
of Pump and DDR and just music games in general, even Ubeat, I would say Tokyo Attack wasn't

02:41:25.700 --> 02:41:30.340
even 50% of it, probably closer to 30 to 40.

02:41:30.340 --> 02:41:37.780
And so if they're not there, it's not like you won't still see 10 DDR machines.

02:41:37.780 --> 02:41:44.180
You may not get all of the games, but there will still be plenty of music games there.

02:41:44.180 --> 02:41:49.460
I hope Tokyo is still, I know this doesn't do you Northeasterners a lot of good unless

02:41:49.460 --> 02:41:53.700
you travel, but I still hope Tokyo Attack has a relationship with Dragon Con, because

02:41:53.700 --> 02:41:56.300
that was a great addition to Dragon Con last year, so we'll see.

02:41:56.300 --> 02:42:00.140
It's not on their calendar yet, but I don't think they have a lot past the first couple

02:42:00.140 --> 02:42:01.140
months of the year.

02:42:01.140 --> 02:42:04.940
Well, I mean, Anthony wasn't talking about, well, I'm done with conventions.

02:42:04.940 --> 02:42:08.780
He only specifically mentioned MagFest, so honestly, I don't think it'll affect Dragon

02:42:08.780 --> 02:42:13.180
Con or Otacon or any of the other conventions that they've been doing regularly.

02:42:13.180 --> 02:42:18.420
Yeah, and they are confirmed for MomoCon, which is kind of the sister convention now

02:42:18.420 --> 02:42:20.060
in Atlanta.

02:42:20.060 --> 02:42:23.960
And what was the other thing I was going to say, oh yeah, they took that setup right over

02:42:23.960 --> 02:42:28.620
to the other side of DC, where Awesome Games Done Quick was doing their thing, like right

02:42:28.620 --> 02:42:30.300
as Mag was ending.

02:42:30.300 --> 02:42:34.020
So they're very good at what they do, for sure, for sure.

02:42:34.100 --> 02:42:38.060
Anyway, my friend, I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up, but thanks for your call.

02:42:38.060 --> 02:42:42.780
Hey, you're welcome, and congratulations again, and I hope you guys all have a great week.

02:42:42.780 --> 02:42:43.780
Thank you, you too.

02:42:43.780 --> 02:42:44.780
Take care, my friend.

02:42:44.780 --> 02:42:45.780
Yep, take care.

02:42:45.780 --> 02:42:46.780
All right.

02:42:46.780 --> 02:42:47.780
Bye.

02:42:47.780 --> 02:42:49.420
I think that is going to do it for the Skypline tonight.

02:42:49.420 --> 02:42:52.700
I'm sorry for those that didn't get through tonight, but you can always send us an email

02:42:52.700 --> 02:42:58.700
over at Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, but we are about done for the night, unless

02:42:58.700 --> 02:43:01.540
I do need to check in and see if Loki has any last-minute stories for us tonight.

02:43:01.540 --> 02:43:03.500
I do have a couple last-minute stories, actually.

02:43:03.500 --> 02:43:04.740
Please, go for it.

02:43:04.740 --> 02:43:12.420
So I guess it only makes sense, since VR is now a thing, but apparently, a VR film company

02:43:12.420 --> 02:43:20.180
is rebooting the movie series Lawmoor Man, and it's going to be only viewable in a VR

02:43:20.180 --> 02:43:21.180
headset.

02:43:21.180 --> 02:43:23.460
So they're developing a new series based on that.

02:43:23.460 --> 02:43:26.540
I'm not sure if that's going to be like a TV series, movies, or something like that,

02:43:26.540 --> 02:43:33.460
but they're going to be VR movies now, so that'd be kind of cool to see.

02:43:33.500 --> 02:43:34.500
Excited about that.

02:43:34.500 --> 02:43:41.060
Lawmoor Man 2 was not so good, but, you know, it's got its nostalgia.

02:43:41.060 --> 02:43:47.540
And then, I wanted to mention Games Done Quick did $2.2 million this year, so that's raised

02:43:47.540 --> 02:43:50.580
quite a bit of money, and I got to watch quite a bit of that.

02:43:50.580 --> 02:43:57.020
That's what I was doing in between playing games, so I'm probably going to check out

02:43:57.020 --> 02:43:59.780
more of those on-demand videos for that as well.

02:43:59.780 --> 02:44:08.940
And finally, EA's Patrick Soderlund, he had made a comment regarding Nintendo Switch,

02:44:08.940 --> 02:44:13.220
and basically saying, I spoke only about FIFA today, but our company's structure let us

02:44:13.220 --> 02:44:18.420
release all sorts of games for every platform, so we'll go wherever the gamers go.

02:44:18.420 --> 02:44:22.780
I think Nintendo Switch will put Nintendo at the forefront of the game industry once

02:44:22.780 --> 02:44:23.780
again.

02:44:23.780 --> 02:44:27.220
Their approach is quite different from anything they've done in the past.

02:44:27.220 --> 02:44:31.940
We've listened to EA, Activision, and other companies since the beginning of the Switch's

02:44:31.940 --> 02:44:35.380
development, so we've been involved through the whole process.

02:44:35.380 --> 02:44:40.040
They teamed up with us because they wanted to guarantee the console would be a success.

02:44:40.040 --> 02:44:42.660
Doing business with Nintendo is very important to us.

02:44:42.660 --> 02:44:46.380
We'd like to bring more and more games over for everyone.

02:44:46.380 --> 02:44:49.140
So maybe third parties are on board.

02:44:49.140 --> 02:44:53.500
All I'm saying right now is based off of what I've seen them announce, I'm not entirely

02:44:53.500 --> 02:44:54.940
convinced yet.

02:44:54.940 --> 02:44:59.100
And based on what YYR says in chat, I kind of tend to agree, where YYR says, I take this

02:44:59.100 --> 02:45:01.620
EA statement to mean the same as last time on Wii U.

02:45:01.620 --> 02:45:03.420
If people buy it, we will come.

02:45:03.420 --> 02:45:05.300
And last time didn't happen.

02:45:05.300 --> 02:45:06.300
Yeah.

02:45:06.300 --> 02:45:08.300
All right.

02:45:08.300 --> 02:45:11.820
And let's see, what else?

02:45:11.820 --> 02:45:13.820
That's pretty much it, sadly.

02:45:13.820 --> 02:45:14.820
All right.

02:45:14.820 --> 02:45:19.220
Well, that is going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:45:19.220 --> 02:45:22.040
Thank you guys so much for listening to the show tonight.

02:45:22.040 --> 02:45:24.180
We appreciate all the support.

02:45:24.220 --> 02:45:28.820
As a reminder, you can leave us a nice five-star review on a place like iTunes or Google Play

02:45:28.820 --> 02:45:29.820
or what have you.

02:45:29.820 --> 02:45:31.220
That stuff goes a very long way.

02:45:31.220 --> 02:45:32.660
We really appreciate it.

02:45:32.660 --> 02:45:38.100
Also, we don't ask for your money here on the show, so you can always spread us via

02:45:38.100 --> 02:45:39.100
word of mouth.

02:45:39.100 --> 02:45:40.100
It goes a long way.

02:45:40.100 --> 02:45:45.740
Tell a friend or two about the show because we can't have an audience and voices to hear

02:45:45.740 --> 02:45:48.420
from if they're not here to share them.

02:45:48.420 --> 02:45:49.420
But that's going to do it.

02:45:49.420 --> 02:45:50.420
Hooray.

02:45:50.420 --> 02:45:53.420
We made it through the show without a power outage, although I think the rain kind of

02:45:53.420 --> 02:45:54.420
stopped.

02:45:54.420 --> 02:45:55.420
Yeah, it was weird.

02:45:55.420 --> 02:45:59.140
Last night, if we were doing the show, that would have been kind of iffy because it was

02:45:59.140 --> 02:46:00.780
like 50, 60 mile an hour winds.

02:46:00.780 --> 02:46:02.940
The wind woke me up at four in the morning.

02:46:02.940 --> 02:46:03.940
I don't know if you saw.

02:46:03.940 --> 02:46:06.700
Okay, so you know how the storms last week blew our fence over?

02:46:06.700 --> 02:46:07.700
Oh, I didn't know that.

02:46:07.700 --> 02:46:12.460
So they fixed it, and now last night, the other half of it blew over.

02:46:12.460 --> 02:46:15.260
Yeah, it was bad.

02:46:15.260 --> 02:46:16.380
It was almost like a hurricane.

02:46:16.380 --> 02:46:18.740
I'm sure some of you East Coasters are like, that's nothing.

02:46:18.740 --> 02:46:23.460
But keep in mind, California isn't built with that kind of weather in mind.

02:46:23.460 --> 02:46:28.140
So 60 mile an hour winds is a pretty fucking big deal, and it's fucked up the fence.

02:46:28.140 --> 02:46:31.220
I thought it was done raining this morning, but apparently it started raining again.

02:46:31.220 --> 02:46:33.100
It's supposed to be like off and on Sunday.

02:46:33.100 --> 02:46:37.860
It's supposed to be moist and unstable, just like me, through tomorrow, through Monday,

02:46:37.860 --> 02:46:40.820
and then finally sun for a week.

02:46:40.820 --> 02:46:42.180
So that'll be nice.

02:46:42.180 --> 02:46:43.540
Nice little break here.

02:46:43.540 --> 02:46:49.420
So speaking of, in a week, we will see you back here in a week, in seven days, where

02:46:49.420 --> 02:46:52.740
we will do another episode of Orange Launch Radio, talk about whatever happened in gaming

02:46:52.740 --> 02:46:53.740
that week.

02:46:53.740 --> 02:46:55.900
Hopefully maybe we can get another interview for you guys.

02:46:55.900 --> 02:47:01.960
Dark Soccer should be back in seven days, and lots of bright sunshine finally.

02:47:01.960 --> 02:47:05.780
So maybe we can get outside and play more things like Pokemon Go and the outdoor games.

02:47:05.780 --> 02:47:08.540
But for now, we're gonna do it.

02:47:08.540 --> 02:47:12.360
We're gonna end this episode of Orange Launch Radio and say we'll see you in seven days.

02:47:12.360 --> 02:47:14.080
Have a great week, everybody.

02:47:14.080 --> 02:47:15.600
Thanks Matt Baume for being here tonight.

02:47:15.600 --> 02:47:19.280
Thank you guys for being here tonight in chat or via the podcast.

02:47:19.280 --> 02:47:21.440
We'll see you next time here at Orange Launch Radio.

02:47:21.440 --> 02:47:22.440
