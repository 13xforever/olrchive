00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Secret of Romano was my childhood gateway drug into action-adventure games, and I'm thrilled to say that it's being remade for PS4, Vita, and Steam to be released in February.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This is the first fourth wall-breaking intro, stay tuned for tonight's news starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice, it is Orange Lounge Radio.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Live tonight, August the 27th, 2017 with episode number 698 of our show.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
My name is Rob Roberts, here with my co-host to talk about video games over there at DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm dying.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Do you need CPR?

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Hot!

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Oh, it's the food you're eating, isn't it?

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I normally don't eat spicy food because I'm allergic to peppers and chilis, but I've had Benadryl like all morning, and so I said, oh, I'll be fine.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Hot!

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
My mouth feels like outside.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It's one of those things where it's like, I'm lactose intolerant, but once in a while I just want to have some ice cream.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Oh, it was delicious though.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
But that's why they make pills, right?

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It's like death in my mouth, and now I need to drink, like, milk. Lots of milk.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
If this show was titled with quotes from the show like we used to do with Hoard House, I would call this episode Death in My Mouth, which seemed inappropriate.

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Death in My Mouth.

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Oh my gosh, you guys, the show tonight has been a hot mess, and it hasn't even started, like it's been a minute.

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
This show is my mouth.

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
No, look.

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The hot mess.

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Here's the deal.

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I know some of you guys like to give me a show. I need to introduce Techmaster Loki, because I know he's going to razz me about this.

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Hi, Loki. How are you?

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Hi.

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Are you enjoying that burger?

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
No, see, here's the thing. This is more of like one of those settling meals.

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Like, I didn't really want it, but I was, like, I couldn't decide on what I wanted, and I was like, eh, fine.

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
This is the blind bait meal.

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's just like, I don't really want a bacon ultimate cheeseburger, but fine.

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Yeah, it's like I have to eat something.

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I need something. Like, I was like, McDonald's is going to be shit. I don't want to eat tacos because I'm eating tacos every single day.

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
What's one more day of tacos?

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I mean, it's good. I'm going to eat tacos tomorrow, but like, I'm not going to, I don't want, I didn't want to get more tacos today.

39
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I was like, cause I'm kind of taco'd out right now. So I was like, okay, I'll get a hamburger.

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Haven't eaten it yet. I'm sure it's mediocre, but yeah, I'm just kind of like, eh.

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So here's the thing, is that the studio may be on its, Studio N7 here that we're based in in lovely Sacramento, California, it may be on its last legs.

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And I don't mean that in a panic way, but I mean that in a, you guys have given me shit over the years, and rightfully so probably, because I'm continuing to use Windows XP to run this show.

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And you guys are probably like, Rob, seriously. But I'm like, guys, seriously, and gals, seriously, like if something isn't broken, and you're doing this live show that you've done for over 15 years, if something isn't broken, I don't like to go out of my way to fix it.

44
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Well, unfortunately now it might be broken.

45
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Of course, you can always expect Microsoft to break something for you.

46
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Well, here's the thing, like Skype has just decided it doesn't want to work anymore. I tried to use the web online Skype, nah, you got to have Windows 7 in order to use that, even though it says right there on the site, it'll work on XP.

47
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Well, at least the client is supposed to work on XP, but I keep getting this whole error, I can't connect. So unfortunately, we can't have a Skype line tonight, which I'm really sad about, because I love talking to you guys.

48
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
But we can do our toss call with Bobby Black Wolf that we do right at the end of his show, because he usually has this on at the end of his show.

49
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Then I try to start tonight's show, and Winamp is just like, crash, I'm like, okay, and then what happens when I bring back up Winamp, my default playlist is gone.

50
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Because, you know, when we do this live show, there's a certain setup to it, you know, we have like a little song to bring us into the show, and then there's, you know, Jason's little intro, you know, you're listening to Vogue Network, and then, you know, the little vocal cues, the intro you hear, all that stuff before the show comes up, it's all in a Winamp playlist, because this whole thing is on Shoutcast, which runs through Vogue Network.

51
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:24,000
And it's like, oh my god, then Winamp wouldn't work. And I'm just like, is this it? Is my computer dying? Is this on its last legs? I don't know what to think. So, ugh.

52
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Yeah, I have to think about how I'm gonna fix that. Now, of course, we do have a live chat room every week. We do invite our live chatters to participate, live.voguenetwork.com.

53
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And Ron must suggest, use your gaming PC for Skype. Wouldn't work, because my gaming PC is way in the other room, and so they're not like next to each other, and I can't really like run that over.

54
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Now, the other backup plan he's just here, use your iPad if you have the right cable. I have done that before. There was a period of time where we were using the iPad, and I don't remember, I think it was another Windows XP issue or something, I was able to use the iPad to do it.

55
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:06,000
But, since I wasn't prepared for that, I don't have my cables, and I'm not gonna be able to get it while we're trying to do the show here, so unfortunately, we're just not gonna have Skype tonight, and I'll just have some time to figure this out.

56
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:21,000
If it's time up, it's time to finally upgrade this crap. Let's do it. And I kind of want to go to a laptop, because that would make the show very portable, which I think would be a great thing. We could do more event shows, like at places, you know, because we're making friends in the area and so forth.

57
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:45,000
But I'm worried about, like, you know, I have very specific 1990s needs in my PC, and these modern, these newfangled laptops you kids are into may not play it, and I've got to, so yeah, I just, I'm having a crisis, everybody. It's that kind of night tonight, so I hope you all will bear with me, so we'll figure it out.

58
00:05:46,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Anyway, good suggestions in chat here. Stoppy says, OLR brought to you by Netscape. Dude, Google Chrome won't even update on this computer anymore. It's like, I've abandoned you, so I just, I don't know what to do.

59
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:16,000
So yeah, so I'm going to have to figure this out, so at least I have a little time to do it, sort of, although I'm going to be going out of town on Wednesday, because I'm going to Dragon Con, and I hope to see you guys there at Dragon Con.

60
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:28,000
We'll talk a little more about that in a little bit, but I suppose since this is a gaming podcast, we should get into some gaming news. So let's start tonight by talking about the Super Nintendo Classic.

61
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Now, speaking of hot messes, that's true, I can feel a lot better about my own personal situation by just thinking, at least I'm not Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, or one of these retailers that offered the Super Nintendo Classic for pre-order on Monday, and I'm not sure there's a lot I need to say about that.

62
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm pretty sure many of you who are listening to this show probably tried to pre-order one at some point, and I would imagine 98% of you were unsuccessful.

63
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Now, here's a disclaimer. I'm not saying this to rub this in, because I seriously think I'm going to get screwed one way or another, but I actually got to pre-order one.

64
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Well, here's the thing. They went up at like 1030 at night on Monday at BestBuy.com. That's 1030 West Coast. I might have even been 11.

65
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And that's 1030 or 11 West Coast time. Now, luckily, I'm a bit of an insomniac, so I was up anyway, and so I'm on Twitter, and I see the tweets come in that, oh, the Super Nintendo Classic is up for pre-order, and I'm like, I'm going through these motions, I'm not going to be able to get one, duh duh duh, and well, I'll be damned, I got one.

66
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I got one on BestBuy.com, and I even got the email confirming it, I got a tracking number and all that good stuff, but then I have that little voice in the back of my head this whole time.

67
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So did those people at Walmart.com that pre-ordered a couple months ago, asshole, so nothing is for certain in this world.

68
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:07,000
So, theoretically, I have somehow managed to win this stupid, unnecessary game and actually pre-order a Super Nintendo Classic for now, but we'll see if that actually holds.

69
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I signed up for all the notifications for that stuff, so I got the notification on my phone, I even opened the page, but then I got to the page to order it, and I was like, I'm not fucking doing this.

70
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm just not. I'm like, you know what, I'm not fucking giving them the satisfaction of it, so fuck them, I'm not ordering that system.

71
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm tired of this bullshit. If it's readily available at the store, I may pick one up.

72
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
So one way of phrasing it could be, you have had it officially.

73
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I've had it, I'm done. It's not worth it. And honestly, watching the game, Star Fox 2 sounds pretty amazing, I watch the gameplay and I'm like, ehhhh.

74
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Well, the official ROM will dump immediately, so I'm not worried about that.

75
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:02,000
There's also been some side buys with the proto, and they have changed a significant amount, especially in regards to localization, it seems.

76
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
So I mean, it's cool, but I, you know...

77
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
No, I get it, I get it.

78
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm not giving them the satisfaction for this.

79
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:18,000
No, I get it, I totally get it, and I'm in this weird place because I'm like, well Rob, you should consider yourself lucky that you got one.

80
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
And then there's another part of me that's like, but do you really, though, have one?

81
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
This is the company that gives their systems to fucking GameStop.

82
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
ThinkGeek, you know, quote unquote, because they're the same fucking company.

83
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And they're like, yeah, you can buy one of those systems if you buy $200 worth of bullshit with it.

84
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Fuck them. Fuck them. Seriously.

85
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
They can produce those systems, they can produce those systems cheap, it's just a fucking Linux board in there.

86
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You can't tell me, oh we can't manufacture this shit in China. Bull fucking shit.

87
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
So, whatever. I'm not buying it.

88
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Well let me ask this question, because I feel like, you know, obviously, again, 98% of the internet is extraordinarily frustrated right now,

89
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
and that's probably a generous number that as high as 2% of the people that wanted one actually got to pre-order.

90
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I'm probably being really fucking generous with that number, because I don't have any actual stats.

91
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Here's my question is, to try to put a positive spin to it, Loki, and I know that's hard on these types of topics,

92
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:26,000
but realistically, important word, realistically, what can be done so this shit stops?

93
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Any thoughts?

94
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Produce enough systems. Don't just produce them for four months. Produce enough systems.

95
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
They do it for the fucking amiibos, they can do it for this.

96
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
They do it for other accessories that people don't buy much of.

97
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Why can't this be produced? What is so difficult about this?

98
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Nothing. So they need to not close it off this time like they did with the NES Classic.

99
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:00,000
What I still say, I still say, is because they fucking figured out how to put, how to backdoor a million other ROMs onto those things.

100
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
That is why they stopped production of those things.

101
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
They're gonna do that with this one too.

102
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Exactly, it's gonna happen with this one too.

103
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
They can do with everything. There's nothing you can do to prevent that.

104
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
You know how, no, actually there is nothing you can do to prevent that.

105
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I was gonna say, you know how you remove it? It's just take out the USB port.

106
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Nope, there's really nothing you can do about it because if people want to fucking hack that shit, they're gonna hack it.

107
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,000
If you put them on the chip, then obviously someone can put them on the chip as well, or they can take them off the chip.

108
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
It's not impossible.

109
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I think, okay, from my perspective, there's one very easy thing that should be done for this.

110
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
And that is that these retailers need to be using CAPTCHA.

111
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Or they need to be using more, these retailers need to do more to prevent the bots.

112
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
They need to stop that.

113
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:57,000
And I think the only reason why, you know, for all practical purposes, Best Buy stayed up for a good 20 minutes.

114
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I think that's better than most people were expecting when it comes to these preorders.

115
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Yes, I realize it was the middle of the night, but look, the West Coast is a big place.

116
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,000
There were still a lot of people that were going, you know, L.A. and all the people, Seattle, Portland, all the people on the West Coast.

117
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
There's Insomniacs on the East Coast, too. There were plenty of people gunning for those systems.

118
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:22,000
And the bots got tricked out of that one because the URL had changed, right?

119
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Which caused that whole bullshit where they didn't get the emails fired off for people that requested the emails when those go live.

120
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
And just the general bullshit of the fact that it went up in the middle of the night for most people.

121
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Which, you know, while, yes, it worked in my favor, sure, I can acknowledge the bullshit factor that it should have been something where they said,

122
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Wednesday at noon, it's happening and everybody's got a shot.

123
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Like, I don't think it's one of those things they should have snuck out there in the middle of the night.

124
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Like, I can acknowledge that. It was pretty bullshit in that regard.

125
00:12:51,000 --> 00:13:01,000
But, like, why are bots allowed to order these things? We've got to do more about bots ordering this shit.

126
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You gotta ask Nintendo, though, what's the point? Why even put out the system in the first place if you're not going to produce enough units?

127
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Why even make it? Like, if you're so, like, dissatisfied at the fact that people hacked the NES Classic, why even double down and put out a Super NES Classic?

128
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,000
What the hell is the point if you're not going to produce enough units? Why are you even doing it to get Nintendo's name out there?

129
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
You already have your name out there with a bunch of other things.

130
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
All you're doing is causing frustration because people are trying to give you money for this shit.

131
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
You don't have the fucking Virtual Console anymore. It's not out.

132
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:40,000
And whatever this other system that you're putting in place, which we still don't know fuck anything about, is still not here.

133
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Whenever the hell is that coming out, like, what the fuck are they doing? I mean, what's the point? Then don't manufacture that.

134
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
If they can't prevent the bots, then you know what? They need to go the route of Toys R Us.

135
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:00,000
And I'm actually going to applaud Toys R Us in this scenario. And the reason why I'm doing that is because Toys R Us just said, you know what? We're not taking pre-orders.

136
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:09,000
It's only going to be available in store the day it comes out. And you know what? At least I know with that particular method, there's not going to be fucking bots.

137
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Will there be scalpers? Of course there will be. There's going to be crazy fucking people that get there early, early, early and are going to fuck it up in that capacity.

138
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,000
But if every retailer was doing it this way, then those scalpers can't be at every single possible location.

139
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
If they limit it to one person, then that end of it is only going to go so far.

140
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:38,000
So I kind of think in that regard, Toys R Us is doing what they can, which is, you know what? We're not going to be able to handle the pre-order thing, so we're just not going to do it for anybody.

141
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
And I think that's probably the best thing to do for them.

142
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Now as far as the scalper thing goes, here's the other thing. And I know I've ranted about this on the show before, so I'm going to try to just keep this brief, but I can't say this enough.

143
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:57,000
You have to stop buying from scalpers. You don't need the system that bad.

144
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:03,000
If Nintendo wants you to have one, you'll be able to get one through official channels.

145
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:11,000
If the scalpers can't sell them, then they're not going to be shitting up the market with the bots and all this other stuff.

146
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
It's a Linux computer running an emulator.

147
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:20,000
They do this because, but it's still a collectible. Loki, that's in a way, I'm going to be real, that's an elitist defense.

148
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
It's the whole like, well if you knew more about computers, you could do this and do this, all this stuff.

149
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Some people want the collectible. They still want it because it's an official Nintendo product, they want to go through the official channels.

150
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I still stand with you in the fact that before I buy from a scalper, I would do that.

151
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:47,000
And I said that on a previous episode. I will steal the ROMs and put them on one of these little machines before I ever buy from a scalper.

152
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:55,000
And you know what? If Nintendo decides to cut it off again before you're able to get one through official channels, hey, go for it.

153
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
As much as I think piracy hurts things and all this stuff, go for it.

154
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I support you in doing that. If Nintendo is going to say, nope, nope, no more, we're going to end it, then go for it.

155
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
That's kind of where my head is at with that.

156
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
But anyway, you've got to stop buying from scalpers.

157
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:18,000
And yes, I knew the whole argument about, well Rob, if I don't do it, someone's going to buy it and that whole thing, but you don't understand.

158
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:27,000
You need to also tell other people and you need to be like, if somebody tells you, oh yeah, I got one through a scalper, dude, that's not cool.

159
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Like here I thought you were lucky, but you're just kind of, you're jerking the system.

160
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
In the end though, you can't tell people what to do. End of story.

161
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I can't, but I'm going to say this is a problem as long as that exists.

162
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,000
You are enabling. I can say you, you are free to do that, but you enabled this.

163
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:52,000
But that's not the other part of it too. The whole thing is that there is going to be somebody, there's a sucker born every minute.

164
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Sure.

165
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:03,000
You'd have to instead make it to where the scalping itself is more difficult.

166
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
It's not necessarily the people that are doing it because people will go to extremes.

167
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
We, hello, why does intervention exist? Okay.

168
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:19,000
People will go to extremes. People will take advantage of people who will go to extremes.

169
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
It's like dealing with an addict, right?

170
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:29,000
You have to cut down the source of the addiction and then treat the problem.

171
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
You have to get somebody clean before you can treat their problem.

172
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
And so you'd have to instead target the scalpers.

173
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
And, you know, ostracize them, chase them out, send law enforcement after them.

174
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
If you see it happening, report it if you want something to be done about it.

175
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Don't go attacking the people who are being taken advantage of.

176
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I agree to an extent. There's kind of like a pyramid of responsibility here.

177
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
The person most at fault in this scenario is Nintendo, period.

178
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Nintendo is creating this fucking problem. Nintendo needs to fucking fix it.

179
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
And journalists out there need to hold them fucking accountable for this and the NES Classic.

180
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
How about this? This also will help too.

181
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
All the media sites out there talking about how quickly this shit sells out

182
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
and running all these stupid articles about how the system's selling out

183
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
and Nintendo is being ridiculous for this stuff.

184
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Just stop covering it. Stop giving them the fucking attention.

185
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
They create this circus so the circus is covered.

186
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
There's no money in that.

187
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
But people click on those stories, unfortunately.

188
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
So the pyramid of responsibility. Nintendo, number one.

189
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
The websites, number two. And they need to fix that and they need to prevent the bots and all that.

190
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,000
But ultimately, the people creating the demand have responsibility.

191
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
And I'm pointing that out.

192
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,000
But that's leading back to the revenue generated on those clickbait websites.

193
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Agreed.

194
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
So that's also leading back to Nintendo seeing that this is a potential money maker by building hype.

195
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:04,000
It's more or less, in the long run, if you really want to point to the true blame and everything,

196
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:10,000
it's the fact that we are living in a fairly uncontrolled capitalist society.

197
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
It's capitalism. Pure and simple.

198
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
It goes back to the same philosophy.

199
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
You know, you create the demand and you do whatever you can to keep the demand going.

200
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Which creates revenue, which lines pockets, which then goes back into the economy, blah blah blah.

201
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I'm not going to go into the year and a half of economics I shoved in my brain.

202
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:43,000
But it really is more of a societal urge.

203
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,000
And I do agree with that, which is why when it came to the NES Classic, I said,

204
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
OK, I'm not able to get one through normal means. I don't need one that bad.

205
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I'm not going to buy one. I'm not going to go through these other channels to do it.

206
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
And it's the same thing if, for whatever reason, the Super Nintendo thing falls through and I'm not able to get one through normal means.

207
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I don't need one that bad.

208
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,000
And see, it's more or less a conditioning of society in general.

209
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
We are conditioned, well, look at the 80s, OK?

210
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Let's just stop right there and look at the fucking 80s.

211
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Everything, it was me, me, me, I need to have, I need to acquire.

212
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Look at the movies that were out then.

213
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
You know, how materialism was really pushed.

214
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
And our society is built on a sense of materialism.

215
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Our whole economy is built on materialism.

216
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Acquire, acquire, gain this. If you have this and no one else does, you're special.

217
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:40,000
And to point blame and to say, how do we fix this?

218
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
The only fix is re-educating people.

219
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:51,000
And what I was trying to say with the whole putting the people who buy these things from scalpers responsible is I'm just trying to say,

220
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
oh, you got that from a scalper? You're not special.

221
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
And that's what I'm going to say.

222
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
And that's just, you know, what I'm choosing to do as a response is that that enables that whole thing.

223
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
So if you got it from a scalper, you're not special.

224
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
And just the thing that I think needs to be a bigger push in society.

225
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
And I hate to phrase it this way, but I think it's the first step.

226
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:20,000
The first thing that people need to understand in their hearts that will stop pretty much all of this from going on

227
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
is that the things that you own, own you.

228
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Let me go to some comments from our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

229
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
SSG100Matt says, we're getting too deep here.

230
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
She right though.

231
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Also, come on, Noel Gustin Chat says, if I'm lucky enough to find one at the retail price, then we'll probably buy it.

232
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I refuse to even consider buying one of those crazy ass $300 ThinkGeek bundles.

233
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Oh, my God. I mean, let's just put that on the list of reasons why I don't set foot in a GameStop anymore.

234
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Because I don't need that soon to be on dollar store shelves merchandise.

235
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
See, here's why they do that with hardware.

236
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Hardware, there is no margin.

237
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
It's like literally two bucks, you lose that in shipping.

238
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
So you're literally selling that either at cost or at a loss.

239
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
You make it up with software.

240
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
These systems though, I don't know if that same kind of margin exists.

241
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I would think that it doesn't.

242
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I would be willing to bet that the hardware that's in these new ones are probably the same as the old ones.

243
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,000
So the extra $20 that they've made up there, I mean, there's got to be some margin in there.

244
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:32,000
But, let's just say assuming that it's like that, that's why they throw this extra crap in there.

245
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Then again, this is also GameStop, so they just do it because they're also greedy as fuck as well.

246
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Because they know people will be tempted and people will buy it.

247
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
It's not really just them.

248
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
It's every company out there.

249
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
They know people want it.

250
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
They'll do what they can to make people want it.

251
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
And then they'll do whatever they take to get the money out of them.

252
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:00,000
That's not solely for one company versus others.

253
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
In the end, they all have the same goal, get your money.

254
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:10,000
We have to really encourage ourselves to fight that instinct of, I'll be a special snowflake if I have one.

255
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:16,000
And we have to fight that instinct and say, you know what, it's not worth buying this crap bundle from ThinkGeek to get one.

256
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,000
If I can find one at retail price on my terms, the consumer's terms, then cool.

257
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
But if I can't find that, then fuck it.

258
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
We just have someone who lets us know when they get them in.

259
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
So that's how we got our nest.

260
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:37,000
And on top of that, our legit reason for not really needing it, having the Star Fox 2 would be cool.

261
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:46,000
But our thought, the reason, the only reason that we wanted one is so that we could have the digital hookup without having the lag with our HDTV.

262
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Yeah, HDMI, that whole thing.

263
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:52,000
So that was, that's really our sole reason for really wanting it at all.

264
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,000
But other than that, we've got a SNES and we have an EverDrive.

265
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,000
In the long run, SNES plus EverDrive equals all of this shit.

266
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
But think about how short sighted this shit is with these systems.

267
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I mean, seriously, like they should just be releasing a virtual console system that can tap into the eShop to buy virtual console games or that can subscribe to that service and then push that shit out there like crazy.

268
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Because that's what fucking Netflix and these other companies do.

269
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Like they literally will pay for the system.

270
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Like if you're signing up for example, like Sling or something like that, they will literally give you a credit for the device that plays that shit on your TV.

271
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
They make money on planned obsolescence.

272
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
So do what Microsoft's doing.

273
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Because they have the Xbox game anywhere thing now.

274
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
That plays a lot of the 360 games for Xbox One, right?

275
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Well, even more so because like this is more for like, you'll get as many systems out there because then you can get people paying you even more money.

276
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
If you're worried about that, you're not making enough of a margin off of these systems.

277
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Like let's just say Nintendo, let's just throw it out there that Nintendo is not producing a lot of these because they're not making money off of them.

278
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
They're kind of coming at a loss or something like that.

279
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Whatever. Which is still their stupid idea because they're producing them so who they have the blame for that themselves.

280
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:19,000
But it's another opportunity to get more money and at the same time people will be able to buy more games.

281
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
People want to put more ROMs on there.

282
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Learn from your fucking users.

283
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
People bought them and they wanted more ROMs on there.

284
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Okay, cool. Give them an opportunity to purchase more ROMs.

285
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
What is the problem?

286
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
But do it cheaply. Add like bundles and shit.

287
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
So that way it's more of an impulse buy.

288
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
It ended up like how it is with my PlayStation Network library, my Steam library.

289
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Where it's like, oh hey that looks cool.

290
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I buy it, I may not play it, but I don't even think about it.

291
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I just like, oh that's a great deal, I'm gonna pick that up.

292
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
And it's just so easy for me to drop money on that stuff.

293
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Make it that easy.

294
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Instead of this fucking obstacle course of shit that you're making it for all these users.

295
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Because eventually people are gonna get fucking tired of your shit.

296
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Alright, well look, I don't want too much salt in the opening moments of Orange Lounge Radio here tonight.

297
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,000
But I think the reality is that a lot of people, again, most people couldn't get one this week.

298
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I think there is a lot of saltiness out there right now.

299
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:20,000
So I think we've all been able to vent a little bit and I hope Nintendo can figure it the hell out.

300
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
But at the same time I hope the industry can kind of hold Nintendo accountable.

301
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:31,000
And I hope people in the journalism arena will ask Nintendo some of these hard questions about why do you keep doing this to your fans.

302
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
And they'll fucking dodge it like Reggie does every fucking time.

303
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Everybody plays so fucking nice and plays into this.

304
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
And we need some people out there that will ask harder questions.

305
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
It's just ridiculous.

306
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
I'll be the asshole to ask questions.

307
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
But we all know what happens.

308
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I know the chat comments are about to come in.

309
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
And this is why Reggie never comes on your show.

310
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I understand. But I need other people.

311
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Well, he also doesn't know we exist.

312
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I need other people out there.

313
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Somebody got two questions.

314
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
That was Rama. An event got two questions. Remember that?

315
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
We had an exclusive interview.

316
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
But anyway, all that joking aside.

317
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
People need to fucking hold Nintendo accountable.

318
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Look, I get it. We all love Nintendo products.

319
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
They've created some of the most memorable characters over the years.

320
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
They create some damn addicting games.

321
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
I get it. But at the same time,

322
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
this hardware shortage shit has been going on since the 90s.

323
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
And they know it works.

324
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
They're exploiting your love. Seriously.

325
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
It's a tried and true tactic.

326
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
It's time for people to stand up and shut it down, for God's sake.

327
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
It's a fucking abusive relationship.

328
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Rob, are we going to break the wheel?

329
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Nintendo's on top. Then Sega's on top.

330
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Anyway, well Sonic Mania is pretty good on the Switch, though.

331
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Now where does that put us?

332
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Alright, look. Anyway.

333
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Well, Sonic Mania was made by Sonic fans anyway.

334
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
That is very true. Very true.

335
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Anyway, we're going to go ahead and move on with the show

336
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
and get into our gaming weeks.

337
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
So what types of video games have you been playing this week?

338
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Did you revisit a Super Nintendo classic this week?

339
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Or has it been something else?

340
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I did.

341
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
How about that? Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

342
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
I did. I played Super Mario World last night.

343
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Because someone's like, well, you do the level.

344
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
And I'm like, okay, I'll do the level. Fuck.

345
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
And did the level. And guess what?

346
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
You did the thing.

347
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
I was fussing because I was like,

348
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
why didn't you go get the green Switch house or Switch block?

349
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
And they're like, oh, we haven't gotten there yet.

350
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I was like, well, give it to me. I'll do it.

351
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
And I didn't do it.

352
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
But I did clean the level instead.

353
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
And then I tripped over the cable and unplugged the Super Nintendo.

354
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
And that was my Super Nintendo-ing.

355
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
What level was it? Now you got me curious.

356
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
It was like early on in the game.

357
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
We had just started.

358
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Oh, okay.

359
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
And then I played all my iOS stuff.

360
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
So not really a whole bunch of anything.

361
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I still have yet to reinstall my Mass Effect Andromeda

362
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
since it got fucked up.

363
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Oh, yes.

364
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
And they have that patch now, the last patch,

365
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Cody Fingers, that I suppose is worth visiting.

366
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I need to sit down with that again on PlayStation 4

367
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
now that it's where it's at.

368
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Because I kind of said, all right,

369
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
if they're going to keep making changes to this game,

370
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I'm going to step away from it for a little while.

371
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
And I'll come back when all the patches are there.

372
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Well, now that they're there, I really do owe the game

373
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
a complete playthrough.

374
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I was near the end, but I just didn't finish it.

375
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Well, although it was funny.

376
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
I was actually thinking about a YouTuber

377
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
yesterday at lunch who does,

378
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
in fact, trying to get him on the show,

379
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Game Tim, who does cooking with Cookie Mama.

380
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Yeah, I think we were talking to him,

381
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
but then our unexpected hiatus came up.

382
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
So we're going to work that out. Yeah.

383
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I went to get Korean food yesterday,

384
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
and I'm going to mispronounce it,

385
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
but I think it's called Haemil Peijong,

386
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
which is like a seafood pancake.

387
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
And he did that on Cooking with Cookie Mama.

388
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
And I was like, oh, that makes me think about his channel.

389
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
And I was like, I'm a nerd.

390
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Yes, you are. All right.

391
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
It was pretty fun.

392
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
All right.

393
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
That's really the extent of my gaming week.

394
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Let's check in with Loki. How was your gaming week?

395
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
First off, I'd like to say dinner is fucking terrible,

396
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
and I threw it away.

397
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I took one bite of that,

398
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
and you'll definitely be able to relate with this.

399
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I took a bite of the hamburger.

400
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
All I could taste,

401
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
and I'm going to try not to make you sick here,

402
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
warm mayonnaise.

403
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Yeah, exactly. I threw it fucking away.

404
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Just, no. Yeah.

405
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
That's why I always... French fries were fucking stale,

406
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
and somehow this tastes like diet root beer,

407
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
which I don't think they have,

408
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
but it tastes like fucking watered-down shit.

409
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Do you need juice or something from the fridge?

410
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
You know what, though?

411
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
At the very least, I got a vanilla milkshake from them,

412
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
and that was good.

413
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
All right, at least there's that.

414
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
So I'm going to have vanilla milkshake for dinner.

415
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
That'll be fucking dinner.

416
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Anyways, so no actual games.

417
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I did play an actual game this week.

418
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I went back to my Steam library

419
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
because I had been watching the movie,

420
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
and I built the Legos and stuff,

421
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
so I went and played the Lego movie video game,

422
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
and actually found out that was pretty fun.

423
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
I mean, honestly, they're all about the same.

424
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Tons of clips thrown in from the movie and stuff.

425
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
You know, lots of humor.

426
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
It's kind of funny.

427
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I enjoyed it, so I played a little bit of that.

428
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,000
And then I actually didn't play a whole lot of other things.

429
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I thought about putting on...

430
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I was actually going to play some VR stuff this week,

431
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
but then my wife wanted to watch TV,

432
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
and so that kind of...

433
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Well, now that I think of it, what the fuck?

434
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I would have a VR headset,

435
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
but it doesn't really matter.

436
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Oh, whatever. Hindsight.

437
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
So I ended up researching on how to set up a Raspberry Pi

438
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,000
for RetroPie, so I've been downloading everything for that

439
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
since I have a Raspberry Pi to do that.

440
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Just haven't gotten around to it.

441
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Although, I do need to fix my 3D printer

442
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
to print a shell for it

443
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
so that it has something to sit on for now.

444
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I mean, because I probably need to put it in something

445
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
so it doesn't short itself out.

446
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
And then just, you know, selfling games.

447
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
And, you know, that's about it, pretty much.

448
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Okay.

449
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
My gaming week.

450
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
So there is a new game I played this week.

451
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Mostly been a lot of the same old, like, classics

452
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
that I play all the time,

453
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
but I did play one new game this week,

454
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
and in fact, it was the game that I played

455
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
after Orange Lounge Radio last week,

456
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
because usually on Sunday nights,

457
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
right after Orange Lounge Radio is finished,

458
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I'll go on my Twitch channel and I'll play something.

459
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
We've done things like Splatoon and Mario Kart

460
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
that I play with viewers,

461
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
but last week I was like,

462
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
well, I want to do, I want to do, like, an indie game

463
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
and I've been hearing a lot about this game,

464
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
so let's do, like, a new game

465
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
and me play it for the first time.

466
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
So the game I did after the show last week

467
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
was a game called 20XX, or 20XX.

468
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Oh yeah, that looks pretty good.

469
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
2000XX, I'm not sure how you...

470
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
20XX, it's just like in Mega Man 2?

471
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Yeah, in the intro.

472
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
20XD6.

473
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Yeah, yeah, basically, 20XDX.

474
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Oh yeah, I think I'm going to call it that, 20XDX.

475
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
But anyway, that was the game I played,

476
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
and it's really cool.

477
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Yeah, it's basically, it's a Mega Man-ish game

478
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
and there's a lot, like, even in the intro sequences.

479
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Roguelite, I guess.

480
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Wow, there's a lot.

481
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Yeah, it's a Mega Man roguelike.

482
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,000
So instead of necessarily picking the different boss stages,

483
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
you kind of start in the first level

484
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
and you're going through,

485
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
and if you're able to survive all the way to the boss,

486
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
then you fight the boss,

487
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
and then you can pick, do you want the boss weapon

488
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
or do you want, you know, extra currency

489
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
or, like, extra energy pack or something?

490
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
And then you can pick one of three branching paths

491
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
and you will see who the boss is and what the stage is,

492
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
but then you kind of have to go from there.

493
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
And each level that you go,

494
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
the difficulty of the level starts to amp up a little bit.

495
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
But then once you die, you're dead

496
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
and you're back to the central hub,

497
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
where, like a lot of roguelikes,

498
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
if you've ever played things like Rogue Legacy,

499
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Crypt of the Necrodancer, you know,

500
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
all these games have a very similar formula.

501
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
So once you die, you go back to the hub

502
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
where you can buy, like, sometimes temporary power-ups,

503
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
good for your next run,

504
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
permanent power-ups, which will help you

505
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
and give you an advantage the next time.

506
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
And then that's how, the next time you play,

507
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
you can hopefully go a little further in the game.

508
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
So, and there's even more to this game

509
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
that I didn't even really get a chance to explore.

510
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Like, I know there's co-op in it,

511
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
didn't even really touch that.

512
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
There's challenge modes available in it

513
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
that I didn't really get a chance to touch,

514
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
just because I have been enjoying the single-player campaign

515
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
and I had a great time streaming that on Twitch last week

516
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
and it seemed like a lot of you really responded to that, too.

517
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
I think some of you told me you were gonna buy it.

518
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
So I was like, tell the developers.

519
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Maybe they don't want to come on OLR.

520
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Well, that's, you know, this is like

521
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
kind of what Mighty No. 9 should have been.

522
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Yes, actually, yes.

523
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
And so a lot of people responding very positively to this game,

524
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
and I gotta say, you know, I mean, is it perfect?

525
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I mean, no, because sometimes the randomness of the levels

526
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
does feel a little bit,

527
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,000
I feel like I'm doing some of the same-sy jumping patterns

528
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
and some of these things, like, over and over,

529
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
which, you know, in a regular Mega Man game,

530
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
you expect that, because Mega Man's all about fucking patterns.

531
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
But in a roguelike, you kind of hope there'd be a little more randomness.

532
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
But I'm really, I'm being very nitpicky with that statement.

533
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I think, overall, I am enjoying it,

534
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
and overall, like, the, you know, just the discovery of the game

535
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
and going a little deeper every time and some of the boss fights

536
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
and how they can change and be different.

537
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Like, I just, I was really enjoying it.

538
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
And here's the other thing.

539
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
The price is great. It was only 12 bucks.

540
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Now, I think I bought it on some type of launch week sale

541
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
that's probably not there anymore,

542
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
but I think the quote-unquote real price is like $15.99.

543
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Like, I don't think it's much more expensive than what I paid for it.

544
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
So I recommend it.

545
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Like, if you like Mega Man and you like roguelikes, you know,

546
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I know some people that are like,

547
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
I hate roguelikes, but I kind of feel like

548
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,000
you're dismissing a really broad genre by saying you hate roguelikes.

549
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
You know what I mean?

550
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Like, is there one or two that you play that you didn't like

551
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
and you're kind of dismissing the genre?

552
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Because I kind of think your love of Mega Man

553
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
will erase any reservations you have about roguelikes.

554
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Does that make sense?

555
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Yeah.

556
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Like, the Mega Man aspect is much more than the rogue side of it.

557
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,000
So that's kind of my thoughts on it.

558
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Looking in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com,

559
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
just trying to see, Stoppy says,

560
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I've been playing 20XDX since Early Access.

561
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
It's great. They've come a long way.

562
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
The improvements were notable.

563
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
It's funny to think Mighty No. 9 backers

564
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
would have been happier with this tribute game.

565
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Sjoan Hunter-Matt says Mighty No. 9 didn't have to be like 20XDX.

566
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Mighty No. 9 is great on its own.

567
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
It's just the delay saga poisoned the game for everyone.

568
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Give Mighty No. 9 a chance.

569
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,000
So, and actually, I still have, I got Mighty No. 9.

570
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
I don't know if it was in a humblebo-

571
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
No, I bought it on a Steam sale.

572
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
It was like five bucks during a Steam sale.

573
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
I just, I still haven't played it yet.

574
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
So, that's also on my list of things.

575
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
You know, because I value what some of our longtime listeners

576
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
like Sjoan Hunter-Matt, who's been listening for years and years, say.

577
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
And if he says, you know what, you really need to just like

578
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
don't listen to this hype and just give it a chance.

579
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
I'm willing to give it a chance.

580
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
And it's, it probably really isn't as bad as most people say,

581
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
but it's probably also not quite the Mega Man clone game

582
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
people were hoping for.

583
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
But maybe if you were disappointed in Mighty No. 9,

584
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
maybe there'll be something in 20XDX that will work for you.

585
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
You know? And maybe the reverse is even true.

586
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
If you really do hate roguelikes that much

587
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
and 20XDX doesn't work for you, maybe Mighty No. 9,

588
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
you should give a second chance, if that makes sense.

589
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,000
So, but anyway, overall, my opinion on 20XDX, very favorable,

590
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
especially because of the fact that it is such a low cost.

591
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
It does feel more homegrown and indie developed.

592
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
I think it's a very like fleshed out great game

593
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
and it's definitely worth a look if you're into that genre at all.

594
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:36,000
My only concern, I hope it's not too close to Mega Man

595
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
where Capcom's gonna rear their head.

596
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
I hope, instead, Capcom may see the message here

597
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
from the success of this game and go,

598
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
maybe we shouldn't have canceled Mega Man Universe

599
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
because maybe that's what that game was supposed to be.

600
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
I don't know.

601
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
But maybe we should revisit this franchise

602
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,000
because I bet if Capcom did an official Mega Man release,

603
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
and I mean new release,

604
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
I don't mean yet another legacy collection with some...

605
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Just do like a Sonic Mania release.

606
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Yeah. Seriously. Seriously.

607
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Well, they've done that before.

608
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Capcom should listen the fuck up to how people respond to Sonic Mania.

609
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Didn't they have a free Mega Man Street Fighter game or something like that?

610
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Yeah, but that wasn't even Capcom.

611
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
I think Capcom kind of blessed it.

612
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
I think they had to.

613
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
I think Capcom kind of said,

614
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,000
we're gonna just kind of turn around and not really pay attention to this.

615
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
No, I think they may have even endorsed it on their blog.

616
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
They did on their blog.

617
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
They did. So I guess they didn't acknowledge it.

618
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
But I think it was one of those very clear like,

619
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
this is a fan game, we're allowing it.

620
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,000
So maybe because of that, that sets a good precedent

621
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
that Capcom is not gonna try to shut this down.

622
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
And I hope they don't.

623
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
And I think there are enough differences where if it...

624
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
I mean the whole fact that it isn't...

625
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
It's not taking away from anything that they're doing.

626
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
If anything, it's making people more excited about their games.

627
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,000
The fact that it is a roguelike does change the basics of the game dramatically.

628
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
And I think that's enough to get it out of any hot water with Capcom.

629
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
I think the fact that it is a roguelike is going to kind of separate it enough.

630
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Because like I said, the original Mega Man games

631
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
are all about memorizing those fucking patterns on how to get through the level.

632
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
You can't really do that with this game.

633
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
So I mean there are some of those fundamental differences there.

634
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
You know what would be awesome is like a Mega Man game

635
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:22,000
where you have like power-ups from other like Capcom characters.

636
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Like you know the Bionic arm from Bionic Commando.

637
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Well remember in that early Mega Man universe trailer

638
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
there was the whole like Ryu showed up.

639
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Or Mega Man threw a fireball or something.

640
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Yeah, but that's been there since like X.

641
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
So I mean, I don't know.

642
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Yeah, who knows. Who knows.

643
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
So anyway, that was the new game I played this week and I enjoyed.

644
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Otherwise it's just been kind of like old favorites.

645
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Still been playing Overwatch, Final Fantasy XIV, Diablo III.

646
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
I randomly played Heroes of the Storm again.

647
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
I don't know. Oh, I know what it was.

648
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,000
I was watching my buddy Delvin who does another podcast called Video Game Realness.

649
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
They don't put out a ton of episodes. They put out one recently.

650
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
And he also does some video game streaming out there.

651
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
So I was watching his channel and he was playing League of Legends

652
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
and we were having a little bit of a chat about League of Legends.

653
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
I was kind of talking about some of my hesitations with that game.

654
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
But he was having fun with it.

655
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
And it did kind of make me go,

656
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
well maybe I should see what's going on in Heroes of the Storm.

657
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
It's been a little while.

658
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:14,000
And now that there's no like active play this game a lot to get a D.Va suit

659
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
or you know some of those things that Blizzard was doing

660
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
to get more people to play Heroes of the Storm.

661
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
I feel like I can just kind of go into an AI game and just play it and be satisfied.

662
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
And I'm doing those little quests to earn a little bit of gold.

663
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
And I'm perfectly content doing that.

664
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
And I don't feel pressure because it's not PvP.

665
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
And you know, yeah, I'm having fun.

666
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
So I'm not playing a lot of it.

667
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
But I'm playing just enough to kind of go,

668
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,000
oh yeah, this is a fun little different type of game to play to decompress a little bit.

669
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,000
And who knows, maybe in the coming weeks I will feel adventurous enough

670
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
that I'll go in and I'll try a PvP match again.

671
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Just right now I'm a little bit hesitant on that with Heroes of the Storm.

672
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
But I wanted to see, they actually put D.Va in as a hero in Heroes of the Storm.

673
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
I think they put Genji in too.

674
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
They put some more Warcraft and Starcraft characters

675
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,000
because Starcraft got its remaster.

676
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
That whole thing came out so, you know, people are paying attention to that.

677
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:09,000
I'm super curious, you know, starting this week actually,

678
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
I don't think it's on our showroll so I think I'm okay to talk about this.

679
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Starting this week, the Destiny 2, if you pre-, not even pre-ordered it people,

680
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,000
pre-purchased it, meaning you already gave them the full money,

681
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
you would be able to play the beta.

682
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Well no, you get, I'm sorry, you get one day early access to the open beta.

683
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
So if you pre-purchase you get that one day

684
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
and then the open beta is like the 29th through the,

685
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,000
I can't do the open beta because I fly out of town early morning on Thursday,

686
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
I can't do it.

687
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
So the beta won't be open, I won't be able to play it.

688
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:46,000
But of course Destiny 2 on PC is going to be in the Battle.net interface.

689
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:52,000
So that begs the question, would they go so far as to include a Destiny character

690
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
in Heroes of the Storm?

691
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I know some Blizzard people are like, shut up,

692
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
because Destiny is an Activision game, or a Bungie game,

693
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
it's not a Blizzard game.

694
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:06,000
And I'm like, well, that's not stopping them from showing up on Battle.net.

695
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
That's the first date.

696
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
That's first base.

697
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Who knows, Destiny 2 might get to second or third base.

698
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Is third base having a skin in your collector's edition

699
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
for like a World of Warcraft expansion or something?

700
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,000
I don't know, I think a home run would just be straight up like

701
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Blizzard develops Destiny 3.

702
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
I don't know, I'm going crazy.

703
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,000
But I think I wouldn't completely shut the door to that.

704
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
I mean, it is still all Activision at the end of the day, who knows.

705
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
ActDef suggests skins for Overwatch, maybe.

706
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,000
So maybe not characters, but maybe like an icon,

707
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
or one of those like sprays, or a banner,

708
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
maybe something a little more cosmetic.

709
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
I could see that.

710
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
I could definitely be something, so we'll see.

711
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Anyhow, let's move on.

712
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
We're going to get into some more gaming news,

713
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
but I do want to do some quick housekeeping and announcements

714
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
here at the top of the show.

715
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Quickly, I do want to mention that we're not going to be here next week.

716
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
This is a planned week off.

717
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
I've been saying this for forever.

718
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
But it is Labor Day weekend coming up,

719
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
which means we're going to be at Dragon Con.

720
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Sadly, Dark Soccer and Loki aren't able to take the trip out to Atlanta,

721
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
but this is going to be like my fifth Dragon Con.

722
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
I'm excited to be there with some of my other friends

723
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
from the Voice of Geeks Network,

724
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
including Bobby Blackwell will be there,

725
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
and Jon from Critical Myth is going to be there,

726
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Gary from Critical Myth is going to be there,

727
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Brian from British Invaders is going to be there.

728
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
That's everyone that I know of that's going,

729
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
and sometimes I run into random people.

730
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
On that Sunday, though, for people who can't make it,

731
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
if you're in the Sacramento area, is the Rainbow Festival.

732
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,000
So come downtown and show your support.

733
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
So no full LR next week either,

734
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
because you're going to be busy with that, right?

735
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
I probably will be back late enough,

736
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,000
or in enough time that I might be able to stream that night.

737
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Don't they have Tiffany or something performing?

738
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
They have 80s. I think they have Tiffany or something.

739
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
I'll have to look again.

740
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Yeah, I saw that and I laughed.

741
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
I was like, I would totally go to this if I was going to be in town.

742
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
But if I'm right, I think the main stage is hosted by

743
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Taron Through You again.

744
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Last year we had Detox, which was really cool.

745
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Yeah, I've seen Taron. She's a local drag queen.

746
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
I've seen her at Badlands before. She's good. She's good.

747
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
A lot of fun.

748
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,000
I hope I'm not wrong on this, but I think she's an older queen too.

749
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
So I think she gives old people like me hope.

750
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Anyway, my schedule at Dragon Con,

751
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
for those of you who are going to be meeting me in Atlanta,

752
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,000
you can check out one of four panels I'm going to be on at Dragon Con.

753
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,000
You can check out a panel called It's Just a Game,

754
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Social Contracts and Multiplayer Gaming.

755
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
These are all, by the way, on the podcast track.

756
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
So this does tie into podcasting.

757
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
That's going to be on a Friday at 1 p.m.

758
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
And I'm going to be joined by Bobby and Paul and Dennis

759
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
from Giant Size Team Up.

760
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,000
And we're going to have a talk about implied social contracts

761
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
and multiplayer gaming from the tabletop to the video screen.

762
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
So that's going to be interesting, kind of like how that

763
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
those social dynamics kind of translate into

764
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,000
what we're doing here in podcasting and so forth.

765
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
I think that could be very interesting.

766
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
So we're going to talk about that on Friday.

767
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Then I have a couple panels on Saturday.

768
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
On Saturday, we're going to be on this panel called,

769
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
and I say we because Bobby's going to be on this as well,

770
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
a panel called Getting the Word Out,

771
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Introducing Your Show to an Ever-Evolving Internet.

772
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
And, you know, since we've been doing OLR for 15 years,

773
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,000
we've seen Skype come and rise up.

774
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,000
We've seen Twitter come. We've seen Myspace come and go.

775
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
We've seen, you know, Facebook rise up.

776
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
So, you know, you kind of have to adjust to new social networks

777
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
as they come up.

778
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Twitch will be another big one, you know,

779
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
and kind of cater the promotion to your show

780
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
and kind of stay ahead of the curve on this stuff.

781
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Are you saying that GeoCities page is no longer good to get the word out?

782
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:47,000
It's probably as effective as continuing to use Windows XP to do your show.

783
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Anyway, I will be joined on that panel by, of course,

784
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Bobby, our friend Charles McFall from the Pokemon Go podcast,

785
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Dennis Lee Robinson, and Justin Robert Young,

786
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
who you guys know him from Night Attack,

787
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
if you ever heard that show.

788
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,000
So, I'm very honored to be on a panel with him and all those guys.

789
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Broadcasting and new media will be the other panel I'm on Saturday at 4 o'clock.

790
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,000
That is going to be a discussion where I'm going to be joined by Jay Patrick,

791
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
who's a radio broadcast vet of 20 years.

792
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
He's actually a program director for iHeartRadio,

793
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
so that'll be really cool.

794
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Oh, sorry, been a program director for iHeartRadio,

795
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Cumulus Media, and Saga Communications.

796
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
And so we'll talk a little bit about, you know, the on-air presence,

797
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
choosing your equipment, and talent best practices.

798
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,000
I have no idea what business I have being on this panel.

799
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
We use the very sophisticated Windows XP.

800
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
I know, I'm like, wait a minute.

801
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
It's classic, but it works.

802
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
I might be showing my quality.

803
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,000
I guess, but I did do college radio, and I've done, you know,

804
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Twitch and all that other stuff, so I guess I have some insight on that part.

805
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:51,000
But I definitely am going to be in the shadow of these speakers,

806
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,000
also on this panel, including Chris Gore,

807
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
as well as Jay Patrick and Charles McFall.

808
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
That'll be fun.

809
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
And then one more panel for you guys.

810
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,000
The very last panel, actually, Monday at 2.30.

811
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,000
The Ask a Podcaster Anything, the panel to end all panels.

812
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:11,000
It's basically the we are done with the weekend AMA type of panel.

813
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
And so that'll be fun.

814
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,000
So that is going to be the very last panel Monday at 2.30 p.m.

815
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Of course, I'll be popping into other stuff throughout the event,

816
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,000
but all of those panels at the Hilton Galleria 6,

817
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
that's a brand new room.

818
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
It used to be two years ago where the board gaming was

819
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
before they moved it to America Mart.

820
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
That whole basement is now more ballrooms, basically.

821
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
So that is where the podcast track is moved to.

822
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Are you going to have a ballroom blitz?

823
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
I hope so.

824
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Well, we have new neighbors this year.

825
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Our old neighbors were the Skeptics track and the EFF track,

826
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
which were both awesome tracks.

827
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Like, they're awesome.

828
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
But I am really excited about our new neighbors, too,

829
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
because our new neighbors, I believe, are moving over from the Sheraton.

830
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
So our new neighbors is the Trek track.

831
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
So that's going to be fun.

832
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
So I'm excited about that.

833
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
And this is another chance for me to say,

834
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Grandpa from the Starboard Power Coupling podcast,

835
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:03,000
well, I've been begging, begging to come to Dragon Con for like four years.

836
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Now I'm going to be like, and our neighbors are the fucking Trek track

837
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
and you're still not fucking here.

838
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Get with the program, Captain Matt.

839
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Anyway.

840
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
By the way, I did look it up.

841
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
And Tiffany will be.

842
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Yes.

843
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
And you won't be here.

844
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
I know.

845
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
And our queen this year is Peppermint.

846
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Yes, I heard that Peppermint was going to be there.

847
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
And Wendy Ho.

848
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
I know you love Peppermint.

849
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Peppermint was one of your faves from season nine.

850
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
I love Peppermint.

851
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
That's great.

852
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
You'll have fun.

853
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
And Frenchie Davis.

854
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Oh, my God.

855
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Wasn't she the one that was like kicked off Idol

856
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
and then she went on The Voice or something like that?

857
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Something like that.

858
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

859
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
That's funny.

860
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,000
I'm great that she still gets that coin from doing events like this.

861
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
That's cool.

862
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Anyway, what was I going to say about Dragon Con and all that?

863
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Oh, also important to plug, the Discord.

864
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,000
So if you're not going to Dragon Con, I'm sad, but I realize some.

865
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
You all have travel restrictions and stuff.

866
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,000
So you might want to check out our Discord channel,

867
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,000
which is Discord, excuse me, vognetwork.com slash Discord.

868
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
We actually have, we're going to have a temporary channel for Dragon Con.

869
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
We'll put some pictures.

870
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
We'll put some videos.

871
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,000
If you guys want to try to find us at the convention,

872
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
that's the best way to like chat us and find us.

873
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,000
And we'll post reminders of our upcoming panels and all that stuff in Discord.

874
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
I kind of envision that as a way for everybody on the ground at Discord

875
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
to be able to connect with each other.

876
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Because Dragon Con can be a very fluid, moving event,

877
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,000
especially because I'm hearing they're expecting more rain this year,

878
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
I think, than we've had in years past.

879
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,000
And I think that's because of the remnants of Hurricane Harvey

880
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,000
going on right now, which while I'm thinking about that,

881
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:39,000
please allow me to express, if any of our fam from OLR

882
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,000
and our listeners and folks you care about

883
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,000
are in the path of that hurricane, Corpus Christi and Houston

884
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
and all those cities there, we're really thinking of you guys right now.

885
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:53,000
I'm just horrible watching all that stuff on the news

886
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
and some of those photos that are coming out and so forth.

887
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:00,000
And I would definitely encourage folks to do more than just, you know,

888
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
send a thoughtful tweet and so forth.

889
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
I will try to do this as well.

890
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,000
If you can, donate, donate.

891
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
But not to the Red Cross.

892
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Investigate the, you know, in times like these when people's lives are on the line,

893
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
I want to donate to organizations that I know

894
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
where they're helping and on the front line.

895
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,000
But just investigate the charity that you want to do

896
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
and, you know, donate appropriately.

897
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,000
And just make sure that, you know, you can do what you can to help.

898
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:33,000
So I just, I feel really horrible for everything that's going on in Texas right now.

899
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Having flashbacks to the mid-90s when flooding was happening in my neighborhood,

900
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
and that was no fun to go through at all.

901
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:44,000
So it wasn't even nearly as bad as what's going on in Texas.

902
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
I can't even imagine.

903
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
So my thoughts are definitely with you guys.

904
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
All right.

905
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Let's move on to some gaming news, shall we?

906
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Let's get back to video games.

907
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Loki.

908
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Yeah, so I guess this is Half-Life reconfirmed,

909
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,000
or at least what it would have been, sort of.

910
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Mark Laidlaw, you may remember, recently left Valve.

911
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:15,000
He put out kind of a storyline or like a piece of writing on his blog, actually.

912
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,000
He's changed some of the names to protect the innocent.

913
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:24,000
But he does have a post on there that's basically a letter from Gordon Freeman

914
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:30,000
writing to Alex Vance and talking about the events that happened after Half-Life 2 Episode 2.

915
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Of course, recently he's had to kind of change some of those.

916
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:40,000
So now, of course, Gordon Freeman is now Gertie Fremont,

917
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,000
and Alex Vance is Alex Vont and stuff like that.

918
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
G-Man is Mrs. X.

919
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
But you can kind of draw the similarities there.

920
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:58,000
So if you want to check it out, it's at marklaidlaw.com slash apestle-3.

921
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,000
I'm sure if you just go to the main site, you'll probably find it.

922
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
And of course, you know, everybody's kind of like,

923
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:07,000
oh my God, you know, now we can kind of see what would have happened.

924
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:13,000
And since I have no context whatsoever with Half-Life having, sadly,

925
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:17,000
not played the first or second game, even though I do own them,

926
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:21,000
they sit in the vault of unplayed games in my Steam library,

927
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:26,000
I wouldn't even be able to tell you about what the hell this is.

928
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:31,000
But I'm sure the people that do play Half-Life are probably pretty excited about this

929
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
and disappointed at the same time.

930
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
I was going to say, I don't know if it's excitement,

931
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,000
because it's kind of that disappointment of this game may never happen.

932
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
So I don't know.

933
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Yeah, it is kind of disappointing.

934
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:45,000
But I also kind of got the sense that it may not actually be the plot of a Half-Life 3.

935
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Like, it may be a rejected plot type of thing.

936
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Like, this was one idea I had written down, and it's not what we went with.

937
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,000
I mean, if you consider how long this game has been in development,

938
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,000
if it's been in development, let's just pretend it has been,

939
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
if you consider how long this game has been in development,

940
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,000
it's fully possible that the story they were originally going with

941
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
isn't going to match the story they were going to end with.

942
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Hello, Final Fantasy XV.

943
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Right?

944
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
So, I mean, it's very possible things change,

945
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,000
and maybe this is some, like, old story that isn't happening anymore.

946
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
So, who knows? Maybe. Maybe.

947
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Anyway, I do just want to acknowledge, over in our chat room,

948
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,000
over at live.vognetwork.com, some people saying that your mic is going in and out.

949
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Great. Just what we need now.

950
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
It's awesome.

951
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,000
There's another thing breaking down.

952
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
That's just another mic I'll have to buy.

953
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
And, no, that's the same one you've always had,

954
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
so just make sure your thumb isn't hitting that power,

955
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
because that power switch is really sensitive on that.

956
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
I'm touching the power switch.

957
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
You may have to kind of make sure this bottom portion is connected.

958
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,000
I know it's stupid, but we'll just, why not?

959
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Only the best quality microphones for our podcast.

960
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Why not? I've got to replace computers.

961
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
But these mics are, what, six years old?

962
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,000
No, it's whenever Brad from, actually, yeah, it is probably that old,

963
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,000
because Brad from Pod Culture sent these over

964
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,000
when we were in the apartment studio.

965
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,000
So it's at least four, you know, because we've been in this house for three years.

966
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
So about four years, probably.

967
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
So it's probably time. It's probably time, but...

968
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,000
I'll just replace my own mic when it starts going out, so don't worry.

969
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,000
I still think I have my Behringer mic.

970
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Great.

971
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
So I'll bring it back.

972
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Well, we'll figure that out, but unfortunately, since it is live,

973
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
I can't be like, stop the show, let's replace it.

974
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,000
It'll just, Loki will kind of fan through best he can there.

975
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
And I'll just add that to the list.

976
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Things broken in the studio.

977
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Whatever.

978
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Why not?

979
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
While I'm about to go on a panel about how to be your most professional,

980
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:29,000
while you're doing all your voices on the radio.

981
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
All right, well, moving on.

982
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
So let's talk about Gamescom a little bit,

983
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,000
and Microsoft really kind of had a lot of the news out of Gamescom,

984
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,000
because, of course, they're pushing the Xbox One X.

985
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,000
And the Xbox One X, of course, is on its way out in November.

986
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:49,000
And there was some talk about here is how to transfer your data

987
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,000
from the Xbox One to the Xbox One X,

988
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,000
because it is anticipated that there are, you know,

989
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,000
hardcore Microsoft fans out there who want to take their Xbox Ones

990
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
and basically upgrade to an Xbox One X.

991
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
So they'll be taking their data and transferring it over.

992
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Why not?

993
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,000
I did the same thing with PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 4 Pro,

994
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
which I regret doing.

995
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,000
But, you know, some folks may have better luck

996
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,000
when it comes to Microsoft and the Xbox One.

997
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
So anyway, there's several ways to do it.

998
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,000
You can back up your user settings on an external drive,

999
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,000
and then you can take the external drive over to the Xbox One X.

1000
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:27,000
You can also patch games and then transfer them using an external drive,

1001
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
same way, you know, that again.

1002
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,000
But you can also transfer data over the home network.

1003
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,000
And that was what you could do with PlayStation 4 or PlayStation 4 Pro,

1004
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
just plan on, at least on the PlayStation.

1005
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
It took a few hours to do that.

1006
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,000
So if you're going to do that with the Microsoft Xbox,

1007
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,000
be sure that you put ample time aside for that process to happen.

1008
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,000
But that'll probably be the easiest way to do it for most people,

1009
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,000
is to just use the magic of your home network

1010
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,000
to transfer that information over.

1011
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,000
I know that, you know, we didn't talk a lot about it

1012
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
in the intro to the show tonight,

1013
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:03,000
but I know that those pre-orders went up as well,

1014
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,000
and they went pretty fast.

1015
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
But most people aren't complaining about that.

1016
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Well, we talked about that last week

1017
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
because that was kind of part of their little presentation.

1018
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Oh, yeah, that's right, that's right.

1019
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
It had come up right after Sunday.

1020
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
I guess I was just seeing more of the social media

1021
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
and stuff kind of followed it.

1022
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Yeah, the Project Scorpio,

1023
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
I know we got into that a little bit last week.

1024
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
But see, that's the thing, though.

1025
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
With the Xbox One X, though,

1026
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,000
like, I'm confident that we'll see those in stores.

1027
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Like, because Microsoft has a track record,

1028
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
as well as Sony,

1029
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
that those systems will be there,

1030
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,000
and they'll be available,

1031
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
whereas I don't trust Nintendo for shit for that.

1032
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Well, no shade, but the truth, I think,

1033
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,000
is that there's more interest in the SNES Classic

1034
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,000
than there is the Xbox One X, at least right now.

1035
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Um, well...

1036
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
We'll see when the numbers come out.

1037
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:51,000
If that's the case, then take that as a fucking hint.

1038
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
I mean, because you're just literally

1039
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
leaving money on the table

1040
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
if you're not going to produce enough systems,

1041
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:59,000
and, I mean, you're just throwing money away.

1042
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
To register participation for this week's episode

1043
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
of Orange Andrade, go to vognetwork.com.

1044
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Use the passphrase, ice.

1045
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
I know Nintendo could live in a world

1046
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,000
where the Super Nintendo outsells the PlayStation 4

1047
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
and the Xbox One.

1048
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Exactly, like, why build the hype on,

1049
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,000
oh, the system can't be bought, oh...

1050
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
All right, I don't want to regress.

1051
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
No, no, no, hold on, I'm just,

1052
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
I have a positive here, okay?

1053
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
It's like, why build the hype on,

1054
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
you know, the system can't be bought and stuff?

1055
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Build the hype on?

1056
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
We sold this many million units.

1057
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
That's the hype you build on.

1058
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Look how fucking strong a brand is.

1059
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Super Nintendo system,

1060
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,000
we fucking outsold the Xbox One this month,

1061
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
or something like that.

1062
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
That's the hype you build that shit on.

1063
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Not this, oh, we don't sell enough,

1064
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
and we're not producing enough,

1065
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,000
oh, it's the ports and the season,

1066
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
blah, blah, blah, whatever.

1067
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Anyway, well, what about this, though,

1068
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
with the whole Xbox One X?

1069
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,000
It appears that Microsoft has stopped

1070
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,000
making the Xbox One completely, already.

1071
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
They're gone.

1072
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
But they're still making them, though.

1073
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
You know, they are no longer,

1074
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
they took down the listing from the Microsoft store

1075
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
and all that, I mean, there's still an ample supply

1076
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
on shelves and things,

1077
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
but they are not making more Xbox Ones.

1078
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Well, probably the original Xbox One,

1079
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:14,000
because they have the Xbox One S,

1080
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
so that's what they're using.

1081
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,000
So yeah, the old, old, old, old fat fucking VCR system,

1082
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
yes, that's not being made anymore,

1083
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,000
but the Xbox One S, which is a nice-looking system,

1084
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,000
that's probably being made, which makes sense.

1085
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Ah, there you go, so the original,

1086
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,000
an act-def confirms the original model, the VCR.

1087
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Okay, so you just can't get the original model anymore,

1088
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,000
but you can get the Xbox One.

1089
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Which, there's no reason you'd want the old one anyways,

1090
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
because the new one's better.

1091
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Right, new ones play the HD Blu-rays and all that stuff, right?

1092
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Yeah, it has, doesn't it have the HDR stuff to it?

1093
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Yeah, yeah, they added a lot,

1094
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,000
and the PlayStation 4 Pro is touting, so.

1095
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Yeah.

1096
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Alright, so anyway, you know, here's the thing,

1097
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
I kind of feel burned by my upgrade to the Pro,

1098
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,000
that I'm not really sold on the Xbox One X,

1099
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,000
but I am sold on making my PC powerful enough

1100
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,000
to play a lot of those Xbox One X games,

1101
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
so did Microsoft really lose me?

1102
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,000
I don't think they did,

1103
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,000
it's just that I'm choosing to do it on PC instead.

1104
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
At least for now, I mean, who knows?

1105
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
That may change, that may change my mind.

1106
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Well, I mean, honestly, 4K gaming and stuff's still very early, so.

1107
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Yes.

1108
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:29,000
I mean, there's still time for all that.

1109
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Yeah, I mean, when Forza Horizon 4 is announced,

1110
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,000
in lovely 4K, because you know it'll happen,

1111
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,000
it's gonna happen, and it'll probably be next year's game.

1112
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:42,000
I want to get a 4K TV, I've been wanting one for a while,

1113
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
and they've come down in price quite a bit,

1114
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,000
I'm just waiting for the right moment.

1115
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,000
I'm just worried the day I finally buy a 4K TV,

1116
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
you know it's gonna happen.

1117
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
8K TV.

1118
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
8K is the big new, big new thing.

1119
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Honestly though, like, it's, they're,

1120
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,000
they're probably not gonna do that because it's,

1121
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Sure.

1122
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:06,000
It's bandwidth, I mean, the content's just not out there right now for that,

1123
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,000
I wouldn't be worried.

1124
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Dark Tetsuya says, I heard 8K was already a thing in Japan.

1125
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,000
This is why I don't, this is why I don't trust it.

1126
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
It's just the reality.

1127
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Alright, and there it is, AkumaJP in chat confirms,

1128
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:26,000
actually 8K is already here in Japan.

1129
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,000
But let's be honest, so, looking at 4K and 8K,

1130
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
are you really gonna notice that much of a difference?

1131
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
I mean, really, is it gonna be like,

1132
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
That's what they say every time.

1133
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Is it gonna be at that point like the pixels are so fucking small

1134
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
that they're indistinguishable anyways?

1135
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
I fucking bet, I would fucking bet.

1136
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Dark Tetsuya, you know this show better than I do.

1137
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
If I went back to a certain episode,

1138
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:50,000
would I be able to find an episode where Loki says,

1139
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:54,000
you can't tell the difference between 4K and HDTV?

1140
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
I've never said that, why would I say that?

1141
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:01,000
I feel like it's the same thing, like as the technology gets better.

1142
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Why would I say that? Because that's so stupid.

1143
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,000
That would be, that's, I mean, let's put it this way,

1144
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:10,000
like it's not a huge difference like depending on the size of the screen

1145
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
that you have and how far away you're sitting.

1146
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:16,000
But like once you get to that resolution, doubling it again,

1147
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:20,000
you're not gonna notice that the return on investment is not quite there.

1148
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:24,000
It's like from the jump from VHS, the DVD was pretty big.

1149
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,000
The jump from DVD, the HD wasn't as big.

1150
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:31,000
The jump from HD to 4K isn't as great either.

1151
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:36,000
4K to 8K, I don't think it's gonna be very noticeable.

1152
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:40,000
And what advantage, I think at that point you're just gonna be pushing,

1153
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,000
I would imagine, keep 4K and push a higher frame rate.

1154
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Because you can do a lot more fancy shit with that nice resolution.

1155
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
That's true, I'm more impressed with this.

1156
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Instead of just like pushing, because eventually it's just,

1157
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,000
you know, how, when are we gonna stop with resolution?

1158
01:01:55,000 --> 01:02:00,000
I mean, really, at some point you're gonna exceed the amount that,

1159
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:04,000
you know, traditional film can even, like, the resolution of film.

1160
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
I mean, you're not gonna be able to do that anymore.

1161
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:10,000
I remember the first time I saw, it wasn't just HDTV,

1162
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,000
but it was HD on a TV with a high refresh rate

1163
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
and that whole higher frames a second.

1164
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:18,000
I was like, this is unreal. Like, this looks crazy.

1165
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
You should check out, there was a video that I saw,

1166
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,000
like Nastectips did, they built a, it was,

1167
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
I wonder if, say it was like 16K rig,

1168
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
but they used, like, giant 4K monitors,

1169
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
and the thing was, like, fucking huge,

1170
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
because it was 16 monitors huge,

1171
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
and they played, you know, a few games on it,

1172
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,000
but, I mean, that's the kind of thing, like,

1173
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:41,000
imagine shrinking that down to the size of a, you know, like a regular TV.

1174
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
You're not, from, like, sitting across the room,

1175
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:46,000
you're not gonna notice the difference.

1176
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Your eyes can't see that kind of detail.

1177
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Alright, Dark Tetsuya, put that in the episode summary

1178
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:56,000
so we can come back to this in four years when 8K is all the rage.

1179
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:59,000
And Loki says, I never said that.

1180
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Well, when our infrastructure for the internet gets better

1181
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,000
to where we can stream that shit, like, no problem,

1182
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:08,000
and the technology's out there and the content's out there,

1183
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:11,000
then sure, I'm on board with it, but, like...

1184
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
This is one of those things I want to put on a USB stick

1185
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:17,000
and then put in the time capsule, but don't open until 2020.

1186
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Little presents to myself.

1187
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Alright, anyway, alright.

1188
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Maybe we've got the capsule.

1189
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Yeah, I know, right.

1190
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Maybe that's something at the end of the year,

1191
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:27,000
I'll have Dark Tetsuya pick some OLR clips.

1192
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Like, I can't remember, did we do that right at New Year's,

1193
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:33,000
or is that, like, you know, some mid-time during the year?

1194
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
When did we do that time capsule?

1195
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
I think before the summer, but we're opening it at the end of the year.

1196
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Anyway, we need to move on, we're running long.

1197
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Yes, we do.

1198
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:47,000
So, one of my favorite RPGs is Secret of Mana, Seiken Densetsu 2,

1199
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,000
as it was in Japan,

1200
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:53,000
and as we know that there was a Seiken Densetsu collection

1201
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:56,000
that was released in Japan that had all three of them,

1202
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
which the first one we got is Final Fantasy Adventure,

1203
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:02,000
the second one we had is Secret of Mana, and then Seiken Densetsu 3.

1204
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:08,000
So, Seiken Densetsu 2 is being released as Secret of Mana here in the US

1205
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:13,000
for PlayStation and Steam, and the pre-order is already up.

1206
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,000
I've got it on my wish list, just it's going to go in the budget,

1207
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
and I don't know what system we're getting it on,

1208
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:21,000
but it's really pretty, it's really well updated,

1209
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
the music has been remastered,

1210
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:26,000
and it looks like with the voiceovers on there,

1211
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
you may be able to choose which language you listen to it in,

1212
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
which would be great.

1213
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:35,000
So, the pre-order that I found on Steam was, like, 40 bucks,

1214
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
which really isn't terrible.

1215
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Of course, the big edition that came out in Japan, though,

1216
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
came with, like, little figurines,

1217
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:47,000
and if you get the pre-order or a day of purchase,

1218
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:50,000
then you get, like, special tiger outfits for your characters.

1219
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Oh, yeah, like, wouldn't they have, like, little moogle outfits, too?

1220
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,000
You get, like, a moogle outfit and a tiger outfit.

1221
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Tiger now.

1222
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
You sure refer to me as Mr. Tiger.

1223
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Do they have tiger's blood?

1224
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,000
But, um, no, that was a real pleasant surprise to see,

1225
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,000
but here's my question.

1226
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Which Seiken Detsetsu was Secret of Evermore?

1227
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

1228
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Dark Sakura took me seriously for a minute,

1229
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
and she's like, you just broke my brain.

1230
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
I'm teasing, I'm teasing, I'm teasing.

1231
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:23,000
But I did like Secret of Evermore.

1232
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
I think that game is shit on unnecessarily.

1233
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Like, there are qualities about that game that I do like,

1234
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,000
but, yes, that game is not part of the Seiken Detsetsu series.

1235
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
It was a square USA game.

1236
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:36,000
For some reason it's making me think that I need to actually

1237
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
start playing through Terranigma.

1238
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Oh, now that's Enix's, like, Soul Blazer trilogy, right?

1239
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Illusion of Gaia we got over here.

1240
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Terranigma came out in Europe.

1241
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Was Brain Lord part of that, too?

1242
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
I don't remember. I'll have to look it up.

1243
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Can we get a new toe ball game?

1244
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
But when we get a new Bust-A-Groove.

1245
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
No, Bust-A-Move.

1246
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Or Ur-Gites.

1247
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Do we get a new Ur-Gites? Because Ur-Gites is New York.

1248
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
See, Rob, that's not true because you knew me.

1249
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,000
But before you, Jamie. Yes, there was a day before you.

1250
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:10,000
No, but you knew me when the first Bust-A-Move came out.

1251
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Because you played it at my house.

1252
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Not when it came out.

1253
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
On that big Toshiba TV that we had back then.

1254
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Not when it first came out because my first game.

1255
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Before I played DDR, I played Bust-A in the US Groove 2.

1256
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
I felt for certain that you knew me.

1257
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
That was the game that enabled me to get into DDR.

1258
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Oh.

1259
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,000
I know, right?

1260
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:34,000
You remember the ones who introduced me to that game, though,

1261
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,000
was Chris Tang and his girlfriend at the time.

1262
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,000
Huh.

1263
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,000
So.

1264
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Interesting.

1265
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,000
I'm looking in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

1266
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Dark Tetsuya says-

1267
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
I also remember he kicked Dan's ass at Street Fighter.

1268
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Dark Tetsuya confirms Brain Lord was Enix.

1269
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Yeah, it was. I know it was Enix, but was it part of the same developers that did Illusion of Gaia and that whole-

1270
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Because all those games are very similar.

1271
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:01,000
I'm kind of wishing I could find a PAL cart of Terra Enigma.

1272
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Yeah, right?

1273
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
It would just be nice to have, but I don't need it.

1274
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:10,000
I mean, I've been trying to make some time to go back and play some of the stuff that I missed.

1275
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:17,000
And that was on my list for sure, but I don't know if I more want to play Seiken Densetsu 3.

1276
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,000
I mean, this is great.

1277
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
And it's going to be released in January.

1278
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,000
It'll be fine when it comes out.

1279
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:26,000
But part of me wants to sit and have somebody there and play through Seiken Densetsu 3 again.

1280
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:30,000
January, maybe Japanese release. Here it's February 15th, I think.

1281
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Steam said January when I looked at it. Hold on.

1282
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
I thought they announced the release date is February 15th.

1283
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Hold on, let me reopen my Steam again and I will get the date off of Steam.

1284
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,000
No worries.

1285
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Because I put it on my wish list there.

1286
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:48,000
But as far as Secret of Mana goes and the remake, I was really jazzed when they announced it because it kind of came out of nowhere.

1287
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:54,000
I think, you know, people didn't think that we were ever going to go back and revisit the series at this point.

1288
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:59,000
What did we get? We got Legend of Mana and I feel like there was one more game in the series.

1289
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
Never mind, it's February 15th, 2008.

1290
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,000
Woo woo!

1291
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,000
18.

1292
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
My memory serves me good for something.

1293
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:09,000
But yeah, I think people weren't expecting that, oh, we're going to get this Secret of Mana remake.

1294
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
And it kind of looks like, to me, it looks like...

1295
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:14,000
How the fuck is this like Danganronpa 2, Steam?

1296
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Steam is weird.

1297
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
You like this because you like Danganronpa 2.

1298
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
It's nothing like fucking Danganronpa.

1299
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,000
They're both from Japan, so...

1300
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
There's no murder mystery in Secret of Mana.

1301
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
That you're aware of in the new one.

1302
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Maybe in the new one.

1303
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Those tiger suits came from somewhere.

1304
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Tiger murders.

1305
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:37,000
But anyway, it looks to me a lot like the Final Fantasy IV kind of redo.

1306
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Or III, I guess was really the first one.

1307
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Final Fantasy III and then they did IV.

1308
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Secret of Mana kind of looks like it's in that same style.

1309
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:46,000
I think that it fits, though, its original art style, to be honest.

1310
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Yeah, it fits.

1311
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Because the way that the characters were designed,

1312
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:53,000
they don't look too different in their 3D models.

1313
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Yeah.

1314
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:57,000
I'm also pleasantly surprised that they're not telling us about this

1315
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,000
years in advance, like the Final Fantasy VII remake.

1316
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:04,000
They're telling us this and it's out in less than six months.

1317
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
And that's a nice surprise.

1318
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Again, things might get delayed.

1319
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,000
But I kind of feel like this one's probably been far enough along

1320
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:14,000
and they've been working on it long enough where it's going to be ready to go

1321
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,000
and they're going to make the release date.

1322
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,000
So I think that's really exciting.

1323
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Now, one other thing I do want to bring up,

1324
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
because I've seen a lot of talk about it on Twitter,

1325
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:23,000
but a lot of people saying, why aren't you putting it on the Switch?

1326
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Why is the Switch getting skipped for this?

1327
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Because this would be a fantastic game to play on your TV and take on the go.

1328
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
I don't disagree with that notion.

1329
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
I would love to be able to play this game on the Switch.

1330
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:40,000
I kind of feel like because this game has probably been secretly in development for years,

1331
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:43,000
I mean, it's probably been secretly in development for a couple years at least,

1332
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
I think Nintendo is probably still viewed as too risky.

1333
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:48,000
And I think probably when this game was first developed,

1334
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:54,000
the Wii U is probably what was out and they didn't want to develop for that.

1335
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:58,000
So they moved on and decided to go with PlayStation 4,

1336
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
which was probably the bigger deal at the time.

1337
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:06,000
It's hard to decide to develop for another system,

1338
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:11,000
especially when you don't know how it's going to end up doing that early.

1339
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Who knows when they were alerted to the Switch being in development.

1340
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Exactly, so I'm not going to give them too much shit about skipping the Switch,

1341
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
but I hope it's something that might be visited in the future.

1342
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:28,000
And to be fair, the Switch did end up getting that secret Amana collection,

1343
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:32,000
at least in Japan, and the Switch is region free for what it's worth.

1344
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:35,000
So maybe that's kind of a consolation prize, I don't know.

1345
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:38,000
But the Switch does have that and other platforms don't have it.

1346
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:41,000
So I'm not going to be like, oh Square is a bunch of Nintendo haters.

1347
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:44,000
I can kind of see the logic and why the Switch got skipped.

1348
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,000
They did quite the opposite, actually.

1349
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:49,000
They put a lot of shit exclusive on Nintendo platforms.

1350
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:53,000
But if they decide to do a similar remake for 2nd Densetsu 3,

1351
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:56,000
or even Secret of Evermore, lol, they won't.

1352
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:00,000
But 2nd Densetsu 3, even if they decide to go back and remake that as well,

1353
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,000
then maybe they'll consider the Switch at that point or something.

1354
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,000
So we'll see what happens.

1355
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:08,000
Alright. Anyhow, let's move on. Some more stories. Right, Loki?

1356
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Yeah. So there's this game called Darkwood that has been out, I guess, on PC for a while now.

1357
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:25,000
And they decided that to actually allow more people to play it,

1358
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
they're going to pirate the game.

1359
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:30,000
They basically uploaded it to Pirate Bay.

1360
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:34,000
They said there's no catch, no added pirate hats for the characters.

1361
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:40,000
They just uploaded it for free so that it will help people check it out

1362
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,000
that may not have been able to afford the game in the first place.

1363
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:47,000
So Darkwood, I guess, released that originally in 2014.

1364
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:52,000
And now it's just kind of out there.

1365
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:59,000
I'm surprised with it being out for so long, though, that people wouldn't have been able to play it cheaply.

1366
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:03,000
I mean, putting some keys out there in one of those bundle sites or something for like a buck or something.

1367
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:06,000
You can't afford a dollar.

1368
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:09,000
But neat press either way. It gives them exposure.

1369
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:15,000
And saying that they're the ones doing it in the first place, I guess that's...

1370
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
You can't really fault them for that.

1371
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:23,000
I think there was an angle to this, too, where they were trying to combat against some of those third-party key sellers.

1372
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Yeah, like G2A.

1373
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Of course, they were selling a lot of keys or they were grabbing a lot of the free keys that they would send out.

1374
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:40,000
They said this practice makes it impossible for us to do any giveaways or send keys to people who actually don't have the money to play Darkwood

1375
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:44,000
because they would just turn around and resell them and say,

1376
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Please don't buy it through any of the key selling sites.

1377
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:51,000
By doing that, you're just feeding the cancer that is leeching off this industry.

1378
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:55,000
Like we said with the scalpers earlier, same type of thing.

1379
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Don't give these people money because they're making the situation worse.

1380
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Well, very interesting move. It kind of sounds like the nuclear option is to go put it on Pirate Bay.

1381
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Honestly, it's been out for three or four years.

1382
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:19,000
I don't know if this was the intention, but I bet a lot of gaming shows probably weren't talking about this game in 2017.

1383
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:23,000
And now they all are this week, so it is some interesting press for the game.

1384
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
Yeah, it's good.

1385
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:31,000
I've seen some other games that they had people put out for free on Steam,

1386
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:36,000
even changing the price of free for a short period of time because they have a new game coming out.

1387
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:39,000
So it's a good way to kind of drive that press saying,

1388
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Oh, hey, there's a game that's coming out for free. You can check it out.

1389
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:47,000
And there are also companies releasing a new game soon, that type of thing.

1390
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:56,000
So it's not a bad idea, especially that the game's probably run its course for the most part after three years.

1391
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:01,000
All right, well, moving on. Video game consoles, they don't just play video games.

1392
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
They have a lot of other apps and things that they do as well.

1393
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:08,000
In fact, on the Xbox One, you can use Twitter on the Xbox One, which I must confess I don't think I've ever done.

1394
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Or maybe I used it that one time to write that tweet that says, Hi, I'm on my Xbox One.

1395
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Yeah, hi, I'm on my Vita. And then that's it. Like you never use it again, right?

1396
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Well, interesting because there was an update that they made to Twitter on Xbox One that may be worth revisiting,

1397
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:31,000
depending on what you're into, because it does a focus now for Twitter on live 360 degree video.

1398
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:36,000
And a lot of platforms are kind of, you see us more on Facebook with the 360 degree videos and all this stuff.

1399
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:42,000
So now Twitter is kind of looking to, you know, put the video content on Xbox One as opposed to just your Twitter stream.

1400
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:47,000
So I think that's kind of interesting. Apple TV was already kind of doing this.

1401
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:53,000
So this is kind of one of those. They now put it on Xbox One to kind of mimic what was going on on the Apple TV platform.

1402
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:58,000
You know, it's too bad the Xbox 360 would have been a perfect name for a VR headset for the Xbox.

1403
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Right.

1404
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:06,000
Which I wouldn't doubt that they could do that someday, being that this is the Xbox One,

1405
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:11,000
and all naming conventions are just been, you know, any rules regarding that just been thrown out the door anyway.

1406
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:16,000
True. That's very true. But anyway, you can also do two video streams side by side.

1407
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:22,000
I don't know how the audio would work in that. I guess you can select one or the other. Maybe you do just listen to both. Who knows?

1408
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Also Periscopes, since Twitter does own Periscope, Periscopes are included in this.

1409
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:32,000
You can actually browse a global map and look at Periscopes from around the world.

1410
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:38,000
So I'm sure during that boxing thing last night, people could look at pirate streams of that fight from around the world.

1411
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:42,000
I don't follow that stuff at all, but it's all I saw on Twitter last night.

1412
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:46,000
And all I would see on Facebook are people asking for pirate streams.

1413
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:51,000
And one of my friend was actually doing like a broadcast and I guess got a strike or whatever they do on Facebook.

1414
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:58,000
I don't even know if Facebook monitored that stuff, but Facebook live banned her from broadcasting for like three days.

1415
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:04,000
Cause she was broadcasting that event last night, which, you know, people pay hundreds of dollars to see.

1416
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:09,000
So it wasn't, wasn't it over really fast to like nine rounds. Yeah.

1417
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:15,000
All the reactions I saw on Twitter were that it was kind of ridiculous, but I just, I don't.

1418
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Well, it's an MMA fighter versus, you know, it's like basically two, like, I don't know if they were undefeated,

1419
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:28,000
but, um, you know, uh, undefeated boxer versus like an undefeated MMA fighter or something like that.

1420
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:32,000
I, I could be completely wrong because I don't follow any sports.

1421
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,000
I'm already bored.

1422
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:38,000
But yeah, it was supposed to be them fighting each other like to see which is better, but you're doing boxing now.

1423
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
If it's MMA, that would be interesting, but I don't know.

1424
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
I should have done both.

1425
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:52,000
Oh, and then something just to say in terms of physicality, an MMA fighter can't last in a boxing match and vice versa.

1426
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Here's what would have been interesting to me. Why not put them outside their element altogether?

1427
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
That would have been interesting.

1428
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:06,000
No, you might know them as these famous boxing and fighters, but can they do curling?

1429
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Go-karts, laser tag.

1430
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:19,000
That I would fucking pay to see. That is some straight up like ABC, uh, Sunday night specials, Olympics of the stars or whatever they fucking call that shit.

1431
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,000
Dancing with the stars.

1432
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
Dancing with the stars. Perfect.

1433
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:26,000
It would be something like that.

1434
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:30,000
This Olympics got weird.

1435
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:36,000
Act F suggests make them play Puyo Puyo Tetris against each other.

1436
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:45,000
The event should be decided by voting with a live student, you know, they'll have live votes for people to submit events that they would participate in.

1437
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Yes. Well, don't let America vote because the cute young guy will always win. Did American Idol teach you nothing?

1438
01:17:52,000 --> 01:18:00,000
It doesn't matter that Adam Lambert was the better singer. The other guy was the cute young guy and he won.

1439
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Although, you know, Adam Lambert is no slouch himself, but you know, still.

1440
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:10,000
Anyway, from Twitter to American Idol, there we are.

1441
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Or couldn't he like team up to beat up some other bad people? Like we can throw other people in the ring and they can just beat on them? I'd watch that.

1442
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,000
Wait, just random people?

1443
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Like bad people, you know, like throw in like...

1444
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Like Nazis.

1445
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:26,000
No, not necessarily. You can throw in Nazis, that'd be fine too, but like, you know, just annoying people.

1446
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:34,000
I'm sure there's annoying people that we would just like to see. They should have a website where you vote for people with the most punchable faces and invite those people in.

1447
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
You just want Celebrity Deathmatch to be a real show.

1448
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Yes, I do. Yes, I do.

1449
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
MTV Celebrity Deathmatch.

1450
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:43,000
I'm totally fine with that being a real show, yes.

1451
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
Dark Soccer, are you able to see your brain?

1452
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
I just see your eyes rolling over there.

1453
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:51,000
Alright, why don't you depress the hell out of us with our next story?

1454
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:58,000
This is actually... I kinda don't know how to feel about it. This is somebody actually that Dan's met before.

1455
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Said he was a really nice guy, so it just goes to show you can't always trust everyone you meet.

1456
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:12,000
And I'm gonna lead up to it. This guy is named John Trudeau. He is a pinball designer.

1457
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:18,000
He's designed some very amazing classic pinball, like Creature from the Black Lagoon.

1458
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:25,000
And Black Rose, which is actually one of my favorite tables. The new Ghostbusters table. Judge Dredd.

1459
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:31,000
Quite a few, quite a few really... Bride of Pinbots, another one.

1460
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:35,000
So these are all really good pinball tables that everyone knows, right?

1461
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:39,000
Well, he just got busted for kitty porn.

1462
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:53,000
Apparently, police search led to him. And they seized his computer and found his equipment contained child pornography.

1463
01:19:53,000 --> 01:20:01,000
We don't know if he was actually producing it or just had it. But even having it is bad enough.

1464
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:05,000
So he's currently being held on bond right now.

1465
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
There's no nice way to spin this story.

1466
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,000
There's not.

1467
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:16,000
And it just goes to show that, like, what's on the outside surface, what people are like on the outside,

1468
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:20,000
doesn't necessarily mean that they are 100% right in the head.

1469
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:28,000
You know, because being in... If anyone listening to this show is into child porn, stop. All of it.

1470
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:32,000
Go get yourself some fucking mental health. That's it.

1471
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:46,000
But 69 years old, too. His career is over. And deservedly so, because people like that really shouldn't have a career.

1472
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:50,000
So this is a really slippery slope and there's a part of me that's just like, just move on to the next story.

1473
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:56,000
But I have to ask this question. Does it ruin the games that he created?

1474
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,000
I don't think so.

1475
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:01,000
Because more people had a hand in those things than just him.

1476
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:10,000
I'll put it this way. If you were looking at the origins of everything, ruining the later things, we wouldn't have Volkswagens anymore.

1477
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:16,000
I see what you mean. There's criminals everywhere, basically.

1478
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,000
Right.

1479
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:24,000
I do think that the value of his tables is going to go up because there's not going to be any more.

1480
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:28,000
That's weird to think about, though. I don't like that.

1481
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Because you know they're not going to reprint any or recommission any of his tables.

1482
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:40,000
I don't know about that. Why would they do that? Just because the designer or something was involved in that? That's stupid.

1483
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:47,000
That's true. Most people aren't going to know. It doesn't have that same visibility that films do. You know what I mean?

1484
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:57,000
But people who bother with pinball are going to know the names of the designers. People will know who Lawler is.

1485
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Great. I know him personally and I can't think of his name suddenly.

1486
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:13,000
Steve Ritchie. They'll know who these people are. They'll know who the table designers are. They'll know who the artists behind the tables are.

1487
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Just today, Dan and I were talking about Christian Marsh, who did a bunch of pinballs in the 60s and 70s, including the one we own, Spanish Eyes.

1488
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:31,000
He was also a Cubist painter during the mid-century.

1489
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:45,000
But if you're a fan of it, you're going to know what this is. And just when you find it happening under your nose or in your backyard, as it were, it suddenly becomes this big betrayal.

1490
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:57,000
And it really is. A person who we trust to be a sane individual who doesn't go around looking at children being abused in compromising situations.

1491
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
It's a big shock.

1492
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:08,000
Tiger Claw on chat says, I never understood why these people are into that it boggles the mind. Well, you know what? That's good.

1493
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,000
It's because it's a mental illness.

1494
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:17,000
Yeah. And not to, you know, we got to be careful when we talk about mental illness because there's a big spectrum of them. But, you know, I'm just saying.

1495
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,000
Illness takes all forms.

1496
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:21,000
Yes. Yes.

1497
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:25,000
You know, and in this case, it's it's definitely.

1498
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
I'm just saying it's for the best. You don't understand.

1499
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:30,000
Well, yeah.

1500
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:32,000
So anyway.

1501
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:44,000
It's really disgusting. And I hope that he gets the counseling and everything that he needs to get over such a sickening addiction.

1502
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
But at the same time, it's just.

1503
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
I think we need to move on to another story.

1504
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,000
I might have just thrown up in my mouth.

1505
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
Let's go to another story. Let's talk about another video game. Loki.

1506
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:07,000
Yes. Final Fantasy 15 was suddenly announced for Windows, so they're going to be releasing that out on PC sometime in early 2018.

1507
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:23,000
It was revealed from a trailer from Nvidia that basically showed off the GTX 1080 TI kind of footage that they have captured their different Nvidia tech like the hair tech and stuff like that.

1508
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:28,000
So it's going to support up to 4K resolution textures. Dolby Atmos.

1509
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:41,000
They said a realistic turf advanced hair simulation, combustible fluid fire and smoke simulations, advanced shadows, high quality ambient inclusion and all sorts of stuff.

1510
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
So, yeah, it looks pretty cool.

1511
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,000
I guess it would, you know.

1512
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:58,000
I guess the game could get better looking, but on top of that, they're going to have mod support. That's right. Mod support for Final Fantasy 15.

1513
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:00,000
That's pretty awesome.

1514
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:13,000
And then also Final Fantasy 15, if you're not even getting it on PC or you have it on console, they're getting this weird crossover DLC from Assassin's Creed.

1515
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:22,000
So it's this Assassin's Festival DLC that they're going to have like a cross tie in with Assassin's Creed Origins.

1516
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:32,000
And I guess starting August 30th, players will be able to obtain a dream egg from a Moogle Chocobo Carnival event.

1517
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:38,000
And they'll be gifted the Assassin outfit for Noctis.

1518
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:48,000
And then I guess following day on the 31st, they're going to have some other DLC that's going to transform one of the towns in the game with banners and festivals and stuff like that.

1519
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:57,000
It almost sounds like the shit that they do for Final Fantasy 14 or something like that or 11 where they just kind of do these holiday events. It's kind of weird.

1520
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:04,000
It is a little weird how they kind of treat it like Final Fantasy 14 in a way where they do online events like you would expect to see in an MMO.

1521
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:13,000
But you know, I remember that I did what was the Moogle Chocobo Carnival or something, and it was like an extra menu option that you would load up.

1522
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:19,000
And yeah, you get items that could go back in your regular save files. It was a little weird, but it worked. So it was kind of cool.

1523
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:30,000
Anyway, since you brought up mods and the PC, you know the first thing that people are going to do with this game, and I don't care if it's dudes or it's chicks or whatever.

1524
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:41,000
There's going to be nude mods. It's going to be the first thing that's made. So the big question, and there's a hilarious picture floating around Twitter right now of like the Final Fantasy 15 cast in very little clothing.

1525
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:51,000
In like what is going to be a scene from the PC version basically when the mods come out. Well, of course, you know, they were actually asked about it.

1526
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:58,000
Hajime Tabata was asked in an interview about the whole, you know, well, what are you going to do about nude mods type of thing.

1527
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:05,000
And obviously there's some worry about we've made this great world and people might try to stuff all kind of strange things into it and mess it up.

1528
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:13,000
When we were getting together for discussion, all the people together in the project were airing out their worries. Nude mods were something people were particularly worried about.

1529
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:20,000
What's stronger in my mind is the fact that I don't want to limit people too much. It's a thing they've bought. It's their game now.

1530
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:27,000
As far as the nude mods go, I don't think it's a good thing, but we're going to leave it to the moral sense of the players out there.

1531
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:33,000
Well, they're going to definitely disappoint you.

1532
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:45,000
Prepare for a letdown. But you know what? I look forward to Final Fantasy 15's release on PC. That is all I have to say.

1533
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:55,000
That's right. 4K. Oh my god. This is good. Like, finally, gay pornography is becoming like a mainstream video game.

1534
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:01,000
Something that not even Dream Daddy could accomplish, Final Fantasy 15 on PC is going to accomplish.

1535
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:06,000
And you know what? Even if you're not into do-it-yourself, be happy for me at least.

1536
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
I fully support this. I can't wait to see.

1537
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:17,000
There are some ladies, like unfortunately one of Final Fantasy 15's problems is that the ladies aren't really, you know, they're hardly there.

1538
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,000
But there are some strong female.

1539
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,000
I'm sure Sydney will be completely tastefully handled.

1540
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:23,000
Of course tastefully, of course.

1541
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:34,000
I fully expect to see Macho Man Randy Savage and Thomas the Tank Engine make their appearances on the platform.

1542
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:40,000
Yes, yes. For folks that could do without the nude mods, there will always be the over-the-fucking-top shit.

1543
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:45,000
I hope we can mod the summons. Please hope the guy that we can mod the summons, because that's going to be amazing.

1544
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
DarkSockro, will you describe the motion that you were making with your hand just now?

1545
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:50,000
The jerking off motion.

1546
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:55,000
That's right. That's what I'll be doing to Final Fantasy 15 on PC. Thank you for filling in with the visual.

1547
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
The other motion was the whoopty shit motion.

1548
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:00,000
Whatever.

1549
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:02,000
Anyway.

1550
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:08,000
If it's on a non-locked device, people are going to figure out how to put butts in it. Butts and dick.

1551
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:13,000
Yeah. Even if it was locked down, they would find a way to put butts.

1552
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
Even if they have to have a butt sitting on it.

1553
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:18,000
Butts will find a way.

1554
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
We should have a little chime and play butts.

1555
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
I think it's a butt now.

1556
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:32,000
It really seems to be big and red.

1557
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:37,000
Somehow, somewhere, butts will find a way.

1558
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:39,000
Alright.

1559
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
I was trying to find the more you know, the little chimes.

1560
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:46,000
You must be new here. Let me introduce you to Rule 34.

1561
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:49,000
Anyway.

1562
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
Even all these jokes about nude mods and stuff aside,

1563
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:58,000
I still think Final Fantasy 15 is somewhere in the middle of the pack for the series for me.

1564
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:02,000
I think a lot of it was rushed. Some of my issues with that. They cut a lot of corners.

1565
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
Yes. A game that was in development for as many years as it was, was rushed.

1566
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
Because the real development didn't happen until the last two years.

1567
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:15,000
That's the other thing too. Hopefully with this, one of the things you get with Skyrim and stuff is people fixing the game.

1568
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
I kind of look forward to a lot of that.

1569
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
I think I probably will double dip on this game on PC.

1570
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:23,000
I think I will too.

1571
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Hopefully I have the appropriate video card at that time.

1572
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:31,000
Hopefully it's optimized and hopefully, I don't think it was one of our stories,

1573
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:36,000
but hopefully it's not 170 gigabytes to download this shit.

1574
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
Well, but if it's 4K textures, that wouldn't...

1575
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
That's unexcusable. That's fucking too much.

1576
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
Final Fantasy 13 on PC is 60...

1577
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:49,000
Okay, fine. That's fine. Give me the option then to download it optionally.

1578
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:55,000
I'm not running 4K. I don't want to download 160 gigabytes worth of shit I'm not using.

1579
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
Have like a 4K pack that you can download.

1580
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
What resolution are you planning to run this shit at?

1581
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:03,000
Download accordingly.

1582
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
And Dark Tetsuya in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

1583
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
I think they came out and said that was a typo or otherwise incorrect.

1584
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
Well, they just said that we haven't determined the size yet, which means,

1585
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
where did that information come from? So yeah.

1586
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:18,000
I'm just... Guys, 4K Final Fantasy game, it's...

1587
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
Remember, Final Fantasy 13, which doesn't even support 4K.

1588
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:23,000
60 gigs on PC.

1589
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
So when I saw that 180 gig number, I was like, okay, that makes sense.

1590
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:30,000
But I mean, this is why a lot of hard drives are like three and four terabytes now.

1591
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:36,000
And they're even, you know, the standard size drive in a console now is pretty much up to one...

1592
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:38,000
Well, unless you're Nintendo, but that's a whole other story.

1593
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,000
But now it's up to a terabyte, right?

1594
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,000
What does the Xbox One X come with?

1595
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:43,000
500 gigs or a terabyte.

1596
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,000
That's it? Or a terabyte.

1597
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,000
A lot of the newer ones have terabytes.

1598
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:51,000
A lot of them are terrible. Like my Xbox One brick, I have the VHS kind, is a terabyte.

1599
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:53,000
I mean, because I didn't buy the very first one.

1600
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
I bought... I don't remember when I bought my Xbox One.

1601
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:58,000
It was right around Horizon 3 or something. I don't know.

1602
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:02,000
But I bought like a little later down the line and they had a terabyte model out.

1603
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:06,000
I think Best Buy was running some deal where you bought an Xbox One and you got a game free.

1604
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
And it was for Forza Horizon that I bought.

1605
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
Maybe it was two, not three, actually.

1606
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
My memory ain't doing so well this day and age.

1607
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:17,000
Anyway.

1608
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:21,000
But now that's why one terabyte is starting to become the standard.

1609
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:23,000
Anyway.

1610
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
Let's take a trip down memory lane, shall we?

1611
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:31,000
We're going to go back to a simpler time when there was no fucking 4K.

1612
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:38,000
These consoles couldn't even hold probably three megabytes, let alone 180 gigabytes.

1613
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:42,000
4K was more like, you know, the download bit rate that you would get with this stuff.

1614
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:44,000
Yes. Perfect.

1615
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:46,000
It's the classic game of the week.

1616
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:53,000
But once a month, Dark Sakura dips into the archive of consoles and picks a classic console of the month.

1617
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:55,000
I'm switching it up in this bitch.

1618
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:57,000
Is this really a classic, though?

1619
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:01,000
Well, it could be a classic in the same way like a turd is.

1620
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:08,000
Sometimes we feature classic games because they were notable for other reasons.

1621
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
And I think this console is no different.

1622
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:13,000
A turd.

1623
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:15,000
It's a post-taco turd.

1624
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:19,000
Ten years older or more, what is the classic console of the month?

1625
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,000
The Nokia N-Gage.

1626
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:23,000
Speaking of taco turds.

1627
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:29,000
The nickname Tacophone made it into the wiki.

1628
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
That's how prevalent the name was.

1629
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:37,000
So because I could find no good music for it, in the background we'll be listening to the dance of the sugar plum fairy.

1630
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,000
Why?

1631
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:41,000
Because reasons.

1632
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:43,000
Alright.

1633
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:46,000
It's your segment.

1634
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:58,000
Anyway, the N-Gage was a PDA that was both cell phone and a handheld game device.

1635
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:00,000
I was about to say a ham sandwich.

1636
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
Ew. Ham is gross.

1637
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:09,000
It was announced on the 4th of November 2002 and released October 7, 2003.

1638
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:11,000
And yes, Dan and I both had one.

1639
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:13,000
It was terrible.

1640
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
That means the N-Gage is old enough to be in high school.

1641
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:18,000
It probably failed.

1642
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:20,000
Kindergarten.

1643
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:22,000
Several times.

1644
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:28,000
It's going to be that ten year old that's in, not ten year old, it's going to be the thirteen year old that's in first grade.

1645
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:30,000
Eating crayons.

1646
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:43,000
Anyway, the N-Gage, it's intent was to, because it had the mobile phone functionality added to it, it was supposed to try to get a one up over the Game Boy Advance.

1647
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:50,000
It kind of is almost the same shape, but smaller screen, but it was a full color screen.

1648
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
Backlit as well, if I recall correctly.

1649
01:34:54,000 --> 01:35:02,000
So, it was re-imaged as the N-Gage QD in 2004 to redesign it.

1650
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:11,000
It was supposed to fix a bunch of the design problems, but it only sold two million units in two years.

1651
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:15,000
It was pretty much a big commercial failure.

1652
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:24,000
It was discontinued in 2005, and Nokia moved the gaming aspect of it to their Series 60 smartphones.

1653
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:29,000
Which was then called the N-Gage Platform, or N-Gage 2.0 in 2007.

1654
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:34,000
So N-Gage in itself was rebranded into a service.

1655
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:50,000
But, pretty much, it was meant that you could play on it instead of using cables, you could use Bluetooth or the internet for the N-Gage Arena service to play online.

1656
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:55,000
It had MP3 and real audio video playback, and of course it had PDA functions.

1657
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
You know, like the Palm Pilots back in the day.

1658
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:03,000
It was three hundred bucks when it came out, so it wasn't very popular for price.

1659
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:10,000
And it was outsold by the Game Boy Advance a hundred to one, just think about that right now.

1660
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:21,000
And then, basically, places like GameStop and Electronics Boutique started giving like a hundred dollar rebates back on the price.

1661
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:33,000
But it was also, you know, like I said, it was also a cellphone, it did not have an integrated camera, it was running the Symbian OS 6.1.

1662
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:39,000
And, it wasn't really bad for what it was as a PDA.

1663
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:46,000
However, like, the games were a pain in the ass to get in them.

1664
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:50,000
And I remember that, Rob, did you go to that E3 when they had the whole N-Gage section?

1665
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:52,000
I did.

1666
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:56,000
And I brought out my N-Gage, and the person there was like, oh my god, you have one!

1667
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:02,000
And there was no one over there, okay? I felt so sorry for the poor Nokia rep.

1668
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:11,000
It did have a couple of good games that came out on it, like Pocket Kingdom Own the World got some good reviews,

1669
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:21,000
Pathway to Glory was a self-published game, and it came out pretty well, but most of the games just were not very good.

1670
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:31,000
You had to, like, pull out like a little plastic sleeve to be able to change the games in and out, and it just wasn't very good.

1671
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:39,000
It didn't sell great, the games didn't look all that great, it just wasn't super good.

1672
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:47,000
I mean, so since then, like, the games that came out on it were kind of, you know, there were some big titles.

1673
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:57,000
I mean, we had Super Monkey Ball, we had Puyo Pop, we had Puzzle Bobble Versus, Rayman 3, Sega Rally came out in Australia and Brazil.

1674
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:08,000
It was a Sonic game, wasn't very good, Bomberman, the Asphalt series, Ashen, Catan, Civ 2, Rob, I know you like your Civ.

1675
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:13,000
It was absolutely not good on that system, I played it at that E3 and I was depressed.

1676
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:24,000
Pandemonium came out, the two X-Men Legends games came out, Virtual Cop was created but never released.

1677
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:34,000
It was Tomb Raider, Tony Hawk's Proskater, which I had that one, The Sims Busted Out, I mean, it had games that could have been really good, but it just didn't happen.

1678
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:44,000
You know, it was at best ambitious, and at worst, what it actually was.

1679
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:53,000
It was just, and on top of that too, with the shape of the phone, you know, it was called the Taco Phone for a reason, but it was really hard to talk and hear on it.

1680
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:58,000
You know, the design just was really poorly executed, at least for that first model.

1681
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm laughing at this shade in our chatroom from our pal Bobby Black Wolf.

1682
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:06,000
The Engage booth was a great place to chill when you got claustrophobic.

1683
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
That's pretty much why I think we went there.

1684
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:18,000
But it was just nice seeing that momentary glow when I pulled out my Engage, like, oh my god, a human who bought one.

1685
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:20,000
Like, well, technically.

1686
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:23,000
It was free, but okay.

1687
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:33,000
Okay. And I had to keep switching out my Sim between the Engage and my, what did I have at the time, an Ericsson?

1688
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
So here's the thing I've got to bring up, though.

1689
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:46,000
So it's much shit as we gave the Engage at the time for being a cell phone and a gaming platform, and not really doing either one of them particularly well.

1690
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:50,000
This thing was out, what, three years before the very first iPhone?

1691
01:39:51,000 --> 01:40:01,000
And then, of course, Androids around the same time, which, like, now you think about gaming and mobile, and that's like the way a lot of people game exclusively.

1692
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:06,000
So it's kind of, you know, you almost want to say, oh, is the Engage ahead of its time in that way?

1693
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
But then you think about that horrible design.

1694
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:17,000
And one place where Apple really, you know, got them was that the design of that original iPhone was pretty fucking sweet.

1695
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:19,000
To their credit, at least they had buttons.

1696
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:21,000
I had one right when they came out.

1697
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:29,000
So yeah, at that time, my cell phone that I was using regularly was a Sony Ericsson that had that stupid little camera attachment.

1698
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:35,000
I went through, I had two Sony Ericksons because I liked them so much. Remember my little attachments?

1699
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:37,000
Yeah, I remember that thing, yeah.

1700
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:43,000
So just trying to put it in the perspective of what else was out at the time. It was before the Razer.

1701
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:45,000
So there you go.

1702
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
There it is. All right, your classic console of the month.

1703
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:50,000
Classic turd of the month.

1704
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:54,000
Classic console of the month. The Engage.

1705
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:56,000
You're the one who put it on my list.

1706
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:00,000
Did I? Oh yeah, because we were brainstorming back in January.

1707
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:02,000
And then you did Engage.

1708
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
Because I was like, oh, it's over 10 years old.

1709
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
I'm like, watch me fucking do it.

1710
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:09,000
Watch me, hoe.

1711
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
It'll be dead. It's already been gotten.

1712
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:17,000
All right, we are going to take a break though, but don't go anywhere. There is plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come.

1713
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:21,000
So stay tuned when we come back with part B right after this quick break.

1714
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:35,000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio. Live tonight with episode number 698 of our show already in progress.

1715
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:40,000
Our last show really for the month because we won't be here next week.

1716
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:46,000
Because again, Dragon Con is going on next weekend, which actually technically I think is September anyway.

1717
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:50,000
But my point is we're not here next week, so this show is going to have to do you for two weeks.

1718
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:56,000
And we'll be back with 699 the day before Loki's birthday on September 10th.

1719
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:58,000
You know what we're missing too?

1720
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:00,000
What's that? On the first.

1721
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
What happened on the first 12 years ago?

1722
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:05,000
You and Dan getting married, right?

1723
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:07,000
Yes.

1724
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:12,000
God, it's hard enough to remember anniversaries. You want me to remember yours?

1725
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:14,000
Right. On top of everything.

1726
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:15,000
Because mine's important.

1727
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:23,000
But also I was thinking about it and it's next January. I will have been living in California for 20 years.

1728
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:29,000
Not half of my life yet, you know, at that point, but still kind of crazy to think about it.

1729
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:31,000
Yeah, for sure. For sure.

1730
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:39,000
Anyway, I do want to of course give a shout out to our Discord because you can join our Discord server at vognetwork.com slash Discord.

1731
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:44,000
And you guys submit stories throughout the week, which is awesome. And you know, some of them you're probably already hearing on tonight's show.

1732
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:49,000
But another thing I want to bring up because this was something that had a lot of people's attention earlier this week.

1733
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:53,000
On Monday, there were a lot of people that had eclipse fever going on.

1734
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:55,000
Oh, that was this week, yes.

1735
01:42:56,000 --> 01:43:00,000
Yeah, that was Monday. I know, it feels like a lifetime ago with everything that's gone on in the world since then.

1736
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:08,000
But something that was actually submitted in Discord was that there was a Reddit user out there who photographed the eclipse with a Game Boy camera.

1737
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:12,000
That's right, digging out their Game Boy camera to record the occasion.

1738
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:21,000
And they actually have this little print that they did of the eclipse that they printed from their Game Boy camera, which I think is hilarious.

1739
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:29,000
So there it is. And the photo photographer who took that picture says, I should still be shooting Game Boy camera photos in 2024.

1740
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:34,000
So, you know, there's still love. It looks like a dragon's eye is what that picture looks like there.

1741
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:38,000
That whole little, you know, again, it's a radio show, so describing pictures is the best thing.

1742
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
How long before we get the Game Boy Classic Mini?

1743
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:47,000
You know, that seems like a more logical next step than the Nintendo 64.

1744
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:49,000
Yeah.

1745
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:53,000
Especially because, you know, the new 3DSs don't really play the classic Game Boy games anymore.

1746
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
Well, they were on Virtual Console. Very limited selection was.

1747
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:58,000
What's a Virtual Console?

1748
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:08,000
Yeah, right, exactly. But, shoot, if Nintendo can still have the license to do it, you would need to have Nintendo's version of Tetris for that to really be successful.

1749
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:13,000
Although they did a, I mean, to be fair, they did a far better version of Tetris later on.

1750
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:17,000
They did it on the, was it the regular DS? I think it was.

1751
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:22,000
They had a, like Tetris DS, I think was the game. And it was great.

1752
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
If you never checked that one out, that was probably, that was a way better version of Tetris.

1753
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:29,000
Because, you know, the original Tetris on Game Boy was limited to the whole black and white.

1754
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:37,000
It was very, you know, it was rudimentary, but obviously at that time, it was a totally time-sucking game at that time.

1755
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:44,000
But I think they really improved the formula on Tetris DS. Nintendo did make really, really good Tetris games, for what it's worth.

1756
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:48,000
But I was going to ask quickly, the Eclipse, did any of you guys bother to watch it?

1757
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:50,000
Yeah.

1758
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:55,000
But not like the idiot in Washington, looking directly at it.

1759
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:57,000
What a fucking dumb shit.

1760
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:04,000
Yeah, I honestly, since I was busy teaching, I only got to see, I walked out to the parking lot and a bunch of people were looking at it.

1761
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:09,000
And this one guy had a big strip of glass, special glass or whatever. So he was just passing it around.

1762
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:13,000
And everybody would just take a second to like look through the strip at the sun. Oh yeah. So that's what I did.

1763
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:17,000
I looked through the strip at the sun for like half a second. I'm like, hmm, neat. Next person.

1764
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:21,000
I took some pictures through my glasses, but they didn't come out quite right.

1765
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
But what happened is the lens flare was crescent shaped.

1766
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:26,000
Yeah.

1767
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:37,000
And so that was really neat. So I've got, I put those around. I think I've got like some on my, on my, whatever that thing with the pictures, Instagram.

1768
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:43,000
I didn't bother taking pictures because I knew everybody else in the fucking world would be taking pictures.

1769
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:45,000
And then NASA did better pictures than everyone, of course.

1770
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:52,000
It's, it's why I don't take pictures at concerts anymore. Why bother taking pictures at, well, I might take a selfie before it starts or something,

1771
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:58,000
but I don't bother taking pictures at concerts anymore because I can go onto YouTube three hours after it's over and relive the whole thing.

1772
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:02,000
So why bother? That's my attitude anyway. Maybe I'm just old.

1773
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:04,000
Loki, did you bother with the eclipse at all?

1774
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:15,000
Um, we just looked out, you know, at it, you know, I had a thing, an app on my or a page on my phone that told me like when the, you know, the, um, what was the climax of it was.

1775
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
And so I went right there and looked at it like at 10 30 or whenever it was.

1776
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:22,000
Yeah. It was, it was kind of cool to see how cold they got. It was kind of neat, Neil, in that sense.

1777
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:29,000
Yeah. Cause I did like how it was like darker outside area. And obviously we weren't even in, we were what's 60% totality.

1778
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:31,000
We were even 80 or something. It was pretty good.

1779
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
But we weren't in the totality zone, but still it got, it definitely got dark.

1780
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
Like, yeah, Bobby, you know, had a pretty good time with that.

1781
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. I saw those pictures. It looked like they had a good time out there.

1782
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:45,000
So that was, I mean, yeah, I would love to be in a total, um, eclipse area, but unfortunately it's, you know,

1783
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:49,000
Well, you'll get your chance in 2024. Was it, was it 2024?

1784
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:51,000
I think we're going to have to travel though for that.

1785
01:46:52,000 --> 01:47:01,000
Yes. You'd have to travel for that. You'd have to go to, uh, I think, um, I think it's like the, the Southeast part of Texas on up through like, you know, Michigan.

1786
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:05,000
Yeah. I'm just not going to do that.

1787
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:14,000
Fine. All right. Oh, thank you. Bobby Black Wolf says Texas to Indiana is what it is. It's 2024. So there would be some traveling involved.

1788
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:20,000
Anyway, it's an excuse for me to go back to Chicago. Indiana's right next to Chicago. Take a little road trip.

1789
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:24,000
I bet some of my Chicago buddies would want to go see the totality eclipse. It would be fun.

1790
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:29,000
All right. Anyhow, enough science talk, even though you can never really have enough science talk.

1791
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
Let's get to some rapid fire news. Loki.

1792
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:44,000
So, um, we may remember all these wonderful VR titles that were announced during, um, the whole, you know, Bethesda E3 event that they streamed online.

1793
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:52,000
Well, um, so we've got first off, um, Skyrim VR for the PlayStation VR coming out November 17th.

1794
01:47:53,000 --> 01:48:03,000
Doom VFR on the PlayStation VR and the HTC Vive on December 1st. And finally, Fallout 4 VR on the Vive on December 12th.

1795
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:12,000
And that was coming out of QuakeCon 2017, those dates. I am looking forward to Skyrim VR. I will buy that game a million times apparently.

1796
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:17,000
Yes, it's your Mass Effect. It's fine. Everybody's got their thing.

1797
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:19,000
It's a time sink. What can I say?

1798
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:21,000
Fine. Everybody's got their thing.

1799
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:28,000
Um, and then, so, this is kind of cool. A new character got announced for Injustice 2.

1800
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:38,000
And, uh, probably one of my favorite characters out of the whole DC Comics realm, which was, um, Hellboy is going to be coming to Injustice.

1801
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:45,000
They don't think they've announced a date yet for that. Um, let's see here. Oh, September 12th.

1802
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:51,000
And it's going to be, um, available, I guess, when Fighter Pack 2 goes on sale.

1803
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:53,000
Nice.

1804
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:59,000
And so with that, it looks like Raiden's in there and I'm not sure who the other character is.

1805
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
Uh, the Adam.

1806
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:07,000
I just want to check out Injustice 2.

1807
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:09,000
Yeah.

1808
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:12,000
Netherrealm makes good fighting games. I mean, the Mortal Kombat games, the first Injustice was good.

1809
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:13,000
They do.

1810
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:18,000
So I need to check it out. I just, you know, it's one of those things, I'll get around to it one of these days if I can tear myself away from the MMO.

1811
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:21,000
Oh, I'm sorry. He is Dark Horse. That's right. He was in DC.

1812
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:22,000
Yeah.

1813
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:23,000
But, whatever. Who cares? Hellboy's awesome.

1814
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:24,000
Alright.

1815
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:35,000
Uh, moving on. Uh, Horizon Zero Dawn got a new patch this week, uh, where they patched in a mode to make the game more accessible to our pal Bobby Blackwolf.

1816
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:45,000
That's right. An easy mode was put into the game. And, uh, if you don't know the long running inside joke, it's that, uh, when, um, uh, what was it? Borderlands 2 came out.

1817
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:49,000
The Technomancer, Techromancer was the class.

1818
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:56,000
Yes. They, they, they made a, a big faux pas when they were talking about BFF mode and one of the devs kind of put their foot in their mouth.

1819
01:49:56,000 --> 01:50:02,000
And, uh, Bobby had the devs on his show at one point a long time ago and he, he coined the new phrase Blackwolf Friends Forever mode.

1820
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:09,000
So now we joke. Because Bobby Blackwolf is fine. He's not going to take offense if we, at least I don't think he does. If he does get to take offense, he needs to let me know so I stop making the joke.

1821
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:15,000
But, um, uh, if, uh, you know, if, if we, we can always say that the easy modes are always for Bobby Blackwolf.

1822
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:21,000
So we don't have to say that they're for a certain gender or for a certain thing. We say the easy modes for Bobby Blackwolf.

1823
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:29,000
So, uh, Horizon Zero Dawn and, and Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I love the joke and all the easy modes for me. So there you go.

1824
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:35,000
So if you, you need to, um, point that an easy mode was put in a game for somebody, you say it's for Bobby Blackwolf.

1825
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:46,000
So, uh, Horizon Zero Dawn got its, uh, Bobby Blackwolf mode this week, uh, and, uh, this new story difficulty will boost damage and reduce enemy damage considerably.

1826
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:54,000
So I think it's a way that you can kind of play through the game and experience the story without having to worry about, like, actually dying.

1827
01:50:54,000 --> 01:51:03,000
Which, you know what, a lot of story-based games kind of do this now and, you know, like Mass Effect, you know, the, the easy mode in Mass Effect is pretty fucking easy.

1828
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:08,000
Especially if you play, like, in two and three, if you play an Engineer, your little AI will do it all for you.

1829
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:14,000
You really don't have to do a damn thing. So, but, you know, and for some people that takes the thrill out of the game.

1830
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:20,000
But guess what? You get choice. That's the great part about it. You get choice. If you want to just have the AI do it for you, fine.

1831
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:26,000
If not, you can, um, have that challenge. There you go. Bobby Blackwolf mode, now available in Horizon Zero Dawn.

1832
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:35,000
Um, also, this is really cool, uh, Rocket League, of course, is bound for the Switch, uh, which may be a game I end up double-dipping on, who knows.

1833
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:43,000
Uh, some sweet cars are gonna be in this. Super Mario and Metroid themed battle cars are coming to the game. Oh, which reminds me.

1834
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:54,000
So I pre-ordered the, uh, Nintendo 3DS New XL with Samus on it. I like how you're shaking your head, like, the whole, like, we knew we were gonna lose you to that, yep.

1835
01:51:54,000 --> 01:52:05,000
We knew that was gonna happen. This is why they get away with what they do. It really is. It really is. Because you guys, you're just like, I'm not doing it, I'm not gonna buy that because I'm gonna put my foot down.

1836
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:13,000
What, it's Metroid themed? They changed the outside to look like Metroid? Alright, I'm going in.

1837
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:27,000
Read me, drag me, I deserve it, I deserve it. So that's, but yes, I pre-ordered one. Because I want, but I also want to reward when they fucking recognize Metroid, which is a nice change of pace for the company.

1838
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:36,000
So, there you go. Anyway, Mario NSR, Luigi NSR, and Samus' Gunship will be, uh, free and unlockable in the game at launch.

1839
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:48,000
But what's interesting about it, now, if I remember right, the Switch, the Xbox, and the PC will all be cross-play because Sony is, you know, pouting in the corner, they, they, you know, that whole thing.

1840
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:56,000
So, but the other systems are all cross-play. So what happens if I have the Mario car and I'm on Microsoft's platform? Does Microsoft allow that skin to come through?

1841
01:52:56,000 --> 01:53:04,000
Or will the skin, since it is just the skin, will it just not load and just be like a red car or something? I wonder if, I'm curious about how that will work.

1842
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:14,000
But at the same time, I mean, it's not like Microsoft doesn't fucking know who Mario is and is, you know, I don't think they're really gonna care.

1843
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:20,000
There's a part of me that says they're not gonna care if Mario is on their console. They're actually gonna be excited, like, ooh, Mario's on Xbox.

1844
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:24,000
I don't think they would care. You know who would care? Nintendo.

1845
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:25,000
Maybe.

1846
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:29,000
Nintendo cares about its customers and it cares about its IP.

1847
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:37,000
Maybe. Maybe. Alright. Well, anyway, um, let's move on. Dark Soccer, you have some stories for us, right?

1848
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:41,000
Everything I care about is Dragon Ball. Right now.

1849
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:51,000
Um, so just one of the, you know, they're putting in a lot of attacks that were prevalent in the anime and manga into Dragon Ball FighterZ.

1850
01:53:51,000 --> 01:54:02,000
But the big one, and this is actually kind of notable, is that they put in, because one of the new characters that they announced in the current beta is Jirokugo, number 16.

1851
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:09,000
And he's got a self-destruct attack that basically leaves him with like one sliver of life that it's almost an insta-kill.

1852
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:14,000
It's actually pretty, pretty neat to watch it. The animation is fully perfect with the series.

1853
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:30,000
But, um, with that, the other playables right now that they've added in for the current beta is, uh, they have Krillin Piccolo, um, Future Trunks is available, uh, Jirohachigo, and actually Junanago is like an assist for her.

1854
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:34,000
And, um, and Jirokugo, so.

1855
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:46,000
Um, and, guess what? The beta sign-ups are open. They're open! I've, I may have signed up under every email that I have, because I went in a lot.

1856
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:53,000
Um, but yeah, you can go on the Bandai Namco page and sign up. So, do it.

1857
01:54:53,000 --> 01:55:02,000
But the session is going to be, um, September 16th through September 18th. Go play. Go do. And then let me in.

1858
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:06,000
That's how I feel about the Dissidia.

1859
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:07,000
Let the right one in.

1860
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:12,000
That's how I feel about the Final Fantasy Dissidia beta. Like, I was like, when did, like, all my friends started tweeting,

1861
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:16,000
Oh, I got in the beta. I got in the beta. And I was like, when did the fucking sign-ups happen for that beta?

1862
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:21,000
But it was during the weeks that I was away from things, um, that we referenced a couple weeks ago.

1863
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:27,000
Um, and so I guess I, I just missed that whole thing. So I tried to apply for a beta code late, but I didn't get one.

1864
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:33,000
But some of my friends are saying it wasn't very good. So I'm a little, this concerns me type of thing.

1865
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:39,000
So, uh, we'll see. I don't know. I don't know. I still want to try to play it myself, but, um, you know.

1866
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:47,000
Anyway, um, moving on. Let's get to some release dates for this week and travel around the world and check out what's coming out in stores.

1867
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:52,000
How about the U.S. coming up on this Labor Day weekend? Do we have anything right before Labor Day?

1868
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:59,000
Yeah, we actually do have quite a busy week. So starting things off, we have Absolver on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1869
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:07,000
Ark Survival Evolved on PC, Mac and Linux, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, I'm assuming coming out of early access on the PC platforms.

1870
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:15,000
Everybody's Golf on PlayStation 4. Hello Neighbor on PC and Xbox One.

1871
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:27,000
Mario and Rabbids Kingdom Battle on Nintendo Switch. Abduction on PlayStation 4. Pillars of Eternity Complete Edition on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1872
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:37,000
ReCore Definitive Edition on PC and Xbox One. Redout on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Sonic Mania on PC.

1873
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:48,000
Warriors All-Stars on PlayStation 4 and PC. Windjammers on PlayStation 4 and Vita and Yakuza Kiwami on PlayStation 4.

1874
01:56:48,000 --> 01:57:01,000
X-Morph Defense on PC and PlayStation 4. Ys 7 on PC. Life is Strange Before the Storm, Episode 1 on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1875
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:11,000
Resident Evil Revelations on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. And finally, Xenia on PC.

1876
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,000
That's a really busy week.

1877
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:16,000
Yep, it's getting in the fourth quarter already.

1878
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:23,000
I was going to say, believe it or not, here we go. I imagine September will be a little quiet, but then once we start to get into October...

1879
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
September's going to be pretty noisy.

1880
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
September's pretty packed.

1881
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:33,000
Well, the first week in September is not too bad, I guess.

1882
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:37,000
Yeah, but then October is going to start to bring what Mario Odyssey is October.

1883
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:40,000
The first true week in September you only have Destiny 2.

1884
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
Well, that's a pretty big deal.

1885
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:48,000
It's going to just start to ramp up through the end of the year, so here we go. Hold on to your butts.

1886
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:53,000
How about Japan? It's not as busy of a week in Japan, but still, pretty busy week.

1887
01:57:53,000 --> 01:58:01,000
Looks like their big release this week on the PlayStation 4, they have a game called Yoronunai Kuni 2 Shingetsu no Hayayome.

1888
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,000
That is an irregular and a premium box.

1889
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:11,000
I'm not sure what this game is. I don't know much about it, but I do see the cover is two girls that are like, you know, look like they're like vampire hunters.

1890
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:15,000
There's nothing to me on the cover, but they have a whole little talk about...

1891
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:20,000
Aluche has been resurrected by the Kyria as an artificial half-demon.

1892
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:27,000
According to the researchers, Liliana had already disappeared when they found her and said to likely be in the abandoned city in order to recover the stolen Liliana.

1893
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:33,000
The resurrected Aluche heads for the abandoned city, taking along the demon power she does not desire within her.

1894
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:37,000
So it's, you know, girls being possessed by demons. It's one of those types of games.

1895
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:46,000
So you can check that out on the PlayStation 4. That is a Tecmo game, or not Tecmo, um, Koei Tecmo, I think, may have done that.

1896
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:54,000
Let's see, more games that are out this week in Japan. New, Minna no Golf, so the, you know, Everybody's Golf series in Japan gets its release there.

1897
01:58:54,000 --> 01:59:00,000
Ys Origins is out, I'm sorry, that is an Asia region release, but still worth noting.

1898
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:05,000
And also in Japan, Biohazard Revelations Unveiled Edition is out this week.

1899
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:16,000
So that is all on the PlayStation 4. The PlayStation Vita also gets that Yoro no Naikuni 2, as well as a game called Crank In, in regular and limited edition.

1900
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:25,000
That is out on the PlayStation Vita this week. And on the Switch this week, that same Yoro no Naikuni 2 is also on the Switch.

1901
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:34,000
So, uh, you can get that. Or you can get some Mario Kart 8 Joy-Cons in Mario and Luigi. I think those are just, oh, it's the wheels.

1902
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:39,000
It's not the actual Joy-Cons, it's just the silly little steering wheels, um, for those that need them.

1903
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:42,000
Although, I don't know people that actually play with those anymore.

1904
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:47,000
Hey, the 3DS hasn't slowed down on releases. They still are getting a couple releases this week.

1905
01:59:48,000 --> 02:00:01,000
Seikaiju 2 Fuiji No Dungeon 2 is one game that's coming out this week, as well as a game called Atante Jinjuuji Saburo Ghost of the Dusk is also out in Japan this week.

1906
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:05,000
So, um, quite a few releases there as well. How about the UK, DarkSakura?

1907
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:27,000
Oh, just a few things. We have on the 29th, Absolver for PlayStation 4 and PC, Fishing Planet for PC, Killing Floor 2 for the Xbox-y stuff, Windjammers for PS4 and Vita and all of the Sony things.

1908
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:39,000
Um, X-Com 2, War of the Chosen for PlayStation 4, X-Bone and PC. On the 30th, we have Sunless Skies for Mac and PC. And that's it.

1909
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:45,000
Alright. Thank you for that trip around the world, and hopefully there's some games that you're excited to play this week.

1910
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:53,000
Well, every week we open up our mailbag for you guys to send us emails. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to do it.

1911
02:00:53,000 --> 02:01:00,000
And DarkSakura's gonna dive in the mailbag and pick out the emails that she thinks are worthy of reading on the show tonight.

1912
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
DarkSakura! Who emailed us?

1913
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:10,000
First email. Hello Skye, DarkSakura and Loki. Martin the Belgian here. That's like his title now, Martin the Belgian.

1914
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:11,000
That's right.

1915
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:21,000
I wanted to comment on your story last week about online memberships on consoles. I have to agree with Loki's rant. Paying for online on consoles is really just a cash grab.

1916
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:28,000
Sure servers cost money, but they do on PC as well, where paying for online play is unheard of.

1917
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:35,000
I'm letting my PS Plus membership expire because I plan on- because I play all my online games on PC.

1918
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:44,000
The only reason I'm keeping my PS4 is to play the PS4 exclusives, mostly single player. The free PS Plus games are just not worth the monthly cost.

1919
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:52,000
On a brighter note, I will be attending DragonCon this year. Since I live in Atlanta and my friends are going, I don't really have an excuse not to.

1920
02:01:52,000 --> 02:02:00,000
I will be attending Saturday through Monday, and I am very much looking forward to some of the panels that Rob will be on Saturday afternoon in the podcast track.

1921
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:06,000
Besides that, there are usually some interesting video game panels as well.

1922
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:13,000
I remember you mentioning that there would be a way for VOG Network peoples to keep in touch with each other during DragonCon, but I could not find it on the website.

1923
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:15,000
Would it be through Discord?

1924
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:24,000
It is. Sorry. Yes, it is through Discord. Just go to vognetwork.com slash Discord.

1925
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:31,000
You can find the link on the main VOG Network site. It's in the menu under participate, I think, is where it's located.

1926
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:38,000
But most people, I've just been telling you, just go to vognetwork.com slash Discord, and you'll get the invite code right there.

1927
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:44,000
But yeah, participate. It's also under that menu heading on the website.

1928
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:47,000
DarkSoccer brought a gigantic fan with her to the studio.

1929
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,000
Because it gets hot in here.

1930
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
We do have a fan that's right there that's not plugged in.

1931
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:54,000
I know. I'll go turn on the AC fan because I notice it's not running right now.

1932
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:55,000
My arm works.

1933
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:57,000
While DarkSoccer finishes this email.

1934
02:02:57,000 --> 02:03:02,000
Keep up the great show as always, and see you at DragonCon, Rob. All the best, Martin.

1935
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:05,000
It'll be great to meet you at DragonCon. I'm excited. That's great.

1936
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:08,000
I'll have one fan in the audience. Woohoo. That'd be nice.

1937
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
I'll have one fan in my hand.

1938
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:11,000
Woohoo.

1939
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:12,000
Okay, moving on.

1940
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:18,000
Hello, LR. I wanted to address the musings from last week's episode regarding Xbox Live and why it costs money.

1941
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:26,000
As someone who has implemented Xbox Live features into his own games, I can tell you that doing so is ridiculously simple.

1942
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:31,000
Adding matchmaking and setting up online play is as simple as just a few lines of code.

1943
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:35,000
Adding support for leaderboards and achievements is similarly easy.

1944
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:39,000
And the icing on the cake is that you don't need to run a server ever.

1945
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:48,000
Instead, Microsoft runs huge server farms that handle all of the matchmaking as well as other network features for each and every game that supports Xbox Live.

1946
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:53,000
From the 2005 Xbox 360 launch games all the way through this week's new releases.

1947
02:03:53,000 --> 02:04:01,000
Nobody pays for online play on PC because nobody provides those kinds of services on PC.

1948
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:04,000
Want matchmaking in your PC game? You have to set it up yourself.

1949
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:09,000
You either have to pay for a service or set up and run your own using your own servers.

1950
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:16,000
That is complex. It's expensive. And if your game doesn't find an audience right out of the gate, it's a money pit.

1951
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:25,000
At the time Microsoft put together the first version of Xbox Live, online play was not yet popular on game consoles. Bullshit.

1952
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:36,000
I had my Dreamcast Ethernet adapter. And I wanted to use it. And they said, no. We played a lot of Quake. Anyway.

1953
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:44,000
Yeah, that's true. Xbox wasn't the first. But they did make it. Xbox was centralized, I think is the key difference.

1954
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:48,000
It was a console Y type of thing. If that makes sense.

1955
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:58,000
Alright. I'm trying to see where it was. Microsoft was looking for a reason to convince developers to add it to all of their games.

1956
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:04,000
This was the reason they didn't need to pay for it and the amount of effort required was as low as possible.

1957
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:10,000
Microsoft instead chose to pass those costs on to gamers who had actually utilized the service.

1958
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:18,000
As a direct result of the strategy, online play is now a standard feature in our console games today. And it continues to be so.

1959
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:24,000
Does this still need to cost money in 2017? And does it still have to cost as much as it does?

1960
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:30,000
I can't answer those questions. And yes, companies would be foolish to pass on money from customers who are willing to pay for something.

1961
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:44,000
But that is why it's not free. And even though some Play Anywhere games will sport these features on PC with no extra charge, please remember that many, many, many more gamers will be playing these games on Xbox.

1962
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:52,000
Which will easily subsidize the comparably few gamers playing them on super beefy PCs. Anyway, there it is.

1963
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:56,000
And one other thing, Chemical Plant Zone is the best Zona Zona 2. Lies.

1964
02:05:56,000 --> 02:06:04,000
See, I speak the truth. Best music, best ambience, great speed, plus you even get those sweet helix-shaped ramps.

1965
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:17,000
Fuck that underwater part at the end if you take too long. And fuck that bridge of death that can kill you without any warning right before the boss. But everything else about it is great. Yes, truth. Court is closed. Aaron, YYR.

1966
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:32,000
And the things that you named are precisely why I hate the level. Because it's not enough to redeem the great parts of it. Like the helix ramps, which are pretty cool. The helix ramps are great. But I like the spinny ones in the first level.

1967
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:45,000
I do want to thank YYR for that perspective and that email. I do still think that, you know, Microsoft could make some big moves by, you know, undercutting, you know, what PlayStation is charging, what Sony is charging by possibly even going free.

1968
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:55,000
But, you know, I think it is interesting the things you bring up on the whole fact that it's easier, let's say, to put in your game on Xbox Live because of the way Xbox Live is set up than it is on PC.

1969
02:06:55,000 --> 02:07:10,000
But here's my crazy question. And I don't know if you know this, Loki, but then why would it be that EA, I mean, if Xbox is kind of running all that, then why is it that EA pulls support for their games notoriously early and then you can't play them online anymore?

1970
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:18,000
I mean, it's because EA runs their own server thing and everything like that. But yet you still need Xbox Live to play on EA servers, right?

1971
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:35,000
Yeah. And they do have matchmaking servers through Xbox Live and stuff. But I mean, here's the problem, though. It's like it's this. It's also like a perfect example would be the brand new Shadow of War game.

1972
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:48,000
I watched a video this morning regarding that. So, Shadow of War is a game that's coming out that a lot of people were looking forward to that they decided that we're adding microtransactions and loot boxes into the single player portion of the game.

1973
02:07:48,000 --> 02:08:00,000
And you have to buy in game, you have to buy currency to do that. And it's not just cosmetics, it's actual things that you like orks that you can get in the game that you unlock through this as well.

1974
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:15,000
And then now they also have a sponsorship deal that they're doing with Totino's Pizza Rolls. That they're making money from that. So they're making money from, and to be honest, the game that you're buying is not a full game because they have a season pass that's gonna be along with it.

1975
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:23,000
So you're not, you're paying money for the season pass, you're paying money for the in game transactions, they're getting money from this marketing deal with Totino's Pizza Rolls.

1976
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:25,000
And you're not even getting pizza rolls.

1977
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:32,000
And all this shit for their game because they're saying, oh well our game is, we just can't be profitable without that stuff.

1978
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:41,000
Same thing. Well, how did Sony do it all these years with all, how did these companies do it all this time on the Playstation 3 without charging for online?

1979
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:45,000
Were they operating at a loss? Why even put your games on that platform then?

1980
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:55,000
I think it's an excuse because they're making money from all sorts of shit that they're doing now that we just take for granted because this is just the world that we live in now.

1981
02:08:55,000 --> 02:09:04,000
And that's the problem. It's like, yes, I get it. Servers cost money. So does development for your game. So does marketing. Should I pay you extra money because you're marketing your game?

1982
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:10,000
Should I pay you extra money because you wanted some better artists for your game? That's not fucking fair.

1983
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:17,000
Charge more for your game then. Why should I have to pay for online?

1984
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:29,000
The nickel and timing is getting a little extreme. Regardless, I appreciate the perspective from YYR even if I feel like it explains 80% of it to me and there's still some nebula in there.

1985
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:43,000
I do feel at the end of the day, Microsoft could subsidize that cost through other means. Again, even when I pitched the idea on the show last week that Microsoft could really shake things up, I'm not expecting they're ever going to do it.

1986
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:49,000
I don't think it's a realistic thing I'm proposing, but I'm just saying they would turn some fucking heads if they did it.

1987
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:53,000
You know how they subsidize some stuff with that? You notice that in your-

1988
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:54,000
Pizza rolls.

1989
02:09:54,000 --> 02:10:05,000
No, speaking of pizza rolls, you notice that in your little wonderful OS there, there's fucking advertisements. They're making money from those advertisements to subsidize that shit.

1990
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:16,000
And yet the price of the online keeps going up. So don't- they don't need to be defended. They are a big company. They can handle this shit.

1991
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:34,000
I don't understand why we have to pay for online still. We're making excuses for these publishers. Fuck that. Fuck making excuses for them. They are big fucking companies that do not need to be defended. Demand your fucking rights. We didn't pay for online before, why should we have to start paying for it now?

1992
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:38,000
Alright, on that note, let's go to the next email. We have another email, right?

1993
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:39,000
We do.

1994
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:40,000
Alright, awesome.

1995
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:51,000
Evening, OLR. Hope all is well. I just wanted to vent about the Xbox One X Scorpio and SNES Classic Edition. Simply put, both pre-order situations were just a clusterfuck.

1996
02:10:51,000 --> 02:11:04,000
Well, the Xbox One X not so much. After the Xbox Game- Games Rooms conference ended, I was successfully able to order- to secure a Scorpio pre-order. Now, you can't seem to find one anymore.

1997
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:11,000
The pre-order window only lasted for a day, and all allocations were scooped up like Haagen Dazs. Nice plug.

1998
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:17,000
And quick search on eBay shows the Xbox One X selling from $650 to $2,000. Damn.

1999
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:25,000
The SNES Classic was just a crapshoot. With Best Buy and Amazon pre-orders starting in the middle of the night, many people found themselves shit out of luck.

2000
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:38,000
I didn't receive my Amazon notifications that it was available, but somehow, thanks to Wario64, my son waking me up at 4 o'clock Eastern in the morning, I secured one for myself.

2001
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:49,000
I just couldn't believe it myself. The situation was worse than the SNES Classic. Another eBay search shows that the system is selling between $250 to $300+.

2002
02:11:49,000 --> 02:12:03,000
Who is to blame? Is it Nintendo for always limiting stock? Is it the retailers that decided to sell the product in the dead of night? Is it in fucking scalpers who buy a lot of the product and leaves the average customer without any options?

2003
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:11,000
I'd say it's all of them. It seems Nintendo isn't giving a shit anymore about what's going on while their customers are trying to figure out how to do it next week.

2004
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:22,000
Cue Reggie Fils-Aime shrugging his shoulders. That deserves an FUs of the week slot. Well, we already had that out, so no.

2005
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:32,000
Oh, this part's to me. Let's talk fighting games. Dragon Ball FighterZ is looking better and better. I hope you signed up to get into the beta. Fuck, yes, I tried.

2006
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:49,000
I need this game now. I just learned of the newer characters that's in it. Android 16, Android 18 with 17. I'm just going to say Super Saijin Blue. Goku and Vegeta, Krillin and Piccolo.

2007
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:58,000
In the series, it was called Super Saijin God, Super Saijin. It's repetitive, so I'll just say Super Saijin Blue.

2008
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:12,000
Anyway, for example, if Android 18 does her level 3 super and is on the same team with Krillin, they both attack together. Krillin isn't on the team, then she does her super with Android 17 instead. Can't wait.

2009
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:22,000
Been watching more Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite gameplay, and I'm pretty excited for it now. I wasn't due to the demo feeling super underwhelming. Now it's looking insane.

2010
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:34,000
Lastly, whenever you get a chance, I highly recommend the Daigo the Beast Umehara fighting gamers manga. I was able to get a post-evo copy from Focus Attack, but it won't be available until November.

2011
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:47,000
The manga chronicles his early years playing fighting games, and I didn't know he, and I think we're missing a verb here, so I'm just going to read it as, I didn't know he Vampire Savior using Jetta and Bishamon. Dude, Jetta's the best though.

2012
02:13:47,000 --> 02:14:01,000
Hopefully you three are doing well. I truly enjoy listening to you guys and can't thank you enough for providing me your thoughts and opinions with regards to today's state of video gaming. Take care and happy gaming. This is from Tristan.

2013
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:03,000
Be careful with the fan, the noise is coming through.

2014
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:04,000
Okay.

2015
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:05,000
On the mics.

2016
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:09,000
AKA needle crash. Well, they're just hearing my sass. That's my sass.

2017
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:10,000
Thwarp.

2018
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:11,000
Thwarp.

2019
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:21,000
Thank you for that lovely comment at the end of the email. Even though I can't follow the Dragon Ball stuff the way Jamie does, I just, no disrespect, I just don't know the universe as well. But, um, I'm, I-

2020
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:23,000
You're not going to hear it from me again when it's out.

2021
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:36,000
Well, let me, let me put it this way. Even though I don't follow the universe as well, even I looked at that fighting game trailer and I was like, oh, that looks pretty sweet. Like, so who knows, maybe this could be the, the, uh, gateway or what have you.

2022
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:44,000
Uh, and I think you succinctly sum up the, uh, Super Nintendo situation, even though I don't want to necessarily rehash that whole thing. Um, I think you succinctly sum that up.

2023
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:55,000
Tigerclaw in chat says Darkstalker wants to play this Dragon Ball FighterZ game so bad. Maybe if she's really good at it, get in those fighting game tournaments and show them what a badass you are at Dragon Ball FighterZ. That's not gonna happen.

2024
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:58,000
That's. Not. Gonna. Happen.

2025
02:14:58,000 --> 02:14:59,000
That's just not something that interests you, right?

2026
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:05,000
Well, besides that, I can't play games like I used to because of the problems with my, with my wrist.

2027
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:06,000
Oh, right.

2028
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:16,000
Uh, playing for a prolonged period of time just makes it hurt. That's why right now I've been trying to fan myself with the left hand instead of the right.

2029
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
Uh-huh.

2030
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:21,000
That and the shade. The shade of it all.

2031
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:34,000
That's a, um, good kind of like side question. Let's assume any type of physical disabilities or anything you want to say like that. Let's assume any type of like physical limitations weren't on the table. What game do you think you would want to try to play competitively?

2032
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:43,000
Like, for example, on, um, you know, I had, I ran a show for a brief period called Pokestop Podcast with Shane and Shane talked about that he was interested in getting into competitive Pokemon play.

2033
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:49,000
I don't, I, sadly, I don't think he really followed through on that this time. I think that might still be on his agenda, but that's a question for him.

2034
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:55,000
Um, but you know, like is, is there a game that you would be interested in playing competitively if you kind of had that time?

2035
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:56,000
No.

2036
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:57,000
No, really?

2037
02:15:57,000 --> 02:16:00,000
The last game I tried to play competitively was Bust-A-Move 2.

2038
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:01,000
Really?

2039
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:06,000
At Anime Expo. I like played for like a fucking hour beating everybody.

2040
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:07,000
Yeah.

2041
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:18,000
And then I just goofed or something. No, it was the controller that I had, had a stuck button on it. Should I change the button after I lost, but whatever, or change the controller out?

2042
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:27,000
Um, yeah, well, for me, I, you know, I did DDR for that hot minute competitively. Remember that one random ass tournament in the Bay Area? Was it like a high five or something?

2043
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:34,000
I came in fourth in Perfect Attack and people were like, who's this guy? You know, kinda, that was kind of unexpected, I think at that point. So.

2044
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:37,000
Remember Stomp to My Beat?

2045
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:40,000
Yeah, that was, that was one of the huge tournaments where we did that.

2046
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:41,000
It was.

2047
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:44,000
That was where we tried to do Perfect Attack. You and I tried to compete in Perfect Attack.

2048
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:45,000
And the glare on the screen was.

2049
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:53,000
But it was the glare, the glare on the screen. We weren't prepared for it because the machine was outside in the sun and it's just like, we weren't prepared for it. And it just fucked us up.

2050
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:55,000
Was that the one that ate at the break or whatever?

2051
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:57,000
No, it was at Miggle.

2052
02:16:57,000 --> 02:17:05,000
Milpitas Golf Land. I don't think we knew you yet. We didn't really start to know you until OLR started. And this was before, or was it before OLR?

2053
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:07,000
No, we did, um, Scat.

2054
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:13,000
Yeah, no. When, when was Miggle? Was Miggle 2 before OLR? I think it was.

2055
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:14,000
I think Miggle 2 was, yeah.

2056
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:18,000
It was. That was the very first time I ever met Mel B's now wife.

2057
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:19,000
Yeah.

2058
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:27,000
And we, we clicked like that and they came on like the sixth episode of OLR. So I, I met them before OLR started. So yeah, Miggle 2 is before all that.

2059
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:28,000
Yeah.

2060
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:31,000
But anyway, wow, memories. Tell me really.

2061
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:41,000
Uh, but what game would I compete in competitively if I could now? Um, God, I wish I was better at Overwatch. I'm just, I'm not good at first person shooters.

2062
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:43,000
Overwatch makes me vomit.

2063
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:45,000
I love, the characters are so well done though.

2064
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:46,000
But it makes me motion sick.

2065
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
Did you see that Mei comic though?

2066
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:55,000
No, but it still makes me motion sick. That doesn't, the fun parts about the fandom have nothing to do with the fact that the game makes me fucking nauseous.

2067
02:17:55,000 --> 02:18:00,000
Yeah. Well maybe, well who knows? Maybe the universe will spawn a side game someday that won't be the same type of game. That would be kind of cool.

2068
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
Maybe. Then it'll be worth playing.

2069
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:10,000
Like Warcraft spawned World of Warcraft. You never know. There might be something that comes out of that. Um, Maloki, what would you play competitively if you could?

2070
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:17,000
I don't know. I'd probably play something like Player Unknown Battlegrounds or something like that. I don't really know.

2071
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:23,000
Actually, you know what? For me, I might almost say I almost would get back into DDR if I could.

2072
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:24,000
Yeah, DDR I guess.

2073
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:32,000
I think, you know, because I keep forgetting. There is still, like there's been a big renaissance in that whole scene because of round ones, because of Dave and Busters.

2074
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:38,000
And now that there's Ace and there's these games that, you know, maybe we don't follow that scene as closely as we used to in the early days of this show.

2075
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:50,000
But like it's still going and there are still tournaments and stuff and people like doing, and I think it would be hilarious if some damn near 40 year old dude got up there on stage and, you know, could once again get 4th place in Perfect Attack.

2076
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:55,000
Now, I don't have the stamina that I used to, but you know, you never know. Someday.

2077
02:18:55,000 --> 02:19:00,000
So, you're never too old. That's my point. You're never too old.

2078
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:09,000
Alright. Looking in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, sj100matt says, I'm sad nobody has said playing Uniracers competitively.

2079
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:11,000
I don't think there's a competitive scene for that.

2080
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:12,000
Let's see.

2081
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
We'll speedrun all the games.

2082
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:20,000
Actif says, I'd play Splatoon 2 competitively. And Actif says, I could also play Tetris. Oh, that's a very good one.

2083
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:28,000
sj100matt says, I remember Rob was at the DDR tournament at 8 on the break. That was 12 plus years ago. Yes, that is true. That is very true.

2084
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:31,000
Alright. Let's move on. Was that it for emails tonight?

2085
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:37,000
Alright. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email in the future.

2086
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:39,000
In the meantime, we're going to get through the last of our stories tonight.

2087
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:44,000
And I'm going to apologize, you guys, as I mentioned earlier in the show because of kind of the hot mess going on.

2088
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:47,000
I don't have Skype on. Well, I'll try one more time. Maybe it was temporary.

2089
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:49,000
Let me try one more time, see if I can connect to Skype.

2090
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:51,000
Nope. Peter's still being a bitch.

2091
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:53,000
Peter says no.

2092
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:54,000
What?

2093
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:55,000
Peter says no.

2094
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
So, unfortunately, I'm not going to have a Skype line tonight.

2095
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:03,000
But what I will do towards the end of the show, we'll do an open Q&A.

2096
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:06,000
We'll do an AMA in the chat room. Ask Orange Lounge, if you will.

2097
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:08,000
But now the hip new term for it is AMA.

2098
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000
So, we're going to do an AMA in the chat room.

2099
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:12,000
Nope. It's Ask Orange Lounge. We're classic.

2100
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,000
Fine. We'll do an AOL.

2101
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:21,000
You have to make the dial-up sounds. Hello. You've got questions.

2102
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:27,000
Sorry. So, we're going to do an AOL segment at the end of the show instead of Skype line because Skype line is busted.

2103
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:31,000
But hold off on those questions. We'll get to it in just a minute.

2104
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:32,000
We've got some more stories first, though.

2105
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:33,000
Loki.

2106
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:36,000
Yes. Who says that Comcast is not good for anything?

2107
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:44,000
But, apparently, if you want to get into the Call of Duty World War II beta, you can do that if you're an Xfinity customer.

2108
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:51,000
So, you go to xfinity.com slash call of duty between August 31st and August 31st.

2109
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:55,000
You put your account number in there and they'll give you a code or they'll send you a code.

2110
02:20:55,000 --> 02:21:03,000
So, I just did that today and actually they're going to be sending me one. It's apparently in September.

2111
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:07,000
So, September 1st. So, I'll have to check it out.

2112
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:10,000
Even though I'm really interested in this game. But, hey, free.

2113
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:15,000
Free beta. Now you get the chance to test if maybe you'd like it or not, right?

2114
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:16,000
Well, check it out, I guess.

2115
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:25,000
There it is. Alright, well, you guys know I love my Final Fantasy XIV and there's an interesting team up going on here.

2116
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:26,000
Is it Sotino's Pizza Rolls?

2117
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:31,000
Close. Really fucking close. What's the closest thing in the world to pizza rolls?

2118
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:33,000
Actual fucking pizza.

2119
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:40,000
So, Domino's and Square Enix have teamed up to create the Chocobo Chow Pizza.

2120
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:44,000
Is it made of Michelle Greens?

2121
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:50,000
No, it is made of chicken, pineapple, because yes to pineapple on pizza.

2122
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:51,000
Yes.

2123
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:52,000
Yes. Yes.

2124
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:54,000
Let's order one right now.

2125
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:58,000
Alright. You know what? That should be the next Splatfest.

2126
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:00,000
Pineapple, no pineapple.

2127
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:10,000
Pineapple on pizza or never on pizza. Anyway, so, the Chocobo Chow includes, SSU 100 Matt says, this conversation is over.

2128
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:15,000
Anyway, the Chocobo Chow includes chicken, pineapple, capsaicin?

2129
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:19,000
Capsaicin. Capsaicin is what makes peppers hot.

2130
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:22,000
Oh, okay, okay. Mushrooms.

2131
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:23,000
I wouldn't be able to eat it.

2132
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:28,000
Onions and spring onions, which I think are just green onions, basically, are what on this pizza.

2133
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:34,000
So, yeah, this is unfortunately, and maybe why there's ingredients in here I'm not as familiar with.

2134
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:38,000
This is a flavor exclusive to Australia and New Zealand.

2135
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:39,000
Womp, womp.

2136
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:45,000
But, you can get a gaming bundle for $50 Australian, which is about $40 in US dollars.

2137
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:54,000
It's three regular sized pizzas, garlic bread, and a 1.25 liter soda, and that's gonna be about $40, which for three pizzas I guess isn't bad.

2138
02:22:54,000 --> 02:23:01,000
But, you also get a code with that for Final Fantasy XIV Online, which you can redeem for PC or PlayStation 4.

2139
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:02,000
So, there you go.

2140
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:06,000
But, we all know Square is really making their money from that game from the monthly subscription.

2141
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:10,000
So, it's a 30 day hit to get you hooked, and then from there.

2142
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:14,000
And, I don't think the online complete edition includes Stormblood.

2143
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:20,000
I could be wrong, but I don't think, oh no, you get a code to redeem for a chance to win.

2144
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:21,000
Excuse me.

2145
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:24,000
So, yes, the complete edition then would include Stormblood. Oh, you get a chance.

2146
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:28,000
Well, I stand corrected. There you go.

2147
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:33,000
Anyway, there are other Domino's pizzas that have been rebranded, by the way.

2148
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:37,000
Moogle Meat Lovers, not actually made from moogle meat.

2149
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:39,000
It's actually, yeah, other meat.

2150
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:46,000
Curious Cactar, that's the veggie pizza, in case you're curious about vegetables.

2151
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:48,000
That's a Loki pizza.

2152
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,000
I'm veg curious.

2153
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:56,000
Stormblood Supreme and Heavensward Hawaiian.

2154
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:59,000
I don't know if you would put blood and supreme in your...

2155
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:04,000
Wait, wait, wait. Does that make you like pizza pie curious?

2156
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:05,000
He's pie curious.

2157
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:07,000
Pie curious.

2158
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:09,000
I think, Jamie...

2159
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:12,000
I'm not really curious about pies, because I do eat pizza quite a bit.

2160
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:14,000
I had pizza last night, by the way, so...

2161
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:20,000
We need to have a frank conversation on this show about how everybody's a little bit pie curious.

2162
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:26,000
There are flavors of pie you've always wanted to try. Everybody's a little bit pie curious.

2163
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:30,000
Ironically, I don't like regular pie.

2164
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:31,000
Really?

2165
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:32,000
Yeah, I don't like pie.

2166
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,000
What types of sweets do you like?

2167
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,000
I really like a lot of sweets.

2168
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:43,000
How can you say I don't like pie? Does that mean you don't like apple pie, cherry pie, lemon meringue pie, peanut butter pie, pumpkin pie?

2169
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:44,000
There are 50,000.

2170
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:45,000
Yes, all of the above. I do not like any of that.

2171
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:47,000
I want peanut butter pie.

2172
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:50,000
Are you saying you're not even a little pie curious?

2173
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:52,000
I'm not pie curious in that sense, no.

2174
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:55,000
Not dessert pie curious.

2175
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:56,000
Wow.

2176
02:24:57,000 --> 02:24:58,000
I can't handle it.

2177
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:00,000
Not even a cream pie.

2178
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:03,000
That's probably for the best.

2179
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:08,000
Stopy in Chat says, I'm piesexual. Ever seen the movie American Pie?

2180
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:09,000
Yes, I have.

2181
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:16,000
All right. Anyway, I did notice though that another there was yet another Hawaiian flavor in the Final Fantasy.

2182
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:23,000
I think Yoshi P agrees that pineapple should go on pizza because that's two of those pizzas that have pineapples on it.

2183
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:27,000
Do veggie pizzas have pineapple? Not usually. I don't think they usually, but it's usually greens.

2184
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:29,000
That would be a fruit pizza.

2185
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:32,000
Oh, that's right. A pineapple is a fruit, of course. So yes. All right.

2186
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:35,000
Do they have fruit pizza? What other fruits go on pizzas?

2187
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:36,000
Tomatoes.

2188
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:41,000
Tomatoes. That's right. Even though most people don't think of tomatoes as fruit, but yeah.

2189
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:43,000
That's really all they offer.

2190
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:44,000
Avocado.

2191
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:46,000
Is avocado a fruit?

2192
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:47,000
Avocado is a fruit.

2193
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:48,000
Do they even put that on pizza?

2194
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:50,000
And I've had it on pizza before, yes.

2195
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:51,000
You can, yeah.

2196
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:52,000
Sounds like California.

2197
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:53,000
It sounds like a California Pizza Kitchen thing.

2198
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:54,000
They put avocado on everything.

2199
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:56,000
Exactly. All right.

2200
02:25:57,000 --> 02:25:59,000
SSJ100 Matt is like, this needs to stop.

2201
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:09,000
I feel like SSJ100 Matt is to pineapple on pizza as Rob Roberts is to mayonnaise on anything.

2202
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:13,000
My wife would sure like this to stop so we can get home and watch Game of Thrones already.

2203
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:15,000
Oh, Jesus Christ. Fine. We'll go on to the next story.

2204
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:17,000
Because she can't keep herself off social media.

2205
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:22,000
You know what? I've just been watching everything on YouTube just now, and oh my God, I called it.

2206
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:24,000
How come you call a show that you don't watch?

2207
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:26,000
I do. I've been watching this season.

2208
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:28,000
Oh, okay. I thought you didn't watch the show.

2209
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:33,000
But I went back and watched everything about the characters I gave a shit about.

2210
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:41,000
And honestly enough, I've called everything to this episode.

2211
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:45,000
This whole season has been a complete non-surprise.

2212
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:48,000
I feel like the one guy left who cares more about Twin Peaks,

2213
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:55,000
which has been like sitting through like 12 episodes of like what the fuck is going on, which is fine.

2214
02:26:55,000 --> 02:27:01,000
Because that's David Lynch. You watch a David Lynch thing, there's always going to be a little bit of what the fuck is going on.

2215
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:07,000
In the old Twin Peaks, Lost Highway, fucking any of his movies, there's always going to be a little bit of what the fuck is going on.

2216
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:12,000
But like the last two episodes have really started to say like, this is what's fucking going on.

2217
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:16,000
And it's been like, oh damn, so I'm really, I fucking want to watch Twin Peaks.

2218
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:19,000
And here's the crazy part. Sorry, Loki.

2219
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:29,000
The Twin Peaks finale is at Dragon Con, yet there's no official viewing on Sunday of the Twin Peaks finale.

2220
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:32,000
How did they miss an opportunity like that? I don't understand.

2221
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:33,000
Licensing?

2222
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:37,000
I guess. I guess maybe showing it in a room or something, but I guess they'll have to be unofficial viewings.

2223
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:41,000
But it's Sunday night, which if I remember right, is the Masquerade.

2224
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:47,000
The GLBT event is also Sunday night, which is weird. I seem to remember it was on Saturday night every other year.

2225
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:53,000
So it's like, probably just have to download it and watch it on my phone on the plane home or something.

2226
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:55,000
But I'm really excited about that.

2227
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:59,000
Alright, anyway, let's get to some more stories.

2228
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:01,000
So after pizza, Dark Sakura.

2229
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:07,000
Oh god, I want pizza though now. I'm hungry. Even after all that delicious Korean food I had.

2230
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:13,000
So, speaking of things that are not delicious, it would be the way the EA was treating Mass Effect.

2231
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:17,000
Except for one glorious nugget of pineapple on the pizza.

2232
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:21,000
Basically, Mass Effect isn't dead.

2233
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:33,000
EA Executive Vice President Patrick Soderlund said that the performance of Mass Effect Andromeda has not doomed the series.

2234
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:35,000
And the quote on here is,

2235
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:41,000
I've seen people saying, oh EA's not making another Mass Effect. I see no reason why we shouldn't come back to Mass Effect.

2236
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:47,000
Why not? It's a spectacular universe and it's a loved series. It has a big fan base.

2237
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:50,000
And it's a game that has done a lot for EA and for Bioware.

2238
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:54,000
So they're saying that they need to be cautious about it and they need to be careful.

2239
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:59,000
But they are planning on eventually coming back to it from what they're saying.

2240
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:04,000
But we'll see. They've said this shit before.

2241
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:10,000
When was the last time we got the Lost Vikings game, really?

2242
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:15,000
Well, they throw dumb little Lost Vikings references into later games.

2243
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:16,000
They're in World of Warcraft.

2244
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:18,000
And they're heroes in Heroes of the Storm.

2245
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:19,000
Yeah.

2246
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:21,000
So, you never know.

2247
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:23,000
Well, fuck Anthem.

2248
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:29,000
I would like to see Mass Effect come back. I'm just worried about if EA is saying this.

2249
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:34,000
Would EA let somebody who's not Bioware develop a Mass Effect game? I'm a little worried about that.

2250
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:39,000
I mean, now it ultimately depends on who's involved.

2251
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:46,000
But I don't want a return to the Mass Effect franchise to be, oh, it's a clicker game on mobile.

2252
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:49,000
You have to mine the planets for resources.

2253
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:50,000
I want the mic to pick this up.

2254
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:51,000
What?

2255
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:54,000
Thwarp.

2256
02:29:54,000 --> 02:30:00,000
Thwarp. Furious fanning ensues. I'm shoving breadsticks into my purse as we speak.

2257
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:05,000
Just a couple more stories for you guys and then we'll do some Ask Orange Lounge. Loki.

2258
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:10,000
So, Sega is developing a Fist of the North Star game.

2259
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:13,000
It's going to be the Yakuza team working on that.

2260
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:17,000
And it looks pretty awesome based off the trailer that they have right now.

2261
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:19,000
It's only confirmed to be coming out in Japan.

2262
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:26,000
But hopefully we'll see more details from during Tokyo Game Show, which is going to be the end of September.

2263
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:32,000
I can't believe Tokyo Game Show is sneaking up on us like that.

2264
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:33,000
Yep.

2265
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:36,000
Oh, man. There's going to be some exciting announcements at Tokyo Game Show.

2266
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:39,000
There's got to be. I feel like other companies have been saving stuff for it.

2267
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:41,000
And maybe we'll get an update on some of these games.

2268
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:42,000
Sony will actually have something coming out.

2269
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:44,000
Heck yeah. I'm excited. I'm excited.

2270
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:48,000
Alright. Well, one more story for you guys tonight.

2271
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:53,000
And it has to do with the game that nobody asked for, but you're going to get it anyway.

2272
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:57,000
And it's Bubsy! The Wooly Strike Back.

2273
02:30:57,000 --> 02:31:02,000
And there's even going to be a limited PlayStation 4 edition for you Ultimate Bubsy fans.

2274
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:08,000
That will include the software, the original soundtrack, Bubsy's business card.

2275
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:11,000
You know, for your file.

2276
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:13,000
And a mystery postcard.

2277
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:19,000
This extremely limited physical edition will be available at Best Buy, GameStop, and other online retailers.

2278
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:21,000
It's only 40 bucks for what it's worth.

2279
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:25,000
So I will, despite the fact I'm having a laugh here at Bubsy, who knows?

2280
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:27,000
The game may actually be good. Who knows?

2281
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:33,000
But this is only 40 bucks and you have this extra junk.

2282
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:34,000
But it's extra stuff.

2283
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:36,000
Well, you actually start at 64.

2284
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:38,000
Like going, what the fuck? I'm not buying that.

2285
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:43,000
So, but anyway, the release date for all this, get this.

2286
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:46,000
October 31st, 2017.

2287
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:49,000
The perfect Halloween gift for your friends.

2288
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:51,000
Bubsy, The Wooly Strike Back.

2289
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:54,000
Available on PlayStation 4, Steam, and Rage Nator.

2290
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:57,000
Are you out there? Because they are actually advertising good old games.

2291
02:31:57,000 --> 02:32:02,000
GOG.COM is one of the platforms that Bubsy is going to be available on right there.

2292
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:04,000
So, we'll see.

2293
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,000
There's a new trailer out there if you want to watch that.

2294
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:08,000
I'm happy to see that Accolade is back.

2295
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:14,000
Wake me up when they do Accolade Comics, which was one of my favorite Commodore 64 games in the world.

2296
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:20,000
Anyway, since we are unfortunately prevented from having a Skype line tonight,

2297
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:26,000
let's quickly open it up to any questions in our chat room with a segment that we call Ask Orange Lounge.

2298
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:30,000
In the past, I would usually make you send me a private message, but I'm not going to do that.

2299
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:35,000
If you want to just ask an open question chat, it could be about games, it could be about pretty much anything.

2300
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:37,000
I also have last minute stories, I have two.

2301
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:39,000
Good, because we need a few minutes for some questions to come in.

2302
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:41,000
So, Ask Orange Lounge, in the meantime, stories.

2303
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:48,000
Along with our Half-Life 3 story news, if you are looking to play Half-Life 3,

2304
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:50,000
well, I got some news for you actually.

2305
02:32:50,000 --> 02:33:00,000
Just released today, ModDB actually released, it's called Half-Life 2 Aftermath.

2306
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:06,000
And so you can check out some of the beta stuff that leaked out from Half-Life 2 Episode 3.

2307
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:11,000
I guess that they had been developing some stuff leaked out and they were working on making it playable.

2308
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:18,000
So you can play around with some of the things that didn't actually make it into Half-Life 3 or Half-Life 2 Episode 3.

2309
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:23,000
Yeah, so just go check it out, moddb.com, and there's a link there.

2310
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:25,000
So, that's kind of neat.

2311
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:32,000
And it includes 11 levels that were created by Valve between 2012 and 2013, and 10 for Half-Life 3.

2312
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:38,000
Four demonstration levels, there's different NPC, or no NPCs.

2313
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:45,000
You have some weapons and some characters, enemy types that were made for the game that never ended up coming out.

2314
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:49,000
And then finally, last but not least, this could be a tease of something that we might hear about soon,

2315
02:33:49,000 --> 02:34:01,000
but there is a listing on Target for Bethesda Game of Thrones, which could be a Skyrim-type game for Game of Thrones,

2316
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:04,000
or it could be just some erroneous shit that they have on Target.com.

2317
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:05,000
Yes.

2318
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:11,000
Whatever the case may be, there is something there that says Bethesda and Game of Thrones and let our imaginations run wild.

2319
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:16,000
But doesn't Telltale have the Game of Thrones stuff, or is it one of those things where maybe they license it to multiple people?

2320
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:17,000
They license it to multiple people.

2321
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:18,000
I guess like Walking Dead did that.

2322
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:22,000
Well, they had a Game of Thrones game that came out at one time, but...

2323
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:24,000
Telltale, I think, did one, didn't they?

2324
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:31,000
Well, they did one too, but there was an actual Game of Thrones game that came out that was something completely separate.

2325
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:34,000
How to kill everyone and get away with it.

2326
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:36,000
So, that's it.

2327
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:45,000
All right. Well, just a couple questions are coming in our chat room, but I guess we have enough that we can actually answer some questions here.

2328
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:47,000
Again, so in absence of a Skype line tonight...

2329
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:56,000
Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.

2330
02:34:56,000 --> 02:35:00,000
What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?

2331
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:04,000
I haven't sung this song in forever, it seems.

2332
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:07,000
And I think I might have forgotten all the lyrics.

2333
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:09,000
Never had lyrics.

2334
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:11,000
Whee!

2335
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:13,000
There's gonna be people that have been listening to the show for like three years that are like,

2336
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:15,000
Why does he do this? Why does he sing?

2337
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:18,000
They're gonna make the Rob Roberts Orange Lounge Music Compilation.

2338
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:20,000
That fucking already happened at some point.

2339
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:21,000
No, they had to do the...

2340
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:23,000
No, remember when John was still listening to the show?

2341
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:25,000
He did fucking, there was that Step Mania thing.

2342
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:29,000
Him and Dark Tetsuya put together like a whole Step Mania thing, and they had a song.

2343
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:32,000
There was a song in it that went Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.

2344
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:33,000
It was one of your fucking things.

2345
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:34,000
It was Rob Period.

2346
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:35,000
Yeah, it was Rob Period.

2347
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:37,000
And then fucking Scott Rubin from All Games got a hold of it.

2348
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:42,000
And like, I would be tuning into All Games Radio randomly one day and all of a sudden I'd hear Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.

2349
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:45,000
It was Scott's like favorite fucking thing to come from this show.

2350
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:48,000
And I'd be like, What? What is happening here on this day?

2351
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:51,000
By the way, congrats to him on the addition to his family.

2352
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:53,000
Oh, yes, of course, of course.

2353
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:54,000
Yes.

2354
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:56,000
Although he's probably out of Burning Man this weekend.

2355
02:35:56,000 --> 02:36:01,000
He's probably doing ice cream at the Playa if I follow his life correctly.

2356
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:03,000
Because I know he's in ice cream, he's in Burning Man.

2357
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:06,000
It just seems like a very logical marriage of the two.

2358
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:08,000
Let's go get pizza.

2359
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:09,000
You want pizza?

2360
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:10,000
Yes.

2361
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:13,000
I'll put something on it that I'm not allowed to mention because it has to do with 100 Matt.

2362
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:16,000
I like him a lot and I want to pineapple.

2363
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:17,000
Fine. You be the bitch.

2364
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:18,000
All right.

2365
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:21,000
Let's get to some questions in our chat room.

2366
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:22,000
There's actually quite a few here tonight.

2367
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:23,000
Let's do it.

2368
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:27,000
I apologize if we don't do all of these, but I will do a few of these.

2369
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:31,000
Bobby Black Wolf is asking question number one.

2370
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:34,000
What is your favorite troll question and why is it?

2371
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:37,000
Why is Chrono Trigger better than Super Metroid?

2372
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:39,000
What is your favorite troll question?

2373
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:41,000
This one.

2374
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:45,000
Actually, my favorite troll questions are these.

2375
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:51,000
On a scale of 1 to 10, how much do you love this movie Showgirls and why did you say 10?

2376
02:36:51,000 --> 02:36:53,000
I do like those types of questions.

2377
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:55,000
They're very good for trolling.

2378
02:36:55,000 --> 02:37:01,000
Another trend I've seen on Twitter recently, and I forget the guy's username off the top of my head.

2379
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:02,000
I think it's NintendoLegend.

2380
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:03,000
I think it's his name on Twitter.

2381
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:08,000
And he likes to do these polls that are which of these games is the worst game ever?

2382
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:10,000
And you'll have two choices.

2383
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:13,000
Super Mario Brothers 3 and Super Mario Brothers World or something like that.

2384
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:17,000
The two choices will be like The Legend of Zelda and Super Metroid.

2385
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:19,000
And people will reply and be like, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.

2386
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:20,000
It's really funny.

2387
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:23,000
The only way to win is not to play.

2388
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:24,000
Essentially.

2389
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:30,000
Do you have a favorite troll question, Dark Sakura?

2390
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:31,000
I guess that's a no.

2391
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:33,000
Or she's trolling me now.

2392
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:34,000
That was me trolling you.

2393
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:35,000
All right.

2394
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:36,000
Act Deft.

2395
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:39,000
Question number two.

2396
02:37:39,000 --> 02:37:43,000
What's your favorite Pokemon and why?

2397
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:44,000
That's a good question.

2398
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:45,000
It's game related.

2399
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:47,000
What's your favorite Pokemon and why?

2400
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:50,000
I guess I'll start because I don't see my co-hosts at this point.

2401
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:51,000
I have one.

2402
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:52,000
Okay, what's your favorite, Dark Sakura?

2403
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:53,000
Houndoom because Goth.

2404
02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:55,000
Houndoom because you like Goths?

2405
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:56,000
Okay.

2406
02:37:56,000 --> 02:37:57,000
Who's Goth?

2407
02:37:57,000 --> 02:37:58,000
Okay, I like that answer.

2408
02:37:58,000 --> 02:37:59,000
Loki, do you have a favorite Pokemon and why?

2409
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:00,000
Pokemon.

2410
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:01,000
Kidding.

2411
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:02,000
I don't.

2412
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:03,000
I mean.

2413
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:07,000
How about like Porygon because he makes loud annoying screeches.

2414
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:08,000
I'm just kidding.

2415
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:10,000
I mean, it's probably like Eevee or something.

2416
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:11,000
Eevee's cute.

2417
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:13,000
All the Eeveelutions are popular.

2418
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:14,000
Yeah.

2419
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:18,000
My favorite hands down, and I'm sorry to go gen one, but I have to because, you know,

2420
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:23,000
I remember watching the anime back in the day when the toys were at Burger King when

2421
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:24,000
I was in college.

2422
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:28,000
Jigglypuff is forever my fave because, and actually on my fave,

2423
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:32,000
and actually on my phone background, I even have a little Jigglypuff because.

2424
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:33,000
Jigglycaliente.

2425
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:34,000
Not Jigglycaliente.

2426
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:37,000
Well, that was the one time I was ever not.

2427
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:40,000
I was almost on TV was asking Jigglycaliente a question.

2428
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:44,000
I thought yours was the picture of Jigglycaliente's face on Jigglypuff.

2429
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:45,000
No, no.

2430
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:46,000
It's this.

2431
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:48,000
It's the little, little cute little background.

2432
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:49,000
Oh, that one.

2433
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:54,000
I thought I felt for sure you had that your background was Jigglycaliente's face on Jigglypuff.

2434
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:58,000
That's probably what you set as my picture whenever somebody call, whenever I call you.

2435
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:00,000
No, you're, you're still, um.

2436
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:01,000
Trixie.

2437
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:02,000
You're still Trixie.

2438
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:03,000
And yours is Katya, yeah.

2439
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:04,000
Contact, Rob, contact.

2440
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:05,000
Aliens.

2441
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:06,000
Oh, honey.

2442
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:07,000
Um, by the way, they're getting a show.

2443
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:08,000
Touch.

2444
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:09,000
I'm so happy for them.

2445
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:10,000
I know.

2446
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:11,000
Happy?

2447
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:12,000
Anyway, okay, back to the question.

2448
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:16,000
I'm always, I always feel, I bless, I thank, I thank gay God every day that Trixie follows

2449
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:17,000
me on Twitter.

2450
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:18,000
I really do.

2451
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:19,000
But anyway.

2452
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:20,000
Katya to follow me.

2453
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:21,000
I met Katya.

2454
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:22,000
Katya's great.

2455
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:23,000
And I met Detox.

2456
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:24,000
What was the question?

2457
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:25,000
Oh, yes.

2458
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:26,000
Favorite Pokemon.

2459
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:27,000
It's Jigglypuff.

2460
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:29,800
And because, because she has the microphone and I always thought it was hilarious how

2461
02:39:29,800 --> 02:39:33,820
she got really mad when people fell asleep when she's trying to sing or in my case talk

2462
02:39:33,820 --> 02:39:35,420
and she would draw on their face with a marker.

2463
02:39:35,420 --> 02:39:36,580
I always thought that was really funny.

2464
02:39:36,580 --> 02:39:39,140
So um, yeah, Jigglypuff.

2465
02:39:39,140 --> 02:39:40,140
Forever my face.

2466
02:39:40,140 --> 02:39:41,140
Fave.

2467
02:39:41,140 --> 02:39:42,140
All right.

2468
02:39:42,140 --> 02:39:43,640
Uh, let's see.

2469
02:39:43,640 --> 02:39:44,640
Next question.

2470
02:39:44,640 --> 02:39:46,140
Question number three.

2471
02:39:46,140 --> 02:39:52,940
Uh, Stoppy in chat asks, uh, Rob, this weekend I went to my first live Rocky Horror show

2472
02:39:52,960 --> 02:39:54,920
performance and I had a blast.

2473
02:39:54,920 --> 02:39:57,580
I finally get that movie.

2474
02:39:57,580 --> 02:40:00,860
If there was a game based on Rocky Horror, how would you make it?

2475
02:40:00,860 --> 02:40:04,100
Survival horror, rhythm, point and click.

2476
02:40:04,100 --> 02:40:08,940
Well believe it or not, Stoppy, there are already two games based on the Rocky Horror

2477
02:40:08,940 --> 02:40:14,700
show, not the picture show, but the show because the Rocky Horror show was the play that started

2478
02:40:14,700 --> 02:40:15,700
it all right.

2479
02:40:15,700 --> 02:40:16,700
And the picture show was just the movie.

2480
02:40:16,700 --> 02:40:22,220
But the play is, I think to this day, still kind of a bigger deal in the UK.

2481
02:40:22,220 --> 02:40:25,820
Like I'm sure the movie, the movie's there and there's some casts, but I think the play

2482
02:40:25,820 --> 02:40:26,820
is still a big deal.

2483
02:40:26,820 --> 02:40:27,820
We had the Broadway release.

2484
02:40:27,820 --> 02:40:29,180
And that's where it started.

2485
02:40:29,180 --> 02:40:34,700
But because of that, in the 80s on the Commodore 64, there was actually a Rocky Horror show

2486
02:40:34,700 --> 02:40:38,020
game and it was kind of more like a point and click type adventure.

2487
02:40:38,020 --> 02:40:43,820
I mean a Commodore 64 style, let you say maniac mansion, but like not nearly that good.

2488
02:40:43,820 --> 02:40:44,980
It was very rudimentary.

2489
02:40:44,980 --> 02:40:51,220
Uh, then when they did a revival in the early 2000s, I want to say it was whenever, I think

2490
02:40:51,220 --> 02:40:56,380
it was when Anthony Stewart Head took the role of Frank-N-Furter, which by the way,

2491
02:40:56,380 --> 02:40:59,700
glorious casting, I know, right?

2492
02:40:59,700 --> 02:41:04,140
They released a CD-ROM version that was kind of like an updated version of that game.

2493
02:41:04,140 --> 02:41:08,700
So technically, it has already existed as a game.

2494
02:41:08,700 --> 02:41:14,900
So for that reason, I kind of say, yeah, point and click, but that's because I'm already

2495
02:41:14,900 --> 02:41:17,880
tarnished knowing that those other games exist.

2496
02:41:17,880 --> 02:41:20,740
So I think it would have to be a bit of a point and click adventure, but I would like

2497
02:41:20,740 --> 02:41:22,920
to see something that would be like a sequel.

2498
02:41:22,920 --> 02:41:26,840
But a rhythm or music game would be kind of cool, but I think it would be like a one-off

2499
02:41:26,840 --> 02:41:27,840
cheap little thing.

2500
02:41:27,840 --> 02:41:30,980
I don't think it would be like an actual, like full on game.

2501
02:41:30,980 --> 02:41:33,420
So there you go.

2502
02:41:33,420 --> 02:41:34,420
All right.

2503
02:41:34,420 --> 02:41:37,940
Uh, let's see, uh, moving on with a couple other questions here.

2504
02:41:37,940 --> 02:41:42,700
Let's go to Ice P in our chat with question number four.

2505
02:41:42,700 --> 02:41:44,780
Have you played Slime Rancher?

2506
02:41:44,780 --> 02:41:47,040
No, I have not.

2507
02:41:47,040 --> 02:41:51,880
But this game just came up today in conversation and somebody was telling it, it wasn't even

2508
02:41:51,880 --> 02:41:52,960
during the show.

2509
02:41:52,960 --> 02:41:54,400
Somebody was telling me I should play it.

2510
02:41:54,400 --> 02:41:55,400
So yeah, it looks cool.

2511
02:41:55,400 --> 02:41:56,400
Yeah.

2512
02:41:56,400 --> 02:41:57,400
I will check it out.

2513
02:41:57,400 --> 02:41:58,400
It does look cool.

2514
02:41:58,400 --> 02:41:59,400
I'll check it out.

2515
02:41:59,400 --> 02:42:00,400
Have you, you haven't played it either, right?

2516
02:42:00,400 --> 02:42:01,400
I've watched videos of people playing it.

2517
02:42:01,400 --> 02:42:02,400
So I know what it's about.

2518
02:42:02,400 --> 02:42:03,400
What the hell is it?

2519
02:42:03,400 --> 02:42:05,200
It's basically like it says Slime Rancher.

2520
02:42:05,200 --> 02:42:10,480
So you're, you build a ranch and you're going out to the wild and catching slimes with like

2521
02:42:10,480 --> 02:42:16,040
this like vacuum gun thing and the slimes generate like currency that you build ranch

2522
02:42:16,040 --> 02:42:17,360
and stuff and they do different things.

2523
02:42:17,360 --> 02:42:18,360
That sounds cute.

2524
02:42:18,360 --> 02:42:21,960
So it can be like tricky cause like some of the slimes like they stay on the top of each

2525
02:42:21,960 --> 02:42:24,240
other and escape and you have to go catch them.

2526
02:42:24,240 --> 02:42:26,360
So it's kind of like Monster Hunter, it sounds like.

2527
02:42:26,360 --> 02:42:27,800
No, it's very cute.

2528
02:42:27,800 --> 02:42:28,840
It's less Monster Hunter.

2529
02:42:28,840 --> 02:42:30,600
You're not really fighting things.

2530
02:42:30,600 --> 02:42:33,080
It's just cool.

2531
02:42:33,080 --> 02:42:34,080
You should check it out.

2532
02:42:34,080 --> 02:42:35,080
It's cute.

2533
02:42:35,080 --> 02:42:36,080
All right.

2534
02:42:36,080 --> 02:42:38,000
Uh, Darsakra, is that anything you've ever played?

2535
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:39,000
I'm not interested in it.

2536
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:40,000
It sounds really dull.

2537
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:41,000
It's cute.

2538
02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:42,000
You should check it out.

2539
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:43,000
Lisa, watch the trailer.

2540
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:44,200
Kossin in chat.

2541
02:42:44,200 --> 02:42:45,600
Question number five.

2542
02:42:45,600 --> 02:42:48,520
What's the best flavor of chips in the world?

2543
02:42:48,520 --> 02:42:49,720
That's a good question.

2544
02:42:49,720 --> 02:42:50,720
You know, I do love.

2545
02:42:50,720 --> 02:42:51,920
Do they mean chips or crisps?

2546
02:42:51,920 --> 02:42:54,300
I think we mean American chips in this case.

2547
02:42:54,300 --> 02:42:59,400
So I always get super involved in these Lay's do us a flavor contest, which were, which

2548
02:42:59,400 --> 02:43:02,600
were on a break last year, but they're back this year and you know, they have the new

2549
02:43:02,600 --> 02:43:05,220
flavors and you know, I got to try every single one.

2550
02:43:05,220 --> 02:43:08,880
So here's, I just want to give you quickly my hot take on the new Lay's flavors because

2551
02:43:08,880 --> 02:43:10,520
it's important.

2552
02:43:10,520 --> 02:43:15,640
Eating bagel plus cream cheese tastes exactly the same to me as Maui onion.

2553
02:43:15,640 --> 02:43:19,320
I don't know why bagel and cream cheese tastes like Maui onion, I guess because you know,

2554
02:43:19,320 --> 02:43:22,960
onion bagel, but they taste the exact same to me.

2555
02:43:22,960 --> 02:43:28,820
Fried green tomato, uh, has a mayo aftertaste to me and I can't fucking stand it.

2556
02:43:28,820 --> 02:43:33,360
So that leaves by default, the winner crispy taco, which does taste like it tastes like

2557
02:43:33,360 --> 02:43:34,360
a taco.

2558
02:43:34,360 --> 02:43:38,720
So is it fried green tomato?

2559
02:43:38,720 --> 02:43:43,920
But my favorite flavor of chips, honestly, I'm going to go basic because sometimes the

2560
02:43:43,920 --> 02:43:47,360
basics are the best Pringles, which aren't even really potato.

2561
02:43:47,360 --> 02:43:48,360
They're potato crisps.

2562
02:43:48,360 --> 02:43:51,880
Like you can't even really say the chips, but Pringles, sour cream and onion, like forever

2563
02:43:51,880 --> 02:43:53,600
my sentimental fave for sure.

2564
02:43:53,600 --> 02:43:55,340
Uh, Loki, do you have a favorite?

2565
02:43:55,340 --> 02:43:59,560
It's a little unconventional, but I'm going to say poker because it tastes like smoking

2566
02:43:59,560 --> 02:44:02,320
and despair.

2567
02:44:02,320 --> 02:44:04,400
Dar Sakura.

2568
02:44:04,400 --> 02:44:10,800
I've always been really fond of sun chips, but I, but I do have like the plain sun chips,

2569
02:44:10,800 --> 02:44:16,240
but I do have a special place in my heart for Charles chips, which you can only get

2570
02:44:16,240 --> 02:44:18,240
in the Southeast.

2571
02:44:18,240 --> 02:44:21,880
And um, what was the other one?

2572
02:44:21,880 --> 02:44:28,160
The Maui onion, but it's that same flavor that has the zaps, zaps or is it a different

2573
02:44:28,160 --> 02:44:29,160
one?

2574
02:44:29,160 --> 02:44:31,000
Zaps has that nasty pickle shit.

2575
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:32,000
That's gross.

2576
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:33,000
Okay.

2577
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:34,000
Maui onion.

2578
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:37,720
Oh, I remember what my actual favorite is, Rob.

2579
02:44:37,720 --> 02:44:42,840
It's the Tara sweets and beets, sweet potato and beet chips.

2580
02:44:42,840 --> 02:44:43,840
All right.

2581
02:44:43,840 --> 02:44:47,200
We're going to do just a few more here, but we're going to do these kinds of lightning

2582
02:44:47,200 --> 02:44:48,200
rounds.

2583
02:44:48,200 --> 02:44:51,080
We're going to pick it up and answer these fast Akuma JP.

2584
02:44:51,080 --> 02:44:54,120
Why doesn't OLR play the uncharted series?

2585
02:44:54,120 --> 02:44:56,600
Um, I've dabbled in it a little bit.

2586
02:44:56,600 --> 02:44:57,600
You want to buy it for me?

2587
02:44:57,600 --> 02:44:59,400
It's you can borrow mine if you want.

2588
02:44:59,400 --> 02:45:01,040
I'm not interested in it.

2589
02:45:01,040 --> 02:45:06,960
I honestly, I tried, but I just, my gamer ADD kicked in and I never finished.

2590
02:45:06,960 --> 02:45:08,440
The games weren't bad though.

2591
02:45:08,440 --> 02:45:11,520
I probably played more tomb Raider than I did uncharted one or two though.

2592
02:45:11,520 --> 02:45:16,480
I really need to go back and give the trilogy a go on a PS4 Loki.

2593
02:45:16,480 --> 02:45:17,480
I'm men just haven't.

2594
02:45:17,480 --> 02:45:18,480
They look neat.

2595
02:45:18,480 --> 02:45:19,960
I just haven't gone around to them.

2596
02:45:19,960 --> 02:45:21,440
We can't play all the games.

2597
02:45:21,440 --> 02:45:22,440
We can't.

2598
02:45:22,440 --> 02:45:26,520
Um, it never really set off an interest for me, so I never played it.

2599
02:45:26,520 --> 02:45:27,520
Let's see.

2600
02:45:27,520 --> 02:45:28,520
Uh, come on, no Gus.

2601
02:45:28,520 --> 02:45:31,240
This isn't a question, but it says, yes, we need a musical episode.

2602
02:45:31,240 --> 02:45:40,800
Um, no, uh, you had one several hundred episodes, episode 69 with the karaoke revolution live

2603
02:45:40,800 --> 02:45:41,800
on air, but dark soccer.

2604
02:45:41,800 --> 02:45:43,080
I had the night off that night.

2605
02:45:43,080 --> 02:45:44,080
She wasn't here.

2606
02:45:44,080 --> 02:45:45,080
Believe it or not.

2607
02:45:45,080 --> 02:45:46,080
I'll sing suddenly Seymour.

2608
02:45:46,080 --> 02:45:47,080
All right.

2609
02:45:47,080 --> 02:45:48,080
I like that song.

2610
02:45:48,080 --> 02:45:49,080
We can do edit.

2611
02:45:49,080 --> 02:45:50,080
No, no.

2612
02:45:50,080 --> 02:45:53,960
I was what my feelings are hurt.

2613
02:45:53,960 --> 02:45:55,880
The bitches shot me down.

2614
02:45:55,880 --> 02:45:56,880
Let's do that right now.

2615
02:45:56,880 --> 02:45:57,880
No, no, no.

2616
02:45:58,240 --> 02:45:59,240
We're not going to do it.

2617
02:45:59,240 --> 02:46:00,240
No, no, we will not be no.

2618
02:46:00,240 --> 02:46:01,240
No.

2619
02:46:01,240 --> 02:46:04,200
I was actually trying to make a point about it is I was watching little shop before us.

2620
02:46:04,200 --> 02:46:09,440
Um, during the day of the eclipse, cause I could not get the songs out of my head.

2621
02:46:09,440 --> 02:46:14,960
And then I went up looking like all these videos of Ellen green.

2622
02:46:14,960 --> 02:46:17,120
Suddenly see more.

2623
02:46:17,120 --> 02:46:20,440
Anyway, uh, where else are we?

2624
02:46:20,440 --> 02:46:23,600
Uh, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, uh, Oh, S.J.

2625
02:46:23,600 --> 02:46:28,840
Matt, what is the most expensive thing gaming related you've purchased that you've regretted?

2626
02:46:28,840 --> 02:46:29,960
My PlayStation four pro

2627
02:46:32,960 --> 02:46:41,640
Logie building my, the first, uh, main cabinet because it costs several thousand dollars

2628
02:46:41,640 --> 02:46:43,320
and it was kind of a waste of money for that.

2629
02:46:43,320 --> 02:46:48,280
I could have, there was a lot of cheaper alternatives for that dark soccer.

2630
02:46:48,280 --> 02:46:49,660
I can't really think of anything.

2631
02:46:49,660 --> 02:46:50,660
Maybe the engage.

2632
02:46:50,660 --> 02:46:51,660
Okay.

2633
02:46:51,660 --> 02:46:52,660
Good answer.

2634
02:46:52,700 --> 02:46:53,700
I'm curious.

2635
02:46:53,700 --> 02:46:54,700
Wait a minute.

2636
02:46:54,700 --> 02:46:56,700
I thought you didn't pay for it.

2637
02:46:56,700 --> 02:46:57,700
Okay.

2638
02:46:57,700 --> 02:47:04,780
Um, um, um, um, um, I don't really regret anything.

2639
02:47:04,780 --> 02:47:06,260
I regret nothing.

2640
02:47:06,260 --> 02:47:08,180
No, seriously.

2641
02:47:08,180 --> 02:47:11,220
It's like, I don't, we don't really have much shit in the collection.

2642
02:47:11,220 --> 02:47:12,220
Oh yeah.

2643
02:47:12,220 --> 02:47:20,060
I, I re I regret ever renting the WWF thunder or whatever WCW thunder, whatever thunder

2644
02:47:20,100 --> 02:47:21,100
was.

2645
02:47:21,100 --> 02:47:24,860
And it was so bad that blockbuster let us take it back and rent something different.

2646
02:47:24,860 --> 02:47:30,900
Uh, dungeon buster says scariest time playing a Niantic game, Pokemon go, et cetera.

2647
02:47:30,900 --> 02:47:31,900
Outside.

2648
02:47:31,900 --> 02:47:36,260
Um, I got pulled over by the police playing Ingress, um, and it was because I didn't do

2649
02:47:36,260 --> 02:47:40,820
anything wrong, but I drove through a neighborhood because I was trying to get to where a baseball

2650
02:47:40,820 --> 02:47:41,820
diamond was.

2651
02:47:41,820 --> 02:47:46,820
And as I drove through the neighborhood, there were all these cop cars up and down the street.

2652
02:47:46,820 --> 02:47:49,260
And as I was driving down the street, I was like, you know what?

2653
02:47:49,260 --> 02:47:50,820
I don't need the portal that badly.

2654
02:47:50,820 --> 02:47:52,000
I'm going to just keep on going.

2655
02:47:52,000 --> 02:47:55,260
I wasn't looking at my phone or anything cause I knew exactly where this portal was, where

2656
02:47:55,260 --> 02:47:58,260
I go to park so I can get to the portal and all that stuff.

2657
02:47:58,260 --> 02:48:02,400
So, um, I was driving down the street and all these cop cars were there and I just noped

2658
02:48:02,400 --> 02:48:03,400
the fuck out.

2659
02:48:03,400 --> 02:48:07,540
Well, sure enough, one of them cop cars pulls right out, follows me, pulls me over and is

2660
02:48:07,540 --> 02:48:09,820
like, uh, what were you doing driving through there?

2661
02:48:09,820 --> 02:48:13,300
Because my, at the time I just bought that car that I have now, cause it was about a

2662
02:48:13,300 --> 02:48:14,300
year ago.

2663
02:48:14,300 --> 02:48:16,520
So my plates were temporary plates.

2664
02:48:16,520 --> 02:48:18,260
So like I just had all the signs.

2665
02:48:18,260 --> 02:48:22,780
So apparently they were looking for somebody and when a unmarked car came through the neighborhood

2666
02:48:22,780 --> 02:48:26,180
looking suspicious that noped the fuck out of there, they wanted to ask.

2667
02:48:26,180 --> 02:48:30,060
So I had to actually explain Ingress, but thank God, I had thought, never thought I'd

2668
02:48:30,060 --> 02:48:33,740
say this, but thank God Pokemon Go was a thing because I said to the officer, I said, okay,

2669
02:48:33,740 --> 02:48:34,940
you know, Pokemon Go.

2670
02:48:34,940 --> 02:48:35,940
He said, yeah.

2671
02:48:35,940 --> 02:48:38,040
I said, this is a very similar game.

2672
02:48:38,040 --> 02:48:41,540
That baseball diamond over there that you guys are in front of is where I was trying

2673
02:48:41,540 --> 02:48:42,540
to go.

2674
02:48:42,540 --> 02:48:44,100
And he said, show me the game.

2675
02:48:44,100 --> 02:48:46,620
And so I showed him the game and I showed him the baseball diamond and you know, he

2676
02:48:46,620 --> 02:48:51,820
was kind of like, you know, he nerd, well, I think he was just more like, I don't know

2677
02:48:51,820 --> 02:48:55,020
if he believed me at first because I still have the, I still had, it was so new.

2678
02:48:55,020 --> 02:48:57,140
I had the paper registration and all that shit.

2679
02:48:57,140 --> 02:48:58,140
Right.

2680
02:48:58,140 --> 02:49:01,740
So, you know, he, but it took, it took a good 15 minutes, but he ran it and then he was

2681
02:49:01,740 --> 02:49:03,860
like, all right, you didn't do anything wrong.

2682
02:49:03,860 --> 02:49:07,380
So I was like, I know I didn't do anything wrong, so I won't be going over there.

2683
02:49:07,380 --> 02:49:08,380
That pissed me off.

2684
02:49:08,380 --> 02:49:09,380
I could have thrown a field.

2685
02:49:09,380 --> 02:49:12,140
It would have been like 700 MU and I couldn't do it.

2686
02:49:12,140 --> 02:49:14,620
Fucking resistance put those fucking police people out there.

2687
02:49:14,620 --> 02:49:15,620
All right.

2688
02:49:15,620 --> 02:49:16,620
All right.

2689
02:49:16,620 --> 02:49:20,340
Um, let's see, lastly, let's say, uh, Oh yeah.

2690
02:49:20,340 --> 02:49:21,540
And that's still not a map points out.

2691
02:49:21,540 --> 02:49:22,540
I didn't answer the question.

2692
02:49:22,540 --> 02:49:23,540
Oh, I'm sorry.

2693
02:49:23,540 --> 02:49:24,540
Yes.

2694
02:49:24,540 --> 02:49:29,820
I didn't realize you had a scary Pokemon go moment riding with you.

2695
02:49:29,820 --> 02:49:30,820
Would you like to share something too?

2696
02:49:30,820 --> 02:49:31,820
Loki?

2697
02:49:31,820 --> 02:49:34,940
I don't think I've ever had a scary moment.

2698
02:49:34,940 --> 02:49:35,940
I've had a moment.

2699
02:49:35,940 --> 02:49:36,940
I was pissed off.

2700
02:49:36,940 --> 02:49:37,940
Uh, let's see.

2701
02:49:37,940 --> 02:49:42,460
A student her mat says, Rob did play ingress and single digit temperatures during magfest.

2702
02:49:42,460 --> 02:49:43,460
That is, that is true.

2703
02:49:43,460 --> 02:49:44,460
All right.

2704
02:49:44,460 --> 02:49:45,460
One more.

2705
02:49:46,300 --> 02:49:47,300
This is a good one for message.

2706
02:49:47,300 --> 02:49:50,640
You and her mat who says, uh, we need some O L R or vog t-shirts.

2707
02:49:50,640 --> 02:49:52,300
Can we make those happen someday?

2708
02:49:52,300 --> 02:49:56,100
Shout out to any listeners that are able to design t-shirts that would want to help out

2709
02:49:56,100 --> 02:49:57,100
on this.

2710
02:49:57,100 --> 02:49:58,100
You know what I've done?

2711
02:49:58,100 --> 02:50:00,380
I've designed vog shirts.

2712
02:50:00,380 --> 02:50:02,340
I designed the logo that went on the shirt.

2713
02:50:02,340 --> 02:50:03,340
Those.

2714
02:50:03,340 --> 02:50:04,340
Okay.

2715
02:50:04,340 --> 02:50:07,100
Those shirts were those little polo shirts that we kind of did for hosts.

2716
02:50:07,100 --> 02:50:08,980
I could design a shirt, no problem.

2717
02:50:08,980 --> 02:50:12,700
Let's let's look at like a generic shirt that we could wear, but I wouldn't want to do something

2718
02:50:12,700 --> 02:50:13,700
more than just the logo.

2719
02:50:13,700 --> 02:50:14,700
You know what I mean?

2720
02:50:15,460 --> 02:50:22,380
Something about orange challenge radio and on the back, it'll say, eat my entire ass.

2721
02:50:22,380 --> 02:50:24,300
I don't think that sells the show very well.

2722
02:50:24,300 --> 02:50:25,300
I don't know.

2723
02:50:25,300 --> 02:50:26,300
Obviously.

2724
02:50:26,300 --> 02:50:28,220
So Lorraine standards for 15 plus years.

2725
02:50:28,220 --> 02:50:29,220
Yeah.

2726
02:50:29,220 --> 02:50:30,220
Okay.

2727
02:50:30,220 --> 02:50:32,640
If you guys are talking to orange lounge radio shirts, then yes, we can do gutter humor.

2728
02:50:32,640 --> 02:50:33,640
That's fine.

2729
02:50:33,640 --> 02:50:39,340
If we do vog shirts, I have like an ocean of piss or piss into an ocean of piss that

2730
02:50:39,340 --> 02:50:42,060
iTunes reviewing is still up somewhere.

2731
02:50:42,060 --> 02:50:43,620
Oh, that's what we should do.

2732
02:50:43,620 --> 02:50:44,620
We should take.

2733
02:50:44,620 --> 02:50:45,620
Okay.

2734
02:50:45,620 --> 02:50:46,620
We'll take orange.

2735
02:50:46,620 --> 02:50:48,020
So this is the OLR shirt, not the vulture.

2736
02:50:48,020 --> 02:50:51,720
We'll take OLR and we'll take some of our greatest reviews from iTunes.

2737
02:50:51,720 --> 02:50:54,020
It's like pissing in an ocean of piss was one of them.

2738
02:50:54,020 --> 02:50:59,660
Uh, I just take like all our one star reviews and just put them on a shirt, but that, yeah,

2739
02:50:59,660 --> 02:51:03,340
I don't want to glamorize people doing one star reviews because then we're going to get

2740
02:51:03,340 --> 02:51:04,500
more of them.

2741
02:51:04,500 --> 02:51:08,580
So only five star reviews that were funny.

2742
02:51:08,580 --> 02:51:14,020
I'm just going to do like the OLR world tour and it's going to be like here in Atlanta.

2743
02:51:14,020 --> 02:51:15,020
That's it.

2744
02:51:15,020 --> 02:51:16,020
All right.

2745
02:51:16,020 --> 02:51:18,720
It'll be like the places we've actually been to her for the show.

2746
02:51:18,720 --> 02:51:22,520
So we need to find, first off, we need to agree on an appropriate storefront cause Bobby

2747
02:51:22,520 --> 02:51:25,960
is raising a point that he had a couple storefront ideas, but we kind of shot those down.

2748
02:51:25,960 --> 02:51:29,340
So we need to figure out who's going to do it and kind of go from there.

2749
02:51:29,340 --> 02:51:32,700
So we will, if the demand is there, we will work on it.

2750
02:51:32,700 --> 02:51:37,560
I've heard there are some new t-shirt places that are like Kickstarter to Seattle where

2751
02:51:37,560 --> 02:51:42,260
they don't print the shirt until like all the orders are in and then they do it.

2752
02:51:42,260 --> 02:51:43,260
And I kind of like that model.

2753
02:51:43,500 --> 02:51:44,500
Does that make sense?

2754
02:51:44,500 --> 02:51:45,500
Yeah.

2755
02:51:45,500 --> 02:51:46,500
Yeah.

2756
02:51:46,500 --> 02:51:47,500
I like that idea.

2757
02:51:47,500 --> 02:51:49,540
And then I think you get a better quality shirt than you do something like cafe press

2758
02:51:49,540 --> 02:51:50,540
or something.

2759
02:51:50,540 --> 02:51:51,540
Yeah.

2760
02:51:51,540 --> 02:51:52,540
There's a lot more places.

2761
02:51:52,540 --> 02:51:53,540
No one's going to use cafe press anymore.

2762
02:51:53,540 --> 02:51:54,540
Exactly.

2763
02:51:54,540 --> 02:51:55,540
There's more options.

2764
02:51:55,540 --> 02:51:57,700
So I would, I would look into one of those types of sites or something.

2765
02:51:57,700 --> 02:52:03,540
So um, I, we hear you and yes, we'll try to make something happen either on an OLR or

2766
02:52:03,540 --> 02:52:04,920
a VOG level.

2767
02:52:04,920 --> 02:52:11,220
If only I had a chance to meet with Bobby Black Wolf this week and you guys in our chat.

2768
02:52:11,220 --> 02:52:15,660
Oh, and Akuma JP actually links me to Uniqlo.

2769
02:52:15,660 --> 02:52:16,660
There was, I don't know what this is.

2770
02:52:16,660 --> 02:52:19,940
I guess I'll bring this up, but I got to say there's some Uniqlo shops here in the U S

2771
02:52:19,940 --> 02:52:23,460
and I've just been introduced to that chain cause we went to one in Chicago and actually

2772
02:52:23,460 --> 02:52:25,180
bought one of their Nintendo shirts.

2773
02:52:25,180 --> 02:52:26,180
That was awesome.

2774
02:52:26,180 --> 02:52:27,700
It has like a big Mario sprite in the corner.

2775
02:52:27,700 --> 02:52:28,700
Okay.

2776
02:52:28,700 --> 02:52:29,700
Yeah.

2777
02:52:29,700 --> 02:52:30,980
This is like the peanut sprites and stuff.

2778
02:52:30,980 --> 02:52:32,420
So there's, there's still some stuff in here.

2779
02:52:32,420 --> 02:52:33,420
It's really cute.

2780
02:52:33,420 --> 02:52:36,820
So, um, yeah, there's some really cute pics, uh, really cute shirts in here.

2781
02:52:36,820 --> 02:52:38,260
So yeah, I'm familiar with Uniqlo.

2782
02:52:38,260 --> 02:52:39,260
It's a fun store.

2783
02:52:39,260 --> 02:52:40,940
So, all right.

2784
02:52:40,940 --> 02:52:41,940
We need to wrap up though.

2785
02:52:41,940 --> 02:52:42,940
We need to get out.

2786
02:52:42,940 --> 02:52:46,820
It's after nine o'clock and, uh, people have other things they want to do and, uh, so forth.

2787
02:52:46,820 --> 02:52:48,500
So, uh, we're going to wrap up first.

2788
02:52:48,500 --> 02:52:50,980
I'm going to say, thanks for listening to the questions.

2789
02:52:50,980 --> 02:52:54,660
Uh, thanks for listening to Orange Launch Radio tonight and thanks for participating.

2790
02:52:54,660 --> 02:52:57,340
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, please tell a friend or five

2791
02:52:57,340 --> 02:52:58,380
about the show.

2792
02:52:58,380 --> 02:53:01,860
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but only

2793
02:53:01,860 --> 02:53:04,220
if the voices are here for us to use them.

2794
02:53:04,220 --> 02:53:06,100
So, uh, please help us spread the word.

2795
02:53:06,100 --> 02:53:08,180
A five star review on a nice site.

2796
02:53:08,180 --> 02:53:09,180
Ursula for your voice.

2797
02:53:09,180 --> 02:53:10,180
That's right.

2798
02:53:10,180 --> 02:53:14,020
A nice five star review on a place like iTunes or a similar site wherever you found this

2799
02:53:14,020 --> 02:53:15,020
show.

2800
02:53:15,020 --> 02:53:16,300
Believe me, those go a long way.

2801
02:53:16,300 --> 02:53:20,900
I think I've seen in the last year, one new review show up on iTunes.

2802
02:53:20,900 --> 02:53:23,380
So could you help me out?

2803
02:53:23,380 --> 02:53:24,380
Really appreciate it.

2804
02:53:24,380 --> 02:53:27,660
Of course, many of you already did it years ago and I still appreciate that.

2805
02:53:27,660 --> 02:53:29,620
Anyway, uh, other final thoughts.

2806
02:53:29,620 --> 02:53:30,620
Let's get to it.

2807
02:53:30,620 --> 02:53:32,020
Uh, Loki, your final thought tonight.

2808
02:53:32,020 --> 02:53:35,520
I have to go home and watch Game of Thrones because my wife has no impulse control and

2809
02:53:35,520 --> 02:53:39,000
she's on the internet and she's going to spoil it for herself.

2810
02:53:39,000 --> 02:53:43,700
Um, I am going to watch Twin Peaks while I get ready to do some packing and so forth

2811
02:53:43,700 --> 02:53:47,560
for Dragon Con cause I leave early on Wednesday.

2812
02:53:47,560 --> 02:53:48,960
This year I have an early flight.

2813
02:53:48,960 --> 02:53:52,880
Usually I get in late at night, but this year I'm getting in like Wednesday afternoon.

2814
02:53:52,880 --> 02:53:58,140
So please don't rain out Dragon Con cause I do want to try to do some Pokemon Go and

2815
02:53:58,140 --> 02:53:59,140
stuff outdoors.

2816
02:53:59,140 --> 02:54:00,640
So please don't rain out my Dragon Con.

2817
02:54:00,640 --> 02:54:02,640
Uh, Dark Soccer, your final thought.

2818
02:54:02,640 --> 02:54:04,480
I fucking called that shit.

2819
02:54:05,240 --> 02:54:06,240
All right, that's going to do it.

2820
02:54:06,240 --> 02:54:07,240
We just-

2821
02:54:07,240 --> 02:54:08,240
Rob?

2822
02:54:08,240 --> 02:54:09,240
What?

2823
02:54:09,240 --> 02:54:10,240
Tell Cersei it was me.

2824
02:54:10,240 --> 02:54:11,240
Sure.

2825
02:54:11,240 --> 02:54:12,760
Uh, we'll do it all again in 14 days.

2826
02:54:12,760 --> 02:54:14,440
Have a great Labor Day weekend.

2827
02:54:14,440 --> 02:54:16,440
Relax, have fun, game.

2828
02:54:16,440 --> 02:54:21,880
Uh, I'm sure there's many conventions and not just, not just, uh, Dragon Con, but PAX.

2829
02:54:21,880 --> 02:54:25,000
Uh, we have stuff here locally as well and I'm sure in your neighborhood as well.

2830
02:54:25,000 --> 02:54:29,000
