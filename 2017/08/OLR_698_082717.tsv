7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	21000	Secret of Romano was my childhood gateway drug into action-adventure games, and I'm thrilled to say that it's being remade for PS4, Vita, and Steam to be released in February.
21000	27000	This is the first fourth wall-breaking intro, stay tuned for tonight's news starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	38000	Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice, it is Orange Lounge Radio.
38000	45000	Live tonight, August the 27th, 2017 with episode number 698 of our show.
45000	51000	My name is Rob Roberts, here with my co-host to talk about video games over there at DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
51000	52000	I'm dying.
52000	54000	Do you need CPR?
54000	55000	Hot!
56000	58000	Oh, it's the food you're eating, isn't it?
58000	68000	I normally don't eat spicy food because I'm allergic to peppers and chilis, but I've had Benadryl like all morning, and so I said, oh, I'll be fine.
68000	70000	Hot!
70000	72000	My mouth feels like outside.
72000	77000	It's one of those things where it's like, I'm lactose intolerant, but once in a while I just want to have some ice cream.
77000	78000	Oh, it was delicious though.
78000	80000	But that's why they make pills, right?
80000	86000	It's like death in my mouth, and now I need to drink, like, milk. Lots of milk.
86000	93000	If this show was titled with quotes from the show like we used to do with Hoard House, I would call this episode Death in My Mouth, which seemed inappropriate.
93000	95000	Death in My Mouth.
95000	101000	Oh my gosh, you guys, the show tonight has been a hot mess, and it hasn't even started, like it's been a minute.
101000	102000	This show is my mouth.
102000	103000	No, look.
103000	104000	The hot mess.
104000	105000	Here's the deal.
105000	109000	I know some of you guys like to give me a show. I need to introduce Techmaster Loki, because I know he's going to razz me about this.
109000	110000	Hi, Loki. How are you?
110000	111000	Hi.
111000	112000	Are you enjoying that burger?
112000	118000	No, see, here's the thing. This is more of like one of those settling meals.
118000	125000	Like, I didn't really want it, but I was, like, I couldn't decide on what I wanted, and I was like, eh, fine.
125000	127000	This is the blind bait meal.
127000	132000	It's just like, I don't really want a bacon ultimate cheeseburger, but fine.
132000	134000	Yeah, it's like I have to eat something.
134000	140000	I need something. Like, I was like, McDonald's is going to be shit. I don't want to eat tacos because I'm eating tacos every single day.
140000	142000	What's one more day of tacos?
142000	150000	I mean, it's good. I'm going to eat tacos tomorrow, but like, I'm not going to, I don't want, I didn't want to get more tacos today.
150000	154000	I was like, cause I'm kind of taco'd out right now. So I was like, okay, I'll get a hamburger.
154000	160000	Haven't eaten it yet. I'm sure it's mediocre, but yeah, I'm just kind of like, eh.
160000	169000	So here's the thing, is that the studio may be on its, Studio N7 here that we're based in in lovely Sacramento, California, it may be on its last legs.
169000	180000	And I don't mean that in a panic way, but I mean that in a, you guys have given me shit over the years, and rightfully so probably, because I'm continuing to use Windows XP to run this show.
180000	195000	And you guys are probably like, Rob, seriously. But I'm like, guys, seriously, and gals, seriously, like if something isn't broken, and you're doing this live show that you've done for over 15 years, if something isn't broken, I don't like to go out of my way to fix it.
195000	197000	Well, unfortunately now it might be broken.
197000	200000	Of course, you can always expect Microsoft to break something for you.
200000	212000	Well, here's the thing, like Skype has just decided it doesn't want to work anymore. I tried to use the web online Skype, nah, you got to have Windows 7 in order to use that, even though it says right there on the site, it'll work on XP.
212000	220000	Well, at least the client is supposed to work on XP, but I keep getting this whole error, I can't connect. So unfortunately, we can't have a Skype line tonight, which I'm really sad about, because I love talking to you guys.
220000	225000	But we can do our toss call with Bobby Black Wolf that we do right at the end of his show, because he usually has this on at the end of his show.
225000	235000	Then I try to start tonight's show, and Winamp is just like, crash, I'm like, okay, and then what happens when I bring back up Winamp, my default playlist is gone.
235000	254000	Because, you know, when we do this live show, there's a certain setup to it, you know, we have like a little song to bring us into the show, and then there's, you know, Jason's little intro, you know, you're listening to Vogue Network, and then, you know, the little vocal cues, the intro you hear, all that stuff before the show comes up, it's all in a Winamp playlist, because this whole thing is on Shoutcast, which runs through Vogue Network.
254000	264000	And it's like, oh my god, then Winamp wouldn't work. And I'm just like, is this it? Is my computer dying? Is this on its last legs? I don't know what to think. So, ugh.
264000	273000	Yeah, I have to think about how I'm gonna fix that. Now, of course, we do have a live chat room every week. We do invite our live chatters to participate, live.voguenetwork.com.
273000	282000	And Ron must suggest, use your gaming PC for Skype. Wouldn't work, because my gaming PC is way in the other room, and so they're not like next to each other, and I can't really like run that over.
282000	296000	Now, the other backup plan he's just here, use your iPad if you have the right cable. I have done that before. There was a period of time where we were using the iPad, and I don't remember, I think it was another Windows XP issue or something, I was able to use the iPad to do it.
296000	306000	But, since I wasn't prepared for that, I don't have my cables, and I'm not gonna be able to get it while we're trying to do the show here, so unfortunately, we're just not gonna have Skype tonight, and I'll just have some time to figure this out.
306000	321000	If it's time up, it's time to finally upgrade this crap. Let's do it. And I kind of want to go to a laptop, because that would make the show very portable, which I think would be a great thing. We could do more event shows, like at places, you know, because we're making friends in the area and so forth.
321000	345000	But I'm worried about, like, you know, I have very specific 1990s needs in my PC, and these modern, these newfangled laptops you kids are into may not play it, and I've got to, so yeah, I just, I'm having a crisis, everybody. It's that kind of night tonight, so I hope you all will bear with me, so we'll figure it out.
346000	363000	Anyway, good suggestions in chat here. Stoppy says, OLR brought to you by Netscape. Dude, Google Chrome won't even update on this computer anymore. It's like, I've abandoned you, so I just, I don't know what to do.
363000	376000	So yeah, so I'm going to have to figure this out, so at least I have a little time to do it, sort of, although I'm going to be going out of town on Wednesday, because I'm going to Dragon Con, and I hope to see you guys there at Dragon Con.
376000	388000	We'll talk a little more about that in a little bit, but I suppose since this is a gaming podcast, we should get into some gaming news. So let's start tonight by talking about the Super Nintendo Classic.
388000	409000	Now, speaking of hot messes, that's true, I can feel a lot better about my own personal situation by just thinking, at least I'm not Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, or one of these retailers that offered the Super Nintendo Classic for pre-order on Monday, and I'm not sure there's a lot I need to say about that.
409000	419000	I'm pretty sure many of you who are listening to this show probably tried to pre-order one at some point, and I would imagine 98% of you were unsuccessful.
419000	430000	Now, here's a disclaimer. I'm not saying this to rub this in, because I seriously think I'm going to get screwed one way or another, but I actually got to pre-order one.
430000	439000	Well, here's the thing. They went up at like 1030 at night on Monday at BestBuy.com. That's 1030 West Coast. I might have even been 11.
439000	456000	And that's 1030 or 11 West Coast time. Now, luckily, I'm a bit of an insomniac, so I was up anyway, and so I'm on Twitter, and I see the tweets come in that, oh, the Super Nintendo Classic is up for pre-order, and I'm like, I'm going through these motions, I'm not going to be able to get one, duh duh duh, and well, I'll be damned, I got one.
456000	465000	I got one on BestBuy.com, and I even got the email confirming it, I got a tracking number and all that good stuff, but then I have that little voice in the back of my head this whole time.
465000	472000	So did those people at Walmart.com that pre-ordered a couple months ago, asshole, so nothing is for certain in this world.
472000	487000	So, theoretically, I have somehow managed to win this stupid, unnecessary game and actually pre-order a Super Nintendo Classic for now, but we'll see if that actually holds.
487000	498000	I signed up for all the notifications for that stuff, so I got the notification on my phone, I even opened the page, but then I got to the page to order it, and I was like, I'm not fucking doing this.
498000	509000	I'm just not. I'm like, you know what, I'm not fucking giving them the satisfaction of it, so fuck them, I'm not ordering that system.
509000	515000	I'm tired of this bullshit. If it's readily available at the store, I may pick one up.
515000	518000	So one way of phrasing it could be, you have had it officially.
518000	529000	I've had it, I'm done. It's not worth it. And honestly, watching the game, Star Fox 2 sounds pretty amazing, I watch the gameplay and I'm like, ehhhh.
529000	535000	Well, the official ROM will dump immediately, so I'm not worried about that.
535000	542000	There's also been some side buys with the proto, and they have changed a significant amount, especially in regards to localization, it seems.
542000	547000	So I mean, it's cool, but I, you know...
547000	549000	No, I get it, I get it.
549000	551000	I'm not giving them the satisfaction for this.
551000	558000	No, I get it, I totally get it, and I'm in this weird place because I'm like, well Rob, you should consider yourself lucky that you got one.
558000	561000	And then there's another part of me that's like, but do you really, though, have one?
561000	565000	This is the company that gives their systems to fucking GameStop.
565000	569000	ThinkGeek, you know, quote unquote, because they're the same fucking company.
569000	576000	And they're like, yeah, you can buy one of those systems if you buy $200 worth of bullshit with it.
576000	581000	Fuck them. Fuck them. Seriously.
581000	586000	They can produce those systems, they can produce those systems cheap, it's just a fucking Linux board in there.
587000	592000	You can't tell me, oh we can't manufacture this shit in China. Bull fucking shit.
592000	595000	So, whatever. I'm not buying it.
595000	602000	Well let me ask this question, because I feel like, you know, obviously, again, 98% of the internet is extraordinarily frustrated right now,
602000	606000	and that's probably a generous number that as high as 2% of the people that wanted one actually got to pre-order.
606000	610000	I'm probably being really fucking generous with that number, because I don't have any actual stats.
610000	617000	Here's my question is, to try to put a positive spin to it, Loki, and I know that's hard on these types of topics,
617000	626000	but realistically, important word, realistically, what can be done so this shit stops?
626000	628000	Any thoughts?
628000	634000	Produce enough systems. Don't just produce them for four months. Produce enough systems.
634000	638000	They do it for the fucking amiibos, they can do it for this.
638000	641000	They do it for other accessories that people don't buy much of.
641000	646000	Why can't this be produced? What is so difficult about this?
646000	652000	Nothing. So they need to not close it off this time like they did with the NES Classic.
652000	660000	What I still say, I still say, is because they fucking figured out how to put, how to backdoor a million other ROMs onto those things.
660000	662000	That is why they stopped production of those things.
662000	663000	They're gonna do that with this one too.
663000	665000	Exactly, it's gonna happen with this one too.
665000	669000	They can do with everything. There's nothing you can do to prevent that.
669000	674000	You know how, no, actually there is nothing you can do to prevent that.
674000	677000	I was gonna say, you know how you remove it? It's just take out the USB port.
677000	682000	Nope, there's really nothing you can do about it because if people want to fucking hack that shit, they're gonna hack it.
682000	688000	If you put them on the chip, then obviously someone can put them on the chip as well, or they can take them off the chip.
688000	691000	It's not impossible.
692000	700000	I think, okay, from my perspective, there's one very easy thing that should be done for this.
700000	703000	And that is that these retailers need to be using CAPTCHA.
703000	708000	Or they need to be using more, these retailers need to do more to prevent the bots.
708000	710000	They need to stop that.
710000	717000	And I think the only reason why, you know, for all practical purposes, Best Buy stayed up for a good 20 minutes.
717000	720000	I think that's better than most people were expecting when it comes to these preorders.
720000	724000	Yes, I realize it was the middle of the night, but look, the West Coast is a big place.
724000	730000	There were still a lot of people that were going, you know, L.A. and all the people, Seattle, Portland, all the people on the West Coast.
730000	735000	There's Insomniacs on the East Coast, too. There were plenty of people gunning for those systems.
735000	742000	And the bots got tricked out of that one because the URL had changed, right?
742000	750000	Which caused that whole bullshit where they didn't get the emails fired off for people that requested the emails when those go live.
750000	754000	And just the general bullshit of the fact that it went up in the middle of the night for most people.
754000	761000	Which, you know, while, yes, it worked in my favor, sure, I can acknowledge the bullshit factor that it should have been something where they said,
761000	765000	Wednesday at noon, it's happening and everybody's got a shot.
765000	768000	Like, I don't think it's one of those things they should have snuck out there in the middle of the night.
768000	771000	Like, I can acknowledge that. It was pretty bullshit in that regard.
771000	781000	But, like, why are bots allowed to order these things? We've got to do more about bots ordering this shit.
781000	787000	You gotta ask Nintendo, though, what's the point? Why even put out the system in the first place if you're not going to produce enough units?
787000	796000	Why even make it? Like, if you're so, like, dissatisfied at the fact that people hacked the NES Classic, why even double down and put out a Super NES Classic?
796000	802000	What the hell is the point if you're not going to produce enough units? Why are you even doing it to get Nintendo's name out there?
802000	804000	You already have your name out there with a bunch of other things.
804000	808000	All you're doing is causing frustration because people are trying to give you money for this shit.
808000	812000	You don't have the fucking Virtual Console anymore. It's not out.
812000	820000	And whatever this other system that you're putting in place, which we still don't know fuck anything about, is still not here.
820000	828000	Whenever the hell is that coming out, like, what the fuck are they doing? I mean, what's the point? Then don't manufacture that.
828000	833000	If they can't prevent the bots, then you know what? They need to go the route of Toys R Us.
833000	840000	And I'm actually going to applaud Toys R Us in this scenario. And the reason why I'm doing that is because Toys R Us just said, you know what? We're not taking pre-orders.
840000	849000	It's only going to be available in store the day it comes out. And you know what? At least I know with that particular method, there's not going to be fucking bots.
849000	858000	Will there be scalpers? Of course there will be. There's going to be crazy fucking people that get there early, early, early and are going to fuck it up in that capacity.
858000	864000	But if every retailer was doing it this way, then those scalpers can't be at every single possible location.
864000	869000	If they limit it to one person, then that end of it is only going to go so far.
869000	878000	So I kind of think in that regard, Toys R Us is doing what they can, which is, you know what? We're not going to be able to handle the pre-order thing, so we're just not going to do it for anybody.
878000	881000	And I think that's probably the best thing to do for them.
881000	890000	Now as far as the scalper thing goes, here's the other thing. And I know I've ranted about this on the show before, so I'm going to try to just keep this brief, but I can't say this enough.
890000	897000	You have to stop buying from scalpers. You don't need the system that bad.
897000	903000	If Nintendo wants you to have one, you'll be able to get one through official channels.
903000	911000	If the scalpers can't sell them, then they're not going to be shitting up the market with the bots and all this other stuff.
911000	914000	It's a Linux computer running an emulator.
914000	920000	They do this because, but it's still a collectible. Loki, that's in a way, I'm going to be real, that's an elitist defense.
920000	925000	It's the whole like, well if you knew more about computers, you could do this and do this, all this stuff.
925000	931000	Some people want the collectible. They still want it because it's an official Nintendo product, they want to go through the official channels.
931000	938000	I still stand with you in the fact that before I buy from a scalper, I would do that.
938000	947000	And I said that on a previous episode. I will steal the ROMs and put them on one of these little machines before I ever buy from a scalper.
947000	955000	And you know what? If Nintendo decides to cut it off again before you're able to get one through official channels, hey, go for it.
955000	959000	As much as I think piracy hurts things and all this stuff, go for it.
959000	965000	I support you in doing that. If Nintendo is going to say, nope, nope, no more, we're going to end it, then go for it.
965000	967000	That's kind of where my head is at with that.
967000	969000	But anyway, you've got to stop buying from scalpers.
969000	978000	And yes, I knew the whole argument about, well Rob, if I don't do it, someone's going to buy it and that whole thing, but you don't understand.
978000	987000	You need to also tell other people and you need to be like, if somebody tells you, oh yeah, I got one through a scalper, dude, that's not cool.
987000	991000	Like here I thought you were lucky, but you're just kind of, you're jerking the system.
991000	995000	In the end though, you can't tell people what to do. End of story.
995000	1000000	I can't, but I'm going to say this is a problem as long as that exists.
1000000	1005000	You are enabling. I can say you, you are free to do that, but you enabled this.
1005000	1012000	But that's not the other part of it too. The whole thing is that there is going to be somebody, there's a sucker born every minute.
1012000	1013000	Sure.
1014000	1023000	You'd have to instead make it to where the scalping itself is more difficult.
1023000	1028000	It's not necessarily the people that are doing it because people will go to extremes.
1028000	1032000	We, hello, why does intervention exist? Okay.
1032000	1039000	People will go to extremes. People will take advantage of people who will go to extremes.
1039000	1043000	It's like dealing with an addict, right?
1043000	1049000	You have to cut down the source of the addiction and then treat the problem.
1049000	1053000	You have to get somebody clean before you can treat their problem.
1053000	1057000	And so you'd have to instead target the scalpers.
1057000	1062000	And, you know, ostracize them, chase them out, send law enforcement after them.
1062000	1066000	If you see it happening, report it if you want something to be done about it.
1066000	1069000	Don't go attacking the people who are being taken advantage of.
1069000	1075000	I agree to an extent. There's kind of like a pyramid of responsibility here.
1075000	1079000	The person most at fault in this scenario is Nintendo, period.
1079000	1084000	Nintendo is creating this fucking problem. Nintendo needs to fucking fix it.
1084000	1088000	And journalists out there need to hold them fucking accountable for this and the NES Classic.
1088000	1091000	How about this? This also will help too.
1091000	1094000	All the media sites out there talking about how quickly this shit sells out
1094000	1099000	and running all these stupid articles about how the system's selling out
1099000	1102000	and Nintendo is being ridiculous for this stuff.
1102000	1106000	Just stop covering it. Stop giving them the fucking attention.
1106000	1109000	They create this circus so the circus is covered.
1109000	1111000	There's no money in that.
1111000	1113000	But people click on those stories, unfortunately.
1113000	1116000	So the pyramid of responsibility. Nintendo, number one.
1116000	1120000	The websites, number two. And they need to fix that and they need to prevent the bots and all that.
1120000	1125000	But ultimately, the people creating the demand have responsibility.
1125000	1126000	And I'm pointing that out.
1126000	1131000	But that's leading back to the revenue generated on those clickbait websites.
1131000	1132000	Agreed.
1132000	1137000	So that's also leading back to Nintendo seeing that this is a potential money maker by building hype.
1137000	1144000	It's more or less, in the long run, if you really want to point to the true blame and everything,
1144000	1150000	it's the fact that we are living in a fairly uncontrolled capitalist society.
1150000	1152000	It's capitalism. Pure and simple.
1152000	1155000	It goes back to the same philosophy.
1155000	1160000	You know, you create the demand and you do whatever you can to keep the demand going.
1160000	1167000	Which creates revenue, which lines pockets, which then goes back into the economy, blah blah blah.
1167000	1175000	I'm not going to go into the year and a half of economics I shoved in my brain.
1175000	1183000	But it really is more of a societal urge.
1183000	1188000	And I do agree with that, which is why when it came to the NES Classic, I said,
1188000	1192000	OK, I'm not able to get one through normal means. I don't need one that bad.
1192000	1195000	I'm not going to buy one. I'm not going to go through these other channels to do it.
1195000	1200000	And it's the same thing if, for whatever reason, the Super Nintendo thing falls through and I'm not able to get one through normal means.
1200000	1202000	I don't need one that bad.
1202000	1207000	And see, it's more or less a conditioning of society in general.
1207000	1210000	We are conditioned, well, look at the 80s, OK?
1210000	1213000	Let's just stop right there and look at the fucking 80s.
1213000	1217000	Everything, it was me, me, me, I need to have, I need to acquire.
1217000	1219000	Look at the movies that were out then.
1219000	1223000	You know, how materialism was really pushed.
1223000	1225000	And our society is built on a sense of materialism.
1225000	1228000	Our whole economy is built on materialism.
1228000	1233000	Acquire, acquire, gain this. If you have this and no one else does, you're special.
1233000	1240000	And to point blame and to say, how do we fix this?
1240000	1244000	The only fix is re-educating people.
1244000	1251000	And what I was trying to say with the whole putting the people who buy these things from scalpers responsible is I'm just trying to say,
1251000	1254000	oh, you got that from a scalper? You're not special.
1254000	1257000	And that's what I'm going to say.
1257000	1262000	And that's just, you know, what I'm choosing to do as a response is that that enables that whole thing.
1262000	1265000	So if you got it from a scalper, you're not special.
1265000	1269000	And just the thing that I think needs to be a bigger push in society.
1269000	1273000	And I hate to phrase it this way, but I think it's the first step.
1273000	1280000	The first thing that people need to understand in their hearts that will stop pretty much all of this from going on
1280000	1283000	is that the things that you own, own you.
1283000	1287000	Let me go to some comments from our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
1287000	1290000	SSG100Matt says, we're getting too deep here.
1290000	1292000	She right though.
1292000	1298000	Also, come on, Noel Gustin Chat says, if I'm lucky enough to find one at the retail price, then we'll probably buy it.
1298000	1303000	I refuse to even consider buying one of those crazy ass $300 ThinkGeek bundles.
1303000	1309000	Oh, my God. I mean, let's just put that on the list of reasons why I don't set foot in a GameStop anymore.
1309000	1314000	Because I don't need that soon to be on dollar store shelves merchandise.
1314000	1318000	See, here's why they do that with hardware.
1318000	1320000	Hardware, there is no margin.
1320000	1324000	It's like literally two bucks, you lose that in shipping.
1324000	1328000	So you're literally selling that either at cost or at a loss.
1328000	1330000	You make it up with software.
1330000	1334000	These systems though, I don't know if that same kind of margin exists.
1334000	1336000	I would think that it doesn't.
1336000	1341000	I would be willing to bet that the hardware that's in these new ones are probably the same as the old ones.
1341000	1346000	So the extra $20 that they've made up there, I mean, there's got to be some margin in there.
1346000	1352000	But, let's just say assuming that it's like that, that's why they throw this extra crap in there.
1352000	1357000	Then again, this is also GameStop, so they just do it because they're also greedy as fuck as well.
1357000	1361000	Because they know people will be tempted and people will buy it.
1362000	1365000	It's not really just them.
1365000	1368000	It's every company out there.
1368000	1369000	They know people want it.
1369000	1371000	They'll do what they can to make people want it.
1371000	1374000	And then they'll do whatever they take to get the money out of them.
1374000	1380000	That's not solely for one company versus others.
1380000	1383000	In the end, they all have the same goal, get your money.
1383000	1390000	We have to really encourage ourselves to fight that instinct of, I'll be a special snowflake if I have one.
1390000	1396000	And we have to fight that instinct and say, you know what, it's not worth buying this crap bundle from ThinkGeek to get one.
1396000	1401000	If I can find one at retail price on my terms, the consumer's terms, then cool.
1401000	1404000	But if I can't find that, then fuck it.
1404000	1407000	We just have someone who lets us know when they get them in.
1407000	1410000	So that's how we got our nest.
1410000	1417000	And on top of that, our legit reason for not really needing it, having the Star Fox 2 would be cool.
1417000	1426000	But our thought, the reason, the only reason that we wanted one is so that we could have the digital hookup without having the lag with our HDTV.
1426000	1427000	Yeah, HDMI, that whole thing.
1427000	1432000	So that was, that's really our sole reason for really wanting it at all.
1432000	1437000	But other than that, we've got a SNES and we have an EverDrive.
1437000	1442000	In the long run, SNES plus EverDrive equals all of this shit.
1442000	1446000	But think about how short sighted this shit is with these systems.
1446000	1458000	I mean, seriously, like they should just be releasing a virtual console system that can tap into the eShop to buy virtual console games or that can subscribe to that service and then push that shit out there like crazy.
1458000	1462000	Because that's what fucking Netflix and these other companies do.
1462000	1465000	Like they literally will pay for the system.
1465000	1475000	Like if you're signing up for example, like Sling or something like that, they will literally give you a credit for the device that plays that shit on your TV.
1475000	1477000	They make money on planned obsolescence.
1477000	1479000	So do what Microsoft's doing.
1479000	1482000	Because they have the Xbox game anywhere thing now.
1482000	1485000	That plays a lot of the 360 games for Xbox One, right?
1485000	1493000	Well, even more so because like this is more for like, you'll get as many systems out there because then you can get people paying you even more money.
1493000	1496000	If you're worried about that, you're not making enough of a margin off of these systems.
1496000	1503000	Like let's just say Nintendo, let's just throw it out there that Nintendo is not producing a lot of these because they're not making money off of them.
1503000	1505000	They're kind of coming at a loss or something like that.
1505000	1511000	Whatever. Which is still their stupid idea because they're producing them so who they have the blame for that themselves.
1511000	1519000	But it's another opportunity to get more money and at the same time people will be able to buy more games.
1519000	1520000	People want to put more ROMs on there.
1520000	1522000	Learn from your fucking users.
1522000	1524000	People bought them and they wanted more ROMs on there.
1524000	1528000	Okay, cool. Give them an opportunity to purchase more ROMs.
1528000	1530000	What is the problem?
1530000	1533000	But do it cheaply. Add like bundles and shit.
1533000	1536000	So that way it's more of an impulse buy.
1536000	1540000	It ended up like how it is with my PlayStation Network library, my Steam library.
1540000	1542000	Where it's like, oh hey that looks cool.
1542000	1546000	I buy it, I may not play it, but I don't even think about it.
1546000	1549000	I just like, oh that's a great deal, I'm gonna pick that up.
1549000	1552000	And it's just so easy for me to drop money on that stuff.
1552000	1553000	Make it that easy.
1553000	1558000	Instead of this fucking obstacle course of shit that you're making it for all these users.
1558000	1561000	Because eventually people are gonna get fucking tired of your shit.
1561000	1567000	Alright, well look, I don't want too much salt in the opening moments of Orange Lounge Radio here tonight.
1567000	1572000	But I think the reality is that a lot of people, again, most people couldn't get one this week.
1572000	1574000	I think there is a lot of saltiness out there right now.
1574000	1580000	So I think we've all been able to vent a little bit and I hope Nintendo can figure it the hell out.
1580000	1584000	But at the same time I hope the industry can kind of hold Nintendo accountable.
1584000	1591000	And I hope people in the journalism arena will ask Nintendo some of these hard questions about why do you keep doing this to your fans.
1591000	1594000	And they'll fucking dodge it like Reggie does every fucking time.
1594000	1597000	Everybody plays so fucking nice and plays into this.
1597000	1601000	And we need some people out there that will ask harder questions.
1601000	1603000	It's just ridiculous.
1603000	1605000	I'll be the asshole to ask questions.
1605000	1607000	But we all know what happens.
1607000	1609000	I know the chat comments are about to come in.
1609000	1611000	And this is why Reggie never comes on your show.
1611000	1613000	I understand. But I need other people.
1613000	1615000	Well, he also doesn't know we exist.
1615000	1617000	I need other people out there.
1617000	1619000	Somebody got two questions.
1619000	1621000	That was Rama. An event got two questions. Remember that?
1621000	1623000	We had an exclusive interview.
1623000	1625000	But anyway, all that joking aside.
1625000	1628000	People need to fucking hold Nintendo accountable.
1628000	1630000	Look, I get it. We all love Nintendo products.
1630000	1633000	They've created some of the most memorable characters over the years.
1633000	1635000	They create some damn addicting games.
1635000	1637000	I get it. But at the same time,
1637000	1641000	this hardware shortage shit has been going on since the 90s.
1642000	1644000	And they know it works.
1644000	1646000	They're exploiting your love. Seriously.
1646000	1648000	It's a tried and true tactic.
1648000	1652000	It's time for people to stand up and shut it down, for God's sake.
1652000	1654000	It's a fucking abusive relationship.
1654000	1657000	Rob, are we going to break the wheel?
1657000	1660000	Nintendo's on top. Then Sega's on top.
1661000	1664000	Anyway, well Sonic Mania is pretty good on the Switch, though.
1664000	1666000	Now where does that put us?
1666000	1668000	Alright, look. Anyway.
1669000	1672000	Well, Sonic Mania was made by Sonic fans anyway.
1672000	1674000	That is very true. Very true.
1674000	1678000	Anyway, we're going to go ahead and move on with the show
1678000	1680000	and get into our gaming weeks.
1680000	1682000	So what types of video games have you been playing this week?
1682000	1685000	Did you revisit a Super Nintendo classic this week?
1685000	1686000	Or has it been something else?
1686000	1687000	I did.
1687000	1689000	How about that? Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
1689000	1693000	I did. I played Super Mario World last night.
1694000	1696000	Because someone's like, well, you do the level.
1696000	1698000	And I'm like, okay, I'll do the level. Fuck.
1698000	1700000	And did the level. And guess what?
1700000	1701000	You did the thing.
1701000	1702000	I was fussing because I was like,
1702000	1705000	why didn't you go get the green Switch house or Switch block?
1705000	1707000	And they're like, oh, we haven't gotten there yet.
1707000	1708000	I was like, well, give it to me. I'll do it.
1708000	1709000	And I didn't do it.
1709000	1711000	But I did clean the level instead.
1711000	1714000	And then I tripped over the cable and unplugged the Super Nintendo.
1714000	1716000	And that was my Super Nintendo-ing.
1717000	1719000	What level was it? Now you got me curious.
1719000	1722000	It was like early on in the game.
1722000	1723000	We had just started.
1723000	1724000	Oh, okay.
1726000	1728000	And then I played all my iOS stuff.
1728000	1731000	So not really a whole bunch of anything.
1731000	1735000	I still have yet to reinstall my Mass Effect Andromeda
1735000	1737000	since it got fucked up.
1738000	1739000	Oh, yes.
1739000	1742000	And they have that patch now, the last patch,
1742000	1744000	Cody Fingers, that I suppose is worth visiting.
1744000	1746000	I need to sit down with that again on PlayStation 4
1746000	1748000	now that it's where it's at.
1748000	1750000	Because I kind of said, all right,
1750000	1752000	if they're going to keep making changes to this game,
1752000	1753000	I'm going to step away from it for a little while.
1753000	1755000	And I'll come back when all the patches are there.
1755000	1758000	Well, now that they're there, I really do owe the game
1758000	1760000	a complete playthrough.
1760000	1762000	I was near the end, but I just didn't finish it.
1762000	1764000	Well, although it was funny.
1764000	1766000	I was actually thinking about a YouTuber
1766000	1769000	yesterday at lunch who does,
1769000	1772000	in fact, trying to get him on the show,
1772000	1774000	Game Tim, who does cooking with Cookie Mama.
1774000	1775000	Yeah, I think we were talking to him,
1775000	1777000	but then our unexpected hiatus came up.
1777000	1779000	So we're going to work that out. Yeah.
1779000	1782000	I went to get Korean food yesterday,
1782000	1784000	and I'm going to mispronounce it,
1784000	1786000	but I think it's called Haemil Peijong,
1786000	1788000	which is like a seafood pancake.
1788000	1790000	And he did that on Cooking with Cookie Mama.
1790000	1793000	And I was like, oh, that makes me think about his channel.
1793000	1795000	And I was like, I'm a nerd.
1795000	1797000	Yes, you are. All right.
1797000	1799000	It was pretty fun.
1799000	1800000	All right.
1800000	1802000	That's really the extent of my gaming week.
1802000	1804000	Let's check in with Loki. How was your gaming week?
1804000	1807000	First off, I'd like to say dinner is fucking terrible,
1807000	1809000	and I threw it away.
1809000	1811000	I took one bite of that,
1811000	1814000	and you'll definitely be able to relate with this.
1814000	1816000	I took a bite of the hamburger.
1816000	1818000	All I could taste,
1818000	1820000	and I'm going to try not to make you sick here,
1820000	1822000	warm mayonnaise.
1822000	1825000	Yeah, exactly. I threw it fucking away.
1825000	1827000	Just, no. Yeah.
1827000	1830000	That's why I always... French fries were fucking stale,
1830000	1832000	and somehow this tastes like diet root beer,
1832000	1834000	which I don't think they have,
1834000	1836000	but it tastes like fucking watered-down shit.
1836000	1838000	Do you need juice or something from the fridge?
1838000	1840000	You know what, though?
1840000	1842000	At the very least, I got a vanilla milkshake from them,
1842000	1844000	and that was good.
1844000	1846000	All right, at least there's that.
1846000	1848000	So I'm going to have vanilla milkshake for dinner.
1848000	1850000	That'll be fucking dinner.
1850000	1852000	Anyways, so no actual games.
1852000	1854000	I did play an actual game this week.
1854000	1856000	I went back to my Steam library
1856000	1858000	because I had been watching the movie,
1858000	1860000	and I built the Legos and stuff,
1860000	1862000	so I went and played the Lego movie video game,
1862000	1864000	and actually found out that was pretty fun.
1864000	1866000	I mean, honestly, they're all about the same.
1866000	1869000	Tons of clips thrown in from the movie and stuff.
1869000	1871000	You know, lots of humor.
1871000	1873000	It's kind of funny.
1873000	1875000	I enjoyed it, so I played a little bit of that.
1875000	1880000	And then I actually didn't play a whole lot of other things.
1880000	1882000	I thought about putting on...
1882000	1884000	I was actually going to play some VR stuff this week,
1884000	1887000	but then my wife wanted to watch TV,
1887000	1889000	and so that kind of...
1889000	1891000	Well, now that I think of it, what the fuck?
1891000	1893000	I would have a VR headset,
1893000	1895000	but it doesn't really matter.
1895000	1897000	Oh, whatever. Hindsight.
1897000	1901000	So I ended up researching on how to set up a Raspberry Pi
1901000	1905000	for RetroPie, so I've been downloading everything for that
1905000	1907000	since I have a Raspberry Pi to do that.
1907000	1909000	Just haven't gotten around to it.
1909000	1911000	Although, I do need to fix my 3D printer
1911000	1913000	to print a shell for it
1913000	1916000	so that it has something to sit on for now.
1916000	1919000	I mean, because I probably need to put it in something
1919000	1921000	so it doesn't short itself out.
1922000	1924000	And then just, you know, selfling games.
1924000	1927000	And, you know, that's about it, pretty much.
1927000	1929000	Okay.
1929000	1931000	My gaming week.
1931000	1933000	So there is a new game I played this week.
1933000	1935000	Mostly been a lot of the same old, like, classics
1935000	1936000	that I play all the time,
1936000	1938000	but I did play one new game this week,
1938000	1940000	and in fact, it was the game that I played
1940000	1942000	after Orange Lounge Radio last week,
1942000	1944000	because usually on Sunday nights,
1944000	1946000	right after Orange Lounge Radio is finished,
1946000	1948000	I'll go on my Twitch channel and I'll play something.
1948000	1950000	We've done things like Splatoon and Mario Kart
1950000	1951000	that I play with viewers,
1951000	1952000	but last week I was like,
1952000	1954000	well, I want to do, I want to do, like, an indie game
1954000	1955000	and I've been hearing a lot about this game,
1955000	1957000	so let's do, like, a new game
1957000	1959000	and me play it for the first time.
1959000	1961000	So the game I did after the show last week
1961000	1964000	was a game called 20XX, or 20XX.
1964000	1965000	Oh yeah, that looks pretty good.
1965000	1967000	2000XX, I'm not sure how you...
1967000	1970000	20XX, it's just like in Mega Man 2?
1970000	1971000	Yeah, in the intro.
1971000	1972000	20XD6.
1972000	1974000	Yeah, yeah, basically, 20XDX.
1974000	1977000	Oh yeah, I think I'm going to call it that, 20XDX.
1977000	1979000	But anyway, that was the game I played,
1979000	1980000	and it's really cool.
1980000	1983000	Yeah, it's basically, it's a Mega Man-ish game
1983000	1985000	and there's a lot, like, even in the intro sequences.
1985000	1986000	Roguelite, I guess.
1986000	1987000	Wow, there's a lot.
1987000	1989000	Yeah, it's a Mega Man roguelike.
1989000	1993000	So instead of necessarily picking the different boss stages,
1993000	1995000	you kind of start in the first level
1995000	1996000	and you're going through,
1996000	1998000	and if you're able to survive all the way to the boss,
1998000	1999000	then you fight the boss,
1999000	2001000	and then you can pick, do you want the boss weapon
2001000	2004000	or do you want, you know, extra currency
2004000	2007000	or, like, extra energy pack or something?
2007000	2010000	And then you can pick one of three branching paths
2010000	2012000	and you will see who the boss is and what the stage is,
2012000	2014000	but then you kind of have to go from there.
2014000	2015000	And each level that you go,
2015000	2018000	the difficulty of the level starts to amp up a little bit.
2018000	2020000	But then once you die, you're dead
2020000	2022000	and you're back to the central hub,
2022000	2023000	where, like a lot of roguelikes,
2023000	2026000	if you've ever played things like Rogue Legacy,
2026000	2027000	Crypt of the Necrodancer, you know,
2027000	2029000	all these games have a very similar formula.
2029000	2031000	So once you die, you go back to the hub
2031000	2034000	where you can buy, like, sometimes temporary power-ups,
2034000	2035000	good for your next run,
2035000	2037000	permanent power-ups, which will help you
2037000	2039000	and give you an advantage the next time.
2039000	2041000	And then that's how, the next time you play,
2041000	2043000	you can hopefully go a little further in the game.
2043000	2045000	So, and there's even more to this game
2045000	2047000	that I didn't even really get a chance to explore.
2047000	2048000	Like, I know there's co-op in it,
2048000	2050000	didn't even really touch that.
2050000	2052000	There's challenge modes available in it
2052000	2053000	that I didn't really get a chance to touch,
2053000	2056000	just because I have been enjoying the single-player campaign
2056000	2059000	and I had a great time streaming that on Twitch last week
2059000	2061000	and it seemed like a lot of you really responded to that, too.
2061000	2063000	I think some of you told me you were gonna buy it.
2063000	2065000	So I was like, tell the developers.
2065000	2067000	Maybe they don't want to come on OLR.
2067000	2069000	Well, that's, you know, this is like
2069000	2071000	kind of what Mighty No. 9 should have been.
2071000	2073000	Yes, actually, yes.
2073000	2075000	And so a lot of people responding very positively to this game,
2075000	2078000	and I gotta say, you know, I mean, is it perfect?
2078000	2082000	I mean, no, because sometimes the randomness of the levels
2082000	2084000	does feel a little bit,
2084000	2088000	I feel like I'm doing some of the same-sy jumping patterns
2088000	2089000	and some of these things, like, over and over,
2089000	2091000	which, you know, in a regular Mega Man game,
2091000	2094000	you expect that, because Mega Man's all about fucking patterns.
2094000	2097000	But in a roguelike, you kind of hope there'd be a little more randomness.
2097000	2100000	But I'm really, I'm being very nitpicky with that statement.
2100000	2102000	I think, overall, I am enjoying it,
2102000	2106000	and overall, like, the, you know, just the discovery of the game
2106000	2108000	and going a little deeper every time and some of the boss fights
2108000	2110000	and how they can change and be different.
2110000	2112000	Like, I just, I was really enjoying it.
2112000	2114000	And here's the other thing.
2114000	2116000	The price is great. It was only 12 bucks.
2116000	2118000	Now, I think I bought it on some type of launch week sale
2118000	2120000	that's probably not there anymore,
2120000	2123000	but I think the quote-unquote real price is like $15.99.
2123000	2126000	Like, I don't think it's much more expensive than what I paid for it.
2126000	2128000	So I recommend it.
2128000	2132000	Like, if you like Mega Man and you like roguelikes, you know,
2132000	2134000	I know some people that are like,
2134000	2136000	I hate roguelikes, but I kind of feel like
2136000	2141000	you're dismissing a really broad genre by saying you hate roguelikes.
2141000	2142000	You know what I mean?
2142000	2144000	Like, is there one or two that you play that you didn't like
2144000	2146000	and you're kind of dismissing the genre?
2146000	2149000	Because I kind of think your love of Mega Man
2149000	2152000	will erase any reservations you have about roguelikes.
2152000	2153000	Does that make sense?
2153000	2154000	Yeah.
2154000	2157000	Like, the Mega Man aspect is much more than the rogue side of it.
2157000	2161000	So that's kind of my thoughts on it.
2161000	2165000	Looking in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com,
2165000	2167000	just trying to see, Stoppy says,
2167000	2170000	I've been playing 20XDX since Early Access.
2170000	2172000	It's great. They've come a long way.
2172000	2174000	The improvements were notable.
2174000	2176000	It's funny to think Mighty No. 9 backers
2176000	2178000	would have been happier with this tribute game.
2178000	2182000	Sjoan Hunter-Matt says Mighty No. 9 didn't have to be like 20XDX.
2182000	2184000	Mighty No. 9 is great on its own.
2184000	2187000	It's just the delay saga poisoned the game for everyone.
2187000	2189000	Give Mighty No. 9 a chance.
2189000	2193000	So, and actually, I still have, I got Mighty No. 9.
2193000	2194000	I don't know if it was in a humblebo-
2194000	2196000	No, I bought it on a Steam sale.
2196000	2197000	It was like five bucks during a Steam sale.
2197000	2199000	I just, I still haven't played it yet.
2199000	2201000	So, that's also on my list of things.
2201000	2204000	You know, because I value what some of our longtime listeners
2204000	2207000	like Sjoan Hunter-Matt, who's been listening for years and years, say.
2207000	2209000	And if he says, you know what, you really need to just like
2209000	2211000	don't listen to this hype and just give it a chance.
2211000	2212000	I'm willing to give it a chance.
2212000	2215000	And it's, it probably really isn't as bad as most people say,
2215000	2218000	but it's probably also not quite the Mega Man clone game
2218000	2219000	people were hoping for.
2219000	2222000	But maybe if you were disappointed in Mighty No. 9,
2222000	2225000	maybe there'll be something in 20XDX that will work for you.
2225000	2228000	You know? And maybe the reverse is even true.
2228000	2230000	If you really do hate roguelikes that much
2230000	2233000	and 20XDX doesn't work for you, maybe Mighty No. 9,
2233000	2235000	you should give a second chance, if that makes sense.
2235000	2239000	So, but anyway, overall, my opinion on 20XDX, very favorable,
2239000	2242000	especially because of the fact that it is such a low cost.
2242000	2245000	It does feel more homegrown and indie developed.
2245000	2248000	I think it's a very like fleshed out great game
2248000	2250000	and it's definitely worth a look if you're into that genre at all.
2250000	2256000	My only concern, I hope it's not too close to Mega Man
2256000	2259000	where Capcom's gonna rear their head.
2259000	2262000	I hope, instead, Capcom may see the message here
2262000	2264000	from the success of this game and go,
2264000	2267000	maybe we shouldn't have canceled Mega Man Universe
2267000	2269000	because maybe that's what that game was supposed to be.
2269000	2270000	I don't know.
2270000	2273000	But maybe we should revisit this franchise
2273000	2277000	because I bet if Capcom did an official Mega Man release,
2277000	2278000	and I mean new release,
2278000	2281000	I don't mean yet another legacy collection with some...
2281000	2283000	Just do like a Sonic Mania release.
2283000	2285000	Yeah. Seriously. Seriously.
2285000	2286000	Well, they've done that before.
2286000	2289000	Capcom should listen the fuck up to how people respond to Sonic Mania.
2289000	2293000	Didn't they have a free Mega Man Street Fighter game or something like that?
2293000	2294000	Yeah, but that wasn't even Capcom.
2294000	2296000	I think Capcom kind of blessed it.
2296000	2297000	I think they had to.
2297000	2299000	I think Capcom kind of said,
2299000	2303000	we're gonna just kind of turn around and not really pay attention to this.
2303000	2306000	No, I think they may have even endorsed it on their blog.
2306000	2307000	They did on their blog.
2307000	2309000	They did. So I guess they didn't acknowledge it.
2309000	2311000	But I think it was one of those very clear like,
2311000	2313000	this is a fan game, we're allowing it.
2313000	2317000	So maybe because of that, that sets a good precedent
2317000	2319000	that Capcom is not gonna try to shut this down.
2319000	2321000	And I hope they don't.
2321000	2324000	And I think there are enough differences where if it...
2324000	2326000	I mean the whole fact that it isn't...
2326000	2329000	It's not taking away from anything that they're doing.
2329000	2332000	If anything, it's making people more excited about their games.
2332000	2337000	The fact that it is a roguelike does change the basics of the game dramatically.
2337000	2340000	And I think that's enough to get it out of any hot water with Capcom.
2340000	2344000	I think the fact that it is a roguelike is going to kind of separate it enough.
2344000	2347000	Because like I said, the original Mega Man games
2347000	2350000	are all about memorizing those fucking patterns on how to get through the level.
2350000	2352000	You can't really do that with this game.
2352000	2355000	So I mean there are some of those fundamental differences there.
2355000	2357000	You know what would be awesome is like a Mega Man game
2357000	2362000	where you have like power-ups from other like Capcom characters.
2362000	2365000	Like you know the Bionic arm from Bionic Commando.
2365000	2367000	Well remember in that early Mega Man universe trailer
2367000	2369000	there was the whole like Ryu showed up.
2369000	2371000	Or Mega Man threw a fireball or something.
2371000	2373000	Yeah, but that's been there since like X.
2373000	2375000	So I mean, I don't know.
2375000	2376000	Yeah, who knows. Who knows.
2376000	2379000	So anyway, that was the new game I played this week and I enjoyed.
2379000	2381000	Otherwise it's just been kind of like old favorites.
2381000	2385000	Still been playing Overwatch, Final Fantasy XIV, Diablo III.
2385000	2387000	I randomly played Heroes of the Storm again.
2387000	2388000	I don't know. Oh, I know what it was.
2388000	2392000	I was watching my buddy Delvin who does another podcast called Video Game Realness.
2392000	2395000	They don't put out a ton of episodes. They put out one recently.
2395000	2397000	And he also does some video game streaming out there.
2397000	2399000	So I was watching his channel and he was playing League of Legends
2399000	2401000	and we were having a little bit of a chat about League of Legends.
2401000	2403000	I was kind of talking about some of my hesitations with that game.
2403000	2405000	But he was having fun with it.
2405000	2406000	And it did kind of make me go,
2406000	2408000	well maybe I should see what's going on in Heroes of the Storm.
2408000	2409000	It's been a little while.
2409000	2414000	And now that there's no like active play this game a lot to get a D.Va suit
2414000	2416000	or you know some of those things that Blizzard was doing
2416000	2418000	to get more people to play Heroes of the Storm.
2418000	2422000	I feel like I can just kind of go into an AI game and just play it and be satisfied.
2422000	2425000	And I'm doing those little quests to earn a little bit of gold.
2425000	2427000	And I'm perfectly content doing that.
2427000	2429000	And I don't feel pressure because it's not PvP.
2429000	2432000	And you know, yeah, I'm having fun.
2432000	2434000	So I'm not playing a lot of it.
2434000	2436000	But I'm playing just enough to kind of go,
2436000	2440000	oh yeah, this is a fun little different type of game to play to decompress a little bit.
2440000	2444000	And who knows, maybe in the coming weeks I will feel adventurous enough
2444000	2446000	that I'll go in and I'll try a PvP match again.
2446000	2450000	Just right now I'm a little bit hesitant on that with Heroes of the Storm.
2450000	2453000	But I wanted to see, they actually put D.Va in as a hero in Heroes of the Storm.
2453000	2455000	I think they put Genji in too.
2455000	2457000	They put some more Warcraft and Starcraft characters
2457000	2461000	because Starcraft got its remaster.
2461000	2464000	That whole thing came out so, you know, people are paying attention to that.
2464000	2469000	I'm super curious, you know, starting this week actually,
2469000	2472000	I don't think it's on our showroll so I think I'm okay to talk about this.
2472000	2477000	Starting this week, the Destiny 2, if you pre-, not even pre-ordered it people,
2477000	2481000	pre-purchased it, meaning you already gave them the full money,
2481000	2483000	you would be able to play the beta.
2483000	2489000	Well no, you get, I'm sorry, you get one day early access to the open beta.
2489000	2491000	So if you pre-purchase you get that one day
2491000	2493000	and then the open beta is like the 29th through the,
2493000	2497000	I can't do the open beta because I fly out of town early morning on Thursday,
2497000	2498000	I can't do it.
2498000	2500000	So the beta won't be open, I won't be able to play it.
2500000	2506000	But of course Destiny 2 on PC is going to be in the Battle.net interface.
2506000	2512000	So that begs the question, would they go so far as to include a Destiny character
2512000	2514000	in Heroes of the Storm?
2514000	2516000	I know some Blizzard people are like, shut up,
2516000	2519000	because Destiny is an Activision game, or a Bungie game,
2519000	2521000	it's not a Blizzard game.
2521000	2526000	And I'm like, well, that's not stopping them from showing up on Battle.net.
2526000	2528000	That's the first date.
2528000	2531000	That's first base.
2531000	2534000	Who knows, Destiny 2 might get to second or third base.
2534000	2538000	Is third base having a skin in your collector's edition
2538000	2540000	for like a World of Warcraft expansion or something?
2540000	2544000	I don't know, I think a home run would just be straight up like
2544000	2546000	Blizzard develops Destiny 3.
2546000	2548000	I don't know, I'm going crazy.
2548000	2552000	But I think I wouldn't completely shut the door to that.
2552000	2555000	I mean, it is still all Activision at the end of the day, who knows.
2555000	2558000	ActDef suggests skins for Overwatch, maybe.
2558000	2561000	So maybe not characters, but maybe like an icon,
2561000	2563000	or one of those like sprays, or a banner,
2563000	2565000	maybe something a little more cosmetic.
2565000	2567000	I could see that.
2567000	2569000	I could definitely be something, so we'll see.
2569000	2571000	Anyhow, let's move on.
2571000	2573000	We're going to get into some more gaming news,
2573000	2575000	but I do want to do some quick housekeeping and announcements
2575000	2577000	here at the top of the show.
2577000	2581000	Quickly, I do want to mention that we're not going to be here next week.
2581000	2583000	This is a planned week off.
2583000	2585000	I've been saying this for forever.
2585000	2587000	But it is Labor Day weekend coming up,
2587000	2589000	which means we're going to be at Dragon Con.
2589000	2592000	Sadly, Dark Soccer and Loki aren't able to take the trip out to Atlanta,
2592000	2595000	but this is going to be like my fifth Dragon Con.
2595000	2598000	I'm excited to be there with some of my other friends
2598000	2600000	from the Voice of Geeks Network,
2600000	2602000	including Bobby Blackwell will be there,
2602000	2604000	and Jon from Critical Myth is going to be there,
2604000	2606000	Gary from Critical Myth is going to be there,
2606000	2608000	Brian from British Invaders is going to be there.
2608000	2610000	That's everyone that I know of that's going,
2610000	2613000	and sometimes I run into random people.
2613000	2615000	On that Sunday, though, for people who can't make it,
2615000	2618000	if you're in the Sacramento area, is the Rainbow Festival.
2618000	2622000	So come downtown and show your support.
2622000	2624000	So no full LR next week either,
2624000	2626000	because you're going to be busy with that, right?
2626000	2628000	I probably will be back late enough,
2628000	2632000	or in enough time that I might be able to stream that night.
2632000	2634000	Don't they have Tiffany or something performing?
2634000	2636000	They have 80s. I think they have Tiffany or something.
2636000	2637000	I'll have to look again.
2637000	2639000	Yeah, I saw that and I laughed.
2639000	2641000	I was like, I would totally go to this if I was going to be in town.
2641000	2644000	But if I'm right, I think the main stage is hosted by
2644000	2646000	Taron Through You again.
2646000	2649000	Last year we had Detox, which was really cool.
2649000	2652000	Yeah, I've seen Taron. She's a local drag queen.
2652000	2654000	I've seen her at Badlands before. She's good. She's good.
2654000	2656000	A lot of fun.
2656000	2660000	I hope I'm not wrong on this, but I think she's an older queen too.
2660000	2663000	So I think she gives old people like me hope.
2663000	2666000	Anyway, my schedule at Dragon Con,
2666000	2668000	for those of you who are going to be meeting me in Atlanta,
2668000	2672000	you can check out one of four panels I'm going to be on at Dragon Con.
2672000	2675000	You can check out a panel called It's Just a Game,
2675000	2677000	Social Contracts and Multiplayer Gaming.
2677000	2679000	These are all, by the way, on the podcast track.
2679000	2681000	So this does tie into podcasting.
2681000	2684000	That's going to be on a Friday at 1 p.m.
2684000	2687000	And I'm going to be joined by Bobby and Paul and Dennis
2687000	2689000	from Giant Size Team Up.
2689000	2692000	And we're going to have a talk about implied social contracts
2692000	2695000	and multiplayer gaming from the tabletop to the video screen.
2695000	2697000	So that's going to be interesting, kind of like how that
2697000	2700000	those social dynamics kind of translate into
2700000	2703000	what we're doing here in podcasting and so forth.
2703000	2704000	I think that could be very interesting.
2704000	2706000	So we're going to talk about that on Friday.
2706000	2708000	Then I have a couple panels on Saturday.
2708000	2711000	On Saturday, we're going to be on this panel called,
2711000	2714000	and I say we because Bobby's going to be on this as well,
2714000	2716000	a panel called Getting the Word Out,
2716000	2719000	Introducing Your Show to an Ever-Evolving Internet.
2719000	2722000	And, you know, since we've been doing OLR for 15 years,
2722000	2725000	we've seen Skype come and rise up.
2725000	2728000	We've seen Twitter come. We've seen Myspace come and go.
2728000	2730000	We've seen, you know, Facebook rise up.
2730000	2732000	So, you know, you kind of have to adjust to new social networks
2732000	2733000	as they come up.
2733000	2735000	Twitch will be another big one, you know,
2735000	2737000	and kind of cater the promotion to your show
2737000	2739000	and kind of stay ahead of the curve on this stuff.
2739000	2743000	Are you saying that GeoCities page is no longer good to get the word out?
2743000	2747000	It's probably as effective as continuing to use Windows XP to do your show.
2747000	2751000	Anyway, I will be joined on that panel by, of course,
2751000	2754000	Bobby, our friend Charles McFall from the Pokemon Go podcast,
2754000	2757000	Dennis Lee Robinson, and Justin Robert Young,
2757000	2759000	who you guys know him from Night Attack,
2759000	2760000	if you ever heard that show.
2760000	2764000	So, I'm very honored to be on a panel with him and all those guys.
2764000	2768000	Broadcasting and new media will be the other panel I'm on Saturday at 4 o'clock.
2768000	2772000	That is going to be a discussion where I'm going to be joined by Jay Patrick,
2772000	2774000	who's a radio broadcast vet of 20 years.
2774000	2776000	He's actually a program director for iHeartRadio,
2776000	2778000	so that'll be really cool.
2778000	2781000	Oh, sorry, been a program director for iHeartRadio,
2781000	2783000	Cumulus Media, and Saga Communications.
2783000	2786000	And so we'll talk a little bit about, you know, the on-air presence,
2786000	2789000	choosing your equipment, and talent best practices.
2789000	2792000	I have no idea what business I have being on this panel.
2792000	2795000	We use the very sophisticated Windows XP.
2795000	2797000	I know, I'm like, wait a minute.
2797000	2798000	It's classic, but it works.
2798000	2799000	I might be showing my quality.
2799000	2803000	I guess, but I did do college radio, and I've done, you know,
2803000	2806000	Twitch and all that other stuff, so I guess I have some insight on that part.
2806000	2811000	But I definitely am going to be in the shadow of these speakers,
2811000	2814000	also on this panel, including Chris Gore,
2814000	2816000	as well as Jay Patrick and Charles McFall.
2816000	2817000	That'll be fun.
2817000	2819000	And then one more panel for you guys.
2819000	2822000	The very last panel, actually, Monday at 2.30.
2822000	2826000	The Ask a Podcaster Anything, the panel to end all panels.
2826000	2831000	It's basically the we are done with the weekend AMA type of panel.
2831000	2833000	And so that'll be fun.
2833000	2836000	So that is going to be the very last panel Monday at 2.30 p.m.
2836000	2839000	Of course, I'll be popping into other stuff throughout the event,
2839000	2843000	but all of those panels at the Hilton Galleria 6,
2843000	2845000	that's a brand new room.
2845000	2848000	It used to be two years ago where the board gaming was
2848000	2850000	before they moved it to America Mart.
2850000	2853000	That whole basement is now more ballrooms, basically.
2853000	2856000	So that is where the podcast track is moved to.
2856000	2857000	Are you going to have a ballroom blitz?
2857000	2858000	I hope so.
2858000	2859000	Well, we have new neighbors this year.
2859000	2862000	Our old neighbors were the Skeptics track and the EFF track,
2862000	2864000	which were both awesome tracks.
2864000	2865000	Like, they're awesome.
2865000	2867000	But I am really excited about our new neighbors, too,
2867000	2870000	because our new neighbors, I believe, are moving over from the Sheraton.
2870000	2872000	So our new neighbors is the Trek track.
2872000	2873000	So that's going to be fun.
2873000	2874000	So I'm excited about that.
2874000	2876000	And this is another chance for me to say,
2876000	2878000	Grandpa from the Starboard Power Coupling podcast,
2878000	2883000	well, I've been begging, begging to come to Dragon Con for like four years.
2883000	2886000	Now I'm going to be like, and our neighbors are the fucking Trek track
2886000	2888000	and you're still not fucking here.
2888000	2892000	Get with the program, Captain Matt.
2892000	2893000	Anyway.
2893000	2895000	By the way, I did look it up.
2895000	2897000	And Tiffany will be.
2897000	2898000	Yes.
2898000	2899000	And you won't be here.
2899000	2900000	I know.
2900000	2902000	And our queen this year is Peppermint.
2902000	2904000	Yes, I heard that Peppermint was going to be there.
2904000	2905000	And Wendy Ho.
2905000	2906000	I know you love Peppermint.
2906000	2907000	Peppermint was one of your faves from season nine.
2907000	2908000	I love Peppermint.
2908000	2909000	That's great.
2909000	2910000	You'll have fun.
2910000	2911000	And Frenchie Davis.
2911000	2912000	Oh, my God.
2912000	2914000	Wasn't she the one that was like kicked off Idol
2914000	2915000	and then she went on The Voice or something like that?
2915000	2916000	Something like that.
2916000	2917000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2917000	2918000	That's funny.
2918000	2921000	I'm great that she still gets that coin from doing events like this.
2921000	2922000	That's cool.
2922000	2926000	Anyway, what was I going to say about Dragon Con and all that?
2926000	2928000	Oh, also important to plug, the Discord.
2928000	2931000	So if you're not going to Dragon Con, I'm sad, but I realize some.
2931000	2933000	You all have travel restrictions and stuff.
2933000	2936000	So you might want to check out our Discord channel,
2936000	2940000	which is Discord, excuse me, vognetwork.com slash Discord.
2940000	2943000	We actually have, we're going to have a temporary channel for Dragon Con.
2943000	2944000	We'll put some pictures.
2944000	2945000	We'll put some videos.
2945000	2948000	If you guys want to try to find us at the convention,
2948000	2950000	that's the best way to like chat us and find us.
2950000	2954000	And we'll post reminders of our upcoming panels and all that stuff in Discord.
2954000	2957000	I kind of envision that as a way for everybody on the ground at Discord
2957000	2959000	to be able to connect with each other.
2959000	2962000	Because Dragon Con can be a very fluid, moving event,
2962000	2966000	especially because I'm hearing they're expecting more rain this year,
2966000	2968000	I think, than we've had in years past.
2968000	2972000	And I think that's because of the remnants of Hurricane Harvey
2972000	2975000	going on right now, which while I'm thinking about that,
2975000	2979000	please allow me to express, if any of our fam from OLR
2979000	2982000	and our listeners and folks you care about
2982000	2986000	are in the path of that hurricane, Corpus Christi and Houston
2986000	2989000	and all those cities there, we're really thinking of you guys right now.
2989000	2993000	I'm just horrible watching all that stuff on the news
2993000	2995000	and some of those photos that are coming out and so forth.
2995000	3000000	And I would definitely encourage folks to do more than just, you know,
3000000	3002000	send a thoughtful tweet and so forth.
3002000	3004000	I will try to do this as well.
3004000	3008000	If you can, donate, donate.
3008000	3010000	But not to the Red Cross.
3010000	3014000	Investigate the, you know, in times like these when people's lives are on the line,
3014000	3016000	I want to donate to organizations that I know
3016000	3018000	where they're helping and on the front line.
3018000	3022000	But just investigate the charity that you want to do
3022000	3024000	and, you know, donate appropriately.
3024000	3028000	And just make sure that, you know, you can do what you can to help.
3028000	3033000	So I just, I feel really horrible for everything that's going on in Texas right now.
3033000	3038000	Having flashbacks to the mid-90s when flooding was happening in my neighborhood,
3038000	3040000	and that was no fun to go through at all.
3040000	3044000	So it wasn't even nearly as bad as what's going on in Texas.
3044000	3045000	I can't even imagine.
3045000	3047000	So my thoughts are definitely with you guys.
3047000	3049000	All right.
3049000	3051000	Let's move on to some gaming news, shall we?
3051000	3052000	Let's get back to video games.
3052000	3053000	Loki.
3053000	3057000	Yeah, so I guess this is Half-Life reconfirmed,
3057000	3060000	or at least what it would have been, sort of.
3060000	3065000	Mark Laidlaw, you may remember, recently left Valve.
3065000	3075000	He put out kind of a storyline or like a piece of writing on his blog, actually.
3075000	3078000	He's changed some of the names to protect the innocent.
3078000	3084000	But he does have a post on there that's basically a letter from Gordon Freeman
3084000	3090000	writing to Alex Vance and talking about the events that happened after Half-Life 2 Episode 2.
3090000	3095000	Of course, recently he's had to kind of change some of those.
3095000	3100000	So now, of course, Gordon Freeman is now Gertie Fremont,
3100000	3104000	and Alex Vance is Alex Vont and stuff like that.
3104000	3106000	G-Man is Mrs. X.
3106000	3109000	But you can kind of draw the similarities there.
3109000	3118000	So if you want to check it out, it's at marklaidlaw.com slash apestle-3.
3118000	3121000	I'm sure if you just go to the main site, you'll probably find it.
3121000	3123000	And of course, you know, everybody's kind of like,
3123000	3127000	oh my God, you know, now we can kind of see what would have happened.
3127000	3133000	And since I have no context whatsoever with Half-Life having, sadly,
3133000	3137000	not played the first or second game, even though I do own them,
3137000	3141000	they sit in the vault of unplayed games in my Steam library,
3141000	3146000	I wouldn't even be able to tell you about what the hell this is.
3146000	3151000	But I'm sure the people that do play Half-Life are probably pretty excited about this
3151000	3152000	and disappointed at the same time.
3152000	3154000	I was going to say, I don't know if it's excitement,
3154000	3157000	because it's kind of that disappointment of this game may never happen.
3157000	3159000	So I don't know.
3159000	3161000	Yeah, it is kind of disappointing.
3161000	3165000	But I also kind of got the sense that it may not actually be the plot of a Half-Life 3.
3165000	3167000	Like, it may be a rejected plot type of thing.
3167000	3171000	Like, this was one idea I had written down, and it's not what we went with.
3171000	3174000	I mean, if you consider how long this game has been in development,
3174000	3177000	if it's been in development, let's just pretend it has been,
3177000	3179000	if you consider how long this game has been in development,
3179000	3182000	it's fully possible that the story they were originally going with
3182000	3184000	isn't going to match the story they were going to end with.
3184000	3186000	Hello, Final Fantasy XV.
3186000	3187000	Right?
3187000	3189000	So, I mean, it's very possible things change,
3189000	3192000	and maybe this is some, like, old story that isn't happening anymore.
3192000	3194000	So, who knows? Maybe. Maybe.
3194000	3197000	Anyway, I do just want to acknowledge, over in our chat room,
3197000	3200000	over at live.vognetwork.com, some people saying that your mic is going in and out.
3200000	3202000	Great. Just what we need now.
3202000	3203000	It's awesome.
3203000	3204000	There's another thing breaking down.
3204000	3206000	That's just another mic I'll have to buy.
3206000	3207000	And, no, that's the same one you've always had,
3207000	3209000	so just make sure your thumb isn't hitting that power,
3209000	3211000	because that power switch is really sensitive on that.
3211000	3212000	I'm touching the power switch.
3212000	3214000	You may have to kind of make sure this bottom portion is connected.
3214000	3217000	I know it's stupid, but we'll just, why not?
3217000	3220000	Only the best quality microphones for our podcast.
3220000	3222000	Why not? I've got to replace computers.
3222000	3224000	But these mics are, what, six years old?
3224000	3227000	No, it's whenever Brad from, actually, yeah, it is probably that old,
3227000	3230000	because Brad from Pod Culture sent these over
3230000	3233000	when we were in the apartment studio.
3233000	3236000	So it's at least four, you know, because we've been in this house for three years.
3236000	3238000	So about four years, probably.
3238000	3240000	So it's probably time. It's probably time, but...
3240000	3243000	I'll just replace my own mic when it starts going out, so don't worry.
3243000	3246000	I still think I have my Behringer mic.
3246000	3247000	Great.
3247000	3249000	So I'll bring it back.
3249000	3252000	Well, we'll figure that out, but unfortunately, since it is live,
3252000	3254000	I can't be like, stop the show, let's replace it.
3254000	3257000	It'll just, Loki will kind of fan through best he can there.
3257000	3259000	And I'll just add that to the list.
3259000	3261000	Things broken in the studio.
3261000	3262000	Whatever.
3262000	3263000	Why not?
3263000	3265000	While I'm about to go on a panel about how to be your most professional,
3265000	3269000	while you're doing all your voices on the radio.
3271000	3273000	All right, well, moving on.
3273000	3275000	So let's talk about Gamescom a little bit,
3275000	3278000	and Microsoft really kind of had a lot of the news out of Gamescom,
3278000	3282000	because, of course, they're pushing the Xbox One X.
3282000	3285000	And the Xbox One X, of course, is on its way out in November.
3285000	3289000	And there was some talk about here is how to transfer your data
3289000	3292000	from the Xbox One to the Xbox One X,
3292000	3295000	because it is anticipated that there are, you know,
3295000	3299000	hardcore Microsoft fans out there who want to take their Xbox Ones
3299000	3301000	and basically upgrade to an Xbox One X.
3301000	3303000	So they'll be taking their data and transferring it over.
3303000	3304000	Why not?
3304000	3307000	I did the same thing with PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 4 Pro,
3307000	3308000	which I regret doing.
3308000	3311000	But, you know, some folks may have better luck
3311000	3314000	when it comes to Microsoft and the Xbox One.
3314000	3316000	So anyway, there's several ways to do it.
3316000	3320000	You can back up your user settings on an external drive,
3320000	3323000	and then you can take the external drive over to the Xbox One X.
3323000	3327000	You can also patch games and then transfer them using an external drive,
3327000	3329000	same way, you know, that again.
3329000	3332000	But you can also transfer data over the home network.
3332000	3335000	And that was what you could do with PlayStation 4 or PlayStation 4 Pro,
3335000	3337000	just plan on, at least on the PlayStation.
3337000	3339000	It took a few hours to do that.
3339000	3342000	So if you're going to do that with the Microsoft Xbox,
3342000	3346000	be sure that you put ample time aside for that process to happen.
3346000	3349000	But that'll probably be the easiest way to do it for most people,
3349000	3352000	is to just use the magic of your home network
3352000	3355000	to transfer that information over.
3355000	3358000	I know that, you know, we didn't talk a lot about it
3358000	3359000	in the intro to the show tonight,
3359000	3363000	but I know that those pre-orders went up as well,
3363000	3366000	and they went pretty fast.
3366000	3368000	But most people aren't complaining about that.
3368000	3369000	Well, we talked about that last week
3369000	3371000	because that was kind of part of their little presentation.
3371000	3372000	Oh, yeah, that's right, that's right.
3372000	3374000	It had come up right after Sunday.
3374000	3376000	I guess I was just seeing more of the social media
3376000	3377000	and stuff kind of followed it.
3377000	3378000	Yeah, the Project Scorpio,
3378000	3379000	I know we got into that a little bit last week.
3379000	3380000	But see, that's the thing, though.
3380000	3382000	With the Xbox One X, though,
3382000	3385000	like, I'm confident that we'll see those in stores.
3385000	3387000	Like, because Microsoft has a track record,
3387000	3388000	as well as Sony,
3388000	3390000	that those systems will be there,
3390000	3391000	and they'll be available,
3391000	3393000	whereas I don't trust Nintendo for shit for that.
3393000	3397000	Well, no shade, but the truth, I think,
3397000	3400000	is that there's more interest in the SNES Classic
3400000	3403000	than there is the Xbox One X, at least right now.
3403000	3405000	Um, well...
3405000	3407000	We'll see when the numbers come out.
3407000	3411000	If that's the case, then take that as a fucking hint.
3411000	3412000	I mean, because you're just literally
3412000	3413000	leaving money on the table
3413000	3415000	if you're not going to produce enough systems,
3415000	3419000	and, I mean, you're just throwing money away.
3421000	3423000	To register participation for this week's episode
3423000	3425000	of Orange Andrade, go to vognetwork.com.
3425000	3428000	Use the passphrase, ice.
3428000	3430000	I know Nintendo could live in a world
3430000	3433000	where the Super Nintendo outsells the PlayStation 4
3433000	3434000	and the Xbox One.
3434000	3437000	Exactly, like, why build the hype on,
3437000	3438000	oh, the system can't be bought, oh...
3438000	3439000	All right, I don't want to regress.
3439000	3440000	No, no, no, hold on, I'm just,
3440000	3441000	I have a positive here, okay?
3441000	3443000	It's like, why build the hype on,
3443000	3445000	you know, the system can't be bought and stuff?
3445000	3446000	Build the hype on?
3446000	3448000	We sold this many million units.
3448000	3449000	That's the hype you build on.
3449000	3451000	Look how fucking strong a brand is.
3451000	3453000	Super Nintendo system,
3453000	3456000	we fucking outsold the Xbox One this month,
3456000	3457000	or something like that.
3457000	3459000	That's the hype you build that shit on.
3459000	3461000	Not this, oh, we don't sell enough,
3461000	3463000	and we're not producing enough,
3463000	3466000	oh, it's the ports and the season,
3466000	3468000	blah, blah, blah, whatever.
3468000	3470000	Anyway, well, what about this, though,
3470000	3471000	with the whole Xbox One X?
3471000	3474000	It appears that Microsoft has stopped
3474000	3477000	making the Xbox One completely, already.
3478000	3479000	They're gone.
3479000	3480000	But they're still making them, though.
3480000	3482000	You know, they are no longer,
3482000	3484000	they took down the listing from the Microsoft store
3484000	3486000	and all that, I mean, there's still an ample supply
3486000	3487000	on shelves and things,
3487000	3489000	but they are not making more Xbox Ones.
3489000	3491000	Well, probably the original Xbox One,
3491000	3494000	because they have the Xbox One S,
3494000	3496000	so that's what they're using.
3496000	3500000	So yeah, the old, old, old, old fat fucking VCR system,
3500000	3502000	yes, that's not being made anymore,
3502000	3505000	but the Xbox One S, which is a nice-looking system,
3505000	3508000	that's probably being made, which makes sense.
3508000	3509000	Ah, there you go, so the original,
3509000	3512000	an act-def confirms the original model, the VCR.
3512000	3514000	Okay, so you just can't get the original model anymore,
3514000	3515000	but you can get the Xbox One.
3515000	3518000	Which, there's no reason you'd want the old one anyways,
3518000	3520000	because the new one's better.
3520000	3523000	Right, new ones play the HD Blu-rays and all that stuff, right?
3523000	3527000	Yeah, it has, doesn't it have the HDR stuff to it?
3527000	3529000	Yeah, yeah, they added a lot,
3529000	3532000	and the PlayStation 4 Pro is touting, so.
3532000	3533000	Yeah.
3533000	3538000	Alright, so anyway, you know, here's the thing,
3538000	3540000	I kind of feel burned by my upgrade to the Pro,
3540000	3543000	that I'm not really sold on the Xbox One X,
3543000	3546000	but I am sold on making my PC powerful enough
3546000	3549000	to play a lot of those Xbox One X games,
3549000	3551000	so did Microsoft really lose me?
3551000	3552000	I don't think they did,
3552000	3555000	it's just that I'm choosing to do it on PC instead.
3555000	3557000	At least for now, I mean, who knows?
3557000	3559000	That may change, that may change my mind.
3559000	3564000	Well, I mean, honestly, 4K gaming and stuff's still very early, so.
3564000	3565000	Yes.
3565000	3569000	I mean, there's still time for all that.
3569000	3572000	Yeah, I mean, when Forza Horizon 4 is announced,
3572000	3575000	in lovely 4K, because you know it'll happen,
3575000	3578000	it's gonna happen, and it'll probably be next year's game.
3578000	3582000	I want to get a 4K TV, I've been wanting one for a while,
3582000	3584000	and they've come down in price quite a bit,
3584000	3587000	I'm just waiting for the right moment.
3587000	3590000	I'm just worried the day I finally buy a 4K TV,
3590000	3591000	you know it's gonna happen.
3591000	3592000	8K TV.
3592000	3594000	8K is the big new, big new thing.
3594000	3597000	Honestly though, like, it's, they're,
3597000	3600000	they're probably not gonna do that because it's,
3600000	3601000	Sure.
3601000	3606000	It's bandwidth, I mean, the content's just not out there right now for that,
3606000	3607000	I wouldn't be worried.
3607000	3611000	Dark Tetsuya says, I heard 8K was already a thing in Japan.
3613000	3616000	This is why I don't, this is why I don't trust it.
3619000	3620000	It's just the reality.
3620000	3623000	Alright, and there it is, AkumaJP in chat confirms,
3623000	3626000	actually 8K is already here in Japan.
3626000	3629000	But let's be honest, so, looking at 4K and 8K,
3629000	3631000	are you really gonna notice that much of a difference?
3631000	3633000	I mean, really, is it gonna be like,
3633000	3635000	That's what they say every time.
3635000	3638000	Is it gonna be at that point like the pixels are so fucking small
3638000	3640000	that they're indistinguishable anyways?
3640000	3642000	I fucking bet, I would fucking bet.
3642000	3645000	Dark Tetsuya, you know this show better than I do.
3645000	3647000	If I went back to a certain episode,
3647000	3650000	would I be able to find an episode where Loki says,
3650000	3654000	you can't tell the difference between 4K and HDTV?
3654000	3656000	I've never said that, why would I say that?
3656000	3661000	I feel like it's the same thing, like as the technology gets better.
3661000	3663000	Why would I say that? Because that's so stupid.
3663000	3666000	That would be, that's, I mean, let's put it this way,
3666000	3670000	like it's not a huge difference like depending on the size of the screen
3670000	3672000	that you have and how far away you're sitting.
3672000	3676000	But like once you get to that resolution, doubling it again,
3676000	3680000	you're not gonna notice that the return on investment is not quite there.
3680000	3684000	It's like from the jump from VHS, the DVD was pretty big.
3684000	3687000	The jump from DVD, the HD wasn't as big.
3687000	3691000	The jump from HD to 4K isn't as great either.
3691000	3696000	4K to 8K, I don't think it's gonna be very noticeable.
3696000	3700000	And what advantage, I think at that point you're just gonna be pushing,
3700000	3703000	I would imagine, keep 4K and push a higher frame rate.
3703000	3706000	Because you can do a lot more fancy shit with that nice resolution.
3706000	3708000	That's true, I'm more impressed with this.
3708000	3711000	Instead of just like pushing, because eventually it's just,
3712000	3715000	you know, how, when are we gonna stop with resolution?
3715000	3720000	I mean, really, at some point you're gonna exceed the amount that,
3720000	3724000	you know, traditional film can even, like, the resolution of film.
3724000	3726000	I mean, you're not gonna be able to do that anymore.
3726000	3730000	I remember the first time I saw, it wasn't just HDTV,
3730000	3733000	but it was HD on a TV with a high refresh rate
3733000	3735000	and that whole higher frames a second.
3735000	3738000	I was like, this is unreal. Like, this looks crazy.
3738000	3740000	You should check out, there was a video that I saw,
3740000	3743000	like Nastectips did, they built a, it was,
3743000	3745000	I wonder if, say it was like 16K rig,
3745000	3747000	but they used, like, giant 4K monitors,
3747000	3749000	and the thing was, like, fucking huge,
3749000	3751000	because it was 16 monitors huge,
3751000	3753000	and they played, you know, a few games on it,
3753000	3756000	but, I mean, that's the kind of thing, like,
3756000	3761000	imagine shrinking that down to the size of a, you know, like a regular TV.
3761000	3763000	You're not, from, like, sitting across the room,
3763000	3766000	you're not gonna notice the difference.
3766000	3769000	Your eyes can't see that kind of detail.
3769000	3771000	Alright, Dark Tetsuya, put that in the episode summary
3771000	3776000	so we can come back to this in four years when 8K is all the rage.
3776000	3779000	And Loki says, I never said that.
3779000	3782000	Well, when our infrastructure for the internet gets better
3782000	3785000	to where we can stream that shit, like, no problem,
3785000	3788000	and the technology's out there and the content's out there,
3788000	3791000	then sure, I'm on board with it, but, like...
3791000	3793000	This is one of those things I want to put on a USB stick
3793000	3797000	and then put in the time capsule, but don't open until 2020.
3797000	3799000	Little presents to myself.
3799000	3800000	Alright, anyway, alright.
3800000	3801000	Maybe we've got the capsule.
3801000	3802000	Yeah, I know, right.
3802000	3804000	Maybe that's something at the end of the year,
3804000	3807000	I'll have Dark Tetsuya pick some OLR clips.
3807000	3809000	Like, I can't remember, did we do that right at New Year's,
3809000	3813000	or is that, like, you know, some mid-time during the year?
3813000	3815000	When did we do that time capsule?
3815000	3817000	I think before the summer, but we're opening it at the end of the year.
3817000	3819000	Anyway, we need to move on, we're running long.
3819000	3820000	Yes, we do.
3820000	3827000	So, one of my favorite RPGs is Secret of Mana, Seiken Densetsu 2,
3827000	3828000	as it was in Japan,
3828000	3833000	and as we know that there was a Seiken Densetsu collection
3833000	3836000	that was released in Japan that had all three of them,
3836000	3838000	which the first one we got is Final Fantasy Adventure,
3838000	3842000	the second one we had is Secret of Mana, and then Seiken Densetsu 3.
3842000	3848000	So, Seiken Densetsu 2 is being released as Secret of Mana here in the US
3848000	3853000	for PlayStation and Steam, and the pre-order is already up.
3853000	3856000	I've got it on my wish list, just it's going to go in the budget,
3856000	3858000	and I don't know what system we're getting it on,
3858000	3861000	but it's really pretty, it's really well updated,
3861000	3863000	the music has been remastered,
3863000	3866000	and it looks like with the voiceovers on there,
3866000	3868000	you may be able to choose which language you listen to it in,
3868000	3870000	which would be great.
3870000	3875000	So, the pre-order that I found on Steam was, like, 40 bucks,
3875000	3877000	which really isn't terrible.
3878000	3881000	Of course, the big edition that came out in Japan, though,
3881000	3883000	came with, like, little figurines,
3883000	3887000	and if you get the pre-order or a day of purchase,
3887000	3890000	then you get, like, special tiger outfits for your characters.
3890000	3892000	Oh, yeah, like, wouldn't they have, like, little moogle outfits, too?
3892000	3895000	You get, like, a moogle outfit and a tiger outfit.
3895000	3896000	Tiger now.
3897000	3899000	You sure refer to me as Mr. Tiger.
3900000	3902000	Do they have tiger's blood?
3903000	3906000	But, um, no, that was a real pleasant surprise to see,
3906000	3907000	but here's my question.
3907000	3909000	Which Seiken Detsetsu was Secret of Evermore?
3911000	3913000	I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
3913000	3915000	Dark Sakura took me seriously for a minute,
3915000	3917000	and she's like, you just broke my brain.
3918000	3920000	I'm teasing, I'm teasing, I'm teasing.
3920000	3923000	But I did like Secret of Evermore.
3923000	3925000	I think that game is shit on unnecessarily.
3925000	3928000	Like, there are qualities about that game that I do like,
3928000	3931000	but, yes, that game is not part of the Seiken Detsetsu series.
3931000	3933000	It was a square USA game.
3933000	3936000	For some reason it's making me think that I need to actually
3936000	3938000	start playing through Terranigma.
3939000	3943000	Oh, now that's Enix's, like, Soul Blazer trilogy, right?
3943000	3945000	Illusion of Gaia we got over here.
3945000	3946000	Terranigma came out in Europe.
3946000	3948000	Was Brain Lord part of that, too?
3948000	3950000	I don't remember. I'll have to look it up.
3950000	3952000	Can we get a new toe ball game?
3953000	3955000	But when we get a new Bust-A-Groove.
3956000	3958000	No, Bust-A-Move.
3958000	3959000	Or Ur-Gites.
3959000	3961000	Do we get a new Ur-Gites? Because Ur-Gites is New York.
3961000	3963000	See, Rob, that's not true because you knew me.
3964000	3967000	But before you, Jamie. Yes, there was a day before you.
3967000	3970000	No, but you knew me when the first Bust-A-Move came out.
3972000	3974000	Because you played it at my house.
3974000	3975000	Not when it came out.
3975000	3977000	On that big Toshiba TV that we had back then.
3977000	3979000	Not when it first came out because my first game.
3979000	3983000	Before I played DDR, I played Bust-A in the US Groove 2.
3983000	3985000	I felt for certain that you knew me.
3985000	3987000	That was the game that enabled me to get into DDR.
3988000	3989000	Oh.
3989000	3990000	I know, right?
3990000	3994000	You remember the ones who introduced me to that game, though,
3994000	3997000	was Chris Tang and his girlfriend at the time.
3997000	3998000	Huh.
3998000	3999000	So.
3999000	4000000	Interesting.
4000000	4003000	I'm looking in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
4003000	4004000	Dark Tetsuya says-
4004000	4006000	I also remember he kicked Dan's ass at Street Fighter.
4006000	4008000	Dark Tetsuya confirms Brain Lord was Enix.
4008000	4015000	Yeah, it was. I know it was Enix, but was it part of the same developers that did Illusion of Gaia and that whole-
4015000	4017000	Because all those games are very similar.
4017000	4021000	I'm kind of wishing I could find a PAL cart of Terra Enigma.
4021000	4022000	Yeah, right?
4022000	4024000	It would just be nice to have, but I don't need it.
4024000	4030000	I mean, I've been trying to make some time to go back and play some of the stuff that I missed.
4030000	4037000	And that was on my list for sure, but I don't know if I more want to play Seiken Densetsu 3.
4037000	4038000	I mean, this is great.
4038000	4040000	And it's going to be released in January.
4040000	4041000	It'll be fine when it comes out.
4041000	4046000	But part of me wants to sit and have somebody there and play through Seiken Densetsu 3 again.
4046000	4050000	January, maybe Japanese release. Here it's February 15th, I think.
4050000	4053000	Steam said January when I looked at it. Hold on.
4053000	4055000	I thought they announced the release date is February 15th.
4055000	4058000	Hold on, let me reopen my Steam again and I will get the date off of Steam.
4058000	4059000	No worries.
4059000	4061000	Because I put it on my wish list there.
4061000	4068000	But as far as Secret of Mana goes and the remake, I was really jazzed when they announced it because it kind of came out of nowhere.
4068000	4074000	I think, you know, people didn't think that we were ever going to go back and revisit the series at this point.
4074000	4079000	What did we get? We got Legend of Mana and I feel like there was one more game in the series.
4079000	4081000	Never mind, it's February 15th, 2008.
4081000	4082000	Woo woo!
4082000	4083000	18.
4083000	4085000	My memory serves me good for something.
4085000	4089000	But yeah, I think people weren't expecting that, oh, we're going to get this Secret of Mana remake.
4089000	4091000	And it kind of looks like, to me, it looks like...
4091000	4094000	How the fuck is this like Danganronpa 2, Steam?
4094000	4096000	Steam is weird.
4096000	4098000	You like this because you like Danganronpa 2.
4098000	4100000	It's nothing like fucking Danganronpa.
4100000	4101000	They're both from Japan, so...
4101000	4103000	There's no murder mystery in Secret of Mana.
4103000	4105000	That you're aware of in the new one.
4105000	4107000	Maybe in the new one.
4107000	4110000	Those tiger suits came from somewhere.
4110000	4112000	Tiger murders.
4112000	4117000	But anyway, it looks to me a lot like the Final Fantasy IV kind of redo.
4117000	4119000	Or III, I guess was really the first one.
4119000	4121000	Final Fantasy III and then they did IV.
4121000	4123000	Secret of Mana kind of looks like it's in that same style.
4123000	4126000	I think that it fits, though, its original art style, to be honest.
4126000	4127000	Yeah, it fits.
4127000	4129000	Because the way that the characters were designed,
4129000	4133000	they don't look too different in their 3D models.
4133000	4134000	Yeah.
4134000	4137000	I'm also pleasantly surprised that they're not telling us about this
4137000	4140000	years in advance, like the Final Fantasy VII remake.
4140000	4144000	They're telling us this and it's out in less than six months.
4144000	4146000	And that's a nice surprise.
4146000	4148000	Again, things might get delayed.
4148000	4151000	But I kind of feel like this one's probably been far enough along
4151000	4154000	and they've been working on it long enough where it's going to be ready to go
4154000	4155000	and they're going to make the release date.
4155000	4156000	So I think that's really exciting.
4156000	4158000	Now, one other thing I do want to bring up,
4158000	4160000	because I've seen a lot of talk about it on Twitter,
4160000	4163000	but a lot of people saying, why aren't you putting it on the Switch?
4163000	4166000	Why is the Switch getting skipped for this?
4166000	4170000	Because this would be a fantastic game to play on your TV and take on the go.
4170000	4172000	I don't disagree with that notion.
4172000	4174000	I would love to be able to play this game on the Switch.
4174000	4180000	I kind of feel like because this game has probably been secretly in development for years,
4180000	4183000	I mean, it's probably been secretly in development for a couple years at least,
4183000	4185000	I think Nintendo is probably still viewed as too risky.
4185000	4188000	And I think probably when this game was first developed,
4188000	4194000	the Wii U is probably what was out and they didn't want to develop for that.
4194000	4198000	So they moved on and decided to go with PlayStation 4,
4198000	4200000	which was probably the bigger deal at the time.
4203000	4206000	It's hard to decide to develop for another system,
4206000	4211000	especially when you don't know how it's going to end up doing that early.
4212000	4216000	Who knows when they were alerted to the Switch being in development.
4216000	4221000	Exactly, so I'm not going to give them too much shit about skipping the Switch,
4221000	4223000	but I hope it's something that might be visited in the future.
4223000	4228000	And to be fair, the Switch did end up getting that secret Amana collection,
4228000	4232000	at least in Japan, and the Switch is region free for what it's worth.
4232000	4235000	So maybe that's kind of a consolation prize, I don't know.
4235000	4238000	But the Switch does have that and other platforms don't have it.
4238000	4241000	So I'm not going to be like, oh Square is a bunch of Nintendo haters.
4241000	4244000	I can kind of see the logic and why the Switch got skipped.
4244000	4245000	They did quite the opposite, actually.
4245000	4249000	They put a lot of shit exclusive on Nintendo platforms.
4249000	4253000	But if they decide to do a similar remake for 2nd Densetsu 3,
4253000	4256000	or even Secret of Evermore, lol, they won't.
4256000	4260000	But 2nd Densetsu 3, even if they decide to go back and remake that as well,
4260000	4263000	then maybe they'll consider the Switch at that point or something.
4263000	4264000	So we'll see what happens.
4265000	4268000	Alright. Anyhow, let's move on. Some more stories. Right, Loki?
4268000	4276000	Yeah. So there's this game called Darkwood that has been out, I guess, on PC for a while now.
4276000	4285000	And they decided that to actually allow more people to play it,
4285000	4287000	they're going to pirate the game.
4287000	4290000	They basically uploaded it to Pirate Bay.
4291000	4294000	They said there's no catch, no added pirate hats for the characters.
4294000	4300000	They just uploaded it for free so that it will help people check it out
4300000	4303000	that may not have been able to afford the game in the first place.
4303000	4307000	So Darkwood, I guess, released that originally in 2014.
4307000	4312000	And now it's just kind of out there.
4312000	4319000	I'm surprised with it being out for so long, though, that people wouldn't have been able to play it cheaply.
4319000	4323000	I mean, putting some keys out there in one of those bundle sites or something for like a buck or something.
4323000	4326000	You can't afford a dollar.
4326000	4329000	But neat press either way. It gives them exposure.
4329000	4335000	And saying that they're the ones doing it in the first place, I guess that's...
4335000	4337000	You can't really fault them for that.
4337000	4343000	I think there was an angle to this, too, where they were trying to combat against some of those third-party key sellers.
4343000	4345000	Yeah, like G2A.
4345000	4352000	Of course, they were selling a lot of keys or they were grabbing a lot of the free keys that they would send out.
4352000	4360000	They said this practice makes it impossible for us to do any giveaways or send keys to people who actually don't have the money to play Darkwood
4360000	4364000	because they would just turn around and resell them and say,
4364000	4367000	Please don't buy it through any of the key selling sites.
4367000	4371000	By doing that, you're just feeding the cancer that is leeching off this industry.
4372000	4375000	Like we said with the scalpers earlier, same type of thing.
4375000	4378000	Don't give these people money because they're making the situation worse.
4380000	4386000	Well, very interesting move. It kind of sounds like the nuclear option is to go put it on Pirate Bay.
4386000	4391000	Honestly, it's been out for three or four years.
4391000	4399000	I don't know if this was the intention, but I bet a lot of gaming shows probably weren't talking about this game in 2017.
4399000	4403000	And now they all are this week, so it is some interesting press for the game.
4403000	4405000	Yeah, it's good.
4405000	4411000	I've seen some other games that they had people put out for free on Steam,
4411000	4416000	even changing the price of free for a short period of time because they have a new game coming out.
4416000	4419000	So it's a good way to kind of drive that press saying,
4419000	4422000	Oh, hey, there's a game that's coming out for free. You can check it out.
4422000	4427000	And there are also companies releasing a new game soon, that type of thing.
4427000	4436000	So it's not a bad idea, especially that the game's probably run its course for the most part after three years.
4436000	4441000	All right, well, moving on. Video game consoles, they don't just play video games.
4441000	4443000	They have a lot of other apps and things that they do as well.
4443000	4448000	In fact, on the Xbox One, you can use Twitter on the Xbox One, which I must confess I don't think I've ever done.
4448000	4453000	Or maybe I used it that one time to write that tweet that says, Hi, I'm on my Xbox One.
4453000	4457000	Yeah, hi, I'm on my Vita. And then that's it. Like you never use it again, right?
4457000	4464000	Well, interesting because there was an update that they made to Twitter on Xbox One that may be worth revisiting,
4464000	4471000	depending on what you're into, because it does a focus now for Twitter on live 360 degree video.
4471000	4476000	And a lot of platforms are kind of, you see us more on Facebook with the 360 degree videos and all this stuff.
4476000	4482000	So now Twitter is kind of looking to, you know, put the video content on Xbox One as opposed to just your Twitter stream.
4482000	4487000	So I think that's kind of interesting. Apple TV was already kind of doing this.
4487000	4493000	So this is kind of one of those. They now put it on Xbox One to kind of mimic what was going on on the Apple TV platform.
4493000	4498000	You know, it's too bad the Xbox 360 would have been a perfect name for a VR headset for the Xbox.
4498000	4499000	Right.
4499000	4506000	Which I wouldn't doubt that they could do that someday, being that this is the Xbox One,
4506000	4511000	and all naming conventions are just been, you know, any rules regarding that just been thrown out the door anyway.
4511000	4516000	True. That's very true. But anyway, you can also do two video streams side by side.
4516000	4522000	I don't know how the audio would work in that. I guess you can select one or the other. Maybe you do just listen to both. Who knows?
4522000	4526000	Also Periscopes, since Twitter does own Periscope, Periscopes are included in this.
4526000	4532000	You can actually browse a global map and look at Periscopes from around the world.
4532000	4538000	So I'm sure during that boxing thing last night, people could look at pirate streams of that fight from around the world.
4538000	4542000	I don't follow that stuff at all, but it's all I saw on Twitter last night.
4542000	4546000	And all I would see on Facebook are people asking for pirate streams.
4546000	4551000	And one of my friend was actually doing like a broadcast and I guess got a strike or whatever they do on Facebook.
4551000	4558000	I don't even know if Facebook monitored that stuff, but Facebook live banned her from broadcasting for like three days.
4558000	4564000	Cause she was broadcasting that event last night, which, you know, people pay hundreds of dollars to see.
4564000	4569000	So it wasn't, wasn't it over really fast to like nine rounds. Yeah.
4569000	4575000	All the reactions I saw on Twitter were that it was kind of ridiculous, but I just, I don't.
4575000	4582000	Well, it's an MMA fighter versus, you know, it's like basically two, like, I don't know if they were undefeated,
4582000	4588000	but, um, you know, uh, undefeated boxer versus like an undefeated MMA fighter or something like that.
4588000	4592000	I, I could be completely wrong because I don't follow any sports.
4592000	4593000	I'm already bored.
4593000	4598000	But yeah, it was supposed to be them fighting each other like to see which is better, but you're doing boxing now.
4598000	4600000	If it's MMA, that would be interesting, but I don't know.
4600000	4602000	I should have done both.
4602000	4612000	Oh, and then something just to say in terms of physicality, an MMA fighter can't last in a boxing match and vice versa.
4612000	4617000	Here's what would have been interesting to me. Why not put them outside their element altogether?
4617000	4619000	That would have been interesting.
4619000	4626000	No, you might know them as these famous boxing and fighters, but can they do curling?
4626000	4629000	Go-karts, laser tag.
4629000	4639000	That I would fucking pay to see. That is some straight up like ABC, uh, Sunday night specials, Olympics of the stars or whatever they fucking call that shit.
4639000	4640000	Dancing with the stars.
4640000	4642000	Dancing with the stars. Perfect.
4642000	4646000	It would be something like that.
4646000	4650000	This Olympics got weird.
4650000	4656000	Act F suggests make them play Puyo Puyo Tetris against each other.
4656000	4665000	The event should be decided by voting with a live student, you know, they'll have live votes for people to submit events that they would participate in.
4665000	4672000	Yes. Well, don't let America vote because the cute young guy will always win. Did American Idol teach you nothing?
4672000	4680000	It doesn't matter that Adam Lambert was the better singer. The other guy was the cute young guy and he won.
4680000	4684000	Although, you know, Adam Lambert is no slouch himself, but you know, still.
4684000	4690000	Anyway, from Twitter to American Idol, there we are.
4690000	4697000	Or couldn't he like team up to beat up some other bad people? Like we can throw other people in the ring and they can just beat on them? I'd watch that.
4697000	4698000	Wait, just random people?
4698000	4700000	Like bad people, you know, like throw in like...
4700000	4701000	Like Nazis.
4701000	4706000	No, not necessarily. You can throw in Nazis, that'd be fine too, but like, you know, just annoying people.
4706000	4714000	I'm sure there's annoying people that we would just like to see. They should have a website where you vote for people with the most punchable faces and invite those people in.
4714000	4716000	You just want Celebrity Deathmatch to be a real show.
4716000	4718000	Yes, I do. Yes, I do.
4718000	4720000	MTV Celebrity Deathmatch.
4720000	4723000	I'm totally fine with that being a real show, yes.
4723000	4725000	Dark Soccer, are you able to see your brain?
4726000	4728000	I just see your eyes rolling over there.
4728000	4731000	Alright, why don't you depress the hell out of us with our next story?
4732000	4738000	This is actually... I kinda don't know how to feel about it. This is somebody actually that Dan's met before.
4738000	4743000	Said he was a really nice guy, so it just goes to show you can't always trust everyone you meet.
4745000	4752000	And I'm gonna lead up to it. This guy is named John Trudeau. He is a pinball designer.
4752000	4758000	He's designed some very amazing classic pinball, like Creature from the Black Lagoon.
4758000	4765000	And Black Rose, which is actually one of my favorite tables. The new Ghostbusters table. Judge Dredd.
4767000	4771000	Quite a few, quite a few really... Bride of Pinbots, another one.
4771000	4775000	So these are all really good pinball tables that everyone knows, right?
4776000	4779000	Well, he just got busted for kitty porn.
4780000	4793000	Apparently, police search led to him. And they seized his computer and found his equipment contained child pornography.
4793000	4801000	We don't know if he was actually producing it or just had it. But even having it is bad enough.
4802000	4805000	So he's currently being held on bond right now.
4805000	4807000	There's no nice way to spin this story.
4807000	4808000	There's not.
4808000	4816000	And it just goes to show that, like, what's on the outside surface, what people are like on the outside,
4816000	4820000	doesn't necessarily mean that they are 100% right in the head.
4820000	4828000	You know, because being in... If anyone listening to this show is into child porn, stop. All of it.
4828000	4832000	Go get yourself some fucking mental health. That's it.
4833000	4846000	But 69 years old, too. His career is over. And deservedly so, because people like that really shouldn't have a career.
4846000	4850000	So this is a really slippery slope and there's a part of me that's just like, just move on to the next story.
4850000	4856000	But I have to ask this question. Does it ruin the games that he created?
4856000	4857000	I don't think so.
4858000	4861000	Because more people had a hand in those things than just him.
4861000	4870000	I'll put it this way. If you were looking at the origins of everything, ruining the later things, we wouldn't have Volkswagens anymore.
4872000	4876000	I see what you mean. There's criminals everywhere, basically.
4876000	4877000	Right.
4879000	4884000	I do think that the value of his tables is going to go up because there's not going to be any more.
4885000	4888000	That's weird to think about, though. I don't like that.
4888000	4892000	Because you know they're not going to reprint any or recommission any of his tables.
4893000	4900000	I don't know about that. Why would they do that? Just because the designer or something was involved in that? That's stupid.
4900000	4907000	That's true. Most people aren't going to know. It doesn't have that same visibility that films do. You know what I mean?
4907000	4917000	But people who bother with pinball are going to know the names of the designers. People will know who Lawler is.
4921000	4924000	Great. I know him personally and I can't think of his name suddenly.
4925000	4933000	Steve Ritchie. They'll know who these people are. They'll know who the table designers are. They'll know who the artists behind the tables are.
4934000	4944000	Just today, Dan and I were talking about Christian Marsh, who did a bunch of pinballs in the 60s and 70s, including the one we own, Spanish Eyes.
4945000	4951000	He was also a Cubist painter during the mid-century.
4952000	4965000	But if you're a fan of it, you're going to know what this is. And just when you find it happening under your nose or in your backyard, as it were, it suddenly becomes this big betrayal.
4966000	4977000	And it really is. A person who we trust to be a sane individual who doesn't go around looking at children being abused in compromising situations.
4977000	4979000	It's a big shock.
4980000	4988000	Tiger Claw on chat says, I never understood why these people are into that it boggles the mind. Well, you know what? That's good.
4989000	4990000	It's because it's a mental illness.
4991000	4997000	Yeah. And not to, you know, we got to be careful when we talk about mental illness because there's a big spectrum of them. But, you know, I'm just saying.
4998000	4999000	Illness takes all forms.
5000000	5001000	Yes. Yes.
5001000	5005000	You know, and in this case, it's it's definitely.
5006000	5008000	I'm just saying it's for the best. You don't understand.
5009000	5010000	Well, yeah.
5011000	5012000	So anyway.
5013000	5024000	It's really disgusting. And I hope that he gets the counseling and everything that he needs to get over such a sickening addiction.
5025000	5027000	But at the same time, it's just.
5028000	5030000	I think we need to move on to another story.
5031000	5032000	I might have just thrown up in my mouth.
5033000	5035000	Let's go to another story. Let's talk about another video game. Loki.
5036000	5047000	Yes. Final Fantasy 15 was suddenly announced for Windows, so they're going to be releasing that out on PC sometime in early 2018.
5047000	5063000	It was revealed from a trailer from Nvidia that basically showed off the GTX 1080 TI kind of footage that they have captured their different Nvidia tech like the hair tech and stuff like that.
5063000	5068000	So it's going to support up to 4K resolution textures. Dolby Atmos.
5069000	5081000	They said a realistic turf advanced hair simulation, combustible fluid fire and smoke simulations, advanced shadows, high quality ambient inclusion and all sorts of stuff.
5082000	5084000	So, yeah, it looks pretty cool.
5087000	5088000	I guess it would, you know.
5089000	5098000	I guess the game could get better looking, but on top of that, they're going to have mod support. That's right. Mod support for Final Fantasy 15.
5099000	5100000	That's pretty awesome.
5102000	5113000	And then also Final Fantasy 15, if you're not even getting it on PC or you have it on console, they're getting this weird crossover DLC from Assassin's Creed.
5113000	5122000	So it's this Assassin's Festival DLC that they're going to have like a cross tie in with Assassin's Creed Origins.
5123000	5132000	And I guess starting August 30th, players will be able to obtain a dream egg from a Moogle Chocobo Carnival event.
5133000	5138000	And they'll be gifted the Assassin outfit for Noctis.
5138000	5148000	And then I guess following day on the 31st, they're going to have some other DLC that's going to transform one of the towns in the game with banners and festivals and stuff like that.
5149000	5157000	It almost sounds like the shit that they do for Final Fantasy 14 or something like that or 11 where they just kind of do these holiday events. It's kind of weird.
5158000	5164000	It is a little weird how they kind of treat it like Final Fantasy 14 in a way where they do online events like you would expect to see in an MMO.
5164000	5173000	But you know, I remember that I did what was the Moogle Chocobo Carnival or something, and it was like an extra menu option that you would load up.
5174000	5179000	And yeah, you get items that could go back in your regular save files. It was a little weird, but it worked. So it was kind of cool.
5180000	5190000	Anyway, since you brought up mods and the PC, you know the first thing that people are going to do with this game, and I don't care if it's dudes or it's chicks or whatever.
5190000	5201000	There's going to be nude mods. It's going to be the first thing that's made. So the big question, and there's a hilarious picture floating around Twitter right now of like the Final Fantasy 15 cast in very little clothing.
5202000	5211000	In like what is going to be a scene from the PC version basically when the mods come out. Well, of course, you know, they were actually asked about it.
5212000	5218000	Hajime Tabata was asked in an interview about the whole, you know, well, what are you going to do about nude mods type of thing.
5219000	5225000	And obviously there's some worry about we've made this great world and people might try to stuff all kind of strange things into it and mess it up.
5226000	5233000	When we were getting together for discussion, all the people together in the project were airing out their worries. Nude mods were something people were particularly worried about.
5234000	5240000	What's stronger in my mind is the fact that I don't want to limit people too much. It's a thing they've bought. It's their game now.
5241000	5247000	As far as the nude mods go, I don't think it's a good thing, but we're going to leave it to the moral sense of the players out there.
5250000	5253000	Well, they're going to definitely disappoint you.
5255000	5265000	Prepare for a letdown. But you know what? I look forward to Final Fantasy 15's release on PC. That is all I have to say.
5266000	5275000	That's right. 4K. Oh my god. This is good. Like, finally, gay pornography is becoming like a mainstream video game.
5276000	5281000	Something that not even Dream Daddy could accomplish, Final Fantasy 15 on PC is going to accomplish.
5282000	5286000	And you know what? Even if you're not into do-it-yourself, be happy for me at least.
5287000	5289000	I fully support this. I can't wait to see.
5290000	5297000	There are some ladies, like unfortunately one of Final Fantasy 15's problems is that the ladies aren't really, you know, they're hardly there.
5298000	5299000	But there are some strong female.
5300000	5301000	I'm sure Sydney will be completely tastefully handled.
5302000	5303000	Of course tastefully, of course.
5304000	5314000	I fully expect to see Macho Man Randy Savage and Thomas the Tank Engine make their appearances on the platform.
5314000	5320000	Yes, yes. For folks that could do without the nude mods, there will always be the over-the-fucking-top shit.
5321000	5325000	I hope we can mod the summons. Please hope the guy that we can mod the summons, because that's going to be amazing.
5326000	5328000	DarkSockro, will you describe the motion that you were making with your hand just now?
5329000	5330000	The jerking off motion.
5331000	5335000	That's right. That's what I'll be doing to Final Fantasy 15 on PC. Thank you for filling in with the visual.
5336000	5338000	The other motion was the whoopty shit motion.
5339000	5340000	Whatever.
5341000	5342000	Anyway.
5343000	5348000	If it's on a non-locked device, people are going to figure out how to put butts in it. Butts and dick.
5349000	5353000	Yeah. Even if it was locked down, they would find a way to put butts.
5354000	5356000	Even if they have to have a butt sitting on it.
5357000	5358000	Butts will find a way.
5359000	5361000	We should have a little chime and play butts.
5364000	5366000	I think it's a butt now.
5369000	5372000	It really seems to be big and red.
5374000	5377000	Somehow, somewhere, butts will find a way.
5378000	5379000	Alright.
5380000	5382000	I was trying to find the more you know, the little chimes.
5383000	5386000	You must be new here. Let me introduce you to Rule 34.
5388000	5389000	Anyway.
5390000	5392000	Even all these jokes about nude mods and stuff aside,
5393000	5398000	I still think Final Fantasy 15 is somewhere in the middle of the pack for the series for me.
5399000	5402000	I think a lot of it was rushed. Some of my issues with that. They cut a lot of corners.
5403000	5405000	Yes. A game that was in development for as many years as it was, was rushed.
5406000	5408000	Because the real development didn't happen until the last two years.
5409000	5415000	That's the other thing too. Hopefully with this, one of the things you get with Skyrim and stuff is people fixing the game.
5416000	5418000	I kind of look forward to a lot of that.
5419000	5421000	I think I probably will double dip on this game on PC.
5422000	5423000	I think I will too.
5424000	5426000	Hopefully I have the appropriate video card at that time.
5427000	5431000	Hopefully it's optimized and hopefully, I don't think it was one of our stories,
5432000	5436000	but hopefully it's not 170 gigabytes to download this shit.
5437000	5439000	Well, but if it's 4K textures, that wouldn't...
5440000	5442000	That's unexcusable. That's fucking too much.
5443000	5445000	Final Fantasy 13 on PC is 60...
5445000	5449000	Okay, fine. That's fine. Give me the option then to download it optionally.
5450000	5455000	I'm not running 4K. I don't want to download 160 gigabytes worth of shit I'm not using.
5456000	5458000	Have like a 4K pack that you can download.
5459000	5461000	What resolution are you planning to run this shit at?
5462000	5463000	Download accordingly.
5464000	5466000	And Dark Tetsuya in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,
5467000	5469000	I think they came out and said that was a typo or otherwise incorrect.
5470000	5472000	Well, they just said that we haven't determined the size yet, which means,
5472000	5474000	where did that information come from? So yeah.
5475000	5478000	I'm just... Guys, 4K Final Fantasy game, it's...
5479000	5481000	Remember, Final Fantasy 13, which doesn't even support 4K.
5482000	5483000	60 gigs on PC.
5484000	5486000	So when I saw that 180 gig number, I was like, okay, that makes sense.
5487000	5490000	But I mean, this is why a lot of hard drives are like three and four terabytes now.
5491000	5496000	And they're even, you know, the standard size drive in a console now is pretty much up to one...
5497000	5498000	Well, unless you're Nintendo, but that's a whole other story.
5499000	5500000	But now it's up to a terabyte, right?
5500000	5501000	What does the Xbox One X come with?
5502000	5503000	500 gigs or a terabyte.
5504000	5505000	That's it? Or a terabyte.
5506000	5507000	A lot of the newer ones have terabytes.
5508000	5511000	A lot of them are terrible. Like my Xbox One brick, I have the VHS kind, is a terabyte.
5512000	5513000	I mean, because I didn't buy the very first one.
5514000	5516000	I bought... I don't remember when I bought my Xbox One.
5517000	5518000	It was right around Horizon 3 or something. I don't know.
5519000	5522000	But I bought like a little later down the line and they had a terabyte model out.
5523000	5526000	I think Best Buy was running some deal where you bought an Xbox One and you got a game free.
5527000	5529000	And it was for Forza Horizon that I bought.
5530000	5532000	Maybe it was two, not three, actually.
5533000	5535000	My memory ain't doing so well this day and age.
5536000	5537000	Anyway.
5538000	5541000	But now that's why one terabyte is starting to become the standard.
5542000	5543000	Anyway.
5544000	5546000	Let's take a trip down memory lane, shall we?
5547000	5551000	We're going to go back to a simpler time when there was no fucking 4K.
5552000	5558000	These consoles couldn't even hold probably three megabytes, let alone 180 gigabytes.
5558000	5562000	4K was more like, you know, the download bit rate that you would get with this stuff.
5563000	5564000	Yes. Perfect.
5565000	5566000	It's the classic game of the week.
5567000	5573000	But once a month, Dark Sakura dips into the archive of consoles and picks a classic console of the month.
5574000	5575000	I'm switching it up in this bitch.
5576000	5577000	Is this really a classic, though?
5578000	5581000	Well, it could be a classic in the same way like a turd is.
5581000	5588000	Sometimes we feature classic games because they were notable for other reasons.
5589000	5591000	And I think this console is no different.
5592000	5593000	A turd.
5594000	5595000	It's a post-taco turd.
5596000	5599000	Ten years older or more, what is the classic console of the month?
5600000	5601000	The Nokia N-Gage.
5602000	5603000	Speaking of taco turds.
5605000	5609000	The nickname Tacophone made it into the wiki.
5609000	5611000	That's how prevalent the name was.
5612000	5617000	So because I could find no good music for it, in the background we'll be listening to the dance of the sugar plum fairy.
5618000	5619000	Why?
5620000	5621000	Because reasons.
5622000	5623000	Alright.
5625000	5626000	It's your segment.
5628000	5638000	Anyway, the N-Gage was a PDA that was both cell phone and a handheld game device.
5639000	5640000	I was about to say a ham sandwich.
5641000	5643000	Ew. Ham is gross.
5644000	5649000	It was announced on the 4th of November 2002 and released October 7, 2003.
5650000	5651000	And yes, Dan and I both had one.
5652000	5653000	It was terrible.
5654000	5656000	That means the N-Gage is old enough to be in high school.
5657000	5658000	It probably failed.
5659000	5660000	Kindergarten.
5661000	5662000	Several times.
5663000	5668000	It's going to be that ten year old that's in, not ten year old, it's going to be the thirteen year old that's in first grade.
5669000	5670000	Eating crayons.
5671000	5683000	Anyway, the N-Gage, it's intent was to, because it had the mobile phone functionality added to it, it was supposed to try to get a one up over the Game Boy Advance.
5683000	5690000	It kind of is almost the same shape, but smaller screen, but it was a full color screen.
5691000	5693000	Backlit as well, if I recall correctly.
5694000	5702000	So, it was re-imaged as the N-Gage QD in 2004 to redesign it.
5703000	5711000	It was supposed to fix a bunch of the design problems, but it only sold two million units in two years.
5711000	5715000	It was pretty much a big commercial failure.
5716000	5724000	It was discontinued in 2005, and Nokia moved the gaming aspect of it to their Series 60 smartphones.
5725000	5729000	Which was then called the N-Gage Platform, or N-Gage 2.0 in 2007.
5730000	5734000	So N-Gage in itself was rebranded into a service.
5734000	5750000	But, pretty much, it was meant that you could play on it instead of using cables, you could use Bluetooth or the internet for the N-Gage Arena service to play online.
5751000	5755000	It had MP3 and real audio video playback, and of course it had PDA functions.
5756000	5758000	You know, like the Palm Pilots back in the day.
5759000	5763000	It was three hundred bucks when it came out, so it wasn't very popular for price.
5764000	5770000	And it was outsold by the Game Boy Advance a hundred to one, just think about that right now.
5773000	5781000	And then, basically, places like GameStop and Electronics Boutique started giving like a hundred dollar rebates back on the price.
5782000	5793000	But it was also, you know, like I said, it was also a cellphone, it did not have an integrated camera, it was running the Symbian OS 6.1.
5794000	5799000	And, it wasn't really bad for what it was as a PDA.
5802000	5806000	However, like, the games were a pain in the ass to get in them.
5806000	5810000	And I remember that, Rob, did you go to that E3 when they had the whole N-Gage section?
5811000	5812000	I did.
5813000	5816000	And I brought out my N-Gage, and the person there was like, oh my god, you have one!
5817000	5822000	And there was no one over there, okay? I felt so sorry for the poor Nokia rep.
5824000	5831000	It did have a couple of good games that came out on it, like Pocket Kingdom Own the World got some good reviews,
5832000	5841000	Pathway to Glory was a self-published game, and it came out pretty well, but most of the games just were not very good.
5842000	5851000	You had to, like, pull out like a little plastic sleeve to be able to change the games in and out, and it just wasn't very good.
5852000	5859000	It didn't sell great, the games didn't look all that great, it just wasn't super good.
5859000	5867000	I mean, so since then, like, the games that came out on it were kind of, you know, there were some big titles.
5868000	5877000	I mean, we had Super Monkey Ball, we had Puyo Pop, we had Puzzle Bobble Versus, Rayman 3, Sega Rally came out in Australia and Brazil.
5878000	5888000	It was a Sonic game, wasn't very good, Bomberman, the Asphalt series, Ashen, Catan, Civ 2, Rob, I know you like your Civ.
5889000	5893000	It was absolutely not good on that system, I played it at that E3 and I was depressed.
5894000	5904000	Pandemonium came out, the two X-Men Legends games came out, Virtual Cop was created but never released.
5905000	5914000	It was Tomb Raider, Tony Hawk's Proskater, which I had that one, The Sims Busted Out, I mean, it had games that could have been really good, but it just didn't happen.
5914000	5924000	You know, it was at best ambitious, and at worst, what it actually was.
5925000	5933000	It was just, and on top of that too, with the shape of the phone, you know, it was called the Taco Phone for a reason, but it was really hard to talk and hear on it.
5934000	5938000	You know, the design just was really poorly executed, at least for that first model.
5939000	5942000	I'm sorry, I'm laughing at this shade in our chatroom from our pal Bobby Black Wolf.
5943000	5946000	The Engage booth was a great place to chill when you got claustrophobic.
5947000	5949000	That's pretty much why I think we went there.
5950000	5958000	But it was just nice seeing that momentary glow when I pulled out my Engage, like, oh my god, a human who bought one.
5959000	5960000	Like, well, technically.
5962000	5963000	It was free, but okay.
5963000	5973000	Okay. And I had to keep switching out my Sim between the Engage and my, what did I have at the time, an Ericsson?
5974000	5976000	So here's the thing I've got to bring up, though.
5977000	5986000	So it's much shit as we gave the Engage at the time for being a cell phone and a gaming platform, and not really doing either one of them particularly well.
5986000	5990000	This thing was out, what, three years before the very first iPhone?
5991000	6001000	And then, of course, Androids around the same time, which, like, now you think about gaming and mobile, and that's like the way a lot of people game exclusively.
6002000	6006000	So it's kind of, you know, you almost want to say, oh, is the Engage ahead of its time in that way?
6007000	6009000	But then you think about that horrible design.
6009000	6017000	And one place where Apple really, you know, got them was that the design of that original iPhone was pretty fucking sweet.
6018000	6019000	To their credit, at least they had buttons.
6020000	6021000	I had one right when they came out.
6022000	6029000	So yeah, at that time, my cell phone that I was using regularly was a Sony Ericsson that had that stupid little camera attachment.
6030000	6035000	I went through, I had two Sony Ericksons because I liked them so much. Remember my little attachments?
6036000	6037000	Yeah, I remember that thing, yeah.
6037000	6043000	So just trying to put it in the perspective of what else was out at the time. It was before the Razer.
6044000	6045000	So there you go.
6046000	6048000	There it is. All right, your classic console of the month.
6049000	6050000	Classic turd of the month.
6051000	6054000	Classic console of the month. The Engage.
6055000	6056000	You're the one who put it on my list.
6057000	6060000	Did I? Oh yeah, because we were brainstorming back in January.
6061000	6062000	And then you did Engage.
6063000	6065000	Because I was like, oh, it's over 10 years old.
6065000	6067000	I'm like, watch me fucking do it.
6068000	6069000	Watch me, hoe.
6070000	6072000	It'll be dead. It's already been gotten.
6073000	6077000	All right, we are going to take a break though, but don't go anywhere. There is plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come.
6078000	6081000	So stay tuned when we come back with part B right after this quick break.
6081000	6095000	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio. Live tonight with episode number 698 of our show already in progress.
6096000	6100000	Our last show really for the month because we won't be here next week.
6101000	6106000	Because again, Dragon Con is going on next weekend, which actually technically I think is September anyway.
6106000	6110000	But my point is we're not here next week, so this show is going to have to do you for two weeks.
6111000	6116000	And we'll be back with 699 the day before Loki's birthday on September 10th.
6117000	6118000	You know what we're missing too?
6119000	6120000	What's that? On the first.
6121000	6123000	What happened on the first 12 years ago?
6124000	6125000	You and Dan getting married, right?
6126000	6127000	Yes.
6128000	6132000	God, it's hard enough to remember anniversaries. You want me to remember yours?
6133000	6134000	Right. On top of everything.
6134000	6135000	Because mine's important.
6136000	6143000	But also I was thinking about it and it's next January. I will have been living in California for 20 years.
6144000	6149000	Not half of my life yet, you know, at that point, but still kind of crazy to think about it.
6150000	6151000	Yeah, for sure. For sure.
6152000	6159000	Anyway, I do want to of course give a shout out to our Discord because you can join our Discord server at vognetwork.com slash Discord.
6159000	6164000	And you guys submit stories throughout the week, which is awesome. And you know, some of them you're probably already hearing on tonight's show.
6165000	6169000	But another thing I want to bring up because this was something that had a lot of people's attention earlier this week.
6170000	6173000	On Monday, there were a lot of people that had eclipse fever going on.
6174000	6175000	Oh, that was this week, yes.
6176000	6180000	Yeah, that was Monday. I know, it feels like a lifetime ago with everything that's gone on in the world since then.
6181000	6188000	But something that was actually submitted in Discord was that there was a Reddit user out there who photographed the eclipse with a Game Boy camera.
6189000	6192000	That's right, digging out their Game Boy camera to record the occasion.
6193000	6201000	And they actually have this little print that they did of the eclipse that they printed from their Game Boy camera, which I think is hilarious.
6202000	6209000	So there it is. And the photo photographer who took that picture says, I should still be shooting Game Boy camera photos in 2024.
6210000	6214000	So, you know, there's still love. It looks like a dragon's eye is what that picture looks like there.
6215000	6218000	That whole little, you know, again, it's a radio show, so describing pictures is the best thing.
6219000	6221000	How long before we get the Game Boy Classic Mini?
6222000	6227000	You know, that seems like a more logical next step than the Nintendo 64.
6228000	6229000	Yeah.
6230000	6233000	Especially because, you know, the new 3DSs don't really play the classic Game Boy games anymore.
6234000	6236000	Well, they were on Virtual Console. Very limited selection was.
6237000	6238000	What's a Virtual Console?
6239000	6248000	Yeah, right, exactly. But, shoot, if Nintendo can still have the license to do it, you would need to have Nintendo's version of Tetris for that to really be successful.
6249000	6253000	Although they did a, I mean, to be fair, they did a far better version of Tetris later on.
6254000	6257000	They did it on the, was it the regular DS? I think it was.
6258000	6262000	They had a, like Tetris DS, I think was the game. And it was great.
6263000	6265000	If you never checked that one out, that was probably, that was a way better version of Tetris.
6266000	6269000	Because, you know, the original Tetris on Game Boy was limited to the whole black and white.
6270000	6277000	It was very, you know, it was rudimentary, but obviously at that time, it was a totally time-sucking game at that time.
6277000	6284000	But I think they really improved the formula on Tetris DS. Nintendo did make really, really good Tetris games, for what it's worth.
6285000	6288000	But I was going to ask quickly, the Eclipse, did any of you guys bother to watch it?
6289000	6290000	Yeah.
6291000	6295000	But not like the idiot in Washington, looking directly at it.
6296000	6297000	What a fucking dumb shit.
6297000	6304000	Yeah, I honestly, since I was busy teaching, I only got to see, I walked out to the parking lot and a bunch of people were looking at it.
6305000	6309000	And this one guy had a big strip of glass, special glass or whatever. So he was just passing it around.
6310000	6313000	And everybody would just take a second to like look through the strip at the sun. Oh yeah. So that's what I did.
6314000	6317000	I looked through the strip at the sun for like half a second. I'm like, hmm, neat. Next person.
6318000	6321000	I took some pictures through my glasses, but they didn't come out quite right.
6322000	6324000	But what happened is the lens flare was crescent shaped.
6325000	6326000	Yeah.
6327000	6337000	And so that was really neat. So I've got, I put those around. I think I've got like some on my, on my, whatever that thing with the pictures, Instagram.
6338000	6343000	I didn't bother taking pictures because I knew everybody else in the fucking world would be taking pictures.
6344000	6345000	And then NASA did better pictures than everyone, of course.
6346000	6352000	It's, it's why I don't take pictures at concerts anymore. Why bother taking pictures at, well, I might take a selfie before it starts or something,
6352000	6358000	but I don't bother taking pictures at concerts anymore because I can go onto YouTube three hours after it's over and relive the whole thing.
6359000	6362000	So why bother? That's my attitude anyway. Maybe I'm just old.
6363000	6364000	Loki, did you bother with the eclipse at all?
6365000	6375000	Um, we just looked out, you know, at it, you know, I had a thing, an app on my or a page on my phone that told me like when the, you know, the, um, what was the climax of it was.
6376000	6378000	And so I went right there and looked at it like at 10 30 or whenever it was.
6378000	6382000	Yeah. It was, it was kind of cool to see how cold they got. It was kind of neat, Neil, in that sense.
6383000	6389000	Yeah. Cause I did like how it was like darker outside area. And obviously we weren't even in, we were what's 60% totality.
6390000	6391000	We were even 80 or something. It was pretty good.
6392000	6394000	But we weren't in the totality zone, but still it got, it definitely got dark.
6395000	6397000	Like, yeah, Bobby, you know, had a pretty good time with that.
6398000	6400000	Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. I saw those pictures. It looked like they had a good time out there.
6401000	6405000	So that was, I mean, yeah, I would love to be in a total, um, eclipse area, but unfortunately it's, you know,
6405000	6409000	Well, you'll get your chance in 2024. Was it, was it 2024?
6410000	6411000	I think we're going to have to travel though for that.
6412000	6421000	Yes. You'd have to travel for that. You'd have to go to, uh, I think, um, I think it's like the, the Southeast part of Texas on up through like, you know, Michigan.
6422000	6425000	Yeah. I'm just not going to do that.
6426000	6434000	Fine. All right. Oh, thank you. Bobby Black Wolf says Texas to Indiana is what it is. It's 2024. So there would be some traveling involved.
6435000	6440000	Anyway, it's an excuse for me to go back to Chicago. Indiana's right next to Chicago. Take a little road trip.
6441000	6444000	I bet some of my Chicago buddies would want to go see the totality eclipse. It would be fun.
6445000	6449000	All right. Anyhow, enough science talk, even though you can never really have enough science talk.
6450000	6452000	Let's get to some rapid fire news. Loki.
6452000	6464000	So, um, we may remember all these wonderful VR titles that were announced during, um, the whole, you know, Bethesda E3 event that they streamed online.
6465000	6472000	Well, um, so we've got first off, um, Skyrim VR for the PlayStation VR coming out November 17th.
6473000	6483000	Doom VFR on the PlayStation VR and the HTC Vive on December 1st. And finally, Fallout 4 VR on the Vive on December 12th.
6484000	6492000	And that was coming out of QuakeCon 2017, those dates. I am looking forward to Skyrim VR. I will buy that game a million times apparently.
6492000	6497000	Yes, it's your Mass Effect. It's fine. Everybody's got their thing.
6498000	6499000	It's a time sink. What can I say?
6500000	6501000	Fine. Everybody's got their thing.
6502000	6508000	Um, and then, so, this is kind of cool. A new character got announced for Injustice 2.
6509000	6518000	And, uh, probably one of my favorite characters out of the whole DC Comics realm, which was, um, Hellboy is going to be coming to Injustice.
6518000	6525000	They don't think they've announced a date yet for that. Um, let's see here. Oh, September 12th.
6526000	6531000	And it's going to be, um, available, I guess, when Fighter Pack 2 goes on sale.
6532000	6533000	Nice.
6534000	6539000	And so with that, it looks like Raiden's in there and I'm not sure who the other character is.
6540000	6542000	Uh, the Adam.
6544000	6547000	I just want to check out Injustice 2.
6548000	6549000	Yeah.
6549000	6552000	Netherrealm makes good fighting games. I mean, the Mortal Kombat games, the first Injustice was good.
6552000	6553000	They do.
6553000	6558000	So I need to check it out. I just, you know, it's one of those things, I'll get around to it one of these days if I can tear myself away from the MMO.
6558000	6561000	Oh, I'm sorry. He is Dark Horse. That's right. He was in DC.
6561000	6562000	Yeah.
6562000	6563000	But, whatever. Who cares? Hellboy's awesome.
6563000	6564000	Alright.
6565000	6575000	Uh, moving on. Uh, Horizon Zero Dawn got a new patch this week, uh, where they patched in a mode to make the game more accessible to our pal Bobby Blackwolf.
6575000	6585000	That's right. An easy mode was put into the game. And, uh, if you don't know the long running inside joke, it's that, uh, when, um, uh, what was it? Borderlands 2 came out.
6585000	6589000	The Technomancer, Techromancer was the class.
6589000	6596000	Yes. They, they, they made a, a big faux pas when they were talking about BFF mode and one of the devs kind of put their foot in their mouth.
6596000	6602000	And, uh, Bobby had the devs on his show at one point a long time ago and he, he coined the new phrase Blackwolf Friends Forever mode.
6602000	6609000	So now we joke. Because Bobby Blackwolf is fine. He's not going to take offense if we, at least I don't think he does. If he does get to take offense, he needs to let me know so I stop making the joke.
6609000	6615000	But, um, uh, if, uh, you know, if, if we, we can always say that the easy modes are always for Bobby Blackwolf.
6615000	6621000	So we don't have to say that they're for a certain gender or for a certain thing. We say the easy modes for Bobby Blackwolf.
6621000	6629000	So, uh, Horizon Zero Dawn and, and Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I love the joke and all the easy modes for me. So there you go.
6629000	6635000	So if you, you need to, um, point that an easy mode was put in a game for somebody, you say it's for Bobby Blackwolf.
6635000	6646000	So, uh, Horizon Zero Dawn got its, uh, Bobby Blackwolf mode this week, uh, and, uh, this new story difficulty will boost damage and reduce enemy damage considerably.
6646000	6654000	So I think it's a way that you can kind of play through the game and experience the story without having to worry about, like, actually dying.
6654000	6663000	Which, you know what, a lot of story-based games kind of do this now and, you know, like Mass Effect, you know, the, the easy mode in Mass Effect is pretty fucking easy.
6663000	6668000	Especially if you play, like, in two and three, if you play an Engineer, your little AI will do it all for you.
6668000	6674000	You really don't have to do a damn thing. So, but, you know, and for some people that takes the thrill out of the game.
6674000	6680000	But guess what? You get choice. That's the great part about it. You get choice. If you want to just have the AI do it for you, fine.
6680000	6686000	If not, you can, um, have that challenge. There you go. Bobby Blackwolf mode, now available in Horizon Zero Dawn.
6686000	6695000	Um, also, this is really cool, uh, Rocket League, of course, is bound for the Switch, uh, which may be a game I end up double-dipping on, who knows.
6695000	6703000	Uh, some sweet cars are gonna be in this. Super Mario and Metroid themed battle cars are coming to the game. Oh, which reminds me.
6703000	6714000	So I pre-ordered the, uh, Nintendo 3DS New XL with Samus on it. I like how you're shaking your head, like, the whole, like, we knew we were gonna lose you to that, yep.
6714000	6725000	We knew that was gonna happen. This is why they get away with what they do. It really is. It really is. Because you guys, you're just like, I'm not doing it, I'm not gonna buy that because I'm gonna put my foot down.
6725000	6733000	What, it's Metroid themed? They changed the outside to look like Metroid? Alright, I'm going in.
6733000	6747000	Read me, drag me, I deserve it, I deserve it. So that's, but yes, I pre-ordered one. Because I want, but I also want to reward when they fucking recognize Metroid, which is a nice change of pace for the company.
6747000	6756000	So, there you go. Anyway, Mario NSR, Luigi NSR, and Samus' Gunship will be, uh, free and unlockable in the game at launch.
6756000	6768000	But what's interesting about it, now, if I remember right, the Switch, the Xbox, and the PC will all be cross-play because Sony is, you know, pouting in the corner, they, they, you know, that whole thing.
6768000	6776000	So, but the other systems are all cross-play. So what happens if I have the Mario car and I'm on Microsoft's platform? Does Microsoft allow that skin to come through?
6776000	6784000	Or will the skin, since it is just the skin, will it just not load and just be like a red car or something? I wonder if, I'm curious about how that will work.
6784000	6794000	But at the same time, I mean, it's not like Microsoft doesn't fucking know who Mario is and is, you know, I don't think they're really gonna care.
6794000	6800000	There's a part of me that says they're not gonna care if Mario is on their console. They're actually gonna be excited, like, ooh, Mario's on Xbox.
6800000	6804000	I don't think they would care. You know who would care? Nintendo.
6804000	6805000	Maybe.
6805000	6809000	Nintendo cares about its customers and it cares about its IP.
6809000	6817000	Maybe. Maybe. Alright. Well, anyway, um, let's move on. Dark Soccer, you have some stories for us, right?
6817000	6821000	Everything I care about is Dragon Ball. Right now.
6822000	6831000	Um, so just one of the, you know, they're putting in a lot of attacks that were prevalent in the anime and manga into Dragon Ball FighterZ.
6831000	6842000	But the big one, and this is actually kind of notable, is that they put in, because one of the new characters that they announced in the current beta is Jirokugo, number 16.
6842000	6849000	And he's got a self-destruct attack that basically leaves him with like one sliver of life that it's almost an insta-kill.
6849000	6854000	It's actually pretty, pretty neat to watch it. The animation is fully perfect with the series.
6854000	6870000	But, um, with that, the other playables right now that they've added in for the current beta is, uh, they have Krillin Piccolo, um, Future Trunks is available, uh, Jirohachigo, and actually Junanago is like an assist for her.
6870000	6874000	And, um, and Jirokugo, so.
6874000	6886000	Um, and, guess what? The beta sign-ups are open. They're open! I've, I may have signed up under every email that I have, because I went in a lot.
6886000	6893000	Um, but yeah, you can go on the Bandai Namco page and sign up. So, do it.
6893000	6902000	But the session is going to be, um, September 16th through September 18th. Go play. Go do. And then let me in.
6903000	6906000	That's how I feel about the Dissidia.
6906000	6907000	Let the right one in.
6907000	6912000	That's how I feel about the Final Fantasy Dissidia beta. Like, I was like, when did, like, all my friends started tweeting,
6912000	6916000	Oh, I got in the beta. I got in the beta. And I was like, when did the fucking sign-ups happen for that beta?
6916000	6921000	But it was during the weeks that I was away from things, um, that we referenced a couple weeks ago.
6921000	6927000	Um, and so I guess I, I just missed that whole thing. So I tried to apply for a beta code late, but I didn't get one.
6927000	6933000	But some of my friends are saying it wasn't very good. So I'm a little, this concerns me type of thing.
6933000	6939000	So, uh, we'll see. I don't know. I don't know. I still want to try to play it myself, but, um, you know.
6939000	6947000	Anyway, um, moving on. Let's get to some release dates for this week and travel around the world and check out what's coming out in stores.
6947000	6952000	How about the U.S. coming up on this Labor Day weekend? Do we have anything right before Labor Day?
6952000	6959000	Yeah, we actually do have quite a busy week. So starting things off, we have Absolver on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6959000	6967000	Ark Survival Evolved on PC, Mac and Linux, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, I'm assuming coming out of early access on the PC platforms.
6967000	6975000	Everybody's Golf on PlayStation 4. Hello Neighbor on PC and Xbox One.
6976000	6987000	Mario and Rabbids Kingdom Battle on Nintendo Switch. Abduction on PlayStation 4. Pillars of Eternity Complete Edition on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6987000	6997000	ReCore Definitive Edition on PC and Xbox One. Redout on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Sonic Mania on PC.
6997000	7008000	Warriors All-Stars on PlayStation 4 and PC. Windjammers on PlayStation 4 and Vita and Yakuza Kiwami on PlayStation 4.
7008000	7021000	X-Morph Defense on PC and PlayStation 4. Ys 7 on PC. Life is Strange Before the Storm, Episode 1 on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
7022000	7031000	Resident Evil Revelations on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. And finally, Xenia on PC.
7031000	7033000	That's a really busy week.
7033000	7036000	Yep, it's getting in the fourth quarter already.
7036000	7043000	I was going to say, believe it or not, here we go. I imagine September will be a little quiet, but then once we start to get into October...
7043000	7045000	September's going to be pretty noisy.
7045000	7047000	September's pretty packed.
7048000	7053000	Well, the first week in September is not too bad, I guess.
7053000	7057000	Yeah, but then October is going to start to bring what Mario Odyssey is October.
7057000	7060000	The first true week in September you only have Destiny 2.
7060000	7062000	Well, that's a pretty big deal.
7062000	7068000	It's going to just start to ramp up through the end of the year, so here we go. Hold on to your butts.
7068000	7073000	How about Japan? It's not as busy of a week in Japan, but still, pretty busy week.
7073000	7081000	Looks like their big release this week on the PlayStation 4, they have a game called Yoronunai Kuni 2 Shingetsu no Hayayome.
7081000	7083000	That is an irregular and a premium box.
7083000	7091000	I'm not sure what this game is. I don't know much about it, but I do see the cover is two girls that are like, you know, look like they're like vampire hunters.
7091000	7095000	There's nothing to me on the cover, but they have a whole little talk about...
7096000	7100000	Aluche has been resurrected by the Kyria as an artificial half-demon.
7100000	7107000	According to the researchers, Liliana had already disappeared when they found her and said to likely be in the abandoned city in order to recover the stolen Liliana.
7107000	7113000	The resurrected Aluche heads for the abandoned city, taking along the demon power she does not desire within her.
7113000	7117000	So it's, you know, girls being possessed by demons. It's one of those types of games.
7117000	7126000	So you can check that out on the PlayStation 4. That is a Tecmo game, or not Tecmo, um, Koei Tecmo, I think, may have done that.
7126000	7134000	Let's see, more games that are out this week in Japan. New, Minna no Golf, so the, you know, Everybody's Golf series in Japan gets its release there.
7134000	7140000	Ys Origins is out, I'm sorry, that is an Asia region release, but still worth noting.
7140000	7145000	And also in Japan, Biohazard Revelations Unveiled Edition is out this week.
7145000	7156000	So that is all on the PlayStation 4. The PlayStation Vita also gets that Yoro no Naikuni 2, as well as a game called Crank In, in regular and limited edition.
7156000	7165000	That is out on the PlayStation Vita this week. And on the Switch this week, that same Yoro no Naikuni 2 is also on the Switch.
7165000	7174000	So, uh, you can get that. Or you can get some Mario Kart 8 Joy-Cons in Mario and Luigi. I think those are just, oh, it's the wheels.
7174000	7179000	It's not the actual Joy-Cons, it's just the silly little steering wheels, um, for those that need them.
7179000	7182000	Although, I don't know people that actually play with those anymore.
7182000	7187000	Hey, the 3DS hasn't slowed down on releases. They still are getting a couple releases this week.
7188000	7201000	Seikaiju 2 Fuiji No Dungeon 2 is one game that's coming out this week, as well as a game called Atante Jinjuuji Saburo Ghost of the Dusk is also out in Japan this week.
7201000	7205000	So, um, quite a few releases there as well. How about the UK, DarkSakura?
7205000	7227000	Oh, just a few things. We have on the 29th, Absolver for PlayStation 4 and PC, Fishing Planet for PC, Killing Floor 2 for the Xbox-y stuff, Windjammers for PS4 and Vita and all of the Sony things.
7228000	7239000	Um, X-Com 2, War of the Chosen for PlayStation 4, X-Bone and PC. On the 30th, we have Sunless Skies for Mac and PC. And that's it.
7239000	7245000	Alright. Thank you for that trip around the world, and hopefully there's some games that you're excited to play this week.
7245000	7253000	Well, every week we open up our mailbag for you guys to send us emails. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to do it.
7253000	7260000	And DarkSakura's gonna dive in the mailbag and pick out the emails that she thinks are worthy of reading on the show tonight.
7260000	7262000	DarkSakura! Who emailed us?
7262000	7270000	First email. Hello Skye, DarkSakura and Loki. Martin the Belgian here. That's like his title now, Martin the Belgian.
7270000	7271000	That's right.
7271000	7281000	I wanted to comment on your story last week about online memberships on consoles. I have to agree with Loki's rant. Paying for online on consoles is really just a cash grab.
7281000	7288000	Sure servers cost money, but they do on PC as well, where paying for online play is unheard of.
7288000	7295000	I'm letting my PS Plus membership expire because I plan on- because I play all my online games on PC.
7295000	7304000	The only reason I'm keeping my PS4 is to play the PS4 exclusives, mostly single player. The free PS Plus games are just not worth the monthly cost.
7304000	7312000	On a brighter note, I will be attending DragonCon this year. Since I live in Atlanta and my friends are going, I don't really have an excuse not to.
7312000	7320000	I will be attending Saturday through Monday, and I am very much looking forward to some of the panels that Rob will be on Saturday afternoon in the podcast track.
7320000	7326000	Besides that, there are usually some interesting video game panels as well.
7326000	7333000	I remember you mentioning that there would be a way for VOG Network peoples to keep in touch with each other during DragonCon, but I could not find it on the website.
7333000	7335000	Would it be through Discord?
7335000	7344000	It is. Sorry. Yes, it is through Discord. Just go to vognetwork.com slash Discord.
7344000	7351000	You can find the link on the main VOG Network site. It's in the menu under participate, I think, is where it's located.
7351000	7358000	But most people, I've just been telling you, just go to vognetwork.com slash Discord, and you'll get the invite code right there.
7358000	7364000	But yeah, participate. It's also under that menu heading on the website.
7364000	7367000	DarkSoccer brought a gigantic fan with her to the studio.
7367000	7369000	Because it gets hot in here.
7369000	7371000	We do have a fan that's right there that's not plugged in.
7371000	7374000	I know. I'll go turn on the AC fan because I notice it's not running right now.
7374000	7375000	My arm works.
7375000	7377000	While DarkSoccer finishes this email.
7377000	7382000	Keep up the great show as always, and see you at DragonCon, Rob. All the best, Martin.
7382000	7385000	It'll be great to meet you at DragonCon. I'm excited. That's great.
7385000	7388000	I'll have one fan in the audience. Woohoo. That'd be nice.
7388000	7390000	I'll have one fan in my hand.
7390000	7391000	Woohoo.
7391000	7392000	Okay, moving on.
7392000	7398000	Hello, LR. I wanted to address the musings from last week's episode regarding Xbox Live and why it costs money.
7398000	7406000	As someone who has implemented Xbox Live features into his own games, I can tell you that doing so is ridiculously simple.
7406000	7411000	Adding matchmaking and setting up online play is as simple as just a few lines of code.
7411000	7415000	Adding support for leaderboards and achievements is similarly easy.
7415000	7419000	And the icing on the cake is that you don't need to run a server ever.
7419000	7428000	Instead, Microsoft runs huge server farms that handle all of the matchmaking as well as other network features for each and every game that supports Xbox Live.
7428000	7433000	From the 2005 Xbox 360 launch games all the way through this week's new releases.
7433000	7441000	Nobody pays for online play on PC because nobody provides those kinds of services on PC.
7441000	7444000	Want matchmaking in your PC game? You have to set it up yourself.
7444000	7449000	You either have to pay for a service or set up and run your own using your own servers.
7449000	7456000	That is complex. It's expensive. And if your game doesn't find an audience right out of the gate, it's a money pit.
7456000	7465000	At the time Microsoft put together the first version of Xbox Live, online play was not yet popular on game consoles. Bullshit.
7465000	7476000	I had my Dreamcast Ethernet adapter. And I wanted to use it. And they said, no. We played a lot of Quake. Anyway.
7476000	7484000	Yeah, that's true. Xbox wasn't the first. But they did make it. Xbox was centralized, I think is the key difference.
7484000	7488000	It was a console Y type of thing. If that makes sense.
7488000	7498000	Alright. I'm trying to see where it was. Microsoft was looking for a reason to convince developers to add it to all of their games.
7498000	7504000	This was the reason they didn't need to pay for it and the amount of effort required was as low as possible.
7504000	7510000	Microsoft instead chose to pass those costs on to gamers who had actually utilized the service.
7510000	7518000	As a direct result of the strategy, online play is now a standard feature in our console games today. And it continues to be so.
7518000	7524000	Does this still need to cost money in 2017? And does it still have to cost as much as it does?
7524000	7530000	I can't answer those questions. And yes, companies would be foolish to pass on money from customers who are willing to pay for something.
7530000	7544000	But that is why it's not free. And even though some Play Anywhere games will sport these features on PC with no extra charge, please remember that many, many, many more gamers will be playing these games on Xbox.
7544000	7552000	Which will easily subsidize the comparably few gamers playing them on super beefy PCs. Anyway, there it is.
7552000	7556000	And one other thing, Chemical Plant Zone is the best Zona Zona 2. Lies.
7556000	7564000	See, I speak the truth. Best music, best ambience, great speed, plus you even get those sweet helix-shaped ramps.
7564000	7577000	Fuck that underwater part at the end if you take too long. And fuck that bridge of death that can kill you without any warning right before the boss. But everything else about it is great. Yes, truth. Court is closed. Aaron, YYR.
7577000	7592000	And the things that you named are precisely why I hate the level. Because it's not enough to redeem the great parts of it. Like the helix ramps, which are pretty cool. The helix ramps are great. But I like the spinny ones in the first level.
7592000	7605000	I do want to thank YYR for that perspective and that email. I do still think that, you know, Microsoft could make some big moves by, you know, undercutting, you know, what PlayStation is charging, what Sony is charging by possibly even going free.
7605000	7615000	But, you know, I think it is interesting the things you bring up on the whole fact that it's easier, let's say, to put in your game on Xbox Live because of the way Xbox Live is set up than it is on PC.
7615000	7630000	But here's my crazy question. And I don't know if you know this, Loki, but then why would it be that EA, I mean, if Xbox is kind of running all that, then why is it that EA pulls support for their games notoriously early and then you can't play them online anymore?
7630000	7638000	I mean, it's because EA runs their own server thing and everything like that. But yet you still need Xbox Live to play on EA servers, right?
7638000	7655000	Yeah. And they do have matchmaking servers through Xbox Live and stuff. But I mean, here's the problem, though. It's like it's this. It's also like a perfect example would be the brand new Shadow of War game.
7655000	7668000	I watched a video this morning regarding that. So, Shadow of War is a game that's coming out that a lot of people were looking forward to that they decided that we're adding microtransactions and loot boxes into the single player portion of the game.
7668000	7680000	And you have to buy in game, you have to buy currency to do that. And it's not just cosmetics, it's actual things that you like orks that you can get in the game that you unlock through this as well.
7680000	7695000	And then now they also have a sponsorship deal that they're doing with Totino's Pizza Rolls. That they're making money from that. So they're making money from, and to be honest, the game that you're buying is not a full game because they have a season pass that's gonna be along with it.
7695000	7703000	So you're not, you're paying money for the season pass, you're paying money for the in game transactions, they're getting money from this marketing deal with Totino's Pizza Rolls.
7703000	7705000	And you're not even getting pizza rolls.
7705000	7712000	And all this shit for their game because they're saying, oh well our game is, we just can't be profitable without that stuff.
7712000	7721000	Same thing. Well, how did Sony do it all these years with all, how did these companies do it all this time on the Playstation 3 without charging for online?
7721000	7725000	Were they operating at a loss? Why even put your games on that platform then?
7725000	7735000	I think it's an excuse because they're making money from all sorts of shit that they're doing now that we just take for granted because this is just the world that we live in now.
7735000	7744000	And that's the problem. It's like, yes, I get it. Servers cost money. So does development for your game. So does marketing. Should I pay you extra money because you're marketing your game?
7744000	7750000	Should I pay you extra money because you wanted some better artists for your game? That's not fucking fair.
7751000	7757000	Charge more for your game then. Why should I have to pay for online?
7757000	7769000	The nickel and timing is getting a little extreme. Regardless, I appreciate the perspective from YYR even if I feel like it explains 80% of it to me and there's still some nebula in there.
7769000	7783000	I do feel at the end of the day, Microsoft could subsidize that cost through other means. Again, even when I pitched the idea on the show last week that Microsoft could really shake things up, I'm not expecting they're ever going to do it.
7783000	7789000	I don't think it's a realistic thing I'm proposing, but I'm just saying they would turn some fucking heads if they did it.
7789000	7793000	You know how they subsidize some stuff with that? You notice that in your-
7793000	7794000	Pizza rolls.
7794000	7805000	No, speaking of pizza rolls, you notice that in your little wonderful OS there, there's fucking advertisements. They're making money from those advertisements to subsidize that shit.
7805000	7816000	And yet the price of the online keeps going up. So don't- they don't need to be defended. They are a big company. They can handle this shit.
7816000	7834000	I don't understand why we have to pay for online still. We're making excuses for these publishers. Fuck that. Fuck making excuses for them. They are big fucking companies that do not need to be defended. Demand your fucking rights. We didn't pay for online before, why should we have to start paying for it now?
7834000	7838000	Alright, on that note, let's go to the next email. We have another email, right?
7838000	7839000	We do.
7839000	7840000	Alright, awesome.
7841000	7851000	Evening, OLR. Hope all is well. I just wanted to vent about the Xbox One X Scorpio and SNES Classic Edition. Simply put, both pre-order situations were just a clusterfuck.
7851000	7864000	Well, the Xbox One X not so much. After the Xbox Game- Games Rooms conference ended, I was successfully able to order- to secure a Scorpio pre-order. Now, you can't seem to find one anymore.
7864000	7871000	The pre-order window only lasted for a day, and all allocations were scooped up like Haagen Dazs. Nice plug.
7871000	7877000	And quick search on eBay shows the Xbox One X selling from $650 to $2,000. Damn.
7877000	7885000	The SNES Classic was just a crapshoot. With Best Buy and Amazon pre-orders starting in the middle of the night, many people found themselves shit out of luck.
7886000	7898000	I didn't receive my Amazon notifications that it was available, but somehow, thanks to Wario64, my son waking me up at 4 o'clock Eastern in the morning, I secured one for myself.
7898000	7909000	I just couldn't believe it myself. The situation was worse than the SNES Classic. Another eBay search shows that the system is selling between $250 to $300+.
7909000	7923000	Who is to blame? Is it Nintendo for always limiting stock? Is it the retailers that decided to sell the product in the dead of night? Is it in fucking scalpers who buy a lot of the product and leaves the average customer without any options?
7923000	7931000	I'd say it's all of them. It seems Nintendo isn't giving a shit anymore about what's going on while their customers are trying to figure out how to do it next week.
7931000	7942000	Cue Reggie Fils-Aime shrugging his shoulders. That deserves an FUs of the week slot. Well, we already had that out, so no.
7942000	7952000	Oh, this part's to me. Let's talk fighting games. Dragon Ball FighterZ is looking better and better. I hope you signed up to get into the beta. Fuck, yes, I tried.
7953000	7969000	I need this game now. I just learned of the newer characters that's in it. Android 16, Android 18 with 17. I'm just going to say Super Saijin Blue. Goku and Vegeta, Krillin and Piccolo.
7969000	7978000	In the series, it was called Super Saijin God, Super Saijin. It's repetitive, so I'll just say Super Saijin Blue.
7978000	7992000	Anyway, for example, if Android 18 does her level 3 super and is on the same team with Krillin, they both attack together. Krillin isn't on the team, then she does her super with Android 17 instead. Can't wait.
7993000	8002000	Been watching more Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite gameplay, and I'm pretty excited for it now. I wasn't due to the demo feeling super underwhelming. Now it's looking insane.
8002000	8014000	Lastly, whenever you get a chance, I highly recommend the Daigo the Beast Umehara fighting gamers manga. I was able to get a post-evo copy from Focus Attack, but it won't be available until November.
8014000	8027000	The manga chronicles his early years playing fighting games, and I didn't know he, and I think we're missing a verb here, so I'm just going to read it as, I didn't know he Vampire Savior using Jetta and Bishamon. Dude, Jetta's the best though.
8027000	8041000	Hopefully you three are doing well. I truly enjoy listening to you guys and can't thank you enough for providing me your thoughts and opinions with regards to today's state of video gaming. Take care and happy gaming. This is from Tristan.
8041000	8043000	Be careful with the fan, the noise is coming through.
8043000	8044000	Okay.
8044000	8045000	On the mics.
8045000	8049000	AKA needle crash. Well, they're just hearing my sass. That's my sass.
8049000	8050000	Thwarp.
8050000	8051000	Thwarp.
8051000	8061000	Thank you for that lovely comment at the end of the email. Even though I can't follow the Dragon Ball stuff the way Jamie does, I just, no disrespect, I just don't know the universe as well. But, um, I'm, I-
8061000	8063000	You're not going to hear it from me again when it's out.
8063000	8076000	Well, let me, let me put it this way. Even though I don't follow the universe as well, even I looked at that fighting game trailer and I was like, oh, that looks pretty sweet. Like, so who knows, maybe this could be the, the, uh, gateway or what have you.
8076000	8084000	Uh, and I think you succinctly sum up the, uh, Super Nintendo situation, even though I don't want to necessarily rehash that whole thing. Um, I think you succinctly sum that up.
8084000	8095000	Tigerclaw in chat says Darkstalker wants to play this Dragon Ball FighterZ game so bad. Maybe if she's really good at it, get in those fighting game tournaments and show them what a badass you are at Dragon Ball FighterZ. That's not gonna happen.
8095000	8098000	That's. Not. Gonna. Happen.
8098000	8099000	That's just not something that interests you, right?
8100000	8105000	Well, besides that, I can't play games like I used to because of the problems with my, with my wrist.
8105000	8106000	Oh, right.
8106000	8116000	Uh, playing for a prolonged period of time just makes it hurt. That's why right now I've been trying to fan myself with the left hand instead of the right.
8116000	8118000	Uh-huh.
8118000	8121000	That and the shade. The shade of it all.
8121000	8134000	That's a, um, good kind of like side question. Let's assume any type of physical disabilities or anything you want to say like that. Let's assume any type of like physical limitations weren't on the table. What game do you think you would want to try to play competitively?
8134000	8143000	Like, for example, on, um, you know, I had, I ran a show for a brief period called Pokestop Podcast with Shane and Shane talked about that he was interested in getting into competitive Pokemon play.
8143000	8149000	I don't, I, sadly, I don't think he really followed through on that this time. I think that might still be on his agenda, but that's a question for him.
8149000	8155000	Um, but you know, like is, is there a game that you would be interested in playing competitively if you kind of had that time?
8155000	8156000	No.
8156000	8157000	No, really?
8157000	8160000	The last game I tried to play competitively was Bust-A-Move 2.
8160000	8161000	Really?
8161000	8166000	At Anime Expo. I like played for like a fucking hour beating everybody.
8166000	8167000	Yeah.
8167000	8178000	And then I just goofed or something. No, it was the controller that I had, had a stuck button on it. Should I change the button after I lost, but whatever, or change the controller out?
8178000	8187000	Um, yeah, well, for me, I, you know, I did DDR for that hot minute competitively. Remember that one random ass tournament in the Bay Area? Was it like a high five or something?
8187000	8194000	I came in fourth in Perfect Attack and people were like, who's this guy? You know, kinda, that was kind of unexpected, I think at that point. So.
8194000	8197000	Remember Stomp to My Beat?
8197000	8200000	Yeah, that was, that was one of the huge tournaments where we did that.
8200000	8201000	It was.
8201000	8204000	That was where we tried to do Perfect Attack. You and I tried to compete in Perfect Attack.
8204000	8205000	And the glare on the screen was.
8205000	8213000	But it was the glare, the glare on the screen. We weren't prepared for it because the machine was outside in the sun and it's just like, we weren't prepared for it. And it just fucked us up.
8213000	8215000	Was that the one that ate at the break or whatever?
8215000	8217000	No, it was at Miggle.
8217000	8225000	Milpitas Golf Land. I don't think we knew you yet. We didn't really start to know you until OLR started. And this was before, or was it before OLR?
8225000	8227000	No, we did, um, Scat.
8229000	8233000	Yeah, no. When, when was Miggle? Was Miggle 2 before OLR? I think it was.
8233000	8234000	I think Miggle 2 was, yeah.
8234000	8238000	It was. That was the very first time I ever met Mel B's now wife.
8238000	8239000	Yeah.
8239000	8247000	And we, we clicked like that and they came on like the sixth episode of OLR. So I, I met them before OLR started. So yeah, Miggle 2 is before all that.
8247000	8248000	Yeah.
8248000	8251000	But anyway, wow, memories. Tell me really.
8251000	8261000	Uh, but what game would I compete in competitively if I could now? Um, God, I wish I was better at Overwatch. I'm just, I'm not good at first person shooters.
8261000	8263000	Overwatch makes me vomit.
8263000	8265000	I love, the characters are so well done though.
8265000	8266000	But it makes me motion sick.
8266000	8268000	Did you see that Mei comic though?
8268000	8275000	No, but it still makes me motion sick. That doesn't, the fun parts about the fandom have nothing to do with the fact that the game makes me fucking nauseous.
8275000	8280000	Yeah. Well maybe, well who knows? Maybe the universe will spawn a side game someday that won't be the same type of game. That would be kind of cool.
8280000	8282000	Maybe. Then it'll be worth playing.
8282000	8290000	Like Warcraft spawned World of Warcraft. You never know. There might be something that comes out of that. Um, Maloki, what would you play competitively if you could?
8290000	8297000	I don't know. I'd probably play something like Player Unknown Battlegrounds or something like that. I don't really know.
8297000	8303000	Actually, you know what? For me, I might almost say I almost would get back into DDR if I could.
8303000	8304000	Yeah, DDR I guess.
8304000	8312000	I think, you know, because I keep forgetting. There is still, like there's been a big renaissance in that whole scene because of round ones, because of Dave and Busters.
8312000	8318000	And now that there's Ace and there's these games that, you know, maybe we don't follow that scene as closely as we used to in the early days of this show.
8318000	8330000	But like it's still going and there are still tournaments and stuff and people like doing, and I think it would be hilarious if some damn near 40 year old dude got up there on stage and, you know, could once again get 4th place in Perfect Attack.
8330000	8335000	Now, I don't have the stamina that I used to, but you know, you never know. Someday.
8335000	8340000	So, you're never too old. That's my point. You're never too old.
8340000	8349000	Alright. Looking in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, sj100matt says, I'm sad nobody has said playing Uniracers competitively.
8349000	8351000	I don't think there's a competitive scene for that.
8351000	8352000	Let's see.
8352000	8354000	We'll speedrun all the games.
8354000	8360000	Actif says, I'd play Splatoon 2 competitively. And Actif says, I could also play Tetris. Oh, that's a very good one.
8360000	8368000	sj100matt says, I remember Rob was at the DDR tournament at 8 on the break. That was 12 plus years ago. Yes, that is true. That is very true.
8368000	8371000	Alright. Let's move on. Was that it for emails tonight?
8371000	8377000	Alright. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email in the future.
8377000	8379000	In the meantime, we're going to get through the last of our stories tonight.
8379000	8384000	And I'm going to apologize, you guys, as I mentioned earlier in the show because of kind of the hot mess going on.
8384000	8387000	I don't have Skype on. Well, I'll try one more time. Maybe it was temporary.
8387000	8389000	Let me try one more time, see if I can connect to Skype.
8389000	8391000	Nope. Peter's still being a bitch.
8391000	8393000	Peter says no.
8393000	8394000	What?
8394000	8395000	Peter says no.
8396000	8398000	So, unfortunately, I'm not going to have a Skype line tonight.
8398000	8403000	But what I will do towards the end of the show, we'll do an open Q&A.
8403000	8406000	We'll do an AMA in the chat room. Ask Orange Lounge, if you will.
8406000	8408000	But now the hip new term for it is AMA.
8408000	8410000	So, we're going to do an AMA in the chat room.
8410000	8412000	Nope. It's Ask Orange Lounge. We're classic.
8412000	8414000	Fine. We'll do an AOL.
8417000	8421000	You have to make the dial-up sounds. Hello. You've got questions.
8421000	8427000	Sorry. So, we're going to do an AOL segment at the end of the show instead of Skype line because Skype line is busted.
8427000	8431000	But hold off on those questions. We'll get to it in just a minute.
8431000	8432000	We've got some more stories first, though.
8432000	8433000	Loki.
8433000	8436000	Yes. Who says that Comcast is not good for anything?
8436000	8444000	But, apparently, if you want to get into the Call of Duty World War II beta, you can do that if you're an Xfinity customer.
8444000	8451000	So, you go to xfinity.com slash call of duty between August 31st and August 31st.
8451000	8455000	You put your account number in there and they'll give you a code or they'll send you a code.
8455000	8463000	So, I just did that today and actually they're going to be sending me one. It's apparently in September.
8463000	8467000	So, September 1st. So, I'll have to check it out.
8467000	8470000	Even though I'm really interested in this game. But, hey, free.
8470000	8475000	Free beta. Now you get the chance to test if maybe you'd like it or not, right?
8475000	8476000	Well, check it out, I guess.
8476000	8485000	There it is. Alright, well, you guys know I love my Final Fantasy XIV and there's an interesting team up going on here.
8485000	8486000	Is it Sotino's Pizza Rolls?
8486000	8491000	Close. Really fucking close. What's the closest thing in the world to pizza rolls?
8491000	8493000	Actual fucking pizza.
8493000	8500000	So, Domino's and Square Enix have teamed up to create the Chocobo Chow Pizza.
8500000	8504000	Is it made of Michelle Greens?
8504000	8510000	No, it is made of chicken, pineapple, because yes to pineapple on pizza.
8510000	8511000	Yes.
8511000	8512000	Yes. Yes.
8512000	8514000	Let's order one right now.
8514000	8518000	Alright. You know what? That should be the next Splatfest.
8518000	8520000	Pineapple, no pineapple.
8520000	8530000	Pineapple on pizza or never on pizza. Anyway, so, the Chocobo Chow includes, SSU 100 Matt says, this conversation is over.
8530000	8535000	Anyway, the Chocobo Chow includes chicken, pineapple, capsaicin?
8535000	8539000	Capsaicin. Capsaicin is what makes peppers hot.
8539000	8542000	Oh, okay, okay. Mushrooms.
8542000	8543000	I wouldn't be able to eat it.
8543000	8548000	Onions and spring onions, which I think are just green onions, basically, are what on this pizza.
8548000	8554000	So, yeah, this is unfortunately, and maybe why there's ingredients in here I'm not as familiar with.
8554000	8558000	This is a flavor exclusive to Australia and New Zealand.
8558000	8559000	Womp, womp.
8559000	8565000	But, you can get a gaming bundle for $50 Australian, which is about $40 in US dollars.
8565000	8574000	It's three regular sized pizzas, garlic bread, and a 1.25 liter soda, and that's gonna be about $40, which for three pizzas I guess isn't bad.
8574000	8581000	But, you also get a code with that for Final Fantasy XIV Online, which you can redeem for PC or PlayStation 4.
8581000	8582000	So, there you go.
8582000	8586000	But, we all know Square is really making their money from that game from the monthly subscription.
8586000	8590000	So, it's a 30 day hit to get you hooked, and then from there.
8590000	8594000	And, I don't think the online complete edition includes Stormblood.
8594000	8600000	I could be wrong, but I don't think, oh no, you get a code to redeem for a chance to win.
8600000	8601000	Excuse me.
8601000	8604000	So, yes, the complete edition then would include Stormblood. Oh, you get a chance.
8604000	8608000	Well, I stand corrected. There you go.
8608000	8613000	Anyway, there are other Domino's pizzas that have been rebranded, by the way.
8613000	8617000	Moogle Meat Lovers, not actually made from moogle meat.
8617000	8619000	It's actually, yeah, other meat.
8619000	8626000	Curious Cactar, that's the veggie pizza, in case you're curious about vegetables.
8626000	8628000	That's a Loki pizza.
8628000	8630000	I'm veg curious.
8633000	8636000	Stormblood Supreme and Heavensward Hawaiian.
8636000	8639000	I don't know if you would put blood and supreme in your...
8639000	8644000	Wait, wait, wait. Does that make you like pizza pie curious?
8644000	8645000	He's pie curious.
8645000	8647000	Pie curious.
8647000	8649000	I think, Jamie...
8649000	8652000	I'm not really curious about pies, because I do eat pizza quite a bit.
8652000	8654000	I had pizza last night, by the way, so...
8654000	8660000	We need to have a frank conversation on this show about how everybody's a little bit pie curious.
8660000	8666000	There are flavors of pie you've always wanted to try. Everybody's a little bit pie curious.
8668000	8670000	Ironically, I don't like regular pie.
8670000	8671000	Really?
8671000	8672000	Yeah, I don't like pie.
8672000	8674000	What types of sweets do you like?
8674000	8676000	I really like a lot of sweets.
8676000	8683000	How can you say I don't like pie? Does that mean you don't like apple pie, cherry pie, lemon meringue pie, peanut butter pie, pumpkin pie?
8683000	8684000	There are 50,000.
8684000	8685000	Yes, all of the above. I do not like any of that.
8685000	8687000	I want peanut butter pie.
8688000	8690000	Are you saying you're not even a little pie curious?
8690000	8692000	I'm not pie curious in that sense, no.
8693000	8695000	Not dessert pie curious.
8695000	8696000	Wow.
8697000	8698000	I can't handle it.
8698000	8700000	Not even a cream pie.
8701000	8703000	That's probably for the best.
8703000	8708000	Stopy in Chat says, I'm piesexual. Ever seen the movie American Pie?
8708000	8709000	Yes, I have.
8710000	8716000	All right. Anyway, I did notice though that another there was yet another Hawaiian flavor in the Final Fantasy.
8716000	8723000	I think Yoshi P agrees that pineapple should go on pizza because that's two of those pizzas that have pineapples on it.
8723000	8727000	Do veggie pizzas have pineapple? Not usually. I don't think they usually, but it's usually greens.
8727000	8729000	That would be a fruit pizza.
8729000	8732000	Oh, that's right. A pineapple is a fruit, of course. So yes. All right.
8732000	8735000	Do they have fruit pizza? What other fruits go on pizzas?
8735000	8736000	Tomatoes.
8736000	8741000	Tomatoes. That's right. Even though most people don't think of tomatoes as fruit, but yeah.
8741000	8743000	That's really all they offer.
8743000	8744000	Avocado.
8745000	8746000	Is avocado a fruit?
8746000	8747000	Avocado is a fruit.
8747000	8748000	Do they even put that on pizza?
8748000	8750000	And I've had it on pizza before, yes.
8750000	8751000	You can, yeah.
8751000	8752000	Sounds like California.
8752000	8753000	It sounds like a California Pizza Kitchen thing.
8753000	8754000	They put avocado on everything.
8754000	8756000	Exactly. All right.
8757000	8759000	SSJ100 Matt is like, this needs to stop.
8759000	8769000	I feel like SSJ100 Matt is to pineapple on pizza as Rob Roberts is to mayonnaise on anything.
8769000	8773000	My wife would sure like this to stop so we can get home and watch Game of Thrones already.
8773000	8775000	Oh, Jesus Christ. Fine. We'll go on to the next story.
8775000	8777000	Because she can't keep herself off social media.
8777000	8782000	You know what? I've just been watching everything on YouTube just now, and oh my God, I called it.
8782000	8784000	How come you call a show that you don't watch?
8784000	8786000	I do. I've been watching this season.
8786000	8788000	Oh, okay. I thought you didn't watch the show.
8788000	8793000	But I went back and watched everything about the characters I gave a shit about.
8793000	8801000	And honestly enough, I've called everything to this episode.
8801000	8805000	This whole season has been a complete non-surprise.
8805000	8808000	I feel like the one guy left who cares more about Twin Peaks,
8808000	8815000	which has been like sitting through like 12 episodes of like what the fuck is going on, which is fine.
8815000	8821000	Because that's David Lynch. You watch a David Lynch thing, there's always going to be a little bit of what the fuck is going on.
8821000	8827000	In the old Twin Peaks, Lost Highway, fucking any of his movies, there's always going to be a little bit of what the fuck is going on.
8827000	8832000	But like the last two episodes have really started to say like, this is what's fucking going on.
8832000	8836000	And it's been like, oh damn, so I'm really, I fucking want to watch Twin Peaks.
8836000	8839000	And here's the crazy part. Sorry, Loki.
8840000	8849000	The Twin Peaks finale is at Dragon Con, yet there's no official viewing on Sunday of the Twin Peaks finale.
8849000	8852000	How did they miss an opportunity like that? I don't understand.
8852000	8853000	Licensing?
8853000	8857000	I guess. I guess maybe showing it in a room or something, but I guess they'll have to be unofficial viewings.
8857000	8861000	But it's Sunday night, which if I remember right, is the Masquerade.
8861000	8867000	The GLBT event is also Sunday night, which is weird. I seem to remember it was on Saturday night every other year.
8867000	8873000	So it's like, probably just have to download it and watch it on my phone on the plane home or something.
8873000	8875000	But I'm really excited about that.
8875000	8879000	Alright, anyway, let's get to some more stories.
8879000	8881000	So after pizza, Dark Sakura.
8881000	8887000	Oh god, I want pizza though now. I'm hungry. Even after all that delicious Korean food I had.
8887000	8893000	So, speaking of things that are not delicious, it would be the way the EA was treating Mass Effect.
8893000	8897000	Except for one glorious nugget of pineapple on the pizza.
8897000	8901000	Basically, Mass Effect isn't dead.
8901000	8913000	EA Executive Vice President Patrick Soderlund said that the performance of Mass Effect Andromeda has not doomed the series.
8913000	8915000	And the quote on here is,
8916000	8921000	I've seen people saying, oh EA's not making another Mass Effect. I see no reason why we shouldn't come back to Mass Effect.
8921000	8927000	Why not? It's a spectacular universe and it's a loved series. It has a big fan base.
8927000	8930000	And it's a game that has done a lot for EA and for Bioware.
8930000	8934000	So they're saying that they need to be cautious about it and they need to be careful.
8934000	8939000	But they are planning on eventually coming back to it from what they're saying.
8939000	8944000	But we'll see. They've said this shit before.
8944000	8950000	When was the last time we got the Lost Vikings game, really?
8950000	8955000	Well, they throw dumb little Lost Vikings references into later games.
8955000	8956000	They're in World of Warcraft.
8956000	8958000	And they're heroes in Heroes of the Storm.
8958000	8959000	Yeah.
8959000	8961000	So, you never know.
8961000	8963000	Well, fuck Anthem.
8964000	8969000	I would like to see Mass Effect come back. I'm just worried about if EA is saying this.
8969000	8974000	Would EA let somebody who's not Bioware develop a Mass Effect game? I'm a little worried about that.
8974000	8979000	I mean, now it ultimately depends on who's involved.
8979000	8986000	But I don't want a return to the Mass Effect franchise to be, oh, it's a clicker game on mobile.
8986000	8989000	You have to mine the planets for resources.
8989000	8990000	I want the mic to pick this up.
8990000	8991000	What?
8993000	8994000	Thwarp.
8994000	9000000	Thwarp. Furious fanning ensues. I'm shoving breadsticks into my purse as we speak.
9000000	9005000	Just a couple more stories for you guys and then we'll do some Ask Orange Lounge. Loki.
9005000	9010000	So, Sega is developing a Fist of the North Star game.
9010000	9013000	It's going to be the Yakuza team working on that.
9013000	9017000	And it looks pretty awesome based off the trailer that they have right now.
9017000	9019000	It's only confirmed to be coming out in Japan.
9019000	9026000	But hopefully we'll see more details from during Tokyo Game Show, which is going to be the end of September.
9029000	9032000	I can't believe Tokyo Game Show is sneaking up on us like that.
9032000	9033000	Yep.
9033000	9036000	Oh, man. There's going to be some exciting announcements at Tokyo Game Show.
9036000	9039000	There's got to be. I feel like other companies have been saving stuff for it.
9039000	9041000	And maybe we'll get an update on some of these games.
9041000	9042000	Sony will actually have something coming out.
9042000	9044000	Heck yeah. I'm excited. I'm excited.
9045000	9048000	Alright. Well, one more story for you guys tonight.
9048000	9053000	And it has to do with the game that nobody asked for, but you're going to get it anyway.
9053000	9057000	And it's Bubsy! The Wooly Strike Back.
9057000	9062000	And there's even going to be a limited PlayStation 4 edition for you Ultimate Bubsy fans.
9062000	9068000	That will include the software, the original soundtrack, Bubsy's business card.
9069000	9071000	You know, for your file.
9071000	9073000	And a mystery postcard.
9073000	9079000	This extremely limited physical edition will be available at Best Buy, GameStop, and other online retailers.
9079000	9081000	It's only 40 bucks for what it's worth.
9081000	9085000	So I will, despite the fact I'm having a laugh here at Bubsy, who knows?
9085000	9087000	The game may actually be good. Who knows?
9087000	9093000	But this is only 40 bucks and you have this extra junk.
9093000	9094000	But it's extra stuff.
9094000	9096000	Well, you actually start at 64.
9096000	9098000	Like going, what the fuck? I'm not buying that.
9099000	9103000	So, but anyway, the release date for all this, get this.
9103000	9106000	October 31st, 2017.
9106000	9109000	The perfect Halloween gift for your friends.
9109000	9111000	Bubsy, The Wooly Strike Back.
9111000	9114000	Available on PlayStation 4, Steam, and Rage Nator.
9114000	9117000	Are you out there? Because they are actually advertising good old games.
9117000	9122000	GOG.COM is one of the platforms that Bubsy is going to be available on right there.
9122000	9124000	So, we'll see.
9124000	9126000	There's a new trailer out there if you want to watch that.
9126000	9128000	I'm happy to see that Accolade is back.
9128000	9134000	Wake me up when they do Accolade Comics, which was one of my favorite Commodore 64 games in the world.
9134000	9140000	Anyway, since we are unfortunately prevented from having a Skype line tonight,
9140000	9146000	let's quickly open it up to any questions in our chat room with a segment that we call Ask Orange Lounge.
9146000	9150000	In the past, I would usually make you send me a private message, but I'm not going to do that.
9150000	9155000	If you want to just ask an open question chat, it could be about games, it could be about pretty much anything.
9155000	9157000	I also have last minute stories, I have two.
9157000	9159000	Good, because we need a few minutes for some questions to come in.
9159000	9161000	So, Ask Orange Lounge, in the meantime, stories.
9161000	9168000	Along with our Half-Life 3 story news, if you are looking to play Half-Life 3,
9168000	9170000	well, I got some news for you actually.
9170000	9180000	Just released today, ModDB actually released, it's called Half-Life 2 Aftermath.
9180000	9186000	And so you can check out some of the beta stuff that leaked out from Half-Life 2 Episode 3.
9186000	9191000	I guess that they had been developing some stuff leaked out and they were working on making it playable.
9191000	9198000	So you can play around with some of the things that didn't actually make it into Half-Life 3 or Half-Life 2 Episode 3.
9198000	9203000	Yeah, so just go check it out, moddb.com, and there's a link there.
9203000	9205000	So, that's kind of neat.
9205000	9212000	And it includes 11 levels that were created by Valve between 2012 and 2013, and 10 for Half-Life 3.
9212000	9218000	Four demonstration levels, there's different NPC, or no NPCs.
9218000	9225000	You have some weapons and some characters, enemy types that were made for the game that never ended up coming out.
9225000	9229000	And then finally, last but not least, this could be a tease of something that we might hear about soon,
9229000	9241000	but there is a listing on Target for Bethesda Game of Thrones, which could be a Skyrim-type game for Game of Thrones,
9241000	9244000	or it could be just some erroneous shit that they have on Target.com.
9244000	9245000	Yes.
9245000	9251000	Whatever the case may be, there is something there that says Bethesda and Game of Thrones and let our imaginations run wild.
9251000	9256000	But doesn't Telltale have the Game of Thrones stuff, or is it one of those things where maybe they license it to multiple people?
9256000	9257000	They license it to multiple people.
9257000	9258000	I guess like Walking Dead did that.
9258000	9262000	Well, they had a Game of Thrones game that came out at one time, but...
9262000	9264000	Telltale, I think, did one, didn't they?
9264000	9271000	Well, they did one too, but there was an actual Game of Thrones game that came out that was something completely separate.
9271000	9274000	How to kill everyone and get away with it.
9274000	9276000	So, that's it.
9276000	9285000	All right. Well, just a couple questions are coming in our chat room, but I guess we have enough that we can actually answer some questions here.
9285000	9287000	Again, so in absence of a Skype line tonight...
9287000	9296000	Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.
9296000	9300000	What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?
9300000	9304000	I haven't sung this song in forever, it seems.
9304000	9307000	And I think I might have forgotten all the lyrics.
9307000	9309000	Never had lyrics.
9309000	9311000	Whee!
9311000	9313000	There's gonna be people that have been listening to the show for like three years that are like,
9313000	9315000	Why does he do this? Why does he sing?
9315000	9318000	They're gonna make the Rob Roberts Orange Lounge Music Compilation.
9318000	9320000	That fucking already happened at some point.
9320000	9321000	No, they had to do the...
9321000	9323000	No, remember when John was still listening to the show?
9323000	9325000	He did fucking, there was that Step Mania thing.
9325000	9329000	Him and Dark Tetsuya put together like a whole Step Mania thing, and they had a song.
9329000	9332000	There was a song in it that went Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.
9332000	9333000	It was one of your fucking things.
9333000	9334000	It was Rob Period.
9334000	9335000	Yeah, it was Rob Period.
9335000	9337000	And then fucking Scott Rubin from All Games got a hold of it.
9337000	9342000	And like, I would be tuning into All Games Radio randomly one day and all of a sudden I'd hear Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.
9342000	9345000	It was Scott's like favorite fucking thing to come from this show.
9345000	9348000	And I'd be like, What? What is happening here on this day?
9348000	9351000	By the way, congrats to him on the addition to his family.
9351000	9353000	Oh, yes, of course, of course.
9353000	9354000	Yes.
9354000	9356000	Although he's probably out of Burning Man this weekend.
9356000	9361000	He's probably doing ice cream at the Playa if I follow his life correctly.
9361000	9363000	Because I know he's in ice cream, he's in Burning Man.
9363000	9366000	It just seems like a very logical marriage of the two.
9366000	9368000	Let's go get pizza.
9368000	9369000	You want pizza?
9369000	9370000	Yes.
9370000	9373000	I'll put something on it that I'm not allowed to mention because it has to do with 100 Matt.
9373000	9376000	I like him a lot and I want to pineapple.
9376000	9377000	Fine. You be the bitch.
9377000	9378000	All right.
9378000	9381000	Let's get to some questions in our chat room.
9381000	9382000	There's actually quite a few here tonight.
9382000	9383000	Let's do it.
9383000	9387000	I apologize if we don't do all of these, but I will do a few of these.
9387000	9391000	Bobby Black Wolf is asking question number one.
9391000	9394000	What is your favorite troll question and why is it?
9394000	9397000	Why is Chrono Trigger better than Super Metroid?
9397000	9399000	What is your favorite troll question?
9399000	9401000	This one.
9401000	9405000	Actually, my favorite troll questions are these.
9405000	9411000	On a scale of 1 to 10, how much do you love this movie Showgirls and why did you say 10?
9411000	9413000	I do like those types of questions.
9413000	9415000	They're very good for trolling.
9415000	9421000	Another trend I've seen on Twitter recently, and I forget the guy's username off the top of my head.
9421000	9422000	I think it's NintendoLegend.
9422000	9423000	I think it's his name on Twitter.
9423000	9428000	And he likes to do these polls that are which of these games is the worst game ever?
9428000	9430000	And you'll have two choices.
9430000	9433000	Super Mario Brothers 3 and Super Mario Brothers World or something like that.
9433000	9437000	The two choices will be like The Legend of Zelda and Super Metroid.
9437000	9439000	And people will reply and be like, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.
9439000	9440000	It's really funny.
9440000	9443000	The only way to win is not to play.
9443000	9444000	Essentially.
9444000	9450000	Do you have a favorite troll question, Dark Sakura?
9450000	9451000	I guess that's a no.
9451000	9453000	Or she's trolling me now.
9453000	9454000	That was me trolling you.
9454000	9455000	All right.
9455000	9456000	Act Deft.
9456000	9459000	Question number two.
9459000	9463000	What's your favorite Pokemon and why?
9463000	9464000	That's a good question.
9464000	9465000	It's game related.
9465000	9467000	What's your favorite Pokemon and why?
9467000	9470000	I guess I'll start because I don't see my co-hosts at this point.
9470000	9471000	I have one.
9471000	9472000	Okay, what's your favorite, Dark Sakura?
9472000	9473000	Houndoom because Goth.
9473000	9475000	Houndoom because you like Goths?
9475000	9476000	Okay.
9476000	9477000	Who's Goth?
9477000	9478000	Okay, I like that answer.
9478000	9479000	Loki, do you have a favorite Pokemon and why?
9479000	9480000	Pokemon.
9480000	9481000	Kidding.
9481000	9482000	I don't.
9482000	9483000	I mean.
9483000	9487000	How about like Porygon because he makes loud annoying screeches.
9487000	9488000	I'm just kidding.
9488000	9490000	I mean, it's probably like Eevee or something.
9490000	9491000	Eevee's cute.
9491000	9493000	All the Eeveelutions are popular.
9493000	9494000	Yeah.
9494000	9498000	My favorite hands down, and I'm sorry to go gen one, but I have to because, you know,
9498000	9503000	I remember watching the anime back in the day when the toys were at Burger King when
9503000	9504000	I was in college.
9504000	9508000	Jigglypuff is forever my fave because, and actually on my fave,
9508000	9512000	and actually on my phone background, I even have a little Jigglypuff because.
9512000	9513000	Jigglycaliente.
9513000	9514000	Not Jigglycaliente.
9514000	9517000	Well, that was the one time I was ever not.
9517000	9520000	I was almost on TV was asking Jigglycaliente a question.
9520000	9524000	I thought yours was the picture of Jigglycaliente's face on Jigglypuff.
9524000	9525000	No, no.
9525000	9526000	It's this.
9526000	9528000	It's the little, little cute little background.
9528000	9529000	Oh, that one.
9529000	9534000	I thought I felt for sure you had that your background was Jigglycaliente's face on Jigglypuff.
9534000	9538000	That's probably what you set as my picture whenever somebody call, whenever I call you.
9538000	9540000	No, you're, you're still, um.
9540000	9541000	Trixie.
9541000	9542000	You're still Trixie.
9542000	9543000	And yours is Katya, yeah.
9543000	9544000	Contact, Rob, contact.
9544000	9545000	Aliens.
9545000	9546000	Oh, honey.
9546000	9547000	Um, by the way, they're getting a show.
9547000	9548000	Touch.
9548000	9549000	I'm so happy for them.
9549000	9550000	I know.
9550000	9551000	Happy?
9551000	9552000	Anyway, okay, back to the question.
9552000	9556000	I'm always, I always feel, I bless, I thank, I thank gay God every day that Trixie follows
9556000	9557000	me on Twitter.
9557000	9558000	I really do.
9558000	9559000	But anyway.
9559000	9560000	Katya to follow me.
9560000	9561000	I met Katya.
9561000	9562000	Katya's great.
9562000	9563000	And I met Detox.
9563000	9564000	What was the question?
9564000	9565000	Oh, yes.
9565000	9566000	Favorite Pokemon.
9566000	9567000	It's Jigglypuff.
9567000	9569800	And because, because she has the microphone and I always thought it was hilarious how
9569800	9573820	she got really mad when people fell asleep when she's trying to sing or in my case talk
9573820	9575420	and she would draw on their face with a marker.
9575420	9576580	I always thought that was really funny.
9576580	9579140	So um, yeah, Jigglypuff.
9579140	9580140	Forever my face.
9580140	9581140	Fave.
9581140	9582140	All right.
9582140	9583640	Uh, let's see.
9583640	9584640	Next question.
9584640	9586140	Question number three.
9586140	9592940	Uh, Stoppy in chat asks, uh, Rob, this weekend I went to my first live Rocky Horror show
9592960	9594920	performance and I had a blast.
9594920	9597580	I finally get that movie.
9597580	9600860	If there was a game based on Rocky Horror, how would you make it?
9600860	9604100	Survival horror, rhythm, point and click.
9604100	9608940	Well believe it or not, Stoppy, there are already two games based on the Rocky Horror
9608940	9614700	show, not the picture show, but the show because the Rocky Horror show was the play that started
9614700	9615700	it all right.
9615700	9616700	And the picture show was just the movie.
9616700	9622220	But the play is, I think to this day, still kind of a bigger deal in the UK.
9622220	9625820	Like I'm sure the movie, the movie's there and there's some casts, but I think the play
9625820	9626820	is still a big deal.
9626820	9627820	We had the Broadway release.
9627820	9629180	And that's where it started.
9629180	9634700	But because of that, in the 80s on the Commodore 64, there was actually a Rocky Horror show
9634700	9638020	game and it was kind of more like a point and click type adventure.
9638020	9643820	I mean a Commodore 64 style, let you say maniac mansion, but like not nearly that good.
9643820	9644980	It was very rudimentary.
9644980	9651220	Uh, then when they did a revival in the early 2000s, I want to say it was whenever, I think
9651220	9656380	it was when Anthony Stewart Head took the role of Frank-N-Furter, which by the way,
9656380	9659700	glorious casting, I know, right?
9659700	9664140	They released a CD-ROM version that was kind of like an updated version of that game.
9664140	9668700	So technically, it has already existed as a game.
9668700	9674900	So for that reason, I kind of say, yeah, point and click, but that's because I'm already
9674900	9677880	tarnished knowing that those other games exist.
9677880	9680740	So I think it would have to be a bit of a point and click adventure, but I would like
9680740	9682920	to see something that would be like a sequel.
9682920	9686840	But a rhythm or music game would be kind of cool, but I think it would be like a one-off
9686840	9687840	cheap little thing.
9687840	9690980	I don't think it would be like an actual, like full on game.
9690980	9693420	So there you go.
9693420	9694420	All right.
9694420	9697940	Uh, let's see, uh, moving on with a couple other questions here.
9697940	9702700	Let's go to Ice P in our chat with question number four.
9702700	9704780	Have you played Slime Rancher?
9704780	9707040	No, I have not.
9707040	9711880	But this game just came up today in conversation and somebody was telling it, it wasn't even
9711880	9712960	during the show.
9712960	9714400	Somebody was telling me I should play it.
9714400	9715400	So yeah, it looks cool.
9715400	9716400	Yeah.
9716400	9717400	I will check it out.
9717400	9718400	It does look cool.
9718400	9719400	I'll check it out.
9719400	9720400	Have you, you haven't played it either, right?
9720400	9721400	I've watched videos of people playing it.
9721400	9722400	So I know what it's about.
9722400	9723400	What the hell is it?
9723400	9725200	It's basically like it says Slime Rancher.
9725200	9730480	So you're, you build a ranch and you're going out to the wild and catching slimes with like
9730480	9736040	this like vacuum gun thing and the slimes generate like currency that you build ranch
9736040	9737360	and stuff and they do different things.
9737360	9738360	That sounds cute.
9738360	9741960	So it can be like tricky cause like some of the slimes like they stay on the top of each
9741960	9744240	other and escape and you have to go catch them.
9744240	9746360	So it's kind of like Monster Hunter, it sounds like.
9746360	9747800	No, it's very cute.
9747800	9748840	It's less Monster Hunter.
9748840	9750600	You're not really fighting things.
9750600	9753080	It's just cool.
9753080	9754080	You should check it out.
9754080	9755080	It's cute.
9755080	9756080	All right.
9756080	9758000	Uh, Darsakra, is that anything you've ever played?
9758000	9759000	I'm not interested in it.
9759000	9760000	It sounds really dull.
9760000	9761000	It's cute.
9761000	9762000	You should check it out.
9762000	9763000	Lisa, watch the trailer.
9763000	9764200	Kossin in chat.
9764200	9765600	Question number five.
9765600	9768520	What's the best flavor of chips in the world?
9768520	9769720	That's a good question.
9769720	9770720	You know, I do love.
9770720	9771920	Do they mean chips or crisps?
9771920	9774300	I think we mean American chips in this case.
9774300	9779400	So I always get super involved in these Lay's do us a flavor contest, which were, which
9779400	9782600	were on a break last year, but they're back this year and you know, they have the new
9782600	9785220	flavors and you know, I got to try every single one.
9785220	9788880	So here's, I just want to give you quickly my hot take on the new Lay's flavors because
9788880	9790520	it's important.
9790520	9795640	Eating bagel plus cream cheese tastes exactly the same to me as Maui onion.
9795640	9799320	I don't know why bagel and cream cheese tastes like Maui onion, I guess because you know,
9799320	9802960	onion bagel, but they taste the exact same to me.
9802960	9808820	Fried green tomato, uh, has a mayo aftertaste to me and I can't fucking stand it.
9808820	9813360	So that leaves by default, the winner crispy taco, which does taste like it tastes like
9813360	9814360	a taco.
9814360	9818720	So is it fried green tomato?
9818720	9823920	But my favorite flavor of chips, honestly, I'm going to go basic because sometimes the
9823920	9827360	basics are the best Pringles, which aren't even really potato.
9827360	9828360	They're potato crisps.
9828360	9831880	Like you can't even really say the chips, but Pringles, sour cream and onion, like forever
9831880	9833600	my sentimental fave for sure.
9833600	9835340	Uh, Loki, do you have a favorite?
9835340	9839560	It's a little unconventional, but I'm going to say poker because it tastes like smoking
9839560	9842320	and despair.
9842320	9844400	Dar Sakura.
9844400	9850800	I've always been really fond of sun chips, but I, but I do have like the plain sun chips,
9850800	9856240	but I do have a special place in my heart for Charles chips, which you can only get
9856240	9858240	in the Southeast.
9858240	9861880	And um, what was the other one?
9861880	9868160	The Maui onion, but it's that same flavor that has the zaps, zaps or is it a different
9868160	9869160	one?
9869160	9871000	Zaps has that nasty pickle shit.
9871000	9872000	That's gross.
9872000	9873000	Okay.
9873000	9874000	Maui onion.
9874000	9877720	Oh, I remember what my actual favorite is, Rob.
9877720	9882840	It's the Tara sweets and beets, sweet potato and beet chips.
9882840	9883840	All right.
9883840	9887200	We're going to do just a few more here, but we're going to do these kinds of lightning
9887200	9888200	rounds.
9888200	9891080	We're going to pick it up and answer these fast Akuma JP.
9891080	9894120	Why doesn't OLR play the uncharted series?
9894120	9896600	Um, I've dabbled in it a little bit.
9896600	9897600	You want to buy it for me?
9897600	9899400	It's you can borrow mine if you want.
9899400	9901040	I'm not interested in it.
9901040	9906960	I honestly, I tried, but I just, my gamer ADD kicked in and I never finished.
9906960	9908440	The games weren't bad though.
9908440	9911520	I probably played more tomb Raider than I did uncharted one or two though.
9911520	9916480	I really need to go back and give the trilogy a go on a PS4 Loki.
9916480	9917480	I'm men just haven't.
9917480	9918480	They look neat.
9918480	9919960	I just haven't gone around to them.
9919960	9921440	We can't play all the games.
9921440	9922440	We can't.
9922440	9926520	Um, it never really set off an interest for me, so I never played it.
9926520	9927520	Let's see.
9927520	9928520	Uh, come on, no Gus.
9928520	9931240	This isn't a question, but it says, yes, we need a musical episode.
9931240	9940800	Um, no, uh, you had one several hundred episodes, episode 69 with the karaoke revolution live
9940800	9941800	on air, but dark soccer.
9941800	9943080	I had the night off that night.
9943080	9944080	She wasn't here.
9944080	9945080	Believe it or not.
9945080	9946080	I'll sing suddenly Seymour.
9946080	9947080	All right.
9947080	9948080	I like that song.
9948080	9949080	We can do edit.
9949080	9950080	No, no.
9950080	9953960	I was what my feelings are hurt.
9953960	9955880	The bitches shot me down.
9955880	9956880	Let's do that right now.
9956880	9957880	No, no, no.
9958240	9959240	We're not going to do it.
9959240	9960240	No, no, we will not be no.
9960240	9961240	No.
9961240	9964200	I was actually trying to make a point about it is I was watching little shop before us.
9964200	9969440	Um, during the day of the eclipse, cause I could not get the songs out of my head.
9969440	9974960	And then I went up looking like all these videos of Ellen green.
9974960	9977120	Suddenly see more.
9977120	9980440	Anyway, uh, where else are we?
9980440	9983600	Uh, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, uh, Oh, S.J.
9983600	9988840	Matt, what is the most expensive thing gaming related you've purchased that you've regretted?
9988840	9989960	My PlayStation four pro
9992960	10001640	Logie building my, the first, uh, main cabinet because it costs several thousand dollars
10001640	10003320	and it was kind of a waste of money for that.
10003320	10008280	I could have, there was a lot of cheaper alternatives for that dark soccer.
10008280	10009660	I can't really think of anything.
10009660	10010660	Maybe the engage.
10010660	10011660	Okay.
10011660	10012660	Good answer.
10012700	10013700	I'm curious.
10013700	10014700	Wait a minute.
10014700	10016700	I thought you didn't pay for it.
10016700	10017700	Okay.
10017700	10024780	Um, um, um, um, um, I don't really regret anything.
10024780	10026260	I regret nothing.
10026260	10028180	No, seriously.
10028180	10031220	It's like, I don't, we don't really have much shit in the collection.
10031220	10032220	Oh yeah.
10032220	10040060	I, I re I regret ever renting the WWF thunder or whatever WCW thunder, whatever thunder
10040100	10041100	was.
10041100	10044860	And it was so bad that blockbuster let us take it back and rent something different.
10044860	10050900	Uh, dungeon buster says scariest time playing a Niantic game, Pokemon go, et cetera.
10050900	10051900	Outside.
10051900	10056260	Um, I got pulled over by the police playing Ingress, um, and it was because I didn't do
10056260	10060820	anything wrong, but I drove through a neighborhood because I was trying to get to where a baseball
10060820	10061820	diamond was.
10061820	10066820	And as I drove through the neighborhood, there were all these cop cars up and down the street.
10066820	10069260	And as I was driving down the street, I was like, you know what?
10069260	10070820	I don't need the portal that badly.
10070820	10072000	I'm going to just keep on going.
10072000	10075260	I wasn't looking at my phone or anything cause I knew exactly where this portal was, where
10075260	10078260	I go to park so I can get to the portal and all that stuff.
10078260	10082400	So, um, I was driving down the street and all these cop cars were there and I just noped
10082400	10083400	the fuck out.
10083400	10087540	Well, sure enough, one of them cop cars pulls right out, follows me, pulls me over and is
10087540	10089820	like, uh, what were you doing driving through there?
10089820	10093300	Because my, at the time I just bought that car that I have now, cause it was about a
10093300	10094300	year ago.
10094300	10096520	So my plates were temporary plates.
10096520	10098260	So like I just had all the signs.
10098260	10102780	So apparently they were looking for somebody and when a unmarked car came through the neighborhood
10102780	10106180	looking suspicious that noped the fuck out of there, they wanted to ask.
10106180	10110060	So I had to actually explain Ingress, but thank God, I had thought, never thought I'd
10110060	10113740	say this, but thank God Pokemon Go was a thing because I said to the officer, I said, okay,
10113740	10114940	you know, Pokemon Go.
10114940	10115940	He said, yeah.
10115940	10118040	I said, this is a very similar game.
10118040	10121540	That baseball diamond over there that you guys are in front of is where I was trying
10121540	10122540	to go.
10122540	10124100	And he said, show me the game.
10124100	10126620	And so I showed him the game and I showed him the baseball diamond and you know, he
10126620	10131820	was kind of like, you know, he nerd, well, I think he was just more like, I don't know
10131820	10135020	if he believed me at first because I still have the, I still had, it was so new.
10135020	10137140	I had the paper registration and all that shit.
10137140	10138140	Right.
10138140	10141740	So, you know, he, but it took, it took a good 15 minutes, but he ran it and then he was
10141740	10143860	like, all right, you didn't do anything wrong.
10143860	10147380	So I was like, I know I didn't do anything wrong, so I won't be going over there.
10147380	10148380	That pissed me off.
10148380	10149380	I could have thrown a field.
10149380	10152140	It would have been like 700 MU and I couldn't do it.
10152140	10154620	Fucking resistance put those fucking police people out there.
10154620	10155620	All right.
10155620	10156620	All right.
10156620	10160340	Um, let's see, lastly, let's say, uh, Oh yeah.
10160340	10161540	And that's still not a map points out.
10161540	10162540	I didn't answer the question.
10162540	10163540	Oh, I'm sorry.
10163540	10164540	Yes.
10164540	10169820	I didn't realize you had a scary Pokemon go moment riding with you.
10169820	10170820	Would you like to share something too?
10170820	10171820	Loki?
10171820	10174940	I don't think I've ever had a scary moment.
10174940	10175940	I've had a moment.
10175940	10176940	I was pissed off.
10176940	10177940	Uh, let's see.
10177940	10182460	A student her mat says, Rob did play ingress and single digit temperatures during magfest.
10182460	10183460	That is, that is true.
10183460	10184460	All right.
10184460	10185460	One more.
10186300	10187300	This is a good one for message.
10187300	10190640	You and her mat who says, uh, we need some O L R or vog t-shirts.
10190640	10192300	Can we make those happen someday?
10192300	10196100	Shout out to any listeners that are able to design t-shirts that would want to help out
10196100	10197100	on this.
10197100	10198100	You know what I've done?
10198100	10200380	I've designed vog shirts.
10200380	10202340	I designed the logo that went on the shirt.
10202340	10203340	Those.
10203340	10204340	Okay.
10204340	10207100	Those shirts were those little polo shirts that we kind of did for hosts.
10207100	10208980	I could design a shirt, no problem.
10208980	10212700	Let's let's look at like a generic shirt that we could wear, but I wouldn't want to do something
10212700	10213700	more than just the logo.
10213700	10214700	You know what I mean?
10215460	10222380	Something about orange challenge radio and on the back, it'll say, eat my entire ass.
10222380	10224300	I don't think that sells the show very well.
10224300	10225300	I don't know.
10225300	10226300	Obviously.
10226300	10228220	So Lorraine standards for 15 plus years.
10228220	10229220	Yeah.
10229220	10230220	Okay.
10230220	10232640	If you guys are talking to orange lounge radio shirts, then yes, we can do gutter humor.
10232640	10233640	That's fine.
10233640	10239340	If we do vog shirts, I have like an ocean of piss or piss into an ocean of piss that
10239340	10242060	iTunes reviewing is still up somewhere.
10242060	10243620	Oh, that's what we should do.
10243620	10244620	We should take.
10244620	10245620	Okay.
10245620	10246620	We'll take orange.
10246620	10248020	So this is the OLR shirt, not the vulture.
10248020	10251720	We'll take OLR and we'll take some of our greatest reviews from iTunes.
10251720	10254020	It's like pissing in an ocean of piss was one of them.
10254020	10259660	Uh, I just take like all our one star reviews and just put them on a shirt, but that, yeah,
10259660	10263340	I don't want to glamorize people doing one star reviews because then we're going to get
10263340	10264500	more of them.
10264500	10268580	So only five star reviews that were funny.
10268580	10274020	I'm just going to do like the OLR world tour and it's going to be like here in Atlanta.
10274020	10275020	That's it.
10275020	10276020	All right.
10276020	10278720	It'll be like the places we've actually been to her for the show.
10278720	10282520	So we need to find, first off, we need to agree on an appropriate storefront cause Bobby
10282520	10285960	is raising a point that he had a couple storefront ideas, but we kind of shot those down.
10285960	10289340	So we need to figure out who's going to do it and kind of go from there.
10289340	10292700	So we will, if the demand is there, we will work on it.
10292700	10297560	I've heard there are some new t-shirt places that are like Kickstarter to Seattle where
10297560	10302260	they don't print the shirt until like all the orders are in and then they do it.
10302260	10303260	And I kind of like that model.
10303500	10304500	Does that make sense?
10304500	10305500	Yeah.
10305500	10306500	Yeah.
10306500	10307500	I like that idea.
10307500	10309540	And then I think you get a better quality shirt than you do something like cafe press
10309540	10310540	or something.
10310540	10311540	Yeah.
10311540	10312540	There's a lot more places.
10312540	10313540	No one's going to use cafe press anymore.
10313540	10314540	Exactly.
10314540	10315540	There's more options.
10315540	10317700	So I would, I would look into one of those types of sites or something.
10317700	10323540	So um, I, we hear you and yes, we'll try to make something happen either on an OLR or
10323540	10324920	a VOG level.
10324920	10331220	If only I had a chance to meet with Bobby Black Wolf this week and you guys in our chat.
10331220	10335660	Oh, and Akuma JP actually links me to Uniqlo.
10335660	10336660	There was, I don't know what this is.
10336660	10339940	I guess I'll bring this up, but I got to say there's some Uniqlo shops here in the U S
10339940	10343460	and I've just been introduced to that chain cause we went to one in Chicago and actually
10343460	10345180	bought one of their Nintendo shirts.
10345180	10346180	That was awesome.
10346180	10347700	It has like a big Mario sprite in the corner.
10347700	10348700	Okay.
10348700	10349700	Yeah.
10349700	10350980	This is like the peanut sprites and stuff.
10350980	10352420	So there's, there's still some stuff in here.
10352420	10353420	It's really cute.
10353420	10356820	So, um, yeah, there's some really cute pics, uh, really cute shirts in here.
10356820	10358260	So yeah, I'm familiar with Uniqlo.
10358260	10359260	It's a fun store.
10359260	10360940	So, all right.
10360940	10361940	We need to wrap up though.
10361940	10362940	We need to get out.
10362940	10366820	It's after nine o'clock and, uh, people have other things they want to do and, uh, so forth.
10366820	10368500	So, uh, we're going to wrap up first.
10368500	10370980	I'm going to say, thanks for listening to the questions.
10370980	10374660	Uh, thanks for listening to Orange Launch Radio tonight and thanks for participating.
10374660	10377340	If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, please tell a friend or five
10377340	10378380	about the show.
10378380	10381860	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but only
10381860	10384220	if the voices are here for us to use them.
10384220	10386100	So, uh, please help us spread the word.
10386100	10388180	A five star review on a nice site.
10388180	10389180	Ursula for your voice.
10389180	10390180	That's right.
10390180	10394020	A nice five star review on a place like iTunes or a similar site wherever you found this
10394020	10395020	show.
10395020	10396300	Believe me, those go a long way.
10396300	10400900	I think I've seen in the last year, one new review show up on iTunes.
10400900	10403380	So could you help me out?
10403380	10404380	Really appreciate it.
10404380	10407660	Of course, many of you already did it years ago and I still appreciate that.
10407660	10409620	Anyway, uh, other final thoughts.
10409620	10410620	Let's get to it.
10410620	10412020	Uh, Loki, your final thought tonight.
10412020	10415520	I have to go home and watch Game of Thrones because my wife has no impulse control and
10415520	10419000	she's on the internet and she's going to spoil it for herself.
10419000	10423700	Um, I am going to watch Twin Peaks while I get ready to do some packing and so forth
10423700	10427560	for Dragon Con cause I leave early on Wednesday.
10427560	10428960	This year I have an early flight.
10428960	10432880	Usually I get in late at night, but this year I'm getting in like Wednesday afternoon.
10432880	10438140	So please don't rain out Dragon Con cause I do want to try to do some Pokemon Go and
10438140	10439140	stuff outdoors.
10439140	10440640	So please don't rain out my Dragon Con.
10440640	10442640	Uh, Dark Soccer, your final thought.
10442640	10444480	I fucking called that shit.
10445240	10446240	All right, that's going to do it.

10448240	10449240	What?
10449240	10450240	Tell Cersei it was me.
10450240	10451240	Sure.
10451240	10452760	Uh, we'll do it all again in 14 days.
10452760	10454440	Have a great Labor Day weekend.
10454440	10456440	Relax, have fun, game.
10456440	10461880	Uh, I'm sure there's many conventions and not just, not just, uh, Dragon Con, but PAX.
10461880	10465000	Uh, we have stuff here locally as well and I'm sure in your neighborhood as well.
