Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:21.000
Secret of Romano was my childhood gateway drug into action-adventure games, and I'm thrilled to say that it's being remade for PS4, Vita, and Steam to be released in February.

00:21.000 --> 00:27.000
This is the first fourth wall-breaking intro, stay tuned for tonight's news starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:38.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice, it is Orange Lounge Radio.

00:38.000 --> 00:45.000
Live tonight, August the 27th, 2017 with episode number 698 of our show.

00:45.000 --> 00:51.000
My name is Rob Roberts, here with my co-host to talk about video games over there at DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
I'm dying.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
Do you need CPR?

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
Hot!

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
Oh, it's the food you're eating, isn't it?

00:58.000 --> 01:08.000
I normally don't eat spicy food because I'm allergic to peppers and chilis, but I've had Benadryl like all morning, and so I said, oh, I'll be fine.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
Hot!

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
My mouth feels like outside.

01:12.000 --> 01:17.000
It's one of those things where it's like, I'm lactose intolerant, but once in a while I just want to have some ice cream.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
Oh, it was delicious though.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
But that's why they make pills, right?

01:20.000 --> 01:26.000
It's like death in my mouth, and now I need to drink, like, milk. Lots of milk.

01:26.000 --> 01:33.000
If this show was titled with quotes from the show like we used to do with Hoard House, I would call this episode Death in My Mouth, which seemed inappropriate.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
Death in My Mouth.

01:35.000 --> 01:41.000
Oh my gosh, you guys, the show tonight has been a hot mess, and it hasn't even started, like it's been a minute.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
This show is my mouth.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
No, look.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
The hot mess.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
Here's the deal.

01:45.000 --> 01:49.000
I know some of you guys like to give me a show. I need to introduce Techmaster Loki, because I know he's going to razz me about this.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
Hi, Loki. How are you?

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
Hi.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
Are you enjoying that burger?

01:52.000 --> 01:58.000
No, see, here's the thing. This is more of like one of those settling meals.

01:58.000 --> 02:05.000
Like, I didn't really want it, but I was, like, I couldn't decide on what I wanted, and I was like, eh, fine.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
This is the blind bait meal.

02:07.000 --> 02:12.000
It's just like, I don't really want a bacon ultimate cheeseburger, but fine.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
Yeah, it's like I have to eat something.

02:14.000 --> 02:20.000
I need something. Like, I was like, McDonald's is going to be shit. I don't want to eat tacos because I'm eating tacos every single day.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
What's one more day of tacos?

02:22.000 --> 02:30.000
I mean, it's good. I'm going to eat tacos tomorrow, but like, I'm not going to, I don't want, I didn't want to get more tacos today.

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
I was like, cause I'm kind of taco'd out right now. So I was like, okay, I'll get a hamburger.

02:34.000 --> 02:40.000
Haven't eaten it yet. I'm sure it's mediocre, but yeah, I'm just kind of like, eh.

02:40.000 --> 02:49.000
So here's the thing, is that the studio may be on its, Studio N7 here that we're based in in lovely Sacramento, California, it may be on its last legs.

02:49.000 --> 03:00.000
And I don't mean that in a panic way, but I mean that in a, you guys have given me shit over the years, and rightfully so probably, because I'm continuing to use Windows XP to run this show.

03:00.000 --> 03:15.000
And you guys are probably like, Rob, seriously. But I'm like, guys, seriously, and gals, seriously, like if something isn't broken, and you're doing this live show that you've done for over 15 years, if something isn't broken, I don't like to go out of my way to fix it.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
Well, unfortunately now it might be broken.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
Of course, you can always expect Microsoft to break something for you.

03:20.000 --> 03:32.000
Well, here's the thing, like Skype has just decided it doesn't want to work anymore. I tried to use the web online Skype, nah, you got to have Windows 7 in order to use that, even though it says right there on the site, it'll work on XP.

03:32.000 --> 03:40.000
Well, at least the client is supposed to work on XP, but I keep getting this whole error, I can't connect. So unfortunately, we can't have a Skype line tonight, which I'm really sad about, because I love talking to you guys.

03:40.000 --> 03:45.000
But we can do our toss call with Bobby Black Wolf that we do right at the end of his show, because he usually has this on at the end of his show.

03:45.000 --> 03:55.000
Then I try to start tonight's show, and Winamp is just like, crash, I'm like, okay, and then what happens when I bring back up Winamp, my default playlist is gone.

03:55.000 --> 04:14.000
Because, you know, when we do this live show, there's a certain setup to it, you know, we have like a little song to bring us into the show, and then there's, you know, Jason's little intro, you know, you're listening to Vogue Network, and then, you know, the little vocal cues, the intro you hear, all that stuff before the show comes up, it's all in a Winamp playlist, because this whole thing is on Shoutcast, which runs through Vogue Network.

04:14.000 --> 04:24.000
And it's like, oh my god, then Winamp wouldn't work. And I'm just like, is this it? Is my computer dying? Is this on its last legs? I don't know what to think. So, ugh.

04:24.000 --> 04:33.000
Yeah, I have to think about how I'm gonna fix that. Now, of course, we do have a live chat room every week. We do invite our live chatters to participate, live.voguenetwork.com.

04:33.000 --> 04:42.000
And Ron must suggest, use your gaming PC for Skype. Wouldn't work, because my gaming PC is way in the other room, and so they're not like next to each other, and I can't really like run that over.

04:42.000 --> 04:56.000
Now, the other backup plan he's just here, use your iPad if you have the right cable. I have done that before. There was a period of time where we were using the iPad, and I don't remember, I think it was another Windows XP issue or something, I was able to use the iPad to do it.

04:56.000 --> 05:06.000
But, since I wasn't prepared for that, I don't have my cables, and I'm not gonna be able to get it while we're trying to do the show here, so unfortunately, we're just not gonna have Skype tonight, and I'll just have some time to figure this out.

05:06.000 --> 05:21.000
If it's time up, it's time to finally upgrade this crap. Let's do it. And I kind of want to go to a laptop, because that would make the show very portable, which I think would be a great thing. We could do more event shows, like at places, you know, because we're making friends in the area and so forth.

05:21.000 --> 05:45.000
But I'm worried about, like, you know, I have very specific 1990s needs in my PC, and these modern, these newfangled laptops you kids are into may not play it, and I've got to, so yeah, I just, I'm having a crisis, everybody. It's that kind of night tonight, so I hope you all will bear with me, so we'll figure it out.

05:46.000 --> 06:03.000
Anyway, good suggestions in chat here. Stoppy says, OLR brought to you by Netscape. Dude, Google Chrome won't even update on this computer anymore. It's like, I've abandoned you, so I just, I don't know what to do.

06:03.000 --> 06:16.000
So yeah, so I'm going to have to figure this out, so at least I have a little time to do it, sort of, although I'm going to be going out of town on Wednesday, because I'm going to Dragon Con, and I hope to see you guys there at Dragon Con.

06:16.000 --> 06:28.000
We'll talk a little more about that in a little bit, but I suppose since this is a gaming podcast, we should get into some gaming news. So let's start tonight by talking about the Super Nintendo Classic.

06:28.000 --> 06:49.000
Now, speaking of hot messes, that's true, I can feel a lot better about my own personal situation by just thinking, at least I'm not Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, or one of these retailers that offered the Super Nintendo Classic for pre-order on Monday, and I'm not sure there's a lot I need to say about that.

06:49.000 --> 06:59.000
I'm pretty sure many of you who are listening to this show probably tried to pre-order one at some point, and I would imagine 98% of you were unsuccessful.

06:59.000 --> 07:10.000
Now, here's a disclaimer. I'm not saying this to rub this in, because I seriously think I'm going to get screwed one way or another, but I actually got to pre-order one.

07:10.000 --> 07:19.000
Well, here's the thing. They went up at like 1030 at night on Monday at BestBuy.com. That's 1030 West Coast. I might have even been 11.

07:19.000 --> 07:36.000
And that's 1030 or 11 West Coast time. Now, luckily, I'm a bit of an insomniac, so I was up anyway, and so I'm on Twitter, and I see the tweets come in that, oh, the Super Nintendo Classic is up for pre-order, and I'm like, I'm going through these motions, I'm not going to be able to get one, duh duh duh, and well, I'll be damned, I got one.

07:36.000 --> 07:45.000
I got one on BestBuy.com, and I even got the email confirming it, I got a tracking number and all that good stuff, but then I have that little voice in the back of my head this whole time.

07:45.000 --> 07:52.000
So did those people at Walmart.com that pre-ordered a couple months ago, asshole, so nothing is for certain in this world.

07:52.000 --> 08:07.000
So, theoretically, I have somehow managed to win this stupid, unnecessary game and actually pre-order a Super Nintendo Classic for now, but we'll see if that actually holds.

08:07.000 --> 08:18.000
I signed up for all the notifications for that stuff, so I got the notification on my phone, I even opened the page, but then I got to the page to order it, and I was like, I'm not fucking doing this.

08:18.000 --> 08:29.000
I'm just not. I'm like, you know what, I'm not fucking giving them the satisfaction of it, so fuck them, I'm not ordering that system.

08:29.000 --> 08:35.000
I'm tired of this bullshit. If it's readily available at the store, I may pick one up.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
So one way of phrasing it could be, you have had it officially.

08:38.000 --> 08:49.000
I've had it, I'm done. It's not worth it. And honestly, watching the game, Star Fox 2 sounds pretty amazing, I watch the gameplay and I'm like, ehhhh.

08:49.000 --> 08:55.000
Well, the official ROM will dump immediately, so I'm not worried about that.

08:55.000 --> 09:02.000
There's also been some side buys with the proto, and they have changed a significant amount, especially in regards to localization, it seems.

09:02.000 --> 09:07.000
So I mean, it's cool, but I, you know...

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
No, I get it, I get it.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
I'm not giving them the satisfaction for this.

09:11.000 --> 09:18.000
No, I get it, I totally get it, and I'm in this weird place because I'm like, well Rob, you should consider yourself lucky that you got one.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
And then there's another part of me that's like, but do you really, though, have one?

09:21.000 --> 09:25.000
This is the company that gives their systems to fucking GameStop.

09:25.000 --> 09:29.000
ThinkGeek, you know, quote unquote, because they're the same fucking company.

09:29.000 --> 09:36.000
And they're like, yeah, you can buy one of those systems if you buy $200 worth of bullshit with it.

09:36.000 --> 09:41.000
Fuck them. Fuck them. Seriously.

09:41.000 --> 09:46.000
They can produce those systems, they can produce those systems cheap, it's just a fucking Linux board in there.

09:47.000 --> 09:52.000
You can't tell me, oh we can't manufacture this shit in China. Bull fucking shit.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
So, whatever. I'm not buying it.

09:55.000 --> 10:02.000
Well let me ask this question, because I feel like, you know, obviously, again, 98% of the internet is extraordinarily frustrated right now,

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
and that's probably a generous number that as high as 2% of the people that wanted one actually got to pre-order.

10:06.000 --> 10:10.000
I'm probably being really fucking generous with that number, because I don't have any actual stats.

10:10.000 --> 10:17.000
Here's my question is, to try to put a positive spin to it, Loki, and I know that's hard on these types of topics,

10:17.000 --> 10:26.000
but realistically, important word, realistically, what can be done so this shit stops?

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
Any thoughts?

10:28.000 --> 10:34.000
Produce enough systems. Don't just produce them for four months. Produce enough systems.

10:34.000 --> 10:38.000
They do it for the fucking amiibos, they can do it for this.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
They do it for other accessories that people don't buy much of.

10:41.000 --> 10:46.000
Why can't this be produced? What is so difficult about this?

10:46.000 --> 10:52.000
Nothing. So they need to not close it off this time like they did with the NES Classic.

10:52.000 --> 11:00.000
What I still say, I still say, is because they fucking figured out how to put, how to backdoor a million other ROMs onto those things.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
That is why they stopped production of those things.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
They're gonna do that with this one too.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
Exactly, it's gonna happen with this one too.

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000
They can do with everything. There's nothing you can do to prevent that.

11:09.000 --> 11:14.000
You know how, no, actually there is nothing you can do to prevent that.

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
I was gonna say, you know how you remove it? It's just take out the USB port.

11:17.000 --> 11:22.000
Nope, there's really nothing you can do about it because if people want to fucking hack that shit, they're gonna hack it.

11:22.000 --> 11:28.000
If you put them on the chip, then obviously someone can put them on the chip as well, or they can take them off the chip.

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
It's not impossible.

11:32.000 --> 11:40.000
I think, okay, from my perspective, there's one very easy thing that should be done for this.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
And that is that these retailers need to be using CAPTCHA.

11:43.000 --> 11:48.000
Or they need to be using more, these retailers need to do more to prevent the bots.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
They need to stop that.

11:50.000 --> 11:57.000
And I think the only reason why, you know, for all practical purposes, Best Buy stayed up for a good 20 minutes.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
I think that's better than most people were expecting when it comes to these preorders.

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
Yes, I realize it was the middle of the night, but look, the West Coast is a big place.

12:04.000 --> 12:10.000
There were still a lot of people that were going, you know, L.A. and all the people, Seattle, Portland, all the people on the West Coast.

12:10.000 --> 12:15.000
There's Insomniacs on the East Coast, too. There were plenty of people gunning for those systems.

12:15.000 --> 12:22.000
And the bots got tricked out of that one because the URL had changed, right?

12:22.000 --> 12:30.000
Which caused that whole bullshit where they didn't get the emails fired off for people that requested the emails when those go live.

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
And just the general bullshit of the fact that it went up in the middle of the night for most people.

12:34.000 --> 12:41.000
Which, you know, while, yes, it worked in my favor, sure, I can acknowledge the bullshit factor that it should have been something where they said,

12:41.000 --> 12:45.000
Wednesday at noon, it's happening and everybody's got a shot.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
Like, I don't think it's one of those things they should have snuck out there in the middle of the night.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
Like, I can acknowledge that. It was pretty bullshit in that regard.

12:51.000 --> 13:01.000
But, like, why are bots allowed to order these things? We've got to do more about bots ordering this shit.

13:01.000 --> 13:07.000
You gotta ask Nintendo, though, what's the point? Why even put out the system in the first place if you're not going to produce enough units?

13:07.000 --> 13:16.000
Why even make it? Like, if you're so, like, dissatisfied at the fact that people hacked the NES Classic, why even double down and put out a Super NES Classic?

13:16.000 --> 13:22.000
What the hell is the point if you're not going to produce enough units? Why are you even doing it to get Nintendo's name out there?

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
You already have your name out there with a bunch of other things.

13:24.000 --> 13:28.000
All you're doing is causing frustration because people are trying to give you money for this shit.

13:28.000 --> 13:32.000
You don't have the fucking Virtual Console anymore. It's not out.

13:32.000 --> 13:40.000
And whatever this other system that you're putting in place, which we still don't know fuck anything about, is still not here.

13:40.000 --> 13:48.000
Whenever the hell is that coming out, like, what the fuck are they doing? I mean, what's the point? Then don't manufacture that.

13:48.000 --> 13:53.000
If they can't prevent the bots, then you know what? They need to go the route of Toys R Us.

13:53.000 --> 14:00.000
And I'm actually going to applaud Toys R Us in this scenario. And the reason why I'm doing that is because Toys R Us just said, you know what? We're not taking pre-orders.

14:00.000 --> 14:09.000
It's only going to be available in store the day it comes out. And you know what? At least I know with that particular method, there's not going to be fucking bots.

14:09.000 --> 14:18.000
Will there be scalpers? Of course there will be. There's going to be crazy fucking people that get there early, early, early and are going to fuck it up in that capacity.

14:18.000 --> 14:24.000
But if every retailer was doing it this way, then those scalpers can't be at every single possible location.

14:24.000 --> 14:29.000
If they limit it to one person, then that end of it is only going to go so far.

14:29.000 --> 14:38.000
So I kind of think in that regard, Toys R Us is doing what they can, which is, you know what? We're not going to be able to handle the pre-order thing, so we're just not going to do it for anybody.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
And I think that's probably the best thing to do for them.

14:41.000 --> 14:50.000
Now as far as the scalper thing goes, here's the other thing. And I know I've ranted about this on the show before, so I'm going to try to just keep this brief, but I can't say this enough.

14:50.000 --> 14:57.000
You have to stop buying from scalpers. You don't need the system that bad.

14:57.000 --> 15:03.000
If Nintendo wants you to have one, you'll be able to get one through official channels.

15:03.000 --> 15:11.000
If the scalpers can't sell them, then they're not going to be shitting up the market with the bots and all this other stuff.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
It's a Linux computer running an emulator.

15:14.000 --> 15:20.000
They do this because, but it's still a collectible. Loki, that's in a way, I'm going to be real, that's an elitist defense.

15:20.000 --> 15:25.000
It's the whole like, well if you knew more about computers, you could do this and do this, all this stuff.

15:25.000 --> 15:31.000
Some people want the collectible. They still want it because it's an official Nintendo product, they want to go through the official channels.

15:31.000 --> 15:38.000
I still stand with you in the fact that before I buy from a scalper, I would do that.

15:38.000 --> 15:47.000
And I said that on a previous episode. I will steal the ROMs and put them on one of these little machines before I ever buy from a scalper.

15:47.000 --> 15:55.000
And you know what? If Nintendo decides to cut it off again before you're able to get one through official channels, hey, go for it.

15:55.000 --> 15:59.000
As much as I think piracy hurts things and all this stuff, go for it.

15:59.000 --> 16:05.000
I support you in doing that. If Nintendo is going to say, nope, nope, no more, we're going to end it, then go for it.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
That's kind of where my head is at with that.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
But anyway, you've got to stop buying from scalpers.

16:09.000 --> 16:18.000
And yes, I knew the whole argument about, well Rob, if I don't do it, someone's going to buy it and that whole thing, but you don't understand.

16:18.000 --> 16:27.000
You need to also tell other people and you need to be like, if somebody tells you, oh yeah, I got one through a scalper, dude, that's not cool.

16:27.000 --> 16:31.000
Like here I thought you were lucky, but you're just kind of, you're jerking the system.

16:31.000 --> 16:35.000
In the end though, you can't tell people what to do. End of story.

16:35.000 --> 16:40.000
I can't, but I'm going to say this is a problem as long as that exists.

16:40.000 --> 16:45.000
You are enabling. I can say you, you are free to do that, but you enabled this.

16:45.000 --> 16:52.000
But that's not the other part of it too. The whole thing is that there is going to be somebody, there's a sucker born every minute.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
Sure.

16:54.000 --> 17:03.000
You'd have to instead make it to where the scalping itself is more difficult.

17:03.000 --> 17:08.000
It's not necessarily the people that are doing it because people will go to extremes.

17:08.000 --> 17:12.000
We, hello, why does intervention exist? Okay.

17:12.000 --> 17:19.000
People will go to extremes. People will take advantage of people who will go to extremes.

17:19.000 --> 17:23.000
It's like dealing with an addict, right?

17:23.000 --> 17:29.000
You have to cut down the source of the addiction and then treat the problem.

17:29.000 --> 17:33.000
You have to get somebody clean before you can treat their problem.

17:33.000 --> 17:37.000
And so you'd have to instead target the scalpers.

17:37.000 --> 17:42.000
And, you know, ostracize them, chase them out, send law enforcement after them.

17:42.000 --> 17:46.000
If you see it happening, report it if you want something to be done about it.

17:46.000 --> 17:49.000
Don't go attacking the people who are being taken advantage of.

17:49.000 --> 17:55.000
I agree to an extent. There's kind of like a pyramid of responsibility here.

17:55.000 --> 17:59.000
The person most at fault in this scenario is Nintendo, period.

17:59.000 --> 18:04.000
Nintendo is creating this fucking problem. Nintendo needs to fucking fix it.

18:04.000 --> 18:08.000
And journalists out there need to hold them fucking accountable for this and the NES Classic.

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
How about this? This also will help too.

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
All the media sites out there talking about how quickly this shit sells out

18:14.000 --> 18:19.000
and running all these stupid articles about how the system's selling out

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
and Nintendo is being ridiculous for this stuff.

18:22.000 --> 18:26.000
Just stop covering it. Stop giving them the fucking attention.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
They create this circus so the circus is covered.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
There's no money in that.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
But people click on those stories, unfortunately.

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
So the pyramid of responsibility. Nintendo, number one.

18:36.000 --> 18:40.000
The websites, number two. And they need to fix that and they need to prevent the bots and all that.

18:40.000 --> 18:45.000
But ultimately, the people creating the demand have responsibility.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
And I'm pointing that out.

18:46.000 --> 18:51.000
But that's leading back to the revenue generated on those clickbait websites.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
Agreed.

18:52.000 --> 18:57.000
So that's also leading back to Nintendo seeing that this is a potential money maker by building hype.

18:57.000 --> 19:04.000
It's more or less, in the long run, if you really want to point to the true blame and everything,

19:04.000 --> 19:10.000
it's the fact that we are living in a fairly uncontrolled capitalist society.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
It's capitalism. Pure and simple.

19:12.000 --> 19:15.000
It goes back to the same philosophy.

19:15.000 --> 19:20.000
You know, you create the demand and you do whatever you can to keep the demand going.

19:20.000 --> 19:27.000
Which creates revenue, which lines pockets, which then goes back into the economy, blah blah blah.

19:27.000 --> 19:35.000
I'm not going to go into the year and a half of economics I shoved in my brain.

19:35.000 --> 19:43.000
But it really is more of a societal urge.

19:43.000 --> 19:48.000
And I do agree with that, which is why when it came to the NES Classic, I said,

19:48.000 --> 19:52.000
OK, I'm not able to get one through normal means. I don't need one that bad.

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
I'm not going to buy one. I'm not going to go through these other channels to do it.

19:55.000 --> 20:00.000
And it's the same thing if, for whatever reason, the Super Nintendo thing falls through and I'm not able to get one through normal means.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
I don't need one that bad.

20:02.000 --> 20:07.000
And see, it's more or less a conditioning of society in general.

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
We are conditioned, well, look at the 80s, OK?

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
Let's just stop right there and look at the fucking 80s.

20:13.000 --> 20:17.000
Everything, it was me, me, me, I need to have, I need to acquire.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
Look at the movies that were out then.

20:19.000 --> 20:23.000
You know, how materialism was really pushed.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
And our society is built on a sense of materialism.

20:25.000 --> 20:28.000
Our whole economy is built on materialism.

20:28.000 --> 20:33.000
Acquire, acquire, gain this. If you have this and no one else does, you're special.

20:33.000 --> 20:40.000
And to point blame and to say, how do we fix this?

20:40.000 --> 20:44.000
The only fix is re-educating people.

20:44.000 --> 20:51.000
And what I was trying to say with the whole putting the people who buy these things from scalpers responsible is I'm just trying to say,

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
oh, you got that from a scalper? You're not special.

20:54.000 --> 20:57.000
And that's what I'm going to say.

20:57.000 --> 21:02.000
And that's just, you know, what I'm choosing to do as a response is that that enables that whole thing.

21:02.000 --> 21:05.000
So if you got it from a scalper, you're not special.

21:05.000 --> 21:09.000
And just the thing that I think needs to be a bigger push in society.

21:09.000 --> 21:13.000
And I hate to phrase it this way, but I think it's the first step.

21:13.000 --> 21:20.000
The first thing that people need to understand in their hearts that will stop pretty much all of this from going on

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
is that the things that you own, own you.

21:23.000 --> 21:27.000
Let me go to some comments from our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

21:27.000 --> 21:30.000
SSG100Matt says, we're getting too deep here.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
She right though.

21:32.000 --> 21:38.000
Also, come on, Noel Gustin Chat says, if I'm lucky enough to find one at the retail price, then we'll probably buy it.

21:38.000 --> 21:43.000
I refuse to even consider buying one of those crazy ass $300 ThinkGeek bundles.

21:43.000 --> 21:49.000
Oh, my God. I mean, let's just put that on the list of reasons why I don't set foot in a GameStop anymore.

21:49.000 --> 21:54.000
Because I don't need that soon to be on dollar store shelves merchandise.

21:54.000 --> 21:58.000
See, here's why they do that with hardware.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
Hardware, there is no margin.

22:00.000 --> 22:04.000
It's like literally two bucks, you lose that in shipping.

22:04.000 --> 22:08.000
So you're literally selling that either at cost or at a loss.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
You make it up with software.

22:10.000 --> 22:14.000
These systems though, I don't know if that same kind of margin exists.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
I would think that it doesn't.

22:16.000 --> 22:21.000
I would be willing to bet that the hardware that's in these new ones are probably the same as the old ones.

22:21.000 --> 22:26.000
So the extra $20 that they've made up there, I mean, there's got to be some margin in there.

22:26.000 --> 22:32.000
But, let's just say assuming that it's like that, that's why they throw this extra crap in there.

22:32.000 --> 22:37.000
Then again, this is also GameStop, so they just do it because they're also greedy as fuck as well.

22:37.000 --> 22:41.000
Because they know people will be tempted and people will buy it.

22:42.000 --> 22:45.000
It's not really just them.

22:45.000 --> 22:48.000
It's every company out there.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
They know people want it.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
They'll do what they can to make people want it.

22:51.000 --> 22:54.000
And then they'll do whatever they take to get the money out of them.

22:54.000 --> 23:00.000
That's not solely for one company versus others.

23:00.000 --> 23:03.000
In the end, they all have the same goal, get your money.

23:03.000 --> 23:10.000
We have to really encourage ourselves to fight that instinct of, I'll be a special snowflake if I have one.

23:10.000 --> 23:16.000
And we have to fight that instinct and say, you know what, it's not worth buying this crap bundle from ThinkGeek to get one.

23:16.000 --> 23:21.000
If I can find one at retail price on my terms, the consumer's terms, then cool.

23:21.000 --> 23:24.000
But if I can't find that, then fuck it.

23:24.000 --> 23:27.000
We just have someone who lets us know when they get them in.

23:27.000 --> 23:30.000
So that's how we got our nest.

23:30.000 --> 23:37.000
And on top of that, our legit reason for not really needing it, having the Star Fox 2 would be cool.

23:37.000 --> 23:46.000
But our thought, the reason, the only reason that we wanted one is so that we could have the digital hookup without having the lag with our HDTV.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
Yeah, HDMI, that whole thing.

23:47.000 --> 23:52.000
So that was, that's really our sole reason for really wanting it at all.

23:52.000 --> 23:57.000
But other than that, we've got a SNES and we have an EverDrive.

23:57.000 --> 24:02.000
In the long run, SNES plus EverDrive equals all of this shit.

24:02.000 --> 24:06.000
But think about how short sighted this shit is with these systems.

24:06.000 --> 24:18.000
I mean, seriously, like they should just be releasing a virtual console system that can tap into the eShop to buy virtual console games or that can subscribe to that service and then push that shit out there like crazy.

24:18.000 --> 24:22.000
Because that's what fucking Netflix and these other companies do.

24:22.000 --> 24:25.000
Like they literally will pay for the system.

24:25.000 --> 24:35.000
Like if you're signing up for example, like Sling or something like that, they will literally give you a credit for the device that plays that shit on your TV.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
They make money on planned obsolescence.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
So do what Microsoft's doing.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
Because they have the Xbox game anywhere thing now.

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
That plays a lot of the 360 games for Xbox One, right?

24:45.000 --> 24:53.000
Well, even more so because like this is more for like, you'll get as many systems out there because then you can get people paying you even more money.

24:53.000 --> 24:56.000
If you're worried about that, you're not making enough of a margin off of these systems.

24:56.000 --> 25:03.000
Like let's just say Nintendo, let's just throw it out there that Nintendo is not producing a lot of these because they're not making money off of them.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
They're kind of coming at a loss or something like that.

25:05.000 --> 25:11.000
Whatever. Which is still their stupid idea because they're producing them so who they have the blame for that themselves.

25:11.000 --> 25:19.000
But it's another opportunity to get more money and at the same time people will be able to buy more games.

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
People want to put more ROMs on there.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Learn from your fucking users.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
People bought them and they wanted more ROMs on there.

25:24.000 --> 25:28.000
Okay, cool. Give them an opportunity to purchase more ROMs.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
What is the problem?

25:30.000 --> 25:33.000
But do it cheaply. Add like bundles and shit.

25:33.000 --> 25:36.000
So that way it's more of an impulse buy.

25:36.000 --> 25:40.000
It ended up like how it is with my PlayStation Network library, my Steam library.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
Where it's like, oh hey that looks cool.

25:42.000 --> 25:46.000
I buy it, I may not play it, but I don't even think about it.

25:46.000 --> 25:49.000
I just like, oh that's a great deal, I'm gonna pick that up.

25:49.000 --> 25:52.000
And it's just so easy for me to drop money on that stuff.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
Make it that easy.

25:53.000 --> 25:58.000
Instead of this fucking obstacle course of shit that you're making it for all these users.

25:58.000 --> 26:01.000
Because eventually people are gonna get fucking tired of your shit.

26:01.000 --> 26:07.000
Alright, well look, I don't want too much salt in the opening moments of Orange Lounge Radio here tonight.

26:07.000 --> 26:12.000
But I think the reality is that a lot of people, again, most people couldn't get one this week.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
I think there is a lot of saltiness out there right now.

26:14.000 --> 26:20.000
So I think we've all been able to vent a little bit and I hope Nintendo can figure it the hell out.

26:20.000 --> 26:24.000
But at the same time I hope the industry can kind of hold Nintendo accountable.

26:24.000 --> 26:31.000
And I hope people in the journalism arena will ask Nintendo some of these hard questions about why do you keep doing this to your fans.

26:31.000 --> 26:34.000
And they'll fucking dodge it like Reggie does every fucking time.

26:34.000 --> 26:37.000
Everybody plays so fucking nice and plays into this.

26:37.000 --> 26:41.000
And we need some people out there that will ask harder questions.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
It's just ridiculous.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
I'll be the asshole to ask questions.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
But we all know what happens.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
I know the chat comments are about to come in.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
And this is why Reggie never comes on your show.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
I understand. But I need other people.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
Well, he also doesn't know we exist.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
I need other people out there.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
Somebody got two questions.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
That was Rama. An event got two questions. Remember that?

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
We had an exclusive interview.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
But anyway, all that joking aside.

27:05.000 --> 27:08.000
People need to fucking hold Nintendo accountable.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
Look, I get it. We all love Nintendo products.

27:10.000 --> 27:13.000
They've created some of the most memorable characters over the years.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
They create some damn addicting games.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
I get it. But at the same time,

27:17.000 --> 27:21.000
this hardware shortage shit has been going on since the 90s.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
And they know it works.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
They're exploiting your love. Seriously.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
It's a tried and true tactic.

27:28.000 --> 27:32.000
It's time for people to stand up and shut it down, for God's sake.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
It's a fucking abusive relationship.

27:34.000 --> 27:37.000
Rob, are we going to break the wheel?

27:37.000 --> 27:40.000
Nintendo's on top. Then Sega's on top.

27:41.000 --> 27:44.000
Anyway, well Sonic Mania is pretty good on the Switch, though.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
Now where does that put us?

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
Alright, look. Anyway.

27:49.000 --> 27:52.000
Well, Sonic Mania was made by Sonic fans anyway.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
That is very true. Very true.

27:54.000 --> 27:58.000
Anyway, we're going to go ahead and move on with the show

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
and get into our gaming weeks.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
So what types of video games have you been playing this week?

28:02.000 --> 28:05.000
Did you revisit a Super Nintendo classic this week?

28:05.000 --> 28:06.000
Or has it been something else?

28:06.000 --> 28:07.000
I did.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
How about that? Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

28:09.000 --> 28:13.000
I did. I played Super Mario World last night.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
Because someone's like, well, you do the level.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
And I'm like, okay, I'll do the level. Fuck.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
And did the level. And guess what?

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
You did the thing.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.000
I was fussing because I was like,

28:22.000 --> 28:25.000
why didn't you go get the green Switch house or Switch block?

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
And they're like, oh, we haven't gotten there yet.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
I was like, well, give it to me. I'll do it.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
And I didn't do it.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
But I did clean the level instead.

28:31.000 --> 28:34.000
And then I tripped over the cable and unplugged the Super Nintendo.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
And that was my Super Nintendo-ing.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
What level was it? Now you got me curious.

28:39.000 --> 28:42.000
It was like early on in the game.

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
We had just started.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
Oh, okay.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
And then I played all my iOS stuff.

28:48.000 --> 28:51.000
So not really a whole bunch of anything.

28:51.000 --> 28:55.000
I still have yet to reinstall my Mass Effect Andromeda

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
since it got fucked up.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
Oh, yes.

28:59.000 --> 29:02.000
And they have that patch now, the last patch,

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
Cody Fingers, that I suppose is worth visiting.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
I need to sit down with that again on PlayStation 4

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
now that it's where it's at.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
Because I kind of said, all right,

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
if they're going to keep making changes to this game,

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
I'm going to step away from it for a little while.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
And I'll come back when all the patches are there.

29:15.000 --> 29:18.000
Well, now that they're there, I really do owe the game

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
a complete playthrough.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
I was near the end, but I just didn't finish it.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
Well, although it was funny.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
I was actually thinking about a YouTuber

29:26.000 --> 29:29.000
yesterday at lunch who does,

29:29.000 --> 29:32.000
in fact, trying to get him on the show,

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
Game Tim, who does cooking with Cookie Mama.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
Yeah, I think we were talking to him,

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
but then our unexpected hiatus came up.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
So we're going to work that out. Yeah.

29:39.000 --> 29:42.000
I went to get Korean food yesterday,

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
and I'm going to mispronounce it,

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
but I think it's called Haemil Peijong,

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
which is like a seafood pancake.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
And he did that on Cooking with Cookie Mama.

29:50.000 --> 29:53.000
And I was like, oh, that makes me think about his channel.

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
And I was like, I'm a nerd.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
Yes, you are. All right.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
It was pretty fun.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
All right.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
That's really the extent of my gaming week.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
Let's check in with Loki. How was your gaming week?

30:04.000 --> 30:07.000
First off, I'd like to say dinner is fucking terrible,

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
and I threw it away.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
I took one bite of that,

30:11.000 --> 30:14.000
and you'll definitely be able to relate with this.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
I took a bite of the hamburger.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
All I could taste,

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
and I'm going to try not to make you sick here,

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
warm mayonnaise.

30:22.000 --> 30:25.000
Yeah, exactly. I threw it fucking away.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
Just, no. Yeah.

30:27.000 --> 30:30.000
That's why I always... French fries were fucking stale,

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
and somehow this tastes like diet root beer,

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
which I don't think they have,

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
but it tastes like fucking watered-down shit.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
Do you need juice or something from the fridge?

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
You know what, though?

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
At the very least, I got a vanilla milkshake from them,

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
and that was good.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
All right, at least there's that.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
So I'm going to have vanilla milkshake for dinner.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
That'll be fucking dinner.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
Anyways, so no actual games.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
I did play an actual game this week.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
I went back to my Steam library

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
because I had been watching the movie,

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
and I built the Legos and stuff,

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
so I went and played the Lego movie video game,

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
and actually found out that was pretty fun.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
I mean, honestly, they're all about the same.

31:06.000 --> 31:09.000
Tons of clips thrown in from the movie and stuff.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
You know, lots of humor.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
It's kind of funny.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
I enjoyed it, so I played a little bit of that.

31:15.000 --> 31:20.000
And then I actually didn't play a whole lot of other things.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
I thought about putting on...

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
I was actually going to play some VR stuff this week,

31:24.000 --> 31:27.000
but then my wife wanted to watch TV,

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
and so that kind of...

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
Well, now that I think of it, what the fuck?

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
I would have a VR headset,

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
but it doesn't really matter.

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
Oh, whatever. Hindsight.

31:37.000 --> 31:41.000
So I ended up researching on how to set up a Raspberry Pi

31:41.000 --> 31:45.000
for RetroPie, so I've been downloading everything for that

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
since I have a Raspberry Pi to do that.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
Just haven't gotten around to it.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
Although, I do need to fix my 3D printer

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
to print a shell for it

31:53.000 --> 31:56.000
so that it has something to sit on for now.

31:56.000 --> 31:59.000
I mean, because I probably need to put it in something

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
so it doesn't short itself out.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
And then just, you know, selfling games.

32:04.000 --> 32:07.000
And, you know, that's about it, pretty much.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
Okay.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
My gaming week.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
So there is a new game I played this week.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
Mostly been a lot of the same old, like, classics

32:15.000 --> 32:16.000
that I play all the time,

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
but I did play one new game this week,

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
and in fact, it was the game that I played

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
after Orange Lounge Radio last week,

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
because usually on Sunday nights,

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
right after Orange Lounge Radio is finished,

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
I'll go on my Twitch channel and I'll play something.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
We've done things like Splatoon and Mario Kart

32:30.000 --> 32:31.000
that I play with viewers,

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
but last week I was like,

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
well, I want to do, I want to do, like, an indie game

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
and I've been hearing a lot about this game,

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
so let's do, like, a new game

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
and me play it for the first time.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
So the game I did after the show last week

32:41.000 --> 32:44.000
was a game called 20XX, or 20XX.

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
Oh yeah, that looks pretty good.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
2000XX, I'm not sure how you...

32:47.000 --> 32:50.000
20XX, it's just like in Mega Man 2?

32:50.000 --> 32:51.000
Yeah, in the intro.

32:51.000 --> 32:52.000
20XD6.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
Yeah, yeah, basically, 20XDX.

32:54.000 --> 32:57.000
Oh yeah, I think I'm going to call it that, 20XDX.

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
But anyway, that was the game I played,

32:59.000 --> 33:00.000
and it's really cool.

33:00.000 --> 33:03.000
Yeah, it's basically, it's a Mega Man-ish game

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
and there's a lot, like, even in the intro sequences.

33:05.000 --> 33:06.000
Roguelite, I guess.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
Wow, there's a lot.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
Yeah, it's a Mega Man roguelike.

33:09.000 --> 33:13.000
So instead of necessarily picking the different boss stages,

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
you kind of start in the first level

33:15.000 --> 33:16.000
and you're going through,

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
and if you're able to survive all the way to the boss,

33:18.000 --> 33:19.000
then you fight the boss,

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
and then you can pick, do you want the boss weapon

33:21.000 --> 33:24.000
or do you want, you know, extra currency

33:24.000 --> 33:27.000
or, like, extra energy pack or something?

33:27.000 --> 33:30.000
And then you can pick one of three branching paths

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
and you will see who the boss is and what the stage is,

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
but then you kind of have to go from there.

33:34.000 --> 33:35.000
And each level that you go,

33:35.000 --> 33:38.000
the difficulty of the level starts to amp up a little bit.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
But then once you die, you're dead

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
and you're back to the central hub,

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
where, like a lot of roguelikes,

33:43.000 --> 33:46.000
if you've ever played things like Rogue Legacy,

33:46.000 --> 33:47.000
Crypt of the Necrodancer, you know,

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
all these games have a very similar formula.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
So once you die, you go back to the hub

33:51.000 --> 33:54.000
where you can buy, like, sometimes temporary power-ups,

33:54.000 --> 33:55.000
good for your next run,

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
permanent power-ups, which will help you

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
and give you an advantage the next time.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
And then that's how, the next time you play,

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
you can hopefully go a little further in the game.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
So, and there's even more to this game

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
that I didn't even really get a chance to explore.

34:07.000 --> 34:08.000
Like, I know there's co-op in it,

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
didn't even really touch that.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
There's challenge modes available in it

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
that I didn't really get a chance to touch,

34:13.000 --> 34:16.000
just because I have been enjoying the single-player campaign

34:16.000 --> 34:19.000
and I had a great time streaming that on Twitch last week

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
and it seemed like a lot of you really responded to that, too.

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
I think some of you told me you were gonna buy it.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
So I was like, tell the developers.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
Maybe they don't want to come on OLR.

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
Well, that's, you know, this is like

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
kind of what Mighty No. 9 should have been.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
Yes, actually, yes.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
And so a lot of people responding very positively to this game,

34:35.000 --> 34:38.000
and I gotta say, you know, I mean, is it perfect?

34:38.000 --> 34:42.000
I mean, no, because sometimes the randomness of the levels

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
does feel a little bit,

34:44.000 --> 34:48.000
I feel like I'm doing some of the same-sy jumping patterns

34:48.000 --> 34:49.000
and some of these things, like, over and over,

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
which, you know, in a regular Mega Man game,

34:51.000 --> 34:54.000
you expect that, because Mega Man's all about fucking patterns.

34:54.000 --> 34:57.000
But in a roguelike, you kind of hope there'd be a little more randomness.

34:57.000 --> 35:00.000
But I'm really, I'm being very nitpicky with that statement.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
I think, overall, I am enjoying it,

35:02.000 --> 35:06.000
and overall, like, the, you know, just the discovery of the game

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
and going a little deeper every time and some of the boss fights

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
and how they can change and be different.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
Like, I just, I was really enjoying it.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
And here's the other thing.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
The price is great. It was only 12 bucks.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
Now, I think I bought it on some type of launch week sale

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
that's probably not there anymore,

35:20.000 --> 35:23.000
but I think the quote-unquote real price is like $15.99.

35:23.000 --> 35:26.000
Like, I don't think it's much more expensive than what I paid for it.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
So I recommend it.

35:28.000 --> 35:32.000
Like, if you like Mega Man and you like roguelikes, you know,

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
I know some people that are like,

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
I hate roguelikes, but I kind of feel like

35:36.000 --> 35:41.000
you're dismissing a really broad genre by saying you hate roguelikes.

35:41.000 --> 35:42.000
You know what I mean?

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
Like, is there one or two that you play that you didn't like

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
and you're kind of dismissing the genre?

35:46.000 --> 35:49.000
Because I kind of think your love of Mega Man

35:49.000 --> 35:52.000
will erase any reservations you have about roguelikes.

35:52.000 --> 35:53.000
Does that make sense?

35:53.000 --> 35:54.000
Yeah.

35:54.000 --> 35:57.000
Like, the Mega Man aspect is much more than the rogue side of it.

35:57.000 --> 36:01.000
So that's kind of my thoughts on it.

36:01.000 --> 36:05.000
Looking in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com,

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
just trying to see, Stoppy says,

36:07.000 --> 36:10.000
I've been playing 20XDX since Early Access.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
It's great. They've come a long way.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
The improvements were notable.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
It's funny to think Mighty No. 9 backers

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
would have been happier with this tribute game.

36:18.000 --> 36:22.000
Sjoan Hunter-Matt says Mighty No. 9 didn't have to be like 20XDX.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
Mighty No. 9 is great on its own.

36:24.000 --> 36:27.000
It's just the delay saga poisoned the game for everyone.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
Give Mighty No. 9 a chance.

36:29.000 --> 36:33.000
So, and actually, I still have, I got Mighty No. 9.

36:33.000 --> 36:34.000
I don't know if it was in a humblebo-

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
No, I bought it on a Steam sale.

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
It was like five bucks during a Steam sale.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
I just, I still haven't played it yet.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
So, that's also on my list of things.

36:41.000 --> 36:44.000
You know, because I value what some of our longtime listeners

36:44.000 --> 36:47.000
like Sjoan Hunter-Matt, who's been listening for years and years, say.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
And if he says, you know what, you really need to just like

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
don't listen to this hype and just give it a chance.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.000
I'm willing to give it a chance.

36:52.000 --> 36:55.000
And it's, it probably really isn't as bad as most people say,

36:55.000 --> 36:58.000
but it's probably also not quite the Mega Man clone game

36:58.000 --> 36:59.000
people were hoping for.

36:59.000 --> 37:02.000
But maybe if you were disappointed in Mighty No. 9,

37:02.000 --> 37:05.000
maybe there'll be something in 20XDX that will work for you.

37:05.000 --> 37:08.000
You know? And maybe the reverse is even true.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
If you really do hate roguelikes that much

37:10.000 --> 37:13.000
and 20XDX doesn't work for you, maybe Mighty No. 9,

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
you should give a second chance, if that makes sense.

37:15.000 --> 37:19.000
So, but anyway, overall, my opinion on 20XDX, very favorable,

37:19.000 --> 37:22.000
especially because of the fact that it is such a low cost.

37:22.000 --> 37:25.000
It does feel more homegrown and indie developed.

37:25.000 --> 37:28.000
I think it's a very like fleshed out great game

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
and it's definitely worth a look if you're into that genre at all.

37:30.000 --> 37:36.000
My only concern, I hope it's not too close to Mega Man

37:36.000 --> 37:39.000
where Capcom's gonna rear their head.

37:39.000 --> 37:42.000
I hope, instead, Capcom may see the message here

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
from the success of this game and go,

37:44.000 --> 37:47.000
maybe we shouldn't have canceled Mega Man Universe

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
because maybe that's what that game was supposed to be.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.000
I don't know.

37:50.000 --> 37:53.000
But maybe we should revisit this franchise

37:53.000 --> 37:57.000
because I bet if Capcom did an official Mega Man release,

37:57.000 --> 37:58.000
and I mean new release,

37:58.000 --> 38:01.000
I don't mean yet another legacy collection with some...

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
Just do like a Sonic Mania release.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
Yeah. Seriously. Seriously.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.000
Well, they've done that before.

38:06.000 --> 38:09.000
Capcom should listen the fuck up to how people respond to Sonic Mania.

38:09.000 --> 38:13.000
Didn't they have a free Mega Man Street Fighter game or something like that?

38:13.000 --> 38:14.000
Yeah, but that wasn't even Capcom.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
I think Capcom kind of blessed it.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
I think they had to.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
I think Capcom kind of said,

38:19.000 --> 38:23.000
we're gonna just kind of turn around and not really pay attention to this.

38:23.000 --> 38:26.000
No, I think they may have even endorsed it on their blog.

38:26.000 --> 38:27.000
They did on their blog.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
They did. So I guess they didn't acknowledge it.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
But I think it was one of those very clear like,

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
this is a fan game, we're allowing it.

38:33.000 --> 38:37.000
So maybe because of that, that sets a good precedent

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
that Capcom is not gonna try to shut this down.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
And I hope they don't.

38:41.000 --> 38:44.000
And I think there are enough differences where if it...

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
I mean the whole fact that it isn't...

38:46.000 --> 38:49.000
It's not taking away from anything that they're doing.

38:49.000 --> 38:52.000
If anything, it's making people more excited about their games.

38:52.000 --> 38:57.000
The fact that it is a roguelike does change the basics of the game dramatically.

38:57.000 --> 39:00.000
And I think that's enough to get it out of any hot water with Capcom.

39:00.000 --> 39:04.000
I think the fact that it is a roguelike is going to kind of separate it enough.

39:04.000 --> 39:07.000
Because like I said, the original Mega Man games

39:07.000 --> 39:10.000
are all about memorizing those fucking patterns on how to get through the level.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
You can't really do that with this game.

39:12.000 --> 39:15.000
So I mean there are some of those fundamental differences there.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
You know what would be awesome is like a Mega Man game

39:17.000 --> 39:22.000
where you have like power-ups from other like Capcom characters.

39:22.000 --> 39:25.000
Like you know the Bionic arm from Bionic Commando.

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
Well remember in that early Mega Man universe trailer

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
there was the whole like Ryu showed up.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
Or Mega Man threw a fireball or something.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
Yeah, but that's been there since like X.

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
So I mean, I don't know.

39:35.000 --> 39:36.000
Yeah, who knows. Who knows.

39:36.000 --> 39:39.000
So anyway, that was the new game I played this week and I enjoyed.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
Otherwise it's just been kind of like old favorites.

39:41.000 --> 39:45.000
Still been playing Overwatch, Final Fantasy XIV, Diablo III.

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
I randomly played Heroes of the Storm again.

39:47.000 --> 39:48.000
I don't know. Oh, I know what it was.

39:48.000 --> 39:52.000
I was watching my buddy Delvin who does another podcast called Video Game Realness.

39:52.000 --> 39:55.000
They don't put out a ton of episodes. They put out one recently.

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
And he also does some video game streaming out there.

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
So I was watching his channel and he was playing League of Legends

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
and we were having a little bit of a chat about League of Legends.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
I was kind of talking about some of my hesitations with that game.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
But he was having fun with it.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.000
And it did kind of make me go,

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
well maybe I should see what's going on in Heroes of the Storm.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.000
It's been a little while.

40:09.000 --> 40:14.000
And now that there's no like active play this game a lot to get a D.Va suit

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
or you know some of those things that Blizzard was doing

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
to get more people to play Heroes of the Storm.

40:18.000 --> 40:22.000
I feel like I can just kind of go into an AI game and just play it and be satisfied.

40:22.000 --> 40:25.000
And I'm doing those little quests to earn a little bit of gold.

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
And I'm perfectly content doing that.

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
And I don't feel pressure because it's not PvP.

40:29.000 --> 40:32.000
And you know, yeah, I'm having fun.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
So I'm not playing a lot of it.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
But I'm playing just enough to kind of go,

40:36.000 --> 40:40.000
oh yeah, this is a fun little different type of game to play to decompress a little bit.

40:40.000 --> 40:44.000
And who knows, maybe in the coming weeks I will feel adventurous enough

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
that I'll go in and I'll try a PvP match again.

40:46.000 --> 40:50.000
Just right now I'm a little bit hesitant on that with Heroes of the Storm.

40:50.000 --> 40:53.000
But I wanted to see, they actually put D.Va in as a hero in Heroes of the Storm.

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
I think they put Genji in too.

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
They put some more Warcraft and Starcraft characters

40:57.000 --> 41:01.000
because Starcraft got its remaster.

41:01.000 --> 41:04.000
That whole thing came out so, you know, people are paying attention to that.

41:04.000 --> 41:09.000
I'm super curious, you know, starting this week actually,

41:09.000 --> 41:12.000
I don't think it's on our showroll so I think I'm okay to talk about this.

41:12.000 --> 41:17.000
Starting this week, the Destiny 2, if you pre-, not even pre-ordered it people,

41:17.000 --> 41:21.000
pre-purchased it, meaning you already gave them the full money,

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
you would be able to play the beta.

41:23.000 --> 41:29.000
Well no, you get, I'm sorry, you get one day early access to the open beta.

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
So if you pre-purchase you get that one day

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
and then the open beta is like the 29th through the,

41:33.000 --> 41:37.000
I can't do the open beta because I fly out of town early morning on Thursday,

41:37.000 --> 41:38.000
I can't do it.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
So the beta won't be open, I won't be able to play it.

41:40.000 --> 41:46.000
But of course Destiny 2 on PC is going to be in the Battle.net interface.

41:46.000 --> 41:52.000
So that begs the question, would they go so far as to include a Destiny character

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
in Heroes of the Storm?

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
I know some Blizzard people are like, shut up,

41:56.000 --> 41:59.000
because Destiny is an Activision game, or a Bungie game,

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
it's not a Blizzard game.

42:01.000 --> 42:06.000
And I'm like, well, that's not stopping them from showing up on Battle.net.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
That's the first date.

42:08.000 --> 42:11.000
That's first base.

42:11.000 --> 42:14.000
Who knows, Destiny 2 might get to second or third base.

42:14.000 --> 42:18.000
Is third base having a skin in your collector's edition

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
for like a World of Warcraft expansion or something?

42:20.000 --> 42:24.000
I don't know, I think a home run would just be straight up like

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
Blizzard develops Destiny 3.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
I don't know, I'm going crazy.

42:28.000 --> 42:32.000
But I think I wouldn't completely shut the door to that.

42:32.000 --> 42:35.000
I mean, it is still all Activision at the end of the day, who knows.

42:35.000 --> 42:38.000
ActDef suggests skins for Overwatch, maybe.

42:38.000 --> 42:41.000
So maybe not characters, but maybe like an icon,

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
or one of those like sprays, or a banner,

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
maybe something a little more cosmetic.

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
I could see that.

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
I could definitely be something, so we'll see.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
Anyhow, let's move on.

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
We're going to get into some more gaming news,

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
but I do want to do some quick housekeeping and announcements

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
here at the top of the show.

42:57.000 --> 43:01.000
Quickly, I do want to mention that we're not going to be here next week.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
This is a planned week off.

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
I've been saying this for forever.

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
But it is Labor Day weekend coming up,

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
which means we're going to be at Dragon Con.

43:09.000 --> 43:12.000
Sadly, Dark Soccer and Loki aren't able to take the trip out to Atlanta,

43:12.000 --> 43:15.000
but this is going to be like my fifth Dragon Con.

43:15.000 --> 43:18.000
I'm excited to be there with some of my other friends

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
from the Voice of Geeks Network,

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
including Bobby Blackwell will be there,

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
and Jon from Critical Myth is going to be there,

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
Gary from Critical Myth is going to be there,

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
Brian from British Invaders is going to be there.

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
That's everyone that I know of that's going,

43:30.000 --> 43:33.000
and sometimes I run into random people.

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
On that Sunday, though, for people who can't make it,

43:35.000 --> 43:38.000
if you're in the Sacramento area, is the Rainbow Festival.

43:38.000 --> 43:42.000
So come downtown and show your support.

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
So no full LR next week either,

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
because you're going to be busy with that, right?

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
I probably will be back late enough,

43:48.000 --> 43:52.000
or in enough time that I might be able to stream that night.

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
Don't they have Tiffany or something performing?

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
They have 80s. I think they have Tiffany or something.

43:56.000 --> 43:57.000
I'll have to look again.

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
Yeah, I saw that and I laughed.

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
I was like, I would totally go to this if I was going to be in town.

44:01.000 --> 44:04.000
But if I'm right, I think the main stage is hosted by

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
Taron Through You again.

44:06.000 --> 44:09.000
Last year we had Detox, which was really cool.

44:09.000 --> 44:12.000
Yeah, I've seen Taron. She's a local drag queen.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
I've seen her at Badlands before. She's good. She's good.

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
A lot of fun.

44:16.000 --> 44:20.000
I hope I'm not wrong on this, but I think she's an older queen too.

44:20.000 --> 44:23.000
So I think she gives old people like me hope.

44:23.000 --> 44:26.000
Anyway, my schedule at Dragon Con,

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
for those of you who are going to be meeting me in Atlanta,

44:28.000 --> 44:32.000
you can check out one of four panels I'm going to be on at Dragon Con.

44:32.000 --> 44:35.000
You can check out a panel called It's Just a Game,

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
Social Contracts and Multiplayer Gaming.

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
These are all, by the way, on the podcast track.

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
So this does tie into podcasting.

44:41.000 --> 44:44.000
That's going to be on a Friday at 1 p.m.

44:44.000 --> 44:47.000
And I'm going to be joined by Bobby and Paul and Dennis

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
from Giant Size Team Up.

44:49.000 --> 44:52.000
And we're going to have a talk about implied social contracts

44:52.000 --> 44:55.000
and multiplayer gaming from the tabletop to the video screen.

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
So that's going to be interesting, kind of like how that

44:57.000 --> 45:00.000
those social dynamics kind of translate into

45:00.000 --> 45:03.000
what we're doing here in podcasting and so forth.

45:03.000 --> 45:04.000
I think that could be very interesting.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
So we're going to talk about that on Friday.

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
Then I have a couple panels on Saturday.

45:08.000 --> 45:11.000
On Saturday, we're going to be on this panel called,

45:11.000 --> 45:14.000
and I say we because Bobby's going to be on this as well,

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
a panel called Getting the Word Out,

45:16.000 --> 45:19.000
Introducing Your Show to an Ever-Evolving Internet.

45:19.000 --> 45:22.000
And, you know, since we've been doing OLR for 15 years,

45:22.000 --> 45:25.000
we've seen Skype come and rise up.

45:25.000 --> 45:28.000
We've seen Twitter come. We've seen Myspace come and go.

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
We've seen, you know, Facebook rise up.

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
So, you know, you kind of have to adjust to new social networks

45:32.000 --> 45:33.000
as they come up.

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
Twitch will be another big one, you know,

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
and kind of cater the promotion to your show

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
and kind of stay ahead of the curve on this stuff.

45:39.000 --> 45:43.000
Are you saying that GeoCities page is no longer good to get the word out?

45:43.000 --> 45:47.000
It's probably as effective as continuing to use Windows XP to do your show.

45:47.000 --> 45:51.000
Anyway, I will be joined on that panel by, of course,

45:51.000 --> 45:54.000
Bobby, our friend Charles McFall from the Pokemon Go podcast,

45:54.000 --> 45:57.000
Dennis Lee Robinson, and Justin Robert Young,

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
who you guys know him from Night Attack,

45:59.000 --> 46:00.000
if you ever heard that show.

46:00.000 --> 46:04.000
So, I'm very honored to be on a panel with him and all those guys.

46:04.000 --> 46:08.000
Broadcasting and new media will be the other panel I'm on Saturday at 4 o'clock.

46:08.000 --> 46:12.000
That is going to be a discussion where I'm going to be joined by Jay Patrick,

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
who's a radio broadcast vet of 20 years.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
He's actually a program director for iHeartRadio,

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
so that'll be really cool.

46:18.000 --> 46:21.000
Oh, sorry, been a program director for iHeartRadio,

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
Cumulus Media, and Saga Communications.

46:23.000 --> 46:26.000
And so we'll talk a little bit about, you know, the on-air presence,

46:26.000 --> 46:29.000
choosing your equipment, and talent best practices.

46:29.000 --> 46:32.000
I have no idea what business I have being on this panel.

46:32.000 --> 46:35.000
We use the very sophisticated Windows XP.

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
I know, I'm like, wait a minute.

46:37.000 --> 46:38.000
It's classic, but it works.

46:38.000 --> 46:39.000
I might be showing my quality.

46:39.000 --> 46:43.000
I guess, but I did do college radio, and I've done, you know,

46:43.000 --> 46:46.000
Twitch and all that other stuff, so I guess I have some insight on that part.

46:46.000 --> 46:51.000
But I definitely am going to be in the shadow of these speakers,

46:51.000 --> 46:54.000
also on this panel, including Chris Gore,

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
as well as Jay Patrick and Charles McFall.

46:56.000 --> 46:57.000
That'll be fun.

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
And then one more panel for you guys.

46:59.000 --> 47:02.000
The very last panel, actually, Monday at 2.30.

47:02.000 --> 47:06.000
The Ask a Podcaster Anything, the panel to end all panels.

47:06.000 --> 47:11.000
It's basically the we are done with the weekend AMA type of panel.

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
And so that'll be fun.

47:13.000 --> 47:16.000
So that is going to be the very last panel Monday at 2.30 p.m.

47:16.000 --> 47:19.000
Of course, I'll be popping into other stuff throughout the event,

47:19.000 --> 47:23.000
but all of those panels at the Hilton Galleria 6,

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
that's a brand new room.

47:25.000 --> 47:28.000
It used to be two years ago where the board gaming was

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
before they moved it to America Mart.

47:30.000 --> 47:33.000
That whole basement is now more ballrooms, basically.

47:33.000 --> 47:36.000
So that is where the podcast track is moved to.

47:36.000 --> 47:37.000
Are you going to have a ballroom blitz?

47:37.000 --> 47:38.000
I hope so.

47:38.000 --> 47:39.000
Well, we have new neighbors this year.

47:39.000 --> 47:42.000
Our old neighbors were the Skeptics track and the EFF track,

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
which were both awesome tracks.

47:44.000 --> 47:45.000
Like, they're awesome.

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
But I am really excited about our new neighbors, too,

47:47.000 --> 47:50.000
because our new neighbors, I believe, are moving over from the Sheraton.

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
So our new neighbors is the Trek track.

47:52.000 --> 47:53.000
So that's going to be fun.

47:53.000 --> 47:54.000
So I'm excited about that.

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
And this is another chance for me to say,

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
Grandpa from the Starboard Power Coupling podcast,

47:58.000 --> 48:03.000
well, I've been begging, begging to come to Dragon Con for like four years.

48:03.000 --> 48:06.000
Now I'm going to be like, and our neighbors are the fucking Trek track

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
and you're still not fucking here.

48:08.000 --> 48:12.000
Get with the program, Captain Matt.

48:12.000 --> 48:13.000
Anyway.

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
By the way, I did look it up.

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
And Tiffany will be.

48:17.000 --> 48:18.000
Yes.

48:18.000 --> 48:19.000
And you won't be here.

48:19.000 --> 48:20.000
I know.

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
And our queen this year is Peppermint.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
Yes, I heard that Peppermint was going to be there.

48:24.000 --> 48:25.000
And Wendy Ho.

48:25.000 --> 48:26.000
I know you love Peppermint.

48:26.000 --> 48:27.000
Peppermint was one of your faves from season nine.

48:27.000 --> 48:28.000
I love Peppermint.

48:28.000 --> 48:29.000
That's great.

48:29.000 --> 48:30.000
You'll have fun.

48:30.000 --> 48:31.000
And Frenchie Davis.

48:31.000 --> 48:32.000
Oh, my God.

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
Wasn't she the one that was like kicked off Idol

48:34.000 --> 48:35.000
and then she went on The Voice or something like that?

48:35.000 --> 48:36.000
Something like that.

48:36.000 --> 48:37.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

48:37.000 --> 48:38.000
That's funny.

48:38.000 --> 48:41.000
I'm great that she still gets that coin from doing events like this.

48:41.000 --> 48:42.000
That's cool.

48:42.000 --> 48:46.000
Anyway, what was I going to say about Dragon Con and all that?

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
Oh, also important to plug, the Discord.

48:48.000 --> 48:51.000
So if you're not going to Dragon Con, I'm sad, but I realize some.

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
You all have travel restrictions and stuff.

48:53.000 --> 48:56.000
So you might want to check out our Discord channel,

48:56.000 --> 49:00.000
which is Discord, excuse me, vognetwork.com slash Discord.

49:00.000 --> 49:03.000
We actually have, we're going to have a temporary channel for Dragon Con.

49:03.000 --> 49:04.000
We'll put some pictures.

49:04.000 --> 49:05.000
We'll put some videos.

49:05.000 --> 49:08.000
If you guys want to try to find us at the convention,

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
that's the best way to like chat us and find us.

49:10.000 --> 49:14.000
And we'll post reminders of our upcoming panels and all that stuff in Discord.

49:14.000 --> 49:17.000
I kind of envision that as a way for everybody on the ground at Discord

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
to be able to connect with each other.

49:19.000 --> 49:22.000
Because Dragon Con can be a very fluid, moving event,

49:22.000 --> 49:26.000
especially because I'm hearing they're expecting more rain this year,

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
I think, than we've had in years past.

49:28.000 --> 49:32.000
And I think that's because of the remnants of Hurricane Harvey

49:32.000 --> 49:35.000
going on right now, which while I'm thinking about that,

49:35.000 --> 49:39.000
please allow me to express, if any of our fam from OLR

49:39.000 --> 49:42.000
and our listeners and folks you care about

49:42.000 --> 49:46.000
are in the path of that hurricane, Corpus Christi and Houston

49:46.000 --> 49:49.000
and all those cities there, we're really thinking of you guys right now.

49:49.000 --> 49:53.000
I'm just horrible watching all that stuff on the news

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
and some of those photos that are coming out and so forth.

49:55.000 --> 50:00.000
And I would definitely encourage folks to do more than just, you know,

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
send a thoughtful tweet and so forth.

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
I will try to do this as well.

50:04.000 --> 50:08.000
If you can, donate, donate.

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
But not to the Red Cross.

50:10.000 --> 50:14.000
Investigate the, you know, in times like these when people's lives are on the line,

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
I want to donate to organizations that I know

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
where they're helping and on the front line.

50:18.000 --> 50:22.000
But just investigate the charity that you want to do

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
and, you know, donate appropriately.

50:24.000 --> 50:28.000
And just make sure that, you know, you can do what you can to help.

50:28.000 --> 50:33.000
So I just, I feel really horrible for everything that's going on in Texas right now.

50:33.000 --> 50:38.000
Having flashbacks to the mid-90s when flooding was happening in my neighborhood,

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
and that was no fun to go through at all.

50:40.000 --> 50:44.000
So it wasn't even nearly as bad as what's going on in Texas.

50:44.000 --> 50:45.000
I can't even imagine.

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
So my thoughts are definitely with you guys.

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
All right.

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
Let's move on to some gaming news, shall we?

50:51.000 --> 50:52.000
Let's get back to video games.

50:52.000 --> 50:53.000
Loki.

50:53.000 --> 50:57.000
Yeah, so I guess this is Half-Life reconfirmed,

50:57.000 --> 51:00.000
or at least what it would have been, sort of.

51:00.000 --> 51:05.000
Mark Laidlaw, you may remember, recently left Valve.

51:05.000 --> 51:15.000
He put out kind of a storyline or like a piece of writing on his blog, actually.

51:15.000 --> 51:18.000
He's changed some of the names to protect the innocent.

51:18.000 --> 51:24.000
But he does have a post on there that's basically a letter from Gordon Freeman

51:24.000 --> 51:30.000
writing to Alex Vance and talking about the events that happened after Half-Life 2 Episode 2.

51:30.000 --> 51:35.000
Of course, recently he's had to kind of change some of those.

51:35.000 --> 51:40.000
So now, of course, Gordon Freeman is now Gertie Fremont,

51:40.000 --> 51:44.000
and Alex Vance is Alex Vont and stuff like that.

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
G-Man is Mrs. X.

51:46.000 --> 51:49.000
But you can kind of draw the similarities there.

51:49.000 --> 51:58.000
So if you want to check it out, it's at marklaidlaw.com slash apestle-3.

51:58.000 --> 52:01.000
I'm sure if you just go to the main site, you'll probably find it.

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
And of course, you know, everybody's kind of like,

52:03.000 --> 52:07.000
oh my God, you know, now we can kind of see what would have happened.

52:07.000 --> 52:13.000
And since I have no context whatsoever with Half-Life having, sadly,

52:13.000 --> 52:17.000
not played the first or second game, even though I do own them,

52:17.000 --> 52:21.000
they sit in the vault of unplayed games in my Steam library,

52:21.000 --> 52:26.000
I wouldn't even be able to tell you about what the hell this is.

52:26.000 --> 52:31.000
But I'm sure the people that do play Half-Life are probably pretty excited about this

52:31.000 --> 52:32.000
and disappointed at the same time.

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
I was going to say, I don't know if it's excitement,

52:34.000 --> 52:37.000
because it's kind of that disappointment of this game may never happen.

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
So I don't know.

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
Yeah, it is kind of disappointing.

52:41.000 --> 52:45.000
But I also kind of got the sense that it may not actually be the plot of a Half-Life 3.

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
Like, it may be a rejected plot type of thing.

52:47.000 --> 52:51.000
Like, this was one idea I had written down, and it's not what we went with.

52:51.000 --> 52:54.000
I mean, if you consider how long this game has been in development,

52:54.000 --> 52:57.000
if it's been in development, let's just pretend it has been,

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
if you consider how long this game has been in development,

52:59.000 --> 53:02.000
it's fully possible that the story they were originally going with

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
isn't going to match the story they were going to end with.

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
Hello, Final Fantasy XV.

53:06.000 --> 53:07.000
Right?

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
So, I mean, it's very possible things change,

53:09.000 --> 53:12.000
and maybe this is some, like, old story that isn't happening anymore.

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
So, who knows? Maybe. Maybe.

53:14.000 --> 53:17.000
Anyway, I do just want to acknowledge, over in our chat room,

53:17.000 --> 53:20.000
over at live.vognetwork.com, some people saying that your mic is going in and out.

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
Great. Just what we need now.

53:22.000 --> 53:23.000
It's awesome.

53:23.000 --> 53:24.000
There's another thing breaking down.

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
That's just another mic I'll have to buy.

53:26.000 --> 53:27.000
And, no, that's the same one you've always had,

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
so just make sure your thumb isn't hitting that power,

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
because that power switch is really sensitive on that.

53:31.000 --> 53:32.000
I'm touching the power switch.

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
You may have to kind of make sure this bottom portion is connected.

53:34.000 --> 53:37.000
I know it's stupid, but we'll just, why not?

53:37.000 --> 53:40.000
Only the best quality microphones for our podcast.

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
Why not? I've got to replace computers.

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
But these mics are, what, six years old?

53:44.000 --> 53:47.000
No, it's whenever Brad from, actually, yeah, it is probably that old,

53:47.000 --> 53:50.000
because Brad from Pod Culture sent these over

53:50.000 --> 53:53.000
when we were in the apartment studio.

53:53.000 --> 53:56.000
So it's at least four, you know, because we've been in this house for three years.

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
So about four years, probably.

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
So it's probably time. It's probably time, but...

54:00.000 --> 54:03.000
I'll just replace my own mic when it starts going out, so don't worry.

54:03.000 --> 54:06.000
I still think I have my Behringer mic.

54:06.000 --> 54:07.000
Great.

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
So I'll bring it back.

54:09.000 --> 54:12.000
Well, we'll figure that out, but unfortunately, since it is live,

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
I can't be like, stop the show, let's replace it.

54:14.000 --> 54:17.000
It'll just, Loki will kind of fan through best he can there.

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
And I'll just add that to the list.

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
Things broken in the studio.

54:21.000 --> 54:22.000
Whatever.

54:22.000 --> 54:23.000
Why not?

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
While I'm about to go on a panel about how to be your most professional,

54:25.000 --> 54:29.000
while you're doing all your voices on the radio.

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
All right, well, moving on.

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
So let's talk about Gamescom a little bit,

54:35.000 --> 54:38.000
and Microsoft really kind of had a lot of the news out of Gamescom,

54:38.000 --> 54:42.000
because, of course, they're pushing the Xbox One X.

54:42.000 --> 54:45.000
And the Xbox One X, of course, is on its way out in November.

54:45.000 --> 54:49.000
And there was some talk about here is how to transfer your data

54:49.000 --> 54:52.000
from the Xbox One to the Xbox One X,

54:52.000 --> 54:55.000
because it is anticipated that there are, you know,

54:55.000 --> 54:59.000
hardcore Microsoft fans out there who want to take their Xbox Ones

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
and basically upgrade to an Xbox One X.

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
So they'll be taking their data and transferring it over.

55:03.000 --> 55:04.000
Why not?

55:04.000 --> 55:07.000
I did the same thing with PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 4 Pro,

55:07.000 --> 55:08.000
which I regret doing.

55:08.000 --> 55:11.000
But, you know, some folks may have better luck

55:11.000 --> 55:14.000
when it comes to Microsoft and the Xbox One.

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
So anyway, there's several ways to do it.

55:16.000 --> 55:20.000
You can back up your user settings on an external drive,

55:20.000 --> 55:23.000
and then you can take the external drive over to the Xbox One X.

55:23.000 --> 55:27.000
You can also patch games and then transfer them using an external drive,

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
same way, you know, that again.

55:29.000 --> 55:32.000
But you can also transfer data over the home network.

55:32.000 --> 55:35.000
And that was what you could do with PlayStation 4 or PlayStation 4 Pro,

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
just plan on, at least on the PlayStation.

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
It took a few hours to do that.

55:39.000 --> 55:42.000
So if you're going to do that with the Microsoft Xbox,

55:42.000 --> 55:46.000
be sure that you put ample time aside for that process to happen.

55:46.000 --> 55:49.000
But that'll probably be the easiest way to do it for most people,

55:49.000 --> 55:52.000
is to just use the magic of your home network

55:52.000 --> 55:55.000
to transfer that information over.

55:55.000 --> 55:58.000
I know that, you know, we didn't talk a lot about it

55:58.000 --> 55:59.000
in the intro to the show tonight,

55:59.000 --> 56:03.000
but I know that those pre-orders went up as well,

56:03.000 --> 56:06.000
and they went pretty fast.

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
But most people aren't complaining about that.

56:08.000 --> 56:09.000
Well, we talked about that last week

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
because that was kind of part of their little presentation.

56:11.000 --> 56:12.000
Oh, yeah, that's right, that's right.

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
It had come up right after Sunday.

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
I guess I was just seeing more of the social media

56:16.000 --> 56:17.000
and stuff kind of followed it.

56:17.000 --> 56:18.000
Yeah, the Project Scorpio,

56:18.000 --> 56:19.000
I know we got into that a little bit last week.

56:19.000 --> 56:20.000
But see, that's the thing, though.

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
With the Xbox One X, though,

56:22.000 --> 56:25.000
like, I'm confident that we'll see those in stores.

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
Like, because Microsoft has a track record,

56:27.000 --> 56:28.000
as well as Sony,

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
that those systems will be there,

56:30.000 --> 56:31.000
and they'll be available,

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
whereas I don't trust Nintendo for shit for that.

56:33.000 --> 56:37.000
Well, no shade, but the truth, I think,

56:37.000 --> 56:40.000
is that there's more interest in the SNES Classic

56:40.000 --> 56:43.000
than there is the Xbox One X, at least right now.

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
Um, well...

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
We'll see when the numbers come out.

56:47.000 --> 56:51.000
If that's the case, then take that as a fucking hint.

56:51.000 --> 56:52.000
I mean, because you're just literally

56:52.000 --> 56:53.000
leaving money on the table

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
if you're not going to produce enough systems,

56:55.000 --> 56:59.000
and, I mean, you're just throwing money away.

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
To register participation for this week's episode

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
of Orange Andrade, go to vognetwork.com.

57:05.000 --> 57:08.000
Use the passphrase, ice.

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
I know Nintendo could live in a world

57:10.000 --> 57:13.000
where the Super Nintendo outsells the PlayStation 4

57:13.000 --> 57:14.000
and the Xbox One.

57:14.000 --> 57:17.000
Exactly, like, why build the hype on,

57:17.000 --> 57:18.000
oh, the system can't be bought, oh...

57:18.000 --> 57:19.000
All right, I don't want to regress.

57:19.000 --> 57:20.000
No, no, no, hold on, I'm just,

57:20.000 --> 57:21.000
I have a positive here, okay?

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
It's like, why build the hype on,

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
you know, the system can't be bought and stuff?

57:25.000 --> 57:26.000
Build the hype on?

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
We sold this many million units.

57:28.000 --> 57:29.000
That's the hype you build on.

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
Look how fucking strong a brand is.

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
Super Nintendo system,

57:33.000 --> 57:36.000
we fucking outsold the Xbox One this month,

57:36.000 --> 57:37.000
or something like that.

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
That's the hype you build that shit on.

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
Not this, oh, we don't sell enough,

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
and we're not producing enough,

57:43.000 --> 57:46.000
oh, it's the ports and the season,

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
blah, blah, blah, whatever.

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
Anyway, well, what about this, though,

57:50.000 --> 57:51.000
with the whole Xbox One X?

57:51.000 --> 57:54.000
It appears that Microsoft has stopped

57:54.000 --> 57:57.000
making the Xbox One completely, already.

57:58.000 --> 57:59.000
They're gone.

57:59.000 --> 58:00.000
But they're still making them, though.

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
You know, they are no longer,

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
they took down the listing from the Microsoft store

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
and all that, I mean, there's still an ample supply

58:06.000 --> 58:07.000
on shelves and things,

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
but they are not making more Xbox Ones.

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
Well, probably the original Xbox One,

58:11.000 --> 58:14.000
because they have the Xbox One S,

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
so that's what they're using.

58:16.000 --> 58:20.000
So yeah, the old, old, old, old fat fucking VCR system,

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
yes, that's not being made anymore,

58:22.000 --> 58:25.000
but the Xbox One S, which is a nice-looking system,

58:25.000 --> 58:28.000
that's probably being made, which makes sense.

58:28.000 --> 58:29.000
Ah, there you go, so the original,

58:29.000 --> 58:32.000
an act-def confirms the original model, the VCR.

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
Okay, so you just can't get the original model anymore,

58:34.000 --> 58:35.000
but you can get the Xbox One.

58:35.000 --> 58:38.000
Which, there's no reason you'd want the old one anyways,

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
because the new one's better.

58:40.000 --> 58:43.000
Right, new ones play the HD Blu-rays and all that stuff, right?

58:43.000 --> 58:47.000
Yeah, it has, doesn't it have the HDR stuff to it?

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
Yeah, yeah, they added a lot,

58:49.000 --> 58:52.000
and the PlayStation 4 Pro is touting, so.

58:52.000 --> 58:53.000
Yeah.

58:53.000 --> 58:58.000
Alright, so anyway, you know, here's the thing,

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
I kind of feel burned by my upgrade to the Pro,

59:00.000 --> 59:03.000
that I'm not really sold on the Xbox One X,

59:03.000 --> 59:06.000
but I am sold on making my PC powerful enough

59:06.000 --> 59:09.000
to play a lot of those Xbox One X games,

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
so did Microsoft really lose me?

59:11.000 --> 59:12.000
I don't think they did,

59:12.000 --> 59:15.000
it's just that I'm choosing to do it on PC instead.

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
At least for now, I mean, who knows?

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
That may change, that may change my mind.

59:19.000 --> 59:24.000
Well, I mean, honestly, 4K gaming and stuff's still very early, so.

59:24.000 --> 59:25.000
Yes.

59:25.000 --> 59:29.000
I mean, there's still time for all that.

59:29.000 --> 59:32.000
Yeah, I mean, when Forza Horizon 4 is announced,

59:32.000 --> 59:35.000
in lovely 4K, because you know it'll happen,

59:35.000 --> 59:38.000
it's gonna happen, and it'll probably be next year's game.

59:38.000 --> 59:42.000
I want to get a 4K TV, I've been wanting one for a while,

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
and they've come down in price quite a bit,

59:44.000 --> 59:47.000
I'm just waiting for the right moment.

59:47.000 --> 59:50.000
I'm just worried the day I finally buy a 4K TV,

59:50.000 --> 59:51.000
you know it's gonna happen.

59:51.000 --> 59:52.000
8K TV.

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
8K is the big new, big new thing.

59:54.000 --> 59:57.000
Honestly though, like, it's, they're,

59:57.000 --> 01:00:00.000
they're probably not gonna do that because it's,

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Sure.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:06.000
It's bandwidth, I mean, the content's just not out there right now for that,

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.000
I wouldn't be worried.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Dark Tetsuya says, I heard 8K was already a thing in Japan.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:16.000
This is why I don't, this is why I don't trust it.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.000
It's just the reality.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Alright, and there it is, AkumaJP in chat confirms,

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:26.000
actually 8K is already here in Japan.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:29.000
But let's be honest, so, looking at 4K and 8K,

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
are you really gonna notice that much of a difference?

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
I mean, really, is it gonna be like,

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
That's what they say every time.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Is it gonna be at that point like the pixels are so fucking small

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
that they're indistinguishable anyways?

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
I fucking bet, I would fucking bet.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Dark Tetsuya, you know this show better than I do.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
If I went back to a certain episode,

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.000
would I be able to find an episode where Loki says,

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:54.000
you can't tell the difference between 4K and HDTV?

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
I've never said that, why would I say that?

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:01.000
I feel like it's the same thing, like as the technology gets better.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Why would I say that? Because that's so stupid.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.000
That would be, that's, I mean, let's put it this way,

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:10.000
like it's not a huge difference like depending on the size of the screen

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
that you have and how far away you're sitting.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:16.000
But like once you get to that resolution, doubling it again,

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:20.000
you're not gonna notice that the return on investment is not quite there.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:24.000
It's like from the jump from VHS, the DVD was pretty big.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:27.000
The jump from DVD, the HD wasn't as big.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:31.000
The jump from HD to 4K isn't as great either.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:36.000
4K to 8K, I don't think it's gonna be very noticeable.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:40.000
And what advantage, I think at that point you're just gonna be pushing,

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:43.000
I would imagine, keep 4K and push a higher frame rate.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.000
Because you can do a lot more fancy shit with that nice resolution.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
That's true, I'm more impressed with this.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Instead of just like pushing, because eventually it's just,

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:55.000
you know, how, when are we gonna stop with resolution?

01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:00.000
I mean, really, at some point you're gonna exceed the amount that,

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:04.000
you know, traditional film can even, like, the resolution of film.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
I mean, you're not gonna be able to do that anymore.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:10.000
I remember the first time I saw, it wasn't just HDTV,

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.000
but it was HD on a TV with a high refresh rate

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
and that whole higher frames a second.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:18.000
I was like, this is unreal. Like, this looks crazy.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
You should check out, there was a video that I saw,

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.000
like Nastectips did, they built a, it was,

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
I wonder if, say it was like 16K rig,

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
but they used, like, giant 4K monitors,

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
and the thing was, like, fucking huge,

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
because it was 16 monitors huge,

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
and they played, you know, a few games on it,

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.000
but, I mean, that's the kind of thing, like,

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:41.000
imagine shrinking that down to the size of a, you know, like a regular TV.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
You're not, from, like, sitting across the room,

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:46.000
you're not gonna notice the difference.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Your eyes can't see that kind of detail.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Alright, Dark Tetsuya, put that in the episode summary

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:56.000
so we can come back to this in four years when 8K is all the rage.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:59.000
And Loki says, I never said that.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Well, when our infrastructure for the internet gets better

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:05.000
to where we can stream that shit, like, no problem,

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:08.000
and the technology's out there and the content's out there,

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:11.000
then sure, I'm on board with it, but, like...

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
This is one of those things I want to put on a USB stick

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:17.000
and then put in the time capsule, but don't open until 2020.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Little presents to myself.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Alright, anyway, alright.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Maybe we've got the capsule.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Yeah, I know, right.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Maybe that's something at the end of the year,

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:27.000
I'll have Dark Tetsuya pick some OLR clips.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Like, I can't remember, did we do that right at New Year's,

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:33.000
or is that, like, you know, some mid-time during the year?

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
When did we do that time capsule?

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
I think before the summer, but we're opening it at the end of the year.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Anyway, we need to move on, we're running long.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Yes, we do.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:47.000
So, one of my favorite RPGs is Secret of Mana, Seiken Densetsu 2,

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.000
as it was in Japan,

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:53.000
and as we know that there was a Seiken Densetsu collection

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:56.000
that was released in Japan that had all three of them,

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
which the first one we got is Final Fantasy Adventure,

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:02.000
the second one we had is Secret of Mana, and then Seiken Densetsu 3.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:08.000
So, Seiken Densetsu 2 is being released as Secret of Mana here in the US

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:13.000
for PlayStation and Steam, and the pre-order is already up.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.000
I've got it on my wish list, just it's going to go in the budget,

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
and I don't know what system we're getting it on,

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:21.000
but it's really pretty, it's really well updated,

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
the music has been remastered,

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:26.000
and it looks like with the voiceovers on there,

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
you may be able to choose which language you listen to it in,

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
which would be great.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:35.000
So, the pre-order that I found on Steam was, like, 40 bucks,

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
which really isn't terrible.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Of course, the big edition that came out in Japan, though,

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
came with, like, little figurines,

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:47.000
and if you get the pre-order or a day of purchase,

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:50.000
then you get, like, special tiger outfits for your characters.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Oh, yeah, like, wouldn't they have, like, little moogle outfits, too?

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.000
You get, like, a moogle outfit and a tiger outfit.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Tiger now.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
You sure refer to me as Mr. Tiger.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Do they have tiger's blood?

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.000
But, um, no, that was a real pleasant surprise to see,

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.000
but here's my question.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Which Seiken Detsetsu was Secret of Evermore?

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Dark Sakura took me seriously for a minute,

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
and she's like, you just broke my brain.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
I'm teasing, I'm teasing, I'm teasing.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:23.000
But I did like Secret of Evermore.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
I think that game is shit on unnecessarily.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Like, there are qualities about that game that I do like,

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:31.000
but, yes, that game is not part of the Seiken Detsetsu series.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
It was a square USA game.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:36.000
For some reason it's making me think that I need to actually

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
start playing through Terranigma.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Oh, now that's Enix's, like, Soul Blazer trilogy, right?

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Illusion of Gaia we got over here.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Terranigma came out in Europe.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
Was Brain Lord part of that, too?

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
I don't remember. I'll have to look it up.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Can we get a new toe ball game?

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
But when we get a new Bust-A-Groove.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
No, Bust-A-Move.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Or Ur-Gites.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Do we get a new Ur-Gites? Because Ur-Gites is New York.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
See, Rob, that's not true because you knew me.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.000
But before you, Jamie. Yes, there was a day before you.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.000
No, but you knew me when the first Bust-A-Move came out.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Because you played it at my house.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.000
Not when it came out.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
On that big Toshiba TV that we had back then.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Not when it first came out because my first game.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Before I played DDR, I played Bust-A in the US Groove 2.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
I felt for certain that you knew me.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
That was the game that enabled me to get into DDR.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Oh.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000
I know, right?

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:34.000
You remember the ones who introduced me to that game, though,

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:37.000
was Chris Tang and his girlfriend at the time.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.000
Huh.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:39.000
So.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Interesting.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:43.000
I'm looking in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Dark Tetsuya says-

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
I also remember he kicked Dan's ass at Street Fighter.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Dark Tetsuya confirms Brain Lord was Enix.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Yeah, it was. I know it was Enix, but was it part of the same developers that did Illusion of Gaia and that whole-

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
Because all those games are very similar.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:01.000
I'm kind of wishing I could find a PAL cart of Terra Enigma.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Yeah, right?

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
It would just be nice to have, but I don't need it.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:10.000
I mean, I've been trying to make some time to go back and play some of the stuff that I missed.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:17.000
And that was on my list for sure, but I don't know if I more want to play Seiken Densetsu 3.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.000
I mean, this is great.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
And it's going to be released in January.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.000
It'll be fine when it comes out.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:26.000
But part of me wants to sit and have somebody there and play through Seiken Densetsu 3 again.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:30.000
January, maybe Japanese release. Here it's February 15th, I think.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Steam said January when I looked at it. Hold on.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
I thought they announced the release date is February 15th.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:38.000
Hold on, let me reopen my Steam again and I will get the date off of Steam.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:39.000
No worries.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
Because I put it on my wish list there.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:48.000
But as far as Secret of Mana goes and the remake, I was really jazzed when they announced it because it kind of came out of nowhere.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:54.000
I think, you know, people didn't think that we were ever going to go back and revisit the series at this point.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:59.000
What did we get? We got Legend of Mana and I feel like there was one more game in the series.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
Never mind, it's February 15th, 2008.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:02.000
Woo woo!

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:03.000
18.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
My memory serves me good for something.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:09.000
But yeah, I think people weren't expecting that, oh, we're going to get this Secret of Mana remake.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
And it kind of looks like, to me, it looks like...

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:14.000
How the fuck is this like Danganronpa 2, Steam?

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Steam is weird.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
You like this because you like Danganronpa 2.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
It's nothing like fucking Danganronpa.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.000
They're both from Japan, so...

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
There's no murder mystery in Secret of Mana.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
That you're aware of in the new one.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Maybe in the new one.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Those tiger suits came from somewhere.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Tiger murders.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:37.000
But anyway, it looks to me a lot like the Final Fantasy IV kind of redo.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
Or III, I guess was really the first one.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Final Fantasy III and then they did IV.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Secret of Mana kind of looks like it's in that same style.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:46.000
I think that it fits, though, its original art style, to be honest.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Yeah, it fits.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Because the way that the characters were designed,

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:53.000
they don't look too different in their 3D models.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.000
Yeah.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:57.000
I'm also pleasantly surprised that they're not telling us about this

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.000
years in advance, like the Final Fantasy VII remake.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:04.000
They're telling us this and it's out in less than six months.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
And that's a nice surprise.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
Again, things might get delayed.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:11.000
But I kind of feel like this one's probably been far enough along

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:14.000
and they've been working on it long enough where it's going to be ready to go

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.000
and they're going to make the release date.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.000
So I think that's really exciting.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Now, one other thing I do want to bring up,

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
because I've seen a lot of talk about it on Twitter,

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:23.000
but a lot of people saying, why aren't you putting it on the Switch?

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:26.000
Why is the Switch getting skipped for this?

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:30.000
Because this would be a fantastic game to play on your TV and take on the go.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
I don't disagree with that notion.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
I would love to be able to play this game on the Switch.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:40.000
I kind of feel like because this game has probably been secretly in development for years,

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:43.000
I mean, it's probably been secretly in development for a couple years at least,

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
I think Nintendo is probably still viewed as too risky.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.000
And I think probably when this game was first developed,

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:54.000
the Wii U is probably what was out and they didn't want to develop for that.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:58.000
So they moved on and decided to go with PlayStation 4,

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
which was probably the bigger deal at the time.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:06.000
It's hard to decide to develop for another system,

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:11.000
especially when you don't know how it's going to end up doing that early.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:16.000
Who knows when they were alerted to the Switch being in development.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Exactly, so I'm not going to give them too much shit about skipping the Switch,

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
but I hope it's something that might be visited in the future.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:28.000
And to be fair, the Switch did end up getting that secret Amana collection,

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:32.000
at least in Japan, and the Switch is region free for what it's worth.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:35.000
So maybe that's kind of a consolation prize, I don't know.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:38.000
But the Switch does have that and other platforms don't have it.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:41.000
So I'm not going to be like, oh Square is a bunch of Nintendo haters.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:44.000
I can kind of see the logic and why the Switch got skipped.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:45.000
They did quite the opposite, actually.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:49.000
They put a lot of shit exclusive on Nintendo platforms.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:53.000
But if they decide to do a similar remake for 2nd Densetsu 3,

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:56.000
or even Secret of Evermore, lol, they won't.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:00.000
But 2nd Densetsu 3, even if they decide to go back and remake that as well,

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:03.000
then maybe they'll consider the Switch at that point or something.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.000
So we'll see what happens.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:08.000
Alright. Anyhow, let's move on. Some more stories. Right, Loki?

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:16.000
Yeah. So there's this game called Darkwood that has been out, I guess, on PC for a while now.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:25.000
And they decided that to actually allow more people to play it,

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
they're going to pirate the game.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:30.000
They basically uploaded it to Pirate Bay.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.000
They said there's no catch, no added pirate hats for the characters.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:40.000
They just uploaded it for free so that it will help people check it out

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:43.000
that may not have been able to afford the game in the first place.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:47.000
So Darkwood, I guess, released that originally in 2014.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:52.000
And now it's just kind of out there.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:59.000
I'm surprised with it being out for so long, though, that people wouldn't have been able to play it cheaply.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:03.000
I mean, putting some keys out there in one of those bundle sites or something for like a buck or something.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:06.000
You can't afford a dollar.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:09.000
But neat press either way. It gives them exposure.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:15.000
And saying that they're the ones doing it in the first place, I guess that's...

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
You can't really fault them for that.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:23.000
I think there was an angle to this, too, where they were trying to combat against some of those third-party key sellers.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
Yeah, like G2A.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:32.000
Of course, they were selling a lot of keys or they were grabbing a lot of the free keys that they would send out.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:40.000
They said this practice makes it impossible for us to do any giveaways or send keys to people who actually don't have the money to play Darkwood

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:44.000
because they would just turn around and resell them and say,

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Please don't buy it through any of the key selling sites.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:51.000
By doing that, you're just feeding the cancer that is leeching off this industry.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:55.000
Like we said with the scalpers earlier, same type of thing.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:58.000
Don't give these people money because they're making the situation worse.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Well, very interesting move. It kind of sounds like the nuclear option is to go put it on Pirate Bay.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Honestly, it's been out for three or four years.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:19.000
I don't know if this was the intention, but I bet a lot of gaming shows probably weren't talking about this game in 2017.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:23.000
And now they all are this week, so it is some interesting press for the game.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
Yeah, it's good.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:31.000
I've seen some other games that they had people put out for free on Steam,

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:36.000
even changing the price of free for a short period of time because they have a new game coming out.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:39.000
So it's a good way to kind of drive that press saying,

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:42.000
Oh, hey, there's a game that's coming out for free. You can check it out.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:47.000
And there are also companies releasing a new game soon, that type of thing.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:56.000
So it's not a bad idea, especially that the game's probably run its course for the most part after three years.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:01.000
All right, well, moving on. Video game consoles, they don't just play video games.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
They have a lot of other apps and things that they do as well.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:08.000
In fact, on the Xbox One, you can use Twitter on the Xbox One, which I must confess I don't think I've ever done.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:13.000
Or maybe I used it that one time to write that tweet that says, Hi, I'm on my Xbox One.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:17.000
Yeah, hi, I'm on my Vita. And then that's it. Like you never use it again, right?

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:24.000
Well, interesting because there was an update that they made to Twitter on Xbox One that may be worth revisiting,

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:31.000
depending on what you're into, because it does a focus now for Twitter on live 360 degree video.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:36.000
And a lot of platforms are kind of, you see us more on Facebook with the 360 degree videos and all this stuff.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:42.000
So now Twitter is kind of looking to, you know, put the video content on Xbox One as opposed to just your Twitter stream.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:47.000
So I think that's kind of interesting. Apple TV was already kind of doing this.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:53.000
So this is kind of one of those. They now put it on Xbox One to kind of mimic what was going on on the Apple TV platform.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:58.000
You know, it's too bad the Xbox 360 would have been a perfect name for a VR headset for the Xbox.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:14:59.000
Right.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:06.000
Which I wouldn't doubt that they could do that someday, being that this is the Xbox One,

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:11.000
and all naming conventions are just been, you know, any rules regarding that just been thrown out the door anyway.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:16.000
True. That's very true. But anyway, you can also do two video streams side by side.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:22.000
I don't know how the audio would work in that. I guess you can select one or the other. Maybe you do just listen to both. Who knows?

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:26.000
Also Periscopes, since Twitter does own Periscope, Periscopes are included in this.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:32.000
You can actually browse a global map and look at Periscopes from around the world.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:38.000
So I'm sure during that boxing thing last night, people could look at pirate streams of that fight from around the world.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:42.000
I don't follow that stuff at all, but it's all I saw on Twitter last night.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:46.000
And all I would see on Facebook are people asking for pirate streams.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:51.000
And one of my friend was actually doing like a broadcast and I guess got a strike or whatever they do on Facebook.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:58.000
I don't even know if Facebook monitored that stuff, but Facebook live banned her from broadcasting for like three days.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:04.000
Cause she was broadcasting that event last night, which, you know, people pay hundreds of dollars to see.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:09.000
So it wasn't, wasn't it over really fast to like nine rounds. Yeah.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:15.000
All the reactions I saw on Twitter were that it was kind of ridiculous, but I just, I don't.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:22.000
Well, it's an MMA fighter versus, you know, it's like basically two, like, I don't know if they were undefeated,

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:28.000
but, um, you know, uh, undefeated boxer versus like an undefeated MMA fighter or something like that.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:32.000
I, I could be completely wrong because I don't follow any sports.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.000
I'm already bored.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:38.000
But yeah, it was supposed to be them fighting each other like to see which is better, but you're doing boxing now.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
If it's MMA, that would be interesting, but I don't know.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
I should have done both.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:52.000
Oh, and then something just to say in terms of physicality, an MMA fighter can't last in a boxing match and vice versa.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:57.000
Here's what would have been interesting to me. Why not put them outside their element altogether?

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
That would have been interesting.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:06.000
No, you might know them as these famous boxing and fighters, but can they do curling?

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:09.000
Go-karts, laser tag.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:19.000
That I would fucking pay to see. That is some straight up like ABC, uh, Sunday night specials, Olympics of the stars or whatever they fucking call that shit.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:20.000
Dancing with the stars.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
Dancing with the stars. Perfect.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:26.000
It would be something like that.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:30.000
This Olympics got weird.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:36.000
Act F suggests make them play Puyo Puyo Tetris against each other.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:45.000
The event should be decided by voting with a live student, you know, they'll have live votes for people to submit events that they would participate in.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:52.000
Yes. Well, don't let America vote because the cute young guy will always win. Did American Idol teach you nothing?

01:17:52.000 --> 01:18:00.000
It doesn't matter that Adam Lambert was the better singer. The other guy was the cute young guy and he won.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:04.000
Although, you know, Adam Lambert is no slouch himself, but you know, still.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:10.000
Anyway, from Twitter to American Idol, there we are.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:17.000
Or couldn't he like team up to beat up some other bad people? Like we can throw other people in the ring and they can just beat on them? I'd watch that.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:18.000
Wait, just random people?

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
Like bad people, you know, like throw in like...

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:21.000
Like Nazis.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:26.000
No, not necessarily. You can throw in Nazis, that'd be fine too, but like, you know, just annoying people.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:34.000
I'm sure there's annoying people that we would just like to see. They should have a website where you vote for people with the most punchable faces and invite those people in.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
You just want Celebrity Deathmatch to be a real show.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
Yes, I do. Yes, I do.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
MTV Celebrity Deathmatch.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:43.000
I'm totally fine with that being a real show, yes.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
Dark Soccer, are you able to see your brain?

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
I just see your eyes rolling over there.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:51.000
Alright, why don't you depress the hell out of us with our next story?

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:58.000
This is actually... I kinda don't know how to feel about it. This is somebody actually that Dan's met before.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:03.000
Said he was a really nice guy, so it just goes to show you can't always trust everyone you meet.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:12.000
And I'm gonna lead up to it. This guy is named John Trudeau. He is a pinball designer.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:18.000
He's designed some very amazing classic pinball, like Creature from the Black Lagoon.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:25.000
And Black Rose, which is actually one of my favorite tables. The new Ghostbusters table. Judge Dredd.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:31.000
Quite a few, quite a few really... Bride of Pinbots, another one.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:35.000
So these are all really good pinball tables that everyone knows, right?

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:39.000
Well, he just got busted for kitty porn.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:53.000
Apparently, police search led to him. And they seized his computer and found his equipment contained child pornography.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:20:01.000
We don't know if he was actually producing it or just had it. But even having it is bad enough.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:05.000
So he's currently being held on bond right now.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
There's no nice way to spin this story.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:08.000
There's not.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:16.000
And it just goes to show that, like, what's on the outside surface, what people are like on the outside,

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:20.000
doesn't necessarily mean that they are 100% right in the head.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:28.000
You know, because being in... If anyone listening to this show is into child porn, stop. All of it.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:32.000
Go get yourself some fucking mental health. That's it.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:46.000
But 69 years old, too. His career is over. And deservedly so, because people like that really shouldn't have a career.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:50.000
So this is a really slippery slope and there's a part of me that's just like, just move on to the next story.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:56.000
But I have to ask this question. Does it ruin the games that he created?

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:57.000
I don't think so.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:01.000
Because more people had a hand in those things than just him.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:10.000
I'll put it this way. If you were looking at the origins of everything, ruining the later things, we wouldn't have Volkswagens anymore.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:16.000
I see what you mean. There's criminals everywhere, basically.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:17.000
Right.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:24.000
I do think that the value of his tables is going to go up because there's not going to be any more.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:28.000
That's weird to think about, though. I don't like that.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:32.000
Because you know they're not going to reprint any or recommission any of his tables.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:40.000
I don't know about that. Why would they do that? Just because the designer or something was involved in that? That's stupid.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:47.000
That's true. Most people aren't going to know. It doesn't have that same visibility that films do. You know what I mean?

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:57.000
But people who bother with pinball are going to know the names of the designers. People will know who Lawler is.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:04.000
Great. I know him personally and I can't think of his name suddenly.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:13.000
Steve Ritchie. They'll know who these people are. They'll know who the table designers are. They'll know who the artists behind the tables are.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:24.000
Just today, Dan and I were talking about Christian Marsh, who did a bunch of pinballs in the 60s and 70s, including the one we own, Spanish Eyes.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:31.000
He was also a Cubist painter during the mid-century.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:45.000
But if you're a fan of it, you're going to know what this is. And just when you find it happening under your nose or in your backyard, as it were, it suddenly becomes this big betrayal.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:57.000
And it really is. A person who we trust to be a sane individual who doesn't go around looking at children being abused in compromising situations.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
It's a big shock.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:08.000
Tiger Claw on chat says, I never understood why these people are into that it boggles the mind. Well, you know what? That's good.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:10.000
It's because it's a mental illness.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:17.000
Yeah. And not to, you know, we got to be careful when we talk about mental illness because there's a big spectrum of them. But, you know, I'm just saying.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:19.000
Illness takes all forms.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:21.000
Yes. Yes.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:25.000
You know, and in this case, it's it's definitely.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
I'm just saying it's for the best. You don't understand.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:30.000
Well, yeah.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:32.000
So anyway.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:44.000
It's really disgusting. And I hope that he gets the counseling and everything that he needs to get over such a sickening addiction.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
But at the same time, it's just.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
I think we need to move on to another story.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:52.000
I might have just thrown up in my mouth.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
Let's go to another story. Let's talk about another video game. Loki.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:07.000
Yes. Final Fantasy 15 was suddenly announced for Windows, so they're going to be releasing that out on PC sometime in early 2018.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:23.000
It was revealed from a trailer from Nvidia that basically showed off the GTX 1080 TI kind of footage that they have captured their different Nvidia tech like the hair tech and stuff like that.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:28.000
So it's going to support up to 4K resolution textures. Dolby Atmos.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:41.000
They said a realistic turf advanced hair simulation, combustible fluid fire and smoke simulations, advanced shadows, high quality ambient inclusion and all sorts of stuff.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
So, yeah, it looks pretty cool.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:48.000
I guess it would, you know.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:58.000
I guess the game could get better looking, but on top of that, they're going to have mod support. That's right. Mod support for Final Fantasy 15.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:00.000
That's pretty awesome.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:13.000
And then also Final Fantasy 15, if you're not even getting it on PC or you have it on console, they're getting this weird crossover DLC from Assassin's Creed.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:22.000
So it's this Assassin's Festival DLC that they're going to have like a cross tie in with Assassin's Creed Origins.

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:32.000
And I guess starting August 30th, players will be able to obtain a dream egg from a Moogle Chocobo Carnival event.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:38.000
And they'll be gifted the Assassin outfit for Noctis.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:48.000
And then I guess following day on the 31st, they're going to have some other DLC that's going to transform one of the towns in the game with banners and festivals and stuff like that.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:57.000
It almost sounds like the shit that they do for Final Fantasy 14 or something like that or 11 where they just kind of do these holiday events. It's kind of weird.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:04.000
It is a little weird how they kind of treat it like Final Fantasy 14 in a way where they do online events like you would expect to see in an MMO.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:13.000
But you know, I remember that I did what was the Moogle Chocobo Carnival or something, and it was like an extra menu option that you would load up.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:19.000
And yeah, you get items that could go back in your regular save files. It was a little weird, but it worked. So it was kind of cool.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:30.000
Anyway, since you brought up mods and the PC, you know the first thing that people are going to do with this game, and I don't care if it's dudes or it's chicks or whatever.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:41.000
There's going to be nude mods. It's going to be the first thing that's made. So the big question, and there's a hilarious picture floating around Twitter right now of like the Final Fantasy 15 cast in very little clothing.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:51.000
In like what is going to be a scene from the PC version basically when the mods come out. Well, of course, you know, they were actually asked about it.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:58.000
Hajime Tabata was asked in an interview about the whole, you know, well, what are you going to do about nude mods type of thing.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:05.000
And obviously there's some worry about we've made this great world and people might try to stuff all kind of strange things into it and mess it up.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:13.000
When we were getting together for discussion, all the people together in the project were airing out their worries. Nude mods were something people were particularly worried about.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:20.000
What's stronger in my mind is the fact that I don't want to limit people too much. It's a thing they've bought. It's their game now.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:27.000
As far as the nude mods go, I don't think it's a good thing, but we're going to leave it to the moral sense of the players out there.

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:33.000
Well, they're going to definitely disappoint you.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:45.000
Prepare for a letdown. But you know what? I look forward to Final Fantasy 15's release on PC. That is all I have to say.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:55.000
That's right. 4K. Oh my god. This is good. Like, finally, gay pornography is becoming like a mainstream video game.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:01.000
Something that not even Dream Daddy could accomplish, Final Fantasy 15 on PC is going to accomplish.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:06.000
And you know what? Even if you're not into do-it-yourself, be happy for me at least.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
I fully support this. I can't wait to see.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:17.000
There are some ladies, like unfortunately one of Final Fantasy 15's problems is that the ladies aren't really, you know, they're hardly there.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:19.000
But there are some strong female.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:21.000
I'm sure Sydney will be completely tastefully handled.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:23.000
Of course tastefully, of course.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:34.000
I fully expect to see Macho Man Randy Savage and Thomas the Tank Engine make their appearances on the platform.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:40.000
Yes, yes. For folks that could do without the nude mods, there will always be the over-the-fucking-top shit.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:45.000
I hope we can mod the summons. Please hope the guy that we can mod the summons, because that's going to be amazing.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
DarkSockro, will you describe the motion that you were making with your hand just now?

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:50.000
The jerking off motion.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:55.000
That's right. That's what I'll be doing to Final Fantasy 15 on PC. Thank you for filling in with the visual.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
The other motion was the whoopty shit motion.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:00.000
Whatever.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:02.000
Anyway.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:08.000
If it's on a non-locked device, people are going to figure out how to put butts in it. Butts and dick.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:13.000
Yeah. Even if it was locked down, they would find a way to put butts.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
Even if they have to have a butt sitting on it.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:18.000
Butts will find a way.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
We should have a little chime and play butts.

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
I think it's a butt now.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:32.000
It really seems to be big and red.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:37.000
Somehow, somewhere, butts will find a way.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:39.000
Alright.

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
I was trying to find the more you know, the little chimes.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:46.000
You must be new here. Let me introduce you to Rule 34.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:49.000
Anyway.

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
Even all these jokes about nude mods and stuff aside,

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:58.000
I still think Final Fantasy 15 is somewhere in the middle of the pack for the series for me.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:02.000
I think a lot of it was rushed. Some of my issues with that. They cut a lot of corners.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
Yes. A game that was in development for as many years as it was, was rushed.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
Because the real development didn't happen until the last two years.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:15.000
That's the other thing too. Hopefully with this, one of the things you get with Skyrim and stuff is people fixing the game.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
I kind of look forward to a lot of that.

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
I think I probably will double dip on this game on PC.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:23.000
I think I will too.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
Hopefully I have the appropriate video card at that time.

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:31.000
Hopefully it's optimized and hopefully, I don't think it was one of our stories,

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:36.000
but hopefully it's not 170 gigabytes to download this shit.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
Well, but if it's 4K textures, that wouldn't...

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
That's unexcusable. That's fucking too much.

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
Final Fantasy 13 on PC is 60...

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:49.000
Okay, fine. That's fine. Give me the option then to download it optionally.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:55.000
I'm not running 4K. I don't want to download 160 gigabytes worth of shit I'm not using.

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
Have like a 4K pack that you can download.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
What resolution are you planning to run this shit at?

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:03.000
Download accordingly.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
And Dark Tetsuya in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
I think they came out and said that was a typo or otherwise incorrect.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
Well, they just said that we haven't determined the size yet, which means,

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
where did that information come from? So yeah.

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:18.000
I'm just... Guys, 4K Final Fantasy game, it's...

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
Remember, Final Fantasy 13, which doesn't even support 4K.

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:23.000
60 gigs on PC.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
So when I saw that 180 gig number, I was like, okay, that makes sense.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:30.000
But I mean, this is why a lot of hard drives are like three and four terabytes now.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:36.000
And they're even, you know, the standard size drive in a console now is pretty much up to one...

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:38.000
Well, unless you're Nintendo, but that's a whole other story.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:40.000
But now it's up to a terabyte, right?

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:41.000
What does the Xbox One X come with?

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:43.000
500 gigs or a terabyte.

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:45.000
That's it? Or a terabyte.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:47.000
A lot of the newer ones have terabytes.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:51.000
A lot of them are terrible. Like my Xbox One brick, I have the VHS kind, is a terabyte.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:53.000
I mean, because I didn't buy the very first one.

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
I bought... I don't remember when I bought my Xbox One.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:58.000
It was right around Horizon 3 or something. I don't know.

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:02.000
But I bought like a little later down the line and they had a terabyte model out.

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:06.000
I think Best Buy was running some deal where you bought an Xbox One and you got a game free.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
And it was for Forza Horizon that I bought.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
Maybe it was two, not three, actually.

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
My memory ain't doing so well this day and age.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:17.000
Anyway.

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:21.000
But now that's why one terabyte is starting to become the standard.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:23.000
Anyway.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
Let's take a trip down memory lane, shall we?

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:31.000
We're going to go back to a simpler time when there was no fucking 4K.

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:38.000
These consoles couldn't even hold probably three megabytes, let alone 180 gigabytes.

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:42.000
4K was more like, you know, the download bit rate that you would get with this stuff.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:44.000
Yes. Perfect.

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:46.000
It's the classic game of the week.

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:53.000
But once a month, Dark Sakura dips into the archive of consoles and picks a classic console of the month.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:55.000
I'm switching it up in this bitch.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:57.000
Is this really a classic, though?

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:01.000
Well, it could be a classic in the same way like a turd is.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:08.000
Sometimes we feature classic games because they were notable for other reasons.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
And I think this console is no different.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:13.000
A turd.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:15.000
It's a post-taco turd.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:19.000
Ten years older or more, what is the classic console of the month?

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:21.000
The Nokia N-Gage.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:23.000
Speaking of taco turds.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:29.000
The nickname Tacophone made it into the wiki.

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
That's how prevalent the name was.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:37.000
So because I could find no good music for it, in the background we'll be listening to the dance of the sugar plum fairy.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:39.000
Why?

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:41.000
Because reasons.

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:43.000
Alright.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:46.000
It's your segment.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:58.000
Anyway, the N-Gage was a PDA that was both cell phone and a handheld game device.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:00.000
I was about to say a ham sandwich.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
Ew. Ham is gross.

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:09.000
It was announced on the 4th of November 2002 and released October 7, 2003.

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:11.000
And yes, Dan and I both had one.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:13.000
It was terrible.

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
That means the N-Gage is old enough to be in high school.

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:18.000
It probably failed.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:20.000
Kindergarten.

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:22.000
Several times.

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:28.000
It's going to be that ten year old that's in, not ten year old, it's going to be the thirteen year old that's in first grade.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:30.000
Eating crayons.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:43.000
Anyway, the N-Gage, it's intent was to, because it had the mobile phone functionality added to it, it was supposed to try to get a one up over the Game Boy Advance.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:50.000
It kind of is almost the same shape, but smaller screen, but it was a full color screen.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
Backlit as well, if I recall correctly.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:35:02.000
So, it was re-imaged as the N-Gage QD in 2004 to redesign it.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:11.000
It was supposed to fix a bunch of the design problems, but it only sold two million units in two years.

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:15.000
It was pretty much a big commercial failure.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:24.000
It was discontinued in 2005, and Nokia moved the gaming aspect of it to their Series 60 smartphones.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:29.000
Which was then called the N-Gage Platform, or N-Gage 2.0 in 2007.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:34.000
So N-Gage in itself was rebranded into a service.

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:50.000
But, pretty much, it was meant that you could play on it instead of using cables, you could use Bluetooth or the internet for the N-Gage Arena service to play online.

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:55.000
It had MP3 and real audio video playback, and of course it had PDA functions.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
You know, like the Palm Pilots back in the day.

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:03.000
It was three hundred bucks when it came out, so it wasn't very popular for price.

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:10.000
And it was outsold by the Game Boy Advance a hundred to one, just think about that right now.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:21.000
And then, basically, places like GameStop and Electronics Boutique started giving like a hundred dollar rebates back on the price.

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:33.000
But it was also, you know, like I said, it was also a cellphone, it did not have an integrated camera, it was running the Symbian OS 6.1.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:39.000
And, it wasn't really bad for what it was as a PDA.

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:46.000
However, like, the games were a pain in the ass to get in them.

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:50.000
And I remember that, Rob, did you go to that E3 when they had the whole N-Gage section?

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:52.000
I did.

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:56.000
And I brought out my N-Gage, and the person there was like, oh my god, you have one!

01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:02.000
And there was no one over there, okay? I felt so sorry for the poor Nokia rep.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:11.000
It did have a couple of good games that came out on it, like Pocket Kingdom Own the World got some good reviews,

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:21.000
Pathway to Glory was a self-published game, and it came out pretty well, but most of the games just were not very good.

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:31.000
You had to, like, pull out like a little plastic sleeve to be able to change the games in and out, and it just wasn't very good.

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:39.000
It didn't sell great, the games didn't look all that great, it just wasn't super good.

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:47.000
I mean, so since then, like, the games that came out on it were kind of, you know, there were some big titles.

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:57.000
I mean, we had Super Monkey Ball, we had Puyo Pop, we had Puzzle Bobble Versus, Rayman 3, Sega Rally came out in Australia and Brazil.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:08.000
It was a Sonic game, wasn't very good, Bomberman, the Asphalt series, Ashen, Catan, Civ 2, Rob, I know you like your Civ.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:13.000
It was absolutely not good on that system, I played it at that E3 and I was depressed.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:24.000
Pandemonium came out, the two X-Men Legends games came out, Virtual Cop was created but never released.

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:34.000
It was Tomb Raider, Tony Hawk's Proskater, which I had that one, The Sims Busted Out, I mean, it had games that could have been really good, but it just didn't happen.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:44.000
You know, it was at best ambitious, and at worst, what it actually was.

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:53.000
It was just, and on top of that too, with the shape of the phone, you know, it was called the Taco Phone for a reason, but it was really hard to talk and hear on it.

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:58.000
You know, the design just was really poorly executed, at least for that first model.

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:02.000
I'm sorry, I'm laughing at this shade in our chatroom from our pal Bobby Black Wolf.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:06.000
The Engage booth was a great place to chill when you got claustrophobic.

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
That's pretty much why I think we went there.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:18.000
But it was just nice seeing that momentary glow when I pulled out my Engage, like, oh my god, a human who bought one.

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:20.000
Like, well, technically.

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:23.000
It was free, but okay.

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:33.000
Okay. And I had to keep switching out my Sim between the Engage and my, what did I have at the time, an Ericsson?

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
So here's the thing I've got to bring up, though.

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:46.000
So it's much shit as we gave the Engage at the time for being a cell phone and a gaming platform, and not really doing either one of them particularly well.

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:50.000
This thing was out, what, three years before the very first iPhone?

01:39:51.000 --> 01:40:01.000
And then, of course, Androids around the same time, which, like, now you think about gaming and mobile, and that's like the way a lot of people game exclusively.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:06.000
So it's kind of, you know, you almost want to say, oh, is the Engage ahead of its time in that way?

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
But then you think about that horrible design.

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:17.000
And one place where Apple really, you know, got them was that the design of that original iPhone was pretty fucking sweet.

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:19.000
To their credit, at least they had buttons.

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:21.000
I had one right when they came out.

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:29.000
So yeah, at that time, my cell phone that I was using regularly was a Sony Ericsson that had that stupid little camera attachment.

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:35.000
I went through, I had two Sony Ericksons because I liked them so much. Remember my little attachments?

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:37.000
Yeah, I remember that thing, yeah.

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:43.000
So just trying to put it in the perspective of what else was out at the time. It was before the Razer.

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:45.000
So there you go.

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
There it is. All right, your classic console of the month.

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:50.000
Classic turd of the month.

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:54.000
Classic console of the month. The Engage.

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:56.000
You're the one who put it on my list.

01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:00.000
Did I? Oh yeah, because we were brainstorming back in January.

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:02.000
And then you did Engage.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
Because I was like, oh, it's over 10 years old.

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
I'm like, watch me fucking do it.

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:09.000
Watch me, hoe.

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
It'll be dead. It's already been gotten.

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:17.000
All right, we are going to take a break though, but don't go anywhere. There is plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:21.000
So stay tuned when we come back with part B right after this quick break.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:35.000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio. Live tonight with episode number 698 of our show already in progress.

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:40.000
Our last show really for the month because we won't be here next week.

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:46.000
Because again, Dragon Con is going on next weekend, which actually technically I think is September anyway.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:50.000
But my point is we're not here next week, so this show is going to have to do you for two weeks.

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:56.000
And we'll be back with 699 the day before Loki's birthday on September 10th.

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:58.000
You know what we're missing too?

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:00.000
What's that? On the first.

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
What happened on the first 12 years ago?

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:05.000
You and Dan getting married, right?

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:07.000
Yes.

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:12.000
God, it's hard enough to remember anniversaries. You want me to remember yours?

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:14.000
Right. On top of everything.

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:15.000
Because mine's important.

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:23.000
But also I was thinking about it and it's next January. I will have been living in California for 20 years.

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:29.000
Not half of my life yet, you know, at that point, but still kind of crazy to think about it.

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:31.000
Yeah, for sure. For sure.

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:39.000
Anyway, I do want to of course give a shout out to our Discord because you can join our Discord server at vognetwork.com slash Discord.

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:44.000
And you guys submit stories throughout the week, which is awesome. And you know, some of them you're probably already hearing on tonight's show.

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:49.000
But another thing I want to bring up because this was something that had a lot of people's attention earlier this week.

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:53.000
On Monday, there were a lot of people that had eclipse fever going on.

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:55.000
Oh, that was this week, yes.

01:42:56.000 --> 01:43:00.000
Yeah, that was Monday. I know, it feels like a lifetime ago with everything that's gone on in the world since then.

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:08.000
But something that was actually submitted in Discord was that there was a Reddit user out there who photographed the eclipse with a Game Boy camera.

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:12.000
That's right, digging out their Game Boy camera to record the occasion.

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:21.000
And they actually have this little print that they did of the eclipse that they printed from their Game Boy camera, which I think is hilarious.

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:29.000
So there it is. And the photo photographer who took that picture says, I should still be shooting Game Boy camera photos in 2024.

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:34.000
So, you know, there's still love. It looks like a dragon's eye is what that picture looks like there.

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:38.000
That whole little, you know, again, it's a radio show, so describing pictures is the best thing.

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
How long before we get the Game Boy Classic Mini?

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:47.000
You know, that seems like a more logical next step than the Nintendo 64.

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:49.000
Yeah.

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:53.000
Especially because, you know, the new 3DSs don't really play the classic Game Boy games anymore.

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
Well, they were on Virtual Console. Very limited selection was.

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:58.000
What's a Virtual Console?

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:08.000
Yeah, right, exactly. But, shoot, if Nintendo can still have the license to do it, you would need to have Nintendo's version of Tetris for that to really be successful.

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:13.000
Although they did a, I mean, to be fair, they did a far better version of Tetris later on.

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:17.000
They did it on the, was it the regular DS? I think it was.

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:22.000
They had a, like Tetris DS, I think was the game. And it was great.

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
If you never checked that one out, that was probably, that was a way better version of Tetris.

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:29.000
Because, you know, the original Tetris on Game Boy was limited to the whole black and white.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:37.000
It was very, you know, it was rudimentary, but obviously at that time, it was a totally time-sucking game at that time.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:44.000
But I think they really improved the formula on Tetris DS. Nintendo did make really, really good Tetris games, for what it's worth.

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:48.000
But I was going to ask quickly, the Eclipse, did any of you guys bother to watch it?

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:50.000
Yeah.

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:55.000
But not like the idiot in Washington, looking directly at it.

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:57.000
What a fucking dumb shit.

01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:04.000
Yeah, I honestly, since I was busy teaching, I only got to see, I walked out to the parking lot and a bunch of people were looking at it.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:09.000
And this one guy had a big strip of glass, special glass or whatever. So he was just passing it around.

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:13.000
And everybody would just take a second to like look through the strip at the sun. Oh yeah. So that's what I did.

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:17.000
I looked through the strip at the sun for like half a second. I'm like, hmm, neat. Next person.

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:21.000
I took some pictures through my glasses, but they didn't come out quite right.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
But what happened is the lens flare was crescent shaped.

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:26.000
Yeah.

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:37.000
And so that was really neat. So I've got, I put those around. I think I've got like some on my, on my, whatever that thing with the pictures, Instagram.

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:43.000
I didn't bother taking pictures because I knew everybody else in the fucking world would be taking pictures.

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:45.000
And then NASA did better pictures than everyone, of course.

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:52.000
It's, it's why I don't take pictures at concerts anymore. Why bother taking pictures at, well, I might take a selfie before it starts or something,

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:58.000
but I don't bother taking pictures at concerts anymore because I can go onto YouTube three hours after it's over and relive the whole thing.

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:02.000
So why bother? That's my attitude anyway. Maybe I'm just old.

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:04.000
Loki, did you bother with the eclipse at all?

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:15.000
Um, we just looked out, you know, at it, you know, I had a thing, an app on my or a page on my phone that told me like when the, you know, the, um, what was the climax of it was.

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
And so I went right there and looked at it like at 10 30 or whenever it was.

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:22.000
Yeah. It was, it was kind of cool to see how cold they got. It was kind of neat, Neil, in that sense.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:29.000
Yeah. Cause I did like how it was like darker outside area. And obviously we weren't even in, we were what's 60% totality.

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:31.000
We were even 80 or something. It was pretty good.

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
But we weren't in the totality zone, but still it got, it definitely got dark.

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
Like, yeah, Bobby, you know, had a pretty good time with that.

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. I saw those pictures. It looked like they had a good time out there.

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:45.000
So that was, I mean, yeah, I would love to be in a total, um, eclipse area, but unfortunately it's, you know,

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:49.000
Well, you'll get your chance in 2024. Was it, was it 2024?

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:51.000
I think we're going to have to travel though for that.

01:46:52.000 --> 01:47:01.000
Yes. You'd have to travel for that. You'd have to go to, uh, I think, um, I think it's like the, the Southeast part of Texas on up through like, you know, Michigan.

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:05.000
Yeah. I'm just not going to do that.

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:14.000
Fine. All right. Oh, thank you. Bobby Black Wolf says Texas to Indiana is what it is. It's 2024. So there would be some traveling involved.

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:20.000
Anyway, it's an excuse for me to go back to Chicago. Indiana's right next to Chicago. Take a little road trip.

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:24.000
I bet some of my Chicago buddies would want to go see the totality eclipse. It would be fun.

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:29.000
All right. Anyhow, enough science talk, even though you can never really have enough science talk.

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
Let's get to some rapid fire news. Loki.

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:44.000
So, um, we may remember all these wonderful VR titles that were announced during, um, the whole, you know, Bethesda E3 event that they streamed online.

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:52.000
Well, um, so we've got first off, um, Skyrim VR for the PlayStation VR coming out November 17th.

01:47:53.000 --> 01:48:03.000
Doom VFR on the PlayStation VR and the HTC Vive on December 1st. And finally, Fallout 4 VR on the Vive on December 12th.

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:12.000
And that was coming out of QuakeCon 2017, those dates. I am looking forward to Skyrim VR. I will buy that game a million times apparently.

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:17.000
Yes, it's your Mass Effect. It's fine. Everybody's got their thing.

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:19.000
It's a time sink. What can I say?

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:21.000
Fine. Everybody's got their thing.

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:28.000
Um, and then, so, this is kind of cool. A new character got announced for Injustice 2.

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:38.000
And, uh, probably one of my favorite characters out of the whole DC Comics realm, which was, um, Hellboy is going to be coming to Injustice.

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:45.000
They don't think they've announced a date yet for that. Um, let's see here. Oh, September 12th.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:51.000
And it's going to be, um, available, I guess, when Fighter Pack 2 goes on sale.

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:53.000
Nice.

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:59.000
And so with that, it looks like Raiden's in there and I'm not sure who the other character is.

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
Uh, the Adam.

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:07.000
I just want to check out Injustice 2.

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:09.000
Yeah.

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:12.000
Netherrealm makes good fighting games. I mean, the Mortal Kombat games, the first Injustice was good.

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:13.000
They do.

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:18.000
So I need to check it out. I just, you know, it's one of those things, I'll get around to it one of these days if I can tear myself away from the MMO.

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:21.000
Oh, I'm sorry. He is Dark Horse. That's right. He was in DC.

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:22.000
Yeah.

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:23.000
But, whatever. Who cares? Hellboy's awesome.

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:24.000
Alright.

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:35.000
Uh, moving on. Uh, Horizon Zero Dawn got a new patch this week, uh, where they patched in a mode to make the game more accessible to our pal Bobby Blackwolf.

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:45.000
That's right. An easy mode was put into the game. And, uh, if you don't know the long running inside joke, it's that, uh, when, um, uh, what was it? Borderlands 2 came out.

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:49.000
The Technomancer, Techromancer was the class.

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:56.000
Yes. They, they, they made a, a big faux pas when they were talking about BFF mode and one of the devs kind of put their foot in their mouth.

01:49:56.000 --> 01:50:02.000
And, uh, Bobby had the devs on his show at one point a long time ago and he, he coined the new phrase Blackwolf Friends Forever mode.

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:09.000
So now we joke. Because Bobby Blackwolf is fine. He's not going to take offense if we, at least I don't think he does. If he does get to take offense, he needs to let me know so I stop making the joke.

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:15.000
But, um, uh, if, uh, you know, if, if we, we can always say that the easy modes are always for Bobby Blackwolf.

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:21.000
So we don't have to say that they're for a certain gender or for a certain thing. We say the easy modes for Bobby Blackwolf.

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:29.000
So, uh, Horizon Zero Dawn and, and Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I love the joke and all the easy modes for me. So there you go.

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:35.000
So if you, you need to, um, point that an easy mode was put in a game for somebody, you say it's for Bobby Blackwolf.

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:46.000
So, uh, Horizon Zero Dawn got its, uh, Bobby Blackwolf mode this week, uh, and, uh, this new story difficulty will boost damage and reduce enemy damage considerably.

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:54.000
So I think it's a way that you can kind of play through the game and experience the story without having to worry about, like, actually dying.

01:50:54.000 --> 01:51:03.000
Which, you know what, a lot of story-based games kind of do this now and, you know, like Mass Effect, you know, the, the easy mode in Mass Effect is pretty fucking easy.

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:08.000
Especially if you play, like, in two and three, if you play an Engineer, your little AI will do it all for you.

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:14.000
You really don't have to do a damn thing. So, but, you know, and for some people that takes the thrill out of the game.

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:20.000
But guess what? You get choice. That's the great part about it. You get choice. If you want to just have the AI do it for you, fine.

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:26.000
If not, you can, um, have that challenge. There you go. Bobby Blackwolf mode, now available in Horizon Zero Dawn.

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:35.000
Um, also, this is really cool, uh, Rocket League, of course, is bound for the Switch, uh, which may be a game I end up double-dipping on, who knows.

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:43.000
Uh, some sweet cars are gonna be in this. Super Mario and Metroid themed battle cars are coming to the game. Oh, which reminds me.

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:54.000
So I pre-ordered the, uh, Nintendo 3DS New XL with Samus on it. I like how you're shaking your head, like, the whole, like, we knew we were gonna lose you to that, yep.

01:51:54.000 --> 01:52:05.000
We knew that was gonna happen. This is why they get away with what they do. It really is. It really is. Because you guys, you're just like, I'm not doing it, I'm not gonna buy that because I'm gonna put my foot down.

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:13.000
What, it's Metroid themed? They changed the outside to look like Metroid? Alright, I'm going in.

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:27.000
Read me, drag me, I deserve it, I deserve it. So that's, but yes, I pre-ordered one. Because I want, but I also want to reward when they fucking recognize Metroid, which is a nice change of pace for the company.

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:36.000
So, there you go. Anyway, Mario NSR, Luigi NSR, and Samus' Gunship will be, uh, free and unlockable in the game at launch.

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:48.000
But what's interesting about it, now, if I remember right, the Switch, the Xbox, and the PC will all be cross-play because Sony is, you know, pouting in the corner, they, they, you know, that whole thing.

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:56.000
So, but the other systems are all cross-play. So what happens if I have the Mario car and I'm on Microsoft's platform? Does Microsoft allow that skin to come through?

01:52:56.000 --> 01:53:04.000
Or will the skin, since it is just the skin, will it just not load and just be like a red car or something? I wonder if, I'm curious about how that will work.

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:14.000
But at the same time, I mean, it's not like Microsoft doesn't fucking know who Mario is and is, you know, I don't think they're really gonna care.

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:20.000
There's a part of me that says they're not gonna care if Mario is on their console. They're actually gonna be excited, like, ooh, Mario's on Xbox.

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:24.000
I don't think they would care. You know who would care? Nintendo.

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:25.000
Maybe.

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:29.000
Nintendo cares about its customers and it cares about its IP.

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:37.000
Maybe. Maybe. Alright. Well, anyway, um, let's move on. Dark Soccer, you have some stories for us, right?

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:41.000
Everything I care about is Dragon Ball. Right now.

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:51.000
Um, so just one of the, you know, they're putting in a lot of attacks that were prevalent in the anime and manga into Dragon Ball FighterZ.

01:53:51.000 --> 01:54:02.000
But the big one, and this is actually kind of notable, is that they put in, because one of the new characters that they announced in the current beta is Jirokugo, number 16.

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:09.000
And he's got a self-destruct attack that basically leaves him with like one sliver of life that it's almost an insta-kill.

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:14.000
It's actually pretty, pretty neat to watch it. The animation is fully perfect with the series.

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:30.000
But, um, with that, the other playables right now that they've added in for the current beta is, uh, they have Krillin Piccolo, um, Future Trunks is available, uh, Jirohachigo, and actually Junanago is like an assist for her.

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:34.000
And, um, and Jirokugo, so.

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:46.000
Um, and, guess what? The beta sign-ups are open. They're open! I've, I may have signed up under every email that I have, because I went in a lot.

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:53.000
Um, but yeah, you can go on the Bandai Namco page and sign up. So, do it.

01:54:53.000 --> 01:55:02.000
But the session is going to be, um, September 16th through September 18th. Go play. Go do. And then let me in.

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:06.000
That's how I feel about the Dissidia.

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:07.000
Let the right one in.

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:12.000
That's how I feel about the Final Fantasy Dissidia beta. Like, I was like, when did, like, all my friends started tweeting,

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:16.000
Oh, I got in the beta. I got in the beta. And I was like, when did the fucking sign-ups happen for that beta?

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:21.000
But it was during the weeks that I was away from things, um, that we referenced a couple weeks ago.

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:27.000
Um, and so I guess I, I just missed that whole thing. So I tried to apply for a beta code late, but I didn't get one.

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:33.000
But some of my friends are saying it wasn't very good. So I'm a little, this concerns me type of thing.

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:39.000
So, uh, we'll see. I don't know. I don't know. I still want to try to play it myself, but, um, you know.

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:47.000
Anyway, um, moving on. Let's get to some release dates for this week and travel around the world and check out what's coming out in stores.

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:52.000
How about the U.S. coming up on this Labor Day weekend? Do we have anything right before Labor Day?

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:59.000
Yeah, we actually do have quite a busy week. So starting things off, we have Absolver on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:07.000
Ark Survival Evolved on PC, Mac and Linux, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, I'm assuming coming out of early access on the PC platforms.

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:15.000
Everybody's Golf on PlayStation 4. Hello Neighbor on PC and Xbox One.

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:27.000

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:48.000

01:56:48.000 --> 01:57:01.000
X-Morph Defense on PC and PlayStation 4. Ys 7 on PC. Life is Strange Before the Storm, Episode 1 on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:11.000
Resident Evil Revelations on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. And finally, Xenia on PC.

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000
That's a really busy week.

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:16.000
Yep, it's getting in the fourth quarter already.

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:23.000
I was going to say, believe it or not, here we go. I imagine September will be a little quiet, but then once we start to get into October...

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000
September's going to be pretty noisy.

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
September's pretty packed.

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:33.000
Well, the first week in September is not too bad, I guess.

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:37.000
Yeah, but then October is going to start to bring what Mario Odyssey is October.

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:40.000
The first true week in September you only have Destiny 2.

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
Well, that's a pretty big deal.

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:48.000
It's going to just start to ramp up through the end of the year, so here we go. Hold on to your butts.

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:53.000
How about Japan? It's not as busy of a week in Japan, but still, pretty busy week.

01:57:53.000 --> 01:58:01.000
Looks like their big release this week on the PlayStation 4, they have a game called Yoronunai Kuni 2 Shingetsu no Hayayome.

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000
That is an irregular and a premium box.

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:11.000
I'm not sure what this game is. I don't know much about it, but I do see the cover is two girls that are like, you know, look like they're like vampire hunters.

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:15.000
There's nothing to me on the cover, but they have a whole little talk about...

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:20.000
Aluche has been resurrected by the Kyria as an artificial half-demon.

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:27.000
According to the researchers, Liliana had already disappeared when they found her and said to likely be in the abandoned city in order to recover the stolen Liliana.

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:33.000
The resurrected Aluche heads for the abandoned city, taking along the demon power she does not desire within her.

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:37.000
So it's, you know, girls being possessed by demons. It's one of those types of games.

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:46.000
So you can check that out on the PlayStation 4. That is a Tecmo game, or not Tecmo, um, Koei Tecmo, I think, may have done that.

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:54.000
Let's see, more games that are out this week in Japan. New, Minna no Golf, so the, you know, Everybody's Golf series in Japan gets its release there.

01:58:54.000 --> 01:59:00.000
Ys Origins is out, I'm sorry, that is an Asia region release, but still worth noting.

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:05.000
And also in Japan, Biohazard Revelations Unveiled Edition is out this week.

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:16.000
So that is all on the PlayStation 4. The PlayStation Vita also gets that Yoro no Naikuni 2, as well as a game called Crank In, in regular and limited edition.

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:25.000
That is out on the PlayStation Vita this week. And on the Switch this week, that same Yoro no Naikuni 2 is also on the Switch.

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:34.000
So, uh, you can get that. Or you can get some Mario Kart 8 Joy-Cons in Mario and Luigi. I think those are just, oh, it's the wheels.

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:39.000
It's not the actual Joy-Cons, it's just the silly little steering wheels, um, for those that need them.

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:42.000
Although, I don't know people that actually play with those anymore.

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:47.000
Hey, the 3DS hasn't slowed down on releases. They still are getting a couple releases this week.

01:59:48.000 --> 02:00:01.000
Seikaiju 2 Fuiji No Dungeon 2 is one game that's coming out this week, as well as a game called Atante Jinjuuji Saburo Ghost of the Dusk is also out in Japan this week.

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:05.000
So, um, quite a few releases there as well. How about the UK, DarkSakura?

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:27.000
Oh, just a few things. We have on the 29th, Absolver for PlayStation 4 and PC, Fishing Planet for PC, Killing Floor 2 for the Xbox-y stuff, Windjammers for PS4 and Vita and all of the Sony things.

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:39.000
Um, X-Com 2, War of the Chosen for PlayStation 4, X-Bone and PC. On the 30th, we have Sunless Skies for Mac and PC. And that's it.

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:45.000
Alright. Thank you for that trip around the world, and hopefully there's some games that you're excited to play this week.

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:53.000
Well, every week we open up our mailbag for you guys to send us emails. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to do it.

02:00:53.000 --> 02:01:00.000
And DarkSakura's gonna dive in the mailbag and pick out the emails that she thinks are worthy of reading on the show tonight.

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
DarkSakura! Who emailed us?

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:10.000
First email. Hello Skye, DarkSakura and Loki. Martin the Belgian here. That's like his title now, Martin the Belgian.

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:11.000
That's right.

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:21.000
I wanted to comment on your story last week about online memberships on consoles. I have to agree with Loki's rant. Paying for online on consoles is really just a cash grab.

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:28.000
Sure servers cost money, but they do on PC as well, where paying for online play is unheard of.

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:35.000
I'm letting my PS Plus membership expire because I plan on- because I play all my online games on PC.

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:44.000
The only reason I'm keeping my PS4 is to play the PS4 exclusives, mostly single player. The free PS Plus games are just not worth the monthly cost.

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:52.000
On a brighter note, I will be attending DragonCon this year. Since I live in Atlanta and my friends are going, I don't really have an excuse not to.

02:01:52.000 --> 02:02:00.000
I will be attending Saturday through Monday, and I am very much looking forward to some of the panels that Rob will be on Saturday afternoon in the podcast track.

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:06.000
Besides that, there are usually some interesting video game panels as well.

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:13.000
I remember you mentioning that there would be a way for VOG Network peoples to keep in touch with each other during DragonCon, but I could not find it on the website.

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:15.000
Would it be through Discord?

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:24.000
It is. Sorry. Yes, it is through Discord. Just go to vognetwork.com slash Discord.

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:31.000
You can find the link on the main VOG Network site. It's in the menu under participate, I think, is where it's located.

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:38.000
But most people, I've just been telling you, just go to vognetwork.com slash Discord, and you'll get the invite code right there.

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:44.000
But yeah, participate. It's also under that menu heading on the website.

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:47.000
DarkSoccer brought a gigantic fan with her to the studio.

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000
Because it gets hot in here.

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.000
We do have a fan that's right there that's not plugged in.

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:54.000
I know. I'll go turn on the AC fan because I notice it's not running right now.

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:55.000
My arm works.

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.000
While DarkSoccer finishes this email.

02:02:57.000 --> 02:03:02.000
Keep up the great show as always, and see you at DragonCon, Rob. All the best, Martin.

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:05.000
It'll be great to meet you at DragonCon. I'm excited. That's great.

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:08.000
I'll have one fan in the audience. Woohoo. That'd be nice.

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000
I'll have one fan in my hand.

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:11.000
Woohoo.

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:12.000
Okay, moving on.

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:18.000
Hello, LR. I wanted to address the musings from last week's episode regarding Xbox Live and why it costs money.

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:26.000
As someone who has implemented Xbox Live features into his own games, I can tell you that doing so is ridiculously simple.

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:31.000
Adding matchmaking and setting up online play is as simple as just a few lines of code.

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:35.000
Adding support for leaderboards and achievements is similarly easy.

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:39.000
And the icing on the cake is that you don't need to run a server ever.

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:48.000
Instead, Microsoft runs huge server farms that handle all of the matchmaking as well as other network features for each and every game that supports Xbox Live.

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:53.000
From the 2005 Xbox 360 launch games all the way through this week's new releases.

02:03:53.000 --> 02:04:01.000
Nobody pays for online play on PC because nobody provides those kinds of services on PC.

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:04.000
Want matchmaking in your PC game? You have to set it up yourself.

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:09.000
You either have to pay for a service or set up and run your own using your own servers.

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:16.000
That is complex. It's expensive. And if your game doesn't find an audience right out of the gate, it's a money pit.

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:25.000
At the time Microsoft put together the first version of Xbox Live, online play was not yet popular on game consoles. Bullshit.

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:36.000
I had my Dreamcast Ethernet adapter. And I wanted to use it. And they said, no. We played a lot of Quake. Anyway.

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:44.000
Yeah, that's true. Xbox wasn't the first. But they did make it. Xbox was centralized, I think is the key difference.

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:48.000
It was a console Y type of thing. If that makes sense.

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:58.000
Alright. I'm trying to see where it was. Microsoft was looking for a reason to convince developers to add it to all of their games.

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:04.000
This was the reason they didn't need to pay for it and the amount of effort required was as low as possible.

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:10.000
Microsoft instead chose to pass those costs on to gamers who had actually utilized the service.

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:18.000
As a direct result of the strategy, online play is now a standard feature in our console games today. And it continues to be so.

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:24.000
Does this still need to cost money in 2017? And does it still have to cost as much as it does?

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:30.000
I can't answer those questions. And yes, companies would be foolish to pass on money from customers who are willing to pay for something.

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:44.000
But that is why it's not free. And even though some Play Anywhere games will sport these features on PC with no extra charge, please remember that many, many, many more gamers will be playing these games on Xbox.

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:52.000
Which will easily subsidize the comparably few gamers playing them on super beefy PCs. Anyway, there it is.

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:56.000
And one other thing, Chemical Plant Zone is the best Zona Zona 2. Lies.

02:05:56.000 --> 02:06:04.000
See, I speak the truth. Best music, best ambience, great speed, plus you even get those sweet helix-shaped ramps.

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:17.000
Fuck that underwater part at the end if you take too long. And fuck that bridge of death that can kill you without any warning right before the boss. But everything else about it is great. Yes, truth. Court is closed. Aaron, YYR.

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:32.000
And the things that you named are precisely why I hate the level. Because it's not enough to redeem the great parts of it. Like the helix ramps, which are pretty cool. The helix ramps are great. But I like the spinny ones in the first level.

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:45.000
I do want to thank YYR for that perspective and that email. I do still think that, you know, Microsoft could make some big moves by, you know, undercutting, you know, what PlayStation is charging, what Sony is charging by possibly even going free.

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:55.000
But, you know, I think it is interesting the things you bring up on the whole fact that it's easier, let's say, to put in your game on Xbox Live because of the way Xbox Live is set up than it is on PC.

02:06:55.000 --> 02:07:10.000
But here's my crazy question. And I don't know if you know this, Loki, but then why would it be that EA, I mean, if Xbox is kind of running all that, then why is it that EA pulls support for their games notoriously early and then you can't play them online anymore?

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:18.000
I mean, it's because EA runs their own server thing and everything like that. But yet you still need Xbox Live to play on EA servers, right?

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:35.000
Yeah. And they do have matchmaking servers through Xbox Live and stuff. But I mean, here's the problem, though. It's like it's this. It's also like a perfect example would be the brand new Shadow of War game.

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:48.000
I watched a video this morning regarding that. So, Shadow of War is a game that's coming out that a lot of people were looking forward to that they decided that we're adding microtransactions and loot boxes into the single player portion of the game.

02:07:48.000 --> 02:08:00.000
And you have to buy in game, you have to buy currency to do that. And it's not just cosmetics, it's actual things that you like orks that you can get in the game that you unlock through this as well.

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:15.000
And then now they also have a sponsorship deal that they're doing with Totino's Pizza Rolls. That they're making money from that. So they're making money from, and to be honest, the game that you're buying is not a full game because they have a season pass that's gonna be along with it.

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:23.000
So you're not, you're paying money for the season pass, you're paying money for the in game transactions, they're getting money from this marketing deal with Totino's Pizza Rolls.

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:25.000
And you're not even getting pizza rolls.

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:32.000
And all this shit for their game because they're saying, oh well our game is, we just can't be profitable without that stuff.

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:41.000
Same thing. Well, how did Sony do it all these years with all, how did these companies do it all this time on the Playstation 3 without charging for online?

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:45.000
Were they operating at a loss? Why even put your games on that platform then?

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:55.000
I think it's an excuse because they're making money from all sorts of shit that they're doing now that we just take for granted because this is just the world that we live in now.

02:08:55.000 --> 02:09:04.000
And that's the problem. It's like, yes, I get it. Servers cost money. So does development for your game. So does marketing. Should I pay you extra money because you're marketing your game?

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:10.000
Should I pay you extra money because you wanted some better artists for your game? That's not fucking fair.

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:17.000
Charge more for your game then. Why should I have to pay for online?

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:29.000
The nickel and timing is getting a little extreme. Regardless, I appreciate the perspective from YYR even if I feel like it explains 80% of it to me and there's still some nebula in there.

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:43.000
I do feel at the end of the day, Microsoft could subsidize that cost through other means. Again, even when I pitched the idea on the show last week that Microsoft could really shake things up, I'm not expecting they're ever going to do it.

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:49.000
I don't think it's a realistic thing I'm proposing, but I'm just saying they would turn some fucking heads if they did it.

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:53.000
You know how they subsidize some stuff with that? You notice that in your-

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:54.000
Pizza rolls.

02:09:54.000 --> 02:10:05.000
No, speaking of pizza rolls, you notice that in your little wonderful OS there, there's fucking advertisements. They're making money from those advertisements to subsidize that shit.

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:16.000
And yet the price of the online keeps going up. So don't- they don't need to be defended. They are a big company. They can handle this shit.

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:34.000
I don't understand why we have to pay for online still. We're making excuses for these publishers. Fuck that. Fuck making excuses for them. They are big fucking companies that do not need to be defended. Demand your fucking rights. We didn't pay for online before, why should we have to start paying for it now?

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:38.000
Alright, on that note, let's go to the next email. We have another email, right?

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:39.000
We do.

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:40.000
Alright, awesome.

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:51.000
Evening, OLR. Hope all is well. I just wanted to vent about the Xbox One X Scorpio and SNES Classic Edition. Simply put, both pre-order situations were just a clusterfuck.

02:10:51.000 --> 02:11:04.000
Well, the Xbox One X not so much. After the Xbox Game- Games Rooms conference ended, I was successfully able to order- to secure a Scorpio pre-order. Now, you can't seem to find one anymore.

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:11.000
The pre-order window only lasted for a day, and all allocations were scooped up like Haagen Dazs. Nice plug.

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:17.000
And quick search on eBay shows the Xbox One X selling from $650 to $2,000. Damn.

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:25.000
The SNES Classic was just a crapshoot. With Best Buy and Amazon pre-orders starting in the middle of the night, many people found themselves shit out of luck.

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:38.000
I didn't receive my Amazon notifications that it was available, but somehow, thanks to Wario64, my son waking me up at 4 o'clock Eastern in the morning, I secured one for myself.

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:49.000
I just couldn't believe it myself. The situation was worse than the SNES Classic. Another eBay search shows that the system is selling between $250 to $300+.

02:11:49.000 --> 02:12:03.000
Who is to blame? Is it Nintendo for always limiting stock? Is it the retailers that decided to sell the product in the dead of night? Is it in fucking scalpers who buy a lot of the product and leaves the average customer without any options?

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:11.000
I'd say it's all of them. It seems Nintendo isn't giving a shit anymore about what's going on while their customers are trying to figure out how to do it next week.

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:22.000
Cue Reggie Fils-Aime shrugging his shoulders. That deserves an FUs of the week slot. Well, we already had that out, so no.

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:32.000
Oh, this part's to me. Let's talk fighting games. Dragon Ball FighterZ is looking better and better. I hope you signed up to get into the beta. Fuck, yes, I tried.

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:49.000
I need this game now. I just learned of the newer characters that's in it. Android 16, Android 18 with 17. I'm just going to say Super Saijin Blue. Goku and Vegeta, Krillin and Piccolo.

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:58.000
In the series, it was called Super Saijin God, Super Saijin. It's repetitive, so I'll just say Super Saijin Blue.

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:12.000
Anyway, for example, if Android 18 does her level 3 super and is on the same team with Krillin, they both attack together. Krillin isn't on the team, then she does her super with Android 17 instead. Can't wait.

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:22.000
Been watching more Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite gameplay, and I'm pretty excited for it now. I wasn't due to the demo feeling super underwhelming. Now it's looking insane.

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:34.000
Lastly, whenever you get a chance, I highly recommend the Daigo the Beast Umehara fighting gamers manga. I was able to get a post-evo copy from Focus Attack, but it won't be available until November.

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:47.000
The manga chronicles his early years playing fighting games, and I didn't know he, and I think we're missing a verb here, so I'm just going to read it as, I didn't know he Vampire Savior using Jetta and Bishamon. Dude, Jetta's the best though.

02:13:47.000 --> 02:14:01.000
Hopefully you three are doing well. I truly enjoy listening to you guys and can't thank you enough for providing me your thoughts and opinions with regards to today's state of video gaming. Take care and happy gaming. This is from Tristan.

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:03.000
Be careful with the fan, the noise is coming through.

02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:04.000
Okay.

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:05.000
On the mics.

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:09.000
AKA needle crash. Well, they're just hearing my sass. That's my sass.

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:10.000
Thwarp.

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:11.000
Thwarp.

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:21.000
Thank you for that lovely comment at the end of the email. Even though I can't follow the Dragon Ball stuff the way Jamie does, I just, no disrespect, I just don't know the universe as well. But, um, I'm, I-

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:23.000
You're not going to hear it from me again when it's out.

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:36.000
Well, let me, let me put it this way. Even though I don't follow the universe as well, even I looked at that fighting game trailer and I was like, oh, that looks pretty sweet. Like, so who knows, maybe this could be the, the, uh, gateway or what have you.

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:44.000
Uh, and I think you succinctly sum up the, uh, Super Nintendo situation, even though I don't want to necessarily rehash that whole thing. Um, I think you succinctly sum that up.

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:55.000
Tigerclaw in chat says Darkstalker wants to play this Dragon Ball FighterZ game so bad. Maybe if she's really good at it, get in those fighting game tournaments and show them what a badass you are at Dragon Ball FighterZ. That's not gonna happen.

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:58.000
That's. Not. Gonna. Happen.

02:14:58.000 --> 02:14:59.000
That's just not something that interests you, right?

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:05.000
Well, besides that, I can't play games like I used to because of the problems with my, with my wrist.

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:06.000
Oh, right.

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:16.000
Uh, playing for a prolonged period of time just makes it hurt. That's why right now I've been trying to fan myself with the left hand instead of the right.

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.000
Uh-huh.

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:21.000
That and the shade. The shade of it all.

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:34.000
That's a, um, good kind of like side question. Let's assume any type of physical disabilities or anything you want to say like that. Let's assume any type of like physical limitations weren't on the table. What game do you think you would want to try to play competitively?

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:43.000
Like, for example, on, um, you know, I had, I ran a show for a brief period called Pokestop Podcast with Shane and Shane talked about that he was interested in getting into competitive Pokemon play.

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:49.000
I don't, I, sadly, I don't think he really followed through on that this time. I think that might still be on his agenda, but that's a question for him.

02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:55.000
Um, but you know, like is, is there a game that you would be interested in playing competitively if you kind of had that time?

02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:56.000
No.

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:57.000
No, really?

02:15:57.000 --> 02:16:00.000
The last game I tried to play competitively was Bust-A-Move 2.

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:01.000
Really?

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:06.000
At Anime Expo. I like played for like a fucking hour beating everybody.

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:07.000
Yeah.

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:18.000
And then I just goofed or something. No, it was the controller that I had, had a stuck button on it. Should I change the button after I lost, but whatever, or change the controller out?

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:27.000
Um, yeah, well, for me, I, you know, I did DDR for that hot minute competitively. Remember that one random ass tournament in the Bay Area? Was it like a high five or something?

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:34.000
I came in fourth in Perfect Attack and people were like, who's this guy? You know, kinda, that was kind of unexpected, I think at that point. So.

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:37.000
Remember Stomp to My Beat?

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:40.000
Yeah, that was, that was one of the huge tournaments where we did that.

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:41.000
It was.

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:44.000
That was where we tried to do Perfect Attack. You and I tried to compete in Perfect Attack.

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:45.000
And the glare on the screen was.

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:53.000
But it was the glare, the glare on the screen. We weren't prepared for it because the machine was outside in the sun and it's just like, we weren't prepared for it. And it just fucked us up.

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:55.000
Was that the one that ate at the break or whatever?

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:57.000
No, it was at Miggle.

02:16:57.000 --> 02:17:05.000
Milpitas Golf Land. I don't think we knew you yet. We didn't really start to know you until OLR started. And this was before, or was it before OLR?

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:07.000
No, we did, um, Scat.

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:13.000
Yeah, no. When, when was Miggle? Was Miggle 2 before OLR? I think it was.

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:14.000
I think Miggle 2 was, yeah.

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:18.000
It was. That was the very first time I ever met Mel B's now wife.

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:19.000
Yeah.

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:27.000
And we, we clicked like that and they came on like the sixth episode of OLR. So I, I met them before OLR started. So yeah, Miggle 2 is before all that.

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:28.000
Yeah.

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:31.000
But anyway, wow, memories. Tell me really.

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:41.000
Uh, but what game would I compete in competitively if I could now? Um, God, I wish I was better at Overwatch. I'm just, I'm not good at first person shooters.

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:43.000
Overwatch makes me vomit.

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:45.000
I love, the characters are so well done though.

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:46.000
But it makes me motion sick.

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000
Did you see that Mei comic though?

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:55.000
No, but it still makes me motion sick. That doesn't, the fun parts about the fandom have nothing to do with the fact that the game makes me fucking nauseous.

02:17:55.000 --> 02:18:00.000
Yeah. Well maybe, well who knows? Maybe the universe will spawn a side game someday that won't be the same type of game. That would be kind of cool.

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:02.000
Maybe. Then it'll be worth playing.

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:10.000
Like Warcraft spawned World of Warcraft. You never know. There might be something that comes out of that. Um, Maloki, what would you play competitively if you could?

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:17.000
I don't know. I'd probably play something like Player Unknown Battlegrounds or something like that. I don't really know.

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:23.000
Actually, you know what? For me, I might almost say I almost would get back into DDR if I could.

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:24.000
Yeah, DDR I guess.

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:32.000
I think, you know, because I keep forgetting. There is still, like there's been a big renaissance in that whole scene because of round ones, because of Dave and Busters.

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:38.000
And now that there's Ace and there's these games that, you know, maybe we don't follow that scene as closely as we used to in the early days of this show.

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:50.000
But like it's still going and there are still tournaments and stuff and people like doing, and I think it would be hilarious if some damn near 40 year old dude got up there on stage and, you know, could once again get 4th place in Perfect Attack.

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:55.000
Now, I don't have the stamina that I used to, but you know, you never know. Someday.

02:18:55.000 --> 02:19:00.000
So, you're never too old. That's my point. You're never too old.

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:09.000
Alright. Looking in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, sj100matt says, I'm sad nobody has said playing Uniracers competitively.

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:11.000
I don't think there's a competitive scene for that.

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:12.000
Let's see.

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:14.000
We'll speedrun all the games.

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:20.000
Actif says, I'd play Splatoon 2 competitively. And Actif says, I could also play Tetris. Oh, that's a very good one.

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:28.000
sj100matt says, I remember Rob was at the DDR tournament at 8 on the break. That was 12 plus years ago. Yes, that is true. That is very true.

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:31.000
Alright. Let's move on. Was that it for emails tonight?

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:37.000
Alright. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email in the future.

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:39.000
In the meantime, we're going to get through the last of our stories tonight.

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:44.000
And I'm going to apologize, you guys, as I mentioned earlier in the show because of kind of the hot mess going on.

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:47.000
I don't have Skype on. Well, I'll try one more time. Maybe it was temporary.

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:49.000
Let me try one more time, see if I can connect to Skype.

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:51.000
Nope. Peter's still being a bitch.

02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:53.000
Peter says no.

02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:54.000
What?

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:55.000
Peter says no.

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:58.000
So, unfortunately, I'm not going to have a Skype line tonight.

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:03.000
But what I will do towards the end of the show, we'll do an open Q&A.

02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:06.000
We'll do an AMA in the chat room. Ask Orange Lounge, if you will.

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:08.000
But now the hip new term for it is AMA.

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:10.000
So, we're going to do an AMA in the chat room.

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.000
Nope. It's Ask Orange Lounge. We're classic.

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.000
Fine. We'll do an AOL.

02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:21.000
You have to make the dial-up sounds. Hello. You've got questions.

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:27.000
Sorry. So, we're going to do an AOL segment at the end of the show instead of Skype line because Skype line is busted.

02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:31.000
But hold off on those questions. We'll get to it in just a minute.

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:32.000
We've got some more stories first, though.

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:33.000
Loki.

02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:36.000
Yes. Who says that Comcast is not good for anything?

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:44.000
But, apparently, if you want to get into the Call of Duty World War II beta, you can do that if you're an Xfinity customer.

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:51.000
So, you go to xfinity.com slash call of duty between August 31st and August 31st.

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:55.000
You put your account number in there and they'll give you a code or they'll send you a code.

02:20:55.000 --> 02:21:03.000
So, I just did that today and actually they're going to be sending me one. It's apparently in September.

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:07.000
So, September 1st. So, I'll have to check it out.

02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:10.000
Even though I'm really interested in this game. But, hey, free.

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:15.000
Free beta. Now you get the chance to test if maybe you'd like it or not, right?

02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:16.000
Well, check it out, I guess.

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:25.000
There it is. Alright, well, you guys know I love my Final Fantasy XIV and there's an interesting team up going on here.

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:26.000
Is it Sotino's Pizza Rolls?

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:31.000
Close. Really fucking close. What's the closest thing in the world to pizza rolls?

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:33.000
Actual fucking pizza.

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:40.000
So, Domino's and Square Enix have teamed up to create the Chocobo Chow Pizza.

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:44.000
Is it made of Michelle Greens?

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:50.000
No, it is made of chicken, pineapple, because yes to pineapple on pizza.

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:51.000
Yes.

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:52.000
Yes. Yes.

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:54.000
Let's order one right now.

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:58.000
Alright. You know what? That should be the next Splatfest.

02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:00.000
Pineapple, no pineapple.

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:10.000
Pineapple on pizza or never on pizza. Anyway, so, the Chocobo Chow includes, SSU 100 Matt says, this conversation is over.

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:15.000
Anyway, the Chocobo Chow includes chicken, pineapple, capsaicin?

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:19.000
Capsaicin. Capsaicin is what makes peppers hot.

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:22.000
Oh, okay, okay. Mushrooms.

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:23.000
I wouldn't be able to eat it.

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:28.000
Onions and spring onions, which I think are just green onions, basically, are what on this pizza.

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:34.000
So, yeah, this is unfortunately, and maybe why there's ingredients in here I'm not as familiar with.

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:38.000
This is a flavor exclusive to Australia and New Zealand.

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:39.000
Womp, womp.

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:45.000
But, you can get a gaming bundle for $50 Australian, which is about $40 in US dollars.

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:54.000
It's three regular sized pizzas, garlic bread, and a 1.25 liter soda, and that's gonna be about $40, which for three pizzas I guess isn't bad.

02:22:54.000 --> 02:23:01.000
But, you also get a code with that for Final Fantasy XIV Online, which you can redeem for PC or PlayStation 4.

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:02.000
So, there you go.

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:06.000
But, we all know Square is really making their money from that game from the monthly subscription.

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:10.000
So, it's a 30 day hit to get you hooked, and then from there.

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:14.000
And, I don't think the online complete edition includes Stormblood.

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:20.000
I could be wrong, but I don't think, oh no, you get a code to redeem for a chance to win.

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:21.000
Excuse me.

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:24.000
So, yes, the complete edition then would include Stormblood. Oh, you get a chance.

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:28.000
Well, I stand corrected. There you go.

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:33.000
Anyway, there are other Domino's pizzas that have been rebranded, by the way.

02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:37.000
Moogle Meat Lovers, not actually made from moogle meat.

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:39.000
It's actually, yeah, other meat.

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:46.000
Curious Cactar, that's the veggie pizza, in case you're curious about vegetables.

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:48.000
That's a Loki pizza.

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:50.000
I'm veg curious.

02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:56.000
Stormblood Supreme and Heavensward Hawaiian.

02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:59.000
I don't know if you would put blood and supreme in your...

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:04.000
Wait, wait, wait. Does that make you like pizza pie curious?

02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:05.000
He's pie curious.

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:07.000
Pie curious.

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:09.000
I think, Jamie...

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:12.000
I'm not really curious about pies, because I do eat pizza quite a bit.

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:14.000
I had pizza last night, by the way, so...

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:20.000
We need to have a frank conversation on this show about how everybody's a little bit pie curious.

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:26.000
There are flavors of pie you've always wanted to try. Everybody's a little bit pie curious.

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:30.000
Ironically, I don't like regular pie.

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:31.000
Really?

02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:32.000
Yeah, I don't like pie.

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:34.000
What types of sweets do you like?

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:36.000
I really like a lot of sweets.

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:43.000
How can you say I don't like pie? Does that mean you don't like apple pie, cherry pie, lemon meringue pie, peanut butter pie, pumpkin pie?

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:44.000
There are 50,000.

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:45.000
Yes, all of the above. I do not like any of that.

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:47.000
I want peanut butter pie.

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:50.000
Are you saying you're not even a little pie curious?

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:52.000
I'm not pie curious in that sense, no.

02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:55.000
Not dessert pie curious.

02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:56.000
Wow.

02:24:57.000 --> 02:24:58.000
I can't handle it.

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:00.000
Not even a cream pie.

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:03.000
That's probably for the best.

02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:08.000
Stopy in Chat says, I'm piesexual. Ever seen the movie American Pie?

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:09.000
Yes, I have.

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:16.000
All right. Anyway, I did notice though that another there was yet another Hawaiian flavor in the Final Fantasy.

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:23.000
I think Yoshi P agrees that pineapple should go on pizza because that's two of those pizzas that have pineapples on it.

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:27.000
Do veggie pizzas have pineapple? Not usually. I don't think they usually, but it's usually greens.

02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:29.000
That would be a fruit pizza.

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:32.000
Oh, that's right. A pineapple is a fruit, of course. So yes. All right.

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:35.000
Do they have fruit pizza? What other fruits go on pizzas?

02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:36.000
Tomatoes.

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:41.000
Tomatoes. That's right. Even though most people don't think of tomatoes as fruit, but yeah.

02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:43.000
That's really all they offer.

02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:44.000
Avocado.

02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:46.000
Is avocado a fruit?

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:47.000
Avocado is a fruit.

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:48.000
Do they even put that on pizza?

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:50.000
And I've had it on pizza before, yes.

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:51.000
You can, yeah.

02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:52.000
Sounds like California.

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:53.000
It sounds like a California Pizza Kitchen thing.

02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:54.000
They put avocado on everything.

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:56.000
Exactly. All right.

02:25:57.000 --> 02:25:59.000
SSJ100 Matt is like, this needs to stop.

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:09.000
I feel like SSJ100 Matt is to pineapple on pizza as Rob Roberts is to mayonnaise on anything.

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:13.000
My wife would sure like this to stop so we can get home and watch Game of Thrones already.

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:15.000
Oh, Jesus Christ. Fine. We'll go on to the next story.

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:17.000
Because she can't keep herself off social media.

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:22.000
You know what? I've just been watching everything on YouTube just now, and oh my God, I called it.

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:24.000
How come you call a show that you don't watch?

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:26.000
I do. I've been watching this season.

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:28.000
Oh, okay. I thought you didn't watch the show.

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:33.000
But I went back and watched everything about the characters I gave a shit about.

02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:41.000
And honestly enough, I've called everything to this episode.

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:45.000
This whole season has been a complete non-surprise.

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:48.000
I feel like the one guy left who cares more about Twin Peaks,

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:55.000
which has been like sitting through like 12 episodes of like what the fuck is going on, which is fine.

02:26:55.000 --> 02:27:01.000
Because that's David Lynch. You watch a David Lynch thing, there's always going to be a little bit of what the fuck is going on.

02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:07.000
In the old Twin Peaks, Lost Highway, fucking any of his movies, there's always going to be a little bit of what the fuck is going on.

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:12.000
But like the last two episodes have really started to say like, this is what's fucking going on.

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:16.000
And it's been like, oh damn, so I'm really, I fucking want to watch Twin Peaks.

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:19.000
And here's the crazy part. Sorry, Loki.

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:29.000
The Twin Peaks finale is at Dragon Con, yet there's no official viewing on Sunday of the Twin Peaks finale.

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:32.000
How did they miss an opportunity like that? I don't understand.

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:33.000
Licensing?

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:37.000
I guess. I guess maybe showing it in a room or something, but I guess they'll have to be unofficial viewings.

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:41.000
But it's Sunday night, which if I remember right, is the Masquerade.

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:47.000
The GLBT event is also Sunday night, which is weird. I seem to remember it was on Saturday night every other year.

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:53.000
So it's like, probably just have to download it and watch it on my phone on the plane home or something.

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:55.000
But I'm really excited about that.

02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:59.000
Alright, anyway, let's get to some more stories.

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:01.000
So after pizza, Dark Sakura.

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:07.000
Oh god, I want pizza though now. I'm hungry. Even after all that delicious Korean food I had.

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:13.000
So, speaking of things that are not delicious, it would be the way the EA was treating Mass Effect.

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:17.000
Except for one glorious nugget of pineapple on the pizza.

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:21.000
Basically, Mass Effect isn't dead.

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:33.000
EA Executive Vice President Patrick Soderlund said that the performance of Mass Effect Andromeda has not doomed the series.

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:35.000
And the quote on here is,

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:41.000
I've seen people saying, oh EA's not making another Mass Effect. I see no reason why we shouldn't come back to Mass Effect.

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:47.000
Why not? It's a spectacular universe and it's a loved series. It has a big fan base.

02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:50.000
And it's a game that has done a lot for EA and for Bioware.

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:54.000
So they're saying that they need to be cautious about it and they need to be careful.

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:59.000
But they are planning on eventually coming back to it from what they're saying.

02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:04.000
But we'll see. They've said this shit before.

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:10.000
When was the last time we got the Lost Vikings game, really?

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:15.000
Well, they throw dumb little Lost Vikings references into later games.

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:16.000
They're in World of Warcraft.

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:18.000
And they're heroes in Heroes of the Storm.

02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:19.000
Yeah.

02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:21.000
So, you never know.

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:23.000
Well, fuck Anthem.

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:29.000
I would like to see Mass Effect come back. I'm just worried about if EA is saying this.

02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:34.000
Would EA let somebody who's not Bioware develop a Mass Effect game? I'm a little worried about that.

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:39.000
I mean, now it ultimately depends on who's involved.

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:46.000
But I don't want a return to the Mass Effect franchise to be, oh, it's a clicker game on mobile.

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:49.000
You have to mine the planets for resources.

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:50.000
I want the mic to pick this up.

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:51.000
What?

02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:54.000
Thwarp.

02:29:54.000 --> 02:30:00.000
Thwarp. Furious fanning ensues. I'm shoving breadsticks into my purse as we speak.

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:05.000
Just a couple more stories for you guys and then we'll do some Ask Orange Lounge. Loki.

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:10.000
So, Sega is developing a Fist of the North Star game.

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:13.000
It's going to be the Yakuza team working on that.

02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:17.000
And it looks pretty awesome based off the trailer that they have right now.

02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:19.000
It's only confirmed to be coming out in Japan.

02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:26.000
But hopefully we'll see more details from during Tokyo Game Show, which is going to be the end of September.

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:32.000
I can't believe Tokyo Game Show is sneaking up on us like that.

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:33.000
Yep.

02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:36.000
Oh, man. There's going to be some exciting announcements at Tokyo Game Show.

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:39.000
There's got to be. I feel like other companies have been saving stuff for it.

02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:41.000
And maybe we'll get an update on some of these games.

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:42.000
Sony will actually have something coming out.

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:44.000
Heck yeah. I'm excited. I'm excited.

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:48.000
Alright. Well, one more story for you guys tonight.

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:53.000
And it has to do with the game that nobody asked for, but you're going to get it anyway.

02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:57.000
And it's Bubsy! The Wooly Strike Back.

02:30:57.000 --> 02:31:02.000
And there's even going to be a limited PlayStation 4 edition for you Ultimate Bubsy fans.

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:08.000
That will include the software, the original soundtrack, Bubsy's business card.

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:11.000
You know, for your file.

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:13.000
And a mystery postcard.

02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:19.000
This extremely limited physical edition will be available at Best Buy, GameStop, and other online retailers.

02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:21.000
It's only 40 bucks for what it's worth.

02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:25.000
So I will, despite the fact I'm having a laugh here at Bubsy, who knows?

02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:27.000
The game may actually be good. Who knows?

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:33.000
But this is only 40 bucks and you have this extra junk.

02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:34.000
But it's extra stuff.

02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:36.000
Well, you actually start at 64.

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:38.000
Like going, what the fuck? I'm not buying that.

02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:43.000
So, but anyway, the release date for all this, get this.

02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:46.000
October 31st, 2017.

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:49.000
The perfect Halloween gift for your friends.

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:51.000
Bubsy, The Wooly Strike Back.

02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:54.000
Available on PlayStation 4, Steam, and Rage Nator.

02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:57.000
Are you out there? Because they are actually advertising good old games.

02:31:57.000 --> 02:32:02.000
GOG.COM is one of the platforms that Bubsy is going to be available on right there.

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:04.000
So, we'll see.

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:06.000
There's a new trailer out there if you want to watch that.

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:08.000
I'm happy to see that Accolade is back.

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:14.000
Wake me up when they do Accolade Comics, which was one of my favorite Commodore 64 games in the world.

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:20.000
Anyway, since we are unfortunately prevented from having a Skype line tonight,

02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:26.000
let's quickly open it up to any questions in our chat room with a segment that we call Ask Orange Lounge.

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:30.000
In the past, I would usually make you send me a private message, but I'm not going to do that.

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:35.000
If you want to just ask an open question chat, it could be about games, it could be about pretty much anything.

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:37.000
I also have last minute stories, I have two.

02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:39.000
Good, because we need a few minutes for some questions to come in.

02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:41.000
So, Ask Orange Lounge, in the meantime, stories.

02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:48.000
Along with our Half-Life 3 story news, if you are looking to play Half-Life 3,

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:50.000
well, I got some news for you actually.

02:32:50.000 --> 02:33:00.000
Just released today, ModDB actually released, it's called Half-Life 2 Aftermath.

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:06.000
And so you can check out some of the beta stuff that leaked out from Half-Life 2 Episode 3.

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:11.000
I guess that they had been developing some stuff leaked out and they were working on making it playable.

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:18.000
So you can play around with some of the things that didn't actually make it into Half-Life 3 or Half-Life 2 Episode 3.

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:23.000
Yeah, so just go check it out, moddb.com, and there's a link there.

02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:25.000
So, that's kind of neat.

02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:32.000
And it includes 11 levels that were created by Valve between 2012 and 2013, and 10 for Half-Life 3.

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:38.000
Four demonstration levels, there's different NPC, or no NPCs.

02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:45.000
You have some weapons and some characters, enemy types that were made for the game that never ended up coming out.

02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:49.000
And then finally, last but not least, this could be a tease of something that we might hear about soon,

02:33:49.000 --> 02:34:01.000
but there is a listing on Target for Bethesda Game of Thrones, which could be a Skyrim-type game for Game of Thrones,

02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:04.000
or it could be just some erroneous shit that they have on Target.com.

02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:05.000
Yes.

02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:11.000
Whatever the case may be, there is something there that says Bethesda and Game of Thrones and let our imaginations run wild.

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:16.000
But doesn't Telltale have the Game of Thrones stuff, or is it one of those things where maybe they license it to multiple people?

02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:17.000
They license it to multiple people.

02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:18.000
I guess like Walking Dead did that.

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:22.000
Well, they had a Game of Thrones game that came out at one time, but...

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:24.000
Telltale, I think, did one, didn't they?

02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:31.000
Well, they did one too, but there was an actual Game of Thrones game that came out that was something completely separate.

02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:34.000
How to kill everyone and get away with it.

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:36.000
So, that's it.

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:45.000
All right. Well, just a couple questions are coming in our chat room, but I guess we have enough that we can actually answer some questions here.

02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:47.000
Again, so in absence of a Skype line tonight...

02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:56.000
Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.

02:34:56.000 --> 02:35:00.000
What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:04.000
I haven't sung this song in forever, it seems.

02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:07.000
And I think I might have forgotten all the lyrics.

02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:09.000
Never had lyrics.

02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:11.000
Whee!

02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:13.000
There's gonna be people that have been listening to the show for like three years that are like,

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:15.000
Why does he do this? Why does he sing?

02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:18.000
They're gonna make the Rob Roberts Orange Lounge Music Compilation.

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:20.000
That fucking already happened at some point.

02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:21.000
No, they had to do the...

02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:23.000
No, remember when John was still listening to the show?

02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:25.000
He did fucking, there was that Step Mania thing.

02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:29.000
Him and Dark Tetsuya put together like a whole Step Mania thing, and they had a song.

02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:32.000
There was a song in it that went Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:33.000
It was one of your fucking things.

02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:34.000
It was Rob Period.

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:35.000
Yeah, it was Rob Period.

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:37.000
And then fucking Scott Rubin from All Games got a hold of it.

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:42.000
And like, I would be tuning into All Games Radio randomly one day and all of a sudden I'd hear Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.

02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:45.000
It was Scott's like favorite fucking thing to come from this show.

02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:48.000
And I'd be like, What? What is happening here on this day?

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:51.000
By the way, congrats to him on the addition to his family.

02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:53.000
Oh, yes, of course, of course.

02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:54.000
Yes.

02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:56.000
Although he's probably out of Burning Man this weekend.

02:35:56.000 --> 02:36:01.000
He's probably doing ice cream at the Playa if I follow his life correctly.

02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:03.000
Because I know he's in ice cream, he's in Burning Man.

02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:06.000
It just seems like a very logical marriage of the two.

02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:08.000
Let's go get pizza.

02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:09.000
You want pizza?

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:10.000
Yes.

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:13.000
I'll put something on it that I'm not allowed to mention because it has to do with 100 Matt.

02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:16.000
I like him a lot and I want to pineapple.

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:17.000
Fine. You be the bitch.

02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:18.000
All right.

02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:21.000
Let's get to some questions in our chat room.

02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:22.000
There's actually quite a few here tonight.

02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:23.000
Let's do it.

02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:27.000
I apologize if we don't do all of these, but I will do a few of these.

02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:31.000
Bobby Black Wolf is asking question number one.

02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:34.000
What is your favorite troll question and why is it?

02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:37.000
Why is Chrono Trigger better than Super Metroid?

02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:39.000
What is your favorite troll question?

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:41.000
This one.

02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:45.000
Actually, my favorite troll questions are these.

02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:51.000
On a scale of 1 to 10, how much do you love this movie Showgirls and why did you say 10?

02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:53.000
I do like those types of questions.

02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:55.000
They're very good for trolling.

02:36:55.000 --> 02:37:01.000
Another trend I've seen on Twitter recently, and I forget the guy's username off the top of my head.

02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:02.000
I think it's NintendoLegend.

02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:03.000
I think it's his name on Twitter.

02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:08.000
And he likes to do these polls that are which of these games is the worst game ever?

02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:10.000
And you'll have two choices.

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:13.000
Super Mario Brothers 3 and Super Mario Brothers World or something like that.

02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:17.000
The two choices will be like The Legend of Zelda and Super Metroid.

02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:19.000
And people will reply and be like, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.

02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:20.000
It's really funny.

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:23.000
The only way to win is not to play.

02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:24.000
Essentially.

02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:30.000
Do you have a favorite troll question, Dark Sakura?

02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:31.000
I guess that's a no.

02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:33.000
Or she's trolling me now.

02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:34.000
That was me trolling you.

02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:35.000
All right.

02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:36.000
Act Deft.

02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:39.000
Question number two.

02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:43.000
What's your favorite Pokemon and why?

02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:44.000
That's a good question.

02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:45.000
It's game related.

02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:47.000
What's your favorite Pokemon and why?

02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:50.000
I guess I'll start because I don't see my co-hosts at this point.

02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:51.000
I have one.

02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:52.000
Okay, what's your favorite, Dark Sakura?

02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:53.000
Houndoom because Goth.

02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:55.000
Houndoom because you like Goths?

02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:56.000
Okay.

02:37:56.000 --> 02:37:57.000
Who's Goth?

02:37:57.000 --> 02:37:58.000
Okay, I like that answer.

02:37:58.000 --> 02:37:59.000
Loki, do you have a favorite Pokemon and why?

02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:00.000
Pokemon.

02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:01.000
Kidding.

02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:02.000
I don't.

02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:03.000
I mean.

02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:07.000
How about like Porygon because he makes loud annoying screeches.

02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:08.000
I'm just kidding.

02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:10.000
I mean, it's probably like Eevee or something.

02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:11.000
Eevee's cute.

02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:13.000
All the Eeveelutions are popular.

02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:14.000
Yeah.

02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:18.000
My favorite hands down, and I'm sorry to go gen one, but I have to because, you know,

02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:23.000
I remember watching the anime back in the day when the toys were at Burger King when

02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:24.000
I was in college.

02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:28.000
Jigglypuff is forever my fave because, and actually on my fave,

02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:32.000
and actually on my phone background, I even have a little Jigglypuff because.

02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:33.000
Jigglycaliente.

02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:34.000
Not Jigglycaliente.

02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:37.000
Well, that was the one time I was ever not.

02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:40.000
I was almost on TV was asking Jigglycaliente a question.

02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:44.000
I thought yours was the picture of Jigglycaliente's face on Jigglypuff.

02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:45.000
No, no.

02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:46.000
It's this.

02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:48.000
It's the little, little cute little background.

02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:49.000
Oh, that one.

02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:54.000
I thought I felt for sure you had that your background was Jigglycaliente's face on Jigglypuff.

02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:58.000
That's probably what you set as my picture whenever somebody call, whenever I call you.

02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:00.000
No, you're, you're still, um.

02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:01.000
Trixie.

02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:02.000
You're still Trixie.

02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:03.000
And yours is Katya, yeah.

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:04.000
Contact, Rob, contact.

02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:05.000
Aliens.

02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:06.000
Oh, honey.

02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:07.000
Um, by the way, they're getting a show.

02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:08.000
Touch.

02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:09.000
I'm so happy for them.

02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:10.000
I know.

02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:11.000
Happy?

02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:12.000
Anyway, okay, back to the question.

02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:16.000
I'm always, I always feel, I bless, I thank, I thank gay God every day that Trixie follows

02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:17.000
me on Twitter.

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:18.000
I really do.

02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:19.000
But anyway.

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:20.000
Katya to follow me.

02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:21.000
I met Katya.

02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:22.000
Katya's great.

02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:23.000
And I met Detox.

02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:24.000
What was the question?

02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:25.000
Oh, yes.

02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:26.000
Favorite Pokemon.

02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:27.000
It's Jigglypuff.

02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:29.800
And because, because she has the microphone and I always thought it was hilarious how

02:39:29.800 --> 02:39:33.820
she got really mad when people fell asleep when she's trying to sing or in my case talk

02:39:33.820 --> 02:39:35.420
and she would draw on their face with a marker.

02:39:35.420 --> 02:39:36.580
I always thought that was really funny.

02:39:36.580 --> 02:39:39.140
So um, yeah, Jigglypuff.

02:39:39.140 --> 02:39:40.140
Forever my face.

02:39:40.140 --> 02:39:41.140
Fave.

02:39:41.140 --> 02:39:42.140
All right.

02:39:42.140 --> 02:39:43.640
Uh, let's see.

02:39:43.640 --> 02:39:44.640
Next question.

02:39:44.640 --> 02:39:46.140
Question number three.

02:39:46.140 --> 02:39:52.940
Uh, Stoppy in chat asks, uh, Rob, this weekend I went to my first live Rocky Horror show

02:39:52.960 --> 02:39:54.920
performance and I had a blast.

02:39:54.920 --> 02:39:57.580
I finally get that movie.

02:39:57.580 --> 02:40:00.860
If there was a game based on Rocky Horror, how would you make it?

02:40:00.860 --> 02:40:04.100
Survival horror, rhythm, point and click.

02:40:04.100 --> 02:40:08.940
Well believe it or not, Stoppy, there are already two games based on the Rocky Horror

02:40:08.940 --> 02:40:14.700
show, not the picture show, but the show because the Rocky Horror show was the play that started

02:40:14.700 --> 02:40:15.700
it all right.

02:40:15.700 --> 02:40:16.700
And the picture show was just the movie.

02:40:16.700 --> 02:40:22.220
But the play is, I think to this day, still kind of a bigger deal in the UK.

02:40:22.220 --> 02:40:25.820
Like I'm sure the movie, the movie's there and there's some casts, but I think the play

02:40:25.820 --> 02:40:26.820
is still a big deal.

02:40:26.820 --> 02:40:27.820
We had the Broadway release.

02:40:27.820 --> 02:40:29.180
And that's where it started.

02:40:29.180 --> 02:40:34.700
But because of that, in the 80s on the Commodore 64, there was actually a Rocky Horror show

02:40:34.700 --> 02:40:38.020
game and it was kind of more like a point and click type adventure.

02:40:38.020 --> 02:40:43.820
I mean a Commodore 64 style, let you say maniac mansion, but like not nearly that good.

02:40:43.820 --> 02:40:44.980
It was very rudimentary.

02:40:44.980 --> 02:40:51.220
Uh, then when they did a revival in the early 2000s, I want to say it was whenever, I think

02:40:51.220 --> 02:40:56.380
it was when Anthony Stewart Head took the role of Frank-N-Furter, which by the way,

02:40:56.380 --> 02:40:59.700
glorious casting, I know, right?

02:40:59.700 --> 02:41:04.140
They released a CD-ROM version that was kind of like an updated version of that game.

02:41:04.140 --> 02:41:08.700
So technically, it has already existed as a game.

02:41:08.700 --> 02:41:14.900
So for that reason, I kind of say, yeah, point and click, but that's because I'm already

02:41:14.900 --> 02:41:17.880
tarnished knowing that those other games exist.

02:41:17.880 --> 02:41:20.740
So I think it would have to be a bit of a point and click adventure, but I would like

02:41:20.740 --> 02:41:22.920
to see something that would be like a sequel.

02:41:22.920 --> 02:41:26.840
But a rhythm or music game would be kind of cool, but I think it would be like a one-off

02:41:26.840 --> 02:41:27.840
cheap little thing.

02:41:27.840 --> 02:41:30.980
I don't think it would be like an actual, like full on game.

02:41:30.980 --> 02:41:33.420
So there you go.

02:41:33.420 --> 02:41:34.420
All right.

02:41:34.420 --> 02:41:37.940
Uh, let's see, uh, moving on with a couple other questions here.

02:41:37.940 --> 02:41:42.700
Let's go to Ice P in our chat with question number four.

02:41:42.700 --> 02:41:44.780
Have you played Slime Rancher?

02:41:44.780 --> 02:41:47.040
No, I have not.

02:41:47.040 --> 02:41:51.880
But this game just came up today in conversation and somebody was telling it, it wasn't even

02:41:51.880 --> 02:41:52.960
during the show.

02:41:52.960 --> 02:41:54.400
Somebody was telling me I should play it.

02:41:54.400 --> 02:41:55.400
So yeah, it looks cool.

02:41:55.400 --> 02:41:56.400
Yeah.

02:41:56.400 --> 02:41:57.400
I will check it out.

02:41:57.400 --> 02:41:58.400
It does look cool.

02:41:58.400 --> 02:41:59.400
I'll check it out.

02:41:59.400 --> 02:42:00.400
Have you, you haven't played it either, right?

02:42:00.400 --> 02:42:01.400
I've watched videos of people playing it.

02:42:01.400 --> 02:42:02.400
So I know what it's about.

02:42:02.400 --> 02:42:03.400
What the hell is it?

02:42:03.400 --> 02:42:05.200
It's basically like it says Slime Rancher.

02:42:05.200 --> 02:42:10.480
So you're, you build a ranch and you're going out to the wild and catching slimes with like

02:42:10.480 --> 02:42:16.040
this like vacuum gun thing and the slimes generate like currency that you build ranch

02:42:16.040 --> 02:42:17.360
and stuff and they do different things.

02:42:17.360 --> 02:42:18.360
That sounds cute.

02:42:18.360 --> 02:42:21.960
So it can be like tricky cause like some of the slimes like they stay on the top of each

02:42:21.960 --> 02:42:24.240
other and escape and you have to go catch them.

02:42:24.240 --> 02:42:26.360
So it's kind of like Monster Hunter, it sounds like.

02:42:26.360 --> 02:42:27.800
No, it's very cute.

02:42:27.800 --> 02:42:28.840
It's less Monster Hunter.

02:42:28.840 --> 02:42:30.600
You're not really fighting things.

02:42:30.600 --> 02:42:33.080
It's just cool.

02:42:33.080 --> 02:42:34.080
You should check it out.

02:42:34.080 --> 02:42:35.080
It's cute.

02:42:35.080 --> 02:42:36.080
All right.

02:42:36.080 --> 02:42:38.000
Uh, Darsakra, is that anything you've ever played?

02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:39.000
I'm not interested in it.

02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:40.000
It sounds really dull.

02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:41.000
It's cute.

02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:42.000
You should check it out.

02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:43.000
Lisa, watch the trailer.

02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:44.200
Kossin in chat.

02:42:44.200 --> 02:42:45.600
Question number five.

02:42:45.600 --> 02:42:48.520
What's the best flavor of chips in the world?

02:42:48.520 --> 02:42:49.720
That's a good question.

02:42:49.720 --> 02:42:50.720
You know, I do love.

02:42:50.720 --> 02:42:51.920
Do they mean chips or crisps?

02:42:51.920 --> 02:42:54.300
I think we mean American chips in this case.

02:42:54.300 --> 02:42:59.400
So I always get super involved in these Lay's do us a flavor contest, which were, which

02:42:59.400 --> 02:43:02.600
were on a break last year, but they're back this year and you know, they have the new

02:43:02.600 --> 02:43:05.220
flavors and you know, I got to try every single one.

02:43:05.220 --> 02:43:08.880
So here's, I just want to give you quickly my hot take on the new Lay's flavors because

02:43:08.880 --> 02:43:10.520
it's important.

02:43:10.520 --> 02:43:15.640
Eating bagel plus cream cheese tastes exactly the same to me as Maui onion.

02:43:15.640 --> 02:43:19.320
I don't know why bagel and cream cheese tastes like Maui onion, I guess because you know,

02:43:19.320 --> 02:43:22.960
onion bagel, but they taste the exact same to me.

02:43:22.960 --> 02:43:28.820
Fried green tomato, uh, has a mayo aftertaste to me and I can't fucking stand it.

02:43:28.820 --> 02:43:33.360
So that leaves by default, the winner crispy taco, which does taste like it tastes like

02:43:33.360 --> 02:43:34.360
a taco.

02:43:34.360 --> 02:43:38.720
So is it fried green tomato?

02:43:38.720 --> 02:43:43.920
But my favorite flavor of chips, honestly, I'm going to go basic because sometimes the

02:43:43.920 --> 02:43:47.360
basics are the best Pringles, which aren't even really potato.

02:43:47.360 --> 02:43:48.360
They're potato crisps.

02:43:48.360 --> 02:43:51.880
Like you can't even really say the chips, but Pringles, sour cream and onion, like forever

02:43:51.880 --> 02:43:53.600
my sentimental fave for sure.

02:43:53.600 --> 02:43:55.340
Uh, Loki, do you have a favorite?

02:43:55.340 --> 02:43:59.560
It's a little unconventional, but I'm going to say poker because it tastes like smoking

02:43:59.560 --> 02:44:02.320
and despair.

02:44:02.320 --> 02:44:04.400
Dar Sakura.

02:44:04.400 --> 02:44:10.800
I've always been really fond of sun chips, but I, but I do have like the plain sun chips,

02:44:10.800 --> 02:44:16.240
but I do have a special place in my heart for Charles chips, which you can only get

02:44:16.240 --> 02:44:18.240
in the Southeast.

02:44:18.240 --> 02:44:21.880
And um, what was the other one?

02:44:21.880 --> 02:44:28.160
The Maui onion, but it's that same flavor that has the zaps, zaps or is it a different

02:44:28.160 --> 02:44:29.160
one?

02:44:29.160 --> 02:44:31.000
Zaps has that nasty pickle shit.

02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:32.000
That's gross.

02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:33.000
Okay.

02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:34.000
Maui onion.

02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:37.720
Oh, I remember what my actual favorite is, Rob.

02:44:37.720 --> 02:44:42.840
It's the Tara sweets and beets, sweet potato and beet chips.

02:44:42.840 --> 02:44:43.840
All right.

02:44:43.840 --> 02:44:47.200
We're going to do just a few more here, but we're going to do these kinds of lightning

02:44:47.200 --> 02:44:48.200
rounds.

02:44:48.200 --> 02:44:51.080
We're going to pick it up and answer these fast Akuma JP.

02:44:51.080 --> 02:44:54.120
Why doesn't OLR play the uncharted series?

02:44:54.120 --> 02:44:56.600
Um, I've dabbled in it a little bit.

02:44:56.600 --> 02:44:57.600
You want to buy it for me?

02:44:57.600 --> 02:44:59.400
It's you can borrow mine if you want.

02:44:59.400 --> 02:45:01.040
I'm not interested in it.

02:45:01.040 --> 02:45:06.960
I honestly, I tried, but I just, my gamer ADD kicked in and I never finished.

02:45:06.960 --> 02:45:08.440
The games weren't bad though.

02:45:08.440 --> 02:45:11.520
I probably played more tomb Raider than I did uncharted one or two though.

02:45:11.520 --> 02:45:16.480
I really need to go back and give the trilogy a go on a PS4 Loki.

02:45:16.480 --> 02:45:17.480
I'm men just haven't.

02:45:17.480 --> 02:45:18.480
They look neat.

02:45:18.480 --> 02:45:19.960
I just haven't gone around to them.

02:45:19.960 --> 02:45:21.440
We can't play all the games.

02:45:21.440 --> 02:45:22.440
We can't.

02:45:22.440 --> 02:45:26.520
Um, it never really set off an interest for me, so I never played it.

02:45:26.520 --> 02:45:27.520
Let's see.

02:45:27.520 --> 02:45:28.520
Uh, come on, no Gus.

02:45:28.520 --> 02:45:31.240
This isn't a question, but it says, yes, we need a musical episode.

02:45:31.240 --> 02:45:40.800
Um, no, uh, you had one several hundred episodes, episode 69 with the karaoke revolution live

02:45:40.800 --> 02:45:41.800
on air, but dark soccer.

02:45:41.800 --> 02:45:43.080
I had the night off that night.

02:45:43.080 --> 02:45:44.080
She wasn't here.

02:45:44.080 --> 02:45:45.080
Believe it or not.

02:45:45.080 --> 02:45:46.080
I'll sing suddenly Seymour.

02:45:46.080 --> 02:45:47.080
All right.

02:45:47.080 --> 02:45:48.080
I like that song.

02:45:48.080 --> 02:45:49.080
We can do edit.

02:45:49.080 --> 02:45:50.080
No, no.

02:45:50.080 --> 02:45:53.960
I was what my feelings are hurt.

02:45:53.960 --> 02:45:55.880
The bitches shot me down.

02:45:55.880 --> 02:45:56.880
Let's do that right now.

02:45:56.880 --> 02:45:57.880
No, no, no.

02:45:58.240 --> 02:45:59.240
We're not going to do it.

02:45:59.240 --> 02:46:00.240
No, no, we will not be no.

02:46:00.240 --> 02:46:01.240
No.

02:46:01.240 --> 02:46:04.200
I was actually trying to make a point about it is I was watching little shop before us.

02:46:04.200 --> 02:46:09.440
Um, during the day of the eclipse, cause I could not get the songs out of my head.

02:46:09.440 --> 02:46:14.960
And then I went up looking like all these videos of Ellen green.

02:46:14.960 --> 02:46:17.120
Suddenly see more.

02:46:17.120 --> 02:46:20.440
Anyway, uh, where else are we?

02:46:20.440 --> 02:46:23.600
Uh, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, uh, Oh, S.J.

02:46:23.600 --> 02:46:28.840
Matt, what is the most expensive thing gaming related you've purchased that you've regretted?

02:46:28.840 --> 02:46:29.960
My PlayStation four pro

02:46:32.960 --> 02:46:41.640
Logie building my, the first, uh, main cabinet because it costs several thousand dollars

02:46:41.640 --> 02:46:43.320
and it was kind of a waste of money for that.

02:46:43.320 --> 02:46:48.280
I could have, there was a lot of cheaper alternatives for that dark soccer.

02:46:48.280 --> 02:46:49.660
I can't really think of anything.

02:46:49.660 --> 02:46:50.660
Maybe the engage.

02:46:50.660 --> 02:46:51.660
Okay.

02:46:51.660 --> 02:46:52.660
Good answer.

02:46:52.700 --> 02:46:53.700
I'm curious.

02:46:53.700 --> 02:46:54.700
Wait a minute.

02:46:54.700 --> 02:46:56.700
I thought you didn't pay for it.

02:46:56.700 --> 02:46:57.700
Okay.

02:46:57.700 --> 02:47:04.780
Um, um, um, um, um, I don't really regret anything.

02:47:04.780 --> 02:47:06.260
I regret nothing.

02:47:06.260 --> 02:47:08.180
No, seriously.

02:47:08.180 --> 02:47:11.220
It's like, I don't, we don't really have much shit in the collection.

02:47:11.220 --> 02:47:12.220
Oh yeah.

02:47:12.220 --> 02:47:20.060
I, I re I regret ever renting the WWF thunder or whatever WCW thunder, whatever thunder

02:47:20.100 --> 02:47:21.100
was.

02:47:21.100 --> 02:47:24.860
And it was so bad that blockbuster let us take it back and rent something different.

02:47:24.860 --> 02:47:30.900
Uh, dungeon buster says scariest time playing a Niantic game, Pokemon go, et cetera.

02:47:30.900 --> 02:47:31.900
Outside.

02:47:31.900 --> 02:47:36.260
Um, I got pulled over by the police playing Ingress, um, and it was because I didn't do

02:47:36.260 --> 02:47:40.820
anything wrong, but I drove through a neighborhood because I was trying to get to where a baseball

02:47:40.820 --> 02:47:41.820
diamond was.

02:47:41.820 --> 02:47:46.820
And as I drove through the neighborhood, there were all these cop cars up and down the street.

02:47:46.820 --> 02:47:49.260
And as I was driving down the street, I was like, you know what?

02:47:49.260 --> 02:47:50.820
I don't need the portal that badly.

02:47:50.820 --> 02:47:52.000
I'm going to just keep on going.

02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:55.260
I wasn't looking at my phone or anything cause I knew exactly where this portal was, where

02:47:55.260 --> 02:47:58.260
I go to park so I can get to the portal and all that stuff.

02:47:58.260 --> 02:48:02.400
So, um, I was driving down the street and all these cop cars were there and I just noped

02:48:02.400 --> 02:48:03.400
the fuck out.

02:48:03.400 --> 02:48:07.540
Well, sure enough, one of them cop cars pulls right out, follows me, pulls me over and is

02:48:07.540 --> 02:48:09.820
like, uh, what were you doing driving through there?

02:48:09.820 --> 02:48:13.300
Because my, at the time I just bought that car that I have now, cause it was about a

02:48:13.300 --> 02:48:14.300
year ago.

02:48:14.300 --> 02:48:16.520
So my plates were temporary plates.

02:48:16.520 --> 02:48:18.260
So like I just had all the signs.

02:48:18.260 --> 02:48:22.780
So apparently they were looking for somebody and when a unmarked car came through the neighborhood

02:48:22.780 --> 02:48:26.180
looking suspicious that noped the fuck out of there, they wanted to ask.

02:48:26.180 --> 02:48:30.060
So I had to actually explain Ingress, but thank God, I had thought, never thought I'd

02:48:30.060 --> 02:48:33.740
say this, but thank God Pokemon Go was a thing because I said to the officer, I said, okay,

02:48:33.740 --> 02:48:34.940
you know, Pokemon Go.

02:48:34.940 --> 02:48:35.940
He said, yeah.

02:48:35.940 --> 02:48:38.040
I said, this is a very similar game.

02:48:38.040 --> 02:48:41.540
That baseball diamond over there that you guys are in front of is where I was trying

02:48:41.540 --> 02:48:42.540
to go.

02:48:42.540 --> 02:48:44.100
And he said, show me the game.

02:48:44.100 --> 02:48:46.620
And so I showed him the game and I showed him the baseball diamond and you know, he

02:48:46.620 --> 02:48:51.820
was kind of like, you know, he nerd, well, I think he was just more like, I don't know

02:48:51.820 --> 02:48:55.020
if he believed me at first because I still have the, I still had, it was so new.

02:48:55.020 --> 02:48:57.140
I had the paper registration and all that shit.

02:48:57.140 --> 02:48:58.140
Right.

02:48:58.140 --> 02:49:01.740
So, you know, he, but it took, it took a good 15 minutes, but he ran it and then he was

02:49:01.740 --> 02:49:03.860
like, all right, you didn't do anything wrong.

02:49:03.860 --> 02:49:07.380
So I was like, I know I didn't do anything wrong, so I won't be going over there.

02:49:07.380 --> 02:49:08.380
That pissed me off.

02:49:08.380 --> 02:49:09.380
I could have thrown a field.

02:49:09.380 --> 02:49:12.140
It would have been like 700 MU and I couldn't do it.

02:49:12.140 --> 02:49:14.620
Fucking resistance put those fucking police people out there.

02:49:14.620 --> 02:49:15.620
All right.

02:49:15.620 --> 02:49:16.620
All right.

02:49:16.620 --> 02:49:20.340
Um, let's see, lastly, let's say, uh, Oh yeah.

02:49:20.340 --> 02:49:21.540
And that's still not a map points out.

02:49:21.540 --> 02:49:22.540
I didn't answer the question.

02:49:22.540 --> 02:49:23.540
Oh, I'm sorry.

02:49:23.540 --> 02:49:24.540
Yes.

02:49:24.540 --> 02:49:29.820
I didn't realize you had a scary Pokemon go moment riding with you.

02:49:29.820 --> 02:49:30.820
Would you like to share something too?

02:49:30.820 --> 02:49:31.820
Loki?

02:49:31.820 --> 02:49:34.940
I don't think I've ever had a scary moment.

02:49:34.940 --> 02:49:35.940
I've had a moment.

02:49:35.940 --> 02:49:36.940
I was pissed off.

02:49:36.940 --> 02:49:37.940
Uh, let's see.

02:49:37.940 --> 02:49:42.460
A student her mat says, Rob did play ingress and single digit temperatures during magfest.

02:49:42.460 --> 02:49:43.460
That is, that is true.

02:49:43.460 --> 02:49:44.460
All right.

02:49:44.460 --> 02:49:45.460
One more.

02:49:46.300 --> 02:49:47.300
This is a good one for message.

02:49:47.300 --> 02:49:50.640
You and her mat who says, uh, we need some O L R or vog t-shirts.

02:49:50.640 --> 02:49:52.300
Can we make those happen someday?

02:49:52.300 --> 02:49:56.100
Shout out to any listeners that are able to design t-shirts that would want to help out

02:49:56.100 --> 02:49:57.100
on this.

02:49:57.100 --> 02:49:58.100
You know what I've done?

02:49:58.100 --> 02:50:00.380
I've designed vog shirts.

02:50:00.380 --> 02:50:02.340
I designed the logo that went on the shirt.

02:50:02.340 --> 02:50:03.340
Those.

02:50:03.340 --> 02:50:04.340
Okay.

02:50:04.340 --> 02:50:07.100
Those shirts were those little polo shirts that we kind of did for hosts.

02:50:07.100 --> 02:50:08.980
I could design a shirt, no problem.

02:50:08.980 --> 02:50:12.700
Let's let's look at like a generic shirt that we could wear, but I wouldn't want to do something

02:50:12.700 --> 02:50:13.700
more than just the logo.

02:50:13.700 --> 02:50:14.700
You know what I mean?

02:50:15.460 --> 02:50:22.380
Something about orange challenge radio and on the back, it'll say, eat my entire ass.

02:50:22.380 --> 02:50:24.300
I don't think that sells the show very well.

02:50:24.300 --> 02:50:25.300
I don't know.

02:50:25.300 --> 02:50:26.300
Obviously.

02:50:26.300 --> 02:50:28.220
So Lorraine standards for 15 plus years.

02:50:28.220 --> 02:50:29.220
Yeah.

02:50:29.220 --> 02:50:30.220
Okay.

02:50:30.220 --> 02:50:32.640
If you guys are talking to orange lounge radio shirts, then yes, we can do gutter humor.

02:50:32.640 --> 02:50:33.640
That's fine.

02:50:33.640 --> 02:50:39.340
If we do vog shirts, I have like an ocean of piss or piss into an ocean of piss that

02:50:39.340 --> 02:50:42.060
iTunes reviewing is still up somewhere.

02:50:42.060 --> 02:50:43.620
Oh, that's what we should do.

02:50:43.620 --> 02:50:44.620
We should take.

02:50:44.620 --> 02:50:45.620
Okay.

02:50:45.620 --> 02:50:46.620
We'll take orange.

02:50:46.620 --> 02:50:48.020
So this is the OLR shirt, not the vulture.

02:50:48.020 --> 02:50:51.720
We'll take OLR and we'll take some of our greatest reviews from iTunes.

02:50:51.720 --> 02:50:54.020
It's like pissing in an ocean of piss was one of them.

02:50:54.020 --> 02:50:59.660
Uh, I just take like all our one star reviews and just put them on a shirt, but that, yeah,

02:50:59.660 --> 02:51:03.340
I don't want to glamorize people doing one star reviews because then we're going to get

02:51:03.340 --> 02:51:04.500
more of them.

02:51:04.500 --> 02:51:08.580
So only five star reviews that were funny.

02:51:08.580 --> 02:51:14.020
I'm just going to do like the OLR world tour and it's going to be like here in Atlanta.

02:51:14.020 --> 02:51:15.020
That's it.

02:51:15.020 --> 02:51:16.020
All right.

02:51:16.020 --> 02:51:18.720
It'll be like the places we've actually been to her for the show.

02:51:18.720 --> 02:51:22.520
So we need to find, first off, we need to agree on an appropriate storefront cause Bobby

02:51:22.520 --> 02:51:25.960
is raising a point that he had a couple storefront ideas, but we kind of shot those down.

02:51:25.960 --> 02:51:29.340
So we need to figure out who's going to do it and kind of go from there.

02:51:29.340 --> 02:51:32.700
So we will, if the demand is there, we will work on it.

02:51:32.700 --> 02:51:37.560
I've heard there are some new t-shirt places that are like Kickstarter to Seattle where

02:51:37.560 --> 02:51:42.260
they don't print the shirt until like all the orders are in and then they do it.

02:51:42.260 --> 02:51:43.260
And I kind of like that model.

02:51:43.500 --> 02:51:44.500
Does that make sense?

02:51:44.500 --> 02:51:45.500
Yeah.

02:51:45.500 --> 02:51:46.500
Yeah.

02:51:46.500 --> 02:51:47.500
I like that idea.

02:51:47.500 --> 02:51:49.540
And then I think you get a better quality shirt than you do something like cafe press

02:51:49.540 --> 02:51:50.540
or something.

02:51:50.540 --> 02:51:51.540
Yeah.

02:51:51.540 --> 02:51:52.540
There's a lot more places.

02:51:52.540 --> 02:51:53.540
No one's going to use cafe press anymore.

02:51:53.540 --> 02:51:54.540
Exactly.

02:51:54.540 --> 02:51:55.540
There's more options.

02:51:55.540 --> 02:51:57.700
So I would, I would look into one of those types of sites or something.

02:51:57.700 --> 02:52:03.540
So um, I, we hear you and yes, we'll try to make something happen either on an OLR or

02:52:03.540 --> 02:52:04.920
a VOG level.

02:52:04.920 --> 02:52:11.220
If only I had a chance to meet with Bobby Black Wolf this week and you guys in our chat.

02:52:11.220 --> 02:52:15.660
Oh, and Akuma JP actually links me to Uniqlo.

02:52:15.660 --> 02:52:16.660
There was, I don't know what this is.

02:52:16.660 --> 02:52:19.940
I guess I'll bring this up, but I got to say there's some Uniqlo shops here in the U S

02:52:19.940 --> 02:52:23.460
and I've just been introduced to that chain cause we went to one in Chicago and actually

02:52:23.460 --> 02:52:25.180
bought one of their Nintendo shirts.

02:52:25.180 --> 02:52:26.180
That was awesome.

02:52:26.180 --> 02:52:27.700
It has like a big Mario sprite in the corner.

02:52:27.700 --> 02:52:28.700
Okay.

02:52:28.700 --> 02:52:29.700
Yeah.

02:52:29.700 --> 02:52:30.980
This is like the peanut sprites and stuff.

02:52:30.980 --> 02:52:32.420
So there's, there's still some stuff in here.

02:52:32.420 --> 02:52:33.420
It's really cute.

02:52:33.420 --> 02:52:36.820
So, um, yeah, there's some really cute pics, uh, really cute shirts in here.

02:52:36.820 --> 02:52:38.260
So yeah, I'm familiar with Uniqlo.

02:52:38.260 --> 02:52:39.260
It's a fun store.

02:52:39.260 --> 02:52:40.940
So, all right.

02:52:40.940 --> 02:52:41.940
We need to wrap up though.

02:52:41.940 --> 02:52:42.940
We need to get out.

02:52:42.940 --> 02:52:46.820
It's after nine o'clock and, uh, people have other things they want to do and, uh, so forth.

02:52:46.820 --> 02:52:48.500
So, uh, we're going to wrap up first.

02:52:48.500 --> 02:52:50.980
I'm going to say, thanks for listening to the questions.

02:52:50.980 --> 02:52:54.660
Uh, thanks for listening to Orange Launch Radio tonight and thanks for participating.

02:52:54.660 --> 02:52:57.340
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, please tell a friend or five

02:52:57.340 --> 02:52:58.380
about the show.

02:52:58.380 --> 02:53:01.860
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but only

02:53:01.860 --> 02:53:04.220
if the voices are here for us to use them.

02:53:04.220 --> 02:53:06.100
So, uh, please help us spread the word.

02:53:06.100 --> 02:53:08.180
A five star review on a nice site.

02:53:08.180 --> 02:53:09.180
Ursula for your voice.

02:53:09.180 --> 02:53:10.180
That's right.

02:53:10.180 --> 02:53:14.020
A nice five star review on a place like iTunes or a similar site wherever you found this

02:53:14.020 --> 02:53:15.020
show.

02:53:15.020 --> 02:53:16.300
Believe me, those go a long way.

02:53:16.300 --> 02:53:20.900
I think I've seen in the last year, one new review show up on iTunes.

02:53:20.900 --> 02:53:23.380
So could you help me out?

02:53:23.380 --> 02:53:24.380
Really appreciate it.

02:53:24.380 --> 02:53:27.660
Of course, many of you already did it years ago and I still appreciate that.

02:53:27.660 --> 02:53:29.620
Anyway, uh, other final thoughts.

02:53:29.620 --> 02:53:30.620
Let's get to it.

02:53:30.620 --> 02:53:32.020
Uh, Loki, your final thought tonight.

02:53:32.020 --> 02:53:35.520
I have to go home and watch Game of Thrones because my wife has no impulse control and

02:53:35.520 --> 02:53:39.000
she's on the internet and she's going to spoil it for herself.

02:53:39.000 --> 02:53:43.700
Um, I am going to watch Twin Peaks while I get ready to do some packing and so forth

02:53:43.700 --> 02:53:47.560
for Dragon Con cause I leave early on Wednesday.

02:53:47.560 --> 02:53:48.960
This year I have an early flight.

02:53:48.960 --> 02:53:52.880
Usually I get in late at night, but this year I'm getting in like Wednesday afternoon.

02:53:52.880 --> 02:53:58.140
So please don't rain out Dragon Con cause I do want to try to do some Pokemon Go and

02:53:58.140 --> 02:53:59.140
stuff outdoors.

02:53:59.140 --> 02:54:00.640
So please don't rain out my Dragon Con.

02:54:00.640 --> 02:54:02.640
Uh, Dark Soccer, your final thought.

02:54:02.640 --> 02:54:04.480
I fucking called that shit.

02:54:05.240 --> 02:54:06.240
All right, that's going to do it.

02:54:06.240 --> 02:54:07.240
We just-

02:54:07.240 --> 02:54:08.240
Rob?

02:54:08.240 --> 02:54:09.240
What?

02:54:09.240 --> 02:54:10.240
Tell Cersei it was me.

02:54:10.240 --> 02:54:11.240
Sure.

02:54:11.240 --> 02:54:12.760
Uh, we'll do it all again in 14 days.

02:54:12.760 --> 02:54:14.440
Have a great Labor Day weekend.

02:54:14.440 --> 02:54:16.440
Relax, have fun, game.

02:54:16.440 --> 02:54:21.880
Uh, I'm sure there's many conventions and not just, not just, uh, Dragon Con, but PAX.

02:54:21.880 --> 02:54:25.000
Uh, we have stuff here locally as well and I'm sure in your neighborhood as well.

02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:29.000
So have fun with whatever you're doing this weekend and we'll see you in 14 days with

02:54:29.000 --> 02:54:30.880
