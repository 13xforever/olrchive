00:00.000 --> 00:08.560
Hi, awkward intro tonight, sorry, but before we start, I want to address the unexpected

00:08.560 --> 00:11.720
hiatus that the show went on for a couple of weeks.

00:11.720 --> 00:15.140
This won't have anything to do with video games, so if you're looking for a video game

00:15.140 --> 00:19.620
and food chat, fast forward until you hear the music.

00:19.620 --> 00:24.400
If you've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio over the past few weeks, you've probably

00:24.400 --> 00:28.800
heard me talk about several times that my mom had been in and out of the hospital, including

00:28.800 --> 00:35.000
intensive care since February, really, when she had knee replacement surgery.

00:35.000 --> 00:39.980
I'm not going to overload you with the clinical details, but the diagnosis she ended up having

00:39.980 --> 00:44.320
and the main thing that she was battling was a condition called myasthenia gravis, which

00:44.320 --> 00:49.560
is a neurological condition that can cause droopy eyelids, trouble talking, and for most

00:49.560 --> 00:54.560
people, and I want to emphasize this if you know anyone that has this, for most people,

00:54.560 --> 00:58.280
this ends up being pretty manageable and you can have a pretty normal life.

00:58.280 --> 01:03.500
But sometimes, and I think due to her age, this condition flares up in a crisis and this

01:03.500 --> 01:08.580
means you can have extreme difficulty breathing to the point that you have to go on a ventilator

01:08.580 --> 01:11.560
and that's why mom had been in the hospital for a few weeks.

01:11.560 --> 01:16.960
She had a crisis, she started improving, meds caused another crisis, she started improving,

01:16.960 --> 01:22.400
she had other issues, so it was just kind of a back and forth.

01:22.400 --> 01:28.000
So a few days after the last episode we did, I got a phone call while at my day job that

01:28.120 --> 01:32.200
the lung muscles weren't getting better and they were wanting to do a feeding tube so

01:32.200 --> 01:34.340
that the lung muscles could recover.

01:34.340 --> 01:38.040
Now you have to remember that mom had been battling this condition for weeks and weeks

01:38.040 --> 01:43.320
on and off since February and when she heard she had to get a feeding tube, that was the

01:43.320 --> 01:48.040
point where she said, I've had enough, she's not going to be kept alive by a tube and really

01:48.040 --> 01:52.100
the doctors couldn't guarantee that it would fend off another crisis for much longer than

01:52.100 --> 01:53.460
another couple weeks anyway.

01:53.460 --> 01:59.020
So my mom said she was done, meaning done.

01:59.020 --> 02:04.760
And I spent many hours at the hospital that week and on Friday afternoon she passed away

02:04.760 --> 02:11.680
and my dad was there, both my siblings were there, so at least we had time to gather and

02:11.680 --> 02:13.240
all be there.

02:13.240 --> 02:17.460
So for those not on Twitter or listening to Bobby, this is why I've been away and why

02:17.460 --> 02:19.700
the studio at the house has been dark.

02:19.700 --> 02:23.760
As you can imagine, this didn't put me in a good space for a little while.

02:23.760 --> 02:27.640
And I know that those that knew why we've been on hold, you understand and I thank you

02:27.640 --> 02:32.120
for that, but I needed the time.

02:32.120 --> 02:36.340
My mom in those final days, she stressed to us that we needed to get on with our lives,

02:36.340 --> 02:40.160
but the reality is that that's a step that's going to take time.

02:40.160 --> 02:44.680
This is something that I've heard from many of you who've been in a similar situation

02:44.680 --> 02:47.060
going through a loss of this magnitude.

02:47.060 --> 02:52.200
So I was really humbled to find out just how many people I knew had gone through something

02:52.200 --> 02:58.140
like this and it's made me feel a lot less alone and I know the future is going to be

02:58.140 --> 03:02.580
okay even if it's changed.

03:02.580 --> 03:07.500
I know oftentimes we talk about the family that this regular Sunday night event has created

03:07.500 --> 03:12.980
over the past 15 years and I mean it when I say you all have helped me with this and

03:12.980 --> 03:17.980
this is why I want to be back here again tonight to keep this going.

03:17.980 --> 03:22.040
My mom should be remembered as someone that loved kids tremendously and always advocated

03:22.040 --> 03:27.620
for them from her lifelong career of raising two generations of kids, then becoming a preschool

03:27.620 --> 03:31.580
teacher, then raising a third generation as a nanny.

03:31.580 --> 03:35.640
But I know many of you didn't get to know that and will remember her from the few appearances

03:35.640 --> 03:37.640
she had on this show.

03:37.640 --> 03:42.400
She had a great sense of humor and I'm really grateful you guys got to hear that.

03:42.400 --> 03:46.840
I could try and dedicate tonight's show to my mom but that wouldn't be genuine because

03:46.840 --> 03:50.680
every show I've ever done has been influenced by mom.

03:50.680 --> 03:55.360
From 15 years of this, Hoard House, Pokestop, guys on show reading it's fundamental, Understation

03:55.360 --> 03:58.640
Live, Vanilla Sky, YouTube, Twitches, all of it.

03:58.640 --> 04:04.860
Mom is always going to be there a little bit in everything that I do.

04:04.860 --> 04:06.880
Tell the listeners about some good things I did.

04:06.880 --> 04:11.520
Didn't it make you proud when Orange Lounge Radio was in the newspaper and on the local

04:11.520 --> 04:12.520
news?

04:12.520 --> 04:13.520
Uh huh.

04:13.520 --> 04:14.520
Good.

04:14.520 --> 04:15.520
Very.

04:15.520 --> 04:19.200
She sounds so convinced.

04:19.200 --> 04:21.240
Alright mom, I appreciate you calling.

04:21.240 --> 04:23.760
I just wanted the listeners to see what my mom was really like.

04:23.760 --> 04:24.760
So there you go.

04:24.760 --> 04:29.760
Well, she's like, she's like a female rob.

04:41.520 --> 05:07.280
Hello my friends out there on the internet.

05:07.280 --> 05:11.040
Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

05:11.040 --> 05:18.960
It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight, August the 13th of 2017 with episode number 696

05:18.960 --> 05:25.040
of our show dedicated to video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle here at Studio

05:25.040 --> 05:28.120
N7 in lovely Sacramento, California.

05:28.120 --> 05:36.080
Myself Rob Roberts or Skye at S-K-I-E on Twitter with my co-hosts, hello dark soccer or Jamie

05:36.080 --> 05:37.080
Summers.

05:37.080 --> 05:38.080
Hi.

05:38.080 --> 05:39.080
Welcome back.

05:39.080 --> 05:40.080
Thank you.

05:40.120 --> 05:44.520
I know while we were on hiatus, you were doing some, I was calling it faux LR.

05:44.520 --> 05:45.520
You like that?

05:45.520 --> 05:47.200
You did some faux LR on your live stream.

05:47.200 --> 05:48.200
How did that go?

05:48.200 --> 05:49.200
It went alright.

05:49.200 --> 05:50.200
Yeah.

05:50.200 --> 05:55.640
Um, I decided to get some news and everything out of the way while I was trying to, uh,

05:55.640 --> 05:59.360
get all my streaming stuff put together because I hadn't done any streaming in a while.

05:59.360 --> 06:00.360
Sure.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.160
And, uh, I think it went okay.

06:02.160 --> 06:03.160
Yeah.

06:03.160 --> 06:05.840
I did catch a little bit of it last week.

06:05.840 --> 06:09.160
So and it looked like it was, you were playing everybody's gone to the rapture, which we

06:09.240 --> 06:10.240
Start to finish.

06:10.240 --> 06:11.240
What's that?

06:11.240 --> 06:12.240
Start to finish.

06:12.240 --> 06:13.240
Start to finish.

06:13.240 --> 06:14.240
You play the whole thing in one sitting?

06:14.240 --> 06:15.240
No, no.

06:15.240 --> 06:16.240
Oh, I was gonna say.

06:16.240 --> 06:17.240
I played it in like three settings.

06:17.240 --> 06:18.240
Okay.

06:18.240 --> 06:19.240
Still though.

06:19.240 --> 06:22.080
Cause the whole thing, I was going to do Mass Effect Andromeda and my game wouldn't

06:22.080 --> 06:23.080
load.

06:23.080 --> 06:24.080
Oh no.

06:24.080 --> 06:25.440
So I still haven't reinstalled it.

06:25.440 --> 06:29.680
That just means how much I've been wanting to play Mass Effect Andromeda.

06:29.680 --> 06:34.960
Um, so I'm gonna, um, probably give that a try again in the future.

06:34.960 --> 06:39.840
Um, but right now I'm actually kind of getting more into the narration game.

06:39.840 --> 06:43.960
So next is going to be the, that Edith Finch.

06:43.960 --> 06:45.440
Oh, whatever happened to Edith Finch?

06:45.440 --> 06:46.440
Yeah.

06:46.440 --> 06:47.440
I think it's called.

06:47.440 --> 06:48.440
Yeah.

06:48.440 --> 06:49.440
That game is great.

06:49.440 --> 06:50.440
I like this.

06:50.440 --> 06:53.880
I like the dark soccer plays emo games.

06:53.880 --> 06:55.680
Yeah.

06:55.680 --> 06:57.920
I might now cause I can do that in one sitting.

06:57.920 --> 07:00.320
I might do, um, Dear Esther as well.

07:00.320 --> 07:01.320
Oh yeah.

07:01.320 --> 07:02.320
Yeah.

07:02.320 --> 07:03.320
Cause that one was really pretty and I enjoyed it.

07:03.320 --> 07:04.320
Yeah.

07:04.680 --> 07:05.680
Yeah.

07:05.680 --> 07:06.680
Yeah.

07:06.680 --> 07:07.680
Yeah.

07:07.680 --> 07:08.680
They just had a remake on PS4 of that.

07:08.680 --> 07:09.680
Not that long ago.

07:09.680 --> 07:14.080
So I had this one period, um, at work where I'd managed to get like flex time off.

07:14.080 --> 07:17.480
So I was off the phone for like two hours, so I played it on my Mac at work.

07:17.480 --> 07:18.480
There you go.

07:18.480 --> 07:19.480
There you go.

07:19.480 --> 07:20.480
It was great.

07:20.480 --> 07:21.480
That's great.

07:21.480 --> 07:22.480
Um, what was it?

07:22.480 --> 07:23.480
There was another one I was gonna suggest.

07:23.480 --> 07:26.400
Oh, you should, you should be doing, um, you know, this, you know, we've been on break.

07:26.400 --> 07:28.760
It's been about three weeks since we did a show and I think, I feel like one of those

07:28.760 --> 07:33.360
games is kind of like come and gone is the dream daddy dating game.

07:33.400 --> 07:34.400
I haven't started it.

07:34.400 --> 07:38.480
I didn't pick that up yet cause I just, you know, obviously the last three weeks have

07:38.480 --> 07:39.480
been pretty crazy.

07:39.480 --> 07:42.600
Um, so I just kind of missed that whole boat.

07:42.600 --> 07:46.520
So, but I, I feel like that's a game you should be streaming.

07:46.520 --> 07:47.600
I'll make a daddy.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.880
If you do pigeons, Jamie, why not daddy?

07:49.880 --> 07:51.600
I still have more pigeons to do.

07:51.600 --> 07:52.600
That's right.

07:52.600 --> 08:01.320
Um, but also, um, I'm thinking I am level 72 now in Dragon Ball Xenoverse.

08:01.320 --> 08:02.320
Oh wow.

08:02.320 --> 08:10.000
So I'm coming up to level cap and, um, I just did like, I'll get into that for my gaming

08:10.000 --> 08:15.360
week, but good Lord, I was going to start streaming some of that, but it's gotten kind

08:15.360 --> 08:16.360
of weird.

08:16.360 --> 08:17.360
Okay.

08:17.360 --> 08:21.280
And it is so off Canon that it makes my brain hurt.

08:21.280 --> 08:22.280
All right.

08:22.280 --> 08:25.600
Well, let's check in with a tech master, Loki, joining us once again.

08:25.600 --> 08:26.600
How are you, Loki?

08:26.600 --> 08:27.600
I'm fine.

08:27.600 --> 08:30.040
Now you got, you got really sick over the break.

08:30.040 --> 08:31.040
Yeah.

08:31.040 --> 08:32.040
Fun times.

08:32.160 --> 08:34.640
Because there was, I'm going to, I'm going to be honest, there was a part of me that

08:34.640 --> 08:37.820
was thinking, should we do last week?

08:37.820 --> 08:39.760
You know, I was kind of on the fence last week.

08:39.760 --> 08:43.680
I was kind of like half ready, but I was a little worried, you know, but, uh, then what

08:43.680 --> 08:47.000
kind of sealed it for me was that I heard you were really sick and it was like, all

08:47.000 --> 08:51.120
right, let's, let's just, I would have still done it, but I would have probably been coughing

08:51.120 --> 08:56.520
and wheezing and you know, I still have like, kind of like they call it, I think they call

08:56.520 --> 08:57.760
it rails or whatever.

08:57.760 --> 09:03.040
It's basically, imagine the sensation of having like a carbonated beverage in your lungs.

09:03.040 --> 09:10.280
I didn't want to do the show at 70%, 99.9%, nothing but almost the finest for our listeners.

09:10.280 --> 09:12.160
I think, I think we're good.

09:12.160 --> 09:13.160
So it would have been fine.

09:13.160 --> 09:14.760
It would have been, it was great though.

09:14.760 --> 09:20.400
Cause like one thing that, that the one advantage of being that sick is I was able to do the

09:20.400 --> 09:25.920
like, uh, like some evil silent Hill voice or like the ring voice or whatever you call

09:25.920 --> 09:26.920
that.

09:26.920 --> 09:31.280
Like pretty, uh, if I could do that with like without, like in the grudge, it was the grudge,

09:31.280 --> 09:32.280
the grudge.

09:32.280 --> 09:33.280
Yeah.

09:33.280 --> 09:34.280
Let me see, like, see if I breathe out all the way.

09:34.280 --> 09:35.440
Sometimes I can,

09:35.440 --> 09:40.640
I mean, that's like my lungs right now.

09:40.640 --> 09:41.640
That's okay.

09:41.640 --> 09:42.840
It was much worse later on.

09:42.840 --> 09:49.440
Like you could make a really gruesome sounding sounds like, Oh my God, why are you at work?

09:49.440 --> 09:50.440
Go home.

09:50.440 --> 09:51.440
You know, that type of thing.

09:51.440 --> 09:52.440
I believe you.

09:52.440 --> 09:53.760
Do you, do you remember when I had walking pneumonia?

09:53.760 --> 09:54.760
Like what?

09:54.760 --> 09:55.760
Six years ago.

09:56.600 --> 09:57.600
Oh yeah.

09:57.600 --> 09:58.600
I believe that noise.

09:58.600 --> 09:59.600
Trust me.

09:59.600 --> 10:04.400
Well, I don't know if it like, I see I at least had bronchitis, but then that the medicine

10:04.400 --> 10:05.400
wasn't really helping.

10:05.400 --> 10:08.960
So they put me on an antibiotic, which is normally what they do for pneumonia.

10:08.960 --> 10:09.960
And then it went away.

10:09.960 --> 10:13.340
So maybe I had pneumonia or they just never did anything to confirm it.

10:13.340 --> 10:16.200
It's probably for the best if you had all that, that you didn't show up here at the

10:16.200 --> 10:17.200
house.

10:17.200 --> 10:18.200
Yes.

10:18.200 --> 10:20.720
Cause you know, the last thing I needed the past couple of weeks was to be sick, but I'm

10:20.720 --> 10:21.720
glad you're doing better.

10:21.720 --> 10:22.720
Um, so

10:22.720 --> 10:23.720
pneumonia is not contagious.

10:24.360 --> 10:28.720
I overheard, um, Bobby talking to you before the show tonight and I know he was razzing

10:28.720 --> 10:31.840
you a little bit cause she didn't really get to work on your game, although then he felt

10:31.840 --> 10:32.840
bad cause you were sick.

10:32.840 --> 10:33.840
So it was like, Oh, he

10:33.840 --> 10:34.840
tried.

10:34.840 --> 10:39.520
I like, I had the laptop in my lap and I was just exhausted because I don't sleep a lot

10:39.520 --> 10:40.520
as it is.

10:40.520 --> 10:45.160
And then, you know, constantly coughing and trying to like force yourself not to be just

10:45.160 --> 10:48.840
like coffee all the time because when you're coughing that much, then it makes your airways

10:48.840 --> 10:52.200
get tighter, which means I have to use the inhaler, which wasn't working that well.

10:52.200 --> 10:55.000
And it was just, it was a mess.

10:55.000 --> 11:01.040
And so like, I really wanted to, but my brain just is like, I can't do this.

11:01.040 --> 11:05.120
And even last night, like I was like, okay, I'm gonna work on something.

11:05.120 --> 11:10.760
I need to do something and I just, I can't, I just need the rest, I guess.

11:10.760 --> 11:11.760
I don't know.

11:11.760 --> 11:14.360
But I want to, I, I've been trying every day.

11:14.360 --> 11:17.160
It's just brain has not wanted to do that.

11:17.160 --> 11:18.160
Yeah, I understand.

11:18.160 --> 11:19.160
I understand.

11:19.160 --> 11:20.720
You know, we got to give you a little crap though.

11:20.720 --> 11:21.720
Once in a while.

11:21.760 --> 11:25.840
And I completely understand and I, I do want to work on stuff actually right now being

11:25.840 --> 11:29.920
that of course I didn't make the game jam, which I kind of knew from before I started

11:29.920 --> 11:32.840
the game jam that that wasn't going to happen.

11:32.840 --> 11:33.840
We all knew Loki.

11:33.840 --> 11:38.240
We all knew that being sick didn't help, you know, on top of that.

11:38.240 --> 11:42.080
But now I'm kind of at the point like, okay, well what do I work on now?

11:42.080 --> 11:44.800
Do I finish what I was working on?

11:44.800 --> 11:48.000
Do I, everyone keeps bugging me to work on that.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
It's time to card game.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
Should I do that?

11:50.000 --> 11:52.560
Should I do the other thing I was working on?

11:52.560 --> 11:54.960
It's like, I'm kind of like, what do I want to work on now?

11:54.960 --> 11:55.960
I don't know.

11:55.960 --> 11:57.600
So I have to figure that out.

11:57.600 --> 11:59.360
All right, well good luck trying to figure that out.

11:59.360 --> 12:04.200
I do want to introduce our chat room over at live.vog network.com because we do tape

12:04.200 --> 12:08.720
live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby

12:08.720 --> 12:14.040
Black Wolf show at the voice geeks network, vog network.com where Bobby says coding wall

12:14.040 --> 12:15.040
six sucks.

12:15.040 --> 12:18.120
I've had to do that before because they were paying me to, but if they weren't paying me

12:18.120 --> 12:19.120
to nope.

12:19.120 --> 12:20.120
Yeah.

12:20.120 --> 12:23.740
And speaking about like sleeping, you know, I, I couldn't sleep very well either.

12:23.740 --> 12:27.440
So that, you know, that just, it didn't help.

12:27.440 --> 12:29.120
And then I was working on top of that.

12:29.120 --> 12:35.060
So you know, um, I do want to, I do want to, it's hard to motivate myself.

12:35.060 --> 12:38.920
It's really hard to stay motivated cause I, by the end of the day after the kids, cause

12:38.920 --> 12:44.600
the kids are so fucking draining, it's just like, I have no energy left to, and trying

12:44.600 --> 12:48.080
to like do critical thinking and like thinking in that coding.

12:48.080 --> 12:49.880
It's just, it's hard.

12:49.880 --> 12:50.880
It's really hard.

12:50.880 --> 12:55.600
Much, you know, I have so much respect for people that actually do that have a family

12:55.600 --> 13:00.520
or they abandon their family to work on a game for a while, but, um, you know, seriously

13:00.520 --> 13:02.320
it's so much respect for those people.

13:02.320 --> 13:06.000
Uh, looking at chat, a hit stun says I tried to do Ludum Dare.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
Did I pronounce that right?

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
Ludum Dare.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
I think that's right.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.080
A couple of weeks ago and I couldn't finish the game, had to work the Sunday.

13:11.080 --> 13:12.080
So it happens.

13:12.080 --> 13:13.080
It happens.

13:13.080 --> 13:14.080
Real life gets in the way sometimes.

13:14.080 --> 13:17.520
I mean, there was a lot of things I wanted to do over the past couple of weeks and you

13:17.520 --> 13:19.320
know, just a lot of that got put on hold.

13:19.320 --> 13:23.520
Um, I, I was hoping finally this year I was going to get to California extreme because

13:23.520 --> 13:28.280
I haven't been to California extreme in like six years, but obviously everything that happened

13:28.280 --> 13:32.480
and by the way, I do want to just acknowledge, um, a lot of you saying very, very nice things

13:32.480 --> 13:34.320
about the intro to tonight's show.

13:34.320 --> 13:36.000
So just thank you very much.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.800
Um, I, I'm really feeling it all.

13:37.800 --> 13:38.800
So thank you.

13:38.800 --> 13:44.040
Um, so, but, but I wanted to go to California stream, but obviously I couldn't and, uh,

13:44.040 --> 13:46.160
you know, but dark soccer, you got to go to California streams.

13:46.360 --> 13:49.320
I mean, I know this is like two weeks ago at this point, but did you have a good time?

13:49.320 --> 13:50.320
Yeah.

13:50.320 --> 13:51.320
Had a really good time.

13:51.320 --> 13:52.320
Yeah.

13:52.320 --> 13:53.320
Um, got to play all kinds of things.

13:53.320 --> 13:56.520
I took pictures of everything that I played, but I played journey for you.

13:56.520 --> 13:57.520
Good.

13:57.520 --> 13:58.520
Thank you.

13:58.520 --> 13:59.520
Thank you.

13:59.520 --> 14:00.520
Appreciate it.

14:00.520 --> 14:01.520
Um, uh, I really didn't play any of the money.

14:01.520 --> 14:02.520
I'll be honest.

14:02.520 --> 14:03.520
That's all right.

14:03.520 --> 14:10.040
I was, I was, I just come out of the cast, so I was wearing my walking boot and it threw

14:10.040 --> 14:14.160
me way off balance a bit, but I would have liked to see some of the panels.

14:14.160 --> 14:16.880
I don't know if you do that stuff, but some of the classic game designers, I would have

14:16.880 --> 14:17.880
really been into that.

14:17.880 --> 14:21.600
So panels there now, I don't think they do a ton.

14:21.600 --> 14:25.640
They have like one room and they have like three or four panels, but you know, did a

14:25.640 --> 14:32.360
panel this year for, uh, cause he designed the new, um, star Wars pinball.

14:32.360 --> 14:36.600
Oh, I'm, I'm confusing classic game expo with this.

14:36.600 --> 14:37.600
That's one.

14:37.600 --> 14:38.600
Oh, sorry.

14:38.600 --> 14:39.600
And mix.

14:40.040 --> 14:47.120
I realized I was mixing up my companies now, but no, um, he did, um, uh, he did the new

14:47.120 --> 14:52.840
star Wars, uh, pinball, um, and, uh, which I got to play.

14:52.840 --> 14:53.840
It was pretty neat.

14:53.840 --> 14:54.840
Nice.

14:54.840 --> 14:55.840
Nice.

14:55.840 --> 14:56.840
Great.

14:56.840 --> 14:57.840
All right.

14:57.840 --> 14:58.840
Well, we'll get into more of our gaming weeks and stuff.

14:58.840 --> 15:01.320
We've been playing a little later, but I want to get in kicked off kickoff topic first.

15:01.320 --> 15:06.200
I do want to also say one thing I did do that was productive is I got a new mic to replay

15:06.200 --> 15:09.360
it because you guys might remember I was having some serious mic problems in the last couple

15:09.360 --> 15:10.360
of episodes.

15:10.360 --> 15:13.800
Um, so I did get a new mic, so I might sound a little different.

15:13.800 --> 15:16.280
Um, so, uh, just let me know if it sounds weird.

15:16.280 --> 15:20.400
It was running a little quiet in tests, so I've tried to bump it up a bit, but I think,

15:20.400 --> 15:21.640
I think we have it at a good point.

15:21.640 --> 15:24.840
Just let me know if it sounds weird to you guys over in our live chat room because it

15:24.840 --> 15:25.840
is live radio.

15:25.840 --> 15:27.560
Sometimes we have to fix things on the fly.

15:27.560 --> 15:30.600
Um, speaking of live stuff, I will be back on Twitch.

15:30.600 --> 15:33.000
I've, Twitch has been on hold this entire time as well.

15:33.000 --> 15:37.720
The last Twitch stream I did was the Splatoon thing I did after the last episode we did.

15:37.720 --> 15:39.920
So Twitch will be back tonight as well.

15:39.920 --> 15:42.400
So I want to just throw that out there as well.

15:42.400 --> 15:45.800
Uh, so anyway, let's talk about kickoff topic tonight.

15:45.800 --> 15:50.400
Um, one game that is kind of coming back all over again.

15:50.400 --> 15:51.440
This is very interesting.

15:51.440 --> 15:52.960
A lot of updates with this game.

15:52.960 --> 15:55.200
Jamie, you had a story about this, right?

15:55.200 --> 15:56.680
With No Man's Sky?

15:56.680 --> 15:57.680
Yes.

15:57.680 --> 15:58.680
Yeah.

15:58.680 --> 16:01.600
Tell us about it.

16:01.600 --> 16:02.600
The No Man's Sky?

16:02.600 --> 16:03.600
Yeah.

16:03.600 --> 16:04.600
The remake.

16:04.600 --> 16:05.600
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

16:05.600 --> 16:07.240
Well, not the remake, but like.

16:07.760 --> 16:08.760
The Atlas Rises update.

16:08.760 --> 16:09.760
Yeah.

16:09.760 --> 16:10.760
A little update that's going on.

16:10.760 --> 16:11.760
You know a little bit about this, right?

16:11.760 --> 16:12.760
Logie?

16:12.760 --> 16:13.760
Yeah.

16:13.760 --> 16:14.760
So they, they've been doing like updates.

16:14.760 --> 16:15.760
They had a couple before this that kind of improved.

16:15.760 --> 16:20.160
They have the whole, you know, um, building of your own bases and stuff, but now they

16:20.160 --> 16:22.280
have a whole bunch of new stuff added.

16:22.280 --> 16:29.200
So they've kind of revamped the whole storyline, added, um, improvements to their mission system,

16:29.200 --> 16:34.000
the, um, economies and also some other fun stuff.

16:34.000 --> 16:38.760
Um, so one thing, they have options now for galactic regeneration.

16:38.760 --> 16:42.360
So when you finish the game, it doesn't just give you like a random world.

16:42.360 --> 16:48.440
It's more of like a, um, you have different ways that you can do it.

16:48.440 --> 16:55.600
Like I think one of the ones I saw was more of like a, like a, I don't know, less hostile

16:55.600 --> 16:58.400
universe or something like that, I think was one of the options.

16:58.400 --> 17:00.040
Yeah, they did that.

17:00.040 --> 17:04.240
That was one of the patches they did, like the one, one patches like that.

17:04.240 --> 17:08.040
They had a version where you could do creative mode basis.

17:08.040 --> 17:09.040
It's like Minecraft too.

17:09.040 --> 17:10.040
Yeah.

17:10.040 --> 17:11.880
This is more of like once you finish the game, it regenerates everything.

17:11.880 --> 17:16.920
They had a new biome, so now there's new planets, new, um, stuff that actually looks different.

17:16.920 --> 17:21.080
They actually have the sand worms now finally, like in the trailer, those are actually a

17:21.080 --> 17:22.080
thing now.

17:22.080 --> 17:23.080
A crash.

17:23.080 --> 17:24.200
Oh, go ahead.

17:24.200 --> 17:26.840
There's that pseudo multiplayer joint exploration.

17:26.840 --> 17:32.360
But yeah, you, you had something on this where like people finally did something that

17:32.360 --> 17:33.560
they were trying to do a year ago.

17:33.560 --> 17:34.560
Right?

17:34.560 --> 17:35.560
Yeah.

17:35.560 --> 17:36.560
Meet up at the same location.

17:36.560 --> 17:37.560
Yeah.

17:37.560 --> 17:38.560
Problem is though, that's kind of still very basic.

17:38.560 --> 17:43.280
It reminds me a lot of like, um, I don't know if you remember in fable and stuff when you're

17:43.280 --> 17:47.800
playing, you'd see like a spark flying around and that was the other player.

17:47.800 --> 17:50.440
And then you could join in your game and that won't accept this.

17:50.440 --> 17:52.760
You can't actually join in the game.

17:52.760 --> 17:54.280
There's not really anything that you can do.

17:54.280 --> 17:59.000
But you, your impact on the environment doesn't necessarily show up on their screen.

17:59.000 --> 18:02.480
However, that's one of the other things that they add is you can actually modify the environment

18:02.480 --> 18:06.580
so you can actually kind of draw with like voxels and stuff in the game to like create

18:06.580 --> 18:09.040
your own landmarks and things, which is kind of cool.

18:09.040 --> 18:17.240
Um, they added new trading, new NPCs, um, crashed, um, huge crash ships.

18:17.240 --> 18:25.160
And I want to say, I think there was, um, different units, uh, harvesters, you know,

18:25.160 --> 18:26.160
more weapon types.

18:26.160 --> 18:32.200
I mean, it's just a lot of shit, visual improvements, like 4k textures now, higher resolution textures.

18:32.200 --> 18:36.960
Um, so yeah, and it's on sale on PC at least.

18:36.960 --> 18:40.400
I think it's, I don't know what it is on, um, PlayStation 4 right now.

18:40.400 --> 18:41.680
I have it on PlayStation 4.

18:41.680 --> 18:43.440
Just look in your nearby clearance bin.

18:43.440 --> 18:45.880
It's uh, it's showing up a lot of those places.

18:45.880 --> 18:47.680
I'm not trying, and I'm not trying to be a bitch.

18:47.680 --> 18:48.680
Like that's just the reality.

18:48.680 --> 18:54.600
Like, you know, obviously this game had some serious, yeah, when it had some serious blowback

18:54.600 --> 18:59.320
when it first came out and you know, that caused the price to drop significantly.

18:59.320 --> 19:02.400
Now I, you know, you guys know how it was.

19:02.400 --> 19:07.800
I didn't buy into the hype beforehand, so I didn't listen to any of the promises or

19:07.800 --> 19:08.800
any of that stuff.

19:08.800 --> 19:11.280
And when I bought the game, I was fine with it.

19:11.280 --> 19:13.380
You know, I didn't, I didn't like love it.

19:13.380 --> 19:16.780
I didn't hate it though, but like some people like really, really hated it.

19:16.780 --> 19:21.980
Um, so I did, I did pop it in yesterday to take a look at it with some of the changes

19:21.980 --> 19:26.180
and I do have to say, I was like, okay, wow, yeah, cause I found one of those big crashed

19:26.180 --> 19:31.300
ships because now there's a story that takes you to one in the opening sequence of the

19:31.300 --> 19:32.300
game.

19:32.300 --> 19:33.900
And so I was like, okay, this is different.

19:33.900 --> 19:35.900
This is like a lot of like changed stuff.

19:35.900 --> 19:36.900
Yeah.

19:36.900 --> 19:38.100
I think they have a whole nother storyline as well.

19:38.100 --> 19:39.100
They do.

19:39.100 --> 19:40.100
They do.

19:40.100 --> 19:43.660
But in the opening of the game, you're not just like stranded with no explanation.

19:43.660 --> 19:45.500
You're actually kind of handheld a little bit.

19:45.500 --> 19:49.460
The game gives you quests like here's how to fix your gun.

19:49.460 --> 19:50.720
Here's how to fix your ship.

19:50.720 --> 19:54.100
And it kind of handholds you through those opening sequences of the game so you understand

19:54.100 --> 19:55.860
a little better what's going on.

19:55.860 --> 20:01.300
So I mean the game's kind of changed all that, but let me ask both of you guys, does it matter

20:01.300 --> 20:02.300
at this point?

20:02.300 --> 20:05.060
Cause I think that's, I think that's the biggest thing most people are struck with is that

20:05.060 --> 20:10.900
most people have made up their mind on no man's sky and here we are a year after the

20:10.900 --> 20:11.900
fact.

20:11.900 --> 20:12.900
I think it does actually.

20:12.900 --> 20:16.900
I think it does because you look at like even the reviews on steam, the reviews weren't

20:16.900 --> 20:18.740
very positive on steam.

20:18.740 --> 20:24.860
I think when it came out and now they're mostly positive, I mean it has made an impact.

20:24.860 --> 20:29.360
People are liking the changes that they're doing with it and I think, yeah, it does.

20:29.360 --> 20:34.140
It's not going to be like, Oh, this is not going to, you know, sell a ton of units in

20:34.140 --> 20:36.320
the beginning because you can't go back in time.

20:36.320 --> 20:43.580
But I think that as far as, you know, keeping it going and stuff, it is gonna make a difference.

20:43.580 --> 20:48.340
It's nice to see them actually putting the effort in to fix the game and now it's kind

20:48.340 --> 20:51.940
of looking more like what they were originally proposing.

20:51.940 --> 20:55.900
Jamie, I can't recall if you played the game a year ago.

20:55.900 --> 20:59.740
I feel like you, you didn't really yet, but does all this news about the changes and updates

20:59.740 --> 21:02.940
does it kind of make you go, Oh, maybe, maybe now it's worth my time?

21:02.940 --> 21:03.940
Nope.

21:04.740 --> 21:05.740
Not really.

21:05.740 --> 21:06.740
I'm glad for the people who enjoy the game.

21:06.740 --> 21:10.380
I just thought it was neat that the, you know, after all this time they're finally implementing

21:10.380 --> 21:13.140
the things that people had asked for.

21:13.140 --> 21:15.380
So no, it's not enough to make me want to play it.

21:15.380 --> 21:17.900
I've got other things in my queue.

21:17.900 --> 21:22.220
Is anyone surprised that the creators of this game didn't just, cause I, you know, I have

21:22.220 --> 21:25.740
to admit a little bit like I'm a, I'm a little surprised that they didn't just shelve it

21:25.740 --> 21:29.280
at some point, you know, and say, okay, we, we did our best.

21:29.280 --> 21:30.280
It wasn't good enough.

21:30.280 --> 21:34.880
We're going to just lessons learned for our new project, which was, you know, honestly

21:34.880 --> 21:42.120
I could see that's a very easy option, but you know, it's good for them to actually put

21:42.120 --> 21:46.440
out a Polish, you know, at least get it to where it needs to be because people are going

21:46.440 --> 21:49.440
to, I mean, they're going to remember it was a clusterfuck to begin with, but they're also

21:49.440 --> 21:54.240
going to remember that they actually took the time to fix all that stuff.

21:54.240 --> 21:57.740
And that says a lot because there's a lot of big publishers out there that will release

21:57.740 --> 22:03.980
games and they'll never fix them like avalanche in just cause three.

22:03.980 --> 22:08.740
I mean, that took forever to get fixed and it's still not very fixed.

22:08.740 --> 22:12.420
So do you think this gives this guy, Sean Murray, right from hello games, do you think

22:12.420 --> 22:17.180
it gets, you know, obviously he's the guy that a lot of internet people are taking issue

22:17.180 --> 22:20.820
with because of all these promises that they felt were unfulfilled.

22:20.820 --> 22:25.180
Did you think this gives him some credit back that, well, he fulfilled a good chunk of them

22:25.180 --> 22:26.180
a year later.

22:26.180 --> 22:27.420
It took a year, but it helps.

22:27.420 --> 22:30.900
It's better than if he didn't because if he didn't, then if he's kind of come out with

22:30.900 --> 22:34.260
his next game or whatever, people are like, I'm not going to believe that shit.

22:34.260 --> 22:35.260
Yeah.

22:35.260 --> 22:39.100
Then again, there's Peter Molyneux and he used to make all sorts of wild fucking accusations

22:39.100 --> 22:43.460
of shit that he was going to have in his game and he didn't fulfill that shit time after

22:43.460 --> 22:44.460
time.

22:44.460 --> 22:47.780
So, and people seem to buy his games just fine.

22:47.780 --> 22:48.780
I don't know.

22:48.780 --> 22:52.340
Maybe it's just, it definitely helps.

22:52.340 --> 22:55.180
So it's good to see that they're doing that.

22:55.180 --> 22:59.620
Let's look at some of the comments in chat over at live.vog.network.com.

22:59.620 --> 23:05.300
Bobby Blackwell says, the Steam reviews got curated more to only be people who bought

23:05.300 --> 23:06.820
the game and didn't refund that.

23:06.820 --> 23:09.300
He actually said either that or the Steam reviews.

23:09.300 --> 23:13.540
And then after that, the people who had negative reviews got negated when they refunded.

23:13.540 --> 23:18.520
So that could be something is that, you know, I think what Steam does, it kind of, at least

23:18.520 --> 23:23.360
when I was looking at it in the store, because I contemplated double dipping on PC, I did.

23:23.400 --> 23:27.280
I didn't do it, but I did contemplate it because it is on sale for like 23 bucks.

23:27.280 --> 23:29.440
It is on sale for 23 bucks.

23:29.440 --> 23:34.960
And I noticed that it's, it showed, you know, this percent was negative, but on top of that,

23:34.960 --> 23:40.600
it says like 80%, 75% within the last 30 days are positive.

23:40.600 --> 23:43.280
And it was highlighting that almost more so than the other figure.

23:43.280 --> 23:44.840
And I thought that was interesting.

23:44.840 --> 23:48.400
So it does kind of, it does kind of show that I'm still thinking about, but I'm like, do

23:48.400 --> 23:49.400
I really need to buy another?

23:49.400 --> 23:51.280
I have this on PlayStation four.

23:51.280 --> 23:53.240
I do like the fact that it looks nicer on PC.

23:53.240 --> 23:56.600
I have a PC that can run it nice now.

23:56.600 --> 23:59.120
It is tempting.

23:59.120 --> 24:02.760
Kaijuto in chat says, I love the OG No Man's Sky.

24:02.760 --> 24:04.480
Haven't tried the new version yet.

24:04.480 --> 24:05.480
Gamers suck.

24:05.480 --> 24:09.040
I'm not surprised they didn't abandon the game because I've seen many devs do this.

24:09.040 --> 24:12.200
They always backpedal for gamer babies.

24:12.200 --> 24:16.100
I think honestly though, I think he had good, great plans for this.

24:16.100 --> 24:17.220
He needed more time.

24:17.220 --> 24:19.440
Sony pushed him to release it.

24:19.960 --> 24:24.160
Time after time again, we see that it's these publishers pushing people to release these

24:24.160 --> 24:26.560
games and they're not quite ready to release them yet.

24:26.560 --> 24:31.280
That's probably true because the PlayStation four, I seem to remember that year, didn't

24:31.280 --> 24:34.200
have a lot of big games coming out.

24:34.200 --> 24:40.280
So No Man's Sky was really pushed as a God of War level type release.

24:40.280 --> 24:45.680
And so, okay, I could see that, but the game had already been delayed several times, hadn't

24:45.680 --> 24:46.680
it?

24:46.680 --> 24:47.680
Right.

24:47.680 --> 24:48.680
But I think it didn't come out in the summer.

24:48.920 --> 24:50.800
I kind of thought it was supposed to be like a fourth quarter.

24:50.800 --> 24:51.800
Yeah.

24:51.800 --> 24:54.080
It would have probably been better off a holiday when they could have got some of that or this

24:54.080 --> 24:55.440
other stuff in there for sure.

24:55.440 --> 25:03.280
So yeah, it'd be very interesting how much did that influence play into it for sure.

25:03.280 --> 25:07.640
Well anyway, it sounds like, you know, with some of these, I kind of think if you've never

25:07.640 --> 25:14.040
played the game, if you like those type of Minecraft open world building games, I think

25:14.040 --> 25:17.220
there might be something here for you, especially, you know, now that there's like a story that

25:17.260 --> 25:22.860
kind of gives it like, well, there was kind of a story before, but it was kind of, there's

25:22.860 --> 25:23.860
more stuff to do now.

25:23.860 --> 25:24.860
Exactly.

25:24.860 --> 25:25.860
It just feels more fleshed out now.

25:25.860 --> 25:31.580
Like it feels like you're not just left in space for the sake of being left in space.

25:31.580 --> 25:34.900
You know, you, you have a framework for what's going on.

25:34.900 --> 25:39.520
So I feel like there's, there's a sufficient amount of handholding yet you're still able

25:39.520 --> 25:40.860
to do whatever the hell you want to do.

25:40.860 --> 25:44.800
You can ignore all that stuff completely if you want and just build whatever you want.

25:44.800 --> 25:49.840
So yeah, so I think, I think the game's worth checking out if you haven't checked it out,

25:49.840 --> 25:53.220
if you're into those type of games, but if you're not into those type of games, I'm not

25:53.220 --> 25:56.640
sure there's anything here that's like going to sway your mind on it.

25:56.640 --> 26:01.140
Like if you're not into the Minecraft type of games, this might not be for you.

26:01.140 --> 26:03.840
So you know, there's that to consider as well.

26:03.840 --> 26:08.240
But I did, I did like, like that you could kind of like build stuff now.

26:08.240 --> 26:09.960
Like it felt more Minecraft like that.

26:09.960 --> 26:16.400
Like I, I built a beacon to find something that I was, it's all part of a story, but

26:16.400 --> 26:17.400
like I was building things.

26:17.400 --> 26:22.080
I don't remember being able to do in the first release of the game or it was a lot more difficult

26:22.080 --> 26:26.160
because you could kind of build, but it was very clunky in the inventory interface and

26:26.160 --> 26:27.160
that part's kind of gone.

26:27.160 --> 26:30.600
Well they even fixed a lot of the inventory stuff where now the inventory actually stacks.

26:30.600 --> 26:31.600
Oh yeah.

26:31.600 --> 26:32.600
Yes, yes.

26:32.600 --> 26:33.600
That happens.

26:33.600 --> 26:34.600
Thank you.

26:34.600 --> 26:39.760
And as part of the story, it handholds you through the process of expanding your inventory.

26:39.760 --> 26:43.000
It's not something you're left to your own devices to figure out like you were before

26:43.000 --> 26:47.360
when it was like, then it kind of spread around like, Oh, if you find one of these things,

26:47.360 --> 26:50.800
ask it to locate a drop off or whatever, and you can expand your inventory that way.

26:50.800 --> 26:53.380
Like they've, they handhold you through that now, which is nice.

26:53.380 --> 26:56.920
So I think more people will kind of be into it if they, they didn't get to see it the

26:56.920 --> 26:57.920
first time.

26:57.920 --> 27:00.240
And now it's what only 23 bucks to do it.

27:00.240 --> 27:01.800
So yay.

27:01.800 --> 27:05.360
Or even cheaper, probably if you can find it on PlayStation four or somewhere else.

27:05.360 --> 27:06.800
So all right.

27:06.800 --> 27:08.760
So No Man's Sky got updated.

27:08.760 --> 27:09.760
Check it out.

27:09.760 --> 27:11.680
If you think that's something you'd be into.

27:11.680 --> 27:15.080
Meanwhile, let's talk about what games we have been playing.

27:15.080 --> 27:18.920
We always like to do towards the top of the show a little bit of how was your gaming week.

27:18.920 --> 27:22.340
Obviously, I know it's been a few weeks, so how was your gaming time?

27:22.340 --> 27:24.560
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming time?

27:24.560 --> 27:28.080
Oh gosh, I played all the games.

27:28.080 --> 27:31.480
You know, and, and since we're covering a big period, we don't have to name every single

27:31.480 --> 27:32.480
game.

27:32.480 --> 27:33.480
Just kind of your highlights.

27:33.480 --> 27:34.480
If you want.

27:34.480 --> 27:35.480
Goodness.

27:35.480 --> 27:40.280
Well, I played a Dragon Ball Xenoverse too, cause I'm still playing it.

27:40.280 --> 27:42.880
I finished Everybody's Gone to the Rapture.

27:42.880 --> 27:45.000
I tried to play Mass Effect Andromeda.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.000
That didn't happen.

27:46.000 --> 27:50.120
Um, I played a lot of pinball, a lot of pinball.

27:50.120 --> 27:54.080
I've played Star Wars, I've played Star Trek The Next Generation.

27:54.080 --> 27:57.800
You guys have had new machines going in and out of that house of yours too.

27:57.800 --> 27:58.800
One new machine.

27:58.800 --> 27:59.800
That was ours.

27:59.800 --> 28:00.800
Oh, I thought it was other ones too.

28:00.800 --> 28:03.920
Um, maybe you were posting clips playing at somebody else's house or something.

28:04.360 --> 28:08.160
We've been borrowing Cactus Canyon and continued for a while.

28:08.160 --> 28:12.280
And then we picked up our own Star Trek, the new one.

28:12.280 --> 28:17.520
But at the little pinball thing, I played Ghostbusters, which was really fun.

28:17.520 --> 28:24.640
Bride of Pinball 2.0, Black Knight 2000, I played some older ones like Bite of the Snake

28:24.640 --> 28:30.440
or something, Medusa, you know, kind of classic.

28:30.480 --> 28:35.400
I also played, um, the new Aerosmith Table.

28:35.400 --> 28:36.400
That was pretty fun.

28:36.400 --> 28:40.680
I'm just trying to see if I can get like an overview of some of the other things I played,

28:40.680 --> 28:45.560
which of course, um, I played a Big Bang Bar, um, Space Fury.

28:45.560 --> 28:46.560
You remember Space Fury?

28:46.560 --> 28:47.720
I love that game.

28:47.720 --> 28:52.280
They had that ginormous, um, Space Invaders as well.

28:52.280 --> 28:55.360
Isn't that a ticket spitter game now?

28:55.360 --> 28:56.800
Those giant Space Invaders?

28:56.800 --> 28:58.160
They have one at round one.

28:58.160 --> 28:59.160
I've seen it around one.

28:59.200 --> 29:01.120
I think they have one over at that strikes in Rockland.

29:01.120 --> 29:02.120
They have the big...

29:02.120 --> 29:04.040
Yeah, play with like kind of like a Canon controller.

29:04.040 --> 29:05.040
Yeah, yeah.

29:05.040 --> 29:06.040
Isn't that a ticket?

29:06.040 --> 29:07.040
I think it's a ticket spitter now.

29:07.040 --> 29:08.280
It's neat, whatever it is.

29:08.280 --> 29:17.940
I played one of the P3 tables, um, which was, hold on, Lady Lights, no, Lexi Lightspeed.

29:17.940 --> 29:24.720
The P3 tables are supposed to be these modular tables that have video screens on the playfield.

29:24.720 --> 29:25.920
Oh.

29:25.920 --> 29:26.920
And it was pretty neat.

29:26.920 --> 29:27.920
It was a fun game.

29:27.920 --> 29:30.800
Is that like the hologram alien thing they had a while ago?

29:30.800 --> 29:31.800
No.

29:31.800 --> 29:32.800
No different?

29:32.800 --> 29:33.800
No, that's different.

29:33.800 --> 29:36.000
Um, this actually has like a full video screen.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.000
Huh.

29:37.000 --> 29:44.880
Um, so there was Journey, there was, oh yeah, they had, um, a Fantasy Zone 2 tape, uh, uh,

29:44.880 --> 29:45.880
machine.

29:45.880 --> 29:46.880
Wow.

29:46.880 --> 29:48.640
And it was so much fun because I love Fantasy Zone.

29:48.640 --> 29:51.040
It was the Tears of Oppa Oppa.

29:51.040 --> 29:56.160
Um, I played Elvira, Willow, the Capcom side-scrolling Willow.

29:56.160 --> 29:57.160
Oh, wow.

29:57.400 --> 30:02.080
Not that, the arcade version of Willow was very different than the NES version.

30:02.080 --> 30:06.060
It was kind of one of those, like, Strider too, where the arcade and the home versions

30:06.060 --> 30:07.060
were very different.

30:07.060 --> 30:08.620
It has more in common with Three Wonders.

30:08.620 --> 30:09.620
That same art style and everything.

30:09.620 --> 30:10.620
Yeah, it does.

30:10.620 --> 30:16.120
Um, I played America's Most Haunted, for pinball, uh, SkyShark, which-

30:16.120 --> 30:19.440
Isn't America's Most Haunted, is that the Ben Heck table?

30:19.440 --> 30:20.800
I think that's the Ben Heck table.

30:20.800 --> 30:21.800
Oh, interesting.

30:21.800 --> 30:22.800
Yeah.

30:22.800 --> 30:25.680
But it was supposed to be like based off of Scooby-Doo, but they couldn't get licensing

30:25.680 --> 30:26.680
or whatnot.

30:26.720 --> 30:27.720
It was weird.

30:27.720 --> 30:32.000
Um, SkyShark, I played, um, because I love SkyShark.

30:32.000 --> 30:35.360
It's like one of my favorite old, you know, war shooting, playing games.

30:35.360 --> 30:41.040
Uh, Kroll, Pac-Man and Chomp Chomp, which I don't know if that's anything official, but

30:41.040 --> 30:42.040
it was fun.

30:42.040 --> 30:43.040
Uh, Crazy Otto.

30:43.040 --> 30:44.960
You know what Crazy Otto is, right?

30:44.960 --> 30:46.560
Was that Crazy Climber with a-

30:46.560 --> 30:47.560
No.

30:47.560 --> 30:48.560
Hack?

30:48.560 --> 30:51.560
Crazy Otto was what turned into Ms. Pac-Man.

30:51.560 --> 30:52.560
Right.

30:52.560 --> 30:54.700
Right, right, right, right.

30:54.700 --> 31:00.480
And someone had like one of the smaller machines, um, set up with like a big ROM hack for Crazy

31:00.480 --> 31:01.480
Otto.

31:01.480 --> 31:02.480
Um-

31:02.480 --> 31:03.480
How was the turnout at the event?

31:03.480 --> 31:04.480
It was busy.

31:04.480 --> 31:05.480
It was busy.

31:05.480 --> 31:06.480
I bet.

31:06.480 --> 31:07.480
They moved a lot of games into another room.

31:07.480 --> 31:12.660
Um, there's Gemini Wing, um, Ula Poco, which is another, uh, puzzle game, uh, Dan, they

31:12.660 --> 31:17.660
had, uh, Vectrex upstairs and console games, so Dan was playing the Vectrex.

31:17.660 --> 31:18.660
Oh, nice.

31:18.660 --> 31:19.660
Nice.

31:19.660 --> 31:20.660
Um-

31:20.660 --> 31:21.660
So you played a lot.

31:21.660 --> 31:22.660
Yeah, Hyperball.

31:22.660 --> 31:23.660
They had a Hyperball that was actually working.

31:23.660 --> 31:24.660
Nice.

31:24.660 --> 31:25.660
Hyperball.

31:25.660 --> 31:30.900
Um, I'm just trying- Oh, yeah, they had, uh, the loop in the third typing game, which they

31:30.900 --> 31:31.900
have every year.

31:31.900 --> 31:32.900
Um, Level 255-

31:32.900 --> 31:34.700
But not Typing of the Dead.

31:34.700 --> 31:35.700
No.

31:35.700 --> 31:36.700
That's unfortunate.

31:36.700 --> 31:37.980
Level 255, you know what that is?

31:37.980 --> 31:40.180
That is the Pac-Man thingy, right?

31:40.180 --> 31:41.180
Yes.

31:41.180 --> 31:44.940
Yes, because of the- it's like, does it jump you right to the last level, or is it-

31:44.940 --> 31:46.580
Like, right before that, I think.

31:46.580 --> 31:47.580
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

31:47.580 --> 31:49.220
Um, it's meant to simulate it.

31:49.220 --> 31:52.700
Um, there was just all kinds of fun stuff there.

31:52.700 --> 31:53.700
Really fun stuff.

31:53.740 --> 31:58.180
Dan and I are more thinking that it might be time to start selling some of the collection.

31:58.180 --> 32:01.580
Because there's- people are paying bucks for it.

32:01.580 --> 32:02.580
Yeah.

32:02.580 --> 32:03.580
And we've got lots of stuff in the box.

32:03.580 --> 32:09.980
So if anyone wants to give me $500, you too can own a Ninja Gaiden trilogy in the box.

32:09.980 --> 32:10.980
Just saying.

32:10.980 --> 32:11.980
Good to know.

32:11.980 --> 32:12.980
Good to know.

32:12.980 --> 32:13.980
All right.

32:13.980 --> 32:14.980
So, Dark Taco's been very busy.

32:14.980 --> 32:16.780
Loki, how was your, uh, gaming time?

32:16.780 --> 32:18.980
I was not busy, unfortunately.

32:18.980 --> 32:23.660
I did not play anything, because once again, I was trying to focus on actually making a

32:23.660 --> 32:25.660
game, and that just wasn't happening.

32:25.660 --> 32:26.660
Well, and you got bronchitis.

32:26.660 --> 32:27.660
And I got bronchitis.

32:27.660 --> 32:30.060
But no, I did want to- I did want to play stuff.

32:30.060 --> 32:37.540
I ended up- ironically, I ended up playing Legos more than I did anything, so.

32:37.540 --> 32:39.540
Like the Lego Dimensions game, or you mean like actual-

32:39.540 --> 32:40.540
No, like, Legos Legos.

32:40.540 --> 32:44.340
Like, I got out my Legos from, like, when I was a kid and made my kids play with them,

32:44.340 --> 32:45.340
and now they love Legos.

32:45.340 --> 32:48.800
And we have a Lego store in our town, actually.

32:48.800 --> 32:53.120
There's a store called Five Star Bricks, and they sell Legos, so I bought my Lego Loki

32:53.120 --> 32:56.900
finally because I've been trying to get a Loki minifig for, like, forever.

32:56.900 --> 33:00.360
And so I got that, and they have, like, this cool booth that, like, it's like a bin with

33:00.360 --> 33:04.740
a bunch of minifig parts, and so you can build your own minifig for, like, three bucks.

33:04.740 --> 33:08.200
And so my kids had fun doing that, because they made their own custom minifig and everything.

33:08.200 --> 33:09.880
They have birthday parties there!

33:09.880 --> 33:11.840
I'm like, dude, I should have my birthday here!

33:11.840 --> 33:14.280
This is fucking awesome!

33:14.280 --> 33:16.880
Good job getting your kids on Lego at a young age, though.

33:16.880 --> 33:17.880
Yeah, hell yeah.

33:17.880 --> 33:20.960
I mean, I had all this stuff, I'm like, come on, you guys, don't you want to play this?

33:20.960 --> 33:24.280
And, like, my son just doesn't want to build, he wants me to build everything for him.

33:24.280 --> 33:29.640
And he got a bunch of Legos for his birthday, too, and so I made him put one of the sets

33:29.640 --> 33:30.640
together.

33:30.640 --> 33:34.000
I'm like, you're gonna put this together, I'll help you, but you need to do this yourself.

33:34.000 --> 33:35.600
I can't do everything for you.

33:35.600 --> 33:38.200
And he did it, and he felt very rewarded by that.

33:38.200 --> 33:40.360
He's like, I put this together, you know?

33:40.360 --> 33:41.360
Good.

33:41.360 --> 33:42.360
So that was kind of fun.

33:42.360 --> 33:46.920
As far as actual games I played, I played the stupid cell phone clicker game for Office

33:46.920 --> 33:48.080
Space.

33:48.080 --> 33:53.000
I am having a serious addiction problem with that game, like I can't stop playing it, even

33:53.000 --> 33:56.720
though I don't want to sometimes.

33:56.720 --> 33:59.080
But I mean, it's entertaining, I guess.

33:59.080 --> 34:04.520
Every single time they do these little events, they keep changing the rules for them, so

34:04.520 --> 34:06.180
it mixes it up a bit, I guess.

34:06.180 --> 34:08.880
But I don't know, sometimes it's just irritating.

34:08.880 --> 34:12.080
Thankfully, this last one they did, I was able to complete the event in like two hours

34:12.080 --> 34:16.320
instead of five days, so that was kind of nice.

34:16.320 --> 34:17.320
I don't know.

34:17.320 --> 34:20.840
Aside from that, I really didn't play anything.

34:20.840 --> 34:26.680
So I've been trying to play, I've been meaning to play VR, and actually do the super hot

34:26.680 --> 34:30.200
VR, because I have that for PlayStation VR.

34:30.200 --> 34:31.200
Haven't got a chance to do that.

34:31.200 --> 34:34.540
I've been on the fence about buying an Oculus Rift.

34:34.540 --> 34:37.720
I really don't have the money for it, but I'm still thinking about doing it anyways.

34:37.720 --> 34:41.320
I'm like, am I gonna use it?

34:41.320 --> 34:42.320
Responsibility!

34:42.320 --> 34:46.600
I may just wait and eat the extra hundred dollars or whatever, wait for Black Friday

34:46.600 --> 34:51.080
or something like that, I don't know, but it's very tempting.

34:51.080 --> 34:55.080
That's where I'm at with the 4K, because you know I have a 4K monitor now, that was a purchase

34:55.080 --> 35:00.120
I made I think right before the last show, and now it's like, oh I need to get a better

35:00.120 --> 35:02.320
video card so I can play Destiny 2.

35:02.320 --> 35:05.560
Well yes, you should get a better video card, that's actually something that's worthwhile,

35:05.560 --> 35:09.320
whereas an Oculus, that's something you'll use every time you use your computer.

35:09.340 --> 35:14.560
But I'm in that predicament where it's like, do I buy one now, or do I wait for those inevitable,

35:14.560 --> 35:17.840
whatever that new one is that's coming out, like Titan or whatever, there's a new one

35:17.840 --> 35:22.560
coming out in like a month, and so I gotta wait for that so that the prices of the other

35:22.560 --> 35:23.560
ones kinda come down.

35:23.560 --> 35:26.560
Because right now, a 1080 is like 800 bucks.

35:26.560 --> 35:29.360
You don't need a 1080, a 1070 would be fine enough.

35:29.360 --> 35:31.080
That's still like 400, I think a 1070.

35:31.080 --> 35:32.520
I have a 1060 in this laptop.

35:32.520 --> 35:33.520
Do you really?

35:33.520 --> 35:34.520
Yeah, so.

35:34.520 --> 35:35.520
Nice.

35:35.520 --> 35:36.520
Yeah, it's fucking nice.

35:36.720 --> 35:43.520
I have a 970 now, so I can get away with like 2K graphics on my monitor, so like Overwatch,

35:43.520 --> 35:46.480
Final Fantasy XIV, all those games look a little better.

35:46.480 --> 35:51.480
The only game I can play in full 4K and it runs fine is Diablo 3, but it's because I

35:51.480 --> 35:55.440
think that game is kinda, you know, it's a few years old at this point, and I think there's

35:55.440 --> 35:59.440
less going on, but that's the only game I can play in the full 4K.

35:59.440 --> 36:03.520
Yeah the AMD, they have new AMD cards coming out, they're supposed to be pretty good.

36:03.520 --> 36:07.400
AMD's been putting out a lot of stuff that's been a little bit cheaper, especially with

36:07.400 --> 36:10.840
the Ryzen cards and everything, or Ryzen chips.

36:10.840 --> 36:16.240
So hopefully there's gonna be more competition with that, but yeah, the 1070 is a pretty

36:16.240 --> 36:17.240
nice card.

36:17.240 --> 36:22.480
Honestly, you know, I was like, well the laptop in the 1060 is probably good because there's

36:22.480 --> 36:27.580
only a 1080p monitor, so I was like, probably don't need much more than that, it plays everything

36:27.580 --> 36:28.580
fine.

36:28.580 --> 36:29.580
Yeah.

36:29.580 --> 36:30.580
Okay.

36:30.580 --> 36:31.580
Alright.

36:31.580 --> 36:32.580
Well, we'll see, we'll see.

36:33.140 --> 36:34.540
My gaming time.

36:34.540 --> 36:39.660
So let's see, gosh, I've been playing a lot.

36:39.660 --> 36:44.620
One game that I found myself playing until the wee hours of the morning over the past

36:44.620 --> 36:48.140
couple weeks was Diablo 3, funny enough.

36:48.140 --> 36:51.060
I think there's something about, and you were kinda mentioning this when you were talking

36:51.060 --> 36:55.180
about you're sick and you don't really wanna have to think a lot, I think with Diablo 3,

36:55.180 --> 36:58.700
you just really have to click click click click click and get loot.

36:58.700 --> 36:59.700
Click click click.

36:59.700 --> 37:00.700
Yeah exactly.

37:00.700 --> 37:01.700
As little as all it is, right?

37:02.020 --> 37:06.700
Like yesterday actually, I was sitting there and I'm like, I see my Overwatch icon, I'm

37:06.700 --> 37:10.660
like, I haven't played Overwatch in like a month, I'm like, I should go play Overwatch

37:10.660 --> 37:14.380
and I'm like, eh, but the controller's all the way over there, it's like, I just don't

37:14.380 --> 37:15.900
wanna do this.

37:15.900 --> 37:20.980
I probably, so okay, so you know how Diablo has the seasons and you can do a fresh start,

37:20.980 --> 37:24.700
so on PC, some of my friends are playing on Playstation 4 and they want me to play over

37:24.700 --> 37:28.220
there so I started a character, I got it to about level 30 but I just haven't been able

37:28.220 --> 37:34.020
to connect with them online, but PC's very convenient for me to play so I started a character

37:34.020 --> 37:41.180
on PC probably that Monday of the week after Mom passed and I was off work, I started a

37:41.180 --> 37:47.420
character and I am now at Paragon 270 for the season, so just to give you an idea how

37:47.420 --> 37:53.420
much I've been playing Diablo 3, it's been quite a little bit, so that's, that was, yeah,

37:53.420 --> 37:55.460
that was a big game time sink.

37:55.500 --> 37:59.140
I've been playing some of the usual stuff too, Final Fantasy XIV, I did play some new

37:59.140 --> 38:05.620
stuff as well, I should point out, Shane came over yesterday and he has on his Playstation

38:05.620 --> 38:13.100
4, he downloaded from the Hong Kong Playstation store, DJ Max Respect, cause that's not here

38:13.100 --> 38:19.460
in the US yet, and I don't know if it's actually getting released or whatever, it's hard to

38:19.460 --> 38:24.820
tell, like I don't know, I don't understand why these games can't just come out at the

38:24.860 --> 38:28.380
same time, since yes, it's region free, but he had to do this whole thing where he had

38:28.380 --> 38:34.780
to buy a card that was Hong Kong dollars on Playstation, he had to create a new account,

38:34.780 --> 38:39.300
he got it and all this stuff, but it's just like, it just seems so tedious when it's like

38:39.300 --> 38:43.020
why can't they just, it's gotta have something to do with music licensing I'm sure for a

38:43.020 --> 38:47.180
game like that, but gosh, just figure it out, or I don't know, but anyway, so I did get

38:47.180 --> 38:51.460
to play the game, long story short, I did get to play DJ Max Respect and I thought it

38:51.540 --> 38:57.740
was cool because it's basically Beatmania 2DX, but on your controller, and obviously

38:57.740 --> 39:01.540
there's no turntable, and it's interesting because they have a four button mode, a five

39:01.540 --> 39:06.140
button mode, and a six button mode, so it's like in four buttons it's left on D-pad, up

39:06.140 --> 39:11.980
on D-pad, triangle and circle, and then in five button mode you can use right or square

39:11.980 --> 39:18.100
for the fifth button, and then in six button it's right and square separate, so it's the

39:18.140 --> 39:23.260
falling notes and you hit them in time with the music, and you know, it's a well done music game,

39:23.260 --> 39:27.140
I enjoyed what I played with it, I was kind of like, I want this, but I just don't want to have

39:27.140 --> 39:32.780
to jump through all these stupid hoops, so I guess I could get a physical edition, I think only one

39:32.780 --> 39:37.260
store online that I know of has a physical edition, and it's a place I really don't want

39:37.260 --> 39:42.020
to shop unless I like have to, so I'm kind of waiting to see, I guess the game is coming out

39:42.020 --> 39:47.980
in Japan in a couple months, so I'm waiting to see if the Japanese version might be English

39:47.980 --> 39:52.900
language still, or how that'll work, so we'll see, I just hope there's gonna be a US release

39:52.900 --> 39:57.260
of the game eventually, because there's obviously enough DJ Maxx fans here, and music game fans to

39:57.260 --> 40:03.020
substantiate it, so it would be nice for that to happen, so that was something new that I played,

40:03.020 --> 40:09.100
otherwise still some old favorites, I should mention Pokemon Go, because that whole raid

40:09.100 --> 40:15.740
stuff, that was very very motivating in actually leaving the house, I left the house probably for

40:15.740 --> 40:21.460
the first time after a few days, to go catch a Moltres, so I did, it didn't end up appraising

40:21.460 --> 40:26.100
as a wonder, so that was disappointing, but at least I finally freaking caught one, so that was,

40:26.100 --> 40:33.580
that was nice, so I did get one of each, because we did, we went around yesterday, and got Zapados,

40:33.580 --> 40:38.660
that way we have them all, yeah, I had to buy some raid passes to do it, because we didn't get it on

40:38.660 --> 40:43.260
the first try, but I was able, I was able to get it eventually, and I gotta say, it's, it's been

40:43.300 --> 40:47.060
very interesting through this whole thing with Pokemon Go, and all these changes through the

40:47.060 --> 40:51.860
past few weeks, like there's this discord for Pokemon Go, that you can join for local like

40:51.860 --> 40:57.260
Sacramento to find other raiders and stuff, and it just blew up, like it blew up in just a matter

40:57.260 --> 41:02.620
of days, like there's thousands of people on it, it's pretty crazy, and so that's a good way to

41:02.620 --> 41:08.220
like find people in the suburbs, where I live, to find raiding, but you know what we found was

41:08.220 --> 41:13.380
easier, because we ran into some really like, just what happens when you get a big group of

41:13.380 --> 41:17.980
nerds together, there are some people that don't wait for others to show up, before they just go

41:17.980 --> 41:22.700
and raid, you know, and it's like too bad, so sad for you, and other stuff, so honestly like Alan

41:22.700 --> 41:29.620
and I just had better luck, we went downtown, and just went to where we saw Zapados, and like we

41:29.620 --> 41:35.700
would have a full group in 10 minutes, like we walked up to where Zapados had just spawned,

41:36.340 --> 41:40.860
as we walked up we saw people tapping their phones, so we're like oh great, they're already in,

41:40.860 --> 41:44.500
we missed it, oh well, but Alan was like no, we'll just hang out for a minute, so I was like all

41:44.500 --> 41:50.980
right, so we hung out, and within 15 minutes we had 20 people, a full group, ready to do it again,

41:50.980 --> 41:55.060
which we were the first ones to show up for that, so it's like downtown was the place to be at,

41:55.060 --> 41:59.460
because that's just where non-stop groups are forming, so I'm gonna remember that for the

41:59.460 --> 42:03.380
future, for any other raids they might end up releasing, although I would imagine this whole

42:03.420 --> 42:08.180
thing's taking a break after Monday, with all the kids being back in school, and all that,

42:08.180 --> 42:12.540
Lucia might still be around, I think they might keep one of the five-star raids, just so people

42:12.540 --> 42:20.620
can get those rewards, but I think for the most part, you know, I feel like this can't be the

42:20.620 --> 42:25.660
only chance, they'll come back, I just, I don't care anymore, honestly, like I'm kind of, I'm

42:25.660 --> 42:30.900
over it, and it's taken me a while, like I was kind of still playing it casually, and then I

42:30.940 --> 42:34.860
might still do that now, because now that my kid's gonna be back in school later this week,

42:34.860 --> 42:40.420
it's good to kill time, because I can, you know, spin the pokestop, he, because apparently his

42:40.420 --> 42:45.740
school is also a park, and so it went, it bypassed that rule that it's not supposed to be in the

42:45.740 --> 42:51.060
school, but there's a, there's a pokestop right at the school, and so I spin the pokestop while I

42:51.060 --> 42:57.380
wait there in the morning for his, you know, class to start, but, you know, that's really the only

42:57.460 --> 43:01.420
reason I was doing that, but now, like, actually, I have so many Pokeballs, I have to throw them

43:01.420 --> 43:08.340
away in order to be able to spin it again, so. Oh no. Yeah, I have like 170 Pokeballs, so. Get a

43:08.340 --> 43:12.220
clicker, like I have the Poke, uh, Pokemon Go Plus. They had those, I saw them the other day,

43:12.220 --> 43:16.100
they had them at, like, Target. They're not hard to find anymore. And then I'm like, should I get

43:16.100 --> 43:21.340
one just to cheat? It's not cheating, it's not cheating, it's an official product, it's not

43:21.340 --> 43:26.500
cheating. No, I'm gonna open it up, and I'm gonna solder the, oh, that's LED to the actual click,

43:26.500 --> 43:30.620
so every time that it notifies me that there's something there, it automatically clicks it.

43:30.620 --> 43:37.060
I believe that exists already. It's called a Gotcha, or something. Uh, Charles, who was on our

43:37.060 --> 43:41.220
last show when he was talking about it, but he has one of those things. He says, it's like a

43:41.220 --> 43:44.820
bracelet, and I don't think you have to do anything with it. It's like a Gotcha, or so, I forget what

43:44.820 --> 43:48.460
the name of it is, but I, I remember looking it up. I can figure it out for you. But, like, that,

43:48.460 --> 43:51.780
that product already exists, actually. Well, I talked about that before that product even came

43:51.820 --> 43:56.900
out. So, yeah, I was like, oh, this is how it's gonna work. All right. Uh, in chat, SSG100Matt

43:56.900 --> 44:01.820
says, there are rumors that they will introduce Mew during the Japanese Pokemon Go event this

44:01.820 --> 44:05.220
week. I worry some of that might just be wishful thinking, because people- Well, they have, was it

44:05.220 --> 44:14.820
the, the, the low, the low-effort shiny Pikachu? Oh, yeah. We made the black into gray! Woo! I, I

44:14.820 --> 44:19.740
do wish other shinies they would kind of roll out, or, I'm okay if they take a break from the

44:19.740 --> 44:25.500
legendaries and decide to do, you know, to save Mew and Mewtwo for winter, or holiday break, or

44:25.500 --> 44:30.220
something, and they kind of- How long did that take their artists? Find, replace. Oh, stop. Well,

44:30.220 --> 44:33.820
that's how it was in the original games, so it's not like it's that different. I did see it, there

44:33.820 --> 44:38.100
was an article I saw that there was a group of people that actually took down one of the Magikarp

44:38.100 --> 44:43.940
ones with Magikarp, the one the Magikarp raves. Oh, nice. So, that's pretty funny. Same type, same

44:43.980 --> 44:50.460
type attack bonus. Oh, I like seeing that. Nice. Alright, anyway, so that's enough about my gaming

44:50.460 --> 44:54.460
time, so that was some of the stuff I played in the break, so, and then No Man's Sky, as I

44:54.460 --> 44:59.860
mentioned a minute ago. Let's talk about housekeeping a little bit, because I do have some kind of big

44:59.860 --> 45:06.420
updates that are important, I have to communicate during the housekeeping here. So, I am going to be

45:06.420 --> 45:12.500
at Dragon Con in a few weeks. That is still on, so unfortunately we will be off over Labor Day

45:12.500 --> 45:17.140
weekend, which is just, I think, I think it's like three weeks from today, that's three weeks from

45:17.140 --> 45:21.980
today. So, we have two more episodes, then we'll be gone for Dragon Con, that one's always been a

45:21.980 --> 45:27.820
planned break. I will be at Dragon Con, really excited to be a part of Dragon Con, and I'm gonna

45:27.820 --> 45:32.380
be on three panels this year, tentatively, anything can change the last minute. I'll get you more

45:32.380 --> 45:37.580
information about all that in an upcoming VOG article, but yeah, if you're gonna be near the

45:37.580 --> 45:42.660
podcasting track, definitely come to some of those panels, and say hi. I'd love to meet folks from

45:42.660 --> 45:49.100
OLR that are gonna be in the Atlanta area. So, Dragon Con is still happening. Unfortunately,

45:49.100 --> 45:56.540
because of what happened with Mom passing, and me having to take a lot of time away to do that,

45:56.540 --> 46:02.700
I am having to cancel other trips, because just, unfortunately, it's one of those things where I

46:02.780 --> 46:08.860
ran out the bank of time off, and money, and all that stuff, and so I just do not have the

46:08.860 --> 46:14.460
resources to make some things happen, and one of those things is MAGFest 2018. I'm not gonna be

46:14.460 --> 46:20.140
going, so that's a bummer, but I hope you guys that do go have a great time. So, I won't be going to

46:20.140 --> 46:25.900
MAGFest this year. I did hear about all the ticket sales, and some of the issues that caused. I made

46:25.900 --> 46:30.420
this decision independent of all that, so it's not related to that, but I hope they're able to work

46:30.420 --> 46:37.020
that out. And the other thing, I was planning to go to New York in October for a wedding. I'm

46:37.020 --> 46:42.020
having to call that off as well, which is a real bummer, because I wanted to go see people in New

46:42.020 --> 46:46.940
York. I haven't been to New York in like 10 years, but I'm sure everybody understands I have to make

46:46.940 --> 46:51.420
the tough call. So, hopefully, I can reschedule for next year. I can go visit my friend that's

46:51.420 --> 46:55.660
getting married, and her, at that point, will be newlywed husband, and then make a trip out of it

46:55.660 --> 47:01.620
at that point. But for now, pretty much everything that isn't Dragon Con is canceled for the rest of

47:01.620 --> 47:06.900
the year, but I'm hoping to do some other Expos next year. So, we'll look forward to that. So,

47:06.900 --> 47:12.420
all right, I think that's all I have for housekeeping. So, let's get into some more

47:12.420 --> 47:18.460
gaming news of which there's been a little bit. So, let's go to Loki. Yes, so we've, this is kind

47:18.460 --> 47:22.540
of cool, because I remember when I actually tried to compete in this way back in the day,

47:23.060 --> 47:29.380
back in the 90s. So, the Nintendo World Championships, they're having qualifiers

47:29.380 --> 47:36.420
for the 2017 championships. The qualifier will be Mario Kart 7, and you're gonna have to play it in

47:36.420 --> 47:43.380
time trails. They have two different age brackets. So, hold up, aren't we up to Mario Kart 8? But,

47:43.380 --> 47:49.580
we can't forget about the 3DS, the true portable system that they have, the brand new portable

47:49.580 --> 47:55.340
system from Nintendo. I see. Okay, continue. I mean, I don't know why they didn't just do this.

47:55.980 --> 47:59.500
That was the first thing I noticed when I went to that page. I was like, Mario Kart 7? Is that a

47:59.500 --> 48:06.460
typo? Aren't they supposed to be selling the new one, Mario Kart 8? You'd think, but I don't know.

48:06.460 --> 48:13.580
Is that because there haven't been quality 3DS games in a long time? Oh, yeah, I went there. I

48:13.820 --> 48:20.060
sure did. I'm also just being a little shady. It gets you hyped about Mario Kart 7 Deluxe on the

48:20.060 --> 48:27.340
Switch. Don't even. Don't even. Alright, fair enough. Look, look, I'll stop being shady for it.

48:27.340 --> 48:31.900
I get a lot of kids probably still play the portable one. Alright, whatever, cool. Yeah,

48:31.900 --> 48:37.020
so they're gonna do it in two age brackets. There's gonna be 12 and younger and 13 and older,

48:37.020 --> 48:45.020
and of course these are gonna be located at Best Buy in select cities. So August 19th and 20th,

48:45.020 --> 48:53.500
you can do that at New York and San Jose, 26th and 27th, Chicago and LA, September 2nd and 3rd,

48:53.500 --> 49:01.020
Minneapolis and Dallas, and finally September 9th and 10th, Seattle and Miami. And then from there,

49:01.020 --> 49:06.300
if you do happen to make it in there, then you actually, I guess, get to go to the actual

49:06.300 --> 49:10.220
championships, wherever the hell that's supposed to be. And they do have a specific race that

49:10.220 --> 49:15.660
you're doing. I want to say Luigi's Mansion, and I guess the younger players will get to play

49:16.300 --> 49:21.740
as Mario, and then the older players of the race is Bowser, or race Bowser's Castle as Bowser.

49:24.700 --> 49:28.220
So it's already set, so you know it's not going to be a surprise. You know exactly what you have to

49:28.220 --> 49:32.860
do. Yeah. Then it's not a special cartridge like the old school championship. They should make them

49:32.860 --> 49:37.660
play old ass games. Make them play the fucking old ass world championship game. Well they might,

49:37.660 --> 49:42.300
in the finals. Fuck the finals. That should be the actual qualifier. That's what it was.

49:42.300 --> 49:48.460
That was the qualifier. What about, what about, here's a perfect, here's a perfect medium. What

49:48.460 --> 49:55.180
about NES Remix? How about a new game? Well that, well that may show up. Didn't, wasn't the whole

49:55.180 --> 49:58.860
point when they brought it back a couple years ago, wasn't the whole point to introduce Mario

49:58.860 --> 50:04.540
Maker. And that ended up being like the last level, right? Was they played Mario Maker,

50:04.540 --> 50:08.700
because there was those memes where the guy went through the door, and like there was all these

50:08.700 --> 50:14.460
like, he was like nope, and he noped out. Remember that? No, that was, yeah, because what Kevin

50:14.460 --> 50:19.100
Pereira was hosting, and he did a competent job and all that. He was good. And yeah, so I remember

50:19.100 --> 50:23.340
that. There was Mario Maker was a big thing. So this kind of has a lot of people asking,

50:24.140 --> 50:29.340
what are they pushing with this? Zelda Maker, please Zelda Maker, or Metroid Maker, or,

50:30.300 --> 50:36.140
or Super Smash Brothers. This seems to be the wrong forum to... Smash Maker? I don't know.

50:37.260 --> 50:40.460
What, that's the big question with your mind, like don't, don't get me wrong. I'm,

50:40.460 --> 50:44.060
I think it's cool that, this tournament should have always been here. With their track record,

50:44.060 --> 50:50.060
it's gonna be fucking Pikmin Maker or some shit like that, ain't it? Stop. Terrible Pikmin. Let's

50:50.060 --> 50:56.540
release multiple games for that, but Metroid and F-Zero, fuck those guys. Well, we do know,

50:56.540 --> 51:00.860
okay, so they're advertising, if you go to Best Buy to do the tournament and all this stuff,

51:00.860 --> 51:09.580
you get to play, they will have Mario Odyssey there, as well as the new Metroid 2 game on 3DS,

51:09.580 --> 51:14.940
the new, you know, the, the one that they're Metroid, not Metroid 0, but Metroid 2 in 0

51:14.940 --> 51:19.260
style, right? On the 3DS, that whole thing. So both those games are going to be there.

51:19.260 --> 51:22.940
By the time it gets to the last city there, it's practically out anyways. I mean,

51:22.940 --> 51:27.260
I guess it's, that's cool that they're doing, I, whatever, that's fine that they're doing that.

51:27.260 --> 51:31.900
Is Mario Odyssey the big title? Is that, is this whole thing to push Mario Odyssey?

51:31.900 --> 51:35.740
Is that going to be the last game played? I don't think, but like, if you think about the people

51:35.740 --> 51:39.580
that are going to be competing in these championships or whatever, they're going to

51:39.580 --> 51:45.420
buy these games anyways. It's not really drawing in like, you know, it's not like, you know,

51:45.420 --> 51:49.820
back in the day when they showed the world championships and that was part of the wizard,

51:49.820 --> 51:53.500
you know, and then people are like, oh shit, you know, fucking competition. And it's like,

51:53.500 --> 51:58.460
oh no, it's real too. You can actually go try it. And they were like all the, um, it wasn't

51:58.460 --> 52:02.620
Blockbuster now. They had, well, Blockbuster was a different one. They had that actually with, uh,

52:02.620 --> 52:06.300
it was like fighting games and stuff. Was that the world championships and Nintendo one or is that

52:06.300 --> 52:10.300
something separate? I don't remember. I feel like Blockbuster did their own thing at one point.

52:10.300 --> 52:15.020
Yeah, because they had their own thing with like, it was clay fighters and fucking NBA Jam.

52:15.020 --> 52:21.340
And the one year was, uh, the Ninja Turtles fighting game. They remember they had that.

52:21.340 --> 52:27.340
And I remember trying that cause I hated NBA Jam, but, um, I like strong with you. I love NBA Jam.

52:27.340 --> 52:31.660
I just wasn't good at sports games are not my thing. Sports games usually aren't my thing

52:31.660 --> 52:36.940
either, but the NES and the SNES era had like some of the best fucking sports games between

52:36.940 --> 52:42.860
like blades of steel, even the original ice hockey, uh, NBA Jam, like all those games were

52:42.860 --> 52:47.420
awesome. What's wrong with you? They should make them play really old games that are like,

52:47.420 --> 52:50.860
I don't know, kids. Well, they are, they have to play Mario Kart seven Logie.

52:52.300 --> 52:57.180
That's that's retro. Now she's pretty old. I think I was selling Mario Kart seven.

52:57.180 --> 53:01.020
Vid power in chat says it's surprising that qualifiers are playing Mario Kart seven,

53:01.020 --> 53:05.020
a game from 2011. That's when that game came out. That's that old. Yeah.

53:05.660 --> 53:11.660
Yeah. Jesus sure is. So, and you know, but, but you know, all this tongue in cheek stuff about

53:11.660 --> 53:17.100
the world championships aside, I mean the games they're pushing Mario Odyssey and, and, you know,

53:17.100 --> 53:21.420
Metroid return to Samus, I'm going to have both those games day one, day one, you better believe

53:21.420 --> 53:26.060
it. I'm here for both of that. It's going to be awesome. So obviously it looks good. I mean, I,

53:26.060 --> 53:31.020
in doing it wrong, I just wouldn't buy a system for, um, the Metro game. I mean, the Metro game

53:31.020 --> 53:36.380
looks fantastic. I just, I just can't purchase a system for those games. And don't get me wrong.

53:36.380 --> 53:39.340
I think, I think it's neat that the Nintendo world championships, like they're doing it again,

53:39.340 --> 53:43.420
but it's just, it's just weird timing. I'm not sure what is it they're pushing unless there's

53:43.420 --> 53:47.980
a surprise, but I'm not going to set pushing e-sports, e-sports man, e-sports, Nintendo can

53:47.980 --> 53:53.420
be sports. I'm not, I'm not going to set my expectation bar very high for an unveiling or

53:53.420 --> 54:00.700
anything like that. Um, but why, why did they put it on ice for like what, 25 years, 1990 to 2015,

54:00.700 --> 54:06.140
right? They put on ice for 25 years and then they decided to bring it back, skip a year,

54:06.140 --> 54:10.540
two years later. This is, it's just weird. Like I just don't, okay. I mean, but I guess

54:10.540 --> 54:16.780
I shouldn't complain. Mario Kart 7 just wasn't ready for 2015. Ooh. But if I did want to set the

54:16.780 --> 54:22.700
bar in fan wank territory, you ready for this? Ready for this? Maybe. Cause you talk about old

54:22.700 --> 54:27.180
games. You keep saying that you need to play old games and this thing. What if this whole thing is

54:27.180 --> 54:32.460
how they finally unveil, not just like the virtual console thing, but Nintendo's whole

54:33.100 --> 54:39.340
Nintendo online program with the eight bit rewards. What if the twist is they play?

54:39.980 --> 54:44.620
Why are you laughing so fucking hard? I'm laughing because like, I can just see it now. Yeah,

54:44.620 --> 54:49.500
we're going to play this game. We had to download it first off of the Nintendo network. Oh, fuck.

54:50.380 --> 54:56.380
Nintendo network. Those are the, those all go together. This will never work.

54:57.580 --> 55:04.060
The game, the game gets lag and lags console. It's like a digital download. It's not playing.

55:04.060 --> 55:09.020
And the final game is excite bike, but you'll be playing it across the internet. Here we go.

55:09.740 --> 55:15.020
Connecting, connecting the final game is excite bike. You actually have to play it though from

55:15.020 --> 55:19.260
a system that is from the era with the original excite bike. They've been stored in a garage

55:19.260 --> 55:24.300
and they're fucking dusty as hell. You got blow this shit out of that in order to get that thing

55:24.300 --> 55:30.060
to work before you can actually play excite. Well, I will practice my blowing skills in the

55:30.060 --> 55:36.300
meantime, then Loki is that president. He pulled out an air canister. Is this against rules? I'm

55:36.300 --> 55:43.340
going to allow it. Is it better to blow than suck? Why does he have chapstick? All right. Uh,

55:43.340 --> 55:49.340
let's move on to another story. Girl. Let's talk about a different company.

55:50.300 --> 55:54.220
I want to talk about, uh, Microsoft and some of the things they're doing because, uh,

55:54.220 --> 55:59.980
Hey, we, we have a soft spot in our hearts for the Xbox live indie games, right? Which was the

55:59.980 --> 56:06.620
XNA games on three 16. The reason why we love it so much was because of bungee ferret tossing,

56:06.620 --> 56:11.500
which was a game among other things, which was a game of Y Y R made that, you know, features

56:11.500 --> 56:15.980
our little logo in it and you know, all that stuff. So 360, can't forget plugged for all

56:15.980 --> 56:20.460
the Y Y R games falling was there too. So plug, plug. Uh, but then there was also like,

56:20.460 --> 56:25.020
there was just some real dumpster fire games available. Also some games that were pretty

56:25.020 --> 56:29.420
shitty, but they're still entertaining the play. Like there was like all the Minecraft clones

56:30.380 --> 56:35.260
games that are so bad. They're good. Yeah. They had some decent stuff on there. Like I bought

56:35.260 --> 56:39.740
some games on there. Well, we knew that the program is going away. In fact, I believe it's,

56:39.740 --> 56:45.580
I think it's next month. It's done. Like you can't buy games anymore as of like next month.

56:45.980 --> 56:49.420
As long as I can still play them. That's well, once they're downloaded to your console,

56:49.420 --> 56:53.740
I'm pretty sure, you know, they're there forever. Uh, even as I have a download,

56:53.740 --> 56:57.660
even game room, you can still do that. But, um, yeah, I'm pretty sure you can still do that.

56:57.660 --> 57:01.820
It's just, you can't buy any new ones. So a lot of people have been asking is,

57:01.820 --> 57:06.540
is Microsoft ever going to replace this? What's the deal? Well, it turns out, yes. Uh, there is

57:06.540 --> 57:12.460
going to be a different version of this. That's coming to Xbox one and windows 10. It's called the

57:12.460 --> 57:18.620
creators collection. Um, so I believe it's going to use unity now instead of XNA. So that's,

57:18.620 --> 57:22.540
you know, a big change, but a lot of games are made in unity now. So, you know, that shouldn't

57:22.540 --> 57:28.540
be a huge surprise that they're kind of getting away from the XNA. Um, so, uh, ID at Xbox,

57:28.540 --> 57:33.660
the director of that has explained this as the creators program was established to enable

57:33.660 --> 57:39.500
developers to directly publish their games, any of their games to Xbox one and windows 10 PCs

57:39.500 --> 57:45.020
with a simplified certification process and no concept approval required developers that

57:45.020 --> 57:49.340
published through the creators program have the freedom and independence to develop games that

57:49.340 --> 57:54.540
are truly unique, resulting in a collection with games that can be quirky and have varying degrees

57:54.540 --> 58:00.620
of Polish, but are always interesting. Um, that is such the politically correct way of saying,

58:00.620 --> 58:07.100
get ready for some crap. That's the way they're saying like, yeah, we really want to promote your

58:07.100 --> 58:11.900
independence and creativity. It's more of, we just don't want to fucking curate any of that

58:11.900 --> 58:17.180
shit. Well, there's like, you know, Nazi propaganda or something. Yeah. I mean,

58:17.180 --> 58:20.940
we may get around to taking that out of there, but like, we don't fucking care.

58:22.060 --> 58:29.100
I can put a body simulator 2017. Let's do it. Why not? Oh, that's already a thing. So yeah,

58:29.100 --> 58:33.020
obviously no. And to be, you know, I'm talking about like, wow, it's just going to be this

58:33.020 --> 58:41.100
wasteland of garbage. I mean, to be fair, the iTunes app store and Google play are very similar.

58:41.100 --> 58:46.060
There's a lot of fucking waste land of garbage, but there are some diamonds in the rough.

58:46.060 --> 58:50.780
Obviously there are apps that we use every single day. There are games like,

58:51.900 --> 58:55.100
yeah. Like for example, we don't judge steam by it's, you know,

58:55.660 --> 59:01.980
buy everything that's on it because there's a lot of shit on there, but overall it's decent.

59:01.980 --> 59:06.380
Same with this, this, we should give you the benefit of the doubt because yes, there will be

59:06.380 --> 59:12.940
a lot of crap on it, but guess what? You don't have to buy the crap. Yeah. So it's going to be

59:12.940 --> 59:18.060
interesting to see what comes of this, but I mean, to be fair, like this is, you could publish your

59:18.060 --> 59:22.220
game. Loki, you always hype that you talk about your game here on the show. Now you have a place

59:22.220 --> 59:27.980
where you could put it and people could actually play it. We could, I'm not, I don't, I think we

59:27.980 --> 59:34.620
can, we would be able to make a VOG app, I think. Right. Like something where you could like,

59:34.620 --> 59:38.860
listen to VOG through Xbox one. I mean, if it would let you do that, you can already do that

59:38.860 --> 59:41.980
with tune in anyway, maybe not. Cause it might not be able to let you go online. I guess you'd have

59:41.980 --> 59:46.220
to stick with the tune in app to do that, but, uh, well flappy fog could be a standalone game,

59:46.220 --> 59:52.540
right? But it could, it could, if Bobby, the creator wanted to, it shouldn't.

59:52.540 --> 59:59.340
What was the line from Jurassic park? Just because they could, nobody stopped themselves

59:59.340 --> 01:00:07.420
to ever ask if they should. They shouldn't. Uh, let's see. SSU 100 Matt and chat over

01:00:07.420 --> 01:00:13.180
at live.vognetwork.com says how fast until the first porn game comes out already being created.

01:00:13.180 --> 01:00:18.460
Well, they can't cause that's against the rules, but I mean, there's, there's, there's way highly,

01:00:18.460 --> 01:00:28.300
highly suggestive like finds a way romance simulator 2017 or, or, um, vibrating controller.

01:00:28.300 --> 01:00:31.980
Exactly. It's all about the massage controllers because that's a thing.

01:00:31.980 --> 01:00:38.620
That's right. Exactly. All right. So we have that to look forward to as much as we tease it,

01:00:38.620 --> 01:00:44.060
you know, they're like, there are a few like real diamonds that turn out of these places,

01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:49.260
you know, and there are indie games of a level like, you know, that kind of come up through

01:00:49.260 --> 01:00:53.260
these ranks. Like, uh, like Stardew Valley was an indie game. That's, you know, huge everywhere

01:00:53.260 --> 01:00:57.740
now. Five nights at Freddy's was made in a game creator software thing. And I was huge is

01:00:57.740 --> 01:01:02.860
everywhere, you know? So it's not to say that just because it's this wasteland is that everything is

01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:07.020
going to be garbage, but you also have to rely on, you also have to recognize that some of the

01:01:07.020 --> 01:01:11.740
things you may make are terrible and really shouldn't be released on a commercial platform

01:01:11.740 --> 01:01:16.620
like this or anywhere at all. I wouldn't say anywhere at all. There's, there's places for it,

01:01:16.620 --> 01:01:20.700
but like some things that people make, like, especially if they're just like,

01:01:20.700 --> 01:01:25.740
I'm just going to cobble together a bunch of pre-made assets into like this very basic game

01:01:25.740 --> 01:01:32.140
that doesn't really function and I'm going to sell it for money that no, don't do that.

01:01:33.100 --> 01:01:36.540
Please do not do that. Please do not do that. Cause they, I've seen plenty of those games

01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:43.340
covered. There's plenty of them on steam and they're garbage and it just, you're better than

01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:50.460
that. To register participation for this week's episode of orange lounge radio at vognetwork.com

01:01:50.460 --> 01:01:57.340
use the passphrase sword as 200. Matt says the techno kitten adventure games. I'll remember when

01:01:57.340 --> 01:02:02.380
that was new and shiny and fun. Whatever happened to that? I think he's, I feel like he sold it to

01:02:02.380 --> 01:02:07.100
somebody else. Yeah. They kind of, they kind of ran it in the ground. All right. Anyway,

01:02:07.820 --> 01:02:10.620
let's move on. Dar Sakura. How about a, how about a different story?

01:02:11.740 --> 01:02:21.260
Yes. Um, well, I, um, I brought this up when we talked to Bobby, but do you remember the, um,

01:02:21.260 --> 01:02:26.940
the Metroid two remake, um, that Nintendo requested to be taken down?

01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:31.740
Of course I do. Cause I was, you know, well, I would say I was mad, but it's one of those

01:02:31.740 --> 01:02:35.260
things where it's like, well, we were just all waiting to see how long it was going to take.

01:02:35.260 --> 01:02:38.300
Am I right? But it's on the internet, so it's always on the internet. That's right.

01:02:39.820 --> 01:02:45.660
Well, um, the, uh, creator of this fan game, Milton, I'm going to mispronounce last name

01:02:45.660 --> 01:02:56.620
glass. Um, just got hired by, uh, moon studios to work on, um, the sequel to Ori and the blind

01:02:56.620 --> 01:03:05.100
forest. So, which is going to be called Ori and the will of the wisps. So that's pretty cool. Um,

01:03:06.460 --> 01:03:13.340
basically they really like what they did. They said he was a quote, incredible talent. And, uh,

01:03:14.060 --> 01:03:20.940
he passed whatever test that they gave him with flying colors and decided to, uh, hire him because

01:03:21.020 --> 01:03:27.980
he quote gets it. So kind of a happy ending in a way. I mean, what's interesting about Ori too,

01:03:27.980 --> 01:03:32.300
is that it's, it's a bit of a Metroidvania type of game in itself. I mean, obviously it has a very

01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:36.140
different look to it and the way it plays and everything, but it's a bit of a Metroidvania game.

01:03:36.140 --> 01:03:44.780
So it's not too off the beaten path from Metroid. So interesting how there was a legitimacy to this

01:03:44.780 --> 01:03:50.140
game, like big time. And now this guy has a career out of it, which it isn't the first,

01:03:50.140 --> 01:03:55.260
well, I don't know about fan games like this, but I'm thinking about like, um,

01:03:55.260 --> 01:04:00.940
well I think in mods, like obviously like Dota 2 came from even that, like the Skyrim mods and

01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:05.820
stuff. They've had a lot of people that made some of the major Skyrim mods or even, I think even

01:04:05.820 --> 01:04:11.580
more for that oblivion mods that went on to make, you know, other things for the game, like worked

01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:16.380
on some of the expansions and stuff, or now because Bethesda is pushing it, they can make

01:04:16.380 --> 01:04:24.380
that paid DLC mods shit that they're doing. Don't forget that. That's still a thing. Thank you,

01:04:24.380 --> 01:04:34.700
Bethesda. Well, I think, you know what though? Good for him. He was able to take a bad situation

01:04:34.700 --> 01:04:39.820
for him. I mean, a cease and desist is no fun and turning it into something good. So congrats.

01:04:39.820 --> 01:04:44.940
And a lot of us already downloaded the remake. Exactly. You didn't really stop anybody,

01:04:44.940 --> 01:04:49.180
but okay. Wink, wink, nudge, nudge. All right, moving on. Logie.

01:04:49.180 --> 01:04:55.580
So Capcom just recently released Mega Man Legacy Collection 2. And with that, of course,

01:04:55.580 --> 01:05:01.740
like the last one, they had like an art gallery, which featured concept art from various games that

01:05:01.740 --> 01:05:06.780
were featured in the collection. However, there was one piece of artwork that was filed under

01:05:06.780 --> 01:05:11.180
Mega Man 8 that people were like, wait a second. This doesn't look like anything that was in Mega

01:05:11.180 --> 01:05:17.660
Man 8. What the hell is this? And so people are wondering that this may not actually be Mega Man

01:05:17.660 --> 01:05:23.740
8. It may be something that's for another Mega Man game, because the art style for one is not,

01:05:23.740 --> 01:05:30.140
doesn't resemble Mega Man 8. It actually resembles character design from like the Mega Man Battle

01:05:30.140 --> 01:05:35.420
Network games. And so it kind of features Mega Man with this giant kind of segmented hand

01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:41.500
instead of his, you know, you know, Buster arm or something like that. So that's kind of neat.

01:05:43.180 --> 01:05:46.780
Hopefully it's a teaser for a new game. I don't know. I mean,

01:05:48.300 --> 01:05:52.220
who knows what it is? And Capcom's made mistakes before, so.

01:05:52.220 --> 01:05:57.180
Or was it just something where they were making a different game? Because, you know, obviously

01:05:57.900 --> 01:06:02.140
between Mega Man 6 and 7, they shifted platforms, right? 7 was on the Super Nintendo. And then

01:06:02.140 --> 01:06:08.060
between 7 and 8, it shifted over to PlayStation. So, and then, you know, there was a big long

01:06:08.060 --> 01:06:13.980
period between 8 and 9. The series was essentially done after 8. And then it didn't, it didn't come

01:06:13.980 --> 01:06:18.780
back, excuse me, until it was, oh, Retro is cool again. And the download stuff when Mega Man 9

01:06:18.780 --> 01:06:22.460
happened and they kind of went back to that Retro era. So maybe this was something that was being

01:06:22.460 --> 01:06:26.860
planned after 8, like the first Mega Man 9 that was maybe really supposed to be a continuation,

01:06:26.860 --> 01:06:31.180
that just ended up getting canned or something. Who knows? But like, we still don't know what it

01:06:31.180 --> 01:06:36.380
is and people are kind of letting their minds wander. That's what it is. Fanwank! Fanwank,

01:06:36.380 --> 01:06:41.500
of course. Yay! Of course. Why not? All right, moving on. Speaking of fanwank, hey, fanwank

01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:44.940
sometimes leads to some good things. Like, you know, again, kind of a running theme here. You

01:06:44.940 --> 01:06:52.220
got the Metroid 2 guy that got the job doing Ori and the Blind Forest sequel. Well, Sonic Mania

01:06:52.220 --> 01:06:57.100
is on its way. And if I remember right, didn't Sonic Mania kind of come from a fan project?

01:06:57.100 --> 01:07:03.580
Yeah, it's a fan made game, actually. Yeah. So Sonic Mania is now a legit SEGA release that's

01:07:03.580 --> 01:07:08.220
about to happen. And that's pretty cool. In fact, part of Sonic Mania, which is coming out,

01:07:08.220 --> 01:07:13.660
it's coming out next week for almost everybody, except the PC version got delayed a couple more

01:07:13.660 --> 01:07:19.580
weeks. But they're doing this thing where if you had already preordered it, you get Sonic 1 for

01:07:19.580 --> 01:07:23.820
free on Steam or you get a key to give to somebody else if you already have it. Like, they're trying

01:07:23.820 --> 01:07:27.820
to really apologize for that. But I guess some of the optimizations have to be tweaked out.

01:07:27.820 --> 01:07:32.300
Looks good. Yeah, no, it does look really good. Have you seen the intro yet? Yeah, I have. I want

01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:37.260
to check it out. Yeah, the intro looks fantastic. I mean, this is like this is how you put together

01:07:37.260 --> 01:07:41.580
a Sonic game. Yeah, I'm excited to try it. And then I don't know if you saw this, you see some

01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:45.900
of the video of the competitive multiplayer, because it looks exactly like it did in like

01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:50.700
Sonic 2 with like the squeezy screen and everything like that. So yeah, you can actually challenge

01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:57.820
your friends locally and play that. So that's that's really cool. So in fact, I'm trying to

01:07:57.820 --> 01:08:00.620
see if I can get a picture of it here in the studio for you guys. Yeah, there it is. So you

01:08:00.620 --> 01:08:05.420
can see it's like squishy, like the old like it used to look when you play Sonic 2 on the TV. So

01:08:05.420 --> 01:08:10.860
that's really cool. So yeah, I'm excited for Sonic Mania. Darsaka, you like Sonic 2. Is this

01:08:10.860 --> 01:08:15.260
something that catches your eye? You want to check this out? Maybe? All right. We talked about it.

01:08:15.260 --> 01:08:19.340
Yeah, it might happen. Might happen. All right. The best part about it, though, is it's not a

01:08:19.340 --> 01:08:25.340
full price game either. It's only $19.99. I like that. The price is right. And it's polished.

01:08:25.980 --> 01:08:30.140
For sure. All right. Just a few more stories for you guys than the classic Game of the Week.

01:08:30.140 --> 01:08:37.500
Darsaka? Well, you know, when we were kids, didn't you ever want to live in an arcade?

01:08:38.700 --> 01:08:43.260
Sure. I could just crawl in a Star Wars sit down cabinet and just sleep there, right?

01:08:43.260 --> 01:08:47.020
Hey, what would except those Chuck E. Cheese animatronics are kind of creepy.

01:08:47.660 --> 01:08:52.540
Oh, yeah. No, that that would have been hell. Yeah. People probably don't. The kids today

01:08:52.540 --> 01:08:56.220
probably don't have that fantasy because now we know that those animatronics come

01:08:56.220 --> 01:09:04.860
alive at night and will kill you. Exactly. So maybe maybe kids today don't have that

01:09:04.860 --> 01:09:08.460
fantasy like we used to have Darsira. Yeah. Well, anyway, it was reported by

01:09:08.460 --> 01:09:16.700
Kobe Shimbun that a 30 year old person named Maihara Kazuki was arrested for trespassing

01:09:17.260 --> 01:09:23.500
after they found him living between arcade cabinets at a game center in Kobe.

01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:28.780
Between arcade cabinets? Well, yeah, I would reckon, you know, or maybe like how they have

01:09:28.780 --> 01:09:37.020
some of them in a row, like a long row or in the circular setup, like some of the I mean,

01:09:37.180 --> 01:09:42.940
I've never, of course, been to Kobe, much less a game center in Kobe. So I'm not sure.

01:09:44.620 --> 01:09:49.420
But the same guy was also accused of robbery, having broken into a local junior high

01:09:50.300 --> 01:09:55.900
and to steal money in P.E. uniforms. You know what, though? Those are being sold

01:09:55.900 --> 01:10:02.140
to perverts. Well, no, hold up, because the girls bloomers maybe or it sounds like this guy might

01:10:02.140 --> 01:10:07.660
just be homeless. And maybe that's how he was finding clothes to wear. You know, like, I don't

01:10:07.660 --> 01:10:11.660
want to be at all like Debbie Downer, but this kind of sounds like this is a little more about

01:10:11.660 --> 01:10:16.140
some guy who was just, you know, doing questionable things in the eyes of the law because he was

01:10:16.140 --> 01:10:21.180
homeless as what it's what it's what it appears to be. Of course, I don't know any of the facts.

01:10:21.180 --> 01:10:27.740
We stole about one point to three million yen, which is right. A little over eleven grand.

01:10:28.460 --> 01:10:39.340
So. But yeah, I can't know. Yeah. Living in an arcade, probably not a good way to be

01:10:40.460 --> 01:10:46.620
unnoticed, probably. Yeah. So unless I don't know if I was a Dave and Busters, I would crawl in that

01:10:46.620 --> 01:10:51.180
giant life sized crane machine. I think that would be the place for it. But yes, the stuffed

01:10:51.180 --> 01:10:56.220
animals would keep me warm. Exactly. We hide. So there you go anyway. All right. Well, look, I hope

01:10:56.220 --> 01:11:02.700
this guy is OK and gets whatever help he needs. So we'll see. All right. Moving on. How about how

01:11:02.700 --> 01:11:07.420
about how about something else about the police? Loki, let's let's keep let's keep a theme going

01:11:07.420 --> 01:11:11.980
here. Who else got arrested? So there's a company that's in Santa Clara, California,

01:11:12.540 --> 01:11:17.340
um, by the name of the coin up store. And they were selling counterfeit

01:11:18.460 --> 01:11:27.020
Pac-Man and Galaga and tank battalion machines. So they were creating forgeries of those and

01:11:27.020 --> 01:11:35.420
selling them as new. And apparently they were also selling cabinets containing 60 to 3000 counterfeit

01:11:35.420 --> 01:11:39.980
games preload on them, which I mean, like, fuck, there's like so many retailers out there that sell

01:11:39.980 --> 01:11:45.660
the multi cart things. Wasn't one of the people arrested in Folsom, which is here locally,

01:11:45.660 --> 01:11:48.940
not that far from almost feel like when I read that story, like, because there's a whole group

01:11:48.940 --> 01:11:55.900
of people all throughout California. I know there's a I know there's a a kind of a main cabinet

01:11:55.900 --> 01:12:01.020
classic arcade in quotes, you know, company that is in full. Yes. And one of the people arrested

01:12:01.020 --> 01:12:05.660
was in Folsom because they do sell those multi cars. Fuck, I had one. I bought one of those

01:12:05.660 --> 01:12:11.820
carts for Neo Geo 60 to 60 in one cart for my arcade cabinet when I got in it.

01:12:11.820 --> 01:12:17.740
Well, I, I remember, okay, I was looking for, I think at some point I got a bug where I was

01:12:17.740 --> 01:12:21.420
looking for a baby Pac-Man machine. Remember I came really close. Like, remember that dark

01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:26.700
sucker. I actually was like, can I talk to Dan? Because I know he's really serious about this

01:12:26.700 --> 01:12:30.060
collecting and, and remember there was one, I was like really serious about cause it was here

01:12:30.060 --> 01:12:34.220
locally and I almost did it. But when I was looking for that and then I ultimately decided

01:12:34.220 --> 01:12:38.860
not to do it because there would have been a big risk involved with that. Um, I was looking at

01:12:38.860 --> 01:12:43.500
maybe a cocktail machine, right? Cause those are those cocktail cabinets, right? The sit down ones,

01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:47.660
right? Cause I remember there was a yogurt store when I was growing up that had like a Ms. Pac-Man

01:12:47.660 --> 01:12:51.580
cocktail and a time pilot cocktail. So I'd like to have one of those. I think it would be fun.

01:12:51.580 --> 01:12:56.060
Um, yeah, so it was one person, one of the individuals was from Folsom. Yeah. So I was

01:12:56.060 --> 01:13:03.100
like, so I was looking for cocktail cabinets and like a whole bunch of this, like 60 games,

01:13:03.100 --> 01:13:07.500
3000 games, all this stuff was coming up and it was being sold in Folsom. And I was like,

01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:11.580
Oh, that's not that far from here at all. Somebody must be putting together main cabinets and selling

01:13:11.580 --> 01:13:16.780
them in Folsom. Yeah. Those are the ones he was selling was actually main cabinets. These are,

01:13:17.820 --> 01:13:21.580
the thing is like, well, typically some are legit. You can do like an ultra,

01:13:21.580 --> 01:13:27.740
there's an ultra K type thing that's legit. So I'm not saying that all these multi games and,

01:13:27.740 --> 01:13:32.780
you know, one things are not legit. There's plenty of these ultra cadence things. I think even Costco

01:13:32.780 --> 01:13:36.140
sold something like this for a while. I want to say, um, you know, like websites,

01:13:37.260 --> 01:13:44.700
there's several like arcade game websites that sell legit cabinets. Like when I was looking for

01:13:44.700 --> 01:13:49.260
like, um, DVR cabinets and stuff, there's some websites that it'll sell those and they'll sell

01:13:49.260 --> 01:13:58.220
these multi-cart things, which aren't legit, but you know, I don't know. Uh, Stoppy in chat says

01:13:58.220 --> 01:14:02.060
Folsom. Well, at least they won't have to travel far. I think that's a, might be a joke about the

01:14:02.060 --> 01:14:05.900
prison that they have in Folsom, which is kind of infamous because of a certain country,

01:14:05.900 --> 01:14:11.340
Western singer that, uh, did a very famous concert there. Um, but, um, yeah, I mean,

01:14:11.900 --> 01:14:15.580
well, all those, usually, uh, if I don't know, would that be considered a federal offense at

01:14:15.580 --> 01:14:19.020
that point? Because they were selling those cabinets probably all across the country.

01:14:19.740 --> 01:14:24.700
Um, because the federal offense, I think gets you taken somewhere else. I don't know. All right.

01:14:25.580 --> 01:14:30.780
Well, anyway. All right. Uh, let's move on. I got one more story for you guys before we get to the

01:14:30.780 --> 01:14:37.260
classic game of the week. And this is about a classic game of sorts in itself. Uh, Blizzard

01:14:37.260 --> 01:14:44.140
is working on apparently still Warcraft three. That's right. 15 years after the release of

01:14:44.140 --> 01:14:50.300
Warcraft three, there are some changes coming to Warcraft three. There is a public test realm

01:14:50.300 --> 01:14:56.620
that is being, uh, I guess piloted for Warcraft three. Uh, so this is going to be testing new map

01:14:56.620 --> 01:15:01.500
pools for one versus one, two V two, three V three and four V four multiplayer. There's also

01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:07.020
supposed to be updates that address slow matchmaking. I, I can't imagine there's tons.

01:15:07.020 --> 01:15:11.100
I guess there, I guess Warcraft three probably is slow matchmaking compared to like when that

01:15:11.100 --> 01:15:16.060
originally came out over dial up. Most people probably, I think your expectations are maybe

01:15:16.060 --> 01:15:21.500
a little too high. I guess there's probably still a big enough audience for this though.

01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:26.700
Probably especially globally. Sometimes I have to remind myself that in other countries,

01:15:27.260 --> 01:15:30.860
sometimes the technology and everything, cause the computers might not be as easy to get as

01:15:30.860 --> 01:15:34.220
they are here. So sometimes like, you know, especially in other countries,

01:15:34.220 --> 01:15:36.940
this stuff is still popular. So I think that's something I have to remind myself.

01:15:36.940 --> 01:15:42.300
Um, but anyway, some updates that address slow matchmaking, lag, automated tournaments and

01:15:42.300 --> 01:15:48.300
ladder board, all of this being planned as well. Now, to be fair, Blizzard did patch

01:15:48.300 --> 01:15:54.540
not that long ago, Diablo two, I think was patched. So this isn't unheard of for Blizzard

01:15:54.540 --> 01:15:58.860
to go back and update old games, but it is still kind of one of those. Wow. A public test realm

01:15:58.860 --> 01:16:03.340
for a game that's that old must be a testament to the staying power of things like this. Right?

01:16:04.220 --> 01:16:06.860
For sure. It's also good. A lot of good will for your company

01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:13.340
in the year that you're releasing a Starcraft makeover, let us not forget. Blizzard is doing

01:16:13.340 --> 01:16:18.540
this Starcraft HD. Uh, they don't want to call it a remake because they're, they're,

01:16:18.540 --> 01:16:24.140
they're swearing by it is Starcraft. The only thing we have changed is the graphics pretty much

01:16:24.140 --> 01:16:29.180
so that, but that whole release is out this year too. So something to look forward to,

01:16:29.180 --> 01:16:35.100
maybe this is to, uh, well make people aware of that. I mean, retro is nice and all, but

01:16:35.100 --> 01:16:39.820
the kind of, it's like the Hollywood, okay, we run out of ideas. Let's just remake everything.

01:16:40.620 --> 01:16:45.340
Well, but Starcraft is kind of in its own league. I mean, even with Starcraft two,

01:16:45.340 --> 01:16:50.140
the original Starcraft is still as big as it is. You know what I mean? So yeah,

01:16:50.140 --> 01:16:54.940
there's that to consider. All right. Well, speaking of classic games like Warcraft three,

01:16:56.860 --> 01:17:01.500
it's time for the classic game of the week. And I think our soccer found a game that's even older.

01:17:01.500 --> 01:17:07.020
So she's going to step into the game and find a game that she thinks is worthy of your attention

01:17:07.020 --> 01:17:13.660
this week. Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week this week? The New Zealand story.

01:17:14.860 --> 01:17:20.140
Have you ever heard of it? I have. I don't know if I want to spoil how I heard, but it was in a,

01:17:20.860 --> 01:17:24.940
it was in a retro game collection I had on Xbox, basically. I think it was Xbox. Well,

01:17:24.940 --> 01:17:29.740
the New Zealand story came out in 1988 in the arcades and it was developed and published by

01:17:29.740 --> 01:17:38.540
Taito. You play as a kiwi named Tiki, a little kiwi bird, who has to save his girlfriend Fifi

01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:46.540
and other kiwi friends who have been kiwi napped by a blue leopard seal.

01:17:47.740 --> 01:17:55.020
And so you have to go through the levels, which are kind of mazish and trap different or rescue

01:17:55.020 --> 01:18:04.140
different kiwis that are trapped in the cage. So you basically have to get Tiki through the level,

01:18:04.860 --> 01:18:12.860
avoiding fire and spice because Tiki only takes one hit, and save each of his little kiwi friends.

01:18:13.420 --> 01:18:19.260
And you get different weaponry. You can get arrows, but you also can change them into bombs,

01:18:19.820 --> 01:18:24.780
lasers, or bouncing fireballs because, as we know, kiwi are known for their projectiles.

01:18:25.980 --> 01:18:28.860
Yes, I was, I was just thinking about that the other day, actually.

01:18:29.900 --> 01:18:36.540
Um, but each of these, um, weapons have, of course, different, uh, different abilities. You also

01:18:36.540 --> 01:18:43.740
can ride different vehicles, like balloons, blimps, and UFOs, because also, a little known fact,

01:18:44.300 --> 01:18:52.300
kiwi travel to outer space a lot. Anyway. And you can steal them, so kiwi are also notorious vehicle

01:18:52.300 --> 01:19:00.380
thieves. Um, look out for them kiwis. The levels are pretty big. Um, they scroll in multiple

01:19:00.380 --> 01:19:08.300
directions. You have to explore all over the place. Um, just really, really expansive. Um,

01:19:08.300 --> 01:19:14.300
and you have warp portals as well that take you to hidden parts of the game. And then, um,

01:19:15.900 --> 01:19:20.620
you sometimes, if you get killed by a projectile weapon in later levels, you get spent,

01:19:20.620 --> 01:19:28.700
you get sent to heaven, because all good kiwis go to heaven. Um. Where do bad kiwis go? Up your

01:19:28.700 --> 01:19:36.220
butt. You also can get a special, um, ending for playing through the heaven rod of the game.

01:19:37.100 --> 01:19:43.500
Um, there were, um. What the hell? I'm sorry, he just got eaten by a whale. Yeah. He had to

01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:49.740
shoot his way out of the whale. Yeah. What kind of drugs are these people on? Pinocchio drugs.

01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:57.340
Well, let's see. The kiwi's real name is Jonah. There we go. Um, you also, though, have, like,

01:19:57.340 --> 01:20:02.140
some things that we've seen in other games. If you take too long to clean the level, you get a hurry

01:20:02.140 --> 01:20:08.540
up warning, and you can get a power up by collecting letters that spell extend, like from Bubble

01:20:08.540 --> 01:20:17.980
Bobble. Um, the game did have conversions, um, to other, uh, to, uh, home units. Um,

01:20:17.980 --> 01:20:27.660
Ocean Software did computer versions, um, as well. There was the, um, NES version was put up by

01:20:28.460 --> 01:20:35.500
Software Creations, um, and, uh, it was published, um, in the PAL regions by Ocean.

01:20:36.220 --> 01:20:43.420
Um, but in North America, it was released, sorry, published by Taito as Kiwi Craze,

01:20:43.420 --> 01:20:50.780
with a K, instead of the New Zealand story. Um, it was also included in the Amiga 500 Batman pack

01:20:51.340 --> 01:20:57.020
that came out in September 1989. Because Kiwi teams up with Batman, apparently. And rides UFOs

01:20:57.020 --> 01:21:04.300
and steals things. Um, we did have conversions that came out on the FM Towns and the Sharp

01:21:04.380 --> 01:21:09.660
X68000 systems. Um, there was a Sega Mega Drive version that only came out in Japan,

01:21:10.300 --> 01:21:16.380
um, that was based off of the prototype version of the arcade game. And then, in more recent days,

01:21:16.380 --> 01:21:24.060
we've had the Taito Legends pack that brought it out for Xbox, PS2, and PSP, and PC. That's

01:21:24.060 --> 01:21:29.580
where I played it, finally. It was the Taito Legends pack, yeah. The PC Engine port, um,

01:21:29.580 --> 01:21:38.540
was released for Wii Virtual Console in Japan. Um, Tiki the Kiwi also appears in other Taito

01:21:38.540 --> 01:21:46.620
games, such as Liquid Kids, Bubble Symphony, and also, uh, Fifi is in Bubble Symphony,

01:21:46.620 --> 01:21:52.300
and Pop and Pop. And let's be real, oughta be a character in Smash Brothers, am I right?

01:21:52.300 --> 01:22:00.860
With his stealing of things. Yes. And bombs. Um, the game was remade, um, in, uh, 2007 by

01:22:00.860 --> 01:22:08.300
Rising Star Games as an Nintendo DS remake titled New Zealand Story Revolution, um, came out in

01:22:08.300 --> 01:22:18.700
Australia and Europe. In North America, it was, uh, published, um, hold on, yeah, as New Zealand

01:22:19.660 --> 01:22:25.820
Story Revolution as well. In Japan, it was released as New Zealand Story DS. And it has,

01:22:25.820 --> 01:22:31.980
it uses the dual screens for showing you different areas, and you use the touch screen to open doors,

01:22:31.980 --> 01:22:40.460
and, uh, use secret buttons, or actually flicking Tiki to safety. Um, you also have a four player

01:22:40.460 --> 01:22:46.620
wireless mode, um, normal and expert game modes, and, um, better graphics and better background

01:22:46.620 --> 01:22:55.740
music. Um, Tiki can also take several hits and can shoot at an angle. Um, the game was considered,

01:22:55.740 --> 01:23:04.540
uh, pretty well across the board, considered addicting, although, um, the, uh, Sinclair versions,

01:23:04.540 --> 01:23:13.100
or sorry, the ZX Spectrum versions were considered not as great. Um, the Nintendo DS1 received

01:23:13.740 --> 01:23:21.900
pretty average reception, um, but they said that some of the special, uh, features they put in it

01:23:21.900 --> 01:23:28.620
were poorly implemented. And there you go. All right, there it is, your classic game of the week,

01:23:28.620 --> 01:23:33.340
the New Zealand story. I think that we should adopt, um, was it actually from New Zealand,

01:23:33.340 --> 01:23:38.540
though? He was a Kiwi. That's about as, unless hobbits run by, I won't believe it. I just feel

01:23:38.540 --> 01:23:42.460
like it might be false advertising, that this story was not actually from New Zealand. Maybe

01:23:42.460 --> 01:23:48.140
we should adopt Tiki as our mascot. But we have the ferret. The ferret is dead.

01:23:49.900 --> 01:23:55.340
I actually do have another ferret somewhere, somewhere. We'll have to find that and bring

01:23:55.340 --> 01:24:01.020
that. There was like four or five of them at one time. There was the wolf ferret and like the,

01:24:01.020 --> 01:24:05.260
the other ferret, they weren't really ferrets, but they were, I'm sure there's one in a box somewhere.

01:24:05.260 --> 01:24:08.700
I'm going to order another one. And like a Nintendog, it will still be there waiting for

01:24:08.700 --> 01:24:15.100
me when I find it. I found one of my Nintendog swag from E3. Like it still has the little like

01:24:15.100 --> 01:24:20.060
card on it and everything. We'll stab it and say for the watch. All right, look, we're going to

01:24:20.060 --> 01:24:24.700
take a break. When we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, rapid fire news and what?

01:24:25.260 --> 01:24:29.660
It is a well-known fact that a Tiki do carry an arrow to dinner.

01:24:32.460 --> 01:24:37.180
We'll be back with more of such wit here at Orange Lounge Radio,

01:24:37.180 --> 01:24:41.820
your calls as well at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype and any emails. I don't know if we got

01:24:41.820 --> 01:24:45.900
any, but we'll do any emails we have. When we come back after this quick break with more of

01:24:45.900 --> 01:24:57.260
Orange Lounge Radio, right after this. Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge

01:24:57.260 --> 01:25:04.220
Radio. Live tonight, episode number 696 for this, August the 13th of 2017.

01:25:05.180 --> 01:25:09.900
Wow. We're looking almost at episode number 700 coming up in a few weeks. It's probably,

01:25:09.900 --> 01:25:14.460
let's see next week is 7, 696, 698. Then after Dragon Con is gonna be 699. So it's gonna be

01:25:14.460 --> 01:25:18.380
about mid September would be episode number 700 at this point, if you can believe it.

01:25:19.740 --> 01:25:23.180
Yeah, it's coming up that quick. What was supposed to be, it would have been the week before Dragon

01:25:23.180 --> 01:25:27.980
Con. I think if we had, you know, the hiatus hadn't happened. So, yeah, that sounds about right,

01:25:27.980 --> 01:25:32.780
mid September. So we'll have to see if we can do anything special for. I should talk to our pals

01:25:32.860 --> 01:25:36.860
over at the, the square one thing and see if we can do like a live thing. I think it would be fun

01:25:36.860 --> 01:25:40.220
so that we could open it up and have some people show up. Would anybody show up though? I don't

01:25:40.220 --> 01:25:45.020
know. We'll see. There's gotta be some, we'll have to invite some people like, Hey, you should come.

01:25:45.020 --> 01:25:48.860
So we'll get some game bang or something. Yeah, yeah, sure. Why not? Why some of our local

01:25:48.860 --> 01:25:53.580
podcasting pals? Why not? I think it would be fun. I think they just, they actually specifically,

01:25:53.580 --> 01:25:59.740
I think 100 or 200. Yeah. So yeah, just recently. So congrats to them. Cool. Awesome. Yeah. Good

01:25:59.820 --> 01:26:04.940
for them. That's a, there's not a lot of shows that get past 10. Let me tell you. So good,

01:26:04.940 --> 01:26:11.820
good for them. Fat pokey stop. I think barely got past 10. All right. Let's get into some rapid

01:26:11.820 --> 01:26:17.900
fire news. Oh yeah. Good. Thank you. Chatters. Act Def points out just in time for Loki's birthday.

01:26:18.540 --> 01:26:23.740
That's right. That would be right. Can't have episode six, six, six, but I'll take 700.

01:26:23.740 --> 01:26:28.700
There you go. Why not? Actually is your birthday on a Sunday this year? It's on a Monday. Oh act.

01:26:28.700 --> 01:26:33.580
Oh no, that's a six 99 is going to be the 10th. So it would be a, I think September 17th is the

01:26:33.580 --> 01:26:36.540
date we're looking at because September 3rd is going to be when I'm away at dragon con. So

01:26:36.540 --> 01:26:41.740
it looks like it'll be September 17th. So I'm sick again. Yeah. Unless who knows what might

01:26:41.740 --> 01:26:46.380
happen, but let's, let's not think like that. Let's think instead about some rapid fire news.

01:26:46.380 --> 01:26:52.780
Loki. All right. So this was kind of an unexpected gift, I guess, but rez rez infinite made its way

01:26:52.780 --> 01:26:59.340
out to PC this week. Um, it's pretty cool and totally unexpected, but yeah, they have it now.

01:26:59.340 --> 01:27:04.860
It's available on steam. You can get it at 1999. They include a course, you know, the bonus DLC,

01:27:04.860 --> 01:27:11.500
which is that area area X, which doesn't really bonus DLC. It's kind of included with the game,

01:27:11.500 --> 01:27:17.580
but you know, whatever. Um, it does also support VR. Um, and of course being that's PC 60 FPS

01:27:17.580 --> 01:27:24.620
gameplay and 4k resolution, uh, compatibility. Nice. Yeah. That's almost a reason to buy it

01:27:24.620 --> 01:27:30.460
right there for the 4k and the, the, all that, all those mods. So, I mean, that is something

01:27:30.460 --> 01:27:35.900
that's worth checking out. Um, and of course, you know, along with that, uh, some more stuff coming

01:27:35.900 --> 01:27:41.420
to the switch, uh, including the Jack box party packs one and two, those will be coming on the

01:27:41.420 --> 01:27:48.860
switch on the 17th. So, uh, later this week. Very soon. Very soon. Yeah. That's awesome.

01:27:48.860 --> 01:27:53.340
I think those games will do very well on the switch unless people already bought them other

01:27:53.340 --> 01:27:56.700
places, but I'm sure there's a new audience. Maybe they didn't. Well, they have party pack four

01:27:56.700 --> 01:28:01.900
scheduled to release later this year. Yeah. They were unveiling some of the games. I guess the only

01:28:01.900 --> 01:28:08.460
game coming back for the fourth one is a pivot three, three, uh, the, all the other games are

01:28:08.460 --> 01:28:13.020
new. Uh, I know they were previewing one called monster seeking monster, which I thought was

01:28:13.020 --> 01:28:18.620
funny. I want a sequel to the one that was that killer one effort. Trivia murder party. Yeah.

01:28:18.620 --> 01:28:23.020
Trivia murder party. They can do a standalone of that. I bet like a, you don't know Jack style

01:28:23.020 --> 01:28:27.500
thing. That would be a good TV show. You know how they did the, you don't know Jack thing. I think

01:28:27.500 --> 01:28:32.300
that would be funny. Trivia murder party would be a fun TV show. Yeah. Be like super kid. Like,

01:28:32.300 --> 01:28:37.500
cause obviously you don't kill people on TV, but be like a super campy like clue type of thing.

01:28:37.980 --> 01:28:41.420
I mean you can get celebrity guests or something like that. You just have it like silly.

01:28:41.420 --> 01:28:45.580
Why not? Well, actually, actually now I think about it in, I don't know if you guys ever saw

01:28:45.580 --> 01:28:49.100
this, Jamie, this sounds like something up your alley. You might've seen, did you know over on

01:28:49.100 --> 01:28:54.060
the other side of the pond over in Britain, they had clue as it were Cluedo as they call it over

01:28:54.060 --> 01:28:58.940
there. They had it as TV show. It was a full on because I'm Joanna Lumley was Ms. Peacock for

01:28:58.940 --> 01:29:03.100
one season and they would actually do these full like acting scenes. And then the contestants would

01:29:03.100 --> 01:29:07.100
actually like grill the contestants about what was because they were trying to solve

01:29:07.100 --> 01:29:11.660
basically the murder. So, I mean, not that obviously that is totally in common with trivia

01:29:11.660 --> 01:29:17.660
murder party, but, but murder on a game show on TV has been done before. That's my point.

01:29:18.700 --> 01:29:23.660
It would be funny. I think it'd be funny. Yes, for sure. All right. Uh, let's see,

01:29:23.660 --> 01:29:28.380
going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com. Uh, Bobby Blackwell says trivia murder party is the

01:29:28.380 --> 01:29:34.060
game all my friends want to play. And I can't get it out of my head that the announcer for,

01:29:34.060 --> 01:29:36.860
and this is not, everybody's going to understand this, but you're just gonna have to bear with me.

01:29:36.860 --> 01:29:43.820
The announcer for trivia murder party is Travis Donovan doing the DJ Satan thing. Like it is,

01:29:43.820 --> 01:29:48.060
I swear to God, like it's like every time I'm playing trivia murder party, I feel like it's

01:29:48.060 --> 01:29:52.540
Travis Donovan is DJ Satan. Like makes it even better. I know it kind of does. It kind of does.

01:29:52.540 --> 01:29:57.420
Uh, anyway, uh, let's see. Dark Tetsuya says, uh, does anyone remember who done it?

01:29:57.420 --> 01:30:01.500
Which was like the mole, but a murder mystery. Yes. That was just a couple of years ago on ABC.

01:30:01.500 --> 01:30:05.980
That was a, that was a neat show. I liked that. You know, it was kind of, it kind of had a bad

01:30:05.980 --> 01:30:12.700
ending though, because not to get too far into game show chat, but too late. The girl that lost,

01:30:12.700 --> 01:30:18.780
that was the runner up knew who the killer was from episode one. And because she did the worst

01:30:18.780 --> 01:30:25.180
in the final challenge, she got beaten by the guy who had yet to pick the right killer. So it was

01:30:25.180 --> 01:30:29.740
like, it kind of got ruined by that. But anyway, sorry. I'm totally digressing into something that

01:30:29.740 --> 01:30:34.060
I don't think anybody actually watched. Okay. Vid power says I watched every episode of it.

01:30:34.060 --> 01:30:39.580
So you know what I'm talking about? Like the ending didn't make sense. Oh, well. Anyway.

01:30:39.580 --> 01:30:44.220
Uh, it's, it seemed like, um, whoever the killer was in that show, it didn't fucking matter. Like

01:30:44.220 --> 01:30:48.780
it was just about the crimes every time. Anyway. All right. I wish that show would come back

01:30:48.780 --> 01:30:52.540
though. Actually the mole, since you brought it up, that's like seriously one of my all time

01:30:52.540 --> 01:30:58.540
favorite game shows. And it, it really blows my mind that they can't seem to get that show

01:30:58.540 --> 01:31:03.900
well-rated. I realized the original mole was kind of around, I think that the season one did fine.

01:31:03.900 --> 01:31:09.820
And then season two happened right around nine 11. So it got, cause Anderson Cooper hosted it

01:31:09.820 --> 01:31:15.420
and it was like, it was sassy Anderson Cooper, like rolling my eyes in a GIF Anderson Cooper

01:31:15.420 --> 01:31:18.940
that was hosting that show. And that's what made it so awesome. So then they tried to bring it

01:31:18.940 --> 01:31:23.500
back with like a couple of celebrity versions. Kathy Griffin was on one, which was great,

01:31:23.500 --> 01:31:28.300
but then they did, um, they had like another season with, I think they had a sports commentator

01:31:28.300 --> 01:31:32.940
guy hosting and it just, it just wasn't the same. It wasn't the same. They need to get a SAS master

01:31:32.940 --> 01:31:37.500
to host the mole and bring it back. Cause that show is bomb. So it was awesome.

01:31:37.500 --> 01:31:41.260
We can get William Shatner, the hosted like he did rescue nine one one.

01:31:41.260 --> 01:31:46.140
Why? I don't know about, we don't have, we don't have, we are Robert stack. He would have been,

01:31:46.140 --> 01:31:50.060
you know, perfect. I don't know who a good host for the mole would be. Why not? Let's,

01:31:50.060 --> 01:31:53.980
let's let a lady try it. You know, it's been, it's been a bunch of guys. Why not? Let's let

01:31:53.980 --> 01:31:58.620
a lady try it and maybe it can be a little, uh, little, um, sassy with it. I don't know.

01:31:58.620 --> 01:32:04.300
I just don't know who I would see in that role. Aisha Tyler. Yeah. Aisha Tyler. Why not? That's

01:32:04.300 --> 01:32:10.780
my go-to game show host. Cause she does great with, um, uh, the whose line is it anyway? Yeah.

01:32:10.780 --> 01:32:14.860
There you go. That's there. I think I used to Tyler for a reboot of the mole cause she can be

01:32:14.860 --> 01:32:19.020
funny, but doesn't like, doesn't have to be funny. You know what I mean? She can kind of

01:32:19.020 --> 01:32:23.740
play it serious, but anyway, all right, I'm going way too far down this rabbit hole with

01:32:23.740 --> 01:32:29.500
H. John Benjamin. So we can just get the, the Lana and Archer back and forth. Uh, let's see,

01:32:29.500 --> 01:32:35.260
uh, looking at chat over at live.voggenetwork.com. Uh, some folks are, okay. I'm, I'm glad that folks

01:32:35.260 --> 01:32:40.060
are with the change in here because Bobby Black Wolf says John Barrowman. Okay. Now talk about

01:32:40.060 --> 01:32:44.380
a SaaS master and then Bobby Black Wolf also mentioned Aisha Tyler. So we're, we're, I guess,

01:32:44.380 --> 01:32:50.460
uh, we're on the same page here. Let's see. A vid power says a SaaS Anderson Cooper was great.

01:32:50.460 --> 01:32:54.860
Absolutely. The mole was great before it became celebrity moles as Kaijuto and Kaijuto says,

01:32:54.860 --> 01:33:01.340
I will only settle for a Brit as the host of the mole. What about Anne Robinson from the

01:33:01.340 --> 01:33:06.060
weakest link? What the hell is she doing anymore? I don't know, but she does. She had that one thing

01:33:06.700 --> 01:33:10.700
where whatever happened to her, right? I don't know. You guys don't remember the weakest link,

01:33:10.700 --> 01:33:15.820
right? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think it ran longer overseas in Britain than it did here, but it was,

01:33:15.820 --> 01:33:20.060
it was big for like a hot minute here. Like that same year survivor blew up here in the U S which

01:33:20.060 --> 01:33:25.180
is still on all these years later. Like the, the weakest link was huge for like two years.

01:33:25.180 --> 01:33:29.900
And then it was kind of on that. Who wants to, who wants to be a millionaire still thing? I mean,

01:33:29.900 --> 01:33:35.100
I think that's still around. It was on daytime TV. Meredith Vieira hosted it for the longest time.

01:33:35.100 --> 01:33:39.100
And then I want to say it went to Cedric the entertainer was hosting it, but I don't know if

01:33:39.100 --> 01:33:42.700
it's still doing new episodes and I might be wrong on the host. I don't know. It's like

01:33:42.700 --> 01:33:47.900
in syndication, but like it was kind of building off of that hype. So, yeah. Yeah. So there you go.

01:33:47.900 --> 01:33:56.380
Oh, Raging. Oh, Ragingator says Greg Proops. Yes. Ragingator, that might be the best comment you've

01:33:56.380 --> 01:34:02.460
ever made on this program. He should host it doing the voice he does for Karl Lagerfeld.

01:34:02.460 --> 01:34:07.180
I love it. Greg Proops is a great idea. But he has to do the Karl Lagerfeld voice.

01:34:07.180 --> 01:34:11.580
Yeah. I love it. All right. Moving on. Let's move on. We got to get back into the actual

01:34:11.580 --> 01:34:19.260
gaming news. Oh yes. Rapid fire news. The quickly done segments. Let's talk about Overwatch.

01:34:19.260 --> 01:34:24.700
Speaking of death, uh, coming to Overwatch is, uh, death matches coming to Overwatch.

01:34:24.700 --> 01:34:31.340
So, um, uh, death matches are coming to Overwatch in the, uh, developer update video, uh, explained

01:34:31.340 --> 01:34:37.020
that Overwatch is going to be getting free for all and team deathmatch modes. Uh, so this objective,

01:34:37.020 --> 01:34:42.380
uh, like an other free, uh, or excuse me, other first person shooter games is to get more kills

01:34:42.380 --> 01:34:47.980
than the opponents. Now, this is a big deal though, because Overwatch was kind of sold as

01:34:47.980 --> 01:34:53.180
I am not that kind of game. And now it is that kind of, yeah, I kind of worry that it's not

01:34:53.180 --> 01:34:58.700
balanced for that. It is totally isn't. I don't know how that's gonna work because like,

01:34:59.180 --> 01:35:03.260
but I blame any of those fucking support characters. I know. Right. Like how is a character

01:35:03.260 --> 01:35:06.300
like, I'm trying to think of somebody like, I would say mercy. I mean, mercy does have the

01:35:06.300 --> 01:35:13.020
pistol, but how is a character like mercy gonna last against somebody like this? Just pure DPS,

01:35:13.020 --> 01:35:17.820
like junk rat or something. You know what I mean? So I was kind of nerfed the last one.

01:35:17.820 --> 01:35:22.540
You have another buffing them on the PTR. Oh my fucking God. I can't keep track of this shit.

01:35:23.180 --> 01:35:28.780
But it's, it's a great, it's a great, um, it's a great game. So I mean, it's weird in a way

01:35:28.780 --> 01:35:32.380
that they're doing deathmatch, but I guess it is something people have been asking for. It's not

01:35:32.380 --> 01:35:38.540
like it's replacing the regular quick matches options. It's an arcade mode like Lucio ball

01:35:38.540 --> 01:35:41.820
ball is now. So they're going to do, which by the way is a lot of fun. I saw that. It's like,

01:35:41.820 --> 01:35:45.660
I saw a video of them. Is that a mod? Is that a completely different game? It's rocket league.

01:35:47.900 --> 01:35:52.220
It's rocket league and Overwatch, but, but it works because the character of Lucio, I mean,

01:35:52.220 --> 01:35:55.980
they didn't like change him or anything. They changed his ultimate. That's it to make us,

01:35:55.980 --> 01:36:00.060
to make him move faster. One thing like ice in this is kind of going a totally different game

01:36:00.060 --> 01:36:04.780
here. Call of duty, um, auto warfare, the remaster that they did for that. They have that whole,

01:36:05.420 --> 01:36:12.300
um, I forget the modes called now, but it's the one where one round people are inanimate objects.

01:36:12.300 --> 01:36:16.860
They have to hide in the map and then the other team has to go and find them and kill them.

01:36:17.740 --> 01:36:21.980
That's fucking hilarious. And that alone, that mode in there makes me want to buy that game

01:36:21.980 --> 01:36:26.300
because that looks so awesome. It's like new shit introduced like that. So let's Overwatch

01:36:26.300 --> 01:36:32.220
add something like that. Cause well, I would like to see an Overwatch be expanded on is the, uh,

01:36:32.220 --> 01:36:37.580
co-op stuff. And they did this during the uprising event. They had that little mini thing you could

01:36:37.580 --> 01:36:45.340
play with. What was it? Mercy, Torbjorn, Reinhardt, somebody else soldier or something. I don't know.

01:36:45.340 --> 01:36:49.260
It was like four characters that you could do. And like you did like a PVE thing and I really

01:36:49.260 --> 01:36:54.300
wish they would expand on that more or maybe a single player type of experience. But, um,

01:36:54.300 --> 01:36:57.660
I guess we'll have to, uh, we'll have to stay tuned to see if anything like that is in the

01:36:57.660 --> 01:37:02.220
future, but yeah, death or death mat, uh, yeah, death match team death match and all that, uh,

01:37:02.220 --> 01:37:06.460
is no longer off the table. It's going to be put in the game. So we, I think that just a lot of

01:37:06.460 --> 01:37:10.860
people are hoping that death match doesn't influence the regular game. Like if death

01:37:10.860 --> 01:37:14.860
match is there and it's completely unbalanced and ridiculous, then they just need to let it

01:37:14.860 --> 01:37:20.460
stay that way. I think it's more of like, I think it's more of like to get people that may have

01:37:20.460 --> 01:37:25.180
played those other types of games. So like I'm looking for something more like that in that game

01:37:25.180 --> 01:37:29.420
and they'll buy it and like, Oh, Hey, this is cool. I want to try the other modes. Oh,

01:37:29.420 --> 01:37:34.300
Hey, I like the regular mode. Yay. I'm in the game now. You know, it's like maybe to get people

01:37:34.300 --> 01:37:39.180
from other genres and thank you for the correction in chat. You guys, it was tracer and not sold.

01:37:39.180 --> 01:37:42.620
Tracer was the other, of course, tracers on the box. She's a big character. And the advisor

01:37:42.620 --> 01:37:46.860
remember it was, you know, like the years ago with the beginning of the Overwatch anyway.

01:37:46.860 --> 01:37:51.660
So that is something to look forward to with Overwatch. Back to Nintendo. Nintendo is going

01:37:51.660 --> 01:37:57.260
to be doing a special panel at PAX West. PAX West, of course, is happening the same time as

01:37:57.260 --> 01:38:01.980
DragonCon. So I haven't been talking about it as much on this show, but obviously a huge gaming

01:38:01.980 --> 01:38:07.100
convention that happens in Seattle. It used to be PAX Prime, but now they are just, they, they made

01:38:07.100 --> 01:38:12.300
a full compass out of it. So it's PAX West and it's going to take place September 1st to September

01:38:12.300 --> 01:38:17.900
4th. And the Nintendo panel is happening on Saturday. So, um, no idea who's hosting it,

01:38:17.900 --> 01:38:22.940
although I would imagine, um, it's going to be the talent, probably the tree house people,

01:38:22.940 --> 01:38:29.180
because get this Charles Martinet is, uh, at DragonCon. So he's not on the panel.

01:38:30.620 --> 01:38:34.380
So unless he's flying back and forth, which I guess is possible, he might only be there certain

01:38:34.380 --> 01:38:39.100
days, but it's probably gonna be the tree house gang or something is doing that. Uh, or who knows

01:38:39.100 --> 01:38:43.420
this is in Nintendo's backyard. Could Reggie Fils-Aime show up? Miyamoto, don't hold your

01:38:43.420 --> 01:38:47.180
breath. Don't get too hyped. You'll probably be the tree house guys, but even then, oh, may,

01:38:47.180 --> 01:38:53.340
might they be announcing something? Could this be a new Nintendo way of doing things? You know,

01:38:53.340 --> 01:38:57.980
we've never seen them announce something. Lower those expectations, lower those expectations.

01:38:57.980 --> 01:39:03.180
We still have like, does Nintendo participate in games com? Cause that's right around the corner.

01:39:03.180 --> 01:39:06.940
We keep forgetting about that. No, that's true. Is that this week? Is that next week? I know it's

01:39:06.940 --> 01:39:11.020
pretty soon. It's yeah, it's either this week or next week. It's before labor. There's supposed

01:39:11.020 --> 01:39:15.340
to be lots of big announcements after all. Remember how Sony didn't have shit the show?

01:39:15.340 --> 01:39:21.660
Yeah. They're supposed to be holding back stuff for games com. So yep. Let's hear it. Yeah. It

01:39:21.660 --> 01:39:26.140
should be an exciting show. Yeah. I mean, I'd be cool. Like if they announced something, um,

01:39:27.020 --> 01:39:31.020
but I'm not, I don't have like high expectations. I can see like, here's a new game mode for

01:39:31.020 --> 01:39:37.980
splatoon two. Okay. Yeah. Or a new, new DLC character in arms between mustard and relish.

01:39:39.900 --> 01:39:47.980
I said you guys like the ketchup. Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh. So I didn't talk about this

01:39:47.980 --> 01:39:52.460
during my gaming week, but I did fucking play that splat fest, which was mayonnaise versus ketchup.

01:39:52.460 --> 01:39:57.340
Right. I'm sorry. You all fucking know how I feel about mayonnaise. I fucking hate mayonnaise. I

01:39:57.340 --> 01:40:03.260
hate it. It is. It is the devil's condiment. It's it's terrible. And so like, first I rolled

01:40:03.260 --> 01:40:08.300
my eyes when I saw the, the, the, the matchup, because I already knew, I already knew. I said,

01:40:08.860 --> 01:40:13.500
because this, this is it. Mayo's going to win. Like I just, I just know Mayo's going to win.

01:40:13.500 --> 01:40:16.780
It doesn't even matter what I do or what I play when it doesn't matter. Mayo's going to fucking

01:40:16.780 --> 01:40:23.020
win. Sure enough. Mayo fucking wins. But why did Mayo fucking win? Because it's delicious

01:40:23.020 --> 01:40:29.100
because people actually interpreted the, the, I'm going to tell Alan to put your Starbucks in

01:40:29.100 --> 01:40:33.740
the garbage and then you can dish it out of the garbage and drink it. Because if you like Mayo,

01:40:33.740 --> 01:40:38.940
you probably like that too. So close to carb garbucks. Was it because people actually

01:40:38.940 --> 01:40:42.700
interpreted because people are dirty little assholes and they interpreted the whole event

01:40:42.700 --> 01:40:48.140
as man splooged and blood. Well, that was the, okay. So when they, when they finally were,

01:40:48.140 --> 01:40:52.300
when they showed the stages and they were like, Oh no, Rob, not only are they going to use like

01:40:52.300 --> 01:40:56.940
one of your least favorite food on the entire planet, but the splatting is actually going to be

01:40:57.660 --> 01:41:02.620
mayonnaise and ketchup looking things. That was the only way I was able to tolerate Splatfest was

01:41:02.620 --> 01:41:08.540
to tell myself it's semen versus blood. It's semen versus blood because I would rather that

01:41:08.540 --> 01:41:13.980
than mayonnaise, which ought to tell you something. Anyway, here's the thing. So I was playing team

01:41:13.980 --> 01:41:18.780
ketchup, right? Every single fucking match I was getting ketchup versus ketchup, ketchup versus

01:41:18.780 --> 01:41:23.660
ketchup. And when I would get a matchup that was team male, it was like players that were like 13

01:41:23.660 --> 01:41:29.340
levels higher than everybody on our team. So it was like, like the matchmaking in it was shit.

01:41:29.340 --> 01:41:35.260
It was so bad. I was so irritated by the matchmaking. I, I, I actually know I looked

01:41:35.260 --> 01:41:42.700
at my win loss ratio during Splatfest. I won 20% of the matches. And that's not even, and before

01:41:42.700 --> 01:41:47.820
you team Mayo fucks come and be like, well, that's cause team Mayo is awesome. No, it's because the,

01:41:47.820 --> 01:41:53.180
it's because the matchmaking sucked. And most of those matches were ketchup versus ketchup where

01:41:53.180 --> 01:41:56.620
the matchmaking still sucked. Like I would be there with my team and I'd be like, all right,

01:41:56.620 --> 01:42:00.300
well maybe we'll get, you know, and then the other team would pop in and it's all like double digit

01:42:00.300 --> 01:42:06.860
level people. And I'm like, son of a bitch. How is this supposed to be fair? So that was irritating.

01:42:06.860 --> 01:42:10.620
Nintendo network online. Can't do it. Fucking stupid.

01:42:10.620 --> 01:42:15.260
That was irritating. I was so irritated. Anyway, I already knew, I already knew Mayo was going to

01:42:15.340 --> 01:42:23.500
win. So I just, anyway, so we'll see what happens in the next Splatfest. In fact,

01:42:23.500 --> 01:42:29.740
I was actually thinking that would be a really good listless topic for us is a future Splatfest.

01:42:29.740 --> 01:42:33.740
So please look forward to it. That'll be coming in the next couple of weeks to the show.

01:42:33.740 --> 01:42:40.140
What should the next Splatfest be? All right. Anyway, I don't know what else. I don't know what

01:42:40.140 --> 01:42:47.660
else to say with that. So let's move on to some other rapid, our rapid fire news, news stories

01:42:47.660 --> 01:42:54.220
done quickly, right? Dark Sakura, what do you have for us? Girl, I'm not even evening anymore.

01:42:57.180 --> 01:43:04.940
So if you like Metroid, there's going to be a Metroid new Nintendo 3DS XL.

01:43:04.940 --> 01:43:12.060
Yay. 200 bones. I might. Somebody buy me one. I might not, but I might buy myself one.

01:43:13.820 --> 01:43:19.420
Jamie. I haven't bought, I haven't. Here's the amazing thing about this. No, this is important.

01:43:19.420 --> 01:43:22.860
Look, I know the same. It's going away too long, but this is important. It's important.

01:43:22.860 --> 01:43:28.860
What about quick? All right. So we've had this talk on OLR that I'm not convinced I need a new

01:43:28.860 --> 01:43:33.900
Nintendo 3DS, right? And you don't need one. There's nothing, there's no games. I don't need

01:43:33.900 --> 01:43:38.060
the super Nintendo emulation. They have what two games that require a new three. I don't need it.

01:43:38.060 --> 01:43:45.740
Right. But once they unveiled this, you know what I said? It shall be mine. I need it. It's

01:43:45.740 --> 01:43:53.420
the precious. I need it. So finally this whole Samus system actually come with the game.

01:43:55.260 --> 01:43:58.460
I mean, it's Nintendo. Of course it doesn't. Well, I don't know. My, my, uh,

01:43:58.460 --> 01:44:05.740
Zelda one did actually the Pokemon for Dan. So, but I love my Zelda 3DS. It's so pretty, but

01:44:06.460 --> 01:44:13.660
Samus she's a goddess. I know the goddess of bounty hunters and squishy alien things.

01:44:13.660 --> 01:44:18.380
I'm probably going to have to buy it anyway. Sorry to interrupt, but it was important.

01:44:18.380 --> 01:44:23.340
And in other news that no one gives a shit about ghost writers joining Marvel versus Capcom infinite

01:44:25.020 --> 01:44:27.340
because no one gives a shit about Marvel versus Capcom.

01:44:27.340 --> 01:44:31.500
Yeah, I just can't. I mean, did you finally jump off that train? Did you play the demo?

01:44:31.500 --> 01:44:35.980
Did you play the demo? No, I didn't. I'm just saving my, my heart for dragon ball fighters.

01:44:35.980 --> 01:44:38.780
You need to play the demo so you can get that final nail in your heart.

01:44:40.220 --> 01:44:46.860
Why cap calm? Why did you do this? I kept calm. Isn't worried about its fans anymore.

01:44:46.860 --> 01:44:52.700
They just want to get new people and the story. So that's a thing that happened during our break.

01:44:52.700 --> 01:44:57.340
Dark Sakura got off the Marvel versus Capcom bandwagon at some point.

01:44:57.340 --> 01:45:00.700
I'd rather just go back and play like, like the second one.

01:45:00.700 --> 01:45:04.300
I think, you know, I think, I think most people are exactly where you're at,

01:45:04.300 --> 01:45:07.500
where it's like, I'll just go back and play the other one or third one.

01:45:07.500 --> 01:45:12.940
Although the third one, I'm still pissed off because there's a fucking stupid bad box art.

01:45:12.940 --> 01:45:18.140
Mega man. Thank you. Cap com you fucking assholes. Or I hear more people excited about the dragon

01:45:18.140 --> 01:45:25.420
ball thing as well. It's a good game. I mean, Oh my God. All right. Now my turn to derail shit.

01:45:25.420 --> 01:45:37.980
Fine. Someone put an animation discussion on YouTube about why it looks so good. And they,

01:45:37.980 --> 01:45:44.300
he basically did freeze frames of the animation. Cause it's, it's running in 60 frames, right?

01:45:44.300 --> 01:45:49.660
You can tell by each pause where ashes and effects in the background are moving,

01:45:49.660 --> 01:45:57.820
but the characters themselves are moving at a more stilted rate, meaning that they move like

01:45:57.820 --> 01:46:05.580
animation cells do, you know, with a little bit of, you know, motion line and frame skipping and

01:46:05.580 --> 01:46:15.100
things like that. So the characters animations are jumped point to point to point in live

01:46:15.100 --> 01:46:21.900
animation. And that right there is like, that is attention to detail and probably a bit of a

01:46:21.900 --> 01:46:27.020
programming Marvel come to think of it. It, they, they pick up the frames a little bit better in the

01:46:27.020 --> 01:46:33.980
actual fighting, but just in those introductions and outros and things like that, it, it follows

01:46:33.980 --> 01:46:40.700
animation rules down to the effects. And that is what, first of all, just makes it visually

01:46:40.700 --> 01:46:46.620
perfect. It looks like you were playing the show. Yeah. That's awesome. It's kind of like,

01:46:46.620 --> 01:46:51.340
like totally different type of genre, but like the South Park game, right? The, even the old,

01:46:51.340 --> 01:46:55.660
even the first one, the stick of truth kind of felt like you were playing the cartoon. And now

01:46:55.660 --> 01:47:01.500
with this new one, I'm sure it's even going to be more so. So yeah, for sure. So anyway,

01:47:01.500 --> 01:47:04.780
speaking of, uh, YouTube's and things of this nature, I have to ask about that. Look,

01:47:05.580 --> 01:47:09.100
you guys didn't send in any, you had three weeks to send us an email and my understanding is we

01:47:09.100 --> 01:47:14.860
have no emails tonight, right? Our soccer. So, so, so fine. You you've earned this derailment

01:47:14.860 --> 01:47:18.540
of tonight's orange launch radio. So let me ask Loki, cause you've been tweeting a lot about

01:47:18.540 --> 01:47:23.100
YouTube and some of the things you've been watching on YouTube. And so you've been watching,

01:47:23.100 --> 01:47:28.540
what is this hour long discussions about the ready player one teaser, right? No, I've been,

01:47:28.540 --> 01:47:31.820
I watched those occasionally. Like I want to hear what people, I'd like,

01:47:31.820 --> 01:47:34.780
I want to see what people's reactions like were to the trailer.

01:47:36.700 --> 01:47:42.380
And I, my God, there's these people like, yeah, I read the book and this and this and this,

01:47:42.380 --> 01:47:46.860
and they're getting everything fucking wrong. Like stuff that they're talking about. Yeah,

01:47:46.860 --> 01:47:52.060
this happened in the book. It's like fucking wrong. And don't get me wrong. Like I understand

01:47:52.060 --> 01:47:56.460
where people can make mistakes. However, if you're researching, well, obviously they're

01:47:56.460 --> 01:48:01.100
not researching shit because they're just fucking put out videos. And to be clear,

01:48:01.100 --> 01:48:05.420
we never make mistakes on it all the time. Yeah, but it doesn't matter. I don't research anything.

01:48:05.420 --> 01:48:10.140
I do this at the last minute and I don't fucking care. So that's, that's, that's the level of

01:48:10.140 --> 01:48:16.060
effort you're getting for me. Sorry. I don't get paid for this. So you, you earn every penny of

01:48:16.060 --> 01:48:22.780
that. Um, no, but like the thing I like don't like is like, of course it's click baity shit.

01:48:22.780 --> 01:48:27.260
Like these videos are like, yeah, it's every Easter egg in the trailer, every single one

01:48:27.260 --> 01:48:31.180
of them, except it's not because it's just the ones that everybody else has said. And you're

01:48:31.180 --> 01:48:36.300
just regurgitating this shit one more time. It's like, I wanted to like, I was like, dammit,

01:48:36.300 --> 01:48:40.700
I'm fucking pissed off of seeing this shit. Like I wish I could just do a video and like

01:48:41.820 --> 01:48:45.900
do my own trailer analysis of it and actually go into details like

01:48:45.900 --> 01:48:49.420
spoilery shit. Like, you know, there's a leaked script out there by the way,

01:48:49.420 --> 01:48:53.980
it's an early draft of the script. But when you read that script and you watch the trailer,

01:48:53.980 --> 01:48:57.660
you're like, Oh, I know what all this shit is because it's in context.

01:48:57.660 --> 01:49:01.020
Okay. If only you knew somebody with a recording studio and a green screen.

01:49:01.900 --> 01:49:07.100
I just, I, I, you know, I was actually, as my backdrop was going to use my shitty ass garage

01:49:07.100 --> 01:49:10.540
cause I don't fucking care. Why not? But we did all our in a garage.

01:49:11.260 --> 01:49:16.780
I just don't care enough to like do all that. Like, and then, you know, also being tired again,

01:49:16.780 --> 01:49:20.860
like I actually was like taking notes. I was trying to like get more detail of like finding

01:49:21.420 --> 01:49:25.980
more Easter eggs, like for stuff in the background, like actually researching stuff and

01:49:25.980 --> 01:49:30.220
trying to figure it out instead of like, Oh well, this person said it's this or Hey,

01:49:30.220 --> 01:49:35.340
did you notice that there was the fucking iron giant there? Did you see that? Because that's

01:49:35.340 --> 01:49:42.860
totally strict. Like how do you fuck it? It's not an Easter egg if it's in the big fucking open.

01:49:42.860 --> 01:49:46.700
Okay. That's not an Easter egg. Do you know what a fucking Easter egg is? Easter egg is

01:49:46.700 --> 01:49:51.740
shit that's hiding in the background that only the true fans would fucking see. That's an Easter egg.

01:49:51.740 --> 01:49:56.540
Act Efton chat, garage rants featuring Loki. I know Loki sitting on a million dollar idea, but

01:49:57.180 --> 01:50:04.220
garage rants. Okay. That's a name. I can do it. I've got a couch in there. It's fucking dirty as

01:50:04.220 --> 01:50:10.780
shit. Why? But it's, you're, you expect a dirty, it's dirty. It's fucking hot. There's cat vomit

01:50:10.780 --> 01:50:19.100
on the ground. That is where I'm going to film this. Sounds quaint. All right.

01:50:22.460 --> 01:50:25.900
Can't afford a fucking green screen. You get garage.

01:50:25.900 --> 01:50:32.380
SSG 100. Matt says, great grants. Get it? Rage. All right. Anyway, moving on.

01:50:33.660 --> 01:50:37.900
Let's talk about what's coming out in stores this week. Something a little sooner than Loki

01:50:37.980 --> 01:50:41.660
finishing a project. Loki, what's coming out in the U S there's actually some pretty good

01:50:41.660 --> 01:50:46.300
stuff coming out this week. Um, surprisingly. So ironically enough, since we were just talking

01:50:46.300 --> 01:50:51.020
about this star craft remastered actually comes out tomorrow. So I didn't realize it was so soon.

01:50:51.020 --> 01:50:57.340
So check it out. Nice. Um, the game that I just can't get hyped about, I've watched every trailer

01:50:57.340 --> 01:51:04.060
for this. I'm a huge fan of saints row, but I can not get hyped about this game at all.

01:51:04.700 --> 01:51:09.100
Even if they have agents of mayhem, that's coming out of PC, PlayStation four and Xbox one.

01:51:09.660 --> 01:51:15.420
I want to try it. I want to try it. I really want it to be good, but I just,

01:51:15.420 --> 01:51:19.740
that's why it set the bar low Loki. And if it's my problem, here's my problem.

01:51:19.740 --> 01:51:24.940
My problem is originally it was kind of like, okay, it's its own thing. It has no real ties

01:51:24.940 --> 01:51:28.780
to the saints row universe. We're going to put some saints row stuff kind of hints in the

01:51:28.780 --> 01:51:34.540
background, but it's, it's its own thing completely different. Oh, by the way, because

01:51:34.540 --> 01:51:38.060
we're not really confident in this game doing well, we're just going to have Johnny gap come

01:51:38.060 --> 01:51:42.780
in there and we're going to say, Oh, it's, it's a fucking tied in with, you know, get out of hell

01:51:42.780 --> 01:51:46.380
because it was one of the endings, even though it wasn't quite one of the endings, but we're just

01:51:46.380 --> 01:51:50.940
going to tie it to the saints row universe because we're scared shitless that a new IP is not going

01:51:50.940 --> 01:51:55.980
to do well. It's just, it's fucking annoying. There might be other reasons that it doesn't

01:51:55.980 --> 01:52:00.300
do well. Looking at chat over at live.vog network.com as 200, Matt says, I forgot about

01:52:00.300 --> 01:52:04.220
agents of mayhem. Dungeon buster says, whoa, agents of mayhem is coming out this week. It

01:52:04.220 --> 01:52:07.980
seemed to have zero marketing at all. Yeah. I'm thinking, I think they might have a different

01:52:07.980 --> 01:52:14.860
problem. It's pretty, it's like they're rip off of crackdown basically, which I've ironically was

01:52:14.860 --> 01:52:21.740
kind of saints row four, but this is even worse to that. I don't know. It's I will give it the

01:52:21.740 --> 01:52:25.180
benefit of doubt. I'm not buying it launch. I'm telling you that much. I'll get it in the bundle

01:52:25.180 --> 01:52:30.460
later on. Fair enough. Um, city skylines coming out on PlayStation four, uh, matter fall on

01:52:30.460 --> 01:52:38.540
PlayStation four, a knee hog, uh, two on PC, Mac and PlayStation four night trap, 25th anniversary

01:52:38.540 --> 01:52:45.580
on PC and PlayStation four. So some games don't need to be celebrated. I'm just saying,

01:52:46.140 --> 01:52:51.100
uh, observer, um, which is actually, I think a pretty good game from what I hear that's on

01:52:51.100 --> 01:52:59.500
PC places for an Xbox one Sonic mania on the Nintendo switch PlayStation four and Xbox one.

01:52:59.500 --> 01:53:08.220
Thank you. And final, let's see, we have a sudden strike four on PlayStation four and finally the

01:53:08.220 --> 01:53:14.700
pillars of earth book one from the ashes on PC, Mac and Linux PlayStation four and Xbox one,

01:53:15.580 --> 01:53:20.140
but Sonic mania this week on consoles and which game? That's pretty good. Why not?

01:53:20.140 --> 01:53:23.980
So I just have to quit. I will get to the Japanese releases, but I do have to just acknowledge the

01:53:23.980 --> 01:53:28.940
reason why Loki said thank you there in the middle of releases. Alan being the nice boy that he is,

01:53:28.940 --> 01:53:33.340
he just brought us all Starbucks, all of us. So I thought it was very nice to him to run that.

01:53:33.340 --> 01:53:37.980
Thank you very much. Thank you, Alan. So, all right, Alan's keeping the show running

01:53:37.980 --> 01:53:42.460
behind the scenes. Let's go to Japan and check out the releases over there. So coming out in

01:53:42.460 --> 01:53:46.620
Japan on the 17th on the PlayStation four, Sonic mania is also being released in Japan.

01:53:47.260 --> 01:53:53.100
Dragon quest 10, the all-in-one package also coming out. Dragon's dogma online season three,

01:53:53.660 --> 01:53:57.980
some type of limited edition package is out from Capcom this week on the PlayStation four.

01:53:57.980 --> 01:54:04.620
And, um, let's see, zero escape Toki no dilemma. Also out in Japan this week, uh, checking the

01:54:04.620 --> 01:54:07.980
PlayStation Vita, believe it or not. I don't think there's anything this week on the Vita.

01:54:07.980 --> 01:54:12.620
Those releases don't pick up again until the 24th. So nothing to look forward to this week

01:54:12.620 --> 01:54:19.980
on the Vita. Uh, actually, well, believe it or not in Japan, there's still basically the space

01:54:19.980 --> 01:54:25.260
that you would have dedicated to the Xbox one here is dedicated to the, I only say that out of

01:54:25.260 --> 01:54:30.620
sadness because I wish they would release a new Sony system that was actually comparable to like

01:54:30.620 --> 01:54:35.180
a switch or something. I understand. I understand. Uh, so really outside of that, nothing on 3DS or

01:54:35.180 --> 01:54:39.900
switch either. So it's a somewhat of a slower week, a little bit in Japan, although there is

01:54:39.900 --> 01:54:44.700
a dragon quest release, but then again, it's kind of a repackaging, so it's not as big a deal,

01:54:44.700 --> 01:54:50.700
but anyhow, how about the UK dark soccer in the UK? We've got a few things. Actually,

01:54:50.700 --> 01:54:57.420
it's kind of a busy week on the 15th night trap, blah, blah. On the 16th, we have bound for

01:54:57.420 --> 01:55:05.500
PlayStation four and Conan exiles for the Xbox one. On the 17th, we have, I'm going to Zlatan

01:55:05.500 --> 01:55:15.020
legends for iOS. On the 18th, we have agents of mayhem for PS4, Xbox one and PC and thumper for

01:55:15.020 --> 01:55:23.420
Xbox one X and Xbox one. Okay. Thumper. Yeah. The Xbox one X isn't even out yet. So I don't know

01:55:23.420 --> 01:55:28.460
whether it says Xbox one X. I'm like, that's weird. That's weird that that site has it. But

01:55:28.700 --> 01:55:35.260
thumper is that cool music game that is, it's kind of hard. Yeah. Yeah. But it's, it's, it's

01:55:35.260 --> 01:55:39.900
probably most well known in its PlayStation VR form, but it is on the switch as well. So

01:55:39.900 --> 01:55:46.780
it's a hard game. It's a very hard game, but it's fun. I like it. There's like the music,

01:55:46.780 --> 01:55:50.060
it's like industrial music and it's not like commercial stuff. It's all like,

01:55:50.620 --> 01:55:56.380
you know, it's noise. It's a very noisy game. It's good. Like experimental. Yeah. Kinda.

01:55:57.100 --> 01:56:01.660
All right. Uh, as mentioned, we didn't get any emails this week, sad face or the past three

01:56:01.660 --> 01:56:07.260
weeks in fact. Uh, but to be fair because of the hiatus, maybe you guys kind of just figured,

01:56:07.260 --> 01:56:10.540
you know, we weren't taking them for a little while, but let me just remind you all the email

01:56:10.540 --> 01:56:15.020
bag is open once again. So please feel free to send your emails, participate at orange

01:56:15.020 --> 01:56:19.420
lounge radio.com. If you want to participate with the mailbag segment. So yeah, emails open once

01:56:19.420 --> 01:56:23.340
again, participate at orange launch radio.com. In the meantime, just a few more stories for you

01:56:23.340 --> 01:56:27.180
guys. Then we'll get to the Skype line and other way for you to participate at orange lounge radio

01:56:27.180 --> 01:56:34.540
on Skype, Loki. So, um, this is kind of cool that they're actually considering e-sports as becoming

01:56:34.540 --> 01:56:42.620
part of the 2024 Olympic games. Apparently they are, um, considering it along with, with, um,

01:56:42.620 --> 01:56:46.860
you know, including it with new events because they kind of do this each route. Like when they

01:56:46.860 --> 01:56:52.140
have a new games coming out, they'll add new events. So in fact, they, I think one of the

01:56:52.140 --> 01:56:56.060
upcoming summer games, I think has like a skateboarding or something in there now. Oh,

01:56:56.060 --> 01:57:01.100
wow. Something different. But, um, they're adding new stuff all the time. And one of the

01:57:01.100 --> 01:57:06.540
reasons that they're considering this even more is because you may not realize, um, at least I don't,

01:57:06.540 --> 01:57:11.580
um, that aside from the Olympics, there's also the Asian games as well. And that actually isn't

01:57:11.580 --> 01:57:17.340
being included in the Asian games. E-sports is part of the 2022 Asian games and the 2018 Asian

01:57:17.340 --> 01:57:21.980
games in Indonesia. So that's something that's kind of cool that this is actually being,

01:57:22.940 --> 01:57:29.260
you know, adapted in these major, you know, I remember 10 years ago when we were focused

01:57:29.260 --> 01:57:34.620
more on music based games and we kept having that whole is DDR a sport. Remember that that was

01:57:35.180 --> 01:57:39.420
like, it may be one of the Scandinavian countries did make it a sport. I remember that was a big

01:57:39.420 --> 01:57:43.660
thing we talked about for awhile and, uh, we kind of talked about, wouldn't it be funny if

01:57:43.660 --> 01:57:47.180
DDR was in the Olympics and we kind of laughed it off that it's never going to happen, but

01:57:47.180 --> 01:57:53.660
here we are now the landscapes changed. E-sports is growing very, very big. Um,

01:57:53.660 --> 01:57:58.620
not just with things like star craft and things like, you know, Dota, but now we see

01:57:58.620 --> 01:58:03.580
Overwatch and the Overwatch league. I mean, that, you know, is looking more and more like they're

01:58:03.580 --> 01:58:08.220
trying to do like a, I don't know if I would call it the NFL, maybe more like the XFL.

01:58:08.780 --> 01:58:14.700
Anyone remember the XFL? Um, but I, but still I'm still curious really to see where that goes.

01:58:14.700 --> 01:58:19.580
Uh, it looks very exciting. And then, so yeah, it seems like with E-sports taking off as it is

01:58:19.580 --> 01:58:23.740
this, I mean, 10 years ago I would have said, Oh, come on, this is never going to, the Olympics

01:58:23.740 --> 01:58:26.220
is never going to take this seriously. Kind of like the thing is they're like,

01:58:26.220 --> 01:58:31.820
they're trying to understand, you know, is it a sport? You know, it's still like,

01:58:31.820 --> 01:58:36.220
kind of how do we measure it? How do you define a sport? I mean, a lot of, you know,

01:58:36.220 --> 01:58:41.420
the Olympics, you think, you know, physical sport and stuff, whereas, but isn't chess in the

01:58:41.420 --> 01:58:47.260
Olympics and that's not a physical sport. That's more of a mental sport. So there is mental sports.

01:58:47.260 --> 01:58:52.460
Yeah. I mean, there, there is a lot of that in there. I mean, creativity and stuff with even like

01:58:52.460 --> 01:58:56.700
some of the, you know, the gymnastics routines. I mean, still, I'm not going to argue that that's

01:58:56.700 --> 01:59:01.260
not physical, but there's a lot of like, you know, designing and creativity and stuff to that,

01:59:01.260 --> 01:59:07.740
that your routines and stuff. So maybe with that strategy and this critical thinking and, you know,

01:59:07.740 --> 01:59:13.100
quick reflexes that could tie in with this stuff. I think by the time we get there, you know,

01:59:13.100 --> 01:59:17.180
especially when you consider that, you know, everybody growing up with gaming and stuff

01:59:17.180 --> 01:59:21.660
by that time, I mean, that's, you know, a few years away, still seven years away, by the way,

01:59:21.660 --> 01:59:26.860
I mean, yeah, that could be more accepted by then. Yeah. It's gonna be very interesting to see how

01:59:26.860 --> 01:59:32.140
that plays out. And finally, after all these years, the Olympics is coming back to the States

01:59:32.140 --> 01:59:39.020
officially in 2028. Uh, and that's the first time the summer game, LA, LA, they did this

01:59:39.020 --> 01:59:44.060
weird thing that they don't usually do, but they kind of co-awarded Olympic games to Paris and LA

01:59:44.060 --> 01:59:48.860
at the same time, basically, I think LA still has some dotted lines to sign off on and so forth,

01:59:48.860 --> 01:59:52.860
but it looking very certain that LA is going to have the 2028 games, which, you know, they

01:59:52.860 --> 01:59:59.740
hosted in 84. Um, but otherwise the United States has not hosted an Olympic games, a summer games

01:59:59.820 --> 02:00:05.820
since Atlanta in 96. That was a long time ago. Um, they did do a winter games in Salt Lake City,

02:00:05.820 --> 02:00:10.380
I think was the last one in 2002, if I remember right. But even then, you know, that's still,

02:00:10.380 --> 02:00:16.060
still going to be like over 20 years, uh, without the States hosting. So, um, the only reason,

02:00:16.060 --> 02:00:19.900
only reason I bring that up is because, you know, esports, if it does well in Paris,

02:00:19.900 --> 02:00:25.580
could be a big part of the LA games. Um, and you know, at the end of the day, the Olympics is

02:00:25.580 --> 02:00:31.740
a business. It needs to make money. And some, there, there is some, sometimes some not so

02:00:31.740 --> 02:00:35.100
great news about the Olympics out there and some money, some cities that have lost.

02:00:35.100 --> 02:00:37.260
Well, I got to wonder too, like with the Olympics, like,

02:00:38.220 --> 02:00:42.380
maybe they're not drawing the same audiences that they used to anymore. Like they're,

02:00:43.020 --> 02:00:47.740
you know, losing out in certain demographics. And so they're trying to get that younger

02:00:47.740 --> 02:00:52.060
demographic. I think so. And I think one of the biggest mistakes that they've been making is

02:00:52.060 --> 02:00:59.260
specifically NBC here in the States with the tape delay of the games that are happening in Rio.

02:00:59.260 --> 02:01:04.380
And when we live in an internet day and age where all that stuff is instant, like, um, you know,

02:01:04.380 --> 02:01:10.860
NBC, I think is really going to have to adapt their way of thinking for Tokyo in 2020. Um,

02:01:10.860 --> 02:01:14.140
or they're going to just hemorrhage even more people because of the internet and,

02:01:14.140 --> 02:01:18.860
and other ways that people can get this information. So, um, you know, I think,

02:01:18.940 --> 02:01:23.260
I think they kind of have to figure that out, but you know, at the end of the day, yeah,

02:01:23.260 --> 02:01:28.540
it is a business, but it's also, it's a huge part of TV. So if you think about it,

02:01:28.540 --> 02:01:37.100
if e-sports ends up a part of the 2024 games, we could see e-sports on a major broadcast network,

02:01:37.100 --> 02:01:43.580
NBC by 2024. There's something to think about the same network that shows Monday night football,

02:01:43.580 --> 02:01:48.780
right? Does NBC show that or does that, does NBC still show football? Is that all Fox now?

02:01:49.500 --> 02:01:55.420
I don't know. But anyway, you get the drift, the same family of, of networks that shows Monday

02:01:55.420 --> 02:02:01.180
night football could show speaking of things that are on TV. That's kind of unusual like that. Um,

02:02:01.180 --> 02:02:08.780
one of the things is I mentioned covers a tangent ESPN actually did the ESPN eight, the Ocho.

02:02:08.780 --> 02:02:14.700
I heard about like, was it like a certain amount of eight? Yeah. So they did that for August 8th

02:02:14.700 --> 02:02:21.900
and that sounds awesome. They, they replayed the, um, uh, uh, fighting game stuff. Evo,

02:02:21.900 --> 02:02:26.220
they replayed Evo during that was part of the block. Yeah. So it was kind of neat.

02:02:27.260 --> 02:02:31.180
All right. Anyhow, a little bit of a tangent, but we've had some of those tonight.

02:02:31.180 --> 02:02:36.620
Uh, let's see, let's get to another story about Capcom and, uh, oh, they're not happy about

02:02:36.620 --> 02:02:42.540
street fighter costume mods. Uh, that's because there were some street fighter nude mod creators.

02:02:43.500 --> 02:02:46.220
Well, now I can't believe Capcom would take issue to this.

02:02:47.740 --> 02:02:53.980
Say what? Anyway, so these two modders, uh, brutal ACE and Cal Dentar six, six, six. I hope I said

02:02:53.980 --> 02:03:00.300
that right. They had Patrion pages that solicited donations from fans. So I guess they weren't

02:03:00.300 --> 02:03:05.820
charging for the mods per se, but it was one of those. If you like these titties, subscribe to my

02:03:05.900 --> 02:03:10.380
Patrion basically. Well, the mom likes these titties. You give me those biddies.

02:03:13.260 --> 02:03:17.500
I'm going to put that, I'm going to put that on my Twitch channel. You like these titties,

02:03:17.500 --> 02:03:21.580
give me them biddies. Except you're not supposed to solicit that stuff on Twitch, but anyway,

02:03:21.580 --> 02:03:25.500
it's all in fun and you've been banned. All right. And I've been banned from Twitch. Oh,

02:03:25.500 --> 02:03:30.700
all right. Uh, so anyway, uh, one of the mods, so brutal ACE had a Chun Li mod, but in a wonder

02:03:30.700 --> 02:03:38.620
woman costume and let's see, uh, Cal Dentar had a Kami mod in 2B's costume from Nier Automata.

02:03:38.620 --> 02:03:44.140
So obviously there's copyright violations going on all over the place. But, uh, of course these

02:03:44.140 --> 02:03:50.380
same modders made naked female fighters or female fighters in string bikinis. Uh, there's also

02:03:50.380 --> 02:03:56.940
risque mods, such as barefoot mods and breast jiggling mods. Oh my God. They didn't have shoes.

02:03:56.940 --> 02:04:03.580
They were barefoot. How risque, but nothing for men. Go figure. Nothing for the male fighters.

02:04:03.580 --> 02:04:08.460
I think that there are, but it's just, you know, but not these guys mention it. None of these guys.

02:04:08.460 --> 02:04:13.740
So anyhow, the Patreon page for Cal Dentar 6, 6, 6 was deleted along with all the records of

02:04:13.740 --> 02:04:19.500
the earnings, uh, and so forth. So, um, let's see brutal ACE says he always offered his mod,

02:04:19.500 --> 02:04:25.420
it's free downloads, but the Patreon supporters did get one week of advanced exclusive access

02:04:25.420 --> 02:04:31.820
to all new mods. So this creates a whole big issue, uh, between Patreon and so forth. So,

02:04:31.820 --> 02:04:35.980
you know, if you're going to ask for people's money on Patreon, make sure what you're doing is

02:04:35.980 --> 02:04:42.380
legal. I honestly don't think that they had, they could do this to his Patreon page, honestly,

02:04:42.380 --> 02:04:47.980
cause I get their thought process. Their thought process is he charging for mods for our game and

02:04:47.980 --> 02:04:55.580
we don't like that. Honestly though, modding your game is fair use. So kind of fuck off.

02:04:56.380 --> 02:05:00.860
Well, but if you're putting up a Patreon page and the centerpiece of that Patreon page is

02:05:00.860 --> 02:05:05.820
I will deliver you nude mods early. If you give me money, it's kind of walking that line there.

02:05:05.820 --> 02:05:10.540
I think this game been out, there's nude bonds already. There's been new mods since like the

02:05:10.540 --> 02:05:15.660
game came five minutes before the five minutes after it was out. I mean, come on. Like that's

02:05:15.740 --> 02:05:20.860
stupid. Oh, and, and, Oh yes. Now that you've taken down his page, Oh, I'm sure that the

02:05:20.860 --> 02:05:25.500
new mods will never ever come out. Oh wait, they've already been out. It's done nothing.

02:05:26.300 --> 02:05:30.620
Uh, dungeon buster and chat jokes, street fighter five dead or alive. You know, you joke,

02:05:30.620 --> 02:05:36.140
but now that you bring that up, speaking of the whole like man mods, I have to say I was, I was,

02:05:36.140 --> 02:05:40.540
um, I was pleasantly surprised. I was looking in the PlayStation store for the new releases

02:05:40.540 --> 02:05:45.100
and what is it? Dead or alive five final round or last round. I'm sorry. I forget the name of the

02:05:45.100 --> 02:05:51.580
game, but they released some new DLC and of course it is the usual lots of ladies and very

02:05:51.580 --> 02:05:56.140
skimpy types of bathing suits and so forth. What you would expect. However, to our soccer, I don't

02:05:56.140 --> 02:06:03.580
know if you saw this, there were also some men in speedos as part of this. So I was like, okay,

02:06:03.580 --> 02:06:10.540
it was, it was nice. It was nice. So, uh, quality was the Overwatch. Of course there's like two

02:06:10.540 --> 02:06:17.420
dudes in speedos and like summer DLC. Oh yeah. The Overwatch with the McCree who I've never really

02:06:17.420 --> 02:06:22.300
paid attention to before. Yes. Yes. I did notice that. Yes I did. Yes I did. I sure did. Anyway.

02:06:23.420 --> 02:06:28.940
All right. I posted about that on Twitter. Look, and look, I don't even, you know, I don't,

02:06:28.940 --> 02:06:34.060
wherever you guys fall on the, if you, whatever gender you're into or not into or so forth,

02:06:34.060 --> 02:06:40.220
you have to go, okay. It's, it's nice to have the same for everybody that folks can have whatever

02:06:40.220 --> 02:06:45.340
they like. So, all right. Anyway, uh, moving on, let's get to something. Let's get to something

02:06:45.340 --> 02:06:49.660
a little more, uh, a little more retro, a little more classy in gaming. Shall we DarkSaga? What

02:06:49.660 --> 02:06:53.900
do you have for us? Are we having the classy game of the week? Yes. The classy game of the week.

02:06:54.940 --> 02:07:04.060
Well, all right. We have talked about this game in various iterations and there is going to be

02:07:04.060 --> 02:07:12.140
a Tempest 4000 because they're really freaking creative. Yes. Actually, it's funny when we pick

02:07:12.140 --> 02:07:20.220
up the cat with Midna, we go, got you. These guys are nerds. It's become a joke in my house.

02:07:21.660 --> 02:07:30.300
But anyway, it is being developed by Jeff Minter and it is, yeah, going to be the continuation in

02:07:30.300 --> 02:07:39.340
Tempest 2000 and Tempest 3000, which I think was, uh, not even a fully released game. It was like

02:07:39.340 --> 02:07:44.060
prototype. How do you remember Tempest? I remember hearing of a Tempest 3000, but I don't remember.

02:07:44.060 --> 02:07:52.460
I played it in an Atari party. Okay. Like a while back. But, um, basically you, uh, play the claw

02:07:52.460 --> 02:07:59.420
again and you have to shoot stuff and super zapper recharge. So will this be coming out on

02:07:59.420 --> 02:08:06.140
Atari's new system? Since we know the Atari box is coming. Wouldn't Tempest 4000 be a great, after

02:08:06.140 --> 02:08:12.060
all, Tempest 2000 was like the fucking reason to own a Jaguar. Why not? The only reason to own a Jaguar.

02:08:13.260 --> 02:08:19.180
Um, it looks like it is going to be coming out for PC and consoles later on in 2017.

02:08:19.180 --> 02:08:26.620
This year, really? Yeah. That's awesome. I'm excited. I like this article. Okay. This article is great

02:08:26.620 --> 02:08:33.580
because, okay, it says we don't have any assets of Tempest 4000. So instead here's a picture of

02:08:33.580 --> 02:08:39.740
a llama and it's a picture of a llama sitting down in the grass. I love this article, Eurogamer.

02:08:39.740 --> 02:08:45.260
Oh, Eurogamer. I love Eurogamer. It's a good site. But just, I just had to say, why is there,

02:08:45.260 --> 02:08:50.140
oh, that's why there's a llama. Super llama recharge. Well, didn't they also, wasn't,

02:08:50.140 --> 02:08:54.940
wasn't it like llama soft or something? Wasn't it llamas played into it somehow as well? Because

02:08:54.940 --> 02:09:01.660
then they had space giraffe was kind of like that side game. Anyway. All right. A few more

02:09:01.660 --> 02:09:08.380
stories for you guys before we open up the Skype line. Loki. So valve, um, announced during the

02:09:08.380 --> 02:09:16.460
whole international, um, seven match in Seattle that there's a new Dota game coming. Oh my God.

02:09:16.460 --> 02:09:23.100
Valves putting out a new game. Yes. It's Dota artifact. It's a card game.

02:09:24.780 --> 02:09:28.860
I liked, can you say that again? Half life. Just kidding. It's a card game.

02:09:33.260 --> 02:09:38.380
Yes. The, the, the art of artifact, the, the, the Dota card game that's going to be

02:09:38.380 --> 02:09:44.060
coming out in 2018. All right. Well, there's people out, you know what?

02:09:44.060 --> 02:09:47.580
And for the people that like trading, it's like they have the, like, we have a new

02:09:47.580 --> 02:09:56.860
announcement for you and everyone's like, how fast the crowd will turn on you. Hey, look, no,

02:09:56.860 --> 02:09:59.980
there's people that are really into trading card games are gonna be super thrilled about it. I

02:09:59.980 --> 02:10:03.260
don't have a problem with them making a trading card game. It's just everybody else is wanting

02:10:03.260 --> 02:10:07.820
to make a third of something. Yes. Maybe this was not the best place to announce it, even though

02:10:07.820 --> 02:10:13.660
it is a Dota kind of game. Who knows? All right. It's like valve, just put three next to something,

02:10:13.660 --> 02:10:18.700
please. One more story. And it has to do with a classic game. And this is something,

02:10:18.700 --> 02:10:25.820
something brand new unearthed in a classic game. And that classic game is Super Mario Brothers 2,

02:10:25.820 --> 02:10:31.340
the US version, which was Doki Doki Panic, of course, over on the Famicom. So it was unearthed

02:10:31.340 --> 02:10:37.260
this week that in the original manual for Doki Doki Panic on the Famicom disk system,

02:10:37.260 --> 02:10:42.460
there was a gray shy guy that was supposed to be there. If you, if you're not, I remember this.

02:10:42.460 --> 02:10:46.700
Yeah, there was supposed to be a gray shy guy in the game. Oh, he's a shiny. Yes, he, that's

02:10:46.700 --> 02:10:51.340
right. He's a shiny shy guy. Exactly. And what makes him special is that he would actually

02:10:51.340 --> 02:10:56.060
follow you around. But the character actually never showed up in the game, even though it's

02:10:56.060 --> 02:11:04.860
on the manual. Well, get this, somebody was able to use a code on Game Genie to get the character

02:11:04.860 --> 02:11:10.060
back in the game. And that's right. There is a, it's an actual Game Genie code you can put

02:11:10.060 --> 02:11:14.780
together and use on a cartridge. And you'll have to look this up on, on some of the different blogs,

02:11:14.780 --> 02:11:18.700
like Destructoid or, or different codes of paint on the version of the game you have. Yeah. Cause

02:11:18.700 --> 02:11:22.460
I'm not going to read the code, but yeah, you can put the code in the game and sure enough,

02:11:22.460 --> 02:11:27.340
you will get a gray shy guy in the first level. And the thing is the shy guy will start to follow

02:11:27.340 --> 02:11:31.100
you. Like he does the whole walking forward, but most shy guys in the game just ignore you,

02:11:31.100 --> 02:11:34.940
jump over them and you're, that's it. But this shy guy, once you jump, if you ride him,

02:11:34.940 --> 02:11:41.580
the universe, universes, why we always got to go to the gutter here on this show.

02:11:41.580 --> 02:11:47.500
Oh no. I mean, you can stand on the enemy. I'm not trying to be in the gutter. You know what

02:11:47.500 --> 02:11:51.660
you mean? If I was trying to do that, I would say like, Oh, what happens if you fuck him? You know,

02:11:53.420 --> 02:11:59.180
well, somebody on Reddit's working on that, but um, no, I, I, I don't know because in this video,

02:11:59.180 --> 02:12:03.420
they don't try that. So you'll have to go get a copy of the game and probably just walks back

02:12:03.420 --> 02:12:07.340
and forth because he probably does. He probably just stands in place or continues off my fucking

02:12:07.340 --> 02:12:16.780
head. You hurt. You're so big. I can't, my, my skeletal structure. Can I handle this?

02:12:17.340 --> 02:12:20.380
Tiger quad chat says, no wonder they call them shy guys.

02:12:24.380 --> 02:12:27.980
And on that note, we're going to open up the Skype line, orange lounge radio,

02:12:27.980 --> 02:12:32.780
all one word on Skype. Uh, if you'd like to give us a call and talk about shy guys or anything

02:12:32.860 --> 02:12:37.180
that is on your mind tonight, uh, maybe that we did cover in the news or maybe that we didn't

02:12:37.180 --> 02:12:41.740
get to. So I will, uh, I will open up that Skype line now and how about that calls are already

02:12:41.740 --> 02:12:46.700
coming in. So let's get to it higher on orange launch radio. Who's this? Hey, what's going on?

02:12:46.700 --> 02:12:51.500
It's Rama. Hey Rama. Good to have you here. What's up? Not much. I'm just, I just finished

02:12:51.500 --> 02:12:56.700
my eight hour trek back from Otacon in DC. So yeah, I've been seeing your Facebook updates

02:12:56.700 --> 02:13:02.540
from Otacon. How was it? It was amazing. Nice. I'm glad you had a good time. Thank you.

02:13:03.260 --> 02:13:06.220
What kind of like video game stuff do they have there? They have a gaming room or

02:13:07.820 --> 02:13:11.820
I'm going to say this really quickly. Dan, I'm going to tell you why I called it.

02:13:11.820 --> 02:13:17.660
The game room was huge, old school gaming. Plus there was many land tournament set up.

02:13:18.540 --> 02:13:23.260
It was a few DDR arcade machines. It was a couple of dance machines and a whole

02:13:23.260 --> 02:13:27.660
bunch of ju beat machines. And I will say this, it didn't stink.

02:13:28.540 --> 02:13:34.540
Oh, people were, were applying their deodorant and, uh, taking showers daily. That's great.

02:13:35.740 --> 02:13:41.500
Let's just hope that they did. When I walked to the game room, there was no smell. It was

02:13:41.500 --> 02:13:48.700
a well ventilated space then maybe. All right. So why did you call? Because I was listening to

02:13:48.700 --> 02:13:53.580
y'all on the way home and you were talking about the Nintendo world championships. And I remember

02:13:53.580 --> 02:13:58.220
those, which in turn, for some reason, it reminded me of, while I was leaving

02:13:58.220 --> 02:14:02.940
the dealer's room earlier, they had a little setup, one to boost. Um, they had a very

02:14:02.940 --> 02:14:10.300
interesting VR game. It was, I, I looked at it like, how does sex your waifu? Cause that's

02:14:10.300 --> 02:14:15.260
pretty much what it was. You had this little, it's important information.

02:14:17.020 --> 02:14:23.020
Had this little blow up doll looking thing. You had the VR glasses on and there were people

02:14:23.100 --> 02:14:26.220
watching this guy, I guess pretty much screwed his school girl.

02:14:26.220 --> 02:14:30.300
Were there sensors on the doll? Did you have to dry hump the doll? Because that's awesome.

02:14:30.300 --> 02:14:32.300
I don't know about telling you this, there was no sensors.

02:14:34.540 --> 02:14:39.500
But, um, then I got that out the way. I don't know why that reminded me of it. I don't,

02:14:39.500 --> 02:14:44.620
maybe because gaming tour, I don't know. Yes. Why did how to screw your waifu make you think,

02:14:44.620 --> 02:14:51.260
God, I need to call OLR. Do you understand how much booze has been in my system since Thursday?

02:14:51.980 --> 02:14:58.620
Fair enough. But, um, I remember the Nintendo world championships and I wanted to go,

02:14:58.620 --> 02:15:04.380
but I couldn't. I remember the blockbuster, uh, gaming competitions. And one of my friends went,

02:15:04.380 --> 02:15:08.060
cause he scored the highest in the areas. I went with him down the South street seaport

02:15:08.060 --> 02:15:14.860
where he did NBA jam. But the thing is they threw him on the Genesis version. So it was a little

02:15:14.860 --> 02:15:21.180
bit harder for him to play, but he used two hands whereas he was using his fingers to control the

02:15:21.180 --> 02:15:25.980
game instead of his thumbs. That would suck though. That if you're used to one version

02:15:25.980 --> 02:15:29.900
of the game and they throw you another, like they weren't the same back then. That's not,

02:15:29.900 --> 02:15:35.740
it's not the same. I know the timing and the frames and all that stuff was different. So that's,

02:15:36.300 --> 02:15:40.220
that's kind of crappy, but you know, but still kind of awesome that you got to do that. Yeah.

02:15:40.220 --> 02:15:43.820
I have a lot of friends that did the world championships. I didn't really get to do any

02:15:43.820 --> 02:15:47.500
of that. I don't know. I don't, I don't think they really had them. I mean, they might've done the

02:15:47.500 --> 02:15:52.060
blockbuster thing here in Sacramento, but, but we never really went to blockbuster ever. We had like

02:15:52.060 --> 02:15:57.020
indie stores that we usually always went to. And then the world championships, I highly doubt

02:15:57.020 --> 02:16:01.020
wherever here. And it was just the kind of thing where it's like my, my parents really weren't

02:16:01.020 --> 02:16:08.380
interested in taking me to San Francisco or anything like that. So. Well, I got lucky because

02:16:08.380 --> 02:16:13.900
I don't know if you remember, there was one tournament that they had that I had an amazing

02:16:13.900 --> 02:16:20.140
time at. Do you remember the superstar Fox weekend? I do remember that I do. Cause those

02:16:20.140 --> 02:16:26.620
cartridges are super rare. If you can find them. I know. And if you went, I believe if you ended

02:16:26.620 --> 02:16:32.140
up with the highest score that day, you got a t-shirt. I went to two locations and got two

02:16:32.140 --> 02:16:38.780
shirts. Good job. That's awesome. But unfortunately someone outscored me in both places for the entire

02:16:38.780 --> 02:16:43.340
weekend. So that's all right. They can make that modern now. It's like, I went to pre-order an

02:16:43.340 --> 02:16:48.860
essay in the S classic, but all I got was the shirt. I wanted to play star Fox too,

02:16:48.860 --> 02:16:55.740
but all I got was disappointment and resentment. I am disappointed. I'll just wait for the Rama

02:16:55.740 --> 02:17:00.620
leak. Yeah, I know how like immediately immediate, immediate. All right. Well, Rama, I'm glad to hear

02:17:00.620 --> 02:17:05.100
you had a good time at Otacon and I'm getting really excited about a dragon con I'm hearing

02:17:05.100 --> 02:17:08.780
from what I believe I was reading. I heard that Tokyo attack is going to be back at dragon con

02:17:08.780 --> 02:17:12.620
and that their, their space is increasing this year. So it's going to be more of it. So I'm

02:17:12.620 --> 02:17:17.100
really excited. That sounds pretty awesome. So, you know where to find me at dragon con

02:17:17.100 --> 02:17:23.580
when I'm not in a panel. Yep. In the game room. What about, what about what, what,

02:17:23.580 --> 02:17:30.460
what a nice refreshing adult beverage, right? Correct. All right. Well, Rama, I'm going to

02:17:30.460 --> 02:17:34.620
let you go so we can take more calls. Awesome, man. Thanks a lot. Great to hear from you. Bye.

02:17:36.220 --> 02:17:40.780
All right. Orange lounge radio, all one word on Skype. If you want to get through, uh,

02:17:40.780 --> 02:17:44.780
going to chat over at live.vognetware.com, message 100 Matt says Tokyo attack won't be back

02:17:44.780 --> 02:17:49.660
at mad. Won't be at magfest sadly. Yeah, I heard about that. I was concerned about that. Um, you

02:17:49.660 --> 02:17:53.500
know, I'm sure they have some type of other plan they're going to do and it's going to be different,

02:17:53.500 --> 02:17:58.940
but if these other shows are happening over the country, all over the country, like, you know, the

02:17:58.940 --> 02:18:02.860
California extreme and the Southern fried game room, I'm sure in the DC area, they're going to

02:18:02.860 --> 02:18:06.780
figure out how to do it just fine. Uh, it'll just be different. It probably would just won't have

02:18:06.780 --> 02:18:11.980
the focus on the, um, Japanese games, uh, that it has in the past, but it'll probably have plenty

02:18:11.980 --> 02:18:18.700
of old school games and pinball and all that other stuff. So that'll be cool. Um, hit stun and chat

02:18:18.700 --> 02:18:22.860
suggests a snow Phoenix. I've not heard of snow Phoenix. That must be a new company. Somebody

02:18:22.860 --> 02:18:27.020
starts sending snow Phoenix to these big cons. They have a lot of Tokyo tax games. I was not aware.

02:18:27.020 --> 02:18:32.540
So I guess these, I guess these con arcade companies are, uh, uh, grow in business,

02:18:32.540 --> 02:18:38.460
but it does, it seems like there's more cons now than there were years ago when we first started

02:18:38.460 --> 02:18:43.980
the show. I just mean like local stuff. Like it seems like there's some little con in Sacramento,

02:18:43.980 --> 02:18:49.980
like every weekend. So that's kind of neat. So, all right. Uh, orange lounge radio, all one word

02:18:49.980 --> 02:18:54.060
on Skype. Again, if you want to give us a call, let me check in quickly while we do this last,

02:18:54.060 --> 02:18:57.820
uh, wait for calls here and see, uh, with Loki, if there's any last minute stories on, if you have

02:18:57.820 --> 02:19:03.900
anything tonight, um, no, just like silly Twitch stuff. There's someone dude, um, that goes by the

02:19:03.900 --> 02:19:12.300
name, a twerking Yoshi that's playing bloodborne, um, using a game or dance pad. Why not? Cause you

02:19:12.300 --> 02:19:16.700
know, that's the thing. Why not? Sure. Why not? How do we, how did he hook up the dance pad to a

02:19:16.700 --> 02:19:23.500
PlayStation three or four? Um, they have, I don't know, there's ways to do that kind of stuff, but

02:19:23.500 --> 02:19:30.620
like they had, it shows like how they have the buttons maps. So they've got, um, I guess attack

02:19:31.740 --> 02:19:36.460
can you only move to one direction? That's weird. They've got like a Dodge on the X button.

02:19:36.460 --> 02:19:44.540
There's L one on the triangle are three lock on, on the square and L two on start and select

02:19:44.540 --> 02:19:49.180
his potion. Well, you can remap all the buttons within the PlayStation four operating. And

02:19:49.180 --> 02:19:55.900
apparently, um, right is attack. So he can only move left up and down. So interesting.

02:19:55.900 --> 02:19:59.180
I don't know. I guess that's the thing. Uh, as Joe and Hunter, Matt and Chad says,

02:19:59.180 --> 02:20:05.340
I remember having a party where we played mortal combat with DDR pads. Good times. Was it, was there

02:20:05.340 --> 02:20:09.740
any, um, Jamie, I'm trying to think way back to the parties that used to happen at your house with

02:20:09.740 --> 02:20:13.660
like your dream cast dance pads. Were there any other games that were played with dance pads

02:20:13.660 --> 02:20:19.100
besides DDR? I thought there was something. Um, and not the jungle book doesn't count.

02:20:19.100 --> 02:20:25.420
Soul caliber. Soul caliber. Yes. Because we found that the Konami logo is an analog pad.

02:20:27.260 --> 02:20:31.900
And so we would play, um, we would try to play soul caliber with the dance pad. Yeah.

02:20:31.900 --> 02:20:39.740
On a dance pad on the dance pad, on the dream cast dance pad. Oh, so weird. Yeah. Super weird.

02:20:39.740 --> 02:20:45.740
Yeah. But anyway, um, I think that's what else we've ever used the dream cast dance pads for,

02:20:45.740 --> 02:20:53.260
but rod caliber was your rod caliber was great because it is literally just moving the fishing

02:20:53.260 --> 02:21:00.700
rod and praying cause it would move them too. Yeah. So it's so crazy. Good times. All right.

02:21:00.700 --> 02:21:07.020
We got another call coming in, so let's get to it. Hi. Oh, it's all right. So it,

02:21:07.020 --> 02:21:10.540
as soon as I picked up the call, it went, Nope, just kidding. Disconnect. Let me see if that

02:21:10.540 --> 02:21:15.740
person calls back. Uh, meanwhile, I'll read some comments and chat, uh, hit stun and chat says,

02:21:15.740 --> 02:21:20.540
I played an arcade tech and five on a dance pad. Once it had PS two controller reports,

02:21:20.540 --> 02:21:24.460
uh, dark Tetsuya says, I bet you could do soul caliber. Yeah. It works with the keyboard too.

02:21:25.260 --> 02:21:31.020
Uh, and let's see as 200. Matt says, one of my friends managed to pull off a fatality on a dance

02:21:31.020 --> 02:21:36.300
pad. I forgot who's he pulled off. We've got to be somebody easy like a katana. I still remember to

02:21:36.300 --> 02:21:39.820
this day, block, block, block, block, block, block, block, high kick. It's just buttons.

02:21:39.820 --> 02:21:43.420
The ones that are buttons only and you don't even have to move your character are probably much

02:21:43.420 --> 02:21:48.620
easier to do, but yeah, that's, um, Katana's fatality. I can, I can still worry. Cause you

02:21:48.620 --> 02:21:52.060
just slammed the block button a bunch of times and they had high kick super easy to do. At least

02:21:52.060 --> 02:21:56.700
that's where we'll come at two important. Oh, as she went under, Matt says, uh, it was mortal

02:21:56.700 --> 02:22:03.020
combat one. That is what I do remember. Sonia's fatality was pretty easy in that game. Forward,

02:22:03.020 --> 02:22:07.980
forward, back, back block. I don't know how, how do I remember that? I don't know. Sub zero

02:22:07.980 --> 02:22:14.540
toward, down toward high punch or was a low punch one of the two. So, all right. Well, sadly, I

02:22:14.540 --> 02:22:18.380
don't think the, uh, calls are coming back in. So I'm going to go ahead and shut down the Skype line

02:22:18.380 --> 02:22:22.780
for tonight. Uh, and I think we're going to go ahead and start to wrap up tonight's show, but

02:22:22.780 --> 02:22:27.580
I do want to thank you guys again for being with our show tonight. Thank you for being back after

02:22:27.580 --> 02:22:31.180
we've been gone for a little bit. I really appreciate you guys being back here. If you

02:22:57.420 --> 02:23:02.860
we really, really appreciate, um, all of that. Um, that's really all I can think of for now.

02:23:02.860 --> 02:23:07.180
So I think it's time to go around and get everybody's final thought. Uh, Loki, I'll start

02:23:07.180 --> 02:23:13.420
with you. Your final thought tonight. Uh, my final thought is I, I am going to try to work on my

02:23:13.420 --> 02:23:19.020
games again. I ought to figure out what I want to work on. Basically. That's it. Whether I keep on

02:23:19.020 --> 02:23:23.660
working on what I started with the game jam or if I go back to one of my other projects.

02:23:24.540 --> 02:23:29.660
All right. Dark Sakura, your final thought tonight. I was reading about the silent Hill song.

02:23:30.380 --> 02:23:33.900
What's the silent Hill song from the revenge ending for silent Hill three. Oh,

02:23:33.900 --> 02:23:43.580
silent Hill. I remember that. Uh, and then my final thought tonight would just be, um,

02:23:43.580 --> 02:23:48.700
thank you for being here and, uh, it's, it's nice to be back. So thank you guys very much

02:23:48.700 --> 02:23:52.940
for everything. Uh, that's going to do it for another episode of orange lounge radio.
