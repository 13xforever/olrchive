00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,560
Hi, awkward intro tonight, sorry, but before we start, I want to address the unexpected

2
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,720
hiatus that the show went on for a couple of weeks.

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:15,140
This won't have anything to do with video games, so if you're looking for a video game

4
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:19,620
and food chat, fast forward until you hear the music.

5
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:24,400
If you've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio over the past few weeks, you've probably

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,800
heard me talk about several times that my mom had been in and out of the hospital, including

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:35,000
intensive care since February, really, when she had knee replacement surgery.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,980
I'm not going to overload you with the clinical details, but the diagnosis she ended up having

9
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:44,320
and the main thing that she was battling was a condition called myasthenia gravis, which

10
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,560
is a neurological condition that can cause droopy eyelids, trouble talking, and for most

11
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:54,560
people, and I want to emphasize this if you know anyone that has this, for most people,

12
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,280
this ends up being pretty manageable and you can have a pretty normal life.

13
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:03,500
But sometimes, and I think due to her age, this condition flares up in a crisis and this

14
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:08,580
means you can have extreme difficulty breathing to the point that you have to go on a ventilator

15
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,560
and that's why mom had been in the hospital for a few weeks.

16
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:16,960
She had a crisis, she started improving, meds caused another crisis, she started improving,

17
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:22,400
she had other issues, so it was just kind of a back and forth.

18
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,000
So a few days after the last episode we did, I got a phone call while at my day job that

19
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:32,200
the lung muscles weren't getting better and they were wanting to do a feeding tube so

20
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,340
that the lung muscles could recover.

21
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:38,040
Now you have to remember that mom had been battling this condition for weeks and weeks

22
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,320
on and off since February and when she heard she had to get a feeding tube, that was the

23
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,040
point where she said, I've had enough, she's not going to be kept alive by a tube and really

24
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:52,100
the doctors couldn't guarantee that it would fend off another crisis for much longer than

25
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,460
another couple weeks anyway.

26
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:59,020
So my mom said she was done, meaning done.

27
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:04,760
And I spent many hours at the hospital that week and on Friday afternoon she passed away

28
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:11,680
and my dad was there, both my siblings were there, so at least we had time to gather and

29
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,240
all be there.

30
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,460
So for those not on Twitter or listening to Bobby, this is why I've been away and why

31
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,700
the studio at the house has been dark.

32
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:23,760
As you can imagine, this didn't put me in a good space for a little while.

33
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,640
And I know that those that knew why we've been on hold, you understand and I thank you

34
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,120
for that, but I needed the time.

35
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,340
My mom in those final days, she stressed to us that we needed to get on with our lives,

36
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:40,160
but the reality is that that's a step that's going to take time.

37
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,680
This is something that I've heard from many of you who've been in a similar situation

38
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,060
going through a loss of this magnitude.

39
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:52,200
So I was really humbled to find out just how many people I knew had gone through something

40
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:58,140
like this and it's made me feel a lot less alone and I know the future is going to be

41
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:02,580
okay even if it's changed.

42
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:07,500
I know oftentimes we talk about the family that this regular Sunday night event has created

43
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,980
over the past 15 years and I mean it when I say you all have helped me with this and

44
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:17,980
this is why I want to be back here again tonight to keep this going.

45
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:22,040
My mom should be remembered as someone that loved kids tremendously and always advocated

46
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:27,620
for them from her lifelong career of raising two generations of kids, then becoming a preschool

47
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:31,580
teacher, then raising a third generation as a nanny.

48
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:35,640
But I know many of you didn't get to know that and will remember her from the few appearances

49
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,640
she had on this show.

50
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:42,400
She had a great sense of humor and I'm really grateful you guys got to hear that.

51
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,840
I could try and dedicate tonight's show to my mom but that wouldn't be genuine because

52
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,680
every show I've ever done has been influenced by mom.

53
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:55,360
From 15 years of this, Hoard House, Pokestop, guys on show reading it's fundamental, Understation

54
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,640
Live, Vanilla Sky, YouTube, Twitches, all of it.

55
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:04,860
Mom is always going to be there a little bit in everything that I do.

56
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,880
Tell the listeners about some good things I did.

57
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:11,520
Didn't it make you proud when Orange Lounge Radio was in the newspaper and on the local

58
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,520
news?

59
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,520
Uh huh.

60
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,520
Good.

61
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,520
Very.

62
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:19,200
She sounds so convinced.

63
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,240
Alright mom, I appreciate you calling.

64
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,760
I just wanted the listeners to see what my mom was really like.

65
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,760
So there you go.

66
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:29,760
Well, she's like, she's like a female rob.

67
00:04:41,520 --> 00:05:07,280
Hello my friends out there on the internet.

68
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,040
Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

69
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:18,960
It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight, August the 13th of 2017 with episode number 696

70
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:25,040
of our show dedicated to video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle here at Studio

71
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,120
N7 in lovely Sacramento, California.

72
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:36,080
Myself Rob Roberts or Skye at S-K-I-E on Twitter with my co-hosts, hello dark soccer or Jamie

73
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,080
Summers.

74
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,080
Hi.

75
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,080
Welcome back.

76
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,080
Thank you.

77
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:44,520
I know while we were on hiatus, you were doing some, I was calling it faux LR.

78
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,520
You like that?

79
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,200
You did some faux LR on your live stream.

80
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,200
How did that go?

81
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,200
It went alright.

82
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,200
Yeah.

83
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:55,640
Um, I decided to get some news and everything out of the way while I was trying to, uh,

84
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:59,360
get all my streaming stuff put together because I hadn't done any streaming in a while.

85
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,360
Sure.

86
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,160
And, uh, I think it went okay.

87
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,160
Yeah.

88
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,840
I did catch a little bit of it last week.

89
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,160
So and it looked like it was, you were playing everybody's gone to the rapture, which we

90
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,240
Start to finish.

91
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,240
What's that?

92
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,240
Start to finish.

93
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,240
Start to finish.

94
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,240
You play the whole thing in one sitting?

95
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,240
No, no.

96
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,240
Oh, I was gonna say.

97
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,240
I played it in like three settings.

98
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,240
Okay.

99
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,240
Still though.

100
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,080
Cause the whole thing, I was going to do Mass Effect Andromeda and my game wouldn't

101
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,080
load.

102
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,080
Oh no.

103
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,440
So I still haven't reinstalled it.

104
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,680
That just means how much I've been wanting to play Mass Effect Andromeda.

105
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,960
Um, so I'm gonna, um, probably give that a try again in the future.

106
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,840
Um, but right now I'm actually kind of getting more into the narration game.

107
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,960
So next is going to be the, that Edith Finch.

108
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,440
Oh, whatever happened to Edith Finch?

109
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,440
Yeah.

110
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,440
I think it's called.

111
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,440
Yeah.

112
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,440
That game is great.

113
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,440
I like this.

114
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,880
I like the dark soccer plays emo games.

115
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,680
Yeah.

116
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,920
I might now cause I can do that in one sitting.

117
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,320
I might do, um, Dear Esther as well.

118
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,320
Oh yeah.

119
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,320
Yeah.

120
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,320
Cause that one was really pretty and I enjoyed it.

121
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,320
Yeah.

122
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,680
Yeah.

123
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,680
Yeah.

124
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,680
Yeah.

125
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,680
They just had a remake on PS4 of that.

126
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,680
Not that long ago.

127
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,080
So I had this one period, um, at work where I'd managed to get like flex time off.

128
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,480
So I was off the phone for like two hours, so I played it on my Mac at work.

129
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,480
There you go.

130
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,480
There you go.

131
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,480
It was great.

132
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,480
That's great.

133
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,480
Um, what was it?

134
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,480
There was another one I was gonna suggest.

135
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,400
Oh, you should, you should be doing, um, you know, this, you know, we've been on break.

136
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,760
It's been about three weeks since we did a show and I think, I feel like one of those

137
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:33,360
games is kind of like come and gone is the dream daddy dating game.

138
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,400
I haven't started it.

139
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,480
I didn't pick that up yet cause I just, you know, obviously the last three weeks have

140
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,480
been pretty crazy.

141
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,600
Um, so I just kind of missed that whole boat.

142
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:46,520
So, but I, I feel like that's a game you should be streaming.

143
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,600
I'll make a daddy.

144
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,880
If you do pigeons, Jamie, why not daddy?

145
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,600
I still have more pigeons to do.

146
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,600
That's right.

147
00:07:52,600 --> 00:08:01,320
Um, but also, um, I'm thinking I am level 72 now in Dragon Ball Xenoverse.

148
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,320
Oh wow.

149
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:10,000
So I'm coming up to level cap and, um, I just did like, I'll get into that for my gaming

150
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,360
week, but good Lord, I was going to start streaming some of that, but it's gotten kind

151
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,360
of weird.

152
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,360
Okay.

153
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,280
And it is so off Canon that it makes my brain hurt.

154
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,280
All right.

155
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,600
Well, let's check in with a tech master, Loki, joining us once again.

156
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,600
How are you, Loki?

157
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,600
I'm fine.

158
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,040
Now you got, you got really sick over the break.

159
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,040
Yeah.

160
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,040
Fun times.

161
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,640
Because there was, I'm going to, I'm going to be honest, there was a part of me that

162
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,820
was thinking, should we do last week?

163
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,760
You know, I was kind of on the fence last week.

164
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,680
I was kind of like half ready, but I was a little worried, you know, but, uh, then what

165
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,000
kind of sealed it for me was that I heard you were really sick and it was like, all

166
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,120
right, let's, let's just, I would have still done it, but I would have probably been coughing

167
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:56,520
and wheezing and you know, I still have like, kind of like they call it, I think they call

168
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,760
it rails or whatever.

169
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:03,040
It's basically, imagine the sensation of having like a carbonated beverage in your lungs.

170
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:10,280
I didn't want to do the show at 70%, 99.9%, nothing but almost the finest for our listeners.

171
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,160
I think, I think we're good.

172
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,160
So it would have been fine.

173
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,760
It would have been, it was great though.

174
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:20,400
Cause like one thing that, that the one advantage of being that sick is I was able to do the

175
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:25,920
like, uh, like some evil silent Hill voice or like the ring voice or whatever you call

176
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,920
that.

177
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:31,280
Like pretty, uh, if I could do that with like without, like in the grudge, it was the grudge,

178
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,280
the grudge.

179
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,280
Yeah.

180
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,280
Let me see, like, see if I breathe out all the way.

181
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,440
Sometimes I can,

182
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,640
I mean, that's like my lungs right now.

183
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,640
That's okay.

184
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,840
It was much worse later on.

185
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:49,440
Like you could make a really gruesome sounding sounds like, Oh my God, why are you at work?

186
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,440
Go home.

187
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,440
You know, that type of thing.

188
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,440
I believe you.

189
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,760
Do you, do you remember when I had walking pneumonia?

190
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,760
Like what?

191
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,760
Six years ago.

192
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,600
Oh yeah.

193
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,600
I believe that noise.

194
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,600
Trust me.

195
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,400
Well, I don't know if it like, I see I at least had bronchitis, but then that the medicine

196
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,400
wasn't really helping.

197
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,960
So they put me on an antibiotic, which is normally what they do for pneumonia.

198
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,960
And then it went away.

199
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,340
So maybe I had pneumonia or they just never did anything to confirm it.

200
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:16,200
It's probably for the best if you had all that, that you didn't show up here at the

201
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,200
house.

202
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,200
Yes.

203
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,720
Cause you know, the last thing I needed the past couple of weeks was to be sick, but I'm

204
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,720
glad you're doing better.

205
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,720
Um, so

206
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,720
pneumonia is not contagious.

207
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,720
I overheard, um, Bobby talking to you before the show tonight and I know he was razzing

208
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,840
you a little bit cause she didn't really get to work on your game, although then he felt

209
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,840
bad cause you were sick.

210
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,840
So it was like, Oh, he

211
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,840
tried.

212
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:39,520
I like, I had the laptop in my lap and I was just exhausted because I don't sleep a lot

213
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,520
as it is.

214
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:45,160
And then, you know, constantly coughing and trying to like force yourself not to be just

215
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,840
like coffee all the time because when you're coughing that much, then it makes your airways

216
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:52,200
get tighter, which means I have to use the inhaler, which wasn't working that well.

217
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,000
And it was just, it was a mess.

218
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:01,040
And so like, I really wanted to, but my brain just is like, I can't do this.

219
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,120
And even last night, like I was like, okay, I'm gonna work on something.

220
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:10,760
I need to do something and I just, I can't, I just need the rest, I guess.

221
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,760
I don't know.

222
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,360
But I want to, I, I've been trying every day.

223
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,160
It's just brain has not wanted to do that.

224
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,160
Yeah, I understand.

225
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,160
I understand.

226
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,720
You know, we got to give you a little crap though.

227
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,720
Once in a while.

228
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,840
And I completely understand and I, I do want to work on stuff actually right now being

229
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:29,920
that of course I didn't make the game jam, which I kind of knew from before I started

230
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,840
the game jam that that wasn't going to happen.

231
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,840
We all knew Loki.

232
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:38,240
We all knew that being sick didn't help, you know, on top of that.

233
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,080
But now I'm kind of at the point like, okay, well what do I work on now?

234
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,800
Do I finish what I was working on?

235
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,000
Do I, everyone keeps bugging me to work on that.

236
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
It's time to card game.

237
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Should I do that?

238
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,560
Should I do the other thing I was working on?

239
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,960
It's like, I'm kind of like, what do I want to work on now?

240
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,960
I don't know.

241
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,600
So I have to figure that out.

242
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,360
All right, well good luck trying to figure that out.

243
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:04,200
I do want to introduce our chat room over at live.vog network.com because we do tape

244
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,720
live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby

245
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:14,040
Black Wolf show at the voice geeks network, vog network.com where Bobby says coding wall

246
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,040
six sucks.

247
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,120
I've had to do that before because they were paying me to, but if they weren't paying me

248
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,120
to nope.

249
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,120
Yeah.

250
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:23,740
And speaking about like sleeping, you know, I, I couldn't sleep very well either.

251
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:27,440
So that, you know, that just, it didn't help.

252
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,120
And then I was working on top of that.

253
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:35,060
So you know, um, I do want to, I do want to, it's hard to motivate myself.

254
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:38,920
It's really hard to stay motivated cause I, by the end of the day after the kids, cause

255
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:44,600
the kids are so fucking draining, it's just like, I have no energy left to, and trying

256
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,080
to like do critical thinking and like thinking in that coding.

257
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,880
It's just, it's hard.

258
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,880
It's really hard.

259
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,600
Much, you know, I have so much respect for people that actually do that have a family

260
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,520
or they abandon their family to work on a game for a while, but, um, you know, seriously

261
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,320
it's so much respect for those people.

262
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,000
Uh, looking at chat, a hit stun says I tried to do Ludum Dare.

263
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Did I pronounce that right?

264
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Ludum Dare.

265
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I think that's right.

266
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,080
A couple of weeks ago and I couldn't finish the game, had to work the Sunday.

267
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,080
So it happens.

268
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,080
It happens.

269
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,080
Real life gets in the way sometimes.

270
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,520
I mean, there was a lot of things I wanted to do over the past couple of weeks and you

271
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,320
know, just a lot of that got put on hold.

272
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:23,520
Um, I, I was hoping finally this year I was going to get to California extreme because

273
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:28,280
I haven't been to California extreme in like six years, but obviously everything that happened

274
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:32,480
and by the way, I do want to just acknowledge, um, a lot of you saying very, very nice things

275
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,320
about the intro to tonight's show.

276
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,000
So just thank you very much.

277
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,800
Um, I, I'm really feeling it all.

278
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,800
So thank you.

279
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:44,040
Um, so, but, but I wanted to go to California stream, but obviously I couldn't and, uh,

280
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,160
you know, but dark soccer, you got to go to California streams.

281
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,320
I mean, I know this is like two weeks ago at this point, but did you have a good time?

282
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,320
Yeah.

283
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,320
Had a really good time.

284
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,320
Yeah.

285
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,320
Um, got to play all kinds of things.

286
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,520
I took pictures of everything that I played, but I played journey for you.

287
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,520
Good.

288
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,520
Thank you.

289
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,520
Thank you.

290
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,520
Appreciate it.

291
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,520
Um, uh, I really didn't play any of the money.

292
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,520
I'll be honest.

293
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,520
That's all right.

294
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:10,040
I was, I was, I just come out of the cast, so I was wearing my walking boot and it threw

295
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:14,160
me way off balance a bit, but I would have liked to see some of the panels.

296
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,880
I don't know if you do that stuff, but some of the classic game designers, I would have

297
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,880
really been into that.

298
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,600
So panels there now, I don't think they do a ton.

299
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,640
They have like one room and they have like three or four panels, but you know, did a

300
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:32,360
panel this year for, uh, cause he designed the new, um, star Wars pinball.

301
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:36,600
Oh, I'm, I'm confusing classic game expo with this.

302
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,600
That's one.

303
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,600
Oh, sorry.

304
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,600
And mix.

305
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:47,120
I realized I was mixing up my companies now, but no, um, he did, um, uh, he did the new

306
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:52,840
star Wars, uh, pinball, um, and, uh, which I got to play.

307
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,840
It was pretty neat.

308
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,840
Nice.

309
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,840
Nice.

310
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,840
Great.

311
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,840
All right.

312
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,840
Well, we'll get into more of our gaming weeks and stuff.

313
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,320
We've been playing a little later, but I want to get in kicked off kickoff topic first.

314
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:06,200
I do want to also say one thing I did do that was productive is I got a new mic to replay

315
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,360
it because you guys might remember I was having some serious mic problems in the last couple

316
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,360
of episodes.

317
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,800
Um, so I did get a new mic, so I might sound a little different.

318
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,280
Um, so, uh, just let me know if it sounds weird.

319
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:20,400
It was running a little quiet in tests, so I've tried to bump it up a bit, but I think,

320
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,640
I think we have it at a good point.

321
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,840
Just let me know if it sounds weird to you guys over in our live chat room because it

322
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,840
is live radio.

323
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,560
Sometimes we have to fix things on the fly.

324
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,600
Um, speaking of live stuff, I will be back on Twitch.

325
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,000
I've, Twitch has been on hold this entire time as well.

326
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,720
The last Twitch stream I did was the Splatoon thing I did after the last episode we did.

327
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,920
So Twitch will be back tonight as well.

328
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,400
So I want to just throw that out there as well.

329
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,800
Uh, so anyway, let's talk about kickoff topic tonight.

330
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:50,400
Um, one game that is kind of coming back all over again.

331
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,440
This is very interesting.

332
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,960
A lot of updates with this game.

333
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,200
Jamie, you had a story about this, right?

334
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,680
With No Man's Sky?

335
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,680
Yes.

336
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,680
Yeah.

337
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,600
Tell us about it.

338
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,600
The No Man's Sky?

339
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,600
Yeah.

340
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,600
The remake.

341
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,600
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

342
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,240
Well, not the remake, but like.

343
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,760
The Atlas Rises update.

344
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,760
Yeah.

345
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,760
A little update that's going on.

346
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,760
You know a little bit about this, right?

347
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,760
Logie?

348
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,760
Yeah.

349
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,760
So they, they've been doing like updates.

350
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,760
They had a couple before this that kind of improved.

351
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:20,160
They have the whole, you know, um, building of your own bases and stuff, but now they

352
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,280
have a whole bunch of new stuff added.

353
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:29,200
So they've kind of revamped the whole storyline, added, um, improvements to their mission system,

354
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:34,000
the, um, economies and also some other fun stuff.

355
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,760
Um, so one thing, they have options now for galactic regeneration.

356
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:42,360
So when you finish the game, it doesn't just give you like a random world.

357
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:48,440
It's more of like a, um, you have different ways that you can do it.

358
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:55,600
Like I think one of the ones I saw was more of like a, like a, I don't know, less hostile

359
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,400
universe or something like that, I think was one of the options.

360
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,040
Yeah, they did that.

361
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:04,240
That was one of the patches they did, like the one, one patches like that.

362
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,040
They had a version where you could do creative mode basis.

363
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,040
It's like Minecraft too.

364
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,040
Yeah.

365
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,880
This is more of like once you finish the game, it regenerates everything.

366
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:16,920
They had a new biome, so now there's new planets, new, um, stuff that actually looks different.

367
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:21,080
They actually have the sand worms now finally, like in the trailer, those are actually a

368
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,080
thing now.

369
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,080
A crash.

370
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,200
Oh, go ahead.

371
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,840
There's that pseudo multiplayer joint exploration.

372
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:32,360
But yeah, you, you had something on this where like people finally did something that

373
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,560
they were trying to do a year ago.

374
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,560
Right?

375
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,560
Yeah.

376
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,560
Meet up at the same location.

377
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,560
Yeah.

378
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,560
Problem is though, that's kind of still very basic.

379
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:43,280
It reminds me a lot of like, um, I don't know if you remember in fable and stuff when you're

380
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,800
playing, you'd see like a spark flying around and that was the other player.

381
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,440
And then you could join in your game and that won't accept this.

382
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,760
You can't actually join in the game.

383
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,280
There's not really anything that you can do.

384
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:59,000
But you, your impact on the environment doesn't necessarily show up on their screen.

385
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,480
However, that's one of the other things that they add is you can actually modify the environment

386
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,580
so you can actually kind of draw with like voxels and stuff in the game to like create

387
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:09,040
your own landmarks and things, which is kind of cool.

388
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:17,240
Um, they added new trading, new NPCs, um, crashed, um, huge crash ships.

389
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:25,160
And I want to say, I think there was, um, different units, uh, harvesters, you know,

390
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,160
more weapon types.

391
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:32,200
I mean, it's just a lot of shit, visual improvements, like 4k textures now, higher resolution textures.

392
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:36,960
Um, so yeah, and it's on sale on PC at least.

393
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,400
I think it's, I don't know what it is on, um, PlayStation 4 right now.

394
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,680
I have it on PlayStation 4.

395
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,440
Just look in your nearby clearance bin.

396
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,880
It's uh, it's showing up a lot of those places.

397
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,680
I'm not trying, and I'm not trying to be a bitch.

398
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,680
Like that's just the reality.

399
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:54,600
Like, you know, obviously this game had some serious, yeah, when it had some serious blowback

400
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:59,320
when it first came out and you know, that caused the price to drop significantly.

401
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,400
Now I, you know, you guys know how it was.

402
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,800
I didn't buy into the hype beforehand, so I didn't listen to any of the promises or

403
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,800
any of that stuff.

404
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,280
And when I bought the game, I was fine with it.

405
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,380
You know, I didn't, I didn't like love it.

406
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:16,780
I didn't hate it though, but like some people like really, really hated it.

407
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:21,980
Um, so I did, I did pop it in yesterday to take a look at it with some of the changes

408
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:26,180
and I do have to say, I was like, okay, wow, yeah, cause I found one of those big crashed

409
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:31,300
ships because now there's a story that takes you to one in the opening sequence of the

410
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,300
game.

411
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,900
And so I was like, okay, this is different.

412
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,900
This is like a lot of like changed stuff.

413
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:36,900
Yeah.

414
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,100
I think they have a whole nother storyline as well.

415
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,100
They do.

416
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,100
They do.

417
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:43,660
But in the opening of the game, you're not just like stranded with no explanation.

418
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,500
You're actually kind of handheld a little bit.

419
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:49,460
The game gives you quests like here's how to fix your gun.

420
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,720
Here's how to fix your ship.

421
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,100
And it kind of handholds you through those opening sequences of the game so you understand

422
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,860
a little better what's going on.

423
00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:01,300
So I mean the game's kind of changed all that, but let me ask both of you guys, does it matter

424
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,300
at this point?

425
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:05,060
Cause I think that's, I think that's the biggest thing most people are struck with is that

426
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:10,900
most people have made up their mind on no man's sky and here we are a year after the

427
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:11,900
fact.

428
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:12,900
I think it does actually.

429
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:16,900
I think it does because you look at like even the reviews on steam, the reviews weren't

430
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,740
very positive on steam.

431
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:24,860
I think when it came out and now they're mostly positive, I mean it has made an impact.

432
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:29,360
People are liking the changes that they're doing with it and I think, yeah, it does.

433
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:34,140
It's not going to be like, Oh, this is not going to, you know, sell a ton of units in

434
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,320
the beginning because you can't go back in time.

435
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:43,580
But I think that as far as, you know, keeping it going and stuff, it is gonna make a difference.

436
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:48,340
It's nice to see them actually putting the effort in to fix the game and now it's kind

437
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:51,940
of looking more like what they were originally proposing.

438
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:55,900
Jamie, I can't recall if you played the game a year ago.

439
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:59,740
I feel like you, you didn't really yet, but does all this news about the changes and updates

440
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:02,940
does it kind of make you go, Oh, maybe, maybe now it's worth my time?

441
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:03,940
Nope.

442
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,740
Not really.

443
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:06,740
I'm glad for the people who enjoy the game.

444
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:10,380
I just thought it was neat that the, you know, after all this time they're finally implementing

445
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:13,140
the things that people had asked for.

446
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,380
So no, it's not enough to make me want to play it.

447
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:17,900
I've got other things in my queue.

448
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:22,220
Is anyone surprised that the creators of this game didn't just, cause I, you know, I have

449
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:25,740
to admit a little bit like I'm a, I'm a little surprised that they didn't just shelve it

450
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:29,280
at some point, you know, and say, okay, we, we did our best.

451
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,280
It wasn't good enough.

452
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:34,880
We're going to just lessons learned for our new project, which was, you know, honestly

453
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:42,120
I could see that's a very easy option, but you know, it's good for them to actually put

454
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:46,440
out a Polish, you know, at least get it to where it needs to be because people are going

455
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,440
to, I mean, they're going to remember it was a clusterfuck to begin with, but they're also

456
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:54,240
going to remember that they actually took the time to fix all that stuff.

457
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,740
And that says a lot because there's a lot of big publishers out there that will release

458
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:03,980
games and they'll never fix them like avalanche in just cause three.

459
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:08,740
I mean, that took forever to get fixed and it's still not very fixed.

460
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:12,420
So do you think this gives this guy, Sean Murray, right from hello games, do you think

461
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:17,180
it gets, you know, obviously he's the guy that a lot of internet people are taking issue

462
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:20,820
with because of all these promises that they felt were unfulfilled.

463
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:25,180
Did you think this gives him some credit back that, well, he fulfilled a good chunk of them

464
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,180
a year later.

465
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,420
It took a year, but it helps.

466
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:30,900
It's better than if he didn't because if he didn't, then if he's kind of come out with

467
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:34,260
his next game or whatever, people are like, I'm not going to believe that shit.

468
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,260
Yeah.

469
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:39,100
Then again, there's Peter Molyneux and he used to make all sorts of wild fucking accusations

470
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:43,460
of shit that he was going to have in his game and he didn't fulfill that shit time after

471
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,460
time.

472
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:47,780
So, and people seem to buy his games just fine.

473
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:48,780
I don't know.

474
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:52,340
Maybe it's just, it definitely helps.

475
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:55,180
So it's good to see that they're doing that.

476
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:59,620
Let's look at some of the comments in chat over at live.vog.network.com.

477
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:05,300
Bobby Blackwell says, the Steam reviews got curated more to only be people who bought

478
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,820
the game and didn't refund that.

479
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:09,300
He actually said either that or the Steam reviews.

480
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:13,540
And then after that, the people who had negative reviews got negated when they refunded.

481
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:18,520
So that could be something is that, you know, I think what Steam does, it kind of, at least

482
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:23,360
when I was looking at it in the store, because I contemplated double dipping on PC, I did.

483
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:27,280
I didn't do it, but I did contemplate it because it is on sale for like 23 bucks.

484
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,440
It is on sale for 23 bucks.

485
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:34,960
And I noticed that it's, it showed, you know, this percent was negative, but on top of that,

486
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:40,600
it says like 80%, 75% within the last 30 days are positive.

487
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,280
And it was highlighting that almost more so than the other figure.

488
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,840
And I thought that was interesting.

489
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:48,400
So it does kind of, it does kind of show that I'm still thinking about, but I'm like, do

490
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,400
I really need to buy another?

491
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,280
I have this on PlayStation four.

492
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,240
I do like the fact that it looks nicer on PC.

493
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:56,600
I have a PC that can run it nice now.

494
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,120
It is tempting.

495
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,760
Kaijuto in chat says, I love the OG No Man's Sky.

496
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,480
Haven't tried the new version yet.

497
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,480
Gamers suck.

498
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:09,040
I'm not surprised they didn't abandon the game because I've seen many devs do this.

499
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:12,200
They always backpedal for gamer babies.

500
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:16,100
I think honestly though, I think he had good, great plans for this.

501
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,220
He needed more time.

502
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:19,440
Sony pushed him to release it.

503
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:24,160
Time after time again, we see that it's these publishers pushing people to release these

504
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,560
games and they're not quite ready to release them yet.

505
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:31,280
That's probably true because the PlayStation four, I seem to remember that year, didn't

506
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:34,200
have a lot of big games coming out.

507
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:40,280
So No Man's Sky was really pushed as a God of War level type release.

508
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:45,680
And so, okay, I could see that, but the game had already been delayed several times, hadn't

509
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,680
it?

510
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,680
Right.

511
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,680
But I think it didn't come out in the summer.

512
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,800
I kind of thought it was supposed to be like a fourth quarter.

513
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,800
Yeah.

514
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,080
It would have probably been better off a holiday when they could have got some of that or this

515
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,440
other stuff in there for sure.

516
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:03,280
So yeah, it'd be very interesting how much did that influence play into it for sure.

517
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:07,640
Well anyway, it sounds like, you know, with some of these, I kind of think if you've never

518
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:14,040
played the game, if you like those type of Minecraft open world building games, I think

519
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:17,220
there might be something here for you, especially, you know, now that there's like a story that

520
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:22,860
kind of gives it like, well, there was kind of a story before, but it was kind of, there's

521
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:23,860
more stuff to do now.

522
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:24,860
Exactly.

523
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:25,860
It just feels more fleshed out now.

524
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:31,580
Like it feels like you're not just left in space for the sake of being left in space.

525
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:34,900
You know, you, you have a framework for what's going on.

526
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:39,520
So I feel like there's, there's a sufficient amount of handholding yet you're still able

527
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,860
to do whatever the hell you want to do.

528
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:44,800
You can ignore all that stuff completely if you want and just build whatever you want.

529
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:49,840
So yeah, so I think, I think the game's worth checking out if you haven't checked it out,

530
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,220
if you're into those type of games, but if you're not into those type of games, I'm not

531
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:56,640
sure there's anything here that's like going to sway your mind on it.

532
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:01,140
Like if you're not into the Minecraft type of games, this might not be for you.

533
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:03,840
So you know, there's that to consider as well.

534
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:08,240
But I did, I did like, like that you could kind of like build stuff now.

535
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,960
Like it felt more Minecraft like that.

536
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:16,400
Like I, I built a beacon to find something that I was, it's all part of a story, but

537
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,400
like I was building things.

538
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:22,080
I don't remember being able to do in the first release of the game or it was a lot more difficult

539
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,160
because you could kind of build, but it was very clunky in the inventory interface and

540
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,160
that part's kind of gone.

541
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:30,600
Well they even fixed a lot of the inventory stuff where now the inventory actually stacks.

542
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,600
Oh yeah.

543
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,600
Yes, yes.

544
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,600
That happens.

545
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,600
Thank you.

546
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:39,760
And as part of the story, it handholds you through the process of expanding your inventory.

547
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,000
It's not something you're left to your own devices to figure out like you were before

548
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,360
when it was like, then it kind of spread around like, Oh, if you find one of these things,

549
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,800
ask it to locate a drop off or whatever, and you can expand your inventory that way.

550
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,380
Like they've, they handhold you through that now, which is nice.

551
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:56,920
So I think more people will kind of be into it if they, they didn't get to see it the

552
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,920
first time.

553
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,240
And now it's what only 23 bucks to do it.

554
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,800
So yay.

555
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:05,360
Or even cheaper, probably if you can find it on PlayStation four or somewhere else.

556
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,800
So all right.

557
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,760
So No Man's Sky got updated.

558
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,760
Check it out.

559
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,680
If you think that's something you'd be into.

560
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:15,080
Meanwhile, let's talk about what games we have been playing.

561
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:18,920
We always like to do towards the top of the show a little bit of how was your gaming week.

562
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:22,340
Obviously, I know it's been a few weeks, so how was your gaming time?

563
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,560
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming time?

564
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:28,080
Oh gosh, I played all the games.

565
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,480
You know, and, and since we're covering a big period, we don't have to name every single

566
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,480
game.

567
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,480
Just kind of your highlights.

568
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,480
If you want.

569
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,480
Goodness.

570
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:40,280
Well, I played a Dragon Ball Xenoverse too, cause I'm still playing it.

571
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,880
I finished Everybody's Gone to the Rapture.

572
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,000
I tried to play Mass Effect Andromeda.

573
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
That didn't happen.

574
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,120
Um, I played a lot of pinball, a lot of pinball.

575
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:54,080
I've played Star Wars, I've played Star Trek The Next Generation.

576
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,800
You guys have had new machines going in and out of that house of yours too.

577
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,800
One new machine.

578
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,800
That was ours.

579
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,800
Oh, I thought it was other ones too.

580
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,920
Um, maybe you were posting clips playing at somebody else's house or something.

581
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:08,160
We've been borrowing Cactus Canyon and continued for a while.

582
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:12,280
And then we picked up our own Star Trek, the new one.

583
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:17,520
But at the little pinball thing, I played Ghostbusters, which was really fun.

584
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:24,640
Bride of Pinball 2.0, Black Knight 2000, I played some older ones like Bite of the Snake

585
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:30,440
or something, Medusa, you know, kind of classic.

586
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:35,400
I also played, um, the new Aerosmith Table.

587
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,400
That was pretty fun.

588
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:40,680
I'm just trying to see if I can get like an overview of some of the other things I played,

589
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:45,560
which of course, um, I played a Big Bang Bar, um, Space Fury.

590
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,560
You remember Space Fury?

591
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,720
I love that game.

592
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:52,280
They had that ginormous, um, Space Invaders as well.

593
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:55,360
Isn't that a ticket spitter game now?

594
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,800
Those giant Space Invaders?

595
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,160
They have one at round one.

596
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,160
I've seen it around one.

597
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,120
I think they have one over at that strikes in Rockland.

598
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,120
They have the big...

599
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,040
Yeah, play with like kind of like a Canon controller.

600
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,040
Yeah, yeah.

601
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,040
Isn't that a ticket?

602
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,040
I think it's a ticket spitter now.

603
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,280
It's neat, whatever it is.

604
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:17,940
I played one of the P3 tables, um, which was, hold on, Lady Lights, no, Lexi Lightspeed.

605
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:24,720
The P3 tables are supposed to be these modular tables that have video screens on the playfield.

606
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,920
Oh.

607
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,920
And it was pretty neat.

608
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,920
It was a fun game.

609
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:30,800
Is that like the hologram alien thing they had a while ago?

610
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,800
No.

611
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,800
No different?

612
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,800
No, that's different.

613
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,000
Um, this actually has like a full video screen.

614
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Huh.

615
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:44,880
Um, so there was Journey, there was, oh yeah, they had, um, a Fantasy Zone 2 tape, uh, uh,

616
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,880
machine.

617
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,880
Wow.

618
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,640
And it was so much fun because I love Fantasy Zone.

619
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,040
It was the Tears of Oppa Oppa.

620
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:56,160
Um, I played Elvira, Willow, the Capcom side-scrolling Willow.

621
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,160
Oh, wow.

622
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:02,080
Not that, the arcade version of Willow was very different than the NES version.

623
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:06,060
It was kind of one of those, like, Strider too, where the arcade and the home versions

624
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:07,060
were very different.

625
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,620
It has more in common with Three Wonders.

626
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,620
That same art style and everything.

627
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:10,620
Yeah, it does.

628
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:16,120
Um, I played America's Most Haunted, for pinball, uh, SkyShark, which-

629
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:19,440
Isn't America's Most Haunted, is that the Ben Heck table?

630
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,800
I think that's the Ben Heck table.

631
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,800
Oh, interesting.

632
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,800
Yeah.

633
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,680
But it was supposed to be like based off of Scooby-Doo, but they couldn't get licensing

634
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,680
or whatnot.

635
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,720
It was weird.

636
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:32,000
Um, SkyShark, I played, um, because I love SkyShark.

637
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,360
It's like one of my favorite old, you know, war shooting, playing games.

638
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:41,040
Uh, Kroll, Pac-Man and Chomp Chomp, which I don't know if that's anything official, but

639
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,040
it was fun.

640
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,040
Uh, Crazy Otto.

641
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,960
You know what Crazy Otto is, right?

642
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,560
Was that Crazy Climber with a-

643
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,560
No.

644
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,560
Hack?

645
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:51,560
Crazy Otto was what turned into Ms. Pac-Man.

646
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,560
Right.

647
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,700
Right, right, right, right.

648
00:30:54,700 --> 00:31:00,480
And someone had like one of the smaller machines, um, set up with like a big ROM hack for Crazy

649
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,480
Otto.

650
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,480
Um-

651
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,480
How was the turnout at the event?

652
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,480
It was busy.

653
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,480
It was busy.

654
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,480
I bet.

655
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,480
They moved a lot of games into another room.

656
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:12,660
Um, there's Gemini Wing, um, Ula Poco, which is another, uh, puzzle game, uh, Dan, they

657
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:17,660
had, uh, Vectrex upstairs and console games, so Dan was playing the Vectrex.

658
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:18,660
Oh, nice.

659
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:19,660
Nice.

660
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:20,660
Um-

661
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:21,660
So you played a lot.

662
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:22,660
Yeah, Hyperball.

663
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:23,660
They had a Hyperball that was actually working.

664
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:24,660
Nice.

665
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:25,660
Hyperball.

666
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:30,900
Um, I'm just trying- Oh, yeah, they had, uh, the loop in the third typing game, which they

667
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:31,900
have every year.

668
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:32,900
Um, Level 255-

669
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,700
But not Typing of the Dead.

670
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:35,700
No.

671
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,700
That's unfortunate.

672
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:37,980
Level 255, you know what that is?

673
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:40,180
That is the Pac-Man thingy, right?

674
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,180
Yes.

675
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:44,940
Yes, because of the- it's like, does it jump you right to the last level, or is it-

676
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,580
Like, right before that, I think.

677
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:47,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

678
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:49,220
Um, it's meant to simulate it.

679
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:52,700
Um, there was just all kinds of fun stuff there.

680
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,700
Really fun stuff.

681
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:58,180
Dan and I are more thinking that it might be time to start selling some of the collection.

682
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:01,580
Because there's- people are paying bucks for it.

683
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:02,580
Yeah.

684
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:03,580
And we've got lots of stuff in the box.

685
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:09,980
So if anyone wants to give me $500, you too can own a Ninja Gaiden trilogy in the box.

686
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:10,980
Just saying.

687
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:11,980
Good to know.

688
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:12,980
Good to know.

689
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:13,980
All right.

690
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:14,980
So, Dark Taco's been very busy.

691
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,780
Loki, how was your, uh, gaming time?

692
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,980
I was not busy, unfortunately.

693
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:23,660
I did not play anything, because once again, I was trying to focus on actually making a

694
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:25,660
game, and that just wasn't happening.

695
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:26,660
Well, and you got bronchitis.

696
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:27,660
And I got bronchitis.

697
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:30,060
But no, I did want to- I did want to play stuff.

698
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:37,540
I ended up- ironically, I ended up playing Legos more than I did anything, so.

699
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,540
Like the Lego Dimensions game, or you mean like actual-

700
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,540
No, like, Legos Legos.

701
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:44,340
Like, I got out my Legos from, like, when I was a kid and made my kids play with them,

702
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,340
and now they love Legos.

703
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:48,800
And we have a Lego store in our town, actually.

704
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:53,120
There's a store called Five Star Bricks, and they sell Legos, so I bought my Lego Loki

705
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,900
finally because I've been trying to get a Loki minifig for, like, forever.

706
00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:00,360
And so I got that, and they have, like, this cool booth that, like, it's like a bin with

707
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:04,740
a bunch of minifig parts, and so you can build your own minifig for, like, three bucks.

708
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:08,200
And so my kids had fun doing that, because they made their own custom minifig and everything.

709
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,880
They have birthday parties there!

710
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,840
I'm like, dude, I should have my birthday here!

711
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,280
This is fucking awesome!

712
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,880
Good job getting your kids on Lego at a young age, though.

713
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,880
Yeah, hell yeah.

714
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,960
I mean, I had all this stuff, I'm like, come on, you guys, don't you want to play this?

715
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,280
And, like, my son just doesn't want to build, he wants me to build everything for him.

716
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:29,640
And he got a bunch of Legos for his birthday, too, and so I made him put one of the sets

717
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,640
together.

718
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,000
I'm like, you're gonna put this together, I'll help you, but you need to do this yourself.

719
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,600
I can't do everything for you.

720
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,200
And he did it, and he felt very rewarded by that.

721
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,360
He's like, I put this together, you know?

722
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,360
Good.

723
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,360
So that was kind of fun.

724
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:46,920
As far as actual games I played, I played the stupid cell phone clicker game for Office

725
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,080
Space.

726
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:53,000
I am having a serious addiction problem with that game, like I can't stop playing it, even

727
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,720
though I don't want to sometimes.

728
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,080
But I mean, it's entertaining, I guess.

729
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:04,520
Every single time they do these little events, they keep changing the rules for them, so

730
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,180
it mixes it up a bit, I guess.

731
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:08,880
But I don't know, sometimes it's just irritating.

732
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:12,080
Thankfully, this last one they did, I was able to complete the event in like two hours

733
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:16,320
instead of five days, so that was kind of nice.

734
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,320
I don't know.

735
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:20,840
Aside from that, I really didn't play anything.

736
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:26,680
So I've been trying to play, I've been meaning to play VR, and actually do the super hot

737
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:30,200
VR, because I have that for PlayStation VR.

738
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,200
Haven't got a chance to do that.

739
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,540
I've been on the fence about buying an Oculus Rift.

740
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:37,720
I really don't have the money for it, but I'm still thinking about doing it anyways.

741
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:41,320
I'm like, am I gonna use it?

742
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,320
Responsibility!

743
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:46,600
I may just wait and eat the extra hundred dollars or whatever, wait for Black Friday

744
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:51,080
or something like that, I don't know, but it's very tempting.

745
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:55,080
That's where I'm at with the 4K, because you know I have a 4K monitor now, that was a purchase

746
00:34:55,080 --> 00:35:00,120
I made I think right before the last show, and now it's like, oh I need to get a better

747
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,320
video card so I can play Destiny 2.

748
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,560
Well yes, you should get a better video card, that's actually something that's worthwhile,

749
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:09,320
whereas an Oculus, that's something you'll use every time you use your computer.

750
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:14,560
But I'm in that predicament where it's like, do I buy one now, or do I wait for those inevitable,

751
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,840
whatever that new one is that's coming out, like Titan or whatever, there's a new one

752
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:22,560
coming out in like a month, and so I gotta wait for that so that the prices of the other

753
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,560
ones kinda come down.

754
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:26,560
Because right now, a 1080 is like 800 bucks.

755
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,360
You don't need a 1080, a 1070 would be fine enough.

756
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,080
That's still like 400, I think a 1070.

757
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,520
I have a 1060 in this laptop.

758
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,520
Do you really?

759
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,520
Yeah, so.

760
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,520
Nice.

761
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,520
Yeah, it's fucking nice.

762
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:43,520
I have a 970 now, so I can get away with like 2K graphics on my monitor, so like Overwatch,

763
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,480
Final Fantasy XIV, all those games look a little better.

764
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:51,480
The only game I can play in full 4K and it runs fine is Diablo 3, but it's because I

765
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:55,440
think that game is kinda, you know, it's a few years old at this point, and I think there's

766
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,440
less going on, but that's the only game I can play in the full 4K.

767
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,520
Yeah the AMD, they have new AMD cards coming out, they're supposed to be pretty good.

768
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:07,400
AMD's been putting out a lot of stuff that's been a little bit cheaper, especially with

769
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:10,840
the Ryzen cards and everything, or Ryzen chips.

770
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:16,240
So hopefully there's gonna be more competition with that, but yeah, the 1070 is a pretty

771
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,240
nice card.

772
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:22,480
Honestly, you know, I was like, well the laptop in the 1060 is probably good because there's

773
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:27,580
only a 1080p monitor, so I was like, probably don't need much more than that, it plays everything

774
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:28,580
fine.

775
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:29,580
Yeah.

776
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:30,580
Okay.

777
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:31,580
Alright.

778
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:32,580
Well, we'll see, we'll see.

779
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:34,540
My gaming time.

780
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:39,660
So let's see, gosh, I've been playing a lot.

781
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:44,620
One game that I found myself playing until the wee hours of the morning over the past

782
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:48,140
couple weeks was Diablo 3, funny enough.

783
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:51,060
I think there's something about, and you were kinda mentioning this when you were talking

784
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:55,180
about you're sick and you don't really wanna have to think a lot, I think with Diablo 3,

785
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:58,700
you just really have to click click click click click and get loot.

786
00:36:58,700 --> 00:36:59,700
Click click click.

787
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:00,700
Yeah exactly.

788
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:01,700
As little as all it is, right?

789
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:06,700
Like yesterday actually, I was sitting there and I'm like, I see my Overwatch icon, I'm

790
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:10,660
like, I haven't played Overwatch in like a month, I'm like, I should go play Overwatch

791
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:14,380
and I'm like, eh, but the controller's all the way over there, it's like, I just don't

792
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:15,900
wanna do this.

793
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:20,980
I probably, so okay, so you know how Diablo has the seasons and you can do a fresh start,

794
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:24,700
so on PC, some of my friends are playing on Playstation 4 and they want me to play over

795
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:28,220
there so I started a character, I got it to about level 30 but I just haven't been able

796
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:34,020
to connect with them online, but PC's very convenient for me to play so I started a character

797
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:41,180
on PC probably that Monday of the week after Mom passed and I was off work, I started a

798
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:47,420
character and I am now at Paragon 270 for the season, so just to give you an idea how

799
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:53,420
much I've been playing Diablo 3, it's been quite a little bit, so that's, that was, yeah,

800
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:55,460
that was a big game time sink.

801
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:59,140
I've been playing some of the usual stuff too, Final Fantasy XIV, I did play some new

802
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:05,620
stuff as well, I should point out, Shane came over yesterday and he has on his Playstation

803
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:13,100
4, he downloaded from the Hong Kong Playstation store, DJ Max Respect, cause that's not here

804
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:19,460
in the US yet, and I don't know if it's actually getting released or whatever, it's hard to

805
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:24,820
tell, like I don't know, I don't understand why these games can't just come out at the

806
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:28,380
same time, since yes, it's region free, but he had to do this whole thing where he had

807
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:34,780
to buy a card that was Hong Kong dollars on Playstation, he had to create a new account,

808
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:39,300
he got it and all this stuff, but it's just like, it just seems so tedious when it's like

809
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:43,020
why can't they just, it's gotta have something to do with music licensing I'm sure for a

810
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:47,180
game like that, but gosh, just figure it out, or I don't know, but anyway, so I did get

811
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:51,460
to play the game, long story short, I did get to play DJ Max Respect and I thought it

812
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:57,740
was cool because it's basically Beatmania 2DX, but on your controller, and obviously

813
00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:01,540
there's no turntable, and it's interesting because they have a four button mode, a five

814
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:06,140
button mode, and a six button mode, so it's like in four buttons it's left on D-pad, up

815
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:11,980
on D-pad, triangle and circle, and then in five button mode you can use right or square

816
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:18,100
for the fifth button, and then in six button it's right and square separate, so it's the

817
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:23,260
falling notes and you hit them in time with the music, and you know, it's a well done music game,

818
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:27,140
I enjoyed what I played with it, I was kind of like, I want this, but I just don't want to have

819
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:32,780
to jump through all these stupid hoops, so I guess I could get a physical edition, I think only one

820
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:37,260
store online that I know of has a physical edition, and it's a place I really don't want

821
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:42,020
to shop unless I like have to, so I'm kind of waiting to see, I guess the game is coming out

822
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:47,980
in Japan in a couple months, so I'm waiting to see if the Japanese version might be English

823
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:52,900
language still, or how that'll work, so we'll see, I just hope there's gonna be a US release

824
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:57,260
of the game eventually, because there's obviously enough DJ Maxx fans here, and music game fans to

825
00:39:57,260 --> 00:40:03,020
substantiate it, so it would be nice for that to happen, so that was something new that I played,

826
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:09,100
otherwise still some old favorites, I should mention Pokemon Go, because that whole raid

827
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:15,740
stuff, that was very very motivating in actually leaving the house, I left the house probably for

828
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:21,460
the first time after a few days, to go catch a Moltres, so I did, it didn't end up appraising

829
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:26,100
as a wonder, so that was disappointing, but at least I finally freaking caught one, so that was,

830
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:33,580
that was nice, so I did get one of each, because we did, we went around yesterday, and got Zapados,

831
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:38,660
that way we have them all, yeah, I had to buy some raid passes to do it, because we didn't get it on

832
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:43,260
the first try, but I was able, I was able to get it eventually, and I gotta say, it's, it's been

833
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:47,060
very interesting through this whole thing with Pokemon Go, and all these changes through the

834
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:51,860
past few weeks, like there's this discord for Pokemon Go, that you can join for local like

835
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:57,260
Sacramento to find other raiders and stuff, and it just blew up, like it blew up in just a matter

836
00:40:57,260 --> 00:41:02,620
of days, like there's thousands of people on it, it's pretty crazy, and so that's a good way to

837
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:08,220
like find people in the suburbs, where I live, to find raiding, but you know what we found was

838
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:13,380
easier, because we ran into some really like, just what happens when you get a big group of

839
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:17,980
nerds together, there are some people that don't wait for others to show up, before they just go

840
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:22,700
and raid, you know, and it's like too bad, so sad for you, and other stuff, so honestly like Alan

841
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:29,620
and I just had better luck, we went downtown, and just went to where we saw Zapados, and like we

842
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:35,700
would have a full group in 10 minutes, like we walked up to where Zapados had just spawned,

843
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:40,860
as we walked up we saw people tapping their phones, so we're like oh great, they're already in,

844
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:44,500
we missed it, oh well, but Alan was like no, we'll just hang out for a minute, so I was like all

845
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:50,980
right, so we hung out, and within 15 minutes we had 20 people, a full group, ready to do it again,

846
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:55,060
which we were the first ones to show up for that, so it's like downtown was the place to be at,

847
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:59,460
because that's just where non-stop groups are forming, so I'm gonna remember that for the

848
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:03,380
future, for any other raids they might end up releasing, although I would imagine this whole

849
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:08,180
thing's taking a break after Monday, with all the kids being back in school, and all that,

850
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:12,540
Lucia might still be around, I think they might keep one of the five-star raids, just so people

851
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:20,620
can get those rewards, but I think for the most part, you know, I feel like this can't be the

852
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:25,660
only chance, they'll come back, I just, I don't care anymore, honestly, like I'm kind of, I'm

853
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:30,900
over it, and it's taken me a while, like I was kind of still playing it casually, and then I

854
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:34,860
might still do that now, because now that my kid's gonna be back in school later this week,

855
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:40,420
it's good to kill time, because I can, you know, spin the pokestop, he, because apparently his

856
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:45,740
school is also a park, and so it went, it bypassed that rule that it's not supposed to be in the

857
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:51,060
school, but there's a, there's a pokestop right at the school, and so I spin the pokestop while I

858
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:57,380
wait there in the morning for his, you know, class to start, but, you know, that's really the only

859
00:42:57,460 --> 00:43:01,420
reason I was doing that, but now, like, actually, I have so many Pokeballs, I have to throw them

860
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:08,340
away in order to be able to spin it again, so. Oh no. Yeah, I have like 170 Pokeballs, so. Get a

861
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:12,220
clicker, like I have the Poke, uh, Pokemon Go Plus. They had those, I saw them the other day,

862
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:16,100
they had them at, like, Target. They're not hard to find anymore. And then I'm like, should I get

863
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:21,340
one just to cheat? It's not cheating, it's not cheating, it's an official product, it's not

864
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:26,500
cheating. No, I'm gonna open it up, and I'm gonna solder the, oh, that's LED to the actual click,

865
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:30,620
so every time that it notifies me that there's something there, it automatically clicks it.

866
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:37,060
I believe that exists already. It's called a Gotcha, or something. Uh, Charles, who was on our

867
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:41,220
last show when he was talking about it, but he has one of those things. He says, it's like a

868
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:44,820
bracelet, and I don't think you have to do anything with it. It's like a Gotcha, or so, I forget what

869
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:48,460
the name of it is, but I, I remember looking it up. I can figure it out for you. But, like, that,

870
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:51,780
that product already exists, actually. Well, I talked about that before that product even came

871
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:56,900
out. So, yeah, I was like, oh, this is how it's gonna work. All right. Uh, in chat, SSG100Matt

872
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:01,820
says, there are rumors that they will introduce Mew during the Japanese Pokemon Go event this

873
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:05,220
week. I worry some of that might just be wishful thinking, because people- Well, they have, was it

874
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:14,820
the, the, the low, the low-effort shiny Pikachu? Oh, yeah. We made the black into gray! Woo! I, I

875
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:19,740
do wish other shinies they would kind of roll out, or, I'm okay if they take a break from the

876
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:25,500
legendaries and decide to do, you know, to save Mew and Mewtwo for winter, or holiday break, or

877
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:30,220
something, and they kind of- How long did that take their artists? Find, replace. Oh, stop. Well,

878
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:33,820
that's how it was in the original games, so it's not like it's that different. I did see it, there

879
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:38,100
was an article I saw that there was a group of people that actually took down one of the Magikarp

880
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:43,940
ones with Magikarp, the one the Magikarp raves. Oh, nice. So, that's pretty funny. Same type, same

881
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:50,460
type attack bonus. Oh, I like seeing that. Nice. Alright, anyway, so that's enough about my gaming

882
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:54,460
time, so that was some of the stuff I played in the break, so, and then No Man's Sky, as I

883
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:59,860
mentioned a minute ago. Let's talk about housekeeping a little bit, because I do have some kind of big

884
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:06,420
updates that are important, I have to communicate during the housekeeping here. So, I am going to be

885
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:12,500
at Dragon Con in a few weeks. That is still on, so unfortunately we will be off over Labor Day

886
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:17,140
weekend, which is just, I think, I think it's like three weeks from today, that's three weeks from

887
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:21,980
today. So, we have two more episodes, then we'll be gone for Dragon Con, that one's always been a

888
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:27,820
planned break. I will be at Dragon Con, really excited to be a part of Dragon Con, and I'm gonna

889
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:32,380
be on three panels this year, tentatively, anything can change the last minute. I'll get you more

890
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:37,580
information about all that in an upcoming VOG article, but yeah, if you're gonna be near the

891
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:42,660
podcasting track, definitely come to some of those panels, and say hi. I'd love to meet folks from

892
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:49,100
OLR that are gonna be in the Atlanta area. So, Dragon Con is still happening. Unfortunately,

893
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:56,540
because of what happened with Mom passing, and me having to take a lot of time away to do that,

894
00:45:56,540 --> 00:46:02,700
I am having to cancel other trips, because just, unfortunately, it's one of those things where I

895
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:08,860
ran out the bank of time off, and money, and all that stuff, and so I just do not have the

896
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:14,460
resources to make some things happen, and one of those things is MAGFest 2018. I'm not gonna be

897
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:20,140
going, so that's a bummer, but I hope you guys that do go have a great time. So, I won't be going to

898
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:25,900
MAGFest this year. I did hear about all the ticket sales, and some of the issues that caused. I made

899
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:30,420
this decision independent of all that, so it's not related to that, but I hope they're able to work

900
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:37,020
that out. And the other thing, I was planning to go to New York in October for a wedding. I'm

901
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:42,020
having to call that off as well, which is a real bummer, because I wanted to go see people in New

902
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:46,940
York. I haven't been to New York in like 10 years, but I'm sure everybody understands I have to make

903
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:51,420
the tough call. So, hopefully, I can reschedule for next year. I can go visit my friend that's

904
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:55,660
getting married, and her, at that point, will be newlywed husband, and then make a trip out of it

905
00:46:55,660 --> 00:47:01,620
at that point. But for now, pretty much everything that isn't Dragon Con is canceled for the rest of

906
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:06,900
the year, but I'm hoping to do some other Expos next year. So, we'll look forward to that. So,

907
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:12,420
all right, I think that's all I have for housekeeping. So, let's get into some more

908
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:18,460
gaming news of which there's been a little bit. So, let's go to Loki. Yes, so we've, this is kind

909
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:22,540
of cool, because I remember when I actually tried to compete in this way back in the day,

910
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:29,380
back in the 90s. So, the Nintendo World Championships, they're having qualifiers

911
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:36,420
for the 2017 championships. The qualifier will be Mario Kart 7, and you're gonna have to play it in

912
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:43,380
time trails. They have two different age brackets. So, hold up, aren't we up to Mario Kart 8? But,

913
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:49,580
we can't forget about the 3DS, the true portable system that they have, the brand new portable

914
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:55,340
system from Nintendo. I see. Okay, continue. I mean, I don't know why they didn't just do this.

915
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:59,500
That was the first thing I noticed when I went to that page. I was like, Mario Kart 7? Is that a

916
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:06,460
typo? Aren't they supposed to be selling the new one, Mario Kart 8? You'd think, but I don't know.

917
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:13,580
Is that because there haven't been quality 3DS games in a long time? Oh, yeah, I went there. I

918
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:20,060
sure did. I'm also just being a little shady. It gets you hyped about Mario Kart 7 Deluxe on the

919
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:27,340
Switch. Don't even. Don't even. Alright, fair enough. Look, look, I'll stop being shady for it.

920
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:31,900
I get a lot of kids probably still play the portable one. Alright, whatever, cool. Yeah,

921
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:37,020
so they're gonna do it in two age brackets. There's gonna be 12 and younger and 13 and older,

922
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:45,020
and of course these are gonna be located at Best Buy in select cities. So August 19th and 20th,

923
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:53,500
you can do that at New York and San Jose, 26th and 27th, Chicago and LA, September 2nd and 3rd,

924
00:48:53,500 --> 00:49:01,020
Minneapolis and Dallas, and finally September 9th and 10th, Seattle and Miami. And then from there,

925
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:06,300
if you do happen to make it in there, then you actually, I guess, get to go to the actual

926
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:10,220
championships, wherever the hell that's supposed to be. And they do have a specific race that

927
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:15,660
you're doing. I want to say Luigi's Mansion, and I guess the younger players will get to play

928
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:21,740
as Mario, and then the older players of the race is Bowser, or race Bowser's Castle as Bowser.

929
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:28,220
So it's already set, so you know it's not going to be a surprise. You know exactly what you have to

930
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:32,860
do. Yeah. Then it's not a special cartridge like the old school championship. They should make them

931
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:37,660
play old ass games. Make them play the fucking old ass world championship game. Well they might,

932
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:42,300
in the finals. Fuck the finals. That should be the actual qualifier. That's what it was.

933
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:48,460
That was the qualifier. What about, what about, here's a perfect, here's a perfect medium. What

934
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:55,180
about NES Remix? How about a new game? Well that, well that may show up. Didn't, wasn't the whole

935
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:58,860
point when they brought it back a couple years ago, wasn't the whole point to introduce Mario

936
00:49:58,860 --> 00:50:04,540
Maker. And that ended up being like the last level, right? Was they played Mario Maker,

937
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:08,700
because there was those memes where the guy went through the door, and like there was all these

938
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:14,460
like, he was like nope, and he noped out. Remember that? No, that was, yeah, because what Kevin

939
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:19,100
Pereira was hosting, and he did a competent job and all that. He was good. And yeah, so I remember

940
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:23,340
that. There was Mario Maker was a big thing. So this kind of has a lot of people asking,

941
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:29,340
what are they pushing with this? Zelda Maker, please Zelda Maker, or Metroid Maker, or,

942
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:36,140
or Super Smash Brothers. This seems to be the wrong forum to... Smash Maker? I don't know.

943
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:40,460
What, that's the big question with your mind, like don't, don't get me wrong. I'm,

944
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:44,060
I think it's cool that, this tournament should have always been here. With their track record,

945
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:50,060
it's gonna be fucking Pikmin Maker or some shit like that, ain't it? Stop. Terrible Pikmin. Let's

946
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:56,540
release multiple games for that, but Metroid and F-Zero, fuck those guys. Well, we do know,

947
00:50:56,540 --> 00:51:00,860
okay, so they're advertising, if you go to Best Buy to do the tournament and all this stuff,

948
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:09,580
you get to play, they will have Mario Odyssey there, as well as the new Metroid 2 game on 3DS,

949
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:14,940
the new, you know, the, the one that they're Metroid, not Metroid 0, but Metroid 2 in 0

950
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:19,260
style, right? On the 3DS, that whole thing. So both those games are going to be there.

951
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:22,940
By the time it gets to the last city there, it's practically out anyways. I mean,

952
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:27,260
I guess it's, that's cool that they're doing, I, whatever, that's fine that they're doing that.

953
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:31,900
Is Mario Odyssey the big title? Is that, is this whole thing to push Mario Odyssey?

954
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:35,740
Is that going to be the last game played? I don't think, but like, if you think about the people

955
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:39,580
that are going to be competing in these championships or whatever, they're going to

956
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:45,420
buy these games anyways. It's not really drawing in like, you know, it's not like, you know,

957
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:49,820
back in the day when they showed the world championships and that was part of the wizard,

958
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:53,500
you know, and then people are like, oh shit, you know, fucking competition. And it's like,

959
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:58,460
oh no, it's real too. You can actually go try it. And they were like all the, um, it wasn't

960
00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:02,620
Blockbuster now. They had, well, Blockbuster was a different one. They had that actually with, uh,

961
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:06,300
it was like fighting games and stuff. Was that the world championships and Nintendo one or is that

962
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:10,300
something separate? I don't remember. I feel like Blockbuster did their own thing at one point.

963
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:15,020
Yeah, because they had their own thing with like, it was clay fighters and fucking NBA Jam.

964
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:21,340
And the one year was, uh, the Ninja Turtles fighting game. They remember they had that.

965
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:27,340
And I remember trying that cause I hated NBA Jam, but, um, I like strong with you. I love NBA Jam.

966
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:31,660
I just wasn't good at sports games are not my thing. Sports games usually aren't my thing

967
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:36,940
either, but the NES and the SNES era had like some of the best fucking sports games between

968
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:42,860
like blades of steel, even the original ice hockey, uh, NBA Jam, like all those games were

969
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:47,420
awesome. What's wrong with you? They should make them play really old games that are like,

970
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:50,860
I don't know, kids. Well, they are, they have to play Mario Kart seven Logie.

971
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:57,180
That's that's retro. Now she's pretty old. I think I was selling Mario Kart seven.

972
00:52:57,180 --> 00:53:01,020
Vid power in chat says it's surprising that qualifiers are playing Mario Kart seven,

973
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:05,020
a game from 2011. That's when that game came out. That's that old. Yeah.

974
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:11,660
Yeah. Jesus sure is. So, and you know, but, but you know, all this tongue in cheek stuff about

975
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:17,100
the world championships aside, I mean the games they're pushing Mario Odyssey and, and, you know,

976
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:21,420
Metroid return to Samus, I'm going to have both those games day one, day one, you better believe

977
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:26,060
it. I'm here for both of that. It's going to be awesome. So obviously it looks good. I mean, I,

978
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:31,020
in doing it wrong, I just wouldn't buy a system for, um, the Metro game. I mean, the Metro game

979
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:36,380
looks fantastic. I just, I just can't purchase a system for those games. And don't get me wrong.

980
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:39,340
I think, I think it's neat that the Nintendo world championships, like they're doing it again,

981
00:53:39,340 --> 00:53:43,420
but it's just, it's just weird timing. I'm not sure what is it they're pushing unless there's

982
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:47,980
a surprise, but I'm not going to set pushing e-sports, e-sports man, e-sports, Nintendo can

983
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:53,420
be sports. I'm not, I'm not going to set my expectation bar very high for an unveiling or

984
00:53:53,420 --> 00:54:00,700
anything like that. Um, but why, why did they put it on ice for like what, 25 years, 1990 to 2015,

985
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:06,140
right? They put on ice for 25 years and then they decided to bring it back, skip a year,

986
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:10,540
two years later. This is, it's just weird. Like I just don't, okay. I mean, but I guess

987
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:16,780
I shouldn't complain. Mario Kart 7 just wasn't ready for 2015. Ooh. But if I did want to set the

988
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:22,700
bar in fan wank territory, you ready for this? Ready for this? Maybe. Cause you talk about old

989
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:27,180
games. You keep saying that you need to play old games and this thing. What if this whole thing is

990
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:32,460
how they finally unveil, not just like the virtual console thing, but Nintendo's whole

991
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:39,340
Nintendo online program with the eight bit rewards. What if the twist is they play?

992
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:44,620
Why are you laughing so fucking hard? I'm laughing because like, I can just see it now. Yeah,

993
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:49,500
we're going to play this game. We had to download it first off of the Nintendo network. Oh, fuck.

994
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:56,380
Nintendo network. Those are the, those all go together. This will never work.

995
00:54:57,580 --> 00:55:04,060
The game, the game gets lag and lags console. It's like a digital download. It's not playing.

996
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:09,020
And the final game is excite bike, but you'll be playing it across the internet. Here we go.

997
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:15,020
Connecting, connecting the final game is excite bike. You actually have to play it though from

998
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:19,260
a system that is from the era with the original excite bike. They've been stored in a garage

999
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:24,300
and they're fucking dusty as hell. You got blow this shit out of that in order to get that thing

1000
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:30,060
to work before you can actually play excite. Well, I will practice my blowing skills in the

1001
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:36,300
meantime, then Loki is that president. He pulled out an air canister. Is this against rules? I'm

1002
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:43,340
going to allow it. Is it better to blow than suck? Why does he have chapstick? All right. Uh,

1003
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:49,340
let's move on to another story. Girl. Let's talk about a different company.

1004
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:54,220
I want to talk about, uh, Microsoft and some of the things they're doing because, uh,

1005
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:59,980
Hey, we, we have a soft spot in our hearts for the Xbox live indie games, right? Which was the

1006
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:06,620
XNA games on three 16. The reason why we love it so much was because of bungee ferret tossing,

1007
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:11,500
which was a game among other things, which was a game of Y Y R made that, you know, features

1008
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:15,980
our little logo in it and you know, all that stuff. So 360, can't forget plugged for all

1009
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:20,460
the Y Y R games falling was there too. So plug, plug. Uh, but then there was also like,

1010
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:25,020
there was just some real dumpster fire games available. Also some games that were pretty

1011
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:29,420
shitty, but they're still entertaining the play. Like there was like all the Minecraft clones

1012
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:35,260
games that are so bad. They're good. Yeah. They had some decent stuff on there. Like I bought

1013
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:39,740
some games on there. Well, we knew that the program is going away. In fact, I believe it's,

1014
00:56:39,740 --> 00:56:45,580
I think it's next month. It's done. Like you can't buy games anymore as of like next month.

1015
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:49,420
As long as I can still play them. That's well, once they're downloaded to your console,

1016
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:53,740
I'm pretty sure, you know, they're there forever. Uh, even as I have a download,

1017
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:57,660
even game room, you can still do that. But, um, yeah, I'm pretty sure you can still do that.

1018
00:56:57,660 --> 00:57:01,820
It's just, you can't buy any new ones. So a lot of people have been asking is,

1019
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:06,540
is Microsoft ever going to replace this? What's the deal? Well, it turns out, yes. Uh, there is

1020
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:12,460
going to be a different version of this. That's coming to Xbox one and windows 10. It's called the

1021
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:18,620
creators collection. Um, so I believe it's going to use unity now instead of XNA. So that's,

1022
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:22,540
you know, a big change, but a lot of games are made in unity now. So, you know, that shouldn't

1023
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:28,540
be a huge surprise that they're kind of getting away from the XNA. Um, so, uh, ID at Xbox,

1024
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:33,660
the director of that has explained this as the creators program was established to enable

1025
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:39,500
developers to directly publish their games, any of their games to Xbox one and windows 10 PCs

1026
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:45,020
with a simplified certification process and no concept approval required developers that

1027
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:49,340
published through the creators program have the freedom and independence to develop games that

1028
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:54,540
are truly unique, resulting in a collection with games that can be quirky and have varying degrees

1029
00:57:54,540 --> 00:58:00,620
of Polish, but are always interesting. Um, that is such the politically correct way of saying,

1030
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:07,100
get ready for some crap. That's the way they're saying like, yeah, we really want to promote your

1031
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:11,900
independence and creativity. It's more of, we just don't want to fucking curate any of that

1032
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:17,180
shit. Well, there's like, you know, Nazi propaganda or something. Yeah. I mean,

1033
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:20,940
we may get around to taking that out of there, but like, we don't fucking care.

1034
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:29,100
I can put a body simulator 2017. Let's do it. Why not? Oh, that's already a thing. So yeah,

1035
00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:33,020
obviously no. And to be, you know, I'm talking about like, wow, it's just going to be this

1036
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:41,100
wasteland of garbage. I mean, to be fair, the iTunes app store and Google play are very similar.

1037
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:46,060
There's a lot of fucking waste land of garbage, but there are some diamonds in the rough.

1038
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:50,780
Obviously there are apps that we use every single day. There are games like,

1039
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:55,100
yeah. Like for example, we don't judge steam by it's, you know,

1040
00:58:55,660 --> 00:59:01,980
buy everything that's on it because there's a lot of shit on there, but overall it's decent.

1041
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:06,380
Same with this, this, we should give you the benefit of the doubt because yes, there will be

1042
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:12,940
a lot of crap on it, but guess what? You don't have to buy the crap. Yeah. So it's going to be

1043
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:18,060
interesting to see what comes of this, but I mean, to be fair, like this is, you could publish your

1044
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:22,220
game. Loki, you always hype that you talk about your game here on the show. Now you have a place

1045
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:27,980
where you could put it and people could actually play it. We could, I'm not, I don't, I think we

1046
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:34,620
can, we would be able to make a VOG app, I think. Right. Like something where you could like,

1047
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:38,860
listen to VOG through Xbox one. I mean, if it would let you do that, you can already do that

1048
00:59:38,860 --> 00:59:41,980
with tune in anyway, maybe not. Cause it might not be able to let you go online. I guess you'd have

1049
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:46,220
to stick with the tune in app to do that, but, uh, well flappy fog could be a standalone game,

1050
00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:52,540
right? But it could, it could, if Bobby, the creator wanted to, it shouldn't.

1051
00:59:52,540 --> 00:59:59,340
What was the line from Jurassic park? Just because they could, nobody stopped themselves

1052
00:59:59,340 --> 01:00:07,420
to ever ask if they should. They shouldn't. Uh, let's see. SSU 100 Matt and chat over

1053
01:00:07,420 --> 01:00:13,180
at live.vognetwork.com says how fast until the first porn game comes out already being created.

1054
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:18,460
Well, they can't cause that's against the rules, but I mean, there's, there's, there's way highly,

1055
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:28,300
highly suggestive like finds a way romance simulator 2017 or, or, um, vibrating controller.

1056
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:31,980
Exactly. It's all about the massage controllers because that's a thing.

1057
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:38,620
That's right. Exactly. All right. So we have that to look forward to as much as we tease it,

1058
01:00:38,620 --> 01:00:44,060
you know, they're like, there are a few like real diamonds that turn out of these places,

1059
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:49,260
you know, and there are indie games of a level like, you know, that kind of come up through

1060
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:53,260
these ranks. Like, uh, like Stardew Valley was an indie game. That's, you know, huge everywhere

1061
01:00:53,260 --> 01:00:57,740
now. Five nights at Freddy's was made in a game creator software thing. And I was huge is

1062
01:00:57,740 --> 01:01:02,860
everywhere, you know? So it's not to say that just because it's this wasteland is that everything is

1063
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:07,020
going to be garbage, but you also have to rely on, you also have to recognize that some of the

1064
01:01:07,020 --> 01:01:11,740
things you may make are terrible and really shouldn't be released on a commercial platform

1065
01:01:11,740 --> 01:01:16,620
like this or anywhere at all. I wouldn't say anywhere at all. There's, there's places for it,

1066
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:20,700
but like some things that people make, like, especially if they're just like,

1067
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:25,740
I'm just going to cobble together a bunch of pre-made assets into like this very basic game

1068
01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:32,140
that doesn't really function and I'm going to sell it for money that no, don't do that.

1069
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:36,540
Please do not do that. Please do not do that. Cause they, I've seen plenty of those games

1070
01:01:36,540 --> 01:01:43,340
covered. There's plenty of them on steam and they're garbage and it just, you're better than

1071
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:50,460
that. To register participation for this week's episode of orange lounge radio at vognetwork.com

1072
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:57,340
use the passphrase sword as 200. Matt says the techno kitten adventure games. I'll remember when

1073
01:01:57,340 --> 01:02:02,380
that was new and shiny and fun. Whatever happened to that? I think he's, I feel like he sold it to

1074
01:02:02,380 --> 01:02:07,100
somebody else. Yeah. They kind of, they kind of ran it in the ground. All right. Anyway,

1075
01:02:07,820 --> 01:02:10,620
let's move on. Dar Sakura. How about a, how about a different story?

1076
01:02:11,740 --> 01:02:21,260
Yes. Um, well, I, um, I brought this up when we talked to Bobby, but do you remember the, um,

1077
01:02:21,260 --> 01:02:26,940
the Metroid two remake, um, that Nintendo requested to be taken down?

1078
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:31,740
Of course I do. Cause I was, you know, well, I would say I was mad, but it's one of those

1079
01:02:31,740 --> 01:02:35,260
things where it's like, well, we were just all waiting to see how long it was going to take.

1080
01:02:35,260 --> 01:02:38,300
Am I right? But it's on the internet, so it's always on the internet. That's right.

1081
01:02:39,820 --> 01:02:45,660
Well, um, the, uh, creator of this fan game, Milton, I'm going to mispronounce last name

1082
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:56,620
glass. Um, just got hired by, uh, moon studios to work on, um, the sequel to Ori and the blind

1083
01:02:56,620 --> 01:03:05,100
forest. So, which is going to be called Ori and the will of the wisps. So that's pretty cool. Um,

1084
01:03:06,460 --> 01:03:13,340
basically they really like what they did. They said he was a quote, incredible talent. And, uh,

1085
01:03:14,060 --> 01:03:20,940
he passed whatever test that they gave him with flying colors and decided to, uh, hire him because

1086
01:03:21,020 --> 01:03:27,980
he quote gets it. So kind of a happy ending in a way. I mean, what's interesting about Ori too,

1087
01:03:27,980 --> 01:03:32,300
is that it's, it's a bit of a Metroidvania type of game in itself. I mean, obviously it has a very

1088
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:36,140
different look to it and the way it plays and everything, but it's a bit of a Metroidvania game.

1089
01:03:36,140 --> 01:03:44,780
So it's not too off the beaten path from Metroid. So interesting how there was a legitimacy to this

1090
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:50,140
game, like big time. And now this guy has a career out of it, which it isn't the first,

1091
01:03:50,140 --> 01:03:55,260
well, I don't know about fan games like this, but I'm thinking about like, um,

1092
01:03:55,260 --> 01:04:00,940
well I think in mods, like obviously like Dota 2 came from even that, like the Skyrim mods and

1093
01:04:00,940 --> 01:04:05,820
stuff. They've had a lot of people that made some of the major Skyrim mods or even, I think even

1094
01:04:05,820 --> 01:04:11,580
more for that oblivion mods that went on to make, you know, other things for the game, like worked

1095
01:04:11,580 --> 01:04:16,380
on some of the expansions and stuff, or now because Bethesda is pushing it, they can make

1096
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:24,380
that paid DLC mods shit that they're doing. Don't forget that. That's still a thing. Thank you,

1097
01:04:24,380 --> 01:04:34,700
Bethesda. Well, I think, you know what though? Good for him. He was able to take a bad situation

1098
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:39,820
for him. I mean, a cease and desist is no fun and turning it into something good. So congrats.

1099
01:04:39,820 --> 01:04:44,940
And a lot of us already downloaded the remake. Exactly. You didn't really stop anybody,

1100
01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:49,180
but okay. Wink, wink, nudge, nudge. All right, moving on. Logie.

1101
01:04:49,180 --> 01:04:55,580
So Capcom just recently released Mega Man Legacy Collection 2. And with that, of course,

1102
01:04:55,580 --> 01:05:01,740
like the last one, they had like an art gallery, which featured concept art from various games that

1103
01:05:01,740 --> 01:05:06,780
were featured in the collection. However, there was one piece of artwork that was filed under

1104
01:05:06,780 --> 01:05:11,180
Mega Man 8 that people were like, wait a second. This doesn't look like anything that was in Mega

1105
01:05:11,180 --> 01:05:17,660
Man 8. What the hell is this? And so people are wondering that this may not actually be Mega Man

1106
01:05:17,660 --> 01:05:23,740
8. It may be something that's for another Mega Man game, because the art style for one is not,

1107
01:05:23,740 --> 01:05:30,140
doesn't resemble Mega Man 8. It actually resembles character design from like the Mega Man Battle

1108
01:05:30,140 --> 01:05:35,420
Network games. And so it kind of features Mega Man with this giant kind of segmented hand

1109
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:41,500
instead of his, you know, you know, Buster arm or something like that. So that's kind of neat.

1110
01:05:43,180 --> 01:05:46,780
Hopefully it's a teaser for a new game. I don't know. I mean,

1111
01:05:48,300 --> 01:05:52,220
who knows what it is? And Capcom's made mistakes before, so.

1112
01:05:52,220 --> 01:05:57,180
Or was it just something where they were making a different game? Because, you know, obviously

1113
01:05:57,900 --> 01:06:02,140
between Mega Man 6 and 7, they shifted platforms, right? 7 was on the Super Nintendo. And then

1114
01:06:02,140 --> 01:06:08,060
between 7 and 8, it shifted over to PlayStation. So, and then, you know, there was a big long

1115
01:06:08,060 --> 01:06:13,980
period between 8 and 9. The series was essentially done after 8. And then it didn't, it didn't come

1116
01:06:13,980 --> 01:06:18,780
back, excuse me, until it was, oh, Retro is cool again. And the download stuff when Mega Man 9

1117
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:22,460
happened and they kind of went back to that Retro era. So maybe this was something that was being

1118
01:06:22,460 --> 01:06:26,860
planned after 8, like the first Mega Man 9 that was maybe really supposed to be a continuation,

1119
01:06:26,860 --> 01:06:31,180
that just ended up getting canned or something. Who knows? But like, we still don't know what it

1120
01:06:31,180 --> 01:06:36,380
is and people are kind of letting their minds wander. That's what it is. Fanwank! Fanwank,

1121
01:06:36,380 --> 01:06:41,500
of course. Yay! Of course. Why not? All right, moving on. Speaking of fanwank, hey, fanwank

1122
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:44,940
sometimes leads to some good things. Like, you know, again, kind of a running theme here. You

1123
01:06:44,940 --> 01:06:52,220
got the Metroid 2 guy that got the job doing Ori and the Blind Forest sequel. Well, Sonic Mania

1124
01:06:52,220 --> 01:06:57,100
is on its way. And if I remember right, didn't Sonic Mania kind of come from a fan project?

1125
01:06:57,100 --> 01:07:03,580
Yeah, it's a fan made game, actually. Yeah. So Sonic Mania is now a legit SEGA release that's

1126
01:07:03,580 --> 01:07:08,220
about to happen. And that's pretty cool. In fact, part of Sonic Mania, which is coming out,

1127
01:07:08,220 --> 01:07:13,660
it's coming out next week for almost everybody, except the PC version got delayed a couple more

1128
01:07:13,660 --> 01:07:19,580
weeks. But they're doing this thing where if you had already preordered it, you get Sonic 1 for

1129
01:07:19,580 --> 01:07:23,820
free on Steam or you get a key to give to somebody else if you already have it. Like, they're trying

1130
01:07:23,820 --> 01:07:27,820
to really apologize for that. But I guess some of the optimizations have to be tweaked out.

1131
01:07:27,820 --> 01:07:32,300
Looks good. Yeah, no, it does look really good. Have you seen the intro yet? Yeah, I have. I want

1132
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:37,260
to check it out. Yeah, the intro looks fantastic. I mean, this is like this is how you put together

1133
01:07:37,260 --> 01:07:41,580
a Sonic game. Yeah, I'm excited to try it. And then I don't know if you saw this, you see some

1134
01:07:41,580 --> 01:07:45,900
of the video of the competitive multiplayer, because it looks exactly like it did in like

1135
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:50,700
Sonic 2 with like the squeezy screen and everything like that. So yeah, you can actually challenge

1136
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:57,820
your friends locally and play that. So that's that's really cool. So in fact, I'm trying to

1137
01:07:57,820 --> 01:08:00,620
see if I can get a picture of it here in the studio for you guys. Yeah, there it is. So you

1138
01:08:00,620 --> 01:08:05,420
can see it's like squishy, like the old like it used to look when you play Sonic 2 on the TV. So

1139
01:08:05,420 --> 01:08:10,860
that's really cool. So yeah, I'm excited for Sonic Mania. Darsaka, you like Sonic 2. Is this

1140
01:08:10,860 --> 01:08:15,260
something that catches your eye? You want to check this out? Maybe? All right. We talked about it.

1141
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:19,340
Yeah, it might happen. Might happen. All right. The best part about it, though, is it's not a

1142
01:08:19,340 --> 01:08:25,340
full price game either. It's only $19.99. I like that. The price is right. And it's polished.

1143
01:08:25,980 --> 01:08:30,140
For sure. All right. Just a few more stories for you guys than the classic Game of the Week.

1144
01:08:30,140 --> 01:08:37,500
Darsaka? Well, you know, when we were kids, didn't you ever want to live in an arcade?

1145
01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:43,260
Sure. I could just crawl in a Star Wars sit down cabinet and just sleep there, right?

1146
01:08:43,260 --> 01:08:47,020
Hey, what would except those Chuck E. Cheese animatronics are kind of creepy.

1147
01:08:47,660 --> 01:08:52,540
Oh, yeah. No, that that would have been hell. Yeah. People probably don't. The kids today

1148
01:08:52,540 --> 01:08:56,220
probably don't have that fantasy because now we know that those animatronics come

1149
01:08:56,220 --> 01:09:04,860
alive at night and will kill you. Exactly. So maybe maybe kids today don't have that

1150
01:09:04,860 --> 01:09:08,460
fantasy like we used to have Darsira. Yeah. Well, anyway, it was reported by

1151
01:09:08,460 --> 01:09:16,700
Kobe Shimbun that a 30 year old person named Maihara Kazuki was arrested for trespassing

1152
01:09:17,260 --> 01:09:23,500
after they found him living between arcade cabinets at a game center in Kobe.

1153
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:28,780
Between arcade cabinets? Well, yeah, I would reckon, you know, or maybe like how they have

1154
01:09:28,780 --> 01:09:37,020
some of them in a row, like a long row or in the circular setup, like some of the I mean,

1155
01:09:37,180 --> 01:09:42,940
I've never, of course, been to Kobe, much less a game center in Kobe. So I'm not sure.

1156
01:09:44,620 --> 01:09:49,420
But the same guy was also accused of robbery, having broken into a local junior high

1157
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:55,900
and to steal money in P.E. uniforms. You know what, though? Those are being sold

1158
01:09:55,900 --> 01:10:02,140
to perverts. Well, no, hold up, because the girls bloomers maybe or it sounds like this guy might

1159
01:10:02,140 --> 01:10:07,660
just be homeless. And maybe that's how he was finding clothes to wear. You know, like, I don't

1160
01:10:07,660 --> 01:10:11,660
want to be at all like Debbie Downer, but this kind of sounds like this is a little more about

1161
01:10:11,660 --> 01:10:16,140
some guy who was just, you know, doing questionable things in the eyes of the law because he was

1162
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:21,180
homeless as what it's what it's what it appears to be. Of course, I don't know any of the facts.

1163
01:10:21,180 --> 01:10:27,740
We stole about one point to three million yen, which is right. A little over eleven grand.

1164
01:10:28,460 --> 01:10:39,340
So. But yeah, I can't know. Yeah. Living in an arcade, probably not a good way to be

1165
01:10:40,460 --> 01:10:46,620
unnoticed, probably. Yeah. So unless I don't know if I was a Dave and Busters, I would crawl in that

1166
01:10:46,620 --> 01:10:51,180
giant life sized crane machine. I think that would be the place for it. But yes, the stuffed

1167
01:10:51,180 --> 01:10:56,220
animals would keep me warm. Exactly. We hide. So there you go anyway. All right. Well, look, I hope

1168
01:10:56,220 --> 01:11:02,700
this guy is OK and gets whatever help he needs. So we'll see. All right. Moving on. How about how

1169
01:11:02,700 --> 01:11:07,420
about how about something else about the police? Loki, let's let's keep let's keep a theme going

1170
01:11:07,420 --> 01:11:11,980
here. Who else got arrested? So there's a company that's in Santa Clara, California,

1171
01:11:12,540 --> 01:11:17,340
um, by the name of the coin up store. And they were selling counterfeit

1172
01:11:18,460 --> 01:11:27,020
Pac-Man and Galaga and tank battalion machines. So they were creating forgeries of those and

1173
01:11:27,020 --> 01:11:35,420
selling them as new. And apparently they were also selling cabinets containing 60 to 3000 counterfeit

1174
01:11:35,420 --> 01:11:39,980
games preload on them, which I mean, like, fuck, there's like so many retailers out there that sell

1175
01:11:39,980 --> 01:11:45,660
the multi cart things. Wasn't one of the people arrested in Folsom, which is here locally,

1176
01:11:45,660 --> 01:11:48,940
not that far from almost feel like when I read that story, like, because there's a whole group

1177
01:11:48,940 --> 01:11:55,900
of people all throughout California. I know there's a I know there's a a kind of a main cabinet

1178
01:11:55,900 --> 01:12:01,020
classic arcade in quotes, you know, company that is in full. Yes. And one of the people arrested

1179
01:12:01,020 --> 01:12:05,660
was in Folsom because they do sell those multi cars. Fuck, I had one. I bought one of those

1180
01:12:05,660 --> 01:12:11,820
carts for Neo Geo 60 to 60 in one cart for my arcade cabinet when I got in it.

1181
01:12:11,820 --> 01:12:17,740
Well, I, I remember, okay, I was looking for, I think at some point I got a bug where I was

1182
01:12:17,740 --> 01:12:21,420
looking for a baby Pac-Man machine. Remember I came really close. Like, remember that dark

1183
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:26,700
sucker. I actually was like, can I talk to Dan? Because I know he's really serious about this

1184
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:30,060
collecting and, and remember there was one, I was like really serious about cause it was here

1185
01:12:30,060 --> 01:12:34,220
locally and I almost did it. But when I was looking for that and then I ultimately decided

1186
01:12:34,220 --> 01:12:38,860
not to do it because there would have been a big risk involved with that. Um, I was looking at

1187
01:12:38,860 --> 01:12:43,500
maybe a cocktail machine, right? Cause those are those cocktail cabinets, right? The sit down ones,

1188
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:47,660
right? Cause I remember there was a yogurt store when I was growing up that had like a Ms. Pac-Man

1189
01:12:47,660 --> 01:12:51,580
cocktail and a time pilot cocktail. So I'd like to have one of those. I think it would be fun.

1190
01:12:51,580 --> 01:12:56,060
Um, yeah, so it was one person, one of the individuals was from Folsom. Yeah. So I was

1191
01:12:56,060 --> 01:13:03,100
like, so I was looking for cocktail cabinets and like a whole bunch of this, like 60 games,

1192
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:07,500
3000 games, all this stuff was coming up and it was being sold in Folsom. And I was like,

1193
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:11,580
Oh, that's not that far from here at all. Somebody must be putting together main cabinets and selling

1194
01:13:11,580 --> 01:13:16,780
them in Folsom. Yeah. Those are the ones he was selling was actually main cabinets. These are,

1195
01:13:17,820 --> 01:13:21,580
the thing is like, well, typically some are legit. You can do like an ultra,

1196
01:13:21,580 --> 01:13:27,740
there's an ultra K type thing that's legit. So I'm not saying that all these multi games and,

1197
01:13:27,740 --> 01:13:32,780
you know, one things are not legit. There's plenty of these ultra cadence things. I think even Costco

1198
01:13:32,780 --> 01:13:36,140
sold something like this for a while. I want to say, um, you know, like websites,

1199
01:13:37,260 --> 01:13:44,700
there's several like arcade game websites that sell legit cabinets. Like when I was looking for

1200
01:13:44,700 --> 01:13:49,260
like, um, DVR cabinets and stuff, there's some websites that it'll sell those and they'll sell

1201
01:13:49,260 --> 01:13:58,220
these multi-cart things, which aren't legit, but you know, I don't know. Uh, Stoppy in chat says

1202
01:13:58,220 --> 01:14:02,060
Folsom. Well, at least they won't have to travel far. I think that's a, might be a joke about the

1203
01:14:02,060 --> 01:14:05,900
prison that they have in Folsom, which is kind of infamous because of a certain country,

1204
01:14:05,900 --> 01:14:11,340
Western singer that, uh, did a very famous concert there. Um, but, um, yeah, I mean,

1205
01:14:11,900 --> 01:14:15,580
well, all those, usually, uh, if I don't know, would that be considered a federal offense at

1206
01:14:15,580 --> 01:14:19,020
that point? Because they were selling those cabinets probably all across the country.

1207
01:14:19,740 --> 01:14:24,700
Um, because the federal offense, I think gets you taken somewhere else. I don't know. All right.

1208
01:14:25,580 --> 01:14:30,780
Well, anyway. All right. Uh, let's move on. I got one more story for you guys before we get to the

1209
01:14:30,780 --> 01:14:37,260
classic game of the week. And this is about a classic game of sorts in itself. Uh, Blizzard

1210
01:14:37,260 --> 01:14:44,140
is working on apparently still Warcraft three. That's right. 15 years after the release of

1211
01:14:44,140 --> 01:14:50,300
Warcraft three, there are some changes coming to Warcraft three. There is a public test realm

1212
01:14:50,300 --> 01:14:56,620
that is being, uh, I guess piloted for Warcraft three. Uh, so this is going to be testing new map

1213
01:14:56,620 --> 01:15:01,500
pools for one versus one, two V two, three V three and four V four multiplayer. There's also

1214
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:07,020
supposed to be updates that address slow matchmaking. I, I can't imagine there's tons.

1215
01:15:07,020 --> 01:15:11,100
I guess there, I guess Warcraft three probably is slow matchmaking compared to like when that

1216
01:15:11,100 --> 01:15:16,060
originally came out over dial up. Most people probably, I think your expectations are maybe

1217
01:15:16,060 --> 01:15:21,500
a little too high. I guess there's probably still a big enough audience for this though.

1218
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:26,700
Probably especially globally. Sometimes I have to remind myself that in other countries,

1219
01:15:27,260 --> 01:15:30,860
sometimes the technology and everything, cause the computers might not be as easy to get as

1220
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:34,220
they are here. So sometimes like, you know, especially in other countries,

1221
01:15:34,220 --> 01:15:36,940
this stuff is still popular. So I think that's something I have to remind myself.

1222
01:15:36,940 --> 01:15:42,300
Um, but anyway, some updates that address slow matchmaking, lag, automated tournaments and

1223
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:48,300
ladder board, all of this being planned as well. Now, to be fair, Blizzard did patch

1224
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:54,540
not that long ago, Diablo two, I think was patched. So this isn't unheard of for Blizzard

1225
01:15:54,540 --> 01:15:58,860
to go back and update old games, but it is still kind of one of those. Wow. A public test realm

1226
01:15:58,860 --> 01:16:03,340
for a game that's that old must be a testament to the staying power of things like this. Right?

1227
01:16:04,220 --> 01:16:06,860
For sure. It's also good. A lot of good will for your company

1228
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:13,340
in the year that you're releasing a Starcraft makeover, let us not forget. Blizzard is doing

1229
01:16:13,340 --> 01:16:18,540
this Starcraft HD. Uh, they don't want to call it a remake because they're, they're,

1230
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:24,140
they're swearing by it is Starcraft. The only thing we have changed is the graphics pretty much

1231
01:16:24,140 --> 01:16:29,180
so that, but that whole release is out this year too. So something to look forward to,

1232
01:16:29,180 --> 01:16:35,100
maybe this is to, uh, well make people aware of that. I mean, retro is nice and all, but

1233
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:39,820
the kind of, it's like the Hollywood, okay, we run out of ideas. Let's just remake everything.

1234
01:16:40,620 --> 01:16:45,340
Well, but Starcraft is kind of in its own league. I mean, even with Starcraft two,

1235
01:16:45,340 --> 01:16:50,140
the original Starcraft is still as big as it is. You know what I mean? So yeah,

1236
01:16:50,140 --> 01:16:54,940
there's that to consider. All right. Well, speaking of classic games like Warcraft three,

1237
01:16:56,860 --> 01:17:01,500
it's time for the classic game of the week. And I think our soccer found a game that's even older.

1238
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:07,020
So she's going to step into the game and find a game that she thinks is worthy of your attention

1239
01:17:07,020 --> 01:17:13,660
this week. Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week this week? The New Zealand story.

1240
01:17:14,860 --> 01:17:20,140
Have you ever heard of it? I have. I don't know if I want to spoil how I heard, but it was in a,

1241
01:17:20,860 --> 01:17:24,940
it was in a retro game collection I had on Xbox, basically. I think it was Xbox. Well,

1242
01:17:24,940 --> 01:17:29,740
the New Zealand story came out in 1988 in the arcades and it was developed and published by

1243
01:17:29,740 --> 01:17:38,540
Taito. You play as a kiwi named Tiki, a little kiwi bird, who has to save his girlfriend Fifi

1244
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:46,540
and other kiwi friends who have been kiwi napped by a blue leopard seal.

1245
01:17:47,740 --> 01:17:55,020
And so you have to go through the levels, which are kind of mazish and trap different or rescue

1246
01:17:55,020 --> 01:18:04,140
different kiwis that are trapped in the cage. So you basically have to get Tiki through the level,

1247
01:18:04,860 --> 01:18:12,860
avoiding fire and spice because Tiki only takes one hit, and save each of his little kiwi friends.

1248
01:18:13,420 --> 01:18:19,260
And you get different weaponry. You can get arrows, but you also can change them into bombs,

1249
01:18:19,820 --> 01:18:24,780
lasers, or bouncing fireballs because, as we know, kiwi are known for their projectiles.

1250
01:18:25,980 --> 01:18:28,860
Yes, I was, I was just thinking about that the other day, actually.

1251
01:18:29,900 --> 01:18:36,540
Um, but each of these, um, weapons have, of course, different, uh, different abilities. You also

1252
01:18:36,540 --> 01:18:43,740
can ride different vehicles, like balloons, blimps, and UFOs, because also, a little known fact,

1253
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:52,300
kiwi travel to outer space a lot. Anyway. And you can steal them, so kiwi are also notorious vehicle

1254
01:18:52,300 --> 01:19:00,380
thieves. Um, look out for them kiwis. The levels are pretty big. Um, they scroll in multiple

1255
01:19:00,380 --> 01:19:08,300
directions. You have to explore all over the place. Um, just really, really expansive. Um,

1256
01:19:08,300 --> 01:19:14,300
and you have warp portals as well that take you to hidden parts of the game. And then, um,

1257
01:19:15,900 --> 01:19:20,620
you sometimes, if you get killed by a projectile weapon in later levels, you get spent,

1258
01:19:20,620 --> 01:19:28,700
you get sent to heaven, because all good kiwis go to heaven. Um. Where do bad kiwis go? Up your

1259
01:19:28,700 --> 01:19:36,220
butt. You also can get a special, um, ending for playing through the heaven rod of the game.

1260
01:19:37,100 --> 01:19:43,500
Um, there were, um. What the hell? I'm sorry, he just got eaten by a whale. Yeah. He had to

1261
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:49,740
shoot his way out of the whale. Yeah. What kind of drugs are these people on? Pinocchio drugs.

1262
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:57,340
Well, let's see. The kiwi's real name is Jonah. There we go. Um, you also, though, have, like,

1263
01:19:57,340 --> 01:20:02,140
some things that we've seen in other games. If you take too long to clean the level, you get a hurry

1264
01:20:02,140 --> 01:20:08,540
up warning, and you can get a power up by collecting letters that spell extend, like from Bubble

1265
01:20:08,540 --> 01:20:17,980
Bobble. Um, the game did have conversions, um, to other, uh, to, uh, home units. Um,

1266
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:27,660
Ocean Software did computer versions, um, as well. There was the, um, NES version was put up by

1267
01:20:28,460 --> 01:20:35,500
Software Creations, um, and, uh, it was published, um, in the PAL regions by Ocean.

1268
01:20:36,220 --> 01:20:43,420
Um, but in North America, it was released, sorry, published by Taito as Kiwi Craze,

1269
01:20:43,420 --> 01:20:50,780
with a K, instead of the New Zealand story. Um, it was also included in the Amiga 500 Batman pack

1270
01:20:51,340 --> 01:20:57,020
that came out in September 1989. Because Kiwi teams up with Batman, apparently. And rides UFOs

1271
01:20:57,020 --> 01:21:04,300
and steals things. Um, we did have conversions that came out on the FM Towns and the Sharp

1272
01:21:04,380 --> 01:21:09,660
X68000 systems. Um, there was a Sega Mega Drive version that only came out in Japan,

1273
01:21:10,300 --> 01:21:16,380
um, that was based off of the prototype version of the arcade game. And then, in more recent days,

1274
01:21:16,380 --> 01:21:24,060
we've had the Taito Legends pack that brought it out for Xbox, PS2, and PSP, and PC. That's

1275
01:21:24,060 --> 01:21:29,580
where I played it, finally. It was the Taito Legends pack, yeah. The PC Engine port, um,

1276
01:21:29,580 --> 01:21:38,540
was released for Wii Virtual Console in Japan. Um, Tiki the Kiwi also appears in other Taito

1277
01:21:38,540 --> 01:21:46,620
games, such as Liquid Kids, Bubble Symphony, and also, uh, Fifi is in Bubble Symphony,

1278
01:21:46,620 --> 01:21:52,300
and Pop and Pop. And let's be real, oughta be a character in Smash Brothers, am I right?

1279
01:21:52,300 --> 01:22:00,860
With his stealing of things. Yes. And bombs. Um, the game was remade, um, in, uh, 2007 by

1280
01:22:00,860 --> 01:22:08,300
Rising Star Games as an Nintendo DS remake titled New Zealand Story Revolution, um, came out in

1281
01:22:08,300 --> 01:22:18,700
Australia and Europe. In North America, it was, uh, published, um, hold on, yeah, as New Zealand

1282
01:22:19,660 --> 01:22:25,820
Story Revolution as well. In Japan, it was released as New Zealand Story DS. And it has,

1283
01:22:25,820 --> 01:22:31,980
it uses the dual screens for showing you different areas, and you use the touch screen to open doors,

1284
01:22:31,980 --> 01:22:40,460
and, uh, use secret buttons, or actually flicking Tiki to safety. Um, you also have a four player

1285
01:22:40,460 --> 01:22:46,620
wireless mode, um, normal and expert game modes, and, um, better graphics and better background

1286
01:22:46,620 --> 01:22:55,740
music. Um, Tiki can also take several hits and can shoot at an angle. Um, the game was considered,

1287
01:22:55,740 --> 01:23:04,540
uh, pretty well across the board, considered addicting, although, um, the, uh, Sinclair versions,

1288
01:23:04,540 --> 01:23:13,100
or sorry, the ZX Spectrum versions were considered not as great. Um, the Nintendo DS1 received

1289
01:23:13,740 --> 01:23:21,900
pretty average reception, um, but they said that some of the special, uh, features they put in it

1290
01:23:21,900 --> 01:23:28,620
were poorly implemented. And there you go. All right, there it is, your classic game of the week,

1291
01:23:28,620 --> 01:23:33,340
the New Zealand story. I think that we should adopt, um, was it actually from New Zealand,

1292
01:23:33,340 --> 01:23:38,540
though? He was a Kiwi. That's about as, unless hobbits run by, I won't believe it. I just feel

1293
01:23:38,540 --> 01:23:42,460
like it might be false advertising, that this story was not actually from New Zealand. Maybe

1294
01:23:42,460 --> 01:23:48,140
we should adopt Tiki as our mascot. But we have the ferret. The ferret is dead.

1295
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:55,340
I actually do have another ferret somewhere, somewhere. We'll have to find that and bring

1296
01:23:55,340 --> 01:24:01,020
that. There was like four or five of them at one time. There was the wolf ferret and like the,

1297
01:24:01,020 --> 01:24:05,260
the other ferret, they weren't really ferrets, but they were, I'm sure there's one in a box somewhere.

1298
01:24:05,260 --> 01:24:08,700
I'm going to order another one. And like a Nintendog, it will still be there waiting for

1299
01:24:08,700 --> 01:24:15,100
me when I find it. I found one of my Nintendog swag from E3. Like it still has the little like

1300
01:24:15,100 --> 01:24:20,060
card on it and everything. We'll stab it and say for the watch. All right, look, we're going to

1301
01:24:20,060 --> 01:24:24,700
take a break. When we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, rapid fire news and what?

1302
01:24:25,260 --> 01:24:29,660
It is a well-known fact that a Tiki do carry an arrow to dinner.

1303
01:24:32,460 --> 01:24:37,180
We'll be back with more of such wit here at Orange Lounge Radio,

1304
01:24:37,180 --> 01:24:41,820
your calls as well at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype and any emails. I don't know if we got

1305
01:24:41,820 --> 01:24:45,900
any, but we'll do any emails we have. When we come back after this quick break with more of

1306
01:24:45,900 --> 01:24:57,260
Orange Lounge Radio, right after this. Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge

1307
01:24:57,260 --> 01:25:04,220
Radio. Live tonight, episode number 696 for this, August the 13th of 2017.

1308
01:25:05,180 --> 01:25:09,900
Wow. We're looking almost at episode number 700 coming up in a few weeks. It's probably,

1309
01:25:09,900 --> 01:25:14,460
let's see next week is 7, 696, 698. Then after Dragon Con is gonna be 699. So it's gonna be

1310
01:25:14,460 --> 01:25:18,380
about mid September would be episode number 700 at this point, if you can believe it.

1311
01:25:19,740 --> 01:25:23,180
Yeah, it's coming up that quick. What was supposed to be, it would have been the week before Dragon

1312
01:25:23,180 --> 01:25:27,980
Con. I think if we had, you know, the hiatus hadn't happened. So, yeah, that sounds about right,

1313
01:25:27,980 --> 01:25:32,780
mid September. So we'll have to see if we can do anything special for. I should talk to our pals

1314
01:25:32,860 --> 01:25:36,860
over at the, the square one thing and see if we can do like a live thing. I think it would be fun

1315
01:25:36,860 --> 01:25:40,220
so that we could open it up and have some people show up. Would anybody show up though? I don't

1316
01:25:40,220 --> 01:25:45,020
know. We'll see. There's gotta be some, we'll have to invite some people like, Hey, you should come.

1317
01:25:45,020 --> 01:25:48,860
So we'll get some game bang or something. Yeah, yeah, sure. Why not? Why some of our local

1318
01:25:48,860 --> 01:25:53,580
podcasting pals? Why not? I think it would be fun. I think they just, they actually specifically,

1319
01:25:53,580 --> 01:25:59,740
I think 100 or 200. Yeah. So yeah, just recently. So congrats to them. Cool. Awesome. Yeah. Good

1320
01:25:59,820 --> 01:26:04,940
for them. That's a, there's not a lot of shows that get past 10. Let me tell you. So good,

1321
01:26:04,940 --> 01:26:11,820
good for them. Fat pokey stop. I think barely got past 10. All right. Let's get into some rapid

1322
01:26:11,820 --> 01:26:17,900
fire news. Oh yeah. Good. Thank you. Chatters. Act Def points out just in time for Loki's birthday.

1323
01:26:18,540 --> 01:26:23,740
That's right. That would be right. Can't have episode six, six, six, but I'll take 700.

1324
01:26:23,740 --> 01:26:28,700
There you go. Why not? Actually is your birthday on a Sunday this year? It's on a Monday. Oh act.

1325
01:26:28,700 --> 01:26:33,580
Oh no, that's a six 99 is going to be the 10th. So it would be a, I think September 17th is the

1326
01:26:33,580 --> 01:26:36,540
date we're looking at because September 3rd is going to be when I'm away at dragon con. So

1327
01:26:36,540 --> 01:26:41,740
it looks like it'll be September 17th. So I'm sick again. Yeah. Unless who knows what might

1328
01:26:41,740 --> 01:26:46,380
happen, but let's, let's not think like that. Let's think instead about some rapid fire news.

1329
01:26:46,380 --> 01:26:52,780
Loki. All right. So this was kind of an unexpected gift, I guess, but rez rez infinite made its way

1330
01:26:52,780 --> 01:26:59,340
out to PC this week. Um, it's pretty cool and totally unexpected, but yeah, they have it now.

1331
01:26:59,340 --> 01:27:04,860
It's available on steam. You can get it at 1999. They include a course, you know, the bonus DLC,

1332
01:27:04,860 --> 01:27:11,500
which is that area area X, which doesn't really bonus DLC. It's kind of included with the game,

1333
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:17,580
but you know, whatever. Um, it does also support VR. Um, and of course being that's PC 60 FPS

1334
01:27:17,580 --> 01:27:24,620
gameplay and 4k resolution, uh, compatibility. Nice. Yeah. That's almost a reason to buy it

1335
01:27:24,620 --> 01:27:30,460
right there for the 4k and the, the, all that, all those mods. So, I mean, that is something

1336
01:27:30,460 --> 01:27:35,900
that's worth checking out. Um, and of course, you know, along with that, uh, some more stuff coming

1337
01:27:35,900 --> 01:27:41,420
to the switch, uh, including the Jack box party packs one and two, those will be coming on the

1338
01:27:41,420 --> 01:27:48,860
switch on the 17th. So, uh, later this week. Very soon. Very soon. Yeah. That's awesome.

1339
01:27:48,860 --> 01:27:53,340
I think those games will do very well on the switch unless people already bought them other

1340
01:27:53,340 --> 01:27:56,700
places, but I'm sure there's a new audience. Maybe they didn't. Well, they have party pack four

1341
01:27:56,700 --> 01:28:01,900
scheduled to release later this year. Yeah. They were unveiling some of the games. I guess the only

1342
01:28:01,900 --> 01:28:08,460
game coming back for the fourth one is a pivot three, three, uh, the, all the other games are

1343
01:28:08,460 --> 01:28:13,020
new. Uh, I know they were previewing one called monster seeking monster, which I thought was

1344
01:28:13,020 --> 01:28:18,620
funny. I want a sequel to the one that was that killer one effort. Trivia murder party. Yeah.

1345
01:28:18,620 --> 01:28:23,020
Trivia murder party. They can do a standalone of that. I bet like a, you don't know Jack style

1346
01:28:23,020 --> 01:28:27,500
thing. That would be a good TV show. You know how they did the, you don't know Jack thing. I think

1347
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:32,300
that would be funny. Trivia murder party would be a fun TV show. Yeah. Be like super kid. Like,

1348
01:28:32,300 --> 01:28:37,500
cause obviously you don't kill people on TV, but be like a super campy like clue type of thing.

1349
01:28:37,980 --> 01:28:41,420
I mean you can get celebrity guests or something like that. You just have it like silly.

1350
01:28:41,420 --> 01:28:45,580
Why not? Well, actually, actually now I think about it in, I don't know if you guys ever saw

1351
01:28:45,580 --> 01:28:49,100
this, Jamie, this sounds like something up your alley. You might've seen, did you know over on

1352
01:28:49,100 --> 01:28:54,060
the other side of the pond over in Britain, they had clue as it were Cluedo as they call it over

1353
01:28:54,060 --> 01:28:58,940
there. They had it as TV show. It was a full on because I'm Joanna Lumley was Ms. Peacock for

1354
01:28:58,940 --> 01:29:03,100
one season and they would actually do these full like acting scenes. And then the contestants would

1355
01:29:03,100 --> 01:29:07,100
actually like grill the contestants about what was because they were trying to solve

1356
01:29:07,100 --> 01:29:11,660
basically the murder. So, I mean, not that obviously that is totally in common with trivia

1357
01:29:11,660 --> 01:29:17,660
murder party, but, but murder on a game show on TV has been done before. That's my point.

1358
01:29:18,700 --> 01:29:23,660
It would be funny. I think it'd be funny. Yes, for sure. All right. Uh, let's see,

1359
01:29:23,660 --> 01:29:28,380
going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com. Uh, Bobby Blackwell says trivia murder party is the

1360
01:29:28,380 --> 01:29:34,060
game all my friends want to play. And I can't get it out of my head that the announcer for,

1361
01:29:34,060 --> 01:29:36,860
and this is not, everybody's going to understand this, but you're just gonna have to bear with me.

1362
01:29:36,860 --> 01:29:43,820
The announcer for trivia murder party is Travis Donovan doing the DJ Satan thing. Like it is,

1363
01:29:43,820 --> 01:29:48,060
I swear to God, like it's like every time I'm playing trivia murder party, I feel like it's

1364
01:29:48,060 --> 01:29:52,540
Travis Donovan is DJ Satan. Like makes it even better. I know it kind of does. It kind of does.

1365
01:29:52,540 --> 01:29:57,420
Uh, anyway, uh, let's see. Dark Tetsuya says, uh, does anyone remember who done it?

1366
01:29:57,420 --> 01:30:01,500
Which was like the mole, but a murder mystery. Yes. That was just a couple of years ago on ABC.

1367
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:05,980
That was a, that was a neat show. I liked that. You know, it was kind of, it kind of had a bad

1368
01:30:05,980 --> 01:30:12,700
ending though, because not to get too far into game show chat, but too late. The girl that lost,

1369
01:30:12,700 --> 01:30:18,780
that was the runner up knew who the killer was from episode one. And because she did the worst

1370
01:30:18,780 --> 01:30:25,180
in the final challenge, she got beaten by the guy who had yet to pick the right killer. So it was

1371
01:30:25,180 --> 01:30:29,740
like, it kind of got ruined by that. But anyway, sorry. I'm totally digressing into something that

1372
01:30:29,740 --> 01:30:34,060
I don't think anybody actually watched. Okay. Vid power says I watched every episode of it.

1373
01:30:34,060 --> 01:30:39,580
So you know what I'm talking about? Like the ending didn't make sense. Oh, well. Anyway.

1374
01:30:39,580 --> 01:30:44,220
Uh, it's, it seemed like, um, whoever the killer was in that show, it didn't fucking matter. Like

1375
01:30:44,220 --> 01:30:48,780
it was just about the crimes every time. Anyway. All right. I wish that show would come back

1376
01:30:48,780 --> 01:30:52,540
though. Actually the mole, since you brought it up, that's like seriously one of my all time

1377
01:30:52,540 --> 01:30:58,540
favorite game shows. And it, it really blows my mind that they can't seem to get that show

1378
01:30:58,540 --> 01:31:03,900
well-rated. I realized the original mole was kind of around, I think that the season one did fine.

1379
01:31:03,900 --> 01:31:09,820
And then season two happened right around nine 11. So it got, cause Anderson Cooper hosted it

1380
01:31:09,820 --> 01:31:15,420
and it was like, it was sassy Anderson Cooper, like rolling my eyes in a GIF Anderson Cooper

1381
01:31:15,420 --> 01:31:18,940
that was hosting that show. And that's what made it so awesome. So then they tried to bring it

1382
01:31:18,940 --> 01:31:23,500
back with like a couple of celebrity versions. Kathy Griffin was on one, which was great,

1383
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:28,300
but then they did, um, they had like another season with, I think they had a sports commentator

1384
01:31:28,300 --> 01:31:32,940
guy hosting and it just, it just wasn't the same. It wasn't the same. They need to get a SAS master

1385
01:31:32,940 --> 01:31:37,500
to host the mole and bring it back. Cause that show is bomb. So it was awesome.

1386
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:41,260
We can get William Shatner, the hosted like he did rescue nine one one.

1387
01:31:41,260 --> 01:31:46,140
Why? I don't know about, we don't have, we don't have, we are Robert stack. He would have been,

1388
01:31:46,140 --> 01:31:50,060
you know, perfect. I don't know who a good host for the mole would be. Why not? Let's,

1389
01:31:50,060 --> 01:31:53,980
let's let a lady try it. You know, it's been, it's been a bunch of guys. Why not? Let's let

1390
01:31:53,980 --> 01:31:58,620
a lady try it and maybe it can be a little, uh, little, um, sassy with it. I don't know.

1391
01:31:58,620 --> 01:32:04,300
I just don't know who I would see in that role. Aisha Tyler. Yeah. Aisha Tyler. Why not? That's

1392
01:32:04,300 --> 01:32:10,780
my go-to game show host. Cause she does great with, um, uh, the whose line is it anyway? Yeah.

1393
01:32:10,780 --> 01:32:14,860
There you go. That's there. I think I used to Tyler for a reboot of the mole cause she can be

1394
01:32:14,860 --> 01:32:19,020
funny, but doesn't like, doesn't have to be funny. You know what I mean? She can kind of

1395
01:32:19,020 --> 01:32:23,740
play it serious, but anyway, all right, I'm going way too far down this rabbit hole with

1396
01:32:23,740 --> 01:32:29,500
H. John Benjamin. So we can just get the, the Lana and Archer back and forth. Uh, let's see,

1397
01:32:29,500 --> 01:32:35,260
uh, looking at chat over at live.voggenetwork.com. Uh, some folks are, okay. I'm, I'm glad that folks

1398
01:32:35,260 --> 01:32:40,060
are with the change in here because Bobby Black Wolf says John Barrowman. Okay. Now talk about

1399
01:32:40,060 --> 01:32:44,380
a SaaS master and then Bobby Black Wolf also mentioned Aisha Tyler. So we're, we're, I guess,

1400
01:32:44,380 --> 01:32:50,460
uh, we're on the same page here. Let's see. A vid power says a SaaS Anderson Cooper was great.

1401
01:32:50,460 --> 01:32:54,860
Absolutely. The mole was great before it became celebrity moles as Kaijuto and Kaijuto says,

1402
01:32:54,860 --> 01:33:01,340
I will only settle for a Brit as the host of the mole. What about Anne Robinson from the

1403
01:33:01,340 --> 01:33:06,060
weakest link? What the hell is she doing anymore? I don't know, but she does. She had that one thing

1404
01:33:06,700 --> 01:33:10,700
where whatever happened to her, right? I don't know. You guys don't remember the weakest link,

1405
01:33:10,700 --> 01:33:15,820
right? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think it ran longer overseas in Britain than it did here, but it was,

1406
01:33:15,820 --> 01:33:20,060
it was big for like a hot minute here. Like that same year survivor blew up here in the U S which

1407
01:33:20,060 --> 01:33:25,180
is still on all these years later. Like the, the weakest link was huge for like two years.

1408
01:33:25,180 --> 01:33:29,900
And then it was kind of on that. Who wants to, who wants to be a millionaire still thing? I mean,

1409
01:33:29,900 --> 01:33:35,100
I think that's still around. It was on daytime TV. Meredith Vieira hosted it for the longest time.

1410
01:33:35,100 --> 01:33:39,100
And then I want to say it went to Cedric the entertainer was hosting it, but I don't know if

1411
01:33:39,100 --> 01:33:42,700
it's still doing new episodes and I might be wrong on the host. I don't know. It's like

1412
01:33:42,700 --> 01:33:47,900
in syndication, but like it was kind of building off of that hype. So, yeah. Yeah. So there you go.

1413
01:33:47,900 --> 01:33:56,380
Oh, Raging. Oh, Ragingator says Greg Proops. Yes. Ragingator, that might be the best comment you've

1414
01:33:56,380 --> 01:34:02,460
ever made on this program. He should host it doing the voice he does for Karl Lagerfeld.

1415
01:34:02,460 --> 01:34:07,180
I love it. Greg Proops is a great idea. But he has to do the Karl Lagerfeld voice.

1416
01:34:07,180 --> 01:34:11,580
Yeah. I love it. All right. Moving on. Let's move on. We got to get back into the actual

1417
01:34:11,580 --> 01:34:19,260
gaming news. Oh yes. Rapid fire news. The quickly done segments. Let's talk about Overwatch.

1418
01:34:19,260 --> 01:34:24,700
Speaking of death, uh, coming to Overwatch is, uh, death matches coming to Overwatch.

1419
01:34:24,700 --> 01:34:31,340
So, um, uh, death matches are coming to Overwatch in the, uh, developer update video, uh, explained

1420
01:34:31,340 --> 01:34:37,020
that Overwatch is going to be getting free for all and team deathmatch modes. Uh, so this objective,

1421
01:34:37,020 --> 01:34:42,380
uh, like an other free, uh, or excuse me, other first person shooter games is to get more kills

1422
01:34:42,380 --> 01:34:47,980
than the opponents. Now, this is a big deal though, because Overwatch was kind of sold as

1423
01:34:47,980 --> 01:34:53,180
I am not that kind of game. And now it is that kind of, yeah, I kind of worry that it's not

1424
01:34:53,180 --> 01:34:58,700
balanced for that. It is totally isn't. I don't know how that's gonna work because like,

1425
01:34:59,180 --> 01:35:03,260
but I blame any of those fucking support characters. I know. Right. Like how is a character

1426
01:35:03,260 --> 01:35:06,300
like, I'm trying to think of somebody like, I would say mercy. I mean, mercy does have the

1427
01:35:06,300 --> 01:35:13,020
pistol, but how is a character like mercy gonna last against somebody like this? Just pure DPS,

1428
01:35:13,020 --> 01:35:17,820
like junk rat or something. You know what I mean? So I was kind of nerfed the last one.

1429
01:35:17,820 --> 01:35:22,540
You have another buffing them on the PTR. Oh my fucking God. I can't keep track of this shit.

1430
01:35:23,180 --> 01:35:28,780
But it's, it's a great, it's a great, um, it's a great game. So I mean, it's weird in a way

1431
01:35:28,780 --> 01:35:32,380
that they're doing deathmatch, but I guess it is something people have been asking for. It's not

1432
01:35:32,380 --> 01:35:38,540
like it's replacing the regular quick matches options. It's an arcade mode like Lucio ball

1433
01:35:38,540 --> 01:35:41,820
ball is now. So they're going to do, which by the way is a lot of fun. I saw that. It's like,

1434
01:35:41,820 --> 01:35:45,660
I saw a video of them. Is that a mod? Is that a completely different game? It's rocket league.

1435
01:35:47,900 --> 01:35:52,220
It's rocket league and Overwatch, but, but it works because the character of Lucio, I mean,

1436
01:35:52,220 --> 01:35:55,980
they didn't like change him or anything. They changed his ultimate. That's it to make us,

1437
01:35:55,980 --> 01:36:00,060
to make him move faster. One thing like ice in this is kind of going a totally different game

1438
01:36:00,060 --> 01:36:04,780
here. Call of duty, um, auto warfare, the remaster that they did for that. They have that whole,

1439
01:36:05,420 --> 01:36:12,300
um, I forget the modes called now, but it's the one where one round people are inanimate objects.

1440
01:36:12,300 --> 01:36:16,860
They have to hide in the map and then the other team has to go and find them and kill them.

1441
01:36:17,740 --> 01:36:21,980
That's fucking hilarious. And that alone, that mode in there makes me want to buy that game

1442
01:36:21,980 --> 01:36:26,300
because that looks so awesome. It's like new shit introduced like that. So let's Overwatch

1443
01:36:26,300 --> 01:36:32,220
add something like that. Cause well, I would like to see an Overwatch be expanded on is the, uh,

1444
01:36:32,220 --> 01:36:37,580
co-op stuff. And they did this during the uprising event. They had that little mini thing you could

1445
01:36:37,580 --> 01:36:45,340
play with. What was it? Mercy, Torbjorn, Reinhardt, somebody else soldier or something. I don't know.

1446
01:36:45,340 --> 01:36:49,260
It was like four characters that you could do. And like you did like a PVE thing and I really

1447
01:36:49,260 --> 01:36:54,300
wish they would expand on that more or maybe a single player type of experience. But, um,

1448
01:36:54,300 --> 01:36:57,660
I guess we'll have to, uh, we'll have to stay tuned to see if anything like that is in the

1449
01:36:57,660 --> 01:37:02,220
future, but yeah, death or death mat, uh, yeah, death match team death match and all that, uh,

1450
01:37:02,220 --> 01:37:06,460
is no longer off the table. It's going to be put in the game. So we, I think that just a lot of

1451
01:37:06,460 --> 01:37:10,860
people are hoping that death match doesn't influence the regular game. Like if death

1452
01:37:10,860 --> 01:37:14,860
match is there and it's completely unbalanced and ridiculous, then they just need to let it

1453
01:37:14,860 --> 01:37:20,460
stay that way. I think it's more of like, I think it's more of like to get people that may have

1454
01:37:20,460 --> 01:37:25,180
played those other types of games. So like I'm looking for something more like that in that game

1455
01:37:25,180 --> 01:37:29,420
and they'll buy it and like, Oh, Hey, this is cool. I want to try the other modes. Oh,

1456
01:37:29,420 --> 01:37:34,300
Hey, I like the regular mode. Yay. I'm in the game now. You know, it's like maybe to get people

1457
01:37:34,300 --> 01:37:39,180
from other genres and thank you for the correction in chat. You guys, it was tracer and not sold.

1458
01:37:39,180 --> 01:37:42,620
Tracer was the other, of course, tracers on the box. She's a big character. And the advisor

1459
01:37:42,620 --> 01:37:46,860
remember it was, you know, like the years ago with the beginning of the Overwatch anyway.

1460
01:37:46,860 --> 01:37:51,660
So that is something to look forward to with Overwatch. Back to Nintendo. Nintendo is going

1461
01:37:51,660 --> 01:37:57,260
to be doing a special panel at PAX West. PAX West, of course, is happening the same time as

1462
01:37:57,260 --> 01:38:01,980
DragonCon. So I haven't been talking about it as much on this show, but obviously a huge gaming

1463
01:38:01,980 --> 01:38:07,100
convention that happens in Seattle. It used to be PAX Prime, but now they are just, they, they made

1464
01:38:07,100 --> 01:38:12,300
a full compass out of it. So it's PAX West and it's going to take place September 1st to September

1465
01:38:12,300 --> 01:38:17,900
4th. And the Nintendo panel is happening on Saturday. So, um, no idea who's hosting it,

1466
01:38:17,900 --> 01:38:22,940
although I would imagine, um, it's going to be the talent, probably the tree house people,

1467
01:38:22,940 --> 01:38:29,180
because get this Charles Martinet is, uh, at DragonCon. So he's not on the panel.

1468
01:38:30,620 --> 01:38:34,380
So unless he's flying back and forth, which I guess is possible, he might only be there certain

1469
01:38:34,380 --> 01:38:39,100
days, but it's probably gonna be the tree house gang or something is doing that. Uh, or who knows

1470
01:38:39,100 --> 01:38:43,420
this is in Nintendo's backyard. Could Reggie Fils-Aime show up? Miyamoto, don't hold your

1471
01:38:43,420 --> 01:38:47,180
breath. Don't get too hyped. You'll probably be the tree house guys, but even then, oh, may,

1472
01:38:47,180 --> 01:38:53,340
might they be announcing something? Could this be a new Nintendo way of doing things? You know,

1473
01:38:53,340 --> 01:38:57,980
we've never seen them announce something. Lower those expectations, lower those expectations.

1474
01:38:57,980 --> 01:39:03,180
We still have like, does Nintendo participate in games com? Cause that's right around the corner.

1475
01:39:03,180 --> 01:39:06,940
We keep forgetting about that. No, that's true. Is that this week? Is that next week? I know it's

1476
01:39:06,940 --> 01:39:11,020
pretty soon. It's yeah, it's either this week or next week. It's before labor. There's supposed

1477
01:39:11,020 --> 01:39:15,340
to be lots of big announcements after all. Remember how Sony didn't have shit the show?

1478
01:39:15,340 --> 01:39:21,660
Yeah. They're supposed to be holding back stuff for games com. So yep. Let's hear it. Yeah. It

1479
01:39:21,660 --> 01:39:26,140
should be an exciting show. Yeah. I mean, I'd be cool. Like if they announced something, um,

1480
01:39:27,020 --> 01:39:31,020
but I'm not, I don't have like high expectations. I can see like, here's a new game mode for

1481
01:39:31,020 --> 01:39:37,980
splatoon two. Okay. Yeah. Or a new, new DLC character in arms between mustard and relish.

1482
01:39:39,900 --> 01:39:47,980
I said you guys like the ketchup. Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh. So I didn't talk about this

1483
01:39:47,980 --> 01:39:52,460
during my gaming week, but I did fucking play that splat fest, which was mayonnaise versus ketchup.

1484
01:39:52,460 --> 01:39:57,340
Right. I'm sorry. You all fucking know how I feel about mayonnaise. I fucking hate mayonnaise. I

1485
01:39:57,340 --> 01:40:03,260
hate it. It is. It is the devil's condiment. It's it's terrible. And so like, first I rolled

1486
01:40:03,260 --> 01:40:08,300
my eyes when I saw the, the, the, the matchup, because I already knew, I already knew. I said,

1487
01:40:08,860 --> 01:40:13,500
because this, this is it. Mayo's going to win. Like I just, I just know Mayo's going to win.

1488
01:40:13,500 --> 01:40:16,780
It doesn't even matter what I do or what I play when it doesn't matter. Mayo's going to fucking

1489
01:40:16,780 --> 01:40:23,020
win. Sure enough. Mayo fucking wins. But why did Mayo fucking win? Because it's delicious

1490
01:40:23,020 --> 01:40:29,100
because people actually interpreted the, the, I'm going to tell Alan to put your Starbucks in

1491
01:40:29,100 --> 01:40:33,740
the garbage and then you can dish it out of the garbage and drink it. Because if you like Mayo,

1492
01:40:33,740 --> 01:40:38,940
you probably like that too. So close to carb garbucks. Was it because people actually

1493
01:40:38,940 --> 01:40:42,700
interpreted because people are dirty little assholes and they interpreted the whole event

1494
01:40:42,700 --> 01:40:48,140
as man splooged and blood. Well, that was the, okay. So when they, when they finally were,

1495
01:40:48,140 --> 01:40:52,300
when they showed the stages and they were like, Oh no, Rob, not only are they going to use like

1496
01:40:52,300 --> 01:40:56,940
one of your least favorite food on the entire planet, but the splatting is actually going to be

1497
01:40:57,660 --> 01:41:02,620
mayonnaise and ketchup looking things. That was the only way I was able to tolerate Splatfest was

1498
01:41:02,620 --> 01:41:08,540
to tell myself it's semen versus blood. It's semen versus blood because I would rather that

1499
01:41:08,540 --> 01:41:13,980
than mayonnaise, which ought to tell you something. Anyway, here's the thing. So I was playing team

1500
01:41:13,980 --> 01:41:18,780
ketchup, right? Every single fucking match I was getting ketchup versus ketchup, ketchup versus

1501
01:41:18,780 --> 01:41:23,660
ketchup. And when I would get a matchup that was team male, it was like players that were like 13

1502
01:41:23,660 --> 01:41:29,340
levels higher than everybody on our team. So it was like, like the matchmaking in it was shit.

1503
01:41:29,340 --> 01:41:35,260
It was so bad. I was so irritated by the matchmaking. I, I, I actually know I looked

1504
01:41:35,260 --> 01:41:42,700
at my win loss ratio during Splatfest. I won 20% of the matches. And that's not even, and before

1505
01:41:42,700 --> 01:41:47,820
you team Mayo fucks come and be like, well, that's cause team Mayo is awesome. No, it's because the,

1506
01:41:47,820 --> 01:41:53,180
it's because the matchmaking sucked. And most of those matches were ketchup versus ketchup where

1507
01:41:53,180 --> 01:41:56,620
the matchmaking still sucked. Like I would be there with my team and I'd be like, all right,

1508
01:41:56,620 --> 01:42:00,300
well maybe we'll get, you know, and then the other team would pop in and it's all like double digit

1509
01:42:00,300 --> 01:42:06,860
level people. And I'm like, son of a bitch. How is this supposed to be fair? So that was irritating.

1510
01:42:06,860 --> 01:42:10,620
Nintendo network online. Can't do it. Fucking stupid.

1511
01:42:10,620 --> 01:42:15,260
That was irritating. I was so irritated. Anyway, I already knew, I already knew Mayo was going to

1512
01:42:15,340 --> 01:42:23,500
win. So I just, anyway, so we'll see what happens in the next Splatfest. In fact,

1513
01:42:23,500 --> 01:42:29,740
I was actually thinking that would be a really good listless topic for us is a future Splatfest.

1514
01:42:29,740 --> 01:42:33,740
So please look forward to it. That'll be coming in the next couple of weeks to the show.

1515
01:42:33,740 --> 01:42:40,140
What should the next Splatfest be? All right. Anyway, I don't know what else. I don't know what

1516
01:42:40,140 --> 01:42:47,660
else to say with that. So let's move on to some other rapid, our rapid fire news, news stories

1517
01:42:47,660 --> 01:42:54,220
done quickly, right? Dark Sakura, what do you have for us? Girl, I'm not even evening anymore.

1518
01:42:57,180 --> 01:43:04,940
So if you like Metroid, there's going to be a Metroid new Nintendo 3DS XL.

1519
01:43:04,940 --> 01:43:12,060
Yay. 200 bones. I might. Somebody buy me one. I might not, but I might buy myself one.

1520
01:43:13,820 --> 01:43:19,420
Jamie. I haven't bought, I haven't. Here's the amazing thing about this. No, this is important.

1521
01:43:19,420 --> 01:43:22,860
Look, I know the same. It's going away too long, but this is important. It's important.

1522
01:43:22,860 --> 01:43:28,860
What about quick? All right. So we've had this talk on OLR that I'm not convinced I need a new

1523
01:43:28,860 --> 01:43:33,900
Nintendo 3DS, right? And you don't need one. There's nothing, there's no games. I don't need

1524
01:43:33,900 --> 01:43:38,060
the super Nintendo emulation. They have what two games that require a new three. I don't need it.

1525
01:43:38,060 --> 01:43:45,740
Right. But once they unveiled this, you know what I said? It shall be mine. I need it. It's

1526
01:43:45,740 --> 01:43:53,420
the precious. I need it. So finally this whole Samus system actually come with the game.

1527
01:43:55,260 --> 01:43:58,460
I mean, it's Nintendo. Of course it doesn't. Well, I don't know. My, my, uh,

1528
01:43:58,460 --> 01:44:05,740
Zelda one did actually the Pokemon for Dan. So, but I love my Zelda 3DS. It's so pretty, but

1529
01:44:06,460 --> 01:44:13,660
Samus she's a goddess. I know the goddess of bounty hunters and squishy alien things.

1530
01:44:13,660 --> 01:44:18,380
I'm probably going to have to buy it anyway. Sorry to interrupt, but it was important.

1531
01:44:18,380 --> 01:44:23,340
And in other news that no one gives a shit about ghost writers joining Marvel versus Capcom infinite

1532
01:44:25,020 --> 01:44:27,340
because no one gives a shit about Marvel versus Capcom.

1533
01:44:27,340 --> 01:44:31,500
Yeah, I just can't. I mean, did you finally jump off that train? Did you play the demo?

1534
01:44:31,500 --> 01:44:35,980
Did you play the demo? No, I didn't. I'm just saving my, my heart for dragon ball fighters.

1535
01:44:35,980 --> 01:44:38,780
You need to play the demo so you can get that final nail in your heart.

1536
01:44:40,220 --> 01:44:46,860
Why cap calm? Why did you do this? I kept calm. Isn't worried about its fans anymore.

1537
01:44:46,860 --> 01:44:52,700
They just want to get new people and the story. So that's a thing that happened during our break.

1538
01:44:52,700 --> 01:44:57,340
Dark Sakura got off the Marvel versus Capcom bandwagon at some point.

1539
01:44:57,340 --> 01:45:00,700
I'd rather just go back and play like, like the second one.

1540
01:45:00,700 --> 01:45:04,300
I think, you know, I think, I think most people are exactly where you're at,

1541
01:45:04,300 --> 01:45:07,500
where it's like, I'll just go back and play the other one or third one.

1542
01:45:07,500 --> 01:45:12,940
Although the third one, I'm still pissed off because there's a fucking stupid bad box art.

1543
01:45:12,940 --> 01:45:18,140
Mega man. Thank you. Cap com you fucking assholes. Or I hear more people excited about the dragon

1544
01:45:18,140 --> 01:45:25,420
ball thing as well. It's a good game. I mean, Oh my God. All right. Now my turn to derail shit.

1545
01:45:25,420 --> 01:45:37,980
Fine. Someone put an animation discussion on YouTube about why it looks so good. And they,

1546
01:45:37,980 --> 01:45:44,300
he basically did freeze frames of the animation. Cause it's, it's running in 60 frames, right?

1547
01:45:44,300 --> 01:45:49,660
You can tell by each pause where ashes and effects in the background are moving,

1548
01:45:49,660 --> 01:45:57,820
but the characters themselves are moving at a more stilted rate, meaning that they move like

1549
01:45:57,820 --> 01:46:05,580
animation cells do, you know, with a little bit of, you know, motion line and frame skipping and

1550
01:46:05,580 --> 01:46:15,100
things like that. So the characters animations are jumped point to point to point in live

1551
01:46:15,100 --> 01:46:21,900
animation. And that right there is like, that is attention to detail and probably a bit of a

1552
01:46:21,900 --> 01:46:27,020
programming Marvel come to think of it. It, they, they pick up the frames a little bit better in the

1553
01:46:27,020 --> 01:46:33,980
actual fighting, but just in those introductions and outros and things like that, it, it follows

1554
01:46:33,980 --> 01:46:40,700
animation rules down to the effects. And that is what, first of all, just makes it visually

1555
01:46:40,700 --> 01:46:46,620
perfect. It looks like you were playing the show. Yeah. That's awesome. It's kind of like,

1556
01:46:46,620 --> 01:46:51,340
like totally different type of genre, but like the South Park game, right? The, even the old,

1557
01:46:51,340 --> 01:46:55,660
even the first one, the stick of truth kind of felt like you were playing the cartoon. And now

1558
01:46:55,660 --> 01:47:01,500
with this new one, I'm sure it's even going to be more so. So yeah, for sure. So anyway,

1559
01:47:01,500 --> 01:47:04,780
speaking of, uh, YouTube's and things of this nature, I have to ask about that. Look,

1560
01:47:05,580 --> 01:47:09,100
you guys didn't send in any, you had three weeks to send us an email and my understanding is we

1561
01:47:09,100 --> 01:47:14,860
have no emails tonight, right? Our soccer. So, so, so fine. You you've earned this derailment

1562
01:47:14,860 --> 01:47:18,540
of tonight's orange launch radio. So let me ask Loki, cause you've been tweeting a lot about

1563
01:47:18,540 --> 01:47:23,100
YouTube and some of the things you've been watching on YouTube. And so you've been watching,

1564
01:47:23,100 --> 01:47:28,540
what is this hour long discussions about the ready player one teaser, right? No, I've been,

1565
01:47:28,540 --> 01:47:31,820
I watched those occasionally. Like I want to hear what people, I'd like,

1566
01:47:31,820 --> 01:47:34,780
I want to see what people's reactions like were to the trailer.

1567
01:47:36,700 --> 01:47:42,380
And I, my God, there's these people like, yeah, I read the book and this and this and this,

1568
01:47:42,380 --> 01:47:46,860
and they're getting everything fucking wrong. Like stuff that they're talking about. Yeah,

1569
01:47:46,860 --> 01:47:52,060
this happened in the book. It's like fucking wrong. And don't get me wrong. Like I understand

1570
01:47:52,060 --> 01:47:56,460
where people can make mistakes. However, if you're researching, well, obviously they're

1571
01:47:56,460 --> 01:48:01,100
not researching shit because they're just fucking put out videos. And to be clear,

1572
01:48:01,100 --> 01:48:05,420
we never make mistakes on it all the time. Yeah, but it doesn't matter. I don't research anything.

1573
01:48:05,420 --> 01:48:10,140
I do this at the last minute and I don't fucking care. So that's, that's, that's the level of

1574
01:48:10,140 --> 01:48:16,060
effort you're getting for me. Sorry. I don't get paid for this. So you, you earn every penny of

1575
01:48:16,060 --> 01:48:22,780
that. Um, no, but like the thing I like don't like is like, of course it's click baity shit.

1576
01:48:22,780 --> 01:48:27,260
Like these videos are like, yeah, it's every Easter egg in the trailer, every single one

1577
01:48:27,260 --> 01:48:31,180
of them, except it's not because it's just the ones that everybody else has said. And you're

1578
01:48:31,180 --> 01:48:36,300
just regurgitating this shit one more time. It's like, I wanted to like, I was like, dammit,

1579
01:48:36,300 --> 01:48:40,700
I'm fucking pissed off of seeing this shit. Like I wish I could just do a video and like

1580
01:48:41,820 --> 01:48:45,900
do my own trailer analysis of it and actually go into details like

1581
01:48:45,900 --> 01:48:49,420
spoilery shit. Like, you know, there's a leaked script out there by the way,

1582
01:48:49,420 --> 01:48:53,980
it's an early draft of the script. But when you read that script and you watch the trailer,

1583
01:48:53,980 --> 01:48:57,660
you're like, Oh, I know what all this shit is because it's in context.

1584
01:48:57,660 --> 01:49:01,020
Okay. If only you knew somebody with a recording studio and a green screen.

1585
01:49:01,900 --> 01:49:07,100
I just, I, I, you know, I was actually, as my backdrop was going to use my shitty ass garage

1586
01:49:07,100 --> 01:49:10,540
cause I don't fucking care. Why not? But we did all our in a garage.

1587
01:49:11,260 --> 01:49:16,780
I just don't care enough to like do all that. Like, and then, you know, also being tired again,

1588
01:49:16,780 --> 01:49:20,860
like I actually was like taking notes. I was trying to like get more detail of like finding

1589
01:49:21,420 --> 01:49:25,980
more Easter eggs, like for stuff in the background, like actually researching stuff and

1590
01:49:25,980 --> 01:49:30,220
trying to figure it out instead of like, Oh well, this person said it's this or Hey,

1591
01:49:30,220 --> 01:49:35,340
did you notice that there was the fucking iron giant there? Did you see that? Because that's

1592
01:49:35,340 --> 01:49:42,860
totally strict. Like how do you fuck it? It's not an Easter egg if it's in the big fucking open.

1593
01:49:42,860 --> 01:49:46,700
Okay. That's not an Easter egg. Do you know what a fucking Easter egg is? Easter egg is

1594
01:49:46,700 --> 01:49:51,740
shit that's hiding in the background that only the true fans would fucking see. That's an Easter egg.

1595
01:49:51,740 --> 01:49:56,540
Act Efton chat, garage rants featuring Loki. I know Loki sitting on a million dollar idea, but

1596
01:49:57,180 --> 01:50:04,220
garage rants. Okay. That's a name. I can do it. I've got a couch in there. It's fucking dirty as

1597
01:50:04,220 --> 01:50:10,780
shit. Why? But it's, you're, you expect a dirty, it's dirty. It's fucking hot. There's cat vomit

1598
01:50:10,780 --> 01:50:19,100
on the ground. That is where I'm going to film this. Sounds quaint. All right.

1599
01:50:22,460 --> 01:50:25,900
Can't afford a fucking green screen. You get garage.

1600
01:50:25,900 --> 01:50:32,380
SSG 100. Matt says, great grants. Get it? Rage. All right. Anyway, moving on.

1601
01:50:33,660 --> 01:50:37,900
Let's talk about what's coming out in stores this week. Something a little sooner than Loki

1602
01:50:37,980 --> 01:50:41,660
finishing a project. Loki, what's coming out in the U S there's actually some pretty good

1603
01:50:41,660 --> 01:50:46,300
stuff coming out this week. Um, surprisingly. So ironically enough, since we were just talking

1604
01:50:46,300 --> 01:50:51,020
about this star craft remastered actually comes out tomorrow. So I didn't realize it was so soon.

1605
01:50:51,020 --> 01:50:57,340
So check it out. Nice. Um, the game that I just can't get hyped about, I've watched every trailer

1606
01:50:57,340 --> 01:51:04,060
for this. I'm a huge fan of saints row, but I can not get hyped about this game at all.

1607
01:51:04,700 --> 01:51:09,100
Even if they have agents of mayhem, that's coming out of PC, PlayStation four and Xbox one.

1608
01:51:09,660 --> 01:51:15,420
I want to try it. I want to try it. I really want it to be good, but I just,

1609
01:51:15,420 --> 01:51:19,740
that's why it set the bar low Loki. And if it's my problem, here's my problem.

1610
01:51:19,740 --> 01:51:24,940
My problem is originally it was kind of like, okay, it's its own thing. It has no real ties

1611
01:51:24,940 --> 01:51:28,780
to the saints row universe. We're going to put some saints row stuff kind of hints in the

1612
01:51:28,780 --> 01:51:34,540
background, but it's, it's its own thing completely different. Oh, by the way, because

1613
01:51:34,540 --> 01:51:38,060
we're not really confident in this game doing well, we're just going to have Johnny gap come

1614
01:51:38,060 --> 01:51:42,780
in there and we're going to say, Oh, it's, it's a fucking tied in with, you know, get out of hell

1615
01:51:42,780 --> 01:51:46,380
because it was one of the endings, even though it wasn't quite one of the endings, but we're just

1616
01:51:46,380 --> 01:51:50,940
going to tie it to the saints row universe because we're scared shitless that a new IP is not going

1617
01:51:50,940 --> 01:51:55,980
to do well. It's just, it's fucking annoying. There might be other reasons that it doesn't

1618
01:51:55,980 --> 01:52:00,300
do well. Looking at chat over at live.vog network.com as 200, Matt says, I forgot about

1619
01:52:00,300 --> 01:52:04,220
agents of mayhem. Dungeon buster says, whoa, agents of mayhem is coming out this week. It

1620
01:52:04,220 --> 01:52:07,980
seemed to have zero marketing at all. Yeah. I'm thinking, I think they might have a different

1621
01:52:07,980 --> 01:52:14,860
problem. It's pretty, it's like they're rip off of crackdown basically, which I've ironically was

1622
01:52:14,860 --> 01:52:21,740
kind of saints row four, but this is even worse to that. I don't know. It's I will give it the

1623
01:52:21,740 --> 01:52:25,180
benefit of doubt. I'm not buying it launch. I'm telling you that much. I'll get it in the bundle

1624
01:52:25,180 --> 01:52:30,460
later on. Fair enough. Um, city skylines coming out on PlayStation four, uh, matter fall on

1625
01:52:30,460 --> 01:52:38,540
PlayStation four, a knee hog, uh, two on PC, Mac and PlayStation four night trap, 25th anniversary

1626
01:52:38,540 --> 01:52:45,580
on PC and PlayStation four. So some games don't need to be celebrated. I'm just saying,

1627
01:52:46,140 --> 01:52:51,100
uh, observer, um, which is actually, I think a pretty good game from what I hear that's on

1628
01:52:51,100 --> 01:52:59,500
PC places for an Xbox one Sonic mania on the Nintendo switch PlayStation four and Xbox one.

1629
01:52:59,500 --> 01:53:08,220
Thank you. And final, let's see, we have a sudden strike four on PlayStation four and finally the

1630
01:53:08,220 --> 01:53:14,700
pillars of earth book one from the ashes on PC, Mac and Linux PlayStation four and Xbox one,

1631
01:53:15,580 --> 01:53:20,140
but Sonic mania this week on consoles and which game? That's pretty good. Why not?

1632
01:53:20,140 --> 01:53:23,980
So I just have to quit. I will get to the Japanese releases, but I do have to just acknowledge the

1633
01:53:23,980 --> 01:53:28,940
reason why Loki said thank you there in the middle of releases. Alan being the nice boy that he is,

1634
01:53:28,940 --> 01:53:33,340
he just brought us all Starbucks, all of us. So I thought it was very nice to him to run that.

1635
01:53:33,340 --> 01:53:37,980
Thank you very much. Thank you, Alan. So, all right, Alan's keeping the show running

1636
01:53:37,980 --> 01:53:42,460
behind the scenes. Let's go to Japan and check out the releases over there. So coming out in

1637
01:53:42,460 --> 01:53:46,620
Japan on the 17th on the PlayStation four, Sonic mania is also being released in Japan.

1638
01:53:47,260 --> 01:53:53,100
Dragon quest 10, the all-in-one package also coming out. Dragon's dogma online season three,

1639
01:53:53,660 --> 01:53:57,980
some type of limited edition package is out from Capcom this week on the PlayStation four.

1640
01:53:57,980 --> 01:54:04,620
And, um, let's see, zero escape Toki no dilemma. Also out in Japan this week, uh, checking the

1641
01:54:04,620 --> 01:54:07,980
PlayStation Vita, believe it or not. I don't think there's anything this week on the Vita.

1642
01:54:07,980 --> 01:54:12,620
Those releases don't pick up again until the 24th. So nothing to look forward to this week

1643
01:54:12,620 --> 01:54:19,980
on the Vita. Uh, actually, well, believe it or not in Japan, there's still basically the space

1644
01:54:19,980 --> 01:54:25,260
that you would have dedicated to the Xbox one here is dedicated to the, I only say that out of

1645
01:54:25,260 --> 01:54:30,620
sadness because I wish they would release a new Sony system that was actually comparable to like

1646
01:54:30,620 --> 01:54:35,180
a switch or something. I understand. I understand. Uh, so really outside of that, nothing on 3DS or

1647
01:54:35,180 --> 01:54:39,900
switch either. So it's a somewhat of a slower week, a little bit in Japan, although there is

1648
01:54:39,900 --> 01:54:44,700
a dragon quest release, but then again, it's kind of a repackaging, so it's not as big a deal,

1649
01:54:44,700 --> 01:54:50,700
but anyhow, how about the UK dark soccer in the UK? We've got a few things. Actually,

1650
01:54:50,700 --> 01:54:57,420
it's kind of a busy week on the 15th night trap, blah, blah. On the 16th, we have bound for

1651
01:54:57,420 --> 01:55:05,500
PlayStation four and Conan exiles for the Xbox one. On the 17th, we have, I'm going to Zlatan

1652
01:55:05,500 --> 01:55:15,020
legends for iOS. On the 18th, we have agents of mayhem for PS4, Xbox one and PC and thumper for

1653
01:55:15,020 --> 01:55:23,420
Xbox one X and Xbox one. Okay. Thumper. Yeah. The Xbox one X isn't even out yet. So I don't know

1654
01:55:23,420 --> 01:55:28,460
whether it says Xbox one X. I'm like, that's weird. That's weird that that site has it. But

1655
01:55:28,700 --> 01:55:35,260
thumper is that cool music game that is, it's kind of hard. Yeah. Yeah. But it's, it's, it's

1656
01:55:35,260 --> 01:55:39,900
probably most well known in its PlayStation VR form, but it is on the switch as well. So

1657
01:55:39,900 --> 01:55:46,780
it's a hard game. It's a very hard game, but it's fun. I like it. There's like the music,

1658
01:55:46,780 --> 01:55:50,060
it's like industrial music and it's not like commercial stuff. It's all like,

1659
01:55:50,620 --> 01:55:56,380
you know, it's noise. It's a very noisy game. It's good. Like experimental. Yeah. Kinda.

1660
01:55:57,100 --> 01:56:01,660
All right. Uh, as mentioned, we didn't get any emails this week, sad face or the past three

1661
01:56:01,660 --> 01:56:07,260
weeks in fact. Uh, but to be fair because of the hiatus, maybe you guys kind of just figured,

1662
01:56:07,260 --> 01:56:10,540
you know, we weren't taking them for a little while, but let me just remind you all the email

1663
01:56:10,540 --> 01:56:15,020
bag is open once again. So please feel free to send your emails, participate at orange

1664
01:56:15,020 --> 01:56:19,420
lounge radio.com. If you want to participate with the mailbag segment. So yeah, emails open once

1665
01:56:19,420 --> 01:56:23,340
again, participate at orange launch radio.com. In the meantime, just a few more stories for you

1666
01:56:23,340 --> 01:56:27,180
guys. Then we'll get to the Skype line and other way for you to participate at orange lounge radio

1667
01:56:27,180 --> 01:56:34,540
on Skype, Loki. So, um, this is kind of cool that they're actually considering e-sports as becoming

1668
01:56:34,540 --> 01:56:42,620
part of the 2024 Olympic games. Apparently they are, um, considering it along with, with, um,

1669
01:56:42,620 --> 01:56:46,860
you know, including it with new events because they kind of do this each route. Like when they

1670
01:56:46,860 --> 01:56:52,140
have a new games coming out, they'll add new events. So in fact, they, I think one of the

1671
01:56:52,140 --> 01:56:56,060
upcoming summer games, I think has like a skateboarding or something in there now. Oh,

1672
01:56:56,060 --> 01:57:01,100
wow. Something different. But, um, they're adding new stuff all the time. And one of the

1673
01:57:01,100 --> 01:57:06,540
reasons that they're considering this even more is because you may not realize, um, at least I don't,

1674
01:57:06,540 --> 01:57:11,580
um, that aside from the Olympics, there's also the Asian games as well. And that actually isn't

1675
01:57:11,580 --> 01:57:17,340
being included in the Asian games. E-sports is part of the 2022 Asian games and the 2018 Asian

1676
01:57:17,340 --> 01:57:21,980
games in Indonesia. So that's something that's kind of cool that this is actually being,

1677
01:57:22,940 --> 01:57:29,260
you know, adapted in these major, you know, I remember 10 years ago when we were focused

1678
01:57:29,260 --> 01:57:34,620
more on music based games and we kept having that whole is DDR a sport. Remember that that was

1679
01:57:35,180 --> 01:57:39,420
like, it may be one of the Scandinavian countries did make it a sport. I remember that was a big

1680
01:57:39,420 --> 01:57:43,660
thing we talked about for awhile and, uh, we kind of talked about, wouldn't it be funny if

1681
01:57:43,660 --> 01:57:47,180
DDR was in the Olympics and we kind of laughed it off that it's never going to happen, but

1682
01:57:47,180 --> 01:57:53,660
here we are now the landscapes changed. E-sports is growing very, very big. Um,

1683
01:57:53,660 --> 01:57:58,620
not just with things like star craft and things like, you know, Dota, but now we see

1684
01:57:58,620 --> 01:58:03,580
Overwatch and the Overwatch league. I mean, that, you know, is looking more and more like they're

1685
01:58:03,580 --> 01:58:08,220
trying to do like a, I don't know if I would call it the NFL, maybe more like the XFL.

1686
01:58:08,780 --> 01:58:14,700
Anyone remember the XFL? Um, but I, but still I'm still curious really to see where that goes.

1687
01:58:14,700 --> 01:58:19,580
Uh, it looks very exciting. And then, so yeah, it seems like with E-sports taking off as it is

1688
01:58:19,580 --> 01:58:23,740
this, I mean, 10 years ago I would have said, Oh, come on, this is never going to, the Olympics

1689
01:58:23,740 --> 01:58:26,220
is never going to take this seriously. Kind of like the thing is they're like,

1690
01:58:26,220 --> 01:58:31,820
they're trying to understand, you know, is it a sport? You know, it's still like,

1691
01:58:31,820 --> 01:58:36,220
kind of how do we measure it? How do you define a sport? I mean, a lot of, you know,

1692
01:58:36,220 --> 01:58:41,420
the Olympics, you think, you know, physical sport and stuff, whereas, but isn't chess in the

1693
01:58:41,420 --> 01:58:47,260
Olympics and that's not a physical sport. That's more of a mental sport. So there is mental sports.

1694
01:58:47,260 --> 01:58:52,460
Yeah. I mean, there, there is a lot of that in there. I mean, creativity and stuff with even like

1695
01:58:52,460 --> 01:58:56,700
some of the, you know, the gymnastics routines. I mean, still, I'm not going to argue that that's

1696
01:58:56,700 --> 01:59:01,260
not physical, but there's a lot of like, you know, designing and creativity and stuff to that,

1697
01:59:01,260 --> 01:59:07,740
that your routines and stuff. So maybe with that strategy and this critical thinking and, you know,

1698
01:59:07,740 --> 01:59:13,100
quick reflexes that could tie in with this stuff. I think by the time we get there, you know,

1699
01:59:13,100 --> 01:59:17,180
especially when you consider that, you know, everybody growing up with gaming and stuff

1700
01:59:17,180 --> 01:59:21,660
by that time, I mean, that's, you know, a few years away, still seven years away, by the way,

1701
01:59:21,660 --> 01:59:26,860
I mean, yeah, that could be more accepted by then. Yeah. It's gonna be very interesting to see how

1702
01:59:26,860 --> 01:59:32,140
that plays out. And finally, after all these years, the Olympics is coming back to the States

1703
01:59:32,140 --> 01:59:39,020
officially in 2028. Uh, and that's the first time the summer game, LA, LA, they did this

1704
01:59:39,020 --> 01:59:44,060
weird thing that they don't usually do, but they kind of co-awarded Olympic games to Paris and LA

1705
01:59:44,060 --> 01:59:48,860
at the same time, basically, I think LA still has some dotted lines to sign off on and so forth,

1706
01:59:48,860 --> 01:59:52,860
but it looking very certain that LA is going to have the 2028 games, which, you know, they

1707
01:59:52,860 --> 01:59:59,740
hosted in 84. Um, but otherwise the United States has not hosted an Olympic games, a summer games

1708
01:59:59,820 --> 02:00:05,820
since Atlanta in 96. That was a long time ago. Um, they did do a winter games in Salt Lake City,

1709
02:00:05,820 --> 02:00:10,380
I think was the last one in 2002, if I remember right. But even then, you know, that's still,

1710
02:00:10,380 --> 02:00:16,060
still going to be like over 20 years, uh, without the States hosting. So, um, the only reason,

1711
02:00:16,060 --> 02:00:19,900
only reason I bring that up is because, you know, esports, if it does well in Paris,

1712
02:00:19,900 --> 02:00:25,580
could be a big part of the LA games. Um, and you know, at the end of the day, the Olympics is

1713
02:00:25,580 --> 02:00:31,740
a business. It needs to make money. And some, there, there is some, sometimes some not so

1714
02:00:31,740 --> 02:00:35,100
great news about the Olympics out there and some money, some cities that have lost.

1715
02:00:35,100 --> 02:00:37,260
Well, I got to wonder too, like with the Olympics, like,

1716
02:00:38,220 --> 02:00:42,380
maybe they're not drawing the same audiences that they used to anymore. Like they're,

1717
02:00:43,020 --> 02:00:47,740
you know, losing out in certain demographics. And so they're trying to get that younger

1718
02:00:47,740 --> 02:00:52,060
demographic. I think so. And I think one of the biggest mistakes that they've been making is

1719
02:00:52,060 --> 02:00:59,260
specifically NBC here in the States with the tape delay of the games that are happening in Rio.

1720
02:00:59,260 --> 02:01:04,380
And when we live in an internet day and age where all that stuff is instant, like, um, you know,

1721
02:01:04,380 --> 02:01:10,860
NBC, I think is really going to have to adapt their way of thinking for Tokyo in 2020. Um,

1722
02:01:10,860 --> 02:01:14,140
or they're going to just hemorrhage even more people because of the internet and,

1723
02:01:14,140 --> 02:01:18,860
and other ways that people can get this information. So, um, you know, I think,

1724
02:01:18,940 --> 02:01:23,260
I think they kind of have to figure that out, but you know, at the end of the day, yeah,

1725
02:01:23,260 --> 02:01:28,540
it is a business, but it's also, it's a huge part of TV. So if you think about it,

1726
02:01:28,540 --> 02:01:37,100
if e-sports ends up a part of the 2024 games, we could see e-sports on a major broadcast network,

1727
02:01:37,100 --> 02:01:43,580
NBC by 2024. There's something to think about the same network that shows Monday night football,

1728
02:01:43,580 --> 02:01:48,780
right? Does NBC show that or does that, does NBC still show football? Is that all Fox now?

1729
02:01:49,500 --> 02:01:55,420
I don't know. But anyway, you get the drift, the same family of, of networks that shows Monday

1730
02:01:55,420 --> 02:02:01,180
night football could show speaking of things that are on TV. That's kind of unusual like that. Um,

1731
02:02:01,180 --> 02:02:08,780
one of the things is I mentioned covers a tangent ESPN actually did the ESPN eight, the Ocho.

1732
02:02:08,780 --> 02:02:14,700
I heard about like, was it like a certain amount of eight? Yeah. So they did that for August 8th

1733
02:02:14,700 --> 02:02:21,900
and that sounds awesome. They, they replayed the, um, uh, uh, fighting game stuff. Evo,

1734
02:02:21,900 --> 02:02:26,220
they replayed Evo during that was part of the block. Yeah. So it was kind of neat.

1735
02:02:27,260 --> 02:02:31,180
All right. Anyhow, a little bit of a tangent, but we've had some of those tonight.

1736
02:02:31,180 --> 02:02:36,620
Uh, let's see, let's get to another story about Capcom and, uh, oh, they're not happy about

1737
02:02:36,620 --> 02:02:42,540
street fighter costume mods. Uh, that's because there were some street fighter nude mod creators.

1738
02:02:43,500 --> 02:02:46,220
Well, now I can't believe Capcom would take issue to this.

1739
02:02:47,740 --> 02:02:53,980
Say what? Anyway, so these two modders, uh, brutal ACE and Cal Dentar six, six, six. I hope I said

1740
02:02:53,980 --> 02:03:00,300
that right. They had Patrion pages that solicited donations from fans. So I guess they weren't

1741
02:03:00,300 --> 02:03:05,820
charging for the mods per se, but it was one of those. If you like these titties, subscribe to my

1742
02:03:05,900 --> 02:03:10,380
Patrion basically. Well, the mom likes these titties. You give me those biddies.

1743
02:03:13,260 --> 02:03:17,500
I'm going to put that, I'm going to put that on my Twitch channel. You like these titties,

1744
02:03:17,500 --> 02:03:21,580
give me them biddies. Except you're not supposed to solicit that stuff on Twitch, but anyway,

1745
02:03:21,580 --> 02:03:25,500
it's all in fun and you've been banned. All right. And I've been banned from Twitch. Oh,

1746
02:03:25,500 --> 02:03:30,700
all right. Uh, so anyway, uh, one of the mods, so brutal ACE had a Chun Li mod, but in a wonder

1747
02:03:30,700 --> 02:03:38,620
woman costume and let's see, uh, Cal Dentar had a Kami mod in 2B's costume from Nier Automata.

1748
02:03:38,620 --> 02:03:44,140
So obviously there's copyright violations going on all over the place. But, uh, of course these

1749
02:03:44,140 --> 02:03:50,380
same modders made naked female fighters or female fighters in string bikinis. Uh, there's also

1750
02:03:50,380 --> 02:03:56,940
risque mods, such as barefoot mods and breast jiggling mods. Oh my God. They didn't have shoes.

1751
02:03:56,940 --> 02:04:03,580
They were barefoot. How risque, but nothing for men. Go figure. Nothing for the male fighters.

1752
02:04:03,580 --> 02:04:08,460
I think that there are, but it's just, you know, but not these guys mention it. None of these guys.

1753
02:04:08,460 --> 02:04:13,740
So anyhow, the Patreon page for Cal Dentar 6, 6, 6 was deleted along with all the records of

1754
02:04:13,740 --> 02:04:19,500
the earnings, uh, and so forth. So, um, let's see brutal ACE says he always offered his mod,

1755
02:04:19,500 --> 02:04:25,420
it's free downloads, but the Patreon supporters did get one week of advanced exclusive access

1756
02:04:25,420 --> 02:04:31,820
to all new mods. So this creates a whole big issue, uh, between Patreon and so forth. So,

1757
02:04:31,820 --> 02:04:35,980
you know, if you're going to ask for people's money on Patreon, make sure what you're doing is

1758
02:04:35,980 --> 02:04:42,380
legal. I honestly don't think that they had, they could do this to his Patreon page, honestly,

1759
02:04:42,380 --> 02:04:47,980
cause I get their thought process. Their thought process is he charging for mods for our game and

1760
02:04:47,980 --> 02:04:55,580
we don't like that. Honestly though, modding your game is fair use. So kind of fuck off.

1761
02:04:56,380 --> 02:05:00,860
Well, but if you're putting up a Patreon page and the centerpiece of that Patreon page is

1762
02:05:00,860 --> 02:05:05,820
I will deliver you nude mods early. If you give me money, it's kind of walking that line there.

1763
02:05:05,820 --> 02:05:10,540
I think this game been out, there's nude bonds already. There's been new mods since like the

1764
02:05:10,540 --> 02:05:15,660
game came five minutes before the five minutes after it was out. I mean, come on. Like that's

1765
02:05:15,740 --> 02:05:20,860
stupid. Oh, and, and, Oh yes. Now that you've taken down his page, Oh, I'm sure that the

1766
02:05:20,860 --> 02:05:25,500
new mods will never ever come out. Oh wait, they've already been out. It's done nothing.

1767
02:05:26,300 --> 02:05:30,620
Uh, dungeon buster and chat jokes, street fighter five dead or alive. You know, you joke,

1768
02:05:30,620 --> 02:05:36,140
but now that you bring that up, speaking of the whole like man mods, I have to say I was, I was,

1769
02:05:36,140 --> 02:05:40,540
um, I was pleasantly surprised. I was looking in the PlayStation store for the new releases

1770
02:05:40,540 --> 02:05:45,100
and what is it? Dead or alive five final round or last round. I'm sorry. I forget the name of the

1771
02:05:45,100 --> 02:05:51,580
game, but they released some new DLC and of course it is the usual lots of ladies and very

1772
02:05:51,580 --> 02:05:56,140
skimpy types of bathing suits and so forth. What you would expect. However, to our soccer, I don't

1773
02:05:56,140 --> 02:06:03,580
know if you saw this, there were also some men in speedos as part of this. So I was like, okay,

1774
02:06:03,580 --> 02:06:10,540
it was, it was nice. It was nice. So, uh, quality was the Overwatch. Of course there's like two

1775
02:06:10,540 --> 02:06:17,420
dudes in speedos and like summer DLC. Oh yeah. The Overwatch with the McCree who I've never really

1776
02:06:17,420 --> 02:06:22,300
paid attention to before. Yes. Yes. I did notice that. Yes I did. Yes I did. I sure did. Anyway.

1777
02:06:23,420 --> 02:06:28,940
All right. I posted about that on Twitter. Look, and look, I don't even, you know, I don't,

1778
02:06:28,940 --> 02:06:34,060
wherever you guys fall on the, if you, whatever gender you're into or not into or so forth,

1779
02:06:34,060 --> 02:06:40,220
you have to go, okay. It's, it's nice to have the same for everybody that folks can have whatever

1780
02:06:40,220 --> 02:06:45,340
they like. So, all right. Anyway, uh, moving on, let's get to something. Let's get to something

1781
02:06:45,340 --> 02:06:49,660
a little more, uh, a little more retro, a little more classy in gaming. Shall we DarkSaga? What

1782
02:06:49,660 --> 02:06:53,900
do you have for us? Are we having the classy game of the week? Yes. The classy game of the week.

1783
02:06:54,940 --> 02:07:04,060
Well, all right. We have talked about this game in various iterations and there is going to be

1784
02:07:04,060 --> 02:07:12,140
a Tempest 4000 because they're really freaking creative. Yes. Actually, it's funny when we pick

1785
02:07:12,140 --> 02:07:20,220
up the cat with Midna, we go, got you. These guys are nerds. It's become a joke in my house.

1786
02:07:21,660 --> 02:07:30,300
But anyway, it is being developed by Jeff Minter and it is, yeah, going to be the continuation in

1787
02:07:30,300 --> 02:07:39,340
Tempest 2000 and Tempest 3000, which I think was, uh, not even a fully released game. It was like

1788
02:07:39,340 --> 02:07:44,060
prototype. How do you remember Tempest? I remember hearing of a Tempest 3000, but I don't remember.

1789
02:07:44,060 --> 02:07:52,460
I played it in an Atari party. Okay. Like a while back. But, um, basically you, uh, play the claw

1790
02:07:52,460 --> 02:07:59,420
again and you have to shoot stuff and super zapper recharge. So will this be coming out on

1791
02:07:59,420 --> 02:08:06,140
Atari's new system? Since we know the Atari box is coming. Wouldn't Tempest 4000 be a great, after

1792
02:08:06,140 --> 02:08:12,060
all, Tempest 2000 was like the fucking reason to own a Jaguar. Why not? The only reason to own a Jaguar.

1793
02:08:13,260 --> 02:08:19,180
Um, it looks like it is going to be coming out for PC and consoles later on in 2017.

1794
02:08:19,180 --> 02:08:26,620
This year, really? Yeah. That's awesome. I'm excited. I like this article. Okay. This article is great

1795
02:08:26,620 --> 02:08:33,580
because, okay, it says we don't have any assets of Tempest 4000. So instead here's a picture of

1796
02:08:33,580 --> 02:08:39,740
a llama and it's a picture of a llama sitting down in the grass. I love this article, Eurogamer.

1797
02:08:39,740 --> 02:08:45,260
Oh, Eurogamer. I love Eurogamer. It's a good site. But just, I just had to say, why is there,

1798
02:08:45,260 --> 02:08:50,140
oh, that's why there's a llama. Super llama recharge. Well, didn't they also, wasn't,

1799
02:08:50,140 --> 02:08:54,940
wasn't it like llama soft or something? Wasn't it llamas played into it somehow as well? Because

1800
02:08:54,940 --> 02:09:01,660
then they had space giraffe was kind of like that side game. Anyway. All right. A few more

1801
02:09:01,660 --> 02:09:08,380
stories for you guys before we open up the Skype line. Loki. So valve, um, announced during the

1802
02:09:08,380 --> 02:09:16,460
whole international, um, seven match in Seattle that there's a new Dota game coming. Oh my God.

1803
02:09:16,460 --> 02:09:23,100
Valves putting out a new game. Yes. It's Dota artifact. It's a card game.

1804
02:09:24,780 --> 02:09:28,860
I liked, can you say that again? Half life. Just kidding. It's a card game.

1805
02:09:33,260 --> 02:09:38,380
Yes. The, the, the art of artifact, the, the, the Dota card game that's going to be

1806
02:09:38,380 --> 02:09:44,060
coming out in 2018. All right. Well, there's people out, you know what?

1807
02:09:44,060 --> 02:09:47,580
And for the people that like trading, it's like they have the, like, we have a new

1808
02:09:47,580 --> 02:09:56,860
announcement for you and everyone's like, how fast the crowd will turn on you. Hey, look, no,

1809
02:09:56,860 --> 02:09:59,980
there's people that are really into trading card games are gonna be super thrilled about it. I

1810
02:09:59,980 --> 02:10:03,260
don't have a problem with them making a trading card game. It's just everybody else is wanting

1811
02:10:03,260 --> 02:10:07,820
to make a third of something. Yes. Maybe this was not the best place to announce it, even though

1812
02:10:07,820 --> 02:10:13,660
it is a Dota kind of game. Who knows? All right. It's like valve, just put three next to something,

1813
02:10:13,660 --> 02:10:18,700
please. One more story. And it has to do with a classic game. And this is something,

1814
02:10:18,700 --> 02:10:25,820
something brand new unearthed in a classic game. And that classic game is Super Mario Brothers 2,

1815
02:10:25,820 --> 02:10:31,340
the US version, which was Doki Doki Panic, of course, over on the Famicom. So it was unearthed

1816
02:10:31,340 --> 02:10:37,260
this week that in the original manual for Doki Doki Panic on the Famicom disk system,

1817
02:10:37,260 --> 02:10:42,460
there was a gray shy guy that was supposed to be there. If you, if you're not, I remember this.

1818
02:10:42,460 --> 02:10:46,700
Yeah, there was supposed to be a gray shy guy in the game. Oh, he's a shiny. Yes, he, that's

1819
02:10:46,700 --> 02:10:51,340
right. He's a shiny shy guy. Exactly. And what makes him special is that he would actually

1820
02:10:51,340 --> 02:10:56,060
follow you around. But the character actually never showed up in the game, even though it's

1821
02:10:56,060 --> 02:11:04,860
on the manual. Well, get this, somebody was able to use a code on Game Genie to get the character

1822
02:11:04,860 --> 02:11:10,060
back in the game. And that's right. There is a, it's an actual Game Genie code you can put

1823
02:11:10,060 --> 02:11:14,780
together and use on a cartridge. And you'll have to look this up on, on some of the different blogs,

1824
02:11:14,780 --> 02:11:18,700
like Destructoid or, or different codes of paint on the version of the game you have. Yeah. Cause

1825
02:11:18,700 --> 02:11:22,460
I'm not going to read the code, but yeah, you can put the code in the game and sure enough,

1826
02:11:22,460 --> 02:11:27,340
you will get a gray shy guy in the first level. And the thing is the shy guy will start to follow

1827
02:11:27,340 --> 02:11:31,100
you. Like he does the whole walking forward, but most shy guys in the game just ignore you,

1828
02:11:31,100 --> 02:11:34,940
jump over them and you're, that's it. But this shy guy, once you jump, if you ride him,

1829
02:11:34,940 --> 02:11:41,580
the universe, universes, why we always got to go to the gutter here on this show.

1830
02:11:41,580 --> 02:11:47,500
Oh no. I mean, you can stand on the enemy. I'm not trying to be in the gutter. You know what

1831
02:11:47,500 --> 02:11:51,660
you mean? If I was trying to do that, I would say like, Oh, what happens if you fuck him? You know,

1832
02:11:53,420 --> 02:11:59,180
well, somebody on Reddit's working on that, but um, no, I, I, I don't know because in this video,

1833
02:11:59,180 --> 02:12:03,420
they don't try that. So you'll have to go get a copy of the game and probably just walks back

1834
02:12:03,420 --> 02:12:07,340
and forth because he probably does. He probably just stands in place or continues off my fucking

1835
02:12:07,340 --> 02:12:16,780
head. You hurt. You're so big. I can't, my, my skeletal structure. Can I handle this?

1836
02:12:17,340 --> 02:12:20,380
Tiger quad chat says, no wonder they call them shy guys.

1837
02:12:24,380 --> 02:12:27,980
And on that note, we're going to open up the Skype line, orange lounge radio,

1838
02:12:27,980 --> 02:12:32,780
all one word on Skype. Uh, if you'd like to give us a call and talk about shy guys or anything

1839
02:12:32,860 --> 02:12:37,180
that is on your mind tonight, uh, maybe that we did cover in the news or maybe that we didn't

1840
02:12:37,180 --> 02:12:41,740
get to. So I will, uh, I will open up that Skype line now and how about that calls are already

1841
02:12:41,740 --> 02:12:46,700
coming in. So let's get to it higher on orange launch radio. Who's this? Hey, what's going on?

1842
02:12:46,700 --> 02:12:51,500
It's Rama. Hey Rama. Good to have you here. What's up? Not much. I'm just, I just finished

1843
02:12:51,500 --> 02:12:56,700
my eight hour trek back from Otacon in DC. So yeah, I've been seeing your Facebook updates

1844
02:12:56,700 --> 02:13:02,540
from Otacon. How was it? It was amazing. Nice. I'm glad you had a good time. Thank you.

1845
02:13:03,260 --> 02:13:06,220
What kind of like video game stuff do they have there? They have a gaming room or

1846
02:13:07,820 --> 02:13:11,820
I'm going to say this really quickly. Dan, I'm going to tell you why I called it.

1847
02:13:11,820 --> 02:13:17,660
The game room was huge, old school gaming. Plus there was many land tournament set up.

1848
02:13:18,540 --> 02:13:23,260
It was a few DDR arcade machines. It was a couple of dance machines and a whole

1849
02:13:23,260 --> 02:13:27,660
bunch of ju beat machines. And I will say this, it didn't stink.

1850
02:13:28,540 --> 02:13:34,540
Oh, people were, were applying their deodorant and, uh, taking showers daily. That's great.

1851
02:13:35,740 --> 02:13:41,500
Let's just hope that they did. When I walked to the game room, there was no smell. It was

1852
02:13:41,500 --> 02:13:48,700
a well ventilated space then maybe. All right. So why did you call? Because I was listening to

1853
02:13:48,700 --> 02:13:53,580
y'all on the way home and you were talking about the Nintendo world championships. And I remember

1854
02:13:53,580 --> 02:13:58,220
those, which in turn, for some reason, it reminded me of, while I was leaving

1855
02:13:58,220 --> 02:14:02,940
the dealer's room earlier, they had a little setup, one to boost. Um, they had a very

1856
02:14:02,940 --> 02:14:10,300
interesting VR game. It was, I, I looked at it like, how does sex your waifu? Cause that's

1857
02:14:10,300 --> 02:14:15,260
pretty much what it was. You had this little, it's important information.

1858
02:14:17,020 --> 02:14:23,020
Had this little blow up doll looking thing. You had the VR glasses on and there were people

1859
02:14:23,100 --> 02:14:26,220
watching this guy, I guess pretty much screwed his school girl.

1860
02:14:26,220 --> 02:14:30,300
Were there sensors on the doll? Did you have to dry hump the doll? Because that's awesome.

1861
02:14:30,300 --> 02:14:32,300
I don't know about telling you this, there was no sensors.

1862
02:14:34,540 --> 02:14:39,500
But, um, then I got that out the way. I don't know why that reminded me of it. I don't,

1863
02:14:39,500 --> 02:14:44,620
maybe because gaming tour, I don't know. Yes. Why did how to screw your waifu make you think,

1864
02:14:44,620 --> 02:14:51,260
God, I need to call OLR. Do you understand how much booze has been in my system since Thursday?

1865
02:14:51,980 --> 02:14:58,620
Fair enough. But, um, I remember the Nintendo world championships and I wanted to go,

1866
02:14:58,620 --> 02:15:04,380
but I couldn't. I remember the blockbuster, uh, gaming competitions. And one of my friends went,

1867
02:15:04,380 --> 02:15:08,060
cause he scored the highest in the areas. I went with him down the South street seaport

1868
02:15:08,060 --> 02:15:14,860
where he did NBA jam. But the thing is they threw him on the Genesis version. So it was a little

1869
02:15:14,860 --> 02:15:21,180
bit harder for him to play, but he used two hands whereas he was using his fingers to control the

1870
02:15:21,180 --> 02:15:25,980
game instead of his thumbs. That would suck though. That if you're used to one version

1871
02:15:25,980 --> 02:15:29,900
of the game and they throw you another, like they weren't the same back then. That's not,

1872
02:15:29,900 --> 02:15:35,740
it's not the same. I know the timing and the frames and all that stuff was different. So that's,

1873
02:15:36,300 --> 02:15:40,220
that's kind of crappy, but you know, but still kind of awesome that you got to do that. Yeah.

1874
02:15:40,220 --> 02:15:43,820
I have a lot of friends that did the world championships. I didn't really get to do any

1875
02:15:43,820 --> 02:15:47,500
of that. I don't know. I don't, I don't think they really had them. I mean, they might've done the

1876
02:15:47,500 --> 02:15:52,060
blockbuster thing here in Sacramento, but, but we never really went to blockbuster ever. We had like

1877
02:15:52,060 --> 02:15:57,020
indie stores that we usually always went to. And then the world championships, I highly doubt

1878
02:15:57,020 --> 02:16:01,020
wherever here. And it was just the kind of thing where it's like my, my parents really weren't

1879
02:16:01,020 --> 02:16:08,380
interested in taking me to San Francisco or anything like that. So. Well, I got lucky because

1880
02:16:08,380 --> 02:16:13,900
I don't know if you remember, there was one tournament that they had that I had an amazing

1881
02:16:13,900 --> 02:16:20,140
time at. Do you remember the superstar Fox weekend? I do remember that I do. Cause those

1882
02:16:20,140 --> 02:16:26,620
cartridges are super rare. If you can find them. I know. And if you went, I believe if you ended

1883
02:16:26,620 --> 02:16:32,140
up with the highest score that day, you got a t-shirt. I went to two locations and got two

1884
02:16:32,140 --> 02:16:38,780
shirts. Good job. That's awesome. But unfortunately someone outscored me in both places for the entire

1885
02:16:38,780 --> 02:16:43,340
weekend. So that's all right. They can make that modern now. It's like, I went to pre-order an

1886
02:16:43,340 --> 02:16:48,860
essay in the S classic, but all I got was the shirt. I wanted to play star Fox too,

1887
02:16:48,860 --> 02:16:55,740
but all I got was disappointment and resentment. I am disappointed. I'll just wait for the Rama

1888
02:16:55,740 --> 02:17:00,620
leak. Yeah, I know how like immediately immediate, immediate. All right. Well, Rama, I'm glad to hear

1889
02:17:00,620 --> 02:17:05,100
you had a good time at Otacon and I'm getting really excited about a dragon con I'm hearing

1890
02:17:05,100 --> 02:17:08,780
from what I believe I was reading. I heard that Tokyo attack is going to be back at dragon con

1891
02:17:08,780 --> 02:17:12,620
and that their, their space is increasing this year. So it's going to be more of it. So I'm

1892
02:17:12,620 --> 02:17:17,100
really excited. That sounds pretty awesome. So, you know where to find me at dragon con

1893
02:17:17,100 --> 02:17:23,580
when I'm not in a panel. Yep. In the game room. What about, what about what, what,

1894
02:17:23,580 --> 02:17:30,460
what a nice refreshing adult beverage, right? Correct. All right. Well, Rama, I'm going to

1895
02:17:30,460 --> 02:17:34,620
let you go so we can take more calls. Awesome, man. Thanks a lot. Great to hear from you. Bye.

1896
02:17:36,220 --> 02:17:40,780
All right. Orange lounge radio, all one word on Skype. If you want to get through, uh,

1897
02:17:40,780 --> 02:17:44,780
going to chat over at live.vognetware.com, message 100 Matt says Tokyo attack won't be back

1898
02:17:44,780 --> 02:17:49,660
at mad. Won't be at magfest sadly. Yeah, I heard about that. I was concerned about that. Um, you

1899
02:17:49,660 --> 02:17:53,500
know, I'm sure they have some type of other plan they're going to do and it's going to be different,

1900
02:17:53,500 --> 02:17:58,940
but if these other shows are happening over the country, all over the country, like, you know, the

1901
02:17:58,940 --> 02:18:02,860
California extreme and the Southern fried game room, I'm sure in the DC area, they're going to

1902
02:18:02,860 --> 02:18:06,780
figure out how to do it just fine. Uh, it'll just be different. It probably would just won't have

1903
02:18:06,780 --> 02:18:11,980
the focus on the, um, Japanese games, uh, that it has in the past, but it'll probably have plenty

1904
02:18:11,980 --> 02:18:18,700
of old school games and pinball and all that other stuff. So that'll be cool. Um, hit stun and chat

1905
02:18:18,700 --> 02:18:22,860
suggests a snow Phoenix. I've not heard of snow Phoenix. That must be a new company. Somebody

1906
02:18:22,860 --> 02:18:27,020
starts sending snow Phoenix to these big cons. They have a lot of Tokyo tax games. I was not aware.

1907
02:18:27,020 --> 02:18:32,540
So I guess these, I guess these con arcade companies are, uh, uh, grow in business,

1908
02:18:32,540 --> 02:18:38,460
but it does, it seems like there's more cons now than there were years ago when we first started

1909
02:18:38,460 --> 02:18:43,980
the show. I just mean like local stuff. Like it seems like there's some little con in Sacramento,

1910
02:18:43,980 --> 02:18:49,980
like every weekend. So that's kind of neat. So, all right. Uh, orange lounge radio, all one word

1911
02:18:49,980 --> 02:18:54,060
on Skype. Again, if you want to give us a call, let me check in quickly while we do this last,

1912
02:18:54,060 --> 02:18:57,820
uh, wait for calls here and see, uh, with Loki, if there's any last minute stories on, if you have

1913
02:18:57,820 --> 02:19:03,900
anything tonight, um, no, just like silly Twitch stuff. There's someone dude, um, that goes by the

1914
02:19:03,900 --> 02:19:12,300
name, a twerking Yoshi that's playing bloodborne, um, using a game or dance pad. Why not? Cause you

1915
02:19:12,300 --> 02:19:16,700
know, that's the thing. Why not? Sure. Why not? How do we, how did he hook up the dance pad to a

1916
02:19:16,700 --> 02:19:23,500
PlayStation three or four? Um, they have, I don't know, there's ways to do that kind of stuff, but

1917
02:19:23,500 --> 02:19:30,620
like they had, it shows like how they have the buttons maps. So they've got, um, I guess attack

1918
02:19:31,740 --> 02:19:36,460
can you only move to one direction? That's weird. They've got like a Dodge on the X button.

1919
02:19:36,460 --> 02:19:44,540
There's L one on the triangle are three lock on, on the square and L two on start and select

1920
02:19:44,540 --> 02:19:49,180
his potion. Well, you can remap all the buttons within the PlayStation four operating. And

1921
02:19:49,180 --> 02:19:55,900
apparently, um, right is attack. So he can only move left up and down. So interesting.

1922
02:19:55,900 --> 02:19:59,180
I don't know. I guess that's the thing. Uh, as Joe and Hunter, Matt and Chad says,

1923
02:19:59,180 --> 02:20:05,340
I remember having a party where we played mortal combat with DDR pads. Good times. Was it, was there

1924
02:20:05,340 --> 02:20:09,740
any, um, Jamie, I'm trying to think way back to the parties that used to happen at your house with

1925
02:20:09,740 --> 02:20:13,660
like your dream cast dance pads. Were there any other games that were played with dance pads

1926
02:20:13,660 --> 02:20:19,100
besides DDR? I thought there was something. Um, and not the jungle book doesn't count.

1927
02:20:19,100 --> 02:20:25,420
Soul caliber. Soul caliber. Yes. Because we found that the Konami logo is an analog pad.

1928
02:20:27,260 --> 02:20:31,900
And so we would play, um, we would try to play soul caliber with the dance pad. Yeah.

1929
02:20:31,900 --> 02:20:39,740
On a dance pad on the dance pad, on the dream cast dance pad. Oh, so weird. Yeah. Super weird.

1930
02:20:39,740 --> 02:20:45,740
Yeah. But anyway, um, I think that's what else we've ever used the dream cast dance pads for,

1931
02:20:45,740 --> 02:20:53,260
but rod caliber was your rod caliber was great because it is literally just moving the fishing

1932
02:20:53,260 --> 02:21:00,700
rod and praying cause it would move them too. Yeah. So it's so crazy. Good times. All right.

1933
02:21:00,700 --> 02:21:07,020
We got another call coming in, so let's get to it. Hi. Oh, it's all right. So it,

1934
02:21:07,020 --> 02:21:10,540
as soon as I picked up the call, it went, Nope, just kidding. Disconnect. Let me see if that

1935
02:21:10,540 --> 02:21:15,740
person calls back. Uh, meanwhile, I'll read some comments and chat, uh, hit stun and chat says,

1936
02:21:15,740 --> 02:21:20,540
I played an arcade tech and five on a dance pad. Once it had PS two controller reports,

1937
02:21:20,540 --> 02:21:24,460
uh, dark Tetsuya says, I bet you could do soul caliber. Yeah. It works with the keyboard too.

1938
02:21:25,260 --> 02:21:31,020
Uh, and let's see as 200. Matt says, one of my friends managed to pull off a fatality on a dance

1939
02:21:31,020 --> 02:21:36,300
pad. I forgot who's he pulled off. We've got to be somebody easy like a katana. I still remember to

1940
02:21:36,300 --> 02:21:39,820
this day, block, block, block, block, block, block, block, high kick. It's just buttons.

1941
02:21:39,820 --> 02:21:43,420
The ones that are buttons only and you don't even have to move your character are probably much

1942
02:21:43,420 --> 02:21:48,620
easier to do, but yeah, that's, um, Katana's fatality. I can, I can still worry. Cause you

1943
02:21:48,620 --> 02:21:52,060
just slammed the block button a bunch of times and they had high kick super easy to do. At least

1944
02:21:52,060 --> 02:21:56,700
that's where we'll come at two important. Oh, as she went under, Matt says, uh, it was mortal

1945
02:21:56,700 --> 02:22:03,020
combat one. That is what I do remember. Sonia's fatality was pretty easy in that game. Forward,

1946
02:22:03,020 --> 02:22:07,980
forward, back, back block. I don't know how, how do I remember that? I don't know. Sub zero

1947
02:22:07,980 --> 02:22:14,540
toward, down toward high punch or was a low punch one of the two. So, all right. Well, sadly, I

1948
02:22:14,540 --> 02:22:18,380
don't think the, uh, calls are coming back in. So I'm going to go ahead and shut down the Skype line

1949
02:22:18,380 --> 02:22:22,780
for tonight. Uh, and I think we're going to go ahead and start to wrap up tonight's show, but

1950
02:22:22,780 --> 02:22:27,580
I do want to thank you guys again for being with our show tonight. Thank you for being back after

1951
02:22:27,580 --> 02:22:31,180
we've been gone for a little bit. I really appreciate you guys being back here. If you

1952
02:22:31,180 --> 02:22:34,700

1955
02:22:42,700 --> 02:22:46,860
up here live. And thank you guys that checked us out on the podcast feed as well. If you enjoyed,

1956
02:22:46,860 --> 02:22:52,940
uh, us on the podcast feed, um, a nice five star review, wherever you found this show on iTunes

1957
02:22:52,940 --> 02:22:57,420
or Google play or wherever it is, you found the show. Those reviews go a long way. Trust me. So

1958
02:22:57,420 --> 02:23:02,860
we really, really appreciate, um, all of that. Um, that's really all I can think of for now.

1959
02:23:02,860 --> 02:23:07,180
So I think it's time to go around and get everybody's final thought. Uh, Loki, I'll start

1960
02:23:07,180 --> 02:23:13,420
with you. Your final thought tonight. Uh, my final thought is I, I am going to try to work on my

1961
02:23:13,420 --> 02:23:19,020
games again. I ought to figure out what I want to work on. Basically. That's it. Whether I keep on

1962
02:23:19,020 --> 02:23:23,660
working on what I started with the game jam or if I go back to one of my other projects.

1963
02:23:24,540 --> 02:23:29,660
All right. Dark Sakura, your final thought tonight. I was reading about the silent Hill song.

1964
02:23:30,380 --> 02:23:33,900
What's the silent Hill song from the revenge ending for silent Hill three. Oh,

1965
02:23:33,900 --> 02:23:43,580
silent Hill. I remember that. Uh, and then my final thought tonight would just be, um,

1966
02:23:43,580 --> 02:23:48,700
thank you for being here and, uh, it's, it's nice to be back. So thank you guys very much

1967
02:23:48,700 --> 02:23:52,940
for everything. Uh, that's going to do it for another episode of orange lounge radio.

1968
