0	8560	Hi, awkward intro tonight, sorry, but before we start, I want to address the unexpected
8560	11720	hiatus that the show went on for a couple of weeks.
11720	15140	This won't have anything to do with video games, so if you're looking for a video game
15140	19620	and food chat, fast forward until you hear the music.
19620	24400	If you've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio over the past few weeks, you've probably
24400	28800	heard me talk about several times that my mom had been in and out of the hospital, including
28800	35000	intensive care since February, really, when she had knee replacement surgery.
35000	39980	I'm not going to overload you with the clinical details, but the diagnosis she ended up having
39980	44320	and the main thing that she was battling was a condition called myasthenia gravis, which
44320	49560	is a neurological condition that can cause droopy eyelids, trouble talking, and for most
49560	54560	people, and I want to emphasize this if you know anyone that has this, for most people,
54560	58280	this ends up being pretty manageable and you can have a pretty normal life.
58280	63500	But sometimes, and I think due to her age, this condition flares up in a crisis and this
63500	68580	means you can have extreme difficulty breathing to the point that you have to go on a ventilator
68580	71560	and that's why mom had been in the hospital for a few weeks.
71560	76960	She had a crisis, she started improving, meds caused another crisis, she started improving,
76960	82400	she had other issues, so it was just kind of a back and forth.
82400	88000	So a few days after the last episode we did, I got a phone call while at my day job that
88120	92200	the lung muscles weren't getting better and they were wanting to do a feeding tube so
92200	94340	that the lung muscles could recover.
94340	98040	Now you have to remember that mom had been battling this condition for weeks and weeks
98040	103320	on and off since February and when she heard she had to get a feeding tube, that was the
103320	108040	point where she said, I've had enough, she's not going to be kept alive by a tube and really
108040	112100	the doctors couldn't guarantee that it would fend off another crisis for much longer than
112100	113460	another couple weeks anyway.
113460	119020	So my mom said she was done, meaning done.
119020	124760	And I spent many hours at the hospital that week and on Friday afternoon she passed away
124760	131680	and my dad was there, both my siblings were there, so at least we had time to gather and
131680	133240	all be there.
133240	137460	So for those not on Twitter or listening to Bobby, this is why I've been away and why
137460	139700	the studio at the house has been dark.
139700	143760	As you can imagine, this didn't put me in a good space for a little while.
143760	147640	And I know that those that knew why we've been on hold, you understand and I thank you
147640	152120	for that, but I needed the time.
152120	156340	My mom in those final days, she stressed to us that we needed to get on with our lives,
156340	160160	but the reality is that that's a step that's going to take time.
160160	164680	This is something that I've heard from many of you who've been in a similar situation
164680	167060	going through a loss of this magnitude.
167060	172200	So I was really humbled to find out just how many people I knew had gone through something
172200	178140	like this and it's made me feel a lot less alone and I know the future is going to be
178140	182580	okay even if it's changed.
182580	187500	I know oftentimes we talk about the family that this regular Sunday night event has created
187500	192980	over the past 15 years and I mean it when I say you all have helped me with this and
192980	197980	this is why I want to be back here again tonight to keep this going.
197980	202040	My mom should be remembered as someone that loved kids tremendously and always advocated
202040	207620	for them from her lifelong career of raising two generations of kids, then becoming a preschool
207620	211580	teacher, then raising a third generation as a nanny.
211580	215640	But I know many of you didn't get to know that and will remember her from the few appearances
215640	217640	she had on this show.
217640	222400	She had a great sense of humor and I'm really grateful you guys got to hear that.
222400	226840	I could try and dedicate tonight's show to my mom but that wouldn't be genuine because
226840	230680	every show I've ever done has been influenced by mom.
230680	235360	From 15 years of this, Hoard House, Pokestop, guys on show reading it's fundamental, Understation
235360	238640	Live, Vanilla Sky, YouTube, Twitches, all of it.
238640	244860	Mom is always going to be there a little bit in everything that I do.
244860	246880	Tell the listeners about some good things I did.
246880	251520	Didn't it make you proud when Orange Lounge Radio was in the newspaper and on the local
251520	252520	news?
252520	253520	Uh huh.
253520	254520	Good.
254520	255520	Very.
255520	259200	She sounds so convinced.
259200	261240	Alright mom, I appreciate you calling.
261240	263760	I just wanted the listeners to see what my mom was really like.
263760	264760	So there you go.
264760	269760	Well, she's like, she's like a female rob.
281520	307280	Hello my friends out there on the internet.
307280	311040	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
311040	318960	It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight, August the 13th of 2017 with episode number 696
318960	325040	of our show dedicated to video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle here at Studio
325040	328120	N7 in lovely Sacramento, California.
328120	336080	Myself Rob Roberts or Skye at S-K-I-E on Twitter with my co-hosts, hello dark soccer or Jamie
336080	337080	Summers.
337080	338080	Hi.
338080	339080	Welcome back.
339080	340080	Thank you.
340120	344520	I know while we were on hiatus, you were doing some, I was calling it faux LR.
344520	345520	You like that?
345520	347200	You did some faux LR on your live stream.
347200	348200	How did that go?
348200	349200	It went alright.
349200	350200	Yeah.
350200	355640	Um, I decided to get some news and everything out of the way while I was trying to, uh,
355640	359360	get all my streaming stuff put together because I hadn't done any streaming in a while.
359360	360360	Sure.
360360	362160	And, uh, I think it went okay.
362160	363160	Yeah.
363160	365840	I did catch a little bit of it last week.
365840	369160	So and it looked like it was, you were playing everybody's gone to the rapture, which we
369240	370240	Start to finish.
370240	371240	What's that?
371240	372240	Start to finish.
372240	373240	Start to finish.
373240	374240	You play the whole thing in one sitting?
374240	375240	No, no.
375240	376240	Oh, I was gonna say.
376240	377240	I played it in like three settings.
377240	378240	Okay.
378240	379240	Still though.
379240	382080	Cause the whole thing, I was going to do Mass Effect Andromeda and my game wouldn't
382080	383080	load.
383080	384080	Oh no.
384080	385440	So I still haven't reinstalled it.
385440	389680	That just means how much I've been wanting to play Mass Effect Andromeda.
389680	394960	Um, so I'm gonna, um, probably give that a try again in the future.
394960	399840	Um, but right now I'm actually kind of getting more into the narration game.
399840	403960	So next is going to be the, that Edith Finch.
403960	405440	Oh, whatever happened to Edith Finch?
405440	406440	Yeah.
406440	407440	I think it's called.
407440	408440	Yeah.
408440	409440	That game is great.
409440	410440	I like this.
410440	413880	I like the dark soccer plays emo games.
413880	415680	Yeah.
415680	417920	I might now cause I can do that in one sitting.
417920	420320	I might do, um, Dear Esther as well.
420320	421320	Oh yeah.
421320	422320	Yeah.
422320	423320	Cause that one was really pretty and I enjoyed it.
423320	424320	Yeah.
424680	425680	Yeah.
425680	426680	Yeah.
426680	427680	Yeah.
427680	428680	They just had a remake on PS4 of that.
428680	429680	Not that long ago.
429680	434080	So I had this one period, um, at work where I'd managed to get like flex time off.
434080	437480	So I was off the phone for like two hours, so I played it on my Mac at work.
437480	438480	There you go.
438480	439480	There you go.
439480	440480	It was great.
440480	441480	That's great.
441480	442480	Um, what was it?
442480	443480	There was another one I was gonna suggest.
443480	446400	Oh, you should, you should be doing, um, you know, this, you know, we've been on break.
446400	448760	It's been about three weeks since we did a show and I think, I feel like one of those
448760	453360	games is kind of like come and gone is the dream daddy dating game.
453400	454400	I haven't started it.
454400	458480	I didn't pick that up yet cause I just, you know, obviously the last three weeks have
458480	459480	been pretty crazy.
459480	462600	Um, so I just kind of missed that whole boat.
462600	466520	So, but I, I feel like that's a game you should be streaming.
466520	467600	I'll make a daddy.
467600	469880	If you do pigeons, Jamie, why not daddy?
469880	471600	I still have more pigeons to do.
471600	472600	That's right.
472600	481320	Um, but also, um, I'm thinking I am level 72 now in Dragon Ball Xenoverse.
481320	482320	Oh wow.
482320	490000	So I'm coming up to level cap and, um, I just did like, I'll get into that for my gaming
490000	495360	week, but good Lord, I was going to start streaming some of that, but it's gotten kind
495360	496360	of weird.
496360	497360	Okay.
497360	501280	And it is so off Canon that it makes my brain hurt.
501280	502280	All right.
502280	505600	Well, let's check in with a tech master, Loki, joining us once again.
505600	506600	How are you, Loki?
506600	507600	I'm fine.
507600	510040	Now you got, you got really sick over the break.
510040	511040	Yeah.
511040	512040	Fun times.
512160	514640	Because there was, I'm going to, I'm going to be honest, there was a part of me that
514640	517820	was thinking, should we do last week?
517820	519760	You know, I was kind of on the fence last week.
519760	523680	I was kind of like half ready, but I was a little worried, you know, but, uh, then what
523680	527000	kind of sealed it for me was that I heard you were really sick and it was like, all
527000	531120	right, let's, let's just, I would have still done it, but I would have probably been coughing
531120	536520	and wheezing and you know, I still have like, kind of like they call it, I think they call
536520	537760	it rails or whatever.
537760	543040	It's basically, imagine the sensation of having like a carbonated beverage in your lungs.
543040	550280	I didn't want to do the show at 70%, 99.9%, nothing but almost the finest for our listeners.
550280	552160	I think, I think we're good.
552160	553160	So it would have been fine.
553160	554760	It would have been, it was great though.
554760	560400	Cause like one thing that, that the one advantage of being that sick is I was able to do the
560400	565920	like, uh, like some evil silent Hill voice or like the ring voice or whatever you call
565920	566920	that.
566920	571280	Like pretty, uh, if I could do that with like without, like in the grudge, it was the grudge,
571280	572280	the grudge.
572280	573280	Yeah.
573280	574280	Let me see, like, see if I breathe out all the way.
574280	575440	Sometimes I can,
575440	580640	I mean, that's like my lungs right now.
580640	581640	That's okay.
581640	582840	It was much worse later on.
582840	589440	Like you could make a really gruesome sounding sounds like, Oh my God, why are you at work?
589440	590440	Go home.
590440	591440	You know, that type of thing.
591440	592440	I believe you.
592440	593760	Do you, do you remember when I had walking pneumonia?
593760	594760	Like what?
594760	595760	Six years ago.
596600	597600	Oh yeah.
597600	598600	I believe that noise.
598600	599600	Trust me.
599600	604400	Well, I don't know if it like, I see I at least had bronchitis, but then that the medicine
604400	605400	wasn't really helping.
605400	608960	So they put me on an antibiotic, which is normally what they do for pneumonia.
608960	609960	And then it went away.
609960	613340	So maybe I had pneumonia or they just never did anything to confirm it.
613340	616200	It's probably for the best if you had all that, that you didn't show up here at the
616200	617200	house.
617200	618200	Yes.
618200	620720	Cause you know, the last thing I needed the past couple of weeks was to be sick, but I'm
620720	621720	glad you're doing better.
621720	622720	Um, so
622720	623720	pneumonia is not contagious.
624360	628720	I overheard, um, Bobby talking to you before the show tonight and I know he was razzing
628720	631840	you a little bit cause she didn't really get to work on your game, although then he felt
631840	632840	bad cause you were sick.
632840	633840	So it was like, Oh, he
633840	634840	tried.
634840	639520	I like, I had the laptop in my lap and I was just exhausted because I don't sleep a lot
639520	640520	as it is.
640520	645160	And then, you know, constantly coughing and trying to like force yourself not to be just
645160	648840	like coffee all the time because when you're coughing that much, then it makes your airways
648840	652200	get tighter, which means I have to use the inhaler, which wasn't working that well.
652200	655000	And it was just, it was a mess.
655000	661040	And so like, I really wanted to, but my brain just is like, I can't do this.
661040	665120	And even last night, like I was like, okay, I'm gonna work on something.
665120	670760	I need to do something and I just, I can't, I just need the rest, I guess.
670760	671760	I don't know.
671760	674360	But I want to, I, I've been trying every day.
674360	677160	It's just brain has not wanted to do that.
677160	678160	Yeah, I understand.
678160	679160	I understand.
679160	680720	You know, we got to give you a little crap though.
680720	681720	Once in a while.
681760	685840	And I completely understand and I, I do want to work on stuff actually right now being
685840	689920	that of course I didn't make the game jam, which I kind of knew from before I started
689920	692840	the game jam that that wasn't going to happen.
692840	693840	We all knew Loki.
693840	698240	We all knew that being sick didn't help, you know, on top of that.
698240	702080	But now I'm kind of at the point like, okay, well what do I work on now?
702080	704800	Do I finish what I was working on?
704800	708000	Do I, everyone keeps bugging me to work on that.
708000	709000	It's time to card game.
709000	710000	Should I do that?
710000	712560	Should I do the other thing I was working on?
712560	714960	It's like, I'm kind of like, what do I want to work on now?
714960	715960	I don't know.
715960	717600	So I have to figure that out.
717600	719360	All right, well good luck trying to figure that out.
719360	724200	I do want to introduce our chat room over at live.vog network.com because we do tape
724200	728720	live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby
728720	734040	Black Wolf show at the voice geeks network, vog network.com where Bobby says coding wall
734040	735040	six sucks.
735040	738120	I've had to do that before because they were paying me to, but if they weren't paying me
738120	739120	to nope.
739120	740120	Yeah.
740120	743740	And speaking about like sleeping, you know, I, I couldn't sleep very well either.
743740	747440	So that, you know, that just, it didn't help.
747440	749120	And then I was working on top of that.
749120	755060	So you know, um, I do want to, I do want to, it's hard to motivate myself.
755060	758920	It's really hard to stay motivated cause I, by the end of the day after the kids, cause
758920	764600	the kids are so fucking draining, it's just like, I have no energy left to, and trying
764600	768080	to like do critical thinking and like thinking in that coding.
768080	769880	It's just, it's hard.
769880	770880	It's really hard.
770880	775600	Much, you know, I have so much respect for people that actually do that have a family
775600	780520	or they abandon their family to work on a game for a while, but, um, you know, seriously
780520	782320	it's so much respect for those people.
782320	786000	Uh, looking at chat, a hit stun says I tried to do Ludum Dare.
786000	787000	Did I pronounce that right?
787000	788000	Ludum Dare.
788000	789000	I think that's right.
789000	791080	A couple of weeks ago and I couldn't finish the game, had to work the Sunday.
791080	792080	So it happens.
792080	793080	It happens.
793080	794080	Real life gets in the way sometimes.
794080	797520	I mean, there was a lot of things I wanted to do over the past couple of weeks and you
797520	799320	know, just a lot of that got put on hold.
799320	803520	Um, I, I was hoping finally this year I was going to get to California extreme because
803520	808280	I haven't been to California extreme in like six years, but obviously everything that happened
808280	812480	and by the way, I do want to just acknowledge, um, a lot of you saying very, very nice things
812480	814320	about the intro to tonight's show.
814320	816000	So just thank you very much.
816000	817800	Um, I, I'm really feeling it all.
817800	818800	So thank you.
818800	824040	Um, so, but, but I wanted to go to California stream, but obviously I couldn't and, uh,
824040	826160	you know, but dark soccer, you got to go to California streams.
826360	829320	I mean, I know this is like two weeks ago at this point, but did you have a good time?
829320	830320	Yeah.
830320	831320	Had a really good time.
831320	832320	Yeah.
832320	833320	Um, got to play all kinds of things.
833320	836520	I took pictures of everything that I played, but I played journey for you.
836520	837520	Good.
837520	838520	Thank you.
838520	839520	Thank you.
839520	840520	Appreciate it.
840520	841520	Um, uh, I really didn't play any of the money.
841520	842520	I'll be honest.
842520	843520	That's all right.
843520	850040	I was, I was, I just come out of the cast, so I was wearing my walking boot and it threw
850040	854160	me way off balance a bit, but I would have liked to see some of the panels.
854160	856880	I don't know if you do that stuff, but some of the classic game designers, I would have
856880	857880	really been into that.
857880	861600	So panels there now, I don't think they do a ton.
861600	865640	They have like one room and they have like three or four panels, but you know, did a
865640	872360	panel this year for, uh, cause he designed the new, um, star Wars pinball.
872360	876600	Oh, I'm, I'm confusing classic game expo with this.
876600	877600	That's one.
877600	878600	Oh, sorry.
878600	879600	And mix.
880040	887120	I realized I was mixing up my companies now, but no, um, he did, um, uh, he did the new
887120	892840	star Wars, uh, pinball, um, and, uh, which I got to play.
892840	893840	It was pretty neat.
893840	894840	Nice.
894840	895840	Nice.
895840	896840	Great.
896840	897840	All right.
897840	898840	Well, we'll get into more of our gaming weeks and stuff.
898840	901320	We've been playing a little later, but I want to get in kicked off kickoff topic first.
901320	906200	I do want to also say one thing I did do that was productive is I got a new mic to replay
906200	909360	it because you guys might remember I was having some serious mic problems in the last couple
909360	910360	of episodes.
910360	913800	Um, so I did get a new mic, so I might sound a little different.
913800	916280	Um, so, uh, just let me know if it sounds weird.
916280	920400	It was running a little quiet in tests, so I've tried to bump it up a bit, but I think,
920400	921640	I think we have it at a good point.
921640	924840	Just let me know if it sounds weird to you guys over in our live chat room because it
924840	925840	is live radio.
925840	927560	Sometimes we have to fix things on the fly.
927560	930600	Um, speaking of live stuff, I will be back on Twitch.
930600	933000	I've, Twitch has been on hold this entire time as well.
933000	937720	The last Twitch stream I did was the Splatoon thing I did after the last episode we did.
937720	939920	So Twitch will be back tonight as well.
939920	942400	So I want to just throw that out there as well.
942400	945800	Uh, so anyway, let's talk about kickoff topic tonight.
945800	950400	Um, one game that is kind of coming back all over again.
950400	951440	This is very interesting.
951440	952960	A lot of updates with this game.
952960	955200	Jamie, you had a story about this, right?
955200	956680	With No Man's Sky?
956680	957680	Yes.
957680	958680	Yeah.
958680	961600	Tell us about it.
961600	962600	The No Man's Sky?
962600	963600	Yeah.
963600	964600	The remake.
964600	965600	Oh, wait, wait, wait.
965600	967240	Well, not the remake, but like.
967760	968760	The Atlas Rises update.
968760	969760	Yeah.
969760	970760	A little update that's going on.
970760	971760	You know a little bit about this, right?
971760	972760	Logie?
972760	973760	Yeah.
973760	974760	So they, they've been doing like updates.
974760	975760	They had a couple before this that kind of improved.
975760	980160	They have the whole, you know, um, building of your own bases and stuff, but now they
980160	982280	have a whole bunch of new stuff added.
982280	989200	So they've kind of revamped the whole storyline, added, um, improvements to their mission system,
989200	994000	the, um, economies and also some other fun stuff.
994000	998760	Um, so one thing, they have options now for galactic regeneration.
998760	1002360	So when you finish the game, it doesn't just give you like a random world.
1002360	1008440	It's more of like a, um, you have different ways that you can do it.
1008440	1015600	Like I think one of the ones I saw was more of like a, like a, I don't know, less hostile
1015600	1018400	universe or something like that, I think was one of the options.
1018400	1020040	Yeah, they did that.
1020040	1024240	That was one of the patches they did, like the one, one patches like that.
1024240	1028040	They had a version where you could do creative mode basis.
1028040	1029040	It's like Minecraft too.
1029040	1030040	Yeah.
1030040	1031880	This is more of like once you finish the game, it regenerates everything.
1031880	1036920	They had a new biome, so now there's new planets, new, um, stuff that actually looks different.
1036920	1041080	They actually have the sand worms now finally, like in the trailer, those are actually a
1041080	1042080	thing now.
1042080	1043080	A crash.
1043080	1044200	Oh, go ahead.
1044200	1046840	There's that pseudo multiplayer joint exploration.
1046840	1052360	But yeah, you, you had something on this where like people finally did something that
1052360	1053560	they were trying to do a year ago.
1053560	1054560	Right?
1054560	1055560	Yeah.
1055560	1056560	Meet up at the same location.
1056560	1057560	Yeah.
1057560	1058560	Problem is though, that's kind of still very basic.
1058560	1063280	It reminds me a lot of like, um, I don't know if you remember in fable and stuff when you're
1063280	1067800	playing, you'd see like a spark flying around and that was the other player.
1067800	1070440	And then you could join in your game and that won't accept this.
1070440	1072760	You can't actually join in the game.
1072760	1074280	There's not really anything that you can do.
1074280	1079000	But you, your impact on the environment doesn't necessarily show up on their screen.
1079000	1082480	However, that's one of the other things that they add is you can actually modify the environment
1082480	1086580	so you can actually kind of draw with like voxels and stuff in the game to like create
1086580	1089040	your own landmarks and things, which is kind of cool.
1089040	1097240	Um, they added new trading, new NPCs, um, crashed, um, huge crash ships.
1097240	1105160	And I want to say, I think there was, um, different units, uh, harvesters, you know,
1105160	1106160	more weapon types.
1106160	1112200	I mean, it's just a lot of shit, visual improvements, like 4k textures now, higher resolution textures.
1112200	1116960	Um, so yeah, and it's on sale on PC at least.
1116960	1120400	I think it's, I don't know what it is on, um, PlayStation 4 right now.
1120400	1121680	I have it on PlayStation 4.
1121680	1123440	Just look in your nearby clearance bin.
1123440	1125880	It's uh, it's showing up a lot of those places.
1125880	1127680	I'm not trying, and I'm not trying to be a bitch.
1127680	1128680	Like that's just the reality.
1128680	1134600	Like, you know, obviously this game had some serious, yeah, when it had some serious blowback
1134600	1139320	when it first came out and you know, that caused the price to drop significantly.
1139320	1142400	Now I, you know, you guys know how it was.
1142400	1147800	I didn't buy into the hype beforehand, so I didn't listen to any of the promises or
1147800	1148800	any of that stuff.
1148800	1151280	And when I bought the game, I was fine with it.
1151280	1153380	You know, I didn't, I didn't like love it.
1153380	1156780	I didn't hate it though, but like some people like really, really hated it.
1156780	1161980	Um, so I did, I did pop it in yesterday to take a look at it with some of the changes
1161980	1166180	and I do have to say, I was like, okay, wow, yeah, cause I found one of those big crashed
1166180	1171300	ships because now there's a story that takes you to one in the opening sequence of the
1171300	1172300	game.
1172300	1173900	And so I was like, okay, this is different.
1173900	1175900	This is like a lot of like changed stuff.
1175900	1176900	Yeah.
1176900	1178100	I think they have a whole nother storyline as well.
1178100	1179100	They do.
1179100	1180100	They do.
1180100	1183660	But in the opening of the game, you're not just like stranded with no explanation.
1183660	1185500	You're actually kind of handheld a little bit.
1185500	1189460	The game gives you quests like here's how to fix your gun.
1189460	1190720	Here's how to fix your ship.
1190720	1194100	And it kind of handholds you through those opening sequences of the game so you understand
1194100	1195860	a little better what's going on.
1195860	1201300	So I mean the game's kind of changed all that, but let me ask both of you guys, does it matter
1201300	1202300	at this point?
1202300	1205060	Cause I think that's, I think that's the biggest thing most people are struck with is that
1205060	1210900	most people have made up their mind on no man's sky and here we are a year after the
1210900	1211900	fact.
1211900	1212900	I think it does actually.
1212900	1216900	I think it does because you look at like even the reviews on steam, the reviews weren't
1216900	1218740	very positive on steam.
1218740	1224860	I think when it came out and now they're mostly positive, I mean it has made an impact.
1224860	1229360	People are liking the changes that they're doing with it and I think, yeah, it does.
1229360	1234140	It's not going to be like, Oh, this is not going to, you know, sell a ton of units in
1234140	1236320	the beginning because you can't go back in time.
1236320	1243580	But I think that as far as, you know, keeping it going and stuff, it is gonna make a difference.
1243580	1248340	It's nice to see them actually putting the effort in to fix the game and now it's kind
1248340	1251940	of looking more like what they were originally proposing.
1251940	1255900	Jamie, I can't recall if you played the game a year ago.
1255900	1259740	I feel like you, you didn't really yet, but does all this news about the changes and updates
1259740	1262940	does it kind of make you go, Oh, maybe, maybe now it's worth my time?
1262940	1263940	Nope.
1264740	1265740	Not really.
1265740	1266740	I'm glad for the people who enjoy the game.
1266740	1270380	I just thought it was neat that the, you know, after all this time they're finally implementing
1270380	1273140	the things that people had asked for.
1273140	1275380	So no, it's not enough to make me want to play it.
1275380	1277900	I've got other things in my queue.
1277900	1282220	Is anyone surprised that the creators of this game didn't just, cause I, you know, I have
1282220	1285740	to admit a little bit like I'm a, I'm a little surprised that they didn't just shelve it
1285740	1289280	at some point, you know, and say, okay, we, we did our best.
1289280	1290280	It wasn't good enough.
1290280	1294880	We're going to just lessons learned for our new project, which was, you know, honestly
1294880	1302120	I could see that's a very easy option, but you know, it's good for them to actually put
1302120	1306440	out a Polish, you know, at least get it to where it needs to be because people are going
1306440	1309440	to, I mean, they're going to remember it was a clusterfuck to begin with, but they're also
1309440	1314240	going to remember that they actually took the time to fix all that stuff.
1314240	1317740	And that says a lot because there's a lot of big publishers out there that will release
1317740	1323980	games and they'll never fix them like avalanche in just cause three.
1323980	1328740	I mean, that took forever to get fixed and it's still not very fixed.
1328740	1332420	So do you think this gives this guy, Sean Murray, right from hello games, do you think
1332420	1337180	it gets, you know, obviously he's the guy that a lot of internet people are taking issue
1337180	1340820	with because of all these promises that they felt were unfulfilled.
1340820	1345180	Did you think this gives him some credit back that, well, he fulfilled a good chunk of them
1345180	1346180	a year later.
1346180	1347420	It took a year, but it helps.
1347420	1350900	It's better than if he didn't because if he didn't, then if he's kind of come out with
1350900	1354260	his next game or whatever, people are like, I'm not going to believe that shit.
1354260	1355260	Yeah.
1355260	1359100	Then again, there's Peter Molyneux and he used to make all sorts of wild fucking accusations
1359100	1363460	of shit that he was going to have in his game and he didn't fulfill that shit time after
1363460	1364460	time.
1364460	1367780	So, and people seem to buy his games just fine.
1367780	1368780	I don't know.
1368780	1372340	Maybe it's just, it definitely helps.
1372340	1375180	So it's good to see that they're doing that.
1375180	1379620	Let's look at some of the comments in chat over at live.vog.network.com.
1379620	1385300	Bobby Blackwell says, the Steam reviews got curated more to only be people who bought
1385300	1386820	the game and didn't refund that.
1386820	1389300	He actually said either that or the Steam reviews.
1389300	1393540	And then after that, the people who had negative reviews got negated when they refunded.
1393540	1398520	So that could be something is that, you know, I think what Steam does, it kind of, at least
1398520	1403360	when I was looking at it in the store, because I contemplated double dipping on PC, I did.
1403400	1407280	I didn't do it, but I did contemplate it because it is on sale for like 23 bucks.
1407280	1409440	It is on sale for 23 bucks.
1409440	1414960	And I noticed that it's, it showed, you know, this percent was negative, but on top of that,
1414960	1420600	it says like 80%, 75% within the last 30 days are positive.
1420600	1423280	And it was highlighting that almost more so than the other figure.
1423280	1424840	And I thought that was interesting.
1424840	1428400	So it does kind of, it does kind of show that I'm still thinking about, but I'm like, do
1428400	1429400	I really need to buy another?
1429400	1431280	I have this on PlayStation four.
1431280	1433240	I do like the fact that it looks nicer on PC.
1433240	1436600	I have a PC that can run it nice now.
1436600	1439120	It is tempting.
1439120	1442760	Kaijuto in chat says, I love the OG No Man's Sky.
1442760	1444480	Haven't tried the new version yet.
1444480	1445480	Gamers suck.
1445480	1449040	I'm not surprised they didn't abandon the game because I've seen many devs do this.
1449040	1452200	They always backpedal for gamer babies.
1452200	1456100	I think honestly though, I think he had good, great plans for this.
1456100	1457220	He needed more time.
1457220	1459440	Sony pushed him to release it.
1459960	1464160	Time after time again, we see that it's these publishers pushing people to release these
1464160	1466560	games and they're not quite ready to release them yet.
1466560	1471280	That's probably true because the PlayStation four, I seem to remember that year, didn't
1471280	1474200	have a lot of big games coming out.
1474200	1480280	So No Man's Sky was really pushed as a God of War level type release.
1480280	1485680	And so, okay, I could see that, but the game had already been delayed several times, hadn't
1485680	1486680	it?
1486680	1487680	Right.
1487680	1488680	But I think it didn't come out in the summer.
1488920	1490800	I kind of thought it was supposed to be like a fourth quarter.
1490800	1491800	Yeah.
1491800	1494080	It would have probably been better off a holiday when they could have got some of that or this
1494080	1495440	other stuff in there for sure.
1495440	1503280	So yeah, it'd be very interesting how much did that influence play into it for sure.
1503280	1507640	Well anyway, it sounds like, you know, with some of these, I kind of think if you've never
1507640	1514040	played the game, if you like those type of Minecraft open world building games, I think
1514040	1517220	there might be something here for you, especially, you know, now that there's like a story that
1517260	1522860	kind of gives it like, well, there was kind of a story before, but it was kind of, there's
1522860	1523860	more stuff to do now.
1523860	1524860	Exactly.
1524860	1525860	It just feels more fleshed out now.
1525860	1531580	Like it feels like you're not just left in space for the sake of being left in space.
1531580	1534900	You know, you, you have a framework for what's going on.
1534900	1539520	So I feel like there's, there's a sufficient amount of handholding yet you're still able
1539520	1540860	to do whatever the hell you want to do.
1540860	1544800	You can ignore all that stuff completely if you want and just build whatever you want.
1544800	1549840	So yeah, so I think, I think the game's worth checking out if you haven't checked it out,
1549840	1553220	if you're into those type of games, but if you're not into those type of games, I'm not
1553220	1556640	sure there's anything here that's like going to sway your mind on it.
1556640	1561140	Like if you're not into the Minecraft type of games, this might not be for you.
1561140	1563840	So you know, there's that to consider as well.
1563840	1568240	But I did, I did like, like that you could kind of like build stuff now.
1568240	1569960	Like it felt more Minecraft like that.
1569960	1576400	Like I, I built a beacon to find something that I was, it's all part of a story, but
1576400	1577400	like I was building things.
1577400	1582080	I don't remember being able to do in the first release of the game or it was a lot more difficult
1582080	1586160	because you could kind of build, but it was very clunky in the inventory interface and
1586160	1587160	that part's kind of gone.
1587160	1590600	Well they even fixed a lot of the inventory stuff where now the inventory actually stacks.
1590600	1591600	Oh yeah.
1591600	1592600	Yes, yes.
1592600	1593600	That happens.
1593600	1594600	Thank you.
1594600	1599760	And as part of the story, it handholds you through the process of expanding your inventory.
1599760	1603000	It's not something you're left to your own devices to figure out like you were before
1603000	1607360	when it was like, then it kind of spread around like, Oh, if you find one of these things,
1607360	1610800	ask it to locate a drop off or whatever, and you can expand your inventory that way.
1610800	1613380	Like they've, they handhold you through that now, which is nice.
1613380	1616920	So I think more people will kind of be into it if they, they didn't get to see it the
1616920	1617920	first time.
1617920	1620240	And now it's what only 23 bucks to do it.
1620240	1621800	So yay.
1621800	1625360	Or even cheaper, probably if you can find it on PlayStation four or somewhere else.
1625360	1626800	So all right.
1626800	1628760	So No Man's Sky got updated.
1628760	1629760	Check it out.
1629760	1631680	If you think that's something you'd be into.
1631680	1635080	Meanwhile, let's talk about what games we have been playing.
1635080	1638920	We always like to do towards the top of the show a little bit of how was your gaming week.
1638920	1642340	Obviously, I know it's been a few weeks, so how was your gaming time?
1642340	1644560	Dark Sakura, how was your gaming time?
1644560	1648080	Oh gosh, I played all the games.
1648080	1651480	You know, and, and since we're covering a big period, we don't have to name every single
1651480	1652480	game.
1652480	1653480	Just kind of your highlights.
1653480	1654480	If you want.
1654480	1655480	Goodness.
1655480	1660280	Well, I played a Dragon Ball Xenoverse too, cause I'm still playing it.
1660280	1662880	I finished Everybody's Gone to the Rapture.
1662880	1665000	I tried to play Mass Effect Andromeda.
1665000	1666000	That didn't happen.
1666000	1670120	Um, I played a lot of pinball, a lot of pinball.
1670120	1674080	I've played Star Wars, I've played Star Trek The Next Generation.
1674080	1677800	You guys have had new machines going in and out of that house of yours too.
1677800	1678800	One new machine.
1678800	1679800	That was ours.
1679800	1680800	Oh, I thought it was other ones too.
1680800	1683920	Um, maybe you were posting clips playing at somebody else's house or something.
1684360	1688160	We've been borrowing Cactus Canyon and continued for a while.
1688160	1692280	And then we picked up our own Star Trek, the new one.
1692280	1697520	But at the little pinball thing, I played Ghostbusters, which was really fun.
1697520	1704640	Bride of Pinball 2.0, Black Knight 2000, I played some older ones like Bite of the Snake
1704640	1710440	or something, Medusa, you know, kind of classic.
1710480	1715400	I also played, um, the new Aerosmith Table.
1715400	1716400	That was pretty fun.
1716400	1720680	I'm just trying to see if I can get like an overview of some of the other things I played,
1720680	1725560	which of course, um, I played a Big Bang Bar, um, Space Fury.
1725560	1726560	You remember Space Fury?
1726560	1727720	I love that game.
1727720	1732280	They had that ginormous, um, Space Invaders as well.
1732280	1735360	Isn't that a ticket spitter game now?
1735360	1736800	Those giant Space Invaders?
1736800	1738160	They have one at round one.
1738160	1739160	I've seen it around one.
1739200	1741120	I think they have one over at that strikes in Rockland.
1741120	1742120	They have the big...
1742120	1744040	Yeah, play with like kind of like a Canon controller.
1744040	1745040	Yeah, yeah.
1745040	1746040	Isn't that a ticket?
1746040	1747040	I think it's a ticket spitter now.
1747040	1748280	It's neat, whatever it is.
1748280	1757940	I played one of the P3 tables, um, which was, hold on, Lady Lights, no, Lexi Lightspeed.
1757940	1764720	The P3 tables are supposed to be these modular tables that have video screens on the playfield.
1764720	1765920	Oh.
1765920	1766920	And it was pretty neat.
1766920	1767920	It was a fun game.
1767920	1770800	Is that like the hologram alien thing they had a while ago?
1770800	1771800	No.
1771800	1772800	No different?
1772800	1773800	No, that's different.
1773800	1776000	Um, this actually has like a full video screen.
1776000	1777000	Huh.
1777000	1784880	Um, so there was Journey, there was, oh yeah, they had, um, a Fantasy Zone 2 tape, uh, uh,
1784880	1785880	machine.
1785880	1786880	Wow.
1786880	1788640	And it was so much fun because I love Fantasy Zone.
1788640	1791040	It was the Tears of Oppa Oppa.
1791040	1796160	Um, I played Elvira, Willow, the Capcom side-scrolling Willow.
1796160	1797160	Oh, wow.
1797400	1802080	Not that, the arcade version of Willow was very different than the NES version.
1802080	1806060	It was kind of one of those, like, Strider too, where the arcade and the home versions
1806060	1807060	were very different.
1807060	1808620	It has more in common with Three Wonders.
1808620	1809620	That same art style and everything.
1809620	1810620	Yeah, it does.
1810620	1816120	Um, I played America's Most Haunted, for pinball, uh, SkyShark, which-
1816120	1819440	Isn't America's Most Haunted, is that the Ben Heck table?
1819440	1820800	I think that's the Ben Heck table.
1820800	1821800	Oh, interesting.
1821800	1822800	Yeah.
1822800	1825680	But it was supposed to be like based off of Scooby-Doo, but they couldn't get licensing
1825680	1826680	or whatnot.
1826720	1827720	It was weird.
1827720	1832000	Um, SkyShark, I played, um, because I love SkyShark.
1832000	1835360	It's like one of my favorite old, you know, war shooting, playing games.
1835360	1841040	Uh, Kroll, Pac-Man and Chomp Chomp, which I don't know if that's anything official, but
1841040	1842040	it was fun.
1842040	1843040	Uh, Crazy Otto.
1843040	1844960	You know what Crazy Otto is, right?
1844960	1846560	Was that Crazy Climber with a-
1846560	1847560	No.
1847560	1848560	Hack?
1848560	1851560	Crazy Otto was what turned into Ms. Pac-Man.
1851560	1852560	Right.
1852560	1854700	Right, right, right, right.
1854700	1860480	And someone had like one of the smaller machines, um, set up with like a big ROM hack for Crazy
1860480	1861480	Otto.
1861480	1862480	Um-
1862480	1863480	How was the turnout at the event?
1863480	1864480	It was busy.
1864480	1865480	It was busy.
1865480	1866480	I bet.
1866480	1867480	They moved a lot of games into another room.
1867480	1872660	Um, there's Gemini Wing, um, Ula Poco, which is another, uh, puzzle game, uh, Dan, they
1872660	1877660	had, uh, Vectrex upstairs and console games, so Dan was playing the Vectrex.
1877660	1878660	Oh, nice.
1878660	1879660	Nice.
1879660	1880660	Um-
1880660	1881660	So you played a lot.
1881660	1882660	Yeah, Hyperball.
1882660	1883660	They had a Hyperball that was actually working.
1883660	1884660	Nice.
1884660	1885660	Hyperball.
1885660	1890900	Um, I'm just trying- Oh, yeah, they had, uh, the loop in the third typing game, which they
1890900	1891900	have every year.
1891900	1892900	Um, Level 255-
1892900	1894700	But not Typing of the Dead.
1894700	1895700	No.
1895700	1896700	That's unfortunate.
1896700	1897980	Level 255, you know what that is?
1897980	1900180	That is the Pac-Man thingy, right?
1900180	1901180	Yes.
1901180	1904940	Yes, because of the- it's like, does it jump you right to the last level, or is it-
1904940	1906580	Like, right before that, I think.
1906580	1907580	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1907580	1909220	Um, it's meant to simulate it.
1909220	1912700	Um, there was just all kinds of fun stuff there.
1912700	1913700	Really fun stuff.
1913740	1918180	Dan and I are more thinking that it might be time to start selling some of the collection.
1918180	1921580	Because there's- people are paying bucks for it.
1921580	1922580	Yeah.
1922580	1923580	And we've got lots of stuff in the box.
1923580	1929980	So if anyone wants to give me $500, you too can own a Ninja Gaiden trilogy in the box.
1929980	1930980	Just saying.
1930980	1931980	Good to know.
1931980	1932980	Good to know.
1932980	1933980	All right.
1933980	1934980	So, Dark Taco's been very busy.
1934980	1936780	Loki, how was your, uh, gaming time?
1936780	1938980	I was not busy, unfortunately.
1938980	1943660	I did not play anything, because once again, I was trying to focus on actually making a
1943660	1945660	game, and that just wasn't happening.
1945660	1946660	Well, and you got bronchitis.
1946660	1947660	And I got bronchitis.
1947660	1950060	But no, I did want to- I did want to play stuff.
1950060	1957540	I ended up- ironically, I ended up playing Legos more than I did anything, so.
1957540	1959540	Like the Lego Dimensions game, or you mean like actual-
1959540	1960540	No, like, Legos Legos.
1960540	1964340	Like, I got out my Legos from, like, when I was a kid and made my kids play with them,
1964340	1965340	and now they love Legos.
1965340	1968800	And we have a Lego store in our town, actually.
1968800	1973120	There's a store called Five Star Bricks, and they sell Legos, so I bought my Lego Loki
1973120	1976900	finally because I've been trying to get a Loki minifig for, like, forever.
1976900	1980360	And so I got that, and they have, like, this cool booth that, like, it's like a bin with
1980360	1984740	a bunch of minifig parts, and so you can build your own minifig for, like, three bucks.
1984740	1988200	And so my kids had fun doing that, because they made their own custom minifig and everything.
1988200	1989880	They have birthday parties there!
1989880	1991840	I'm like, dude, I should have my birthday here!
1991840	1994280	This is fucking awesome!
1994280	1996880	Good job getting your kids on Lego at a young age, though.
1996880	1997880	Yeah, hell yeah.
1997880	2000960	I mean, I had all this stuff, I'm like, come on, you guys, don't you want to play this?
2000960	2004280	And, like, my son just doesn't want to build, he wants me to build everything for him.
2004280	2009640	And he got a bunch of Legos for his birthday, too, and so I made him put one of the sets
2009640	2010640	together.
2010640	2014000	I'm like, you're gonna put this together, I'll help you, but you need to do this yourself.
2014000	2015600	I can't do everything for you.
2015600	2018200	And he did it, and he felt very rewarded by that.
2018200	2020360	He's like, I put this together, you know?
2020360	2021360	Good.
2021360	2022360	So that was kind of fun.
2022360	2026920	As far as actual games I played, I played the stupid cell phone clicker game for Office
2026920	2028080	Space.
2028080	2033000	I am having a serious addiction problem with that game, like I can't stop playing it, even
2033000	2036720	though I don't want to sometimes.
2036720	2039080	But I mean, it's entertaining, I guess.
2039080	2044520	Every single time they do these little events, they keep changing the rules for them, so
2044520	2046180	it mixes it up a bit, I guess.
2046180	2048880	But I don't know, sometimes it's just irritating.
2048880	2052080	Thankfully, this last one they did, I was able to complete the event in like two hours
2052080	2056320	instead of five days, so that was kind of nice.
2056320	2057320	I don't know.
2057320	2060840	Aside from that, I really didn't play anything.
2060840	2066680	So I've been trying to play, I've been meaning to play VR, and actually do the super hot
2066680	2070200	VR, because I have that for PlayStation VR.
2070200	2071200	Haven't got a chance to do that.
2071200	2074540	I've been on the fence about buying an Oculus Rift.
2074540	2077720	I really don't have the money for it, but I'm still thinking about doing it anyways.
2077720	2081320	I'm like, am I gonna use it?
2081320	2082320	Responsibility!
2082320	2086600	I may just wait and eat the extra hundred dollars or whatever, wait for Black Friday
2086600	2091080	or something like that, I don't know, but it's very tempting.
2091080	2095080	That's where I'm at with the 4K, because you know I have a 4K monitor now, that was a purchase
2095080	2100120	I made I think right before the last show, and now it's like, oh I need to get a better
2100120	2102320	video card so I can play Destiny 2.
2102320	2105560	Well yes, you should get a better video card, that's actually something that's worthwhile,
2105560	2109320	whereas an Oculus, that's something you'll use every time you use your computer.
2109340	2114560	But I'm in that predicament where it's like, do I buy one now, or do I wait for those inevitable,
2114560	2117840	whatever that new one is that's coming out, like Titan or whatever, there's a new one
2117840	2122560	coming out in like a month, and so I gotta wait for that so that the prices of the other
2122560	2123560	ones kinda come down.
2123560	2126560	Because right now, a 1080 is like 800 bucks.
2126560	2129360	You don't need a 1080, a 1070 would be fine enough.
2129360	2131080	That's still like 400, I think a 1070.
2131080	2132520	I have a 1060 in this laptop.
2132520	2133520	Do you really?
2133520	2134520	Yeah, so.
2134520	2135520	Nice.
2135520	2136520	Yeah, it's fucking nice.
2136720	2143520	I have a 970 now, so I can get away with like 2K graphics on my monitor, so like Overwatch,
2143520	2146480	Final Fantasy XIV, all those games look a little better.
2146480	2151480	The only game I can play in full 4K and it runs fine is Diablo 3, but it's because I
2151480	2155440	think that game is kinda, you know, it's a few years old at this point, and I think there's
2155440	2159440	less going on, but that's the only game I can play in the full 4K.
2159440	2163520	Yeah the AMD, they have new AMD cards coming out, they're supposed to be pretty good.
2163520	2167400	AMD's been putting out a lot of stuff that's been a little bit cheaper, especially with
2167400	2170840	the Ryzen cards and everything, or Ryzen chips.
2170840	2176240	So hopefully there's gonna be more competition with that, but yeah, the 1070 is a pretty
2176240	2177240	nice card.
2177240	2182480	Honestly, you know, I was like, well the laptop in the 1060 is probably good because there's
2182480	2187580	only a 1080p monitor, so I was like, probably don't need much more than that, it plays everything
2187580	2188580	fine.
2188580	2189580	Yeah.
2189580	2190580	Okay.
2190580	2191580	Alright.
2191580	2192580	Well, we'll see, we'll see.
2193140	2194540	My gaming time.
2194540	2199660	So let's see, gosh, I've been playing a lot.
2199660	2204620	One game that I found myself playing until the wee hours of the morning over the past
2204620	2208140	couple weeks was Diablo 3, funny enough.
2208140	2211060	I think there's something about, and you were kinda mentioning this when you were talking
2211060	2215180	about you're sick and you don't really wanna have to think a lot, I think with Diablo 3,
2215180	2218700	you just really have to click click click click click and get loot.
2218700	2219700	Click click click.
2219700	2220700	Yeah exactly.
2220700	2221700	As little as all it is, right?
2222020	2226700	Like yesterday actually, I was sitting there and I'm like, I see my Overwatch icon, I'm
2226700	2230660	like, I haven't played Overwatch in like a month, I'm like, I should go play Overwatch
2230660	2234380	and I'm like, eh, but the controller's all the way over there, it's like, I just don't
2234380	2235900	wanna do this.
2235900	2240980	I probably, so okay, so you know how Diablo has the seasons and you can do a fresh start,
2240980	2244700	so on PC, some of my friends are playing on Playstation 4 and they want me to play over
2244700	2248220	there so I started a character, I got it to about level 30 but I just haven't been able
2248220	2254020	to connect with them online, but PC's very convenient for me to play so I started a character
2254020	2261180	on PC probably that Monday of the week after Mom passed and I was off work, I started a
2261180	2267420	character and I am now at Paragon 270 for the season, so just to give you an idea how
2267420	2273420	much I've been playing Diablo 3, it's been quite a little bit, so that's, that was, yeah,
2273420	2275460	that was a big game time sink.
2275500	2279140	I've been playing some of the usual stuff too, Final Fantasy XIV, I did play some new
2279140	2285620	stuff as well, I should point out, Shane came over yesterday and he has on his Playstation
2285620	2293100	4, he downloaded from the Hong Kong Playstation store, DJ Max Respect, cause that's not here
2293100	2299460	in the US yet, and I don't know if it's actually getting released or whatever, it's hard to
2299460	2304820	tell, like I don't know, I don't understand why these games can't just come out at the
2304860	2308380	same time, since yes, it's region free, but he had to do this whole thing where he had
2308380	2314780	to buy a card that was Hong Kong dollars on Playstation, he had to create a new account,
2314780	2319300	he got it and all this stuff, but it's just like, it just seems so tedious when it's like
2319300	2323020	why can't they just, it's gotta have something to do with music licensing I'm sure for a
2323020	2327180	game like that, but gosh, just figure it out, or I don't know, but anyway, so I did get
2327180	2331460	to play the game, long story short, I did get to play DJ Max Respect and I thought it
2331540	2337740	was cool because it's basically Beatmania 2DX, but on your controller, and obviously
2337740	2341540	there's no turntable, and it's interesting because they have a four button mode, a five
2341540	2346140	button mode, and a six button mode, so it's like in four buttons it's left on D-pad, up
2346140	2351980	on D-pad, triangle and circle, and then in five button mode you can use right or square
2351980	2358100	for the fifth button, and then in six button it's right and square separate, so it's the
2358140	2363260	falling notes and you hit them in time with the music, and you know, it's a well done music game,
2363260	2367140	I enjoyed what I played with it, I was kind of like, I want this, but I just don't want to have
2367140	2372780	to jump through all these stupid hoops, so I guess I could get a physical edition, I think only one
2372780	2377260	store online that I know of has a physical edition, and it's a place I really don't want
2377260	2382020	to shop unless I like have to, so I'm kind of waiting to see, I guess the game is coming out
2382020	2387980	in Japan in a couple months, so I'm waiting to see if the Japanese version might be English
2387980	2392900	language still, or how that'll work, so we'll see, I just hope there's gonna be a US release
2392900	2397260	of the game eventually, because there's obviously enough DJ Maxx fans here, and music game fans to
2397260	2403020	substantiate it, so it would be nice for that to happen, so that was something new that I played,
2403020	2409100	otherwise still some old favorites, I should mention Pokemon Go, because that whole raid
2409100	2415740	stuff, that was very very motivating in actually leaving the house, I left the house probably for
2415740	2421460	the first time after a few days, to go catch a Moltres, so I did, it didn't end up appraising
2421460	2426100	as a wonder, so that was disappointing, but at least I finally freaking caught one, so that was,
2426100	2433580	that was nice, so I did get one of each, because we did, we went around yesterday, and got Zapados,
2433580	2438660	that way we have them all, yeah, I had to buy some raid passes to do it, because we didn't get it on
2438660	2443260	the first try, but I was able, I was able to get it eventually, and I gotta say, it's, it's been
2443300	2447060	very interesting through this whole thing with Pokemon Go, and all these changes through the
2447060	2451860	past few weeks, like there's this discord for Pokemon Go, that you can join for local like
2451860	2457260	Sacramento to find other raiders and stuff, and it just blew up, like it blew up in just a matter
2457260	2462620	of days, like there's thousands of people on it, it's pretty crazy, and so that's a good way to
2462620	2468220	like find people in the suburbs, where I live, to find raiding, but you know what we found was
2468220	2473380	easier, because we ran into some really like, just what happens when you get a big group of
2473380	2477980	nerds together, there are some people that don't wait for others to show up, before they just go
2477980	2482700	and raid, you know, and it's like too bad, so sad for you, and other stuff, so honestly like Alan
2482700	2489620	and I just had better luck, we went downtown, and just went to where we saw Zapados, and like we
2489620	2495700	would have a full group in 10 minutes, like we walked up to where Zapados had just spawned,
2496340	2500860	as we walked up we saw people tapping their phones, so we're like oh great, they're already in,
2500860	2504500	we missed it, oh well, but Alan was like no, we'll just hang out for a minute, so I was like all
2504500	2510980	right, so we hung out, and within 15 minutes we had 20 people, a full group, ready to do it again,
2510980	2515060	which we were the first ones to show up for that, so it's like downtown was the place to be at,
2515060	2519460	because that's just where non-stop groups are forming, so I'm gonna remember that for the
2519460	2523380	future, for any other raids they might end up releasing, although I would imagine this whole
2523420	2528180	thing's taking a break after Monday, with all the kids being back in school, and all that,
2528180	2532540	Lucia might still be around, I think they might keep one of the five-star raids, just so people
2532540	2540620	can get those rewards, but I think for the most part, you know, I feel like this can't be the
2540620	2545660	only chance, they'll come back, I just, I don't care anymore, honestly, like I'm kind of, I'm
2545660	2550900	over it, and it's taken me a while, like I was kind of still playing it casually, and then I
2550940	2554860	might still do that now, because now that my kid's gonna be back in school later this week,
2554860	2560420	it's good to kill time, because I can, you know, spin the pokestop, he, because apparently his
2560420	2565740	school is also a park, and so it went, it bypassed that rule that it's not supposed to be in the
2565740	2571060	school, but there's a, there's a pokestop right at the school, and so I spin the pokestop while I
2571060	2577380	wait there in the morning for his, you know, class to start, but, you know, that's really the only
2577460	2581420	reason I was doing that, but now, like, actually, I have so many Pokeballs, I have to throw them
2581420	2588340	away in order to be able to spin it again, so. Oh no. Yeah, I have like 170 Pokeballs, so. Get a
2588340	2592220	clicker, like I have the Poke, uh, Pokemon Go Plus. They had those, I saw them the other day,
2592220	2596100	they had them at, like, Target. They're not hard to find anymore. And then I'm like, should I get
2596100	2601340	one just to cheat? It's not cheating, it's not cheating, it's an official product, it's not
2601340	2606500	cheating. No, I'm gonna open it up, and I'm gonna solder the, oh, that's LED to the actual click,
2606500	2610620	so every time that it notifies me that there's something there, it automatically clicks it.
2610620	2617060	I believe that exists already. It's called a Gotcha, or something. Uh, Charles, who was on our
2617060	2621220	last show when he was talking about it, but he has one of those things. He says, it's like a
2621220	2624820	bracelet, and I don't think you have to do anything with it. It's like a Gotcha, or so, I forget what
2624820	2628460	the name of it is, but I, I remember looking it up. I can figure it out for you. But, like, that,
2628460	2631780	that product already exists, actually. Well, I talked about that before that product even came
2631820	2636900	out. So, yeah, I was like, oh, this is how it's gonna work. All right. Uh, in chat, SSG100Matt
2636900	2641820	says, there are rumors that they will introduce Mew during the Japanese Pokemon Go event this
2641820	2645220	week. I worry some of that might just be wishful thinking, because people- Well, they have, was it
2645220	2654820	the, the, the low, the low-effort shiny Pikachu? Oh, yeah. We made the black into gray! Woo! I, I
2654820	2659740	do wish other shinies they would kind of roll out, or, I'm okay if they take a break from the
2659740	2665500	legendaries and decide to do, you know, to save Mew and Mewtwo for winter, or holiday break, or
2665500	2670220	something, and they kind of- How long did that take their artists? Find, replace. Oh, stop. Well,
2670220	2673820	that's how it was in the original games, so it's not like it's that different. I did see it, there
2673820	2678100	was an article I saw that there was a group of people that actually took down one of the Magikarp
2678100	2683940	ones with Magikarp, the one the Magikarp raves. Oh, nice. So, that's pretty funny. Same type, same
2683980	2690460	type attack bonus. Oh, I like seeing that. Nice. Alright, anyway, so that's enough about my gaming
2690460	2694460	time, so that was some of the stuff I played in the break, so, and then No Man's Sky, as I
2694460	2699860	mentioned a minute ago. Let's talk about housekeeping a little bit, because I do have some kind of big
2699860	2706420	updates that are important, I have to communicate during the housekeeping here. So, I am going to be
2706420	2712500	at Dragon Con in a few weeks. That is still on, so unfortunately we will be off over Labor Day
2712500	2717140	weekend, which is just, I think, I think it's like three weeks from today, that's three weeks from
2717140	2721980	today. So, we have two more episodes, then we'll be gone for Dragon Con, that one's always been a
2721980	2727820	planned break. I will be at Dragon Con, really excited to be a part of Dragon Con, and I'm gonna
2727820	2732380	be on three panels this year, tentatively, anything can change the last minute. I'll get you more
2732380	2737580	information about all that in an upcoming VOG article, but yeah, if you're gonna be near the
2737580	2742660	podcasting track, definitely come to some of those panels, and say hi. I'd love to meet folks from
2742660	2749100	OLR that are gonna be in the Atlanta area. So, Dragon Con is still happening. Unfortunately,
2749100	2756540	because of what happened with Mom passing, and me having to take a lot of time away to do that,
2756540	2762700	I am having to cancel other trips, because just, unfortunately, it's one of those things where I
2762780	2768860	ran out the bank of time off, and money, and all that stuff, and so I just do not have the
2768860	2774460	resources to make some things happen, and one of those things is MAGFest 2018. I'm not gonna be
2774460	2780140	going, so that's a bummer, but I hope you guys that do go have a great time. So, I won't be going to
2780140	2785900	MAGFest this year. I did hear about all the ticket sales, and some of the issues that caused. I made
2785900	2790420	this decision independent of all that, so it's not related to that, but I hope they're able to work
2790420	2797020	that out. And the other thing, I was planning to go to New York in October for a wedding. I'm
2797020	2802020	having to call that off as well, which is a real bummer, because I wanted to go see people in New
2802020	2806940	York. I haven't been to New York in like 10 years, but I'm sure everybody understands I have to make
2806940	2811420	the tough call. So, hopefully, I can reschedule for next year. I can go visit my friend that's
2811420	2815660	getting married, and her, at that point, will be newlywed husband, and then make a trip out of it
2815660	2821620	at that point. But for now, pretty much everything that isn't Dragon Con is canceled for the rest of
2821620	2826900	the year, but I'm hoping to do some other Expos next year. So, we'll look forward to that. So,
2826900	2832420	all right, I think that's all I have for housekeeping. So, let's get into some more
2832420	2838460	gaming news of which there's been a little bit. So, let's go to Loki. Yes, so we've, this is kind
2838460	2842540	of cool, because I remember when I actually tried to compete in this way back in the day,
2843060	2849380	back in the 90s. So, the Nintendo World Championships, they're having qualifiers
2849380	2856420	for the 2017 championships. The qualifier will be Mario Kart 7, and you're gonna have to play it in
2856420	2863380	time trails. They have two different age brackets. So, hold up, aren't we up to Mario Kart 8? But,
2863380	2869580	we can't forget about the 3DS, the true portable system that they have, the brand new portable
2869580	2875340	system from Nintendo. I see. Okay, continue. I mean, I don't know why they didn't just do this.
2875980	2879500	That was the first thing I noticed when I went to that page. I was like, Mario Kart 7? Is that a
2879500	2886460	typo? Aren't they supposed to be selling the new one, Mario Kart 8? You'd think, but I don't know.
2886460	2893580	Is that because there haven't been quality 3DS games in a long time? Oh, yeah, I went there. I
2893820	2900060	sure did. I'm also just being a little shady. It gets you hyped about Mario Kart 7 Deluxe on the
2900060	2907340	Switch. Don't even. Don't even. Alright, fair enough. Look, look, I'll stop being shady for it.
2907340	2911900	I get a lot of kids probably still play the portable one. Alright, whatever, cool. Yeah,
2911900	2917020	so they're gonna do it in two age brackets. There's gonna be 12 and younger and 13 and older,
2917020	2925020	and of course these are gonna be located at Best Buy in select cities. So August 19th and 20th,
2925020	2933500	you can do that at New York and San Jose, 26th and 27th, Chicago and LA, September 2nd and 3rd,
2933500	2941020	Minneapolis and Dallas, and finally September 9th and 10th, Seattle and Miami. And then from there,
2941020	2946300	if you do happen to make it in there, then you actually, I guess, get to go to the actual
2946300	2950220	championships, wherever the hell that's supposed to be. And they do have a specific race that
2950220	2955660	you're doing. I want to say Luigi's Mansion, and I guess the younger players will get to play
2956300	2961740	as Mario, and then the older players of the race is Bowser, or race Bowser's Castle as Bowser.
2964700	2968220	So it's already set, so you know it's not going to be a surprise. You know exactly what you have to
2968220	2972860	do. Yeah. Then it's not a special cartridge like the old school championship. They should make them
2972860	2977660	play old ass games. Make them play the fucking old ass world championship game. Well they might,
2977660	2982300	in the finals. Fuck the finals. That should be the actual qualifier. That's what it was.
2982300	2988460	That was the qualifier. What about, what about, here's a perfect, here's a perfect medium. What
2988460	2995180	about NES Remix? How about a new game? Well that, well that may show up. Didn't, wasn't the whole
2995180	2998860	point when they brought it back a couple years ago, wasn't the whole point to introduce Mario
2998860	3004540	Maker. And that ended up being like the last level, right? Was they played Mario Maker,
3004540	3008700	because there was those memes where the guy went through the door, and like there was all these
3008700	3014460	like, he was like nope, and he noped out. Remember that? No, that was, yeah, because what Kevin
3014460	3019100	Pereira was hosting, and he did a competent job and all that. He was good. And yeah, so I remember
3019100	3023340	that. There was Mario Maker was a big thing. So this kind of has a lot of people asking,
3024140	3029340	what are they pushing with this? Zelda Maker, please Zelda Maker, or Metroid Maker, or,
3030300	3036140	or Super Smash Brothers. This seems to be the wrong forum to... Smash Maker? I don't know.
3037260	3040460	What, that's the big question with your mind, like don't, don't get me wrong. I'm,
3040460	3044060	I think it's cool that, this tournament should have always been here. With their track record,
3044060	3050060	it's gonna be fucking Pikmin Maker or some shit like that, ain't it? Stop. Terrible Pikmin. Let's
3050060	3056540	release multiple games for that, but Metroid and F-Zero, fuck those guys. Well, we do know,
3056540	3060860	okay, so they're advertising, if you go to Best Buy to do the tournament and all this stuff,
3060860	3069580	you get to play, they will have Mario Odyssey there, as well as the new Metroid 2 game on 3DS,
3069580	3074940	the new, you know, the, the one that they're Metroid, not Metroid 0, but Metroid 2 in 0
3074940	3079260	style, right? On the 3DS, that whole thing. So both those games are going to be there.
3079260	3082940	By the time it gets to the last city there, it's practically out anyways. I mean,
3082940	3087260	I guess it's, that's cool that they're doing, I, whatever, that's fine that they're doing that.
3087260	3091900	Is Mario Odyssey the big title? Is that, is this whole thing to push Mario Odyssey?
3091900	3095740	Is that going to be the last game played? I don't think, but like, if you think about the people
3095740	3099580	that are going to be competing in these championships or whatever, they're going to
3099580	3105420	buy these games anyways. It's not really drawing in like, you know, it's not like, you know,
3105420	3109820	back in the day when they showed the world championships and that was part of the wizard,
3109820	3113500	you know, and then people are like, oh shit, you know, fucking competition. And it's like,
3113500	3118460	oh no, it's real too. You can actually go try it. And they were like all the, um, it wasn't
3118460	3122620	Blockbuster now. They had, well, Blockbuster was a different one. They had that actually with, uh,
3122620	3126300	it was like fighting games and stuff. Was that the world championships and Nintendo one or is that
3126300	3130300	something separate? I don't remember. I feel like Blockbuster did their own thing at one point.
3130300	3135020	Yeah, because they had their own thing with like, it was clay fighters and fucking NBA Jam.
3135020	3141340	And the one year was, uh, the Ninja Turtles fighting game. They remember they had that.
3141340	3147340	And I remember trying that cause I hated NBA Jam, but, um, I like strong with you. I love NBA Jam.
3147340	3151660	I just wasn't good at sports games are not my thing. Sports games usually aren't my thing
3151660	3156940	either, but the NES and the SNES era had like some of the best fucking sports games between
3156940	3162860	like blades of steel, even the original ice hockey, uh, NBA Jam, like all those games were
3162860	3167420	awesome. What's wrong with you? They should make them play really old games that are like,
3167420	3170860	I don't know, kids. Well, they are, they have to play Mario Kart seven Logie.
3172300	3177180	That's that's retro. Now she's pretty old. I think I was selling Mario Kart seven.
3177180	3181020	Vid power in chat says it's surprising that qualifiers are playing Mario Kart seven,
3181020	3185020	a game from 2011. That's when that game came out. That's that old. Yeah.
3185660	3191660	Yeah. Jesus sure is. So, and you know, but, but you know, all this tongue in cheek stuff about
3191660	3197100	the world championships aside, I mean the games they're pushing Mario Odyssey and, and, you know,
3197100	3201420	Metroid return to Samus, I'm going to have both those games day one, day one, you better believe
3201420	3206060	it. I'm here for both of that. It's going to be awesome. So obviously it looks good. I mean, I,
3206060	3211020	in doing it wrong, I just wouldn't buy a system for, um, the Metro game. I mean, the Metro game
3211020	3216380	looks fantastic. I just, I just can't purchase a system for those games. And don't get me wrong.
3216380	3219340	I think, I think it's neat that the Nintendo world championships, like they're doing it again,
3219340	3223420	but it's just, it's just weird timing. I'm not sure what is it they're pushing unless there's
3223420	3227980	a surprise, but I'm not going to set pushing e-sports, e-sports man, e-sports, Nintendo can
3227980	3233420	be sports. I'm not, I'm not going to set my expectation bar very high for an unveiling or
3233420	3240700	anything like that. Um, but why, why did they put it on ice for like what, 25 years, 1990 to 2015,
3240700	3246140	right? They put on ice for 25 years and then they decided to bring it back, skip a year,
3246140	3250540	two years later. This is, it's just weird. Like I just don't, okay. I mean, but I guess
3250540	3256780	I shouldn't complain. Mario Kart 7 just wasn't ready for 2015. Ooh. But if I did want to set the
3256780	3262700	bar in fan wank territory, you ready for this? Ready for this? Maybe. Cause you talk about old
3262700	3267180	games. You keep saying that you need to play old games and this thing. What if this whole thing is
3267180	3272460	how they finally unveil, not just like the virtual console thing, but Nintendo's whole
3273100	3279340	Nintendo online program with the eight bit rewards. What if the twist is they play?
3279980	3284620	Why are you laughing so fucking hard? I'm laughing because like, I can just see it now. Yeah,
3284620	3289500	we're going to play this game. We had to download it first off of the Nintendo network. Oh, fuck.
3290380	3296380	Nintendo network. Those are the, those all go together. This will never work.
3297580	3304060	The game, the game gets lag and lags console. It's like a digital download. It's not playing.
3304060	3309020	And the final game is excite bike, but you'll be playing it across the internet. Here we go.
3309740	3315020	Connecting, connecting the final game is excite bike. You actually have to play it though from
3315020	3319260	a system that is from the era with the original excite bike. They've been stored in a garage
3319260	3324300	and they're fucking dusty as hell. You got blow this shit out of that in order to get that thing
3324300	3330060	to work before you can actually play excite. Well, I will practice my blowing skills in the
3330060	3336300	meantime, then Loki is that president. He pulled out an air canister. Is this against rules? I'm
3336300	3343340	going to allow it. Is it better to blow than suck? Why does he have chapstick? All right. Uh,
3343340	3349340	let's move on to another story. Girl. Let's talk about a different company.
3350300	3354220	I want to talk about, uh, Microsoft and some of the things they're doing because, uh,
3354220	3359980	Hey, we, we have a soft spot in our hearts for the Xbox live indie games, right? Which was the
3359980	3366620	XNA games on three 16. The reason why we love it so much was because of bungee ferret tossing,
3366620	3371500	which was a game among other things, which was a game of Y Y R made that, you know, features
3371500	3375980	our little logo in it and you know, all that stuff. So 360, can't forget plugged for all
3375980	3380460	the Y Y R games falling was there too. So plug, plug. Uh, but then there was also like,
3380460	3385020	there was just some real dumpster fire games available. Also some games that were pretty
3385020	3389420	shitty, but they're still entertaining the play. Like there was like all the Minecraft clones
3390380	3395260	games that are so bad. They're good. Yeah. They had some decent stuff on there. Like I bought
3395260	3399740	some games on there. Well, we knew that the program is going away. In fact, I believe it's,
3399740	3405580	I think it's next month. It's done. Like you can't buy games anymore as of like next month.
3405980	3409420	As long as I can still play them. That's well, once they're downloaded to your console,
3409420	3413740	I'm pretty sure, you know, they're there forever. Uh, even as I have a download,
3413740	3417660	even game room, you can still do that. But, um, yeah, I'm pretty sure you can still do that.
3417660	3421820	It's just, you can't buy any new ones. So a lot of people have been asking is,
3421820	3426540	is Microsoft ever going to replace this? What's the deal? Well, it turns out, yes. Uh, there is
3426540	3432460	going to be a different version of this. That's coming to Xbox one and windows 10. It's called the
3432460	3438620	creators collection. Um, so I believe it's going to use unity now instead of XNA. So that's,
3438620	3442540	you know, a big change, but a lot of games are made in unity now. So, you know, that shouldn't
3442540	3448540	be a huge surprise that they're kind of getting away from the XNA. Um, so, uh, ID at Xbox,
3448540	3453660	the director of that has explained this as the creators program was established to enable
3453660	3459500	developers to directly publish their games, any of their games to Xbox one and windows 10 PCs
3459500	3465020	with a simplified certification process and no concept approval required developers that
3465020	3469340	published through the creators program have the freedom and independence to develop games that
3469340	3474540	are truly unique, resulting in a collection with games that can be quirky and have varying degrees
3474540	3480620	of Polish, but are always interesting. Um, that is such the politically correct way of saying,
3480620	3487100	get ready for some crap. That's the way they're saying like, yeah, we really want to promote your
3487100	3491900	independence and creativity. It's more of, we just don't want to fucking curate any of that
3491900	3497180	shit. Well, there's like, you know, Nazi propaganda or something. Yeah. I mean,
3497180	3500940	we may get around to taking that out of there, but like, we don't fucking care.
3502060	3509100	I can put a body simulator 2017. Let's do it. Why not? Oh, that's already a thing. So yeah,
3509100	3513020	obviously no. And to be, you know, I'm talking about like, wow, it's just going to be this
3513020	3521100	wasteland of garbage. I mean, to be fair, the iTunes app store and Google play are very similar.
3521100	3526060	There's a lot of fucking waste land of garbage, but there are some diamonds in the rough.
3526060	3530780	Obviously there are apps that we use every single day. There are games like,
3531900	3535100	yeah. Like for example, we don't judge steam by it's, you know,
3535660	3541980	buy everything that's on it because there's a lot of shit on there, but overall it's decent.
3541980	3546380	Same with this, this, we should give you the benefit of the doubt because yes, there will be
3546380	3552940	a lot of crap on it, but guess what? You don't have to buy the crap. Yeah. So it's going to be
3552940	3558060	interesting to see what comes of this, but I mean, to be fair, like this is, you could publish your
3558060	3562220	game. Loki, you always hype that you talk about your game here on the show. Now you have a place
3562220	3567980	where you could put it and people could actually play it. We could, I'm not, I don't, I think we
3567980	3574620	can, we would be able to make a VOG app, I think. Right. Like something where you could like,
3574620	3578860	listen to VOG through Xbox one. I mean, if it would let you do that, you can already do that
3578860	3581980	with tune in anyway, maybe not. Cause it might not be able to let you go online. I guess you'd have
3581980	3586220	to stick with the tune in app to do that, but, uh, well flappy fog could be a standalone game,
3586220	3592540	right? But it could, it could, if Bobby, the creator wanted to, it shouldn't.
3592540	3599340	What was the line from Jurassic park? Just because they could, nobody stopped themselves
3599340	3607420	to ever ask if they should. They shouldn't. Uh, let's see. SSU 100 Matt and chat over
3607420	3613180	at live.vognetwork.com says how fast until the first porn game comes out already being created.
3613180	3618460	Well, they can't cause that's against the rules, but I mean, there's, there's, there's way highly,
3618460	3628300	highly suggestive like finds a way romance simulator 2017 or, or, um, vibrating controller.
3628300	3631980	Exactly. It's all about the massage controllers because that's a thing.
3631980	3638620	That's right. Exactly. All right. So we have that to look forward to as much as we tease it,
3638620	3644060	you know, they're like, there are a few like real diamonds that turn out of these places,
3644060	3649260	you know, and there are indie games of a level like, you know, that kind of come up through
3649260	3653260	these ranks. Like, uh, like Stardew Valley was an indie game. That's, you know, huge everywhere
3653260	3657740	now. Five nights at Freddy's was made in a game creator software thing. And I was huge is
3657740	3662860	everywhere, you know? So it's not to say that just because it's this wasteland is that everything is
3662860	3667020	going to be garbage, but you also have to rely on, you also have to recognize that some of the
3667020	3671740	things you may make are terrible and really shouldn't be released on a commercial platform
3671740	3676620	like this or anywhere at all. I wouldn't say anywhere at all. There's, there's places for it,
3676620	3680700	but like some things that people make, like, especially if they're just like,
3680700	3685740	I'm just going to cobble together a bunch of pre-made assets into like this very basic game
3685740	3692140	that doesn't really function and I'm going to sell it for money that no, don't do that.
3693100	3696540	Please do not do that. Please do not do that. Cause they, I've seen plenty of those games
3696540	3703340	covered. There's plenty of them on steam and they're garbage and it just, you're better than
3703340	3710460	that. To register participation for this week's episode of orange lounge radio at vognetwork.com
3710460	3717340	use the passphrase sword as 200. Matt says the techno kitten adventure games. I'll remember when
3717340	3722380	that was new and shiny and fun. Whatever happened to that? I think he's, I feel like he sold it to
3722380	3727100	somebody else. Yeah. They kind of, they kind of ran it in the ground. All right. Anyway,
3727820	3730620	let's move on. Dar Sakura. How about a, how about a different story?
3731740	3741260	Yes. Um, well, I, um, I brought this up when we talked to Bobby, but do you remember the, um,
3741260	3746940	the Metroid two remake, um, that Nintendo requested to be taken down?
3746940	3751740	Of course I do. Cause I was, you know, well, I would say I was mad, but it's one of those
3751740	3755260	things where it's like, well, we were just all waiting to see how long it was going to take.
3755260	3758300	Am I right? But it's on the internet, so it's always on the internet. That's right.
3759820	3765660	Well, um, the, uh, creator of this fan game, Milton, I'm going to mispronounce last name
3765660	3776620	glass. Um, just got hired by, uh, moon studios to work on, um, the sequel to Ori and the blind
3776620	3785100	forest. So, which is going to be called Ori and the will of the wisps. So that's pretty cool. Um,
3786460	3793340	basically they really like what they did. They said he was a quote, incredible talent. And, uh,
3794060	3800940	he passed whatever test that they gave him with flying colors and decided to, uh, hire him because
3801020	3807980	he quote gets it. So kind of a happy ending in a way. I mean, what's interesting about Ori too,
3807980	3812300	is that it's, it's a bit of a Metroidvania type of game in itself. I mean, obviously it has a very
3812300	3816140	different look to it and the way it plays and everything, but it's a bit of a Metroidvania game.
3816140	3824780	So it's not too off the beaten path from Metroid. So interesting how there was a legitimacy to this
3824780	3830140	game, like big time. And now this guy has a career out of it, which it isn't the first,
3830140	3835260	well, I don't know about fan games like this, but I'm thinking about like, um,
3835260	3840940	well I think in mods, like obviously like Dota 2 came from even that, like the Skyrim mods and
3840940	3845820	stuff. They've had a lot of people that made some of the major Skyrim mods or even, I think even
3845820	3851580	more for that oblivion mods that went on to make, you know, other things for the game, like worked
3851580	3856380	on some of the expansions and stuff, or now because Bethesda is pushing it, they can make
3856380	3864380	that paid DLC mods shit that they're doing. Don't forget that. That's still a thing. Thank you,
3864380	3874700	Bethesda. Well, I think, you know what though? Good for him. He was able to take a bad situation
3874700	3879820	for him. I mean, a cease and desist is no fun and turning it into something good. So congrats.
3879820	3884940	And a lot of us already downloaded the remake. Exactly. You didn't really stop anybody,
3884940	3889180	but okay. Wink, wink, nudge, nudge. All right, moving on. Logie.
3889180	3895580	So Capcom just recently released Mega Man Legacy Collection 2. And with that, of course,
3895580	3901740	like the last one, they had like an art gallery, which featured concept art from various games that
3901740	3906780	were featured in the collection. However, there was one piece of artwork that was filed under
3906780	3911180	Mega Man 8 that people were like, wait a second. This doesn't look like anything that was in Mega
3911180	3917660	Man 8. What the hell is this? And so people are wondering that this may not actually be Mega Man
3917660	3923740	8. It may be something that's for another Mega Man game, because the art style for one is not,
3923740	3930140	doesn't resemble Mega Man 8. It actually resembles character design from like the Mega Man Battle
3930140	3935420	Network games. And so it kind of features Mega Man with this giant kind of segmented hand
3936300	3941500	instead of his, you know, you know, Buster arm or something like that. So that's kind of neat.
3943180	3946780	Hopefully it's a teaser for a new game. I don't know. I mean,
3948300	3952220	who knows what it is? And Capcom's made mistakes before, so.
3952220	3957180	Or was it just something where they were making a different game? Because, you know, obviously
3957900	3962140	between Mega Man 6 and 7, they shifted platforms, right? 7 was on the Super Nintendo. And then
3962140	3968060	between 7 and 8, it shifted over to PlayStation. So, and then, you know, there was a big long
3968060	3973980	period between 8 and 9. The series was essentially done after 8. And then it didn't, it didn't come
3973980	3978780	back, excuse me, until it was, oh, Retro is cool again. And the download stuff when Mega Man 9
3978780	3982460	happened and they kind of went back to that Retro era. So maybe this was something that was being
3982460	3986860	planned after 8, like the first Mega Man 9 that was maybe really supposed to be a continuation,
3986860	3991180	that just ended up getting canned or something. Who knows? But like, we still don't know what it
3991180	3996380	is and people are kind of letting their minds wander. That's what it is. Fanwank! Fanwank,
3996380	4001500	of course. Yay! Of course. Why not? All right, moving on. Speaking of fanwank, hey, fanwank
4001500	4004940	sometimes leads to some good things. Like, you know, again, kind of a running theme here. You
4004940	4012220	got the Metroid 2 guy that got the job doing Ori and the Blind Forest sequel. Well, Sonic Mania
4012220	4017100	is on its way. And if I remember right, didn't Sonic Mania kind of come from a fan project?
4017100	4023580	Yeah, it's a fan made game, actually. Yeah. So Sonic Mania is now a legit SEGA release that's
4023580	4028220	about to happen. And that's pretty cool. In fact, part of Sonic Mania, which is coming out,
4028220	4033660	it's coming out next week for almost everybody, except the PC version got delayed a couple more
4033660	4039580	weeks. But they're doing this thing where if you had already preordered it, you get Sonic 1 for
4039580	4043820	free on Steam or you get a key to give to somebody else if you already have it. Like, they're trying
4043820	4047820	to really apologize for that. But I guess some of the optimizations have to be tweaked out.
4047820	4052300	Looks good. Yeah, no, it does look really good. Have you seen the intro yet? Yeah, I have. I want
4052300	4057260	to check it out. Yeah, the intro looks fantastic. I mean, this is like this is how you put together
4057260	4061580	a Sonic game. Yeah, I'm excited to try it. And then I don't know if you saw this, you see some
4061580	4065900	of the video of the competitive multiplayer, because it looks exactly like it did in like
4065900	4070700	Sonic 2 with like the squeezy screen and everything like that. So yeah, you can actually challenge
4070700	4077820	your friends locally and play that. So that's that's really cool. So in fact, I'm trying to
4077820	4080620	see if I can get a picture of it here in the studio for you guys. Yeah, there it is. So you
4080620	4085420	can see it's like squishy, like the old like it used to look when you play Sonic 2 on the TV. So
4085420	4090860	that's really cool. So yeah, I'm excited for Sonic Mania. Darsaka, you like Sonic 2. Is this
4090860	4095260	something that catches your eye? You want to check this out? Maybe? All right. We talked about it.
4095260	4099340	Yeah, it might happen. Might happen. All right. The best part about it, though, is it's not a
4099340	4105340	full price game either. It's only $19.99. I like that. The price is right. And it's polished.
4105980	4110140	For sure. All right. Just a few more stories for you guys than the classic Game of the Week.
4110140	4117500	Darsaka? Well, you know, when we were kids, didn't you ever want to live in an arcade?
4118700	4123260	Sure. I could just crawl in a Star Wars sit down cabinet and just sleep there, right?
4123260	4127020	Hey, what would except those Chuck E. Cheese animatronics are kind of creepy.
4127660	4132540	Oh, yeah. No, that that would have been hell. Yeah. People probably don't. The kids today
4132540	4136220	probably don't have that fantasy because now we know that those animatronics come
4136220	4144860	alive at night and will kill you. Exactly. So maybe maybe kids today don't have that
4144860	4148460	fantasy like we used to have Darsira. Yeah. Well, anyway, it was reported by
4148460	4156700	Kobe Shimbun that a 30 year old person named Maihara Kazuki was arrested for trespassing
4157260	4163500	after they found him living between arcade cabinets at a game center in Kobe.
4163500	4168780	Between arcade cabinets? Well, yeah, I would reckon, you know, or maybe like how they have
4168780	4177020	some of them in a row, like a long row or in the circular setup, like some of the I mean,
4177180	4182940	I've never, of course, been to Kobe, much less a game center in Kobe. So I'm not sure.
4184620	4189420	But the same guy was also accused of robbery, having broken into a local junior high
4190300	4195900	and to steal money in P.E. uniforms. You know what, though? Those are being sold
4195900	4202140	to perverts. Well, no, hold up, because the girls bloomers maybe or it sounds like this guy might
4202140	4207660	just be homeless. And maybe that's how he was finding clothes to wear. You know, like, I don't
4207660	4211660	want to be at all like Debbie Downer, but this kind of sounds like this is a little more about
4211660	4216140	some guy who was just, you know, doing questionable things in the eyes of the law because he was
4216140	4221180	homeless as what it's what it's what it appears to be. Of course, I don't know any of the facts.
4221180	4227740	We stole about one point to three million yen, which is right. A little over eleven grand.
4228460	4239340	So. But yeah, I can't know. Yeah. Living in an arcade, probably not a good way to be
4240460	4246620	unnoticed, probably. Yeah. So unless I don't know if I was a Dave and Busters, I would crawl in that
4246620	4251180	giant life sized crane machine. I think that would be the place for it. But yes, the stuffed
4251180	4256220	animals would keep me warm. Exactly. We hide. So there you go anyway. All right. Well, look, I hope
4256220	4262700	this guy is OK and gets whatever help he needs. So we'll see. All right. Moving on. How about how
4262700	4267420	about how about something else about the police? Loki, let's let's keep let's keep a theme going
4267420	4271980	here. Who else got arrested? So there's a company that's in Santa Clara, California,
4272540	4277340	um, by the name of the coin up store. And they were selling counterfeit
4278460	4287020	Pac-Man and Galaga and tank battalion machines. So they were creating forgeries of those and
4287020	4295420	selling them as new. And apparently they were also selling cabinets containing 60 to 3000 counterfeit
4295420	4299980	games preload on them, which I mean, like, fuck, there's like so many retailers out there that sell
4299980	4305660	the multi cart things. Wasn't one of the people arrested in Folsom, which is here locally,
4305660	4308940	not that far from almost feel like when I read that story, like, because there's a whole group
4308940	4315900	of people all throughout California. I know there's a I know there's a a kind of a main cabinet
4315900	4321020	classic arcade in quotes, you know, company that is in full. Yes. And one of the people arrested
4321020	4325660	was in Folsom because they do sell those multi cars. Fuck, I had one. I bought one of those
4325660	4331820	carts for Neo Geo 60 to 60 in one cart for my arcade cabinet when I got in it.
4331820	4337740	Well, I, I remember, okay, I was looking for, I think at some point I got a bug where I was
4337740	4341420	looking for a baby Pac-Man machine. Remember I came really close. Like, remember that dark
4341420	4346700	sucker. I actually was like, can I talk to Dan? Because I know he's really serious about this
4346700	4350060	collecting and, and remember there was one, I was like really serious about cause it was here
4350060	4354220	locally and I almost did it. But when I was looking for that and then I ultimately decided
4354220	4358860	not to do it because there would have been a big risk involved with that. Um, I was looking at
4358860	4363500	maybe a cocktail machine, right? Cause those are those cocktail cabinets, right? The sit down ones,
4363500	4367660	right? Cause I remember there was a yogurt store when I was growing up that had like a Ms. Pac-Man
4367660	4371580	cocktail and a time pilot cocktail. So I'd like to have one of those. I think it would be fun.
4371580	4376060	Um, yeah, so it was one person, one of the individuals was from Folsom. Yeah. So I was
4376060	4383100	like, so I was looking for cocktail cabinets and like a whole bunch of this, like 60 games,
4383100	4387500	3000 games, all this stuff was coming up and it was being sold in Folsom. And I was like,
4387500	4391580	Oh, that's not that far from here at all. Somebody must be putting together main cabinets and selling
4391580	4396780	them in Folsom. Yeah. Those are the ones he was selling was actually main cabinets. These are,
4397820	4401580	the thing is like, well, typically some are legit. You can do like an ultra,
4401580	4407740	there's an ultra K type thing that's legit. So I'm not saying that all these multi games and,
4407740	4412780	you know, one things are not legit. There's plenty of these ultra cadence things. I think even Costco
4412780	4416140	sold something like this for a while. I want to say, um, you know, like websites,
4417260	4424700	there's several like arcade game websites that sell legit cabinets. Like when I was looking for
4424700	4429260	like, um, DVR cabinets and stuff, there's some websites that it'll sell those and they'll sell
4429260	4438220	these multi-cart things, which aren't legit, but you know, I don't know. Uh, Stoppy in chat says
4438220	4442060	Folsom. Well, at least they won't have to travel far. I think that's a, might be a joke about the
4442060	4445900	prison that they have in Folsom, which is kind of infamous because of a certain country,
4445900	4451340	Western singer that, uh, did a very famous concert there. Um, but, um, yeah, I mean,
4451900	4455580	well, all those, usually, uh, if I don't know, would that be considered a federal offense at
4455580	4459020	that point? Because they were selling those cabinets probably all across the country.
4459740	4464700	Um, because the federal offense, I think gets you taken somewhere else. I don't know. All right.
4465580	4470780	Well, anyway. All right. Uh, let's move on. I got one more story for you guys before we get to the
4470780	4477260	classic game of the week. And this is about a classic game of sorts in itself. Uh, Blizzard
4477260	4484140	is working on apparently still Warcraft three. That's right. 15 years after the release of
4484140	4490300	Warcraft three, there are some changes coming to Warcraft three. There is a public test realm
4490300	4496620	that is being, uh, I guess piloted for Warcraft three. Uh, so this is going to be testing new map
4496620	4501500	pools for one versus one, two V two, three V three and four V four multiplayer. There's also
4501500	4507020	supposed to be updates that address slow matchmaking. I, I can't imagine there's tons.
4507020	4511100	I guess there, I guess Warcraft three probably is slow matchmaking compared to like when that
4511100	4516060	originally came out over dial up. Most people probably, I think your expectations are maybe
4516060	4521500	a little too high. I guess there's probably still a big enough audience for this though.
4521500	4526700	Probably especially globally. Sometimes I have to remind myself that in other countries,
4527260	4530860	sometimes the technology and everything, cause the computers might not be as easy to get as
4530860	4534220	they are here. So sometimes like, you know, especially in other countries,
4534220	4536940	this stuff is still popular. So I think that's something I have to remind myself.
4536940	4542300	Um, but anyway, some updates that address slow matchmaking, lag, automated tournaments and
4542300	4548300	ladder board, all of this being planned as well. Now, to be fair, Blizzard did patch
4548300	4554540	not that long ago, Diablo two, I think was patched. So this isn't unheard of for Blizzard
4554540	4558860	to go back and update old games, but it is still kind of one of those. Wow. A public test realm
4558860	4563340	for a game that's that old must be a testament to the staying power of things like this. Right?
4564220	4566860	For sure. It's also good. A lot of good will for your company
4567980	4573340	in the year that you're releasing a Starcraft makeover, let us not forget. Blizzard is doing
4573340	4578540	this Starcraft HD. Uh, they don't want to call it a remake because they're, they're,
4578540	4584140	they're swearing by it is Starcraft. The only thing we have changed is the graphics pretty much
4584140	4589180	so that, but that whole release is out this year too. So something to look forward to,
4589180	4595100	maybe this is to, uh, well make people aware of that. I mean, retro is nice and all, but
4595100	4599820	the kind of, it's like the Hollywood, okay, we run out of ideas. Let's just remake everything.
4600620	4605340	Well, but Starcraft is kind of in its own league. I mean, even with Starcraft two,
4605340	4610140	the original Starcraft is still as big as it is. You know what I mean? So yeah,
4610140	4614940	there's that to consider. All right. Well, speaking of classic games like Warcraft three,
4616860	4621500	it's time for the classic game of the week. And I think our soccer found a game that's even older.
4621500	4627020	So she's going to step into the game and find a game that she thinks is worthy of your attention
4627020	4633660	this week. Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week this week? The New Zealand story.
4634860	4640140	Have you ever heard of it? I have. I don't know if I want to spoil how I heard, but it was in a,
4640860	4644940	it was in a retro game collection I had on Xbox, basically. I think it was Xbox. Well,
4644940	4649740	the New Zealand story came out in 1988 in the arcades and it was developed and published by
4649740	4658540	Taito. You play as a kiwi named Tiki, a little kiwi bird, who has to save his girlfriend Fifi
4659500	4666540	and other kiwi friends who have been kiwi napped by a blue leopard seal.
4667740	4675020	And so you have to go through the levels, which are kind of mazish and trap different or rescue
4675020	4684140	different kiwis that are trapped in the cage. So you basically have to get Tiki through the level,
4684860	4692860	avoiding fire and spice because Tiki only takes one hit, and save each of his little kiwi friends.
4693420	4699260	And you get different weaponry. You can get arrows, but you also can change them into bombs,
4699820	4704780	lasers, or bouncing fireballs because, as we know, kiwi are known for their projectiles.
4705980	4708860	Yes, I was, I was just thinking about that the other day, actually.
4709900	4716540	Um, but each of these, um, weapons have, of course, different, uh, different abilities. You also
4716540	4723740	can ride different vehicles, like balloons, blimps, and UFOs, because also, a little known fact,
4724300	4732300	kiwi travel to outer space a lot. Anyway. And you can steal them, so kiwi are also notorious vehicle
4732300	4740380	thieves. Um, look out for them kiwis. The levels are pretty big. Um, they scroll in multiple
4740380	4748300	directions. You have to explore all over the place. Um, just really, really expansive. Um,
4748300	4754300	and you have warp portals as well that take you to hidden parts of the game. And then, um,
4755900	4760620	you sometimes, if you get killed by a projectile weapon in later levels, you get spent,
4760620	4768700	you get sent to heaven, because all good kiwis go to heaven. Um. Where do bad kiwis go? Up your
4768700	4776220	butt. You also can get a special, um, ending for playing through the heaven rod of the game.
4777100	4783500	Um, there were, um. What the hell? I'm sorry, he just got eaten by a whale. Yeah. He had to
4783500	4789740	shoot his way out of the whale. Yeah. What kind of drugs are these people on? Pinocchio drugs.
4791500	4797340	Well, let's see. The kiwi's real name is Jonah. There we go. Um, you also, though, have, like,
4797340	4802140	some things that we've seen in other games. If you take too long to clean the level, you get a hurry
4802140	4808540	up warning, and you can get a power up by collecting letters that spell extend, like from Bubble
4808540	4817980	Bobble. Um, the game did have conversions, um, to other, uh, to, uh, home units. Um,
4817980	4827660	Ocean Software did computer versions, um, as well. There was the, um, NES version was put up by
4828460	4835500	Software Creations, um, and, uh, it was published, um, in the PAL regions by Ocean.
4836220	4843420	Um, but in North America, it was released, sorry, published by Taito as Kiwi Craze,
4843420	4850780	with a K, instead of the New Zealand story. Um, it was also included in the Amiga 500 Batman pack
4851340	4857020	that came out in September 1989. Because Kiwi teams up with Batman, apparently. And rides UFOs
4857020	4864300	and steals things. Um, we did have conversions that came out on the FM Towns and the Sharp
4864380	4869660	X68000 systems. Um, there was a Sega Mega Drive version that only came out in Japan,
4870300	4876380	um, that was based off of the prototype version of the arcade game. And then, in more recent days,
4876380	4884060	we've had the Taito Legends pack that brought it out for Xbox, PS2, and PSP, and PC. That's
4884060	4889580	where I played it, finally. It was the Taito Legends pack, yeah. The PC Engine port, um,
4889580	4898540	was released for Wii Virtual Console in Japan. Um, Tiki the Kiwi also appears in other Taito
4898540	4906620	games, such as Liquid Kids, Bubble Symphony, and also, uh, Fifi is in Bubble Symphony,
4906620	4912300	and Pop and Pop. And let's be real, oughta be a character in Smash Brothers, am I right?
4912300	4920860	With his stealing of things. Yes. And bombs. Um, the game was remade, um, in, uh, 2007 by
4920860	4928300	Rising Star Games as an Nintendo DS remake titled New Zealand Story Revolution, um, came out in
4928300	4938700	Australia and Europe. In North America, it was, uh, published, um, hold on, yeah, as New Zealand
4939660	4945820	Story Revolution as well. In Japan, it was released as New Zealand Story DS. And it has,
4945820	4951980	it uses the dual screens for showing you different areas, and you use the touch screen to open doors,
4951980	4960460	and, uh, use secret buttons, or actually flicking Tiki to safety. Um, you also have a four player
4960460	4966620	wireless mode, um, normal and expert game modes, and, um, better graphics and better background
4966620	4975740	music. Um, Tiki can also take several hits and can shoot at an angle. Um, the game was considered,
4975740	4984540	uh, pretty well across the board, considered addicting, although, um, the, uh, Sinclair versions,
4984540	4993100	or sorry, the ZX Spectrum versions were considered not as great. Um, the Nintendo DS1 received
4993740	5001900	pretty average reception, um, but they said that some of the special, uh, features they put in it
5001900	5008620	were poorly implemented. And there you go. All right, there it is, your classic game of the week,
5008620	5013340	the New Zealand story. I think that we should adopt, um, was it actually from New Zealand,
5013340	5018540	though? He was a Kiwi. That's about as, unless hobbits run by, I won't believe it. I just feel
5018540	5022460	like it might be false advertising, that this story was not actually from New Zealand. Maybe
5022460	5028140	we should adopt Tiki as our mascot. But we have the ferret. The ferret is dead.
5029900	5035340	I actually do have another ferret somewhere, somewhere. We'll have to find that and bring
5035340	5041020	that. There was like four or five of them at one time. There was the wolf ferret and like the,
5041020	5045260	the other ferret, they weren't really ferrets, but they were, I'm sure there's one in a box somewhere.
5045260	5048700	I'm going to order another one. And like a Nintendog, it will still be there waiting for
5048700	5055100	me when I find it. I found one of my Nintendog swag from E3. Like it still has the little like
5055100	5060060	card on it and everything. We'll stab it and say for the watch. All right, look, we're going to
5060060	5064700	take a break. When we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, rapid fire news and what?
5065260	5069660	It is a well-known fact that a Tiki do carry an arrow to dinner.
5072460	5077180	We'll be back with more of such wit here at Orange Lounge Radio,
5077180	5081820	your calls as well at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype and any emails. I don't know if we got
5081820	5085900	any, but we'll do any emails we have. When we come back after this quick break with more of
5085900	5097260	Orange Lounge Radio, right after this. Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge
5097260	5104220	Radio. Live tonight, episode number 696 for this, August the 13th of 2017.
5105180	5109900	Wow. We're looking almost at episode number 700 coming up in a few weeks. It's probably,
5109900	5114460	let's see next week is 7, 696, 698. Then after Dragon Con is gonna be 699. So it's gonna be
5114460	5118380	about mid September would be episode number 700 at this point, if you can believe it.
5119740	5123180	Yeah, it's coming up that quick. What was supposed to be, it would have been the week before Dragon
5123180	5127980	Con. I think if we had, you know, the hiatus hadn't happened. So, yeah, that sounds about right,
5127980	5132780	mid September. So we'll have to see if we can do anything special for. I should talk to our pals
5132860	5136860	over at the, the square one thing and see if we can do like a live thing. I think it would be fun
5136860	5140220	so that we could open it up and have some people show up. Would anybody show up though? I don't
5140220	5145020	know. We'll see. There's gotta be some, we'll have to invite some people like, Hey, you should come.
5145020	5148860	So we'll get some game bang or something. Yeah, yeah, sure. Why not? Why some of our local
5148860	5153580	podcasting pals? Why not? I think it would be fun. I think they just, they actually specifically,
5153580	5159740	I think 100 or 200. Yeah. So yeah, just recently. So congrats to them. Cool. Awesome. Yeah. Good
5159820	5164940	for them. That's a, there's not a lot of shows that get past 10. Let me tell you. So good,
5164940	5171820	good for them. Fat pokey stop. I think barely got past 10. All right. Let's get into some rapid
5171820	5177900	fire news. Oh yeah. Good. Thank you. Chatters. Act Def points out just in time for Loki's birthday.
5178540	5183740	That's right. That would be right. Can't have episode six, six, six, but I'll take 700.
5183740	5188700	There you go. Why not? Actually is your birthday on a Sunday this year? It's on a Monday. Oh act.
5188700	5193580	Oh no, that's a six 99 is going to be the 10th. So it would be a, I think September 17th is the
5193580	5196540	date we're looking at because September 3rd is going to be when I'm away at dragon con. So
5196540	5201740	it looks like it'll be September 17th. So I'm sick again. Yeah. Unless who knows what might
5201740	5206380	happen, but let's, let's not think like that. Let's think instead about some rapid fire news.
5206380	5212780	Loki. All right. So this was kind of an unexpected gift, I guess, but rez rez infinite made its way
5212780	5219340	out to PC this week. Um, it's pretty cool and totally unexpected, but yeah, they have it now.
5219340	5224860	It's available on steam. You can get it at 1999. They include a course, you know, the bonus DLC,
5224860	5231500	which is that area area X, which doesn't really bonus DLC. It's kind of included with the game,
5231500	5237580	but you know, whatever. Um, it does also support VR. Um, and of course being that's PC 60 FPS
5237580	5244620	gameplay and 4k resolution, uh, compatibility. Nice. Yeah. That's almost a reason to buy it
5244620	5250460	right there for the 4k and the, the, all that, all those mods. So, I mean, that is something
5250460	5255900	that's worth checking out. Um, and of course, you know, along with that, uh, some more stuff coming
5255900	5261420	to the switch, uh, including the Jack box party packs one and two, those will be coming on the
5261420	5268860	switch on the 17th. So, uh, later this week. Very soon. Very soon. Yeah. That's awesome.
5268860	5273340	I think those games will do very well on the switch unless people already bought them other
5273340	5276700	places, but I'm sure there's a new audience. Maybe they didn't. Well, they have party pack four
5276700	5281900	scheduled to release later this year. Yeah. They were unveiling some of the games. I guess the only
5281900	5288460	game coming back for the fourth one is a pivot three, three, uh, the, all the other games are
5288460	5293020	new. Uh, I know they were previewing one called monster seeking monster, which I thought was
5293020	5298620	funny. I want a sequel to the one that was that killer one effort. Trivia murder party. Yeah.
5298620	5303020	Trivia murder party. They can do a standalone of that. I bet like a, you don't know Jack style
5303020	5307500	thing. That would be a good TV show. You know how they did the, you don't know Jack thing. I think
5307500	5312300	that would be funny. Trivia murder party would be a fun TV show. Yeah. Be like super kid. Like,
5312300	5317500	cause obviously you don't kill people on TV, but be like a super campy like clue type of thing.
5317980	5321420	I mean you can get celebrity guests or something like that. You just have it like silly.
5321420	5325580	Why not? Well, actually, actually now I think about it in, I don't know if you guys ever saw
5325580	5329100	this, Jamie, this sounds like something up your alley. You might've seen, did you know over on
5329100	5334060	the other side of the pond over in Britain, they had clue as it were Cluedo as they call it over
5334060	5338940	there. They had it as TV show. It was a full on because I'm Joanna Lumley was Ms. Peacock for
5338940	5343100	one season and they would actually do these full like acting scenes. And then the contestants would
5343100	5347100	actually like grill the contestants about what was because they were trying to solve
5347100	5351660	basically the murder. So, I mean, not that obviously that is totally in common with trivia
5351660	5357660	murder party, but, but murder on a game show on TV has been done before. That's my point.
5358700	5363660	It would be funny. I think it'd be funny. Yes, for sure. All right. Uh, let's see,
5363660	5368380	going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com. Uh, Bobby Blackwell says trivia murder party is the
5368380	5374060	game all my friends want to play. And I can't get it out of my head that the announcer for,
5374060	5376860	and this is not, everybody's going to understand this, but you're just gonna have to bear with me.
5376860	5383820	The announcer for trivia murder party is Travis Donovan doing the DJ Satan thing. Like it is,
5383820	5388060	I swear to God, like it's like every time I'm playing trivia murder party, I feel like it's
5388060	5392540	Travis Donovan is DJ Satan. Like makes it even better. I know it kind of does. It kind of does.
5392540	5397420	Uh, anyway, uh, let's see. Dark Tetsuya says, uh, does anyone remember who done it?
5397420	5401500	Which was like the mole, but a murder mystery. Yes. That was just a couple of years ago on ABC.
5401500	5405980	That was a, that was a neat show. I liked that. You know, it was kind of, it kind of had a bad
5405980	5412700	ending though, because not to get too far into game show chat, but too late. The girl that lost,
5412700	5418780	that was the runner up knew who the killer was from episode one. And because she did the worst
5418780	5425180	in the final challenge, she got beaten by the guy who had yet to pick the right killer. So it was
5425180	5429740	like, it kind of got ruined by that. But anyway, sorry. I'm totally digressing into something that
5429740	5434060	I don't think anybody actually watched. Okay. Vid power says I watched every episode of it.
5434060	5439580	So you know what I'm talking about? Like the ending didn't make sense. Oh, well. Anyway.
5439580	5444220	Uh, it's, it seemed like, um, whoever the killer was in that show, it didn't fucking matter. Like
5444220	5448780	it was just about the crimes every time. Anyway. All right. I wish that show would come back
5448780	5452540	though. Actually the mole, since you brought it up, that's like seriously one of my all time
5452540	5458540	favorite game shows. And it, it really blows my mind that they can't seem to get that show
5458540	5463900	well-rated. I realized the original mole was kind of around, I think that the season one did fine.
5463900	5469820	And then season two happened right around nine 11. So it got, cause Anderson Cooper hosted it
5469820	5475420	and it was like, it was sassy Anderson Cooper, like rolling my eyes in a GIF Anderson Cooper
5475420	5478940	that was hosting that show. And that's what made it so awesome. So then they tried to bring it
5478940	5483500	back with like a couple of celebrity versions. Kathy Griffin was on one, which was great,
5483500	5488300	but then they did, um, they had like another season with, I think they had a sports commentator
5488300	5492940	guy hosting and it just, it just wasn't the same. It wasn't the same. They need to get a SAS master
5492940	5497500	to host the mole and bring it back. Cause that show is bomb. So it was awesome.
5497500	5501260	We can get William Shatner, the hosted like he did rescue nine one one.
5501260	5506140	Why? I don't know about, we don't have, we don't have, we are Robert stack. He would have been,
5506140	5510060	you know, perfect. I don't know who a good host for the mole would be. Why not? Let's,
5510060	5513980	let's let a lady try it. You know, it's been, it's been a bunch of guys. Why not? Let's let
5513980	5518620	a lady try it and maybe it can be a little, uh, little, um, sassy with it. I don't know.
5518620	5524300	I just don't know who I would see in that role. Aisha Tyler. Yeah. Aisha Tyler. Why not? That's
5524300	5530780	my go-to game show host. Cause she does great with, um, uh, the whose line is it anyway? Yeah.
5530780	5534860	There you go. That's there. I think I used to Tyler for a reboot of the mole cause she can be
5534860	5539020	funny, but doesn't like, doesn't have to be funny. You know what I mean? She can kind of
5539020	5543740	play it serious, but anyway, all right, I'm going way too far down this rabbit hole with
5543740	5549500	H. John Benjamin. So we can just get the, the Lana and Archer back and forth. Uh, let's see,
5549500	5555260	uh, looking at chat over at live.voggenetwork.com. Uh, some folks are, okay. I'm, I'm glad that folks
5555260	5560060	are with the change in here because Bobby Black Wolf says John Barrowman. Okay. Now talk about
5560060	5564380	a SaaS master and then Bobby Black Wolf also mentioned Aisha Tyler. So we're, we're, I guess,
5564380	5570460	uh, we're on the same page here. Let's see. A vid power says a SaaS Anderson Cooper was great.
5570460	5574860	Absolutely. The mole was great before it became celebrity moles as Kaijuto and Kaijuto says,
5574860	5581340	I will only settle for a Brit as the host of the mole. What about Anne Robinson from the
5581340	5586060	weakest link? What the hell is she doing anymore? I don't know, but she does. She had that one thing
5586700	5590700	where whatever happened to her, right? I don't know. You guys don't remember the weakest link,
5590700	5595820	right? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think it ran longer overseas in Britain than it did here, but it was,
5595820	5600060	it was big for like a hot minute here. Like that same year survivor blew up here in the U S which
5600060	5605180	is still on all these years later. Like the, the weakest link was huge for like two years.
5605180	5609900	And then it was kind of on that. Who wants to, who wants to be a millionaire still thing? I mean,
5609900	5615100	I think that's still around. It was on daytime TV. Meredith Vieira hosted it for the longest time.
5615100	5619100	And then I want to say it went to Cedric the entertainer was hosting it, but I don't know if
5619100	5622700	it's still doing new episodes and I might be wrong on the host. I don't know. It's like
5622700	5627900	in syndication, but like it was kind of building off of that hype. So, yeah. Yeah. So there you go.
5627900	5636380	Oh, Raging. Oh, Ragingator says Greg Proops. Yes. Ragingator, that might be the best comment you've
5636380	5642460	ever made on this program. He should host it doing the voice he does for Karl Lagerfeld.
5642460	5647180	I love it. Greg Proops is a great idea. But he has to do the Karl Lagerfeld voice.
5647180	5651580	Yeah. I love it. All right. Moving on. Let's move on. We got to get back into the actual
5651580	5659260	gaming news. Oh yes. Rapid fire news. The quickly done segments. Let's talk about Overwatch.
5659260	5664700	Speaking of death, uh, coming to Overwatch is, uh, death matches coming to Overwatch.
5664700	5671340	So, um, uh, death matches are coming to Overwatch in the, uh, developer update video, uh, explained
5671340	5677020	that Overwatch is going to be getting free for all and team deathmatch modes. Uh, so this objective,
5677020	5682380	uh, like an other free, uh, or excuse me, other first person shooter games is to get more kills
5682380	5687980	than the opponents. Now, this is a big deal though, because Overwatch was kind of sold as
5687980	5693180	I am not that kind of game. And now it is that kind of, yeah, I kind of worry that it's not
5693180	5698700	balanced for that. It is totally isn't. I don't know how that's gonna work because like,
5699180	5703260	but I blame any of those fucking support characters. I know. Right. Like how is a character
5703260	5706300	like, I'm trying to think of somebody like, I would say mercy. I mean, mercy does have the
5706300	5713020	pistol, but how is a character like mercy gonna last against somebody like this? Just pure DPS,
5713020	5717820	like junk rat or something. You know what I mean? So I was kind of nerfed the last one.
5717820	5722540	You have another buffing them on the PTR. Oh my fucking God. I can't keep track of this shit.
5723180	5728780	But it's, it's a great, it's a great, um, it's a great game. So I mean, it's weird in a way
5728780	5732380	that they're doing deathmatch, but I guess it is something people have been asking for. It's not
5732380	5738540	like it's replacing the regular quick matches options. It's an arcade mode like Lucio ball
5738540	5741820	ball is now. So they're going to do, which by the way is a lot of fun. I saw that. It's like,
5741820	5745660	I saw a video of them. Is that a mod? Is that a completely different game? It's rocket league.
5747900	5752220	It's rocket league and Overwatch, but, but it works because the character of Lucio, I mean,
5752220	5755980	they didn't like change him or anything. They changed his ultimate. That's it to make us,
5755980	5760060	to make him move faster. One thing like ice in this is kind of going a totally different game
5760060	5764780	here. Call of duty, um, auto warfare, the remaster that they did for that. They have that whole,
5765420	5772300	um, I forget the modes called now, but it's the one where one round people are inanimate objects.
5772300	5776860	They have to hide in the map and then the other team has to go and find them and kill them.
5777740	5781980	That's fucking hilarious. And that alone, that mode in there makes me want to buy that game
5781980	5786300	because that looks so awesome. It's like new shit introduced like that. So let's Overwatch
5786300	5792220	add something like that. Cause well, I would like to see an Overwatch be expanded on is the, uh,
5792220	5797580	co-op stuff. And they did this during the uprising event. They had that little mini thing you could
5797580	5805340	play with. What was it? Mercy, Torbjorn, Reinhardt, somebody else soldier or something. I don't know.
5805340	5809260	It was like four characters that you could do. And like you did like a PVE thing and I really
5809260	5814300	wish they would expand on that more or maybe a single player type of experience. But, um,
5814300	5817660	I guess we'll have to, uh, we'll have to stay tuned to see if anything like that is in the
5817660	5822220	future, but yeah, death or death mat, uh, yeah, death match team death match and all that, uh,
5822220	5826460	is no longer off the table. It's going to be put in the game. So we, I think that just a lot of
5826460	5830860	people are hoping that death match doesn't influence the regular game. Like if death
5830860	5834860	match is there and it's completely unbalanced and ridiculous, then they just need to let it
5834860	5840460	stay that way. I think it's more of like, I think it's more of like to get people that may have
5840460	5845180	played those other types of games. So like I'm looking for something more like that in that game
5845180	5849420	and they'll buy it and like, Oh, Hey, this is cool. I want to try the other modes. Oh,
5849420	5854300	Hey, I like the regular mode. Yay. I'm in the game now. You know, it's like maybe to get people
5854300	5859180	from other genres and thank you for the correction in chat. You guys, it was tracer and not sold.
5859180	5862620	Tracer was the other, of course, tracers on the box. She's a big character. And the advisor
5862620	5866860	remember it was, you know, like the years ago with the beginning of the Overwatch anyway.
5866860	5871660	So that is something to look forward to with Overwatch. Back to Nintendo. Nintendo is going
5871660	5877260	to be doing a special panel at PAX West. PAX West, of course, is happening the same time as
5877260	5881980	DragonCon. So I haven't been talking about it as much on this show, but obviously a huge gaming
5881980	5887100	convention that happens in Seattle. It used to be PAX Prime, but now they are just, they, they made
5887100	5892300	a full compass out of it. So it's PAX West and it's going to take place September 1st to September
5892300	5897900	4th. And the Nintendo panel is happening on Saturday. So, um, no idea who's hosting it,
5897900	5902940	although I would imagine, um, it's going to be the talent, probably the tree house people,
5902940	5909180	because get this Charles Martinet is, uh, at DragonCon. So he's not on the panel.
5910620	5914380	So unless he's flying back and forth, which I guess is possible, he might only be there certain
5914380	5919100	days, but it's probably gonna be the tree house gang or something is doing that. Uh, or who knows
5919100	5923420	this is in Nintendo's backyard. Could Reggie Fils-Aime show up? Miyamoto, don't hold your
5923420	5927180	breath. Don't get too hyped. You'll probably be the tree house guys, but even then, oh, may,
5927180	5933340	might they be announcing something? Could this be a new Nintendo way of doing things? You know,
5933340	5937980	we've never seen them announce something. Lower those expectations, lower those expectations.
5937980	5943180	We still have like, does Nintendo participate in games com? Cause that's right around the corner.
5943180	5946940	We keep forgetting about that. No, that's true. Is that this week? Is that next week? I know it's
5946940	5951020	pretty soon. It's yeah, it's either this week or next week. It's before labor. There's supposed
5951020	5955340	to be lots of big announcements after all. Remember how Sony didn't have shit the show?
5955340	5961660	Yeah. They're supposed to be holding back stuff for games com. So yep. Let's hear it. Yeah. It
5961660	5966140	should be an exciting show. Yeah. I mean, I'd be cool. Like if they announced something, um,
5967020	5971020	but I'm not, I don't have like high expectations. I can see like, here's a new game mode for
5971020	5977980	splatoon two. Okay. Yeah. Or a new, new DLC character in arms between mustard and relish.
5979900	5987980	I said you guys like the ketchup. Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh. So I didn't talk about this
5987980	5992460	during my gaming week, but I did fucking play that splat fest, which was mayonnaise versus ketchup.
5992460	5997340	Right. I'm sorry. You all fucking know how I feel about mayonnaise. I fucking hate mayonnaise. I
5997340	6003260	hate it. It is. It is the devil's condiment. It's it's terrible. And so like, first I rolled
6003260	6008300	my eyes when I saw the, the, the, the matchup, because I already knew, I already knew. I said,
6008860	6013500	because this, this is it. Mayo's going to win. Like I just, I just know Mayo's going to win.
6013500	6016780	It doesn't even matter what I do or what I play when it doesn't matter. Mayo's going to fucking
6016780	6023020	win. Sure enough. Mayo fucking wins. But why did Mayo fucking win? Because it's delicious
6023020	6029100	because people actually interpreted the, the, I'm going to tell Alan to put your Starbucks in
6029100	6033740	the garbage and then you can dish it out of the garbage and drink it. Because if you like Mayo,
6033740	6038940	you probably like that too. So close to carb garbucks. Was it because people actually
6038940	6042700	interpreted because people are dirty little assholes and they interpreted the whole event
6042700	6048140	as man splooged and blood. Well, that was the, okay. So when they, when they finally were,
6048140	6052300	when they showed the stages and they were like, Oh no, Rob, not only are they going to use like
6052300	6056940	one of your least favorite food on the entire planet, but the splatting is actually going to be
6057660	6062620	mayonnaise and ketchup looking things. That was the only way I was able to tolerate Splatfest was
6062620	6068540	to tell myself it's semen versus blood. It's semen versus blood because I would rather that
6068540	6073980	than mayonnaise, which ought to tell you something. Anyway, here's the thing. So I was playing team
6073980	6078780	ketchup, right? Every single fucking match I was getting ketchup versus ketchup, ketchup versus
6078780	6083660	ketchup. And when I would get a matchup that was team male, it was like players that were like 13
6083660	6089340	levels higher than everybody on our team. So it was like, like the matchmaking in it was shit.
6089340	6095260	It was so bad. I was so irritated by the matchmaking. I, I, I actually know I looked
6095260	6102700	at my win loss ratio during Splatfest. I won 20% of the matches. And that's not even, and before
6102700	6107820	you team Mayo fucks come and be like, well, that's cause team Mayo is awesome. No, it's because the,
6107820	6113180	it's because the matchmaking sucked. And most of those matches were ketchup versus ketchup where
6113180	6116620	the matchmaking still sucked. Like I would be there with my team and I'd be like, all right,
6116620	6120300	well maybe we'll get, you know, and then the other team would pop in and it's all like double digit
6120300	6126860	level people. And I'm like, son of a bitch. How is this supposed to be fair? So that was irritating.
6126860	6130620	Nintendo network online. Can't do it. Fucking stupid.
6130620	6135260	That was irritating. I was so irritated. Anyway, I already knew, I already knew Mayo was going to
6135340	6143500	win. So I just, anyway, so we'll see what happens in the next Splatfest. In fact,
6143500	6149740	I was actually thinking that would be a really good listless topic for us is a future Splatfest.
6149740	6153740	So please look forward to it. That'll be coming in the next couple of weeks to the show.
6153740	6160140	What should the next Splatfest be? All right. Anyway, I don't know what else. I don't know what
6160140	6167660	else to say with that. So let's move on to some other rapid, our rapid fire news, news stories
6167660	6174220	done quickly, right? Dark Sakura, what do you have for us? Girl, I'm not even evening anymore.
6177180	6184940	So if you like Metroid, there's going to be a Metroid new Nintendo 3DS XL.
6184940	6192060	Yay. 200 bones. I might. Somebody buy me one. I might not, but I might buy myself one.
6193820	6199420	Jamie. I haven't bought, I haven't. Here's the amazing thing about this. No, this is important.
6199420	6202860	Look, I know the same. It's going away too long, but this is important. It's important.
6202860	6208860	What about quick? All right. So we've had this talk on OLR that I'm not convinced I need a new
6208860	6213900	Nintendo 3DS, right? And you don't need one. There's nothing, there's no games. I don't need
6213900	6218060	the super Nintendo emulation. They have what two games that require a new three. I don't need it.
6218060	6225740	Right. But once they unveiled this, you know what I said? It shall be mine. I need it. It's
6225740	6233420	the precious. I need it. So finally this whole Samus system actually come with the game.
6235260	6238460	I mean, it's Nintendo. Of course it doesn't. Well, I don't know. My, my, uh,
6238460	6245740	Zelda one did actually the Pokemon for Dan. So, but I love my Zelda 3DS. It's so pretty, but
6246460	6253660	Samus she's a goddess. I know the goddess of bounty hunters and squishy alien things.
6253660	6258380	I'm probably going to have to buy it anyway. Sorry to interrupt, but it was important.
6258380	6263340	And in other news that no one gives a shit about ghost writers joining Marvel versus Capcom infinite
6265020	6267340	because no one gives a shit about Marvel versus Capcom.
6267340	6271500	Yeah, I just can't. I mean, did you finally jump off that train? Did you play the demo?
6271500	6275980	Did you play the demo? No, I didn't. I'm just saving my, my heart for dragon ball fighters.
6275980	6278780	You need to play the demo so you can get that final nail in your heart.
6280220	6286860	Why cap calm? Why did you do this? I kept calm. Isn't worried about its fans anymore.
6286860	6292700	They just want to get new people and the story. So that's a thing that happened during our break.
6292700	6297340	Dark Sakura got off the Marvel versus Capcom bandwagon at some point.
6297340	6300700	I'd rather just go back and play like, like the second one.
6300700	6304300	I think, you know, I think, I think most people are exactly where you're at,
6304300	6307500	where it's like, I'll just go back and play the other one or third one.
6307500	6312940	Although the third one, I'm still pissed off because there's a fucking stupid bad box art.
6312940	6318140	Mega man. Thank you. Cap com you fucking assholes. Or I hear more people excited about the dragon
6318140	6325420	ball thing as well. It's a good game. I mean, Oh my God. All right. Now my turn to derail shit.
6325420	6337980	Fine. Someone put an animation discussion on YouTube about why it looks so good. And they,
6337980	6344300	he basically did freeze frames of the animation. Cause it's, it's running in 60 frames, right?
6344300	6349660	You can tell by each pause where ashes and effects in the background are moving,
6349660	6357820	but the characters themselves are moving at a more stilted rate, meaning that they move like
6357820	6365580	animation cells do, you know, with a little bit of, you know, motion line and frame skipping and
6365580	6375100	things like that. So the characters animations are jumped point to point to point in live
6375100	6381900	animation. And that right there is like, that is attention to detail and probably a bit of a
6381900	6387020	programming Marvel come to think of it. It, they, they pick up the frames a little bit better in the
6387020	6393980	actual fighting, but just in those introductions and outros and things like that, it, it follows
6393980	6400700	animation rules down to the effects. And that is what, first of all, just makes it visually
6400700	6406620	perfect. It looks like you were playing the show. Yeah. That's awesome. It's kind of like,
6406620	6411340	like totally different type of genre, but like the South Park game, right? The, even the old,
6411340	6415660	even the first one, the stick of truth kind of felt like you were playing the cartoon. And now
6415660	6421500	with this new one, I'm sure it's even going to be more so. So yeah, for sure. So anyway,
6421500	6424780	speaking of, uh, YouTube's and things of this nature, I have to ask about that. Look,
6425580	6429100	you guys didn't send in any, you had three weeks to send us an email and my understanding is we
6429100	6434860	have no emails tonight, right? Our soccer. So, so, so fine. You you've earned this derailment
6434860	6438540	of tonight's orange launch radio. So let me ask Loki, cause you've been tweeting a lot about
6438540	6443100	YouTube and some of the things you've been watching on YouTube. And so you've been watching,
6443100	6448540	what is this hour long discussions about the ready player one teaser, right? No, I've been,
6448540	6451820	I watched those occasionally. Like I want to hear what people, I'd like,
6451820	6454780	I want to see what people's reactions like were to the trailer.
6456700	6462380	And I, my God, there's these people like, yeah, I read the book and this and this and this,
6462380	6466860	and they're getting everything fucking wrong. Like stuff that they're talking about. Yeah,
6466860	6472060	this happened in the book. It's like fucking wrong. And don't get me wrong. Like I understand
6472060	6476460	where people can make mistakes. However, if you're researching, well, obviously they're
6476460	6481100	not researching shit because they're just fucking put out videos. And to be clear,
6481100	6485420	we never make mistakes on it all the time. Yeah, but it doesn't matter. I don't research anything.
6485420	6490140	I do this at the last minute and I don't fucking care. So that's, that's, that's the level of
6490140	6496060	effort you're getting for me. Sorry. I don't get paid for this. So you, you earn every penny of
6496060	6502780	that. Um, no, but like the thing I like don't like is like, of course it's click baity shit.
6502780	6507260	Like these videos are like, yeah, it's every Easter egg in the trailer, every single one
6507260	6511180	of them, except it's not because it's just the ones that everybody else has said. And you're
6511180	6516300	just regurgitating this shit one more time. It's like, I wanted to like, I was like, dammit,
6516300	6520700	I'm fucking pissed off of seeing this shit. Like I wish I could just do a video and like
6521820	6525900	do my own trailer analysis of it and actually go into details like
6525900	6529420	spoilery shit. Like, you know, there's a leaked script out there by the way,
6529420	6533980	it's an early draft of the script. But when you read that script and you watch the trailer,
6533980	6537660	you're like, Oh, I know what all this shit is because it's in context.
6537660	6541020	Okay. If only you knew somebody with a recording studio and a green screen.
6541900	6547100	I just, I, I, you know, I was actually, as my backdrop was going to use my shitty ass garage
6547100	6550540	cause I don't fucking care. Why not? But we did all our in a garage.
6551260	6556780	I just don't care enough to like do all that. Like, and then, you know, also being tired again,
6556780	6560860	like I actually was like taking notes. I was trying to like get more detail of like finding
6561420	6565980	more Easter eggs, like for stuff in the background, like actually researching stuff and
6565980	6570220	trying to figure it out instead of like, Oh well, this person said it's this or Hey,
6570220	6575340	did you notice that there was the fucking iron giant there? Did you see that? Because that's
6575340	6582860	totally strict. Like how do you fuck it? It's not an Easter egg if it's in the big fucking open.
6582860	6586700	Okay. That's not an Easter egg. Do you know what a fucking Easter egg is? Easter egg is
6586700	6591740	shit that's hiding in the background that only the true fans would fucking see. That's an Easter egg.
6591740	6596540	Act Efton chat, garage rants featuring Loki. I know Loki sitting on a million dollar idea, but
6597180	6604220	garage rants. Okay. That's a name. I can do it. I've got a couch in there. It's fucking dirty as
6604220	6610780	shit. Why? But it's, you're, you expect a dirty, it's dirty. It's fucking hot. There's cat vomit
6610780	6619100	on the ground. That is where I'm going to film this. Sounds quaint. All right.
6622460	6625900	Can't afford a fucking green screen. You get garage.
6625900	6632380	SSG 100. Matt says, great grants. Get it? Rage. All right. Anyway, moving on.
6633660	6637900	Let's talk about what's coming out in stores this week. Something a little sooner than Loki
6637980	6641660	finishing a project. Loki, what's coming out in the U S there's actually some pretty good
6641660	6646300	stuff coming out this week. Um, surprisingly. So ironically enough, since we were just talking
6646300	6651020	about this star craft remastered actually comes out tomorrow. So I didn't realize it was so soon.
6651020	6657340	So check it out. Nice. Um, the game that I just can't get hyped about, I've watched every trailer
6657340	6664060	for this. I'm a huge fan of saints row, but I can not get hyped about this game at all.
6664700	6669100	Even if they have agents of mayhem, that's coming out of PC, PlayStation four and Xbox one.
6669660	6675420	I want to try it. I want to try it. I really want it to be good, but I just,
6675420	6679740	that's why it set the bar low Loki. And if it's my problem, here's my problem.
6679740	6684940	My problem is originally it was kind of like, okay, it's its own thing. It has no real ties
6684940	6688780	to the saints row universe. We're going to put some saints row stuff kind of hints in the
6688780	6694540	background, but it's, it's its own thing completely different. Oh, by the way, because
6694540	6698060	we're not really confident in this game doing well, we're just going to have Johnny gap come
6698060	6702780	in there and we're going to say, Oh, it's, it's a fucking tied in with, you know, get out of hell
6702780	6706380	because it was one of the endings, even though it wasn't quite one of the endings, but we're just
6706380	6710940	going to tie it to the saints row universe because we're scared shitless that a new IP is not going
6710940	6715980	to do well. It's just, it's fucking annoying. There might be other reasons that it doesn't
6715980	6720300	do well. Looking at chat over at live.vog network.com as 200, Matt says, I forgot about
6720300	6724220	agents of mayhem. Dungeon buster says, whoa, agents of mayhem is coming out this week. It
6724220	6727980	seemed to have zero marketing at all. Yeah. I'm thinking, I think they might have a different
6727980	6734860	problem. It's pretty, it's like they're rip off of crackdown basically, which I've ironically was
6734860	6741740	kind of saints row four, but this is even worse to that. I don't know. It's I will give it the
6741740	6745180	benefit of doubt. I'm not buying it launch. I'm telling you that much. I'll get it in the bundle
6745180	6750460	later on. Fair enough. Um, city skylines coming out on PlayStation four, uh, matter fall on
6750460	6758540	PlayStation four, a knee hog, uh, two on PC, Mac and PlayStation four night trap, 25th anniversary
6758540	6765580	on PC and PlayStation four. So some games don't need to be celebrated. I'm just saying,
6766140	6771100	uh, observer, um, which is actually, I think a pretty good game from what I hear that's on
6771100	6779500	PC places for an Xbox one Sonic mania on the Nintendo switch PlayStation four and Xbox one.
6779500	6788220	Thank you. And final, let's see, we have a sudden strike four on PlayStation four and finally the
6788220	6794700	pillars of earth book one from the ashes on PC, Mac and Linux PlayStation four and Xbox one,
6795580	6800140	but Sonic mania this week on consoles and which game? That's pretty good. Why not?
6800140	6803980	So I just have to quit. I will get to the Japanese releases, but I do have to just acknowledge the
6803980	6808940	reason why Loki said thank you there in the middle of releases. Alan being the nice boy that he is,
6808940	6813340	he just brought us all Starbucks, all of us. So I thought it was very nice to him to run that.
6813340	6817980	Thank you very much. Thank you, Alan. So, all right, Alan's keeping the show running
6817980	6822460	behind the scenes. Let's go to Japan and check out the releases over there. So coming out in
6822460	6826620	Japan on the 17th on the PlayStation four, Sonic mania is also being released in Japan.
6827260	6833100	Dragon quest 10, the all-in-one package also coming out. Dragon's dogma online season three,
6833660	6837980	some type of limited edition package is out from Capcom this week on the PlayStation four.
6837980	6844620	And, um, let's see, zero escape Toki no dilemma. Also out in Japan this week, uh, checking the
6844620	6847980	PlayStation Vita, believe it or not. I don't think there's anything this week on the Vita.
6847980	6852620	Those releases don't pick up again until the 24th. So nothing to look forward to this week
6852620	6859980	on the Vita. Uh, actually, well, believe it or not in Japan, there's still basically the space
6859980	6865260	that you would have dedicated to the Xbox one here is dedicated to the, I only say that out of
6865260	6870620	sadness because I wish they would release a new Sony system that was actually comparable to like
6870620	6875180	a switch or something. I understand. I understand. Uh, so really outside of that, nothing on 3DS or
6875180	6879900	switch either. So it's a somewhat of a slower week, a little bit in Japan, although there is
6879900	6884700	a dragon quest release, but then again, it's kind of a repackaging, so it's not as big a deal,
6884700	6890700	but anyhow, how about the UK dark soccer in the UK? We've got a few things. Actually,
6890700	6897420	it's kind of a busy week on the 15th night trap, blah, blah. On the 16th, we have bound for
6897420	6905500	PlayStation four and Conan exiles for the Xbox one. On the 17th, we have, I'm going to Zlatan
6905500	6915020	legends for iOS. On the 18th, we have agents of mayhem for PS4, Xbox one and PC and thumper for
6915020	6923420	Xbox one X and Xbox one. Okay. Thumper. Yeah. The Xbox one X isn't even out yet. So I don't know
6923420	6928460	whether it says Xbox one X. I'm like, that's weird. That's weird that that site has it. But
6928700	6935260	thumper is that cool music game that is, it's kind of hard. Yeah. Yeah. But it's, it's, it's
6935260	6939900	probably most well known in its PlayStation VR form, but it is on the switch as well. So
6939900	6946780	it's a hard game. It's a very hard game, but it's fun. I like it. There's like the music,
6946780	6950060	it's like industrial music and it's not like commercial stuff. It's all like,
6950620	6956380	you know, it's noise. It's a very noisy game. It's good. Like experimental. Yeah. Kinda.
6957100	6961660	All right. Uh, as mentioned, we didn't get any emails this week, sad face or the past three
6961660	6967260	weeks in fact. Uh, but to be fair because of the hiatus, maybe you guys kind of just figured,
6967260	6970540	you know, we weren't taking them for a little while, but let me just remind you all the email
6970540	6975020	bag is open once again. So please feel free to send your emails, participate at orange
6975020	6979420	lounge radio.com. If you want to participate with the mailbag segment. So yeah, emails open once
6979420	6983340	again, participate at orange launch radio.com. In the meantime, just a few more stories for you
6983340	6987180	guys. Then we'll get to the Skype line and other way for you to participate at orange lounge radio
6987180	6994540	on Skype, Loki. So, um, this is kind of cool that they're actually considering e-sports as becoming
6994540	7002620	part of the 2024 Olympic games. Apparently they are, um, considering it along with, with, um,
7002620	7006860	you know, including it with new events because they kind of do this each route. Like when they
7006860	7012140	have a new games coming out, they'll add new events. So in fact, they, I think one of the
7012140	7016060	upcoming summer games, I think has like a skateboarding or something in there now. Oh,
7016060	7021100	wow. Something different. But, um, they're adding new stuff all the time. And one of the
7021100	7026540	reasons that they're considering this even more is because you may not realize, um, at least I don't,
7026540	7031580	um, that aside from the Olympics, there's also the Asian games as well. And that actually isn't
7031580	7037340	being included in the Asian games. E-sports is part of the 2022 Asian games and the 2018 Asian
7037340	7041980	games in Indonesia. So that's something that's kind of cool that this is actually being,
7042940	7049260	you know, adapted in these major, you know, I remember 10 years ago when we were focused
7049260	7054620	more on music based games and we kept having that whole is DDR a sport. Remember that that was
7055180	7059420	like, it may be one of the Scandinavian countries did make it a sport. I remember that was a big
7059420	7063660	thing we talked about for awhile and, uh, we kind of talked about, wouldn't it be funny if
7063660	7067180	DDR was in the Olympics and we kind of laughed it off that it's never going to happen, but
7067180	7073660	here we are now the landscapes changed. E-sports is growing very, very big. Um,
7073660	7078620	not just with things like star craft and things like, you know, Dota, but now we see
7078620	7083580	Overwatch and the Overwatch league. I mean, that, you know, is looking more and more like they're
7083580	7088220	trying to do like a, I don't know if I would call it the NFL, maybe more like the XFL.
7088780	7094700	Anyone remember the XFL? Um, but I, but still I'm still curious really to see where that goes.
7094700	7099580	Uh, it looks very exciting. And then, so yeah, it seems like with E-sports taking off as it is
7099580	7103740	this, I mean, 10 years ago I would have said, Oh, come on, this is never going to, the Olympics
7103740	7106220	is never going to take this seriously. Kind of like the thing is they're like,
7106220	7111820	they're trying to understand, you know, is it a sport? You know, it's still like,
7111820	7116220	kind of how do we measure it? How do you define a sport? I mean, a lot of, you know,
7116220	7121420	the Olympics, you think, you know, physical sport and stuff, whereas, but isn't chess in the
7121420	7127260	Olympics and that's not a physical sport. That's more of a mental sport. So there is mental sports.
7127260	7132460	Yeah. I mean, there, there is a lot of that in there. I mean, creativity and stuff with even like
7132460	7136700	some of the, you know, the gymnastics routines. I mean, still, I'm not going to argue that that's
7136700	7141260	not physical, but there's a lot of like, you know, designing and creativity and stuff to that,
7141260	7147740	that your routines and stuff. So maybe with that strategy and this critical thinking and, you know,
7147740	7153100	quick reflexes that could tie in with this stuff. I think by the time we get there, you know,
7153100	7157180	especially when you consider that, you know, everybody growing up with gaming and stuff
7157180	7161660	by that time, I mean, that's, you know, a few years away, still seven years away, by the way,
7161660	7166860	I mean, yeah, that could be more accepted by then. Yeah. It's gonna be very interesting to see how
7166860	7172140	that plays out. And finally, after all these years, the Olympics is coming back to the States
7172140	7179020	officially in 2028. Uh, and that's the first time the summer game, LA, LA, they did this
7179020	7184060	weird thing that they don't usually do, but they kind of co-awarded Olympic games to Paris and LA
7184060	7188860	at the same time, basically, I think LA still has some dotted lines to sign off on and so forth,
7188860	7192860	but it looking very certain that LA is going to have the 2028 games, which, you know, they
7192860	7199740	hosted in 84. Um, but otherwise the United States has not hosted an Olympic games, a summer games
7199820	7205820	since Atlanta in 96. That was a long time ago. Um, they did do a winter games in Salt Lake City,
7205820	7210380	I think was the last one in 2002, if I remember right. But even then, you know, that's still,
7210380	7216060	still going to be like over 20 years, uh, without the States hosting. So, um, the only reason,
7216060	7219900	only reason I bring that up is because, you know, esports, if it does well in Paris,
7219900	7225580	could be a big part of the LA games. Um, and you know, at the end of the day, the Olympics is
7225580	7231740	a business. It needs to make money. And some, there, there is some, sometimes some not so
7231740	7235100	great news about the Olympics out there and some money, some cities that have lost.
7235100	7237260	Well, I got to wonder too, like with the Olympics, like,
7238220	7242380	maybe they're not drawing the same audiences that they used to anymore. Like they're,
7243020	7247740	you know, losing out in certain demographics. And so they're trying to get that younger
7247740	7252060	demographic. I think so. And I think one of the biggest mistakes that they've been making is
7252060	7259260	specifically NBC here in the States with the tape delay of the games that are happening in Rio.
7259260	7264380	And when we live in an internet day and age where all that stuff is instant, like, um, you know,
7264380	7270860	NBC, I think is really going to have to adapt their way of thinking for Tokyo in 2020. Um,
7270860	7274140	or they're going to just hemorrhage even more people because of the internet and,
7274140	7278860	and other ways that people can get this information. So, um, you know, I think,
7278940	7283260	I think they kind of have to figure that out, but you know, at the end of the day, yeah,
7283260	7288540	it is a business, but it's also, it's a huge part of TV. So if you think about it,
7288540	7297100	if e-sports ends up a part of the 2024 games, we could see e-sports on a major broadcast network,
7297100	7303580	NBC by 2024. There's something to think about the same network that shows Monday night football,
7303580	7308780	right? Does NBC show that or does that, does NBC still show football? Is that all Fox now?
7309500	7315420	I don't know. But anyway, you get the drift, the same family of, of networks that shows Monday
7315420	7321180	night football could show speaking of things that are on TV. That's kind of unusual like that. Um,
7321180	7328780	one of the things is I mentioned covers a tangent ESPN actually did the ESPN eight, the Ocho.
7328780	7334700	I heard about like, was it like a certain amount of eight? Yeah. So they did that for August 8th
7334700	7341900	and that sounds awesome. They, they replayed the, um, uh, uh, fighting game stuff. Evo,
7341900	7346220	they replayed Evo during that was part of the block. Yeah. So it was kind of neat.
7347260	7351180	All right. Anyhow, a little bit of a tangent, but we've had some of those tonight.
7351180	7356620	Uh, let's see, let's get to another story about Capcom and, uh, oh, they're not happy about
7356620	7362540	street fighter costume mods. Uh, that's because there were some street fighter nude mod creators.
7363500	7366220	Well, now I can't believe Capcom would take issue to this.
7367740	7373980	Say what? Anyway, so these two modders, uh, brutal ACE and Cal Dentar six, six, six. I hope I said
7373980	7380300	that right. They had Patrion pages that solicited donations from fans. So I guess they weren't
7380300	7385820	charging for the mods per se, but it was one of those. If you like these titties, subscribe to my
7385900	7390380	Patrion basically. Well, the mom likes these titties. You give me those biddies.
7393260	7397500	I'm going to put that, I'm going to put that on my Twitch channel. You like these titties,
7397500	7401580	give me them biddies. Except you're not supposed to solicit that stuff on Twitch, but anyway,
7401580	7405500	it's all in fun and you've been banned. All right. And I've been banned from Twitch. Oh,
7405500	7410700	all right. Uh, so anyway, uh, one of the mods, so brutal ACE had a Chun Li mod, but in a wonder
7410700	7418620	woman costume and let's see, uh, Cal Dentar had a Kami mod in 2B's costume from Nier Automata.
7418620	7424140	So obviously there's copyright violations going on all over the place. But, uh, of course these
7424140	7430380	same modders made naked female fighters or female fighters in string bikinis. Uh, there's also
7430380	7436940	risque mods, such as barefoot mods and breast jiggling mods. Oh my God. They didn't have shoes.
7436940	7443580	They were barefoot. How risque, but nothing for men. Go figure. Nothing for the male fighters.
7443580	7448460	I think that there are, but it's just, you know, but not these guys mention it. None of these guys.
7448460	7453740	So anyhow, the Patreon page for Cal Dentar 6, 6, 6 was deleted along with all the records of
7453740	7459500	the earnings, uh, and so forth. So, um, let's see brutal ACE says he always offered his mod,
7459500	7465420	it's free downloads, but the Patreon supporters did get one week of advanced exclusive access
7465420	7471820	to all new mods. So this creates a whole big issue, uh, between Patreon and so forth. So,
7471820	7475980	you know, if you're going to ask for people's money on Patreon, make sure what you're doing is
7475980	7482380	legal. I honestly don't think that they had, they could do this to his Patreon page, honestly,
7482380	7487980	cause I get their thought process. Their thought process is he charging for mods for our game and
7487980	7495580	we don't like that. Honestly though, modding your game is fair use. So kind of fuck off.
7496380	7500860	Well, but if you're putting up a Patreon page and the centerpiece of that Patreon page is
7500860	7505820	I will deliver you nude mods early. If you give me money, it's kind of walking that line there.
7505820	7510540	I think this game been out, there's nude bonds already. There's been new mods since like the
7510540	7515660	game came five minutes before the five minutes after it was out. I mean, come on. Like that's
7515740	7520860	stupid. Oh, and, and, Oh yes. Now that you've taken down his page, Oh, I'm sure that the
7520860	7525500	new mods will never ever come out. Oh wait, they've already been out. It's done nothing.
7526300	7530620	Uh, dungeon buster and chat jokes, street fighter five dead or alive. You know, you joke,
7530620	7536140	but now that you bring that up, speaking of the whole like man mods, I have to say I was, I was,
7536140	7540540	um, I was pleasantly surprised. I was looking in the PlayStation store for the new releases
7540540	7545100	and what is it? Dead or alive five final round or last round. I'm sorry. I forget the name of the
7545100	7551580	game, but they released some new DLC and of course it is the usual lots of ladies and very
7551580	7556140	skimpy types of bathing suits and so forth. What you would expect. However, to our soccer, I don't
7556140	7563580	know if you saw this, there were also some men in speedos as part of this. So I was like, okay,
7563580	7570540	it was, it was nice. It was nice. So, uh, quality was the Overwatch. Of course there's like two
7570540	7577420	dudes in speedos and like summer DLC. Oh yeah. The Overwatch with the McCree who I've never really
7577420	7582300	paid attention to before. Yes. Yes. I did notice that. Yes I did. Yes I did. I sure did. Anyway.
7583420	7588940	All right. I posted about that on Twitter. Look, and look, I don't even, you know, I don't,
7588940	7594060	wherever you guys fall on the, if you, whatever gender you're into or not into or so forth,
7594060	7600220	you have to go, okay. It's, it's nice to have the same for everybody that folks can have whatever
7600220	7605340	they like. So, all right. Anyway, uh, moving on, let's get to something. Let's get to something
7605340	7609660	a little more, uh, a little more retro, a little more classy in gaming. Shall we DarkSaga? What
7609660	7613900	do you have for us? Are we having the classy game of the week? Yes. The classy game of the week.
7614940	7624060	Well, all right. We have talked about this game in various iterations and there is going to be
7624060	7632140	a Tempest 4000 because they're really freaking creative. Yes. Actually, it's funny when we pick
7632140	7640220	up the cat with Midna, we go, got you. These guys are nerds. It's become a joke in my house.
7641660	7650300	But anyway, it is being developed by Jeff Minter and it is, yeah, going to be the continuation in
7650300	7659340	Tempest 2000 and Tempest 3000, which I think was, uh, not even a fully released game. It was like
7659340	7664060	prototype. How do you remember Tempest? I remember hearing of a Tempest 3000, but I don't remember.
7664060	7672460	I played it in an Atari party. Okay. Like a while back. But, um, basically you, uh, play the claw
7672460	7679420	again and you have to shoot stuff and super zapper recharge. So will this be coming out on
7679420	7686140	Atari's new system? Since we know the Atari box is coming. Wouldn't Tempest 4000 be a great, after
7686140	7692060	all, Tempest 2000 was like the fucking reason to own a Jaguar. Why not? The only reason to own a Jaguar.
7693260	7699180	Um, it looks like it is going to be coming out for PC and consoles later on in 2017.
7699180	7706620	This year, really? Yeah. That's awesome. I'm excited. I like this article. Okay. This article is great
7706620	7713580	because, okay, it says we don't have any assets of Tempest 4000. So instead here's a picture of
7713580	7719740	a llama and it's a picture of a llama sitting down in the grass. I love this article, Eurogamer.
7719740	7725260	Oh, Eurogamer. I love Eurogamer. It's a good site. But just, I just had to say, why is there,
7725260	7730140	oh, that's why there's a llama. Super llama recharge. Well, didn't they also, wasn't,
7730140	7734940	wasn't it like llama soft or something? Wasn't it llamas played into it somehow as well? Because
7734940	7741660	then they had space giraffe was kind of like that side game. Anyway. All right. A few more
7741660	7748380	stories for you guys before we open up the Skype line. Loki. So valve, um, announced during the
7748380	7756460	whole international, um, seven match in Seattle that there's a new Dota game coming. Oh my God.
7756460	7763100	Valves putting out a new game. Yes. It's Dota artifact. It's a card game.
7764780	7768860	I liked, can you say that again? Half life. Just kidding. It's a card game.
7773260	7778380	Yes. The, the, the art of artifact, the, the, the Dota card game that's going to be
7778380	7784060	coming out in 2018. All right. Well, there's people out, you know what?
7784060	7787580	And for the people that like trading, it's like they have the, like, we have a new
7787580	7796860	announcement for you and everyone's like, how fast the crowd will turn on you. Hey, look, no,
7796860	7799980	there's people that are really into trading card games are gonna be super thrilled about it. I
7799980	7803260	don't have a problem with them making a trading card game. It's just everybody else is wanting
7803260	7807820	to make a third of something. Yes. Maybe this was not the best place to announce it, even though
7807820	7813660	it is a Dota kind of game. Who knows? All right. It's like valve, just put three next to something,
7813660	7818700	please. One more story. And it has to do with a classic game. And this is something,
7818700	7825820	something brand new unearthed in a classic game. And that classic game is Super Mario Brothers 2,
7825820	7831340	the US version, which was Doki Doki Panic, of course, over on the Famicom. So it was unearthed
7831340	7837260	this week that in the original manual for Doki Doki Panic on the Famicom disk system,
7837260	7842460	there was a gray shy guy that was supposed to be there. If you, if you're not, I remember this.
7842460	7846700	Yeah, there was supposed to be a gray shy guy in the game. Oh, he's a shiny. Yes, he, that's
7846700	7851340	right. He's a shiny shy guy. Exactly. And what makes him special is that he would actually
7851340	7856060	follow you around. But the character actually never showed up in the game, even though it's
7856060	7864860	on the manual. Well, get this, somebody was able to use a code on Game Genie to get the character
7864860	7870060	back in the game. And that's right. There is a, it's an actual Game Genie code you can put
7870060	7874780	together and use on a cartridge. And you'll have to look this up on, on some of the different blogs,
7874780	7878700	like Destructoid or, or different codes of paint on the version of the game you have. Yeah. Cause
7878700	7882460	I'm not going to read the code, but yeah, you can put the code in the game and sure enough,
7882460	7887340	you will get a gray shy guy in the first level. And the thing is the shy guy will start to follow
7887340	7891100	you. Like he does the whole walking forward, but most shy guys in the game just ignore you,
7891100	7894940	jump over them and you're, that's it. But this shy guy, once you jump, if you ride him,
7894940	7901580	the universe, universes, why we always got to go to the gutter here on this show.
7901580	7907500	Oh no. I mean, you can stand on the enemy. I'm not trying to be in the gutter. You know what
7907500	7911660	you mean? If I was trying to do that, I would say like, Oh, what happens if you fuck him? You know,
7913420	7919180	well, somebody on Reddit's working on that, but um, no, I, I, I don't know because in this video,
7919180	7923420	they don't try that. So you'll have to go get a copy of the game and probably just walks back
7923420	7927340	and forth because he probably does. He probably just stands in place or continues off my fucking
7927340	7936780	head. You hurt. You're so big. I can't, my, my skeletal structure. Can I handle this?
7937340	7940380	Tiger quad chat says, no wonder they call them shy guys.
7944380	7947980	And on that note, we're going to open up the Skype line, orange lounge radio,
7947980	7952780	all one word on Skype. Uh, if you'd like to give us a call and talk about shy guys or anything
7952860	7957180	that is on your mind tonight, uh, maybe that we did cover in the news or maybe that we didn't
7957180	7961740	get to. So I will, uh, I will open up that Skype line now and how about that calls are already
7961740	7966700	coming in. So let's get to it higher on orange launch radio. Who's this? Hey, what's going on?
7966700	7971500	It's Rama. Hey Rama. Good to have you here. What's up? Not much. I'm just, I just finished
7971500	7976700	my eight hour trek back from Otacon in DC. So yeah, I've been seeing your Facebook updates
7976700	7982540	from Otacon. How was it? It was amazing. Nice. I'm glad you had a good time. Thank you.
7983260	7986220	What kind of like video game stuff do they have there? They have a gaming room or
7987820	7991820	I'm going to say this really quickly. Dan, I'm going to tell you why I called it.
7991820	7997660	The game room was huge, old school gaming. Plus there was many land tournament set up.
7998540	8003260	It was a few DDR arcade machines. It was a couple of dance machines and a whole
8003260	8007660	bunch of ju beat machines. And I will say this, it didn't stink.
8008540	8014540	Oh, people were, were applying their deodorant and, uh, taking showers daily. That's great.
8015740	8021500	Let's just hope that they did. When I walked to the game room, there was no smell. It was
8021500	8028700	a well ventilated space then maybe. All right. So why did you call? Because I was listening to
8028700	8033580	y'all on the way home and you were talking about the Nintendo world championships. And I remember
8033580	8038220	those, which in turn, for some reason, it reminded me of, while I was leaving
8038220	8042940	the dealer's room earlier, they had a little setup, one to boost. Um, they had a very
8042940	8050300	interesting VR game. It was, I, I looked at it like, how does sex your waifu? Cause that's
8050300	8055260	pretty much what it was. You had this little, it's important information.
8057020	8063020	Had this little blow up doll looking thing. You had the VR glasses on and there were people
8063100	8066220	watching this guy, I guess pretty much screwed his school girl.
8066220	8070300	Were there sensors on the doll? Did you have to dry hump the doll? Because that's awesome.
8070300	8072300	I don't know about telling you this, there was no sensors.
8074540	8079500	But, um, then I got that out the way. I don't know why that reminded me of it. I don't,
8079500	8084620	maybe because gaming tour, I don't know. Yes. Why did how to screw your waifu make you think,
8084620	8091260	God, I need to call OLR. Do you understand how much booze has been in my system since Thursday?
8091980	8098620	Fair enough. But, um, I remember the Nintendo world championships and I wanted to go,
8098620	8104380	but I couldn't. I remember the blockbuster, uh, gaming competitions. And one of my friends went,
8104380	8108060	cause he scored the highest in the areas. I went with him down the South street seaport
8108060	8114860	where he did NBA jam. But the thing is they threw him on the Genesis version. So it was a little
8114860	8121180	bit harder for him to play, but he used two hands whereas he was using his fingers to control the
8121180	8125980	game instead of his thumbs. That would suck though. That if you're used to one version
8125980	8129900	of the game and they throw you another, like they weren't the same back then. That's not,
8129900	8135740	it's not the same. I know the timing and the frames and all that stuff was different. So that's,
8136300	8140220	that's kind of crappy, but you know, but still kind of awesome that you got to do that. Yeah.
8140220	8143820	I have a lot of friends that did the world championships. I didn't really get to do any
8143820	8147500	of that. I don't know. I don't, I don't think they really had them. I mean, they might've done the
8147500	8152060	blockbuster thing here in Sacramento, but, but we never really went to blockbuster ever. We had like
8152060	8157020	indie stores that we usually always went to. And then the world championships, I highly doubt
8157020	8161020	wherever here. And it was just the kind of thing where it's like my, my parents really weren't
8161020	8168380	interested in taking me to San Francisco or anything like that. So. Well, I got lucky because
8168380	8173900	I don't know if you remember, there was one tournament that they had that I had an amazing
8173900	8180140	time at. Do you remember the superstar Fox weekend? I do remember that I do. Cause those
8180140	8186620	cartridges are super rare. If you can find them. I know. And if you went, I believe if you ended
8186620	8192140	up with the highest score that day, you got a t-shirt. I went to two locations and got two
8192140	8198780	shirts. Good job. That's awesome. But unfortunately someone outscored me in both places for the entire
8198780	8203340	weekend. So that's all right. They can make that modern now. It's like, I went to pre-order an
8203340	8208860	essay in the S classic, but all I got was the shirt. I wanted to play star Fox too,
8208860	8215740	but all I got was disappointment and resentment. I am disappointed. I'll just wait for the Rama
8215740	8220620	leak. Yeah, I know how like immediately immediate, immediate. All right. Well, Rama, I'm glad to hear
8220620	8225100	you had a good time at Otacon and I'm getting really excited about a dragon con I'm hearing
8225100	8228780	from what I believe I was reading. I heard that Tokyo attack is going to be back at dragon con
8228780	8232620	and that their, their space is increasing this year. So it's going to be more of it. So I'm
8232620	8237100	really excited. That sounds pretty awesome. So, you know where to find me at dragon con
8237100	8243580	when I'm not in a panel. Yep. In the game room. What about, what about what, what,
8243580	8250460	what a nice refreshing adult beverage, right? Correct. All right. Well, Rama, I'm going to
8250460	8254620	let you go so we can take more calls. Awesome, man. Thanks a lot. Great to hear from you. Bye.
8256220	8260780	All right. Orange lounge radio, all one word on Skype. If you want to get through, uh,
8260780	8264780	going to chat over at live.vognetware.com, message 100 Matt says Tokyo attack won't be back
8264780	8269660	at mad. Won't be at magfest sadly. Yeah, I heard about that. I was concerned about that. Um, you
8269660	8273500	know, I'm sure they have some type of other plan they're going to do and it's going to be different,
8273500	8278940	but if these other shows are happening over the country, all over the country, like, you know, the
8278940	8282860	California extreme and the Southern fried game room, I'm sure in the DC area, they're going to
8282860	8286780	figure out how to do it just fine. Uh, it'll just be different. It probably would just won't have
8286780	8291980	the focus on the, um, Japanese games, uh, that it has in the past, but it'll probably have plenty
8291980	8298700	of old school games and pinball and all that other stuff. So that'll be cool. Um, hit stun and chat
8298700	8302860	suggests a snow Phoenix. I've not heard of snow Phoenix. That must be a new company. Somebody
8302860	8307020	starts sending snow Phoenix to these big cons. They have a lot of Tokyo tax games. I was not aware.
8307020	8312540	So I guess these, I guess these con arcade companies are, uh, uh, grow in business,
8312540	8318460	but it does, it seems like there's more cons now than there were years ago when we first started
8318460	8323980	the show. I just mean like local stuff. Like it seems like there's some little con in Sacramento,
8323980	8329980	like every weekend. So that's kind of neat. So, all right. Uh, orange lounge radio, all one word
8329980	8334060	on Skype. Again, if you want to give us a call, let me check in quickly while we do this last,
8334060	8337820	uh, wait for calls here and see, uh, with Loki, if there's any last minute stories on, if you have
8337820	8343900	anything tonight, um, no, just like silly Twitch stuff. There's someone dude, um, that goes by the
8343900	8352300	name, a twerking Yoshi that's playing bloodborne, um, using a game or dance pad. Why not? Cause you
8352300	8356700	know, that's the thing. Why not? Sure. Why not? How do we, how did he hook up the dance pad to a
8356700	8363500	PlayStation three or four? Um, they have, I don't know, there's ways to do that kind of stuff, but
8363500	8370620	like they had, it shows like how they have the buttons maps. So they've got, um, I guess attack
8371740	8376460	can you only move to one direction? That's weird. They've got like a Dodge on the X button.
8376460	8384540	There's L one on the triangle are three lock on, on the square and L two on start and select
8384540	8389180	his potion. Well, you can remap all the buttons within the PlayStation four operating. And
8389180	8395900	apparently, um, right is attack. So he can only move left up and down. So interesting.
8395900	8399180	I don't know. I guess that's the thing. Uh, as Joe and Hunter, Matt and Chad says,
8399180	8405340	I remember having a party where we played mortal combat with DDR pads. Good times. Was it, was there
8405340	8409740	any, um, Jamie, I'm trying to think way back to the parties that used to happen at your house with
8409740	8413660	like your dream cast dance pads. Were there any other games that were played with dance pads
8413660	8419100	besides DDR? I thought there was something. Um, and not the jungle book doesn't count.
8419100	8425420	Soul caliber. Soul caliber. Yes. Because we found that the Konami logo is an analog pad.
8427260	8431900	And so we would play, um, we would try to play soul caliber with the dance pad. Yeah.
8431900	8439740	On a dance pad on the dance pad, on the dream cast dance pad. Oh, so weird. Yeah. Super weird.
8439740	8445740	Yeah. But anyway, um, I think that's what else we've ever used the dream cast dance pads for,
8445740	8453260	but rod caliber was your rod caliber was great because it is literally just moving the fishing
8453260	8460700	rod and praying cause it would move them too. Yeah. So it's so crazy. Good times. All right.
8460700	8467020	We got another call coming in, so let's get to it. Hi. Oh, it's all right. So it,
8467020	8470540	as soon as I picked up the call, it went, Nope, just kidding. Disconnect. Let me see if that
8470540	8475740	person calls back. Uh, meanwhile, I'll read some comments and chat, uh, hit stun and chat says,
8475740	8480540	I played an arcade tech and five on a dance pad. Once it had PS two controller reports,
8480540	8484460	uh, dark Tetsuya says, I bet you could do soul caliber. Yeah. It works with the keyboard too.
8485260	8491020	Uh, and let's see as 200. Matt says, one of my friends managed to pull off a fatality on a dance
8491020	8496300	pad. I forgot who's he pulled off. We've got to be somebody easy like a katana. I still remember to
8496300	8499820	this day, block, block, block, block, block, block, block, high kick. It's just buttons.
8499820	8503420	The ones that are buttons only and you don't even have to move your character are probably much
8503420	8508620	easier to do, but yeah, that's, um, Katana's fatality. I can, I can still worry. Cause you
8508620	8512060	just slammed the block button a bunch of times and they had high kick super easy to do. At least
8512060	8516700	that's where we'll come at two important. Oh, as she went under, Matt says, uh, it was mortal
8516700	8523020	combat one. That is what I do remember. Sonia's fatality was pretty easy in that game. Forward,
8523020	8527980	forward, back, back block. I don't know how, how do I remember that? I don't know. Sub zero
8527980	8534540	toward, down toward high punch or was a low punch one of the two. So, all right. Well, sadly, I
8534540	8538380	don't think the, uh, calls are coming back in. So I'm going to go ahead and shut down the Skype line
8538380	8542780	for tonight. Uh, and I think we're going to go ahead and start to wrap up tonight's show, but
8542780	8547580	I do want to thank you guys again for being with our show tonight. Thank you for being back after
8547580	8551180	we've been gone for a little bit. I really appreciate you guys being back here. If you

8582860	8587180	So I think it's time to go around and get everybody's final thought. Uh, Loki, I'll start
8587180	8593420	with you. Your final thought tonight. Uh, my final thought is I, I am going to try to work on my
8593420	8599020	games again. I ought to figure out what I want to work on. Basically. That's it. Whether I keep on
8599020	8603660	working on what I started with the game jam or if I go back to one of my other projects.
8604540	8609660	All right. Dark Sakura, your final thought tonight. I was reading about the silent Hill song.
8610380	8613900	What's the silent Hill song from the revenge ending for silent Hill three. Oh,
8613900	8623580	silent Hill. I remember that. Uh, and then my final thought tonight would just be, um,
8623580	8628700	thank you for being here and, uh, it's, it's nice to be back. So thank you guys very much
8628700	8632940	for everything. Uh, that's going to do it for another episode of orange lounge radio.
