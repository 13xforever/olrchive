Hello, my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week at the show where

00:35.520 --> 00:41.840
every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio. Live tonight, episode number 697 for this,

00:41.840 --> 00:48.720
August the 20th of 2017. My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E,

00:48.720 --> 00:52.160
joining me by my side. Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

00:52.960 --> 00:57.040
I want a beer. You want a beer? Right now. I don't have beer, I have wine. Actually,

00:57.040 --> 01:03.120
because that song, I wish you were a beer, was stuck in my head. What song is that? It came out

01:03.120 --> 01:07.040
in the 90s. It's called I Wish You Were a Beer. There were a lot of great songs that came out in

01:07.040 --> 01:11.440
the 90s though. So wait, I wish you were a beer? Who sang it? I wish, hold on, I'm gonna find out,

01:11.440 --> 01:16.000
I forgot who did it. Somebody in our chat room will know, I promise you, over at live.vognetwork.com

01:16.000 --> 01:19.520
because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

01:19.520 --> 01:24.640
Cycle Sluts From Hell. Of course, the band that's up your alley.

01:26.400 --> 01:28.240
Were you calling? 1991.

01:28.240 --> 01:30.080
Wait, was that the name of the band or was that you calling our chat room?

01:30.080 --> 01:32.400
That was the name of the band. Okay, all right.

01:32.400 --> 01:37.200
Cycle Sluts From Hell, I Wish You Were a Beer. All right, fantastic. Well, if you want a beer,

01:37.200 --> 01:42.000
come join our chat room and wish for one because I don't have any. Live.vognetwork.com,

01:42.000 --> 01:44.800
6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, every week at the Voice Geeks Network,

01:44.800 --> 01:48.640
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. It's gonna be a fortune cookie one day.

01:48.640 --> 01:53.280
It should be. It's a good message. I like that. Say hello as well to, I don't know if he has a

01:53.280 --> 01:55.360
beer, but it's Techmaster Loki. No, I know.

01:55.360 --> 01:58.080
Yeah, you have like a 7-Up or a Sprite over there, right? Or what is that?

01:58.080 --> 01:59.440
It's a Pepsi. It's a Pepsi.

01:59.440 --> 02:01.280
It was a Pepsi. It was a Pepsi.

02:01.280 --> 02:03.600
It's since been devoured. Now it is nothing.

02:05.040 --> 02:06.960
Gone forever. How are you doing?

02:07.520 --> 02:13.360
I'm full, except, you know, I went to Roundtable again, despite them fighting me.

02:13.360 --> 02:15.280
Pizza place on the West Coast. Not everybody has them.

02:15.280 --> 02:19.920
Sorry. Yeah. Pizza place. So I got more breadsticks because we had, they have like a,

02:20.480 --> 02:25.680
they were doing a, like a rewards program type thing that they're phasing out Friday.

02:25.680 --> 02:29.120
And I had like enough points for like free breadsticks and stuff. I was like,

02:29.120 --> 02:34.640
I got to use it up or use it or lose it. So yep. You know, as much, even though I got breadsticks

02:34.640 --> 02:39.440
last week and I was going to go to El Pollo Loco this week, I'm like, okay, I get breadsticks

02:39.440 --> 02:43.520
again. Use those points. And then next week I'll go play a local.

02:43.520 --> 02:48.080
Another, another West Coast chain. And they just, I shouldn't give away where I live totally,

02:48.080 --> 02:53.520
but I guess, well, there's a brand new one nearby, nearby. We'll say that near-ish. And,

02:53.520 --> 02:59.760
uh, so, um, Loki it's, it's, I think not out of the way for you really on your drive over here.

02:59.760 --> 03:04.560
Um, so you are thinking about going there on the regular, right? Cause that's pretty good.

03:04.560 --> 03:07.200
I don't know. I'll put it as fast as food goes. It's pretty good.

03:07.200 --> 03:12.160
The other one that I haven't been going to really is, um, Jim boys tacos,

03:12.160 --> 03:16.640
which I actually went there the other day and I'm like, man, I forgot how good this is.

03:16.640 --> 03:19.600
And these are all like local places and our people back East are like, what the

03:19.600 --> 03:25.360
hell is he talking about? It's a taco stand. It's it's it's American style tacos.

03:25.360 --> 03:28.320
It's it's good. They, they kept top of them like Parmesan cheese.

03:28.320 --> 03:31.360
Yeah. They put Parmesan cheese on them, which is like, you wouldn't think,

03:31.360 --> 03:34.000
you wouldn't think it's good, but it's good. But it's, it's really good.

03:34.000 --> 03:38.640
And so I found that there's one on the way as well, because all the other ones I knew about

03:38.640 --> 03:42.320
were like in the opposite direction. So. All right. Stop talking about food. You're

03:42.320 --> 03:46.640
making us all hungry. We're here to talk about video games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle

03:46.640 --> 03:50.480
and all that good stuff. Let's get into some video game chat actually here at the top of the show.

03:50.480 --> 03:54.400
Uh, let's talk a little bit about games com because games com is about to kick off. It's

03:54.400 --> 03:57.840
about to get underway. I don't, what, when do they do their show? Is it, is it like a Tuesday,

03:57.840 --> 04:04.000
Wednesday, Thursday thing? Like E3? Uh, yeah, I don't remember. Okay. I know. I thought it was,

04:04.400 --> 04:10.160
you know, I kind of got blindsided. I thought it was the weekend. And then I heard that Microsoft

04:10.160 --> 04:15.040
was doing their like pre games com announcement thing today. And I was like, on a Sunday,

04:15.040 --> 04:19.600
I was like, Nintendo's got a presentation. It sounds like a repeat of the tree house stuff,

04:19.600 --> 04:24.480
but they're doing something, um, next couple of days, I think Monday or Tuesday. So there's,

04:24.480 --> 04:28.240
so games comes in the middle of the week, like E3, I was like Monday through Thursday or something

04:28.240 --> 04:32.480
like that. I don't know why I didn't think of that. Bobby Black Wolf and chat says it's all

04:32.480 --> 04:37.760
week. The beginning is industry only and later is open to the public. Okay. That makes more sense.

04:37.760 --> 04:44.000
They should do with like E3, E3 should just copy that model. It's been there getting there.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.440
They're getting there. No, I'm serious. Like they tried it this year where they just open it up and

04:47.440 --> 04:54.160
it was a big old mess. They should, I mean, it's worked for games com for how long now that this

04:54.160 --> 05:00.480
format, why don't they just copy it? Do what Apple and like the other companies do when they see

05:00.480 --> 05:05.120
something that works, they copy it and they make it better. So like you don't make it worse. That's

05:05.120 --> 05:11.840
not what you want to do. So. They put their own spin on it. Exactly. Um, guys, you don't,

05:11.840 --> 05:17.680
our chat over at live.vog network.com says too many cons, man. Not to, not to be on a tangent,

05:17.680 --> 05:22.800
but I'm gonna, cause this is OLR, but if you guys know, is it just me or does it seem like within

05:22.800 --> 05:28.400
the past Oh five years or so, there are more conventions in general. And I don't just mean

05:28.400 --> 05:33.120
like gaming conventions on a national scale. I mean like local stuff. Maybe we're just paying

05:33.120 --> 05:39.280
attention to it more. Are we? It just seems like everyone, maybe it's that Facebook, Twitter,

05:39.280 --> 05:44.160
social media age we live in where I'm aware of more of it now. Was it, my coworker was asking

05:44.160 --> 05:49.520
me if I was going to the, the Sacramento con SAC anime because they got, I guess they have the

05:49.520 --> 05:54.480
voice actors from Overwatch there. Oh, I didn't even know that. I do know like all the power

05:54.480 --> 05:59.600
Rangers are going to be there. So Shane was going to go, but he had a, he had a thing. He's not

05:59.600 --> 06:05.520
going now. So, um, at least I don't think he is. So, um, but yeah, that I know is, uh, something

06:05.520 --> 06:09.360
that was, I haven't been there since what the last time we've broadcast there, like at seven

06:09.360 --> 06:12.960
or eight in the morning or something like that. That wasn't even the full SAC anime. I don't think

06:12.960 --> 06:18.000
that was like a day con or, uh, or even before that, when they used to do it like in sunrise

06:18.000 --> 06:22.480
mall, like they would actually have, like, do you remember that the, the McDonald's that wasn't

06:22.480 --> 06:26.400
there anymore, they would literally put curtain in front of the windows and they would project

06:26.400 --> 06:30.160
stuff. And that was one of the screening rooms. It was an old ass McDonald's that wasn't open

06:30.160 --> 06:35.040
anymore. Yeah. So I don't, it just seems like there's, there's so much more stuff here locally

06:35.040 --> 06:40.240
anyway, but, uh, anyhow. Um, okay. So what I really want to talk about games con, uh,

06:40.240 --> 06:44.720
was I wanted to talk about the Microsoft event that they did earlier today. So they kind of

06:44.720 --> 06:50.400
announced a few things sorta. I mean, like, you know, they weren't, they didn't drop anything

06:50.400 --> 06:54.080
like big, there was no like big, big bombshells, but there was a few things that they put out

06:54.080 --> 06:58.400
there. Namely, of course they are trying to push the Xbox one X. And so some of the big things they

06:58.400 --> 07:03.440
talked about. More games getting 4k updates. That seemed to be a really big message that the old

07:03.440 --> 07:08.400
library is getting updated. And I definitely sense this, uh, kind of emphasis, if you will,

07:08.400 --> 07:14.720
on like old is new again, between these 4k updates and really pushing backwards back compatibility

07:14.720 --> 07:19.760
and that whole thing. I thought you said it was out of style. Well, now it's retro. Exactly.

07:19.760 --> 07:24.480
What's old. Like they were showing guys is fashionable again. They were showing something.

07:24.480 --> 07:28.640
I think it may have been recourse, something like that. And maybe talking about 4k updates for that.

07:28.640 --> 07:34.560
Your record was one of them. It just didn't look that great. I mean, like, I mean, don't get me

07:34.560 --> 07:38.480
wrong recourse, probably a great game, but like the footage that they were showing, I'm like,

07:38.480 --> 07:43.600
I can't see how putting this in 4k is going to make this look any better. Well, it pales next

07:43.600 --> 07:48.720
to fours, but for right. Exactly. It was designed to be a 4k game. Recore was not, they're going

07:48.720 --> 07:53.200
back and updating recourse, but I mean, it's not just that it's, um, uh, quantum break was

07:53.200 --> 07:56.400
obviously the one I picked up that, you know, that's a huge deal. They said they were going

07:56.400 --> 08:00.080
back and doing family friendly titles as well, that they really wanted to emphasize that part

08:00.080 --> 08:03.520
of their library. Yeah. I did notice one of the things that they were talking about in,

08:03.520 --> 08:07.520
and this was actually a rerelease. Like I think they're actually going to sell them again is

08:07.520 --> 08:14.320
on the Xbox one X or Xbox one, they're going to be selling, um, the Disney, uh, adventure game,

08:14.320 --> 08:19.280
which remember connect adventures, remember that shit. Um, so Disney adventures was kind of a

08:19.280 --> 08:24.400
sequel spinoff of that, where you use the connected to Disney theme games, but come

08:24.400 --> 08:29.040
along the same lines. And then they also had a Pixar one that was kind of similar.

08:29.040 --> 08:34.400
And then they had, um, the zoo tycoon game that was also a connect game. I don't know if that

08:34.400 --> 08:38.080
one also had controller support originally, but now they're going back and they're adding

08:38.160 --> 08:42.560
controller support to these and they're also supporting 4k.

08:42.560 --> 08:47.760
Although honestly, I think these games came out like during the three 60 era. I mean,

08:47.760 --> 08:55.360
uh, I can't imagine that it's gonna be really worth it. Like I'm not like, Oh shit. I really

08:55.360 --> 09:01.360
passed on Disney adventures before, but now that it's 4k fuck. Yeah. Let me get in on that.

09:01.360 --> 09:06.480
Well, maybe they're just trying to really cater to people who did like completely

09:06.480 --> 09:09.520
miss these games the first time around. I mean, I can understand why they're trying

09:09.520 --> 09:14.000
to take a family friendly approach. It's something that I think Sony's a little weaker on.

09:15.040 --> 09:19.760
But Nintendo is very strong in that department. So I don't, I mean,

09:19.760 --> 09:23.600
I don't know where Microsoft's trying to land in that whole picture, but you know,

09:24.320 --> 09:28.240
it'll be interesting. I don't know. What do you kind of think? I open this up to everybody

09:28.240 --> 09:33.200
really here in studio. What do you guys think about like Microsoft and their position right

09:33.280 --> 09:37.920
now? Just in general, like what are your feelings when it comes to Xbox?

09:38.560 --> 09:45.040
They have a big problem where they're competing with themselves. And like the big problem is that

09:45.040 --> 09:50.320
they have windows 10 and they put out their games on windows 10. I have a windows 10 PC

09:50.320 --> 09:54.080
and all these things that they keep pushing out and like saying, Oh yeah, here's why you need to

09:54.080 --> 10:00.720
get an Xbox one X. It doesn't sell it for me. Cause it's like, I see this game like, Oh yeah,

10:00.720 --> 10:06.240
player on player unknowns battlegrounds is going to be coming to Xbox one. I'm like,

10:06.880 --> 10:12.400
but I have a PC it's already on PC. I don't need to buy an Xbox for that. Or,

10:12.400 --> 10:18.400
you know, Hey, you're going to play crackdown three, which will also be on PC and next year,

10:18.960 --> 10:22.880
next year. But that's fine, you know, next year, but all these games that they're showing,

10:22.880 --> 10:27.600
I can also get on my PC. And so there's not really anything driving me to, I need to buy it.

10:27.600 --> 10:34.480
And even with the Xbox one X, I don't have a 4k TV. I don't, there's nothing really pushing me.

10:34.480 --> 10:39.280
There's nothing saying that I need to get this for this reason. Like 4k is going to be awesome,

10:39.280 --> 10:44.240
but I'm just going to wait because aside from gaming content in which there really isn't a

10:44.240 --> 10:50.160
whole ton of it right now, there's nothing. There's not a lot that can be displayed in 4k

10:50.160 --> 10:54.160
right now. The content hasn't caught up to that. A couple of things with that. Um, first off,

10:54.160 --> 10:57.840
we should kind of quickly address that crackdown delay because that was big news that came up this

10:57.840 --> 11:01.280
week that I wanted to address the top of the show. But if you hadn't heard crackdown three

11:01.280 --> 11:05.440
did get officially delayed until next year, they're not going to make the holiday. But I

11:05.440 --> 11:11.120
think when it comes to game delays at this point, I think there's, I kind of get like a shift in the

11:11.120 --> 11:16.320
gaming public at large on Twitter is I think people have come to accept that a game delay

11:16.320 --> 11:20.240
isn't always necessarily bad news. And I think a lot of people, at least I know I am with this

11:20.240 --> 11:23.920
crackdown news. I'm like, okay, well, if it needs it, delay it because there's just been,

11:24.480 --> 11:29.120
you know, and we'll get into this later in the show, but there's obviously one big game. You

11:29.120 --> 11:32.080
all know what I'm talking about that we got some news on this week. We'll get into later.

11:32.080 --> 11:36.240
They really should have been delayed again. That wasn't, you know, and now it's paying the price

11:36.240 --> 11:40.320
for not being, it's paying way too big of a price for not being delayed again. So there's, there's

11:40.320 --> 11:45.120
a part of me that's like, if you should, if you need to delay games, just, just do it, just do it.

11:45.120 --> 11:50.400
But it does put Microsoft in that awkward position of, well, shit, there went one of our

11:50.400 --> 11:55.920
largest holiday things that we're pushing. So now it's like the message that I'm seeing at a games

11:55.920 --> 12:01.840
comm is, well, we have Forza and then look at this vast library of shit you never played before

12:01.840 --> 12:05.760
that we're going to make all new again. So we got this whole big library you haven't explored,

12:05.760 --> 12:08.960
so come on over. But that was one thing I wanted to say with that. The second thing I want to say

12:08.960 --> 12:15.680
with that is, if you go over to Windows 10 for your gaming, is that really a loss for Microsoft?

12:15.680 --> 12:22.800
I'm not so sure it is. It's not, but it's gonna hurt Xbox maybe, but Microsoft doesn't exactly

12:22.800 --> 12:29.040
lose. No, they don't lose from that. But you know, it's just, I don't know, it's not gonna give me

12:29.040 --> 12:33.680
the buy their console, I guess. But then they don't really need for me to buy a console because

12:33.680 --> 12:38.800
I have Windows, I guess. But I don't know. I didn't buy Windows, it just came on my machine.

12:39.440 --> 12:43.600
Dungeon Buster in chat says Microsoft will keep going. They won't give up and will try a lot of

12:43.600 --> 12:48.960
things to generate interest and draw crowds like the decision to publish PUBG for the Xbox One.

12:49.600 --> 12:54.720
Kajudo in chat says Crackdown is going to be the new Duke Nukem. The game won't come out till it's

12:54.720 --> 13:00.240
a 20 year internet joke. No, it hasn't been in development that long. Not that long. I mean,

13:00.240 --> 13:05.360
it was announced some time ago, but I think at least, I think what's happening here is that

13:05.360 --> 13:12.000
clearly a decision was made to shift Crackdown into a 4K game. Like, Crackdown was not going to

13:12.000 --> 13:18.720
be what it is now, and that is a big boost for the Xbox One X. I think Crackdown's kind of like

13:18.720 --> 13:23.680
visibility got shifted. It's kind of, okay, let's talk about games that should have been delayed for

13:23.680 --> 13:31.120
a minute. It's kind of what happened with No Man's Sky and PlayStation 4, right? That was rushed

13:31.120 --> 13:35.200
out. Right. And that now I think we're all at a point where it's like, wow, No Man's Sky probably

13:35.200 --> 13:39.600
would have benefited if it delayed. Yeah. If it released with what it has now, that would have,

13:39.600 --> 13:44.000
it would have been a very successful game. So now with Crackdown, I think maybe Microsoft's

13:44.000 --> 13:47.280
taking that approach that, you know what, maybe we should just go ahead and delay it so we don't

13:47.280 --> 13:50.080
have a No Man's Sky thing on our hands. But I think it's one of those cases where it's like

13:50.080 --> 13:54.800
Crackdown was supposed to be this big bolster for the Xbox One X, and so they've kind of put

13:54.800 --> 13:59.360
more into it than was probably there before, including, you know, now the big name talent

13:59.360 --> 14:03.040
that we have attached to this game and everything, you know, that probably all wasn't there when the

14:03.040 --> 14:07.680
game was first in development. So I think what's happening with Crackdown is a little bit different,

14:07.680 --> 14:12.960
but again, if it had to be delayed for that reason, fine. You know, again, there's other

14:12.960 --> 14:16.960
games where it's very clear the development happened in the last year, or maybe they should

14:16.960 --> 14:23.040
have delayed it another year. Final Fantasy XV, actually, now that, you know, gosh, not even

14:23.680 --> 14:27.920
one that's in the news this week, but I'm thinking of all these games now. No Man's Sky should have

14:27.920 --> 14:31.680
been delayed. Final Fantasy XV. Final Fantasy XV. I should really go back, or Just Cause 3,

14:31.680 --> 14:36.080
another one that came out and it was just broken, still kind of broken now. I mean,

14:36.080 --> 14:42.320
there's a lot of games that get put out that are just buggy or just not ready to go.

14:42.320 --> 14:46.640
Yeah. I mean, like, I don't, are we past the moratorium on spoilers of Final Fantasy XV yet?

14:47.280 --> 14:52.480
I won't. I won't. I haven't played it. I won't. Let me just say, but I will start to talk a little

14:52.480 --> 14:57.680
more. I'm not gonna spoil anything, but I just will say the end section of the game, for those

14:57.680 --> 15:03.520
that have been there, past the infamous chapter 13, this would be chapter 14 or 15. I can't

15:03.520 --> 15:11.200
remember my mind, but it was really odd to me that that whole section of the game was not expanded on

15:11.200 --> 15:15.760
in a major way. And I feel like if Final Fantasy XV had been delayed, it would have been.

15:16.400 --> 15:21.200
So it's just, again, I don't, it's just going to be with any of the expansions that are coming out?

15:21.200 --> 15:28.160
No, now the expansions are all like these weird side game things. Like Prompto is like a completely

15:28.160 --> 15:33.680
different type of game, practically. It's like another thing that exists in the XV universe.

15:33.680 --> 15:39.200
They have the multiplayer thing coming to XV, but I totally missed the boat on the beta test

15:39.200 --> 15:42.960
because that all happened when I was... It's just like, it's so disappointing that,

15:43.120 --> 15:47.920
remember when they were showing off the VR, kind of teasing the VR support for XV,

15:49.120 --> 15:53.040
and then now it's a fishing game? It's like, come on.

15:54.320 --> 15:59.200
SHO 100 Matt says, was Final Fantasy XIV original release a product of rushing to get it out,

15:59.200 --> 16:05.440
or just bad that required a total remodel from scratch? Yeah, the original Final Fantasy XIV

16:05.440 --> 16:10.560
was just, it was rushed bad. It was really, and they paid the price for it. But when they went

16:10.560 --> 16:14.560
back and did it, they put together a really great game in a really short amount of time,

16:14.560 --> 16:19.440
all things considered. So I mean, Final Fantasy XIV is a very interesting, like, I don't think

16:19.440 --> 16:25.280
there'll ever be another video game like it. It's very interesting. But anyway, we got a little off

16:25.280 --> 16:29.840
track with the Gamescom stuff. I didn't really check in with you, Jamie. I know your household

16:29.840 --> 16:35.040
doesn't have Xbox One right now. I mean, where's your guys' head out with Microsoft? Is it just

16:35.040 --> 16:40.320
one of those, we don't care because everything we need is Sony or Nintendo right now? Or where's

16:40.320 --> 16:44.960
your, yeah, that, you know, Microsoft is all bark, bark, bark, bark, bark, bark, bark. I'm

16:44.960 --> 16:51.680
like, okay, good. So you feel like with Microsoft, you don't get a lot of, like, I guess there's not

16:51.680 --> 16:55.280
a lot of meaning behind the words. That's it. I'm just trying to interpret what you're saying.

16:55.280 --> 16:59.360
Nothing really that I care about yet. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Well, especially nowadays when you're

16:59.360 --> 17:03.280
purchasing, when you have multiple game systems, it's all about what console exclusives they have

17:03.280 --> 17:08.960
and what console exclusives do they have? Because there's not a lot coming out anymore. It's like

17:08.960 --> 17:15.600
Forza seven. I'm not into SIM driving games. So it's not horizon, you know, horizon three.

17:15.600 --> 17:22.720
That was one of those four K updates. That's cool. Yeah. Um, but you know, I've got a PC

17:22.720 --> 17:27.760
that can run Forza horizon three now. Really nice. And so I, yeah, I just don't need it.

17:28.800 --> 17:32.720
I think I'm in a really similar place when it goes, and I mentioned this after E3,

17:32.720 --> 17:38.880
the way I felt about Microsoft after E3 was, um, wow, I'm really sold on 4k gaming for my PC.

17:39.680 --> 17:44.160
Well, on top of that though, on top of that, here's the other reason why I'm even with their

17:44.160 --> 17:51.200
Microsoft games. I'm not entirely gung ho to jump into that. Cause if I want to play Forza horizon

17:51.200 --> 17:59.120
three multiplayer, I got to pay 60 extra dollars a year. Oh, so Xbox live is live. And that's

17:59.120 --> 18:04.400
another subscription that like, I don't get enough use out of. Yeah. But isn't, I mean,

18:04.400 --> 18:08.480
to be fair, isn't that kind of, Oh, well, okay. I was gonna say, isn't that an industry standard

18:08.480 --> 18:15.120
like Sony and soon Nintendo on consoles, but I own a PC. So fuck that noise. Oh,

18:16.400 --> 18:20.320
do you ever, are you, maybe I shouldn't even say this out loud. Everybody's going to say, shut up,

18:20.320 --> 18:24.720
shut up, Rob, shut up. Are you ever worried that Microsoft may take some of those games and

18:24.720 --> 18:29.040
paywall gate them on Xbox gold because windows 10, they would have the technology to do that

18:29.040 --> 18:33.680
if they wanted to. What do you mean paywall gate them? Meaning you would have to have

18:33.680 --> 18:39.520
Xbox gold to play those games online, even on PC. I think you do on Xbox. Do you really buy

18:39.520 --> 18:43.760
the store, buy it through the storefront? I think you have to have gold to play multiplayer.

18:44.480 --> 18:47.440
I'm pretty sure you're right. You're probably doing, I don't know. I need somebody in the

18:47.440 --> 18:52.960
chat to confirm that. Cause I don't know. I can't think. Oh no. Xbox live on PCs for you. Okay.

18:52.960 --> 18:58.880
Well, sweet. Who said that? Wow. Okay. Well then I guess that solves that problem.

18:58.960 --> 19:07.760
Interesting. Interesting. Hmm. All right. Well maybe can you do the cross play without Xbox

19:07.760 --> 19:14.720
goal? I wonder, I wonder if, yeah, I wonder if Microsoft, maybe, maybe that's what Microsoft

19:14.720 --> 19:21.760
needs to do. Like if they really want to turn some heads and the Xbox live gold or keep it as a,

19:21.760 --> 19:25.120
yeah, I know bingo. Here's what you do. Here's the deal. Got it. I know. I know the answer.

19:25.200 --> 19:30.000
Are you ready? Everybody ready? Xbox gold. You no longer need it for multiplayer.

19:30.000 --> 19:37.520
Xbox gold instead is their new Netflix games thing. Done. Done. Right. That's that would

19:37.520 --> 19:43.200
turn so many heads if they did that. It would be nice. I mean, I, I don't understand why

19:44.240 --> 19:49.120
aside from numbers, cause obviously people playing on the X windows 10 store are probably

19:49.120 --> 19:55.040
a lot less than, you know, on Xbox live on console, but where do they get off thinking

19:55.040 --> 20:01.680
that they can charge, you know, for online play on consoles where PC you, you don't, I mean,

20:02.880 --> 20:08.800
I don't know. It's just kind of stupid. And it's, it's lucky for them that for the, you know,

20:08.800 --> 20:14.640
great game and like crackdowns probably gonna be a great game, but you know, anything else that's

20:14.640 --> 20:19.680
multiplayer out there, you know, I could get on PC, like call of duty or something like that.

20:19.680 --> 20:24.480
Might want to play, you know, steam money to play online. That's ridiculous.

20:25.760 --> 20:30.400
Yeah. I I'm that's, that would be my advice for Microsoft. And granted, I, I realized this could

20:30.400 --> 20:36.480
be a huge financial thing or whatever, but like just end Xbox gold and change it into,

20:36.480 --> 20:41.200
for people that already have it, give them the Netflix thing instead. Um, like, cause I have

20:41.200 --> 20:44.640
Xbox gold through February, but if they were to say, you know what, we're no longer, we're going

20:44.640 --> 20:47.520
to require it from multiplayer, but for those of you that already bought it, you're going to get

20:47.520 --> 20:52.400
the game pass for the time that you had Xbox gold or whatever, I would be perfectly satisfied.

20:52.400 --> 20:56.880
I would not be upset. It'd be great, you know, compared to, I mean, they're not going to do that,

20:56.880 --> 21:00.880
but I don't think they will either. But I just think, I think heads like, like Microsoft,

21:00.880 --> 21:05.360
if Microsoft wants to get fucking noticed right now in this contest with Sony and Nintendo and

21:05.360 --> 21:10.080
all this stuff that would do it like to, to shatter the industry expectation right now,

21:10.080 --> 21:13.600
which is, Oh, if you're on console, you're going to pay money to play online because now even

21:13.600 --> 21:16.800
Nintendo is going to be doing that. I just, I don't Microsoft were to shatter that it would

21:16.800 --> 21:21.440
turn heads. Like I just think it's so ridiculous to say, you know, Oh, well, you know, cost money

21:21.440 --> 21:26.240
to run service. Yeah, I get it. It costs money to run service, but why on PC, you know, and then

21:26.240 --> 21:30.160
we're talking like the most popular games here, why on PC, like player unknowns battleground or

21:30.160 --> 21:34.720
something like that. Why are they charging for online there? They have the run service too.

21:34.720 --> 21:39.360
Why is it so hard for the console manufacturers and console makers and console publishers out

21:39.360 --> 21:44.240
there to run online servers, which let's be honest that a lot of them kind of suck.

21:44.240 --> 21:48.960
And on top of that, they're charging you for a season pass for all this unnecessary DLC.

21:48.960 --> 21:51.840
And then on top of that, they're, you know, double dipping with, you know,

21:51.840 --> 21:56.880
microtransactions and games and loot boxes and all that nonsense. Why do they think that they

21:56.880 --> 21:59.840
can get away with that? Well, I know why they think they can get away with that because you've

21:59.840 --> 22:05.280
been paying it all this time. And this is kind of something you're used to now. Well, stop being

22:05.280 --> 22:12.240
used to that. Start complaining about don't play games on consoles. Uh, and Bobby brings up a

22:12.240 --> 22:16.560
point in chat here that says, I assume this is some administrators who run Xbox live servers

22:16.560 --> 22:21.040
demand that they be paid for their time as well. So they do need money to run their servers. Sure.

22:21.040 --> 22:25.520
Running servers isn't free, but couldn't that money come from another place? Like,

22:25.520 --> 22:29.760
like Loki is saying, these expansions that come on for games and so forth, the money that they

22:29.760 --> 22:33.600
sell when they make the system, you know, other parts of the ecosystem. Here's why you're saying

22:33.680 --> 22:37.680
like, I've been doing it up until now. I get it. I get it. Once again, you know,

22:37.680 --> 22:43.680
they need money for their service. Sony just recently started demanding money for a multiplayer.

22:43.680 --> 22:48.080
It wasn't a problem on the PlayStation three. Why is it a problem now? And if you're going to say,

22:48.080 --> 22:51.600
Oh, well, more people are playing. Well, you're selling more copies. You're bringing in more

22:51.600 --> 22:58.320
money. So what is the problem again? I would just point to on PC. It's not about not a problem.

22:58.320 --> 23:02.720
It's not a problem PC. Yes, I get it. It's less people claim, but you know,

23:02.720 --> 23:06.560
it's all scalable servers all end up shutting down after a year anyway, because

23:07.120 --> 23:13.520
they don't want to pay the people to maintain them anymore. Yay. Case in point, because a lot of it,

23:13.520 --> 23:18.320
like a lot of this stuff is even like virtual servers now, and they can scale it so that it's

23:18.320 --> 23:23.280
more cost efficient than it probably was, you know, years ago. And like, I just don't understand.

23:23.280 --> 23:27.840
It's an excuse is what it is. It's an excuse to charge more money because people are like,

23:27.920 --> 23:30.880
well, I guess that makes sense because the publisher is telling me that they need more

23:30.880 --> 23:34.800
money to run for, you know, to run those servers. And I guess that makes sense to myself. So I'm

23:34.800 --> 23:39.040
going to pay them money and that's it. And you're used to it now. And they're going to throw you a

23:39.040 --> 23:44.080
few free games of old shit that you might not play. Another reason why I bring this up and I'm

23:44.080 --> 23:49.360
like, you know, I, I really truly feel like I'm not talking crazy when I, I re I seriously suggest

23:49.360 --> 23:54.400
this as something that Microsoft could do is because I thought part of the reason Microsoft

23:54.400 --> 24:00.400
started offering free games and started doing that whole thing was there was rumors years ago

24:00.400 --> 24:05.840
when they first started doing that, that Microsoft was looking to change Xbox live and that possibly

24:05.840 --> 24:11.440
at that point they were going to sunset and no longer require online multiplayer. So I don't

24:11.440 --> 24:16.320
think it's an unheard of type of thing, but anyway, I'm just throwing it out there. You know,

24:16.320 --> 24:21.520
if, if they continue to charge, they continue to charge, but we'll see. All right. Anyway,

24:21.520 --> 24:24.720
we do want to move on, start to get into how was your game a week ago? Did I hit everything

24:24.720 --> 24:30.560
with gamescom? It was boring. They, they did announce that the Xbox one X is on pre-order.

24:30.560 --> 24:35.600
That was the big bombshell drop, you know, there, but, and they're gone. The project,

24:35.600 --> 24:41.040
the project, I didn't care. I was like, whatever. Um, the Minecraft console, it kind of cool.

24:41.040 --> 24:45.760
They had like a, a Minecraft console for the Xbox one S that was kind of neat. All that made me

24:45.760 --> 24:49.600
think is like, man, if I ever build my son a PC, that's how I'm going to paint it. But that I'm

24:49.600 --> 24:55.360
not going to buy that console. Oh, I know one big thing I need to mention, uh, Jurassic world

24:55.360 --> 25:00.160
evolution. They did show off a trailer for a new game and you know, it, it had the big grand

25:00.160 --> 25:06.560
sweeping footages and then dinosaurs are there and dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, you know that

25:06.560 --> 25:12.320
what we all come to expect from Jurassic park, right? I was into it. I liked it. Like Jurassic

25:12.320 --> 25:17.600
world tycoon. Yeah. I think that's kind of neat actually. Like if they're going to do like a

25:17.600 --> 25:22.640
rollercoaster tycoon, but you get to have dinosaurs and like, instead of, okay. Okay.

25:23.840 --> 25:28.240
I really hope this reference is not lost on the entire audience, but there is like one of the

25:28.240 --> 25:33.040
most hilarious, I don't remember if it was vine or YouTube or what it was one of the most hilarious

25:33.040 --> 25:37.360
fucking things I've ever seen in my life. I don't know why it's so funny to me,

25:37.360 --> 25:41.040
but there's this clip and it's from one of those rollercoaster tycoon games where you can actually

25:41.040 --> 25:45.600
watch the people go down the rollercoaster. Right. And they're writing it starts off with a

25:45.600 --> 25:51.120
Rihanna's song. Uh, we found love in a hopeless place. Like it's all like happy and bouncy and

25:51.120 --> 25:54.480
they're going on the rollercoaster and they're doing like the thing or whatever. And then all of

25:54.480 --> 26:03.600
a sudden the track ends and the music changes to Adele as the rollercoaster goes flying off the

26:03.600 --> 26:08.160
track and all the people, and it goes in slow motion and all the people are flying off and

26:08.160 --> 26:15.360
there's explosions and gone. Oh no, no, no, no, no. It's a really sad Adele stuff, right?

26:16.400 --> 26:19.520
I don't know why, maybe I was just drunk when I saw it the first time and I thought it was

26:19.520 --> 26:23.120
like the funniest thing I'd ever seen. So the reason why I bring that clip up is because

26:23.840 --> 26:27.200
if in Jurassic world, you're going to be able to like do that, but like, you know,

26:27.200 --> 26:31.760
instead you might have an outbreak where like, oops, the dinosaurs are eating your guests.

26:31.760 --> 26:37.840
That's going to be fucking rad bathrooms in this park. I'm dropping your ass in the T-Rex cage.

26:38.160 --> 26:45.680
Would you play a game like that? Dark soccer. I know you're not big on Microsoft, but could a,

26:45.680 --> 26:49.760
could a Jurassic world game where the dinosaurs eat the guests. Could that make you like, look,

26:49.760 --> 26:54.800
that was the only reason I watched like, what was the second one where they took the dinosaur

26:54.800 --> 27:00.320
to New York? A San Diego. Yes. Yeah. Whatever. Just because of the whole scene where they're

27:00.320 --> 27:05.280
all walking through the field and like they're being picked out like a buffet. And my friend,

27:05.280 --> 27:10.560
Danielle and I were watching it laughing our asses off. I would play a game like where you

27:10.560 --> 27:14.880
could play the dinosaurs, picking them out of the grass. So yeah, maybe. Okay. I wouldn't be,

27:14.880 --> 27:19.760
I wouldn't play the dinosaurs. SSG100Matt says, looking for it now in regards to YouTube. Come

27:19.760 --> 27:25.760
on. No Gus says I'm convinced Rob is tipsy. I'm not. I'm totally sober right now. I, Alan. You're

27:25.760 --> 27:29.120
high on life. Alan will know where that YouTube is. He will know where it is. I'm gonna ask him

27:29.120 --> 27:32.880
to go find it for me. So you guys know I'm not crazy and I'll just, I'll post it to the OLR

27:32.880 --> 27:40.080
Twitter. There you go. You know what now? We're at what? Jurassic park is frightening in the dark.

27:40.640 --> 27:45.040
All right. Anyway, uh, we're going to get into our gaming weeks, but I do want to address one piece

27:45.040 --> 27:49.680
of like late breaking ish type of news. Um, after we finished show roll, but before the show started

27:49.680 --> 27:54.880
tonight, so I don't know if you guys saw, but it's going around Twitter right now that PlayStation

27:54.880 --> 28:03.360
got hacked, which is a half truth. It seems so far. Uh, it, it appears that, well, the social

28:03.360 --> 28:08.640
media clearly was hacked. Uh, PlayStation social media account. There was a message on there that

28:08.640 --> 28:12.080
said, you know, dah, dah, dah, where this, I don't even remember who the group was and it doesn't

28:12.080 --> 28:16.480
matter, but basically that, you know, hacker fortune we got, we got in your account and all

28:16.480 --> 28:21.360
this stuff and email us and all this, but I believe they claimed in that message to have

28:21.360 --> 28:27.600
like PlayStation login, but it's unclear if they meant like the big thing that happened in 2011 or

28:27.600 --> 28:33.360
like we have your social media logins. So I wouldn't think you should panic right now about

28:33.360 --> 28:41.840
your own personal login. However, there is never a bad time to go in, change your password and enable

28:41.840 --> 28:46.800
two factor authentication. So, you know, whether they were hacked or not, maybe those are two

28:46.800 --> 28:51.360
things you should think about doing, uh, enable that two factor auth. If you don't have it yet,

28:51.360 --> 28:56.400
now's a great time to do that and a great reminder for that. But otherwise they could, maybe they

28:56.400 --> 29:00.720
just brute forced social media passwords until they figured it out. I mean, I don't know. It's,

29:00.720 --> 29:06.000
it's hard to say. So there you go. Did SSJ100 Matt find that YouTube clip? Oh my God. He did,

29:06.000 --> 29:10.320
didn't he? Wait, hold on. This is very important for live radio. And I know this is, uh,

29:10.880 --> 29:14.720
I know this is internet and a radio and you can't really see this or whatever.

29:15.520 --> 29:20.880
Yes. This is it. Oh my God. This is it. Okay. Okay. No, this is very important. Dark soccer

29:20.880 --> 29:32.400
load. You have to see this. Oh, it's not even the Rihanna song. Okay. Wait, why did I think,

29:32.400 --> 29:35.200
I mean, I know it's the backdrop to the Rihanna song, but I swear when I saw this,

29:35.200 --> 29:38.320
it was like, because they have multiple, like they probably have multiple rollercoasters.

29:41.040 --> 29:44.160
Okay. Anyway, I'm going to have the one that goes back into the crowd. I'm going to fast forward.

29:44.160 --> 29:50.560
Yes. Hold on. So they're going up and they go down. Okay, here we go.

29:52.160 --> 29:55.520
See, and they're going through the rollercoaster and we were having so much fun.

29:57.600 --> 30:06.160
Rollercoaster tycoon three. Yes. And then it goes up and it's a crash.

30:06.160 --> 30:12.960
Do you know that someone recreated,

30:12.960 --> 30:16.240
imagine dinosaurs are eating all those people after they come off.

30:17.360 --> 30:20.640
Really works for radio about the Jurassic park game too.

30:20.640 --> 30:23.920
Is it's also on PlayStation and PC. Oh, is it?

30:27.440 --> 30:31.760
Someone made the death coaster and roller coaster tycoon. I'm sure everybody made the

30:31.760 --> 30:37.440
death coaster. The euthanasia coaster. Now what if the euthanasia coaster had dinosaurs?

30:39.120 --> 30:42.080
What a way to go. Why not? You, you were big on the Sims.

30:42.080 --> 30:45.040
Have they ever done a dinosaur expansion for the Sims?

30:45.040 --> 30:47.040
No, but I'm sure. What if they do now?

30:47.040 --> 30:50.080
I'm sure someone did like pets mods or something where you could have like

30:50.080 --> 30:52.560
velociraptors or something. I don't know. All right. Anyway.

30:54.320 --> 30:58.640
Come on, Noel Gus in chat says, eh, if they want to hack my Tumblr, go for it.

30:58.640 --> 31:04.480
Lots of brute force solo vids on there. I guess that's what Tumblr's for. All right,

31:05.120 --> 31:09.360
let's move on. So anyway, about the hacking for PlayStation, I wouldn't panic,

31:09.360 --> 31:14.320
but changing your passwords, never a bad idea. So let's talk about our two factor.

31:14.320 --> 31:18.960
Yes. Two factor, always a good idea. Like if you don't have two factor on your important shit,

31:18.960 --> 31:24.080
like your email, you have got, wow. And I didn't realize, um, and we, I think we talked about this,

31:24.640 --> 31:29.200
since it's done by the Planet Coaster devs and Planet Coaster is pretty awesome.

31:29.200 --> 31:34.400
So the Jurassic world games by Planet Coaster. Oh, maybe I'll play it. Oh,

31:34.400 --> 31:38.880
oh, that changes everything. That's going to be some fucking awesome shit. Okay. Yeah. Now hype,

31:40.080 --> 31:46.480
Jurassic hype. All right. Let's, uh, let's get into our gaming week. Star Sakura.

31:46.480 --> 31:51.280
Jack shit. You didn't play anything? I don't really play anything. Well, I mean,

31:51.280 --> 31:56.400
other than me, Tomo and Pokemon go and Sailor Moon drops something Sailor Moon drop. Oh,

31:56.400 --> 32:02.400
that's that little phone game, right? Yeah. It's annoying. Um, I really didn't play much of

32:02.400 --> 32:10.560
anything. Um, I, I, I put down for a Kickstarter, which I will be talking about later, but, um, no,

32:11.360 --> 32:14.480
kind of gamed out for a little bit just for this week. It's been a,

32:15.360 --> 32:21.520
last week was kind of a, uh, an odd week taking a week off. Yeah. I just needed to not stare at

32:21.520 --> 32:27.920
things so much. So we watched all of defenders instead. Cause that's, that's what it is. It

32:27.920 --> 32:32.720
was a Netflix weekend, not a video games. It's all Jessica Jones all the time. There's the answer.

32:32.720 --> 32:38.560
Jessica Jones plus Luke cage equals OTP. All right. So it's not that you're just over games.

32:38.560 --> 32:43.680
It's just that I was actually a little tired of being, you know, latched to my computer after I'm

32:43.680 --> 32:48.000
on a computer all day at work. So fair enough. Fair enough. All right. Uh, how about you,

32:48.000 --> 32:57.440
Loki? Did you have any luck with gaming? Um, no, uh, no, honestly this weekend was more of a Lego

32:57.440 --> 33:04.400
weekend cause, uh, we made a trip to the Lego store. We have a Lego hobby shop nearby and I

33:04.400 --> 33:10.320
bought one of the cool sets that they have from Lego movie because my son really likes fire trucks

33:10.320 --> 33:14.320
and they had a fire truck mech and I was like, that shit's going to be awesome to put together.

33:14.320 --> 33:18.800
And it was, it was very awesome. Um, it was also cool about that too, is they actually have,

33:18.800 --> 33:23.360
it's an unlock code for the Lego movie game, which I have so I can unlock a character.

33:24.000 --> 33:30.080
I think that mech thing in that game. So that's pretty cool. Um, I did play a little bit of like

33:30.080 --> 33:36.080
mobile stuff. I'm still playing the office space game. Um, they've tweeted some more like each

33:36.080 --> 33:42.800
week it's a different game. Almost they keep adding stuff to it. Um, and then I also played

33:42.800 --> 33:47.280
a little bit, uh, Pokemon go because my son went back to school and he used to have a pokey stop

33:47.280 --> 33:53.040
as school, but apparently cause you know, portals in pokey stops at schools is a big no-no.

33:53.040 --> 33:56.320
Someone finally caught on and they removed it and I was like, ah, God damn it. Now what am I,

33:56.320 --> 34:02.800
how am I doing the morning? So yeah, that was unfortunate. And then I played ingress and by

34:02.800 --> 34:08.960
playing ingress, I mean I opened up the ingress and I took out, you know, some items from my MUFG

34:08.960 --> 34:13.760
capsules so that they can just keep generating. You played more than I did of that game. There's

34:13.760 --> 34:19.840
more things that I'm never going to use because I'm just not interested anymore. But you know,

34:19.840 --> 34:25.280
occasionally I'll just like, did it, did any of my, you know, Jarvis viruses, um,

34:25.280 --> 34:31.760
duplicate. Oh, once in like two months. Okay, cool. Yeah, that's worth it. There you go.

34:33.680 --> 34:38.000
To register participation for this week's episode of orange on radio at vog network.com.

34:38.000 --> 34:43.280
Use the pass phrase price. All right, let's see my gear. We are, I played, I played some stuff.

34:43.280 --> 34:46.800
I played a little bit. I mean, a lot of it is, you know, the stuff I've been continuing with.

34:46.800 --> 34:52.080
Uh, if you watched after the show last week, I did Ori in the blind forest on Twitch and I think

34:52.080 --> 34:55.440
that was a really fun stream. And that, that game, I'm really glad I went back and revisited

34:55.440 --> 34:59.360
that game and I need to play more of it. I just, you know, I got sidetracked with other stuff.

34:59.360 --> 35:04.800
Now I'm including splatoon two, which I still been playing. I'm really trying to force myself

35:04.800 --> 35:10.240
to use things that are not the roller. Um, and I'm actually, you know what, my score is getting

35:10.240 --> 35:15.200
better by using the dualies. Have you tried the umbrella or whatever that was? No, cause the

35:15.200 --> 35:20.560
umbrella is level nine and I'm still level eight, but I'm like one bucket. I'm one match away from

35:20.560 --> 35:25.040
level nine. Uh, the bucket, I like it as a weapon, but I'm not very good with it. Same thing with

35:25.040 --> 35:29.040
the paintbrush. I love the paintbrush as a weapon, but I'm not very good with it, but I might go back

35:29.040 --> 35:34.160
and try to like force myself to play it more because here's the thing. I don't do motion

35:34.160 --> 35:40.640
controls with the roller, but I will do motion controls with the dualies and the like the guns,

35:40.640 --> 35:44.960
because I kind of think you have to like, I'm starting to realize like, okay, if you want more

35:44.960 --> 35:51.680
that kind of like mouse and keyboard type of feeling, you kind of have to use motion controls

35:51.680 --> 35:56.080
and they did make it so that like, you know, when you press the Y button, it resets. So it doesn't

35:56.080 --> 35:59.680
get too crazy. And you know, it is sensitive. I mean, the motion control technology has come a

35:59.680 --> 36:04.880
long way since the Nintendo Wii. So like, you know, it's not like crazy. It's, it's pretty,

36:04.880 --> 36:08.560
especially with the pro controller, I use pro controller. It's pretty, it feels pretty good.

36:08.560 --> 36:12.800
So, um, I'm just kind of forcing myself to learn that way and I'm, I'm making progress. So I feel

36:12.800 --> 36:18.000
a little better about what I'm doing in Splatoon 2. Um, and then, uh, let's see one new game that

36:18.000 --> 36:23.920
I checked out this week, Sonic Mania on, uh, PlayStation 4, actually, I forgot that game was

36:23.920 --> 36:28.400
coming out on Switch and I saw it on the PlayStation 4 and I bought it as soon as I saw it. I was like,

36:28.400 --> 36:31.840
oh yeah, that game was out this week. And then I realized it was coming on the Switch. I was like,

36:31.840 --> 36:36.960
shoot, I could have got it there so I could have it portable and TV, but, oh, well I have the

36:36.960 --> 36:42.640
trophies and whatever, you know, sharing and all that stuff the PlayStation has. So whatever.

36:42.720 --> 36:49.280
Um, but I like, I like Sonic Mania. It's cool. Uh, it, it basically, it's basically what Sonic 4

36:49.280 --> 36:53.600
should have been. I mean, that's what it is. It's, it's what Sonic 4 should have been. Uh,

36:53.600 --> 36:58.960
so they're getting to it now. My, the only like tiny little complaint I can have about Sonic Mania

36:58.960 --> 37:04.000
is that I feel like there's still a couple bugs in it. Like I beat a boss. Okay. I don't want to

37:04.000 --> 37:10.320
spoil it, but at the end of the second, at the end of the, um, chemical plant zone, there's like a,

37:10.320 --> 37:16.320
there's a boss where everybody's like, whoa, cool. You know, type of thing. Okay. I beat that boss

37:16.320 --> 37:21.440
and got a game over screen. Like as soon as I like flew out of the boss fight, I got a game

37:21.440 --> 37:24.240
over screen. I was like, what the hell did I like run out of time or something? What the hell

37:24.240 --> 37:28.560
happened? So I thought that was weird. It was a weird bug. Um, but it's, it's fine. There's

37:28.560 --> 37:33.280
tiny little bugs. It's they'll get patched. It's not too big a deal. Um, cause the bugs aren't

37:33.280 --> 37:38.000
besides that one. It wasn't that big a deal. Uh, but the only other thing is that the bonus

37:38.000 --> 37:44.000
rounds kind of show up almost too much. Like I felt like half the time I was playing that

37:44.880 --> 37:49.440
bonus game from Sonic three with the blue spheres and the red spheres. Like I spent like half my

37:49.440 --> 37:53.840
time playing that game, which I just started skipping them at some point. Like I don't even

37:53.840 --> 37:58.480
bother to do those bonus games as much anymore. Cause I want to play the actual side scroller

37:58.480 --> 38:02.800
game, which is great. And there's like, what I really like is that they'll do like green

38:02.800 --> 38:07.520
Hills zone cause they have to cause it's Sonic. So they'll do that for the first for act one.

38:07.520 --> 38:11.040
But then when they do act two, it's still green Hill zones, but they've put a new twist on it.

38:11.040 --> 38:14.960
Like they added a zip line to it, like a new power up or something. It didn't exist before.

38:14.960 --> 38:18.400
And they do that a lot in chemical plant zone too, where there's like all these new things

38:18.400 --> 38:22.640
that weren't there before. So I thought that was, it makes chemical plants suck less. It does

38:22.640 --> 38:26.800
believe it or not. It makes it suck less. I mean, it's, they still like, they keep some of the cool

38:26.800 --> 38:31.200
stuff. Like, you know how like the ramps in chemical plant zone kind of looked like a helix,

38:31.200 --> 38:35.600
like they still do that, but now they have like other power ups and things that make the zone more

38:35.600 --> 38:40.320
interesting. So, um, yeah, I'm, I'm enjoying Sonic media. I think this would be right up

38:40.320 --> 38:44.400
your alley, dark soccer. You guys should consider checking that out. It's been thinking about it.

38:44.400 --> 38:49.200
Yeah. Um, let's see. Tiger claw and chat says, did you play with Sonic and tails?

38:49.200 --> 38:52.560
Cause having tails around helps you get into certain places that are unreachable.

38:52.560 --> 38:56.240
I have not played it that way yet, but I'm aware that that's a thing. Uh, come on,

38:56.240 --> 39:02.320
no Gus and chat says, can you play us knuckles? Yes. You can select between Sonic knuckles,

39:02.320 --> 39:07.920
tails or, um, Sonic and knuckles or Sonic and tails. I think the only thing you can't do is

39:07.920 --> 39:11.680
tails and knuckles. And I might even be wrong on that. Cause I haven't played around with it as

39:11.680 --> 39:18.240
much. So there you go. Um, yeah. So I do recommend Sonic mania if you're into like old school Sonic

39:18.240 --> 39:22.640
games and Sonic's been kind of weird to you lately because it's only bit, it was only 20 bucks. So

39:22.640 --> 39:27.920
it's a pretty good deal. So, um, yeah. Uh, good times on that. And then, uh, I played a little

39:27.920 --> 39:34.560
bit of no man's sky cause the whole re imagining, um, I want to get it on PC, but they, I should say

39:34.560 --> 39:39.520
smartly, I guess they bumped the price back up to 60 bucks after that little sale they had last

39:39.520 --> 39:42.640
week. They put the price back up to six bucks. Yeah, I should have bought it. Yeah, I know. I

39:42.640 --> 39:46.240
should have bought it during that sale. Just wait for this. Wait for the next steam sale.

39:46.240 --> 39:50.000
There'll be another, I'm not that worried about it, but uh, yeah, they're, they're trying to cash

39:50.000 --> 39:54.240
in on people that are like, Oh, I should revisit this game now because of the, uh, the changes and

39:54.240 --> 39:59.920
all that stuff. Uh, a little bit of Overwatch as well. Uh, I think I did some streaming of

39:59.920 --> 40:04.640
Overwatch the other night. Actually I did death match on PTR and I got my ass handed to me. It

40:04.640 --> 40:13.520
was really bad. Um, but it was nice to like try it out. So, uh, yeah, that's it. Uh, Bobby Blackwolf

40:13.520 --> 40:17.680
and chat says there's a secret mode to even do knuckles and knuckles. So I was, I was not even

40:17.680 --> 40:21.760
aware of that. So there's some secrets I have yet to discover in the game. How about that?

40:22.560 --> 40:25.200
But what would be the point of doing knuckles? Because you can,

40:26.480 --> 40:30.640
what's the point of doing a lot of stuff in games because you can't. Anyway, uh, we're going to get

40:30.640 --> 40:35.920
into news, but first some housekeeping. Uh, we're not going to be here the week after next because

40:35.920 --> 40:39.520
dragon con I'm going to be at dragon con. Uh, so if you're going to be in the Atlanta area,

40:39.520 --> 40:43.200
you should come check out dragon con. I'm going to be on several panels throughout the weekend.

40:43.200 --> 40:48.960
We'll have the list all pointed and posted at vog network.com during this week. But I'm on like

40:48.960 --> 40:54.240

iTunes or wherever you found this show. All that stuff goes a long, long way. We appreciate it.

42:09.840 --> 42:17.120
Let's get into some gaming news. So they're doing, uh, finally new too is coming to Pokemon go

42:17.840 --> 42:21.920
and it's going to be coming via the raid battles of course, but it's a brand new type of raid

42:21.920 --> 42:30.560
battle called exclusive raid battles. So, um, you, with that, I guess the way it's going to work is

42:31.520 --> 42:35.360
assuming where these are going to come, cause it's going to be different places, but

42:35.920 --> 42:41.200
if you have done a, you have to be invited to these battles and in order to get an invite,

42:41.200 --> 42:46.080
you would have had to have completed a traditional raid battle at the location where it's supposed

42:46.080 --> 42:50.880
to appear. So there's saying that you get an invite and they just, they let you know when

42:52.320 --> 42:57.280
this, you know, event's going to happen. They're really not doing a good job explaining this.

42:58.080 --> 43:02.080
No, they are not. They need to show screenshots. They need to walk through an example,

43:02.080 --> 43:07.040
cause this is a weird system because how do I know which gyms I should be fighting? So,

43:07.040 --> 43:13.360
I mean, in a way I think Niantic's being a little bit skeezy with this because that tells me you

43:13.360 --> 43:20.160
need to play raids at as many gyms as possible. So buy more raid passes and I'm just like,

43:20.160 --> 43:24.560
go to hell. You know what I mean? I mean, yes, you get a free raid pass every day,

43:24.560 --> 43:29.040
a free raid pass every day. And if you're getting your coins, I guess you could get

43:29.840 --> 43:33.680
others if you don't buy incubators or anything else. But I'm just a little bit like,

43:33.680 --> 43:37.840
I'm a little side-eyed with Niantic right now. Like you need to explain this better because

43:38.880 --> 43:44.400
also the infrastructure in Pokemon Go, like there's still a lot of garbage stuff happening

43:44.400 --> 43:50.000
in the game. For example, yesterday, Alan and I went raiding downtown so we could try to get some

43:50.000 --> 43:53.520
more, our friend JD was here. We had another friend we were raiding with. So there's a group

43:53.520 --> 43:57.520
of four of us trying to go get some of the things like Lugia and Articuno and you know,

43:57.520 --> 44:00.960
some of those things that are out right now. So we went to do a Lugia raid. No,

44:00.960 --> 44:05.520
it wasn't Lugia, it was Articuno at one of the light rail stops downtown where Articuno

44:05.520 --> 44:12.000
was spawned. And so we did the raid and there was 12 of us. Well, only 11 of us got in because what

44:12.000 --> 44:17.120
happened? While Alan was trying to get into the battle, his game crashed. He used his raid pass

44:17.120 --> 44:22.240
to get in there. And then the game crashed. He tried to bring it right back up as fast as

44:22.240 --> 44:26.800
possible, but he was continuously getting network errors. So he couldn't get back into the game

44:26.800 --> 44:31.840
right away. Finally, as soon as the raid battle's done, his network errors stop,

44:31.840 --> 44:36.000
he gets in the game, but he gets none of the rewards and his raid pass has been spent.

44:36.560 --> 44:41.600
So he can go back in and do another battle and we waited 30 minutes for more people to show up.

44:41.600 --> 44:46.320
But I just thought that was a little garbage that you know, if you spend the raid pass to get in

44:46.320 --> 44:52.400
there, because the phone and the network and all this stuff is still a little wonky and isn't rock

44:52.400 --> 44:57.120
solid, you can still get screwed out of something. And I just can't, I just can't imagine that

44:57.120 --> 45:02.400
happening with Mewtwo. People are going to be crazy about that stuff. And I remember I thought

45:02.400 --> 45:06.000
of another time we were raiding outside this restaurant. We were doing, I think it was when

45:06.000 --> 45:11.120
Zapdos was out and there was this seven year old kid who was trying to do this. And as soon as

45:11.120 --> 45:16.320
Zapdos like died and it went into the catch thing, the little kid's phone crashed and he started

45:16.320 --> 45:21.680
crying because he was like, I wanted to catch the Zapdos. And his like dad ran over and was like

45:21.680 --> 45:24.960
trying to fix it. And I think they were able to get right back in and everything. But I was just

45:24.960 --> 45:31.200
like, you know, I definitely had that moment of like, wow, these tech issues cause little kids to

45:31.200 --> 45:40.000
cry. Good job Niantic, you're making kids cry. So I just feel like before they roll out this crazy

45:40.000 --> 45:45.120
shit where it's like, well, in order to do this, you're going to have to align during the solar

45:45.120 --> 45:48.960
eclipse. You're going to have to visit the second star on the right and head straight on until

45:48.960 --> 45:52.960
morning. And then you have to make sure that you have the upgrade item over here and you have to

45:52.960 --> 45:56.800
raid over here in this city. And then over here in this, before they roll out all these stupid rules,

45:56.800 --> 46:01.840
like you need to like iron out the fucking game that you have because there's a lot to love about

46:01.840 --> 46:07.600
Pokemon Go. There really is, but I would have a much easier time loving it if it would work

46:09.120 --> 46:16.400
reliably. And it doesn't right now. So could you get on that first before you decide to do this

46:16.400 --> 46:21.600
whole, now we're going to do an even crazier type of raid where probably even more people

46:21.600 --> 46:25.600
are going to be there because we'll probably invite a hundred people to take on Mewtwo at

46:25.600 --> 46:30.720
these. I'm just like, Oh God, I just, I just fear what this is going to look like. Now here's the

46:30.720 --> 46:37.200
other interesting thing. It'll look like Chicago. Now here's the other interesting thing. If I did

46:38.080 --> 46:43.040
this rolls out the 1st of September. Yeah. Okay. Guess we're going to be the 1st of September.

46:43.840 --> 46:50.480
Atlanta, DragonCon. Now I see that there's good news and bad news. The good news is there's going

46:50.480 --> 46:55.200
to be no fucking shortage of people to raid. That's a given. If one of those fuckers spawns

46:55.200 --> 46:59.760
at the hotel at the stop of the hotel, like it's fucking on. But the other thing is I'm like, wait

46:59.760 --> 47:05.280
a minute. If I'm going to be in Atlanta on the 1st of September, am I going to keep getting raid

47:05.280 --> 47:12.320
invites back here in Sacramento? Because that part is going to fucking suck. So I'm going to be a

47:12.320 --> 47:17.600
little peeved if like, don't worry. It's not coming to Sacramento. It's going to be like

47:17.600 --> 47:22.800
central park, New York. And that way we can have, you know, the news thing of like Mewtwo will be

47:22.800 --> 47:28.320
in more places than that, but it's just, you know, I I'm, I'm a little scared about this whole thing.

47:28.320 --> 47:36.160
So we'll see. Let's see. Um, come on. No, Gus and chat says pokey. No, I'm not giving them another

47:36.160 --> 47:40.560
dime. Uh, let's see. Dark Tetsuya says, I hope the Mewtwo thing is handled better than that

47:40.560 --> 47:45.520
event. A few weeks back as to 100. Matt says I beat a Moltres earlier this week. The game

47:45.520 --> 47:50.640
crashed during the bonus catch portion. When I got back in, it displayed it. Like I never beat it.

47:50.640 --> 47:55.600
I tried to fight it again and it kept erring out. I lost my raid pass and got nothing to show for

47:55.600 --> 48:01.760
it. Uh, and this gentleman continues central park is shit for Pokemon go playing. The game has a

48:01.760 --> 48:05.840
hard time processing everything going on on there. Oh yeah. And it's spoo for central.

48:06.560 --> 48:12.320
Exactly. It may be shit, but that means nothing to Niantic. It's just a location on a map for

48:12.320 --> 48:17.760
them. Uh, pure 39 is no, I mean, I have an easier time playing in San Francisco at peer 39. I have

48:17.760 --> 48:24.080
an easier time doing that with the little pogo plus and my phone off. Like, uh, because it

48:24.080 --> 48:28.960
doesn't have to render all the other shit going on, like with the game up. Uh, cause one of my

48:28.960 --> 48:33.200
friends that I was with his game kept crashing over and over and over again. But again, that

48:33.200 --> 48:37.840
just goes back to the point of, look, I think it's great that Niantic has like got these new

48:37.840 --> 48:41.760
ideas for the game and the gym stuff is really like neat now and all this other stuff. But like,

48:41.760 --> 48:48.320
seriously Niantic fix the fucking game you have before trying to like go crazy with all these

48:48.320 --> 48:56.720
flavors. Don't go crazy. Anyway, I can't wait for Ingress to be on this engine too. Well,

48:56.720 --> 49:01.200
I don't know. At least there's a lot less people playing that Ingress is kind of over unless,

49:01.200 --> 49:04.880
unless they do something really cool in 2.0 but Ingress is just getting really stale. But anyway,

49:04.880 --> 49:14.800
that's, we got to catch these portal beasts and the containment and um, and there's going to be a,

49:14.800 --> 49:23.360
um, uh, gym that you battle them. I just, I, I'm, you know, I still bring up Ingress once in a

49:23.360 --> 49:27.120
while. Somebody asked me to do a favor, like bump their portals. Of course I'll do it. You know,

49:27.120 --> 49:30.640
if I'm going to be there anyway, playing Pokemon too. But it's also one of the things where it's

49:30.640 --> 49:37.520
just like, I kind of, if any game needs like an energy meter, Ingress needs it. I know that's not

49:37.520 --> 49:42.320
a popular opinion, but no, I agree because there's people that dedicate their lives to that game

49:42.960 --> 49:49.280
and that's not healthy for any game. No, I did not be waking up at two in the morning to spend

49:49.280 --> 49:53.680
all day playing and then like literally all day playing. Jamie, you need an energy meter. What?

49:53.680 --> 50:00.080
Me so that you can see when I'm low energy, I have to pay you $10 to recharge. Yes. You have

50:00.080 --> 50:06.880
to pay me $10 to recharge or pizza or coffee, coffee. Anyhow, I offered you coffee. All right.

50:06.880 --> 50:10.960
Yeah, I was already drinking soda. Moving on. Let's talk about, let's go back to Microsoft

50:10.960 --> 50:15.360
and talk about more bad news for Microsoft. In fact, this could be the worst news of the entire

50:15.360 --> 50:21.360
week. I don't know. You guys be the judge, but, uh, so Xbox one, uh, is getting a new game, uh,

50:21.360 --> 50:26.880
that just came out this past week. Conan exiles. That's right. Now of course this game was already

50:26.880 --> 50:33.360
on PC and why was this game famous on PC? Why did this game take over riveting gameplay?

50:33.360 --> 50:40.960
It's just such a great MMO. That's right. That's right. Oh, and dongs everywhere. Dongs, dongs,

50:40.960 --> 50:49.680
dongs, children, and yes, titties, the beave, all of it was all the children who can access

50:49.680 --> 50:57.040
consoles, but can you decide how hairy it is? I, I don't know. I haven't played the game,

50:57.040 --> 51:02.880
but I do know it did have it. The dogs had a meter and you could adjust the, I almost bought it

51:02.880 --> 51:07.680
endowment. I almost bought it, but I bought Tacoma instead. That was probably a good choice.

51:07.680 --> 51:11.840
I keep forgetting Tacoma came out. I need to play that anyway. But did they have dong meters in

51:11.840 --> 51:16.240
Tacoma? Well, here's the problem. No, they do not. But, uh, you know, you gotta, you gotta make

51:16.240 --> 51:21.440
tough decisions sometimes. Well, here's the thing. Uh, in America, the SRB rated Conan

51:21.440 --> 51:30.320
exiles M for mature and not AO because in America only partial nudity will be allowed. However,

51:30.320 --> 51:36.080
in Europe, uh, all that will be on display. So is the Xbox Xbox one region free? Cause if so,

51:36.080 --> 51:41.120
you need to buy your copy of this game from Europe and then dong, new dong city everywhere.

51:41.760 --> 51:45.920
Yeah. But the problem is I think is it's server base, isn't it? So I would assume

51:45.920 --> 51:52.720
the game copies are all in MMO. So maybe if you're in a certain region, PC master race.

51:52.720 --> 51:58.640
Well, anyway, uh, if you want to play this on, uh, Xbox one in America, you will be forced to

51:58.640 --> 52:03.840
wear panties. You will be forced to put your panties on and play the game without your private

52:03.840 --> 52:09.680
parts being everywhere on display. Why, why do we have to hide this from like, I mean they had dogs

52:09.680 --> 52:14.400
and other games. I don't understand why it's such a big deal. Is it because children have accesses

52:14.400 --> 52:19.120
because cause fucking retarded parents are like, I'm just going to, this is admin. It has adult

52:19.120 --> 52:24.240
content new today. I'm going to buy it for my five year old over here. It's a member of America has

52:24.240 --> 52:28.960
less of a problem with violence than they do with bit. It's a little more complicated than that

52:28.960 --> 52:34.160
Loki because the AO rating, unfortunately, and I'm not, I'm just, I'm just telling you why I'm not

52:34.160 --> 52:40.160
saying this is a good thing. Unfortunately, the AO rating is pretty much akin to the NC 17 rating.

52:40.160 --> 52:45.440
And when you have an NC 17 rating, you're the movie, the theater will not show it. Blockbuster

52:45.440 --> 52:52.320
won't rent it. Those few, those 10 blockbusters left in America won't rent it unless it's show

52:52.320 --> 52:58.640
girls. Well, because it's edited down to an R rated version, um, which is what happened here.

52:58.640 --> 53:02.560
And that's what happened in showgirls. They had to put panties on in showgirls. They had to draw

53:02.560 --> 53:07.120
them on where that was the VH one in it. Right. So that's what happened here. They had to draw

53:07.120 --> 53:12.240
on those fake panties and bras and things. They had to draw them on. I've actually,

53:12.240 --> 53:18.720
I would play Conan exiles. If it looked like it did in the VH one show girls that it was like

53:18.720 --> 53:25.600
that safe for porn videos, like playing the drums and like shit like that. Like it's drawn in MS.

53:25.600 --> 53:29.920
Yeah, it is great. It's great. It's pretty bad. Anyway. Where was I? Oh yes. So the AO rating,

53:29.920 --> 53:35.920
here's the problem with an AO rating. You can't stream the game on Twitch. GameStop won't sell

53:35.920 --> 53:40.640
it. A lot of mailer major retail Walmart ain't going to sell it. Can you, can you stream the

53:40.640 --> 53:49.600
PC version on Twitch? Yes. I know. I just say it. I'm just saying Twitch is, I mean,

53:49.600 --> 53:54.480
again, I don't work for Twitch. Maybe they have a policy that I'm unclear on, but last I understood

53:54.480 --> 54:00.000
it, the Twitch policy is if the game is rated AO, you can't stream it on Twitch. And they actually

54:00.000 --> 54:07.600
have a list of games. And they also have certain indie games that are unrated that are also on the

54:07.600 --> 54:14.000
list. Age of Conan is not one of those games that's on the list last I heard. If I'm wrong,

54:14.000 --> 54:17.840
live chatters, please correct me on that. But I believe that's the difference. When a game's on

54:17.840 --> 54:23.120
PC, Loki, it doesn't have to be rated. Games on console have to be rated. So I think Age of Conan

54:23.120 --> 54:29.360
wasn't rated when it came out. And so dong, dong, dong, dong, dong, dong, everywhere. And now on the

54:29.360 --> 54:39.600
console, you know, censorship. Forced underwear. Let's see. Come on, no Gus in chat says Twitch

54:39.600 --> 54:44.160
doesn't like dongs, I thought. Well, they certainly don't like real dongs and let's make that clear

54:44.160 --> 54:48.880
too. And that goes for lady parts too. So you are, you do, like they actually, I think like Twitch

54:48.880 --> 54:53.840
has a rule that's like, put a goddamn shirt on. Like, I think they have a shirt on with,

54:55.120 --> 55:01.200
it's still technically a shirt. It's just, you know, that v-neck, that v-neck that drops way

55:01.200 --> 55:07.200
down. And I promise I won't wear it again. But what, what were they calling that sweater? The,

55:07.200 --> 55:14.080
the manslayer or you mean the, the rompers? No, no, no. They had those sweaters for men,

55:14.080 --> 55:19.360
the virgin killer. That was it. I don't, I don't even know what that is. No, it was like these

55:19.360 --> 55:25.520
really low cut in the back. Am I allowed, am I allowed to wear a male romper on Twitch? No,

55:25.520 --> 55:34.160
no one's allowed to wear a male romper. Fuck that. But you're stifling my artistic creativity

55:34.160 --> 55:39.680
with my body as the canvas. If I were to wear a male romper full of kittens, I'm going to do it.

55:39.680 --> 55:44.400
Oh, you can wear it full of kittens, but just wearing a male romper. No, no one in, no one.

55:44.400 --> 55:51.040
No, no, never. Let's see, go into chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

55:51.040 --> 55:57.360
Uh, Rob Roberts, Rama says to me in chat says, there are guys that can wear them too for

55:57.360 --> 56:03.120
du-dwar. Are you, are you familiar with the trend that is du-dwar Dark Sakura?

56:03.120 --> 56:07.680
I'd rather not. Well, you know, boudoir, right? If you know boudoir photography places, you know,

56:07.680 --> 56:11.200
where, where housewives can get, you know, Christmas presents for their husbands.

56:11.200 --> 56:16.240
I wouldn't know anything about that. Well, now dude war is, well, Loki,

56:16.240 --> 56:19.440
maybe Mrs. Loki would like some dude war this holiday. I doubt it.

56:20.560 --> 56:25.200
Unless they have models in hand that can take pictures because he's any,

56:27.760 --> 56:32.240
if we can get that guy from, was it a criminal minds or whatever?

56:32.240 --> 56:38.960
What, what, what guy from criminal minds? The black dude with the weird eyebrows.

56:38.960 --> 56:41.920
I've never watched that show, so I have no idea. He's a pretty attractive guy.

56:41.920 --> 56:43.840
Is he a attractive guy? A very attractive man.

56:43.840 --> 56:48.160
All right. Nelly wants, Nelly wants dude war of that individual.

56:48.160 --> 56:54.720
She'd rather have a dude war of that. And I don't blame her because he is a very attractive man.

56:54.720 --> 56:58.960
He just needs to shave his eyebrows a little bit because he's got the unibrow going and it's just

56:58.960 --> 57:08.000
not that hot. All right. Uh, anyway, uh, I don't, I don't know. Not, not Joe Manteca.

57:08.000 --> 57:12.320
No, I don't even know where the hell I left off with this code and X files or X files,

57:12.320 --> 57:17.680
Conan X files thing. Now wouldn't that be a game? Conan X files.

57:19.920 --> 57:20.960
David company, man.

57:23.760 --> 57:27.440
By the way, I posted the Virgin killer sweater in chat for you.

57:27.520 --> 57:31.680
Sorry. Dark Tetsuya with the comment of the week. The dogs are out there.

57:35.360 --> 57:39.200
Moving on now quickly. Dark Sakura, bring the mood down.

57:41.120 --> 57:46.640
No, it's not a read on you. I just know I'm fully endorsing the Virgin killer sweaters.

57:46.640 --> 57:51.120
Yes. I, I'm going to look this up and hope that it makes my day as opposed to

57:51.120 --> 57:55.280
what dark version killer sweaters and not just Virgin killer. Cause that's like some

57:55.280 --> 57:58.720
German death metal bat band. Well, German death metal is cool.

57:59.600 --> 58:02.800
Okay. Everyone get ready to cry. Rob. I need to have music. Really.

58:04.240 --> 58:06.960
You should prep. I, this is all the music I have.

58:09.360 --> 58:10.800
It's going to be for every segment.

58:12.400 --> 58:16.080
Um, the last update for mass effect Andromeda.

58:16.080 --> 58:19.680
One point. Wait, I know what we haven't used in a long time. Dark Sakura.

58:25.280 --> 58:34.400
Rick Ashley can team up with the moon fighters and make a new song.

58:34.400 --> 58:38.560
Fuck you Bioware. Fuck you for this. I will never forgive you.

58:38.560 --> 58:40.240
In the name of the moon, I will punish you.

58:44.480 --> 58:50.480
The last update for mass effect Andromeda was the last for single player. There's no more future

58:50.480 --> 58:55.120
patches for single player or in story content. Where are our quarians?

58:55.920 --> 59:00.160
Fuck you. This is all lost in space.

59:01.280 --> 59:06.880
This is all because of that stupid. What the, what the fuck is that game again? Anthem?

59:07.600 --> 59:14.800
No. Well, yes and no. No, this is Twitter's fault. This is Twitter's fault. I blame Twitter.

59:14.800 --> 59:21.200
I placed the blame on Twitter's doorstep. Let's not give Twitter the credit that's due

59:21.280 --> 59:24.640
to the worst company in America. Several years in a row.

59:24.640 --> 59:28.080
EA. Let's not, let's not let them out. There is that too.

59:29.120 --> 59:32.960
Mass effect Andromeda could have been everything that the fans wanted,

59:32.960 --> 59:36.640
but no, they short staffed and short changed it.

59:37.520 --> 59:43.680
So the only party I am holding accountable to this is fucking EA.

59:44.880 --> 59:49.680
I will not be buying Anthem. I will not play Anthem.

59:49.760 --> 59:55.200
I will not look at anything about Anthem on the internet. I don't, it will not exist to me.

59:55.920 --> 01:00:00.720
The last BioWare game I ever anticipate playing is whatever the next Dragon Age one is,

01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:02.960
because I'm supporting franchises. Hello.

01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:12.560
I do feel like this is some sort of like really bad breakup between myself and BioWare.

01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:19.200
And like, if BioWare still wants to be able to like call me to hang out once in a while,

01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:24.160
then BioWare needs to like prove their love for me. Does that make sense Dark Sakura?

01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:28.720
BioWare needs to like right this wrong and Anthem ain't going to do it.

01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:37.120
Now, if they've hired back Casey Hudson to like kind of do this over again and do a Mass Effect

01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:42.080
game that, you know, isn't going to get eaten alive and will be given the time it needs to

01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:46.880
incubate well and so forth and fight EA so that the game will be released when it's fucking good

01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:53.120
and ready and not early like this game came out. Like if that is going to happen, then BioWare can

01:00:53.120 --> 01:01:03.120
still call me once in a while and we can have fun. But as it is blocked. I am not going to buy Anthem

01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:10.240
and I encourage other people not to buy it until we get something worthwhile in Mass Effect.

01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:13.520
And you know, I'm sure there's going to be people, there's definitely going to be people

01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:19.600
they're going to tweet or whatever, you know, say that is irrational. The Anthem is a different game.

01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:26.720
This is irrational. It's because it exists at all. It's one of those things, though, that I go,

01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:32.480
well, now they've got a track record. BioWare showing that they're not interested in supporting

01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:37.680
games past a certain point. So maybe I'll have to think about that when Anthem comes out.

01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:42.080
Is it a fully featured game? Because it's not likely to get much updates in the future,

01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:49.200
like Mass Effect and Dragon Age used to. Yeah. So in Dragon Age, the Inquisition had really good

01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:55.760
support. Yeah, I missed that BioWare. Where did they go? Isn't it a different BioWare team that

01:01:55.760 --> 01:02:02.720
made this? Yeah. Well, they're gone now. That's why I said was. And I was, I didn't the NPD numbers

01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:06.960
for last month come out? I know that's not on the show world tonight, but I swear I saw it.

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:11.360
Because there was a switch that outsold the PlayStation 4 and Xbox. Yes. I realize that's

01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:17.440
a big headline. But if I recall, I was looking at the top 10 games sold list. Mass Effect Andromeda

01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:25.120
was on the top 10 games sold list. It didn't even come out this month. But it's on sale. Okay. But

01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:29.120
my point is, it's still one of the top 10 selling games in America. And that wasn't good enough?

01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:37.920
No. I just don't understand it. Come on, Noel Gustin. Chat says Rob Roberts is the Sarah,

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:43.280
Jessica Parker, and EA is the Mr. Big. Is he making fun of my nose? I think it might be.

01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:47.200
He's making a Jessica Jones reference. No, no, it's not Jessica Jones.

01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:50.080
Sarah Jessica, like Sex and the City. Sex and the City. Mr. Big.

01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:53.280
I don't even fucking watch that. Even I do that.

01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:57.680
I've watched one episode of that show. And it was one where Kate Capshaw's character had a bad

01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:02.560
chemical peel. That's all I remember about it was her chemical peel.

01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:09.040
So ironic. I shouldn't tell the story. I'm just gonna say, years ago before Alan,

01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:16.880
there was a gentleman that I was seeing that would watch that show a lot. And so I kind of

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:23.600
got subjected to that show that way. And ever since, I haven't watched it again. So I think

01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:27.360
it's one of those like, what do they call that? The Pavlov Association type of thing?

01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:32.320
That's what I have with Sex and the City. I see Sex and the City and I think, oh, yeah,

01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:33.680
that guy. That's a show.

01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:39.200
That's a show. All right. Anyway, let's see. DungeonBuster in chat says,

01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:43.040
relegating all of that lore to an expanded universe format just feels as if they're

01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:47.840
trying to pass the buck to a medium they won't have to really deal with. Oh, yes. Thank you.

01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:51.600
That's a good thing to bring up there is that, and DungeonBuster posted this on Discord too.

01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:55.200
And I remember seeing this, is that the Quarians and all this stuff,

01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:59.280
because Dark Star, you asked what about the Quarian. Well, there will be a comic book or

01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:03.760
there is going to be a novel or I don't know, whatever the fuck it is, but let's say a comic

01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:09.920
book. So Dark Soccer, here's the question. Think about this before you answer. If a comic book is

01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:15.920
to come out that says what happened to the Quarians, will you buy it to show support for

01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:21.680
Mass Effect Andromeda or will you say, no, thank you because BioWare has turned your back on you?

01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:24.720
I would buy anything in the Mass Effect franchise, of course.

01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:28.800
Okay. That actually was not the answer I was expecting. So I'm glad I asked.

01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:33.760
No, I was honestly expecting B. I would support the Mass Effect franchise.

01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:37.280
Okay. No, that's great. That's why I asked. I stand corrected.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:45.840
I just won't support Anthem because it's what took resources from the Mass Effect.

01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:50.960
You're not going to support the new Miss America because you're all about the old Miss America,

01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:55.280
I think. That's so terrible. I couldn't think of an analogy at all.

01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:05.680
I will support the franchise that I like. Ooh, here's a good question from Tiger Claw.

01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:11.280
What? Oh, I like that. I like this grill Jamie on her feelings. What if, but they're,

01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:15.840
they're all valid feelings. You all have them too. What if Mass Effect was, thank you,

01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:20.800
Brad from Pod Culture, much better analogy, new doctor versus old doctor. But I think a lot of

01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:24.400
people are really into 13 right now. So I mean, we have to see an episode of the show to really

01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:28.880
know more along the lines of we wrote the story for the DLC, but we don't want to pay

01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:34.560
programmers to make it. So let's release a comic book. Oh, truth bomb. All right. Here's the

01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:39.840
question from Tiger Claw. What if Mass Effect was given to another developer other than BioWare?

01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:50.160
Okay. Hmm. I would say, I would say for me, it would depend on who's the talent behind it.

01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:53.920
Thinking of it to a competent developer. Yeah. Who's doing it. Who's writing it.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:58.800
Who's you know, is, is somebody from the old team still involved? Like who what's what's

01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:01.440
To use the doctor who analogy. Okay.

01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:11.840
It's the same reason why people who only liked the serials will still watch the new doctor who

01:06:11.840 --> 01:06:16.400
it's why people who were completely disgusted with Moffat's writing

01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:22.800
still endured it to watch something that they enjoyed. I hate Steven Moffat's writing and I

01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:29.200
hated every, well, a good portion of the episodes that he wrote, but I kept watching until I was

01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:35.680
just way too sick of it. You know, I'll put it that way. Okay. You know, I, I didn't, you know,

01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:40.000
okay. I'll go back to another thing. I, Jessica Jones has been my favorite comic book character

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:46.960
since her conception in Alias and the Pulse. And I didn't really quite like how she was handled

01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:52.800
during the civil war comics, but I read it anyway. And I picked up secret Avengers that

01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:58.800
she was in because I wanted to read about the character. I've heard crappy X-Men comics because

01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:04.240
I liked X-Men. So I'm just saying. All right. Uh, let's see.

01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:08.400
And this isn't about you, Brad. It's about me. By the way. Come on. You did get, come on. No,

01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:13.680
you got a little yass in chat from, come on, no Gus who says Moffat was garbage. All right. Mama,

01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:20.640
this is garbage. Anyway, moving on. SS2-100 Matt in chat says to play devil's advocate.

01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:25.440
It's not the people who are working on Anthem's fault about what happened to mass effect.

01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:31.440
If the game doesn't sell, they may be cut because of poor sales. Okay. Two, two points to that

01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:36.080
though. I actually will help in disputing this because I'm a little salty on Anthem as well,

01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:43.200
because, well, one, we just talked about the MPD numbers and Andromeda is selling. So, I mean,

01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:47.360
it's selling more than most games. Sale knows. Oh, I mean, maybe it's just not selling. I guess

01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:52.560
what EA had set this expectations was set for it, but here's the thing with Anthem. Yes, it is

01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:58.800
Anthem's fault because this, this mass effect was given to another studio so that the studio that

01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:04.560
was doing mass effect could focus on Anthem. And apparently there was just not enough collaboration.

01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:09.200
There's not enough. And didn't somebody from that team, the mass effect team go to the Anthem team?

01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:14.480
Yeah. So yes, Anthem pulled resources from mass effect. So we're a little salty about it.

01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:23.040
And the one to blame EA. EA. Exactly. So sorry. Anyway, just a little, just a little counterpoint

01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:26.560
on that, but I realized there are going to be some people that are like, Moffat is still a

01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:33.200
misogynist asshole. So whatever. All right, let's move on that note. More, more news, Loki. All

01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:43.360
right. So, uh, we've got Nintendo, of course, um, doing a bundle for Splatoon 2. Yes. I know

01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:49.040
it just came out, but they have a bundle that's coming soon. Um, next few months with some new

01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:54.800
controller colors. Yay. So you can there, it's going to bundle the game along with the switch

01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:59.920
and then a neon green and neon pink, uh, joy cons. And those are going to be coming.

01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:07.600
It looks like, I want to say later this fall, uh, starting September 8th. So just

01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:14.880
a little after the next Splatfest. Bummer that it's exclusive to one store.

01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:22.080
Yep. It's exclusive to Walmart. At least it's not evil G. Still though. And I know people that want

01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:27.600
those joy cons. Heck, one of my friends ordered those joy con, those colors from Japan. So we

01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:33.120
could have them. And we all know who that is, but I mean, seriously, but it's, it's one of

01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:36.240
those things where it's like, it would be nice if they would just release those joy cons in the U.S.

01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:41.840
to anybody. Yeah. It's gonna be $379.99. So you're not really getting much of a discount there, but.

01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:48.640
But let's be real. Splatoon is a great game. That's worth owning a Nintendo switch over.

01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:55.600
I would say it's not a Zelda in terms of a system seller, but they're very different types of games.

01:09:55.600 --> 01:10:00.320
And maybe there's something in Splatoon 2 for you that Zelda doesn't bring you such as competitive.

01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:03.920
Now that I look at that, you know, cause the system itself is like what? $299?

01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:09.920
Yeah. So that's actually more than buying the switch and the game by itself.

01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:13.200
Doesn't it come with something else too? It comes with a carrying case.

01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:18.080
Okay. Cause it comes with a carrying case pro controller or no, no, it doesn't have that amiibo.

01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:23.360
No. Hmm. There's gotta be some it's carrying case or something sweetened in that pot.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:27.120
Yeah. It's just, it's just a cheap ass carrying case that they have with it,

01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:28.720
but you would think that'd be something to do with throw.

01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:35.840
Act F says that case costs 20 to 30. So, so you're paying, it's a GameStop bundle base.

01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:39.600
It's a forced GameStop bundle where you get a case you didn't ask for.

01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:42.400
Whatever. I guess you don't have to buy this version of it.

01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:48.400
All right. Uh, well, uh, yeah, I already have my switch, so this is not something I'm really

01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:52.560
going to pick up, but, uh, you know, I might be into joy cons in different colors, although I

01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:58.720
don't know. The only ones I've really liked are the arms yellow ones. And I'm not even super into

01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:04.320
arms. Like I totally passed on that game, but I liked those arms yellow ones, but I see, I know

01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:08.160
some people are totally against me on this. And this is maybe this will have to be a splat fest

01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:15.200
they do in the future is team gray joy cons versus team color joy cons because the gray ones match

01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:19.840
the rest of the system. And that is important as well to me, but I do like the yellow ones.

01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:25.040
If I was going to get any joy cons, I get those yellow ones. So, all right. Anyhow, uh, let's

01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:30.800
talk about some weird drama involving trophies. That's right on the PlayStation four, because

01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:37.120
the upcoming game life is strange before the storm apparently had a trophy available,

01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:42.480
but it was only available in the bonus episode episode with the more expensive deluxe edition,

01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:47.840
meaning that the platinum trophy, which you get for getting all other trophies unattainable,

01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:54.560
unless you bought the more expensive deluxe edition. Wow. Jerk move Square Enix. Although

01:11:54.560 --> 01:12:00.240
to be fair, it looks like it is truly an oversight and not something that they intended to do because

01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:04.480
they did come out and say it was a mistake. So they, it was not our intention to give the

01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:09.360
platinum trophy via the optional bonus episode in the deluxe edition. And so we started speaking

01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:15.360
to the parties about rectifying this. So my assumption is that I know that a PlayStation

01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:20.240
can do this thing with trophies where that DLC goes into little plus sign things like

01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:25.200
Diablo three just did this because, um, I had a hundred percent in Diablo three and got my

01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:30.320
platinum trophies, but a couple of weeks ago, that a hundred percent dropped down to 85% or

01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:32.720
something like that. And I was like, but I still have my platinum trophy. And I was like,

01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:37.520
what the fuck? Well, it turns out because Diablo three released that necromancer pack.

01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:42.880
They put new trophies in with the necromancer pack. So, but what they do is they do like,

01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:46.480
when you go into the game, then there's like a little plus sign that you can click on for

01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:50.320
the necromancer pack. So you don't need those trophies to get the platinum trophy, but there

01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:55.760
are still more trophies. So I think games with big DLC and expansion packs, they do this little plus

01:12:55.760 --> 01:13:01.120
sign. So maybe my assumption is that's what life is strange is going to do is turn this DLC into

01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:07.280
a plus sign. So it won't be required for, um, that, that platinum trophy anymore. Cause you

01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:13.120
know, some people take that trophy hunting real seriously. And especially in a story based game,

01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:19.120
like life is strange where he, sometimes it's a little easier to get the trophies. Uh, people

01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:25.040
go to those to get their platinum trophies. So anyway, of course you could always just enjoy the

01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:31.440
game for the story or because the decent game, but, uh, I guess I'm talking crazy dark soccer.

01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:39.680
What do you have for us? Tears, angry, angry, salty tears. More? No, not really. Um, there is

01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:46.160
a game that, and I'm, I'm gonna be very terrible because it was suggested to me on tumblr and I'm

01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:52.960
sorry who suggested it. I'm too lazy to go look. So, um, it's a Kickstarter right now for a game

01:13:52.960 --> 01:14:01.840
called Necro cosmos, which is a Metroidvania in space type game. It kind of looks like it does

01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:11.840
blaster mastery things and then has bullet hell things and like power ups and like emo-ness. Um,

01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:16.480
and then you've got different stages or ways you can take through the game and you equip like

01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:22.480
different DNA for your gun that lets you do different effects and stuff. And I was like,

01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:31.760
is this going to be my answer to the guardian legend? Maybe. So, um, I, I, I, I put money on it.

01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:35.280
I admit I put money on it. It is the second thing I put money on a Kickstarter for.

01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:43.840
So the first one, how to pull boyfriend plushies. The second one, this game.

01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:50.160
Wow. So you don't jump in on that stuff very often. Nope. I do have my plushies though.

01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:54.960
Dungeon buster in chat says I played the demo for a Necro cosmos. It's neat,

01:14:54.960 --> 01:15:00.960
but paying to save in the game is just to know for me. So paying to save, I guess it must be

01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:04.800
something. Can you elaborate on that desert buster? Cause I must admit, I don't, I don't

01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:08.960
know much about this game. It adds to the challenge. Oh, is it, uh, is this something

01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:14.880
with like in-game currency or do we mean real money or in-game currency? Because I know my God,

01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:19.760
that would be cruel. Uh, because that Ori and the blind forest, I was just playing. You have

01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:26.080
to use energy to create a safe spot. So I mean, you have to spend a cabin in final fantasy.

01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:33.040
Okay. In game. Oh, interesting. You pay in game currency, but the cost rises with every save.

01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:39.360
It's interesting. Okay. You would think there'd be a mode where you could disable that though,

01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:44.080
but that would be interesting for people that like, you know, like dark souls, it's dark souls

01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:51.120
mode. Okay. All right. Interesting. All right. I'll have to check this out though. I'm a big

01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:56.160
fan of Metroid type games and all that good stuff. So, all right. Uh, just a few more stories

01:15:56.160 --> 01:16:02.800
for you guys than the classic game of the week. Loki. All right. So you may remember that recently

01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:09.360
they had, uh, changed the name of battle net to, what did they change it to? Something else?

01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:13.760
Blizzard launcher, something like that. And everyone thought, what the hell?

01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:18.160
That's kind of stupid battle. It's been, you know, this name that we, it's been synonymous

01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:22.640
for this for the longest time. Why the hell did you change it? You know, it's kind of confusing.

01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:29.440
And so they went ahead and changed it back. So Blizzard made a comment saying we understood that

01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:34.640
battle net stood for something special. It represents years of shared history and enjoyment,

01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:39.760
community, and friendship for all of us and our players. The technology was never going away,

01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:46.000
but after giving the branding change further consideration, we, and also hearing your feedback,

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:51.920
we are in agreement that the name should stay as well, which makes sense because

01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:59.200
just like the new name was super the Blizzard launcher. I don't know. It's branding. Well,

01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:02.880
I think a big part of it too, is that nobody would call it that they were still calling it battle.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:09.360
That's true. Yeah. So some days you belong to your fans and that's what happens with that with

01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:14.640
Blizzard sometimes. So I don't know when I was like, when they were considering changes,

01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:19.920
they ever think like, do we really need to change it? I mean, I don't know why they had some

01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:25.520
branding idea, I guess. I wonder if it wasn't related to destiny to coming into the launcher.

01:17:26.160 --> 01:17:30.160
Maybe they were, they didn't want to call it battle net because of the whole destiny to

01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:36.000
thing. I don't know. I just, I battle in destiny. No you do, but it's Blizzard's baby. I don't know.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:40.000
It's still called the Blizzard launcher. So I don't know. I'm just, it was around the same

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:45.040
time. That's all I'm saying. So it was, could be related. All right. Well, speaking of Blizzard

01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:48.400
games, I think this is kind of neat. This is something new that they've added into Twitch

01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:53.200
and it's specific to a Blizzard game, specifically Overwatch. Although I think Hearthstone is getting

01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:58.160
this as well, but I actually used this on Twitch today and I thought it was neat. So you can go on

01:17:58.160 --> 01:18:02.960
to like, let's say you go onto the Twitch website. Doesn't work on the console versions or the app or

01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:06.800
anything like that yet. But if you go to the website and you actually browse for Overwatch

01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:12.720
streams, it'll actually allow you to filter the streams by what hero they're playing.

01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:18.720
So if you want to see people who play Sombra, cause she's fucking awesome. You can filter for

01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:22.960
Sombra and see people playing Sombra. And even when you're looking at the list, you'll actually

01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:28.080
see a little picture of the hero and it shows you what that person is playing right now. Well,

01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:35.040
how does it do this? Um, apparently, that's right. Dark magic. Um, no, apparently it's

01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:40.800
because of this, uh, technology that was acquired by Twitch called clip mine. Uh,

01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:47.760
clip mine had a deep learning video platform that recognizes in game objects, text and levels,

01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:53.040
which are then selected via the sites filters. So the game kind of knows what hero you've picked

01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:57.440
because it saw it on the hero select screen or it's noticing it in the corner where the hero

01:18:57.440 --> 01:19:00.720
thing is or something like that. So I think that's kind of neat because if you go in and

01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:06.560
you look at Overwatch streams, there's a billion of them. But sometimes, and I even say this, like,

01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:10.560
I'm somebody who really enjoys playing Sombra. There's a reason I named her. I think she's

01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:14.880
really good. She's hated by a lot of, um, Overwatch players because some people kind of

01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:18.160
don't know how to play her. Like they'll just go in there, guns blazing, and that's not really how

01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:21.600
you're supposed to do it. You're supposed to be stealthy, but I've kind of learned more about how

01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:26.720
to play Sombra by watching other people play Sombra. And that's, you know, you can't always,

01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:31.680
unless they put in the title of their stream Sombra competitive mode or something, I don't

01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:34.960
know who they're playing. Well, now that's not gonna be a problem anymore. I can go in and look

01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:39.680
for people playing that hero or maybe another hero I want to get better with that I don't know a lot

01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:46.080
about. So, um, I thought that was kind of neat that you could search by hero. Um, uh, also in

01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:49.840
Hearthstone, I think it's a very similar type of thing because in Hearthstone, you can play as

01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:54.320
different, you know, heroes in Hearthstone and it's a very similar thing. I guess Hearthstone

01:19:54.320 --> 01:20:01.360
will also let you go by game mode, player rank, and number of wins. So you can actually find

01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:05.440
where are the super pro Hearthstone people, or in my case, where are the baddies?

01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:11.040
Does Hearthstone let you see like who the biggest loser is currently streaming? Because that would

01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:17.120
probably be me if I ever did Hearthstone. All right. Anyhow, there you go. Well, before we

01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:23.440
were broadcasting our games, we were taking them over to friends' houses, playing cartridges, or

01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:28.560
maybe even the age of CDs. We're gonna take a step back into the classic game of the week.

01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:34.160
Dark Sakura's gonna open the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks,

01:20:34.160 --> 01:20:40.320
hey, you little brat, come over here. Get off my lawn. Get off my lawn.

01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:44.560
Get off my lawn and use this light gun. Go play this game. Dark Sakura,

01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:49.760
what is the classic game of the week? The House of the Dead, which all I keep

01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:53.760
thinking of is the House of the Dead 2. We're meeting, gee, over there.

01:20:54.560 --> 01:20:56.480
I just think of the typing of the dead. Bad voice acting.

01:20:56.480 --> 01:21:00.480
But that's fine. Well, I couldn't do typing of the dead before I do House of the Dead. Although

01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:03.680
I think I've done typing of the dead. You probably did another episode, yeah.

01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:09.760
Um, anyway, House of the Dead is a first person light gun game that was released by Sega in

01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:16.720
September 13th, 1996. And then that was in Japan and internationally March 4th, 1997.

01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:21.120
We had one at one of the arcades I worked at, briefly.

01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:33.200
But basically, you use your light gun or mouse in the PC version to shoot at zombies and

01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:39.520
monsterseses and things like that. And your life is set by a series of torches and whenever

01:21:40.240 --> 01:21:46.160
you get hit or you shoot a hostage, you lose a torch. And then when all of your torches are gone,

01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:54.320
you lose. You die. You get first aid packs during the game. They're either held by hostages or

01:21:54.320 --> 01:22:00.880
they're just objects. Like, oh, look, look at that little rock. Oh, there's a first aid kit in the

01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:09.840
rock. It's great. So yeah, it's like that. And you have different ways that you can act or not act

01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:19.680
like, um, whether or not you save certain hostages or die or go. Oh, does it have talking?

01:22:19.680 --> 01:22:24.880
Yeah, this video has talking. Fuck these videos that have talking! Fuck, look for House of the

01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:29.360
Dead long play. I'll see what I can find, yeah. I'm sorry, because I just listened to like the

01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:32.160
first few minutes of it. I was like, oh, this is great. Yeah, I didn't have it in the first

01:22:32.160 --> 01:22:36.560
like minute and a half. Motherfucker. See, here's something that we don't have that would be awesome

01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:42.240
with VR nowadays is I want like VR versions of these games. No. Because they're light gun games.

01:22:45.280 --> 01:22:53.360
I found one. Okay, good. Thank you. Um, anyway, you were playing as, uh, an agent named G. Ooh.

01:22:55.120 --> 01:23:03.840
Um, and, uh, Thomas Rogan to go save people because of reasons. Basically, um,

01:23:04.720 --> 01:23:12.240
they're going there to see if they can find out what's going on, um, for, uh, this, uh, biochemist,

01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:17.760
um, who apparently is going crazy because he's obsessed with life and death. And that's the story

01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:28.960
there. Um, it had, uh, a lot of craziness go on, like, fighting, um, this pyrotechnic creature and,

01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:37.200
and, uh, which ends up, like, killing the guy that made it and everything. And then you, uh,

01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:47.200
basically have to go rescue Sophie, who is, uh, someone who is called, um, she's, uh,

01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:53.600
Thomas Rogan's fiance, Sophie Richards. Like, where are they from? Some of these names.

01:23:53.600 --> 01:24:01.120
But, like, spoiler, you get an alternate ending where she becomes a zombie. And then, um, you also

01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:07.600
can leave the house without her. So, I guess. Um, but for all the versions that came out, um,

01:24:08.240 --> 01:24:13.280
of course it was that era of SEGA where we were getting good Saturn games, hopefully.

01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:22.240
So it came out on the Saturn and it came out on the PC. Um, and this game was actually considered

01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:29.520
so obscene in, um, in Indianapolis where they were trying to ban certain video games, violent

01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:34.480
video games. They tried to open a case about this saying that it was not protected under the First

01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:40.880
Amendment because of its obscenity. Um, but basically the ban on the game was considered

01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:46.640
unconstitutional. And, uh, the quote from Judge Posner, who was in charge of the case,

01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:53.120
the most violent game in the record, The House of the Dead, depicts zombies being killed flamboyantly

01:24:53.120 --> 01:25:00.960
with much suffering of limbs and effusion of blood. I love the words of this, but so stylized

01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:06.720
and patently fictitious is the cartoon-like depiction that no one would suppose it obscene

01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:10.880
in the sense in which a photograph of a person being decapitated might be seen as obscene.

01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:15.680
It will not turn anyone's stomach. And I notice this video has, like, the blood color change to

01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:23.760
green as well. Yeah. So anyway, um, there were those other ports. We had the Sega Saturn version

01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:31.520
in 1998 and the Windows PC CD version by Sega. Um, they were kind of rushed and not great,

01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:36.320
but they weren't bad. They're still fun to play. Um, and actually you can run the arcade version

01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:42.240
now in the model 2 emulator. Um, the Sega Saturn version had a remixed soundtrack. Um,

01:25:44.080 --> 01:25:51.840
and, uh, it's just a really good game. And of course later on, wasn't there like a movie?

01:25:53.200 --> 01:26:00.000
Unfortunately. Wasn't there a Rob Zombie movie? Uwe Boll. No, Uwe Boll. No. Oh, I was, no, that was

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:05.280
House of a Thousand Corpses. Yes. Whatever. Not based on a game. Whatever.

01:26:06.400 --> 01:26:11.200
So it had a bunch of suck that came out as a result. But House of the Dead 2 is a great game.

01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:15.360
But then it had Typing of the Dead, which was fucking awesome. Yes, it was. Everything works

01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:20.720
out in the end. And we have an OLR pack. Yes, that's right. Good plug. We need to do a new one.

01:26:20.720 --> 01:26:24.560
We need to update it or something. There is, you know, it should be called, just so you know,

01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:28.720
it's on the Steam marketplace and the Typing of the Dead on the Steam. Uh, we did it for

01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:33.040
episode 600. So it was a while ago. It's time for a new one. But it was, yeah, I think update it for

01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:38.800
episode 700. I think it should be the naughty phrases version, not like this cuss or anything,

01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:45.360
but like you pooted. All right. Or like, I like big butts and I cannot lie or something.

01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:50.560
Well, you can make it Dark Sakura. You don't want me to make it. It'll just be like,

01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:57.440
Rob made me do this. All work and no play, make Dark Sakura dull. All right. Anyway,

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:01.760
we're going to take a break here. Classic Game of the Week, of course, once again,

01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:04.480
the House of the Dead. All right, take a quick break. But when we come back,

01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:08.720
there is more Orange Laundry to come, including several emails this week. Y'all made up for not

01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:12.480
sending any, uh, the past couple of weeks. We're also going to talk about some other updates,

01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:17.680
new PlayStation 4 firmware. So we're talking about that and we got a Konami story, but maybe

01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:20.480
this one will be a little bit different for a change. We'll get to all that when we come

01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:31.680
back with more of Orange Laundry right after this. Welcome back everybody to Orange

01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:38.080
Radio Live tonight with episode number 697 of our show already in progress.

01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:42.720
Talking a little bit about that eclipse tomorrow. And, um, unfortunately I don't get to see it

01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:46.400
because I have daytime work commitments. Dark Sakura, you mentioned when we were doing our,

01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:50.800
um, call with Bobby tonight, uh, you, you have a little time off work to go see the eclipse,

01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:55.440
right? Cause we get to see, we're in like, what did they say? 60%, 80%. We're not going to see

01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:59.200
it all. We're not in that part of the country. It's supposed to show up for us like at 10

01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:06.000
something in the morning. Okay. Um, well, and I normally start my shift like around 10 30.

01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:17.200
So I put in for like 45 minutes so that I could enjoy the view. It is a historical moment of

01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:22.080
sorts, I suppose. Get to work, get coffee, do my job, and then go to the doctor. Go shopping for

01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:29.760
plants. A total eclipse of the sun. I just, I really wish more than anything, I was going to

01:28:29.760 --> 01:28:34.560
be on that boat where Bonnie Tyler is going to sing total eclipse of the heart during the eclipse.

01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:40.640
Because like, look, I don't want to get too much into the fuckery of what's going on in the world

01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:45.040
right now. Cause you all have a TV or an internet. You see like all this like crazy shit going on.

01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:50.080
But like when I saw that story on Twitter come through where it's like, Bonnie Tyler is going

01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:54.640
to sing total eclipse of the heart during the eclipse. I actually, I literally had that moment

01:28:54.640 --> 01:29:02.240
of at least something somewhere is the way it is meant to be. You know what I mean? Like it's the

01:29:02.240 --> 01:29:06.960
only good news I read all fucking week. Uh, Loki, are you doing anything for the eclipse stuff

01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:11.040
tomorrow? I didn't really look at it. I don't have any glasses to see it. I mean, don't look at it

01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:17.680
directly then. That means Loki is doing low key observation. Get out. No, I'll just stare at the

01:29:17.680 --> 01:29:23.200
sun anyways. Cause I don't give a fuck. I'll wear sunglasses. I'll wear two pairs of sunglasses.

01:29:23.200 --> 01:29:26.560
That's not going to be enough. You're going to go blind. You'll shoot your eye out.

01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:30.720
Um, I'm actually, um, use your phone. That's what Jamie was suggesting. Yeah,

01:29:30.720 --> 01:29:35.200
you can use your phone. You just can't use like an actual legit viewfinder because it will still

01:29:35.200 --> 01:29:41.360
magnify and be direct sunlight. But, um, I'm considering getting like, I was trying to look

01:29:41.360 --> 01:29:46.320
for welding goggles and everywhere except for Harbor freight was sold out, but even Harbor

01:29:46.320 --> 01:29:54.080
freight wanted like 30 bucks for, well, for I was just checking online to see where some,

01:29:54.080 --> 01:29:58.080
I'm sure they like the stores around here. Probably like the apartment stores and stuff.

01:29:58.080 --> 01:30:03.360
Everybody sold out air, but everybody's got a piece of paper with like shit on. I mean,

01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:08.000
come on. And they probably cost 10 cents to make and they're selling them for five bucks.

01:30:08.080 --> 01:30:14.640
America. That's just capitalism. Uh, anyway. Yes. I, I'm with tiger claw. I think

01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:20.320
nasa.gov will broadcast the eclipse. I'll just let the professionals handle it and I'll watch

01:30:20.320 --> 01:30:27.360
on the telly on my 4k monitor. I'll watch the clips in 4k when I get home. There you go. I'll

01:30:27.360 --> 01:30:32.000
watch the highlight reel. All right. Anyhow, we got to get into some other gaming news. We're

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:38.080
going to do some rapid fire news. Uh, Loki. All right. So there's a game that was on Kickstarter

01:30:38.080 --> 01:30:43.280
finally made it out to early access on steam. And I think it's out now. I think it's out of

01:30:43.280 --> 01:30:48.240
early access, but we happy few. It's a game that they kind of teased also during the Xbox conference.

01:30:49.040 --> 01:30:54.880
And I think even the PlayStation conference during E3, well, uh, it is going to be coming out now,

01:30:54.880 --> 01:31:01.680
uh, next year in 2018 being published by gearbox on April 13th is when you can expect that we

01:31:01.680 --> 01:31:07.600
happy few. And for those not familiar with it is kind of this weird, um, almost like a Bioshock

01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:13.920
type game set in the, like the sixties in this town where everyone's taking, uh, like these,

01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:19.440
I want to say they're called like joy. It's like a drug to make them forget some tragic thing that

01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:25.440
happened. And apparently you're a person that's not taking joy and they're out to murder you

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:32.720
because you're off your medication and fun. So it's like kind of a survival game, but like,

01:31:32.720 --> 01:31:41.200
it's very, very creepy and British. So check it out. That's coming out next year. Um, of course,

01:31:41.200 --> 01:31:48.720
you know, the, uh, PC version I think is out now, at least in early access. Uh, so you can

01:31:48.720 --> 01:31:55.120
check it out now. I have it still and played it, but, um, so one of the games that's, you know,

01:31:55.120 --> 01:32:00.880
they've been showing off that I'm just not getting into is as Marvel versus Capcom infinite.

01:32:00.880 --> 01:32:05.360
And one of the problems with Marvel versus Capcom infinite was also that some of the player models

01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:10.880
were a little weird looking based on the last trailer. So like one of those characters,

01:32:10.880 --> 01:32:16.640
of course, was, uh, the model for Chung Lee. And it was just that the trailer before last,

01:32:16.640 --> 01:32:20.400
which is all jacked up looking like, it's like, what the fuck did you do to her face?

01:32:20.400 --> 01:32:25.920
Like, it's just all wrong. Um, so everyone's like, oh, this is going to be like a fucking,

01:32:25.920 --> 01:32:30.400
you know, Mass Effect Andromeda situation where it's just all fucked up and rushed.

01:32:31.280 --> 01:32:36.080
Thankfully there has been a new trailer to come out and it looks like they have corrected the

01:32:36.080 --> 01:32:42.800
issue and fixed the model. So wait, wait, wait. Capcom's listening to feedback. I know it's

01:32:42.800 --> 01:32:49.360
crazy. Now is the time to tweet them. Mega man, Mega man, Mega man. So, and then of course,

01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:54.880
I guess Dante was another one that they, um, have kind of fixed as well. So

01:32:55.920 --> 01:33:01.360
Capcom doing plastic surgery on, uh, on your video game. Favorite, you know,

01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:06.240
on all your faves, favorite heroes. Yes. All right. Uh, this next story came from our

01:33:06.240 --> 01:33:10.080
discord, uh, active submitted this on discord and you can submit stories throughout the week

01:33:10.080 --> 01:33:13.840
too, over at our discord, vog, network.com slash discord. Now I'm apparently this is

01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:17.520
something that happened in Mexico where it's where active is from. And, uh, did you know

01:33:17.520 --> 01:33:21.760
office Depot apparently like gives away video games and stuff. I didn't realize this.

01:33:23.200 --> 01:33:28.400
I think what it is is that these, these cards that had overwatch codes on them were meant for

01:33:28.400 --> 01:33:32.640
new computers. I think that's what it was. And, and office Depot certainly sells computers,

01:33:32.640 --> 01:33:36.320
but I just usually they sell office computers that probably can't, well,

01:33:36.320 --> 01:33:40.960
overwatch doesn't take that much. Yeah, yeah. Well, anyway, apparently there was some weird

01:33:40.960 --> 01:33:46.160
type of thing happening where for a little bit anyway, office Depot actually, uh, was

01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:52.160
selling with the purchase of any HP ink cartridge, which, um, went as low as $6,

01:33:53.120 --> 01:33:58.960
you actually got a full game code of overwatch from HP Hewlett Packard and office Depot.

01:33:58.960 --> 01:34:04.560
And I can't play this on this printer. Well, apparently people like totally took advantage

01:34:04.560 --> 01:34:09.120
of that system and got like 20 game keys. There's a picture on Reddit of just like a bag full of

01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:15.440
keys and active confessed when he submitted this on discord that I may have, I may have gotten a

01:34:15.440 --> 01:34:22.240
copy this way. So, uh, some people, uh, taking advantage of a little, little maybe unintended

01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:28.560
loophole there courtesy of a Hewlett Packard and office Depot. So there you go. It does note that

01:34:28.560 --> 01:34:33.760
the original promotion was supposed to be if you bought any computer or printer. So it wasn't

01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:39.200
supposed to be like an HP cartridge. This would be a fucking HP computer. You got it. Whoopsie

01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:44.400
Daisy. All right. Well enjoy. You know what, you know what though, as much as you might be going,

01:34:44.400 --> 01:34:49.440
Oh my God, all this free, you know what, blizzard will still be selling loot boxes. They'll still,

01:34:49.440 --> 01:34:56.400
they still got ways to make money. So don't, don't cry for them too much. All right. Uh, meanwhile,

01:34:56.400 --> 01:35:01.840
it could be that night trap will be coming out to the switch. That's right. Uh, and this was all

01:35:01.840 --> 01:35:07.680
through Twitter because, uh, there was a Twitter sent to a screaming villain. Think of the children.

01:35:07.680 --> 01:35:13.360
I know us asking, how about a Nintendo switch physical version? And the response is I'd love

01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:20.800
to get it on switch and really want to, but they declined, uh, to which response, uh, please DM me

01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:26.080
an email address. Someone will contact you. And, uh, that was somebody, I guess, from inside

01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:32.080
Nintendo or something that, uh, wanted to, uh, do that. So, uh, it could be that night trap will

01:35:32.080 --> 01:35:36.800
come out on the switch after all, thanks to, I guess, a missed connection on Twitter or something

01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:40.800
like that. Um, but I'm going to say something that's not going to make me popular with some

01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:46.080
people and that's okay. I can handle it. Um, night trap is really fucking overrated. Like,

01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:50.880
I don't know why all of a sudden this game is back in a bit while I do. It's the 25th anniversary,

01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:56.320
but I just, it's, I think it's okay if it doesn't come out on the switch. It's all right. I'll live

01:35:56.320 --> 01:36:02.320
my life. Think about the possibilities here. As we were talking about earlier, show girls and

01:36:02.320 --> 01:36:08.480
the really shitty drawn Ms paint, you know, bras and panties. Oh God, here we go. What if, what if

01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:16.560
you tap your amiibo on there and you have really shitty drawn, you know, Mario and you know,

01:36:16.560 --> 01:36:22.080
inklings and Zelda, you can have the fucking master sword in that game drawn in all its Ms

01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:27.280
paint glory. Thanks to Nintendo switch. Can't do that. Ain't fucking other console. I'll tell you

01:36:27.280 --> 01:36:36.960
what. Well, Loki, I got one thing to say about that game of the year. So I'm buying 10. I'll

01:36:36.960 --> 01:36:43.200
go to office Depot to get night trap on switch. Jamie, what do you have for us tonight?

01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:48.160
Just the sadness that I realized that there was a sequel to show girls about penny.

01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:54.960
Yes, but she completely funded that herself. And I know this because that actress, I thought you

01:36:54.960 --> 01:36:59.760
were there that year. Weren't you there the year that penny was at the annual show girls screening

01:36:59.760 --> 01:37:05.360
in the Castro. And she was pushing the sequel because, uh, she like financed it, started it,

01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:10.480
produced it because when you're her, that's like the one famous thing you ever did was be in show

01:37:10.480 --> 01:37:17.520
girls. So she has to milk it for all it's worth pool thrashing, because that's really, that's

01:37:17.520 --> 01:37:23.600
going to be the decider. I must confess as I've seen the original show girls movie like 50 times.

01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:28.480
And many of those with Jamie, by the way, I have never bothered to watch pennies from heaven.

01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:34.800
Apparently parts of this, parts of the movie parodies, the original

01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:40.480
and it's actually, um, some people say it's actually a decent movie.

01:37:40.480 --> 01:37:44.800
It can be full on jaws at that point. I'll, I'll watch it. I'm seeing, I'm seeing in

01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:49.760
chat over at live.com. Slidekick says, have we, how have we not had a show girls to party? Anyway,

01:37:49.760 --> 01:37:55.120
you don't know. It's a reason. Okay. Now it's like it going to a Facebook post that nobody

01:37:55.120 --> 01:37:58.720
else has seen besides you and I, uh, and maybe some other mutual friends of ours.

01:37:58.720 --> 01:38:01.120
Now we have a reason for the Hello Kitty ice cream cake.

01:38:02.640 --> 01:38:08.080
Pennies from heaven and Hello Kitty ice cream cake game buoy cross O L R. We're

01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:16.080
going to make it happen. All right. Anyway, is it time for my news? Yes, it is. Okay.

01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:24.080
So there are going to be, um, some, uh, uh, KOF stuff happening. We like King of Fighters,

01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:31.600
King of Fighters 14. Wait, 14 already came out, didn't it? Yeah. Apparently there's going to be

01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:37.520
some updates and then there's talk about King of Fighters 15 on the horizon.

01:38:38.240 --> 01:38:41.520
This series that would never die. Dude, I like King of Fighters. Well,

01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:44.960
I remember when the first one came out, I was like, Oh my God,

01:38:44.960 --> 01:38:52.560
it actually is fatal fury characters and it doesn't suck. Um, also discord. I now have a new

01:38:52.560 --> 01:38:58.320
bit of like for discord. You know why, you know, you finally joined the vog network discord. No,

01:38:58.320 --> 01:39:06.880
I haven't actually button girl because there are banning Nazis. I'm not going to call them the

01:39:06.880 --> 01:39:14.080
fucking outright. I'm going to fucking call them Nazis. They're getting banned, no longer supported.

01:39:14.080 --> 01:39:20.480
Just remember they're Nazis. The old, right. They're not see the old, right.

01:39:20.480 --> 01:39:26.800
I, I, yeah. All right. That's, that's fine. They're terrible people. Yes. They suck at

01:39:26.800 --> 01:39:33.760
being humans. Yes. They should not exist. They should. You remember that something hard and

01:39:33.760 --> 01:39:37.520
sandpapery. Yes. They should take that thing, grind it up, put it in liquid nitrogen and

01:39:37.520 --> 01:39:43.760
shove it down their throats. So anyway, discord. Yes. Yes. Um, discord has been great for Pokemon

01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:48.560
go rating sometimes and discord. It's not discord's fault when it's not, it's the people

01:39:49.200 --> 01:39:56.720
and discord has said, fuck you. We're not hosting you piss off, right? Because yes, yes, there is.

01:39:56.720 --> 01:40:01.040
There is freedom of speech in the constitution. However, freedom of speech is not freedom from

01:40:01.040 --> 01:40:05.120
consequence and discord is a privately owned company and can do whatever. On top of that,

01:40:05.120 --> 01:40:13.360
the freedom of speech only has to deal with government, uh, retaliation for things said

01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:17.520
about the government. That the freedom of speech is what allows me to say

01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:21.760
president Trump is a douche. It allows me to say that and I will not get arrested for saying that.

01:40:21.760 --> 01:40:26.320
Thank you our service men and women who protect that right for me to be able to do that. However,

01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:31.040
if you decide that, wow, Rob Roberts, he's kind of a dick and I don't want to work with him because

01:40:31.040 --> 01:40:35.680
he just called president Trump a douche. If you want to do that, you have the right. That's not,

01:40:35.680 --> 01:40:39.280
that has nothing to do with freedom of speech. The constitution says nothing about that.

01:40:39.280 --> 01:40:44.880
That is consequence. I just, I don't get arrested for saying, and just because you are suffering

01:40:44.880 --> 01:40:50.640
the consequences doesn't mean people are fucking oppressing you. All right. Mom.

01:40:50.640 --> 01:40:55.760
Guys, you know, in chat says what's a discord. It is a, it's, it's kind of what I feel right now.

01:40:57.680 --> 01:41:02.240
It's what you feel in your heart. It's a chat app that's gained a lot of steam. I feel like in the

01:41:02.240 --> 01:41:08.800
past like six months. Um, because it is, it's, it's, if you know of Slack, well, I guess honestly,

01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:12.720
the easiest way for me to say it, it's a modern day IRC, which I know is ironic because our chat

01:41:12.720 --> 01:41:18.320
room that you guys are using right now is in IRC, but there's a reason why it's old timey.

01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:23.360
I know there's a, we're all old, everybody behind VOG networks pushing 40 in one way or another.

01:41:24.080 --> 01:41:30.400
So there's that. And, uh, you know, just the fact that, you know, IRC works if it ain't broke,

01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:33.360
don't fix it, that whole sort of thing. But discord, you're explaining it because it is

01:41:33.360 --> 01:41:37.920
kind of a newer version of that, a modern version of that, but it has integrated voice chat.

01:41:37.920 --> 01:41:42.560
And the thing that I really like about it is that it's on the web and it's on your mobile phone.

01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:47.680
Same, same across both sides. And that includes the voice chat, which apparently soon is going

01:41:47.680 --> 01:41:51.920
to be video chat, which is going to be another big thing. Um, so it's been huge for organizing

01:41:51.920 --> 01:41:57.520
raids and Pokemon go. And another place where discord is finding a lot of success right now,

01:41:57.520 --> 01:42:03.520
Nintendo games, since Nintendo has kind of, you know, let's, let's be real. They dropped

01:42:03.520 --> 01:42:07.920
the fucking ball on the splatoon thing. And I don't think anybody is hardly using the official

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:13.280
app. People are using discord to arrange matches and then chat during said matches, because,

01:42:13.280 --> 01:42:17.120
you know, you can switch to another app and not lose the discord voice chat.

01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:23.280
So that's one place I think discord has been gaining a lot. I think thanks to Pokemon go,

01:42:23.280 --> 01:42:27.840
thanks to Nintendo, thanks to, you know, certain other gaming things, uh, it's been gaining a lot

01:42:27.840 --> 01:42:32.480
in the gaming community and you'll probably find out about it sooner rather than later. And again,

01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:38.480
I'm going to kind of say, if you're not on the VOG network discord, what a perfect opportunity

01:42:38.480 --> 01:42:42.880
for you to check it out. And I think it is available in a web-based client too. If you're

01:42:42.880 --> 01:42:48.160
like, I don't want to download, I don't want to do all that stuff. You then I think they just

01:42:48.160 --> 01:42:53.120
rolled out a web-based thing, so you don't even have to do that. So, um, you have options. There

01:42:53.120 --> 01:42:58.320
you go. So, all right. Yeah. SGL 100 Matt says I'm a big fan of Slack, but discord fits better

01:42:58.320 --> 01:43:03.440
with VOG. Yeah. I like Slack too, but you know, what's awesome about discord. It's free and slack

01:43:03.440 --> 01:43:08.720
it slack has a free version, but there's limitations. Uh, we use, when I was, um,

01:43:08.720 --> 01:43:13.120
increasing a lot more, we Slack for that. And, um, it's limited. Like once you get to 10,000

01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:16.800
messages, which believe it or not, you can hit that a lot sooner than you think on your server,

01:43:16.800 --> 01:43:20.880
like you start losing it. And we were having a lot of problems with space because people were

01:43:20.880 --> 01:43:24.960
uploading pictures, a lot of pictures, which, you know, you want to share pictures and all

01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:31.040
that stuff. Right. Uh, but we were like filling up that the Slack server, so it, it can be

01:43:31.040 --> 01:43:36.960
irritating. So, and Bobby Black Wolf says I use Slack for work. I don't want to use Slack for my

01:43:36.960 --> 01:43:43.120
fun stuff too. Well said. All right. Uh, let's move on. Let's travel around the world and check

01:43:43.120 --> 01:43:49.120
out what is in stores being released this week. Loki. All right. Um, so we do have some stuff

01:43:49.120 --> 01:43:56.320
coming out this week. Uh, we've got starting off with, um, chroma gun on PlayStation four, uh,

01:43:56.320 --> 01:44:03.680
mages of miss Australia on PlayStation four, uh, Minecraft story mode on Nintendo switch,

01:44:04.400 --> 01:44:12.160
the escapists two on PC, PlayStation four and Xbox one uncharted lost legacy on PlayStation four,

01:44:12.880 --> 01:44:20.080
a white day, a labyrinth named school on PC and PlayStation four, and then a lost child

01:44:20.080 --> 01:44:28.800
on PlayStation four and Vita. And then finally we've got, let's see at F1 2017 PC PlayStation

01:44:28.800 --> 01:44:38.560
four, Xbox one Madden NFL 18 on PlayStation four and Xbox one. And let's see Naruto Shippuden

01:44:38.560 --> 01:44:45.440
ultimate ninja storm legacy on PC, PlayStation four and Xbox one. And last but not least one

01:44:45.440 --> 01:44:51.040
piece unlimited world red deluxe edition on PC and PlayStation four. That is it.

01:44:51.760 --> 01:44:55.600
Let's travel to Japan and check out some of the releases there. Uh, in Japan this week,

01:44:55.600 --> 01:45:00.880
a game called Shin Yoma Wari from Nippon Ichi is coming out this week. That's available in two

01:45:00.880 --> 01:45:06.800
additions in Japan. Uh, also coming out this week from compile heart Shin Jigen game Neptune

01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:12.080
Veer victory to realize is out this week. That is also a PlayStation VR game. So you can check

01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:17.360
that out. Uh, and then there's a few other games too. The lost child is out in Japan this week,

01:45:17.360 --> 01:45:23.760
as well as white day, a labyrinth named school. Yes. Sometimes school felt like elaborate to me.

01:45:23.760 --> 01:45:28.000
This game looks like it might be more like a horror game. Yeah. It's a first person

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:32.720
Korean survival horror considered by many be the scariest game in history. Ooh,

01:45:32.720 --> 01:45:36.000
I did not. Do you know this game? I don't know this game. White day,

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:40.400
a labyrinth named school. Apparently some cult classic first person Korean horror game

01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:46.560
that's being remastered here this week. Oh, neat. It was on my list. Cool. All right. Maybe that's

01:45:46.560 --> 01:45:50.720
something I'll have to ask my horror game fans about. See if that's something to know. Uh, yeah.

01:45:50.720 --> 01:45:57.040
MXC says it first came out in 2001. So that's okay. This is a very old game getting an update

01:45:57.040 --> 01:46:01.440
there. So that's neat. Uh, MXC says it's the remake coming to PS4 and PC. Well, that's cool.

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:07.600
All right. Uh, the Vita still has releases in Japan. And this week we have Futagosa no paradox,

01:46:07.600 --> 01:46:12.000
starry sky autumn stories, as well as the lost child is there as well. And

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:19.280
Shim Yomawari is out on the Vita as well on the Nintendo switch. It has a release this week. Yes,

01:46:19.280 --> 01:46:25.040
it does. One piece unlimited world. Our deluxe edition from Bandai Namco is out this week and,

01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:31.040
uh, kind of a big deal monster Hunter double X. The Nintendo switch version is out from Capcom

01:46:31.040 --> 01:46:38.240
on August the 25th, a day later. So check that out. Uh, looking at the 3DS, uh, nothing new on

01:46:38.240 --> 01:46:42.640
the 3DS this week. And that's probably because of monster Hunter kind of monopolizing the Nintendo

01:46:42.640 --> 01:46:50.880
releases this week. All right. Let's move on to the UK dark Sakura. We have on the 21st thimbleweed

01:46:50.880 --> 01:46:59.040
park, um, for PlayStation four on the 23rd bleed for the Sony devices, um, being the PS4 pro and

01:46:59.040 --> 01:47:06.640
the PS4 on the 24th, we have bleed for the X-Box systems, um, cook serve delicious two for PC

01:47:07.600 --> 01:47:17.200
path of exile for X-Box one Minecraft story mode for switch on the 25th. We have F1 2017 on a bunch

01:47:17.200 --> 01:47:26.880
of stuff and Madden NFL 18, blah, blah, blah, blah, nothing, nothing to get too excited about

01:47:26.880 --> 01:47:34.000
this week. She's turned into the parents on the Charlie Brown Thanksgiving special. All right,

01:47:34.640 --> 01:47:39.040
let's get to the mailbag and listen to your what, what was, but we'd love to hear your what,

01:47:39.040 --> 01:47:43.040
what was, so we're going to hear them now participate at orange launch radio.com

01:47:43.600 --> 01:47:47.840
is the place to send your emails. Oh, but before we get to emails, I have a couple of

01:47:47.840 --> 01:47:52.560
quick things I need to say. So I got an email that we're not going to read tonight because I

01:47:52.560 --> 01:47:56.720
think it was a personal email. I'm not sure it was meant for air, but thank you for that

01:47:57.600 --> 01:48:02.960
actually responded personally to that person and, uh, said what I want to say. Um, however,

01:48:02.960 --> 01:48:07.200
that email made me realize, cause they said, I tried to contact you through the website and I

01:48:07.200 --> 01:48:10.640
was like, what do you mean? You tried to wait a minute. And I was like, it's not fog network.

01:48:10.640 --> 01:48:14.800
That one works. Oh shit. It's the orange on radio site. And I went on, I looked,

01:48:14.800 --> 01:48:20.720
Oh my God, the contact us forum on the orange on radio website was sending everything to mailbag

01:48:20.720 --> 01:48:24.880
the old address. So for how long has it been since we switched like two years ago?

01:48:24.880 --> 01:48:29.200
How long has it been since I've kept his website? Yeah, well that's another issue.

01:48:29.200 --> 01:48:34.160
And how many emails do we miss again? Again, I would really love to update the website,

01:48:34.160 --> 01:48:39.440
but that's time and money that I don't have. So I'm, I'm looking at dark soccer going, please.

01:48:39.440 --> 01:48:42.720
So hopefully that's something that can be worked on. But anyway, besides that,

01:48:42.720 --> 01:48:48.400
so yeah, we had stuff going back to, cause there is a log in there. We had like at least over the

01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:55.200
past year, there's like 20 things we missed. So I just want to give a big shit. I'm sorry.

01:48:55.200 --> 01:48:59.520
May I call like, sorry, you guys, I did not mean to overlook all those things that you guys are

01:48:59.520 --> 01:49:05.120
submitting through the website. It was an honest mistake. And I felt really fucking stupid when I

01:49:05.120 --> 01:49:12.000
saw that, but it took this long for somebody to tell me about it. So I guess you weren't that

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:15.760
upset that we weren't reading your emails that you submitted on the website or you figured it out

01:49:15.840 --> 01:49:19.360
and just send them to ParticipateAtOrangeLoungeRadio.com. For what it's worth,

01:49:19.920 --> 01:49:23.760
I fixed the website. So if you do do that in the future, it'll be fine.

01:49:23.760 --> 01:49:24.800
You said doo doo.

01:49:25.600 --> 01:49:31.040
However, I would just encourage you to use your favorite emailing application, such as Gmail,

01:49:31.040 --> 01:49:38.000
Yahoo, whatever it is you use and just email ParticipateAtOrangeLoungeRadio.com. So there it

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:45.040
is. Now back to your regularly scheduled emails. Oh balls, where am I?

01:49:46.320 --> 01:49:47.280
We have like four emails.

01:49:48.880 --> 01:49:49.840
Yes. Make her work.

01:49:50.720 --> 01:49:53.920
No, I have throat problems. Hello, LR.

01:49:55.040 --> 01:49:55.600
What?

01:49:55.600 --> 01:49:58.800
I was going to make a joke and then I said, no, don't be crass.

01:49:58.800 --> 01:50:01.920
Keep it, keep it classy here at OLR. I'm keeping it classy.

01:50:03.760 --> 01:50:06.240
Read the email, please.

01:50:06.240 --> 01:50:12.240
Girl, I realize that I'm being at least as predictable as a poorly written CBS primetime

01:50:12.240 --> 01:50:16.880
procedural. But when you mentioned the Xbox Live Creators Collection last week,

01:50:16.880 --> 01:50:20.400
certainly you knew that like clockwork and email from YYYR would show up.

01:50:20.400 --> 01:50:21.200
Hi, YYYR.

01:50:22.320 --> 01:50:27.520
He's also the only one who does Hello, LR. When you mentioned it on the last show,

01:50:27.520 --> 01:50:30.720
it came across like an announcement for something coming soon. Actually,

01:50:30.720 --> 01:50:33.360
the program has already launched. Exclamation point.

01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:36.080
I actually didn't realize that. That's neat.

01:50:36.080 --> 01:50:41.440
You can browse and buy Creators Collection games on your Xbox One right now. In fact,

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:45.680
he uses double spaces. I just realized that.

01:50:45.680 --> 01:50:46.720
Are you okay?

01:50:46.720 --> 01:50:51.360
Well, no, it's just they're not required anymore for electronic thing. It's a leftover from

01:50:51.360 --> 01:50:55.760
typewriting. So it makes me think that YYYR might have taken typewriting in high school.

01:50:56.480 --> 01:50:58.160
And that will be the email we'll get next week.

01:50:58.800 --> 01:50:59.300
Yes.

01:50:59.840 --> 01:51:00.400
Did Mavis Beacon-

01:51:00.400 --> 01:51:01.280
You can tell.

01:51:01.280 --> 01:51:03.040
Did Mavis Beacon teach you how to type?

01:51:03.920 --> 01:51:08.960
You can tell. There are tells. In fact, the only reason I'm not in the process of releasing

01:51:08.960 --> 01:51:13.680
one at this very moment is because as you're reading this, I'm on a very large boat sailing

01:51:13.680 --> 01:51:16.800
in the general direction of Alaska. Is that bad timing or what?

01:51:16.800 --> 01:51:20.000
Are you on that fucking cruise where Bonnie Tyler is going to sing? Because if so,

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.320
I'm so jealous. I'm so jealous.

01:51:23.280 --> 01:51:26.720
You will, however, see a couple of my titles up there very soon.

01:51:26.720 --> 01:51:32.800
The first two will be Falling Plus and Pixel Poops. Yes, you will soon be able to experience

01:51:32.800 --> 01:51:36.080
Pixel Poops and stunning 4K.

01:51:36.080 --> 01:51:36.880
Yes.

01:51:36.880 --> 01:51:37.760
Or something like that.

01:51:39.280 --> 01:51:42.880
The game simulates a resolution of about 12 by nothing anyway.

01:51:44.640 --> 01:51:47.920
Even better, I plan to release it such that you can play it for free

01:51:47.920 --> 01:51:51.840
and pay 99 cents only if you want to, which seems to be an option in the store.

01:51:51.840 --> 01:51:54.720
99 cents every time you have to go to Taco Bell. I mean,

01:51:54.720 --> 01:51:56.000
taco restaurant.

01:51:56.640 --> 01:51:58.640
Whatever he called it in the game, yeah.

01:51:58.640 --> 01:51:59.840
Could call it Toxic Hell.

01:52:00.640 --> 01:52:01.760
Burrito Horn.

01:52:01.760 --> 01:52:02.320
But I didn't-

01:52:02.320 --> 01:52:04.880
Burrito- I like it. Burrito Horn.

01:52:05.840 --> 01:52:10.640
Uh, I really like though that it allows you to do this where it's like you get it for free,

01:52:10.640 --> 01:52:11.600
but pay if you want.

01:52:11.600 --> 01:52:12.720
Chimichanga, cowbell.

01:52:14.080 --> 01:52:14.640
Moving on.

01:52:16.480 --> 01:52:20.480
Oh, and Bobby Blackwolf says Bonnie Tyler's cruise is on the East Coast,

01:52:20.480 --> 01:52:24.000
so YYR lives to see another day. However, if he is on the boat tomorrow,

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:27.520
that means he's going to be out there when the eclipse happens. That's pretty fucking rad.

01:52:27.520 --> 01:52:29.680
So, pictures or it didn't happen.

01:52:31.760 --> 01:52:33.520
Sorry, am I boring you, Dark Sakura?

01:52:33.520 --> 01:52:36.320
No, I- I got four hours of sleep last night.

01:52:36.320 --> 01:52:37.200
I understand. All right.

01:52:37.200 --> 01:52:40.560
It was terrible because I'd listen to Dan Snore the whole time.

01:52:41.200 --> 01:52:42.240
I don't know what that's like.

01:52:44.320 --> 01:52:47.360
One of the- I just- I just punch him and he stops for like five seconds.

01:52:48.160 --> 01:52:51.920
One of the really cool things about the Creator's Collection is that you can use many different

01:52:51.920 --> 01:52:56.640
popular frameworks to produce your games, such as Mono Game, the free and open source version of

01:52:56.640 --> 01:52:59.760
XNA, the popular Unity, and several others.

01:52:59.760 --> 01:53:02.000
I didn't hear you say ZZT, so I don't know.

01:53:02.880 --> 01:53:05.920
Seriously, people will check it out. That means you two Loki, eventually.

01:53:07.120 --> 01:53:13.280
I just- as soon as my brain decides to cooperate with whatever other part of my brain is saying,

01:53:13.280 --> 01:53:17.040
goddamn it, program something, then yeah, we'll be on board.

01:53:17.040 --> 01:53:22.480
But apparently I have a brain separation where it's like, no, I want to watch YouTube.

01:53:23.760 --> 01:53:27.120
And that's just not happening. It's like my wife is in my brain.

01:53:27.120 --> 01:53:30.880
You may continue.

01:53:33.440 --> 01:53:33.920
Are you sure?

01:53:34.480 --> 01:53:35.280
I think so.

01:53:36.480 --> 01:53:38.400
Loki is not allowed to interrupt you.

01:53:38.400 --> 01:53:39.120
Now you did it!

01:53:39.760 --> 01:53:42.240
Loki is not allowed to interrupt you. I can do it whenever I want.

01:53:42.240 --> 01:53:42.560
Bitch.

01:53:42.560 --> 01:53:45.120
Loki is not allowed to interrupt you until he programs something.

01:53:45.120 --> 01:53:46.800
For every line of code, he may interrupt.

01:53:46.800 --> 01:53:47.280
All right, anyway.

01:53:48.160 --> 01:53:48.480
All right.

01:53:48.480 --> 01:53:50.160
Quiet! All right, go ahead.

01:53:50.160 --> 01:53:51.680
I'll end with two quick things.

01:53:51.680 --> 01:53:54.560
One, if you enjoyed Sonic 3 & Knuckles back in the day,

01:53:54.560 --> 01:53:56.640
and yet are on the fence about buying Sonic Mania,

01:53:56.720 --> 01:53:58.320
you seriously should just buy it.

01:53:58.320 --> 01:54:01.360
It's essentially the direct sequel to Sonic 3 & Knuckles.

01:54:01.360 --> 01:54:04.880
I'm not going to say, if you like Sonic on Genesis, you will love Mania,

01:54:04.880 --> 01:54:09.280
but the three numbered Sonic games on Genesis all played a little bit differently,

01:54:09.280 --> 01:54:11.200
and everyone has their favorites.

01:54:11.200 --> 01:54:14.000
But if you liked Sonic 3 & Knuckles, you will love Mania.

01:54:14.560 --> 01:54:16.080
That I can say with certainty.

01:54:16.080 --> 01:54:19.360
Drop the 20 bucks, put on your red shoes, and get running.

01:54:19.360 --> 01:54:20.080
Agree.

01:54:20.080 --> 01:54:24.080
Thing number two, and that is for Rob, if they have internet where you're-

01:54:24.160 --> 01:54:28.960
Oh, well, thing number two, and that is-

01:54:28.960 --> 01:54:30.400
I don't know if I should read this part.

01:54:31.600 --> 01:54:32.160
Go ahead.

01:54:32.160 --> 01:54:32.660
Okay.

01:54:33.440 --> 01:54:33.920
Is it-

01:54:33.920 --> 01:54:35.600
Does it have to do with last week's intro?

01:54:35.600 --> 01:54:36.080
Yeah.

01:54:36.080 --> 01:54:36.400
Let's-

01:54:36.400 --> 01:54:36.720
Go ahead.

01:54:36.720 --> 01:54:37.040
It's fine.

01:54:37.040 --> 01:54:37.600
I can handle it.

01:54:37.600 --> 01:54:38.320
Okay.

01:54:38.320 --> 01:54:40.240
Thing number two, and this is for Rob,

01:54:40.240 --> 01:54:42.080
if they have internet where your mom is,

01:54:42.080 --> 01:54:44.640
I can personally guarantee that she loved the intro.

01:54:44.640 --> 01:54:45.680
I did too.

01:54:45.680 --> 01:54:48.800
And I hope to see your smile in New York area at some point next year.

01:54:48.800 --> 01:54:49.360
Take your time.

01:54:50.400 --> 01:54:51.040
Thank you for that.

01:54:51.040 --> 01:54:51.920
I appreciate it.

01:54:51.920 --> 01:54:57.040
Hugs, Aaron YYR, with a big legal disclaimer at the end.

01:54:57.040 --> 01:54:58.720
He's sent from a work address.

01:54:58.720 --> 01:54:59.840
I ain't reading that.

01:54:59.840 --> 01:55:00.800
Sent from a work address.

01:55:01.520 --> 01:55:03.280
What are you doing emailing people from work, dude?

01:55:03.840 --> 01:55:07.920
Come on, Noel Gustin Chat says Dark Sakura's sass meter is going up and up.

01:55:07.920 --> 01:55:13.840
Well, she wants to finish her damn emails so she can get back to Facebook or whatever it's alt-tabbed on.

01:55:13.840 --> 01:55:14.560
Seriously.

01:55:15.760 --> 01:55:18.320
You know what's great about being a woman right now?

01:55:18.320 --> 01:55:22.080
I can put the mic on my boobs and I don't have to use my hands.

01:55:22.080 --> 01:55:23.200
I can do that too.

01:55:23.200 --> 01:55:23.600
Oh, wait.

01:55:23.600 --> 01:55:24.560
I shouldn't brag about that.

01:55:26.960 --> 01:55:30.720
Remember that time I put a beer in my shirt and it exploded in my face?

01:55:31.600 --> 01:55:32.480
That wasn't a man.

01:55:33.200 --> 01:55:36.480
Apparently we're all sharing stories we shouldn't be tonight on OLR.

01:55:36.480 --> 01:55:38.800
That was funny because I was really drunk.

01:55:38.800 --> 01:55:42.800
It was at Amanda and Tom's wedding.

01:55:42.800 --> 01:55:48.560
Anyway, I'm just feeling like reminiscing.

01:55:51.120 --> 01:55:51.840
Next email.

01:55:52.480 --> 01:55:53.520
I was trying to.

01:55:55.840 --> 01:55:56.080
Fuck.

01:55:58.400 --> 01:56:02.400
I should have had this ready for your return, but last month or so Level 5 released a new

01:56:02.400 --> 01:56:04.080
Professor Layton game for mobile.

01:56:04.080 --> 01:56:07.920
It's $16 price point would be irresistible for a 3DS game.

01:56:07.920 --> 01:56:11.280
I do not currently have a 3DS, but I've yet to pick it up myself.

01:56:11.280 --> 01:56:15.440
I did, however, redownload their last title Layton Brothers Mysterious Room.

01:56:15.440 --> 01:56:20.960
It's been over four years since I played that on my fourth gen iPod touch, and so I had

01:56:20.960 --> 01:56:23.600
fortunately forgotten most of the plot points.

01:56:23.600 --> 01:56:28.400
It plays more like a Phoenix Wright game than a Layton game, a Professor Layton game, which

01:56:28.400 --> 01:56:30.080
isn't really that bad a thing.

01:56:30.080 --> 01:56:34.400
Each of the cases, save for case zero, which serves only to set the scene of the game,

01:56:34.400 --> 01:56:39.920
involves examining a reconstruction of a murder scene to find clues used to find inconsistencies

01:56:39.920 --> 01:56:41.440
in suspect statements.

01:56:41.440 --> 01:56:44.800
All in all, a pretty engaging title, lasting about ten hours.

01:56:44.800 --> 01:56:49.120
I have seen footage of Layton's mysterious journey, which has full animation and voice

01:56:49.120 --> 01:56:51.200
acting, which Mystery Room does not.

01:56:51.200 --> 01:56:58.080
I'd give Room around four out of five, and will probably purchase Journey sooner rather

01:56:58.080 --> 01:56:58.800
than later.

01:56:58.800 --> 01:56:59.360
Robert M.

01:56:59.920 --> 01:57:00.400
P.S.

01:57:00.400 --> 01:57:06.720
As a hopelessly geeky pun, how did Bob Marley mod his computer games?

01:57:06.720 --> 01:57:08.160
He edited the INI file.

01:57:09.920 --> 01:57:11.760
Okay.

01:57:11.760 --> 01:57:14.960
Boy, you're all a bunch of comics tonight here at OLR, aren't you?

01:57:16.320 --> 01:57:18.560
Anyway, thank you for that brief review.

01:57:18.560 --> 01:57:24.880
Uh, we have another one from Y-Y-R, doo doo doo doo doo doo.

01:57:26.320 --> 01:57:27.360
Hello, LR, again.

01:57:28.160 --> 01:57:29.200
Thank you, again.

01:57:30.080 --> 01:57:34.320
I listened to the end of last week's show after sending my email, and then heard you

01:57:34.320 --> 01:57:37.040
mention Tempest 4000, so here's another one.

01:57:37.120 --> 01:57:43.520
You may recall a Jeff Minter game that came out for Vita called TXK.

01:57:43.520 --> 01:57:44.800
Yes, I have it.

01:57:44.800 --> 01:57:46.000
It's so good.

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:47.920
It was basically New Tempest.

01:57:47.920 --> 01:57:54.000
Then you may recall that he was working on a PS4 and VR versions of TXK, and that Atari

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:57.440
sent Jeff a cease and desist letter before it could be re-released.

01:57:57.440 --> 01:58:01.760
There's strong evidence, including recent tweets from Minter himself, to suggest that

01:58:01.760 --> 01:58:04.400
Tempest 4000 is just a rebranded TXK.

01:58:04.400 --> 01:58:05.520
So they kissed him ate up.

01:58:06.320 --> 01:58:08.080
Perhaps with some slight modifications.

01:58:08.080 --> 01:58:09.520
Not that this is bad news.

01:58:09.520 --> 01:58:10.880
TXK is fantastic.

01:58:10.880 --> 01:58:11.680
Yes, it is.

01:58:12.240 --> 01:58:16.720
So if you want to know how the New Tempest is going to look, it's going to play, etc.,

01:58:16.720 --> 01:58:18.160
then just play TXK.

01:58:19.120 --> 01:58:21.040
And when it comes out, you should buy it.

01:58:21.040 --> 01:58:21.760
Just saying.

01:58:21.760 --> 01:58:23.360
Okay, that's it for me this week, I promise.

01:58:23.360 --> 01:58:24.880
Have a great week, Aaron Y-Y-R.

01:58:24.880 --> 01:58:27.040
If I can find a duster for my Vita, I will.

01:58:28.240 --> 01:58:31.040
You know, we've been playing it on our PSTV.

01:58:31.040 --> 01:58:32.880
Oh, right, because you have that whole thing, sure.

01:58:32.880 --> 01:58:34.800
Yeah, I have that somewhere.

01:58:34.960 --> 01:58:35.840
Remember those things?

01:58:35.840 --> 01:58:38.960
I don't know where it is, but it looks really good on our TV.

01:58:39.760 --> 01:58:42.480
So last email.

01:58:44.960 --> 01:58:46.480
Good evening, OLR.

01:58:46.480 --> 01:58:48.320
I hope you three are doing well.

01:58:48.320 --> 01:58:49.360
Welcome back.

01:58:49.360 --> 01:58:52.160
I've been I've been missed you guys.

01:58:52.160 --> 01:58:54.320
What was the voice change all of a sudden?

01:58:54.320 --> 01:58:58.240
Like all of a sudden you became like the operator when I call the 800 thing.

01:58:58.240 --> 01:59:01.280
Hello, and thank you for emailing, OLR.

01:59:01.280 --> 01:59:03.680
To reach an operator, press zero.

01:59:03.680 --> 01:59:05.280
To proceed for reasons.

01:59:05.280 --> 01:59:05.780
All right.

01:59:10.080 --> 01:59:17.520
Okay, about two months ago, I had sent an email to you guys regarding the Xbox One X reveal at E3.

01:59:17.520 --> 01:59:21.760
I stated that I'm better off building a PC than getting the console.

01:59:21.760 --> 01:59:25.200
Well, I wound up preordering the Scorpio edition of the Xbox One X.

01:59:25.200 --> 01:59:26.160
Congrats on getting it.

01:59:26.960 --> 01:59:32.160
I guess it's more of a case of I want to latest and greatest.

01:59:33.680 --> 01:59:35.360
I'm I'm reading it verbatim.

01:59:36.240 --> 01:59:40.080
However, I did rebuild my PC, and that's pretty damn nice as well.

01:59:40.080 --> 01:59:43.360
Guess you can say I'm future proofing everything in this mofo.

01:59:44.480 --> 01:59:50.320
I watched the Xbox Game Cons conference earlier today, and it was pretty much a cringe fest

01:59:50.320 --> 01:59:56.560
filled with crappy jokes, awkward ass singing, trailers we've seen, we've all seen before,

01:59:56.560 --> 01:59:59.600
and the annoying world premiere announcement and so forth.

01:59:59.600 --> 02:00:04.400
Sitting through all of that just to hear a five minute preorder announcement for the X is just baffling.

02:00:05.040 --> 02:00:10.720
Lastly, I wound up getting a Res Plus, a Nintendo clone with an HDMI output.

02:00:11.280 --> 02:00:14.640
I wound up returning it back to Amazon due to game incompatibility,

02:00:14.640 --> 02:00:17.440
no support for flash carts, and inaccurate sound.

02:00:17.440 --> 02:00:17.940
Avoid.

02:00:18.720 --> 02:00:19.440
That's too bad.

02:00:19.440 --> 02:00:20.560
Hope you guys are doing well.

02:00:20.560 --> 02:00:21.360
Take care.

02:00:21.360 --> 02:00:21.860
Tristan.

02:00:22.400 --> 02:00:23.280
Thank you for the email.

02:00:24.160 --> 02:00:29.280
I didn't think the event was that terrible, but I also only watched 15 minutes of it.

02:00:29.680 --> 02:00:33.280
When I started to see trailers that they've already shown us, I turned it off.

02:00:34.640 --> 02:00:37.920
And I was like, I've seen enough of this to get my mix pot from Mixer.

02:00:37.920 --> 02:00:42.000
My favorite though, unlike, you know, it was World Exclusive Trailer.

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:45.120
It's like an advertisement for the Xbox One X.

02:00:45.120 --> 02:00:48.400
It's like, who cares?

02:00:48.960 --> 02:00:50.240
This is stupid.

02:00:50.240 --> 02:00:51.040
I get you.

02:00:51.040 --> 02:00:52.400
World Exclusive Trailer.

02:00:52.400 --> 02:00:53.440
It's like, okay.

02:00:53.440 --> 02:00:54.800
Well, it is interesting.

02:00:54.800 --> 02:00:56.960
So our emailer here is how to change a heart.

02:00:56.960 --> 02:01:02.400
Had previously decided I'm going to go PC route, but I got to, despite the fact I hated

02:01:02.400 --> 02:01:06.160
that conference, I just tempted to buy an Xbox One X anyway.

02:01:06.160 --> 02:01:07.920
So Microsoft didn't really use with user.

02:01:08.720 --> 02:01:14.560
But anyway, all that, all that aside, um, it did remind me of something we didn't really

02:01:14.560 --> 02:01:17.600
bring up during the opening segment tonight that I kind of wanted to address.

02:01:17.600 --> 02:01:20.560
And that was the whole, who is the Xbox One X really for?

02:01:20.560 --> 02:01:25.120
Because I know Loki and I are sitting here going, well, you know, we're just more into

02:01:25.120 --> 02:01:26.320
the PC side of things.

02:01:26.320 --> 02:01:28.000
Why do we need an Xbox One X?

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:33.200
But you know, we're also geeks who build computers and have top of the line computers.

02:01:33.200 --> 02:01:34.560
Not everybody has that.

02:01:34.560 --> 02:01:39.680
So is there a large, is there a large enough audience for people that are like, I don't

02:01:39.680 --> 02:01:40.640
need a PC.

02:01:41.360 --> 02:01:46.240
I don't want to spend money on a PC, but I want to play Madden and 4k.

02:01:47.040 --> 02:01:48.720
Is that a 4 or whatever?

02:01:48.720 --> 02:01:49.920
Is that audience going to be there?

02:01:50.560 --> 02:01:53.760
Yeah, I think there'll be some people that I don't think it's going to be as big right

02:01:53.760 --> 02:01:57.760
now, because look at, like, for example, look at the PlayStation 4 Pro.

02:01:57.760 --> 02:02:03.120
I mean, I don't think there's really been a lot of like, you have the Xbox One at, you

02:02:03.120 --> 02:02:04.400
know, S that's out there now.

02:02:04.400 --> 02:02:08.880
And you can buy that if you don't have a 4k television or something, then you don't really

02:02:08.880 --> 02:02:10.400
need that cutting edge technology.

02:02:10.400 --> 02:02:15.680
And honestly, like, I think the differences between the 4k presentation and what they

02:02:15.680 --> 02:02:20.640
have available, it's a, it's a great system, but I don't really need that right now.

02:02:20.640 --> 02:02:22.080
Cause I have nothing to display it on.

02:02:22.080 --> 02:02:24.720
Like my monitor on my laptop is 1080.

02:02:24.720 --> 02:02:26.800
That's, that's all I'm going to get out of that.

02:02:26.800 --> 02:02:28.000
My TV is 1080.

02:02:28.800 --> 02:02:29.040
Yeah.

02:02:29.040 --> 02:02:32.960
I don't need to buy all this extra horsepower to pump out a little extra detail.

02:02:32.960 --> 02:02:33.760
It's just not worth it.

02:02:33.760 --> 02:02:36.800
Like that's why I'm not getting a pro pro for me.

02:02:36.800 --> 02:02:40.960
It would be good for like VR, but I don't really want to sync anymore in the PlayStation

02:02:40.960 --> 02:02:47.040
VR because I'm cautious that they're just going to release a new version of it like

02:02:47.040 --> 02:02:48.560
in probably years time.

02:02:48.560 --> 02:02:49.840
So I don't know.

02:02:50.720 --> 02:02:51.120
All right.

02:02:51.840 --> 02:02:53.600
Well, thank you for the email nonetheless.

02:02:53.600 --> 02:02:58.000
And let us know what you think of the Xbox One X once you get your hands on it, since

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:02.000
you got one of these little project Scorpio ones that are already gone.

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:02.880
So, all right.

02:03:02.880 --> 02:03:06.080
Well, I guess that's good for Microsoft that they went that fast.

02:03:06.080 --> 02:03:08.000
So there clearly is an audience for this.

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:08.880
So we'll see.

02:03:08.880 --> 02:03:09.920
We'll see what develops.

02:03:09.920 --> 02:03:10.240
All right.

02:03:10.240 --> 02:03:10.960
Thank you for the emails.

02:03:10.960 --> 02:03:14.720
Again, if you want to email us, participate at orangelandradio.com.

02:03:14.720 --> 02:03:16.880
And now the website's fixed too after all these years.

02:03:16.880 --> 02:03:20.080
So participate after at orangelandradio.com.

02:03:20.080 --> 02:03:23.280
Let's get to some more news stories so we can get to Skype calls in just a little bit.

02:03:23.280 --> 02:03:26.880
Five stories, then Skype calls Orange Lounge Radio on Skype all in word.

02:03:26.880 --> 02:03:27.680
But first, Loki.

02:03:28.240 --> 02:03:28.800
All right.

02:03:28.800 --> 02:03:31.280
So Kojima.

02:03:31.280 --> 02:03:37.040
So he was talking about how Konami kind of when he was working for Konami back before

02:03:37.040 --> 02:03:41.360
they decided to be back in my day, super assholes about everything.

02:03:41.360 --> 02:03:46.800
They decided that they would let him work on kind of whatever he wanted to work on.

02:03:46.800 --> 02:03:48.320
So, you know, it was.

02:03:50.320 --> 02:03:54.880
It kind of freeing that he was able to work on different projects, mainly, you know,

02:03:54.880 --> 02:03:59.040
Mel, you're solid, you know, but of course, you know, other games that he worked on as well.

02:03:59.040 --> 02:04:00.000
Why is this page not working?

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:00.560
OK, here we go.

02:04:02.320 --> 02:04:06.560
But they were saying, you know, whenever they, you know, he would pitch a plan or budget,

02:04:06.560 --> 02:04:07.760
they would tell him, yeah, it's OK.

02:04:09.040 --> 02:04:11.760
I guess it's just at some point they decided that it wasn't OK.

02:04:11.760 --> 02:04:16.240
And then that's when all this shit went new management or something.

02:04:17.200 --> 02:04:21.040
So, yeah, it is great.

02:04:21.040 --> 02:04:27.520
You said that, you know, during, you know, do the games getting bigger, more systems,

02:04:27.520 --> 02:04:28.960
more genres and barriers.

02:04:28.960 --> 02:04:34.720
Many young recruits out of college are thrown into a line and continue to make small background

02:04:34.720 --> 02:04:37.920
objects or explosions for three to five years.

02:04:37.920 --> 02:04:41.600
So that was kind of harder to kind of work your way up to, yes, project management and

02:04:41.600 --> 02:04:42.100
stuff like that.

02:04:42.500 --> 02:04:48.900
You know, there is more and more staff members who only affect extremely small parts of games

02:04:48.900 --> 02:04:51.540
while not being able to see the product in its entirety.

02:04:53.700 --> 02:05:00.020
And, you know, basically saying that, you know, he started a small team of only five

02:05:00.660 --> 02:05:07.220
and he had basically says everyone had to be able to do everything.

02:05:07.220 --> 02:05:10.260
You couldn't say, well, my specialty is such and such thing.

02:05:10.980 --> 02:05:16.340
You had to actually study, work hard, only sleeping three hours each day, that kind of

02:05:16.340 --> 02:05:17.460
mentality.

02:05:17.460 --> 02:05:20.740
So that's kind of he attributes that to his experience.

02:05:21.460 --> 02:05:22.500
So pretty cool interview.

02:05:24.660 --> 02:05:30.020
I don't know, it's neat, kind of sucks that, you know, it sounds like the company is working

02:05:30.020 --> 02:05:36.820
for originally it was kind of, you know, more freeing, but then I guess that kind of changed

02:05:36.820 --> 02:05:37.940
and that's why he's out.

02:05:37.940 --> 02:05:42.980
But at least he's on his own now working with Sony and on a new game that looks fucking

02:05:42.980 --> 02:05:44.740
weird that we had no idea about.

02:05:44.740 --> 02:05:46.260
And hopefully we'll get a new trailer for this year.

02:05:46.260 --> 02:05:50.500
Boy, it sounds like they're sure trying to kind of make nice and mend some bridges, huh?

02:05:50.500 --> 02:05:51.860
Because it, yeah, I don't know.

02:05:51.860 --> 02:05:52.500
It's interesting.

02:05:53.140 --> 02:05:56.980
Interesting little positivity for Konami once in the news this week.

02:05:56.980 --> 02:05:58.020
So I guess that's good.

02:05:59.540 --> 02:06:01.300
How ironic, they needed Kojima to do it.

02:06:02.340 --> 02:06:03.140
All right.

02:06:03.140 --> 02:06:08.740
Well, anyhow, let's move on to PlayStation 4 updates because there is a brand new PlayStation

02:06:08.740 --> 02:06:10.500
4 update on the way for the firmware.

02:06:10.500 --> 02:06:12.180
So this is something that everybody's going to get.

02:06:12.180 --> 02:06:15.140
It's PlayStation 4 firmware 5.0.

02:06:15.140 --> 02:06:21.060
And one of the big features for PlayStation firmware 5.0 PlayStation 4 plus owners will

02:06:21.060 --> 02:06:26.660
now be able to stream on Twitch 1080p 60 frames a second.

02:06:26.660 --> 02:06:31.060
So the, and that's only on the pro, which I guess I'm assuming just the other bandwidth

02:06:31.060 --> 02:06:34.740
wasn't, or the other chips weren't able to handle it on the PlayStation 4 regular.

02:06:34.740 --> 02:06:37.860
So it's kind of limited to 720, but that'll be at 30 frames.

02:06:37.860 --> 02:06:42.740
But this will be really cool that it can do this superpower for those that like to stream

02:06:42.740 --> 02:06:43.940
from their PlayStation 4.

02:06:43.940 --> 02:06:46.980
I kind of wish they would improve the streaming software a little bit.

02:06:48.020 --> 02:06:49.860
But whatever, I guess we'll take a week yet.

02:06:50.420 --> 02:06:53.860
Also, this is just some other minor quality life improvements.

02:06:53.860 --> 02:06:57.540
You can switch off notifications when watching a movie or TV show finally.

02:06:58.180 --> 02:07:02.420
And now the quick menu will be updated so you can see some notifications in there as

02:07:02.420 --> 02:07:02.980
well.

02:07:02.980 --> 02:07:08.020
There's also going to be a robust family management system allowing for multiple adult users and

02:07:08.020 --> 02:07:11.140
different permissions for the kid child account, child accounts.

02:07:11.780 --> 02:07:14.260
And this is also good.

02:07:14.260 --> 02:07:20.580
If you are using VR, you are going to get messages while you're broadcasting in VR mode.

02:07:20.580 --> 02:07:22.180
I think that was something Bobby Blackwell was looking for.

02:07:22.180 --> 02:07:23.460
Broadcast in VR mode.

02:07:23.460 --> 02:07:24.420
Oh yeah, you can.

02:07:24.420 --> 02:07:26.980
But now you couldn't really see your messages or anything like that.

02:07:26.980 --> 02:07:31.700
But now you will actually be able to see the messages as they come in on PlayStation VR.

02:07:31.700 --> 02:07:33.060
So that's kind of neat.

02:07:33.060 --> 02:07:33.860
Something they'll be doing.

02:07:34.420 --> 02:07:39.620
Also, you can bind broadcast to communities that you own so that way when people go into

02:07:39.620 --> 02:07:41.780
your communities, they'll see if you're broadcasting or not.

02:07:41.780 --> 02:07:44.900
Like if you have a streaming community or something set up on PlayStation 4.

02:07:44.900 --> 02:07:48.500
I don't know how often those communities are really being used on PlayStation 4, but I

02:07:48.500 --> 02:07:50.660
guess cool that they're trying to link that all together.

02:07:50.660 --> 02:07:54.100
Maybe they're hoping streamers will try to sell their PlayStation communities harder

02:07:54.100 --> 02:07:55.540
if that feature is available in there.

02:07:56.260 --> 02:08:02.020
Also, if you're watching Blu-rays or DVDs in cinematic mode in VR, you will now get the

02:08:02.020 --> 02:08:07.060
5.1 and 7.1 surround sound if you're listening on your headphones.

02:08:07.060 --> 02:08:08.580
So that's pretty cool as well.

02:08:08.580 --> 02:08:11.860
It's not limited to just that, but those are some of the big updates coming to the

02:08:11.860 --> 02:08:16.340
next firmware, which I believe went into beta testing for select users already.

02:08:16.340 --> 02:08:20.420
And the rest of us will probably see it, what, September, October type of timeframe.

02:08:20.420 --> 02:08:23.220
Yeah, I had a laugh during the week.

02:08:23.220 --> 02:08:29.860
I saw a Twitter account sending out, yeah, we're doing a drawing for early access to

02:08:29.860 --> 02:08:30.660
the new firmware.

02:08:30.660 --> 02:08:33.380
I'm like, that's not how this works.

02:08:34.980 --> 02:08:36.500
I think you can invite a friend or something.

02:08:36.500 --> 02:08:37.620
It's like a beta program.

02:08:37.620 --> 02:08:38.500
Like, what the fuck?

02:08:39.060 --> 02:08:39.780
That's stupid.

02:08:40.660 --> 02:08:44.580
Bobby in chat says, cheap plug, join the VoG network community on PS4.

02:08:44.580 --> 02:08:49.780
Yes, there is a VoG community on PS4 and you should join it so that when something useful

02:08:49.780 --> 02:08:52.420
for communities happens, we'll take advantage of it.

02:08:53.300 --> 02:08:54.020
We promise.

02:08:54.020 --> 02:08:54.900
Bring back home.

02:08:55.860 --> 02:08:57.540
Yeah, when PlayStation Home comes back.

02:08:57.540 --> 02:08:58.580
Now we miss it, huh?

02:08:58.580 --> 02:08:59.700
It used to be the butt of every joke.

02:08:59.700 --> 02:09:00.980
It would be awesome in VR.

02:09:00.980 --> 02:09:02.420
A PlayStation Home would be awesome in VR.

02:09:02.420 --> 02:09:02.900
It would be.

02:09:03.780 --> 02:09:09.780
The closest thing they have, the PlayStation Home in VR is probably, what the fuck is that

02:09:09.780 --> 02:09:10.420
game called?

02:09:12.500 --> 02:09:13.540
I don't remember what it's called.

02:09:13.540 --> 02:09:14.660
I have it.

02:09:14.660 --> 02:09:19.700
It's a bar game where you play different games in a bar and you can literally throw

02:09:19.700 --> 02:09:21.300
bottles at people or stuff like that.

02:09:21.300 --> 02:09:22.980
But it's multiplayer in VR.

02:09:23.700 --> 02:09:24.420
Cool.

02:09:24.420 --> 02:09:25.220
It's like, yeah.

02:09:26.180 --> 02:09:27.300
A sports bar VR.

02:09:27.300 --> 02:09:28.180
Sports bar VR, yes.

02:09:28.180 --> 02:09:30.260
That's the closest thing you're gonna get the PlayStation Home.

02:09:30.260 --> 02:09:30.740
Okay.

02:09:30.740 --> 02:09:32.420
And I would love that.

02:09:32.420 --> 02:09:33.380
It'd be awesome.

02:09:33.380 --> 02:09:33.700
All right.

02:09:34.340 --> 02:09:35.380
Darcy, what do you have for us?

02:09:36.740 --> 02:09:37.380
Some bullshit.

02:09:38.180 --> 02:09:45.300
So basically Nestle, which is granted an asshole of a company because we know what they were

02:09:45.300 --> 02:09:47.140
doing with the water during the water crisis.

02:09:47.780 --> 02:09:56.420
Um, but anyway, Nestle did a breakout themed advertisement and Atari filed a lawsuit.

02:09:57.220 --> 02:10:04.340
Basically they had, um, a bunch of people at a train station who were playing a video

02:10:04.340 --> 02:10:11.780
game similar to Breakout except using the Kit Kat fingers instead of the colored bricks.

02:10:12.580 --> 02:10:19.300
And Atari said basically it's plain and blatant infringement that Nestle exploited, quote,

02:10:19.300 --> 02:10:25.460
the special place it holds amongst nostalgic baby boomers, generation X, and even today's

02:10:25.460 --> 02:10:27.700
millennial and post millennial gamers.

02:10:27.700 --> 02:10:30.100
And it was filed in the San Francisco court.

02:10:30.100 --> 02:10:37.220
Um, the Nestle spokesperson replied that it was a UK TV advert in 2016 and that it no

02:10:37.220 --> 02:10:41.300
longer runs and they're not planning on rerunning it and that they will defend themselves.

02:10:42.100 --> 02:10:51.060
Um, but then again, you know, Nestle, uh, already, uh, lost, uh, a suit with Cadbury,

02:10:51.060 --> 02:10:56.100
um, for trying to, uh, when Cadbury tried, uh, well, when they tried to trademark the

02:10:56.100 --> 02:10:57.300
four finger bar design.

02:10:58.180 --> 02:10:59.620
So whatever.

02:11:01.460 --> 02:11:01.960
Karma.

02:11:02.820 --> 02:11:07.060
It's just interesting to me that this commercial is so fucking old, but that's just how slow

02:11:07.060 --> 02:11:07.780
the law goes.

02:11:07.780 --> 02:11:09.140
That's not fucking old.

02:11:10.020 --> 02:11:13.860
How slow, I mean, if they add campaigns don't last more than a year.

02:11:13.860 --> 02:11:19.860
If they did the Kit Kat campaign with Breakout in 1976, maybe it would be relevant.

02:11:19.860 --> 02:11:23.780
We need to sue Kit Kat for not bringing other flavors here to the US.

02:11:23.780 --> 02:11:24.580
Right?

02:11:24.580 --> 02:11:27.700
Like that's a fucking crime, arrest Kit Kat.

02:11:28.260 --> 02:11:30.020
Why can't we get the chocolatory flavors?

02:11:30.020 --> 02:11:31.060
Those are amazing.

02:11:31.060 --> 02:11:35.220
Or like even just like the green tea and the sweet potato one that you can roast.

02:11:35.220 --> 02:11:35.720
Yes.

02:11:36.420 --> 02:11:37.060
Oh, so good.

02:11:37.860 --> 02:11:38.820
Strawberry cheesecake.

02:11:39.860 --> 02:11:41.380
Ah, I just don't understand.

02:11:41.380 --> 02:11:42.020
All right, moving on.

02:11:42.020 --> 02:11:43.060
A few more stories for you.

02:11:43.060 --> 02:11:48.660
Oh, we need the sake flavor so much orange launch radio on Skype after a couple more

02:11:48.660 --> 02:11:48.980
stories.

02:11:48.980 --> 02:11:49.480
Loki.

02:11:49.860 --> 02:11:50.180
Sorry.

02:11:50.180 --> 02:11:54.660
I'm horribly distracted with the fact that I see the ultimate Epic battle simulator now

02:11:54.660 --> 02:11:55.780
has modding support.

02:11:55.780 --> 02:11:57.540
That's only going to be ridiculous.

02:11:57.540 --> 02:11:58.100
Oh boy.

02:11:58.100 --> 02:11:58.740
I can't wait.

02:11:58.740 --> 02:12:05.780
Speaking of ridiculous Takashi's castle or Takashi's challenges is available now on iOS

02:12:05.780 --> 02:12:07.460
and Android in Japan.

02:12:07.460 --> 02:12:12.500
So you may not have played Takashi's challenge, which was in a Famicom game.

02:12:13.940 --> 02:12:14.440
Whatever.

02:12:15.620 --> 02:12:16.120
I don't care.

02:12:18.100 --> 02:12:23.700
It was a game that came out back in 1986 for the Famicom and now you can actually check

02:12:23.700 --> 02:12:32.340
it out on because I'm sure those games that are meant for, you know, an old Famicom controller

02:12:32.340 --> 02:12:35.540
probably plays so fucking fantastic on a touch screen.

02:12:35.540 --> 02:12:38.180
But yeah, you can subject yourself to that.

02:12:38.180 --> 02:12:39.220
It's going to be available.

02:12:41.060 --> 02:12:44.900
I don't know if it's coming soon, but they added new stage America.

02:12:45.540 --> 02:12:48.740
They have also had 16 by 9 support.

02:12:48.740 --> 02:12:55.780
There's also, I guess, the Huntabo language certification test, which I have no idea what

02:12:55.780 --> 02:12:56.820
the hell that's supposed to be about.

02:12:56.820 --> 02:12:59.860
Apparently you can share the results with your friends via social media.

02:13:01.860 --> 02:13:04.660
So yeah, isn't this game like really fucking hard and annoying?

02:13:04.820 --> 02:13:08.820
Dark Tetsuya in chat at live.vognetwork.com says it's fucking ridiculous.

02:13:08.820 --> 02:13:14.420
Basically, why would you play a fucking ridiculous game like this on a mobile device?

02:13:14.420 --> 02:13:17.780
I mean, like, honestly, like, it's like, that's like, it makes it harder.

02:13:17.780 --> 02:13:21.380
It's like Super Meat Boy on a mobile device.

02:13:21.380 --> 02:13:22.820
Like, why would you do that?

02:13:22.820 --> 02:13:23.940
It makes it even harder.

02:13:23.940 --> 02:13:25.300
It's stupid.

02:13:25.300 --> 02:13:26.820
It's just frustrating.

02:13:26.820 --> 02:13:27.380
And I get it.

02:13:27.380 --> 02:13:31.860
That's the kind of the gist of the game, but it's frustrating.

02:13:31.860 --> 02:13:34.660
Yeah, I wouldn't download this game if you're not looking for punishment.

02:13:34.660 --> 02:13:36.900
That's the joke, basically.

02:13:38.100 --> 02:13:38.580
All right.

02:13:38.580 --> 02:13:41.060
Well, anyhow, one more story for you guys tonight.

02:13:41.060 --> 02:13:43.700
And this is a great note for us to end on before we get to calls.

02:13:44.420 --> 02:13:48.260
Talking about Twitch, another marathon that they have coming.

02:13:48.260 --> 02:13:50.100
Twitch has been nailing it with their marathons.

02:13:50.100 --> 02:13:51.220
They had the Bob Ross.

02:13:51.220 --> 02:13:53.860
They had Mr. Rogers, Power Rangers.

02:13:53.860 --> 02:13:55.780
Well, guess what's coming next?

02:13:55.780 --> 02:13:56.980
StarCade.

02:13:56.980 --> 02:14:00.420
I think we did address this on a previous episode that StarCade was going to be marathoned

02:14:00.420 --> 02:14:01.060
on Twitch.

02:14:01.060 --> 02:14:03.060
Well, now we have some of the details.

02:14:03.060 --> 02:14:06.260
So Shout Factory has the channel, and I think they're trying to push.

02:14:06.260 --> 02:14:10.260
I think the new version of StarCade is in development as well.

02:14:10.260 --> 02:14:11.300
I think there's Blu-rays.

02:14:11.860 --> 02:14:13.620
I think Blu-rays are coming or something like that.

02:14:13.620 --> 02:14:22.980
Well, anyhow, on their Twitch channel starting August 28th at 2 p.m. Eastern, all 123 episodes

02:14:22.980 --> 02:14:27.300
digitized from the source tapes will be broadcast in a marathon.

02:14:27.300 --> 02:14:28.420
It's gonna be awesome.

02:14:28.420 --> 02:14:33.620
And one of the hosts from Geek and Sundry, Erica Ishii, will introduce games and provide

02:14:33.620 --> 02:14:34.580
some context.

02:14:34.580 --> 02:14:39.940
I'm assuming that's because this show was on before many of you were born.

02:14:39.940 --> 02:14:44.020
So some of these games you may actually not know, especially some of the more obscure

02:14:44.020 --> 02:14:44.660
ones.

02:14:44.660 --> 02:14:50.740
Now, us old fucks that were old enough to remember this show when it was on TV, we probably

02:14:50.740 --> 02:14:52.980
don't need her, but that's fine.

02:14:52.980 --> 02:14:55.700
Obviously, something's got to break it up, the marathon, a little bit.

02:14:55.700 --> 02:14:56.740
So that's fine.

02:14:56.740 --> 02:14:57.300
Fine.

02:14:57.380 --> 02:14:58.420
Have somebody explain it.

02:14:58.420 --> 02:14:59.780
I don't even think that's necessary.

02:14:59.780 --> 02:15:02.900
You'll gain context by just watching multiple episodes.

02:15:02.900 --> 02:15:04.340
You'll see what that shit's about.

02:15:04.340 --> 02:15:05.060
Yeah.

02:15:05.060 --> 02:15:11.460
So yeah, no, they are saying that it is running to fuel demand for Shout Factory's upcoming

02:15:11.460 --> 02:15:12.900
StarCade reboot.

02:15:13.860 --> 02:15:14.340
Interesting.

02:15:14.340 --> 02:15:15.140
So check that out.

02:15:15.860 --> 02:15:20.980
Again, now look, I know I'm not a host on Geek and Sundry or any of those things, but

02:15:20.980 --> 02:15:26.500
I would be the best damn game show host ever, and I would host this show in a heartbeat.

02:15:26.500 --> 02:15:30.500
Just email me and you can even use the website now to email me.

02:15:30.500 --> 02:15:31.700
It's fixed.

02:15:31.700 --> 02:15:38.340
So yes, I'll be waiting for your call, Shout Factory, because StarCade was such a good

02:15:38.340 --> 02:15:38.820
fucking show.

02:15:38.820 --> 02:15:39.620
I'm excited.

02:15:39.620 --> 02:15:41.940
I'm excited myself for this marathon.

02:15:41.940 --> 02:15:43.060
I'm actually a little sad.

02:15:43.060 --> 02:15:47.860
I'm only going to be able to watch a little bit of it because I fly out of town early

02:15:47.860 --> 02:15:49.780
in the morning on the 30th for Dragon Con.

02:15:49.780 --> 02:15:50.900
So there you go.

02:15:51.700 --> 02:15:57.460
Anyhow, Bobby Black Wolf in chat says millennials need information spoon fed to them.

02:15:57.460 --> 02:15:59.620
Loki millennials are killing critical thought.

02:16:01.860 --> 02:16:02.660
Oh, you.

02:16:03.380 --> 02:16:04.900
Oh, he's not serious.

02:16:04.900 --> 02:16:06.660
Put the pitchforks and torches down.

02:16:07.460 --> 02:16:08.100
Let's see.

02:16:08.100 --> 02:16:12.500
Dark Tetsuya says, I think one game I remember from the original airing was Dragon's Lair.

02:16:14.820 --> 02:16:18.500
What was the game with the giant robot head that would go beware?

02:16:18.500 --> 02:16:19.220
I live.

02:16:19.220 --> 02:16:20.340
Is that Sinstar?

02:16:20.980 --> 02:16:22.020
Yeah, that Sinstar.

02:16:22.020 --> 02:16:22.660
Sinstar.

02:16:23.380 --> 02:16:26.900
That game was definitely on StarCade because I remember seeing that for the first time

02:16:26.900 --> 02:16:27.540
on StarCade.

02:16:27.540 --> 02:16:30.660
And I thought rad because it was the 80s.

02:16:30.660 --> 02:16:32.180
We said rad a lot more often.

02:16:32.180 --> 02:16:33.220
So there you go.

02:16:34.900 --> 02:16:35.140
Yes.

02:16:35.140 --> 02:16:40.020
And Bob Black Wolf also points out that the reruns were on G4 about 15 years ago.

02:16:40.020 --> 02:16:42.580
Well, that was the last time this was on TV.

02:16:42.580 --> 02:16:45.220
So I mean, it's been a long time.

02:16:45.220 --> 02:16:47.140
If you think about it, think about it.

02:16:47.140 --> 02:16:52.980
Bobby Black Wolf, a 19 year old listening to this show right now, your show or my show,

02:16:52.980 --> 02:16:58.260
a 19 year old in college listening to this show right now was four when those reruns

02:16:58.260 --> 02:16:59.220
were on G4.

02:16:59.220 --> 02:17:02.340
Just process that thought for a minute, Bobby.

02:17:02.340 --> 02:17:03.220
And I'll leave you with that.

02:17:04.740 --> 02:17:08.340
Let's open up the phones at Orange Lounge Radio.

02:17:08.340 --> 02:17:10.340
All one word on Skype.

02:17:10.340 --> 02:17:14.500
If you want to give us a call and talk about anything, or you just want to reminisce about

02:17:14.500 --> 02:17:16.820
old StarCade episodes, that's fine, too.

02:17:17.380 --> 02:17:19.220
I got a nice Bobby in chat.

02:17:19.220 --> 02:17:19.940
Damn it, Rob.

02:17:19.940 --> 02:17:20.900
I dislike you.

02:17:21.540 --> 02:17:22.180
No, you don't.

02:17:24.340 --> 02:17:24.740
All right.

02:17:25.620 --> 02:17:27.380
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

02:17:27.380 --> 02:17:31.620
If you'd like to give us a call and talk about anything tonight, including StarCade or any

02:17:31.620 --> 02:17:37.060
of this other stuff that we've talked about, Gamescom, Xbox, PlayStation stuff, whatever

02:17:37.060 --> 02:17:37.940
you want to talk about.

02:17:37.940 --> 02:17:38.820
Switch.

02:17:38.820 --> 02:17:44.420
We still have mystery Nintendo announcements coming, but I would set the bar at a reasonable

02:17:45.220 --> 02:17:45.540
level.

02:17:45.540 --> 02:17:46.180
Yeah, don't.

02:17:46.180 --> 02:17:48.900
You know, I'm honest, honest to God.

02:17:48.900 --> 02:17:51.540
From what I saw, there's it's not even really announcements.

02:17:51.540 --> 02:17:53.620
I mean, it's sort of like the Treehouse Live stuff.

02:17:53.620 --> 02:17:58.740
So they're streaming Super Mario Odyssey, the new Metroid game.

02:17:58.740 --> 02:18:02.900
Yeah, the first 10 minutes of these games, those types of footage.

02:18:02.900 --> 02:18:04.900
Don't don't set your expectations too crazy.

02:18:04.900 --> 02:18:07.460
You might get maybe there'll be a nice little treat in there.

02:18:08.100 --> 02:18:09.060
Some announcements.

02:18:09.060 --> 02:18:12.980
Once in a while, there might be like, oh, there's going to be a DLC or a sorry, not

02:18:12.980 --> 02:18:17.140
DLC, but a new eShop game is available right now.

02:18:17.140 --> 02:18:17.700
Surprise.

02:18:17.700 --> 02:18:19.460
You know, there might be a cute little thing like that.

02:18:20.980 --> 02:18:21.700
All right.

02:18:21.700 --> 02:18:24.740
Do we have any last minute stories while we wait to see if anybody calls us tonight?

02:18:24.740 --> 02:18:28.100
Bobby got a lot of calls tonight, so maybe we won't, because sometimes that happens that

02:18:28.100 --> 02:18:28.260
way.

02:18:28.260 --> 02:18:30.980
Everybody called Bobby instead, but we'll see what happens.

02:18:30.980 --> 02:18:33.060
A lot of people are watching Game of Chairs.

02:18:34.260 --> 02:18:35.300
Is it done tonight?

02:18:35.300 --> 02:18:35.940
Is it over?

02:18:35.940 --> 02:18:37.300
No, it's only the sixth episode.

02:18:37.300 --> 02:18:38.340
Next week will be done.

02:18:39.460 --> 02:18:41.620
But this episode, because I spoiled it for myself.

02:18:43.220 --> 02:18:44.180
Don't spoil it for the listeners.

02:18:44.180 --> 02:18:44.820
No, I'm not.

02:18:44.820 --> 02:18:45.860
But, ugh.

02:18:45.860 --> 02:18:46.340
Okay.

02:18:46.340 --> 02:18:48.980
So you are going to be, you're going to be smaad.

02:18:48.980 --> 02:18:50.900
No, because I don't pay attention to this show.

02:18:50.900 --> 02:18:51.220
I'm not talking about you.

02:18:51.220 --> 02:18:52.900
I'm talking about the listeners who watch it.

02:18:52.900 --> 02:18:54.180
You're going to be smaad.

02:18:54.180 --> 02:18:54.740
Okay.

02:18:54.740 --> 02:18:55.620
You know what smaad is?

02:18:55.620 --> 02:18:57.220
So, uh, sad and mad.

02:18:58.180 --> 02:18:58.980
Happy.

02:18:58.980 --> 02:19:01.140
So sad and mad.

02:19:01.700 --> 02:19:04.180
Film yourself one of those reaction videos.

02:19:04.180 --> 02:19:05.060
This is the time to do it.

02:19:05.060 --> 02:19:06.340
You're going to be smappy.

02:19:06.340 --> 02:19:07.060
Is that what I'm hearing?

02:19:07.780 --> 02:19:08.100
All right.

02:19:08.980 --> 02:19:10.180
Hashtag boat sex.

02:19:11.460 --> 02:19:12.420
Okay.

02:19:12.420 --> 02:19:14.420
No, no spoilers.

02:19:15.060 --> 02:19:17.060
No, that doesn't happen yet.

02:19:18.820 --> 02:19:19.540
Yet.

02:19:19.540 --> 02:19:19.940
All right.

02:19:20.900 --> 02:19:23.860
Anyhow, let's get to at least one call.

02:19:23.860 --> 02:19:24.820
I think we have on the line here.

02:19:24.820 --> 02:19:25.380
Let's do it.

02:19:25.380 --> 02:19:25.620
Hi.

02:19:25.620 --> 02:19:26.580
You're on orange launch radio.

02:19:26.580 --> 02:19:27.060
Who's this?

02:19:27.780 --> 02:19:28.980
Hey, uh, Rob.

02:19:28.980 --> 02:19:29.940
This is Raginator.

02:19:29.940 --> 02:19:30.580
Hey, Raginator.

02:19:30.580 --> 02:19:31.380
What's on your mind, buddy?

02:19:31.940 --> 02:19:33.140
I know a whole lot.

02:19:33.140 --> 02:19:41.620
Um, not, well, first, uh, not to be, uh, beat this into the ground, but I know it's been

02:19:41.620 --> 02:19:46.740
said in a champ, you know, you know, let me move my mic down.

02:19:46.740 --> 02:19:52.980
Um, I know this has been said, uh, in chat a lot last week, but you know, since I actually

02:19:52.980 --> 02:19:57.380
got you on Skype right now, I just want to verbally say, I'm sorry about your loss.

02:19:58.260 --> 02:20:02.420
Um, I know losing family is really, really tough.

02:20:02.420 --> 02:20:03.860
I believe it or not.

02:20:03.860 --> 02:20:04.980
I've been there myself.

02:20:04.980 --> 02:20:07.700
So, but, um, well, I really appreciate that.

02:20:07.700 --> 02:20:12.740
You know, and it's, it's, it's, it's a little rough right now because one of my closest

02:20:12.740 --> 02:20:17.860
friends in the entire world is going through something, um, that's a little too similar.

02:20:17.860 --> 02:20:20.740
And, um, it's, it's just, it's so hard right now.

02:20:20.740 --> 02:20:25.780
This is just like, I just want to take this entire summer and just fire it.

02:20:25.780 --> 02:20:26.900
Like it's awful.

02:20:26.900 --> 02:20:30.100
Everything about this summer has been awful.

02:20:30.100 --> 02:20:32.420
So that's all I really have to say about that.

02:20:32.420 --> 02:20:37.220
I'm just hoping that DragonCon and Labor Day in general and everything is just a nice big

02:20:37.220 --> 02:20:40.260
reset button on this fuck of a year.

02:20:40.260 --> 02:20:41.460
That's really all I have to say.

02:20:42.020 --> 02:20:45.220
Yeah, believe me, I completely and utterly understand.

02:20:45.220 --> 02:20:47.540
So, uh, I've been there myself.

02:20:47.540 --> 02:20:57.140
So, uh, but, um, anyway, um, I, I would assume that you heard my call with, uh, Bobby

02:20:57.140 --> 02:20:58.900
earlier during the evening.

02:20:58.900 --> 02:21:00.980
Cheap plug for Bobby Shaw.

02:21:00.980 --> 02:21:06.420
Really great show airs live before, uh, orange launch radio on Sunday evening.

02:21:06.500 --> 02:21:08.100
So you got to pay for that air time.

02:21:08.100 --> 02:21:09.860
No, no, Bobby's great.

02:21:09.860 --> 02:21:10.260
Of course.

02:21:10.260 --> 02:21:11.620
We talk about him every week.

02:21:11.620 --> 02:21:12.660
He's fantastic.

02:21:12.660 --> 02:21:17.300
Um, I, I, in all honesty, I only heard a little bit of it because that was right at the moment

02:21:17.300 --> 02:21:19.060
that one of my co-hosts arrived at the show.

02:21:19.060 --> 02:21:23.940
So we were talking a little bit about round table pizza and his, uh, frustrations.

02:21:23.940 --> 02:21:26.100
So I didn't hear the entire thing.

02:21:26.100 --> 02:21:26.740
No, it's fine.

02:21:26.740 --> 02:21:27.380
It happens.

02:21:27.380 --> 02:21:30.260
Uh, but I, uh, so you'll have to refresh my memory a little bit.

02:21:31.060 --> 02:21:35.620
Um, well, I can't remember exactly everything that was sad.

02:21:35.620 --> 02:21:42.740
Truth be told, but the general highlights is, uh, now God versus versus steam really,

02:21:42.740 --> 02:21:44.340
uh, and why.

02:21:45.540 --> 02:21:50.100
Bobby, you know, really doesn't use, you know, God so much as steam.

02:21:50.100 --> 02:21:54.020
Oh, because the whole, that they don't have prepaid cards like steam does and his concerns

02:21:54.020 --> 02:21:56.020
about security, which I totally get.

02:21:56.020 --> 02:21:56.260
Yeah.

02:21:56.820 --> 02:21:57.140
Yeah.

02:21:57.140 --> 02:22:02.420
Uh, and of course, you know, I kind of took a relatively minor patch on it.

02:22:02.420 --> 02:22:08.500
The fact that you have bought virtually every version of, uh, you know, mass effect, you

02:22:08.500 --> 02:22:14.340
know, three, no demand, except for the cell phone version or the TI-83 version.

02:22:15.220 --> 02:22:16.100
Oh, is it ported there?

02:22:16.100 --> 02:22:17.380
I may have to pick that up.

02:22:17.380 --> 02:22:19.620
Well, I've, I've also bought things on GOG.

02:22:19.620 --> 02:22:28.900
Um, actually I was, um, uh, given Witcher three on VOG, on VOG, because of VOG wink

02:22:28.900 --> 02:22:30.900
nudge, I was given that on a GOG.

02:22:30.900 --> 02:22:34.420
And so that kind of opened the door, but you know, see, here's the thing.

02:22:34.420 --> 02:22:39.540
I actually really appreciated GOG when it was the classic games and stuff.

02:22:39.540 --> 02:22:44.180
Like I w like when Sid Meier's covert action came out, I was fucking jazz.

02:22:44.180 --> 02:22:48.100
I really wish they would somehow get the rights to the original civilization.

02:22:48.100 --> 02:22:48.900
I would buy that.

02:22:48.900 --> 02:22:50.820
I want to stream that game so fucking bad.

02:22:50.820 --> 02:22:51.860
I want to buy that.

02:22:51.860 --> 02:22:55.220
Um, but I guess it's just caught up in, in legal issues or whatever.

02:22:55.220 --> 02:23:00.340
So, I mean, there are, there's things like, I loved GOG when it was like all that stuff.

02:23:00.420 --> 02:23:05.140
Now I don't get as into the newer games and stuff on GOG, but I don't dismiss it either.

02:23:05.140 --> 02:23:08.900
It's just, it's another, it's another, it's, it's a very crowded marketplace

02:23:08.900 --> 02:23:10.740
when it comes to online stores.

02:23:10.740 --> 02:23:13.620
And, you know, GOG is just another place to keep your eye on for some deals.

02:23:14.340 --> 02:23:14.900
Yeah.

02:23:14.900 --> 02:23:19.700
And admittedly, you know, it took me a while to get out to GOG myself.

02:23:19.700 --> 02:23:25.220
Uh, uh, thanks to you, you know, I, and you're constantly mentioning that

02:23:25.220 --> 02:23:27.540
steaming their sales and your deals and all day.

02:23:27.540 --> 02:23:34.420
I initially started with, uh, steamed first and the fact that they have prepaid cards for,

02:23:34.420 --> 02:23:38.340
uh, helped and I didn't have a bank account for a while.

02:23:38.340 --> 02:23:46.820
So buying stuff on GOG was a problem, but, um, that, uh, that aside, um, you know,

02:23:46.820 --> 02:23:52.740
the main purpose of my call was, uh, I was going to pose this question, uh, question to you and,

02:23:52.740 --> 02:23:54.740
you know, everyone else as well.

02:23:54.740 --> 02:24:04.500
Um, Mass Effect 3 aside, um, you know, if you bought, uh, you know, whatever game,

02:24:04.500 --> 02:24:11.380
you know, multiple times through whatever distributor and, uh, and, you know, why,

02:24:11.380 --> 02:24:17.860
you know, in my case is usually now I get the steam version for, uh, achievements and what then,

02:24:18.100 --> 02:24:23.460
get the GOG version for digital, digital extras, like soundtracks about that.

02:24:24.500 --> 02:24:28.820
So what games have you basically double dipped on for extra features,

02:24:28.820 --> 02:24:30.580
I guess, am I summarizing there?

02:24:30.580 --> 02:24:35.300
Yeah, extra features, trading cards, achievements, whatever.

02:24:37.620 --> 02:24:42.020
I just bought just recently, the most recent one, Pac-Man Championship Edition 2,

02:24:42.740 --> 02:24:48.500
I bought on, uh, steam because I already had it on a PlayStation 4.

02:24:48.500 --> 02:24:54.500
I bought it to a, be able to stream it and easier because yes, I can do it through the PS4, but

02:24:54.500 --> 02:24:59.540
I'm forced to use the PS4 is like interface, which I like my interface where I get alerted

02:24:59.540 --> 02:25:03.220
to subscribers and follows. I like it so I can thank them. I like that interface better.

02:25:03.220 --> 02:25:08.820
So I like to stream PC for that reason. I, and yes, I will hook up the PS4 through my

02:25:08.820 --> 02:25:13.380
capture card. It's just a little bit, one of those, like I have them in two separate rooms,

02:25:13.380 --> 02:25:17.300
long story short, it's easier said than done, but that'll probably happen eventually.

02:25:17.300 --> 02:25:21.700
But anyway, um, uh, with that whole thing, I double dipped on that for that.

02:25:21.700 --> 02:25:25.700
And it was super cheap. Like it was on sale. I don't know if it was like a humble bundle

02:25:25.700 --> 02:25:29.620
or something, but I feel like I picked that up for a real nominal price. And I was just like,

02:25:29.620 --> 02:25:34.340
eh, whatever. I'm going to get it again. And that's, I think, I think part of the reason why

02:25:34.340 --> 02:25:41.380
steam has come up in comp in the conversation a lot is because steam is infamous for these sales

02:25:41.380 --> 02:25:45.540
where games will get so cheap that people aren't afraid to double dip because it's like,

02:25:46.340 --> 02:25:52.020
it was a buck, you know, um, another one, VVVVV. I own that on like three different platforms.

02:25:52.020 --> 02:25:57.300
I have that on 3DS PlayStation four and steam. And part of the reason I'm encouraged to do it

02:25:57.300 --> 02:26:01.780
because it's cheap. It's not a very expensive game. So, you know, Mass Effect three was one

02:26:01.780 --> 02:26:05.120
But a lot of the other games I noticed I've double dipped with are cheaper games

02:26:05.120 --> 02:26:08.760
I'm highly likely to do it with Sonic Mania as well

02:26:09.280 --> 02:26:13.280
Just because I would like to have the portability that comes with a Nintendo switch

02:26:13.720 --> 02:26:17.300
I don't know. What about you guys any double dipping on on

02:26:17.820 --> 02:26:21.460
Consoles or whatever of games you want to call out or PC console whatever

02:26:21.980 --> 02:26:24.480
Well, it's like Grand Theft Auto 5

02:26:24.480 --> 02:26:29.160
I have both on console and on PC and I because you can mod it on PC, huh?

02:26:29.580 --> 02:26:33.080
Not so much but yeah, you can I've heard that one before I

02:26:33.840 --> 02:26:39.980
Skyrim is another video. Yeah, I have that on both. I've got like lots of systems for Skyrim and then

02:26:41.280 --> 02:26:44.980
Don't fall off for yet on both systems, but I don't know

02:26:44.980 --> 02:26:47.840
I'm I haven't played the ice I'll have to go back and play that

02:26:48.360 --> 02:26:50.920
Anything for you dark soccer that comes to mind something you've double dipped on

02:26:52.040 --> 02:26:57.240
Um, I don't you'd have to go all the way back to like Symphony of the Night on Saturn and PlayStation, right?

02:26:57.320 --> 02:27:03.400
Actually, no recently I have I picked up older despair girls for steam as well as already had it on

02:27:04.800 --> 02:27:07.280
PS TV and what was the

02:27:07.920 --> 02:27:09.920
motivation behind it just I

02:27:09.960 --> 02:27:12.080
Would much rather play it on steam

02:27:12.120 --> 02:27:12.640
Yeah

02:27:12.640 --> 02:27:18.700
Sometimes it's just about my my PC versus my TV and the different rooms that they're in and all that

02:27:19.240 --> 02:27:24.880
Act-def points out overwatch on Xbox one and PC and I'll get it on ps4 if I get the console

02:27:24.960 --> 02:27:31.640
Yeah, me too I have it on well not Xbox yet, but I probably will eventually but I have it on PlayStation 4 and PC

02:27:31.640 --> 02:27:33.520
and it's because

02:27:33.520 --> 02:27:39.000
It was on sale on ps4 and I finally decided there's people on ps4. I want to be able to play this game with

02:27:39.880 --> 02:27:41.880
That was a big part behind it

02:27:41.980 --> 02:27:47.840
So well good questions fascinating. What was the last name you double dipped on if anything? Oh

02:27:48.560 --> 02:27:50.560
well before

02:27:51.080 --> 02:27:52.440
God

02:27:52.440 --> 02:27:58.400
Implemented the whole guy conduct your thing. I did buy

02:28:00.280 --> 02:28:05.560
You know odd world Abe's Odyssey, yeah, and I'm God

02:28:06.200 --> 02:28:08.200
Well after the fact, you know

02:28:08.560 --> 02:28:14.740
After the fact that I got on steam, you know, I did this not the same with Duke Nukem 3d

02:28:15.520 --> 02:28:17.520
the main reason why I got a

02:28:18.520 --> 02:28:23.520
You know odd world, you know, he's obviously is because of the soundtrack and all the you know

02:28:23.680 --> 02:28:26.480
all our extras that came with the dog version and

02:28:28.320 --> 02:28:33.040
Many reason why I got the Duke Nukem 3d along with all the

02:28:33.600 --> 02:28:39.040
Nukem games there is because they were dope cheap the RM free and plus they came with

02:28:40.080 --> 02:28:43.400
Extras like ringtones and stuff like that. So I can't figure what the hell

02:28:44.040 --> 02:28:47.360
59 cents per game normally six bucks

02:28:48.120 --> 02:28:54.780
You know, even though no poor people peels like me can afford 59 cents per game. So

02:28:55.560 --> 02:28:58.080
When they get that low a lot of people want to jump on board

02:28:58.080 --> 02:29:03.080
I want to get this one too in chat act Efton chat says I also have Rayman legends on Wii U

02:29:03.280 --> 02:29:08.440
Vita Xbox one and PC lol. Well, you never get to tease me about Mass Effect again, sir

02:29:08.520 --> 02:29:10.640
But also I should I should add to this

02:29:11.280 --> 02:29:13.880
Something I played this week that I forgot to mention during the top of the show

02:29:13.880 --> 02:29:16.720
There's a demo for Rayman legends on the switch

02:29:16.960 --> 02:29:21.360
So there's another platform for react after you now get on the switch and actually anybody with a switch

02:29:21.440 --> 02:29:25.680
It's worth just downloading the demo. It's a pretty robust demo and it's free

02:29:25.680 --> 02:29:28.800
So you can kind of you know, check out if it's something you'd be into or not

02:29:28.800 --> 02:29:34.200
So I think they get that game away on the Xbox gold or PlayStation Plus or something some time ago

02:29:34.200 --> 02:29:37.860
So I think a lot of people kind of have it that way anyway, but it's worth checking out on switch

02:29:38.340 --> 02:29:44.780
You know the funny and funny thing is you know that you mentioned the Rayman series, you know, I seen

02:29:45.300 --> 02:29:46.680
No

02:29:46.680 --> 02:29:50.060
You know virtually the entire series on you know

02:29:50.060 --> 02:29:56.340
The various PC storefronts with the exception out there very first game game

02:29:56.340 --> 02:30:02.260
I don't see you seem to see it either on you play your scheme or God or anything, you know

02:30:03.300 --> 02:30:07.060
Do you happen to know why is it like a licensing thing or?

02:30:08.580 --> 02:30:12.780
Compatibility thing or something like that. Oh, no idea. I don't know what it's legal stuff. Who knows

02:30:14.900 --> 02:30:18.580
All right, well, I'll probably let you go on I'm tying up your line

02:30:18.580 --> 02:30:25.660
Yes is I'm sure act act after dungeon buster or somewhere else. We'll probably want to call in so we'll see

02:30:25.660 --> 02:30:31.220
I I well have a nice day. Thanks for taking my call. Of course. Take care buddy. Bye. Yep. You too

02:30:31.260 --> 02:30:34.340
All right. We'll see if anybody else wants to sneak in here before we wrap it up

02:30:34.340 --> 02:30:36.940
It is almost 9 o'clock. So I do want to wrap it up

02:30:36.940 --> 02:30:38.940
So if you're thinking about it, you better do it now

02:30:39.100 --> 02:30:44.420
Any other last-minute stories want to get to Loki before we there wasn't really anything not a lot of other stuff

02:30:44.420 --> 02:30:47.580
Yes, there was I saw there was an opinion piece says

02:30:48.620 --> 02:30:53.780
from destructive where they talked to some insiders at Nintendo saying that with the

02:30:54.260 --> 02:30:58.460
State of affairs the way things are going right now because the water was kind of the one pushing

02:30:59.060 --> 02:31:05.200
the rhythm heaven series that there's not going to be any more of those brought over from Japan and that also the

02:31:05.480 --> 02:31:07.880
Translation of mother three is just not happening. Ah

02:31:08.560 --> 02:31:14.520
Bitch that they they are having issues like they last time they attempted to do it

02:31:14.520 --> 02:31:18.680
I guess they had stopped when they got to the my gypsy my gypsies

02:31:18.680 --> 02:31:23.640
I guess is ones and it's not to do with like a trans character or something. They know how to

02:31:25.760 --> 02:31:30.200
Represent that without offending everybody put a disclaimer put a disclaimer in the game

02:31:30.200 --> 02:31:36.280
That says it's like they do with the old old racist cartoons put a disclaimer at the beginning

02:31:36.280 --> 02:31:40.680
You know that says this was what it was at the time. It doesn't necessarily reflect how we feel now

02:31:40.680 --> 02:31:44.920
That's one way to do it. Anyway, I want to make sure I grab this call because we have another call coming out

02:31:44.920 --> 02:31:49.960
It's got oh damn it. I just missed it caller. Try to come try to try one more time if you hear me

02:31:51.520 --> 02:31:54.440
Let's see looking in chat over at live dot vog network comm

02:31:55.080 --> 02:31:58.040
Nintendo might try to take a wrecking ball to it. So be careful

02:31:58.040 --> 02:32:03.760
Mmm, let's see. Oh, here we go. Good that calls coming back in. Let's see if I can grab it this time

02:32:04.720 --> 02:32:09.840
Green button. Here we go. Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this? Hey this act death. Hey, glad you made it in

02:32:09.840 --> 02:32:11.840
What's up, buddy?

02:32:11.920 --> 02:32:16.200
Well, I've been playing overwatch and a lot of Lucio ball

02:32:17.080 --> 02:32:23.800
I want to ask you how have you have you played Lucio ball and in competitive I did. Oh, no not in competitive

02:32:23.800 --> 02:32:29.040
I played enough Lucio ball to get my box and then I was kind of I didn't really play it again

02:32:29.040 --> 02:32:31.240
I don't know. I mean, I think Lucio ball is cool

02:32:31.240 --> 02:32:34.320
Like it's obviously got a very rocket League sort of vibe to it

02:32:34.320 --> 02:32:36.160
So I kind of like it for what it is

02:32:36.160 --> 02:32:40.000
But I just I don't know if I liked it enough to do it competitive

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:46.240
like I can't even do regular overwatch competitive because mouth-breathers just take it too seriously and it's like I'm not

02:32:46.480 --> 02:32:51.040
Good enough like I don't want to get screamed at when I go into these matches and I'm not doing one

02:32:51.040 --> 02:32:57.280
So I just like to do the fuck around matches where if you if you yell at somebody for we need a healer god damn

02:32:57.280 --> 02:33:02.160
It we need a healer when you're doing that in quick play. It's like be the change you want to see in the world

02:33:04.160 --> 02:33:09.840
Well, I've been I've been taken taking Lucio ball seriously, no, it's fine

02:33:09.840 --> 02:33:12.320
No, and it's no and there's nothing wrong with that act F

02:33:12.320 --> 02:33:17.760
Do what you enjoy if you can handle it and you're having fun with it fucking more power to you. I'm excited for you

02:33:17.760 --> 02:33:20.800
How's it going for you? You do you that's right you do you how?

02:33:21.040 --> 02:33:22.560
How is it going for you?

02:33:22.560 --> 02:33:24.560
I'm diamond ranked

02:33:24.560 --> 02:33:30.760
So yeah, I've been doing really great. But the thing is and talking about

02:33:31.840 --> 02:33:35.400
Teammates not doing that. Well, and I know that not

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:39.320
Necessarily everyone knows how to play Lucio or knows how to play

02:33:40.400 --> 02:33:42.400
Lucio ball even or football

02:33:42.680 --> 02:33:48.680
but it's kind of frustrating that that people know don't know the basics of

02:33:49.440 --> 02:33:51.440
Soccer like it's

02:33:52.080 --> 02:33:53.800
don't know if it's

02:33:53.800 --> 02:33:59.680
Because well, I'm next I'm Mexican. I'm fine. It's football and we have it like

02:34:00.360 --> 02:34:05.840
Yeah, like ingrained in our system, but it's right and us Americans can't be fucking bothered. Can we?

02:34:07.920 --> 02:34:12.920
Yeah, no, it's fine it's fine drag us we deserve it

02:34:15.040 --> 02:34:16.640
Like

02:34:16.640 --> 02:34:21.200
The two of the team of our teammates going for the ball instead of just one

02:34:22.120 --> 02:34:25.280
The goalie not being it's in their place

02:34:25.840 --> 02:34:31.800
The I don't know many things. I don't even fucking watch sports and I knew that one

02:34:31.800 --> 02:34:34.840
The goalie shouldn't leave if you if you are the player

02:34:34.920 --> 02:34:39.520
That gets put in the little goalie box at the beginning of the match you say in your damn problem

02:34:39.520 --> 02:34:44.300
You stay in the fucking box unless once in a while like hockey once in a while

02:34:44.340 --> 02:34:46.140
It is appropriate to pull the goalie

02:34:46.140 --> 02:34:51.780
But I say as I'm like, I don't watch sports, but I know some of these things. But anyway, I know enough. Okay, so

02:34:53.180 --> 02:34:55.420
Sometimes you pull the goalie, but there are very

02:34:55.940 --> 02:34:59.100
Strategical reasons why you do that and it's one of those things where you know

02:34:59.100 --> 02:35:04.000
The ball is in a very particular place where you're not gonna fuck up by leaving the goal

02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:09.820
Like there are very particular reasons why you do it and for most people you may just want to stay near the goal

02:35:09.820 --> 02:35:12.780
I also by the way, most people know this I played I was uh

02:35:12.780 --> 02:35:16.020
I was one of those soccer kids that played from the time

02:35:16.020 --> 02:35:20.220
I was like I was like five years old or something. I played for like five years and

02:35:20.920 --> 02:35:25.700
By the way, I was an excellent goalie. That's what I pretty much always played was either goalie or goalkeeper

02:35:26.560 --> 02:35:32.660
Yeah, I also and my youth when when I had but least somewhat good health. I

02:35:33.300 --> 02:35:35.620
Also played goalie so I know how to play goalie

02:35:35.620 --> 02:35:41.520
Yeah, but but it's kind of baffling to see people like trying to to go for the ball

02:35:41.520 --> 02:35:48.620
When when another teammate is there or having the two teammates like being goalie at the same time. It's like

02:35:49.040 --> 02:35:53.000
Dude, no, don't do that. It's confusing for both of you

02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:58.920
And you're still you're seeing this in diamond ranked matches where people don't know this. Yeah, it's like dude

02:35:58.920 --> 02:36:04.760
How did you get diamond ranked in the first place? If you don't know how to play here's the thing that here's like wow

02:36:04.840 --> 02:36:09.200
Here's what here's what could make the world a better place and I'll kind of wrap up on this

02:36:09.200 --> 02:36:14.280
I think we wrap up the show here. Here's the hey, we could just all make the world a better place and make gaming culture

02:36:14.280 --> 02:36:16.360
Better here's how we could just make gaming culture better

02:36:16.560 --> 02:36:18.000
You know what? That's fine

02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:23.840
If you want to give that feedback to the other players that hey, maybe the goalie should stay near the goal

02:36:24.200 --> 02:36:27.760
But it's all about how you deliver that message

02:36:28.040 --> 02:36:35.840
You don't get on the microphone and scream you fucking noob you fucking dipshit noob you fucking goal fucking noob

02:36:35.840 --> 02:36:38.280
Go to the fuck. How would one fuck the goal?

02:36:39.680 --> 02:36:44.360
Isn't it kind of it's a hole you know, you you don't have any big hole though

02:36:44.360 --> 02:36:47.520
You don't do that on the microphone. You just say hey

02:36:48.200 --> 02:36:51.300
Could you go you know, since you were the player that was dropped in front of the goal

02:36:51.320 --> 02:36:55.440
You could you protect the goal cuz you know, we'll probably get a point if you could do that, you know

02:36:55.840 --> 02:37:01.080
There's just better ways to deliver messages than the way people do it sometimes in gaming culture

02:37:01.280 --> 02:37:08.920
So I'm just that's all I'm gonna say maybe I would play competitive overwatch if people I don't know treated each other with some

02:37:08.920 --> 02:37:10.920
fucking basic human decency

02:37:12.320 --> 02:37:16.680
Yeah, well at least in Xbox I haven't tried it on PC

02:37:17.200 --> 02:37:21.080
I have been nice. It's I don't get like

02:37:21.720 --> 02:37:28.000
Too much too many people like being aggressive or being well total assholes

02:37:28.720 --> 02:37:33.600
Even on PC the one the one time I tried it. I got a really good team

02:37:34.600 --> 02:37:37.400
Sorry, okay, I got really good teammates that

02:37:38.120 --> 02:37:43.360
Actually, well, even if I kind of messed up they were like, oh don't don't sweat it

02:37:44.920 --> 02:37:46.680
Just try this

02:37:46.680 --> 02:37:48.840
Another time and they were pretty

02:37:49.600 --> 02:37:52.260
Understanding even yeah. Yeah, you know to be fair

02:37:52.520 --> 02:37:58.720
Alan plays on overwatch and I hear him on voice chat all the time because I tease him cuz like I'll walk by the computer

02:37:58.720 --> 02:38:02.360
Room and I hear him playing overwatch and I'll go diva out of Mac diva out of Mac

02:38:02.400 --> 02:38:04.200
You know, I'll make fun of him a little bit because that's what we do

02:38:04.200 --> 02:38:06.960
But you know, he voice chats all the time on there and he's fine

02:38:06.960 --> 02:38:09.800
He's doing a good time or has having a good time with that and you know

02:38:09.800 --> 02:38:14.880
I play a lot of Final Fantasy 14 and sometimes we have to help you know, same thing happens

02:38:14.880 --> 02:38:19.600
Somebody dies I as a healer get somebody killed because I was trying to DPS too much. I'm like, oh my god

02:38:19.600 --> 02:38:22.960
That was my bad. Sorry about that and other people like hey, no sweat. No worries

02:38:22.960 --> 02:38:27.640
It happens and like it it's cool when that happens in that game. It's like, okay

02:38:27.640 --> 02:38:31.660
We're all decent human beings having a good time, you know, but you know

02:38:31.660 --> 02:38:38.900
If somebody early on in my 14 experiences had been fuck you you fucking fuck. I probably wouldn't be playing that game anymore. So

02:38:39.820 --> 02:38:47.220
yeah, most probably it it's good that the people do play like well smart and and

02:38:47.940 --> 02:38:49.940
Don't act like assholes most of the time

02:38:50.260 --> 02:38:56.260
It's kind of awful that sometimes they do but it's if you can enjoy the game like that

02:38:56.260 --> 02:38:59.020
It's it's okay and dark Tetsuya

02:38:59.020 --> 02:39:03.140
I think on a good note here in our chat over at live dog network comm says at the end of the day

02:39:03.380 --> 02:39:07.340
It's just a video game. Yes. It's just a fucking game

02:39:08.700 --> 02:39:12.420
