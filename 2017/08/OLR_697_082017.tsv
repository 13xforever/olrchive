17200	21360	iOS and Android in Japan for fans to relive Takeshi Kitano's masterwork of the 8-bit era.
21360	24720	This is just one highlight of the week's gaming news, join us for plenty more, starting right

31600	35520	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week at the show where
35520	41840	every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio. Live tonight, episode number 697 for this,
41840	48720	August the 20th of 2017. My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E,
48720	52160	joining me by my side. Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
52960	57040	I want a beer. You want a beer? Right now. I don't have beer, I have wine. Actually,
57040	63120	because that song, I wish you were a beer, was stuck in my head. What song is that? It came out
63120	67040	in the 90s. It's called I Wish You Were a Beer. There were a lot of great songs that came out in
67040	71440	the 90s though. So wait, I wish you were a beer? Who sang it? I wish, hold on, I'm gonna find out,
71440	76000	I forgot who did it. Somebody in our chat room will know, I promise you, over at live.vognetwork.com
76000	79520	because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.
79520	84640	Cycle Sluts From Hell. Of course, the band that's up your alley.
86400	88240	Were you calling? 1991.
88240	90080	Wait, was that the name of the band or was that you calling our chat room?
90080	92400	That was the name of the band. Okay, all right.
92400	97200	Cycle Sluts From Hell, I Wish You Were a Beer. All right, fantastic. Well, if you want a beer,
97200	102000	come join our chat room and wish for one because I don't have any. Live.vognetwork.com,
102000	104800	6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, every week at the Voice Geeks Network,
104800	108640	right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. It's gonna be a fortune cookie one day.
108640	113280	It should be. It's a good message. I like that. Say hello as well to, I don't know if he has a
113280	115360	beer, but it's Techmaster Loki. No, I know.
115360	118080	Yeah, you have like a 7-Up or a Sprite over there, right? Or what is that?
118080	119440	It's a Pepsi. It's a Pepsi.
119440	121280	It was a Pepsi. It was a Pepsi.
121280	123600	It's since been devoured. Now it is nothing.
125040	126960	Gone forever. How are you doing?
127520	133360	I'm full, except, you know, I went to Roundtable again, despite them fighting me.
133360	135280	Pizza place on the West Coast. Not everybody has them.
135280	139920	Sorry. Yeah. Pizza place. So I got more breadsticks because we had, they have like a,
140480	145680	they were doing a, like a rewards program type thing that they're phasing out Friday.
145680	149120	And I had like enough points for like free breadsticks and stuff. I was like,
149120	154640	I got to use it up or use it or lose it. So yep. You know, as much, even though I got breadsticks
154640	159440	last week and I was going to go to El Pollo Loco this week, I'm like, okay, I get breadsticks
159440	163520	again. Use those points. And then next week I'll go play a local.
163520	168080	Another, another West Coast chain. And they just, I shouldn't give away where I live totally,
168080	173520	but I guess, well, there's a brand new one nearby, nearby. We'll say that near-ish. And,
173520	179760	uh, so, um, Loki it's, it's, I think not out of the way for you really on your drive over here.
179760	184560	Um, so you are thinking about going there on the regular, right? Cause that's pretty good.
184560	187200	I don't know. I'll put it as fast as food goes. It's pretty good.
187200	192160	The other one that I haven't been going to really is, um, Jim boys tacos,
192160	196640	which I actually went there the other day and I'm like, man, I forgot how good this is.
196640	199600	And these are all like local places and our people back East are like, what the
199600	205360	hell is he talking about? It's a taco stand. It's it's it's American style tacos.
205360	208320	It's it's good. They, they kept top of them like Parmesan cheese.
208320	211360	Yeah. They put Parmesan cheese on them, which is like, you wouldn't think,
211360	214000	you wouldn't think it's good, but it's good. But it's, it's really good.
214000	218640	And so I found that there's one on the way as well, because all the other ones I knew about
218640	222320	were like in the opposite direction. So. All right. Stop talking about food. You're
222320	226640	making us all hungry. We're here to talk about video games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle
226640	230480	and all that good stuff. Let's get into some video game chat actually here at the top of the show.
230480	234400	Uh, let's talk a little bit about games com because games com is about to kick off. It's
234400	237840	about to get underway. I don't, what, when do they do their show? Is it, is it like a Tuesday,
237840	244000	Wednesday, Thursday thing? Like E3? Uh, yeah, I don't remember. Okay. I know. I thought it was,
244400	250160	you know, I kind of got blindsided. I thought it was the weekend. And then I heard that Microsoft
250160	255040	was doing their like pre games com announcement thing today. And I was like, on a Sunday,
255040	259600	I was like, Nintendo's got a presentation. It sounds like a repeat of the tree house stuff,
259600	264480	but they're doing something, um, next couple of days, I think Monday or Tuesday. So there's,
264480	268240	so games comes in the middle of the week, like E3, I was like Monday through Thursday or something
268240	272480	like that. I don't know why I didn't think of that. Bobby Black Wolf and chat says it's all
272480	277760	week. The beginning is industry only and later is open to the public. Okay. That makes more sense.
277760	284000	They should do with like E3, E3 should just copy that model. It's been there getting there.
284000	287440	They're getting there. No, I'm serious. Like they tried it this year where they just open it up and
287440	294160	it was a big old mess. They should, I mean, it's worked for games com for how long now that this
294160	300480	format, why don't they just copy it? Do what Apple and like the other companies do when they see
300480	305120	something that works, they copy it and they make it better. So like you don't make it worse. That's
305120	311840	not what you want to do. So. They put their own spin on it. Exactly. Um, guys, you don't,
311840	317680	our chat over at live.vog network.com says too many cons, man. Not to, not to be on a tangent,
317680	322800	but I'm gonna, cause this is OLR, but if you guys know, is it just me or does it seem like within
322800	328400	the past Oh five years or so, there are more conventions in general. And I don't just mean
328400	333120	like gaming conventions on a national scale. I mean like local stuff. Maybe we're just paying
333120	339280	attention to it more. Are we? It just seems like everyone, maybe it's that Facebook, Twitter,
339280	344160	social media age we live in where I'm aware of more of it now. Was it, my coworker was asking
344160	349520	me if I was going to the, the Sacramento con SAC anime because they got, I guess they have the
349520	354480	voice actors from Overwatch there. Oh, I didn't even know that. I do know like all the power
354480	359600	Rangers are going to be there. So Shane was going to go, but he had a, he had a thing. He's not
359600	365520	going now. So, um, at least I don't think he is. So, um, but yeah, that I know is, uh, something
365520	369360	that was, I haven't been there since what the last time we've broadcast there, like at seven
369360	372960	or eight in the morning or something like that. That wasn't even the full SAC anime. I don't think
372960	378000	that was like a day con or, uh, or even before that, when they used to do it like in sunrise
378000	382480	mall, like they would actually have, like, do you remember that the, the McDonald's that wasn't
382480	386400	there anymore, they would literally put curtain in front of the windows and they would project
386400	390160	stuff. And that was one of the screening rooms. It was an old ass McDonald's that wasn't open
390160	395040	anymore. Yeah. So I don't, it just seems like there's, there's so much more stuff here locally
395040	400240	anyway, but, uh, anyhow. Um, okay. So what I really want to talk about games con, uh,
400240	404720	was I wanted to talk about the Microsoft event that they did earlier today. So they kind of
404720	410400	announced a few things sorta. I mean, like, you know, they weren't, they didn't drop anything
410400	414080	like big, there was no like big, big bombshells, but there was a few things that they put out
414080	418400	there. Namely, of course they are trying to push the Xbox one X. And so some of the big things they
418400	423440	talked about. More games getting 4k updates. That seemed to be a really big message that the old
423440	428400	library is getting updated. And I definitely sense this, uh, kind of emphasis, if you will,
428400	434720	on like old is new again, between these 4k updates and really pushing backwards back compatibility
434720	439760	and that whole thing. I thought you said it was out of style. Well, now it's retro. Exactly.
439760	444480	What's old. Like they were showing guys is fashionable again. They were showing something.
444480	448640	I think it may have been recourse, something like that. And maybe talking about 4k updates for that.
448640	454560	Your record was one of them. It just didn't look that great. I mean, like, I mean, don't get me
454560	458480	wrong recourse, probably a great game, but like the footage that they were showing, I'm like,
458480	463600	I can't see how putting this in 4k is going to make this look any better. Well, it pales next
463600	468720	to fours, but for right. Exactly. It was designed to be a 4k game. Recore was not, they're going
468720	473200	back and updating recourse, but I mean, it's not just that it's, um, uh, quantum break was
473200	476400	obviously the one I picked up that, you know, that's a huge deal. They said they were going
476400	480080	back and doing family friendly titles as well, that they really wanted to emphasize that part
480080	483520	of their library. Yeah. I did notice one of the things that they were talking about in,
483520	487520	and this was actually a rerelease. Like I think they're actually going to sell them again is
487520	494320	on the Xbox one X or Xbox one, they're going to be selling, um, the Disney, uh, adventure game,
494320	499280	which remember connect adventures, remember that shit. Um, so Disney adventures was kind of a
499280	504400	sequel spinoff of that, where you use the connected to Disney theme games, but come
504400	509040	along the same lines. And then they also had a Pixar one that was kind of similar.
509040	514400	And then they had, um, the zoo tycoon game that was also a connect game. I don't know if that
514400	518080	one also had controller support originally, but now they're going back and they're adding
518160	522560	controller support to these and they're also supporting 4k.
522560	527760	Although honestly, I think these games came out like during the three 60 era. I mean,
527760	535360	uh, I can't imagine that it's gonna be really worth it. Like I'm not like, Oh shit. I really
535360	541360	passed on Disney adventures before, but now that it's 4k fuck. Yeah. Let me get in on that.
541360	546480	Well, maybe they're just trying to really cater to people who did like completely
546480	549520	miss these games the first time around. I mean, I can understand why they're trying
549520	554000	to take a family friendly approach. It's something that I think Sony's a little weaker on.
555040	559760	But Nintendo is very strong in that department. So I don't, I mean,
559760	563600	I don't know where Microsoft's trying to land in that whole picture, but you know,
564320	568240	it'll be interesting. I don't know. What do you kind of think? I open this up to everybody
568240	573200	really here in studio. What do you guys think about like Microsoft and their position right
573280	577920	now? Just in general, like what are your feelings when it comes to Xbox?
578560	585040	They have a big problem where they're competing with themselves. And like the big problem is that
585040	590320	they have windows 10 and they put out their games on windows 10. I have a windows 10 PC
590320	594080	and all these things that they keep pushing out and like saying, Oh yeah, here's why you need to
594080	600720	get an Xbox one X. It doesn't sell it for me. Cause it's like, I see this game like, Oh yeah,
600720	606240	player on player unknowns battlegrounds is going to be coming to Xbox one. I'm like,
606880	612400	but I have a PC it's already on PC. I don't need to buy an Xbox for that. Or,
612400	618400	you know, Hey, you're going to play crackdown three, which will also be on PC and next year,
618960	622880	next year. But that's fine, you know, next year, but all these games that they're showing,
622880	627600	I can also get on my PC. And so there's not really anything driving me to, I need to buy it.
627600	634480	And even with the Xbox one X, I don't have a 4k TV. I don't, there's nothing really pushing me.
634480	639280	There's nothing saying that I need to get this for this reason. Like 4k is going to be awesome,
639280	644240	but I'm just going to wait because aside from gaming content in which there really isn't a
644240	650160	whole ton of it right now, there's nothing. There's not a lot that can be displayed in 4k
650160	654160	right now. The content hasn't caught up to that. A couple of things with that. Um, first off,
654160	657840	we should kind of quickly address that crackdown delay because that was big news that came up this
657840	661280	week that I wanted to address the top of the show. But if you hadn't heard crackdown three
661280	665440	did get officially delayed until next year, they're not going to make the holiday. But I
665440	671120	think when it comes to game delays at this point, I think there's, I kind of get like a shift in the
671120	676320	gaming public at large on Twitter is I think people have come to accept that a game delay
676320	680240	isn't always necessarily bad news. And I think a lot of people, at least I know I am with this
680240	683920	crackdown news. I'm like, okay, well, if it needs it, delay it because there's just been,
684480	689120	you know, and we'll get into this later in the show, but there's obviously one big game. You
689120	692080	all know what I'm talking about that we got some news on this week. We'll get into later.
692080	696240	They really should have been delayed again. That wasn't, you know, and now it's paying the price
696240	700320	for not being, it's paying way too big of a price for not being delayed again. So there's, there's
700320	705120	a part of me that's like, if you should, if you need to delay games, just, just do it, just do it.
705120	710400	But it does put Microsoft in that awkward position of, well, shit, there went one of our
710400	715920	largest holiday things that we're pushing. So now it's like the message that I'm seeing at a games
715920	721840	comm is, well, we have Forza and then look at this vast library of shit you never played before
721840	725760	that we're going to make all new again. So we got this whole big library you haven't explored,
725760	728960	so come on over. But that was one thing I wanted to say with that. The second thing I want to say
728960	735680	with that is, if you go over to Windows 10 for your gaming, is that really a loss for Microsoft?
735680	742800	I'm not so sure it is. It's not, but it's gonna hurt Xbox maybe, but Microsoft doesn't exactly
742800	749040	lose. No, they don't lose from that. But you know, it's just, I don't know, it's not gonna give me
749040	753680	the buy their console, I guess. But then they don't really need for me to buy a console because
753680	758800	I have Windows, I guess. But I don't know. I didn't buy Windows, it just came on my machine.
759440	763600	Dungeon Buster in chat says Microsoft will keep going. They won't give up and will try a lot of
763600	768960	things to generate interest and draw crowds like the decision to publish PUBG for the Xbox One.
769600	774720	Kajudo in chat says Crackdown is going to be the new Duke Nukem. The game won't come out till it's
774720	780240	a 20 year internet joke. No, it hasn't been in development that long. Not that long. I mean,
780240	785360	it was announced some time ago, but I think at least, I think what's happening here is that
785360	792000	clearly a decision was made to shift Crackdown into a 4K game. Like, Crackdown was not going to
792000	798720	be what it is now, and that is a big boost for the Xbox One X. I think Crackdown's kind of like
798720	803680	visibility got shifted. It's kind of, okay, let's talk about games that should have been delayed for
803680	811120	a minute. It's kind of what happened with No Man's Sky and PlayStation 4, right? That was rushed
811120	815200	out. Right. And that now I think we're all at a point where it's like, wow, No Man's Sky probably
815200	819600	would have benefited if it delayed. Yeah. If it released with what it has now, that would have,
819600	824000	it would have been a very successful game. So now with Crackdown, I think maybe Microsoft's
824000	827280	taking that approach that, you know what, maybe we should just go ahead and delay it so we don't
827280	830080	have a No Man's Sky thing on our hands. But I think it's one of those cases where it's like
830080	834800	Crackdown was supposed to be this big bolster for the Xbox One X, and so they've kind of put
834800	839360	more into it than was probably there before, including, you know, now the big name talent
839360	843040	that we have attached to this game and everything, you know, that probably all wasn't there when the
843040	847680	game was first in development. So I think what's happening with Crackdown is a little bit different,
847680	852960	but again, if it had to be delayed for that reason, fine. You know, again, there's other
852960	856960	games where it's very clear the development happened in the last year, or maybe they should
856960	863040	have delayed it another year. Final Fantasy XV, actually, now that, you know, gosh, not even
863680	867920	one that's in the news this week, but I'm thinking of all these games now. No Man's Sky should have
867920	871680	been delayed. Final Fantasy XV. Final Fantasy XV. I should really go back, or Just Cause 3,
871680	876080	another one that came out and it was just broken, still kind of broken now. I mean,
876080	882320	there's a lot of games that get put out that are just buggy or just not ready to go.
882320	886640	Yeah. I mean, like, I don't, are we past the moratorium on spoilers of Final Fantasy XV yet?
887280	892480	I won't. I won't. I haven't played it. I won't. Let me just say, but I will start to talk a little
892480	897680	more. I'm not gonna spoil anything, but I just will say the end section of the game, for those
897680	903520	that have been there, past the infamous chapter 13, this would be chapter 14 or 15. I can't
903520	911200	remember my mind, but it was really odd to me that that whole section of the game was not expanded on
911200	915760	in a major way. And I feel like if Final Fantasy XV had been delayed, it would have been.
916400	921200	So it's just, again, I don't, it's just going to be with any of the expansions that are coming out?
921200	928160	No, now the expansions are all like these weird side game things. Like Prompto is like a completely
928160	933680	different type of game, practically. It's like another thing that exists in the XV universe.
933680	939200	They have the multiplayer thing coming to XV, but I totally missed the boat on the beta test
939200	942960	because that all happened when I was... It's just like, it's so disappointing that,
943120	947920	remember when they were showing off the VR, kind of teasing the VR support for XV,
949120	953040	and then now it's a fishing game? It's like, come on.
954320	959200	SHO 100 Matt says, was Final Fantasy XIV original release a product of rushing to get it out,
959200	965440	or just bad that required a total remodel from scratch? Yeah, the original Final Fantasy XIV
965440	970560	was just, it was rushed bad. It was really, and they paid the price for it. But when they went
970560	974560	back and did it, they put together a really great game in a really short amount of time,
974560	979440	all things considered. So I mean, Final Fantasy XIV is a very interesting, like, I don't think
979440	985280	there'll ever be another video game like it. It's very interesting. But anyway, we got a little off
985280	989840	track with the Gamescom stuff. I didn't really check in with you, Jamie. I know your household
989840	995040	doesn't have Xbox One right now. I mean, where's your guys' head out with Microsoft? Is it just
995040	1000320	one of those, we don't care because everything we need is Sony or Nintendo right now? Or where's
1000320	1004960	your, yeah, that, you know, Microsoft is all bark, bark, bark, bark, bark, bark, bark. I'm
1004960	1011680	like, okay, good. So you feel like with Microsoft, you don't get a lot of, like, I guess there's not
1011680	1015280	a lot of meaning behind the words. That's it. I'm just trying to interpret what you're saying.
1015280	1019360	Nothing really that I care about yet. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Well, especially nowadays when you're
1019360	1023280	purchasing, when you have multiple game systems, it's all about what console exclusives they have
1023280	1028960	and what console exclusives do they have? Because there's not a lot coming out anymore. It's like
1028960	1035600	Forza seven. I'm not into SIM driving games. So it's not horizon, you know, horizon three.
1035600	1042720	That was one of those four K updates. That's cool. Yeah. Um, but you know, I've got a PC
1042720	1047760	that can run Forza horizon three now. Really nice. And so I, yeah, I just don't need it.
1048800	1052720	I think I'm in a really similar place when it goes, and I mentioned this after E3,
1052720	1058880	the way I felt about Microsoft after E3 was, um, wow, I'm really sold on 4k gaming for my PC.
1059680	1064160	Well, on top of that though, on top of that, here's the other reason why I'm even with their
1064160	1071200	Microsoft games. I'm not entirely gung ho to jump into that. Cause if I want to play Forza horizon
1071200	1079120	three multiplayer, I got to pay 60 extra dollars a year. Oh, so Xbox live is live. And that's
1079120	1084400	another subscription that like, I don't get enough use out of. Yeah. But isn't, I mean,
1084400	1088480	to be fair, isn't that kind of, Oh, well, okay. I was gonna say, isn't that an industry standard
1088480	1095120	like Sony and soon Nintendo on consoles, but I own a PC. So fuck that noise. Oh,
1096400	1100320	do you ever, are you, maybe I shouldn't even say this out loud. Everybody's going to say, shut up,
1100320	1104720	shut up, Rob, shut up. Are you ever worried that Microsoft may take some of those games and
1104720	1109040	paywall gate them on Xbox gold because windows 10, they would have the technology to do that
1109040	1113680	if they wanted to. What do you mean paywall gate them? Meaning you would have to have
1113680	1119520	Xbox gold to play those games online, even on PC. I think you do on Xbox. Do you really buy
1119520	1123760	the store, buy it through the storefront? I think you have to have gold to play multiplayer.
1124480	1127440	I'm pretty sure you're right. You're probably doing, I don't know. I need somebody in the
1127440	1132960	chat to confirm that. Cause I don't know. I can't think. Oh no. Xbox live on PCs for you. Okay.
1132960	1138880	Well, sweet. Who said that? Wow. Okay. Well then I guess that solves that problem.
1138960	1147760	Interesting. Interesting. Hmm. All right. Well maybe can you do the cross play without Xbox
1147760	1154720	goal? I wonder, I wonder if, yeah, I wonder if Microsoft, maybe, maybe that's what Microsoft
1154720	1161760	needs to do. Like if they really want to turn some heads and the Xbox live gold or keep it as a,
1161760	1165120	yeah, I know bingo. Here's what you do. Here's the deal. Got it. I know. I know the answer.
1165200	1170000	Are you ready? Everybody ready? Xbox gold. You no longer need it for multiplayer.
1170000	1177520	Xbox gold instead is their new Netflix games thing. Done. Done. Right. That's that would
1177520	1183200	turn so many heads if they did that. It would be nice. I mean, I, I don't understand why
1184240	1189120	aside from numbers, cause obviously people playing on the X windows 10 store are probably
1189120	1195040	a lot less than, you know, on Xbox live on console, but where do they get off thinking
1195040	1201680	that they can charge, you know, for online play on consoles where PC you, you don't, I mean,
1202880	1208800	I don't know. It's just kind of stupid. And it's, it's lucky for them that for the, you know,
1208800	1214640	great game and like crackdowns probably gonna be a great game, but you know, anything else that's
1214640	1219680	multiplayer out there, you know, I could get on PC, like call of duty or something like that.
1219680	1224480	Might want to play, you know, steam money to play online. That's ridiculous.
1225760	1230400	Yeah. I I'm that's, that would be my advice for Microsoft. And granted, I, I realized this could
1230400	1236480	be a huge financial thing or whatever, but like just end Xbox gold and change it into,
1236480	1241200	for people that already have it, give them the Netflix thing instead. Um, like, cause I have
1241200	1244640	Xbox gold through February, but if they were to say, you know what, we're no longer, we're going
1244640	1247520	to require it from multiplayer, but for those of you that already bought it, you're going to get
1247520	1252400	the game pass for the time that you had Xbox gold or whatever, I would be perfectly satisfied.
1252400	1256880	I would not be upset. It'd be great, you know, compared to, I mean, they're not going to do that,
1256880	1260880	but I don't think they will either. But I just think, I think heads like, like Microsoft,
1260880	1265360	if Microsoft wants to get fucking noticed right now in this contest with Sony and Nintendo and
1265360	1270080	all this stuff that would do it like to, to shatter the industry expectation right now,
1270080	1273600	which is, Oh, if you're on console, you're going to pay money to play online because now even
1273600	1276800	Nintendo is going to be doing that. I just, I don't Microsoft were to shatter that it would
1276800	1281440	turn heads. Like I just think it's so ridiculous to say, you know, Oh, well, you know, cost money
1281440	1286240	to run service. Yeah, I get it. It costs money to run service, but why on PC, you know, and then
1286240	1290160	we're talking like the most popular games here, why on PC, like player unknowns battleground or
1290160	1294720	something like that. Why are they charging for online there? They have the run service too.
1294720	1299360	Why is it so hard for the console manufacturers and console makers and console publishers out
1299360	1304240	there to run online servers, which let's be honest that a lot of them kind of suck.
1304240	1308960	And on top of that, they're charging you for a season pass for all this unnecessary DLC.
1308960	1311840	And then on top of that, they're, you know, double dipping with, you know,
1311840	1316880	microtransactions and games and loot boxes and all that nonsense. Why do they think that they
1316880	1319840	can get away with that? Well, I know why they think they can get away with that because you've
1319840	1325280	been paying it all this time. And this is kind of something you're used to now. Well, stop being
1325280	1332240	used to that. Start complaining about don't play games on consoles. Uh, and Bobby brings up a
1332240	1336560	point in chat here that says, I assume this is some administrators who run Xbox live servers
1336560	1341040	demand that they be paid for their time as well. So they do need money to run their servers. Sure.
1341040	1345520	Running servers isn't free, but couldn't that money come from another place? Like,
1345520	1349760	like Loki is saying, these expansions that come on for games and so forth, the money that they
1349760	1353600	sell when they make the system, you know, other parts of the ecosystem. Here's why you're saying
1353680	1357680	like, I've been doing it up until now. I get it. I get it. Once again, you know,
1357680	1363680	they need money for their service. Sony just recently started demanding money for a multiplayer.
1363680	1368080	It wasn't a problem on the PlayStation three. Why is it a problem now? And if you're going to say,
1368080	1371600	Oh, well, more people are playing. Well, you're selling more copies. You're bringing in more
1371600	1378320	money. So what is the problem again? I would just point to on PC. It's not about not a problem.
1378320	1382720	It's not a problem PC. Yes, I get it. It's less people claim, but you know,
1382720	1386560	it's all scalable servers all end up shutting down after a year anyway, because
1387120	1393520	they don't want to pay the people to maintain them anymore. Yay. Case in point, because a lot of it,
1393520	1398320	like a lot of this stuff is even like virtual servers now, and they can scale it so that it's
1398320	1403280	more cost efficient than it probably was, you know, years ago. And like, I just don't understand.
1403280	1407840	It's an excuse is what it is. It's an excuse to charge more money because people are like,
1407920	1410880	well, I guess that makes sense because the publisher is telling me that they need more
1410880	1414800	money to run for, you know, to run those servers. And I guess that makes sense to myself. So I'm
1414800	1419040	going to pay them money and that's it. And you're used to it now. And they're going to throw you a
1419040	1424080	few free games of old shit that you might not play. Another reason why I bring this up and I'm
1424080	1429360	like, you know, I, I really truly feel like I'm not talking crazy when I, I re I seriously suggest
1429360	1434400	this as something that Microsoft could do is because I thought part of the reason Microsoft
1434400	1440400	started offering free games and started doing that whole thing was there was rumors years ago
1440400	1445840	when they first started doing that, that Microsoft was looking to change Xbox live and that possibly
1445840	1451440	at that point they were going to sunset and no longer require online multiplayer. So I don't
1451440	1456320	think it's an unheard of type of thing, but anyway, I'm just throwing it out there. You know,
1456320	1461520	if, if they continue to charge, they continue to charge, but we'll see. All right. Anyway,
1461520	1464720	we do want to move on, start to get into how was your game a week ago? Did I hit everything
1464720	1470560	with gamescom? It was boring. They, they did announce that the Xbox one X is on pre-order.
1470560	1475600	That was the big bombshell drop, you know, there, but, and they're gone. The project,
1475600	1481040	the project, I didn't care. I was like, whatever. Um, the Minecraft console, it kind of cool.
1481040	1485760	They had like a, a Minecraft console for the Xbox one S that was kind of neat. All that made me
1485760	1489600	think is like, man, if I ever build my son a PC, that's how I'm going to paint it. But that I'm
1489600	1495360	not going to buy that console. Oh, I know one big thing I need to mention, uh, Jurassic world
1495360	1500160	evolution. They did show off a trailer for a new game and you know, it, it had the big grand
1500160	1506560	sweeping footages and then dinosaurs are there and dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, you know that
1506560	1512320	what we all come to expect from Jurassic park, right? I was into it. I liked it. Like Jurassic
1512320	1517600	world tycoon. Yeah. I think that's kind of neat actually. Like if they're going to do like a
1517600	1522640	rollercoaster tycoon, but you get to have dinosaurs and like, instead of, okay. Okay.
1523840	1528240	I really hope this reference is not lost on the entire audience, but there is like one of the
1528240	1533040	most hilarious, I don't remember if it was vine or YouTube or what it was one of the most hilarious
1533040	1537360	fucking things I've ever seen in my life. I don't know why it's so funny to me,
1537360	1541040	but there's this clip and it's from one of those rollercoaster tycoon games where you can actually
1541040	1545600	watch the people go down the rollercoaster. Right. And they're writing it starts off with a
1545600	1551120	Rihanna's song. Uh, we found love in a hopeless place. Like it's all like happy and bouncy and
1551120	1554480	they're going on the rollercoaster and they're doing like the thing or whatever. And then all of
1554480	1563600	a sudden the track ends and the music changes to Adele as the rollercoaster goes flying off the
1563600	1568160	track and all the people, and it goes in slow motion and all the people are flying off and
1568160	1575360	there's explosions and gone. Oh no, no, no, no, no. It's a really sad Adele stuff, right?
1576400	1579520	I don't know why, maybe I was just drunk when I saw it the first time and I thought it was
1579520	1583120	like the funniest thing I'd ever seen. So the reason why I bring that clip up is because
1583840	1587200	if in Jurassic world, you're going to be able to like do that, but like, you know,
1587200	1591760	instead you might have an outbreak where like, oops, the dinosaurs are eating your guests.
1591760	1597840	That's going to be fucking rad bathrooms in this park. I'm dropping your ass in the T-Rex cage.
1598160	1605680	Would you play a game like that? Dark soccer. I know you're not big on Microsoft, but could a,
1605680	1609760	could a Jurassic world game where the dinosaurs eat the guests. Could that make you like, look,
1609760	1614800	that was the only reason I watched like, what was the second one where they took the dinosaur
1614800	1620320	to New York? A San Diego. Yes. Yeah. Whatever. Just because of the whole scene where they're
1620320	1625280	all walking through the field and like they're being picked out like a buffet. And my friend,
1625280	1630560	Danielle and I were watching it laughing our asses off. I would play a game like where you
1630560	1634880	could play the dinosaurs, picking them out of the grass. So yeah, maybe. Okay. I wouldn't be,
1634880	1639760	I wouldn't play the dinosaurs. SSG100Matt says, looking for it now in regards to YouTube. Come
1639760	1645760	on. No Gus says I'm convinced Rob is tipsy. I'm not. I'm totally sober right now. I, Alan. You're
1645760	1649120	high on life. Alan will know where that YouTube is. He will know where it is. I'm gonna ask him
1649120	1652880	to go find it for me. So you guys know I'm not crazy and I'll just, I'll post it to the OLR
1652880	1660080	Twitter. There you go. You know what now? We're at what? Jurassic park is frightening in the dark.
1660640	1665040	All right. Anyway, uh, we're going to get into our gaming weeks, but I do want to address one piece
1665040	1669680	of like late breaking ish type of news. Um, after we finished show roll, but before the show started
1669680	1674880	tonight, so I don't know if you guys saw, but it's going around Twitter right now that PlayStation
1674880	1683360	got hacked, which is a half truth. It seems so far. Uh, it, it appears that, well, the social
1683360	1688640	media clearly was hacked. Uh, PlayStation social media account. There was a message on there that
1688640	1692080	said, you know, dah, dah, dah, where this, I don't even remember who the group was and it doesn't
1692080	1696480	matter, but basically that, you know, hacker fortune we got, we got in your account and all
1696480	1701360	this stuff and email us and all this, but I believe they claimed in that message to have
1701360	1707600	like PlayStation login, but it's unclear if they meant like the big thing that happened in 2011 or
1707600	1713360	like we have your social media logins. So I wouldn't think you should panic right now about
1713360	1721840	your own personal login. However, there is never a bad time to go in, change your password and enable
1721840	1726800	two factor authentication. So, you know, whether they were hacked or not, maybe those are two
1726800	1731360	things you should think about doing, uh, enable that two factor auth. If you don't have it yet,
1731360	1736400	now's a great time to do that and a great reminder for that. But otherwise they could, maybe they
1736400	1740720	just brute forced social media passwords until they figured it out. I mean, I don't know. It's,
1740720	1746000	it's hard to say. So there you go. Did SSJ100 Matt find that YouTube clip? Oh my God. He did,
1746000	1750320	didn't he? Wait, hold on. This is very important for live radio. And I know this is, uh,
1750880	1754720	I know this is internet and a radio and you can't really see this or whatever.
1755520	1760880	Yes. This is it. Oh my God. This is it. Okay. Okay. No, this is very important. Dark soccer
1760880	1772400	load. You have to see this. Oh, it's not even the Rihanna song. Okay. Wait, why did I think,
1772400	1775200	I mean, I know it's the backdrop to the Rihanna song, but I swear when I saw this,
1775200	1778320	it was like, because they have multiple, like they probably have multiple rollercoasters.
1781040	1784160	Okay. Anyway, I'm going to have the one that goes back into the crowd. I'm going to fast forward.
1784160	1790560	Yes. Hold on. So they're going up and they go down. Okay, here we go.
1792160	1795520	See, and they're going through the rollercoaster and we were having so much fun.
1797600	1806160	Rollercoaster tycoon three. Yes. And then it goes up and it's a crash.
1806160	1812960	Do you know that someone recreated,
1812960	1816240	imagine dinosaurs are eating all those people after they come off.
1817360	1820640	Really works for radio about the Jurassic park game too.
1820640	1823920	Is it's also on PlayStation and PC. Oh, is it?
1827440	1831760	Someone made the death coaster and roller coaster tycoon. I'm sure everybody made the
1831760	1837440	death coaster. The euthanasia coaster. Now what if the euthanasia coaster had dinosaurs?
1839120	1842080	What a way to go. Why not? You, you were big on the Sims.
1842080	1845040	Have they ever done a dinosaur expansion for the Sims?
1845040	1847040	No, but I'm sure. What if they do now?
1847040	1850080	I'm sure someone did like pets mods or something where you could have like
1850080	1852560	velociraptors or something. I don't know. All right. Anyway.
1854320	1858640	Come on, Noel Gus in chat says, eh, if they want to hack my Tumblr, go for it.
1858640	1864480	Lots of brute force solo vids on there. I guess that's what Tumblr's for. All right,
1865120	1869360	let's move on. So anyway, about the hacking for PlayStation, I wouldn't panic,
1869360	1874320	but changing your passwords, never a bad idea. So let's talk about our two factor.
1874320	1878960	Yes. Two factor, always a good idea. Like if you don't have two factor on your important shit,
1878960	1884080	like your email, you have got, wow. And I didn't realize, um, and we, I think we talked about this,
1884640	1889200	since it's done by the Planet Coaster devs and Planet Coaster is pretty awesome.
1889200	1894400	So the Jurassic world games by Planet Coaster. Oh, maybe I'll play it. Oh,
1894400	1898880	oh, that changes everything. That's going to be some fucking awesome shit. Okay. Yeah. Now hype,
1900080	1906480	Jurassic hype. All right. Let's, uh, let's get into our gaming week. Star Sakura.
1906480	1911280	Jack shit. You didn't play anything? I don't really play anything. Well, I mean,
1911280	1916400	other than me, Tomo and Pokemon go and Sailor Moon drops something Sailor Moon drop. Oh,
1916400	1922400	that's that little phone game, right? Yeah. It's annoying. Um, I really didn't play much of
1922400	1930560	anything. Um, I, I, I put down for a Kickstarter, which I will be talking about later, but, um, no,
1931360	1934480	kind of gamed out for a little bit just for this week. It's been a,
1935360	1941520	last week was kind of a, uh, an odd week taking a week off. Yeah. I just needed to not stare at
1941520	1947920	things so much. So we watched all of defenders instead. Cause that's, that's what it is. It
1947920	1952720	was a Netflix weekend, not a video games. It's all Jessica Jones all the time. There's the answer.
1952720	1958560	Jessica Jones plus Luke cage equals OTP. All right. So it's not that you're just over games.
1958560	1963680	It's just that I was actually a little tired of being, you know, latched to my computer after I'm
1963680	1968000	on a computer all day at work. So fair enough. Fair enough. All right. Uh, how about you,
1968000	1977440	Loki? Did you have any luck with gaming? Um, no, uh, no, honestly this weekend was more of a Lego
1977440	1984400	weekend cause, uh, we made a trip to the Lego store. We have a Lego hobby shop nearby and I
1984400	1990320	bought one of the cool sets that they have from Lego movie because my son really likes fire trucks
1990320	1994320	and they had a fire truck mech and I was like, that shit's going to be awesome to put together.
1994320	1998800	And it was, it was very awesome. Um, it was also cool about that too, is they actually have,
1998800	2003360	it's an unlock code for the Lego movie game, which I have so I can unlock a character.
2004000	2010080	I think that mech thing in that game. So that's pretty cool. Um, I did play a little bit of like
2010080	2016080	mobile stuff. I'm still playing the office space game. Um, they've tweeted some more like each
2016080	2022800	week it's a different game. Almost they keep adding stuff to it. Um, and then I also played
2022800	2027280	a little bit, uh, Pokemon go because my son went back to school and he used to have a pokey stop
2027280	2033040	as school, but apparently cause you know, portals in pokey stops at schools is a big no-no.
2033040	2036320	Someone finally caught on and they removed it and I was like, ah, God damn it. Now what am I,
2036320	2042800	how am I doing the morning? So yeah, that was unfortunate. And then I played ingress and by
2042800	2048960	playing ingress, I mean I opened up the ingress and I took out, you know, some items from my MUFG
2048960	2053760	capsules so that they can just keep generating. You played more than I did of that game. There's
2053760	2059840	more things that I'm never going to use because I'm just not interested anymore. But you know,
2059840	2065280	occasionally I'll just like, did it, did any of my, you know, Jarvis viruses, um,
2065280	2071760	duplicate. Oh, once in like two months. Okay, cool. Yeah, that's worth it. There you go.
2073680	2078000	To register participation for this week's episode of orange on radio at vog network.com.
2078000	2083280	Use the pass phrase price. All right, let's see my gear. We are, I played, I played some stuff.
2083280	2086800	I played a little bit. I mean, a lot of it is, you know, the stuff I've been continuing with.
2086800	2092080	Uh, if you watched after the show last week, I did Ori in the blind forest on Twitch and I think
2092080	2095440	that was a really fun stream. And that, that game, I'm really glad I went back and revisited
2095440	2099360	that game and I need to play more of it. I just, you know, I got sidetracked with other stuff.
2099360	2104800	Now I'm including splatoon two, which I still been playing. I'm really trying to force myself
2104800	2110240	to use things that are not the roller. Um, and I'm actually, you know what, my score is getting
2110240	2115200	better by using the dualies. Have you tried the umbrella or whatever that was? No, cause the
2115200	2120560	umbrella is level nine and I'm still level eight, but I'm like one bucket. I'm one match away from
2120560	2125040	level nine. Uh, the bucket, I like it as a weapon, but I'm not very good with it. Same thing with
2125040	2129040	the paintbrush. I love the paintbrush as a weapon, but I'm not very good with it, but I might go back
2129040	2134160	and try to like force myself to play it more because here's the thing. I don't do motion
2134160	2140640	controls with the roller, but I will do motion controls with the dualies and the like the guns,
2140640	2144960	because I kind of think you have to like, I'm starting to realize like, okay, if you want more
2144960	2151680	that kind of like mouse and keyboard type of feeling, you kind of have to use motion controls
2151680	2156080	and they did make it so that like, you know, when you press the Y button, it resets. So it doesn't
2156080	2159680	get too crazy. And you know, it is sensitive. I mean, the motion control technology has come a
2159680	2164880	long way since the Nintendo Wii. So like, you know, it's not like crazy. It's, it's pretty,
2164880	2168560	especially with the pro controller, I use pro controller. It's pretty, it feels pretty good.
2168560	2172800	So, um, I'm just kind of forcing myself to learn that way and I'm, I'm making progress. So I feel
2172800	2178000	a little better about what I'm doing in Splatoon 2. Um, and then, uh, let's see one new game that
2178000	2183920	I checked out this week, Sonic Mania on, uh, PlayStation 4, actually, I forgot that game was
2183920	2188400	coming out on Switch and I saw it on the PlayStation 4 and I bought it as soon as I saw it. I was like,
2188400	2191840	oh yeah, that game was out this week. And then I realized it was coming on the Switch. I was like,
2191840	2196960	shoot, I could have got it there so I could have it portable and TV, but, oh, well I have the
2196960	2202640	trophies and whatever, you know, sharing and all that stuff the PlayStation has. So whatever.
2202720	2209280	Um, but I like, I like Sonic Mania. It's cool. Uh, it, it basically, it's basically what Sonic 4
2209280	2213600	should have been. I mean, that's what it is. It's, it's what Sonic 4 should have been. Uh,
2213600	2218960	so they're getting to it now. My, the only like tiny little complaint I can have about Sonic Mania
2218960	2224000	is that I feel like there's still a couple bugs in it. Like I beat a boss. Okay. I don't want to
2224000	2230320	spoil it, but at the end of the second, at the end of the, um, chemical plant zone, there's like a,
2230320	2236320	there's a boss where everybody's like, whoa, cool. You know, type of thing. Okay. I beat that boss
2236320	2241440	and got a game over screen. Like as soon as I like flew out of the boss fight, I got a game
2241440	2244240	over screen. I was like, what the hell did I like run out of time or something? What the hell
2244240	2248560	happened? So I thought that was weird. It was a weird bug. Um, but it's, it's fine. There's
2248560	2253280	tiny little bugs. It's they'll get patched. It's not too big a deal. Um, cause the bugs aren't
2253280	2258000	besides that one. It wasn't that big a deal. Uh, but the only other thing is that the bonus
2258000	2264000	rounds kind of show up almost too much. Like I felt like half the time I was playing that
2264880	2269440	bonus game from Sonic three with the blue spheres and the red spheres. Like I spent like half my
2269440	2273840	time playing that game, which I just started skipping them at some point. Like I don't even
2273840	2278480	bother to do those bonus games as much anymore. Cause I want to play the actual side scroller
2278480	2282800	game, which is great. And there's like, what I really like is that they'll do like green
2282800	2287520	Hills zone cause they have to cause it's Sonic. So they'll do that for the first for act one.
2287520	2291040	But then when they do act two, it's still green Hill zones, but they've put a new twist on it.
2291040	2294960	Like they added a zip line to it, like a new power up or something. It didn't exist before.
2294960	2298400	And they do that a lot in chemical plant zone too, where there's like all these new things
2298400	2302640	that weren't there before. So I thought that was, it makes chemical plants suck less. It does
2302640	2306800	believe it or not. It makes it suck less. I mean, it's, they still like, they keep some of the cool
2306800	2311200	stuff. Like, you know how like the ramps in chemical plant zone kind of looked like a helix,
2311200	2315600	like they still do that, but now they have like other power ups and things that make the zone more
2315600	2320320	interesting. So, um, yeah, I'm, I'm enjoying Sonic media. I think this would be right up
2320320	2324400	your alley, dark soccer. You guys should consider checking that out. It's been thinking about it.
2324400	2329200	Yeah. Um, let's see. Tiger claw and chat says, did you play with Sonic and tails?
2329200	2332560	Cause having tails around helps you get into certain places that are unreachable.
2332560	2336240	I have not played it that way yet, but I'm aware that that's a thing. Uh, come on,
2336240	2342320	no Gus and chat says, can you play us knuckles? Yes. You can select between Sonic knuckles,
2342320	2347920	tails or, um, Sonic and knuckles or Sonic and tails. I think the only thing you can't do is
2347920	2351680	tails and knuckles. And I might even be wrong on that. Cause I haven't played around with it as
2351680	2358240	much. So there you go. Um, yeah. So I do recommend Sonic mania if you're into like old school Sonic
2358240	2362640	games and Sonic's been kind of weird to you lately because it's only bit, it was only 20 bucks. So
2362640	2367920	it's a pretty good deal. So, um, yeah. Uh, good times on that. And then, uh, I played a little
2367920	2374560	bit of no man's sky cause the whole re imagining, um, I want to get it on PC, but they, I should say
2374560	2379520	smartly, I guess they bumped the price back up to 60 bucks after that little sale they had last
2379520	2382640	week. They put the price back up to six bucks. Yeah, I should have bought it. Yeah, I know. I
2382640	2386240	should have bought it during that sale. Just wait for this. Wait for the next steam sale.
2386240	2390000	There'll be another, I'm not that worried about it, but uh, yeah, they're, they're trying to cash
2390000	2394240	in on people that are like, Oh, I should revisit this game now because of the, uh, the changes and
2394240	2399920	all that stuff. Uh, a little bit of Overwatch as well. Uh, I think I did some streaming of
2399920	2404640	Overwatch the other night. Actually I did death match on PTR and I got my ass handed to me. It
2404640	2413520	was really bad. Um, but it was nice to like try it out. So, uh, yeah, that's it. Uh, Bobby Blackwolf
2413520	2417680	and chat says there's a secret mode to even do knuckles and knuckles. So I was, I was not even
2417680	2421760	aware of that. So there's some secrets I have yet to discover in the game. How about that?
2422560	2425200	But what would be the point of doing knuckles? Because you can,
2426480	2430640	what's the point of doing a lot of stuff in games because you can't. Anyway, uh, we're going to get
2430640	2435920	into news, but first some housekeeping. Uh, we're not going to be here the week after next because
2435920	2439520	dragon con I'm going to be at dragon con. Uh, so if you're going to be in the Atlanta area,
2439520	2443200	you should come check out dragon con. I'm going to be on several panels throughout the weekend.
2443200	2448960	We'll have the list all pointed and posted at vog network.com during this week. But I'm on like
2448960	2454240	three panels during the podcast track. Bobby's on like four or five, uh, and, and it's not just
2454240	2459120	limited to podcasting track because our pals over at critical myth, uh, Gary and John, they're on
2459120	2464720	several panels, uh, having to do with television. Um, and, uh, Brian from British invaders, big part
2464720	2469440	of the Brit track. He's on several panels over there. So there's lots of vog people to see. Um,
2469440	2474000	also something new we're going to try this year for dragon con because we just launched a few
2474000	2478560	weeks ago, our vog network discord. And if you're not there yet, you should check it out. Vog

2483760	2488640	don't be a jerk and you'll be fine. We don't ban people unless you need it. Um, so, um,
2489520	2495920	come to our discord server. We created a new channel called dragon con 2017, where if you're

2500960	2505760	if you want to like try to meet up with us. And for people not going to dragon con, we'll post
2505760	2510560	like some pictures and videos and little like bonus clips, things into the channel. So people
2510560	2514640	can kind of live vicariously through us. So hopefully that'll, that'll be fun. So, uh,

2525440	2529840	iTunes or wherever you found this show. All that stuff goes a long, long way. We appreciate it.
2529840	2537120	Let's get into some gaming news. So they're doing, uh, finally new too is coming to Pokemon go
2537840	2541920	and it's going to be coming via the raid battles of course, but it's a brand new type of raid
2541920	2550560	battle called exclusive raid battles. So, um, you, with that, I guess the way it's going to work is
2551520	2555360	assuming where these are going to come, cause it's going to be different places, but
2555920	2561200	if you have done a, you have to be invited to these battles and in order to get an invite,
2561200	2566080	you would have had to have completed a traditional raid battle at the location where it's supposed
2566080	2570880	to appear. So there's saying that you get an invite and they just, they let you know when
2572320	2577280	this, you know, event's going to happen. They're really not doing a good job explaining this.
2578080	2582080	No, they are not. They need to show screenshots. They need to walk through an example,
2582080	2587040	cause this is a weird system because how do I know which gyms I should be fighting? So,
2587040	2593360	I mean, in a way I think Niantic's being a little bit skeezy with this because that tells me you
2593360	2600160	need to play raids at as many gyms as possible. So buy more raid passes and I'm just like,
2600160	2604560	go to hell. You know what I mean? I mean, yes, you get a free raid pass every day,
2604560	2609040	a free raid pass every day. And if you're getting your coins, I guess you could get
2609840	2613680	others if you don't buy incubators or anything else. But I'm just a little bit like,
2613680	2617840	I'm a little side-eyed with Niantic right now. Like you need to explain this better because
2618880	2624400	also the infrastructure in Pokemon Go, like there's still a lot of garbage stuff happening
2624400	2630000	in the game. For example, yesterday, Alan and I went raiding downtown so we could try to get some
2630000	2633520	more, our friend JD was here. We had another friend we were raiding with. So there's a group
2633520	2637520	of four of us trying to go get some of the things like Lugia and Articuno and you know,
2637520	2640960	some of those things that are out right now. So we went to do a Lugia raid. No,
2640960	2645520	it wasn't Lugia, it was Articuno at one of the light rail stops downtown where Articuno
2645520	2652000	was spawned. And so we did the raid and there was 12 of us. Well, only 11 of us got in because what
2652000	2657120	happened? While Alan was trying to get into the battle, his game crashed. He used his raid pass
2657120	2662240	to get in there. And then the game crashed. He tried to bring it right back up as fast as
2662240	2666800	possible, but he was continuously getting network errors. So he couldn't get back into the game
2666800	2671840	right away. Finally, as soon as the raid battle's done, his network errors stop,
2671840	2676000	he gets in the game, but he gets none of the rewards and his raid pass has been spent.
2676560	2681600	So he can go back in and do another battle and we waited 30 minutes for more people to show up.
2681600	2686320	But I just thought that was a little garbage that you know, if you spend the raid pass to get in
2686320	2692400	there, because the phone and the network and all this stuff is still a little wonky and isn't rock
2692400	2697120	solid, you can still get screwed out of something. And I just can't, I just can't imagine that
2697120	2702400	happening with Mewtwo. People are going to be crazy about that stuff. And I remember I thought
2702400	2706000	of another time we were raiding outside this restaurant. We were doing, I think it was when
2706000	2711120	Zapdos was out and there was this seven year old kid who was trying to do this. And as soon as
2711120	2716320	Zapdos like died and it went into the catch thing, the little kid's phone crashed and he started
2716320	2721680	crying because he was like, I wanted to catch the Zapdos. And his like dad ran over and was like
2721680	2724960	trying to fix it. And I think they were able to get right back in and everything. But I was just
2724960	2731200	like, you know, I definitely had that moment of like, wow, these tech issues cause little kids to
2731200	2740000	cry. Good job Niantic, you're making kids cry. So I just feel like before they roll out this crazy
2740000	2745120	shit where it's like, well, in order to do this, you're going to have to align during the solar
2745120	2748960	eclipse. You're going to have to visit the second star on the right and head straight on until
2748960	2752960	morning. And then you have to make sure that you have the upgrade item over here and you have to
2752960	2756800	raid over here in this city. And then over here in this, before they roll out all these stupid rules,
2756800	2761840	like you need to like iron out the fucking game that you have because there's a lot to love about
2761840	2767600	Pokemon Go. There really is, but I would have a much easier time loving it if it would work
2769120	2776400	reliably. And it doesn't right now. So could you get on that first before you decide to do this
2776400	2781600	whole, now we're going to do an even crazier type of raid where probably even more people
2781600	2785600	are going to be there because we'll probably invite a hundred people to take on Mewtwo at
2785600	2790720	these. I'm just like, Oh God, I just, I just fear what this is going to look like. Now here's the
2790720	2797200	other interesting thing. It'll look like Chicago. Now here's the other interesting thing. If I did
2798080	2803040	this rolls out the 1st of September. Yeah. Okay. Guess we're going to be the 1st of September.
2803840	2810480	Atlanta, DragonCon. Now I see that there's good news and bad news. The good news is there's going
2810480	2815200	to be no fucking shortage of people to raid. That's a given. If one of those fuckers spawns
2815200	2819760	at the hotel at the stop of the hotel, like it's fucking on. But the other thing is I'm like, wait
2819760	2825280	a minute. If I'm going to be in Atlanta on the 1st of September, am I going to keep getting raid
2825280	2832320	invites back here in Sacramento? Because that part is going to fucking suck. So I'm going to be a
2832320	2837600	little peeved if like, don't worry. It's not coming to Sacramento. It's going to be like
2837600	2842800	central park, New York. And that way we can have, you know, the news thing of like Mewtwo will be
2842800	2848320	in more places than that, but it's just, you know, I I'm, I'm a little scared about this whole thing.
2848320	2856160	So we'll see. Let's see. Um, come on. No, Gus and chat says pokey. No, I'm not giving them another
2856160	2860560	dime. Uh, let's see. Dark Tetsuya says, I hope the Mewtwo thing is handled better than that
2860560	2865520	event. A few weeks back as to 100. Matt says I beat a Moltres earlier this week. The game
2865520	2870640	crashed during the bonus catch portion. When I got back in, it displayed it. Like I never beat it.
2870640	2875600	I tried to fight it again and it kept erring out. I lost my raid pass and got nothing to show for
2875600	2881760	it. Uh, and this gentleman continues central park is shit for Pokemon go playing. The game has a
2881760	2885840	hard time processing everything going on on there. Oh yeah. And it's spoo for central.
2886560	2892320	Exactly. It may be shit, but that means nothing to Niantic. It's just a location on a map for
2892320	2897760	them. Uh, pure 39 is no, I mean, I have an easier time playing in San Francisco at peer 39. I have
2897760	2904080	an easier time doing that with the little pogo plus and my phone off. Like, uh, because it
2904080	2908960	doesn't have to render all the other shit going on, like with the game up. Uh, cause one of my
2908960	2913200	friends that I was with his game kept crashing over and over and over again. But again, that
2913200	2917840	just goes back to the point of, look, I think it's great that Niantic has like got these new
2917840	2921760	ideas for the game and the gym stuff is really like neat now and all this other stuff. But like,
2921760	2928320	seriously Niantic fix the fucking game you have before trying to like go crazy with all these
2928320	2936720	flavors. Don't go crazy. Anyway, I can't wait for Ingress to be on this engine too. Well,
2936720	2941200	I don't know. At least there's a lot less people playing that Ingress is kind of over unless,
2941200	2944880	unless they do something really cool in 2.0 but Ingress is just getting really stale. But anyway,
2944880	2954800	that's, we got to catch these portal beasts and the containment and um, and there's going to be a,
2954800	2963360	um, uh, gym that you battle them. I just, I, I'm, you know, I still bring up Ingress once in a
2963360	2967120	while. Somebody asked me to do a favor, like bump their portals. Of course I'll do it. You know,
2967120	2970640	if I'm going to be there anyway, playing Pokemon too. But it's also one of the things where it's
2970640	2977520	just like, I kind of, if any game needs like an energy meter, Ingress needs it. I know that's not
2977520	2982320	a popular opinion, but no, I agree because there's people that dedicate their lives to that game
2982960	2989280	and that's not healthy for any game. No, I did not be waking up at two in the morning to spend
2989280	2993680	all day playing and then like literally all day playing. Jamie, you need an energy meter. What?
2993680	3000080	Me so that you can see when I'm low energy, I have to pay you $10 to recharge. Yes. You have
3000080	3006880	to pay me $10 to recharge or pizza or coffee, coffee. Anyhow, I offered you coffee. All right.
3006880	3010960	Yeah, I was already drinking soda. Moving on. Let's talk about, let's go back to Microsoft
3010960	3015360	and talk about more bad news for Microsoft. In fact, this could be the worst news of the entire
3015360	3021360	week. I don't know. You guys be the judge, but, uh, so Xbox one, uh, is getting a new game, uh,
3021360	3026880	that just came out this past week. Conan exiles. That's right. Now of course this game was already
3026880	3033360	on PC and why was this game famous on PC? Why did this game take over riveting gameplay?
3033360	3040960	It's just such a great MMO. That's right. That's right. Oh, and dongs everywhere. Dongs, dongs,
3040960	3049680	dongs, children, and yes, titties, the beave, all of it was all the children who can access
3049680	3057040	consoles, but can you decide how hairy it is? I, I don't know. I haven't played the game,
3057040	3062880	but I do know it did have it. The dogs had a meter and you could adjust the, I almost bought it
3062880	3067680	endowment. I almost bought it, but I bought Tacoma instead. That was probably a good choice.
3067680	3071840	I keep forgetting Tacoma came out. I need to play that anyway. But did they have dong meters in
3071840	3076240	Tacoma? Well, here's the problem. No, they do not. But, uh, you know, you gotta, you gotta make
3076240	3081440	tough decisions sometimes. Well, here's the thing. Uh, in America, the SRB rated Conan
3081440	3090320	exiles M for mature and not AO because in America only partial nudity will be allowed. However,
3090320	3096080	in Europe, uh, all that will be on display. So is the Xbox Xbox one region free? Cause if so,
3096080	3101120	you need to buy your copy of this game from Europe and then dong, new dong city everywhere.
3101760	3105920	Yeah. But the problem is I think is it's server base, isn't it? So I would assume
3105920	3112720	the game copies are all in MMO. So maybe if you're in a certain region, PC master race.
3112720	3118640	Well, anyway, uh, if you want to play this on, uh, Xbox one in America, you will be forced to
3118640	3123840	wear panties. You will be forced to put your panties on and play the game without your private
3123840	3129680	parts being everywhere on display. Why, why do we have to hide this from like, I mean they had dogs
3129680	3134400	and other games. I don't understand why it's such a big deal. Is it because children have accesses
3134400	3139120	because cause fucking retarded parents are like, I'm just going to, this is admin. It has adult
3139120	3144240	content new today. I'm going to buy it for my five year old over here. It's a member of America has
3144240	3148960	less of a problem with violence than they do with bit. It's a little more complicated than that
3148960	3154160	Loki because the AO rating, unfortunately, and I'm not, I'm just, I'm just telling you why I'm not
3154160	3160160	saying this is a good thing. Unfortunately, the AO rating is pretty much akin to the NC 17 rating.
3160160	3165440	And when you have an NC 17 rating, you're the movie, the theater will not show it. Blockbuster
3165440	3172320	won't rent it. Those few, those 10 blockbusters left in America won't rent it unless it's show
3172320	3178640	girls. Well, because it's edited down to an R rated version, um, which is what happened here.
3178640	3182560	And that's what happened in showgirls. They had to put panties on in showgirls. They had to draw
3182560	3187120	them on where that was the VH one in it. Right. So that's what happened here. They had to draw
3187120	3192240	on those fake panties and bras and things. They had to draw them on. I've actually,
3192240	3198720	I would play Conan exiles. If it looked like it did in the VH one show girls that it was like
3198720	3205600	that safe for porn videos, like playing the drums and like shit like that. Like it's drawn in MS.
3205600	3209920	Yeah, it is great. It's great. It's pretty bad. Anyway. Where was I? Oh yes. So the AO rating,
3209920	3215920	here's the problem with an AO rating. You can't stream the game on Twitch. GameStop won't sell
3215920	3220640	it. A lot of mailer major retail Walmart ain't going to sell it. Can you, can you stream the
3220640	3229600	PC version on Twitch? Yes. I know. I just say it. I'm just saying Twitch is, I mean,
3229600	3234480	again, I don't work for Twitch. Maybe they have a policy that I'm unclear on, but last I understood
3234480	3240000	it, the Twitch policy is if the game is rated AO, you can't stream it on Twitch. And they actually
3240000	3247600	have a list of games. And they also have certain indie games that are unrated that are also on the
3247600	3254000	list. Age of Conan is not one of those games that's on the list last I heard. If I'm wrong,
3254000	3257840	live chatters, please correct me on that. But I believe that's the difference. When a game's on
3257840	3263120	PC, Loki, it doesn't have to be rated. Games on console have to be rated. So I think Age of Conan
3263120	3269360	wasn't rated when it came out. And so dong, dong, dong, dong, dong, dong, everywhere. And now on the
3269360	3279600	console, you know, censorship. Forced underwear. Let's see. Come on, no Gus in chat says Twitch
3279600	3284160	doesn't like dongs, I thought. Well, they certainly don't like real dongs and let's make that clear
3284160	3288880	too. And that goes for lady parts too. So you are, you do, like they actually, I think like Twitch
3288880	3293840	has a rule that's like, put a goddamn shirt on. Like, I think they have a shirt on with,
3295120	3301200	it's still technically a shirt. It's just, you know, that v-neck, that v-neck that drops way
3301200	3307200	down. And I promise I won't wear it again. But what, what were they calling that sweater? The,
3307200	3314080	the manslayer or you mean the, the rompers? No, no, no. They had those sweaters for men,
3314080	3319360	the virgin killer. That was it. I don't, I don't even know what that is. No, it was like these
3319360	3325520	really low cut in the back. Am I allowed, am I allowed to wear a male romper on Twitch? No,
3325520	3334160	no one's allowed to wear a male romper. Fuck that. But you're stifling my artistic creativity
3334160	3339680	with my body as the canvas. If I were to wear a male romper full of kittens, I'm going to do it.
3339680	3344400	Oh, you can wear it full of kittens, but just wearing a male romper. No, no one in, no one.
3344400	3351040	No, no, never. Let's see, go into chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
3351040	3357360	Uh, Rob Roberts, Rama says to me in chat says, there are guys that can wear them too for
3357360	3363120	du-dwar. Are you, are you familiar with the trend that is du-dwar Dark Sakura?
3363120	3367680	I'd rather not. Well, you know, boudoir, right? If you know boudoir photography places, you know,
3367680	3371200	where, where housewives can get, you know, Christmas presents for their husbands.
3371200	3376240	I wouldn't know anything about that. Well, now dude war is, well, Loki,
3376240	3379440	maybe Mrs. Loki would like some dude war this holiday. I doubt it.
3380560	3385200	Unless they have models in hand that can take pictures because he's any,
3387760	3392240	if we can get that guy from, was it a criminal minds or whatever?
3392240	3398960	What, what, what guy from criminal minds? The black dude with the weird eyebrows.
3398960	3401920	I've never watched that show, so I have no idea. He's a pretty attractive guy.
3401920	3403840	Is he a attractive guy? A very attractive man.
3403840	3408160	All right. Nelly wants, Nelly wants dude war of that individual.
3408160	3414720	She'd rather have a dude war of that. And I don't blame her because he is a very attractive man.
3414720	3418960	He just needs to shave his eyebrows a little bit because he's got the unibrow going and it's just
3418960	3428000	not that hot. All right. Uh, anyway, uh, I don't, I don't know. Not, not Joe Manteca.
3428000	3432320	No, I don't even know where the hell I left off with this code and X files or X files,
3432320	3437680	Conan X files thing. Now wouldn't that be a game? Conan X files.
3439920	3440960	David company, man.
3443760	3447440	By the way, I posted the Virgin killer sweater in chat for you.
3447520	3451680	Sorry. Dark Tetsuya with the comment of the week. The dogs are out there.
3455360	3459200	Moving on now quickly. Dark Sakura, bring the mood down.
3461120	3466640	No, it's not a read on you. I just know I'm fully endorsing the Virgin killer sweaters.
3466640	3471120	Yes. I, I'm going to look this up and hope that it makes my day as opposed to
3471120	3475280	what dark version killer sweaters and not just Virgin killer. Cause that's like some
3475280	3478720	German death metal bat band. Well, German death metal is cool.
3479600	3482800	Okay. Everyone get ready to cry. Rob. I need to have music. Really.
3484240	3486960	You should prep. I, this is all the music I have.
3489360	3490800	It's going to be for every segment.
3492400	3496080	Um, the last update for mass effect Andromeda.
3496080	3499680	One point. Wait, I know what we haven't used in a long time. Dark Sakura.
3505280	3514400	Rick Ashley can team up with the moon fighters and make a new song.
3514400	3518560	Fuck you Bioware. Fuck you for this. I will never forgive you.
3518560	3520240	In the name of the moon, I will punish you.
3524480	3530480	The last update for mass effect Andromeda was the last for single player. There's no more future
3530480	3535120	patches for single player or in story content. Where are our quarians?
3535920	3540160	Fuck you. This is all lost in space.
3541280	3546880	This is all because of that stupid. What the, what the fuck is that game again? Anthem?
3547600	3554800	No. Well, yes and no. No, this is Twitter's fault. This is Twitter's fault. I blame Twitter.
3554800	3561200	I placed the blame on Twitter's doorstep. Let's not give Twitter the credit that's due
3561280	3564640	to the worst company in America. Several years in a row.
3564640	3568080	EA. Let's not, let's not let them out. There is that too.
3569120	3572960	Mass effect Andromeda could have been everything that the fans wanted,
3572960	3576640	but no, they short staffed and short changed it.
3577520	3583680	So the only party I am holding accountable to this is fucking EA.
3584880	3589680	I will not be buying Anthem. I will not play Anthem.
3589760	3595200	I will not look at anything about Anthem on the internet. I don't, it will not exist to me.
3595920	3600720	The last BioWare game I ever anticipate playing is whatever the next Dragon Age one is,
3600720	3602960	because I'm supporting franchises. Hello.
3605120	3612560	I do feel like this is some sort of like really bad breakup between myself and BioWare.
3612560	3619200	And like, if BioWare still wants to be able to like call me to hang out once in a while,
3619760	3624160	then BioWare needs to like prove their love for me. Does that make sense Dark Sakura?
3624160	3628720	BioWare needs to like right this wrong and Anthem ain't going to do it.
3629520	3637120	Now, if they've hired back Casey Hudson to like kind of do this over again and do a Mass Effect
3637120	3642080	game that, you know, isn't going to get eaten alive and will be given the time it needs to
3642080	3646880	incubate well and so forth and fight EA so that the game will be released when it's fucking good
3646880	3653120	and ready and not early like this game came out. Like if that is going to happen, then BioWare can
3653120	3663120	still call me once in a while and we can have fun. But as it is blocked. I am not going to buy Anthem
3663120	3670240	and I encourage other people not to buy it until we get something worthwhile in Mass Effect.
3670240	3673520	And you know, I'm sure there's going to be people, there's definitely going to be people
3673520	3679600	they're going to tweet or whatever, you know, say that is irrational. The Anthem is a different game.
3679600	3686720	This is irrational. It's because it exists at all. It's one of those things, though, that I go,
3686720	3692480	well, now they've got a track record. BioWare showing that they're not interested in supporting
3692480	3697680	games past a certain point. So maybe I'll have to think about that when Anthem comes out.
3697680	3702080	Is it a fully featured game? Because it's not likely to get much updates in the future,
3702960	3709200	like Mass Effect and Dragon Age used to. Yeah. So in Dragon Age, the Inquisition had really good
3709200	3715760	support. Yeah, I missed that BioWare. Where did they go? Isn't it a different BioWare team that
3715760	3722720	made this? Yeah. Well, they're gone now. That's why I said was. And I was, I didn't the NPD numbers
3722720	3726960	for last month come out? I know that's not on the show world tonight, but I swear I saw it.
3726960	3731360	Because there was a switch that outsold the PlayStation 4 and Xbox. Yes. I realize that's
3731360	3737440	a big headline. But if I recall, I was looking at the top 10 games sold list. Mass Effect Andromeda
3737440	3745120	was on the top 10 games sold list. It didn't even come out this month. But it's on sale. Okay. But
3745120	3749120	my point is, it's still one of the top 10 selling games in America. And that wasn't good enough?
3749840	3757920	No. I just don't understand it. Come on, Noel Gustin. Chat says Rob Roberts is the Sarah,
3757920	3763280	Jessica Parker, and EA is the Mr. Big. Is he making fun of my nose? I think it might be.
3763280	3767200	He's making a Jessica Jones reference. No, no, it's not Jessica Jones.
3767200	3770080	Sarah Jessica, like Sex and the City. Sex and the City. Mr. Big.
3770080	3773280	I don't even fucking watch that. Even I do that.
3773280	3777680	I've watched one episode of that show. And it was one where Kate Capshaw's character had a bad
3779040	3782560	chemical peel. That's all I remember about it was her chemical peel.
3782560	3789040	So ironic. I shouldn't tell the story. I'm just gonna say, years ago before Alan,
3789040	3796880	there was a gentleman that I was seeing that would watch that show a lot. And so I kind of
3796880	3803600	got subjected to that show that way. And ever since, I haven't watched it again. So I think
3803600	3807360	it's one of those like, what do they call that? The Pavlov Association type of thing?
3807360	3812320	That's what I have with Sex and the City. I see Sex and the City and I think, oh, yeah,
3812320	3813680	that guy. That's a show.
3814400	3819200	That's a show. All right. Anyway, let's see. DungeonBuster in chat says,
3819200	3823040	relegating all of that lore to an expanded universe format just feels as if they're
3823040	3827840	trying to pass the buck to a medium they won't have to really deal with. Oh, yes. Thank you.
3827840	3831600	That's a good thing to bring up there is that, and DungeonBuster posted this on Discord too.
3831600	3835200	And I remember seeing this, is that the Quarians and all this stuff,
3835200	3839280	because Dark Star, you asked what about the Quarian. Well, there will be a comic book or
3839280	3843760	there is going to be a novel or I don't know, whatever the fuck it is, but let's say a comic
3843760	3849920	book. So Dark Soccer, here's the question. Think about this before you answer. If a comic book is
3849920	3855920	to come out that says what happened to the Quarians, will you buy it to show support for
3855920	3861680	Mass Effect Andromeda or will you say, no, thank you because BioWare has turned your back on you?
3862560	3864720	I would buy anything in the Mass Effect franchise, of course.
3865440	3868800	Okay. That actually was not the answer I was expecting. So I'm glad I asked.
3869680	3873760	No, I was honestly expecting B. I would support the Mass Effect franchise.
3873760	3877280	Okay. No, that's great. That's why I asked. I stand corrected.
3878000	3885840	I just won't support Anthem because it's what took resources from the Mass Effect.
3885840	3890960	You're not going to support the new Miss America because you're all about the old Miss America,
3891920	3895280	I think. That's so terrible. I couldn't think of an analogy at all.
3898800	3905680	I will support the franchise that I like. Ooh, here's a good question from Tiger Claw.
3906640	3911280	What? Oh, I like that. I like this grill Jamie on her feelings. What if, but they're,
3911280	3915840	they're all valid feelings. You all have them too. What if Mass Effect was, thank you,
3915840	3920800	Brad from Pod Culture, much better analogy, new doctor versus old doctor. But I think a lot of
3920800	3924400	people are really into 13 right now. So I mean, we have to see an episode of the show to really
3924400	3928880	know more along the lines of we wrote the story for the DLC, but we don't want to pay
3928880	3934560	programmers to make it. So let's release a comic book. Oh, truth bomb. All right. Here's the
3934560	3939840	question from Tiger Claw. What if Mass Effect was given to another developer other than BioWare?
3941760	3950160	Okay. Hmm. I would say, I would say for me, it would depend on who's the talent behind it.
3950160	3953920	Thinking of it to a competent developer. Yeah. Who's doing it. Who's writing it.
3954000	3958800	Who's you know, is, is somebody from the old team still involved? Like who what's what's
3958800	3961440	To use the doctor who analogy. Okay.
3963920	3971840	It's the same reason why people who only liked the serials will still watch the new doctor who
3971840	3976400	it's why people who were completely disgusted with Moffat's writing
3976960	3982800	still endured it to watch something that they enjoyed. I hate Steven Moffat's writing and I
3982800	3989200	hated every, well, a good portion of the episodes that he wrote, but I kept watching until I was
3989200	3995680	just way too sick of it. You know, I'll put it that way. Okay. You know, I, I didn't, you know,
3995680	4000000	okay. I'll go back to another thing. I, Jessica Jones has been my favorite comic book character
4000000	4006960	since her conception in Alias and the Pulse. And I didn't really quite like how she was handled
4006960	4012800	during the civil war comics, but I read it anyway. And I picked up secret Avengers that
4012800	4018800	she was in because I wanted to read about the character. I've heard crappy X-Men comics because
4019520	4024240	I liked X-Men. So I'm just saying. All right. Uh, let's see.
4024240	4028400	And this isn't about you, Brad. It's about me. By the way. Come on. You did get, come on. No,
4028400	4033680	you got a little yass in chat from, come on, no Gus who says Moffat was garbage. All right. Mama,
4033680	4040640	this is garbage. Anyway, moving on. SS2-100 Matt in chat says to play devil's advocate.
4040640	4045440	It's not the people who are working on Anthem's fault about what happened to mass effect.
4045440	4051440	If the game doesn't sell, they may be cut because of poor sales. Okay. Two, two points to that
4051440	4056080	though. I actually will help in disputing this because I'm a little salty on Anthem as well,
4056080	4063200	because, well, one, we just talked about the MPD numbers and Andromeda is selling. So, I mean,
4063200	4067360	it's selling more than most games. Sale knows. Oh, I mean, maybe it's just not selling. I guess
4067360	4072560	what EA had set this expectations was set for it, but here's the thing with Anthem. Yes, it is
4072560	4078800	Anthem's fault because this, this mass effect was given to another studio so that the studio that
4078800	4084560	was doing mass effect could focus on Anthem. And apparently there was just not enough collaboration.
4084560	4089200	There's not enough. And didn't somebody from that team, the mass effect team go to the Anthem team?
4089760	4094480	Yeah. So yes, Anthem pulled resources from mass effect. So we're a little salty about it.
4095280	4103040	And the one to blame EA. EA. Exactly. So sorry. Anyway, just a little, just a little counterpoint
4103040	4106560	on that, but I realized there are going to be some people that are like, Moffat is still a
4106560	4113200	misogynist asshole. So whatever. All right, let's move on that note. More, more news, Loki. All
4113200	4123360	right. So, uh, we've got Nintendo, of course, um, doing a bundle for Splatoon 2. Yes. I know
4123360	4129040	it just came out, but they have a bundle that's coming soon. Um, next few months with some new
4129040	4134800	controller colors. Yay. So you can there, it's going to bundle the game along with the switch
4134800	4139920	and then a neon green and neon pink, uh, joy cons. And those are going to be coming.
4140560	4147600	It looks like, I want to say later this fall, uh, starting September 8th. So just
4148160	4154880	a little after the next Splatfest. Bummer that it's exclusive to one store.
4154880	4162080	Yep. It's exclusive to Walmart. At least it's not evil G. Still though. And I know people that want
4162080	4167600	those joy cons. Heck, one of my friends ordered those joy con, those colors from Japan. So we
4167600	4173120	could have them. And we all know who that is, but I mean, seriously, but it's, it's one of
4173120	4176240	those things where it's like, it would be nice if they would just release those joy cons in the U.S.
4176240	4181840	to anybody. Yeah. It's gonna be $379.99. So you're not really getting much of a discount there, but.
4182640	4188640	But let's be real. Splatoon is a great game. That's worth owning a Nintendo switch over.
4188640	4195600	I would say it's not a Zelda in terms of a system seller, but they're very different types of games.
4195600	4200320	And maybe there's something in Splatoon 2 for you that Zelda doesn't bring you such as competitive.
4200320	4203920	Now that I look at that, you know, cause the system itself is like what? $299?
4203920	4209920	Yeah. So that's actually more than buying the switch and the game by itself.
4209920	4213200	Doesn't it come with something else too? It comes with a carrying case.
4213200	4218080	Okay. Cause it comes with a carrying case pro controller or no, no, it doesn't have that amiibo.
4219120	4223360	No. Hmm. There's gotta be some it's carrying case or something sweetened in that pot.
4224000	4227120	Yeah. It's just, it's just a cheap ass carrying case that they have with it,
4227120	4228720	but you would think that'd be something to do with throw.
4229600	4235840	Act F says that case costs 20 to 30. So, so you're paying, it's a GameStop bundle base.
4235840	4239600	It's a forced GameStop bundle where you get a case you didn't ask for.
4239600	4242400	Whatever. I guess you don't have to buy this version of it.
4243440	4248400	All right. Uh, well, uh, yeah, I already have my switch, so this is not something I'm really
4248400	4252560	going to pick up, but, uh, you know, I might be into joy cons in different colors, although I
4252640	4258720	don't know. The only ones I've really liked are the arms yellow ones. And I'm not even super into
4258720	4264320	arms. Like I totally passed on that game, but I liked those arms yellow ones, but I see, I know
4264320	4268160	some people are totally against me on this. And this is maybe this will have to be a splat fest
4268160	4275200	they do in the future is team gray joy cons versus team color joy cons because the gray ones match
4275200	4279840	the rest of the system. And that is important as well to me, but I do like the yellow ones.
4279840	4285040	If I was going to get any joy cons, I get those yellow ones. So, all right. Anyhow, uh, let's
4285040	4290800	talk about some weird drama involving trophies. That's right on the PlayStation four, because
4290800	4297120	the upcoming game life is strange before the storm apparently had a trophy available,
4297120	4302480	but it was only available in the bonus episode episode with the more expensive deluxe edition,
4302480	4307840	meaning that the platinum trophy, which you get for getting all other trophies unattainable,
4307840	4314560	unless you bought the more expensive deluxe edition. Wow. Jerk move Square Enix. Although
4314560	4320240	to be fair, it looks like it is truly an oversight and not something that they intended to do because
4320240	4324480	they did come out and say it was a mistake. So they, it was not our intention to give the
4324480	4329360	platinum trophy via the optional bonus episode in the deluxe edition. And so we started speaking
4329360	4335360	to the parties about rectifying this. So my assumption is that I know that a PlayStation
4335440	4340240	can do this thing with trophies where that DLC goes into little plus sign things like
4340240	4345200	Diablo three just did this because, um, I had a hundred percent in Diablo three and got my
4345200	4350320	platinum trophies, but a couple of weeks ago, that a hundred percent dropped down to 85% or
4350320	4352720	something like that. And I was like, but I still have my platinum trophy. And I was like,
4352720	4357520	what the fuck? Well, it turns out because Diablo three released that necromancer pack.
4357520	4362880	They put new trophies in with the necromancer pack. So, but what they do is they do like,
4362880	4366480	when you go into the game, then there's like a little plus sign that you can click on for
4366480	4370320	the necromancer pack. So you don't need those trophies to get the platinum trophy, but there
4370320	4375760	are still more trophies. So I think games with big DLC and expansion packs, they do this little plus
4375760	4381120	sign. So maybe my assumption is that's what life is strange is going to do is turn this DLC into
4381120	4387280	a plus sign. So it won't be required for, um, that, that platinum trophy anymore. Cause you
4387280	4393120	know, some people take that trophy hunting real seriously. And especially in a story based game,
4393120	4399120	like life is strange where he, sometimes it's a little easier to get the trophies. Uh, people
4399120	4405040	go to those to get their platinum trophies. So anyway, of course you could always just enjoy the
4405040	4411440	game for the story or because the decent game, but, uh, I guess I'm talking crazy dark soccer.
4411440	4419680	What do you have for us? Tears, angry, angry, salty tears. More? No, not really. Um, there is
4419680	4426160	a game that, and I'm, I'm gonna be very terrible because it was suggested to me on tumblr and I'm
4426160	4432960	sorry who suggested it. I'm too lazy to go look. So, um, it's a Kickstarter right now for a game
4432960	4441840	called Necro cosmos, which is a Metroidvania in space type game. It kind of looks like it does
4441840	4451840	blaster mastery things and then has bullet hell things and like power ups and like emo-ness. Um,
4451840	4456480	and then you've got different stages or ways you can take through the game and you equip like
4456480	4462480	different DNA for your gun that lets you do different effects and stuff. And I was like,
4462560	4471760	is this going to be my answer to the guardian legend? Maybe. So, um, I, I, I, I put money on it.
4471760	4475280	I admit I put money on it. It is the second thing I put money on a Kickstarter for.
4476080	4483840	So the first one, how to pull boyfriend plushies. The second one, this game.
4484800	4490160	Wow. So you don't jump in on that stuff very often. Nope. I do have my plushies though.
4490480	4494960	Dungeon buster in chat says I played the demo for a Necro cosmos. It's neat,
4494960	4500960	but paying to save in the game is just to know for me. So paying to save, I guess it must be
4500960	4504800	something. Can you elaborate on that desert buster? Cause I must admit, I don't, I don't
4504800	4508960	know much about this game. It adds to the challenge. Oh, is it, uh, is this something
4508960	4514880	with like in-game currency or do we mean real money or in-game currency? Because I know my God,
4514880	4519760	that would be cruel. Uh, because that Ori and the blind forest, I was just playing. You have
4519760	4526080	to use energy to create a safe spot. So I mean, you have to spend a cabin in final fantasy.
4526080	4533040	Okay. In game. Oh, interesting. You pay in game currency, but the cost rises with every save.
4534640	4539360	It's interesting. Okay. You would think there'd be a mode where you could disable that though,
4539360	4544080	but that would be interesting for people that like, you know, like dark souls, it's dark souls
4544080	4551120	mode. Okay. All right. Interesting. All right. I'll have to check this out though. I'm a big
4551120	4556160	fan of Metroid type games and all that good stuff. So, all right. Uh, just a few more stories
4556160	4562800	for you guys than the classic game of the week. Loki. All right. So you may remember that recently
4562800	4569360	they had, uh, changed the name of battle net to, what did they change it to? Something else?
4569360	4573760	Blizzard launcher, something like that. And everyone thought, what the hell?
4573760	4578160	That's kind of stupid battle. It's been, you know, this name that we, it's been synonymous
4578160	4582640	for this for the longest time. Why the hell did you change it? You know, it's kind of confusing.
4583200	4589440	And so they went ahead and changed it back. So Blizzard made a comment saying we understood that
4589440	4594640	battle net stood for something special. It represents years of shared history and enjoyment,
4594640	4599760	community, and friendship for all of us and our players. The technology was never going away,
4599760	4606000	but after giving the branding change further consideration, we, and also hearing your feedback,
4606000	4611920	we are in agreement that the name should stay as well, which makes sense because
4613680	4619200	just like the new name was super the Blizzard launcher. I don't know. It's branding. Well,
4619200	4622880	I think a big part of it too, is that nobody would call it that they were still calling it battle.
4624000	4629360	That's true. Yeah. So some days you belong to your fans and that's what happens with that with
4629360	4634640	Blizzard sometimes. So I don't know when I was like, when they were considering changes,
4634640	4639920	they ever think like, do we really need to change it? I mean, I don't know why they had some
4639920	4645520	branding idea, I guess. I wonder if it wasn't related to destiny to coming into the launcher.
4646160	4650160	Maybe they were, they didn't want to call it battle net because of the whole destiny to
4650160	4656000	thing. I don't know. I just, I battle in destiny. No you do, but it's Blizzard's baby. I don't know.
4656000	4660000	It's still called the Blizzard launcher. So I don't know. I'm just, it was around the same
4660000	4665040	time. That's all I'm saying. So it was, could be related. All right. Well, speaking of Blizzard
4665040	4668400	games, I think this is kind of neat. This is something new that they've added into Twitch
4668400	4673200	and it's specific to a Blizzard game, specifically Overwatch. Although I think Hearthstone is getting
4673200	4678160	this as well, but I actually used this on Twitch today and I thought it was neat. So you can go on
4678160	4682960	to like, let's say you go onto the Twitch website. Doesn't work on the console versions or the app or
4682960	4686800	anything like that yet. But if you go to the website and you actually browse for Overwatch
4686800	4692720	streams, it'll actually allow you to filter the streams by what hero they're playing.
4693360	4698720	So if you want to see people who play Sombra, cause she's fucking awesome. You can filter for
4698720	4702960	Sombra and see people playing Sombra. And even when you're looking at the list, you'll actually
4702960	4708080	see a little picture of the hero and it shows you what that person is playing right now. Well,
4708080	4715040	how does it do this? Um, apparently, that's right. Dark magic. Um, no, apparently it's
4715040	4720800	because of this, uh, technology that was acquired by Twitch called clip mine. Uh,
4720800	4727760	clip mine had a deep learning video platform that recognizes in game objects, text and levels,
4727760	4733040	which are then selected via the sites filters. So the game kind of knows what hero you've picked
4733040	4737440	because it saw it on the hero select screen or it's noticing it in the corner where the hero
4737440	4740720	thing is or something like that. So I think that's kind of neat because if you go in and
4740720	4746560	you look at Overwatch streams, there's a billion of them. But sometimes, and I even say this, like,
4746560	4750560	I'm somebody who really enjoys playing Sombra. There's a reason I named her. I think she's
4750560	4754880	really good. She's hated by a lot of, um, Overwatch players because some people kind of
4754880	4758160	don't know how to play her. Like they'll just go in there, guns blazing, and that's not really how
4758160	4761600	you're supposed to do it. You're supposed to be stealthy, but I've kind of learned more about how
4761600	4766720	to play Sombra by watching other people play Sombra. And that's, you know, you can't always,
4766800	4771680	unless they put in the title of their stream Sombra competitive mode or something, I don't
4771680	4774960	know who they're playing. Well, now that's not gonna be a problem anymore. I can go in and look
4774960	4779680	for people playing that hero or maybe another hero I want to get better with that I don't know a lot
4779680	4786080	about. So, um, I thought that was kind of neat that you could search by hero. Um, uh, also in
4786080	4789840	Hearthstone, I think it's a very similar type of thing because in Hearthstone, you can play as
4789840	4794320	different, you know, heroes in Hearthstone and it's a very similar thing. I guess Hearthstone
4794320	4801360	will also let you go by game mode, player rank, and number of wins. So you can actually find
4801360	4805440	where are the super pro Hearthstone people, or in my case, where are the baddies?
4807440	4811040	Does Hearthstone let you see like who the biggest loser is currently streaming? Because that would
4811040	4817120	probably be me if I ever did Hearthstone. All right. Anyhow, there you go. Well, before we
4817120	4823440	were broadcasting our games, we were taking them over to friends' houses, playing cartridges, or
4823440	4828560	maybe even the age of CDs. We're gonna take a step back into the classic game of the week.
4830560	4834160	Dark Sakura's gonna open the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks,
4834160	4840320	hey, you little brat, come over here. Get off my lawn. Get off my lawn.
4840320	4844560	Get off my lawn and use this light gun. Go play this game. Dark Sakura,
4844560	4849760	what is the classic game of the week? The House of the Dead, which all I keep
4849840	4853760	thinking of is the House of the Dead 2. We're meeting, gee, over there.
4854560	4856480	I just think of the typing of the dead. Bad voice acting.
4856480	4860480	But that's fine. Well, I couldn't do typing of the dead before I do House of the Dead. Although
4860480	4863680	I think I've done typing of the dead. You probably did another episode, yeah.
4863680	4869760	Um, anyway, House of the Dead is a first person light gun game that was released by Sega in
4869760	4876720	September 13th, 1996. And then that was in Japan and internationally March 4th, 1997.
4877600	4881120	We had one at one of the arcades I worked at, briefly.
4883280	4893200	But basically, you use your light gun or mouse in the PC version to shoot at zombies and
4893200	4899520	monsterseses and things like that. And your life is set by a series of torches and whenever
4900240	4906160	you get hit or you shoot a hostage, you lose a torch. And then when all of your torches are gone,
4906640	4914320	you lose. You die. You get first aid packs during the game. They're either held by hostages or
4914320	4920880	they're just objects. Like, oh, look, look at that little rock. Oh, there's a first aid kit in the
4920880	4929840	rock. It's great. So yeah, it's like that. And you have different ways that you can act or not act
4929840	4939680	like, um, whether or not you save certain hostages or die or go. Oh, does it have talking?
4939680	4944880	Yeah, this video has talking. Fuck these videos that have talking! Fuck, look for House of the
4944880	4949360	Dead long play. I'll see what I can find, yeah. I'm sorry, because I just listened to like the
4949360	4952160	first few minutes of it. I was like, oh, this is great. Yeah, I didn't have it in the first
4952160	4956560	like minute and a half. Motherfucker. See, here's something that we don't have that would be awesome
4956560	4962240	with VR nowadays is I want like VR versions of these games. No. Because they're light gun games.
4965280	4973360	I found one. Okay, good. Thank you. Um, anyway, you were playing as, uh, an agent named G. Ooh.
4975120	4983840	Um, and, uh, Thomas Rogan to go save people because of reasons. Basically, um,
4984720	4992240	they're going there to see if they can find out what's going on, um, for, uh, this, uh, biochemist,
4992240	4997760	um, who apparently is going crazy because he's obsessed with life and death. And that's the story
4997760	5008960	there. Um, it had, uh, a lot of craziness go on, like, fighting, um, this pyrotechnic creature and,
5009120	5017200	and, uh, which ends up, like, killing the guy that made it and everything. And then you, uh,
5018480	5027200	basically have to go rescue Sophie, who is, uh, someone who is called, um, she's, uh,
5028720	5033600	Thomas Rogan's fiance, Sophie Richards. Like, where are they from? Some of these names.
5033600	5041120	But, like, spoiler, you get an alternate ending where she becomes a zombie. And then, um, you also
5041120	5047600	can leave the house without her. So, I guess. Um, but for all the versions that came out, um,
5048240	5053280	of course it was that era of SEGA where we were getting good Saturn games, hopefully.
5053280	5062240	So it came out on the Saturn and it came out on the PC. Um, and this game was actually considered
5062240	5069520	so obscene in, um, in Indianapolis where they were trying to ban certain video games, violent
5069520	5074480	video games. They tried to open a case about this saying that it was not protected under the First
5074480	5080880	Amendment because of its obscenity. Um, but basically the ban on the game was considered
5080880	5086640	unconstitutional. And, uh, the quote from Judge Posner, who was in charge of the case,
5087360	5093120	the most violent game in the record, The House of the Dead, depicts zombies being killed flamboyantly
5093120	5100960	with much suffering of limbs and effusion of blood. I love the words of this, but so stylized
5100960	5106720	and patently fictitious is the cartoon-like depiction that no one would suppose it obscene
5106720	5110880	in the sense in which a photograph of a person being decapitated might be seen as obscene.
5110880	5115680	It will not turn anyone's stomach. And I notice this video has, like, the blood color change to
5115680	5123760	green as well. Yeah. So anyway, um, there were those other ports. We had the Sega Saturn version
5123760	5131520	in 1998 and the Windows PC CD version by Sega. Um, they were kind of rushed and not great,
5131520	5136320	but they weren't bad. They're still fun to play. Um, and actually you can run the arcade version
5136320	5142240	now in the model 2 emulator. Um, the Sega Saturn version had a remixed soundtrack. Um,
5144080	5151840	and, uh, it's just a really good game. And of course later on, wasn't there like a movie?
5153200	5160000	Unfortunately. Wasn't there a Rob Zombie movie? Uwe Boll. No, Uwe Boll. No. Oh, I was, no, that was
5160000	5165280	House of a Thousand Corpses. Yes. Whatever. Not based on a game. Whatever.
5166400	5171200	So it had a bunch of suck that came out as a result. But House of the Dead 2 is a great game.
5171200	5175360	But then it had Typing of the Dead, which was fucking awesome. Yes, it was. Everything works
5175360	5180720	out in the end. And we have an OLR pack. Yes, that's right. Good plug. We need to do a new one.
5180720	5184560	We need to update it or something. There is, you know, it should be called, just so you know,
5184560	5188720	it's on the Steam marketplace and the Typing of the Dead on the Steam. Uh, we did it for
5188720	5193040	episode 600. So it was a while ago. It's time for a new one. But it was, yeah, I think update it for
5193040	5198800	episode 700. I think it should be the naughty phrases version, not like this cuss or anything,
5198800	5205360	but like you pooted. All right. Or like, I like big butts and I cannot lie or something.
5205360	5210560	Well, you can make it Dark Sakura. You don't want me to make it. It'll just be like,
5210560	5217440	Rob made me do this. All work and no play, make Dark Sakura dull. All right. Anyway,
5218000	5221760	we're going to take a break here. Classic Game of the Week, of course, once again,
5221760	5224480	the House of the Dead. All right, take a quick break. But when we come back,
5224480	5228720	there is more Orange Laundry to come, including several emails this week. Y'all made up for not
5228720	5232480	sending any, uh, the past couple of weeks. We're also going to talk about some other updates,
5232480	5237680	new PlayStation 4 firmware. So we're talking about that and we got a Konami story, but maybe
5237680	5240480	this one will be a little bit different for a change. We'll get to all that when we come
5240480	5251680	back with more of Orange Laundry right after this. Welcome back everybody to Orange
5252400	5258080	Radio Live tonight with episode number 697 of our show already in progress.
5258640	5262720	Talking a little bit about that eclipse tomorrow. And, um, unfortunately I don't get to see it
5262720	5266400	because I have daytime work commitments. Dark Sakura, you mentioned when we were doing our,
5266400	5270800	um, call with Bobby tonight, uh, you, you have a little time off work to go see the eclipse,
5270800	5275440	right? Cause we get to see, we're in like, what did they say? 60%, 80%. We're not going to see
5275440	5279200	it all. We're not in that part of the country. It's supposed to show up for us like at 10
5279200	5286000	something in the morning. Okay. Um, well, and I normally start my shift like around 10 30.
5286800	5297200	So I put in for like 45 minutes so that I could enjoy the view. It is a historical moment of
5297200	5302080	sorts, I suppose. Get to work, get coffee, do my job, and then go to the doctor. Go shopping for
5302080	5309760	plants. A total eclipse of the sun. I just, I really wish more than anything, I was going to
5309760	5314560	be on that boat where Bonnie Tyler is going to sing total eclipse of the heart during the eclipse.
5314560	5320640	Because like, look, I don't want to get too much into the fuckery of what's going on in the world
5320640	5325040	right now. Cause you all have a TV or an internet. You see like all this like crazy shit going on.
5325600	5330080	But like when I saw that story on Twitter come through where it's like, Bonnie Tyler is going
5330080	5334640	to sing total eclipse of the heart during the eclipse. I actually, I literally had that moment
5334640	5342240	of at least something somewhere is the way it is meant to be. You know what I mean? Like it's the
5342240	5346960	only good news I read all fucking week. Uh, Loki, are you doing anything for the eclipse stuff
5346960	5351040	tomorrow? I didn't really look at it. I don't have any glasses to see it. I mean, don't look at it
5351040	5357680	directly then. That means Loki is doing low key observation. Get out. No, I'll just stare at the
5357680	5363200	sun anyways. Cause I don't give a fuck. I'll wear sunglasses. I'll wear two pairs of sunglasses.
5363200	5366560	That's not going to be enough. You're going to go blind. You'll shoot your eye out.
5366560	5370720	Um, I'm actually, um, use your phone. That's what Jamie was suggesting. Yeah,
5370720	5375200	you can use your phone. You just can't use like an actual legit viewfinder because it will still
5375200	5381360	magnify and be direct sunlight. But, um, I'm considering getting like, I was trying to look
5381360	5386320	for welding goggles and everywhere except for Harbor freight was sold out, but even Harbor
5386320	5394080	freight wanted like 30 bucks for, well, for I was just checking online to see where some,
5394080	5398080	I'm sure they like the stores around here. Probably like the apartment stores and stuff.
5398080	5403360	Everybody sold out air, but everybody's got a piece of paper with like shit on. I mean,
5403360	5408000	come on. And they probably cost 10 cents to make and they're selling them for five bucks.
5408080	5414640	America. That's just capitalism. Uh, anyway. Yes. I, I'm with tiger claw. I think
5414640	5420320	nasa.gov will broadcast the eclipse. I'll just let the professionals handle it and I'll watch
5420320	5427360	on the telly on my 4k monitor. I'll watch the clips in 4k when I get home. There you go. I'll
5427360	5432000	watch the highlight reel. All right. Anyhow, we got to get into some other gaming news. We're
5432000	5438080	going to do some rapid fire news. Uh, Loki. All right. So there's a game that was on Kickstarter
5438080	5443280	finally made it out to early access on steam. And I think it's out now. I think it's out of
5443280	5448240	early access, but we happy few. It's a game that they kind of teased also during the Xbox conference.
5449040	5454880	And I think even the PlayStation conference during E3, well, uh, it is going to be coming out now,
5454880	5461680	uh, next year in 2018 being published by gearbox on April 13th is when you can expect that we
5461680	5467600	happy few. And for those not familiar with it is kind of this weird, um, almost like a Bioshock
5467600	5473920	type game set in the, like the sixties in this town where everyone's taking, uh, like these,
5473920	5479440	I want to say they're called like joy. It's like a drug to make them forget some tragic thing that
5479440	5485440	happened. And apparently you're a person that's not taking joy and they're out to murder you
5486000	5492720	because you're off your medication and fun. So it's like kind of a survival game, but like,
5492720	5501200	it's very, very creepy and British. So check it out. That's coming out next year. Um, of course,
5501200	5508720	you know, the, uh, PC version I think is out now, at least in early access. Uh, so you can
5508720	5515120	check it out now. I have it still and played it, but, um, so one of the games that's, you know,
5515120	5520880	they've been showing off that I'm just not getting into is as Marvel versus Capcom infinite.
5520880	5525360	And one of the problems with Marvel versus Capcom infinite was also that some of the player models
5526400	5530880	were a little weird looking based on the last trailer. So like one of those characters,
5530880	5536640	of course, was, uh, the model for Chung Lee. And it was just that the trailer before last,
5536640	5540400	which is all jacked up looking like, it's like, what the fuck did you do to her face?
5540400	5545920	Like, it's just all wrong. Um, so everyone's like, oh, this is going to be like a fucking,
5545920	5550400	you know, Mass Effect Andromeda situation where it's just all fucked up and rushed.
5551280	5556080	Thankfully there has been a new trailer to come out and it looks like they have corrected the
5556080	5562800	issue and fixed the model. So wait, wait, wait. Capcom's listening to feedback. I know it's
5562800	5569360	crazy. Now is the time to tweet them. Mega man, Mega man, Mega man. So, and then of course,
5569360	5574880	I guess Dante was another one that they, um, have kind of fixed as well. So
5575920	5581360	Capcom doing plastic surgery on, uh, on your video game. Favorite, you know,
5581360	5586240	on all your faves, favorite heroes. Yes. All right. Uh, this next story came from our
5586240	5590080	discord, uh, active submitted this on discord and you can submit stories throughout the week
5590080	5593840	too, over at our discord, vog, network.com slash discord. Now I'm apparently this is
5593840	5597520	something that happened in Mexico where it's where active is from. And, uh, did you know
5597520	5601760	office Depot apparently like gives away video games and stuff. I didn't realize this.
5603200	5608400	I think what it is is that these, these cards that had overwatch codes on them were meant for
5608400	5612640	new computers. I think that's what it was. And, and office Depot certainly sells computers,
5612640	5616320	but I just usually they sell office computers that probably can't, well,
5616320	5620960	overwatch doesn't take that much. Yeah, yeah. Well, anyway, apparently there was some weird
5620960	5626160	type of thing happening where for a little bit anyway, office Depot actually, uh, was
5626160	5632160	selling with the purchase of any HP ink cartridge, which, um, went as low as $6,
5633120	5638960	you actually got a full game code of overwatch from HP Hewlett Packard and office Depot.
5638960	5644560	And I can't play this on this printer. Well, apparently people like totally took advantage
5644560	5649120	of that system and got like 20 game keys. There's a picture on Reddit of just like a bag full of
5649120	5655440	keys and active confessed when he submitted this on discord that I may have, I may have gotten a
5655440	5662240	copy this way. So, uh, some people, uh, taking advantage of a little, little maybe unintended
5662240	5668560	loophole there courtesy of a Hewlett Packard and office Depot. So there you go. It does note that
5668560	5673760	the original promotion was supposed to be if you bought any computer or printer. So it wasn't
5673760	5679200	supposed to be like an HP cartridge. This would be a fucking HP computer. You got it. Whoopsie
5679200	5684400	Daisy. All right. Well enjoy. You know what, you know what though, as much as you might be going,
5684400	5689440	Oh my God, all this free, you know what, blizzard will still be selling loot boxes. They'll still,
5689440	5696400	they still got ways to make money. So don't, don't cry for them too much. All right. Uh, meanwhile,
5696400	5701840	it could be that night trap will be coming out to the switch. That's right. Uh, and this was all
5701840	5707680	through Twitter because, uh, there was a Twitter sent to a screaming villain. Think of the children.
5707680	5713360	I know us asking, how about a Nintendo switch physical version? And the response is I'd love
5713360	5720800	to get it on switch and really want to, but they declined, uh, to which response, uh, please DM me
5720800	5726080	an email address. Someone will contact you. And, uh, that was somebody, I guess, from inside
5726080	5732080	Nintendo or something that, uh, wanted to, uh, do that. So, uh, it could be that night trap will
5732080	5736800	come out on the switch after all, thanks to, I guess, a missed connection on Twitter or something
5736800	5740800	like that. Um, but I'm going to say something that's not going to make me popular with some
5740800	5746080	people and that's okay. I can handle it. Um, night trap is really fucking overrated. Like,
5746080	5750880	I don't know why all of a sudden this game is back in a bit while I do. It's the 25th anniversary,
5750880	5756320	but I just, it's, I think it's okay if it doesn't come out on the switch. It's all right. I'll live
5756320	5762320	my life. Think about the possibilities here. As we were talking about earlier, show girls and
5762320	5768480	the really shitty drawn Ms paint, you know, bras and panties. Oh God, here we go. What if, what if
5769360	5776560	you tap your amiibo on there and you have really shitty drawn, you know, Mario and you know,
5776560	5782080	inklings and Zelda, you can have the fucking master sword in that game drawn in all its Ms
5782080	5787280	paint glory. Thanks to Nintendo switch. Can't do that. Ain't fucking other console. I'll tell you
5787280	5796960	what. Well, Loki, I got one thing to say about that game of the year. So I'm buying 10. I'll
5796960	5803200	go to office Depot to get night trap on switch. Jamie, what do you have for us tonight?
5804800	5808160	Just the sadness that I realized that there was a sequel to show girls about penny.
5809360	5814960	Yes, but she completely funded that herself. And I know this because that actress, I thought you
5814960	5819760	were there that year. Weren't you there the year that penny was at the annual show girls screening
5819760	5825360	in the Castro. And she was pushing the sequel because, uh, she like financed it, started it,
5825360	5830480	produced it because when you're her, that's like the one famous thing you ever did was be in show
5830480	5837520	girls. So she has to milk it for all it's worth pool thrashing, because that's really, that's
5837520	5843600	going to be the decider. I must confess as I've seen the original show girls movie like 50 times.
5843600	5848480	And many of those with Jamie, by the way, I have never bothered to watch pennies from heaven.
5849440	5854800	Apparently parts of this, parts of the movie parodies, the original
5855360	5860480	and it's actually, um, some people say it's actually a decent movie.
5860480	5864800	It can be full on jaws at that point. I'll, I'll watch it. I'm seeing, I'm seeing in
5864800	5869760	chat over at live.com. Slidekick says, have we, how have we not had a show girls to party? Anyway,
5869760	5875120	you don't know. It's a reason. Okay. Now it's like it going to a Facebook post that nobody
5875120	5878720	else has seen besides you and I, uh, and maybe some other mutual friends of ours.
5878720	5881120	Now we have a reason for the Hello Kitty ice cream cake.
5882640	5888080	Pennies from heaven and Hello Kitty ice cream cake game buoy cross O L R. We're
5888080	5896080	going to make it happen. All right. Anyway, is it time for my news? Yes, it is. Okay.
5896080	5904080	So there are going to be, um, some, uh, uh, KOF stuff happening. We like King of Fighters,
5904080	5911600	King of Fighters 14. Wait, 14 already came out, didn't it? Yeah. Apparently there's going to be
5911600	5917520	some updates and then there's talk about King of Fighters 15 on the horizon.
5918240	5921520	This series that would never die. Dude, I like King of Fighters. Well,
5921520	5924960	I remember when the first one came out, I was like, Oh my God,
5924960	5932560	it actually is fatal fury characters and it doesn't suck. Um, also discord. I now have a new
5932560	5938320	bit of like for discord. You know why, you know, you finally joined the vog network discord. No,
5938320	5946880	I haven't actually button girl because there are banning Nazis. I'm not going to call them the
5946880	5954080	fucking outright. I'm going to fucking call them Nazis. They're getting banned, no longer supported.
5954080	5960480	Just remember they're Nazis. The old, right. They're not see the old, right.
5960480	5966800	I, I, yeah. All right. That's, that's fine. They're terrible people. Yes. They suck at
5966800	5973760	being humans. Yes. They should not exist. They should. You remember that something hard and
5973760	5977520	sandpapery. Yes. They should take that thing, grind it up, put it in liquid nitrogen and
5977520	5983760	shove it down their throats. So anyway, discord. Yes. Yes. Um, discord has been great for Pokemon
5983760	5988560	go rating sometimes and discord. It's not discord's fault when it's not, it's the people
5989200	5996720	and discord has said, fuck you. We're not hosting you piss off, right? Because yes, yes, there is.
5996720	6001040	There is freedom of speech in the constitution. However, freedom of speech is not freedom from
6001040	6005120	consequence and discord is a privately owned company and can do whatever. On top of that,
6005120	6013360	the freedom of speech only has to deal with government, uh, retaliation for things said
6013360	6017520	about the government. That the freedom of speech is what allows me to say
6017520	6021760	president Trump is a douche. It allows me to say that and I will not get arrested for saying that.
6021760	6026320	Thank you our service men and women who protect that right for me to be able to do that. However,
6026320	6031040	if you decide that, wow, Rob Roberts, he's kind of a dick and I don't want to work with him because
6031040	6035680	he just called president Trump a douche. If you want to do that, you have the right. That's not,
6035680	6039280	that has nothing to do with freedom of speech. The constitution says nothing about that.
6039280	6044880	That is consequence. I just, I don't get arrested for saying, and just because you are suffering
6044880	6050640	the consequences doesn't mean people are fucking oppressing you. All right. Mom.
6050640	6055760	Guys, you know, in chat says what's a discord. It is a, it's, it's kind of what I feel right now.
6057680	6062240	It's what you feel in your heart. It's a chat app that's gained a lot of steam. I feel like in the
6062240	6068800	past like six months. Um, because it is, it's, it's, if you know of Slack, well, I guess honestly,
6068800	6072720	the easiest way for me to say it, it's a modern day IRC, which I know is ironic because our chat
6072720	6078320	room that you guys are using right now is in IRC, but there's a reason why it's old timey.
6078320	6083360	I know there's a, we're all old, everybody behind VOG networks pushing 40 in one way or another.
6084080	6090400	So there's that. And, uh, you know, just the fact that, you know, IRC works if it ain't broke,
6090400	6093360	don't fix it, that whole sort of thing. But discord, you're explaining it because it is
6093360	6097920	kind of a newer version of that, a modern version of that, but it has integrated voice chat.
6097920	6102560	And the thing that I really like about it is that it's on the web and it's on your mobile phone.
6102960	6107680	Same, same across both sides. And that includes the voice chat, which apparently soon is going
6107680	6111920	to be video chat, which is going to be another big thing. Um, so it's been huge for organizing
6111920	6117520	raids and Pokemon go. And another place where discord is finding a lot of success right now,
6117520	6123520	Nintendo games, since Nintendo has kind of, you know, let's, let's be real. They dropped
6123520	6127920	the fucking ball on the splatoon thing. And I don't think anybody is hardly using the official
6128000	6133280	app. People are using discord to arrange matches and then chat during said matches, because,
6133280	6137120	you know, you can switch to another app and not lose the discord voice chat.
6138240	6143280	So that's one place I think discord has been gaining a lot. I think thanks to Pokemon go,
6143280	6147840	thanks to Nintendo, thanks to, you know, certain other gaming things, uh, it's been gaining a lot
6147840	6152480	in the gaming community and you'll probably find out about it sooner rather than later. And again,
6152480	6158480	I'm going to kind of say, if you're not on the VOG network discord, what a perfect opportunity
6158480	6162880	for you to check it out. And I think it is available in a web-based client too. If you're
6162880	6168160	like, I don't want to download, I don't want to do all that stuff. You then I think they just
6168160	6173120	rolled out a web-based thing, so you don't even have to do that. So, um, you have options. There
6173120	6178320	you go. So, all right. Yeah. SGL 100 Matt says I'm a big fan of Slack, but discord fits better
6178320	6183440	with VOG. Yeah. I like Slack too, but you know, what's awesome about discord. It's free and slack
6183440	6188720	it slack has a free version, but there's limitations. Uh, we use, when I was, um,
6188720	6193120	increasing a lot more, we Slack for that. And, um, it's limited. Like once you get to 10,000
6193120	6196800	messages, which believe it or not, you can hit that a lot sooner than you think on your server,
6196800	6200880	like you start losing it. And we were having a lot of problems with space because people were
6200880	6204960	uploading pictures, a lot of pictures, which, you know, you want to share pictures and all
6204960	6211040	that stuff. Right. Uh, but we were like filling up that the Slack server, so it, it can be
6211040	6216960	irritating. So, and Bobby Black Wolf says I use Slack for work. I don't want to use Slack for my
6216960	6223120	fun stuff too. Well said. All right. Uh, let's move on. Let's travel around the world and check
6223120	6229120	out what is in stores being released this week. Loki. All right. Um, so we do have some stuff
6229120	6236320	coming out this week. Uh, we've got starting off with, um, chroma gun on PlayStation four, uh,
6236320	6243680	mages of miss Australia on PlayStation four, uh, Minecraft story mode on Nintendo switch,
6244400	6252160	the escapists two on PC, PlayStation four and Xbox one uncharted lost legacy on PlayStation four,
6252880	6260080	a white day, a labyrinth named school on PC and PlayStation four, and then a lost child
6260080	6268800	on PlayStation four and Vita. And then finally we've got, let's see at F1 2017 PC PlayStation
6268800	6278560	four, Xbox one Madden NFL 18 on PlayStation four and Xbox one. And let's see Naruto Shippuden
6278560	6285440	ultimate ninja storm legacy on PC, PlayStation four and Xbox one. And last but not least one
6285440	6291040	piece unlimited world red deluxe edition on PC and PlayStation four. That is it.
6291760	6295600	Let's travel to Japan and check out some of the releases there. Uh, in Japan this week,
6295600	6300880	a game called Shin Yoma Wari from Nippon Ichi is coming out this week. That's available in two
6300880	6306800	additions in Japan. Uh, also coming out this week from compile heart Shin Jigen game Neptune
6306800	6312080	Veer victory to realize is out this week. That is also a PlayStation VR game. So you can check
6312080	6317360	that out. Uh, and then there's a few other games too. The lost child is out in Japan this week,
6317360	6323760	as well as white day, a labyrinth named school. Yes. Sometimes school felt like elaborate to me.
6323760	6328000	This game looks like it might be more like a horror game. Yeah. It's a first person
6328000	6332720	Korean survival horror considered by many be the scariest game in history. Ooh,
6332720	6336000	I did not. Do you know this game? I don't know this game. White day,
6336000	6340400	a labyrinth named school. Apparently some cult classic first person Korean horror game
6340400	6346560	that's being remastered here this week. Oh, neat. It was on my list. Cool. All right. Maybe that's
6346560	6350720	something I'll have to ask my horror game fans about. See if that's something to know. Uh, yeah.
6350720	6357040	MXC says it first came out in 2001. So that's okay. This is a very old game getting an update
6357040	6361440	there. So that's neat. Uh, MXC says it's the remake coming to PS4 and PC. Well, that's cool.
6362000	6367600	All right. Uh, the Vita still has releases in Japan. And this week we have Futagosa no paradox,
6367600	6372000	starry sky autumn stories, as well as the lost child is there as well. And
6372000	6379280	Shim Yomawari is out on the Vita as well on the Nintendo switch. It has a release this week. Yes,
6379280	6385040	it does. One piece unlimited world. Our deluxe edition from Bandai Namco is out this week and,
6385040	6391040	uh, kind of a big deal monster Hunter double X. The Nintendo switch version is out from Capcom
6391040	6398240	on August the 25th, a day later. So check that out. Uh, looking at the 3DS, uh, nothing new on
6398240	6402640	the 3DS this week. And that's probably because of monster Hunter kind of monopolizing the Nintendo
6402640	6410880	releases this week. All right. Let's move on to the UK dark Sakura. We have on the 21st thimbleweed
6410880	6419040	park, um, for PlayStation four on the 23rd bleed for the Sony devices, um, being the PS4 pro and
6419040	6426640	the PS4 on the 24th, we have bleed for the X-Box systems, um, cook serve delicious two for PC
6427600	6437200	path of exile for X-Box one Minecraft story mode for switch on the 25th. We have F1 2017 on a bunch
6437200	6446880	of stuff and Madden NFL 18, blah, blah, blah, blah, nothing, nothing to get too excited about
6446880	6454000	this week. She's turned into the parents on the Charlie Brown Thanksgiving special. All right,
6454640	6459040	let's get to the mailbag and listen to your what, what was, but we'd love to hear your what,
6459040	6463040	what was, so we're going to hear them now participate at orange launch radio.com
6463600	6467840	is the place to send your emails. Oh, but before we get to emails, I have a couple of
6467840	6472560	quick things I need to say. So I got an email that we're not going to read tonight because I
6472560	6476720	think it was a personal email. I'm not sure it was meant for air, but thank you for that
6477600	6482960	actually responded personally to that person and, uh, said what I want to say. Um, however,
6482960	6487200	that email made me realize, cause they said, I tried to contact you through the website and I
6487200	6490640	was like, what do you mean? You tried to wait a minute. And I was like, it's not fog network.
6490640	6494800	That one works. Oh shit. It's the orange on radio site. And I went on, I looked,
6494800	6500720	Oh my God, the contact us forum on the orange on radio website was sending everything to mailbag
6500720	6504880	the old address. So for how long has it been since we switched like two years ago?
6504880	6509200	How long has it been since I've kept his website? Yeah, well that's another issue.
6509200	6514160	And how many emails do we miss again? Again, I would really love to update the website,
6514160	6519440	but that's time and money that I don't have. So I'm, I'm looking at dark soccer going, please.
6519440	6522720	So hopefully that's something that can be worked on. But anyway, besides that,
6522720	6528400	so yeah, we had stuff going back to, cause there is a log in there. We had like at least over the
6528400	6535200	past year, there's like 20 things we missed. So I just want to give a big shit. I'm sorry.
6535200	6539520	May I call like, sorry, you guys, I did not mean to overlook all those things that you guys are
6539520	6545120	submitting through the website. It was an honest mistake. And I felt really fucking stupid when I
6545120	6552000	saw that, but it took this long for somebody to tell me about it. So I guess you weren't that
6552000	6555760	upset that we weren't reading your emails that you submitted on the website or you figured it out
6555840	6559360	and just send them to ParticipateAtOrangeLoungeRadio.com. For what it's worth,
6559920	6563760	I fixed the website. So if you do do that in the future, it'll be fine.
6563760	6564800	You said doo doo.
6565600	6571040	However, I would just encourage you to use your favorite emailing application, such as Gmail,
6571040	6578000	Yahoo, whatever it is you use and just email ParticipateAtOrangeLoungeRadio.com. So there it
6578000	6585040	is. Now back to your regularly scheduled emails. Oh balls, where am I?
6586320	6587280	We have like four emails.
6588880	6589840	Yes. Make her work.
6590720	6593920	No, I have throat problems. Hello, LR.
6595040	6595600	What?
6595600	6598800	I was going to make a joke and then I said, no, don't be crass.
6598800	6601920	Keep it, keep it classy here at OLR. I'm keeping it classy.
6603760	6606240	Read the email, please.
6606240	6612240	Girl, I realize that I'm being at least as predictable as a poorly written CBS primetime
6612240	6616880	procedural. But when you mentioned the Xbox Live Creators Collection last week,
6616880	6620400	certainly you knew that like clockwork and email from YYYR would show up.
6620400	6621200	Hi, YYYR.
6622320	6627520	He's also the only one who does Hello, LR. When you mentioned it on the last show,
6627520	6630720	it came across like an announcement for something coming soon. Actually,
6630720	6633360	the program has already launched. Exclamation point.
6633360	6636080	I actually didn't realize that. That's neat.
6636080	6641440	You can browse and buy Creators Collection games on your Xbox One right now. In fact,
6642000	6645680	he uses double spaces. I just realized that.
6645680	6646720	Are you okay?
6646720	6651360	Well, no, it's just they're not required anymore for electronic thing. It's a leftover from
6651360	6655760	typewriting. So it makes me think that YYYR might have taken typewriting in high school.
6656480	6658160	And that will be the email we'll get next week.
6658800	6659300	Yes.
6659840	6660400	Did Mavis Beacon-
6660400	6661280	You can tell.
6661280	6663040	Did Mavis Beacon teach you how to type?
6663920	6668960	You can tell. There are tells. In fact, the only reason I'm not in the process of releasing
6668960	6673680	one at this very moment is because as you're reading this, I'm on a very large boat sailing
6673680	6676800	in the general direction of Alaska. Is that bad timing or what?
6676800	6680000	Are you on that fucking cruise where Bonnie Tyler is going to sing? Because if so,
6680000	6682320	I'm so jealous. I'm so jealous.
6683280	6686720	You will, however, see a couple of my titles up there very soon.
6686720	6692800	The first two will be Falling Plus and Pixel Poops. Yes, you will soon be able to experience
6692800	6696080	Pixel Poops and stunning 4K.
6696080	6696880	Yes.
6696880	6697760	Or something like that.
6699280	6702880	The game simulates a resolution of about 12 by nothing anyway.
6704640	6707920	Even better, I plan to release it such that you can play it for free
6707920	6711840	and pay 99 cents only if you want to, which seems to be an option in the store.
6711840	6714720	99 cents every time you have to go to Taco Bell. I mean,
6714720	6716000	taco restaurant.
6716640	6718640	Whatever he called it in the game, yeah.
6718640	6719840	Could call it Toxic Hell.
6720640	6721760	Burrito Horn.
6721760	6722320	But I didn't-
6722320	6724880	Burrito- I like it. Burrito Horn.
6725840	6730640	Uh, I really like though that it allows you to do this where it's like you get it for free,
6730640	6731600	but pay if you want.
6731600	6732720	Chimichanga, cowbell.
6734080	6734640	Moving on.
6736480	6740480	Oh, and Bobby Blackwolf says Bonnie Tyler's cruise is on the East Coast,
6740480	6744000	so YYR lives to see another day. However, if he is on the boat tomorrow,
6744000	6747520	that means he's going to be out there when the eclipse happens. That's pretty fucking rad.
6747520	6749680	So, pictures or it didn't happen.
6751760	6753520	Sorry, am I boring you, Dark Sakura?
6753520	6756320	No, I- I got four hours of sleep last night.
6756320	6757200	I understand. All right.
6757200	6760560	It was terrible because I'd listen to Dan Snore the whole time.
6761200	6762240	I don't know what that's like.
6764320	6767360	One of the- I just- I just punch him and he stops for like five seconds.
6768160	6771920	One of the really cool things about the Creator's Collection is that you can use many different
6771920	6776640	popular frameworks to produce your games, such as Mono Game, the free and open source version of
6776640	6779760	XNA, the popular Unity, and several others.
6779760	6782000	I didn't hear you say ZZT, so I don't know.
6782880	6785920	Seriously, people will check it out. That means you two Loki, eventually.
6787120	6793280	I just- as soon as my brain decides to cooperate with whatever other part of my brain is saying,
6793280	6797040	goddamn it, program something, then yeah, we'll be on board.
6797040	6802480	But apparently I have a brain separation where it's like, no, I want to watch YouTube.
6803760	6807120	And that's just not happening. It's like my wife is in my brain.
6807120	6810880	You may continue.
6813440	6813920	Are you sure?
6814480	6815280	I think so.
6816480	6818400	Loki is not allowed to interrupt you.
6818400	6819120	Now you did it!
6819760	6822240	Loki is not allowed to interrupt you. I can do it whenever I want.
6822240	6822560	Bitch.
6822560	6825120	Loki is not allowed to interrupt you until he programs something.
6825120	6826800	For every line of code, he may interrupt.
6826800	6827280	All right, anyway.
6828160	6828480	All right.
6828480	6830160	Quiet! All right, go ahead.
6830160	6831680	I'll end with two quick things.
6831680	6834560	One, if you enjoyed Sonic 3 & Knuckles back in the day,
6834560	6836640	and yet are on the fence about buying Sonic Mania,
6836720	6838320	you seriously should just buy it.
6838320	6841360	It's essentially the direct sequel to Sonic 3 & Knuckles.
6841360	6844880	I'm not going to say, if you like Sonic on Genesis, you will love Mania,
6844880	6849280	but the three numbered Sonic games on Genesis all played a little bit differently,
6849280	6851200	and everyone has their favorites.
6851200	6854000	But if you liked Sonic 3 & Knuckles, you will love Mania.
6854560	6856080	That I can say with certainty.
6856080	6859360	Drop the 20 bucks, put on your red shoes, and get running.
6859360	6860080	Agree.
6860080	6864080	Thing number two, and that is for Rob, if they have internet where you're-
6864160	6868960	Oh, well, thing number two, and that is-
6868960	6870400	I don't know if I should read this part.
6871600	6872160	Go ahead.
6872160	6872660	Okay.
6873440	6873920	Is it-
6873920	6875600	Does it have to do with last week's intro?
6875600	6876080	Yeah.
6876080	6876400	Let's-
6876400	6876720	Go ahead.
6876720	6877040	It's fine.
6877040	6877600	I can handle it.
6877600	6878320	Okay.
6878320	6880240	Thing number two, and this is for Rob,
6880240	6882080	if they have internet where your mom is,
6882080	6884640	I can personally guarantee that she loved the intro.
6884640	6885680	I did too.
6885680	6888800	And I hope to see your smile in New York area at some point next year.
6888800	6889360	Take your time.
6890400	6891040	Thank you for that.
6891040	6891920	I appreciate it.
6891920	6897040	Hugs, Aaron YYR, with a big legal disclaimer at the end.
6897040	6898720	He's sent from a work address.
6898720	6899840	I ain't reading that.
6899840	6900800	Sent from a work address.
6901520	6903280	What are you doing emailing people from work, dude?
6903840	6907920	Come on, Noel Gustin Chat says Dark Sakura's sass meter is going up and up.
6907920	6913840	Well, she wants to finish her damn emails so she can get back to Facebook or whatever it's alt-tabbed on.
6913840	6914560	Seriously.
6915760	6918320	You know what's great about being a woman right now?
6918320	6922080	I can put the mic on my boobs and I don't have to use my hands.
6922080	6923200	I can do that too.
6923200	6923600	Oh, wait.
6923600	6924560	I shouldn't brag about that.
6926960	6930720	Remember that time I put a beer in my shirt and it exploded in my face?
6931600	6932480	That wasn't a man.
6933200	6936480	Apparently we're all sharing stories we shouldn't be tonight on OLR.
6936480	6938800	That was funny because I was really drunk.
6938800	6942800	It was at Amanda and Tom's wedding.
6942800	6948560	Anyway, I'm just feeling like reminiscing.
6951120	6951840	Next email.
6952480	6953520	I was trying to.
6955840	6956080	Fuck.
6958400	6962400	I should have had this ready for your return, but last month or so Level 5 released a new
6962400	6964080	Professor Layton game for mobile.
6964080	6967920	It's $16 price point would be irresistible for a 3DS game.
6967920	6971280	I do not currently have a 3DS, but I've yet to pick it up myself.
6971280	6975440	I did, however, redownload their last title Layton Brothers Mysterious Room.
6975440	6980960	It's been over four years since I played that on my fourth gen iPod touch, and so I had
6980960	6983600	fortunately forgotten most of the plot points.
6983600	6988400	It plays more like a Phoenix Wright game than a Layton game, a Professor Layton game, which
6988400	6990080	isn't really that bad a thing.
6990080	6994400	Each of the cases, save for case zero, which serves only to set the scene of the game,
6994400	6999920	involves examining a reconstruction of a murder scene to find clues used to find inconsistencies
6999920	7001440	in suspect statements.
7001440	7004800	All in all, a pretty engaging title, lasting about ten hours.
7004800	7009120	I have seen footage of Layton's mysterious journey, which has full animation and voice
7009120	7011200	acting, which Mystery Room does not.
7011200	7018080	I'd give Room around four out of five, and will probably purchase Journey sooner rather
7018080	7018800	than later.
7018800	7019360	Robert M.
7019920	7020400	P.S.
7020400	7026720	As a hopelessly geeky pun, how did Bob Marley mod his computer games?
7026720	7028160	He edited the INI file.
7029920	7031760	Okay.
7031760	7034960	Boy, you're all a bunch of comics tonight here at OLR, aren't you?
7036320	7038560	Anyway, thank you for that brief review.
7038560	7044880	Uh, we have another one from Y-Y-R, doo doo doo doo doo doo.
7046320	7047360	Hello, LR, again.
7048160	7049200	Thank you, again.
7050080	7054320	I listened to the end of last week's show after sending my email, and then heard you
7054320	7057040	mention Tempest 4000, so here's another one.
7057120	7063520	You may recall a Jeff Minter game that came out for Vita called TXK.
7063520	7064800	Yes, I have it.
7064800	7066000	It's so good.
7066000	7067920	It was basically New Tempest.
7067920	7074000	Then you may recall that he was working on a PS4 and VR versions of TXK, and that Atari
7074000	7077440	sent Jeff a cease and desist letter before it could be re-released.
7077440	7081760	There's strong evidence, including recent tweets from Minter himself, to suggest that
7081760	7084400	Tempest 4000 is just a rebranded TXK.
7084400	7085520	So they kissed him ate up.
7086320	7088080	Perhaps with some slight modifications.
7088080	7089520	Not that this is bad news.
7089520	7090880	TXK is fantastic.
7090880	7091680	Yes, it is.
7092240	7096720	So if you want to know how the New Tempest is going to look, it's going to play, etc.,
7096720	7098160	then just play TXK.
7099120	7101040	And when it comes out, you should buy it.
7101040	7101760	Just saying.
7101760	7103360	Okay, that's it for me this week, I promise.
7103360	7104880	Have a great week, Aaron Y-Y-R.
7104880	7107040	If I can find a duster for my Vita, I will.
7108240	7111040	You know, we've been playing it on our PSTV.
7111040	7112880	Oh, right, because you have that whole thing, sure.
7112880	7114800	Yeah, I have that somewhere.
7114960	7115840	Remember those things?
7115840	7118960	I don't know where it is, but it looks really good on our TV.
7119760	7122480	So last email.
7124960	7126480	Good evening, OLR.
7126480	7128320	I hope you three are doing well.
7128320	7129360	Welcome back.
7129360	7132160	I've been I've been missed you guys.
7132160	7134320	What was the voice change all of a sudden?
7134320	7138240	Like all of a sudden you became like the operator when I call the 800 thing.
7138240	7141280	Hello, and thank you for emailing, OLR.
7141280	7143680	To reach an operator, press zero.
7143680	7145280	To proceed for reasons.
7145280	7145780	All right.
7150080	7157520	Okay, about two months ago, I had sent an email to you guys regarding the Xbox One X reveal at E3.
7157520	7161760	I stated that I'm better off building a PC than getting the console.
7161760	7165200	Well, I wound up preordering the Scorpio edition of the Xbox One X.
7165200	7166160	Congrats on getting it.
7166960	7172160	I guess it's more of a case of I want to latest and greatest.
7173680	7175360	I'm I'm reading it verbatim.
7176240	7180080	However, I did rebuild my PC, and that's pretty damn nice as well.
7180080	7183360	Guess you can say I'm future proofing everything in this mofo.
7184480	7190320	I watched the Xbox Game Cons conference earlier today, and it was pretty much a cringe fest
7190320	7196560	filled with crappy jokes, awkward ass singing, trailers we've seen, we've all seen before,
7196560	7199600	and the annoying world premiere announcement and so forth.
7199600	7204400	Sitting through all of that just to hear a five minute preorder announcement for the X is just baffling.
7205040	7210720	Lastly, I wound up getting a Res Plus, a Nintendo clone with an HDMI output.
7211280	7214640	I wound up returning it back to Amazon due to game incompatibility,
7214640	7217440	no support for flash carts, and inaccurate sound.
7217440	7217940	Avoid.
7218720	7219440	That's too bad.
7219440	7220560	Hope you guys are doing well.
7220560	7221360	Take care.
7221360	7221860	Tristan.
7222400	7223280	Thank you for the email.
7224160	7229280	I didn't think the event was that terrible, but I also only watched 15 minutes of it.
7229680	7233280	When I started to see trailers that they've already shown us, I turned it off.
7234640	7237920	And I was like, I've seen enough of this to get my mix pot from Mixer.
7237920	7242000	My favorite though, unlike, you know, it was World Exclusive Trailer.
7242000	7245120	It's like an advertisement for the Xbox One X.
7245120	7248400	It's like, who cares?
7248960	7250240	This is stupid.
7250240	7251040	I get you.
7251040	7252400	World Exclusive Trailer.
7252400	7253440	It's like, okay.
7253440	7254800	Well, it is interesting.
7254800	7256960	So our emailer here is how to change a heart.
7256960	7262400	Had previously decided I'm going to go PC route, but I got to, despite the fact I hated
7262400	7266160	that conference, I just tempted to buy an Xbox One X anyway.
7266160	7267920	So Microsoft didn't really use with user.
7268720	7274560	But anyway, all that, all that aside, um, it did remind me of something we didn't really
7274560	7277600	bring up during the opening segment tonight that I kind of wanted to address.
7277600	7280560	And that was the whole, who is the Xbox One X really for?
7280560	7285120	Because I know Loki and I are sitting here going, well, you know, we're just more into
7285120	7286320	the PC side of things.
7286320	7288000	Why do we need an Xbox One X?
7288000	7293200	But you know, we're also geeks who build computers and have top of the line computers.
7293200	7294560	Not everybody has that.
7294560	7299680	So is there a large, is there a large enough audience for people that are like, I don't
7299680	7300640	need a PC.
7301360	7306240	I don't want to spend money on a PC, but I want to play Madden and 4k.
7307040	7308720	Is that a 4 or whatever?
7308720	7309920	Is that audience going to be there?
7310560	7313760	Yeah, I think there'll be some people that I don't think it's going to be as big right
7313760	7317760	now, because look at, like, for example, look at the PlayStation 4 Pro.
7317760	7323120	I mean, I don't think there's really been a lot of like, you have the Xbox One at, you
7323120	7324400	know, S that's out there now.
7324400	7328880	And you can buy that if you don't have a 4k television or something, then you don't really
7328880	7330400	need that cutting edge technology.
7330400	7335680	And honestly, like, I think the differences between the 4k presentation and what they
7335680	7340640	have available, it's a, it's a great system, but I don't really need that right now.
7340640	7342080	Cause I have nothing to display it on.
7342080	7344720	Like my monitor on my laptop is 1080.
7344720	7346800	That's, that's all I'm going to get out of that.
7346800	7348000	My TV is 1080.
7348800	7349040	Yeah.
7349040	7352960	I don't need to buy all this extra horsepower to pump out a little extra detail.
7352960	7353760	It's just not worth it.
7353760	7356800	Like that's why I'm not getting a pro pro for me.
7356800	7360960	It would be good for like VR, but I don't really want to sync anymore in the PlayStation
7360960	7367040	VR because I'm cautious that they're just going to release a new version of it like
7367040	7368560	in probably years time.
7368560	7369840	So I don't know.
7370720	7371120	All right.
7371840	7373600	Well, thank you for the email nonetheless.
7373600	7378000	And let us know what you think of the Xbox One X once you get your hands on it, since
7378000	7382000	you got one of these little project Scorpio ones that are already gone.
7382000	7382880	So, all right.
7382880	7386080	Well, I guess that's good for Microsoft that they went that fast.
7386080	7388000	So there clearly is an audience for this.
7388000	7388880	So we'll see.
7388880	7389920	We'll see what develops.
7389920	7390240	All right.
7390240	7390960	Thank you for the emails.
7390960	7394720	Again, if you want to email us, participate at orangelandradio.com.
7394720	7396880	And now the website's fixed too after all these years.
7396880	7400080	So participate after at orangelandradio.com.
7400080	7403280	Let's get to some more news stories so we can get to Skype calls in just a little bit.
7403280	7406880	Five stories, then Skype calls Orange Lounge Radio on Skype all in word.
7406880	7407680	But first, Loki.
7408240	7408800	All right.
7408800	7411280	So Kojima.
7411280	7417040	So he was talking about how Konami kind of when he was working for Konami back before
7417040	7421360	they decided to be back in my day, super assholes about everything.
7421360	7426800	They decided that they would let him work on kind of whatever he wanted to work on.
7426800	7428320	So, you know, it was.
7430320	7434880	It kind of freeing that he was able to work on different projects, mainly, you know,
7434880	7439040	Mel, you're solid, you know, but of course, you know, other games that he worked on as well.
7439040	7440000	Why is this page not working?
7440000	7440560	OK, here we go.
7442320	7446560	But they were saying, you know, whenever they, you know, he would pitch a plan or budget,
7446560	7447760	they would tell him, yeah, it's OK.
7449040	7451760	I guess it's just at some point they decided that it wasn't OK.
7451760	7456240	And then that's when all this shit went new management or something.
7457200	7461040	So, yeah, it is great.
7461040	7467520	You said that, you know, during, you know, do the games getting bigger, more systems,
7467520	7468960	more genres and barriers.
7468960	7474720	Many young recruits out of college are thrown into a line and continue to make small background
7474720	7477920	objects or explosions for three to five years.
7477920	7481600	So that was kind of harder to kind of work your way up to, yes, project management and
7481600	7482100	stuff like that.
7482500	7488900	You know, there is more and more staff members who only affect extremely small parts of games
7488900	7491540	while not being able to see the product in its entirety.
7493700	7500020	And, you know, basically saying that, you know, he started a small team of only five
7500660	7507220	and he had basically says everyone had to be able to do everything.
7507220	7510260	You couldn't say, well, my specialty is such and such thing.
7510980	7516340	You had to actually study, work hard, only sleeping three hours each day, that kind of
7516340	7517460	mentality.
7517460	7520740	So that's kind of he attributes that to his experience.
7521460	7522500	So pretty cool interview.
7524660	7530020	I don't know, it's neat, kind of sucks that, you know, it sounds like the company is working
7530020	7536820	for originally it was kind of, you know, more freeing, but then I guess that kind of changed
7536820	7537940	and that's why he's out.
7537940	7542980	But at least he's on his own now working with Sony and on a new game that looks fucking
7542980	7544740	weird that we had no idea about.
7544740	7546260	And hopefully we'll get a new trailer for this year.
7546260	7550500	Boy, it sounds like they're sure trying to kind of make nice and mend some bridges, huh?
7550500	7551860	Because it, yeah, I don't know.
7551860	7552500	It's interesting.
7553140	7556980	Interesting little positivity for Konami once in the news this week.
7556980	7558020	So I guess that's good.
7559540	7561300	How ironic, they needed Kojima to do it.
7562340	7563140	All right.
7563140	7568740	Well, anyhow, let's move on to PlayStation 4 updates because there is a brand new PlayStation
7568740	7570500	4 update on the way for the firmware.
7570500	7572180	So this is something that everybody's going to get.
7572180	7575140	It's PlayStation 4 firmware 5.0.
7575140	7581060	And one of the big features for PlayStation firmware 5.0 PlayStation 4 plus owners will
7581060	7586660	now be able to stream on Twitch 1080p 60 frames a second.
7586660	7591060	So the, and that's only on the pro, which I guess I'm assuming just the other bandwidth
7591060	7594740	wasn't, or the other chips weren't able to handle it on the PlayStation 4 regular.
7594740	7597860	So it's kind of limited to 720, but that'll be at 30 frames.
7597860	7602740	But this will be really cool that it can do this superpower for those that like to stream
7602740	7603940	from their PlayStation 4.
7603940	7606980	I kind of wish they would improve the streaming software a little bit.
7608020	7609860	But whatever, I guess we'll take a week yet.
7610420	7613860	Also, this is just some other minor quality life improvements.
7613860	7617540	You can switch off notifications when watching a movie or TV show finally.
7618180	7622420	And now the quick menu will be updated so you can see some notifications in there as
7622420	7622980	well.
7622980	7628020	There's also going to be a robust family management system allowing for multiple adult users and
7628020	7631140	different permissions for the kid child account, child accounts.
7631780	7634260	And this is also good.
7634260	7640580	If you are using VR, you are going to get messages while you're broadcasting in VR mode.
7640580	7642180	I think that was something Bobby Blackwell was looking for.
7642180	7643460	Broadcast in VR mode.
7643460	7644420	Oh yeah, you can.
7644420	7646980	But now you couldn't really see your messages or anything like that.
7646980	7651700	But now you will actually be able to see the messages as they come in on PlayStation VR.
7651700	7653060	So that's kind of neat.
7653060	7653860	Something they'll be doing.
7654420	7659620	Also, you can bind broadcast to communities that you own so that way when people go into
7659620	7661780	your communities, they'll see if you're broadcasting or not.
7661780	7664900	Like if you have a streaming community or something set up on PlayStation 4.
7664900	7668500	I don't know how often those communities are really being used on PlayStation 4, but I
7668500	7670660	guess cool that they're trying to link that all together.
7670660	7674100	Maybe they're hoping streamers will try to sell their PlayStation communities harder
7674100	7675540	if that feature is available in there.
7676260	7682020	Also, if you're watching Blu-rays or DVDs in cinematic mode in VR, you will now get the
7682020	7687060	5.1 and 7.1 surround sound if you're listening on your headphones.
7687060	7688580	So that's pretty cool as well.
7688580	7691860	It's not limited to just that, but those are some of the big updates coming to the
7691860	7696340	next firmware, which I believe went into beta testing for select users already.
7696340	7700420	And the rest of us will probably see it, what, September, October type of timeframe.
7700420	7703220	Yeah, I had a laugh during the week.
7703220	7709860	I saw a Twitter account sending out, yeah, we're doing a drawing for early access to
7709860	7710660	the new firmware.
7710660	7713380	I'm like, that's not how this works.
7714980	7716500	I think you can invite a friend or something.
7716500	7717620	It's like a beta program.
7717620	7718500	Like, what the fuck?
7719060	7719780	That's stupid.
7720660	7724580	Bobby in chat says, cheap plug, join the VoG network community on PS4.
7724580	7729780	Yes, there is a VoG community on PS4 and you should join it so that when something useful
7729780	7732420	for communities happens, we'll take advantage of it.
7733300	7734020	We promise.
7734020	7734900	Bring back home.
7735860	7737540	Yeah, when PlayStation Home comes back.
7737540	7738580	Now we miss it, huh?
7738580	7739700	It used to be the butt of every joke.
7739700	7740980	It would be awesome in VR.
7740980	7742420	A PlayStation Home would be awesome in VR.
7742420	7742900	It would be.
7743780	7749780	The closest thing they have, the PlayStation Home in VR is probably, what the fuck is that
7749780	7750420	game called?
7752500	7753540	I don't remember what it's called.
7753540	7754660	I have it.
7754660	7759700	It's a bar game where you play different games in a bar and you can literally throw
7759700	7761300	bottles at people or stuff like that.
7761300	7762980	But it's multiplayer in VR.
7763700	7764420	Cool.
7764420	7765220	It's like, yeah.
7766180	7767300	A sports bar VR.
7767300	7768180	Sports bar VR, yes.
7768180	7770260	That's the closest thing you're gonna get the PlayStation Home.
7770260	7770740	Okay.
7770740	7772420	And I would love that.
7772420	7773380	It'd be awesome.
7773380	7773700	All right.
7774340	7775380	Darcy, what do you have for us?
7776740	7777380	Some bullshit.
7778180	7785300	So basically Nestle, which is granted an asshole of a company because we know what they were
7785300	7787140	doing with the water during the water crisis.
7787780	7796420	Um, but anyway, Nestle did a breakout themed advertisement and Atari filed a lawsuit.
7797220	7804340	Basically they had, um, a bunch of people at a train station who were playing a video
7804340	7811780	game similar to Breakout except using the Kit Kat fingers instead of the colored bricks.
7812580	7819300	And Atari said basically it's plain and blatant infringement that Nestle exploited, quote,
7819300	7825460	the special place it holds amongst nostalgic baby boomers, generation X, and even today's
7825460	7827700	millennial and post millennial gamers.
7827700	7830100	And it was filed in the San Francisco court.
7830100	7837220	Um, the Nestle spokesperson replied that it was a UK TV advert in 2016 and that it no
7837220	7841300	longer runs and they're not planning on rerunning it and that they will defend themselves.
7842100	7851060	Um, but then again, you know, Nestle, uh, already, uh, lost, uh, a suit with Cadbury,
7851060	7856100	um, for trying to, uh, when Cadbury tried, uh, well, when they tried to trademark the
7856100	7857300	four finger bar design.
7858180	7859620	So whatever.
7861460	7861960	Karma.
7862820	7867060	It's just interesting to me that this commercial is so fucking old, but that's just how slow
7867060	7867780	the law goes.
7867780	7869140	That's not fucking old.
7870020	7873860	How slow, I mean, if they add campaigns don't last more than a year.
7873860	7879860	If they did the Kit Kat campaign with Breakout in 1976, maybe it would be relevant.
7879860	7883780	We need to sue Kit Kat for not bringing other flavors here to the US.
7883780	7884580	Right?
7884580	7887700	Like that's a fucking crime, arrest Kit Kat.
7888260	7890020	Why can't we get the chocolatory flavors?
7890020	7891060	Those are amazing.
7891060	7895220	Or like even just like the green tea and the sweet potato one that you can roast.
7895220	7895720	Yes.
7896420	7897060	Oh, so good.
7897860	7898820	Strawberry cheesecake.
7899860	7901380	Ah, I just don't understand.
7901380	7902020	All right, moving on.
7902020	7903060	A few more stories for you.
7903060	7908660	Oh, we need the sake flavor so much orange launch radio on Skype after a couple more
7908660	7908980	stories.
7908980	7909480	Loki.
7909860	7910180	Sorry.
7910180	7914660	I'm horribly distracted with the fact that I see the ultimate Epic battle simulator now
7914660	7915780	has modding support.
7915780	7917540	That's only going to be ridiculous.
7917540	7918100	Oh boy.
7918100	7918740	I can't wait.
7918740	7925780	Speaking of ridiculous Takashi's castle or Takashi's challenges is available now on iOS
7925780	7927460	and Android in Japan.
7927460	7932500	So you may not have played Takashi's challenge, which was in a Famicom game.
7933940	7934440	Whatever.
7935620	7936120	I don't care.
7938100	7943700	It was a game that came out back in 1986 for the Famicom and now you can actually check
7943700	7952340	it out on because I'm sure those games that are meant for, you know, an old Famicom controller
7952340	7955540	probably plays so fucking fantastic on a touch screen.
7955540	7958180	But yeah, you can subject yourself to that.
7958180	7959220	It's going to be available.
7961060	7964900	I don't know if it's coming soon, but they added new stage America.
7965540	7968740	They have also had 16 by 9 support.
7968740	7975780	There's also, I guess, the Huntabo language certification test, which I have no idea what
7975780	7976820	the hell that's supposed to be about.
7976820	7979860	Apparently you can share the results with your friends via social media.
7981860	7984660	So yeah, isn't this game like really fucking hard and annoying?
7984820	7988820	Dark Tetsuya in chat at live.vognetwork.com says it's fucking ridiculous.
7988820	7994420	Basically, why would you play a fucking ridiculous game like this on a mobile device?
7994420	7997780	I mean, like, honestly, like, it's like, that's like, it makes it harder.
7997780	8001380	It's like Super Meat Boy on a mobile device.
8001380	8002820	Like, why would you do that?
8002820	8003940	It makes it even harder.
8003940	8005300	It's stupid.
8005300	8006820	It's just frustrating.
8006820	8007380	And I get it.
8007380	8011860	That's the kind of the gist of the game, but it's frustrating.
8011860	8014660	Yeah, I wouldn't download this game if you're not looking for punishment.
8014660	8016900	That's the joke, basically.
8018100	8018580	All right.
8018580	8021060	Well, anyhow, one more story for you guys tonight.
8021060	8023700	And this is a great note for us to end on before we get to calls.
8024420	8028260	Talking about Twitch, another marathon that they have coming.
8028260	8030100	Twitch has been nailing it with their marathons.
8030100	8031220	They had the Bob Ross.
8031220	8033860	They had Mr. Rogers, Power Rangers.
8033860	8035780	Well, guess what's coming next?
8035780	8036980	StarCade.
8036980	8040420	I think we did address this on a previous episode that StarCade was going to be marathoned
8040420	8041060	on Twitch.
8041060	8043060	Well, now we have some of the details.
8043060	8046260	So Shout Factory has the channel, and I think they're trying to push.
8046260	8050260	I think the new version of StarCade is in development as well.
8050260	8051300	I think there's Blu-rays.
8051860	8053620	I think Blu-rays are coming or something like that.
8053620	8062980	Well, anyhow, on their Twitch channel starting August 28th at 2 p.m. Eastern, all 123 episodes
8062980	8067300	digitized from the source tapes will be broadcast in a marathon.
8067300	8068420	It's gonna be awesome.
8068420	8073620	And one of the hosts from Geek and Sundry, Erica Ishii, will introduce games and provide
8073620	8074580	some context.
8074580	8079940	I'm assuming that's because this show was on before many of you were born.
8079940	8084020	So some of these games you may actually not know, especially some of the more obscure
8084020	8084660	ones.
8084660	8090740	Now, us old fucks that were old enough to remember this show when it was on TV, we probably
8090740	8092980	don't need her, but that's fine.
8092980	8095700	Obviously, something's got to break it up, the marathon, a little bit.
8095700	8096740	So that's fine.
8096740	8097300	Fine.
8097380	8098420	Have somebody explain it.
8098420	8099780	I don't even think that's necessary.
8099780	8102900	You'll gain context by just watching multiple episodes.
8102900	8104340	You'll see what that shit's about.
8104340	8105060	Yeah.
8105060	8111460	So yeah, no, they are saying that it is running to fuel demand for Shout Factory's upcoming
8111460	8112900	StarCade reboot.
8113860	8114340	Interesting.
8114340	8115140	So check that out.
8115860	8120980	Again, now look, I know I'm not a host on Geek and Sundry or any of those things, but
8120980	8126500	I would be the best damn game show host ever, and I would host this show in a heartbeat.
8126500	8130500	Just email me and you can even use the website now to email me.
8130500	8131700	It's fixed.
8131700	8138340	So yes, I'll be waiting for your call, Shout Factory, because StarCade was such a good
8138340	8138820	fucking show.
8138820	8139620	I'm excited.
8139620	8141940	I'm excited myself for this marathon.
8141940	8143060	I'm actually a little sad.
8143060	8147860	I'm only going to be able to watch a little bit of it because I fly out of town early
8147860	8149780	in the morning on the 30th for Dragon Con.
8149780	8150900	So there you go.
8151700	8157460	Anyhow, Bobby Black Wolf in chat says millennials need information spoon fed to them.
8157460	8159620	Loki millennials are killing critical thought.
8161860	8162660	Oh, you.
8163380	8164900	Oh, he's not serious.
8164900	8166660	Put the pitchforks and torches down.
8167460	8168100	Let's see.
8168100	8172500	Dark Tetsuya says, I think one game I remember from the original airing was Dragon's Lair.
8174820	8178500	What was the game with the giant robot head that would go beware?
8178500	8179220	I live.
8179220	8180340	Is that Sinstar?
8180980	8182020	Yeah, that Sinstar.
8182020	8182660	Sinstar.
8183380	8186900	That game was definitely on StarCade because I remember seeing that for the first time
8186900	8187540	on StarCade.
8187540	8190660	And I thought rad because it was the 80s.
8190660	8192180	We said rad a lot more often.
8192180	8193220	So there you go.
8194900	8195140	Yes.
8195140	8200020	And Bob Black Wolf also points out that the reruns were on G4 about 15 years ago.
8200020	8202580	Well, that was the last time this was on TV.
8202580	8205220	So I mean, it's been a long time.
8205220	8207140	If you think about it, think about it.
8207140	8212980	Bobby Black Wolf, a 19 year old listening to this show right now, your show or my show,
8212980	8218260	a 19 year old in college listening to this show right now was four when those reruns
8218260	8219220	were on G4.
8219220	8222340	Just process that thought for a minute, Bobby.
8222340	8223220	And I'll leave you with that.
8224740	8228340	Let's open up the phones at Orange Lounge Radio.
8228340	8230340	All one word on Skype.
8230340	8234500	If you want to give us a call and talk about anything, or you just want to reminisce about
8234500	8236820	old StarCade episodes, that's fine, too.
8237380	8239220	I got a nice Bobby in chat.
8239220	8239940	Damn it, Rob.
8239940	8240900	I dislike you.
8241540	8242180	No, you don't.
8244340	8244740	All right.
8245620	8247380	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
8247380	8251620	If you'd like to give us a call and talk about anything tonight, including StarCade or any
8251620	8257060	of this other stuff that we've talked about, Gamescom, Xbox, PlayStation stuff, whatever
8257060	8257940	you want to talk about.
8257940	8258820	Switch.
8258820	8264420	We still have mystery Nintendo announcements coming, but I would set the bar at a reasonable
8265220	8265540	level.
8265540	8266180	Yeah, don't.
8266180	8268900	You know, I'm honest, honest to God.
8268900	8271540	From what I saw, there's it's not even really announcements.
8271540	8273620	I mean, it's sort of like the Treehouse Live stuff.
8273620	8278740	So they're streaming Super Mario Odyssey, the new Metroid game.
8278740	8282900	Yeah, the first 10 minutes of these games, those types of footage.
8282900	8284900	Don't don't set your expectations too crazy.
8284900	8287460	You might get maybe there'll be a nice little treat in there.
8288100	8289060	Some announcements.
8289060	8292980	Once in a while, there might be like, oh, there's going to be a DLC or a sorry, not
8292980	8297140	DLC, but a new eShop game is available right now.
8297140	8297700	Surprise.
8297700	8299460	You know, there might be a cute little thing like that.
8300980	8301700	All right.
8301700	8304740	Do we have any last minute stories while we wait to see if anybody calls us tonight?
8304740	8308100	Bobby got a lot of calls tonight, so maybe we won't, because sometimes that happens that
8308100	8308260	way.
8308260	8310980	Everybody called Bobby instead, but we'll see what happens.
8310980	8313060	A lot of people are watching Game of Chairs.
8314260	8315300	Is it done tonight?
8315300	8315940	Is it over?
8315940	8317300	No, it's only the sixth episode.
8317300	8318340	Next week will be done.
8319460	8321620	But this episode, because I spoiled it for myself.
8323220	8324180	Don't spoil it for the listeners.
8324180	8324820	No, I'm not.
8324820	8325860	But, ugh.
8325860	8326340	Okay.
8326340	8328980	So you are going to be, you're going to be smaad.
8328980	8330900	No, because I don't pay attention to this show.
8330900	8331220	I'm not talking about you.
8331220	8332900	I'm talking about the listeners who watch it.
8332900	8334180	You're going to be smaad.
8334180	8334740	Okay.
8334740	8335620	You know what smaad is?
8335620	8337220	So, uh, sad and mad.
8338180	8338980	Happy.
8338980	8341140	So sad and mad.
8341700	8344180	Film yourself one of those reaction videos.
8344180	8345060	This is the time to do it.
8345060	8346340	You're going to be smappy.
8346340	8347060	Is that what I'm hearing?
8347780	8348100	All right.
8348980	8350180	Hashtag boat sex.
8351460	8352420	Okay.
8352420	8354420	No, no spoilers.
8355060	8357060	No, that doesn't happen yet.
8358820	8359540	Yet.
8359540	8359940	All right.
8360900	8363860	Anyhow, let's get to at least one call.
8363860	8364820	I think we have on the line here.
8364820	8365380	Let's do it.
8365380	8365620	Hi.
8365620	8366580	You're on orange launch radio.
8366580	8367060	Who's this?
8367780	8368980	Hey, uh, Rob.
8368980	8369940	This is Raginator.
8369940	8370580	Hey, Raginator.
8370580	8371380	What's on your mind, buddy?
8371940	8373140	I know a whole lot.
8373140	8381620	Um, not, well, first, uh, not to be, uh, beat this into the ground, but I know it's been
8381620	8386740	said in a champ, you know, you know, let me move my mic down.
8386740	8392980	Um, I know this has been said, uh, in chat a lot last week, but you know, since I actually
8392980	8397380	got you on Skype right now, I just want to verbally say, I'm sorry about your loss.
8398260	8402420	Um, I know losing family is really, really tough.
8402420	8403860	I believe it or not.
8403860	8404980	I've been there myself.
8404980	8407700	So, but, um, well, I really appreciate that.
8407700	8412740	You know, and it's, it's, it's, it's a little rough right now because one of my closest
8412740	8417860	friends in the entire world is going through something, um, that's a little too similar.
8417860	8420740	And, um, it's, it's just, it's so hard right now.
8420740	8425780	This is just like, I just want to take this entire summer and just fire it.
8425780	8426900	Like it's awful.
8426900	8430100	Everything about this summer has been awful.
8430100	8432420	So that's all I really have to say about that.
8432420	8437220	I'm just hoping that DragonCon and Labor Day in general and everything is just a nice big
8437220	8440260	reset button on this fuck of a year.
8440260	8441460	That's really all I have to say.
8442020	8445220	Yeah, believe me, I completely and utterly understand.
8445220	8447540	So, uh, I've been there myself.
8447540	8457140	So, uh, but, um, anyway, um, I, I would assume that you heard my call with, uh, Bobby
8457140	8458900	earlier during the evening.
8458900	8460980	Cheap plug for Bobby Shaw.
8460980	8466420	Really great show airs live before, uh, orange launch radio on Sunday evening.
8466500	8468100	So you got to pay for that air time.
8468100	8469860	No, no, Bobby's great.
8469860	8470260	Of course.
8470260	8471620	We talk about him every week.
8471620	8472660	He's fantastic.
8472660	8477300	Um, I, I, in all honesty, I only heard a little bit of it because that was right at the moment
8477300	8479060	that one of my co-hosts arrived at the show.
8479060	8483940	So we were talking a little bit about round table pizza and his, uh, frustrations.
8483940	8486100	So I didn't hear the entire thing.
8486100	8486740	No, it's fine.
8486740	8487380	It happens.
8487380	8490260	Uh, but I, uh, so you'll have to refresh my memory a little bit.
8491060	8495620	Um, well, I can't remember exactly everything that was sad.
8495620	8502740	Truth be told, but the general highlights is, uh, now God versus versus steam really,
8502740	8504340	uh, and why.
8505540	8510100	Bobby, you know, really doesn't use, you know, God so much as steam.
8510100	8514020	Oh, because the whole, that they don't have prepaid cards like steam does and his concerns
8514020	8516020	about security, which I totally get.
8516020	8516260	Yeah.
8516820	8517140	Yeah.
8517140	8522420	Uh, and of course, you know, I kind of took a relatively minor patch on it.
8522420	8528500	The fact that you have bought virtually every version of, uh, you know, mass effect, you
8528500	8534340	know, three, no demand, except for the cell phone version or the TI-83 version.
8535220	8536100	Oh, is it ported there?
8536100	8537380	I may have to pick that up.
8537380	8539620	Well, I've, I've also bought things on GOG.
8539620	8548900	Um, actually I was, um, uh, given Witcher three on VOG, on VOG, because of VOG wink
8548900	8550900	nudge, I was given that on a GOG.
8550900	8554420	And so that kind of opened the door, but you know, see, here's the thing.
8554420	8559540	I actually really appreciated GOG when it was the classic games and stuff.
8559540	8564180	Like I w like when Sid Meier's covert action came out, I was fucking jazz.
8564180	8568100	I really wish they would somehow get the rights to the original civilization.
8568100	8568900	I would buy that.
8568900	8570820	I want to stream that game so fucking bad.
8570820	8571860	I want to buy that.
8571860	8575220	Um, but I guess it's just caught up in, in legal issues or whatever.
8575220	8580340	So, I mean, there are, there's things like, I loved GOG when it was like all that stuff.
8580420	8585140	Now I don't get as into the newer games and stuff on GOG, but I don't dismiss it either.
8585140	8588900	It's just, it's another, it's another, it's, it's a very crowded marketplace
8588900	8590740	when it comes to online stores.
8590740	8593620	And, you know, GOG is just another place to keep your eye on for some deals.
8594340	8594900	Yeah.
8594900	8599700	And admittedly, you know, it took me a while to get out to GOG myself.
8599700	8605220	Uh, uh, thanks to you, you know, I, and you're constantly mentioning that
8605220	8607540	steaming their sales and your deals and all day.
8607540	8614420	I initially started with, uh, steamed first and the fact that they have prepaid cards for,
8614420	8618340	uh, helped and I didn't have a bank account for a while.
8618340	8626820	So buying stuff on GOG was a problem, but, um, that, uh, that aside, um, you know,
8626820	8632740	the main purpose of my call was, uh, I was going to pose this question, uh, question to you and,
8632740	8634740	you know, everyone else as well.
8634740	8644500	Um, Mass Effect 3 aside, um, you know, if you bought, uh, you know, whatever game,
8644500	8651380	you know, multiple times through whatever distributor and, uh, and, you know, why,
8651380	8657860	you know, in my case is usually now I get the steam version for, uh, achievements and what then,
8658100	8663460	get the GOG version for digital, digital extras, like soundtracks about that.
8664500	8668820	So what games have you basically double dipped on for extra features,
8668820	8670580	I guess, am I summarizing there?
8670580	8675300	Yeah, extra features, trading cards, achievements, whatever.
8677620	8682020	I just bought just recently, the most recent one, Pac-Man Championship Edition 2,
8682740	8688500	I bought on, uh, steam because I already had it on a PlayStation 4.
8688500	8694500	I bought it to a, be able to stream it and easier because yes, I can do it through the PS4, but
8694500	8699540	I'm forced to use the PS4 is like interface, which I like my interface where I get alerted
8699540	8703220	to subscribers and follows. I like it so I can thank them. I like that interface better.
8703220	8708820	So I like to stream PC for that reason. I, and yes, I will hook up the PS4 through my
8708820	8713380	capture card. It's just a little bit, one of those, like I have them in two separate rooms,
8713380	8717300	long story short, it's easier said than done, but that'll probably happen eventually.
8717300	8721700	But anyway, um, uh, with that whole thing, I double dipped on that for that.
8721700	8725700	And it was super cheap. Like it was on sale. I don't know if it was like a humble bundle
8725700	8729620	or something, but I feel like I picked that up for a real nominal price. And I was just like,
8729620	8734340	eh, whatever. I'm going to get it again. And that's, I think, I think part of the reason why
8734340	8741380	steam has come up in comp in the conversation a lot is because steam is infamous for these sales
8741380	8745540	where games will get so cheap that people aren't afraid to double dip because it's like,
8746340	8752020	it was a buck, you know, um, another one, VVVVV. I own that on like three different platforms.
8752020	8757300	I have that on 3DS PlayStation four and steam. And part of the reason I'm encouraged to do it
8757300	8761780	because it's cheap. It's not a very expensive game. So, you know, Mass Effect three was one
8761780	8765120	But a lot of the other games I noticed I've double dipped with are cheaper games
8765120	8768760	I'm highly likely to do it with Sonic Mania as well
8769280	8773280	Just because I would like to have the portability that comes with a Nintendo switch
8773720	8777300	I don't know. What about you guys any double dipping on on
8777820	8781460	Consoles or whatever of games you want to call out or PC console whatever
8781980	8784480	Well, it's like Grand Theft Auto 5
8784480	8789160	I have both on console and on PC and I because you can mod it on PC, huh?
8789580	8793080	Not so much but yeah, you can I've heard that one before I
8793840	8799980	Skyrim is another video. Yeah, I have that on both. I've got like lots of systems for Skyrim and then
8801280	8804980	Don't fall off for yet on both systems, but I don't know
8804980	8807840	I'm I haven't played the ice I'll have to go back and play that
8808360	8810920	Anything for you dark soccer that comes to mind something you've double dipped on
8812040	8817240	Um, I don't you'd have to go all the way back to like Symphony of the Night on Saturn and PlayStation, right?
8817320	8823400	Actually, no recently I have I picked up older despair girls for steam as well as already had it on
8824800	8827280	PS TV and what was the
8827920	8829920	motivation behind it just I
8829960	8832080	Would much rather play it on steam
8832120	8832640	Yeah
8832640	8838700	Sometimes it's just about my my PC versus my TV and the different rooms that they're in and all that
8839240	8844880	Act-def points out overwatch on Xbox one and PC and I'll get it on ps4 if I get the console
8844960	8851640	Yeah, me too I have it on well not Xbox yet, but I probably will eventually but I have it on PlayStation 4 and PC
8851640	8853520	and it's because
8853520	8859000	It was on sale on ps4 and I finally decided there's people on ps4. I want to be able to play this game with
8859880	8861880	That was a big part behind it
8861980	8867840	So well good questions fascinating. What was the last name you double dipped on if anything? Oh
8868560	8870560	well before
8871080	8872440	God
8872440	8878400	Implemented the whole guy conduct your thing. I did buy
8880280	8885560	You know odd world Abe's Odyssey, yeah, and I'm God
8886200	8888200	Well after the fact, you know
8888560	8894740	After the fact that I got on steam, you know, I did this not the same with Duke Nukem 3d
8895520	8897520	the main reason why I got a
8898520	8903520	You know odd world, you know, he's obviously is because of the soundtrack and all the you know
8903680	8906480	all our extras that came with the dog version and
8908320	8913040	Many reason why I got the Duke Nukem 3d along with all the
8913600	8919040	Nukem games there is because they were dope cheap the RM free and plus they came with
8920080	8923400	Extras like ringtones and stuff like that. So I can't figure what the hell
8924040	8927360	59 cents per game normally six bucks
8928120	8934780	You know, even though no poor people peels like me can afford 59 cents per game. So
8935560	8938080	When they get that low a lot of people want to jump on board
8938080	8943080	I want to get this one too in chat act Efton chat says I also have Rayman legends on Wii U
8943280	8948440	Vita Xbox one and PC lol. Well, you never get to tease me about Mass Effect again, sir
8948520	8950640	But also I should I should add to this
8951280	8953880	Something I played this week that I forgot to mention during the top of the show
8953880	8956720	There's a demo for Rayman legends on the switch
8956960	8961360	So there's another platform for react after you now get on the switch and actually anybody with a switch
8961440	8965680	It's worth just downloading the demo. It's a pretty robust demo and it's free
8965680	8968800	So you can kind of you know, check out if it's something you'd be into or not
8968800	8974200	So I think they get that game away on the Xbox gold or PlayStation Plus or something some time ago
8974200	8977860	So I think a lot of people kind of have it that way anyway, but it's worth checking out on switch
8978340	8984780	You know the funny and funny thing is you know that you mentioned the Rayman series, you know, I seen
8985300	8986680	No
8986680	8990060	You know virtually the entire series on you know
8990060	8996340	The various PC storefronts with the exception out there very first game game
8996340	9002260	I don't see you seem to see it either on you play your scheme or God or anything, you know
9003300	9007060	Do you happen to know why is it like a licensing thing or?
9008580	9012780	Compatibility thing or something like that. Oh, no idea. I don't know what it's legal stuff. Who knows
9014900	9018580	All right, well, I'll probably let you go on I'm tying up your line
9018580	9025660	Yes is I'm sure act act after dungeon buster or somewhere else. We'll probably want to call in so we'll see
9025660	9031220	I I well have a nice day. Thanks for taking my call. Of course. Take care buddy. Bye. Yep. You too
9031260	9034340	All right. We'll see if anybody else wants to sneak in here before we wrap it up
9034340	9036940	It is almost 9 o'clock. So I do want to wrap it up
9036940	9038940	So if you're thinking about it, you better do it now
9039100	9044420	Any other last-minute stories want to get to Loki before we there wasn't really anything not a lot of other stuff
9044420	9047580	Yes, there was I saw there was an opinion piece says
9048620	9053780	from destructive where they talked to some insiders at Nintendo saying that with the
9054260	9058460	State of affairs the way things are going right now because the water was kind of the one pushing
9059060	9065200	the rhythm heaven series that there's not going to be any more of those brought over from Japan and that also the
9065480	9067880	Translation of mother three is just not happening. Ah
9068560	9074520	Bitch that they they are having issues like they last time they attempted to do it
9074520	9078680	I guess they had stopped when they got to the my gypsy my gypsies
9078680	9083640	I guess is ones and it's not to do with like a trans character or something. They know how to
9085760	9090200	Represent that without offending everybody put a disclaimer put a disclaimer in the game
9090200	9096280	That says it's like they do with the old old racist cartoons put a disclaimer at the beginning
9096280	9100680	You know that says this was what it was at the time. It doesn't necessarily reflect how we feel now
9100680	9104920	That's one way to do it. Anyway, I want to make sure I grab this call because we have another call coming out
9104920	9109960	It's got oh damn it. I just missed it caller. Try to come try to try one more time if you hear me
9111520	9114440	Let's see looking in chat over at live dot vog network comm
9115080	9118040	Nintendo might try to take a wrecking ball to it. So be careful
9118040	9123760	Mmm, let's see. Oh, here we go. Good that calls coming back in. Let's see if I can grab it this time
9124720	9129840	Green button. Here we go. Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this? Hey this act death. Hey, glad you made it in
9129840	9131840	What's up, buddy?
9131920	9136200	Well, I've been playing overwatch and a lot of Lucio ball
9137080	9143800	I want to ask you how have you have you played Lucio ball and in competitive I did. Oh, no not in competitive
9143800	9149040	I played enough Lucio ball to get my box and then I was kind of I didn't really play it again
9149040	9151240	I don't know. I mean, I think Lucio ball is cool
9151240	9154320	Like it's obviously got a very rocket League sort of vibe to it
9154320	9156160	So I kind of like it for what it is
9156160	9160000	But I just I don't know if I liked it enough to do it competitive
9160000	9166240	like I can't even do regular overwatch competitive because mouth-breathers just take it too seriously and it's like I'm not
9166480	9171040	Good enough like I don't want to get screamed at when I go into these matches and I'm not doing one
9171040	9177280	So I just like to do the fuck around matches where if you if you yell at somebody for we need a healer god damn
9177280	9182160	It we need a healer when you're doing that in quick play. It's like be the change you want to see in the world
9184160	9189840	Well, I've been I've been taken taking Lucio ball seriously, no, it's fine
9189840	9192320	No, and it's no and there's nothing wrong with that act F
9192320	9197760	Do what you enjoy if you can handle it and you're having fun with it fucking more power to you. I'm excited for you
9197760	9200800	How's it going for you? You do you that's right you do you how?
9201040	9202560	How is it going for you?
9202560	9204560	I'm diamond ranked
9204560	9210760	So yeah, I've been doing really great. But the thing is and talking about
9211840	9215400	Teammates not doing that. Well, and I know that not
9216000	9219320	Necessarily everyone knows how to play Lucio or knows how to play
9220400	9222400	Lucio ball even or football
9222680	9228680	but it's kind of frustrating that that people know don't know the basics of
9229440	9231440	Soccer like it's
9232080	9233800	don't know if it's
9233800	9239680	Because well, I'm next I'm Mexican. I'm fine. It's football and we have it like
9240360	9245840	Yeah, like ingrained in our system, but it's right and us Americans can't be fucking bothered. Can we?
9247920	9252920	Yeah, no, it's fine it's fine drag us we deserve it
9255040	9256640	Like
9256640	9261200	The two of the team of our teammates going for the ball instead of just one
9262120	9265280	The goalie not being it's in their place
9265840	9271800	The I don't know many things. I don't even fucking watch sports and I knew that one
9271800	9274840	The goalie shouldn't leave if you if you are the player
9274920	9279520	That gets put in the little goalie box at the beginning of the match you say in your damn problem
9279520	9284300	You stay in the fucking box unless once in a while like hockey once in a while
9284340	9286140	It is appropriate to pull the goalie
9286140	9291780	But I say as I'm like, I don't watch sports, but I know some of these things. But anyway, I know enough. Okay, so
9293180	9295420	Sometimes you pull the goalie, but there are very
9295940	9299100	Strategical reasons why you do that and it's one of those things where you know
9299100	9304000	The ball is in a very particular place where you're not gonna fuck up by leaving the goal
9304000	9309820	Like there are very particular reasons why you do it and for most people you may just want to stay near the goal
9309820	9312780	I also by the way, most people know this I played I was uh
9312780	9316020	I was one of those soccer kids that played from the time
9316020	9320220	I was like I was like five years old or something. I played for like five years and
9320920	9325700	By the way, I was an excellent goalie. That's what I pretty much always played was either goalie or goalkeeper
9326560	9332660	Yeah, I also and my youth when when I had but least somewhat good health. I
9333300	9335620	Also played goalie so I know how to play goalie
9335620	9341520	Yeah, but but it's kind of baffling to see people like trying to to go for the ball
9341520	9348620	When when another teammate is there or having the two teammates like being goalie at the same time. It's like
9349040	9353000	Dude, no, don't do that. It's confusing for both of you
9353000	9358920	And you're still you're seeing this in diamond ranked matches where people don't know this. Yeah, it's like dude
9358920	9364760	How did you get diamond ranked in the first place? If you don't know how to play here's the thing that here's like wow
9364840	9369200	Here's what here's what could make the world a better place and I'll kind of wrap up on this
9369200	9374280	I think we wrap up the show here. Here's the hey, we could just all make the world a better place and make gaming culture
9374280	9376360	Better here's how we could just make gaming culture better
9376560	9378000	You know what? That's fine
9378000	9383840	If you want to give that feedback to the other players that hey, maybe the goalie should stay near the goal
9384200	9387760	But it's all about how you deliver that message
9388040	9395840	You don't get on the microphone and scream you fucking noob you fucking dipshit noob you fucking goal fucking noob
9395840	9398280	Go to the fuck. How would one fuck the goal?
9399680	9404360	Isn't it kind of it's a hole you know, you you don't have any big hole though
9404360	9407520	You don't do that on the microphone. You just say hey
9408200	9411300	Could you go you know, since you were the player that was dropped in front of the goal
9411320	9415440	You could you protect the goal cuz you know, we'll probably get a point if you could do that, you know
9415840	9421080	There's just better ways to deliver messages than the way people do it sometimes in gaming culture
9421280	9428920	So I'm just that's all I'm gonna say maybe I would play competitive overwatch if people I don't know treated each other with some
9428920	9430920	fucking basic human decency
9432320	9436680	Yeah, well at least in Xbox I haven't tried it on PC
9437200	9441080	I have been nice. It's I don't get like
9441720	9448000	Too much too many people like being aggressive or being well total assholes
9448720	9453600	Even on PC the one the one time I tried it. I got a really good team
9454600	9457400	Sorry, okay, I got really good teammates that
9458120	9463360	Actually, well, even if I kind of messed up they were like, oh don't don't sweat it
9464920	9466680	Just try this
9466680	9468840	Another time and they were pretty
9469600	9472260	Understanding even yeah. Yeah, you know to be fair
9472520	9478720	Alan plays on overwatch and I hear him on voice chat all the time because I tease him cuz like I'll walk by the computer
9478720	9482360	Room and I hear him playing overwatch and I'll go diva out of Mac diva out of Mac
9482400	9484200	You know, I'll make fun of him a little bit because that's what we do
9484200	9486960	But you know, he voice chats all the time on there and he's fine
9486960	9489800	He's doing a good time or has having a good time with that and you know
9489800	9494880	I play a lot of Final Fantasy 14 and sometimes we have to help you know, same thing happens
9494880	9499600	Somebody dies I as a healer get somebody killed because I was trying to DPS too much. I'm like, oh my god
9499600	9502960	That was my bad. Sorry about that and other people like hey, no sweat. No worries
9502960	9507640	It happens and like it it's cool when that happens in that game. It's like, okay
9507640	9511660	We're all decent human beings having a good time, you know, but you know
9511660	9518900	If somebody early on in my 14 experiences had been fuck you you fucking fuck. I probably wouldn't be playing that game anymore. So
9519820	9527220	yeah, most probably it it's good that the people do play like well smart and and
9527940	9529940	Don't act like assholes most of the time
9530260	9536260	It's kind of awful that sometimes they do but it's if you can enjoy the game like that
9536260	9539020	It's it's okay and dark Tetsuya
9539020	9543140	I think on a good note here in our chat over at live dog network comm says at the end of the day
9543380	9547340	It's just a video game. Yes. It's just a fucking game
9548700	9552420	All right, indeed act after I'm gonna let you go on that note, but thank you so much for the call
