Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:13.000 --> 00:19.000
Tonight, our headlines include E3, ether show rumors, E3 playing, D3 teasers, and well, E3. Sound expected?

00:19.000 --> 00:24.000
Then stay tuned instead to hear about Overwatch, more Project Rap Rabbit, and autonomous driving fears played out in gaming.

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
And yes, it all starts right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:37.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.000 --> 00:45.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight on May the 21st of 2017, episode number 687 of our show.

00:45.000 --> 00:50.000
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
And joining me, as always, not just yet, DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

00:55.000 --> 01:01.000
She's literally on her way, she had another event just before the show tonight, so she'll be joining us in a few moments here as she comes in live.

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
But I do have some other folks here in the studio to say hello to, of course, Techmaster Loki!

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
Hello.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
Hi Loki, how are you?

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
I'm fine.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
Hey, you got a brand new toy.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Yes I did.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
It's shiny, it's shiny and it needed the wifi password.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
Yes it did.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
What is this? You bought a new laptop, right?

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
I bought a new laptop, yes.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
And that keyboard kind of glows like my keyboard.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
It's RGB, and it matches my Tron background that I have.

01:21.000 --> 01:28.000
Oh, very cool. So what all went into it? So you got a new laptop because your other one was kind of...

01:28.000 --> 01:35.000
My other one is kind of, it's full of malware, and I just didn't feel like redoing everything on it.

01:35.000 --> 01:42.000
Also, it's overheating. I've had bad luck with old Asus laptops.

01:42.000 --> 01:50.000
The old ones that they had, not so much the Republic of Gaming stuff that they have now, but the old ones were like not thermally designed well.

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
And so they would overheat. In fact, this was my first laptop, my first Asus laptop.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
Pretty much melted when Titanfall hit it.

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
And then I had to buy this last one, which was a replacement.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
It was kind of one I had to pick up.

02:03.000 --> 02:08.000
It was whatever was available at Fry's at the time, and it was an AMD, an ATI...

02:08.000 --> 02:15.000
Well, I guess it's an AMD chip now too. The GPU, CPU, and an APU processor.

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
I just wasn't all that satisfied with it. It was slightly better spec-wise than my old laptop.

02:19.000 --> 02:26.000
But it was getting old. I mean, it was like a few years old when I bought it, and now it's three more years old and just needed something new.

02:26.000 --> 02:36.000
So I got a brand new laptop. It's got like a Core i7 in it, 16GB of RAM, a GTX 1060 with 6GB of RAM.

02:36.000 --> 02:41.000
Pretty much can run anything. Oh, and it has a 5TB hard drive in it because I'll never fucking fill that up.

02:41.000 --> 02:45.000
You have more space on that than I do on my desktop that's not even that old.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
Exactly.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
That's a lot of porn. That's a lot of porn.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
Yeah, it could be a lot of porn. But who downloads porn nowadays?

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
Oh, it's all streaming. Of course.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
It's all available on the internet. There's really no point.

02:57.000 --> 03:04.000
No, I mean, yeah. I could literally... I was backing up my laptop, my old one, and just kind of copying over what I needed.

03:04.000 --> 03:13.000
Because most of it was just Unity Project stuff, and I didn't have to really move any games over because I needed to download that crap again.

03:13.000 --> 03:21.000
But it felt like it was a lot of space, and I look at my hard drive's usage, and it's like, nothing.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
It's like, come on. Is this it? Seriously?

03:24.000 --> 03:31.000
Let me introduce our live chatroom, of course, because we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific and 9 o'clock Eastern at The Voice of Geeks Network.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
vognetwork.com, right after The Bobby Black Wolf Show.

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
And if you are listening live, you can join us in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

03:38.000 --> 03:44.000
And Bobby Black Wolf, who I just referred to, says in chat, or I should say asks, what's the Wi-Fi password?

03:44.000 --> 03:48.000
It's blackwolfsucks123!

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
Because, you know, all passwords have to have numbers and punctuation in them.

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
Bobby's also asking, does Loki's old laptop make him want to cry?

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
Like, did you get hit with want to cry? Is that why?

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
No, I didn't want to cry.

04:01.000 --> 04:06.000
I'm the one at risk for that because I'm still on Windows XP, where all the IT people out there are going,

04:06.000 --> 04:12.000
No, I've got, um, you know, I've got, it was, it should be still fine if I reset it.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
It just runs really hot for no reason.

04:14.000 --> 04:20.000
And I have my, you know, I bought a new laptop cooling pad for this laptop, but I think it's too small.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
But for the other one, it actually works really well.

04:22.000 --> 04:27.000
So, I may just end up wiping it, putting Minecraft on, give it to my son or something, you know, to use.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
Oh, that's a, that's a cute idea. Like, put little kitty games.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
I mean, it can still run, I mean, that's what I was playing Minecraft on.

04:34.000 --> 04:39.000
Make him learn the way we did. Put Number Munchers, Odell Lake, put the classics.

04:39.000 --> 04:43.000
He's already playing other stuff. I mean, he's got the Wii U and everything. He's not going to go for that.

04:43.000 --> 04:51.000
But, um, yeah, I mean, it was just, I don't know, like, it has, like, some Chromium malware thing on it right now that's really pissing me off.

04:51.000 --> 04:55.000
And I tried removing it. I think that's what kind of borked a bunch of stuff.

04:55.000 --> 05:00.000
So, I just said, ah, fuck it. I'm not going to worry about fixing this laptop right now. It's kind of falling apart.

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
Just going to get a new one in. I got a great deal. This one is actually used.

05:04.000 --> 05:10.000
I mean, it's practically brand new, except for, like, a couple tiny scratches on the top of the case, which is, like, who gives a shit?

05:10.000 --> 05:18.000
Um, and it's fantastic. It's a, uh, Electrix, or, um, I think they call them, like, they go by a bunch of different names.

05:18.000 --> 05:26.000
Clevo is another one. It's basically, it's Clevo shells. They have these laptop shells that a bunch of different companies fill with components.

05:26.000 --> 05:33.000
And they're really nice. I mean, just no, um, bloatware installed on it. Just a clean copy of Windows.

05:33.000 --> 05:41.000
And it just runs fantastic. I played, you know, Grand Theft Auto fully maxed out at, like, over 60 frames per second yesterday.

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
I was like, I can't even run this game on my old laptop. It was fucking awesome.

05:45.000 --> 05:49.000
All right. Well, I'm going to ask you about some of the games you've been playing on your new laptop.

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
But I figure that's probably best to hold on to How Was Your Gaming Week, which we'll get to in a little while.

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
I'm going to have you start us with our kickoff topic in a little bit, though, with that story that we have.

05:57.000 --> 06:02.000
But first, of course, I want to introduce our other folks in the studio here while we still wait for Dark Soccer to arrive.

06:02.000 --> 06:08.000
We have folks that you've heard on the show plenty of times before say hello to JD, joining us again tonight.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
Hi.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
Hi. How are you?

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
Doing pretty well.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
Yeah, good, good. What's new with you since the last time we saw you?

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
I moved to Japantown.

06:15.000 --> 06:24.000
That's right. So you're within walking distance of all that fun stuff that's, you know, everybody likes to crash San Francisco in the area during the Sakura Cherry Blossom Festival, right?

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
Yeah, I actually moved during the second weekend of that.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
Oh, of that. What good timing.

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
I'm sure that was a lot of fun. Just pull up the U-Haul right next to all that other...

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
Made it work.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
Yeah, you made it work. Good, good. You survived?

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
I think so.

06:35.000 --> 06:41.000
And now you're within walking distance of that cute little arcade there that has, like, pop-in music and some of our old music game favorites, right?

06:41.000 --> 06:51.000
Yeah. Two pop-ins, a DDRX3, a Rhythm Tengoku arcade, which is not something I'd seen anywhere else, and a Taiko... I think it's Taiko 9.

06:51.000 --> 07:00.000
Nice. Well, that's fun. So, congrats on the move. And good thing you got out of the city this weekend because Beta Breakers is going on right now, or was earlier today, right?

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
Yeah, it was today. It's a mess.

07:02.000 --> 07:08.000
A lot of people are probably still hungover. If you don't know what this is, it's like only in San Francisco is Beta Breakers. It's...

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
Alan is also joining us. Hubby, Alan is here.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
Hello.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
Hi, how are you?

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
I'm good.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
You were about to explain for us what Beta Breakers is.

07:16.000 --> 07:25.000
I was gonna say it's sort of a race question mark. A silly walk fitness question mark.

07:25.000 --> 07:39.000
Basically, they walk from the west side to the east side... no, east side to the west side of San Francisco in costumes, and there's lots of day drinking, and lots of people are naked, and it's basically... it just shuts down the city and makes traffic a shit show.

07:39.000 --> 07:46.000
Sounds very San Francisco. Anyway, let me talk to JD a little more, and I'm gonna come back to you, Alan, in a little bit for our little kickoff topic tonight.

07:47.000 --> 07:56.000
But JD, so I guess this kind of gets into our gaming week a little bit, but I know you've been playing console stuff as has I. We have other things we can talk about, but you and I took a little arcade adventure yesterday.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
Yeah.

07:57.000 --> 08:08.000
We went out to the arcade that I talked about a couple weeks ago on the show, where... because I wanted you to be able to play Pump It Up, which I knew they had. I wanted you to see this little bootleg machine that took over our show for two weeks, right?

08:08.000 --> 08:15.000
I wanted you to see like all the cool stuff they had. And then, so we got there and found that there's more, like the machines have been mating.

08:15.000 --> 08:22.000
There was now a Sound Voltex machine and a U-Beat. Two of them. Two U-Beats. Which is kind of the one...

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
Is this all like, what's his name? The guy that...

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
It is.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
I thought so, because he keeps moving his machines.

08:28.000 --> 08:36.000
All the stuff that used to... it's like the presence that used to be at Scandi is now over here. It took us a little while to figure that out, but that's apparently what's happening.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
Well, his name is on the Sound Voltex machine.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
Yes.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
When you log in with EMUs, like it says it's his.

08:41.000 --> 08:47.000
Yeah, yeah. Which I finally got to play Sound Voltex for the first time. Because every time I go to round one, like even when we go early, we'll go to round one like open.

08:47.000 --> 08:55.000
Because that's when it's the least crowded, right? We always go to these things early. That's what old people do. They get up early and they go to mall walks, right?

08:55.000 --> 09:06.000
They walk around the mall. So we did the mall walking at round one. And there's actually the Sound Voltex machines will also have people on them that early.

09:07.000 --> 09:18.000
So I usually never am able to get in and play that game, but I was finally able to play it. It was fun. I liked it. I still kind of like... I kind of like Neon FM a little more, I think.

09:18.000 --> 09:23.000
Which might be... I don't know. That might be Sacrilegion, some circles. I don't know. Maybe it's just because this...

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
They're different games.

09:24.000 --> 09:34.000
They're very different games. They're also very different song lists. And I don't... it's hard to explain. Like I just don't... like the J-pop stuff doesn't resonate with me the way that it used to.

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
I mean, a good portion of the song list these days is Vocaloid and Toho, so...

09:38.000 --> 09:52.000
That's very true as well, so. But what was I gonna say? So I... but when I played Neon FM, like my hands were hurting. Like just from slamming all the... you know, because it's basically... it's basically pop music, but like, you know, five...

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
With flat pads instead of popping out buttons.

09:55.000 --> 10:00.000
But I had a good time. So we had a good time on our arcade adventure. Was there a favorite thing that you played?

10:00.000 --> 10:11.000
Oh, man. You know... I think it's probably... I'm gonna be lame. It's... it's... it was a tie between the StepMania cabinet and the DDR 2014.

10:11.000 --> 10:16.000
Because you're old school. You like dancing. Even though those pads were moving as you were dancing. That's so funny.

10:16.000 --> 10:28.000
Oh, man. Yeah. They... so I played doubles a lot. And these pads were not anchored down nearly enough. So I was playing and they moved probably like a foot and a half or something. And I had to move them back after each song.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
Alright.

10:29.000 --> 10:34.000
I thought they had feet on those things. They probably do, but they weren't using them.

10:34.000 --> 10:41.000
They weren't planted down very well. Alright. Well, I'm going to introduce here because she walked into the studio as we were having that little discussion.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
Hi, Dark Soccer or Jamie Summers.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
Hi, I'm on Sister Time.

10:45.000 --> 10:55.000
Oh, because you're running late. I got it. I was like, wait a minute, wait a minute. I've heard... I've heard gay time. I've heard a lot of different, you know, descriptions for why somebody runs late, but Sister Time.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
That's the same family.

10:56.000 --> 11:00.000
Yeah, it's all in the same family. It really is. I thought you'd still have full white face like I saw on Facebook earlier.

11:00.000 --> 11:14.000
I actually came home relatively in enough time, but I was so exhausted that I passed out. Like I sat on my bed. I washed my face off. Everything was fine. I sat on my bed. Midna comes in and then dead.

11:14.000 --> 11:18.000
The heat here right now is no joke though. Like it's already summer weather.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
We had some nice shade. We were all shady.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
Of course.

11:22.000 --> 11:26.000
But I got to meet some of the San Francisco sisters and made some new friends.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
Good.

11:27.000 --> 11:38.000
And it was just nice seeing, you know, seeing the smiles and recognition and people seeing their mood light up by having the sisters and pride.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
In that freaking heat. I mean, the fact that you guys did all that.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
That wasn't terrible.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
Really? That's good.

11:43.000 --> 11:50.000
Well, out in the sun. Yeah, it was terra bad. But in the shade, it was really nice. We sat out. We had wine.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
Okay. That's why you passed out drinking in this heat.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
Girl.

11:54.000 --> 11:59.000
No, I had like a little sippy cup of wine with a straw in it because I was wearing white face.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
So I was drinking my Prosecco through a straw, which is classy as fuck.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
Like a lady.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
Like a lady.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
Yeah.

12:05.000 --> 12:10.000
But there was like a nice like an Italian ice place. It was really yummy.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
Oh, yeah.

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
Especially in the weather. And I found out that lemon and cherry mix very well.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
Yes, they do.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
And there were vendors there and there was no parade because it's Davis.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
Right.

12:19.000 --> 12:23.000
But there were lots of vendors there and people singing and cheerleaders.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
Mm hmm.

12:24.000 --> 12:29.000
You know, they would like you pay them a dollar for their cheer thing and they would do a jump or a cartwheel.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
One of the gals from Drag Race was supposed to be there, right? Trinity?

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
Trinity was supposed to be there, but I didn't see her.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
Oh, that's too bad.

12:34.000 --> 12:44.000
But I also left when the things were still going on because I as a postulant, I have to stay with my big sister or at least one of the other sisters.

12:44.000 --> 12:55.000
And since they were all leaving to go to the coronation tonight or the investment for the local court, I got the OK to stay with the San Francisco sisters.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
So we just hung out dishing and it was great.

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
It's a lip sync. What part of that don't you understand?

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
Just kidding.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
OK. OK.

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
It just clicked for her. It just clicked for her when I was raising.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
No, no, no, no, no, no, don't because some people haven't watched it.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
All right.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
All right. I'm just going to say this.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
I am disappointed doubly.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
Video games.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
This is a video game show.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
The other show is about this.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
But that bitch.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
All right. Anyway.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
OK.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
I had a Tyra moment.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
I had a Tyra moment.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
We all did. We all did.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
All right. Look.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
Speaking of that bitch, Alan.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
Just kidding.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
Hearts.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
How have you been?

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
We haven't heard from you in a while.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
Fine.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
I know your day's office switched around a little bit.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
I'm on a new schedule.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
Yeah, you're able to you're able to join us now on Sunday night.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
So I like that a lot.

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
So I want to talk VR with you a little bit.

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
So you got a new toy this week, right?

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
Yes.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
Tell us a little bit about it.

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
I got a Galaxy S8 on launch day.

13:54.000 --> 13:59.000
And they had it because my my previous phone was literally dying and I was practically unusable.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
So the timing was great.

14:01.000 --> 14:05.000
And they had a promotion where if you got a Galaxy S8,

14:06.000 --> 14:11.000
which is the first phone that they've released since the Note 7 like was blowing up,

14:11.000 --> 14:15.000
like in people's hands and spraying, spraying battery acid everywhere.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
So this was kind of a big deal release.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Literally banned in all airports.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
Yeah.

14:20.000 --> 14:29.000
And you got if you got the S8 in a certain window, you got a Gear VR, which is Samsung's at home

14:29.000 --> 14:35.000
Oculus equivalent VR device that uses your phone.

14:35.000 --> 14:39.000
You actually pop your phone into the front of it.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
And it arrived Thursday and I've been messing around with it.

14:42.000 --> 14:48.000
So tell us a little bit about what you like what you've been using the device for.

14:48.000 --> 14:53.000
I did get a code that had a bunch of like cheap games on it for free.

14:53.000 --> 14:57.000
I've been checking them out and I bought a couple for like four or five bucks each.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
You've been spending money on that? No, I'm just kidding.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
My favorite one so far is the scary one.

15:02.000 --> 15:08.000
Not because it's scary, but I just feel like the way that the hand controller is used as your flashlight

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
and the way the VR looks when you're walking through the house.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
What's the name of it? Do you know?

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
Affected the Manner.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
Okay.

15:14.000 --> 15:21.000
There are three other or two other episodes, but they're for the Oculus proper

15:21.000 --> 15:25.000
because the Oculus Rift you hook up to a PC, I believe, and the PC runs the game.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
Yeah, right.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
And it's pipe to the thing. This all has to be run on your phone.

15:29.000 --> 15:34.000
So even though the S8 is, I think, the strongest processing power of all the phones on the market,

15:34.000 --> 15:39.000
at least I would hope it is, it's still not going to be at the level of what an Oculus can do

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
simply because you hook an Oculus up to a computer.

15:42.000 --> 15:45.000
And Tiger Claw on our chat is asking, is it the regular S8 or the S8 Plus?

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
S8 Plus.

15:46.000 --> 15:50.000
Yeah, I was going to say you have the larger phone like I do with the iPhone 6 Plus.

15:50.000 --> 15:54.000
They do have, I don't know if you've tried it yet, they have something that you can actually run on your PC

15:54.000 --> 15:59.000
and stream it to your phone like actual Oculus proper games using that.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
Oh.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
Something to try.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
Yeah, for sure.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
Yeah, I wonder how that would.

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
Since you probably have a pretty powerful PC then, you know, that might.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
Yeah.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
Or you could use Bluetooth or Wi-Fi or whatever.

16:09.000 --> 16:13.000
Yeah, you could even use my PC to do it too because we just upgraded mine.

16:13.000 --> 16:17.000
I was trying to get you to play one or two games before the show so you could talk about it a little.

16:17.000 --> 16:21.000
Yeah, I've had a lot of personal stuff going on today so I wasn't able to get around to doing that.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
But I'm curious to check it out.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
But let's.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
Okay, look.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
This is Orange Tons Radio.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
Y'all heard the warning in the beginning.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
This is an adult audiences show.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
Yeah.

16:30.000 --> 16:36.000
So let's not hold back because everybody fucking knows what we did with that thing first.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
Yes.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
Of course, it's VR porn.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
I mean, that's.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
That's what we did at the Oculus Dev Kids.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
Let's look at porn on this.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
Ding, ding, ding.

16:47.000 --> 16:51.000
Even Bobby Black Wolf and his family friendly show.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
Fantastic.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
He knows.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
It's like so weird.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
I mean.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
It's not sexy.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
That man knows.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
That man knows.

16:58.000 --> 17:03.000
The very first time I saw this VR stuff, you know, he was like, okay, here's the roller coaster sim.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
And isn't that kind of neat?

17:04.000 --> 17:08.000
And here's the, okay, here's the walk around the house and look at all this stuff, sim.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
And then, you know, I'm doing all these things.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
He's like, all right, I know you want to see the porn.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
Here's the porn.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
So I got to see.

17:14.000 --> 17:18.000
You just need to combine the two because everyone does the roller coasters and porn.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
We need a porno coaster.

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
And then you download, you know, glory, hallelujah.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
Is that what, is that what y'all sang in church today, sisters?

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
All right.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
Here's the thing.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
Here's the thing.

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
Well, on that note, believe it or not, here's the thing.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
Bobby Black Wolf being a heterosexual male.

17:34.000 --> 17:40.000
I know that the porn I was going to see on that was going to be, you know, a lady who is going to walk over and

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
fillet me in the first person.

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
And that was, that was what the porno was that I watched.

17:45.000 --> 17:51.000
However, I don't know if any, I'm sure any podcast has talked about VR and VR porn probably has talked about that.

17:51.000 --> 17:55.000
But has any podcast talked about gay pornography in the VR?

17:55.000 --> 17:58.000
Because we're about to go there, ladies and gentlemen.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
I know it exists.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
Yes, it exists.

18:00.000 --> 18:05.000
And I'm not going to get super detailed, but I didn't say Alan wouldn't get it super detailed.

18:05.000 --> 18:13.000
Alan, tell us about the gay porn on the VR.

18:13.000 --> 18:22.000
The fact that it's first person so that it's happening in quotey fingers to you is very strange and jarring because everything is up close in your face.

18:22.000 --> 18:26.000
Like, you see everything.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
You see, you see glory, glory, hallelujah.

18:29.000 --> 18:34.000
You see Christmas and New Year's.

18:34.000 --> 18:41.000
And it's like, there are certain models that probably don't want to be in front of that camera because they're like, you know what, my butthole isn't that photogenic.

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
You could tell that was a freshly waxed vehicle.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
Yes.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
Like that was just, it was a bit much.

18:48.000 --> 18:55.000
And they say that that bleaching it is an urban legend, but I'm convinced that it's real because I think this boy had it done.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
Anyway.

18:56.000 --> 19:01.000
And basically, I hear the clicks across America in the world of people shutting off the show.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
Those are like clicks.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
I hope, I hope.

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
But anyway, dialing it back just a little bit.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
Like, what, what?

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
These things are all like first person and all that.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
But here's, here's the $50,000 question.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
Is it hot?

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
No.

19:17.000 --> 19:22.000
So the other thing that threw me off about it was that it was just a static video.

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
Like, I mean, it was, it wasn't interactive at all.

19:25.000 --> 19:31.000
And I mean, when we were talking about VR and this heavily immersive experience, I was kind of expecting to have more agency.

19:31.000 --> 19:39.000
You know, like, you can see, like, even in the lobby of the Oculus, you walk around, you look at things, you do stuff, it responds to you.

19:39.000 --> 19:42.000
This was just, it felt like a 3D movie or something.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
And it wasn't.

19:43.000 --> 19:51.000
There are some that have 360 view where if you want to turn your back on the boy wanking in the bed and just look out the window, you can.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
Yeah.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
You're like, ooh, I'm sorry.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
What have I done with my life?

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
I'm interrupting you.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
You're like, I'll give you some privacy and you turn around.

19:59.000 --> 20:02.000
I feel like it needed to go farther to do something for me.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
Yeah.

20:03.000 --> 20:08.000
And when I, I started laughing and when I put, I'm like, you have to watch this one.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
Cause I found some free trailers that were like 40 seconds long.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
You were like screaming.

20:12.000 --> 20:18.000
I was, I was screaming, laughing, like doing the full on, like, like I just, I, it was, it was funny.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Porn's funny.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
It's not hot.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
It's not hot at all.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
At all.

20:23.000 --> 20:33.000
And I thought maybe like, it's going to be a scene just in 3d where I'm like this weird ghost person watching them, but no, it's through the perspective of it happening to you, which makes it far more shocking.

20:33.000 --> 20:40.000
It's like the, it's like the first time I can look down and not see my stomach just hanging there.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
You're like, oh, I have abs.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
I want, I want it for this.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
That was the hottest fucking part of it.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
Get, get the, get the other guy out of the way.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
I want to look down and see abs.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
JV wants to jump in here.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
See, now I have to invent glory.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
Hallelujah.

20:53.000 --> 20:58.000
Because it would come with like, it would come with a peripheral.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
Yeah, I bet it would bitch.

21:00.000 --> 21:05.000
It would come with an interactive peripheral that's based off of stimulation from the game.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
Copyright Jamie forever.

21:07.000 --> 21:14.000
That's, that's where they've already beat you to it because they already have devices that work with those, those, we saw that three years ago.

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
The E3, feel three or whatever that thing was.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
I think that was before VR.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
I didn't think that had like attachments.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
You just did it.

21:21.000 --> 21:24.000
That thing had like a little wanker.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
Like what is, what do they call that thing?

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
The wank mode.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
No.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
The flashlight.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
Thank you.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
It's a flesh, I knew you'd know it.

21:32.000 --> 21:39.000
It was, it was a fleshlight type attachment that you used when you were doing that, but it was more like a second life type of game, I think.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
Yeah, it was.

21:40.000 --> 21:49.000
And I remember boy play girl, whatever, but see, but see that, that I want to make that an OLR dream game now.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
All right.

21:50.000 --> 22:01.000
And I, but to, to defend Bobby's honor a little bit, he is in chat saying, Rob, I would have totally had it available for you if it was around and I was showing you the DK one.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
They just had, it's true that didn't come around.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
They hadn't invented gay porn yet.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
That came later.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
There's just one website that I found.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
Yeah.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
Cause I was like, there's gotta be something.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
Exactly right.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
And I just found this one site.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
Yeah.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
So the games that I have.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
Oh yeah.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
Video games.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
Right.

22:16.000 --> 22:23.000
Well, one issue that I have, especially with affected the manner, the scary game is that they're all, they're like basically four different paths.

22:23.000 --> 22:26.000
You can go down, but they all end ultimately the same way.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
It's not really a game.

22:28.000 --> 22:36.000
And I noticed that a lot of these VR experiences, they're not even like gone home or something where it's like a first person narrative.

22:37.000 --> 22:40.000
You're sort of like walking through and like, Oh, this is trippy.

22:40.000 --> 22:44.000
Oh, I really like how it uses the flashlight effect and then jump scare.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
And then it's over.

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
And it's like, there's no puzzles.

22:46.000 --> 22:49.000
And it's, that's not the only game that was like that.

22:49.000 --> 22:56.000
And so it's kind of weird to find out, is this really a game or is this just like a neat thing to last me like 20 minutes of just.

22:56.000 --> 23:01.000
I think it's still because all VR, all this VR stuff is still in that gimmick phase.

23:01.000 --> 23:05.000
It's just like, you know, with the DS and we, and so they don't really know how to utilize the hardware well.

23:05.000 --> 23:09.000
So it's all these experimental, like, Oh, that's a neat idea.

23:09.000 --> 23:15.000
Let's do that a million times, you know, not really utilizing it in an innovative way.

23:15.000 --> 23:27.000
Like I think right now, the best thing we have like for VR, probably Resident Evil 7 is probably going to be one of the strongest examples of like a AAA game done exclusively in VR.

23:27.000 --> 23:30.000
Well, PlayStation VR is doing a lot right in that department.

23:31.000 --> 23:40.000
But in, but in a way, I mean, just to be fair, you know, when we, when we talked a lot about this, when Facebook bought Oculus and it was like, Oh my God, why would Facebook do this?

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
And that all this stuff.

23:41.000 --> 23:45.000
And we were kind of like, well, wait a minute, maybe there's more to VR than just gaming.

23:45.000 --> 23:53.000
So to be fair, you know, a lot of these experiences and videos, you know, I know we're having fun talking about porn, but we've, we've seen other stuff in VR too.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
I mean, I remember seeing a Cirque du Soleil thing.

23:55.000 --> 24:03.000
I saw like the, the last Paul McCartney concert at Candlestick Park, you know, before they closed Candlestick Park down, they, there was a VR thing for that.

24:03.000 --> 24:06.000
So like, you know, it's definitely shown that there can be experiences.

24:06.000 --> 24:11.000
And I would think, especially when it comes to mobile devices and stuff, games are not going to be the strong point of mobile devices.

24:11.000 --> 24:17.000
It's going to be these more like immersive, like, Oh, it's almost like I was there type of experience.

24:18.000 --> 24:24.000
You know, like I'm surprised maybe that did exist, but Coachella didn't have like a VR thing where you could be a Coachella virtually.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
It probably did exist.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
I just didn't see it.

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
There's this thing on here like that where it's Major Lazer and Diplo.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
Yeah.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
And watch him on stage.

24:31.000 --> 24:36.000
But now you go to PlayStation and PlayStation's bread and butter is games.

24:36.000 --> 24:40.000
So I would hope that the strongest stuff over there is going to be games.

24:40.000 --> 24:43.000
And so far that does seem to be true between Resident Evil 7.

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
It's hit and miss.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
A lot of people love the rush of blood.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
I love rush of blood.

24:47.000 --> 24:51.000
I think that's for if you're going to get PlayStation VR, pick that up first.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
Twenty bucks.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
Great value for what you get.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
It's such a great game.

24:55.000 --> 24:58.000
Well, and then Thumper was one because I'm thinking of that.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
I was thinking that because that came out on Switch and JD.

25:00.000 --> 25:04.000
You were thinking like, do I want to get because I like music games, but rhythm violence.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.000
What the hell is that?

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
So I was like, all right, let's put this on because I have it on PlayStation four.

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
Let's play it.

25:08.000 --> 25:13.000
And I was like, you have to imagine this in VR because it's like twice as good when it's in VR.

25:14.000 --> 25:18.000
The thing about Thumper was that it just wasn't musical enough for me to really get going with it.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
Like it was definitely rhythmic.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
It's not J-pop.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
Well, it wasn't even that.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
There was no melody.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
Yeah, like it was just all percussive.

25:25.000 --> 25:30.000
And I'm like, you know, I can kind of keep the beat and stuff, but it just wasn't fun the same way.

25:31.000 --> 25:36.000
Interesting because Bobby points out a lot of those videos are also available on PlayStation VR.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
The Paul McCartney one is in the Jaunt VR app.

25:38.000 --> 25:41.000
Well, I guess and I guess that doesn't make sense because technically, I mean, yes,

25:41.000 --> 25:47.000
I say the PlayStation is bread and butter is games, but the reality is it's also a Netflix device.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
They sell movies on it.

25:48.000 --> 25:54.000
They do these this live events viewer thing that I'm sure later in the show, we'll talk about E3 and all that.

25:54.000 --> 25:58.000
You know, that is all part of PlayStation stuff as well.

25:58.000 --> 26:01.000
But even when it comes down to Sony, they're a media company.

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
That's true.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
That's true. Not just televisions.

26:03.000 --> 26:07.000
Then the Oculus is actually what powers the Gear VR.

26:07.000 --> 26:12.000
Like it's their storefront and it's their, I guess, API or UI that you navigate on the phone.

26:12.000 --> 26:18.000
So there are 3D movies like X-Men Days of Future Past that I could buy on this to see a 3D movie.

26:18.000 --> 26:25.000
But the idea of even just laying in bed with this thing on my head watching a full movie for two hours seems very strange.

26:25.000 --> 26:29.000
I don't want to I'd rather watch it on an at home 3D TV, which we have.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
Yeah, but to be fair, it sucks.

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
Like the 3D TV, it sucks.

26:34.000 --> 26:37.000
Those glasses don't even work anymore. It sucks.

26:38.000 --> 26:42.000
The game that I was playing that was actually a really good puzzle game is called Rangi.

26:42.000 --> 26:50.000
And I don't want to say it's portalesque, but basically you're in a room and you see the door that you're supposed to exit through and the color tile above the door is orange.

26:50.000 --> 26:54.000
And you look and you see like a blue beam and a red beam and a yellow beam.

26:54.000 --> 26:58.000
Well, if you're trying to get the color orange, the blue beam is like a red hair.

26:58.000 --> 27:06.000
Like you don't care about the blue beam because you want to slide these tiles over so that the red and the yellow merge.

27:06.000 --> 27:11.000
And then you direct the orange beam at the door and then the door unlocks and you go to the next room.

27:11.000 --> 27:15.000
That I thought was really cool because you look up and you're like, oh, there's a cliff up there.

27:15.000 --> 27:21.000
So then you click and you teleport up there and you find that there's another tile for you to flip to reflect the laser or whatever.

27:21.000 --> 27:24.000
I thought that was a neat game. So I want to play more of that.

27:24.000 --> 27:38.000
And then I have Drop Dead, which is a zombie game, but it's more like Time Crisis or where you lower your thing to reload and it's very fast and the zombies are just running at you.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
So it's not really scary at all.

27:40.000 --> 27:47.000
And Dragonfront, which is kind of like chess meets Magic the Gathering, but it's in, of course, 3D VR.

27:47.000 --> 27:53.000
So you take your card and you put it down and it pops up and it turns into a little knight.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
Oh, it's like I have judgment.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
Yeah. Yeah.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
Wow. OK.

27:57.000 --> 28:01.000
Well, that. Yeah. But those had a real element to it. This is all in a virtual space.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
Fair enough. Yeah.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
But it's neat.

28:05.000 --> 28:06.000
Now, let me ask this question.

28:06.000 --> 28:13.000
I was going to say I wanted to try to get the Power Rangers thing they have for it to show Shane because the first we're like, hey, Shane, I have a gear VR.

28:13.000 --> 28:17.000
There's porn on it. And he was immediately like, I'm not listening to anything you're ever going to say after this.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
Right. Shutting down.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
We offended his delegate sensibilities.

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
Right.

28:21.000 --> 28:26.000
But I imagine if I had the Power Rangers movie VR experience on it, he would have tried it.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
Gimme, gimme, gimme.

28:27.000 --> 28:32.000
It's exclusive to some weird device that's also competing in the Oculus gear VR space.

28:32.000 --> 28:35.000
So I don't remember. Bobby might know.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
Was it a dream?

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
I think possibly.

28:39.000 --> 28:44.000
So, yeah, I was looking for that, but I'm like, no, it's an exclusive because I want to see Power Rangers in VR.

28:44.000 --> 28:51.000
Well, thank you for playing some games in VR and, you know, telling us a little bit about it, especially since I failed to do so this week.

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
But let me ask this.

28:52.000 --> 28:57.000
So since you have been doing a little bit of VR gaming this week, you're now the show's VR expert.

28:57.000 --> 29:00.000
Oh, I guess, I guess, Loki.

29:00.000 --> 29:11.000
Also, you said conditionally that the only reason why you were trying it out the first night that I got it is because it literally uses my phone and the device so that I couldn't record you using it.

29:11.000 --> 29:14.000
That was only when we were watching Christmas and New Year's.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
So, okay.

29:15.000 --> 29:18.000
So what was I gonna say? Oh, I know.

29:18.000 --> 29:21.000
So let me ask this about your kind of VR experience.

29:21.000 --> 29:27.000
So games that you play a lot of online, Mass Effect Andromeda, I know is one you're still playing a lot.

29:27.000 --> 29:33.000
Despite everything we talked about, about that show in the past, or about that game in the past couple of weeks, you are still very loyal to Andromeda.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.000
Yes.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
You play multiplayer and all that stuff, right?

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
Would you play something like that in a VR space?

29:39.000 --> 29:45.000
Does that appeal to you, being able to, you know, obviously, I know your phone doesn't have that power, but let's just put all that aside.

29:45.000 --> 29:51.000
Let's assume that the capability was there that you could play something like Andromeda in a VR space, would you?

29:54.000 --> 30:06.000
I would feel like, because when I'm in a space to play an RPG like that, I'll put in a couple hours worth and I just can't, even if I've trained myself up to being used to having the VR thing on my face for that long.

30:06.000 --> 30:11.000
I just, it's so, I mean, it is isolating. You've got this thing on your head.

30:11.000 --> 30:19.000
So I think it's going to be mostly a casual experience until they become more like glasses that you can slide on and off.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
I don't know how to describe it.

30:20.000 --> 30:25.000
I'm trying to think of a game that I play now. Like, I was looking for a music game.

30:25.000 --> 30:33.000
Like, of course, Rez would be incredible on this, but again, that's very, like, you do a stage, then the stage is over, then you can stop.

30:33.000 --> 30:34.000
Right.

30:34.000 --> 30:37.000
So it's very, it's broken down into little bite-sized pieces.

30:37.000 --> 30:44.000
And that's actually kind of my thing with it too, is that actually, well, I don't know, I think I might just need to calibrate it better for my head because I was getting a lot of the double vision stuff.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
Yeah, you shouldn't be getting that at all.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
My eyes were shifting in and out of focus, like really bad.

30:48.000 --> 30:53.000
And I think, and that like can really give me a headache after a few minutes, at least with this particular device.

30:53.000 --> 30:59.000
But, you know, I actually, I would say, you know, I realize it isn't VR, it's completely different.

30:59.000 --> 31:06.000
But one of the better experiences I had was with HoloLens, because those were like glasses you put on your head and they didn't like pull on my eyes or any of that stuff.

31:06.000 --> 31:11.000
Like, that's why I was able, I did that whole mystery game thing that Bobby had me go through.

31:11.000 --> 31:17.000
And that was a lot of fun. And I was able to, that was a good, maybe 30 minutes that, you know, and I didn't feel anything after that.

31:17.000 --> 31:22.000
Whereas five minutes of all the stuff we were doing, I was like, okay, I need, I need to take a break.

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
Yeah.

31:24.000 --> 31:30.000
So, let's see. I'm going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com. Bobby answers your question here.

31:30.000 --> 31:36.000
The Power Rangers stuff is only on Qualcomm's, Qualcomm's, oops, Snapdragon VR platform.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
Okay.

31:37.000 --> 31:38.000
Which literally nobody has.

31:38.000 --> 31:44.000
SSG100Matt says, I've seen the VR porn on the Gear VR. It's really meh and more ridiculous than anything.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.000
I wasn't expecting anything ridiculous.

31:45.000 --> 31:54.000
The other thing I got too, which you might want to try, it's, there's this Google Card, or a thing that allow you play Google Cardboard apps as well using that.

31:54.000 --> 31:58.000
That's another good one to get because there's a lot more that's available through the Google Play Store.

31:58.000 --> 32:04.000
And Google's own home VR thing is coming out soon, I think. The Dream or no?

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
No, Dream's already out with the Pixel.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.000
Okay.

32:07.000 --> 32:14.000
That was the first phone that, but now, I mean, we'll get into it a little bit later, but like the Samsung Galaxy S8 is going to support Dream as well.

32:14.000 --> 32:21.000
I mean, I don't know. It's just, it's basically, they're trying to make like a platform, okay, these phones are powerful enough to run this.

32:21.000 --> 32:28.000
Kind of like how these graphics cards are VAR ready type thing. These phones are VR ready or VR AR ready or something like that.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
What was the puzzle game that I played a bit of? Do you remember?

32:30.000 --> 32:31.000
Lands End.

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
That one was really cool.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.000
Which you liked.

32:34.000 --> 32:42.000
Yeah. It reminded me a lot of Monument Valley a bit with the kind of episodic do a little bit of a puzzle here and then move on to the next area.

32:42.000 --> 32:48.000
But it was really pretty. Like it takes place on a beach. And I mean, I'm a sucker for that kind of environment.

32:48.000 --> 32:55.000
But it was mostly like just connecting line puzzles, but I thought it was fun, at least the first area.

32:55.000 --> 32:59.000
Yeah. And I need to check that out because I think you've played that more than me.

32:59.000 --> 33:05.000
And then I downloaded this one thing called Groove VR, Groover, thinking it was a music game.

33:05.000 --> 33:13.000
But basically it's a very, it's like you're floating and there's like the sort of sea punk, like dolphins going through the sky.

33:13.000 --> 33:17.000
And it's like, I don't smoke enough weed or take shrooms to be, for this to be enjoyable.

33:17.000 --> 33:23.000
But it plays techno music and you're kind of just floating through and there's like a big Buddha statue with like green smoke coming out of its eyes.

33:23.000 --> 33:26.000
I'm like, all right, this is like, it's like, yeah, yeah, we get it. You vape.

33:26.000 --> 33:33.000
Yeah. It's basically, think of it as a 3D black light poster. That's exactly what it is.

33:33.000 --> 33:39.000
It's a 3D black light poster. So, yeah, that's all. It's a thing that I have.

33:39.000 --> 33:43.000
All right. No, I do want to try more of it when real life settles down a little bit.

33:43.000 --> 33:50.000
But yeah, I mean, that's yeah. I'm glad that you brought VR into the house. Bobby's probably very glad you brought VR into the house.

33:50.000 --> 33:54.000
So I'm curious to try out more stuff that isn't, you know, laughable.

33:54.000 --> 34:00.000
Yeah. After you get this laptop, it sounds like, oh, hey, I maybe I should get a vibe. They saw $800 and like, fuck that noise.

34:00.000 --> 34:04.000
Yeah. Yeah. Right. But I'm going to give Dark Sakura her mic back now so you can participate in the show.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
All right. Well, thank you for being here, Alan. Appreciate it.

34:06.000 --> 34:10.000
You're welcome. All right. Find some more porn. All right. Let me ask, we had a story about VR here.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
We want to do at the top of the show too on a related note, right?

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
Yeah. Yeah. We can talk about that.

34:14.000 --> 34:22.000
Yeah. So maybe the whole Google IO thing, which is pretty cool because I actually watched that a bit and there was some exciting announcements there showing off.

34:22.000 --> 34:30.000
Of course, they talked a bit about VR, talking about, you know, the Google Dream platform or Daydream platform.

34:30.000 --> 34:38.000
And some of the things they announced with that, as I mentioned, that they're adding the Galaxy S8 to the lineup of phones that are going to be supporting it.

34:38.000 --> 34:46.000
There's also a new LG phone that's supporting it. I don't remember which phone it was, but a new LG phone is also going to be supporting the platform.

34:47.000 --> 34:57.000
They're saying that they're also working on some standalone devices. So some that you won't actually need a phone to be able to play VR content on.

34:57.000 --> 35:03.000
Which, I mean, it's a good idea, I guess, as long as they're significantly cheaper than the phones.

35:03.000 --> 35:09.000
Because honestly, if you're going to need a phone, the devices themselves aren't really that expensive.

35:09.000 --> 35:23.000
I mean, even if you're not necessarily picking up a Dream or the Daydream or the Gear VR, I mean, you can get cheap ass cardboard for pretty much nothing.

35:23.000 --> 35:29.000
I mean, so, I don't know. But yeah, these standalone devices are saying they're not going to require a phone or PC.

35:29.000 --> 35:34.000
Instead, you're going to be getting VR as simple as putting on the actual headset.

35:34.000 --> 35:41.000
And it's going to be optimized for VR and include new headset tracking technology called WorldSense.

35:41.000 --> 35:46.000
Which is positional tracking without all the extra sensors.

35:46.000 --> 35:53.000
So it sounds like a lot, kind of what they're talking about with Microsoft's, the headsets that they're making for them.

35:53.000 --> 36:02.000
Where it's going to be using, instead of having external cameras tracking the actual headset, the headset's tracking kind of the environment.

36:03.000 --> 36:08.000
It also kind of sounds like the console of VR in a way, right? Because that's what consoles are, right?

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
They hook up directly to your TV and it's a game-dedicated device.

36:10.000 --> 36:13.000
Honestly though, I mean, that's cool if you're going to launch that.

36:13.000 --> 36:23.000
But I'm wary, just even with what's available on the Oculus Store and what's available on the Play Store.

36:23.000 --> 36:28.000
There's not really anything that justifies having a standalone device using this.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
Unless it's going to take a lot of that PC stuff.

36:30.000 --> 36:34.000
But then you're just kind of like, well, how much is this thing really going to cost?

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
And if it's going to run PC content.

36:36.000 --> 36:41.000
I just have a hard time seeing how that would be worth it.

36:41.000 --> 36:45.000
I'm getting a little worried too, and I have been for some time.

36:45.000 --> 36:51.000
And you all know this is my concern, is that I'm really worried this VR pool is super diluted right now.

36:51.000 --> 36:54.000
Like, I'm not saying there should be only one player in VR.

36:54.000 --> 36:55.000
Like, I'm not saying that at all.

36:55.000 --> 36:59.000
But I'm having a really hard time keeping track of all these different devices.

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
I'm having to defer to Bobby Blackwell constantly.

37:01.000 --> 37:05.000
What's that thing called? What's the Power Rangers thing on?

37:05.000 --> 37:08.000
I just don't fucking know, and I kind of think that's a problem.

37:08.000 --> 37:15.000
I don't know, I guess if I asked a non-video gamer what are the consoles available.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
They would not be able to say off the top of their head,

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
They would not be able to do that.

37:21.000 --> 37:27.000
I just can't help but feel like we've got so many choices that that can't be productive, right?

37:27.000 --> 37:32.000
But with that said though, what they're showing off with the AR stuff actually is really cool.

37:32.000 --> 37:37.000
So with the whole visual positioning service that they're basically putting into these phones,

37:37.000 --> 37:42.000
it allows it to basically kind of track your movement and everything based on your environment.

37:42.000 --> 37:49.000
And because they know where you are based on your GPS, and they kind of know what you're looking at with their contextual AI,

37:49.000 --> 37:54.000
they're able to do kind of some neat stuff.

37:54.000 --> 37:57.000
So for example, one of the things that they showed off is like,

37:57.000 --> 38:02.000
okay, you're looking at a restaurant on the street and you get kind of a pop-up showing,

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
okay, here are the reviews for this restaurant.

38:04.000 --> 38:08.000
It knew what you were looking at. It was kind of like, okay, showing you information about that.

38:08.000 --> 38:13.000
And so I can see that being kind of cool, especially if the tracking gets better.

38:13.000 --> 38:16.000
I mean, you could do all sorts of cool stuff with that with AR.

38:16.000 --> 38:19.000
So that's kind of what I think is a little bit more interesting.

38:19.000 --> 38:22.000
I'm all for them putting more money into the VR stuff.

38:22.000 --> 38:28.000
The other cool thing they were showing off was also this AR pioneer program.

38:28.000 --> 38:32.000
So what that was is basically AR for classrooms.

38:32.000 --> 38:39.000
So they had these sets that looked like they were on selfie sticks with a phone,

38:39.000 --> 38:48.000
and they were actually doing different educational experiences.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
So, okay, we're going to see what a tornado looks like,

38:50.000 --> 38:54.000
or we're going to look at the galaxy or watch a volcano,

38:54.000 --> 38:55.000
and they can walk around and look at it.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
And I was like, that's pretty cool.

38:57.000 --> 39:02.000
For kids, that's really going to get them engaged and kind of learning everything.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.000
So that's kind of cool.

39:03.000 --> 39:04.000
Yeah, that's pretty cool.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
Again, showing my age here a little bit,

39:06.000 --> 39:11.000
but I lived through that age when VHS devices were new in the homes.

39:11.000 --> 39:14.000
I was young, like five, six, but still.

39:14.000 --> 39:19.000
And I remember just educational tapes so that I could watch Leonard Nimoy

39:19.000 --> 39:20.000
animating a movie.

39:20.000 --> 39:23.000
And yes, this was a real tape that I had, these little science films,

39:23.000 --> 39:28.000
where they would show pictures of traveling to Neptune,

39:28.000 --> 39:32.000
or obviously there's only so much they have they put on the film.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
But you guys know kind of where I'm going with this.

39:34.000 --> 39:37.000
I think a lot of times they would show it to you through the telescope, whatever.

39:37.000 --> 39:42.000
But as a kid, I remember like, holy shit, you could see these planets on my TV.

39:42.000 --> 39:47.000
And that was technology when I was younger, 30 years ago when I was that age.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
And now the fact that, okay, now the technology is like,

39:49.000 --> 39:52.000
okay, now we put you on the fucking surface of Mars,

39:52.000 --> 39:55.000
because we can do that, but that's still really cool for the kids.

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
The price of this technology is going to get cheaper and cheaper.

39:57.000 --> 40:00.000
So we imagine these standalone headsets later on when,

40:00.000 --> 40:03.000
okay, hey, we're going to visit the surface of Mars

40:03.000 --> 40:06.000
because we actually have photographs of fucking Mars

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
that we can stitch together into some VR thing.

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
And I'm pretty sure that's probably already out there.

40:10.000 --> 40:11.000
You can already do that.

40:11.000 --> 40:15.000
But, you know, more mainstream where you can actually have kids experience that.

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
And that's kind of cool.

40:17.000 --> 40:20.000
It's like you're literally visiting the surface of another planet.

40:20.000 --> 40:25.000
I'm trying to parse some of this stuff in chat here over at live.vognetwork.com.

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
Let's see, SG100Matt says,

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
I could see the good in there being a lot of choices.

40:29.000 --> 40:33.000
It forces everyone with a VR device to try to outdo the other and innovate.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
Competition can lead to more or quicker innovation

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
as long as they see it's beneficial.

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
Kaijuto in chat says,

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
VR is not diluted at all.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
It's like one day there isn't enough for VR,

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
the next there is too much for it.

40:45.000 --> 40:46.000
Make up your minds, lol.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
VR is fine and growing.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
I mean, okay, yeah, VR is growing.

40:50.000 --> 40:56.000
But I just, you know, if I wanted to start with VR, where should I go?

40:56.000 --> 40:59.000
There's so many options right now.

40:59.000 --> 41:02.000
I would assume, for me, I would go to PlayStation VR

41:02.000 --> 41:05.000
simply because I'm a gamer and that's, you know.

41:05.000 --> 41:08.000
I think it's going to be pretty interesting.

41:08.000 --> 41:11.000
Especially now that you have Microsoft kind of,

41:11.000 --> 41:14.000
they're going to base an operating system around VR AR.

41:14.000 --> 41:17.000
I think once that stuff starts hitting,

41:17.000 --> 41:23.000
I mean, God, in a decade's time we could be all using VR stuff as a PC.

41:23.000 --> 41:27.000
You know, we're going to be going to work and using this virtual space.

41:27.000 --> 41:30.000
And that's not going to be a weird thing.

41:30.000 --> 41:33.000
Come on, confide in me and chat says,

41:33.000 --> 41:38.000
I wonder if someday we'll be able to use AR to unlock a cute guy's private pics.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
Like, woof, scruff, unlock his pics.

41:40.000 --> 41:44.000
You know, be careful what you ask for because here's the thing.

41:44.000 --> 41:47.000
I mean, look, everything is going to come back to the whole time to penis

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
and porn thing at the end of the day.

41:49.000 --> 41:53.000
But, you know, I could see definitely like one place where VR is going,

41:53.000 --> 41:56.000
especially with Facebook's involvement in this whole thing is,

41:56.000 --> 41:59.000
you know, like your Facebook newsfeed.

41:59.000 --> 42:03.000
You know, right now you can broadcast live video on Facebook, right?

42:03.000 --> 42:07.000
And, you know, I don't see a whole lot of exciting, exciting stuff in there.

42:07.000 --> 42:10.000
Like usually it's just a friend either playing a Blizzard game

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
because it's integrated or talking about their day.

42:12.000 --> 42:16.000
Or I have one friend that will do drunk cooking,

42:16.000 --> 42:17.000
which I think is a big thing on YouTube too.

42:17.000 --> 42:21.000
They'll get on their Facebook feed and drink and cook to do that.

42:21.000 --> 42:26.000
But I would think it's only a matter of time before in VR,

42:26.000 --> 42:31.000
you could be at somebody's wedding that you couldn't be there in real life.

42:31.000 --> 42:36.000
But you could still attend it in VR through Facebook streaming

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
and Oculus and all this tech.

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
Like I don't think the technology is obviously not totally there yet,

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
but like it's close.

42:42.000 --> 42:46.000
And as the cost of all this stuff,

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
I mean, could you do that today?

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
Yes, you probably could.

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
But could your grandma easily see it?

42:53.000 --> 42:54.000
Probably not.

42:54.000 --> 42:58.000
But as the cost of this technology comes down and down and down

42:58.000 --> 43:01.000
in the next few years, we're going to be there pretty quick.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
So it's just interesting.

43:03.000 --> 43:04.000
Anyway.

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
All right.

43:06.000 --> 43:09.000
And some folks in our chat are complaining.

43:09.000 --> 43:12.000
I guess our servers are having a little bit of a hiccup,

43:12.000 --> 43:15.000
but it's not on our end.

43:15.000 --> 43:18.000
It's on the server's end because we're still streaming

43:18.000 --> 43:19.000
a consistent amount of data.

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
And more importantly, we didn't pop out of chat.

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
That's usually a good sign.

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
If it's on our end, we'll get disconnected from chat.

43:25.000 --> 43:26.000
And that didn't happen.

43:26.000 --> 43:29.000
But we're going to just try to push forward with our show anyway.

43:29.000 --> 43:33.000
RageNator in chat says the servers are drunk cooking apparently.

43:33.000 --> 43:34.000
Apparently.

43:34.000 --> 43:35.000
Apparently that's happening.

43:35.000 --> 43:36.000
All right.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
Anyway, lots of good VR talk.

43:38.000 --> 43:39.000
I'm sure there's going to be plenty more.

43:39.000 --> 43:40.000
Plenty more.

43:40.000 --> 43:41.000
E3 is around the corner.

43:41.000 --> 43:42.000
Who knows?

43:42.000 --> 43:45.000
I'm excited to see some more PlayStation VR announcements.

43:45.000 --> 43:46.000
Yeah, I'm excited.

43:46.000 --> 43:50.000
And I would like to see if Microsoft might be taking the next step

43:50.000 --> 43:51.000
with HoloLens.

43:51.000 --> 43:54.000
I'm assuming no because Scorpio is going to be their focus this year.

43:54.000 --> 43:57.000
Just please don't announce a complete redesign of the PlayStation VR

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
headset because I'm going to feel a little bit pissed off

43:59.000 --> 44:00.000
if that's going to be the case.

44:00.000 --> 44:01.000
Yeah, well.

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
I don't have one yet, so they could do that.

44:03.000 --> 44:04.000
But anyway.

44:04.000 --> 44:05.000
No, I get it.

44:05.000 --> 44:06.000
I get it.

44:06.000 --> 44:07.000
All right.

44:07.000 --> 44:10.000
Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games

44:10.000 --> 44:11.000
that we have been playing this week.

44:11.000 --> 44:12.000
Dark Soccer, I'll start with you.

44:12.000 --> 44:13.000
How was your gaming week?

44:13.000 --> 44:17.000
It was very light, just given work's been so busy.

44:17.000 --> 44:23.000
But I played some World of Warcraft, some Pokemon Go, Miitomo.

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
Good lord.

44:25.000 --> 44:28.000
And I played a lot of Bust-A-Move.

44:28.000 --> 44:31.000
Like I played for like an hour and a half on like endless mode

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
and never lost.

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
And I was like, where did the fucking time go?

44:35.000 --> 44:39.000
And then I realized that it went down the drain along with the rest

44:39.000 --> 44:40.000
of my free time.

44:40.000 --> 44:43.000
So that's really it.

44:43.000 --> 44:44.000
Not a whole bunch.

44:44.000 --> 44:49.000
Although Shane's trying to get me into this room 999 game.

44:49.000 --> 44:50.000
Oh, yeah.

44:50.000 --> 44:51.000
He's been talking about that.

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
He said, I don't know a lot about it.

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
I keep trying to get him to come back to the show to talk about it.

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
He said he's going to lend it to me.

44:57.000 --> 45:00.000
It's like an escape room as a video game is what he kind of

45:00.000 --> 45:01.000
described it to me as.

45:01.000 --> 45:04.000
It looks like it was up my alley because of the light down in Roompa.

45:04.000 --> 45:07.000
That's kind of funny because I thought escape rooms were based

45:07.000 --> 45:08.000
on Flash games to begin with.

45:09.000 --> 45:10.000
Like the Crimson Room?

45:10.000 --> 45:11.000
Or the Red Room?

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
Yeah, like all those little Japanese Flash games where it's like

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
you're stuck in a room and you have to put the clues together.

45:15.000 --> 45:16.000
I thought that's what they did.

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
The real life escape room was based on.

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange

45:22.000 --> 45:26.000
Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase LAMP.

45:26.000 --> 45:29.000
I thought when I heard, this is a while back when we were like

45:29.000 --> 45:33.000
selling that game, I thought it was like Saw.

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
If I remember, maybe I'm thinking...

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
It's kind of, from what I understand, it's a mix.

45:37.000 --> 45:40.000
There is some Saw-like elements to it.

45:40.000 --> 45:43.000
But the first thing I told Shane was I hate those movies.

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
But he says it's not like in-your-face gore.

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
It's kind of like off-camera type of thing.

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
So I was like, alright, I guess I could probably handle that.

45:49.000 --> 45:52.000
I mean, if I can play Silent Hill, I can handle some of it.

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
So, anyway.

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
Alright, well then, if that's it for Dark Soccer's Gaming Week,

45:57.000 --> 46:00.000
let's talk about Loki's Gaming Week.

46:00.000 --> 46:03.000
So, I played a few mobile games.

46:03.000 --> 46:06.000
So, of course, more office space, idle profits.

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
Because it's still entertaining.

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
A little bit of Pokemon Go.

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
Although, I got to say, this event that they did

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
was like some rock-type adventure event thing.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
It's pretty lame.

46:16.000 --> 46:19.000
I guess we just have a lot of rock-type Pokemon around here already.

46:19.000 --> 46:22.000
So, it's just like, it's the same shit.

46:22.000 --> 46:25.000
I didn't notice anything. It's like, oh, more Rhyhorns.

46:25.000 --> 46:26.000
Hooray.

46:26.000 --> 46:29.000
That's how the water and grass events were for me in San Francisco.

46:29.000 --> 46:32.000
It's the same, it's just if you have what's already there,

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
you're not going to see a difference.

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
I just wish they would, yeah.

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
Well, they have like, oh, there's going to be an Aerodactyl.

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
Okay, cool. I don't have that.

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
Let's catch that.

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
Nope. Not seeing that anywhere.

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
Fucking liars.

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
So, yeah, it's been alright.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
I mean, I don't know.

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
It's not as exciting as some of the other events that they've had.

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
So, I'll just look forward to the next one, I guess.

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
And then, of course, I got the new laptops.

46:56.000 --> 47:00.000
So, I've been just slowly loading some stuff on there.

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
Probably going to do some modded Skyrim,

47:02.000 --> 47:06.000
because now I can mod the hell out of it and do all the fancy EMB stuff.

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
But, haven't bothered to do that just yet.

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
I did try a couple things.

47:10.000 --> 47:13.000
One of the last games I picked up was a game called,

47:13.000 --> 47:19.000
it's hardly a game, but it's an application called Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator.

47:19.000 --> 47:24.000
It's basically this Unity game where you put tons of units down

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
and you watch them battle against each other.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
So, you can do ridiculous shit like,

47:28.000 --> 47:33.000
okay, it's a thousand T-Rexes versus some Archers and stuff like that.

47:33.000 --> 47:34.000
And it's just fun to watch.

47:34.000 --> 47:35.000
So, I did that for about ten minutes.

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
I'm like, okay, I've seen that.

47:37.000 --> 47:38.000
Now, I'm going to go do something else.

47:38.000 --> 47:41.000
So, of course, it's been a while since I went back to Grand Theft Auto.

47:41.000 --> 47:46.000
And so, I picked up Grand Theft Auto 5 and I loaded on there.

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
And I started playing through the story again.

47:48.000 --> 47:52.000
So, it looks fantastic on my laptop.

47:52.000 --> 47:57.000
And, yeah, I mean, I'm probably going to pick up Overwatch.

47:57.000 --> 48:01.000
I was going to pick it up this weekend,

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
but I think we're going to get into a new story about it later.

48:03.000 --> 48:06.000
I'm going to wait a couple days, which is probably a good idea.

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
We can say the free weekend's coming up.

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
Yeah, the free weekend's coming up,

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
and then they're doing a game of the year edition.

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
So, I'll pick up the game of the year edition when it comes out.

48:14.000 --> 48:19.000
And then Forza Horizon 3, I'm probably going to pick that up.

48:19.000 --> 48:22.000
I was going to pick up an Xbox One controller to go with it,

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
but my fucking god, those are expensive.

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
I still use the 360 controller.

48:26.000 --> 48:31.000
It was like 80 bucks for the controller that doesn't fucking have a rechargeable battery.

48:31.000 --> 48:34.000
You've got to buy a rechargeable battery for another 25.

48:34.000 --> 48:39.000
I'm like, why? I can either buy Forza Horizon or this controller.

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
I'll just use the 360 controller.

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
I don't need the fucking trigger rumbles.

48:43.000 --> 48:46.000
So, I'm just going to hold off on that.

48:46.000 --> 48:49.000
But I'll eventually pick up Forza Horizon 3 because it looked pretty cool

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
and I think it should run pretty well on this.

48:51.000 --> 48:54.000
Yeah, so, I mean, that's it.

48:54.000 --> 48:55.000
Awesome.

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
All right, let's go to JD. How was your gaming week?

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
And, JD, you've been really quiet tonight and I can't fix it on the board,

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
so just make sure that microphone is real close to your mouth.

49:01.000 --> 49:02.000
Okay, is this better?

49:02.000 --> 49:03.000
Yeah, much.

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
All right. It's been good.

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
My sister came to visit me the past two weeks.

49:07.000 --> 49:11.000
So, we've been playing a lot of local multiplayer on Switch.

49:11.000 --> 49:17.000
I have Mario Kart, I have Puyo Puyo Tetris, and we played Snipperclips.

49:17.000 --> 49:21.000
So, that was the first half of this week.

49:21.000 --> 49:25.000
And I've also been playing, you know, Street Pass games on my DS,

49:25.000 --> 49:30.000
and Pokemon Shuffle, and Pokemon Go, and a couple other Pokemon games

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
because I'm crazy like that.

49:32.000 --> 49:37.000
The arcade we went to was another definite highlight of my gaming week.

49:37.000 --> 49:42.000
I played a Groove Coaster, and I saw somebody posted, like,

49:42.000 --> 49:45.000
the last time you were there, there was a Crypt of the Necrodancer song,

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
and so I had to play that one.

49:47.000 --> 49:53.000
I thought it was a really neat take on the roguelike moving every beat mechanic,

49:53.000 --> 49:54.000
because they had this-

49:54.000 --> 49:58.000
I believe that song is also in Pers- not Persona,

49:58.000 --> 50:02.000
the game that Jamie and Shane are obsessed with.

50:02.000 --> 50:03.000
Why can't- the name told us-

50:03.000 --> 50:04.000
Danganronpa?

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
Danganronpa. Why do I- why am I thinking Persona?

50:06.000 --> 50:09.000
They kind of rhyme. Danganronpa, Persona, kind of.

50:09.000 --> 50:12.000
Anyway, that song in Crypt of the Necrodancer is also in Danganronpa

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
because Shane made me film it and tweeted it at Jamie.

50:14.000 --> 50:17.000
There were a couple of different songs on the machine that were labeled

50:17.000 --> 50:20.000
Crypt of the Necrodancer, and I'm not sure if it's because-

50:20.000 --> 50:23.000
I know one of them was definitely from the game itself,

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
and I'm wondering if some of the other was just, like,

50:25.000 --> 50:28.000
the music person did, like, a remix of a different game song.

50:28.000 --> 50:33.000
I don't know, but the specific one I played from the game, like,

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
there were a lot of notes where it was,

50:35.000 --> 50:38.000
move the controller in an arrow direction on the beat,

50:38.000 --> 50:42.000
which really mimicked a lot of the way you're playing Crypt of the Necrodancer,

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
where you're moving on the beat.

50:44.000 --> 50:48.000
And I thought that was a really neat crossover kind of a thing.

50:48.000 --> 50:53.000
I played Neon FM for the first time, which I'd, like, heard a bit about,

50:53.000 --> 50:56.000
but it was neat. It reminded me a lot of Poppin',

50:56.000 --> 51:00.000
like, five-key Poppin' with, you know, flat pads.

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
But it was a nice change.

51:02.000 --> 51:06.000
And yeah, there was a State Mania cabinet,

51:06.000 --> 51:09.000
so I got to play, you know, erotic songs that haven't been in arcades in years.

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
So, you know, I filled the bowling alley with

51:11.000 --> 51:14.000
Oh Nick, Please Not So Quick and stuff like that.

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
During the kid's birthday party. It's good.

51:16.000 --> 51:19.000
Yeah, well, you know, they weren't running around, exactly, mostly.

51:19.000 --> 51:24.000
There was also a DDR 2014, which I don't think was a mix that got released in the US.

51:24.000 --> 51:27.000
And they had Caramel Dancin', so I had to play that.

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
Curse you for doing so.

51:29.000 --> 51:32.000
Yeah, that was about it.

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
Nice. Let's see, my gaming week.

51:34.000 --> 51:38.000
So, on a bit of a personal note, I hit affiliate status on my Twitch channel.

51:38.000 --> 51:41.000
So, thank you guys very much for supporting, because obviously

51:41.000 --> 51:42.000
What does that mean?

51:42.000 --> 51:45.000
What does that mean? That means that now I can put that on my resume.

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
Now you get a dollar.

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
Yeah, literally, now I can get a dollar.

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
Now, when I say give me a dollar, you can actually give me a dollar.

51:51.000 --> 51:55.000
It makes me eligible for bits, which are the currency on Twitch that

51:55.000 --> 51:58.000
So how do you do that? Like, give the podcast for enough time?

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
Oh, to hit the affiliate status?

52:00.000 --> 52:01.000
Yeah.

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
There is, I think, four different criteria.

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
You have to have at least 50 followers.

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
So, you know, that's you guys that helped me make that, thank you.

52:07.000 --> 52:12.000
You have to have at least three concurrent viewers over all your streams

52:12.000 --> 52:15.000
For the past month, for the past 30 days.

52:15.000 --> 52:18.000
Which, again, because a lot of my streaming has been after OLR

52:18.000 --> 52:21.000
And I've been able to pick up a good, you know, 20 or so people watching

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
Right after OLR, that's been very helpful.

52:23.000 --> 52:26.000
So, again, thank you guys. You made that possible.

52:26.000 --> 52:31.000
But I know that is the criteria that Flaco Jones, I think he thinks he's

52:31.000 --> 52:34.000
Hung up on that right now, because I think in the beginning of the month

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
He didn't have a lot of people watching his stream.

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
He's been picking up, as he's been doing it more regularly

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
And he's thought up some other ideas, I think he's getting more viewers

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
So hopefully he's going to hit it soon, too.

52:42.000 --> 52:45.000
But that is the trickiest one for people to hit, I think, is three concurrent.

52:45.000 --> 52:49.000
It doesn't sound like a lot, but it can be for a new person starting out

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
Especially when so many people are streaming, right?

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
So what is it, 50 followers, three concurrent?

52:53.000 --> 52:58.000
Seven days in the past 30 days that you've done a stream

52:58.000 --> 53:02.000
And then 500 minutes in the past 30 days of streaming.

53:02.000 --> 53:05.000
Which is about, if you do like an hour and 15 minutes

53:05.000 --> 53:08.000
Two or three times a week, you'll hit those criteria.

53:08.000 --> 53:11.000
So then it's kind of about just getting the followers and the viewers from there

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
Which, you know, just takes a little time.

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
But yeah, it makes me eligible for the bits, which

53:15.000 --> 53:19.000
You can either buy them through Twitch, which a lot of people are doing

53:19.000 --> 53:24.000
Or you can watch the ads, you can watch an ad and you get like five bits

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
Or ten bits every time you watch an ad

53:26.000 --> 53:29.000
And what you can do is you can cheer a viewer

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
So if somebody decides to cheer my channel

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
Using the bits that they've got, watching ads

53:33.000 --> 53:38.000
Then I get one cent for every bit that is cheered at me

53:38.000 --> 53:42.000
So I've made, I think, about five dollars so far streaming on Twitch

53:42.000 --> 53:46.000
But you know what? Hey, I've been playing video games, having a good time

53:46.000 --> 53:50.000
And honestly, I'm not doing it for the money. Let me just be straight

53:50.000 --> 53:55.000
I've done this show for 15 years and haven't made a dime off this show

53:55.000 --> 54:00.000
Any money that has been made during OLR, like we've gotten some very generous donations over the years

54:00.000 --> 54:03.000
But that all has gone right back into the show

54:03.000 --> 54:08.000
Buying a mixing board, paying for the VOG stream, paying for mics

54:08.000 --> 54:11.000
Whatever it is, all that money has gone back into the show

54:11.000 --> 54:14.000
So, where was I going with that?

54:14.000 --> 54:17.000
Oh yeah, I don't expect to make money off of streaming

54:17.000 --> 54:21.000
But the nice thing about it is that I'm hoping what the affiliate status does

54:21.000 --> 54:24.000
Is that maybe it's going to help with a little bit more additional visibility

54:24.000 --> 54:30.000
Because what I'm trying to do is get more people exposed to OLR and VOG through streaming

54:30.000 --> 54:33.000
It's just like getting yourself out there, is what it is

54:33.000 --> 54:36.000
But I've been having fun playing games with people

54:36.000 --> 54:40.000
So now you can kind of see some of the games I've been playing throughout the week

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
Because I played Forza Horizon 3 one night

54:42.000 --> 54:46.000
I played Diablo 3 again, but I did it on PC

54:46.000 --> 54:49.000
So I was doing Seasons this time around

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
And I made my seasonal character

54:51.000 --> 54:54.000
I got all the way to I think Chapter 6

54:54.000 --> 54:57.000
I think I'm in Chapter 6 now on my seasonal character on Diablo 3

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
So yes, I'm still playing a lot of that

54:59.000 --> 55:02.000
Still playing Final Fantasy XIV, eagerly anticipating Stormblood

55:02.000 --> 55:05.000
Which is less than a month out now until Early Access

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
So that's really exciting

55:07.000 --> 55:11.000
And yeah, that's pretty much everything that I've live streamed

55:11.000 --> 55:14.000
There hasn't been a lot that I didn't live stream that I played

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
Except we played some Mario Kart 8 the other night

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
Which I have to vent about a little bit

55:18.000 --> 55:19.000
Because you know where I'm going with this

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
So JD brought a Switch over

55:21.000 --> 55:22.000
And I was like, cool!

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
We'll be able to do like, oh we can play Mario Kart

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
Like I'll play on the TV

55:26.000 --> 55:27.000
And JD can play on the Switch

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
And it's like we're battling each other, right?

55:29.000 --> 55:32.000
Okay, so in theory, this should, you know, it's a Nintendo thing

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
It should just work, right?

55:34.000 --> 55:35.000
Right

55:36.000 --> 55:40.000
Oh my god, like no, we're having connection issues out the wazoo

55:40.000 --> 55:44.000
Like we could not, like JD, and to be fair

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
Alan and I were both playing on the TV

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
And then you were playing on your Switch device

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
And we kept getting disconnected

55:50.000 --> 55:53.000
Like we couldn't even set, we got to do one race

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
And then it disconnected us right after

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
Or it would disconnect us during the prep

55:57.000 --> 55:58.000
Or we would always get disconnected

55:58.000 --> 55:59.000
We were like, what the hell is going on?

55:59.000 --> 56:00.000
So finally it was just like, fuck it

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
We can do three people on the TV

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
We just ended up doing it that way

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
But then we tried again yesterday

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
But this time we said, okay let's put

56:08.000 --> 56:09.000
Because your Switch was already in there

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
Because you were playing Zelda on the TV

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
While I was out doing something else

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
And so I was like, okay I'll play on my Switch

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
And we got through a whole circuit

56:17.000 --> 56:18.000
And we got through four races

56:18.000 --> 56:19.000
And then got disconnected

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
When we switched to battle, wasn't it?

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, and then we tried to switch to battle

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
But like, it shouldn't fucking do this

56:25.000 --> 56:28.000
Yeah, it's stupid because it doesn't even have anything to do with the internet

56:28.000 --> 56:29.000
Yeah

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
Like this is just two Switches in proximity

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
Like street passing or whatever, you know

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
Like it's near field communication

56:35.000 --> 56:36.000
And it shouldn't be dropping like that

56:36.000 --> 56:39.000
And this really concerns me because this was the feature

56:39.000 --> 56:42.000
That like I'm most looking forward to on Switch

56:42.000 --> 56:43.000
Right

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
Is being able to do this all in one room like this

56:45.000 --> 56:46.000
I am totally shocked

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
Well, not shocked actually

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
You know what we should do is we should try it with Puyo Puyo Tetris

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
And see if it does the same thing

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
See if it's the game or the system

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
Or something else, you know, do some elimination testing

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
Have you all tried this out in the chat

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
Since we do have a live chat room over at live.fognetwork.com

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
Have you guys had some issues trying to do

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
Again, not internet, but in the same room

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
Trying to do some gaming on Switch

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
I've had absolutely no problem with Puyo Puyo Tetris

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
But I have it on PS4

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
Well, what about Mario Kart 8?

57:12.000 --> 57:13.000
That's not going to help our situation

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
So anyway, let's see

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
ActDef says I played with friends last night

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
Two on TV and two on a Switch

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
And we didn't have any problems

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
So yeah, it's

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
I don't know what's going on there

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
I feel like it might be something unique to my setup

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
Is it because there's

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
Is it because the Switch is right near all the other electronics

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
Like maybe

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
Maybe my

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
I feel like it shouldn't make a difference

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
Maybe I need to move the dock away from the other electronics

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
You're right, it shouldn't make a difference

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
It shouldn't make a difference

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
I can't think of what else it is

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
Well, for NFR

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
The only things that could cause

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
Any big problem with that would be

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
If it's going through a concrete wall

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
Or the microwave's going

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
You can't tell me

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
The Switch can't do what a DS can do

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
Or the Bluetooth

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
See, I don't want to say this

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
Because I'm going to get judged by some people

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
But y'all can kiss my butt

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
It is sitting on top of my subwoofer

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
Would that be

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
Interference?

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
That might be it

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
That's going to be the first thing we try

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
Maybe we're going to try moving it around

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
Get it off the subwoofer

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
No, it doesn't sit on the subwoofer

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
But it sits right next to it

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
If there's interference

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
I set the games on top of the subwoofer

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
Also, maybe line of sight might be a concern

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
You were sitting on the couch

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
Maybe the recliner would be better

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
I'm just saying if you're holding the console

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
Against it or something

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
Maybe it's the subwoofer

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
Speculation

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
Troubleshooting is so much fun

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
To be fair

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
You guys are probably all rolling your eyes

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
Rob, you're such an idiot

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
It would be nice if Nintendo gave a little more description

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
What is the communication error?

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
Did a particular

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
Switch drop?

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
What's the fucking error?

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
Give me something to help diagnose it a little better

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
There's no error, it's a feature

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
Shut up, alright

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
I had to get that off my chest because that really concerned me

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
But we'll just hope

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
It was my

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
Unique setup here in this household

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
And not something that's going to be

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
Long ongoing

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
Anyway, let's move on

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
And talk about some quick plugs

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
Announcements, of course you can always follow us on Twitter

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
We're also on Facebook

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
June is going to be a

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
Crazy month here at O-L-R

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
E3 is going to be

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
Taking over our episode on

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
June 11th, no literally

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
It is taking over our episode because

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
Bethesda has their press conference

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
Right in the middle of the show, but as always

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
We're still going to do our thing here at VOG Network

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
We'll start the show

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
Pause it during the Bethesda conference

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
Then pick up right there with some live reaction

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
And all that good stuff

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
And your calls and all that stuff as well

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
The week after that, June 18th

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
We celebrate

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
15 years

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Of OrangeLoungeRadio

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
15 freaking years

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Of OrangeLoungeRadio

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
You know I need to look up

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
When OrangeLoungeRadio started

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
On live 365 because we launched the station

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
A month before we launched

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
The show because we were just playing music

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Like building hype to the first

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
Like live event show that we were doing

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
And I want to say the station started

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
I feel like May 22nd

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Was the day, I could be wrong

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
But I want to say it was late May

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
So we're, technically

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
OLR is like 15

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Tomorrow

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Just not the show

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
You can wear the dress

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
I don't have the dress so I'll just come and drag

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Alright yeah it's fine, come and drag

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
So June 18th is going to be the big

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
15th year because the first official

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Episode of OrangeLoungeRadio

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Is June 23rd, 2002

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
So we're going to celebrate 15 years

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
On June 18th and then on

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
June 25th we will be rewarding

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Our 15 years of OrangeLoungeRadio

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
By taking a day off

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
I will be in Chicago

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
And my co-host will be

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Enjoying a day off

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
I will probably be at San Francisco Pride

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
That's right you're doing San Francisco Pride

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Kind of busy

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
We're spreading pride throughout the world

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Because I'll be at Chicago Pride

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Alright cool

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
So no show that day

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Episode 700 is creeping up on us

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
And I am, that is in the back

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Of my head

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Unfortunately due to some personal life stuff

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Going on I wasn't able, I was supposed

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
To go check out that space

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
That our folks here, Bree and Gabe

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Were talking about, I was supposed to do that yesterday

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
And I wasn't able to get around to it

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
I'm hoping at some point I'm going to go over there and check it out

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
And we are

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Exploring options for a place here

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Locally we can do Episode 700

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Like as a more

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Event type show so

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Please look forward to it

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Or something around Episode 700

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
It may not be the actual show itself

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Is it going to be 700 club themed?

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Fuck no

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Only if we get to

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Beat an effigy of what's a fuck

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Well here's the thing

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Because of the missed weeks, I have to count out the weeks again

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
But because I think I got sick

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
Episode 700 might be freaking the week that

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
Dragon Con is supposed to be

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
So I have to figure all that timing out

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
And all that good stuff

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
So more to come on that

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
But in the meantime we've still got some gaming news to talk about

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Let's get into the gaming news for the week

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Loki

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
So this year we've got a brand new publisher

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
That's going to be doing an E3 presentation

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
And I'm pretty excited

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
To see this because

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
You've got to love them on Twitter

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
But Devolver Digital

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Is going to be doing their event

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Called Indie Picnic

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
In the parking lot across from the LA Convention Center

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
South Hall

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
And they said next door to Hooters

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
Jesus

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
I didn't realize there was a Hooters down there

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
That must be new

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
Basically they're saying that

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
They're going to have their own E3 press conference

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
That the

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Picnic I guess is going to be open

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Are they just going to stand on the corner and scream it?

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
I don't know

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
They're saying that it's going to be open to

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
All E3 badge holders

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
And the event will be continuing through

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
E3 11 through 7 o'clock

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Attendees can check out Devolver's

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Lineup of games and also

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
They'll be where the Indie Megabooth

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
XSplit and Gambitius

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Take place

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
And yeah so that's pretty

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
Cool that they're going to have their own

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Indie

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
They haven't announced a time yet for the

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Press conference but stay tuned for that

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
I'm sure they're going to have to announce it pretty soon

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
Alright well

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Any games you're hoping to see

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Out of them?

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
They have such kind of wild

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
Different stuff over there

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Yeah I just want something wild and cool

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Honestly I don't remember

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
I don't think they publish super hot

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
I would love to see super hot VR make it to

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
The Playstation VR that's what I would like to see

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
Because the VR one looks pretty awesome

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
For the Vive

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
And the Oculus so I'm kind of curious

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
To see what that would be like on the Playstation

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
Or I just wouldn't really want to play it

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
$800 fucking headset and even the

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Oculus headset it's like $600

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
That shit needs to come down in price

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
$300

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
That would be perfect

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Let's see I'm going to our chat over at

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Live.vognetwork.com Bobby Blackwolf says

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Devolver Digital has some former gathering

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Of developers people and they had

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
The God lot before there were

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Condos across the street from the LA Convention Center

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
It was the same kind of thing except with more

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Strippers and I'm not kidding they were stripper poles

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
That's awesome

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
I remember the days when it was

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Was it the Ouya event that was there?

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
What was across the street from the LA Convention Center?

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Was that Ouya? The one year?

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
They had Ouya

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
No because I gave a shit about

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
Ouya because it was one thing I could get into without a badge

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
I think that was the year I went

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
And I picked up Bobby Blackwolf at E3

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
And then we went to Disneyland

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Because I didn't actually go to E3 that year

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
But we just went in the lobby in street past

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
I was there for that wasn't I?

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
That was electronica

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
We've done it more than once

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
So there it is

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Well you're not going to do the Ouya event anymore

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
No we're not

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Alright moving on let's talk about

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
A rumor about what could be coming to

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Smartphones you know Nintendo has been doing

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Their smartphone thing and

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
They what me Tomo

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
JD still plays me Tomo

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Yeah I lug in everything

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
I was just checking in a moment ago

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
My son plays the shit

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Out of Super Mario Run

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Which I think Super Mario Run

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
Was more of a mixed bag of success

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
I think their expectations were just really high for that

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
Wasn't there also a Fire Emblem game?

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
There was I have not

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Yeah I have not checked that out myself

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
But that's a thing

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Well the Wall Street Journal is reporting that Nintendo

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
Is going to be bringing the Legend of Zelda

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
Franchise to mobile later this year

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
This will be after

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
Animal Crossing which we already knew

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
Was slated for mobile

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Clearly they're going to bring the best Zelda

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
Zelda 2 Adventures of Link

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
I like Zelda 2

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
But A playing that on a phone

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Would be a disaster

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
No that's not the worst of the franchise

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
It would be Zelda Wand of Gamelon

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
There you go that's a better joke

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Stick to that joke next time

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Anyway we don't know the game

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
What it is the pricing structure

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
This is all coming from the Wall Street Journal

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
Saying the news is from people

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Familiar with the matter

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
They've got leaks everywhere

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
That the Wall Street Journal finds

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Maybe this is something that could come out at E3

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
A little more information about

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Especially with the popularity of Breath of the Wild

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
This is a good thing to ride the coattails of

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
We will see

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
There will be a pretty huge franchise for Nintendo

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
Although granted they put Mario on the phone

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
You can't go much bigger than that really

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
But Zelda is pretty close

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
Especially with how well Breath of the Wild has been doing

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Non-stop Link

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Now well here's the thing

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
I would expect

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
It's not going to be a 2D

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
It's not going to be the original Zelda

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
It's not going to be Zelda Link to the Past

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Because you can't control that shit on the phone

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
It's going to be horrible controls

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
And I don't think Nintendo is going to sell it

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
I disagree with that you know why?

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
If you played the DS versions

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
The Wind Waker looking ones

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
Those all use touchpad controls

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
I was getting to that because those are different games

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
The Phantom Hourglass

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Completely different game

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
And that's the type of game that I would expect

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
A Rails shooter

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
But with Zelda

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
No it wasn't a Rails shooter

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
Did you play those games?

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
I mean seriously

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
It's kind of a joke but yes

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
Okay you didn't

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Obviously not because

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
They controlled really well for touch

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
Which is surprising

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
They didn't really utilize the buttons at all

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
It was basically you hold the screen

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Where you want Zelda

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
There you go making a new mistake

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Have you ever watched the show?

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Take off that mask Jamie

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
I'd like to keep it on

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
You control Link by

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Basically holding the part of the screen

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
And you can attack by tapping

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
And it worked really well

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Which is kind of surprising

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
From what I remember they didn't really utilize

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Buttons too much

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
They could put a couple on screen buttons

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
If you really needed something for that

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
The only thing they could do for the most part

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Completely touch control and it would be fine

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
Or they could just do a completely new idea

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
And that would be fine too

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
Honestly they you know

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Or they could just put fucking Pokemon Snap on there

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Because really that would be fucking amazing

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
With like the AR shit

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
They could do something in the

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Breath of the Wild world

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
With all of the crazy stuff that you do

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
And they're like you know using the different items

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
It would be like cooking Mama but just cooking Link

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
What about like a dungeon solver type of thing

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
Or the shrines like a shrine solver type of thing

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
That lends itself well to mobile phones

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
I don't know there's different ideas

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
They could do it doesn't necessarily have to be a copy

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
Of something that already exists

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
But this is all really

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Fan wank right now we just don't know

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
What is really going to happen with Zelda so

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
We'll just have to keep waiting till E3

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
To see if they talk about it then or if they

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
They wait on it

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
It might be actually I would think that this

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
Type of thing may not be in the E3

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
Spotlight or whatever they're calling it

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
It might be something that shows up at Treehouse

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Cause remember they show

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Pokemon Go at Treehouse

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
And that was the first time they ever showed

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
Gameplay outside of beta on that

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
And we have this stupid

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
Watch thing that we still

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Don't sell regularly even though it's been out

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
For almost a year now

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
I still want to cheat with it

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
I wanted to take it apart and solder the fucking

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
Lights to the button

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
So that every time it would light up it would click the button

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
Cause that's what I do

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
I find ways to exploit shit

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
And it would have been satisfying

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
To be able to lord that over them

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Moving on to another story

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
Dark Sakura if you wouldn't mind

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
Well I have been

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Looking at this game with some kind

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Of mixed feelings but it's about

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
Sonic Forces

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
Well you get to customize a character

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
In Sonic Forces

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
You can have different

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
Species of animals

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
With their own different abilities

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
And the things that they carry with them

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
And their own looks

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
Different masks so you basically get to

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
Play dress up in Sonic

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
Which is gonna open the door for

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
A lot of

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
Cosplay

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
There are a lot of furry characters out of this

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
You could

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
I said it nicely by saying

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
If you want to act out your first sona

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
In a Sonic universe you go

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Right ahead, have fun

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
There's a lot of people who already do that shit

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
So now they just get to say

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
Look I'm canon

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
I'm in the game

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
I'm canon

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
What's the solution

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
To Sonic's shitty friends?

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
Let's make an infinite amount of Sonic's shitty friends

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Make it now it's you

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
Now you're the bad friend

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
I don't know if I hate the shitty friends

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Because I'm the shitty friend

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
I'm so torn

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Everybody's gonna make their own shitty friend

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
And then they're gonna post their shitty pictures

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
To social media

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
Through the Switches

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
Twitch and Facebook

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
Look I'm in a Sonic game

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
Sonic's butt

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
Can you put your me's in there?

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
Can we have Hitler Sonic's friend?

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
No no no

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
That's terra bad

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
Yeah they need to have limitations

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
On what you can do

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
Because otherwise

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
There's people that have done me's

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
That are just cocking balls

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
There's people that have done me's

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
That are Christmas and New Years

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
It's all right there

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
It's just gonna be a thing now isn't it

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
Yes

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
I can't wait for December

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
Moving on

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
You don't want to see Hanukkah

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
All right

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
That lasts for weeks

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
Moving on

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
Loki

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
All right

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
Ubisoft has made some announcements

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Prior to E3

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
Some things we're gonna be seeing more of

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
During their press conference

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
Far Cry 5

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
And The Crew 2

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
Are gonna be

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Coming soon

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
And apparently maybe a new Assassin's Creed

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Cause I think that they took the year off

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
So now we'll see something like that

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
Remember I think we had the rumor that it was

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Opel World or something

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
So I guess we'll see what's gonna happen

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
But apparently yeah those three

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Are due to be released

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
This fiscal year

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
That's pretty cool that The Crew

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
Is getting a sequel after all

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
Cause I didn't think the first game did that well

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
Cause it was like bargain basement

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Pretty cheap to play

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Pretty fast

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
So I didn't think that lent well

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
I'm not dogging the game

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
To be fair

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
I think a lot of people I knew that did

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
Spend time with the game enjoyed it

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
So I'm not saying it was a bad game

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
Or unworthy of a sequel

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
I was surprised with how fast they slashed the price

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
That it's doing well enough to

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
Necessitate a sequel

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Hopefully

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Maybe they'll do

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
What they need to do to make it

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
So that more people want to drop 50-60 bucks on it right away

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
Dungeon Buster in Chat says

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
I hope they fix the rubber banding

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
And magnetic tires in The Crew

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
The game was kind of fun but wow

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
Issues

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
We just like never ever do rubber banding ever again

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
No one likes it

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
Who actually likes rubber banding?

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Nobody

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
Just like get rid of it

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
It's a cop out

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
For programming better driving AI

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
Make it something you can enable and disable

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
I don't know

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
Tigerclaw in Chat says every racing game has rubber banding

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
Like it or not

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
I don't like it

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
Yeah that's right I choose not to like it

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
So I started a podcast about it

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
Something I like though

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
That I like talking about on the podcast

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
Is Overwatch

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
And Overwatch believe it or not is turning a year old

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
It feels like that game is a lot older

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
But I think it seems so cemented

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
In gaming now

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Overwatch is coming up

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
With their game of the year edition

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
On Tuesday May 23

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
Is when that game of the year edition comes out

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
It's going to be coming with

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
10 bonus loot boxes

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
Some new hero skins

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
Blackwatch Reyes

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
And Strike Commander Morrison skins

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
You can also get some of the stuff that I think

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
Was in the original Overwatch

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
Origins edition like the Ferris skin

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
And some of that other stuff

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
That is going to be available on PlayStation 4

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
Xbox One and PC

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
But they're also going to be running an anniversary event

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
In the game

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
They haven't really said much more about what are the skins going to look like

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
There are some voices that showed up

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
But that's all we know

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
So we don't really know exactly

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
What all the extra stuff is going to be with that yet

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
But yeah very cool

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
That that game is

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
Still doing strongly

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
After a year

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
I'm kind of curious how they're going to keep the momentum

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
Going a few years from now

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
So far they're doing really well

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
And hell I'm still playing Diablo 3

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
And that game's

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
That was like 2008, 2009 at this point

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
Getting to be an older game

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
No I don't think it's that old

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
But still it's several years old at this point

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
We get a Diablo 4 pretty soon?

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
I wish

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
Maybe that's one of the under construction things

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
Or you think we'll see more

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
Character classes or something

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
For Overwatch?

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
Diablo

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
So they already announced that

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
So that

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
I still feel like it's going to be a couple years

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
Before we even see Diablo 4

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
But I don't know

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
Anyway

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
Let's see, ActDeftInChat says it was Game of the Year

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
In 2016

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
I don't think I mentioned it in that story

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
But I know it's part of this too

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
They are doing a free play weekend

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
Over Memorial Day weekend of all times too

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
So if you've never played Overwatch

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
You have a chance

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
This is the first time I think they've done the free play on PC

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
I know they've done it on console a couple times

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
But I think this is the first time they're doing it on PC

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
I've never played it

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
Yeah, no, I'm excited to have you check it out

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
See what you think

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
And I'm going to use controller like a complete noob

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
Because I don't have a place to put my computer

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
Where I can actually use a mouse

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
Nor do I have a mouse

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
Ooh, that's going to be rough, but good luck

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
Fuck that, I'm fucking awesome with controller

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
I think they did do free play on a PC a while back

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
Because that was when Ryan tried it

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
Maybe they did, I just don't remember it

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
It was definitely a while ago, like six months or something

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
Yeah, and I bought the game straight away

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
So I wouldn't have been paying attention to that

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
Let's see, SSQ100Matt saying

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
I remember a chatter in here saying that

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
Overwatch wasn't going to stick around

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
Because Blizzard can't do shooters

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
I wonder how that worked out

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
Well, I think the reason why Overwatch is kind of working is because

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
It's more than just a shooter

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
They do have characters in there that you can play

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
If you're not much of a shot

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
A character like Symmetra

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
Is really about where you place the turrets

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
And you don't even really have to be able to aim

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
To attack with Symmetra's gun

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
And that makes her a very attractive player

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
For some people

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
A healer like Mercy

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
You don't really have to be able to aim

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
You support other characters

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
Lucio is all about an aura

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
You know, it's a healing aura or a boost aura

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
So you don't necessarily have to be a good shot

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
And I think that's what has made it very, very, very

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
Attractive for a lot of people

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
But if you want to play, I mean

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
You have a Widowmaker who's a sniper

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
And Soldier 76 is just basically

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
Your Call of Duty character

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
So they have that stuff in there too

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
If that's what you're into

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
Alright, and

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
Yeah, SSG100Matt says

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
They find new ways to reinvent the game all the time

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
And Act F even suggests

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
For Loki, start with Soldier 76

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
Because that will be the most familiar

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
Probably from

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
Other shooting games

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
Alright, we will move on

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
Just a few more stories for you guys

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
Before we get to the classic game of the week

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
But first, Dark Sakura

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
This is something I've been

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
Considering contributing to

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
Ever since I found out

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
But Project Rap Rabbit

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
Is set for PC and PS4

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
And it has a

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
Kickstarter on it

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:43.000
With a 1.1 million dollar goal

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
I see them making it

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
No problem

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
But there's

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
Actually quite a few tiers on there

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
And several of them seem actually fairly affordable

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
One of the digital tiers

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
Is like maybe 30 bucks

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
For the game

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
And then

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
For like 70, there's one that has

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
Art books and stuff with it

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
I wouldn't mind having the art book for it

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
Although Dan says I have 50 million art books

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
For games I haven't played

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
So, but

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
Good, what's one more?

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
But at any rate

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
Basically, Rap Rabbit

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
Is actually taking inspiration

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
From what it's been

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
Commented on like epic rap battles

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
Of history

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
Where it's a

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
Rapping dialogue

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
Not like necessarily a battle

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
But a dialogue

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
And you've got like different verses

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
That you can throw in and not just doing whatever

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
They're already in the song

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
So, it definitely

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
It definitely looks cool and definitely is something

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
That I think is going to be getting

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
Money from you on Kickstarter

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
So I see some people

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
In chat talking about the Switch version

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
Of this, so here's the thing that happened

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
To that, so when it was originally on

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
Kickstarter, they posted all of their stretch goals

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
And like the last stretch

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
Goal on there was like a 5.5 million

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
Stretch goal and it would say Switch version

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
And the Nintendo fanboys

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
Screamed basically, which I

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
Kinda get, I mean that was a real

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
That was a lot of money to do a Switch version

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
So they've actually changed it and if you go back

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
To the Kickstarter today, Switch is now

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
The first stretch goal with 1.5

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
Million to get the Switch version

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
Which, you know, the game

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
Would definitely be attractive I think if it was on

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
The Switch, but

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
Well, and a little bit more about

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
The character is that the main character is called

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
Totomaru, who is basically

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
A farm boy rabbit and wants

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
To battle the forces of corruption

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
And his sidekick is named

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
Totomaru

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
I'm in a really difficult place

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
With this thing, I love these

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
Companies, I love these, like you know

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
Nana On'Sha, like I love these

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Companies, there's so much talent going into

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
This, that being said, I'm kinda

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
Done backing

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
Big studio Kickstarters

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
I realize these studios aren't big

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
But like

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
I'm not interested in buying

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
The game today that's not gonna come out for 4 years

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
And I know they say, oh we have

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
A path to get it out

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
Sure you do, buddy

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
They all do

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
Now, indies, and we've talked a lot about

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
Indie Kickstarters on this show, I feel a lot

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
Differently about, okay

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
But something of this caliber, especially for these

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
Guys that have done Playstation games before

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
And so forth, like, I'm just kind of

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
Shocked they can't get a publisher

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
To sign on to this

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
Like, I don't know, like

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
Where's your guys' heads at with this?

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
Like, Jamie, you said you were thinking about contributing to it

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
So you must be a little more forgiving

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
I'd rather that they raise the money

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
Themselves this way and go independently

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
For a publisher

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
Just because I've seen publishers fuck stuff up

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
You know what, I know what it is

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
I know what bothered me about it

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
It actually did have to do with the Nintendo thing

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
I thought it was weird

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
That the game was a Playstation 4

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
And a PC exclusive

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
Because my head went to

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
If it's a Playstation 4 exclusive

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
Sony should be paying for it

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
Not me

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
Now, I realize the Switch thing

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
Has changed a little bit

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
So I don't feel that as much anymore

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
But definitely when I first loaded the page

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
That was a huge misfire on their part

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
To be like, we'll do Nintendo Switch if we get 5 million dollars

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
Because I'm kind of like, if you're going to stay

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
Exclusive to one platform, then that platform

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
Should be fronting the money for it

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
And where the hell is Xbox One?

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
I kind of get, it's Japanese developed

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
So that question's

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
Kind of, eh, I get it

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
Probably is never

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
Yeah, I know, I know

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
It could also be based off what dev kits they have

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
Maybe they have a Playstation 4 dev kit

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
That could be, that could be

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
But I just, I still couldn't help but feel a little bit of like

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
Why am I paying for something that is going to be exclusive to one system

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
You know, and all this stuff

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
And I just

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
I don't know, I just

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
I feel like there's

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
Kickstarters I've contributed to

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
A long time ago

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
Bloodstained, Ritual of the Night

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
Which is a good example

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
Still not out

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
And I'm sure the game's going to be fine

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
And it's, you know, all that stuff

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
But it's like

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
I'm not interested in making this 4 year long investment

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
I'm sorry, I know some people strongly disagree with me

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
But I kind of just

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
Don't want to give my money away like that

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
I want something a little more immediate

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
I think

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
Bobby Blackwolf says

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
They will still have a publisher

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
1.1 million isn't enough to make the game

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
They still have other investors

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
And they say

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
He says

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
So

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
We have gone to Great Lakes and are planning an early work to minimize this risk

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
Between the shared experience of developers

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
Nanno and Shaw and Innes

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
And publisher Pcube's platform holder relationships

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
And merchandise production know-how

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
We're confident that all the pieces are in place to ship

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
Project Rap Rabbit along with all

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
Physical backer awards by August 2018

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
I

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
Even with all that

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
In front of me, I just, I don't

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
I don't believe it

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
And honestly

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
And it sucks, but you can

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
Kind of blame Mighty No. 9 for a lot of it

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
A lot of it

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
Mighty No. 9 done

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
Fucked up Kickstarter

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
Is it making you cry like an anime

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
Fan on prom night?

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
Yes

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
But again

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
When it comes to indies

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
I feel a lot differently

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
I get it

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
The ones that have been on here that are like

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
I need that artist or I need that

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
Or my game is fucking done

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
I need the money to do the distribution

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
And all that stuff

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
I'm kind of like, okay, well you've never done a game before

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
You've clearly been working on something

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
I feel a lot differently with the smaller people

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
Maybe that's just my whole

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
Yay indie type of nature anyway

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
But these other

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
These other things I have a harder time with

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
I don't know

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
Matt says

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
So I don't know

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
I couldn't help but feel a little burned

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
When I saw that it was a Kickstarter

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
Because I was thinking, oh it's going to be a big

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
E3 announcement

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
Yes, I realize Kickstarter

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
Are E3 announcements now

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
Ever since Shenmue 3

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
But

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
When they were talking this whole thing

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
What was the little tagline

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
Make music games great again and all this stuff

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
I was like, oh

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
Music games are already great

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
A, I was like please don't say that

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
B, like

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
With a line like that I would have thought your game

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
Was ready to go

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
Well then again

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
With a line like that maybe they're channeling

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
The one that said it originally

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
I wouldn't go that far

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
I get it, especially when you're an indie

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
Developer, you want to get the hype

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
And the community built up around your product

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
Early

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
But I just get annoyed, it's like

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
We have this really kick ass product that's not

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
Going to be out for two years

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
Why didn't you just

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
Show me this one that's more ready

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
Did they have video of what it looks like

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
Or is it just all concept shit right now

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
Screenshots

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
I don't think they actually

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
Do they have the game running on that kickstarter

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
I didn't look that far

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
When I looked at it I looked at it on my mobile

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
And I couldn't actually play videos

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
I think

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
I know they had screenshots, they had a lot of that stuff

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
But I don't know if they actually have the game

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
The actual product up there

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
I don't want to go on record saying they don't

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
That makes me wary

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
That early

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
Bobby says it's all concept, it's all whiteboard

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
Yeah I know

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
I'll play it when it comes out

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
I will be, you know what if the game is good

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
I will be the first one

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
To plop down the money for it the day it comes out

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
Good luck

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
Well if you think about it

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
What is really the advantage here

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
I mean what

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
It's just

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
You get some extra crap

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
I mean why should I risk

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
Myself, I mean as it is

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
Games that come out day one from AAA

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
Are risky investments as it is

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
Considering how broken some of them could be

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
At launch, why am I going to put

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
Risk in the game that may never even

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
Come out

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
It doesn't make any sense that you want my money

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
I mean I know that you need to fund it

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
And stuff but

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
Then again you don't need the funding

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
It's almost like we got to show that these

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
Publishers that people are interested in this game

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
That's a publishers job to figure that shit out

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
Why do they have to show interest in it

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
Alright

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
I'm glad somebody in chat got my joke

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
By the way, come on confide in me

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
Says my name is Sky and I've got something to say

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
That's right

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
I got your joke Rob

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
My name is Rob Roberts and I got something to say

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
That part

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
Amplitude done fucked up kickstarter

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
Cause there's another game

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
That I'm sorry, it was not as good

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
As we all hoped it was going to be

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
I'm sorry, straight up

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
Anyway

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
Let's move on

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
We got more stories for you, Loki

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
Alright

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
So Netflix

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
Has a lot of interesting shows

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
They just showed this week

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
Was a new

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
Dark Crystal series

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
Which looks pretty cool

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
Something else that's also in the pipeline

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
That's a little bit more game related

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
And seems

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
Proper for Netflix

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
They're going to be a new series

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
Based on The Witcher

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
The fantasy series of course

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
It is a book series as well as

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
The game series but they're saying that they're

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
Going to be having

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
I guess they have the executive producers

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
Sean Daniel and Jason Brown

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
Who are known for a show

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
Called The Expanse which I have never

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
Seen nor heard of

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
They're going to be following I guess

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
Sounds like the books

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
So it'll be interesting

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
I don't know if you guys have all seen the pictures on Twitter

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
But it's very clear that Julian Assange

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
Is going for the lead role in this

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
From his latest look

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
I don't know if you all have seen that

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
Such an awful bullet

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
So

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
The Witcher has some sexy

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
Stuff in there

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
There's going to be so many boobs in this show

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
It's not a Witcher game

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
Unless

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
Sign me up because

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
We need some Game of Thrones replacements

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
You can have that

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
As long as this time

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
When he stands up in the tub

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
I don't want no suds

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
So

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
Anyway

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
So yeah

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
William Murderface in chat says

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
Witcher hype

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
The direction

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
And the way the stories

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
Are told in The Witcher and all that

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
Is really really well done

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
If they bring some of that to a television show

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
Like seriously

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
It does have the ability to be something

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
On a Game of Thrones-esque kind of level

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
It really does

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
I think the source material for The Witcher

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
Which I understand is also based off a novel series

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
So there's all that

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
That we have to consider as well

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
But I think it could

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
Do really well in a way that video game

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
Media hasn't really been done before

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
Although

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
Is it really video game media if it was all a book to begin with

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
But remember we have Castlevania coming too

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
We'll keep our fingers crossed

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
Can we get boobs in that too?

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
Why not?

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
Well look at the original artwork

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
For Symphony of the Night

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
That's right

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
Granted the Dark Crystal is going to be a little awkward

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
But I mean it's necessary

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
In order to keep a certain level of quality

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
Across all Netflix shows

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
Alright one more story for you guys

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
Before we get to the classic game of the week

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
This one's a very modern game actually

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
I know a lot of people were really hyped for the

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
Destiny 2 event

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
That they had earlier this week

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
Where they showed some footage of the game

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
And shown off all the features coming to Destiny 2

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
Destiny 2 of course

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
Is going to be coming out for the PC

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
As well as the Playstation 4 and the Xbox One

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
No longer on Playstation 3 or Xbox 360

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
Although that doesn't surprise anybody

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
But it will be coming out on the consoles

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
What was it? Early September

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
I think was the date on the console right?

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
For Playstation 4 and Xbox One

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
There is no release date for PC yet

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
It will not be out

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
It sounds like the exact same day as September 8th

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
But here's what is really interesting

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
About the PC version of

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
Destiny 2

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
It's better than both the other versions

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
Well that's one

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
That's an opinion

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
But the other thing that's also interesting

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
Is that it's going to be released on Battle.net

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
Dun dun dun

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
Wait a minute

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
Blizzard's thing? Yes

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
But remember who owns Blizzard?

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
Activision

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
It's Activision Blizzard

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
What does Activision like? Greed

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
That's right

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
So no more 30% cut from the Steam store

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
By releasing that thing on Battle.net

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
And also you guys

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
And this is something I don't see

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
Any of the press really getting into

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
That I think is a huge element

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
Of this and why they're going

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
To the Battle.net launcher for all this

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
Sure the fact that they'll get to keep the cut

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
Of all the digital sales and all that

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
That's a great perk I'm sure

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
You guys

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
I think sometimes severely

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
Underestimate the Blizzard fandom

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
And

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
Don't underestimate the dark side

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
Don't underestimate the fucking Blizzard fandom

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
Don't

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
Because they're fucking crazy

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
And I say that as a Blizzard fan

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
I do I do I love Blizzard fans

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
I had a great time at Blizzcon

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
They're nuts and I mean that in a good way

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
Because why do I say it that way?

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
Why do you think something like Overwatch was

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
As successful as it was? Because

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
It got people that were playing

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
World of Warcraft

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
That were playing Diablo

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
To say hey here's a shooter

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
From this same company that I love

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
That's coming out and I want to try this

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
Or this team based game objective game

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
Or whatever you don't want to call it a shooter

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
And I want to try this out

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
One game I didn't talk about during my gaming week

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
That I actually have been playing quite a bit of

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
Is Heroes of the Storm

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
Why have I been playing Heroes of the Storm? By Blizzard

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
Because I want the fucking

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
Loot boxes for Overwatch

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
That you get by playing a bunch of

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
Matches with friends that's really what it boils

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
Down to so Blizzard

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
Very very very very very good

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
At doing the synergy thing and here

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
Come try our free game to get stuff

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
In the other game and all this stuff now not that I'm saying

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
That Destiny 2 is necessarily going to be a part of that

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
Although this

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
Certainly does open the door for Destiny

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
Characters to start showing up in Heroes of the Storm

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
Just saying

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
Or Overwatch

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
Well Overwatch is kind of

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
It's own universe you don't exactly see the lost Vikings

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
Running around in Overwatch

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
But Heroes of the Storm is kind of that mixing

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
Pot for all the Blizzard things

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
I'm just saying it opens the door to it I'm not saying it's going to happen

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
It just opens the door to it

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
But also

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
And this is another huge thing too is that

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
If you're playing World

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
Of Warcraft which a lot of people

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
Still are some people are

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
Selling their Warcraft gold

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
For real money through

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
This Blizzard token

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
So they have this Blizzard balance

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
That they're building up which most people

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
Are using to therefore buy

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
Overwatch loot boxes

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
But now they could save

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
That money and buy

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
Copies of Destiny 2 because that's going to be

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
Through Battle.net and you know what after they

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
Announce this that Destiny 2 is going to be

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
A part of Battle.net the prices

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
In gold of those WoW tokens went through the

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
Fucking roof because

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
You've got a ton of players now

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
Who are trying to save up money in their

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
Battle.net balance so they can basically

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
Buy Destiny 2

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
And Blizzard's still making money because

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
Somebody's buying those WoW tokens to

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
You know then that money is getting basically

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
Reallocated to purchasing

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
Destiny 2 so

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
Dungeon Buster

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
In chat says Destiny normally doesn't do any

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
Cross-promotion well it's

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
It's a crazy world out there

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
It's a different game and this is going to be very very

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
Very interesting for

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
PC also some other things

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
That should be mentioned about PC there's like the

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
Full on 4K on PC right

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
I didn't see a lot of the oh here it is on

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
PC Destiny will support 4K

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
That's 3820 by 2160

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
Un-capped frame rate

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
Custom key mapping text chat

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
And now that it's on Battle.net

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
If I'm playing Destiny 2

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
I can send

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
Dark Sakura a message through

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
Battle.net while she's playing World of Warcraft

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
And I can send her a message and I can say like

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
It's a lip sync Jamie

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
What part of that don't you understand

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
I'd like to keep it on please

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
And then there's an adjustable

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
FOV field of view detailed

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
PC setting screen 21 by 9

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
Monitor support and so on

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
So I mean all this just basically

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
Cemented for me oh yeah I'm

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
Skipping consoles and I'll be buying this on

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
PC like I

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
Kind of fell off the Destiny wagon because

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
Expansion expansion

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
Expansion but I'm willing to

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
Give it another go at Destiny 2 because

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
Destiny 2 at least is going to hit the reset button on all

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
That because you know none of that stuff carries

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
Over so I

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
I want to try it with mouse and keyboard on PC

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
I never played the first one I have it I just never played it

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
Yeah

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
Tigerclaw does point out and say

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
You'll need a good graphics card if you

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
Want to play in 4K yes yes you will

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
Need a good graphics card if you want to play in 4K I actually

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
Don't even have a 4K monitor so that's not gonna

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
Do me a lick of good but maybe I'll

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
Buy one for Christmas or

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
Something when

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
I don't know if it's worth it for

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
4K price

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
Stick with feeling what you got

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
Oh Bobby has no shame

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
At all saying that in the battle net system

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
I could send Jamie a message while she's playing

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
Wow I'm playing a game by

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
Bungie it's immediate predecessor is

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
A very classic game we should feature it

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
If only you could see

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
If only you could see

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
If only you could see

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
She's got one finger flying right now

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
For you Bobby

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
I'm saluting ya

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
Well let's see what she did pick for the classic game of the week this week

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
Every week Dark Soccer

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
Jumps into the gaming vault and finds a game

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
That she thinks hey

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
Put down your destiny

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
Sign out of battle net and play this

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
Cause this game's not on battle net and it's awesome

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
Alright

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
Dark Soccer what is the classic game of the week?

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
This is a game

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
I spent a shitload of time playing

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
In the arcade like a lot

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
I was kinda hooked on this game

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
We already did Dance Dance Revolution

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
Girl

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
APB

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
All Points Bulletin came out in 1987

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
By Atari

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
Atari games at the time

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
Where you play Officer Bob not the drag queen

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
Who is

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
A rookie police officer

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
And you have to go through

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
Different parts of the game

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
One of them is you go through

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
And you pull people over

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
For minor infractions

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
Well you ticket people for minor infractions

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
With the whole targeting system

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
Or you can pull over

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
Bad offenders and then eventually

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
You get down to where you apprehend criminals

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
When they put out an APB

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
The cabinet

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
Is a neat little cabinet

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
It looks kinda like a police car

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
Where it's got the siren

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
Lights above on top

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
Has a gas pedal, a steering wheel

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
And

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
Even a little seat

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
I think some of them had a seat

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
I remember playing one that didn't have it

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
It really is just a

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
Cartoony little game

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
But it's not easy

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
It is not an easy game

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
In fact even the developers

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
Said that over the development cycle

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
The gameplay got a lot more complicated

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
Than they originally had planned

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
It did have some other

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
Home releases

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
But let's get a little bit more into the game itself

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
Which I think is funny because you play as Car 54

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
Do you remember that show

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
Where Are You?

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
Exactly, that had, what's his face

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
The Playroom in Munster?

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
Uh, yes

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
I don't remember his name

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
I'll have to look it up again

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
He was one of the officers in that show

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
I mean, and I might

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
But it wasn't around when Car 54

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
Where Are You was on TV

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
But it did come on Nick at Night

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
Not that old bitches

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
Nick at Night used to run all those shows

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
When we were kids

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
Dennis the Menace from the 50's

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
Was like prime time on Nickelodeon

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
When they thought to make kids cute they had to scream

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
Hey Mr. Woman

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
Pull over buddy

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
So on top of this

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
This is also like every old stereotype

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
You get bonuses for

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
Every day where you arrest over the quota

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
And you can pick up donuts

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
That extend your time limit

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
For the day

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
I know donuts extend my time limit for the day

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
Donuts expand

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
My ability to even

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
They expand my waistline

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
Right?

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
Anyway you can also drive through filling stations

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
To refuel your patrol car

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
You can also

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
Upgrade your patrol car with brakes, guns

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
Armor, radar

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
I just keep thinking of this police car

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
Turning into something from Road Warrior

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
So you start off

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
By ticketing for common

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
Misdemeanors like littering

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
You pull up behind them

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
Tell them to bend over

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
Then you press the siren button

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
And then have them pull over

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
Sometimes you have to kind of

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
Over and over

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
Speeding

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
Comes into the game later

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
And you also

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
You also have to rescue different

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
Not rescue but arrest different

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
Fugitives

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
And then you have to violently shake them

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
To get a confession out of them

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
Before the chief enters the room and you have a

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
Confessometer

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
Unless it's a baby, don't shake the baby

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
God Rob

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
Now I'm all sad because I see that little baby's face

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
Aww

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
Anyway

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
So anyway

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
Your life gauge is kind of like a demerit meter

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
Um

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
So if you hit that

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
Then you get too many demerits

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
You are fired

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
So you can get fired in the game

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
And you earn those by colliding with cones

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
Or other vehicles when your siren is off

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
Shooting

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
Non offender vehicles

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
Running into donut huts and pedestrians

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
Running out of gas

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
And failing to get a confession

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
You can also

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
Get demerits when your car explodes

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
Or when you get hit by a train

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
Or high speed collisions

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
You know just all kinds of shit

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
So basically you have to be perfect

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
Um

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
Now um the seat that I was talking about

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
By the way it looks like it was detachable

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
And I remembered because the first version I played

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
Didn't have the seat on it

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
Um APB had a really long

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
Development process though like I mentioned earlier

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
And so as it went on

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
They added so many

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
Things to it that it really became

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
Complicated much more so than they had envisioned

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
Um it was

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
Pretty well received

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
For the time it had great high resolution graphics

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
The cabinet design was fairly new

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
Especially with having the flashing lights

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
On top it really made it attractive

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
Um and

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
It's difficulty was something

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
That kept people going in to try to

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
Master it you know

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
So um

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
There were home versions

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
Mostly developed by Tengen

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
Um there was

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
A version on GameCube

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
Actually I'm getting way ahead of the

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
Original releases

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
The original home versions

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
Were Amiga, Atari

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
ST, Commodore 64

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
ZX Spectrum in 1989

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
And then there was an Atari Lynx version

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
That came out in 1991 which I think

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
I have it I'll have to ask

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
Um for the later versions we had

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
A GameCube version, PS2 and Xbox

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
As part of Midway Arcade Treasures 2

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
And a PC as Midway

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
Arcade Treasures Deluxe Edition

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
And later on was part of the Midway

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
Arcade Origins in 2012

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
And there you go APB

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
That's the game

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
I have to admit I've only played the

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
Slightest bit of this I think it was in one of those

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
Like Midway collection things cause you know

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
They have all the old Atari games in those too like the

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
This is totally the same hardware

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
It's like 720 in some of those other games

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
Yeah the same era

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
I think this is in one of those so I've only played like the

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
Lightest bit of it but yeah I remember it being freaking hard

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
It is but it's super

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
Fun and I mean just the

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
Cabinet itself you know

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
When we got one

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
At my Aladdin's castle

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
That shows you how

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
Long ago it was when I first

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
Saw this one which I ended up eventually

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
Working at when I was in college so

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
Um but

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
There amongst the carpeted walls and

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
Everything was this shiny new game

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
And I really enjoyed it yes it had

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
Carpeted walls

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
The arcade nice had carpeted

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
Walls like you sound sound proving

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
Yeah

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
But true story carpeted walls at roller rink

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
I tore up my jeans and my knee

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
Rolling going at high

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
Speed into one of those walls so I had

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
Bad memories of carpeted walls

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
Alright there it is your classic

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
Game of the week APB

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
Alright a good

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
Good from a real much

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
Better era of Atari than some of

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
Our more recent memories although those

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
Flashback consoles are still pretty sweet for what it's worth

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
Anyway we're going to take a quick break but we have

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
There's ways to do that online they got this

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
Hulu thing the Amazon thing there's a lot of

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
Ways to do that so I just have to figure out which ones gonna work

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
For me and be watching that pretty

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
Soon I'm really excited about that as I'm sure

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
A lot of you guys are as well

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
Any other shows I should be watching

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
There's a lot of stuff

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
Yeah Kimmy Schmidt season 3 I still need to

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
Finish season 2 yes you do

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
My wife quit in season 2 as well

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
So I don't know

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
I need to finish Sense8 season 2

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
As well I started it and I liked

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
Well the Christmas episode was just basically

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
The Christmas episode was practically like the

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
VR thing we were talking about earlier

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
With Christmas and New Years and it really

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
Was the Christmas episode

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
But I watched the first episode

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
As well and it was good I liked it

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
I liked the way it ended so I need to watch more

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
Sense8 and even Shane is you know

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
Bugging me about it he's like I'm gonna ruin it for you if you don't

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
Finish it Crazy Ex-Girlfriend

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
Is worth a watch yes absolutely

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
I don't know that one so it's hilarious

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
It's well written and they got musical

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
Numbers in every show I mean it's

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
Very it's seriously very well written

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
The pilot episode has a song called the Sexy Getting

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
Ready song okay

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
Sounds good oh some folks in chat

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
Suggesting the MST3K reboot

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
Yeah

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
Honestly though I've been kind of spoiled

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
With Rift Tracks

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
It's kind of hard to go back

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
To that but

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
I'll have to give it another try

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
I watched the first episode of the Bill Nye

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
Science show

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
It was okay

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
I hear he's a bit preachy though

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
It's a little bit but I hope

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
They give him another season

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
I think it maybe just needs a little time to work out some of the kinks

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
So I hope they give him another season

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
But I liked it

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
I just didn't love it

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
A lot of Netflix shows I'm like oh my god

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
These are so good

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
It's not Netflix but it's Hulu

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
Everybody is telling me fucking watch it

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
Everybody is like fucking watch it

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
But just be ready to just want to

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
Cry for hours and hours

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
After you watch the first couple episodes

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
I guess there's like it's too real

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
Have you read the book?

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
No of course not

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
I don't read a lot of books

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
Books?

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
Well it came out like 30 years ago

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
So it's not new

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
I had actually started it when I was in

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
Middle school

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
And had to put it down

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
I haven't picked it up since

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
I planned on going back

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
I could read the Divine Comedy

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
In middle school

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
But yet that book hit me hard

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
So I had to put it down

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
I'm going to try to pick it back up and finish it

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
For a book that was written in the 80s

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
About current events and future predictions

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
It's held up extremely well

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
And terrifyingly so

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
What was the other thing I was going to mention?

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
Taking it with all these

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
On demand things

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
Let me go to chat I guess since I can't remember what it is

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
Brad from Pod Culture says

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
Gotham is okay

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
I watched half the first season of that

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
Okay is a good word to describe it

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
Not watching any of the DC shit until Wonder Woman comes out

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
I'm hearing the movie is getting good reviews

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
Out the gate

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
That's good

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
But I also hear that it's the only good thing

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
In their cinematic universe

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
Well

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
Unless we count the Nolan Batman movies

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
Because I thought those were great

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
I liked all of them

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
Not even just the Heath Ledger one

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
I liked them all

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
Didn't they reboot that universe away though?

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
Like they do every couple of years

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
That was the Christian Bale one

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
They were going to do a Batman with Batfleck

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
But I don't know if that's actually happening or not

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
Maybe?

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
And Brad from Pod Culture does have a good point

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
He says DC television is way better than the DC movies

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
That also requires a time commitment

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
That I would be taking away from

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
At least

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
I would be taking away from finishing Luke Cage and Iron Fist

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
And Daredevil before Defenders comes out

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
That's my problem TV

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
TV is such a huge time

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
Because I only give a shit about things that involve Jessica Jones

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
I've heard that it's safe to skip Iron Fist

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
And you're not missing anything

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
I

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
I've always liked Iron Fist and I read a good

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
Bit of Iron Fist and Power Man

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
In like the early 80's

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
What I want to see

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
Is a Misty Knight and Colin Wing series

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
I want to see Daughters of the Dragon

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
That would make me

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
So happy

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
So make it happen

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
I remember what I was going to say about Hulu

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
So I tried watching a show on Hulu

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
Well Hulu does have the Golden Girls

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
So we're thankful for Hulu for that

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
But I tried watching a show that

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
Shane or somebody thought I would like called Difficult People

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
And I thought it was so

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
Like I really tried to

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
I watched a good like 7 or 8 episodes of it

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
And I'm like this show is just not funny

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
Like people

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
It bothers me in shows

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
When people don't

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
Talk right

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
That was the problem in Difficult People

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
Was that they would talk about something

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
And then it was like oh here's this completely

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
Like side reference to a pop culture event

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
That maybe 2% of America

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
Is familiar with type of thing

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
That's not talking to me

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
Which I understand kind of why

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
That type of show exists in that format

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
It's like Family Guy in real life almost

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
It's kind of like

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
Oh so it's not bad funny the way that Seinfeld wasn't funny

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
Yeah no no

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
But then the other show

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
This is the one that gets me

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
And I swear I'll get back to video games

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
But TV is important too

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
Gilmore Girls is the other show I can't fucking watch

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
Because of that I tried watching Gilmore Girls

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
And people love Gilmore Girls

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
And I tried watching it and I'm like

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
People don't fucking talk like that

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
It is driving me up a fucking wall

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
The way they talk on the show

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
Anyway sorry Jamie I had to get that off my chest

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
Well you said Golden Girls

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
Did you see Golden Girls Clue?

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
Oh of course

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
Like 2 people posted it to your wall

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
Thank you for noticing yes 2 people posted it to my wall

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
Which is I never

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
Get mad and I never go and say

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
Somebody else beat you to it because I go

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
I'm touched that people

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
Think of me when they think of the Golden Girls

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
The only thing I have to say about Golden Girls Clue is

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
Could they not

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
Afford Estelle Getty's license

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
Or likeness like what the fuck is up with that box art

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
Like she doesn't

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
Look right at all

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
Who did Blanche do?

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
In which room?

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000
In which room and with what

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
Prophylactics

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
Come on confide in me and chat says

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
Binge the British version of Queer as Folk

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
Oh years ago

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
I saw it years ago

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
I love all the Doctor Who references in that show

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
Yes actually yeah

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
Like when he's at the pub and his co-workers like

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
Ex-dominate

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
I think I watched that around the time that the

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
Eccleston Doctor Who episodes are coming out

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
And somebody told me that it was the same director

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
And I was like after watching the British

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
Queer as Folk I was like oh that's fucking obvious

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
This guy is a total boner for Doctor Who

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
What's his fuck

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
Wrestle T Davies

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
And then there was the American Queer as Folk

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
Which was

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
How many

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
Good British shows get ruined when they're Americanized

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
It was a thing that we had

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
In the olden days ten years ago

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
For representation

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
And boy we've come a long way

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
Let's just leave it at that

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
I would say

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
For British shows coming to America

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000
The Office wasn't bad

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000
But I love the British Office

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
The Ma Na Ma Na scene

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
Like cracked me up so fucking hard

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
On the British Office like in just ways

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000
That TV here never makes me laugh that hard

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000
You know what else got fucked up? Being human

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
I watched the shit out of that

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000
Out of the British version

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000
And then we got the US one and I tried to

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
Watch the first episode and I was like no I can't

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
But did you know that the first episode

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
Of the Office in the US and the first episode of the

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
Office in the UK are the same like script

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
Like they might have done some

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000
Cuts because the commercials is different over there

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000
But like

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000
It's like the same script and I was like wow

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000
It's so different though

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
But I think a lot of that is just the strength of

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
Ricky Gervais

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
Versus you know

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000
Why can't I think Steve Carell

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
You know and just kind of like how they are

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
Yeah that guy

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000
Alright we got to move on y'all

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000
Let's get back into some gaming news

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000
We're going to do some rapid fire news

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000
Yes so this is kind of an interesting experiment

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000
But you know

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000
Goes to show you can watch almost anything on Twitch

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
So they have

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
This cool

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
Neural network

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
Named Charles and what Charles does

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000
Is it's learning how to

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
Drive I guess self driving

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000
Cars almost in Grand Theft Auto

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000
5 so basically

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
It's basing all the data off

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
Of what it sees

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
In the actual screenshots

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000
And everything to make its decision

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000
So you can actually watch it drive

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000
And

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000
Or drive poorly because that's

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
Kind of what happens sometimes but

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000
It's pretty interesting so that's one thing

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000
You can check out on

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
Twitch

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000
And then of course you know

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
The user you'd want to look for

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000
Is Sentdex

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000
Is the guy that's hosting that so check that out

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000
Because it's kind of interesting

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
I watched a few minutes of that and I was entertained

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000
And then

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
Finally we're going to get

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
A release date for South Park

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000
The Fractured But Whole

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000
That's going to be coming out in October

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000
So October 17th

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000
Is when it's going to be coming out

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000
And with that they have

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
Released a new trailer which I

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
Do need to watch and I do want to pick up the game

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000
Because the first one was awesome

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000
Do we think it will actually

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000
Come out? I think this time

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
I think it's ready

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000
I hope so too

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000
And I know a lot of people are looking forward to that game

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000
And really I'm one of them I think it's going to be a good game

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
By the way I have to answer this

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000
In chat because it's important

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000
Ragenator in chat says

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000
Speaking of Twitch I've heard that every episode of

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000
Mr. Rogers Neighborhood is coming to Twitch

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000
You're late to the party Ragenator

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000
It's been going on for a few days now actually

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000
We were watching

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000
The other night and I think we were in the

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000
Episodes from 1969 so it was in color

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000
They're probably in the early 70's by now

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000
But I mean that marathon

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000
Is going to be going on a while because Mr. Rogers

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000
That show didn't end until

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
2001

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000
It was like 30 years worth of television

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000
It was a long time so they got a lot of episodes to go

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000
However I got to say

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000
Yes I've been watching some Mr. Rogers on Twitch

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000
And again chat

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000
Fucking makes it

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000
Kudos to the chatters who

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000
Make that an experience

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000
So are there any awesome memes coming out of this?

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000
No not really the same thing but it's like

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000
The type of stuff like when

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000
There was one episode he was doing

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000
He was doing like a seesaw

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000
He was weighing the fruit or something

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
And when it balanced

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000
People were like Vak, Vak

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000
He's cheating and all this stuff

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000
Science, OMG

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000
The little emotes and all that

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000
People are really funny

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000
There's of course some of the

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000
Stupid shit that you would expect too

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000
Whenever Lady Abberline

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000
What's the real life lady

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000
That plays, not Lady Elaine

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000
The funky nose one

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
Lady Abberline is her name or something

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000
Aberdeen?

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000
The one who's like

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000
Like his niece or something

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000
Yeah, yeah

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000
Maybe in chat, chat probably

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000
Knows it too, when she shows up

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000
Some toilet comments show up in chat

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000
But it's not like, it doesn't cross the line

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000
Like it's just like, you kind of

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000
Chalk it up to the whole like

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
Lady Abberline

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000
Oh it's pervy dude

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
At home or whatever

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000
Who is named Betty Abberline

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000
Everything is like their names

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000
It's funny because obviously I haven't

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000
Watched Mr. Rogers neighborhood in a very

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000
Fucking long time right

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000
But like many of you

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000
I watched it every fucking day

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.000
When I was like 5 or 6 years old

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000
Picture picture is my fucking jam

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000
So all that stuff

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000
It's kind of fascinating to go back now

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000
And it's like

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000
The characters really talk like that

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000
Meow, meow, meow, meow, hello

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000
Meow, meow, meow, meow

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.000
Adventure, meow, meow, meow

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000
I was like, how did that not drive me up a

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000
Fucking wall, but

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000
Isn't that how your cat talks?

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000
No, my cat

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000
Is meow, meow, meow, feed me

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000
I was like, mom

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000
Mom

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000
Alright

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
Anyhow, sorry for the tangent

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
We're back on TV

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
That one's worthwhile cause they're raising

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000
Money for PBS I think at the end of the day

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000
I gotta say

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
A fucking smart way to do it

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000
In this day and age

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
You guys probably all remember back in the day

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:43.000
When you would watch Mr. Rogers

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000
Then you'd have the telethon comes on

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000
If you send us $50

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
You'll get a free t-shirt or a free book

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000
Or a free VHS tape

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.000
Of a night at the opera or something

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000
They would always have those telethons

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.000
Like somebody at PBS

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000
And probably because of Bob Ross

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000
Okay, let's not

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000
It's because of Bob Ross

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.000
Changed the fucking game at Twitch

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000
I'm sure now

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000
PBS was like, wait a minute

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000
We wanna do a fundraiser or something over there

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000
We get like 321 contact or something like that

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000
Fuck, Square One television

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000
Square One still hasn't been released

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000
On DVD

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000
They need to do something about that

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000
Can you imagine MathNet

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000
I'm gonna stay up

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000
For 72 hours straight when that happens

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000
I'll watch MathNet

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000
Didn't they release MathNet as a separate program

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000
At some point

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000
Like Friday

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000
Okay, here we go on TV again

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000
Friday would always be

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000
The extended

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000
MathNet episode

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000
There was only a couple

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000
Maybe they would have a MathMan

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
In the very beginning

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000
The rest of the episode was MathNet

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000
Another really cool thing that PBS did

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000
To raise money was on YouTube

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
They remixed certain themes like a year or two ago

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000
And those are

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.000
Oh yeah, some of those are

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
On the music feed

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
They're amazing

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
And Mr. Rogers has one too

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
Mr. Rogers has one, I think Reading Rainbow has one

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
And I think Julia Child has one

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
Julia Child, love it

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
Anyway, back to video games

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
But the worlds are coming

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000
As Twitch is airing this stuff

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
It's like our video game and TV worlds

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000
Are blending together

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000
Anyway, how would you like to buy a video game box

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
For five dollars

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
Yes, you can buy a video game box for five dollars

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000
It is the Nintendo Switch

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000
Splatoon 2 bundle

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
Excuse me, hiccups

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000
If you can't afford the bundle

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
Or perhaps you already own all the stuff

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000
Inside it

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000
But you just want to have a box

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
For your collection

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
You can buy one for 540 yen in Japan

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000
And I should stress

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
This is on the My Nintendo Store in Japan

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
It's not something they're doing here in the US

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000
There is no Switch inside

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000
No manuals, no boxes, no cords

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.000
It's just the box

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
The main box

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000
No little boxes inside of games or anything

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.000
So you could also buy this to prank somebody

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000
Set it up for really

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000
Pranky eBay auctions

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.000
Oh yeah, yeah

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
Or I'm going to get Loki a gift

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.000
On a future episode of OLR

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.000
That's completely empty

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000
It's going to be a Splatoon 2 box

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
And inside will just be a note that says

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
I put all of your positive things

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000
About Nintendo inside this box

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000
And it's empty

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
Those cartridges are so light that you wouldn't be able to tell if you lifted it up

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
It's true

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000
The switches are pretty light as it is

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.000
A lot of those boxes have instructions on the inside

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000
Have you looked inside the boxes?

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.000
Oh yeah, the boxes, that's what they do now

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000
They do a one sheet print on the back

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000
And that's it

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000
But anyway

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000
Keep in mind, this box is the system box

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000
So it's not

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000
No, it's not the game box

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000
Alright, anyhow

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000
One other thing to mention about

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000
Speaking about Nintendo and so forth

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000
It's a Mario Kart 8 patch that came out

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
You may have noticed that 1.1 version of Mario Kart 8 came out

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
And it adjusted the time zone issue

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000
That we bitched about with the tournament thing last week

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000
So to be fair

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000
Nintendo fixed that, yay

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.000
However, they also changed Inkling Girl's animation

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000
Apparently

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.000
She was giving an animation

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
I never really noticed this in her old animation

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000
But she was giving the Up Yours animation

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000
Which like

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000
Here is not super offensive

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
Unless there's a finger coming out of it, right?

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000
But I suppose overseas

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000
In parts of Europe and so forth

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.000
Yeah exactly, what she just did there

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
That is a little more

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000
Hold your bicep and pump through your fist

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000
That's an insult

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000
It's the same as the middle finger basically

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.000
Except if you're in

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000
Parts of Europe, namely England

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000
The two fingers

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000
Where they see the back of your hand

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000
That's right

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:52.000
So in America your IQ is one

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.000
In Britain your IQ is two

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:56.000
That's how it works

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.000
It's like one punch versus two punches

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000
That's how many licks you're gonna get

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000
Alright, so

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.000
There it is

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:06.000
Again, if you want to know why that animation changed

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000
That's because in another country

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.000
It is not polite

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.000
DarkSakura, what do you have for us before we get to release dates?

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000
Some stuff

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.000
Actually one of the Switch games I've been mildly interested in

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000
Has been Arms

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000
Which would be why I'd want to get

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.000
A Switch I think

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000
But they are getting a global

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000
Test punch event

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000
It's actually available right now

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000
Apparently on the eShop

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.000
So if you want to see if you like it

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000
Test it!

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000
Punch it in the face!

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000
Arms

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
Ok that sucked

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000
So also in other news

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.000
We have the E3

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000
2001 livestream plans

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.000
For Sony

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.000
Monday June 12th

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000
Is gonna be at

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.000
5pm Tuesday June 13th

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000
From 12pm to 6pm

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000
Live programming

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000
Wednesday June 14th from 12 to 6

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000
And Thursday June 15th from 12 to 4

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.000
So you'd be able to watch it all

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.000
There are quests to unlock

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:09.000
Rewards and

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:11.000
Different trailers

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000
To watch and the whole thing will also

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.000
Be streamed on YouTube and Twitch

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.000
Well good luck to my buddy

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000
Who I'm sure is going to be a part of this

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.000
Who used to listen to OLR years and years ago

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:23.000
And now does that stuff with Sony

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.000
Yay!

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:27.000
I'm sure he'll be in that

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:29.000
That's what a lot of the companies are doing now

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:31.000
When you can take your message direct to the people like that

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.000
We know Nintendo is doing a similar thing with Treehouse

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:35.000
Obviously Sony's got their thing going on

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:37.000
We don't know of Microsoft

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.000
Microsoft doesn't really have like a

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:41.000
People team right now

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:43.000
Like I know they have Major Nelson

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:45.000
He's kind of like the face of Xbox and so forth

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.000
I don't know, or am I mistaking something?

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:49.000
Yes I know there's the MVP program

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:51.000
And so forth but those folks

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:53.000
Aren't really like on camera

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.000
Or doing anything with that

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:57.000
So Microsoft doesn't really, like who would host a Microsoft stream

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.000
If they did something all day long

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.000
I guess it would be Major Nelson

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.000
But that's a lot for one person to do

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:05.000
Beam?

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.000
That's a good thought, that's actually a really good thought

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.000
We see on Twitch TV

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.000
We see a lot of the streaming from

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:13.000
Heroes of the Storm championships

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:15.000
Or League of Legends type of thing

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:17.000
So sure if Microsoft wanted to do an all day long thing

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000
Beam would be a great place to do it for them

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:21.000
To get some more eyes and accounts over there

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:23.000
When they stream

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:25.000
Their events actually normally

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:27.000
They have it through Microsoft's own site

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:29.000
They've got their Silverlight

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.000
Plug in thing that they use

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:33.000
Were they the ones that had

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:35.000
Adam Sessler and Morgan Webb? Or is that Bethesda?

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.000
That's Bethesda

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:39.000
Bethesda, okay, my bad

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:41.000
I thought somebody was using, yeah

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:43.000
Bethesda was using them, so

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000
Microsoft's the only one that kind of

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.000
Doesn't really do the same type of thing as the other companies

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.000
Which you know, whatever works for them

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:51.000
Alright

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:53.000
Moving on, let's travel around the world and check out

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:55.000
What you're going to be getting in stores this week

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:57.000
A little sooner than E3, Loki

02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.000
We actually have a Wii U game coming out

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000
Darksiders WarMastered Edition

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:03.000
Out on the Wii U

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:05.000
Also Disgaea 5 Complete

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:07.000
On the Nintendo Switch

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:09.000
Embers of Murm

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:11.000
On PC and Playstation 4

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:13.000
Impact Winter

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.000
On PC

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:17.000
Oh god, I'm going to butcher this

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:19.000
But let's see, Utawari

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.000
Rumono

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:23.000
Mask of Deception on Playstation 4

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:25.000
And Vita

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:27.000
Switch, finally coming out on PC

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.000
Drive Girls on Vita

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:31.000
Friday the 13th

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:33.000
The game on

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:35.000
PC, Playstation 4, and Xbox One

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:37.000
Oh, some people looking forward to that

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:39.000
That's pretty awesome, so that's coming out this week as well

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:41.000
On Friday

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:43.000
Still not going to be like the NES version

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:45.000
Which I'm sorry, the NES version

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.000
Gets a bad rap, it's not as bad as

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:49.000
Y'all make it out to be

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:51.000
Was it an action figure that you could buy that actually they had

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:53.000
Yes

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:55.000
Let's see, Get Even

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:57.000
On PC, Playstation 4

02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:59.000
And Xbox One

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:01.000
Guilty Gear Xrd

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:03.000
Revision 2 on

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:05.000
Playstation 4 and Playstation 3

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:07.000
Rime on PC

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:09.000
Playstation 4 and Xbox One

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:11.000
Samurai Warriors

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:13.000
Spirit of Sinata

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:15.000
On Playstation 4 and

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:17.000
PC

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:19.000
And finally this week we're getting Ultra Street Fighter 2

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:21.000
The final challengers

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:23.000
On the Nintendo Switch

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:25.000
That's it

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:27.000
Let's travel to Japan

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:29.000
No really, let's go to Japan

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:31.000
I'm gonna go

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:33.000
Captain Spike over at Game Buoy just got back from Japan

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:35.000
They did a great episode on that

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:37.000
Princess Irene is on her way to Japan

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:39.000
She left either yesterday or today

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:41.000
I want to go to Japan

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.000
But again, I'm worried

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:45.000
Because I don't speak Japanese

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:47.000
I know AkumaJP would help me out

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:49.000
He's a great pal

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:51.000
You'd actually be surprised the number of people

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:53.000
Who do speak some English

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:55.000
Oh yeah?

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:57.000
I wouldn't want one person to have to worry about me

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:59.000
For a whole trip while I'm out there

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:01.000
It's a lot to ask one person

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:03.000
Immersion is really good for our education

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:05.000
I guess that's true

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:07.000
Imagine if I could come back and I could actually pronounce

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.000
Japanese release dates

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:11.000
You should let me do them sometime

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:13.000
We were gonna trade at one point but then something happened

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:15.000
Oh you got pulled from the show for a few months

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:17.000
And we never ended up switching

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:19.000
You can take a semester of Japanese and you'd probably get

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:21.000
A lot better with the pronunciation

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:23.000
Education? I know right?

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:25.000
Actually what's funny is that

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:27.000
I am working on studying again

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:29.000
To try to pass the

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:31.000
First round of JLPT

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:33.000
I think that's what I'm gonna do

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:35.000
With the bidi fund

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:37.000
I'm gonna set my bidi fund on Twitch

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:39.000
So that once I get like $2,000

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:41.000
I'll go to Japan

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:43.000
Funny that you mentioned

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:45.000
There's a game, I think it's an RPG maker game

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:47.000
That's on Steam that's about learning Japanese

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:49.000
I picked it up, I just don't remember what it is

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:51.000
We talked about that on the show once

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.000
Is that the Fight Slimes Learn Japanese one?

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:55.000
I don't think that's what it was called

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.000
I know there was only 10 years ago

02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:59.000
I don't remember it because it's

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:01.000
Somewhere by Steam library

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:03.000
Good luck finding whatever game that was

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:05.000
Yeah

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:07.000
There is a game out there that

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:09.000
Teaches you Japanese

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:11.000
Alright

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:13.000
And by the way I wouldn't really spend the bidi money

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:15.000
Going to Japan, I probably buy new

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:17.000
Microphones for our studio because I'm gonna

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:19.000
Have to do that bidis or not pretty soon

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:21.000
Alright anyway

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:23.000
Let's travel around the world here to Japan

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:25.000
And virtually we'll talk about

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:27.000
What's coming out on the Playstation 4

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.000
We're getting back into some heavy releases now

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.000
With all that Golden Week stuff that happened earlier in the month

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:33.000
But we have Hyper Light Drifter

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:35.000
Is making its Japanese release on the Playstation 4 this week

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:37.000
On the 25th

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:39.000
Summer Lesson Miyamoto Hikari edition

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:41.000
And not to be confused with Nintendo's Miyamoto

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:43.000
This is some other type of

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:45.000
Education game I believe

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:47.000
It is a Playstation VR game which I think is very interesting

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:49.000
I'm not sure what it is

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:51.000
You're learning about in this game

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:53.000
But your instructor looks like

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:55.000
A nice Japanese girl that you're

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:57.000
Maybe it's kind of like immersion

02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:59.000
I like this shirt that she's wearing

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:01.000
A yeah shirt with a shark on it

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:03.000
It's cute anyway

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:05.000
Miyamoto Hikari edition is out this week

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:07.000
And then Guilty Gear Xrd Rev 2

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:09.000
Is also out in Japan

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:11.000
This week as well

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:13.000
That is all on the 25th

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:15.000
On the 3DS this week

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:17.000
Nothing, things are slowing down there

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:19.000
On the Switch this week

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:21.000
The Ultra Street Fighter release

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:23.000
Is also making its way to Japan this week

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:25.000
So you have that to look forward to

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.000
And then lastly looking at the Vita for this week

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:29.000
Sengoku Hime 7

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:31.000
Is out this week

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:33.000
In a regular and a limited edition

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:35.000
And Love of Love Emperor of Love

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:37.000
That's a whole lot of love

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:39.000
A limited edition on the Vita this week

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:41.000
So check that out

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:43.000
And those games, and I guess I didn't pick it up

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:45.000
Or at least I don't see it in my life

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:47.000
Learn Japanese to Survive

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:49.000
Yes, oh I do have it

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:51.000
Learn Japanese to Survive Hiragana Battle

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:53.000
Is what I've got

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:55.000
I have that one, I actually just bought the Katakana Battle

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:57.000
Even though I read Katakana better than Hiragana

02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:59.000
I'll have to check that out

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:01.000
That's the reverse for me

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.000
Too many of the Katakana look similar to each other for me

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:05.000
It's just because I've read too many labels

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:07.000
Because if it's something that's Western

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:09.000
It's in Katakana

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:13.000
I still remember one of the first things I ever bought you

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:15.000
Dark Sakura when we were first friends

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:17.000
Was I bought you a Japanese copy of Harry Potter

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:19.000
Do you know I still have it?

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000
Oh I would hope so

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:23.000
It's on my shelf with the little jacket on it

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:25.000
And it still has the insert in it where it explains what a crumpet is

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:27.000
No seriously

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:29.000
That's right

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:31.000
The inner part goes through

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:33.000
What different

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:35.000
Foreign terms would be

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:37.000
Jumper is used in the book

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:39.000
Why didn't the American editions have that?

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:41.000
Because we don't know what crumpets are

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:43.000
Keep in mind

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:45.000
The British one was

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:47.000
Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:49.000
And they changed

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:51.000
I have the British and the US one

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:53.000
They changed a lot

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.000
When you get further on

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:57.000
Through the books, the last book is more

02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:59.000
Dead even

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:01.000
Because I've read both of those two

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:03.000
But still it's a lot of

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:05.000
They actually shot like two different movies

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:07.000
Yeah but really it was just scenes that

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:09.000
Refer to the item

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:11.000
Anyway I don't know why I

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:13.000
Thought of that but you talking about reading Japanese

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:15.000
Made me think oh remember that book

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:17.000
It's because reading is fundamental

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:19.000
Reading is what?

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:21.000
What part of a lip sync don't you understand, Jamie?

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:23.000
That part

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:25.000
I'd like to keep it on please

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:27.000
The same parts

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.000
The same parts

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000
That was a choice

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.000
Moving on, how about the UK Dark Saga

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000
On the

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.000
What's today, the 21st?

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:42.000
On the 22nd, Trackmania 2

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.000
Lagoon for PC

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:46.000
On the 23rd, we have

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:48.000
Steel Division Normandy 44

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:50.000
Why can't it be Normandy SR2?

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:55.000
May 25th, we have Vanquish for PC

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:57.000
Samurai Warriors

02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:59.000
Sanada Maru

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:01.000
Oh it's the same game

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:03.000
They just called it Spirit of Sanada

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:05.000
For the PC one

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:07.000
But it's PC and Playstation 4

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:09.000
And on the 26th

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:11.000
Rime for Xbone

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:13.000
PC and PS4

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:17.000
Stephanie

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:19.000
That's it, alright

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:21.000
Let's continue on with Dark Sakura

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:23.000
However because she's going to take a dive

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.000
Ain't gonna do it

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:28.000
In case you are

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:30.000
Why are you putting your phone number in your email?

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.000
Did somebody put their phone number in the email?

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:34.000
Yeah they did

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:36.000
One of these days I'm gonna call you live on air

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:38.000
We did that once

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:40.000
On a really really early OLR

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000
We called somebody and it was so fucking awkward

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000
Cause that person was having a bad day

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:46.000
You should just call my mom

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:48.000
I'm not gonna call that number

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.000
I would assume some people have it automatically

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:52.000
In their work emails that they email us from

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:55.000
Oh is it his signature?

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:57.000
Yeah it might be but still

02:12:57.000 --> 02:12:59.000
Anyway I'm gonna call you

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:01.000
Just say hey it's Rob Roberts what you doing?

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:03.000
Hi baby

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:05.000
How you doing?

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:07.000
Well they didn't put a nickname in here so I'm just gonna call them Andrew

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:09.000
Okay

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:12.000
The email about the custom ITG machine last week reminded me

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000
Oh here we go again

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000
Here we go again

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.000
Another week

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.000
It's in the gate

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000
It's what this is

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000
The in the gate

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.000
I've always kind of wanted to get an arcade machine

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.000
I think Jamie said she has some

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.000
And I know Rob has talked about it before

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:32.000
Obviously space and funds are big hurdles

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.000
But I'm also a little afraid of spending a bunch of money

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:38.000
And then having a break and not being able to fix it

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.000
I'm not completely inept with technology

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.000
But I know enough to know that I know nothing Jon Snow

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:46.000
Do you have any tips or suggestions as far as places that sell them

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:48.000
Upkeeping machines etc?

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:50.000
My dream would be to own a DJ Max Technica 3 machine

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:52.000
I love that game so much

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000
And the Vita and phone Technica games

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.000
Are merely serviceable limitations

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000
A custom DDR ITG machine

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.000
Would probably be sweet too

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000
And there are plenty of other arcade faves

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:04.000
I would enjoy having

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:06.000
Thanks Andrew

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000
I will tell you this

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000
Dan and I have owned a number of games over history

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.000
One of them was our original MAME cabinet

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000
That Shermie lived in

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.000
We would pick up

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000
When we were putting a MAME in those

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
We would just pick up

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
Husks of old games

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.000
And clean them up

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000
And actually

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
Getting new arcade

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000
I'd say full working arcade machines

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.000
Is not too far off than

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.000
Getting pinball tables

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:36.000
When Dan started

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.000
He was actually helping

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000
A friend renovate

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.000
Some machines and getting them working

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000
In exchange for our first pinball table

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.000
Which

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.000
We've had some

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:50.000
Stinkers over time

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.000
But working on them

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.000
Taught Dan how to keep working on them

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000
You just don't do it until

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.000
You do it

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.000
But we've picked up machines on craigslist

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.000
We got

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.000
Our Gyruss

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000
And you've played our Gyruss

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000
Our Gyruss is in good shape

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.000
All we had to do was fix a fuse in it

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.000
So you're suggesting

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000
That maybe even though this person

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000
Knows nothing about arcade machines

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.000
Admittedly

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000
I'm happy you referred to me in the email

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.000
But the only arcade machine in my house

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000
Is a custom thing that Loki built

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000
That I haven't turned on in two years

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000
Because I think I unplugged something

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.000
And I don't know how to fix it

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.000
But at the same time

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.000
I don't really use it a lot

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000
I've thought about it

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000
I was gonna say

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000
That was a bar top cabinet

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000
Kit that I bought

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000
I mean you can honestly just build one of your own

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
But I just didn't want to cut all this shit out

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000
So really all it would take

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.000
Is just

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000
Throw a computer inside

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000
Put a monitor on a computer

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.000
And run MAME

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.000
That's probably the cheapest

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.000
Doing a Dance Dance Revolution cabinet

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:02.000
That's gonna be fucking expensive and difficult

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:04.000
Because either A, you're gonna have to build something yourself

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:06.000
And most likely if you're gonna do that

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:08.000
Just build some really nice pads

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:10.000
Instead of actually having a whole cabinet

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:12.000
Because it's gonna be a hassle

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000
To fit that in your house

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.000
Or wherever you're gonna put it

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:18.000
And then just

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:20.000
It'd be probably cheaper anyway

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.000
Back in the day you could get a third mix on the cheap

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:24.000
And put anything in it

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000
But now they're all different hardware

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.000
And people want that stuff to do that

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.000
Here's something that's becoming, are we done with the email yet?

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:32.000
Well not quite because I was gonna bring up another suggestion

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:34.000
Okay I'm gonna bring on

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000
I actually know a subject matter expert on this

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:38.000
Because I just texted him we're gonna bring on on this

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000
So in just a moment

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000
I was just gonna say there's

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:44.000
A web show on YouTube

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:46.000
Called John's Arcade

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:48.000
Do you know who hosts that?

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.000
John from Video Game Outsiders who used to be on All Games with us

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
Back in the day

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.000
Yeah right?

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:56.000
Look what he's doing now

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:58.000
And look what we're doing now

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000
I like to say that I like to watch

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000
His show because he does go into the guts

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.000
Of the restoration

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:08.000
He answers questions for people

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.000
And I would probably say he's done a lot more renovation

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:12.000
Than Dan and I have done

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000
He's learned a lot from his podcasting years

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.000
That he's applying to his YouTube medium

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000
Yeah if I had a basement I would have an arcade

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.000
Yeah

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:22.000
Alright I'm gonna do a quick phone call here

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.000
Okay

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000
So this might be somebody you want to say hello to as well

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.000
We're actually gonna call her live on air

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.000
So this is my pal

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000
Melody

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000
We're gonna take this call here

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000
And I warned her that this is coming through

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.000
And she might have some people

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000
She said she's in the car

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000
That she's gonna take this call in the car

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:44.000
Hi is Melody there? Hi

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.000
Hi

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000
Hi Melody it's Rob Roberts

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:50.000
Here at Orange Lounge Radio

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:52.000
How are you my dear?

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:54.000
I'm doing great how are you doing tonight?

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.000
I am good and thank you for agreeing

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:58.000
To come on last minute but you know sometimes we get emails

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:00.000
Okay we get emails here on the show

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:02.000
I don't know the answer to this question

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000
But I know somebody who does

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.000
And this is what happened tonight is we got an email

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:08.000
About and the question was about

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:10.000
I want to get

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:12.000
Can you paraphrase what was that question we got

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:14.000
I want to own a DDR machine basically right?

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.000
Yeah one of them was I want to own a DDR machine

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:18.000
So I think we need to suggest something that's easy to maintain

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.000
And relatively on the cheap

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:22.000
So tell us a little bit about your home arcade

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:24.000
Melody

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:26.000
The one that keeps expanding

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:28.000
Until we run out of space

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.000
Which is now

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:32.000
We started out with one

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:34.000
DDR Solo 2000

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:36.000
That I'm with DJ Melvis right now

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:38.000
And it was his

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:40.000
And the board on it died

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.000
It had a bad RAM chip

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:44.000
So we have a friend who managed to hook a PS2

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:46.000
Into it so it runs off

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:48.000
It's a giant PS2 essentially

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:50.000
Then we stumbled

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:52.000
Into a friend who was selling

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:54.000
Para Para Paradise

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:56.000
Which is the game how can you

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000
Brought that home

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:00.000
Then went to California Extreme

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.000
The gaming show and realized

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000
I love Dance Maniacs

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.000
And wanted to own one

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:08.000
And I got lucky in that

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:10.000
I googled around and found one

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:12.000
And then decided we wanted

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:14.000
Another DDR machine

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:16.000
So I hopped on good old eBay

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:18.000
And discovered

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:20.000
When I was looking for

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:22.000
DDR Extreme

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:24.000
I found Revolution X

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:26.000
And we all went

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:28.000
Oh, that would be fun to own

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:30.000
So that came home from Indiana

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:32.000
Then

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:34.000
A special Revolution X

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.000
And that's my friend Christine in the back

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.000
We're all in the car right now

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:40.000
Hi kids

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:42.000
So

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:44.000
Then we ended up

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:46.000
Getting a friend's gauntlet

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.000
Because he doesn't have space

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:50.000
And then we decided we wanted

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:52.000
Another DDR when a friend of mine

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:54.000
Was talking to me about it

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:56.000
So we currently have

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:58.000
3 DDRs, a Para Para Paradise

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.000
A Dance Maniac, Gauntlet, and Revolution X

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:02.000
All in one garage

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:04.000
Even I don't know how you've

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.000
And you've even gone so far as to

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:08.000
Carpet your garage at this point

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:10.000
Yes

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.000
If I'm right don't y'all have a

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.000
We have two disco balls now

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:16.000
You almost

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:18.000
Can't see the black light carpet now

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:20.000
Because there's just so many machines in there

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:22.000
One little sliver of carpet

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:24.000
Wow

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.000
It is turning out to be quite amazing

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:28.000
And if I'm right don't y'all have a single

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:30.000
Car garage?

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:32.000
Yeah

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.000
Technically it's a two car garage

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
But you'd have to get really friendly with that second car

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000
They call it a two car garage

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:40.000
But literally the two cars

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:42.000
Are nothing else

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.000
I know what you're talking about

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:46.000
And trust me

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.000
I feel your pain because we've got

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:50.000
Two disco balls in my garage now

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:52.000
And three arcade cabinets

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.000
And I'm very jealous of that World Cup

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:56.000
You know that's my baby

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:58.000
And y'all are always welcome to come over and play anytime

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:00.000
Okay so here's the thing

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:02.000
I want to get answered for our emailer

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:04.000
Now obviously when it comes to the money

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:06.000
When it comes to the money

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:08.000
I'm not going to ask how you afforded it

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:10.000
Because that's nobody's business

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:12.000
If y'all want something bad enough you save for it

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:14.000
That's what it is

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:16.000
So when it comes to the money you just have to save the money

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:20.000
How did you know that what you were going to get was a good quality?

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:22.000
It sounds like you took

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:24.000
You had a friend of a friend

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:26.000
Referral in a couple of those cases

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:28.000
So you kind of knew that that was good

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:30.000
But you did the eBay thing

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:32.000
How did you know that you were going to buy something that was going to work?

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.000
I asked a lot of questions

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:36.000
In that case

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:38.000
That was actually for the Revolution X

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.000
For those of us who don't know what Revolution X is

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:42.000
It's a 1990's

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:44.000
Shooter game starring

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:46.000
Aerosmith

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:48.000
And it is fantastic

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:50.000
Fantasticly bad

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:52.000
But it is a lot of fun

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:54.000
But I was

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:56.000
Smart enough to kind of know what I was looking at

02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:58.000
I played it before once or twice

02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:00.000
Mel and Christine

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:02.000
Have both played it several times

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:04.000
So I asked them

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:06.000
What should I be asking

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:08.000
And just asked a lot of detailed questions

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:10.000
When you can't get out

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:12.000
To actually try the machine yourself

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:14.000
It's important to know what you're looking at

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:16.000
And just

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:18.000
You're spending a lot of money on an investment

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:20.000
They need to answer your questions

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:22.000
If you're not comfortable with it, someone else is going to have another machine

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:24.000
And you're going to be fine with that one

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:26.000
I think that's some really solid advice

02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:28.000
Melody, I'm going to let you go

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:30.000
Because obviously this segment

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:32.000
Has taken like 10 minutes of our time now

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:34.000
But I really appreciate you letting me do this to you last minute

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:38.000
Yeah, not a problem

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:40.000
Quite honestly, you know how to get a hold of me

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:42.000
If they have more questions, I'm willing to answer

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:44.000
Quite honestly, if any listeners have questions

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:46.000
I'm willing to do what I can to help

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:48.000
I mean, I'm not an expert

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:50.000
By any stretch of the imagination

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:52.000
But I've done this a few times now

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:54.000
So if people have questions on what they should be looking for

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:56.000
Or how to look for it

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:58.000
I'm happy to help out

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:00.000
Do you have a Twitter?

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:02.000
I do have a Twitter

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:04.000
What is my Twitter?

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:06.000
anonymous

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:08.000
There you go

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:10.000
So you can get a hold of our direct

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:12.000
You don't have to go through us

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:14.000
You can reach out to anonymous directly

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:16.000
And get your questions answered

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:18.000
About DDR home ownership

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:20.000
Thank you so much you guys

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:22.000
Have a safe drive wherever you're going

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:24.000
Have fun storming the castle

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:26.000
Have a good dinner guys

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:28.000
I did a quick search

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:30.000
Bye, take care

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:32.000
Did a quick search on eBay

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000
And every now and then you can find some pretty good deals

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:36.000
Too bad it's in Washington

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:38.000
I made a third mix

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:40.000
It's missing the hardware

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:42.000
But the pads and everything

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:44.000
It's kind of torn apart

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:46.000
But $167 for the whole cabinet

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:48.000
What? Wow

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:50.000
So I was like, fuck

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:52.000
That's all I would want right there

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:54.000
It's just the pads anyway

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:56.000
It's a good deal, too bad it's in Washington

02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:58.000
Jump on that, ends tomorrow

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:00.000
So if you're interested in the Washington area, there you go

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:02.000
And let this be a lesson to anybody that knows me

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:04.000
IRL

02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:06.000
It's not the Rolodex I hate, but it's the one next to that

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:08.000
It's the little Rolodex in my head

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:10.000
That's like, oh, so and so has this

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:12.000
So and so does this

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:14.000
And when I hear it, I'm gonna call you

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:16.000
On a moment's notice

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:18.000
Like I just called Melody

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:20.000
There we go, anyway

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:22.000
It was funny, I was thinking of Melody in terms of the

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:24.000
DDR machines

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:26.000
And all the stuff you said about pinball

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:28.000
And all that's great, but I know

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:30.000
Oh my god, when I hear all this, I'm like, Melody

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:32.000
Owns the music game stuff

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:34.000
Now I didn't know that they had a Revolution X

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:36.000
And now I'm super jelly because I love

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.000
That stupid game, because you can go

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:40.000
And find like Steve Perry on the toilet

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:42.000
The last time I was over

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:44.000
There, we played Dance Mediacs

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:46.000
And they had just got the Revolution X

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:48.000
But the gauntlet is new and now

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:50.000
The carpeting, they're really making an

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:52.000
Arcade out of that, that's Mel's arcade

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:54.000
You wanna talk about John's arcade, now you got Mel's arcade

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:56.000
Competition on the west coast

02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:58.000
Dan and I had an off talk about

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:00.000
Next time we look for another house

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:02.000
Of maybe doing a three car garage

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:04.000
So that he can have a place for the Mustang

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:06.000
The Mustang's got paint on it now

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:08.000
Get one of those insulated garages like I used to have

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:10.000
At the other house, I know that place

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:12.000
Got insanely hot, but with a swamp cooler

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:14.000
That place would have been a great

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:16.000
We had the tornado of doom

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:18.000
That was great, anyhow

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:20.000
Alright, last email, very long answer to that email

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:22.000
But a good one

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:24.000
As a follow up from last week, I neglected to specify

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:26.000
That my headphones are used more for my mobile

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:28.000
Devices than my computer and consoles

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:30.000
This is from Robert M by the way

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:32.000
Unfortunately by those standards, I really can't use

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:34.000
Any of the sets that you recommend

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:36.000
Coincidentally though, Ninja Sista and

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:38.000
Pandelicious of Electric Sista-hood

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:40.000
Began their show talking about

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:42.000
Checking out Lucid Sound LS30

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:44.000
Set, as well as the manufacturer

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:46.000
Set for Xbox One, I will definitely have to

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:48.000
Try out the former for myself

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:50.000
How funny, what a coincidence

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:52.000
But yay, yay Electric Sista-hood

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:54.000
I had the chance

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:56.000
To go to this year's Anime St. Louis

02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:58.000
In St. Charles and

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:00.000
Was excited to find out that the game room

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:02.000
This year was set up by Tokyo Attack

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:04.000
Who I'm sure Ron was familiar with

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:06.000
I'm familiar with

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:08.000
What's in Rhode Island?

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:10.000
Yes, but they're all over the East Coast

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:12.000
I've also laid out their ads for DerpyCon

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:14.000
Funny

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:16.000
FYI, I've done the DerpyCon

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:18.000
Guidebook

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:20.000
For like four years now

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:22.000
If you're a music game fan on the East Coast, you know

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:24.000
Tokyo Attack, you do

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:26.000
Outstanding Japanese arcade games

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:28.000
Mostly music rhythm and a surprisingly

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:30.000
High representation of Konami machines

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:32.000
Then again, being music games

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:34.000
I got to play the WarioWare-like

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:36.000
The Bishibashi

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:38.000
I love Bishibashi

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:40.000
They have that at Japantown in the arcade

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:42.000
Is it the

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:44.000
Original Bishibashi or the Bishibashi

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:46.000
Special? I don't know what the difference is

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:48.000
Okay

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:50.000
And of course the Tea Table flipping game

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:52.000
I'm also there

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:54.000
Don't flip it unless you're playing it

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:56.000
I like that sign

02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:58.000
Didn't stay as long as I probably should have

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:00.000
But enjoyed wondering

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:02.000
About seeing attendees' costumes

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:04.000
Lots of Overwatch, of course

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:06.000
Robert M

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:07.000
That's it

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:08.000
Great, awesome

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:09.000
Thanks for the emails you guys

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:10.000
If you want to email us in a future week

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:12.000
Participate at

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:14.000
OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:15.000
Participate

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:16.000
To do those things

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:18.000
Alright, we're going to be taking your calls

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:20.000
Not only do we call out sometimes, but sometimes

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:22.000
I'll call in over at OrangeLoungeRadio

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:24.000
All one word on Skype

02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:26.000
But we'll get to those calls after some more news

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:28.000
First off, Loki

02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:30.000
It's like this never ends, but

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:32.000
You may remember

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:34.000
It's been a big deal with the whole ZeniMax

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:36.000
Oculus suit

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:38.000
Well that's concluded, of course, with Oculus

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:40.000
Owing ZeniMax some money

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:42.000
So what's the next step?

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:44.000
ZeniMax, of course, is going after Samsung

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:46.000
Because Samsung

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:48.000
Makes a device called the Gear VR

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:50.000
Which is powered by Oculus

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:52.000
Which is powered by profit for

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:54.000
Bethesda, because they feel that it

02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:56.000
Fringes on their intellectual

02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:58.000
Property

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:00.000
Is this the same thing? Bobby was talking a lot about

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:02.000
VR stuff on his show tonight, he was talking about something where like

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:04.000
There was a conversation that happened

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:06.000
With like a former, and this whole lawsuit

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:08.000
Is coming from a freaking conversation

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:10.000
That happened between like a

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:12.000
Former employee of a company

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:14.000
It sounded like a stretch

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:16.000
He described it much better than I could because

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:18.000
Admittedly, do not follow all the VR

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:20.000
Drama as much as he does, but you know

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:22.000
Yeah, they're very litigious

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:24.000
So hopefully, I'm wondering

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:26.000
With this, if that's going to be

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:28.000
More of a stretch, because it's like

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:30.000
I don't know how much is really powered by Oculus

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:32.000
I mean, because it's just

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:34.000
It's just a damn image with

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:36.000
It's a basic case

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:38.000
There's no real hardware in the

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:40.000
The device, so I don't know

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:42.000
It might be a little bit trickier, but

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:44.000
But they feel that they have precedent

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:46.000
Based off the last Oculus

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:48.000
Are they drunk with power now? Because what happened with Facebook

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:50.000
Is that's what's happening?

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:52.000
Dude, I get it

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:54.000
That you're suing these people

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:56.000
Let's see you put a VR device in

02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:58.000
If you're going to sue all these people over

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:00.000
Your technology being used

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:02.000
Let's see what this is going to be

02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:04.000
Are you going to sit on it?

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:06.000
I just don't fucking care

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:08.000
I mean, like

02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:10.000
Fallout VR might be cool, but

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:12.000
I don't know

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:14.000
Hey, like a

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:16.000
Skyrim type of VR thing

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:18.000
Might be really rad

02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:20.000
I'd be down with that too

02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:22.000
Alright, well let's move on to something else

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:24.000
That I think a lot of us were down with

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:26.000
And then it was suddenly gone

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:28.000
Y'all know how Scalebound got cancelled, right?

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:30.000
Microsoft was teaming up with

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:32.000
Platinum Games to do Scalebound

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:34.000
And it just got cancelled a couple months ago

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:36.000
Which, unfortunately

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:38.000
There's a variety of reasons why this could have happened

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:40.000
It could have been because nobody in Japan

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:42.000
Has an Xbox One and maybe Microsoft

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:44.000
Has just decided they're not going to

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:46.000
Continue to pursue the Japanese market, I don't know

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:48.000
Or perhaps deadlines were not

02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:50.000
Being met, I don't know

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:52.000
But, here's the interesting

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:54.000
Again, these are rumors, but the interesting rabble rabble

02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:56.000
Going around right now is that this

02:29:56.000 --> 02:29:58.000
Project might not actually

02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:00.000
Be dead, but this is coming

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:02.000
From the fact that Microsoft has renewed

02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:04.000
The trademark

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:06.000
There are rumors in addition to that

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:08.000
That are saying the teams are working

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:10.000
On salvaging the project

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:12.000
Possibly even

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:14.000
Reworking it from the ground up

02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:16.000
Without Platinum being involved

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:18.000
Talk about it

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:20.000
Wouldn't Platinum's

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:22.000
Logos still have to be on it?

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:24.000
Because they kind of started the development

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:26.000
And would own the name Scalebound?

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:28.000
They wouldn't necessarily own it

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:30.000
But they would be partial owners with it with Microsoft

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:32.000
Right? Even though they might not end up

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:34.000
Developing this game at all?

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:36.000
I know, lots of rumors

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:38.000
And who knows what, this could be a very

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:40.000
If this shows up at E3

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:42.000
This is going to be a very

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:44.000
Audible gasp type of moment

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:46.000
During the presser

02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:48.000
I was all that hot on Scalebound to begin with

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:50.000
I'd be like, yeah, that's neat

02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:52.000
I don't think I'd be

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:54.000
Audible gasp

02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:56.000
Well, I mean, because there's going to be

02:30:56.000 --> 02:30:58.000
A lot of people that are like, whoa

02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:00.000
Platinum totally got shafted

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:02.000
In that whole deal, so

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:04.000
It's not like Platinum makes

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:06.000
Stinker games, like Bayonetta, Bayonetta 2

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:08.000
Hello, those are like some of the best video games ever made

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:10.000
Starbucks

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:12.000
Oh yeah, that's right, Platinum did do that

02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:14.000
Well, okay, not everything's a winner

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:16.000
They also did, I think it was Platinum

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:18.000
They did Anarchy Reigns

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:20.000
Which wasn't that great either

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:22.000
Vanquish was good

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:24.000
Whatever, not everybody's going to be

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:26.000
Hitting everything out of the ballpark

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:28.000
All the time

02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:30.000
After all, Rockstar did make

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:32.000
Rockstar Table Tennis, but that's not necessarily

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:34.000
A genre that I'm interested in

02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:36.000
Hi, Allen's back

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:38.000
Hello, Platinum Games makes great

02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:40.000
Games, but they make great niche games

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:42.000
That's their thing, they don't

02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:44.000
Really make games with mass appeal

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:46.000
Which I'm sure a lot of people

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:48.000
Love Platinum Games because

02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:50.000
They will do that good, weird shit

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:52.000
But the rumor of like

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:54.000
Is Platinum Games Studio going to

02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:56.000
Shut down because Microsoft totally

02:31:56.000 --> 02:31:58.000
Screwed them over with this

02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:00.000
Basically it's like

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:02.000
Is this a sign

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:04.000
That the studio is failing because

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:06.000
They can't make a massive

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:08.000
Blockbuster, but it's like that's

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:10.000
Not what they do, like Bayonetta 2

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:12.000
Probably one of the best action fighting

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:14.000
Beat em up games ever

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:16.000
But it was made on the Wii U and even then

02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:18.000
If any fucking Wii U game

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:20.000
Needs to be re-released, it's that

02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:22.000
Seriously, so Platinum Games is great, but they

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:24.000
Just, they don't

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:26.000
Because they're always looking for

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:28.000
The new weird shit

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:30.000
Maybe that's one of the things

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:32.000
That Microsoft didn't like about them, they take too long

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:34.000
And they're like, we don't know

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:36.000
What you're doing with this, this is too weird for us

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:38.000
Maybe that's it

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:40.000
But I'm sure Platinum Games

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:42.000
Is going to be just fine, there are rumors

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:44.000
Very, very, very big rumors

02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:46.000
Of Bayo 3

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:48.000
With some things that showed up in the PC release

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:50.000
And just the fact

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:52.000
That Bayonetta deserves another game

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:54.000
Even if the second game was on Wii U

02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:58.000
Nintendo may recognize that it's their own damn fault

02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:00.000
It didn't sell, and they may be back in the third one

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:02.000
I was so happy when Bayonetta

02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:04.000
PC port showed up out of nowhere

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:06.000
Because I thought, they have all the Devil May Cry shit

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:08.000
On here, why don't they do

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:10.000
Bayonetta, when it happened

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:12.000
It's so awesome, but we'll never

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:14.000
We will never get Bayonetta 2

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:16.000
On PC because Nintendo

02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:18.000
Paid every penny for that game

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:20.000
So hopefully they're paying for a third game

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:22.000
So I don't care, I want anyway

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:24.000
But yeah, I realize it's not realistic

02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:26.000
A true internet gamer

02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:28.000
I don't care if it doesn't make sense

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:30.000
I want it, and I'm going to be mad if I don't get it

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:34.000
Alright, moving on

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:36.000
Let's go to another story

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:38.000
Dark Sakura

02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:40.000
Well this one made my heart sing

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:42.000
You?

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:44.000
Me, my shriveled little heart

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:46.000
Inflated three sizes

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:48.000
Basically

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:50.000
There is a blind gamer

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:52.000
Blind gamer in Japan

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:54.000
Who sent Nintendo

02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:56.000
Yeah, there's the gasp

02:33:56.000 --> 02:33:58.000
That sent Nintendo a

02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:00.000
A letter, not asking for

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:02.000
Nintendo's been known to replace

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:04.000
Broken games and things

02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:06.000
When customers have been incredibly sad by it

02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:08.000
If their circumstances

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:10.000
In particular

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:12.000
The dad wrote out the letter

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:14.000
From his son

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:16.000
And I will

02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:18.000
Go ahead and read the letter

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:20.000
Basically, the son's name is Hibiki

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:22.000
And he has retinoblastoma

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:24.000
In both eyes

02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:26.000
So he's been blind since he was two years old

02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:28.000
I'll read the letter

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:30.000
Dear Nintendo, hello, my name is Hibiki Sakai

02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:32.000
And I am in fifth grade

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:34.000
I am blind, but I've always wanted

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:36.000
To play video games like everybody else

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:38.000
But there aren't many games

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:40.000
I can play at all

02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:42.000
The one game I can really play is Rhythm Tengoku

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:46.000
For those who don't know, that's Rhythm Heaven

02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:48.000
It's the only game I can enjoy

02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:50.000
Together with others

02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:52.000
And I never lose at it

02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:54.000
I've gotten perfect scores on all the versions

02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:56.000
On the Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS, Wii

02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:58.000
And 3DS too

02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:00.000
So I really, really

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:02.000
Want you to make more Rhythm Tengoku games

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:04.000
And it's perfectly fine if you make them

02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:06.000
A little harder too

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:08.000
I think that there are a lot of other kids with visual impairments

02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:10.000
Who want to play video games but can't

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:12.000
So I'd love for you to develop more games

02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:14.000
For people with handicaps to enjoy playing with others

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:16.000
I will always support you Nintendo

02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:18.000
From Hibiki Sakai

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:20.000
So Nintendo replied

02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:22.000
First of all

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:24.000
With a letter in Braille

02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:26.000
Which I thought was pretty neat

02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:28.000
And then a printed one

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:30.000
I guess for Dad to read

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:32.000
And so the response from that is

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:34.000
Thank you so much for sending us here

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:36.000
At Nintendo your heartwarming letter

02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:38.000
We're so happy to hear that you've perfected

02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:40.000
And enjoyed Rhythm Tengoku, Rhythm Tengoku Gold

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:42.000
Mina no Rhythm Tengoku

02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:44.000
And Rhythm Tengoku the best

02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:46.000
We have passed on your letter to Nintendo's

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:48.000
Development department

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:50.000
We want to keep making games that everyone can have fun playing

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:52.000
So thank you for your support

02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:54.000
So

02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:56.000
Also the kid plays the drums really well too

02:35:56.000 --> 02:35:58.000
Did you watch the video?

02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:00.000
I didn't watch the video

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:02.000
He plays drums pretty well

02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:04.000
But yeah I just thought that it was neat

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:06.000
Because there was another thing on here

02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:08.000
Where his dad said that

02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:10.000
He was going under surgery

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:12.000
That will quote

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:14.000
Be nothing but days full of pain and tears

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:18.000
So that he can

02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:20.000
Hopefully regain some vision

02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:22.000
Or have his eyes taken care of

02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:24.000
But it's just

02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:26.000
You know we have some

02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:28.000
Some listeners

02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:30.000
Who have some visual impairment

02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:32.000
Others who

02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:34.000
Have you know

02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:36.000
All kinds of

02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:38.000
I would say

02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:40.000
Limited abilities

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:42.000
In some physical aspects

02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:44.000
Be it

02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:46.000
You know like we were talking about vision

02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:48.000
Hearing, mobility

02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:50.000
Autism, hello

02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:52.000
You know other things

02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:54.000
And I think that it's great that

02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:56.000
Nintendo

02:36:56.000 --> 02:36:58.000
Took the time to respond to that

02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:00.000
Letter and acknowledge that

02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:02.000
There are people out there who play games

02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:04.000
Who may not be

02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:06.000
Your generally abled person

02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:08.000
So

02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:10.000
I thought it was really good

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:12.000
No that's awesome

02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:14.000
And I really super love that they replied

02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:16.000
With a braille letter

02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:18.000
Well done Nintendo, kudos

02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:20.000
And also I

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:22.000
Probably not going to hear this but I do hope

02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:24.000
Hibiki's surgery goes well

02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:26.000
Same

02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:28.000
Alright thank you for sharing that nice story DarkSarka

02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:30.000
Appreciate it

02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:32.000
Alright we just have a couple more stories for you guys

02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:34.000
So speaking of more VR stuff

02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:36.000
This is pretty cool

02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:38.000
So a

02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:40.000
I guess a

02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:42.000
Half Life 2 mod

02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:44.000
Or a Half Life 2

02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:46.000
VR mod

02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:48.000
For the Oculus Rift and Vive

02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:50.000
Has been in the works since 2013

02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:52.000
It just made its way through

02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:54.000
Steam Greenlight

02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:56.000
So hopefully that means

02:37:56.000 --> 02:37:58.000
It will be coming out relatively soon

02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:00.000
So having the project on Steam

02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:02.000
Of course will make it easier for them to develop

02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:06.000
So they're allowed to do this even though Half Life

02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:08.000
Isn't really their game

02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:10.000
I think so yeah, there's been other mods that have gotten

02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:12.000
Like Gary's mod is out there right

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:14.000
Well Gary's mod, there's also

02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:16.000
Some Portal side story

02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:18.000
Stuff that they had that they released

02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:20.000
Granted those were free, I'm not sure if this

02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:22.000
Is going to cost anything when it comes out

02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:24.000
Maybe not, maybe it might be

02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:26.000
A free thing, so I don't know

02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:28.000
If you have

02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:30.000
Half Life or something like that

02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:32.000
Or a Valve game that you'll be able to play this

02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:34.000
Alright

02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:36.000
Well, unfortunately

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:38.000
Ending on a not so great

02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:40.000
Note tonight, but I just want to take a minute to let

02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:42.000
You all know, if you didn't know

02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:44.000
That I guess this was on May 13th

02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:46.000
That this actually happened, but

02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:48.000
American voice actor John

02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:50.000
Sigan, I don't know if I said that right, I'm really sorry

02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:52.000
If I mispronounced that, but he passed away

02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:54.000
And he was more

02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:56.000
Probably known to you guys as an actor

02:38:56.000 --> 02:38:58.000
In the Metal Gear series

02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:00.000
He was Solidius Snake

02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:02.000
In Metal Gear Solid 2

02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:04.000
Sons of Liberty, but he was also in

02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:06.000
Some other TV productions and so forth

02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:08.000
And he did Mafia 3, he was in that game

02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:10.000
As well, so

02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:12.000
Unfortunately

02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:14.000
We lost him this week, so rest in peace

02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:16.000
Alright, we're going to

02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:18.000
Move on to the Skype line

02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:20.000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word

02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:22.000
On Skype is the place you can call us

02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:24.000
And we'll

02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:26.000
Take your calls, Orange Lounge Radio again

02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:28.000
All one word on Skype

02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:30.000
It is already lighting up in here

02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:32.000
Let's get to some calls and take some calls

02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:34.000
Oh my god

02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:36.000
Hi Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:38.000
Hey Zaku, long time

02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:40.000
I know, I know, the struggle

02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:42.000
Was kind of real, but it was only

02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:44.000
Because I finally

02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:46.000
Let's say, switched careers

02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:48.000
Well not so much switched careers, but switched jobs

02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:50.000
New phone, who dis?

02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:52.000
Yeah

02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:54.000
I'm starting a new job tomorrow

02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:56.000
So as a result, yeah

02:39:56.000 --> 02:39:58.000
I had to stay away from things like OLR for a bit

02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:00.000
Although you did see me in December

02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:02.000
When I was out on the West Coast

02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:04.000
Briefly

02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:06.000
Well what's on your mind tonight?

02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:08.000
Nothing much, other than the fact that

02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:10.000
Things like E3 is looming

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:12.000
And the fact that I got

02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:14.000
Well, another one that I caught was like

02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:16.000
The fact that free to play

02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:18.000
Doesn't necessarily mean

02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:20.000
You know

02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:22.000
It doesn't necessarily mean

02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:24.000
That everyone's on the same page

02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:26.000
Case in point, I don't know

02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:28.000
If you read this article recently

02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:30.000
Where one YouTube streamer

02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:32.000
Basically got

02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:34.000
Threatened with a

02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:36.000
Strike on their account because

02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:38.000
Wargaming, the folks who make World of Tanks

02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:40.000
Didn't like the fact that they were

02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:42.000
That he was basically bashing

02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:44.000
Their

02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:46.000
New tank that essentially

02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:48.000
Played a win-grab

02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:50.000
That's designed to maximize

02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:52.000
The amount of profit

02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:54.000
You know, for these freemium games

02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:56.000
I really fucking hate

02:40:56.000 --> 02:40:58.000
When copyright holders, and this is a problem

02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:00.000
I put this squarely on YouTube

02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:02.000
Honestly, for having this system set up in the first place

02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:04.000
But I hate when copyright holders

02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:06.000
Kind of abuse that to

02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:08.000
Try to strike down, you know, things that are

02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:10.000
Critical, and that's what it is

02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:12.000
It's a criticism, and it's not like

02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:14.000
Unfounded criticism either

02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:16.000
It's, you know, like you say

02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:18.000
Potentially a play to win type of situation

02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:20.000
And people have a right to kind of know about that

02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:22.000
Just like, you know, when Siskel

02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:24.000
And Ebert use a clip from a movie

02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:26.000
To drive home the point that this movie might be kind of

02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:28.000
Fucking terrible, then

02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:30.000
Obviously I'm dating myself using that reference

02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:32.000
But you know what I mean, those names live on

02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:34.000
And mean any movie reviewers

02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:36.000
That are out there, they use a clip

02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:38.000
And they might be critical of it

02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:40.000
The movie people aren't like, well we're

02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:42.000
Gonna fucking sue your show, and

02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:44.000
You're never going to be able to review our movie again

02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:46.000
I'm sure somebody's tried that, but it doesn't

02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:48.000
Fucking work, because, you know,

02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:50.000
We have, that's why we have fair use laws

02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:52.000
To be able to comment on that stuff

02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:54.000
But on the other hand, to be fair

02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:56.000
This one, he was part

02:41:56.000 --> 02:41:58.000
Of a particular program

02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:00.000
That gives said people

02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:02.000
Insider access to upcoming

02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:04.000
DLC

02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:06.000
If they want to kick him out of the program, fine

02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:08.000
But he has every right to say, I got

02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:10.000
Kicked out of the program because I

02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:12.000
Went against the grain, and I wouldn't

02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:15.000
True, but at the same token

02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:17.000
The reason why they're after him in particular

02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:19.000
Is because of the fact that he actually

02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:21.000
Cursed him out in a YouTube video

02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:23.000
Like he cursed out Wargaming

02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:25.000
He essentially

02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:27.000
He essentially bit the hand that

02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:28.000
Fed him

02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:30.000
Well, now when we're getting into the level

02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:32.000
Now when we're talking about unprofessionalism

02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:33.000
Yeah

02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:35.000
Now, okay, now my opinion starts to sway

02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:37.000
A little bit, is that okay, well

02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:39.000
If you're unprofessional, then yes, you were gonna

02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:41.000
Get kicked out of the club. However

02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:43.000
I would still say he has

02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:45.000
A right to be critical, but you

02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:47.000
Have to expect that if you're unprofessional

02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:49.000
In the way that you do it, you're gonna get kicked

02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:51.000
Out of the special club, and you're not gonna be able to

02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:52.000
Get some of those perks

02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:54.000
But they also copyright strike his videos too

02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:56.000
Did they end up doing that?

02:42:56.000 --> 02:42:58.000
See, that's a low blow in my opinion

02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:00.000
Yeah, they did that

02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:02.000
Just because of the fact that

02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:04.000
Even though, yes, you have a right to criticize

02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:06.000
You know, under copyright law

02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:08.000
You have the right to criticize something

02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:10.000
Something copyrighted, but whether or not

02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:12.000
Like he's violating any

02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:14.000
Any NDA or any type of

02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:16.000
Agreement that he signed as part of joining

02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:18.000
The contributors program, that's probably where they're

02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:20.000
They're trying to

02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:22.000
Protect that copyright, in addition to

02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:24.000
Also protecting their brand by not

02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:26.000
By trying to essentially

02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:28.000
Not associate their brand

02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:30.000
With someone who essentially

02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:32.000
You know, uses F-bombs to

02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:34.000
You know, to make their point about

02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:36.000
Something, to vent their frustration

02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:38.000
But not do it in a very professional manner

02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:40.000
And they don't

02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:42.000
But they don't owe him a goddamn thing

02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:44.000
And that's important too

02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:46.000
And I say that to anybody

02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:48.000
That's trying to get into this medium

02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:50.000
The YouTubes, the Twitches, the podcasting

02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:52.000
And all this stuff, and this is one lesson

02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:54.000
We've learned over the past 15 years

02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:56.000
Not that I ever think we were guilty of committing it

02:43:56.000 --> 02:43:58.000
But one thing, you know, I gotta let you all know

02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:00.000
Is, you know, nobody

02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:02.000
Owes you a goddamn thing

02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:04.000
You're gonna have to work for it, you know

02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:06.000
And that's what it boils

02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:08.000
Down to at the end of the day, when it comes to

02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:10.000
Viewers, when it comes to

02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:12.000
Free products, when it comes to

02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:14.000
Getting into E3 and all this stuff

02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:16.000
Nobody fucking owes you shit

02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:18.000
And you're gonna have to really work and prove

02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:20.000
And that's

02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:22.000
Where people sometimes get into a tricky

02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:24.000
Tricky area, because some people

02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:26.000
Are like, I wanna be in the circle

02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:28.000
I wanna be somebody that's gonna be

02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:30.000
Recognized, so I'm gonna be a mouthpiece

02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:32.000
For these organizations and I'm gonna

02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:34.000
Say everything that they wanna hear

02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:36.000
Because I wanna be accepted, I wanna be loved

02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:38.000
And I wanna go to all these parties

02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:40.000
But then you're kind of, you know

02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:42.000
Losing, so it's like

02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:44.000
It's a really tricky

02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:46.000
Balance you have to do

02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:48.000
Where it's like, you can be nice

02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:50.000
To your, and you can be

02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:52.000
Professional, this is where this guy went wrong

02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:54.000
As he was unprofessional, you can be nice

02:44:54.000 --> 02:44:56.000
You can be professional to all that, to these companies

02:44:56.000 --> 02:44:58.000
But at the same time, you kinda owe it to your

02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:00.000
You owe it to your audience

02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:02.000
To be honest

02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:04.000
Yeah, and unfortunately

02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:06.000
He basically, the way he went about it

02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:08.000
He had, I mean

02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:10.000
His criticisms were very

02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:12.000
Fair, I have to give him that

02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:14.000
But the way he went about it

02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:16.000
And the fact that he threw his

02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:18.000
You know, he threw Wargaming

02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:20.000
Under the bus, especially if they provided

02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:22.000
Him with something that wasn't even out yet

02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:24.000
This was like upcoming

02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:26.000
Like this DLC was essentially

02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:28.000
You know, not even released to the public

02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:30.000
And that's probably why they're going after him

02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:32.000
Well, okay, now

02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:34.000
Okay, now, see, now the

02:45:34.000 --> 02:45:36.000
But why give it to him then? Why give it to him

02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:38.000
If they didn't want him talking about it?

02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:40.000
Well, but here's the, if the DLC wasn't

02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:42.000
Released yet, and he put that on

02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:44.000
YouTube

02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:46.000
But now we're in slippery slope

02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:48.000
But they wouldn't have done that

02:45:48.000 --> 02:45:50.000
If he talked favorably about it

02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:52.000
Yeah, I still

02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:54.000
Think it's a dick move

02:45:54.000 --> 02:45:56.000
On Wargaming's part, and this is a bigger

02:45:56.000 --> 02:45:58.000
Issue, for that part

02:45:58.000 --> 02:46:00.000
But really, this guy should have just been

02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:02.000
Professional to begin with

02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:04.000
I think the copyright strike is a bit far

02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:06.000
But this is, at the end of the day, this is all

02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:08.000
Fucking YouTube's problem

02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:10.000
This is a YouTube culture that YouTube's created

02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:12.000
And YouTube's bots have created this problem

02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:14.000
And YouTube refuses to fucking fix it

02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:16.000
Right, and I mean

02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:18.000
Like, I guess what he

02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:20.000
I guess where Wargaming draws the line

02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:22.000
Is that, you know, they're saying

02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:24.000
Quote, you know, there's a level of toxicity

02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:26.000
Under offensive language that is

02:46:26.000 --> 02:46:28.000
Unacceptable, even though they're more than

02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:30.000
Willing to give members of their community

02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:32.000
Second chances, but things like

02:46:32.000 --> 02:46:34.000
The fact that, you know, he's more than

02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:36.000
Welcome to make those types of Wargaming-related

02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:38.000
Videos, but, you know, they're really

02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:40.000
Drawing the line about things like hate

02:46:40.000 --> 02:46:42.000
Speech, homophobic slurs

02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:44.000
Things like that, and the fact that he

02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:46.000
Were, you know, cur-

02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:48.000
Oh, I see, they were trying to curb their extremely

02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:50.000
Profane language of a member

02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:52.000
Of our contributor program

02:46:52.000 --> 02:46:54.000
So, okay, so he used

02:46:54.000 --> 02:46:56.000
Like, homophobic, so he used trash language

02:46:56.000 --> 02:46:58.000
Basically

02:46:58.000 --> 02:47:00.000
Okay, do you

02:47:00.000 --> 02:47:02.000
Here's, this is important, do you know who uses

02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:04.000
Trash language? Trash people

02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:06.000
Okay, so

02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:08.000
Look, here's the thing

02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:10.000
He has a right to say all that shit

02:47:10.000 --> 02:47:12.000
Fine, whatever, but I have a right

02:47:12.000 --> 02:47:14.000
To fucking block his channel

02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:16.000
And I'm not gonna be fucking watching it anytime soon

02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:18.000
At the end of the day, though, I would say

02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:20.000
In light of all that, I would still say

02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:22.000
It's a little bit of an

02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:24.000
Overreach on their

02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:26.000
Part, but I do understand

02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:28.000
It's DLC that's not out yet, so it's

02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:30.000
Kinda like one of those, this

02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:32.000
Gets into very slippery slopes, but this

02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:34.000
Is for YouTube to work out

02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:36.000
With a real fucking human being

02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:38.000
That YouTube probably doesn't have staffed

02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:40.000
Anyway, Zaku

02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:42.000
Zaku, I gotta wrap up and let you go so we can get to other calls

02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:44.000
But thank you, thank you

02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:46.000
For that onion of a story, it was like every time we

02:47:46.000 --> 02:47:48.000
Peeled back, there was another fucking lair

02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:50.000
Alright, as the world turns

02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:52.000
Alright, take care, Zaku

02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:54.000
Bye, alright

02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:56.000
It was good to hear from him, it's been a very long time since we've heard from Zaku

02:47:56.000 --> 02:47:58.000
Let's see if there's any last minute stories

02:47:58.000 --> 02:48:00.000
Real quick, and we'll probably wrap up soon

02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:02.000
But I will take another shot for calls here

02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:04.000
OrangeLawnsRadio on Skype

02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:22.000
So they're not sure where that leaked from

02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:24.000
But it doesn't have any subtitles or anything like that

02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:26.000
It's all in Japanese, but

02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:28.000
Check it out, if you're interested

02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:30.000
Okay

02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:32.000
I got one

02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:34.000
Did you see, they've announced a

02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:36.000
Switch package for Splatoon 2 that's in

02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:38.000
Japan and Europe with different colored Joy-Cons

02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:40.000
Oh yeah, because it was

02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:42.000
All part of that, did they mention the

02:48:42.000 --> 02:48:44.000
Arms director, I know there was the trailer

02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:46.000
It was mentioned in something

02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:48.000
But yes, I did see the additional colors

02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:50.000
And I am really wanting that

02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:52.000
And it hasn't been announced for North America

02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:54.000
And I'm a little upset about that

02:48:54.000 --> 02:48:56.000
Well, it's a good thing the Switch is region free, right?

02:48:56.000 --> 02:48:58.000
Yeah, so that I can import a Switch's Joy-Cons

02:48:58.000 --> 02:49:00.000
Yeah, it would be expensive

02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:02.000
It's an expensive hobby

02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:04.000
I just hope they announce it here

02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:06.000
They probably, E3 is coming right around the corner, they might

02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:08.000
But at the same time, it's like, oh god

02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:10.000
I don't want to get into the territory of buying

02:49:10.000 --> 02:49:12.000
$40 controllers just because they're in different colors

02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:14.000
That's Shane's department, that's not something I want to do

02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:16.000
That's why I'm waiting until they're in different colors

02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:18.000
So they're $80

02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:20.000
A set of two

02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:22.000
So they're $40 each

02:49:22.000 --> 02:49:24.000
Oh my god, no

02:49:24.000 --> 02:49:26.000
And you thought the pro controller was bad at 70

02:49:26.000 --> 02:49:28.000
No!

02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:30.000
That HD rumble got paid that Nintendo price

02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:32.000
I like the all grey

02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:34.000
It matches

02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:36.000
Look, I will admit when I saw the yellow ones

02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:38.000
That they're doing for Arms, I was like, ooh those are pretty

02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:40.000
But $80, nope

02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:42.000
That just shut that off

02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:44.000
That's fine

02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:46.000
They're struggling color joy cons with specific games

02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:48.000
Since they've announced that

02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:50.000
Arms is the yellow, Splatoon is the green

02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:52.000
And Fuchsia, what if they do that?

02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:56.000
Well, do you remember those early rumors

02:49:56.000 --> 02:49:58.000
About the Switch that there may actually be

02:49:58.000 --> 02:50:00.000
Different types of joy cons

02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:02.000
That go in the Switch

02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:04.000
Do you remember some of those early rumors that there might be a GameCube controller

02:50:04.000 --> 02:50:06.000
That they'll use for Smash Brothers?

02:50:06.000 --> 02:50:08.000
That would be fucking interesting

02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:10.000
Having played with the pro controller for a couple months now

02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:12.000
I don't feel like I need

02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:14.000
The GameCube controller for Smash

02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:16.000
I know that

02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:18.000
The Melee community is still going strong

02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:20.000
There are going to be people who are going to stick to it

02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:22.000
But I think for the majority of gamers

02:50:22.000 --> 02:50:24.000
It's not like on the Wii

02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:26.000
Where the classic controller

02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:28.000
Didn't really feel the same

02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:30.000
I think the pro controller can hold up

02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:32.000
Alright, well you know what is getting kind of late

02:50:32.000 --> 02:50:34.000
I'm sorry to those guys who didn't get through on our Skype line

02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:36.000
But we're going to shut it down for the night

02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:38.000
Just so we can wrap up

02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:40.000
Because it's a little bit after 9 o'clock here

02:50:40.000 --> 02:50:42.000
Thank you guys for listening to the show tonight

02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:44.000
I want to thank you guys as always for tuning into

02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:46.000

02:50:46.000 --> 02:50:48.000

Or wherever it is you heard this show

02:50:52.000 --> 02:50:54.000
A nice 5 star review goes a very, very, very long way

02:50:54.000 --> 02:50:56.000
And of course, tell a friend about the show

02:50:56.000 --> 02:50:58.000
This is all about word of mouth

02:50:58.000 --> 02:51:00.000
We don't have a YouTube series

02:51:00.000 --> 02:51:02.000
Or anything like that to promote the show

02:51:02.000 --> 02:51:04.000
We do have a Twitch affiliate channel now

02:51:04.000 --> 02:51:06.000
We're getting there, we're moving on up

02:51:06.000 --> 02:51:08.000
Look out John's Arcade, I'm coming for your subs

02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:10.000
Just kidding, alright

02:51:10.000 --> 02:51:12.000
No, in all seriousness, indie stuff

02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:14.000
No matter where it is

02:51:14.000 --> 02:51:16.000
Really grows thanks to you guys

02:51:16.000 --> 02:51:18.000
So, JD

02:51:18.000 --> 02:51:20.000
Thanks for being here again tonight

02:51:20.000 --> 02:51:22.000
Appreciate it, always nice to have you here

02:51:22.000 --> 02:51:24.000
Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:26.000
All hail Orb

02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:28.000
Alright, there you go

02:51:28.000 --> 02:51:30.000
We'll move around the room here

02:51:30.000 --> 02:51:32.000
Dark Soccer, do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

02:51:32.000 --> 02:51:34.000
I want someone to buy me this camera

02:51:34.000 --> 02:51:36.000
It's a Holga digital camera

02:51:36.000 --> 02:51:38.000
It's like 40 bucks

02:51:38.000 --> 02:51:40.000
Well, you need to start doing some streaming

02:51:40.000 --> 02:51:42.000
And then when you get your biddies, you can buy the camera

02:51:42.000 --> 02:51:44.000
I actually was planning on picking back up

02:51:44.000 --> 02:51:46.000
On the Hot to Full Boyfriend stream

02:51:46.000 --> 02:51:48.000
There you go

02:51:48.000 --> 02:51:50.000
Cause I've got Holiday Star and the other ones

02:51:50.000 --> 02:51:52.000
So, let me know on my Twitters

02:51:52.000 --> 02:51:54.000
Aha, this will make me use my Twitter

02:51:54.000 --> 02:51:56.000
You're gonna use Twitter?

02:51:56.000 --> 02:51:58.000
I'm gonna use Twitter

02:51:58.000 --> 02:52:00.000
You're gonna use my Twatter

02:52:00.000 --> 02:52:02.000
Let me know if you want me to play more Hot to Full Boyfriend

02:52:02.000 --> 02:52:04.000
I want you to play more Hot to Full Boyfriend

02:52:04.000 --> 02:52:06.000
Yay, pigeon dating

02:52:06.000 --> 02:52:08.000
My final thought is

02:52:08.000 --> 02:52:10.000
Obviously I have to say something about

02:52:10.000 --> 02:52:12.000
That my mom

02:52:12.000 --> 02:52:14.000
Has not been doing too well this past week

02:52:14.000 --> 02:52:16.000
And those of you that follow me on Twitter kinda know about that

02:52:16.000 --> 02:52:18.000
And I just appreciate kinda having this show

02:52:18.000 --> 02:52:20.000
As something to take my mind off it

02:52:20.000 --> 02:52:22.000
For a little while, so thank you guys all for being here

02:52:22.000 --> 02:52:24.000
I really, really appreciate it

02:52:24.000 --> 02:52:26.000
And if you didn't see my latest tweet

02:52:26.000 --> 02:52:28.000
I made about an hour ago, I did get a text from my sister

02:52:28.000 --> 02:52:30.000
My mom is doing better

02:52:30.000 --> 02:52:32.000
Things are hopefully improving

02:52:32.000 --> 02:52:34.000
In that department, so thank you guys very much

02:52:34.000 --> 02:52:36.000
Last but not least, Loki, your final thought?

02:52:36.000 --> 02:52:38.000
So, one thing about this

02:52:38.000 --> 02:52:40.000
You know, office space idle clicker game

02:52:40.000 --> 02:52:42.000
Is they have this little event stuff that they do

02:52:42.000 --> 02:52:44.000
Where you earn like these in-game currency type things

02:52:44.000 --> 02:52:46.000
But

02:52:46.000 --> 02:52:48.000
The in-game currency, each one of them gives you

02:52:48.000 --> 02:52:50.000
A 10% bonus, but the bonuses

02:52:50.000 --> 02:52:52.000
That you can also buy with that currency

02:52:52.000 --> 02:52:54.000
Are actually less than if you just didn't spend them

02:52:54.000 --> 02:52:56.000
Which doesn't make any goddamn sense

02:52:56.000 --> 02:52:58.000
So who the fuck programmed this shit because they're a fucking idiot

02:52:58.000 --> 02:53:00.000
That's all I have to say about that

02:53:00.000 --> 02:53:02.000
It's a good thing Loki didn't have a YouTube channel

02:53:02.000 --> 02:53:04.000
Alright

02:53:04.000 --> 02:53:06.000
I do, I just don't post anything on it

02:53:06.000 --> 02:53:08.000
There's a reason, alright, no I'm kidding

02:53:08.000 --> 02:53:10.000
That's gonna do it guys, we will be back in 7 days

02:53:10.000 --> 02:53:12.000
Yes, Memorial Day weekend, we will still be here

02:53:12.000 --> 02:53:14.000
Nobody's going out of town, right?

02:53:14.000 --> 02:53:16.000
I got Memorial Day off

02:53:16.000 --> 02:53:18.000
Congrats!

02:53:18.000 --> 02:53:20.000
You know what this means?

02:53:20.000 --> 02:53:22.000
Vodka!

02:53:22.000 --> 02:53:24.000
V-O-D-C-A-H

02:53:24.000 --> 02:53:26.000
Responsible drinking

02:53:26.000 --> 02:53:28.000
On next week's show

02:53:28.000 --> 02:53:30.000
I still have

02:53:30.000 --> 02:53:32.000
I still have like half the bottle of Stroopwafel

02:53:32.000 --> 02:53:34.000
I was just about to ask

02:53:34.000 --> 02:53:36.000
But I've been known to drink a drink or two

02:53:36.000 --> 02:53:38.000
Alright, that's it, we're done

02:53:38.000 --> 02:53:40.000
We're out of here, have a great night everybody

02:53:40.000 --> 02:53:42.000
We will see you in 7 days, we may or may not

02:53:42.000 --> 02:53:44.000
Be sober

02:53:44.000 --> 02:53:46.000
But if you're operating a vehicle, you damn well better be sober

02:53:46.000 --> 02:53:48.000
Goodnight everybody

02:53:48.000 --> 02:53:50.000
