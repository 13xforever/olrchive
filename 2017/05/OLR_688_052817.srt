00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Regaining those powers of being in public is almost a year after its inception.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Pokemon GO may finally include the original 151 if five choice words are a clue.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
This summer may be legendary, but tonight will be packed with the latest gaming news.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And it all starts right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

Orange Lounge Radio

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It's Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode number 688 for this May the 28th of 2017.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
My name is Rob Roberts, here with you in studio with you guys in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
where we do tape live Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at the Voice Geek Network.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
And right after the Bobby Black Wolf Show, I am joined in studio with DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Oh, hi.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Hi, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. How are you today?

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I've got a shot of rum in me.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Yes, it is a three-day weekend here in the States. As I learned, it's a three-day weekend in lots of places this weekend.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
But here in the States, we're honoring Memorial Day, which is Monday.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So, of course, a moment to remember those who have, you know, passed away.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Died.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Defending our right to free speech and being able to be here and, you know, among many, many other things, of course.

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Well, yes, including the ones who fought for us that we never fought for them.

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Yes. Yes. So, a moment for that. And, you know, that does make things a three-day weekend here in the States.

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Which in America, it means that you sell cars and drink.

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Yes. So, and barbecue.

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And barbecue.

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And travel, usually. We didn't travel, though. We're all here.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I traveled to your place.

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
We may be partaking in a little bit of the alcohol tonight. Which, speaking of which, hi, Tech Master Loki.

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Hello.

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
How are you?

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm fine.

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You're three shots in, aren't you?

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Yes, I am.

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Do you enjoy libations?

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Unfortunately, that is the max I can have in order to be sober by the time the show ends.

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
The three shots are three hours, I understand. But you're feeling pretty good.

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm feeling great now.

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Great. He's ready to roll.

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm ready to do this.

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
We should get him started. So, Nintendo.

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So, what about Nintendo?

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I was going to ask if you tried the test punch, but you can't. You don't own a Switch. So, I don't know.

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
What do you think of ARMS, when you look at that stuff?

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I think it's a game. I mean, I just, I think they're trying to really force it to be like an esports game.

45
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Which, you can't really force that. You have to have it be popular first in order for it to actually be something that people would want to play for esports.

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
But they're like, no, it's esports. It is. Make it esports.

47
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I mean, so it's just, it's a little force. I mean, it looks like a fun game. I just, I don't know. I played esports boxing and it seems kind of similar to that.

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's just, I don't know. Whatever.

49
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's one of those things I feel like I really can't accurately judge until I get my hands on it.

50
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Which is why I'm really excited that they're doing this test punch this weekend.

51
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Except for the fact that, because it's so limited, I have not been able to play it yet.

52
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I've been doing other things each and every time that they had that hour open.

53
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Well, I wasn't going to get up at 5 AM, let's be real. But still, you know, I just, I've been busy.

54
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So I'll do it next weekend. I have more availability next week.

55
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I worry that the game will get boring pretty fast.

56
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Yeah?

57
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I think that it's going to be kind of-

58
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It seems like there's a lot of different modes and things, but you know, I don't know.

59
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It seems like there might be more to it than say Ultra Street Fighter 2.

60
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Which, you know, I have such mixed feelings on that whole thing because I get it.

61
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Street Fighter 2 is such a legendary game. It is, you know, one of the most important video games.

62
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Well, you know what? They should do a crossover with ARMS. They should have Delcime in there.

63
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Anything's possible.

64
00:03:48,000 --> 00:04:00,000
But no, with Ultra Street Fighter 2, it just stings a lot that this isn't that different from the HD remix that came out 10 years ago.

65
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And they're charging $40 for it.

66
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Yep.

67
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And I get the whole fact that it's cartridge and all, but it's just, dudes, you gotta give me something more.

68
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And this whole first person, blah-di-blah, that's not it.

69
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000
That's like that throwaway game that you shoved into a Wii thing because you had to have motion control somewhere in it.

70
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Like, Street Fighter 2 is strong enough to stand on its own, but maybe, you know, it could have been some more characters.

71
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Or it could have been, you know, maybe HD-er, more HD-er.

72
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Or just don't do, or don't necessarily do Street Fighter 2.

73
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Do a different Street Fighter game. Here's a crazy idea.

74
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Come up with a brand new Street Fighter game, but just include characters from the 90s games or something like that.

75
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Oh, hey, we're gonna have, well, maybe not 90s, early 2000s as well.

76
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
So, you know, Street Fighter 2 and 3 characters and some other characters here.

77
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
And it could all be in that Street Fighter 2 style.

78
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I mean, I guess they'd have to do the balancing and stuff, but just get all the 2D characters that they have.

79
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Was there any character, and Jamie, you know these fighting games better than I do.

80
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Maybe Chad knows. Were there any fighters in Street Fighter 2 and 3 who didn't show up in 4 in the numerous expansions?

81
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I mean, by the time they got to the end of Street Fighter 4, that roster was gigantic.

82
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,000
They didn't even just have Street Fighter characters. They had Final Fight characters.

83
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
They had, I mean, they had a lot of different stuff in Street Fighter 4.

84
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'm thinking about it. Did we have Sodom? No, he was there.

85
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Yeah, he was there.

86
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Let's just put it this way, okay?

87
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Juni and Julie.

88
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Elena.

89
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Karin.

90
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Yeah, I feel like they were all there.

91
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
So here's what I want to know. Why they went back to Street Fighter 2...

92
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Dudley.

93
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Didn't Dudley show up? Maybe not.

94
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And Steve.

95
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Why did they go back to Street Fighter 2 when they went, like, they did Street Fighter 4 3D on the 3DS?

96
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I mean, clearly, the Switch should be able to run Street Fighter 4.

97
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Yeah.

98
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Why wouldn't they just do, like, one of those games? I don't understand what the point was.

99
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Well, see, if they'd done Street Fighter 4, then people would be giving them shit because you just did this on the 3DS.

100
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You know, it would kind of be the same line, so I kind of get...

101
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I don't know if they would do that, but, I mean, it's...

102
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Whatever. I just don't think it's justifiable for the $40 points.

103
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Okay, I know what they could have done.

104
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And Capcom has done an awesome job at some of these lately.

105
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
So they did their Mega Man collection, which is cool.

106
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
That Disney morning collection with a lot of games that people love and some that weren't so...

107
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Kill the ROM hex. The Street Fighter ROM hex.

108
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Well, no, but do a 90s fighting game collection.

109
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And do these. They put Street Fighter and Dark Stalkers.

110
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Well, Capcom X-Men's probably going to be a little harder to get all those licenses.

111
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
But at least, you know, those and maybe Capcom SNK?

112
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I don't know what else they could probably pull out.

113
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I mean, they might have to go to, like, Street Fighter EX or something that was a little...

114
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I would love to see a new Capcom SNK game.

115
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Oh my god, I would love a good Street Fighter EX because Skullabania.

116
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
But, I mean, you know, why not at least maybe...

117
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Rival Schools?

118
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Okay, yes, thank you. Rival Schools.

119
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
And put them in the collection and now that's going to justify a lot more of that $40 price tag.

120
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Yeah, I think that's a little bit more worth it.

121
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Or just not even maybe necessarily all fighting.

122
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You can just do a 90s arcade collection.

123
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Sure. Oh man, Capcom had some killer arcade games in the 90s.

124
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Y'all know I love Quiz and Dragons and it's 90s-riffic.

125
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Although, Capcom did do an arcade collection on PS3, I think.

126
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Because I seem to remember, yeah, I seem to remember they had, like, different packs in that.

127
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And I think it's on...

128
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
What's PlayStation's streaming service? The PlayStation Now thing.

129
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You can actually play it through that right now.

130
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
So they had, like, five different packs.

131
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
But I don't think Street Fighter was in there.

132
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It was more, they went a little more, I don't want to say the B-cuts, because it did have, like, ghosts and goblins.

133
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You know, some of those, you know, classics.

134
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
But there were a lot, it was a lot of B-cuts for filler stuff.

135
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I just think that a lot of this price point stuff has to do with the fact that all the other games are kind of that price point.

136
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
And it's like, well, we could make our game cheaper, but what else are you going to buy?

137
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Because they're all $40 or $60.

138
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Nah.

139
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I mean, like, Minecraft. I mean, come on.

140
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Minecraft, I get it. It's Minecraft and they've charged, you know, quite a bit of money on all the different console versions.

141
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
But, dude, it's been out forever on all the other platforms.

142
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
And I hear people say, well, it's because the Mario DLC's in there.

143
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
The Mario DLC was free, by the way, for the Wii U version.

144
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I've never picked up a DLC pack.

145
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Okay, but that was to justify people buying the Wii U version years after 360 and PlayStation 3 had it.

146
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Well, this is years after the Wii U version, so what do we have to say about that?

147
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Well, no, that's true. Well, the fact that it is portable and console.

148
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,000
If you think about it, this is the first time that the portable version has been so rich, if that makes sense.

149
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Well, if I wanted a portable console version, I could get the Vita version and play it on my PlayStation TV and play it on my Vita.

150
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Alright, fair enough. I forgot about the Vita version. I forgot they released it on the Vita. Fair enough.

151
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I think a lot of people forget about the Vita.

152
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Well, a lot of people forgot about their Vita, period.

153
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Yeah, they'll have a Vita? What's this?

154
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
That's on Sony. I mean, the Vita's still healthy in Japan.

155
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I honestly mean, the Vita is maybe just a little bit before it's time.

156
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Because look at how well the Switch is doing. I mean, how hard would it be for them to adapt the kind of Switch-like platform for the Vita?

157
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Not to keep going tangent to tangent.

158
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Sorry.

159
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
No, no, no. It's good.

160
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Oh, I forgot what I was going to ask. I should have started drinking for the show.

161
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Something about the Vita. Oh, this whole PlayStation VR and the way Sony supports hardware.

162
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I was just having this conversation the other day that I kind of want to get a PlayStation VR because I think the 3D Blu-ray thing is really awesome that you can do.

163
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I haven't done that yet.

164
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I want Rez. I want Thumper. You know, there's a fair amount of games.

165
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,000
But I'm worried about what does the next year look like for PlayStation VR?

166
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm a little worried Sony's going to abandon it like they do most of their hardware stuff.

167
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I don't think they're going to abandon it, but we don't know a whole lot of stuff what's coming out.

168
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Yeah, there's no real big AAA games on the horizon that have been announced yet.

169
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Now E3 is in two weeks, so that could change everything. I get that.

170
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I think it's a pretty strong platform. I'm worried that they're going to do a hardware revision before anything.

171
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,000
But it's fun. It's just right now it's being driven mostly by indies.

172
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I mean, really the biggest AAA title they have on there I would say is probably Resident Evil.

173
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
That's more the most fully featured game. And then Farpoint is another one that's kind of...

174
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I don't know if that's more of an indie game, or at least the developer.

175
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'm not sure if it's a AAA developer, but they're backing that with its own peripheral and stuff.

176
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
So obviously that's a pretty big deal.

177
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,000
And in fact Bobby kind of echoes that in chat, pointing out Farpoint and Star Trek Bridge Crew as well as being pushed.

178
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I'm a little worried about the Bridge Crew game.

179
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I don't know. I mean, that's Ubisoft. Ubisoft likes to say everything is big, just like a stupid eagle flight game and all that.

180
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I'll try it. I mean, don't get me wrong.

181
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I mean, that's fine. But I think even with what's on the platform right now, there's a lot of good stuff on there.

182
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
There's also a lot of crap, because there are people that will produce like,

183
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
oh hey, I really want a rollercoaster game on the PlayStation VR.

184
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Then they made a rollercoaster game and it's just absolute shit.

185
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
And so you just have to be careful. But there is a lot of good stuff out there.

186
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Let me get some of these other comments in chat where I'm going back a little bit.

187
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Dar Tetsuya talking about the price of Street Fighter, saying,

188
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
If I had to switch, I'd probably wait till Holiday. 40 is a bit much, but 20 to 30 wouldn't be as bad.

189
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
At least what I hear the online is actually good at it.

190
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Act F pointing out that Dudley did appear in Street Fighter IV.

191
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Sorry, in all honesty, it's been a long time since I've played Street Fighter IV and I just don't remember.

192
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It starts to blur together after a while, but thank you for pointing that out.

193
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Orange Wright points out though that R. Mika isn't in Street Fighter IV.

194
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
So, Street Fighter IV didn't have everybody.

195
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Rama pointing out that the license expired on rival schools, so that could be why.

196
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
But it's not that licenses can't ever be renewed for these types of things either.

197
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I mean, you know, we have a new Marvel vs. Capcom game coming out, although it may not have X-Men in it.

198
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
We'll find out, but you know, whatever. I mean, these things can be figured out.

199
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
The Disney collection is going to be a bunch of licenses, right?

200
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
They got that out, so, you know, anything's possible.

201
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Yeah.

202
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Well, and also if you look at even the character roster that they have for the new LEGO Marvel game,

203
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
it's quite interesting because it's not really focused on the Avengers this time, it's Guardians of the Galaxy.

204
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And so they've got some other stuff in there. They have Spider-Man 2099, Spider-Gwen or whatever.

205
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:44,000
So, I mean, imagine those type of characters in, like, a Marvel vs. Capcom game. That'd be pretty cool.

206
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Two tangents from that. This is a tangent edition of Marvel.

207
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Sorry, it's the alcohol.

208
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
No, I love it. It's my fault. Okay, so, uh, Guardians of the Galaxy.

209
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Dar Sagar, did you hear the ride open to Disneyland at five hour wait times?

210
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Yeah, I know. I'm iffy on it. I mean, it's one of those things where I can't change it.

211
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It's done, what's done is done, so, you know, maybe it'll be a decent ride, you know, that lives up to the twilight.

212
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
See, now, would you feel so terrible about it if they replaced it with a Tron ride?

213
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Oh, god, no. No, I would've been like, Twilight Zone, thank you. You know, your monumental franchise, what you did was important,

214
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
and I hope they leave a piece of you in Disneyland, but make way, bulldozers. Let's go, let's go, Tron. Tron time.

215
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Ironically, Electronica used to surround the Tower of Terror, so it was kind of like you had this odd...

216
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
No.

217
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Kinda.

218
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It was over by Monsters, Inc.

219
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
But that's, like, right next to each other.

220
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
No, Tower of Terror was further down the road.

221
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
But remember, Electronica kind of spilled out that way because they had all the venues.

222
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:53,000
But it didn't go as far as over there, it was only right in front of where the Aladdin Theater was, and the Monsters, Inc. ride over in that corner where the arcade was on the back wall.

223
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
But the Aladdin Theater is next door to Twilight Tower of Terror.

224
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
No, it's not. Well, the whole, it's a big building, but the entrance to it is quite a walk away from it.

225
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Okay.

226
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Visual memories kicking in.

227
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I just, I thought it kind of spilled over that way a little bit. I mean, it wasn't like it took over the Tower of Terror, but anyway.

228
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:19,000
So that was one thing. The other thing I wanted to say, because you brought up Marvel, one of the things I am looking forward to at E3 is, what's this whole Square Enix Marvel game?

229
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Yes.

230
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Because I imagine we're going to see more of that.

231
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I'm down with whatever it is.

232
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:33,000
And, you know, seeing that this is probably going to be, I guess, have similarities to Tomb Raider just based on where it's coming from, from Square Enix.

233
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Or, let's imagine a fighting system with a Marvel character that's like Final Fantasy XV.

234
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Uh-huh.

235
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Yeah, I'd be on board with that.

236
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Bobby Blackwolf says, the Square Enix Marvel game is Kingdom Hearts 3. That's why we haven't heard anything about it.

237
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I'm...

238
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
We have heard about it.

239
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:55,000
You know, I'm, the problem with Kingdom Hearts 3, like for me, like, is I never really played through the original Kingdom Hearts, and now I don't even know where to begin.

240
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I know they have all the collections, but my God, it's like so much content in there.

241
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:05,000
And the story is just so convoluted that I don't know if I'd be able to enjoy the game to the fullest extent if I don't understand what the hell...

242
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
And I don't know who any of these characters are, so we're okay.

243
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
No Sora's in there somewhere.

244
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I mean, I don't know what the fuck has happened throughout all this.

245
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Well, did you hear this week that they have delayed Kingdom Hearts 3 and the Final Fantasy VII remake again anyway?

246
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Shock and awe.

247
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I know.

248
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Well, I mean, well, I shouldn't say they delayed because they never really got a date announced, but they're just basically saying, y'all need to temper your expectations going into E3 because these games aren't being, like, they're not coming out this year, so sit down.

249
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
It's eventual.

250
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Yeah, they'll be out when they're damn good and ready, which I respect that, you know, we have to respect that there's games that have needed to be delayed that didn't, so we need to stop treating game delays as like bad news.

251
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:53,000
But at the same time, we need to stop hyping the fuck out of these early release dates when they never, game companies never hit them.

252
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
But anyway, I digress.

253
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I'd be curious what Square Enix is going to be focusing on at E3 if these two games are not coming, and maybe this Marvel thing, although I thought this was really early on still, and I wasn't pegging this as something that would be this year, but I suppose you never know.

254
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:21,000
But I figured Dragon Quest XI could be the game that's, you know, maybe they're going to really push for Dragon Quest XI this year to be something that's big in the US, too.

255
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I mean, Dragon Quest has always had a fandom in the US, it just hasn't been on the same level as Final Fantasy, but, you know, Square Enix has had enough faith to put out Dragon Quest Heroes and, you know, some of these side things.

256
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:43,000
The Builders game was a surprising amount of fun, you know, they've been trying to build up the Dragon Quest stuff a little bit to maybe get people hyped a little more about XI, who knows.

257
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:53,000
So, alright. Anyway, let's get into the kickoff topic I had scheduled after we have 20 minutes of tangents. No, it's fine. It's going to be one of those shows tonight, it's fine.

258
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I want to talk about this article that's going around about Nintendo's Summer of Play Tour. Nintendo's going to be taking a Play Nintendo event around to showcase games to the public.

259
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:14,000
And I'm assuming this is probably a little miniature version of their E3 booth that they're going to take around the country, and this is what they're doing instead of a Best Buy type thing this year.

260
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Including, let me see if I can get some dates here. So, Irvine from June 9th to 11th at the Irvine Spectrum. Well, that's now, that's like right concurrent with E3, isn't it? 9th through 11th?

261
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Yeah, that's right, that's right, the same weekend because Bethesda's thing is the 10th. So, that's where it's going to start, is the same area, Irvine, right?

262
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Then it moves to Pleasanton and moves on into Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Arizona, more Southern California, no Northern California, but it's going to be traveling around the country from June to September.

263
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Pleasanton's sort of Northern California.

264
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Yeah, but not here. No, I guess Alameda County Fair is close enough, I guess, but still, it seems like such a drive.

265
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Anyway, but anyway, it's going to be in Chicago and Brooklyn and Pennsylvania, but all these places. So, it's traveling around the country, and I'm sure there will be people that will travel, you know, hours and hours to check this thing out.

266
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I mean, you know, if we do want to go to Pleasanton, we could drive for a few hours and go check this out. I don't, I don't know if I will. It depends what games are showing.

267
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Depends what they're showing, but I don't know if I will because I'm just the type that's like, I'll just be patient and wait for the games to actually release during the holiday or whatever.

268
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:39,000
But I'm curious, since the Memorial Day weekend is a time for traveling, and it is a time we go out and everywhere and so forth, what's like the furthest that you've traveled to play video games or play a video game?

269
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:46,000
And I put this out to the chat room as well. What types of traveling have you done to play video games?

270
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Well, I'd say the furthest that I've traveled to play video games have been going to Sunnyvale to play like the Bomani games. I mean, that's pretty much it.

271
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Yeah, we used to do a lot of that back in the day.

272
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I went to San Diego to play, uh, crap. What was the first DDR that brought in the freeze arrows?

273
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Max?

274
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Max, yeah. I had already planned on going to San Diego and I added that to my trip where, of course, I've played DDR in Pensacola.

275
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Yeah, um, you know, back in those music game days, trips to LA to go to Arcade Infinity to play Beatmania 2DX and the things they had were not uncommon at all.

276
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:39,000
So, man, we used to do those types of trips all the time in the Bay Area. I'm still doing that now with these round one trips. I was just at round one on Saturday because I happened to be in San Jose, so we stopped by there.

277
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:46,000
So, uh, yeah, so, I mean, those trips are not completely unheard of anymore. Looking at chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

278
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Let's see, Bobby Blackwolf says, I traveled to Tokyo to play the arcade games. I mean, I was also visiting my friend.

279
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:05,000
But Bobby says, if you want to restrict it to just to play video games and not take part in a bigger thing, I traveled to Dance Beat Arcade in Nashville a couple times just to visit the arcade and that's a four hour drive.

280
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Yeah, I was looking at when I go to the East Coast, like, is it possible that I could get out to Fun Spot, but I just don't think I can swing it. It's just too far out of the way.

281
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:19,000
But it's one of those things I considered because, you know, it is a little piece of gaming history out there and so forth.

282
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Yeah, I mean, I've traveled a lot. I mean, I could say, well, I went to Washington, D.C. to go to MAGFest and play games, but that's kind of, I didn't really go there.

283
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Well, we went to E3.

284
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Yeah, I didn't really just go there to play games.

285
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
We went to E3 to play video games.

286
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Yeah, the conventions thing's a little outside what I was looking for here, maybe.

287
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,000
But did you ever go to, like, a preview event that you had to drive aways to get to, like these Nintendo things?

288
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Didn't you go to the State Fair to play Rock Band one year?

289
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:52,000
No, I didn't go to the State Fair. I went to this, it was an event that they had at, I don't even know what it was exactly.

290
00:20:52,000 --> 00:21:01,000
It was some event that they had out front of the, what was it, the Sacramento River Cats stadium.

291
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,000
So they had, like, I don't even know what it was, like some music festival thing.

292
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
And they had Rock Band set up there and I played it there.

293
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
But I don't think I necessarily went there just for that.

294
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I went with, I don't even remember why I went there.

295
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
But yeah, it was one of the things I checked out while I was there.

296
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Bobby Black Wolf says, I drove to Orlando to see video games live. That was an eight hour drive.

297
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Didn't we go to San Jose for...

298
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I don't think I went to San Jose with you guys. I went to San Francisco once for one of those.

299
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:39,000
But I remember going to LA to go to Dear Friends and More Friends. However, those were during E3.

300
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
But I would have still gone just for those shows.

301
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
We went to Great America just to play Planet Harrier.

302
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
We used to go to San Francisco, was it, for the Konami press events?

303
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Yeah, yeah. We went to Great America to do the...

304
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I didn't go.

305
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I know you didn't go, but you reminded me of that. The Mass Effect ride.

306
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I should go.

307
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
It's okay.

308
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
So?

309
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
You can see the review over at VOG Network's YouTube.

310
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I should still go and see if they have the Planet Harrier still.

311
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I don't remember seeing one. I remember doing a weird...

312
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I don't know if, I think it's like a bonus clip at the end of the YouTube that we did.

313
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
But I remember shooting a lot of, like, when I sent all these videos to Bobby that we shot at Great America.

314
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I was like, Bobby, I took a lot of B-roll.

315
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I was like, you're going to have to sit through some bullshit that I took for this video.

316
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
And I remember some of it was like this arcade.

317
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
And I don't think I remember seeing a Planet Harrier there.

318
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
But I think I was pointing out one of the stupid prizes they had available in the arcade.

319
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Like, there was some really tacky shit that they were giving away in the arcade.

320
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:47,000
We did drive, like, in San Jose across, you know, several freeways to go to round one.

321
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Oh, yeah. Well, round one's kind of out there in San Jose.

322
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Yeah, driving anywhere in the Bay Area is kind of like...

323
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Depends on when you do it.

324
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Yeah.

325
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Yeah.

326
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
And, oh, here's, okay, you want to hear this one? Video game related things? You ready?

327
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
So I drove to Oakland to see video games live.

328
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Not the eight-hour trip that Bobby took, but it was like a 90-minute drive for me.

329
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
So I went to video games live with Grandpa from Hoard House.

330
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
This is when, like, Grandpa and I were first friends and another mutual friend of ours.

331
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
So here's how everything works.

332
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:25,000
So at video games live in Oakland, I saw and I ran into, while I was with Grandpa from Hoard House,

333
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I ran into Captain Spike from GameBooey.org, who is talking to another friend of his.

334
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
And he said, oh, Rob, I think you guys have been friends on LiveJournal for a long time.

335
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Have you ever met Allen?

336
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,000
And that was the first time I ever met Allen in person was at video games live.

337
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I don't know if anybody, everybody here knows that.

338
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I probably, I can't imagine I wouldn't have told that before, but I met...

339
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Apart from camp.

340
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I met Allen, well, now you had to throw that out there.

341
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Fine. It's one of those nights, a three-day weekend.

342
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
So Allen and I were in the same youth organization when we were 15 years old.

343
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
He was in a Bay Area part of it and I was in Sacramento part of it.

344
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
And we both went to leadership camp.

345
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
The same, we know we were there the same year because we have similar memories,

346
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
but we don't remember meeting each other.

347
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
But only like 40 kids went to this camp.

348
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:16,000
So Allen and I probably met each other when we were teenagers, like 15, 16, but we don't remember it.

349
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Like, you know, but we're convinced there's a picture out there of all the kids at this event

350
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
that is probably in my parents' house somewhere that we have yet to find.

351
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
So, but that's just funny.

352
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Yes, Dark Soccer, you're right. We would have met at camp, technically,

353
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
but then we didn't really meet in person until that video game's live event.

354
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
That time at leadership camp?

355
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Exactly, right?

356
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
There it goes.

357
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Alright, yeah, MXC says, I like this story.

358
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I like that story, too. Thank you very much.

359
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Alright.

360
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
So, a little bit about traveling for video games.

361
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Good times. Hope you guys are being safe if you're traveling this weekend.

362
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Or playing some games, if you're playing games at home, this is a great time to do it as well.

363
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Let's talk about what types of video games you've been playing this week.

364
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I have not really drank anything yet.

365
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I've had the tiniest sip of this vodka that you made.

366
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
You didn't make the vodka, but you infused it.

367
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Right, and when I do an infusion, I do potato vodka.

368
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Okay.

369
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Because, honestly, I like the flavor of potato vodka better.

370
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
I like potatoes.

371
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Do you french fry your vodka?

372
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
No, but real vodka is made with potatoes.

373
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Yeah, I know.

374
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:28,000
So, um, I did one that I infused with, uh, um, great, now I can't, crystallized ginger.

375
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Ginger was one, yeah.

376
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Crystallized ginger.

377
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
So, candy ginger.

378
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I did another one that is made with Parma violets, which our UK buddies should know.

379
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Um, they're like the little sweet, sweeties, smarties things that we have over here.

380
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Oh, okay.

381
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Except they're violet flavored.

382
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
We need to do a maple bacon infused vodka.

383
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I will do that.

384
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I'm just curious to see how that would either be really good or really horrible.

385
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I have both maple, real maple syrup and bacon at my house.

386
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I can't imagine they don't actually, I mean, I know it's not going to be as good as something

387
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,000
that you make, but, like, I can't imagine that with all the bacon mania in this country,

388
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
there isn't, like, an over-the-counter...

389
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
See, the problem with, like, today, I was trying to get vanilla vodka, but they only

390
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
had, like, they had vanilla vodka.

391
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
It was, like, $30 for a bottle.

392
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Where did you go?

393
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I went with a Raley's.

394
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Like, crappy grocery store.

395
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Do the Bevmo.

396
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
I know, I didn't have time to go to Bevmo.

397
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I would have gone to Bevmo, because Bevmo, the last time I went there, I think the bottle

398
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
of vodka was, like, 12 bucks.

399
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Yeah.

400
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
You know, like, for vanilla vodka.

401
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
It was, like, Raley's, they're like, oh, yeah, it's $30 for just vodka.

402
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Wait, wait, wait, we're giving them free commercial space here.

403
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Bevmo's smell really bad.

404
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I'm just kidding.

405
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I made that up, but they shouldn't get free advertising.

406
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,000
But, um, but, um, the other one I brought back just for you.

407
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Yeah?

408
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Candy corn.

409
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I love the candy corn one, but the ginger one's really good.

410
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
It's strong.

411
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
It is.

412
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,720
But I can drink that ginger beer.

413
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:53,360
The first taste of it, it burns, and then it turns into this sweet.

414
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:58,640
So it starts off with that ginger bite, and then fades into something really sweet.

415
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,120
But now that you said, like, root beer, I'm like, oh, man, that would have been amazing

416
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,120
mixing that root beer.

417
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,120
Someone bring us root beer.

418
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,520
But I'm gonna try, what soda should I mix that with?

419
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,520
Is that just Sprite, or do you think I should do Dr. Pepper?

420
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:11,680
I did bring Diet Beverage, and I brought Dr. Pepper, and Sprite, and Diet Mountain Dew.

421
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:15,800
All right, I'm gonna try mixing the ginger with something, and that's gonna be my first

422
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,440
one with Sprite, because then it would come out kind of ginger ale-y.

423
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,440
All right.

424
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,360
Anyway, before we were talking about liquor, we were, and again, I'm just gonna warn y'all,

425
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,520
if this is your first Orange Lounge Radio.

426
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,680
This ain't our first drunk show.

427
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:30,820
If this is your first episode of Orange Lounge Radio, thank you so much for taking us out.

428
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:31,820
Really do appreciate it.

429
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:35,640
You know, we've been doing this for 15 years, uh, dark soccer, Logie and I have been kicking

430
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:40,640
it ever since we all first met playing DDR, but, um, this is just gonna be a crazy show

431
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,640
tonight.

432
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,880
I haven't drank that much.

433
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,480
Not just because of the liquor, but just because of the fact it's like a three-day weekend.

434
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,800
There hasn't been a ton of news, because E3 is coming up, so I'm just, I'm just saying.

435
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:56,120
Don't judge the entirety of OOLR based on this random fucking tangent episode.

436
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:59,600
Then again, some of our longtime listeners, they love this shit the most, so we do it

437
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,600
for you.

438
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:04,240
See, if I had, like, nowhere to drive to, then I would have had a lot more than what

439
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,520
I had, but unfortunately, you gotta...

440
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:09,960
Nothing's gonna talk, no, we're never gonna get, and yes, always drink responsibly, that's

441
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,960
very important.

442
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,760
Great caution to make sure we're not gonna drive drunk or any of that stuff.

443
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:18,000
But, uh, the other, I mean, nothing is ever gonna top that episode when you and I lived

444
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,400
together and I, I don't even remember what happened, Jamie ate all my waffles and then

445
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,400
passed out in my bed.

446
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,480
No, those were Matt's waffles.

447
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,480
This was during...

448
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,360
Because I paid you back for your waffles three years later.

449
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,360
I don't remember.

450
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,880
And this was not something that happened, like, before the show, this happened during

451
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:36,320
the show and I was, like, kicking the wall, yelling, I'm in the matrix, I'm in the matrix.

452
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:41,280
I don't remember what Loki was doing, but I think you were, like, deep frying bacon

453
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,280
or something.

454
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,280
Oh, I was super bacon, probably.

455
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,760
Should you be operating a deep fryer when you're toxic?

456
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,760
No, I wasn't deep frying bacon, it's microwaved.

457
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,760
Oh, okay.

458
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,160
I remember that you had the deep fryer and you made cornflake coated rice balls.

459
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,160
I used to do that.

460
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,160
That was good.

461
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:56,760
My wife still doesn't let me buy it, like, you know, a deep fryer, I'm like, I keep saying

462
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,760
that, should I get a deep fryer?

463
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,760
I need one to make falafel.

464
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,760
Deep fryer, deep fryer.

465
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,600
But, um, yeah, she wouldn't let me do that, and yes, because, you know, bacon is so healthy

466
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:08,160
by itself, I figured that it just needed more salt and pepper and whatever else I'd

467
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,160
sprinkle on it.

468
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,860
So, yeah, it's extra salty, extra peppery bacon.

469
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:12,860
Extra heart attacky.

470
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:13,860
Extra heart attacky.

471
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:17,160
It's like, oh, this is poison as it is, now it's really gonna kill you.

472
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:21,840
Act Def points out in our chat over at live.vognotework.com, there's always that disclosure for the drunk

473
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,840
shows.

474
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:28,280
Well, it's important, you know, it's okay to get stupid, just don't be stupid about

475
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,280
it.

476
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:38,200
I am sticking to my carefully crafted beverage of Diet Pepsi and Kraken.

477
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,080
I used up less of my Kraken and I kind of wish I bought some more.

478
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,400
I honestly don't feel it anymore, really, to be honest.

479
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,400
I love Kraken.

480
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,360
It makes every soda taste like oatmeal cookies.

481
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,360
All right.

482
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,360
Seriously, it's amazing.

483
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:52,320
Why would you want to make things tasting like oatmeal cookies?

484
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,320
Oatmeal cookies are great.

485
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:56,080
It's raisins that ruin oatmeal cookies.

486
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,080
That's true, raisins ruin everything.

487
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,080
All right.

488
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,080
Hello.

489
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:02,680
Yes, I know we're going to wait one quick tangent.

490
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,240
The grocery store near us.

491
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,400
It's like a cruel joke.

492
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:09,720
They put their stupid chocolate chip bagels next to their oatmeal raisin bagels.

493
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,640
I'm like, how evil is that?

494
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,640
Why would you do that?

495
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,640
I mean, they look exactly the same.

496
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,000
You put it next to each other.

497
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,600
Raisins are the enemy of Orange Lounge Radio.

498
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:22,320
Wait a minute.

499
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,640
Raisins are okay.

500
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,760
No, they're not.

501
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,760
They suck.

502
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:31,640
They're the evil Soviet spies of the condiment world.

503
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,640
They're not evil.

504
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,040
It's just I don't like if I'm going into it expecting chocolate chips and I bite into

505
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,680
a raisin, I'm going to be disappointed.

506
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,080
That's just really what it is.

507
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,080
Yeah.

508
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,080
No, I agree.

509
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,080
That's fucked up.

510
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,720
That if like you think like, oh, yummy, this chocolate chip cookie.

511
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,720
I'm so excited.

512
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,200
And you bite into it, it's fucking raisin and oatmeal.

513
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,760
I actually just hate raisins for real.

514
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,240
Who fucking did that?

515
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,240
Who did that?

516
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,240
Like, I'm okay.

517
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,240
I'm okay with that.

518
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,720
Raisins are great salad.

519
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,720
I have two things that I super hate.

520
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,720
You know what's better than raisins?

521
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,720
Crazins.

522
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:04,160
Okay, I can eat those because dried cranberries are good, but raisins are just like failed

523
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:07,480
grapes.

524
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,680
But I hate raisins and I hate marshmallows.

525
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:13,680
Well, Dark Tetsuya answered your question in chat over at live.voguenetwork.com.

526
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,920
Who would put those bagels next to each other?

527
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:18,040
He says some people just want to watch the world burn.

528
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:21,760
In this case, would it be some people just want to watch the bagels toast?

529
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,760
I guess.

530
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,080
I actually don't even like raisinets.

531
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:29,200
Not even chocolate can remove the hatred that, you know, and the only way I like marshmallows

532
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,800
is when they're on fire.

533
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,800
True.

534
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,800
I hate s'mores actually.

535
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,600
But I like Chris Crispy treats.

536
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,600
Wow.

537
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,280
I heart Rob Roberts in chat.

538
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,280
What a pleasant name.

539
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:43,360
Says, I don't hate raisins, but I also wouldn't go out of my way to defend them.

540
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,360
Thank you.

541
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,360
All right, look.

542
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,360
Hey, so my gaming week.

543
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,360
Yes.

544
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:52,520
I was like, this discussion is important.

545
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,620
Chocolate chip bagels and raisin bagels.

546
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,160
This shit needs to stop.

547
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:58,460
Go make your drink, Rob.

548
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:59,740
Bye.

549
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:04,340
So we've been watching a lot of YouTube at my house, but namely I have had this weird

550
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:08,100
kick for some reason to watch Injustice 2 videos.

551
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:14,100
Me, the person who does not like DC, has been kind of obsessed now with watching the character

552
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,840
interactions in Injustice 2.

553
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:20,040
So as a result, Dan said, you know what, let's just get the first game.

554
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,040
So he bought it.

555
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,680
Our game just arrived and we're going to be playing it soon.

556
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:29,480
And I like the voice acting and it's actually kind of fun because I'd played it for a little

557
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,840
bit before, but I was like, eh, DC, whatever the fuck.

558
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,080
He didn't have it in his game library because that was one of the free games that they had

559
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,080
in PlayStation Plus.

560
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,360
I don't think he even bothered.

561
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:44,600
So on top of that, it was cheap anyway for the ultimate whatever version.

562
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,480
We paid like 15 bucks for it, so it wasn't terrible.

563
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:51,260
And if we like it, we're going to get Injustice 2.

564
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:56,720
And it's all because of Green Arrow, really Green Arrow, because everyone else, I don't

565
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,200
care, but it's voiced by my man.

566
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:04,160
So I'm happy, although I have been going through like watching that and then looking up voice

567
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,280
actors going, I know that voice.

568
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:15,560
And so anyway, so also I have been playing World of Warcraft and I hit my first prestige

569
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:19,160
rep thing.

570
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:23,880
And apparently once you hit it, then you can refill it and you get like goodies for maxing

571
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,320
out your exalted rep again.

572
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,200
And it's kind of cool.

573
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,800
And yes, I know Kevin Conroy is Batman.

574
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:40,620
And then I have also been playing Miitomo and playing Pokemon Go.

575
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:44,840
I am behind on leveling, but whatever.

576
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:52,820
So we got, well Dan managed to get the Judge Dredd working so, and we have the Dead World

577
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:53,820
mod in it.

578
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:59,960
So for people who don't know this about the Judge Dredd pinball is that there is a spinning

579
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:03,880
thing in it that has these cutouts and it takes the, what?

580
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,880
I'm going to interrupt.

581
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,880
Sorry.

582
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,880
You have to try this.

583
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,880
It's really good.

584
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,880
No, guys, y'all, this is so important.

585
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,880
This is so important.

586
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,620
This ginger vodka she made mixed with the seven up.

587
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:12,620
This is amazing.

588
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:13,620
Hot.

589
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:14,620
Damn.

590
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:15,620
Yeah.

591
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:16,620
Right.

592
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:17,620
That's not really good.

593
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:18,620
Do you like ginger?

594
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:19,620
Loki?

595
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:21,340
No, I don't think that's a good idea.

596
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:22,340
Being that I'm sick.

597
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:23,340
Oh yeah.

598
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:24,340
That's right.

599
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:25,340
Yeah.

600
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,340
Don't drink from the glass.

601
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:27,340
Nevermind.

602
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,340
But alcohol is, it kills things.

603
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,340
This is true.

604
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,340
We can't argue that logic.

605
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,340
I can get you a straw.

606
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,340
All right.

607
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:35,580
Anyways, so sorry to interrupt the video game chat, but you know what?

608
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:36,700
I'll fucking warned you.

609
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:42,860
So anyway, so the Dead World on the Judge Dredd has these like little places that the

610
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:47,900
ball will jump into and then the ball will fall out of it as it moves.

611
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:52,940
Well, the original intent of it was that these little areas were closed off and that it locks

612
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,920
the ball in these different holes.

613
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:59,680
And there's a crane that has full functionality, but because they removed the way the Dead

614
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,160
World functioned, that crane is there and doesn't do anything.

615
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:12,080
So there's like a mod that came out to restore the Judge Dredd table to, shut up, Brad.

616
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:19,920
He said balls, holes, but anyway, it restored that original gameplay to the Judge Dredd

617
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,560
and it's really a lot of fun and it makes multiball a fucking bitch.

618
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:29,200
You've got all the balls going and they drop them and it's just so cool.

619
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,620
It is really neat.

620
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:35,540
The crane will just look up Dead World mod on Judge Dredd and you'll see what I'm talking

621
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:36,540
about.

622
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:37,540
It's totally awesome.

623
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:41,980
And then, um, I don't remember, so I guess I'm done.

624
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:44,220
All right, then we'll go over to Loki.

625
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,220
How was your gaming week?

626
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:49,440
Um, I played a few things this week, so I finally picked up Overwatch because now they

627
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,920
have that game of the year edition.

628
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,140
So I picked that up.

629
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:55,940
I, I didn't get to play a long time because I was home with my son.

630
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:58,820
He was sick with a cold, which now I have caught.

631
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:06,420
Um, so I was able to play a few rounds against AI and so I did that and that was all right.

632
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:10,100
Um, maybe I got the level up to three, which is nothing.

633
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:13,420
Um, but I like it so far.

634
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:19,260
And then I played more Grand Theft Auto five on PC and just going through the single player

635
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,260
game.

636
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,260
I'm having a lot of fun.

637
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,260
That looks fantastic.

638
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:27,180
Um, I played a little bit of, what did I play on the, there was something I played on the

639
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:30,340
PlayStation cause I had, what was it?

640
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:31,340
Oh no, no, no.

641
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:32,340
I didn't play them.

642
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:39,580
I had bought, um, they have a, uh, bacon frame theme for your PlayStation four.

643
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:41,540
So I have that now in my back.

644
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:44,020
How do people, I, okay, we need to talk about this for a minute.

645
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:45,200
This is important.

646
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:50,440
There is so much like garbage themes and stuff on PlayStation four, like all these throwaway

647
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,440
themes.

648
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,440
Like how do I, how do I get in on that?

649
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:59,000
Like I feel like VOG could make a lot of money if we just like, you know, joined forces with

650
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:07,600
a photographer and a graphic artist and like made some of these cheap themes on PlayStation

651
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,480
four because there's, there's a million of them.

652
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,280
I mean, go look on the store plays.

653
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,280
There's a million of them.

654
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,280
I don't know how that works at all.

655
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,720
Like obviously the photos would need to be original, which I said we need to team up

656
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,600
with a photographer who could take some original photos that we would have the rights to.

657
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:26,560
You know, it's like, my God, there's so much stuff out there.

658
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:31,280
Just get some cats, take some, I'm sure there's already cat themes out there, but what's,

659
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,720
what's wrong with more cat themes?

660
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,900
We'll take some pictures of cats and just, you know, have a little meow theme.

661
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:42,160
And then we do pictures of puppies and just all the animals.

662
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,120
I mean, yeah, I don't know how you get in with that.

663
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:49,240
If you have to, if it's the same kind of pathway that they have for like game developers, because

664
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,280
I know some of those themes are a little bit more interactive as far as like how you set

665
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:57,360
them up, but I can't imagine that it's all just necessarily, you know, game programming

666
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,360
stuff.

667
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:01,440
It's probably, I don't know, HTML stuff or whatever.

668
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,520
So yeah, I got that.

669
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,680
It's silly.

670
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,800
And then what else?

671
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:13,760
I didn't necessarily play this yet, but I picked up, cause I had back did a while ago,

672
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,080
we happy few, but I never got my key for it.

673
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,480
I'm like, well shit, you know, I can play it now.

674
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,520
I probably should get my key for it.

675
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:25,040
So I emailed them like, Hey, I don't believe you sent me a key for this.

676
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,080
And I think they did, but I may have deleted it.

677
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,080
And so they sent me a new one.

678
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,080
I got that.

679
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:33,440
But yeah, I mean, just kind of playing around with my computer here and being able to run

680
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,280
stuff now is nice.

681
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,280
That's pretty much it.

682
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,280
Oh, cell phone games.

683
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:45,240
You know, doing the daily Pokemon stuff and my idle, you know, clicker office space game,

684
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:49,440
which is actually, you know, for an aisle clicker game, they do give you a lot more

685
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,240
reasons to play, especially with all these different events that they do each week.

686
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:58,840
So it's kind of a challenge, I guess, to try to earn as many because you play it as a completely

687
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:01,240
separate game than the one you're at your main game.

688
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:06,640
And then you, the levels that you get to also unlock things for the main game, which is

689
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,640
kind of cool.

690
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:10,360
So it gives you a little bit of a challenge to play it.

691
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:15,200
And I'm sure for them, it means more ad revenue because you watch more ads, but I'm enjoying

692
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,200
it.

693
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:21,920
I mean, it's a good time sink and it doesn't seem to be so blatant with like, I don't know,

694
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,760
it's not, it doesn't feel like some of the other ones that play like Katamari or EDF

695
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,760
or anything like that.

696
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,760
So I don't know.

697
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,760
I enjoy it.

698
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,760
That's it.

699
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,360
I want to grow you a little more on Overwatch.

700
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:35,240
I know you didn't get to play a lot of it, but what did you think?

701
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,240
I liked it.

702
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,240
I thought it was interesting.

703
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,240
I mean, I don't know.

704
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,240
It was so brief.

705
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:44,040
I mainly played a few games, but I've been playing just Soldier 76.

706
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:48,160
Which is probably the easiest one to start with if you're used to, you know, other shooty

707
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,160
games.

708
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,680
They kind of made him to be the Call of Duty guy.

709
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:51,680
Yeah.

710
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,400
So that's what I've been just playing for now.

711
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:58,060
I mean, obviously, you know, against the AI, it's kind of stupid.

712
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:00,000
It's like, okay, I've just played through four games.

713
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
I've gotten no deaths.

714
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,920
I mean, obviously this is on super easy mode right now, but I mean, I don't know.

715
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:05,920
I had fun.

716
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:12,280
It was kind of ironic because like, I didn't know, like, I don't know if all like the AI

717
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:16,160
acts like people in the game because I finally figured out, because like when it said versus

718
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:20,400
AI, I thought, okay, it's just me with an AI team placing against another team of AI.

719
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,560
Apparently you're playing against other, with other people against AI.

720
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,560
I had no idea.

721
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,560
Yep.

722
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:28,240
And so there's like at the end of the matches, a whole bunch of like GG, GG, you know, and

723
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,240
stuff like that.

724
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:32,480
I'm like, is that the AI doing that or is that like the people doing that?

725
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,480
I'm like, I don't know.

726
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:40,120
I don't know who's really actually the AI does it in those AI matches, the AI will randomly

727
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:45,000
type GG, uh, you know, or if they lose, they'll put, you know, Oh, shucks, you know, things

728
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
like that.

729
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,640
They'll, they actually do put little chat messages in.

730
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,640
Okay.

731
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,040
I was like, I didn't, I thought that was kind of weird.

732
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:54,080
I'm like, I didn't realize that it was that sophisticated, but yeah, I mean, like it's

733
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,880
been super easy right now.

734
00:40:55,880 --> 00:41:00,840
I mean, obviously cause I'm like level three, but, um, I don't know, like it is far as like

735
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:01,840
the unlocks go.

736
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:07,080
I got the, um, tracer skin for the, um, you know, game of the year things.

737
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,880
So you got a legendary in your first loot box.

738
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:10,880
Yeah.

739
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:11,880
Wow.

740
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:12,880
Good for you.

741
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:13,880
So, um, that was kind of nice.

742
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:17,080
I mean, all the other ones have sucked, but, uh, active to suggesting Loki can also try

743
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,920
diva then move on to other characters.

744
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:19,920
Yeah.

745
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,880
As far as, you know, especially with the tanks go, diva is just got a machine gun basically.

746
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:27,400
So she, and it's unlimited ammo, so it's just pretty easy to, but when you get knocked the

747
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:31,000
whole getting knocked out of the Mac and go, that can be a little weird, but that gets

748
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,280
you used to some of the other like weird shit that happens on other characters.

749
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,280
Yeah.

750
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,600
I'd be curious to figure out how to play the other characters.

751
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:39,960
I just don't want to grow, you know, jump into a match and like, Oh, you suck.

752
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:44,480
I mean, a great in on level three or something, they're gonna probably assume I suck anyways,

753
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,720
but like, I don't want to just like go in there and just be like complete detriment.

754
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:50,560
Most of that, most of that is kept to ranked at this point.

755
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:53,520
Anyway, if you're playing quick match, you're going to get people of all skill levels.

756
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,600
That's just a fact, but you can, and I use this a lot.

757
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:00,440
The practice range is great for getting used to characters.

758
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:03,280
Like especially when I was trying to learn how to play Sombra cause you really have to

759
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:07,960
get used to the whole, like how she disappears and you know, throws her thing that she can

760
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,400
teleport back to and kind of the timing between those.

761
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:15,880
So you can really effectively like, you know, throw out your teleport, invis, get behind

762
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:20,680
the enemy while you're invisible, hack the enemy and then teleport back before they notice

763
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,200
you and start shooting you.

764
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,760
That that takes practice to get all that timing down, you know?

765
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:28,040
So I mean the practice range is great for that type of stuff and really be able to time

766
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,160
the moves and stuff.

767
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,520
So all right.

768
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,960
Anything else for your gaming week?

769
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:34,960
That's it.

770
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:35,960
All right.

771
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:38,800
Uh, my gaming week, not, not, uh, not as exciting as other weeks.

772
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,200
I didn't play a lot of new stuff.

773
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:44,200
Uh, you know, I've been live streaming and playing some, playing some overwatch and live

774
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:48,200
stream and Final Fantasy 14 quite a bit as well, uh, and other stuff, but not a lot of

775
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,280
new stuff this week.

776
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:55,240
I feel like I've watched enough Friday the 13th on live streams to have said I played

777
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:58,520
it, but I haven't played it, but I've watched an awful lot of it.

778
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:02,720
Obviously my buddy Flaco Jones has been streaming a lot of it, but I watched other random people,

779
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,920
um, in some of the communities streaming it too.

780
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,800
And it looks, it looks like it's fun.

781
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:11,280
The only concern I have with dropping 40 bucks on a game like Friday the 13th is the fact

782
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,080
that, you know, there's only just a couple maps right now.

783
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:19,560
And it seems like that whole, the game format, like it's really fun now for a weekend, but

784
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:20,920
how long is that really going to last?

785
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,120
I'm not sure.

786
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:26,080
So that's why I'm, but the real question is, are they going to have like the Jason and

787
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:28,100
space map at some point?

788
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:30,940
They might, I don't, I don't know what else they're going to put out there, but, um, well

789
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:35,180
I did see, okay, so Flaco was streaming last night and he was letting his wife.

790
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:39,340
So is he play like as, you know, uh, Jason or is he, it's random.

791
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:40,340
You get random.

792
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:41,340
Yeah.

793
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:43,460
You can elect if you're willing to be Jason or whatever.

794
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:46,420
I think you can turn that on or off or something, but it's random.

795
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:47,420
Who's Jason.

796
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:51,140
In fact, this was about to say is that, uh, in the first match that Flaco played last

797
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:53,300
night when I was watching, he let his wife play.

798
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:56,960
So, um, he was like, you know, he wanted to let the wife get used to it and she screams

799
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,000
a lot when, you know, scary things happen.

800
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,600
So it's a lot of fun.

801
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:07,840
Um, so the first match, she gets Jason and it's, he, Flaco had never played Jason at

802
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:08,840
all ever.

803
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:13,200
So they were kind of both learning how Jason works because Jason obviously has all these

804
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:17,880
abilities that the counselor doesn't, counselors don't have to keep it balanced because there's,

805
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:21,560
there could be up to like seven camp counselors and one Jason.

806
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:25,640
So Jason can fricking teleport, he can do this thing called morph and he can teleport

807
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,180
pretty much anywhere on the map.

808
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:30,320
And then he can do this thing called like, I don't know if it was stock or what it was,

809
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:35,360
but you can basically like do this, like drifting through the woods at a really fast pace.

810
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:38,720
But it's that whole thing, like how in the movies, Jason would just suddenly appear behind

811
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:39,720
somebody.

812
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:41,380
Like you can do that in the game.

813
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:44,560
But obviously, you know, you still have to kind of have a general idea where the counselors

814
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,280
are to be able to do that.

815
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:49,120
Can you see them like through the walls or something like that and they have like, there's

816
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:50,120
certain modes.

817
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:53,520
Like I think if you just start, they glow red or you can see when they're sound, when

818
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:58,480
the counselors are making sound, you see little, little dots that appear on the map,

819
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:04,640
but they give the counselors like radios and some of the cabins to screw with Jason with

820
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:05,640
that.

821
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:10,280
So there is a little bit of, you know, Jason isn't super powerful, but like it's, it's

822
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:15,800
almost impossible to get through a Friday the 13th game and not have Jason at least

823
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,240
kill a couple people.

824
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:22,780
It's just, it's, it's a damn near impossible for all of the counselors to escape unscathed.

825
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:26,060
So, uh, yeah, it's just, it's as it should be.

826
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:27,060
Right.

827
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:28,060
Let's see.

828
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:31,460
I mean, if he's not killing somebody, he's going to, his reputation is definitely going

829
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:33,460
to be ruined from it.

830
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:36,700
Dungeon buster said it was funny watching one stream where the guy tried to rescue his

831
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:40,940
friend getting choked by Jason and took a shot killing his friend instead.

832
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:43,260
That's from a dungeon buster at live.vogdoer.com.

833
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:44,260
Yeah, that can happen.

834
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:47,940
You can actually kill the other counselors too, uh, in the game.

835
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:52,300
So cause I remember Flaco was about to escape on the boat and he was afraid that the other

836
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:54,620
counselor that was with him was going to try to kill him.

837
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:57,540
But then like Flaco got in the boat and the other counselor like wasn't getting in the

838
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:58,540
boat.

839
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:03,240
So Flaco gave it like 20 seconds then was like, I'm out of here and zoomed out and got

840
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:06,640
on the boat and left the other counselor basically to be stranded.

841
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:10,940
And sure enough, once he got out of there, he, you go into spectate mode once you're

842
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:14,480
either dead or you, you get out of the camp so you can see the rest of the game play out.

843
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:18,580
And he ended up spectating the counselor that was trying to get in the boat with him and

844
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:21,540
Jason was already killing her.

845
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:27,420
So Flaco got out of there and then Jason killed the one that he left behind.

846
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:28,420
And I was laughing.

847
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:29,420
I was laughing.

848
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:33,140
I think, I think I actually tipped Flaco like a hundred bits just cause that moment was

849
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:34,460
so fucking funny.

850
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:37,220
So yeah, you can see that over, over in his chat.

851
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:38,220
Yeah.

852
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:40,380
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says Flaco is a cold blooded murderer.

853
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:41,380
Yes.

854
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:42,380
Yes.

855
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:43,380
He was that night.

856
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:44,380
He definitely was.

857
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:45,380
Hey, it's all about survival.

858
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:47,980
I mean, I look out for number one because if you don't, then that's when stupid things

859
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:48,980
happen.

860
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:49,980
You die.

861
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:51,580
So I didn't even play that myself.

862
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:53,940
I'm just telling you what I'm like fun.

863
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:57,380
I think especially like with friends and stuff, it would be fun, but I just worry about the

864
00:46:57,380 --> 00:46:58,380
longevity of it.

865
00:46:58,380 --> 00:46:59,660
Does he have that on PlayStation 4 or?

866
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:02,900
He has it on PlayStation 4, but almost every other streamer I've seen is on PC.

867
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:03,900
Sounds like fun.

868
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:04,900
Yeah.

869
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:06,220
That'd be a lot of fun.

870
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:07,440
Um, let's see.

871
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:08,440
Other games.

872
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:09,440
Um, okay.

873
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:12,180
So I will talk about one phone game cause obviously I still play, you know, the Niantic

874
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:15,940
games, but I want to talk about another new game that just came out this week.

875
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:16,940
Oh yes.

876
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:17,940
I need to get this actually.

877
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:23,460
So, um, uh, Dark Soccer as the fortune cookie message last week or the week before played

878
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:26,820
that Magikarp song that was about how Magikarp is like the worst Pokemon ever.

879
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:31,980
Well, that was all to lead into a game that Pokemon company released called Magikarp basically,

880
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:34,140
or I think at least that's what the icon's called.

881
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:35,140
What is the actual name of this game?

882
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:37,140
I think it's like Magikarp.

883
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:38,540
Let's raise Magikarp or something like that.

884
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:39,780
I don't know the actual name of the game.

885
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:41,520
It's a Pokemon Magikarp jump.

886
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:42,860
That's the name of it.

887
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:49,360
So in this game, and I use that term very loosely, you feed Magikarp food, you train

888
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:57,040
Magikarp and you battle, but all it is is you jump and you jump high based on how well

889
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,460
your Pokemon has been raised basically.

890
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:02,540
But here's, here's the little twist with this game.

891
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:03,620
There's no fucking game.

892
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:04,620
There's no skill.

893
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:05,620
The training?

894
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:06,900
You just click train.

895
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:07,900
Okay.

896
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:08,900
You trained.

897
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:09,900
Uh, the feeding?

898
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:11,960
You just tap the food on the, I suppose that's the game.

899
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:15,400
You tap the food on the screen to feed your Magikarp.

900
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:16,400
That's it.

901
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:17,400
There's no other.

902
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:22,640
So I mean, I guess you could say loosely, like very loosely.

903
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:27,880
There's some strategy about, well, do I spend coins to upgrade the food in my tank or do

904
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:31,320
I spend coins to upgrade the types of training available?

905
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:32,320
What do I do?

906
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:37,460
What do I do or what should I spend those diamonds on that I could drop real money on

907
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:41,080
if I wanted to, but I'll just try to save enough from all the little piddly things you

908
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:42,080
do in the game.

909
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:46,640
Should I get a Charizard for my little thing that will restore points of training once

910
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:47,640
in a while?

911
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:48,760
You know, all the dumb things they do.

912
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:52,960
So like, that's the only thing about the Magikarp jump game is that like, there's no fucking

913
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:53,960
game.

914
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:54,960
There really isn't.

915
00:48:54,960 --> 00:49:00,360
Like, I feel like I'm playing a BBS door game on an iPhone and yet those BBS door games

916
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:01,800
still had more skill.

917
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:04,800
You know what I mean?

918
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:10,440
Yet all that being said, I still can't stop playing it and I check in on my stupid little

919
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:15,720
Magikarp and I'm now on my eighth generation of Magikarp and I keep feeding and I train

920
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:21,560
and I jump and there's leaderboards so I can see how I'm doing versus my friends and Ziba,

921
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:24,480
if you're out there, I'm coming for you.

922
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:27,560
She's like number one or two on my leaderboard right now.

923
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:32,760
And you know, you can kind of compete with your friends in that regard, but it's like,

924
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:35,500
you really don't have any control over the jumping.

925
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:39,160
It's just press the button and depending on how well you've or how much you've raised

926
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:41,320
your Magikarp, that's how high they're going to jump.

927
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:44,920
So it's like, like you would think at least there's like a meter that like press button

928
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:46,080
when the arrow is here.

929
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:47,080
No, there's none of that.

930
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:48,380
None of that stuff.

931
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:51,680
So MXC says, so it's a clicker?

932
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:56,200
Like yes, but like there's no clicking.

933
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:57,200
It's worse somehow.

934
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,000
It's like a nothing.

935
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Yeah.

936
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,920
It's just, it's, it, it is for, for Magikarp being a game.

937
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:09,880
It's kind of perfect actually.

938
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:12,160
That's going to be the fucking quote they put on the app store.

939
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,160
All right.

940
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:16,160
But y'all know what I mean by that, but yet I can't stop playing.

941
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,160
Yeah.

942
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:18,160
Like Ziba says, it's so addicting.

943
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:19,880
I don't know what it is.

944
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:24,600
Maybe it is just the fact that you can't help, but love that little derpy Magikarp and they

945
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:26,480
do have the Magikarp in the different patterns.

946
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:29,240
So you're like, Ooh, maybe I'll get a, maybe I'll get a polka dot pattern in this time

947
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:31,280
or something, you know, a little crazy.

948
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:35,480
Does it actually come with like actual carp patterns, like real koi?

949
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:38,160
I imagine some of it is modeled after real stuff.

950
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,160
It has to be.

951
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:40,160
There's a ton of different ones in there.

952
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:42,160
I think the Magikarp and the Goldeen are both patterned on koi.

953
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:43,160
Oh yeah.

954
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:44,160
So.

955
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,160
Huh.

956
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:46,160
Interesting.

957
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:49,600
Uh, Rama in chat says it's a Tamagotchi that never dies.

958
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:52,240
That is actually an interesting way of putting it.

959
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:55,480
Uh, but act F says, unless it gets snagged by a Pidgeotto.

960
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:56,480
Oh yes.

961
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,120
I learned that the hard way.

962
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:01,200
Be careful you guys, because some of those little side things that happen.

963
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:05,200
So after you train, it might be like, Ooh, an event happened to Magikarp.

964
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:09,240
And usually it'll be the mayor came out to greet Magikarp and gave you back a training

965
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:14,080
point or, you know, Magikarp made a fan and the fan gave you money, you know, those types

966
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:15,080
of things.

967
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:19,360
But there was one where it was like, should Magikarp jump up to try to get this berry

968
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:22,640
and you see like a really rare berry and you're like, fuck yeah, I get the berry and you hit

969
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:23,640
the button.

970
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:28,720
And Magikarp jumped and a Pidgeotto snatched Magikarp and carried him away.

971
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:29,800
And that was it.

972
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:35,100
My Magikarp was gone and I had to go back to the lake and fish up a new one.

973
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:38,880
And the mayor just consoled me like, Oh yeah, that happens.

974
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:42,840
So don't be so greedy asshole basically.

975
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:49,160
So yeah, that's what the vid power in chat says Pidgeottos eat Magikarp, uh, apparently

976
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:53,480
or they, or they carry them away to a far off land.

977
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:55,480
That's but that's what happened.

978
00:51:55,480 --> 00:52:00,720
So be careful because there's another one that involves something shiny in the water.

979
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:03,880
And I've gotten a diamond most times when I do that.

980
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:08,400
And there was one time I got a piece of glass, but it said, Oh, Magikarp was just really

981
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:11,640
disappointed that it was glass and it lost some of the training points, but I'm just

982
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:13,400
waiting for the whole, Oh, it's shiny.

983
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:14,960
Oh, it's a hook.

984
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:18,300
Your Magikarp just got caught and got filleted for dinner.

985
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:20,280
Your Magikarp is an idiot and he swallowed glass.

986
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:24,560
No, he's dead cause his intestines have been ruptured by the glass.

987
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:25,560
Right.

988
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:26,560
All right.

989
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:27,560
Anyway.

990
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:29,880
Uh, so yeah, I've been playing the Magikarp game on phone.

991
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:31,700
Play at your own risk.

992
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:35,280
It's stupid, but yet sometimes we like stupid things.

993
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:38,960
Can you get, um, I'm signed Nintendo game was going to say, can you get like my Nintendo

994
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:40,200
points with it or something?

995
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:41,400
No, none of that stuff's in it.

996
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:44,200
Cause it doesn't tie in at all with Pokemon go.

997
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:46,280
No it's a Pokemon company game.

998
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:50,120
Uh, and so it's more like a Pokemon shuffle or something like that.

999
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:54,560
It does not tie into Pokemon go, which is a Niantic game and it doesn't tie into the

1000
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:57,920
Nintendo stuff cause Nintendo didn't make anything they could do to earn more Magikarp

1001
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:00,240
candy cause that's just ridiculous.

1002
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:01,240
I hear ya.

1003
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:04,920
Well you should have done this event where you could get like a Magikarp candy for going

1004
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:07,240
a quarter mile or a quarter kilometer.

1005
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:08,240
Excuse me.

1006
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:12,240
I did that with my stupid, I have a, um, what is it?

1007
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:18,860
It's a char Charizard, not a Charizard, a little over the Charmeleon.

1008
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:21,860
So I've been doing it with the Charmeleon to try to evolve because there's no tormentors

1009
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:22,860
around here to catch.

1010
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:28,860
So speaking of Pokemon go, Alan came into the office today and said, well guess what

1011
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:30,340
went through the wash?

1012
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:34,200
And there went my, there's my Pokemon clicker that I lost and I couldn't find it had gone

1013
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:38,060
through the wash, but here's the punchline still works.

1014
00:53:38,060 --> 00:53:39,060
Still works.

1015
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:42,380
In fact, I would even argue it actually, it's a little cleaner now.

1016
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:45,220
It looks very nice and actually probably works better.

1017
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:47,940
Not that I'm encouraging you guys to put that through the wash, do it at your own risk.

1018
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:50,940
But uh, I was very surprised.

1019
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:53,260
I was like, wow, this went through the wash and it still works.

1020
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:54,260
So cool.

1021
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:58,180
I mean, I can imagine the technology sealed pretty tight in there.

1022
00:53:58,180 --> 00:53:59,180
These things are for little kids.

1023
00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:03,620
No, I mean, the only, I would think it would just harm is if it actually had like electricity

1024
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:06,740
running through it and stuff and bridging stuff, but there's not that much electricity

1025
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:07,740
running through that.

1026
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:11,820
And also since you dried it out, I mean, it's probably fine.

1027
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:14,900
I wouldn't be surprised if it like was melted more than anything.

1028
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:18,540
Dark Tits Studio in chat says, never expected something like that to be made of Nintendium,

1029
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:19,540
but there you go.

1030
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:20,540
Is that a joke?

1031
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:23,620
Because like the old, like super Nintendos, like they don't fucking break.

1032
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:28,180
No, I think it was like, was it the one that, uh, the, um, Game Boy that went through from

1033
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:29,620
the golf war or something like that?

1034
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:30,620
Oh yeah.

1035
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:31,620
Yeah.

1036
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:32,620
They have that on display in New York.

1037
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:33,620
Yeah.

1038
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:34,620
Yeah.

1039
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:35,620
Yeah.

1040
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:36,620
Okay.

1041
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:37,620
Yeah.

1042
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:38,620
Yeah.

1043
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:39,620
No, the Nintendo hardware, man, those things can take a beating.

1044
00:54:39,620 --> 00:54:40,620
Or, uh, what?

1045
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:41,620
The Nintendo 64 that fell down an entire flight of stairs.

1046
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:42,620
It still works.

1047
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:43,620
It's just, yeah.

1048
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:44,620
I guess, I guess it's true.

1049
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:47,220
The Nintendo systems are great murder weapons.

1050
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:54,380
All right, let's get a break first, your skull or the Nintendo 64.

1051
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:55,380
Let's get into some gaming news.

1052
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:56,820
Oh, I got to do some quick housekeeping.

1053
00:54:56,820 --> 00:55:01,380
Uh, we're two weeks away from E3, so Bethesda will be rudely interrupting our show in two

1054
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:04,840
weeks with their press conference, but we will be talking all about E3 for the first

1055
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:08,760
time we get to do Microsoft the day of, cause they're going a little earlier this year.

1056
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:09,760
So talk all about that.

1057
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:10,780
That's in two weeks.

1058
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:19,380
And then in three weeks is the 15th anniversary of orange lounge radio on June 18th, 15 years

1059
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:21,020
of this fucking show.

1060
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:26,860
Um, and actually I should point out technically orange lounge radio, the station launched

1061
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:29,900
on May 23rd, 2002.

1062
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:34,340
So we actually hit 15 years as a, as an entity or whatever you want to call it this past

1063
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:35,340
week.

1064
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:38,260
But we launched the station on, on life's cause the way it was back 15 years ago, when

1065
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:42,060
we first started, we had orange lounge radio, the station that just played like DDR music

1066
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:43,540
and stuff that we liked.

1067
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:49,300
And the highlight of the station was to be the orange lounge radio live, which was the

1068
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:54,740
show on Sunday nights that this whole thing started with and, but we gave it like a month

1069
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:56,340
lead in time.

1070
00:55:56,340 --> 00:55:58,940
Originally we were going to start it a week earlier than we did.

1071
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:04,620
The first episode was supposed to be the June or June, June, what's seven days from the

1072
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:05,620
23rd.

1073
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:07,300
I can't math right now cause I've been drinking 16.

1074
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:09,540
Originally the first show is supposed to be June 16th.

1075
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:14,980
The earliest promo stuff we did said June 16th, 2002, but we had to push it back a week

1076
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:16,540
and it was dark soccer's fault.

1077
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:20,140
I don't remember why, probably a trip or something.

1078
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:21,140
She's making a frown.

1079
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:24,620
I'll show you a trip when I trip you down the stairs.

1080
00:56:24,620 --> 00:56:28,180
But yeah, so, so we had launched the station in advance of the show and then our first

1081
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:29,420
show is June 23rd.

1082
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:35,380
So we'll be celebrating all that in a few weeks with you guys here at our chatroom live.vognetworked.com.

1083
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:37,260
All right, let's get into some gaming news.

1084
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:38,380
Loki, start us off.

1085
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:42,340
So Microsoft Beam is no more.

1086
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:48,960
So because of some trouble that they had with registering the, using the Beam name overseas,

1087
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:52,540
they decided to change the name to Mixer.

1088
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:57,600
And Mixer of course is kind of relaunching with some new innovations.

1089
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:03,980
So what's kind of cool is you can actually do, I want to say cooperative live streaming.

1090
00:57:03,980 --> 00:57:09,220
So it allows up to four streamers to combine their broadcast into a single experience,

1091
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:10,940
they say with like split screen views.

1092
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:13,780
So that alone is awesome.

1093
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:17,700
But I actually went to go watch a feed where somebody was doing this.

1094
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:20,140
And so there was the four stream, I don't remember what they're all playing.

1095
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:22,500
They're playing some shooty bang bang game.

1096
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:26,180
And there were the four streamers, but the problem was all four of their audios were

1097
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:27,180
going at the same time.

1098
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:30,780
And these were all, these were all four big Beam streamers.

1099
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:33,900
So like all of them at the same time were like, thank you for the follow.

1100
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:34,900
Thank you.

1101
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:37,740
And like, they were all talking like over each other at the same time.

1102
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:40,380
So it was kind of like, I couldn't watch it.

1103
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:41,380
I was like, this is a mess.

1104
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:44,380
Like, I should just watch one of these streams individually.

1105
00:57:44,380 --> 00:57:46,540
I mean, that's cool that they're all tied together.

1106
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:51,220
So it's like, you could do the multi, it's like when you watch Big Brother on CBS, if

1107
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:54,820
you've ever done that online, you can switch between the different camera feeds in the

1108
00:57:54,820 --> 00:57:55,820
house.

1109
00:57:55,820 --> 00:57:58,300
But if you try to watch them all at once, it's like, there's too much going on.

1110
00:57:58,300 --> 00:57:59,300
Night trap.

1111
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:00,300
I would compare.

1112
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:01,820
Or night trap.

1113
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:02,820
Sure.

1114
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:03,820
We'll go with that.

1115
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:04,820
So it's a little bit like that.

1116
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:06,940
But I mean, in theory, it's still a cool idea.

1117
00:58:06,940 --> 00:58:08,620
And you know, they're still working out the kinks.

1118
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:13,500
I mean, if everybody had agreed to just be silent, you know, maybe three of the streamers

1119
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:14,860
just agreed to be silent.

1120
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:18,540
And then the four streamer did all the talking in the audio and you just watched on the other

1121
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:19,540
ones.

1122
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:20,540
I think it would have worked a lot better.

1123
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:24,260
So, but I love that this is a feature.

1124
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:28,380
When Beam announced that I was like, oh shit, that's something like I would love to do for

1125
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:29,380
VOG.

1126
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:33,580
Like when we do one of these Mario Kart 8 tournaments, like how easy would that be?

1127
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:35,300
Bobby does a stream.

1128
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:36,820
I do a stream.

1129
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:37,820
Flaco does a stream.

1130
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:39,900
Like this would be like really, really cool.

1131
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:44,700
Now I still, you know, I'm, I'm don't plan on leaving Twitch right now.

1132
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:47,700
I tried Beam or I guess now it is Mixer.

1133
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:52,980
I have Mixer, Mixer, Mixer, I have an account over there.

1134
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:56,860
There's a lot about Mixer that I like, but now that I have the whole Twitch affiliate

1135
00:58:56,860 --> 00:58:59,980
thing going on, I've just kind of tried to invest building up my presence over there.

1136
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:05,500
I don't see myself jumping ship and leaving for Beam, but I love that there's competition

1137
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:06,500
now.

1138
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:11,380
And this is going to, I mean, yes, there was YouTube, but YouTube, I don't know, YouTube

1139
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:14,640
wasn't trying to compete with Twitch the same way that I think Microsoft is trying to do

1140
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:16,180
with now Mixer.

1141
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:20,980
And so I love that Mixer exists and I love that they are putting stuff like this out

1142
00:59:20,980 --> 00:59:27,140
there to try to differentiate themselves from Twitch to keep Twitch on their toes.

1143
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:32,580
But you know, one thing to consider for Mixer or Microsoft to consider, I suppose, is that

1144
00:59:32,580 --> 00:59:38,560
it's a lot easier right now to become an affiliate on Twitch and make money, even though you're

1145
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:41,680
not going to make much money, but you know, have that door open to the potential to making

1146
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:42,860
money like YouTube.

1147
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:45,480
A lot of people, it's pretty, or was easy to do on YouTube.

1148
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:47,820
Now it's a little harder, but still pretty reasonable, right?

1149
00:59:47,820 --> 00:59:52,380
You have to have what, 50,000 or 5,000 life views or something on your channel?

1150
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:53,380
Yeah.

1151
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:54,380
Yeah.

1152
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:58,260
Well, I mean, like my channel, which is like, I don't upload anything to it, already has

1153
00:59:58,260 --> 00:59:59,260
that.

1154
00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:00,260
Yeah.

1155
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:01,260
It's yeah.

1156
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:02,260
Right.

1157
01:00:02,260 --> 01:00:03,260
Is if you've been on there a while, you've, you just kind of hit it naturally.

1158
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:05,300
But, um, but anyway, all that aside.

1159
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:09,300
So like Beam still doesn't have that where you have that potential to make money.

1160
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:13,180
I mean, yes, you can become a partner over there, but the partner requirements are pretty

1161
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:17,620
high for a service that still hasn't attracted a ton of people.

1162
01:00:17,620 --> 01:00:23,320
Now that being said, Microsoft clearly is pushing this forward with their E3 plans is

1163
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:25,180
going to be exclusively through this, right?

1164
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:27,100
Which we all, we knew this was coming.

1165
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:30,420
The minute they bought Beam, we knew if you want to see their E3 stuff, you're going to

1166
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:31,420
have to go to Beam.

1167
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:33,900
They're not going to put it on Twitch because they want people to go to this new site and

1168
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:34,900
check it out.

1169
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:37,100
They could be on YouTube or on their own web page.

1170
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:38,100
Yeah.

1171
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:41,900
Well, you'll be on their own web page will be powered through this Beam thing, the mixer.

1172
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:45,700
I'm still going to be calling it Beam, sorry guys, but, um, it's still going to be powered

1173
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:47,180
through that whole thing.

1174
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:48,180
Yeah.

1175
01:00:48,180 --> 01:00:50,900
So the other thing that they're adding to that with, um, with that is they're going

1176
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:53,060
to be extending it also to mobile.

1177
01:00:53,060 --> 01:00:56,620
So they're going to have, um, iOS and Android apps that you'll like the broadcast mobile

1178
01:00:56,620 --> 01:00:58,180
games as well.

1179
01:00:58,180 --> 01:01:00,300
Um, yeah.

1180
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:01,780
So it's interesting.

1181
01:01:01,780 --> 01:01:04,880
I like the name mixer better than Beam.

1182
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:09,940
So it makes me think of audio though, exclusively, I'm kind of surprised that name was available

1183
01:01:09,940 --> 01:01:10,940
to be honest.

1184
01:01:10,940 --> 01:01:13,460
I was like, wow, there isn't already a site called mixer somewhere like for audio.

1185
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:16,780
I would have thought like an audio thing for sure would have already had that name,

1186
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:22,260
but maybe Microsoft bought a company called that a long time ago and now they're taking

1187
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:23,260
advantage of that name.

1188
01:01:23,260 --> 01:01:24,260
Who knows?

1189
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:29,380
So, yeah, no, uh, I think, I think it's cool, you know, it's like I said, I think this type

1190
01:01:29,380 --> 01:01:30,820
of competition is great.

1191
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:35,940
Uh, Beam doing the whole 4k thing I think is going to push Twitch to figure out how

1192
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:38,900
they can address some of those technical things a little faster.

1193
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:45,020
Um, but it will be interesting to see as mixer gets more of an audience and gets E3,

1194
01:01:45,020 --> 01:01:50,540
are they going to be able to keep this promise of the whole, it is really live streaming

1195
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:55,500
because Twitch used to be that way, but then when they got so popular, their servers couldn't

1196
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:56,660
handle it.

1197
01:01:56,660 --> 01:01:59,820
But I think mixer does something with the encoder.

1198
01:01:59,820 --> 01:02:04,340
Like there is a new encoder that you use to have this because I, I checked it out when

1199
01:02:04,340 --> 01:02:08,380
I was doing, when I was playing around with Beam for a couple of streams that I did.

1200
01:02:08,380 --> 01:02:11,380
Um, you have to get a different codec for this.

1201
01:02:11,380 --> 01:02:15,780
So, you know, I'm sure this all kind of balances out, but it'll be interesting to see when

1202
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:19,620
they do get that increased demand, which they're going to get at E3, I hope Microsoft's ready

1203
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:20,820
for it.

1204
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:23,580
That's all.

1205
01:02:23,580 --> 01:02:28,620
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I think it was the fact that they were stuck with dot pro

1206
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:32,140
and that was the issue because that doesn't work in every country.

1207
01:02:32,140 --> 01:02:37,780
Uh, they probably bought the domain, but couldn't get beam.com was probably the big

1208
01:02:37,780 --> 01:02:38,780
issue there.

1209
01:02:38,780 --> 01:02:43,260
So it was that dot pro and that, yeah, I admit that's kind of a, I mean, why didn't they

1210
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:44,940
get beam.tv?

1211
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:46,340
Cause Twitch TV works everywhere.

1212
01:02:46,340 --> 01:02:47,340
Right?

1213
01:02:47,340 --> 01:02:48,340
Yeah.

1214
01:02:48,340 --> 01:02:49,780
Why, why was it pro?

1215
01:02:49,780 --> 01:02:51,540
Because remember Microsoft didn't create it.

1216
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:52,540
Some other folks did.

1217
01:02:52,540 --> 01:02:56,680
So that's just what they beam was to stream or whatever.

1218
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:58,180
Get a new webpage because why?

1219
01:02:58,180 --> 01:02:59,180
Well, they did.

1220
01:02:59,180 --> 01:03:00,180
They, now they have mixer.

1221
01:03:00,220 --> 01:03:04,060
It just makes me think of either booze or music.

1222
01:03:04,060 --> 01:03:05,140
I liked the name beam.

1223
01:03:05,140 --> 01:03:06,140
I did.

1224
01:03:06,140 --> 01:03:07,340
I thought, you know, for what it was, but I get it.

1225
01:03:07,340 --> 01:03:12,220
I mean if the dot pro thing doesn't work everywhere and it is, it is a harder extension name to

1226
01:03:12,220 --> 01:03:14,340
kind of catch on and you are going to get a lot of people to go.

1227
01:03:14,340 --> 01:03:21,780
I think if you go to twitch.com, beam slash dot xxx and then everybody would pay attention.

1228
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:22,780
I'm actually curious.

1229
01:03:22,780 --> 01:03:23,780
I hope I don't get porn.

1230
01:03:23,780 --> 01:03:24,780
Yeah.

1231
01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:27,980
If you go to twitch.com it just redirects to twitch TV.

1232
01:03:27,980 --> 01:03:32,500
So even if people didn't know it was a dot TV and you type twitch.com, you're still going

1233
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:36,060
to go to the right place and probably beam couldn't really do that.

1234
01:03:36,060 --> 01:03:40,100
And it might be surprised how much it might've been holding them back.

1235
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:41,100
Anyway.

1236
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:42,460
Um, cool.

1237
01:03:42,460 --> 01:03:46,860
I'm curious to see what else they announce, uh, closer to E3 and you know, I, I welcome

1238
01:03:46,860 --> 01:03:50,100
a little more competition in the streaming space as far as all that goes.

1239
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:52,620
I think it's going to keep everybody on their toes and that's great.

1240
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:57,140
Uh, we've been talking about this for a couple of weeks on the show and that is Castlevania

1241
01:03:57,300 --> 01:03:58,300
coming to Netflix.

1242
01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:02,500
Well, the first trailer came out and I've got some good news, everybody.

1243
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:04,220
It's not a live action thing.

1244
01:04:04,220 --> 01:04:05,220
Yay.

1245
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:09,900
Which I, yes, it's a good thing because live action probably, probably would have been

1246
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:10,900
cheesy.

1247
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:14,100
So it is an anime, uh, and, uh, it is actually not a movie.

1248
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:16,500
It's like a television series type of thing.

1249
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:20,220
So the trailer is out there and it will debut on Netflix, July 7th.

1250
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:23,300
So this is going to be a little sooner than we thought.

1251
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:27,060
Um, so I guess they must've been able to keep this a secret for a while before we found

1252
01:04:27,060 --> 01:04:29,220
out that the Castlevania thing was happening.

1253
01:04:29,220 --> 01:04:33,820
And I'm sure the production of anime is going to be a little more accelerated than something

1254
01:04:33,820 --> 01:04:35,540
that is live action.

1255
01:04:35,540 --> 01:04:39,300
But still that is a pretty fast after we got the announcement in February.

1256
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:43,140
Um, so yep, it's an anime.

1257
01:04:43,140 --> 01:04:45,620
Looks like it might get to be a little bit violent.

1258
01:04:45,620 --> 01:04:48,300
Looks like it is going to have that tone that goes with it.

1259
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:51,700
So I have to admit, I don't watch a ton of, ton of anime.

1260
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:53,020
That's nothing against anime.

1261
01:04:53,020 --> 01:04:56,220
I just, I watch little TV as there is.

1262
01:04:56,220 --> 01:04:58,340
There's only so many shows I can make time to watch.

1263
01:04:58,340 --> 01:05:00,580
Um, but I do want to check out this Castlevania thing.

1264
01:05:00,580 --> 01:05:01,580
That's for sure.

1265
01:05:01,580 --> 01:05:02,580
It looked, it looked pretty cool.

1266
01:05:02,580 --> 01:05:04,620
At least the first episode to see if it's worth watching the rest.

1267
01:05:04,620 --> 01:05:06,020
What'd you guys think of the trailer?

1268
01:05:06,020 --> 01:05:07,020
It looked cool.

1269
01:05:07,020 --> 01:05:08,020
Yeah.

1270
01:05:08,020 --> 01:05:09,020
It looked cool.

1271
01:05:09,020 --> 01:05:10,020
I like Castlevania three.

1272
01:05:10,020 --> 01:05:12,900
So I mean, it'll be neat to see what it looks like.

1273
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:13,900
Dark Sakura.

1274
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:15,900
I know this is a franchise that's near and dear to you.

1275
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:17,460
What are your thoughts with all this?

1276
01:05:17,460 --> 01:05:18,460
It looks cool.

1277
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:19,460
Yeah.

1278
01:05:19,460 --> 01:05:20,460
So you're on board?

1279
01:05:20,460 --> 01:05:21,460
Maybe.

1280
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:22,460
Maybe.

1281
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:23,980
I'm in a reserve judgment for watching the first episode.

1282
01:05:23,980 --> 01:05:24,980
Fair enough.

1283
01:05:24,980 --> 01:05:25,980
Fair enough.

1284
01:05:26,740 --> 01:05:28,780
I think it's a good mindset to be in for a lot of people checking in our chat room over

1285
01:05:28,780 --> 01:05:33,860
at live.vognetwork.com dark Tetsuya says, I'm super hyped for the Castlevania anime.

1286
01:05:33,860 --> 01:05:37,460
YYR says, I can't wait for the episode with pachise slot machines.

1287
01:05:37,460 --> 01:05:42,980
A dungeon Buster says, I can't wait for the episode when Belmont finds meat inside a wall

1288
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:43,980
and eats it.

1289
01:05:43,980 --> 01:05:48,660
Dan and I were talking about two and from the looks of it, it looks like it's actually

1290
01:05:48,660 --> 01:05:55,020
going to be based off of Castlevania three because we, for sure, we thought we saw Saifa

1291
01:05:55,020 --> 01:05:56,020
and Grant.

1292
01:05:56,020 --> 01:05:57,020
Yeah.

1293
01:05:57,020 --> 01:05:58,020
Grant.

1294
01:05:58,020 --> 01:05:59,660
I thought they had said, it's going to be counseling.

1295
01:05:59,660 --> 01:06:03,100
I thought they had said at some point, it's gonna be, I think that they did, but it was

1296
01:06:03,100 --> 01:06:06,220
more of a confirmation just to see the other characters there.

1297
01:06:06,220 --> 01:06:07,220
Sure.

1298
01:06:07,220 --> 01:06:11,180
Well, and just because something is inspired by something doesn't mean you're always going

1299
01:06:11,180 --> 01:06:12,980
to see it accurately represented.

1300
01:06:12,980 --> 01:06:14,620
Am I right?

1301
01:06:14,620 --> 01:06:18,220
So, but if you want to all see meat in the wall, I'm going to, I'm going to go a little

1302
01:06:18,220 --> 01:06:19,220
little.

1303
01:06:19,220 --> 01:06:20,220
It sounded dirty.

1304
01:06:20,220 --> 01:06:21,220
Didn't it?

1305
01:06:21,220 --> 01:06:22,580
I'm going to go a little bit deeper than that though.

1306
01:06:22,580 --> 01:06:23,580
Nevermind.

1307
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:28,820
There's a scene where Belmont kneels and a tornado picks them up and carries them away.

1308
01:06:28,820 --> 01:06:29,820
That's what I'm waiting for.

1309
01:06:29,820 --> 01:06:30,820
You think that'll be in the anime?

1310
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:34,780
I mean, I know it's the wrong Castlevania game, but there could still be a reference,

1311
01:06:34,780 --> 01:06:35,780
right?

1312
01:06:35,780 --> 01:06:36,780
Right.

1313
01:06:36,780 --> 01:06:37,780
Blink, blink.

1314
01:06:37,780 --> 01:06:38,780
You don't remember in Simon's quest you had to-

1315
01:06:38,780 --> 01:06:41,100
Yes, but Simon's quest wasn't great.

1316
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:42,100
What?

1317
01:06:42,100 --> 01:06:43,100
I love Simon's quest.

1318
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:44,660
I don't like the curse thing.

1319
01:06:44,660 --> 01:06:45,780
Oh my God.

1320
01:06:45,780 --> 01:06:48,180
It just felt like a completely different game.

1321
01:06:48,180 --> 01:06:49,180
First off-

1322
01:06:49,180 --> 01:06:51,180
The best of them is Dracula X.

1323
01:06:51,180 --> 01:06:54,500
Yes, but also one of the best soundtracks in the entire series.

1324
01:06:54,500 --> 01:07:01,300
Yeah, I had a good soundtrack, but still, I think that Dracula X was like the last actual

1325
01:07:01,300 --> 01:07:03,940
real Castlevania game.

1326
01:07:03,940 --> 01:07:06,860
Rage Nator in chat says, wouldn't wall meat be more of a hentai thing?

1327
01:07:06,860 --> 01:07:09,860
All right, look, when I drink, I choose my words less carefully.

1328
01:07:09,860 --> 01:07:11,900
I'm not going to bring up the glory hole references.

1329
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:12,900
Yeah.

1330
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:13,900
Come on, feels so good.

1331
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:16,860
Says, there's a place in San Francisco where you can find meat in the walls.

1332
01:07:16,860 --> 01:07:17,860
Yes.

1333
01:07:17,860 --> 01:07:18,860
Yes, I'm sure.

1334
01:07:18,860 --> 01:07:19,860
Yes, I'm sure.

1335
01:07:19,860 --> 01:07:20,860
You've been to that bathroom.

1336
01:07:21,540 --> 01:07:24,140
All right, moving on.

1337
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:36,060
Well, there is a teaser of sorts by Yotaka Saito, also goes by Ute, who is the person

1338
01:07:36,060 --> 01:07:39,940
who gave us Seaman for the Dreamcast.

1339
01:07:39,940 --> 01:07:41,180
Great.

1340
01:07:41,180 --> 01:07:44,700
From wall meat to, forget it.

1341
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:50,860
And he put out a tweet and it says, seemingly any project is being started.

1342
01:07:50,860 --> 01:07:51,860
Guess what?

1343
01:07:51,860 --> 01:07:52,860
From the web address on their back.

1344
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:55,380
Well, I couldn't read the address because it was really tiny.

1345
01:07:55,380 --> 01:07:56,380
I did.

1346
01:07:56,380 --> 01:07:57,380
And I found the webpage.

1347
01:07:57,380 --> 01:07:58,380
Oh.

1348
01:07:58,380 --> 01:08:02,380
It's, well, it's Seaman.ai.

1349
01:08:02,380 --> 01:08:04,020
Okay.

1350
01:08:04,020 --> 01:08:06,180
So it is Seaman.

1351
01:08:06,180 --> 01:08:10,860
And Seaman has become a bit of a joke on the show.

1352
01:08:10,860 --> 01:08:14,460
Oh yes, we love Seaman here at Orchons Radio.

1353
01:08:14,460 --> 01:08:19,100
We really, we really like Seaman here at O.L.R.

1354
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:21,300
We're so friendly.

1355
01:08:21,300 --> 01:08:27,340
For those not familiar with Seaman, please allow me to take this opportunity to edumacate

1356
01:08:27,340 --> 01:08:30,820
you with one of our favorite YouTubes on the subject.

1357
01:08:30,820 --> 01:08:36,060
And full credit for this goes to YouTube user Samination, who uploaded this video in April

1358
01:08:36,060 --> 01:08:37,420
of 2008.

1359
01:08:37,420 --> 01:08:39,060
So it's 10 years old.

1360
01:08:39,060 --> 01:08:44,260
But here's a little bit of Sam, I'm assuming his name is, here's a little bit of Sam interacting

1361
01:08:44,260 --> 01:08:45,900
with the fish.

1362
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:49,660
So you can hear Sam sounds a little tinny, like he's on a microphone, and the fish has

1363
01:08:49,660 --> 01:08:53,100
a very deep, vasey voice as Seaman did.

1364
01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:54,100
So here you go.

1365
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:55,980
A little bit of interaction here.

1366
01:08:55,980 --> 01:09:00,500
If my calculations are correct, you must be a Libra.

1367
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:04,460
I'll bet you get crushes on people all the time, huh?

1368
01:09:04,460 --> 01:09:07,300
Just don't get any ideas about me.

1369
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:09,500
Let's just be friends.

1370
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:11,500
For now.

1371
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:15,500
I'll friend your butt.

1372
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:18,500
Are you coming on to me?

1373
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:20,500
Yes.

1374
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:22,500
Yes!

1375
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:27,500
Put this tongue in that mouth.

1376
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:30,500
Dream on.

1377
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:36,500
So, obviously the technology's probably come a long way thanks to things like Siri and

1378
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:40,500
stuff like that, so if they do make a new Seaman game, I'm really interested to see

1379
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:44,500
Think of how sophisticated that is for the Dreamcast.

1380
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:48,500
Dude, we all know the Dreamcast was so fucking far ahead of its time.

1381
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:52,500
Things like Phantasy Star Online and what that brought to online gaming.

1382
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:55,500
The Dreamcast was ahead of its time, rest in peace.

1383
01:09:55,500 --> 01:10:00,500
But yeah, things like Siri and OK Google or all the other stuff.

1384
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:02,500
Whatever that stupid Alexa thing.

1385
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:07,500
Yeah, all that stuff is like, this is the oldest version of that.

1386
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:09,500
So it'd be kind of neat.

1387
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:15,500
As silly and as kitschus' game is, it would be cool to see it come back in this day and age.

1388
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:22,500
We also had, not too long after that, on the Nintendo 64, there was the Hey You Pikachu,

1389
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:24,500
or as it was in Japan, Pikachu Genki Dichu.

1390
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:26,500
Oh yeah, I forgot Hey You Pikachu.

1391
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:29,500
That's right, that was around the same time.

1392
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:33,500
Dark Tetsuya in chat says, I was just playing my Dreamcast.

1393
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:37,500
Granted, it was more Crazy Taxi than Seaman, but still.

1394
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:41,500
Anytime I ever hear an Offspring song, and it doesn't even have to be the one that was in Crazy Taxi,

1395
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:44,500
but anytime I hear an Offspring song, I think about the Dreamcast.

1396
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:46,500
Or Bad Religion.

1397
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:48,500
Well, it's more the...

1398
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:50,500
It's just that, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1399
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:52,500
Every time you hear that, it's like...

1400
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:55,500
Dexter's voice evokes the Dreamcast.

1401
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:57,500
Exactly.

1402
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:05,500
Alright, well, good luck to those that are producing Seaman remake right now.

1403
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:10,500
Yes, just don't drain your resources.

1404
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:12,500
That's right.

1405
01:11:12,500 --> 01:11:14,500
Loki, what's up next?

1406
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:20,500
So, you may remember we talked a little bit about this Xbox Game Pass subscription service that they're going to have,

1407
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:29,500
where you can play, I guess, older Xbox One and classic Xbox 360 titles on your Xbox One,

1408
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:31,500
with a paid subscription each month.

1409
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:35,500
So it was going to be $10 a month, and they would have different titles to play.

1410
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:37,500
Well, it's actually going to be launching pretty soon.

1411
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:40,500
It's coming June 1st, and you'll be able to check it out.

1412
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:46,500
They have a 14-day trial if you are an Xbox Live Gold member, which you probably are if you're playing multiplayer.

1413
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:52,500
However, Gold membership is not required for the service, just if you want to play multiplayer.

1414
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:55,500
And it's going to cost $9.99 a month.

1415
01:11:55,500 --> 01:12:02,500
So yeah, some of the titles they've got in there, it looks like Saints Row, Mad Max, some of the Bioshock games,

1416
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:06,500
Gears of War, the Mega Man collection, Halo 5.

1417
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:11,500
So, I mean, it looks like a pretty decent selection, and $9.99 is not bad.

1418
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:14,500
I mean, if I had an Xbox, maybe it might be worth it, but...

1419
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:21,500
I have not jumped on right away to check this out, but I am super tempted right now to take advantage of that trial,

1420
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:23,500
and jump in there and play a bunch of stuff.

1421
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:26,500
And it's not all streaming. Take note, Sony.

1422
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:32,500
You can download the games to your console, which, honestly, should be the way it works.

1423
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:35,500
Like, this PlayStation Now service thing? Stupid.

1424
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:38,500
Just put the damn emulators out there.

1425
01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:40,500
Alright, we'll see, we'll see.

1426
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:44,500
Alright, something to look forward to in the future.

1427
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:50,500
Well, maybe. I don't know if everybody's looking forward to this, but I think it could be interesting.

1428
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:55,500
It looks like we have confirmation that a Mario Cross Rabbids game is happening.

1429
01:12:55,500 --> 01:13:02,500
We had heard some rumors and some things out there previously that Nintendo was about to announce this when they unveiled the Switch,

1430
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:06,500
but this game ended up getting delayed behind the scenes to the fall,

1431
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:09,500
and so they didn't end up announcing this when they announced the Switch.

1432
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:12,500
But this looks like almost a certainty that this is something we're going to see at E3.

1433
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:18,500
So, yes, Mario Cross Rabbids does look like it's going to be real. Certainly, that art is out there.

1434
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:23,500
Some of the art has put in, and some of the other rumors that have been collected about this game so far.

1435
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:29,500
Apparently, there is exploration, which is about 35% of the game, and combat makes up 65% of the game.

1436
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:34,500
Note that this isn't Ubisoft's answer necessarily to Super Mario RPG.

1437
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:39,500
It is and it isn't, because the fighting in this game is supposed to be more tactical in style,

1438
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:43,500
so think something a little more Fire Emblem-ish or Final Fantasy Tactics

1439
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:47,500
than necessarily what you saw in Super Mario RPG and what Square Enix brought to the table.

1440
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:50,500
That's what the rumor is saying anyway with this so far.

1441
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:54,500
There are supposed to be four twisted Mario worlds that are filled with Easter eggs.

1442
01:13:54,500 --> 01:14:00,500
The characters that will be available in the game, Mario, Luigi, Peach, Yoshi,

1443
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:05,500
and Rabbids that are dressed up as Mario, Luigi, Peach, and Yoshi.

1444
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:10,500
And if you haven't seen the picture yet, there is a Rabbid that's dressed up as Peach

1445
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:14,500
that's pretty perfect taking a selfie and all this other silly stuff.

1446
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:20,500
The game is estimated to be about 20 hours long and you're supposed to be able to co-op in this game as well.

1447
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:21,500
That'll be pretty cool.

1448
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:26,500
Mario uses guns in the game, but when I see the gun, that looks like a bullet bill gun,

1449
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:29,500
so, you know, Mario guns. Don't think anything too crazy.

1450
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:31,500
Honestly, when I saw it, it reminded me of Mega Man.

1451
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:35,500
Oh, yeah, like the Mega Burst. It does a little bit. It does a little bit.

1452
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:42,500
Now, what I thought was interesting is that they describe the characters in one of these pieces of promo art,

1453
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:48,500
and they call Mario the leader, Luigi the eagle eye, Yoshi the explosive head.

1454
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:54,500
They call the princess the badass princess, which, look, she is a badass princess,

1455
01:14:54,500 --> 01:15:03,500
but I was just a little surprised that Nintendo let the word ass be used next to one of their characters.

1456
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:06,500
So I was just, that was a little surprising, that's all.

1457
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:13,500
And then the rabid princess says, hashtag sassy, hashtag no filter.

1458
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:15,500
It me.

1459
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:20,500
Anyway, so, yeah, I want to see some gameplay.

1460
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:24,500
I mean, all we know now is like rumors and some, you know, screenshots.

1461
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:27,500
Well, not even really screenshots, like one screenshot on this little mock-up with the Switch

1462
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:30,500
and some character mock-ups, but obviously there's much more to be seen,

1463
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:37,500
and this seems like almost a given for E3 at this point, and the Nintendo Direct that will be around that time.

1464
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:40,500
Or the Ubisoft. Well, probably Nintendo Direct.

1465
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:45,500
Yeah. Rama in chat says, the badass princess is Daisy, not Peach.

1466
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:49,500
Well, you know where Daisy is in this game, Rama? Nowhere to be seen.

1467
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:51,500
Womp womp.

1468
01:15:51,500 --> 01:15:54,500
Not yet, anyway. We'll see what happens at E3.

1469
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:56,500
That'd be thwomp thwomp.

1470
01:15:56,500 --> 01:15:58,500
Thwomp thwomp. I like that.

1471
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:00,500
Alright, moving on, Dark Saga.

1472
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:05,500
Mass Effect stuff, because it's not a show without Mass Effect references.

1473
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:11,500
For those of us who beat the game before there were any patches or anything,

1474
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:21,500
we had a hint to what happened to the Quarian arc, the Kila Sia, which also had Ilkor, Hanar, Drell, and Volus.

1475
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:24,500
That sounds like a disaster waiting to happen.

1476
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:26,500
Sounds like a party in space.

1477
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:30,500
That sounds like a major disaster. Anyway...

1478
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:33,500
Excited. Welcome to the party.

1479
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:46,500
Anyway, there was another mission that came out, one of the Apex missions, that had a result from it that says,

1480
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:48,500
and I don't care if it's a spoiler,

1481
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:54,500
Analysis trying to boost the signal, unknown if, and then text seems to be helping even if we don't know the blank,

1482
01:16:54,500 --> 01:16:57,500
back to Kila Sia, blank, way home.

1483
01:16:57,500 --> 01:17:03,500
Meaning that they're hinting very strongly at a DLC related to the Quarian arc.

1484
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:09,500
Of course, we don't know if that came out before or after they put the freeze on Mass Effect stuff,

1485
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:16,500
but I would hope that if they pushed it that much and made so many references to it, that they would follow through.

1486
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:24,500
Yeah, I mean, not to go too back to that place of negativity around all the rumored on-ice stuff with Mass Effect,

1487
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:29,500
but I would hope this game gets to see at least some of its DLC realized,

1488
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:36,500
so that whatever story they were trying to tell can kind of get the completion that it deserves.

1489
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:42,500
But maybe we'll see an Andromeda 2 in several years when they can hand it off to a different studio or something,

1490
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:47,500
and they figure out how they're going to rework that and erase the negativity that was out there on the internet,

1491
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:50,500
that I think was a little much, but what else is new?

1492
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:55,500
So far, the only actual Quarian reference we have besides this is the Regar Carbine.

1493
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:58,500
Bam. Which really isn't that great of a weapon.

1494
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:06,500
Plus, it would be nice if they could somehow introduce the Quarians and even some of these other races into the Andromeda universe,

1495
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:08,500
then multiplayer could expand with all that too.

1496
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:10,500
They can bring back the Quarian Engineer.

1497
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:13,500
That would be great. I love the Quarian Engineer.

1498
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:16,500
Anyway, we'll see what happens.

1499
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:20,500
Just a few more stories for you guys, then the classic game of the week.

1500
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:21,500
But first, Loki.

1501
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:27,500
So, this is kind of a stretch, but I will go ahead and cover it.

1502
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:32,500
It's a slow news week, so we're letting some things slip through this week.

1503
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:34,500
Alright, anyways.

1504
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:41,500
So, during the Webby Awards, I guess where Pokemon Go won the best mobile game and four other awards,

1505
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:54,500
the Product Marketing Lead, Arshit Bhargava, he had his acceptance speech or whatever,

1506
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:56,500
and the last thing he said was,

1507
01:18:56,500 --> 01:18:58,500
This summer will be legendary.

1508
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:01,500
Hint, hint, nudge, nudge, wink, wink.

1509
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:08,500
Which people think, oh my god, legendary Pokemon are coming this summer, oh my god.

1510
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:12,500
Well, if they're going to do it, this is the time to do it.

1511
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:21,500
Because summer being when all the kids are out of school, when the climate, at least here in the Northern Hemisphere, sorry Australia,

1512
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:26,500
is going to be, you know, really good weather to be going outside and playing all this stuff,

1513
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:29,500
this is the time to do it, if they're doing a legendary event.

1514
01:19:29,500 --> 01:19:35,500
Now, I thought they were going to do actual live events like Ingress does the live events,

1515
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:38,500
but those Ingress live events have been on hold.

1516
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:41,500
They haven't done them since, just so you guys know, because you guys may not, you know,

1517
01:19:41,500 --> 01:19:43,500
I know some of you still play Pokemon Go.

1518
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:47,500
Here's what's going on with their other game, Ingress, because a lot of this is really important.

1519
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:53,500
One, the engine that Ingress is written on is no longer supported, it's like a really old thing.

1520
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:58,500
So they're having to create an Ingress 2.0, it's being confirmed that that's happening,

1521
01:19:58,500 --> 01:20:03,500
we just don't know when, but they are building it in Unity, which is the same platform that Pokemon goes on.

1522
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:05,500
So, Ingress 2.0 is happening.

1523
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:11,500
And I think partially because of that, we have not seen an Ingress live event happen in the past six months.

1524
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:16,500
The last Ingress live events, and I actually went to one, was in Chicago in November.

1525
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:19,500
It was on Veterans Day last year. It's been that long.

1526
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:24,500
Now, just last weekend, because I had some friends that went to this,

1527
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:29,500
they did this thing called Magnus Reawakens in the Redwood Forest.

1528
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:33,500
So they did it out, which is funny because there's no cell signal out there.

1529
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:38,500
However, they had Wi-Fi, and they did this whole event, like it almost sounded like Nerd Burning Man in a way to me.

1530
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:42,500
It was out in the forest, and people were building portals.

1531
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:48,500
They brought artistic creations that were then turned into temporary portals on site.

1532
01:20:48,500 --> 01:20:51,500
I mean, all things considered, it actually sounded like a really rad thing,

1533
01:20:51,500 --> 01:20:54,500
and everybody who went that I knew had a great time.

1534
01:20:54,500 --> 01:20:57,500
I just didn't want to fucking go camping for three days, so I didn't go.

1535
01:20:57,500 --> 01:21:00,500
I was like, bring me back some stuff. They brought me back some nice stuff.

1536
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:03,500
For one, I'm going to hack the giant cock they just made.

1537
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:10,500
So anyway, I tell you all that because at the end of that, they announced, Niantic announced,

1538
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:16,500
anomalies are coming back, and here are all the cities for the rest of the year.

1539
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:20,500
So we know the anomalies now for Ingress through December 2nd.

1540
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:26,500
And I think the first wave, I think it all starts August 29th, question mark?

1541
01:21:26,500 --> 01:21:28,500
Any of them in our neighborhood?

1542
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:31,500
Yes, San Francisco on December 2nd is the closest.

1543
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:34,500
They haven't done one in Sacramento for a long, long time.

1544
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:37,500
But San Francisco is pretty good.

1545
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:45,500
So for us, San Francisco is the closest. Portland, Oregon is August's event.

1546
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:51,500
And Boulder, Colorado is in early November. Those are the West Coast events, basically.

1547
01:21:51,500 --> 01:22:01,500
Anyway, the reason why I say all that is because my assumption was that Niantic would do live events for Legendaries,

1548
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:04,500
because that's kind of the impression they gave us in that original trailer.

1549
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:11,500
Now, to be fair, how much of that original trailer stuff is actually Pokémon GO? Not much, right?

1550
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:15,500
So, you know, maybe they are going to do Legendaries just as an event that's available everywhere,

1551
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:20,500
because trying to do live events everywhere is going to be, I mean, you know,

1552
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:27,500
if they were to announce a live event for Legendaries in San Francisco, like, I don't think the city,

1553
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:32,500
the city of San Francisco could handle the amount of people that would show up.

1554
01:22:32,500 --> 01:22:34,500
Yes, there are that many people still playing Pokémon GO.

1555
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:40,500
And if like only San Francisco had this event, you'd have the entirety of like Northern and Southern California Pokémon GO players,

1556
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:43,500
and then some showing up. Like, it's way more than Ingress.

1557
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:48,500
So I wonder if they just, they are realizing that they can't do these live events for Pokémon GO.

1558
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:51,500
There's just too damn many people to play it. Still.

1559
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:57,500
Or, if, you know, again, the Ingress stuff isn't starting back up until August,

1560
01:22:57,500 --> 01:23:03,500
my assumption was that that's because probably 2.0 for Ingress is out during the summer.

1561
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:05,500
So you didn't reset everybody's stats on that stuff?

1562
01:23:05,500 --> 01:23:08,500
On Ingress? Oh, hell no. They're not going to reset people's stats.

1563
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:15,500
They're, people would up and leave. You know, they've sold codes that are in-game badges, things like that.

1564
01:23:15,500 --> 01:23:20,500
That has to carry over. They could expand the end game, they could make new agent levels, you know,

1565
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:23,500
and a new version of the scanner would make room for that.

1566
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:27,500
There's always been rumors about, ooh, what's going to be for level 24 and all that stuff.

1567
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:29,500
But, you know, that's all to be determined for Ingress.

1568
01:23:29,500 --> 01:23:33,500
Anyway, I don't mean to take this on and on just talking about Ingress,

1569
01:23:33,500 --> 01:23:37,500
but I think obviously the two do relate, being that it's a company that makes Pokémon GO.

1570
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:42,500
I just think that they're going to have to either do an event like they've been doing these other types of events

1571
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:51,500
that are just kind of for everybody, or maybe they will do a bunch of cities, you know, on a particular July

1572
01:23:51,500 --> 01:23:54,500
since, you know, the Ingress stuff doesn't start until August. I don't know.

1573
01:23:54,500 --> 01:23:58,500
What do you think, Logie? Do you think it's just going to be an event, or do you think we could actually have live events?

1574
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:03,500
They may try it, and if it fails, then they just won't do them anymore.

1575
01:24:03,500 --> 01:24:08,500
But I can't see it would be bad PR if, like, all of a sudden, you know, they do an event in San Francisco

1576
01:24:08,500 --> 01:24:12,500
and it just, like, clogs San Francisco. I mean, that's good PR right there.

1577
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:13,500
Yeah, right?

1578
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:16,500
That's just like, holy shit, you know, this is still popular.

1579
01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:20,500
Well, I remember when they did the Pokémon World Championships in San Francisco,

1580
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:24,500
they actually had to close it off to the public, and they said,

1581
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:29,500
nothing Pokémon GO will be happening here. Don't come if you're coming for Pokémon GO.

1582
01:24:29,500 --> 01:24:34,500
Because they were worried that there were people, there were rumors on the internet that,

1583
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:38,500
oh, the legendaries are going to spawn at the Pokémon World Championships,

1584
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:43,500
and people were already planning to go from very far away to be one of the first to catch a fuckup,

1585
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:47,500
because that was right at the hype of Pokémon GO hysteria was right during that time.

1586
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:48,500
Yeah.

1587
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:53,500
So they actually had to come out and say, if you're coming for Pokémon GO, don't come.

1588
01:24:53,500 --> 01:24:55,500
We win anyway.

1589
01:24:55,500 --> 01:24:59,500
But I had a good time. I had a good time. We shopped at the little Pokémon Center that they had set up there,

1590
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:01,500
and, you know, it was a good time.

1591
01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:07,500
Alright, anyway, so we'll see what ends up happening in Pokémon GO with legendary events,

1592
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:11,500
but I'm sure those seasonal events they've been doing have been working very well for them.

1593
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:16,500
Yeah, I like those. I'm not excited about the rock type one, but that's fine.

1594
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:21,500
I hope they do more of those, because those are kind of, like, after they end, it's like, ehhh.

1595
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:23,500
How about more fire ones? Hello, Charizard.

1596
01:25:23,500 --> 01:25:25,500
Yeah, fire event would be nice.

1597
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:27,500
That would seem like a gimme.

1598
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:31,500
DarkSakura was reminded to catch a Pokémon today, because I can see it on her phone.

1599
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:33,500
Oh, because there's a Rattata in your yard.

1600
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:35,500
Oh, well, thank you for...

1601
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:39,500
I've now made a vow to never catch another Paras. Ever.

1602
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:41,500
I don't want to.

1603
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:42,500
Because they are fucking...

1604
01:25:42,500 --> 01:25:43,500
Everywhere.

1605
01:25:43,500 --> 01:25:44,500
And terribad.

1606
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:45,500
Everywhere.

1607
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:49,500
Well, you know what else is everywhere, but it's actually kind of good, is Monster Hunter.

1608
01:25:49,500 --> 01:25:51,500
You like that transition?

1609
01:25:51,500 --> 01:25:55,500
Monster Hunter Double Cross, or Monster Hunter XX, if you will.

1610
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:59,500
This is going to be coming out on the Switch. That was announced this past week. That's pretty exciting.

1611
01:25:59,500 --> 01:26:05,500
We don't know the day, we don't know the pricing yet, but it will be coming out on the Nintendo Switch.

1612
01:26:05,500 --> 01:26:09,500
And, from what I understand, this is pretty interesting, because Shane and I were talking about it in the car the other day,

1613
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:13,500
and he was following this a little closer, because I don't get super into the Monster Hunter games,

1614
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:19,500
but he pointed out that the Monster Hunter on Switch is going to be able to talk to the 3DS version.

1615
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:25,500
And that's a pretty big reveal for a feature in the Switch, is the fact that it can play with 3DS people.

1616
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:29,500
So, hmm, who knows what that could bring for the future.

1617
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:32,500
It could just be a one-time thing, but it's worth putting out there.

1618
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:45,500
So, anyway, let's also talk about Ultra Street Fighter 2, the final challenge on the Nintendo Switch,

1619
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:51,500
which of course was released this past week, and I'm sorry, it is called Ultra Street Fighter 2, I don't know why, sorry guys.

1620
01:26:51,500 --> 01:26:54,500
All that stuff that Dark Soccer is giving me is starting to take hold.

1621
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:58,500
Anyway, so for Ultra Street Fighter 2, that just released this past week,

1622
01:26:58,500 --> 01:27:07,500
and there was some talk over on certain forums that talked about how well Capcom has actually said

1623
01:27:07,500 --> 01:27:13,500
that their future plans for the Switch can kind of hinge on the sales of Ultra Street Fighter 2.

1624
01:27:13,500 --> 01:27:19,500
And understandably, this pissed a lot of people off, because it's like, wow, way to set up your expectations for fucking failure,

1625
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:25,500
and all those things we pointed out at the beginning of the show about how, you know, 40 bucks for this is a pretty tough pill to swallow.

1626
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:32,500
However, the translation, as it was originally translated, was found to be a little erroneous.

1627
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:39,500
So, the official translation, or I guess not even official, but the retranslation, if you will, said something a little bit more like,

1628
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:45,500
we will plan our support while looking at the situation of the platform.

1629
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:52,500
So, not necessarily saying that the expectations are based on the sales of Street Fighter 2, but more keeping an eye on the Switch.

1630
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:59,500
You know, the fact that they're releasing Monster Hunter Double Cross on it is a little more promising,

1631
01:27:59,500 --> 01:28:06,500
because that's a game that will probably sell a little better, depending on how Monster Hunter can succeed here in the US.

1632
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:13,500
But, the game that really needs to be on the fucking Switch is that Disney Afternoon Collection.

1633
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:16,500
Why is that still not on the Switch?

1634
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:20,500
Anyway, let's see, going to our chat.

1635
01:28:20,500 --> 01:28:26,500
Dartusuya says that Monster Hunter Double Cross has been dated, it's August 25th, at least in Japan.

1636
01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:35,500
YYR says, there was a NeoGAF thread called, which will sell more copies, Street Fighter 5 or Ultra Street Fighter 2?

1637
01:28:36,500 --> 01:28:43,500
I'm going to say Street Fighter 5, because you can already get it on sale cheaper than you can get Ultra Street Fighter 2.

1638
01:28:43,500 --> 01:28:45,500
And that's saying something right there.

1639
01:28:45,500 --> 01:28:58,500
And I understand that it came out earlier, but you're talking to Street Fighter that they just basically shoehorned a couple of characters in there that are really kind of, eh, it's not like a big deal or anything.

1640
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:04,500
They're reskins, it's Evil Ryu and Violent Ken, they're just reskins, it's nothing that special.

1641
01:29:04,500 --> 01:29:06,500
It just doesn't seem worth the money.

1642
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:20,500
And let's assume that the translation wasn't incorrect, then I think it's a stupid thing to hinge all your bets on the system based off one game that's really a port of a really old game.

1643
01:29:20,500 --> 01:29:22,500
Well, but if it's not what they said, then they didn't sell it.

1644
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:25,500
Yeah, I understand that, but I know Konami in the past have done this.

1645
01:29:25,500 --> 01:29:32,500
That's true, there have been other companies that have said, well, if this game doesn't sell, then I guess we're done.

1646
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:36,500
You're right, and Konami's been one of those companies when it comes to some of the music games.

1647
01:29:36,500 --> 01:29:42,500
And it's always shitty. Well, you know what, it's not up to, you're the one that has to make those decisions.

1648
01:29:42,500 --> 01:29:51,500
It's not up to the consumer to decide, you know, if you're going to support a platform, it's a gaming platform if you just choose not to support it because of whatever.

1649
01:29:51,500 --> 01:29:56,500
It's not going to be because people didn't buy your fucking old ass game that you ported to the system for way too much money.

1650
01:29:57,500 --> 01:30:08,500
And this can't be stressed enough, and we said this all the time when it came to Konami and their subpar releases of like DDR in the US and BeatMania and all that stuff is, you have to take a risk to get a reward.

1651
01:30:08,500 --> 01:30:23,500
You have to. If you take these low risk things and you go, oh, people will buy it anyway because, no, these low risk things, which Ultra Street Fighter 2 I think falls in that category, are going to open themselves up more to this, you know, bullshit on the internet.

1652
01:30:23,500 --> 01:30:29,500
Yeah, look at some of the stuff they did with the Wii. Tatsunoko vs Capcom. That was a game that was exclusive to that platform.

1653
01:30:29,500 --> 01:30:42,500
Yeah. I mean, that was pretty advantageous. Do another one of those. I mean, that would be pretty exciting. That's a brand new game. It was a different engine. It ran on the Wii, so you can't tell me that that shit does not run on the fucking Switch.

1654
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:56,500
And yes, I understand that fucking that was a licensed game with Tatsunoko or whatever, but take that engine and make a Street Fighter game out of it or something, or do something crazy with it. Put some other Capcom characters in there.

1655
01:30:56,500 --> 01:31:07,500
Do another Street Fighter vs Capcom game or something. You can make it exclusive. Put some effort into it. And that would be worth $40 or even $60 if it's a really good game.

1656
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:17,500
Not this, oh hey, it's a Street Fighter 2. Yeah, people love it. Yeah, people have purchased that game probably dozens of times. They don't need to purchase it again to play.

1657
01:31:17,500 --> 01:31:28,500
I mean, let's play this way. If you purchase a 3DS and you purchase Street Fighter 4 3D with it, how often did you play that against other people? I mean, just look at that.

1658
01:31:28,500 --> 01:31:35,500
I mean, this is probably how much you're going to use this system to play Street Fighter 2. Yeah, you may do it for a while, but then newer shit's going to come out and people are going to stop playing it.

1659
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:42,500
And that's what's going to happen. It's not worth the $40. $20? Then that might be alright. $40? No, I don't think so.

1660
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:53,500
Alright. Well, you know what? Let's take a trip down memory lane, you guys. Let's take a trip back. Back to when we paid $80 for Street Fighter 2 on the Super Nintendo.

1661
01:31:53,500 --> 01:32:02,500
And we fucking liked it. We loved it. It was legendary. Now, that's not the classic game of the week this week. Probably because that was done years and years ago.

1662
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:09,500
However, Dark Sakura's going to step into the gaming vault and find another game that she thinks, hey, you know what? You should respect this game.

1663
01:32:09,500 --> 01:32:19,500
And by respect, that means don't charge $40 for it on Switch. Right, Dark Sakura? Yes, and it's an oldie. This is a very oldie game this week. Yeah.

1664
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:32,500
The game I picked is Radar Scope by Nintendo, which was released in Japan December 1979. And we got it almost a year later in 1980, November in the US.

1665
01:32:32,500 --> 01:32:46,500
Radar Scope was a fairly early arcade game. You can tell from the ear. And the noise. But it wasn't Nintendo's first arcade game.

1666
01:32:46,500 --> 01:32:56,500
It was a shooter that kind of can be considered a cross between Space Invaders and Galaxian. It's kind of on a tilted plane.

1667
01:32:56,500 --> 01:33:06,500
And it had three different cabinets. You had an upright, a cockpit, and a cocktail. It really wasn't that popular. It was considered a failure.

1668
01:33:06,500 --> 01:33:21,500
But it is, I think, relatively unique for all of the little alien shooters that were out of that time. Because in the early days of gaming, I mean, really you just had more of the same kind of game for a while.

1669
01:33:21,500 --> 01:33:27,500
Until someone would make an innovation, release a certain type of game, and then you would have more games like it that played on the theme.

1670
01:33:27,500 --> 01:33:37,500
So we had Space Fighters for a long time, you know. But anyway, this was also the first game that Miyamoto helped develop.

1671
01:33:38,500 --> 01:33:51,500
It had the big innovation. It was the three-dimensional third-person perspective that was also used later in games like Juno First by Konami and Beam Rider by Activision.

1672
01:33:51,500 --> 01:34:05,500
And this game was actually considered second only to Pac-Man in Japan in popularity for a while. Even though it wasn't considered, you know, successful commercially.

1673
01:34:05,500 --> 01:34:14,500
But Donkey Kong was released on Radarscope's hardware. And it used surplus Radarscope cabinets.

1674
01:34:14,500 --> 01:34:24,500
So kind of interesting how this ties into other things that came later by Nintendo.

1675
01:34:24,500 --> 01:34:38,500
The earlier Nintendo games were EVR Space, Computer Othello, Sheriff that was released in the US by Exedy as Bandito, Space Fever, and Space Firebird.

1676
01:34:38,500 --> 01:34:46,500
So anyways, as far as the game, you have to defend your station against enemy spaceships.

1677
01:34:47,500 --> 01:34:57,500
And they attack and then go back into formation, kind of like Galaxian, and you have to destroy the 48 ships before you lose your space ports.

1678
01:34:57,500 --> 01:35:13,500
You also have rapid fire laser blasters that zooms the lasers onto this field so that it's kind of like a semi three-dimensional field of curved vectors that can shoot the enemies down.

1679
01:35:13,500 --> 01:35:20,500
And your laser blasters have a damage meter that light up as, you know, they're damaged and bingo.

1680
01:35:20,500 --> 01:35:29,500
And it also will weaken your offensive ability and you gain ability by attacking and destroying the enemies.

1681
01:35:29,500 --> 01:35:34,500
And like I said, the game was popular for a short while in Japan.

1682
01:35:35,500 --> 01:35:42,500
And the president of Nintendo of America at that time wanted a large order for it.

1683
01:35:42,500 --> 01:35:51,500
By the time it arrived in New York, the buzz kind of de-buzzed. It sobered.

1684
01:35:51,500 --> 01:35:55,500
And then no one really wanted to play it.

1685
01:35:55,500 --> 01:36:01,500
And on top of that, as you can hear this chirping sound in the background on the game, it kind of annoyed people.

1686
01:36:01,500 --> 01:36:05,500
Yeah, it's not the most audio friendly yet, but again, you have to consider the year.

1687
01:36:05,500 --> 01:36:14,500
This is before, this was 1980, right? This is what? This is at least like five years before doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

1688
01:36:14,500 --> 01:36:17,500
So, you know, older.

1689
01:36:17,500 --> 01:36:27,500
Well, basically they were left with so many unsold units after this that Nintendo was actually heading toward a financial crash.

1690
01:36:28,500 --> 01:36:38,500
So, the president at the time, his name was Minoru Arakawa, he reached out to his father-in-law who was Nintendo's CEO.

1691
01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:42,500
By the way, this was the president of Nintendo of America, not Nintendo Japan.

1692
01:36:42,500 --> 01:36:47,500
His father-in-law was the CEO of Nintendo in general.

1693
01:36:48,500 --> 01:36:58,500
Basically, he begged for a new game that could come out, so that's when it was put out to make another game using that hardware.

1694
01:36:58,500 --> 01:37:05,500
Pretty much to convert it. And so, Miyamoto's idea was chosen and that became Donkey Kong.

1695
01:37:05,500 --> 01:37:09,500
So, they released them. A lot of them were via conversion kits.

1696
01:37:09,500 --> 01:37:21,500
So, basically of the 3,000 units that were created for a radar scope, 2,000 of them got converted to Donkey Kong.

1697
01:37:21,500 --> 01:37:26,500
And you can tell which ones are converted because of the red cabinets.

1698
01:37:26,500 --> 01:37:30,500
So, if you find one with a red cabinet, chances are it was converted radar scope.

1699
01:37:30,500 --> 01:37:36,500
And there you go. If not for this game, there would be no Donkey Kong.

1700
01:37:36,500 --> 01:37:42,500
This game has that classic Nintendo font. I don't know how else to describe it.

1701
01:37:42,500 --> 01:37:52,500
The way things are written and the hardware, it is very similar to what you see in the later Nintendo games like Donkey Kong.

1702
01:37:52,500 --> 01:37:55,500
That kind of semi-rounded pixelated.

1703
01:37:55,500 --> 01:37:58,500
Yeah, it has a very distinct look to it, I think.

1704
01:37:58,500 --> 01:38:03,500
I wanted to bring this up because Donkey Kong is considered one of the major classics.

1705
01:38:03,500 --> 01:38:04,500
Sure.

1706
01:38:04,500 --> 01:38:07,500
But would it have existed if this game hadn't failed?

1707
01:38:07,500 --> 01:38:10,500
Great question. Awesome. Well, thank you for that.

1708
01:38:10,500 --> 01:38:13,500
Alright, there it is. Your classic game of the week.

1709
01:38:13,500 --> 01:38:17,500
We are going to take a quick break. When we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio,

1710
01:38:17,500 --> 01:38:22,500
we're going to talk a little bit more about Donkey Kong because there's a very interesting something something happening.

1711
01:38:22,500 --> 01:38:23,500
Donkey Kang.

1712
01:38:23,500 --> 01:38:29,500
Donkey Kang and Princess Zordla. We'll be talking about that when we come back.

1713
01:38:29,500 --> 01:38:33,500
You know that meme is fake as hell. That did not actually happen on Jeopardy. I hope you all know.

1714
01:38:33,500 --> 01:38:35,500
It's on Snopes if you want to look it up. But anyway.

1715
01:38:35,500 --> 01:38:36,500
It's so funny.

1716
01:38:36,500 --> 01:38:40,500
We'll talk a little bit about Far Cry 5 because I know there's been a lot of talk about that.

1717
01:38:40,500 --> 01:38:47,500
And we're going to talk about, Dark Soccer's going to be excited about this, a new soundtrack of an old game on an old medium.

1718
01:38:47,500 --> 01:38:48,500
That I can't afford.

1719
01:38:48,500 --> 01:38:53,500
That you can't afford. But, you know, maybe she starts collecting the biddies on Twitch.

1720
01:38:53,500 --> 01:38:54,500
She could afford it in five years.

1721
01:38:54,500 --> 01:38:55,500
I have no idea what that is.

1722
01:38:55,500 --> 01:38:56,500
It's fine.

1723
01:38:56,500 --> 01:39:00,500
I don't Twitch. Although I will be going back to doing the next installment of How to a Full Boyfriend.

1724
01:39:00,500 --> 01:39:01,500
You got to start somewhere. Yes, start somewhere.

1725
01:39:01,500 --> 01:39:05,500
Alright, when we come back. And more vodka because my glass is now empty, y'all.

1726
01:39:05,500 --> 01:39:10,500
If you can't already tell. When we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

1727
01:39:10,500 --> 01:39:22,500
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio Memorial Day Weekend Edition.

1728
01:39:22,500 --> 01:39:27,500
This is Episode 688 for May 28th of 2017.

1729
01:39:27,500 --> 01:39:31,500
If you're just joining us live at the Voice of Geeks Network, being that it is a three-day weekend,

1730
01:39:31,500 --> 01:39:40,500
we're partaking a little bit in some beverages of an adult kind, including this 7-Up or Sprite, whatever,

1731
01:39:40,500 --> 01:39:46,500
same thing, mixed with this ginger vodka that Dark Soccer makes that is amazing when it's mixed together.

1732
01:39:46,500 --> 01:39:50,500
It tastes like ginger beer, but it's fucking me up. It's great. I like this. So, kudos.

1733
01:39:50,500 --> 01:39:52,500
It was a little bit too strong for me.

1734
01:39:52,500 --> 01:39:54,500
I love strong ginger.

1735
01:39:54,500 --> 01:39:55,500
It was one of my experiments.

1736
01:39:55,500 --> 01:39:56,500
Yeah.

1737
01:39:56,500 --> 01:40:00,500
And I can eat crystallized ginger, but the vodka came out, like that first drink, it burns.

1738
01:40:00,500 --> 01:40:01,500
Yeah.

1739
01:40:01,500 --> 01:40:02,500
And then it's sweet.

1740
01:40:02,500 --> 01:40:04,500
Well, I think the mixing helped. You tried it mixed. I think that helps a lot.

1741
01:40:04,500 --> 01:40:05,500
I did. It was pretty good.

1742
01:40:05,500 --> 01:40:08,500
Yeah. I tried a little bit of your other one that you talked about earlier, the Violet one.

1743
01:40:08,500 --> 01:40:09,500
The Parma Violet?

1744
01:40:09,500 --> 01:40:13,500
Yeah. That wasn't bad, but it was just like, I really just wanted more ginger.

1745
01:40:13,500 --> 01:40:15,500
It's probably a little more froofy in flavor.

1746
01:40:15,500 --> 01:40:17,500
Yeah. A little bit. A little bit.

1747
01:40:17,500 --> 01:40:18,500
Well, I will make you more of this.

1748
01:40:18,500 --> 01:40:19,500
Yeah.

1749
01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:20,500
I'll make you a lot more of it if you want.

1750
01:40:20,500 --> 01:40:23,500
Well, I appreciate that. Thank you very much. So, um-

1751
01:40:23,500 --> 01:40:24,500
And of course, candy corn.

1752
01:40:24,500 --> 01:40:26,500
Yeah, the candy corn one. I haven't touched it yet.

1753
01:40:26,500 --> 01:40:28,500
I wonder if the candy corn and the ginger would be good together.

1754
01:40:28,500 --> 01:40:32,500
Uh, we won't find out because I may have just finished off the ginger.

1755
01:40:32,500 --> 01:40:33,500
Oops.

1756
01:40:33,500 --> 01:40:35,500
There's a little bit left. There's a little bit. Probably enough for a shot.

1757
01:40:35,500 --> 01:40:38,500
I'll need to take the jar home then if you're going to finish it tonight.

1758
01:40:38,500 --> 01:40:39,500
Yeah, no worries.

1759
01:40:39,500 --> 01:40:40,500
Okay.

1760
01:40:40,500 --> 01:40:43,500
So anyway, I had to ask Darksire. I'm like, oh, I'm not drinking too much because I don't know how strong this stuff is.

1761
01:40:43,500 --> 01:40:46,500
This would be deceptively strong stuff, but I'm, I'm definitely feeling buzzed.

1762
01:40:46,500 --> 01:40:52,500
I don't think I'm at that like full on like point yet, which is probably good because, you know, I am still trying to do a radio show.

1763
01:40:52,500 --> 01:40:54,500
But yeah, I'm feeling, I'm feeling pretty good.

1764
01:40:54,500 --> 01:41:01,500
Uh, something else I'm feeling good about. So for the first time, uh, this past weekend, I didn't talk about this yet, but I got to do,

1765
01:41:01,500 --> 01:41:06,500
because it was our, our pal Shane's birthday a few days ago, so he wanted to do an escape room for his birthday.

1766
01:41:06,500 --> 01:41:10,500
So I got to do an escape room for the first time. We went to a place all the way in San Jose.

1767
01:41:10,500 --> 01:41:14,500
I don't know why. Well, I know why we couldn't do one here because Shane researched.

1768
01:41:14,500 --> 01:41:21,500
He said, I only want to do an escape room if it's a multi-room and you don't, you're not, you don't have somebody in there with you.

1769
01:41:21,500 --> 01:41:26,500
And like all this other stuff that's this monitor through cameras. So he found this place to go to, so I got to do an escape room for the first time.

1770
01:41:26,500 --> 01:41:31,500
I got to say it was a lot of fun. Like it was, uh, it was like four different rooms. It was like a room.

1771
01:41:31,500 --> 01:41:36,500
Then we went into like a hallway and then there was like two more rooms after that.

1772
01:41:36,500 --> 01:41:42,500
And there were some puzzles we had to solve and they were, they were kind of tough. Like, uh, we had to get a hint on the last one.

1773
01:41:42,500 --> 01:41:48,500
Um, you, you were allowed to use one hint in each room you went into and we didn't use a hint up until the very last room.

1774
01:41:48,500 --> 01:41:53,500
And it was one of those things where it was like, I was coming to that conclusion, but we only had five minutes left.

1775
01:41:53,500 --> 01:42:01,500
But with the, uh, with the hint, we got out of there with two minutes to spare. So that was exciting. So, but yeah, I got to do my first escape room experience. Cool.

1776
01:42:01,500 --> 01:42:08,500
It was cool because it was like, you had the cool, like you had like, if you got the code, you put it in the number pad and when you hit the number pad, the lights would change.

1777
01:42:08,500 --> 01:42:12,500
And then when you were like stepping on certain platforms, the gate would open to let you in the next room.

1778
01:42:12,500 --> 01:42:19,500
Like there was just like, there was cool, like James Bond shit like that. And that's what I was hoping for in my escape rooms. So it was, it was a good time.

1779
01:42:19,500 --> 01:42:27,500
Yeah, it was kind of, it was like doing a video game, but IRL and pretty serious puzzles. All right, let's get into some, uh, rapid fire news.

1780
01:42:27,500 --> 01:42:33,500
Actually, I want to mention our chat over at live.vognetwork.com. Vidpower mentions escape room designers always amaze me.

1781
01:42:33,500 --> 01:42:41,500
You know, if I remember right, Vidpower lives in Las Vegas. And I was just thinking, Shane was saying that the escape rooms he's done, he hasn't done any that are as good as the ones in Las Vegas.

1782
01:42:41,500 --> 01:42:48,500
I'm thinking, oh, Orlando's theme park center. You're not going to find anything better than there. I bet Las Vegas has some killer escape rooms.

1783
01:42:48,500 --> 01:42:55,500
I'll have to, I'll have to look into that. We'll see. Anyway, uh, yeah. Brad from Pop Culture says, sounds cool. Yeah, it was a good time. Good time.

1784
01:42:55,500 --> 01:42:58,500
All right. Uh, let's get into some rapid fire news. Loki.

1785
01:42:58,500 --> 01:43:05,500
So Grand Theft Auto online has been expanding and expanding and expanding and more expansions. Well, there's even more expansions coming.

1786
01:43:06,500 --> 01:43:16,500
This time they're going to be adding Gunrunning. So you'll be able to add that to your criminal enterprise as a way to diversify your cash income.

1787
01:43:16,500 --> 01:43:23,500
So what they're going to have along with that, apparently they're going to have these different hatches.

1788
01:43:23,500 --> 01:43:29,500
So they're mysterious properties that you'll find, I guess, with the Maze Bank foreclosure sites.

1789
01:43:29,500 --> 01:43:41,500
And there's like some underground warehouses, stuff that you can purchase and they even have like weapon ranges you can check out your different guns with.

1790
01:43:41,500 --> 01:43:50,500
And they're even seeing your military grade vehicles. Um, so that's all very cool. And of course, like all the other DLC that they've had for Grand Theft Auto online, it's free.

1791
01:43:50,500 --> 01:44:01,500
So I got to check that out. I still haven't gotten back to Grand Theft Auto online. I'm kind of not sure. I don't know if I can import my progress from when I was playing a console because I think I'm too late for that.

1792
01:44:01,500 --> 01:44:10,500
But it'll be kind of fun to go back. And I remember it's kind of a grindy affair, but now they have a lot more things you can do. So it'd be interesting to see how that all works now.

1793
01:44:11,500 --> 01:44:23,500
Alright. And then, um, this is kind of cool. So they're going to be getting a game, or there's a game called The Culling, which is coming out pretty soon here on Xbox One.

1794
01:44:23,500 --> 01:44:32,500
And I guess it's just recently, well within the last year, released on Steam Early Access. But The Culling is kind of a battle royale type game.

1795
01:44:32,500 --> 01:44:43,500
So basically you have 16 players that are pit against each other with guns, melee weapons, and traps, and all sorts of stuff. And it's like a battle royale format.

1796
01:44:43,500 --> 01:44:52,500
But yeah, it'll be coming to Xbox One on June 2nd as part of our Xbox Game Preview program. That's our kind of early access equivalent there.

1797
01:44:52,500 --> 01:45:04,500
But yeah, it'll be interesting to check that out. Too bad I don't have an Xbox One. But I guess I could pick up the Steam version if I wanted to. So yeah, that's it.

1798
01:45:04,500 --> 01:45:09,500
I think I would play that because I like battle royale. Sounds like fun.

1799
01:45:09,500 --> 01:45:16,500
I hear that some people didn't take kindly to all the changes in that game though, but I guess the game's getting a second chance on Xbox.

1800
01:45:16,500 --> 01:45:17,500
Yeah.

1801
01:45:17,500 --> 01:45:23,500
Alright, well let's move on and talk about Red Dead Redemption 2. I know that's a game the Loki's probably looking forward to.

1802
01:45:23,500 --> 01:45:24,500
Yep, I am looking forward to it.

1803
01:45:24,500 --> 01:45:32,500
Well, you'll have to look forward a little longer because it's been pushed back to spring of 2018. But again, it better they do that and have a good game.

1804
01:45:32,500 --> 01:45:38,500
If there's a company I'm going to trust with delays on games, it's going to be Rockstar Games. So I'm perfectly okay with that.

1805
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:44,500
So there it is. It was originally planned for fall of 2017 and in a message they said,

1806
01:45:44,500 --> 01:45:51,500
This Outlaw epic set across the vast and unforgiving American heartland will be the first Rockstar game created from the ground up for the latest generation of console hardware.

1807
01:45:51,500 --> 01:45:56,500
And they released screenshots for that game. It looks fantastic.

1808
01:45:56,500 --> 01:46:01,500
And says some extra time is necessary to ensure that we can deliver the best experience possible for our fans.

1809
01:46:01,500 --> 01:46:08,500
We're sorry for any disappointment the delay causes, but we're firm believers in delivering a game only when it's ready.

1810
01:46:08,500 --> 01:46:14,500
We're excited to bring you more details about the game this summer. In the meantime, please enjoy this selection of new screenshots from Red Dead Redemption 2.

1811
01:46:14,500 --> 01:46:17,500
Too bad it's not coming out on PC, though. At launch, at least.

1812
01:46:17,500 --> 01:46:21,500
Well, I wonder if they'll just do a delay like they've done for the other games.

1813
01:46:21,500 --> 01:46:28,500
Well, you know, the Xbox, or when they did the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions, that's when the PC version came out for that.

1814
01:46:28,500 --> 01:46:32,500
That was a good year later, so I don't know. Still kind of disappointing.

1815
01:46:32,500 --> 01:46:37,500
ActDeftInChat says, Rockstar and delays in the same sentence. Color me surprised.

1816
01:46:37,500 --> 01:46:39,500
Glad it's worth it, though.

1817
01:46:39,500 --> 01:46:44,500
So if you have a Samsung TV that's been having a hard time with a Nintendo Switch, some good news for you.

1818
01:46:44,500 --> 01:46:49,500
Samsung is apparently going to be releasing a firmware update for their TVs.

1819
01:46:49,500 --> 01:46:55,500
Samsung TVs feature an automatic HDMI switching system that swap between channels when devices are in use.

1820
01:46:55,500 --> 01:47:04,500
But because of the way the Switch is designed, the TV can kind of switch back and forth between the Switch and whatever else is going when the console is docked.

1821
01:47:04,500 --> 01:47:07,500
Now the weird thing is I have a Samsung TV and this doesn't happen to me.

1822
01:47:07,500 --> 01:47:15,500
I actually do love the fact, though, that when I put the Switch in, it does switch right over to HDMI 2 where I have it plugged in and it goes right to it.

1823
01:47:15,500 --> 01:47:19,500
I like that. I don't have the same problem, but I've certainly been hearing that feedback from other people.

1824
01:47:19,500 --> 01:47:22,500
It must just be certain types of televisions.

1825
01:47:22,500 --> 01:47:32,500
So anyway, they are monitoring the feedback on the community thread and they are going to do a firmware update early this summer to address the behavior and provide the level of convenience that was intended.

1826
01:47:32,500 --> 01:47:37,500
So that is some good news for folks that have been annoyed with their TVs constantly switching on them.

1827
01:47:37,500 --> 01:47:41,500
ActDeft is saying, My TV is also Samsung. I haven't gotten that problem.

1828
01:47:41,500 --> 01:47:48,500
I've definitely heard from people that do get it. I think it's just probably what type of Samsung TV you have, maybe what year you bought it or what have you.

1829
01:47:48,500 --> 01:47:50,500
Moving on to Dark Sakura.

1830
01:47:50,500 --> 01:47:58,500
Well, Titanfall 2 is getting a new Titan and a new map next week. Hooray!

1831
01:47:58,500 --> 01:48:06,500
They have said that on the 30th that's going to come out and of course this content will be free.

1832
01:48:06,500 --> 01:48:15,500
The new Titan is called Monarch, who is a mid-range Vanguard class that can self-upgrade. So interesting.

1833
01:48:15,500 --> 01:48:25,500
And then in other news, we're going to be getting a classic Street Fighter 2 stage in Street Fighter 5.

1834
01:48:25,500 --> 01:48:40,500
On May 30th, that means Vegas, as he was in Japan, Balrog, his stage with the fence in the background that he can climb on will be coming back.

1835
01:48:40,500 --> 01:48:50,500
And there will be some different changes and of course, Ed. And there you go.

1836
01:48:51,500 --> 01:48:58,500
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at VoGnetwork.com, use the passphrase, shake.

1837
01:48:58,500 --> 01:49:05,500
Alright, let's travel around and check out what is coming out in stores this week. What hasn't been delayed and will actually be on shelves this week?

1838
01:49:06,500 --> 01:49:14,500
Quite a bit actually. So we've got coming out on the Nintendo Switch, Astro Duel Deluxe on PlayStation 4 and PC.

1839
01:49:14,500 --> 01:49:22,500
We have Danger Zone, MXGP3, the official motocross video game on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

1840
01:49:22,500 --> 01:49:27,500
Star Trek Bridge Crew on the Vive, the Rift, and the PlayStation VR.

1841
01:49:27,500 --> 01:49:39,500
Ease Origin on PlayStation Vita. We have Episode 5 of Season 3 of The Walking Dead on PC, Mac, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, iOS, and Android.

1842
01:49:39,500 --> 01:49:50,500
Don't Knock Twice on the Vive and the Rift. And then we have Seiken Detsetsu Collection on the Switch.

1843
01:49:51,500 --> 01:50:00,500
And Tekken 7 on the PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. That is it.

1844
01:50:00,500 --> 01:50:04,500
Let's go to the UK. Dark Sakura.

1845
01:50:04,500 --> 01:50:13,500
I wish. This kind of sucks over here. On the 30th, we have Crossout for PlayStation 4, Xbox One on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1846
01:50:13,500 --> 01:50:19,500
Also, we have Oh, Sir! The Insult Simulator. Or is that like Shade the Game? I don't know.

1847
01:50:19,500 --> 01:50:28,500
On the 31st, we have First Strike Final Hour for Mac and PC. And on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, we have Tokyo 42.

1848
01:50:28,500 --> 01:50:40,500
Now, in June, the first few days of June, just on the 2nd, we have Tekken 7 for PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

1849
01:50:40,500 --> 01:50:42,500
And Seifani.

1850
01:50:42,500 --> 01:50:50,500
Alright, heading over to Japan and checking out the releases there. On the 1st of June, a little game you might have heard of called Tekken 7.

1851
01:50:50,500 --> 01:50:55,500
It's coming out on the PlayStation 4 over there. I mean, Dark Sakura did just mention it, as did Loki.

1852
01:50:55,500 --> 01:51:01,500
But, you know, Tekken, the Tekken series, Dark Sakura, are you interested in Tekken 7 or are we kind of over Tekken at this point?

1853
01:51:01,500 --> 01:51:03,500
I kind of got burned after Tekken 4.

1854
01:51:03,500 --> 01:51:04,500
Yeah?

1855
01:51:04,500 --> 01:51:05,500
Yeah.

1856
01:51:06,500 --> 01:51:11,500
If they had kept the way that Jin handled, as he did in Tekken 3, then I would have been happy.

1857
01:51:11,500 --> 01:51:12,500
Akuma's in there.

1858
01:51:12,500 --> 01:51:16,500
It might be a time to just give it a shot. Give it a shot. Who knows.

1859
01:51:16,500 --> 01:51:17,500
I'll take a shot.

1860
01:51:17,500 --> 01:51:23,500
Alright, on the Vita, a game called Shin is coming out, as well as Sukitomo Sukiuta, 12 Memories.

1861
01:51:23,500 --> 01:51:32,500
Both are out on the Vita this week in Japan. And checking the Switch and the 3DS real quick, the Switch does have, of course, the Sekendetsu collection is out in Japan this week.

1862
01:51:32,500 --> 01:51:36,500
I have a feeling some of you guys are going to be importing that. That is out on June the 1st.

1863
01:51:36,500 --> 01:51:40,500
And on the Nintendo 3DS, some price reductions.

1864
01:51:40,500 --> 01:51:43,500
Tales of the Abyss goes into the Welcome Price from Bandai Namco.

1865
01:51:43,500 --> 01:51:47,500
And another Bandai Namco game going into the Welcome Price getting a price reduction.

1866
01:51:47,500 --> 01:51:53,500
Ridge Racer 3D gets a price reduction this week in the Welcome Price collection.

1867
01:51:53,500 --> 01:51:57,500
And I'm thinking in my mind, wasn't that like a launch game on 3DS?

1868
01:51:57,500 --> 01:52:03,500
Like, that game is old. But it's about time, I guess, that that gets a Welcome Price there.

1869
01:52:03,500 --> 01:52:06,500
Maybe it finally sold however many copies they need to do that.

1870
01:52:06,500 --> 01:52:10,500
Alright, let's go to the mailbag. Every week you guys email us.

1871
01:52:10,500 --> 01:52:13,500
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1872
01:52:13,500 --> 01:52:16,500
It's the place where you can participate with the show.

1873
01:52:16,500 --> 01:52:21,500
Dark Soccer dives in the mailbag head first, and this week she found a bunch of air.

1874
01:52:21,500 --> 01:52:23,500
And one. There was one.

1875
01:52:23,500 --> 01:52:27,500
One lowly postcard lying at the bottom of the empty mailbag.

1876
01:52:27,500 --> 01:52:29,500
Let's get to the mailbag, Dark Soccer.

1877
01:52:29,500 --> 01:52:32,500
Hey, OLR. I hope all is well.

1878
01:52:32,500 --> 01:52:33,500
It doesn't suck.

1879
01:52:33,500 --> 01:52:34,500
It doesn't suck.

1880
01:52:34,500 --> 01:52:40,500
I just wanted to know what your E3 predictions are this year.

1881
01:52:40,500 --> 01:52:44,500
I'm hoping for an Onimusha remaster, a Need for Speed title that doesn't suck,

1882
01:52:44,500 --> 01:52:49,500
a Street Fighter collection since it's the 30th anniversary after all,

1883
01:52:49,500 --> 01:52:53,500
a Saga compilation, and some Final Fantasy VII remake footage.

1884
01:52:53,500 --> 01:52:57,500
Thanks guys, and take care. Tristan.

1885
01:52:57,500 --> 01:53:00,500
I stopped having expectations for E3 a long time ago.

1886
01:53:00,500 --> 01:53:03,500
Yeah, usually we kind of set some time aside to do these the week before.

1887
01:53:03,500 --> 01:53:08,500
However, since he is the only person to email us this week, let's indulge it a little bit.

1888
01:53:08,500 --> 01:53:11,500
What are some E3 predictions you guys might have?

1889
01:53:11,500 --> 01:53:16,500
Maybe like one thing from each of the companies. Loki.

1890
01:53:17,500 --> 01:53:22,500
Ironically enough, I would actually be all down for a new Ridge Racer game.

1891
01:53:22,500 --> 01:53:25,500
I really do wish they put out one. It's been soberly missed.

1892
01:53:25,500 --> 01:53:30,500
They used to launch consoles with Ridge Racer, and ever since the PlayStation 3,

1893
01:53:30,500 --> 01:53:33,500
I guess the Vita had a Ridge Racer, but it sucked.

1894
01:53:33,500 --> 01:53:35,500
It's just, bring it back.

1895
01:53:35,500 --> 01:53:38,500
Especially on modern hardware now, it looks so good.

1896
01:53:38,500 --> 01:53:43,500
I miss that. I really wish they'd just try again.

1897
01:53:43,500 --> 01:53:45,500
So there's that.

1898
01:53:45,500 --> 01:53:47,500
My expectations of the other systems.

1899
01:53:47,500 --> 01:53:49,500
Nintendo, I don't really have any expectations.

1900
01:53:49,500 --> 01:53:54,500
I'm sure we'll see some more Mario Odyssey or whatever.

1901
01:53:54,500 --> 01:53:56,500
That'll be probably pretty cool.

1902
01:53:56,500 --> 01:53:59,500
I'm just not really expecting any bombshell announcements.

1903
01:53:59,500 --> 01:54:02,500
Especially after last year, they didn't really have a whole ton.

1904
01:54:04,500 --> 01:54:06,500
Let's see, probably Microsoft.

1905
01:54:06,500 --> 01:54:08,500
Honestly, don't know what they're going to show.

1906
01:54:08,500 --> 01:54:11,500
Hope Crackdown is among what they're going to show.

1907
01:54:11,500 --> 01:54:14,500
Really, the rest of their announcements I'm kind of in the dark on.

1908
01:54:14,500 --> 01:54:18,500
Sony, I hope more PlayStation VR stuff,

1909
01:54:18,500 --> 01:54:21,500
because it would be nice to see what's on the forefront for that.

1910
01:54:21,500 --> 01:54:24,500
I know we still have a lot of games that they're showing at last year's E3

1911
01:54:24,500 --> 01:54:28,500
that aren't out yet, so I can't remember the names of them,

1912
01:54:28,500 --> 01:54:30,500
but there's that one with zombies in it.

1913
01:54:30,500 --> 01:54:32,500
It could be anything nowadays.

1914
01:54:32,500 --> 01:54:35,500
But that game is still not out yet, so it would be interesting to see

1915
01:54:35,500 --> 01:54:39,500
what exactly that's supposed to be and what other games they have in the works.

1916
01:54:40,500 --> 01:54:42,500
Bethesda.

1917
01:54:42,500 --> 01:54:45,500
I would like a new Elder Scrolls game would be nice.

1918
01:54:45,500 --> 01:54:47,500
Not happening.

1919
01:54:47,500 --> 01:54:49,500
Okay, well what new franchise are there?

1920
01:54:49,500 --> 01:54:53,500
I mean, I don't want Fallout Vegas and Fallout 4's setup.

1921
01:54:55,500 --> 01:54:59,500
Side story Fallout thing.

1922
01:54:59,500 --> 01:55:02,500
I'd find a Fallout New Vegas remastered. I'd try that.

1923
01:55:02,500 --> 01:55:05,500
I mean, I didn't play through much of it on PC,

1924
01:55:05,500 --> 01:55:08,500
but I'd be down for a remaster of that.

1925
01:55:08,500 --> 01:55:10,500
Sure, I'm on board.

1926
01:55:10,500 --> 01:55:12,500
Adar Saqra.

1927
01:55:12,500 --> 01:55:15,500
I don't really have any expectations so much as things I would hope for.

1928
01:55:15,500 --> 01:55:20,500
I would love for them to remaster the last Mass Effect trilogy.

1929
01:55:20,500 --> 01:55:24,500
Could you imagine all of that with really good graphics?

1930
01:55:24,500 --> 01:55:28,500
I just worry with where Mass Effect's at right now.

1931
01:55:28,500 --> 01:55:31,500
They're going to just kind of put the talk of that series on ice for a little while.

1932
01:55:31,500 --> 01:55:33,500
It would be a guaranteed money maker though.

1933
01:55:33,500 --> 01:55:36,500
Yeah, I know. If you want to try to get Mass Effect back up with people,

1934
01:55:36,500 --> 01:55:40,500
go back and do those games that everybody really enjoyed.

1935
01:55:40,500 --> 01:55:43,500
Not that Andromeda was bad though.

1936
01:55:43,500 --> 01:55:47,500
I would love to see multiplayer from 3 come back, but I love the new one,

1937
01:55:47,500 --> 01:55:49,500
but I understand it's so complicated.

1938
01:55:49,500 --> 01:55:51,500
Alright, my predictions quickly.

1939
01:55:51,500 --> 01:55:57,500
Nintendo, I think the Smash thing, the Smash remaster is going to be...

1940
01:55:57,500 --> 01:56:02,500
It's been rumored already and I think that's going to prove to be the big remaster that they do.

1941
01:56:03,500 --> 01:56:05,500
It's such low hanging fruit. I understand.

1942
01:56:05,500 --> 01:56:10,500
But as we talked about earlier, it's such a small risk.

1943
01:56:10,500 --> 01:56:12,500
People like Smash? Of course they do.

1944
01:56:12,500 --> 01:56:14,500
I mean, let's just port it over.

1945
01:56:14,500 --> 01:56:18,500
It's so low risk and they're going to charge a full retail price on it.

1946
01:56:18,500 --> 01:56:20,500
And it's sickening.

1947
01:56:20,500 --> 01:56:22,500
But here's a couple things with that.

1948
01:56:22,500 --> 01:56:24,500
Obviously there will be some new characters to sweeten the pot.

1949
01:56:24,500 --> 01:56:25,500
Maybe they'll do some stuff.

1950
01:56:25,500 --> 01:56:30,500
They'll add some new modes, some new cute things to try to sweeten the pot a little bit with that.

1951
01:56:30,500 --> 01:56:33,500
I also think that is going to be when Nintendo finally introduces

1952
01:56:33,500 --> 01:56:36,500
how they're answering the game sharing and the social media stuff.

1953
01:56:36,500 --> 01:56:39,500
I don't think the Switch is going to be capable of live streaming to Twitch,

1954
01:56:39,500 --> 01:56:44,500
but I think there will be something about the game sharing and buying into that.

1955
01:56:44,500 --> 01:56:47,500
And again, these are predictions and just things I'm pulling out of my hat.

1956
01:56:47,500 --> 01:56:51,500
But I think it's going to be exclusively through YouTube,

1957
01:56:51,500 --> 01:56:54,500
and that's not just because of Mario Kart 8, although I think that's a pretty good hint,

1958
01:56:54,500 --> 01:56:56,500
but I think it's going to be exclusively through YouTube

1959
01:56:56,500 --> 01:57:01,500
because Nintendo has YouTube on lock when it comes to getting their money out of it.

1960
01:57:01,500 --> 01:57:02,500
Why can't they share, though?

1961
01:57:02,500 --> 01:57:08,500
Because an Android phone or a phone or a tablet can stream to Twitch.

1962
01:57:08,500 --> 01:57:09,500
Well, maybe they will.

1963
01:57:09,500 --> 01:57:13,500
Aren't these pieces of hardware capable of what phones can do?

1964
01:57:13,500 --> 01:57:14,500
I'm going to keep it real.

1965
01:57:14,500 --> 01:57:18,500
I don't think Nintendo wants to put the full stuff out there like the other companies have it.

1966
01:57:18,500 --> 01:57:19,500
I just don't think Nintendo wants to do it.

1967
01:57:19,500 --> 01:57:22,500
I think they want to do highlights on YouTube and try to get that going,

1968
01:57:22,500 --> 01:57:24,500
but I don't know. We'll see. We'll see.

1969
01:57:24,500 --> 01:57:29,500
The only reason why I'm a little iffy on Smash is because we have ARMS already,

1970
01:57:29,500 --> 01:57:32,500
so it's like you're going to have two fighting games in a year,

1971
01:57:32,500 --> 01:57:37,500
but there are different types and there's plenty of room.

1972
01:57:37,500 --> 01:57:40,500
We had Fast Racing, Nioh, and Mario Kart.

1973
01:57:40,500 --> 01:57:42,500
Well, they could show Smash and it could be coming out next year.

1974
01:57:42,500 --> 01:57:45,500
Yeah, it could be. It could be an early 2018 game.

1975
01:57:45,500 --> 01:57:47,500
But anyway, that's what I think is going to go on with Nintendo,

1976
01:57:47,500 --> 01:57:49,500
and they need to say something about Virtual Console.

1977
01:57:49,500 --> 01:57:52,500
If they don't talk about Virtual Console, I'm going to be very disappointed.

1978
01:57:52,500 --> 01:57:53,500
Animal Crossing would be next.

1979
01:57:53,500 --> 01:57:54,500
On the phone, yeah.

1980
01:57:54,500 --> 01:57:56,500
I would be so happy, yeah.

1981
01:57:56,500 --> 01:57:58,500
Let's see, moving on to Sony.

1982
01:57:58,500 --> 01:58:02,500
I think Sony's going to be interesting because where I do expect a few surprises,

1983
01:58:02,500 --> 01:58:04,500
I think you hit the nail on the head with something,

1984
01:58:04,500 --> 01:58:07,500
is that they've shown so much that still isn't out.

1985
01:58:07,500 --> 01:58:09,500
So I fully expect God of War.

1986
01:58:09,500 --> 01:58:13,500
That ought to be the centerpiece of Sony's show, I would assume.

1987
01:58:13,500 --> 01:58:16,500
God of War, there's that other game I can't think of the name of,

1988
01:58:16,500 --> 01:58:20,500
but it was the really nice looking zombie game that they had.

1989
01:58:21,500 --> 01:58:23,500
The Second Last of Us.

1990
01:58:23,500 --> 01:58:27,500
Yeah, so I feel like Sony's going to be a lot of updates in a way,

1991
01:58:27,500 --> 01:58:28,500
and that's okay.

1992
01:58:28,500 --> 01:58:31,500
As long as Sony kind of goes, you know, playable, playable, playable,

1993
01:58:31,500 --> 01:58:33,500
that'll be some good stuff.

1994
01:58:33,500 --> 01:58:36,500
Microsoft obviously needs to focus on Scorpio,

1995
01:58:36,500 --> 01:58:39,500
and we just need to hear about why I need one.

1996
01:58:39,500 --> 01:58:41,500
That's what I really just need to hear from Microsoft,

1997
01:58:41,500 --> 01:58:42,500
is why do I need a Scorpio.

1998
01:58:42,500 --> 01:58:44,500
I would love to hear a little more about HoloLens.

1999
01:58:44,500 --> 01:58:46,500
Well, yeah, exactly with the Scorpio thing.

2000
01:58:46,500 --> 01:58:47,500
I mean, look at it this way.

2001
01:58:47,500 --> 01:58:49,500
I have a nice new laptop now.

2002
01:58:49,500 --> 01:58:51,500
I don't need to buy an Xbox One to play their games.

2003
01:58:51,500 --> 01:58:54,500
I mean, so it's like, what's the point?

2004
01:58:54,500 --> 01:58:57,500
I'm just going to buy, you know, I'll buy Crackdown on PC.

2005
01:58:57,500 --> 01:59:00,500
An interesting comment from Stoppy in chat, though,

2006
01:59:00,500 --> 01:59:02,500
saying at live.vognetwork.com,

2007
01:59:02,500 --> 01:59:05,500
maybe now that we plebs are allowed into E3,

2008
01:59:05,500 --> 01:59:08,500
it's more like the carnivals in town instead of an industry show.

2009
01:59:08,500 --> 01:59:11,500
And I think that's a really good thing to remember in the back of your mind,

2010
01:59:11,500 --> 01:59:17,500
is that E3 is not necessarily so much now about needing to get the word out

2011
01:59:17,500 --> 01:59:21,500
about products, because the internet does that for everybody now.

2012
01:59:21,500 --> 01:59:23,500
Nintendo knows that better than anyone,

2013
01:59:23,500 --> 01:59:26,500
but of course all the companies are doing this now, really.

2014
01:59:26,500 --> 01:59:30,500
But it's about really making hype for holiday games.

2015
01:59:30,500 --> 01:59:34,500
And, you know, hype for the systems themselves.

2016
01:59:34,500 --> 01:59:38,500
They still want to sell more PlayStation 4s and more Xbox Ones and all that.

2017
01:59:38,500 --> 01:59:40,500
I would like a new Excite Truck game, just saying.

2018
01:59:40,500 --> 01:59:42,500
It's going to be a different tone. We'll see.

2019
01:59:42,500 --> 01:59:44,500
All right, thank you for the email.

2020
01:59:44,500 --> 01:59:45,500
Email her.

2021
01:59:45,500 --> 01:59:47,500
Participate at OrangeLawnTrader.com.

2022
01:59:47,500 --> 01:59:49,500
It will sell me a system, I'm telling you.

2023
01:59:49,500 --> 01:59:53,500
You come out with a new Excite Truck game, I will buy the system.

2024
01:59:53,500 --> 01:59:56,500
And that goes for any console out there.

2025
01:59:56,500 --> 01:59:58,500
If you want to buy Excite Truck on another PlayStation system,

2026
01:59:58,500 --> 02:00:01,500
I will buy that system for Excite Truck.

2027
02:00:01,500 --> 02:00:05,500
All right, let's move on to some more news for the week.

2028
02:00:05,500 --> 02:00:06,500
We'll start with Logie.

2029
02:00:06,500 --> 02:00:09,500
All right, so this is kind of a really odd take on this,

2030
02:00:09,500 --> 02:00:13,500
but they're turning the King of Kong into a musical.

2031
02:00:13,500 --> 02:00:15,500
Yes, the King Kong Fistful of Quarters,

2032
02:00:15,500 --> 02:00:19,500
that whole documentary about Billy Mitchell and Steve Weeby,

2033
02:00:19,500 --> 02:00:21,500
is now going to be a musical.

2034
02:00:21,500 --> 02:00:25,500
They're, I guess, I don't know,

2035
02:00:25,500 --> 02:00:31,500
they're talking about that they're assessing the musical content,

2036
02:00:31,500 --> 02:00:37,500
including, they said, the Museum of Your Heart by Walter Dey.

2037
02:00:37,500 --> 02:00:41,500
I don't know, that sounds really weird.

2038
02:00:42,500 --> 02:00:44,500
I can't imagine that as a musical.

2039
02:00:46,500 --> 02:00:49,500
It sounds so cheesy and stupid, and I kind of love it.

2040
02:00:51,500 --> 02:00:54,500
Some of the best musicals out there are cheesy, stupid things.

2041
02:00:54,500 --> 02:00:56,500
I mean, look at Rocky Horror Picture Show.

2042
02:00:56,500 --> 02:00:59,500
This is true, this is me coming off of, you know,

2043
02:00:59,500 --> 02:01:04,500
not only a few weeks ago actually seeing the bodyguard, the musical.

2044
02:01:04,500 --> 02:01:06,500
You fucking went and saw the bodyguard.

2045
02:01:06,500 --> 02:01:07,500
Yes, I did.

2046
02:01:07,500 --> 02:01:08,500
Of course your wife.

2047
02:01:08,500 --> 02:01:09,500
Of course, look at my wife.

2048
02:01:09,500 --> 02:01:11,500
Of course your wife, the biggest Whitney Houston fan out there,

2049
02:01:11,500 --> 02:01:13,500
made you go see the bodyguard musical.

2050
02:01:13,500 --> 02:01:14,500
Oh my God, I didn't know this.

2051
02:01:14,500 --> 02:01:16,500
This is more important than the new story.

2052
02:01:16,500 --> 02:01:17,500
How was the bodyguard musical?

2053
02:01:17,500 --> 02:01:18,500
It wasn't bad, actually.

2054
02:01:18,500 --> 02:01:20,500
It was all right.

2055
02:01:20,500 --> 02:01:22,500
Was it Deborah Cox in the lead role?

2056
02:01:22,500 --> 02:01:24,500
Yeah, so it was all right.

2057
02:01:24,500 --> 02:01:26,500
I mean, I don't know.

2058
02:01:26,500 --> 02:01:28,500
And how was that?

2059
02:01:28,500 --> 02:01:29,500
It was all right.

2060
02:01:29,500 --> 02:01:31,500
They added some songs that weren't in there before,

2061
02:01:31,500 --> 02:01:34,500
like other Whitney Houston songs, which is kind of neat.

2062
02:01:34,500 --> 02:01:36,500
I thought they were pretty good.

2063
02:01:36,500 --> 02:01:40,500
And there was like one of the child, like a played her son.

2064
02:01:40,500 --> 02:01:44,500
Was it Mitchell or I think that was, I don't remember the kid's name.

2065
02:01:44,500 --> 02:01:45,500
Got it.

2066
02:01:45,500 --> 02:01:47,500
I've only seen the movie way too many times.

2067
02:01:47,500 --> 02:01:50,500
But yeah, they had, I don't know, it was very abridged.

2068
02:01:50,500 --> 02:01:53,500
And they changed kind of the story a little bit.

2069
02:01:53,500 --> 02:01:55,500
Like it doesn't follow the movie entirely.

2070
02:01:55,500 --> 02:01:58,500
Like the stalker guy is a different person.

2071
02:01:58,500 --> 02:02:01,500
And Lord knows how many times you've had to watch the movie.

2072
02:02:01,500 --> 02:02:03,500
Yeah, seriously.

2073
02:02:03,500 --> 02:02:05,500
But it is a little bit different.

2074
02:02:05,500 --> 02:02:09,500
But it's interesting. It was all right.

2075
02:02:09,500 --> 02:02:11,500
My wife kind of dragged me to it.

2076
02:02:11,500 --> 02:02:14,500
And it wasn't the worst thing I've seen.

2077
02:02:14,500 --> 02:02:19,500
The user named I heart Rob Roberts in our chat room asks,

2078
02:02:19,500 --> 02:02:21,500
did you cry, Loki?

2079
02:02:21,500 --> 02:02:22,500
No.

2080
02:02:22,500 --> 02:02:24,500
Only manly tears.

2081
02:02:24,500 --> 02:02:26,500
I'm just kidding. All right.

2082
02:02:26,500 --> 02:02:28,500
But yeah, King of Kong is a musical,

2083
02:02:28,500 --> 02:02:32,500
like is an off-off-off-Broadway sort of thing.

2084
02:02:32,500 --> 02:02:34,500
Like it's so off-Broadway it's in Jersey.

2085
02:02:34,500 --> 02:02:36,500
I could get into that.

2086
02:02:36,500 --> 02:02:39,500
I so want to see. They did Evil Dead the musical.

2087
02:02:39,500 --> 02:02:41,500
And that actually came locally here not too long ago.

2088
02:02:41,500 --> 02:02:45,500
And I mean, if they can make that into a musical, then sure, why not?

2089
02:02:45,500 --> 02:02:46,500
Why not?

2090
02:02:46,500 --> 02:02:48,500
All right.

2091
02:02:48,500 --> 02:02:51,500
Let's move on to Far Cry 5.

2092
02:02:51,500 --> 02:02:54,500
That's right. Far Cry 5 was announced.

2093
02:02:54,500 --> 02:02:57,500
A lot more of the details on the game this week.

2094
02:02:57,500 --> 02:03:01,500
So Far Cry 5 is being set in the mountains of Montana.

2095
02:03:01,500 --> 02:03:03,500
And it's going to be about a religious cult.

2096
02:03:03,500 --> 02:03:05,500
It's being set in Hope County, Montana.

2097
02:03:05,500 --> 02:03:08,500
And you can see this in the cover art.

2098
02:03:08,500 --> 02:03:11,500
There's lots of religious cultists there on it.

2099
02:03:11,500 --> 02:03:17,500
Kind of in the style of Heaven's Gate or those guys in Waco, Texas.

2100
02:03:17,500 --> 02:03:19,500
What was the name of that? Remember that whole thing?

2101
02:03:19,500 --> 02:03:21,500
But yeah, that whole stuff.

2102
02:03:21,500 --> 02:03:22,500
It's kind of...

2103
02:03:22,500 --> 02:03:24,500
It is interesting.

2104
02:03:24,500 --> 02:03:28,500
I did watch all the... They had six trailers available for that.

2105
02:03:28,500 --> 02:03:29,500
Geez.

2106
02:03:29,500 --> 02:03:32,500
Well, they had a trailer. They had the character highlights.

2107
02:03:32,500 --> 02:03:35,500
The heroes, the pastor, Mary May.

2108
02:03:35,500 --> 02:03:40,500
What's going to be different about this game versus other Far Cry games is there's multiple characters you can play as.

2109
02:03:40,500 --> 02:03:43,500
And they even have, I think, co-op throughout the whole game, which is kind of cool.

2110
02:03:43,500 --> 02:03:51,500
But basically, the premise is that these cultists come into this town and they're promising to save everybody.

2111
02:03:51,500 --> 02:03:56,500
And what they've done is actually started kidnapping people and just basically forcing them into this cult.

2112
02:03:56,500 --> 02:04:01,500
And now these people who are in this town are just going to fight back against them because they're just fucking sick of it.

2113
02:04:01,500 --> 02:04:08,500
And so it does look pretty cool. A very interesting premise and I'm down playing it and it looks very interesting.

2114
02:04:08,500 --> 02:04:12,500
Well, you'll be waiting until early 2018 when everything else is coming out.

2115
02:04:12,500 --> 02:04:16,500
That's fine. I think that's when the last Far Cry game, Far Cry 4, came out.

2116
02:04:16,500 --> 02:04:18,500
Was the November game, if I'm not mistaken.

2117
02:04:18,500 --> 02:04:24,500
No, Far Cry 4 is December. Far Cry Primal was February.

2118
02:04:25,500 --> 02:04:32,500
Stoppy in chat says, I'm glad we're finally getting historically accurate first person games again. They need to move on from World War 2.

2119
02:04:32,500 --> 02:04:40,500
Well, to be fair, this isn't based on any real religious cult, but obviously there's a lot of inspiration, heavy inspiration.

2120
02:04:40,500 --> 02:04:47,500
You probably don't want to see the latest Call of Duty then if you don't want World War 2 games because they're going back to World War 2.

2121
02:04:48,500 --> 02:04:55,500
And to be fair, I am interested to see what they come up with because I did like the Call of Duty 2.

2122
02:04:55,500 --> 02:05:01,500
Call of Duty 2 was one of the games that sold me on the Xbox 360 and it was a fantastic game.

2123
02:05:01,500 --> 02:05:08,500
Those old Call of Duty games, they were great. So I'm hoping that it stays like that.

2124
02:05:08,500 --> 02:05:13,500
Because honestly, what they did with Infinite Warfare was a little fucking crazy.

2125
02:05:13,500 --> 02:05:15,500
They took it too far.

2126
02:05:16,500 --> 02:05:23,500
Alright, well let's move on with a few more stories and we'll be getting your calls at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype very soon. But first, Dark Sakura.

2127
02:05:23,500 --> 02:05:28,500
Well, Vinyl is making a comeback. We have all known this.

2128
02:05:28,500 --> 02:05:43,500
And that same company that has put out the Shenmue soundtrack and Outrun and all these others is also now doing Gunstar Heroes, which is a really awesome treasure game.

2129
02:05:44,500 --> 02:05:49,500
It has some really great music and so it's going to be released by Data Discs.

2130
02:05:49,500 --> 02:05:59,500
That will be two LPs and they are going to be available to purchase apparently right now already.

2131
02:05:59,500 --> 02:06:10,500
Hold on, I loaded the price on it a moment ago because I was thinking about ordering it and then I realized that I have other things to spend my money on.

2132
02:06:11,500 --> 02:06:14,500
But hold on, I'm getting the price right now.

2133
02:06:14,500 --> 02:06:21,500
So they have it listed for, and this is of course British Pounds 24.99.

2134
02:06:21,500 --> 02:06:26,500
Some of the other things on their site is the Galaxy Force 2 and Thunder Blade soundtrack.

2135
02:06:26,500 --> 02:06:35,500
Revenge of Shinobi, Panzer Dragoon, Golden Axe 1 and 2, Outrun, Streets of Rage 2, Super Hang-On, Shinobi 3, Shenmue, and the original Streets of Rage.

2136
02:06:35,500 --> 02:06:40,500
So check it out, if you have a record player.

2137
02:06:40,500 --> 02:06:42,500
Are you interested in getting this?

2138
02:06:42,500 --> 02:06:44,500
You're going to drop the, let's drop the beat.

2139
02:06:44,500 --> 02:06:52,500
I thought about it and then I was like, we don't have a record player and we really only have a handful of albums that we'd want to keep.

2140
02:06:52,500 --> 02:06:58,500
Like we've got Weird Al's Even Worse, we have Mandatory Fun and it's signed.

2141
02:06:58,500 --> 02:07:06,500
We have Xanadu, I gave you the Rocky Horror Picture Show Audience Participation.

2142
02:07:06,500 --> 02:07:10,500
Yes, I have that in the closet somewhere.

2143
02:07:10,500 --> 02:07:12,500
Did I give you ABBA's Super Trooper?

2144
02:07:12,500 --> 02:07:21,500
I think you may have given me an ABBA cover, but the only ABBA album I have out here, Vinyl, I bought that copy of ABBA's The Visitors.

2145
02:07:21,500 --> 02:07:23,500
I'm fairly sure I bought you Super Troopers.

2146
02:07:23,500 --> 02:07:24,500
You did, I think it's in the closet.

2147
02:07:24,500 --> 02:07:25,500
And I bet Midler.

2148
02:07:25,500 --> 02:07:32,500
This one came from Seattle. It was a record store we were visiting, we were up there, and The Visitors is my favorite ABBA album. It was their last one.

2149
02:07:32,500 --> 02:07:42,500
And yes, I like ABBA a lot. It's like some gays like Gaga, some Madonna, I'm old school.

2150
02:07:42,500 --> 02:07:50,500
One treasure that I own is the Gorillaz Demon Days Parlophone release. The first printing of it, not the reprint, unopened.

2151
02:07:50,500 --> 02:07:51,500
Nice.

2152
02:07:51,500 --> 02:07:53,500
I could probably fetch 500 for it.

2153
02:07:53,500 --> 02:07:54,500
Look at their new album. They never asked you.

2154
02:07:54,500 --> 02:08:01,500
The new album is really good, but it's definitely something you have to listen to from start to finish. It's one of those kind of albums.

2155
02:08:01,500 --> 02:08:08,500
But, um, Saturn's Bars is like the best track on there, and Andromeda. So, really, really good album.

2156
02:08:08,500 --> 02:08:12,500
Cool. Alright, just a few more stories, and then your calls. Loki.

2157
02:08:12,500 --> 02:08:21,500
Speaking of movies that I've seen way too many times, the Angry Bird movie is something that I've had to watch dozens of times with my kids.

2158
02:08:21,500 --> 02:08:29,500
And it honestly, it's not a great movie, but it's funny for adults too. So, I mean, I enjoyed it enough.

2159
02:08:29,500 --> 02:08:31,500
There are worse things that I've seen.

2160
02:08:31,500 --> 02:08:36,500
But, they are making a sequel, and it's going to be coming out in 2019.

2161
02:08:36,500 --> 02:08:41,500
It's going to be, I guess they're going to have maybe some of the same voice actors in there as well.

2162
02:08:41,500 --> 02:08:51,500
It's being directed by Thrupper Van Orman, who did the Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack in Adventure Time.

2163
02:08:51,500 --> 02:08:57,500
And then it's being co-directed by John Rice, who does King of the Hill and Rick and Morty.

2164
02:08:57,500 --> 02:09:03,500
I like that combination. So, I'm all down with another adult, humored movie.

2165
02:09:03,500 --> 02:09:06,500
So, yeah. We'll check that out.

2166
02:09:06,500 --> 02:09:16,500
And then finally, Resident Evil. That movie series kind of went from typical Resident Evil to where you've gone beyond the Matrix kind of crazy shit.

2167
02:09:16,500 --> 02:09:23,500
But they're rebooting it. So, now they're going to have a brand new series that's going to be coming out.

2168
02:09:23,500 --> 02:09:27,500
I don't know when, but interesting.

2169
02:09:27,500 --> 02:09:32,500
All these video game reboots, maybe with the Tomb Raider one now, and this.

2170
02:09:33,500 --> 02:09:37,500
I wonder if they'll go in the direction of the new Resident Evil game, where it's more...

2171
02:09:37,500 --> 02:09:41,500
Although that's kind of really generic horror movie trope stuff right now.

2172
02:09:41,500 --> 02:09:47,500
Yeah, I mean, I don't know, because when the first Resident Evil movie came out, I was like, this doesn't seem to have that much in common with the game.

2173
02:09:47,500 --> 02:09:49,500
I mean, there's some of the ideas and so forth.

2174
02:09:49,500 --> 02:09:57,500
Well, in the later movies, I'm like, I haven't played any of these later games, I'm pretty sure none of this shit is in there, but it's pretty entertaining to watch.

2175
02:09:57,500 --> 02:09:59,500
I mean, it's just a popcorn movie.

2176
02:09:59,500 --> 02:10:06,500
Those movies kind of became something else, but doesn't seem a little, I don't know, doesn't seem a little early to reboot a series that just recently ended.

2177
02:10:06,500 --> 02:10:08,500
And I used my ended and quotey fingers.

2178
02:10:08,500 --> 02:10:11,500
Ended as in Mila Jovovich is sick of this shit.

2179
02:10:11,500 --> 02:10:16,500
Like, it's like, I mean, that woman has been in those movies.

2180
02:10:16,500 --> 02:10:18,500
How many of those movies are there? Six?

2181
02:10:18,500 --> 02:10:19,500
Seven, I think.

2182
02:10:19,500 --> 02:10:23,500
Oh my God. So, think of how much of her life she's been in those Resident Evil movies.

2183
02:10:23,500 --> 02:10:25,500
I mean, think of how much she's been paid.

2184
02:10:25,500 --> 02:10:32,500
Yeah, that's true, that's true. To be fair, I don't think Mila Jovovich has done much in the past decade or so outside of those movies.

2185
02:10:32,500 --> 02:10:33,500
She's been in a few things.

2186
02:10:33,500 --> 02:10:35,500
A few things, a few things, but you know.

2187
02:10:35,500 --> 02:10:36,500
This is the fifth element.

2188
02:10:36,500 --> 02:10:38,500
Okay, well, how long ago was that movie? That movie was-

2189
02:10:38,500 --> 02:10:42,500
A while ago. Well, do they have that new, oh man, that new movie that's coming out by that guy.

2190
02:10:42,500 --> 02:10:43,500
I'm looking forward to Valerian.

2191
02:10:43,500 --> 02:10:44,500
That looks pretty sweet.

2192
02:10:44,500 --> 02:10:45,500
Yeah, Valerian, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2193
02:10:45,500 --> 02:10:47,500
Have you ever read any of the Valerian comics?

2194
02:10:47,500 --> 02:10:48,500
No, I never have.

2195
02:10:48,500 --> 02:10:49,500
I remember that he was-

2196
02:10:49,500 --> 02:10:50,500
Isn't that, um-

2197
02:10:50,500 --> 02:10:51,500
They're French comics.

2198
02:10:51,500 --> 02:10:53,500
That's Grandpa Matt's, one of his online names he uses.

2199
02:10:53,500 --> 02:10:54,500
But Valerian?

2200
02:10:54,500 --> 02:10:56,500
I don't know, I don't know the whole-

2201
02:10:56,500 --> 02:10:58,500
Valerian is also a root that makes you sleepy.

2202
02:10:58,500 --> 02:11:03,500
I don't know anything about the storyline of that, but man, that was like a visual orgy in front of my face there.

2203
02:11:03,500 --> 02:11:04,500
Like, I totally want to go see that.

2204
02:11:04,500 --> 02:11:12,500
Well, Besson wanted to do it back in the 80s, and we didn't have the technology to render alien faces like that,

2205
02:11:12,500 --> 02:11:17,500
and he wouldn't have the makeup skills that would be very prohibitive to do something on that scale.

2206
02:11:17,500 --> 02:11:20,500
Now that the technology's here, hell yeah, he's doing it.

2207
02:11:20,500 --> 02:11:21,500
Yeah.

2208
02:11:22,500 --> 02:11:25,500
He's been directing movies for forever, he's gotta be getting up there in age.

2209
02:11:25,500 --> 02:11:29,500
I mean, Besson's been around since, God, he was doing stuff in the 80s, wasn't he?

2210
02:11:29,500 --> 02:11:30,500
Pretty sure.

2211
02:11:30,500 --> 02:11:33,500
Yeah, but the 80s was only 40 years ago?

2212
02:11:33,500 --> 02:11:34,500
30 years ago.

2213
02:11:34,500 --> 02:11:35,500
I mean, depending on when in the 80s.

2214
02:11:35,500 --> 02:11:36,500
Hold on, I'm gonna look it up.

2215
02:11:36,500 --> 02:11:37,500
Yeah.

2216
02:11:37,500 --> 02:11:40,500
Well, I mean, I was born in 78, and-

2217
02:11:40,500 --> 02:11:43,500
I'm still waiting for my live-action Matt Cross movie.

2218
02:11:43,500 --> 02:11:45,500
He was born in 1959.

2219
02:11:45,500 --> 02:11:47,500
Okay, so that's not as old as I thought he would've been.

2220
02:11:47,500 --> 02:11:52,500
And his first public movie was Subway in 1985.

2221
02:11:52,500 --> 02:11:54,500
Okay, so he has been making movies since the 80s, that's what I thought.

2222
02:11:54,500 --> 02:11:55,500
Yeah.

2223
02:11:55,500 --> 02:11:56,500
Alright.

2224
02:11:58,500 --> 02:12:04,500
Well, one more story for you guys, and I wonder if Dark Soccer would be interested in something like this.

2225
02:12:04,500 --> 02:12:08,500
Dark Soccer, do you ever play your Sega Nomad anymore these days?

2226
02:12:08,500 --> 02:12:10,500
No, it's kind of collecting dust.

2227
02:12:10,500 --> 02:12:16,500
Well, Sega Nomad, if you didn't know what that is, it was basically a handheld way to play the Genesis.

2228
02:12:16,500 --> 02:12:21,500
But it took six AA batteries to get three hours of playtime.

2229
02:12:21,500 --> 02:12:25,500
What kind of handheld gets a crap three hours of playtime? My god.

2230
02:12:25,500 --> 02:12:26,500
The Nomad.

2231
02:12:26,500 --> 02:12:31,500
It was seriously, if you didn't- you could get like another battery pack for it.

2232
02:12:31,500 --> 02:12:32,500
Yeah.

2233
02:12:32,500 --> 02:12:35,500
And that made it kind of tolerable, but no, it was shit for that.

2234
02:12:35,500 --> 02:12:40,500
And I joke, because obviously the Switch is another three hours of battery life when you're playing Zelda.

2235
02:12:40,500 --> 02:12:43,500
But the Switch has a dock that recharges very easy.

2236
02:12:43,500 --> 02:12:47,500
It was very different back when you had to buy six AA batteries. That's money, yo.

2237
02:12:47,500 --> 02:12:48,500
Rechargeable batteries.

2238
02:12:48,500 --> 02:12:50,500
Yeah, or rechargeable batteries, of course, you could always do that.

2239
02:12:50,500 --> 02:12:59,500
But anyway, so somebody has decided to update the technology to be able to play the Nomad without all these necessary battery swaps.

2240
02:12:59,500 --> 02:13:12,500
That's right, there's a new homebrew Nomad modification made by the Segaholic, and it will let your portable system, the Nomad, run on USB power.

2241
02:13:12,500 --> 02:13:15,500
That's right, you could use the same battery that you use for your phone.

2242
02:13:15,500 --> 02:13:19,500
Like this guy I have over here that I bought when we went to go play Ingress all day once.

2243
02:13:19,500 --> 02:13:21,500
I can charge four phones at once.

2244
02:13:21,500 --> 02:13:25,500
This is like, how many- what is the specs on this?

2245
02:13:25,500 --> 02:13:29,500
Capacity, 24,000 mAh.

2246
02:13:29,500 --> 02:13:37,500
That's like just a step below the legal limit for what you can take on an airplane.

2247
02:13:37,500 --> 02:13:43,500
So, anyway, yeah, you could run something off forever off that, off USB power, so that's pretty cool.

2248
02:13:43,500 --> 02:13:49,500
So anyway, you're gonna have to probably use some YouTube tutorials. This isn't something he's selling or anything like that.

2249
02:13:49,500 --> 02:13:53,500
But, you know, if this is possible, even more could be possible.

2250
02:13:53,500 --> 02:14:00,500
But I just love that somebody is still thinking about the Sega Nomad this way. I love all the tributes to the old systems.

2251
02:14:00,500 --> 02:14:08,500
Anyhow, time for you guys to give us a phone call, talk about anything you'd like to talk about that we were talking about in the news this week.

2252
02:14:08,500 --> 02:14:13,500
Or maybe something we missed. Or maybe you just want to talk alcohol with us. That would be fine too.

2253
02:14:13,500 --> 02:14:20,500
While we wait for your calls to come in at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype, I want to check in with Loki and see if there's any last minute stories.

2254
02:14:20,500 --> 02:14:24,500
Oh, I was supposed to be looking for last minute stories. Well, not this week. I don't think there's really anything out there.

2255
02:14:24,500 --> 02:14:28,500
Usually that's what we do towards the end of the show is look to see if there's any last minute stories.

2256
02:14:28,500 --> 02:14:37,500
But nothing so far. Alright. Well, you guys can also shout things out in chat if there's something you want us to talk about or banter on topic.

2257
02:14:37,500 --> 02:14:42,500
Because I'm kind of out of topics right now. I don't know what to talk about.

2258
02:14:42,500 --> 02:14:45,500
Overwatch Season 5 begins next week.

2259
02:14:45,500 --> 02:14:48,500
Oh yeah, because they just ended Overwatch Season 4. That's right.

2260
02:14:48,500 --> 02:14:49,500
So that's a thing.

2261
02:14:49,500 --> 02:14:52,500
Right around the time for the anniversary. Were you going to say something, DarkSucker?

2262
02:14:52,500 --> 02:14:53,500
No.

2263
02:14:53,500 --> 02:14:54,500
Oh.

2264
02:14:54,500 --> 02:14:57,500
No. Although I really want Mongolian BBQ.

2265
02:14:58,500 --> 02:15:02,500
It's a little late. I think the restaurant. Well, you have until 9 o'clock if we finish the show soon.

2266
02:15:02,500 --> 02:15:03,500
I'm going to come by myself.

2267
02:15:05,500 --> 02:15:08,500
Actually, on Sunday they might not be open until 9 now that I think about it.

2268
02:15:08,500 --> 02:15:13,500
There's a little hole in the wall place not far from here. But I don't like it as much as the one in Roseville. Some of the other stuff.

2269
02:15:13,500 --> 02:15:14,500
Anyway.

2270
02:15:15,500 --> 02:15:21,500
Let's see. Something I was going to mention. Speaking of Overwatch, I was going to do a stream tonight after the show.

2271
02:15:21,500 --> 02:15:26,500
Over on my Twitch channel, which of course is Rob Roberts over on Twitch.

2272
02:15:26,500 --> 02:15:29,500
And I put a poll on my Twitter to see what I was going to do.

2273
02:15:29,500 --> 02:15:32,500
I said I'll do either Overwatch because it's the free weekend.

2274
02:15:32,500 --> 02:15:37,500
I'll do Mario Kart 8 multiplayer because people have been asking me to play that with them.

2275
02:15:37,500 --> 02:15:40,500
Or just something retro because that's always a good stand by.

2276
02:15:40,500 --> 02:15:42,500
When in doubt, something retro.

2277
02:15:42,500 --> 02:15:46,500
And so far Overwatch is actually winning. I'm kind of surprised.

2278
02:15:46,500 --> 02:15:48,500
I thought some people thought I did too much Overwatch streaming.

2279
02:15:48,500 --> 02:15:51,500
So I guess with the free weekend there's more people that want to do that.

2280
02:15:51,500 --> 02:15:52,500
So right now that's winning over on my Twitter.

2281
02:15:52,500 --> 02:15:55,500
But I will check in. I'll make the final call here in about...

2282
02:15:55,500 --> 02:15:59,500
Oh no, it says final results. I guess I set the timer to finish up at 8.30.

2283
02:15:59,500 --> 02:16:03,500
So it is going to be Overwatch because there's no time left to vote.

2284
02:16:03,500 --> 02:16:09,500
ActDeftInChat says, too much Overwatch. Who says that? I agree. I agree.

2285
02:16:09,500 --> 02:16:11,500
I guess I could try playing some more Overwatch.

2286
02:16:11,500 --> 02:16:13,500
There you go. You got to add me on Battle.net.

2287
02:16:13,500 --> 02:16:16,500
I already did. I thought I submitted a thing.

2288
02:16:16,500 --> 02:16:20,500
Yeah, but you have to know my numbers. Did you send it to Sky or did you use my email?

2289
02:16:20,500 --> 02:16:23,500
I did it through Facebook. Remember, they can link it to Facebook.

2290
02:16:23,500 --> 02:16:27,500
I am no longer linked on Facebook on Battle.net, I don't think.

2291
02:16:27,500 --> 02:16:29,500
Oh, maybe I didn't. I did Allen though. I know that.

2292
02:16:29,500 --> 02:16:32,500
Okay, if you added Allen then I can look at his friends list.

2293
02:16:32,500 --> 02:16:36,500
I disconnected Facebook from Battle.net and I don't remember why.

2294
02:16:36,500 --> 02:16:39,500
But something about privacy pissed me off.

2295
02:16:39,500 --> 02:16:43,500
Oh, Battle.net shows my real last name. Facebook doesn't.

2296
02:16:43,500 --> 02:16:49,500
And there was something about that that I don't remember what I saw or something, but it pissed me off.

2297
02:16:49,500 --> 02:16:51,500
Oh, I didn't worry about that.

2298
02:16:51,500 --> 02:17:00,500
Yeah. And honestly, Battle.net needs to let us, especially for streaming purposes, that's what's really pissing me off.

2299
02:17:00,500 --> 02:17:05,500
Is that when I stream games I can't suppress the real names from showing up and it's pissing me off.

2300
02:17:05,500 --> 02:17:09,500
Like I don't want the game to show me the real names.

2301
02:17:09,500 --> 02:17:14,500
Maybe I got to look deeper into the options or something. I don't know. I guess I haven't been doing that.

2302
02:17:14,500 --> 02:17:16,500
Anyway, the phone is ringing so let's get to a call here.

2303
02:17:16,500 --> 02:17:18,500
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

2304
02:17:18,500 --> 02:17:20,500
Hey, it's Brad from 5 Culture.

2305
02:17:20,500 --> 02:17:22,500
Hey, Brad. Good to hear from you, buddy. How you doing?

2306
02:17:22,500 --> 02:17:25,500
Well, I had a call on a drunk show.

2307
02:17:25,500 --> 02:17:29,500
Have you been partaking in spirits tonight?

2308
02:17:29,500 --> 02:17:32,500
I do have a bottle of Fireball right here.

2309
02:17:32,500 --> 02:17:36,500
Your favorite, the standby. Have you tried Pepsi Fire, by the way?

2310
02:17:36,500 --> 02:17:38,500
No, I have not.

2311
02:17:38,500 --> 02:17:43,500
Okay, so it was described by a friend of mine on Twitter and I kind of agree.

2312
02:17:43,500 --> 02:17:47,500
Granted, I've only had Pepsi Fire as a Slurpee, but close enough.

2313
02:17:47,500 --> 02:17:51,500
Pepsi Fire is Pepsi mixed with Fireball, but without the booze.

2314
02:17:53,500 --> 02:17:55,500
The hell's the point of that?

2315
02:17:55,500 --> 02:17:57,500
That sounds terrible.

2316
02:17:57,500 --> 02:18:00,500
I know, it does sound terrible. My sister's super into it.

2317
02:18:00,500 --> 02:18:05,500
Tomorrow when we have this family picnic thing, they're bringing Pepsi Fire and I'm like, I don't want to try that.

2318
02:18:05,500 --> 02:18:08,500
Yeah, I have to admit, I kind of like it.

2319
02:18:08,500 --> 02:18:16,500
It's really sweet to me. I mean, granted, I had it as a Slurpee, but most soda like that is so sweet to me.

2320
02:18:17,500 --> 02:18:23,500
I can only use it on special occasions. I can't just drink a whole two-liter bottle of it or whatever.

2321
02:18:23,500 --> 02:18:25,500
I don't know, I could be kind of into it.

2322
02:18:25,500 --> 02:18:31,500
But you're right, Pepsi mixed with actual Fireball is much better, but you can't drink all the time.

2323
02:18:31,500 --> 02:18:33,500
Especially if you use the real sugar stuff.

2324
02:18:33,500 --> 02:18:34,500
That's true.

2325
02:18:34,500 --> 02:18:37,500
I wonder what you think of the stuff that I brought over for Rob.

2326
02:18:40,500 --> 02:18:42,500
That would burn you.

2327
02:18:42,500 --> 02:18:45,500
Well, no, you can't do that if he's flying to Dragon Con.

2328
02:18:45,500 --> 02:18:50,500
Yeah, I was going to say, if there was a way, can you check alcohol and luggage?

2329
02:18:50,500 --> 02:18:53,500
You can if it's sealed, I think, because I've brought back wine.

2330
02:18:53,500 --> 02:18:59,500
Yeah, but that's factory sealed. I don't know. I'd have to look at the TSA regulations on that.

2331
02:18:59,500 --> 02:19:01,500
Bail it to Bobby and I have him bring it.

2332
02:19:01,500 --> 02:19:06,500
That's true. Can you send it to FedEx? Because I would actually do that. Would you send FedEx to Bobby?

2333
02:19:06,500 --> 02:19:08,500
I don't know that you can FedEx alcohol.

2334
02:19:08,500 --> 02:19:09,500
Dang it.

2335
02:19:09,500 --> 02:19:11,500
I'll have to look it up, but...

2336
02:19:11,500 --> 02:19:14,500
No, you can FedEx it because wineries do it. You can ship it somehow.

2337
02:19:14,500 --> 02:19:16,500
Yeah, but it's still not factory.

2338
02:19:16,500 --> 02:19:17,500
Oh, and you can't?

2339
02:19:17,500 --> 02:19:18,500
Wineries can't ship to Kentucky.

2340
02:19:18,500 --> 02:19:21,500
Yeah, you can only ship to certain states, too. I forgot about that.

2341
02:19:23,500 --> 02:19:24,500
Road trip!

2342
02:19:24,500 --> 02:19:27,500
I know, right? Well, but with Dragon Con, people drive in from everywhere.

2343
02:19:27,500 --> 02:19:31,500
So if you can't send it to Georgia, you can probably send it to somebody nearby.

2344
02:19:31,500 --> 02:19:35,500
Anyway. Oh, to Act F saying you can't send alcohol. Damn it.

2345
02:19:35,500 --> 02:19:38,500
Am I just going to have to drive to Dragon Con this year? No, I'm just kidding.

2346
02:19:38,500 --> 02:19:40,500
I don't have the time off work for that type of trip.

2347
02:19:42,500 --> 02:19:44,500
Well, I just called to do a shot with you.

2348
02:19:44,500 --> 02:19:48,500
Oh, I appreciate that, my friend. So you're going to have a shot of Fireball with me?

2349
02:19:49,500 --> 02:19:50,500
Yes, sir.

2350
02:19:50,500 --> 02:19:54,500
All right, well I'm going to drink some of this ginger stuff. So what are we toasting today?

2351
02:19:55,500 --> 02:19:57,500
Just hopefully I find a damn job.

2352
02:19:58,500 --> 02:19:59,500
What's that?

2353
02:19:59,500 --> 02:20:03,500
I said hopefully I find a damn job. But I just do looking for an excuse to take a shot of Fireball.

2354
02:20:04,500 --> 02:20:10,500
Let's see, I will do a toast. Let's do a toast to E3 this year. Not sucking.

2355
02:20:11,500 --> 02:20:12,500
There you go.

2356
02:20:12,500 --> 02:20:14,500
I'll toast to that. Now that they've opened it to the public.

2357
02:20:14,500 --> 02:20:15,500
Maybe.

2358
02:20:16,500 --> 02:20:18,500
All right. Ah, nice be-

2359
02:20:18,500 --> 02:20:20,500
I am the eternal pessimist, you know.

2360
02:20:20,500 --> 02:20:22,500
I know, I know. All right.

2361
02:20:22,500 --> 02:20:23,500
You and me both, sister.

2362
02:20:24,500 --> 02:20:30,500
Any chance I'll run into you at Dragon Con this year? I know you got a lot of personal stuff to tend to as well, but any chance?

2363
02:20:31,500 --> 02:20:33,500
Well, there's always a chance.

2364
02:20:33,500 --> 02:20:56,500
So there's a chance. No, I hope it will work out. In fact, you actually remind me, I think the days are numbered on us submitting the podcast panel stuff, so I gotta harass Bobby in emails so we can come up with some ideas to try to make sure we're involved with that, especially with them not doing the parsecs this year. It's gonna be a quiet Dragon Con if we're not able to get on any of those panels. Then again-

2365
02:20:57,500 --> 02:20:58,500
Dragon Con's never quiet.

2366
02:20:58,500 --> 02:20:59,500
Dragon Con's never quiet.

2367
02:20:59,500 --> 02:21:15,500
That's right. Dragon Con's never quiet. I can always work on cosplay. I can always think about if there's something else I want to try cosplaying this year, so we'll see. I'm kicking ideas around, but for everything I want to do, I'd have to shave my beard, and I'm kind of like, but I like the beard. So I don't know.

2368
02:21:16,500 --> 02:21:17,500
At least you can grow one.

2369
02:21:17,500 --> 02:21:26,500
I know. I hear that complaint from some guys sometimes, but anyway. All right, my friend. Enjoy the alcohol, but not too much.

2370
02:21:29,500 --> 02:21:30,500
I got anywhere to drive in the morning.

2371
02:21:31,500 --> 02:21:35,500
We'll look forward to the next Pod Culture. I know you guys are on a repeat this week, but hopefully soon.

2372
02:21:36,500 --> 02:21:37,500
All right, you guys take care.

2373
02:21:38,500 --> 02:21:39,500
All right, take care. Bye-bye.

2374
02:21:40,500 --> 02:21:49,500
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype, or you can give us a call. 1-877-GAME-OLR if you'd like to call us that way.

2375
02:21:54,500 --> 02:21:55,500
Of course, we'll just sit here and wait.

2376
02:21:56,500 --> 02:22:01,500
I forgot one other thing I guess we should expect to see is another strange trailer for Death Stranding.

2377
02:22:02,500 --> 02:22:04,500
Oh, I didn't know another trailer came out for that.

2378
02:22:05,500 --> 02:22:06,500
Well, I'm assuming we'll get one with E3.

2379
02:22:06,500 --> 02:22:09,500
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you said that one came out this week.

2380
02:22:10,500 --> 02:22:11,500
No, no, no.

2381
02:22:12,500 --> 02:22:14,500
That would be nice. Maybe some gameplay this time. Like, what's the fucking game?

2382
02:22:15,500 --> 02:22:16,500
It's like, what is the game?

2383
02:22:17,500 --> 02:22:22,500
Exactly. It's like No Man's Sky all over again, except I know that's a horrible thing to say with Kojima.

2384
02:22:23,500 --> 02:22:24,500
Let's see, going to chat.

2385
02:22:25,500 --> 02:22:29,500
Doomplague in chat says, I played Overwatch a bit for the free weekend and it quickly had enough.

2386
02:22:30,500 --> 02:22:31,500
Aw, sorry to hear that.

2387
02:22:32,500 --> 02:22:33,500
Let's see.

2388
02:22:34,500 --> 02:22:38,500
Act F says, Monster Hunter 5 is rumored to be a PlayStation 4 exclusive.

2389
02:22:39,500 --> 02:22:43,500
Well, that would be interesting. That would be a heck of a thing to show at E3 if they actually did get that as an exclusive.

2390
02:22:44,500 --> 02:22:52,500
Although, there could be some type of side story thing they could always do on the other platforms.

2391
02:22:53,500 --> 02:22:56,500
So, just because 5 is exclusive doesn't mean the other systems won't get their Monster Hunter shots.

2392
02:22:57,500 --> 02:22:59,500
I mean, after all, Monster Hunter XX we know is going to be on the Switch, right?

2393
02:22:59,500 --> 02:23:00,500
We know that.

2394
02:23:01,500 --> 02:23:02,500
Alright.

2395
02:23:03,500 --> 02:23:06,500
Dark Tetsuya says, I should go back to Phantom Dust. I just need people to play with.

2396
02:23:07,500 --> 02:23:15,500
I keep meaning to fire that up and play it. I just get sucked into other games instead, but I really need to make it a point to do that this week to sit down and play some Phantom Dust.

2397
02:23:16,500 --> 02:23:18,500
Alright, one more call out for calls and then we're going to close it up.

2398
02:23:19,500 --> 02:23:20,500
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word, on Skype.

2399
02:23:21,500 --> 02:23:24,500
But, if that's all we got this week, then that's fine too.

2400
02:23:25,500 --> 02:23:27,500
I knew in Memorial Day this weekend it would probably be a little shorter of a show.

2401
02:23:27,500 --> 02:23:33,500
Some of you folks are probably out of town, maybe checking this out on the podcast feed and that's okay too.

2402
02:23:34,500 --> 02:23:37,500
Maybe we're entertainment on the drive home for you somewhere and that's cool.

2403
02:23:38,500 --> 02:23:42,500
Hopefully the traffic isn't too horrendous on Memorial Day.

2404
02:23:43,500 --> 02:23:48,500
I know there's no way in hell I'd be making that drive from LA back to SAC on Memorial Day because I've heard some horror stories.

2405
02:23:49,500 --> 02:23:55,500
Actually, I think the worst is the day after Thanksgiving, or not, the Sunday after Thanksgiving, whatever that is.

2406
02:23:55,500 --> 02:23:57,500
It's like the worst day to do it.

2407
02:23:58,500 --> 02:24:02,500
Alright, well, the phone isn't ringing, so I think y'all are just being quiet tonight.

2408
02:24:03,500 --> 02:24:07,500
That's fine, that's fine. Maybe y'all just passed out from alcohol, which we might do soon too.

2409
02:24:08,500 --> 02:24:13,500
Anyway, we're going to wrap things up here, but I want to thank you guys, of course, for tuning into Orange Lounge Radio and being a part of the show.

2410
02:24:14,500 --> 02:24:17,500
If you do have something you think of after the fact and you want to email us, you always can.

2411
02:24:18,500 --> 02:24:19,500
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

2412
02:24:20,500 --> 02:24:23,500
And you guys know the thing we ask every week here on the show and we really do appreciate it.

2413
02:24:23,500 --> 02:24:26,500
Tell a friend or two about the shows.

2414
02:24:27,500 --> 02:24:29,500
A tweet. Send a tweet. That goes a long way.

2415
02:24:30,500 --> 02:24:36,500
And of course, what really helps, and I really can't stress this enough, reviews on sites because that helps you get visibility in the rankings.

2416
02:24:37,500 --> 02:24:44,500
So if you can just take 15 seconds to do a 5-star review on iTunes or wherever it is you found this show, those go an awful long way and is really appreciated.

2417
02:24:45,500 --> 02:24:47,500
That's all we ask. I'm not asking for your money.

2418
02:24:48,500 --> 02:24:51,500
Maybe your bits on Twitch, but that isn't technically a part of Orange Lounge Radio.

2419
02:24:51,500 --> 02:24:54,500
That's just another thing that Rob Roberts does as well as this show.

2420
02:24:55,500 --> 02:24:59,500
I think the time is here for us to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

2421
02:25:00,500 --> 02:25:02,500
DarkSakura, we'll start with you. Your final thoughts tonight?

2422
02:25:03,500 --> 02:25:06,500
I really still want Mongolian BBQ and I will do it for money.

2423
02:25:07,500 --> 02:25:10,500
Alright. Loki, how about your final thought?

2424
02:25:11,500 --> 02:25:15,500
I think I'm trying to play some more Overwatch this week just so that I can say that I did it.

2425
02:25:16,500 --> 02:25:18,500
That's good. And you actually bought it, so you don't even need the free weekend anymore, right?

2426
02:25:18,500 --> 02:25:19,500
You don't need the free weekend anymore.

2427
02:25:20,500 --> 02:25:25,500
Yeah, awesome. And my final thought is excellent work on the ginger drink, DarkSakura.

2428
02:25:26,500 --> 02:25:29,500
It's all I've drank tonight and I think you guys can all tell it's had its effects.

2429
02:25:30,500 --> 02:25:32,500
So be safe out there everybody. Have a safe weekend.

2430
02:25:33,500 --> 02:25:40,500
Next week here on Orange Lounge Radio, we'll be back in 7 days and it's probably going to be our last normal show for like a month.

2431
02:25:41,500 --> 02:25:44,500
With E3 and the week off and the 15-year anniversary.

2432
02:25:45,500 --> 02:25:47,500
Next week's going to be like our last normal show for a month.

2433
02:25:48,500 --> 02:25:52,500
So YYR originally was going to be here in person again, which was going to be a lot of fun.

2434
02:25:53,500 --> 02:25:55,500
However, unfortunately he did have to cancel that trip due to other reasons.

2435
02:25:56,500 --> 02:26:03,500
So YYR, we said let's do something on the telephone because we need to grill him about multitasking and some of the things that he's been working on.

2436
02:26:04,500 --> 02:26:08,500
So we're going to talk to him a little bit next week on the show and just catch up and have a good old time.

2437
02:26:09,500 --> 02:26:10,500
Sounds good.

2438
02:26:11,500 --> 02:26:12,500
And we'll have a good old time with you guys here again in 7 days.

2439
02:26:13,500 --> 02:26:15,500
We hope to see you again here at Orange Lounge Radio.

2440
02:26:15,500 --> 02:26:17,500
Have happy gaming. Have a great rest of your holiday.

2441
02:26:18,500 --> 02:26:20,500
And we'll see you soon. Good night!

2442
02:26:46,500 --> 02:26:48,500
But you know they were all still true.

2443
02:26:51,500 --> 02:26:52,500
See you next week.

2444
02:27:15,500 --> 02:27:17,500
See you next week.
