You know, tangents, 3 hour show, it happens

00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Say hello in studio to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Sup

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Hi, how are you, Jamie?

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm tired

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Yeah, you said you were up late last night

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I was up to like 4.30 in the morning

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Bow chicka wow, no I'm just kidding

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
No

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It's nothing like that

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You were playing, playing

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I wasn't playing anything

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
You were just

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Watching random stuff on YouTube

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Oh, okay, okay, you fell down one of those

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I got caught in the trap and I was talking with my good friend and co-worker, James

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Who is sometimes in the chat room and I hope soon tonight

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Well, speaking of other stuff, this is really funny, some of our listeners will get a kick out of this

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So, DarkSakura and I went to the same event last night in Sacramento

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
We didn't go together because we planned it completely separately with two different groups of people

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
But, so here's the thing, so DarkSakura and I went to see Bianca Del Rio

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Which, if you follow Drag Race, which you may have caught that Jamie and I are a fan of

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Loki, not so much

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Oh, hi by the way, Techmaster Loki, how are you doing?

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Fine

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Alright, you just sit there for a minute because we're going to talk Drag Race for a moment

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
But not a super long time, I promise

39
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
But Bianca Del Rio is one of the stars of Drag Race, was the winner of season 6

40
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So, but now, I mean honestly, I mean, however you feel about that show aside

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I mean, she's really coming to her own as a stand-up comic who tours the country

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:26,000
And she's also known for being a very, how would you say it, like, unpolitically correct or off, you know

43
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
She's like Lisa Lampanelli except she's funny

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Yes, she's Lisa Lampanelli but funny

45
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
But she's one of those like, there's like several disclaimers before you go to the show

46
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Like, this is going to be offensive, you're going to be offended

47
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So if you're here to like Tumblr police this show, get the f out

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
GTFO

49
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Type of thing, yeah, basically

50
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
And don't bring your 9 month old baby

51
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Although somebody did bring a baby

52
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
But we were just, ironically, we were both there

53
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And I thought what was really funny, you were just sitting like two rows behind me

54
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Yeah, Becky and I were like on G or something and y'all were like, what, on D?

55
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Yeah, yeah, we were in D

56
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
We won the D

57
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Yeah, we got the D at the Bianca Del Rio show

58
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
But I just thought it was funny, yeah, you went with Becky, who's one of your besties

59
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And I went with my old co-worker

60
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Because, you know, I changed jobs a couple years ago

61
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
But I still, there's, believe it or not, there's some people I like that I hang out with during the day

62
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And so she was one of them

63
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
And so, you know, she and I used to talk every week about Drag Race

64
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
So I know she was really excited to go

65
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Cool

66
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Yeah, we had a good time

67
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Yeah, it was good

68
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
And then there was Froyo and that was awesome

69
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Yes, and then Dark Soccer and I went to Froyo

70
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And that was, that was, that was our night

71
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Good time, no gaming involved

72
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Which is where we talked about going to coin op here locally

73
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It was loud and

74
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Well, okay, here's the thing about the local joint

75
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And, you know, I'm obviously going to talk local for a minute here

76
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
But no matter where you guys are in the country

77
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
There's definitely been like a renaissance of classic coin op gaming

78
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
And I think most big cities at this point have a barcade of some sort at this point, right?

79
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Where there's pinball machines and old arcade games plus alcohol

80
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Which always makes for a good time, right?

81
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So we have one in Sacramento and it's, it's a decent place

82
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm glad it's here, I like it

83
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
But here's the weird thing about it for me

84
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I don't, like there's just not a lot of stuff there

85
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
That I get really excited about

86
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Because a lot of it is the really cliche classic gaming

87
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Like a Ms. Pac-Man machine

88
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's like, it's like all the, like a Donkey Kong machine

89
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
No, it's got other things

90
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
There's a six player X-Men

91
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Right, and I'm not, again, I don't want to knock this place

92
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Because I want to support local business

93
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
There's a Golden Axe

94
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'm glad something like it exists

95
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
But I will say, I will give the place props for this

96
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Their pinball game is on point

97
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
They have a lot of, like I play more pinball

98
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
One of Dan's buddies owns those

99
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Oh okay, well yeah, when I go there I play more pinball

100
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Then I'm giving your buddy money

101
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Because when I go there I play more pinball than anything else in the joint

102
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
So, but I mean they have like the new shit

103
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Like I played some Batman

104
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
There's some Batman, the 60's Batman

105
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Yeah, that one's a new one

106
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Back when it was awesome

107
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
There's, um

108
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
The TV show, and then there was like an Aerosmith one that was really new too

109
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I think the ACDC was there before

110
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
And the same guy owns the Wizard of Oz

111
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
And he had that there until people kept breaking it

112
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:20,000
But there is, believe it or not, one of the SNK multi choice

113
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And it's got a Blazing Star in it

114
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Well that's cool

115
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And that makes me super happy

116
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Because what is my favorite shooter game next to R-Type?

117
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Blazing Star

118
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I would have thought it was a treasure game for sure

119
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
But that's alright

120
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Well, alright

121
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Let's see, Vidpower in chat says

122
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Does being drunk make you lose even faster in old coin-op games?

123
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Yes, it does

124
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Sometimes it makes you better

125
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Yeah

126
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Because sometimes, you know what alcohol focus is?

127
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Where you are just so blazed that you can like cut the rest of the universe out

128
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Well blazed usually refers to something else

129
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Well you know what I mean

130
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I know what you mean

131
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Blitzed I guess

132
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Okay blitzed, yeah

133
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Just so much on the sauce

134
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
That everything else falls behind you and you get hyper focused

135
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Yeah, yeah, I've had those moments

136
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
That was the time I made it to like level fucking 29 on Luminess

137
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
While I was shit face drunk at my birthday

138
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I think I did it on your PSP

139
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I think you did

140
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Yours or Wendell's

141
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I think you did, yeah

142
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
At one of my birthday parties

143
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
But yeah, I mean, so we didn't end up going there

144
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I mean, so I don't even know why I bring this up

145
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
But it's just one of those like, you know

146
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It's cool that we have a place like that

147
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
But the magic's kind of worn off for me

148
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
But I do find, okay here's the thing though

149
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I'm not, again, I'm really not trying to knock these places

150
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I think it just depends on like what games and what presentation you have

151
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Because I remember a place in Portland that I went to

152
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Now granted, this was, this was when Alan and I were first dating

153
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So it was like six years ago

154
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
So we went to Portland and we went to an arcade there

155
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I had a lot of fun there

156
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
But that was like one of the first of those types of places that I went to

157
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I didn't have anything in SAC or even the Bay Area at that time

158
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Now San Francisco I think has a couple of these places too

159
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
There's one in the Castro, right?

160
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Uh, I didn't see it in the Castro

161
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
There is, there is

162
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
It's on the edge of it

163
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
But it's, I can't remember the name of the place

164
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
JD's in chat, he'll know

165
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Yes, Brucade, thank you

166
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Okay, yeah, we didn't go there when I was there on Wednesday

167
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It's not like near the theater

168
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
It's in a different, it's like down market a little further

169
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Ohhhhh

170
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It's closer to that music venue where we saw Frank music

171
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
And now I can't remember the name of it

172
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It was like downstairs

173
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Is it like just past the cafe?

174
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
The cafe?

175
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It's past the cafe, yeah

176
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Okay

177
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Yeah

178
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
But now when I went we actually went to like a little Thai place

179
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
And then the GLBT museum was having a free day

180
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
So I went and kind of cried for a little bit

181
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
When I heard the Harvey Milk recording

182
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
The Living Will, the recorded Will

183
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Oh

184
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Because I had that as a recording there

185
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I've never been there, I'd like to check that out

186
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And then we went down to the mix, so

187
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
JD is in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com

188
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Because hello, chat, we do tape live every Sunday night

189
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
At the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com

190
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern

191
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
And JD in chat, who lives in San Francisco

192
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
That's why I knew he'd know this stuff

193
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
He says it's near Gateway

194
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
So, do you know, you know where that is, right?

195
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Yeah, the gay jumbo's right next to it

196
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Yes

197
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
So, alright, anyway

198
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Yeah

199
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Hurray, and all the people around the world

200
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
And other countries who are outside Northern California

201
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Are like, wow, these places that I've never heard of

202
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
But again

203
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Now you know

204
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
These barcades are showing up in a lot of different places

205
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Let's see, in chat

206
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I really liked round one, though

207
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
SSG100Matt says, when you come to New York, Rob

208
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
We can barcade Bar Hop

209
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
That would be awesome

210
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I would really love to go, though, out there

211
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I want to go to that Fun Spot place

212
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Where all the, like, that's one of those

213
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
They don't have alcohol there, I don't think

214
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
But that's where, like, all the classic games are at

215
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
But I was looking, and it's kind of a hell of a deal

216
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I don't think I could really get to Fun Spot when I'm out there

217
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I am coming to New York this year, but I am going for a wedding

218
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
So, I can't do too much crazy stuff

219
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Because the wedding's actually in Connecticut

220
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
But I'm trying to plan it where it's like

221
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Well, maybe we'll have a fun day in New York

222
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I feel like, if we're going to go to New York

223
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Alan and I have to go to see something on Broadway

224
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Like, how can you not?

225
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
But, I don't know, we'll see

226
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
We'll see

227
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Let's see, going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com

228
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Tigerclaw says

229
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Wasn't Fun Spot the place where King of Kong was filmed?

230
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Yeah, some of it

231
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
That's where most people know the place from

232
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Fantaz in chat says

233
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
All the arcades closed down here in Canada

234
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
That's sad

235
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Doesn't Canada like their arcades too?

236
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Well, what part of Canada

237
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I mean, Canada's a big place, yo

238
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
What part of Canada are you in?

239
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Because I bet the big s-

240
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I would be gasped, shocked

241
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
If, like, Toronto didn't have these things

242
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
But Toronto's one city in a big place

243
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
So, uh, you know

244
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Let's see

245
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Oh, Fantaz says I'm in Toronto

246
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Wow, and they don't have-

247
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
There's gotta be something

248
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I gotta ask my other buddies that live out there

249
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
If there's any place like that

250
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
There's gotta be something out there

251
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Let's see

252
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Shadeinator in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says

253
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Rob, speaking of arcades

254
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Do you remember an old mechanical game involving clay pigeons

255
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Projected onto a screen and you shoot them with light guns that look like rifles

256
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
What was that called?

257
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
We had one at my arcade when I worked at the arcade

258
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I remember that

259
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Do you know how else I know that?

260
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It was like clay shooting

261
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I think it was just like clay pigeons or clay shooting

262
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Yeah

263
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Here, here's a tip for you

264
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It's in the movie Karate Kid

265
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Yeah

266
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
There's a montage

267
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
And they're at the arcade

268
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
And that is in the movie

269
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Gotta have montage

270
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
That's right, there's a montage

271
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
So go watch

272
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Karate Kid's gotta be on Netflix or something, right?

273
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Go watch it

274
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
And pause right there on that sequence

275
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
So there it is

276
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
And JD found it, Clay Pigeon is the name of it

277
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Yeah, we used to have all like the

278
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Okay, I lived in Alabama, they were the dirty rednecks

279
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
You know, wearing wife beaters

280
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Stereotypes

281
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Wife beaters and jeans and boots

282
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I'm not even joking because the stereotype exists for a reason

283
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Okay, we come in and like just be loud and raucous

284
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
And play the stupid gun game

285
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And then leave it a mess

286
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Let's see, going to a chat

287
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Bobby Blackwolf using good old Yelp found 10 arcades in Toronto

288
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
That doesn't mean there are going to be 10 good arcades

289
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
But it sounds like there's some to choose from there

290
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Yelp was a good idea though to find stuff there

291
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
As studio 100 Matt suggests, you might have to go to Niagara Falls or something

292
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Yeah, I wonder if those arcades

293
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I'm not looking at the link right now

294
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
But I wonder if those arcades aren't like bowling alleys

295
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
But sometimes bowling alleys can have good arcades

296
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
You just have to experiment a little bit and look around

297
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
So, we'll see, we'll see

298
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Alright, anyhow, let's see

299
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Loki, how are you doing? I haven't heard a lot from you tonight

300
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Have you been?

301
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I'm fine

302
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Yeah?

303
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Any progress on your new project, your authoring project this week

304
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Or whatever it is you're working on?

305
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I think I'm working on a new game

306
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Oh yeah, I guess

307
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Maybe you're not if you don't know what the fun is

308
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
No, I haven't made that much progress on it

309
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
In fact, actually, I was working on it last night

310
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I literally fell asleep while working on it and woke up later on

311
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I'm like, oh crap

312
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
So, no, I haven't made a ton of progress on it yet

313
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It's still design phase, I guess

314
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
How about 3D printing?

315
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I didn't really work on the 3D printing too much

316
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I did install the fan shroud I printed last week on it

317
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
And I just need to solder the fan

318
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I need to extend the cords on it so that they can reach the board on the actual printer

319
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
So they can control the fan

320
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
So I started doing that last night

321
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
And then I haven't really bothered to print anything else yet

322
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Because I needed to get that done so I can reinstall the auto level on there

323
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
And then redo that because it's all jacked up

324
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Since I tore a hole in the top of my build plate

325
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Or the little cup

326
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
There's like this surface that's on top of the aluminum plate

327
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
So I tore a hole in that surface that's on there and covered it up with tape

328
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
And it works okay, I guess

329
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
But I really do need to replace it with some tempered glass or something

330
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I just haven't gotten around to buying a piece of tempered glass to put on there

331
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
But soon, I mean, I still have been like

332
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
When are you printing my mini me?

333
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Your mini you?

334
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
My mini me. Remember we were going to make an action figure of Rob Roberts

335
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
That came up on a previous OR

336
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
But I have to get a 3D model of you first

337
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
If I must

338
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Alright

339
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I did find, now this was cool

340
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
We're sending you 3D printers

341
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,000
There's instructions on how to take your model out of World of Warcraft

342
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Oh cool

343
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
And import it into a 3D printer

344
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
And it requires some tweaking to it

345
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Because you have to change the type of polygon

346
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
But they did really realistic, like someone did a full on Lich King

347
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
It was pretty cool

348
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I remember back when we were doing Horde House

349
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
There was a service that came up on the show

350
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Where they would like print, they would make statues

351
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
They still have that

352
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Yeah, so I'm not too surprised the technology's out there

353
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
But now it's probably more easier for you and I to get access to the 3D models

354
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
To do that kind of stuff, so yeah, pretty cool

355
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Anyhow, it's a bit of a slower news week this week

356
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
We will get into the video game news and what's been going on here in a minute

357
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
After we do our gaming weeks

358
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
But obviously it's a little slower in the news cycle right now

359
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
We're less than a month away from E3

360
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
No, we're a month away from E3 at this point

361
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
When does it all start? June 9th?

362
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
June 10th

363
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
First press conferences are June 10th

364
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It's like Saturday this year is when E3 starts

365
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Yeah, there's EAs on Saturday

366
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Microsoft and Bethesda on Sunday

367
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Sony is at their usual time on Monday

368
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Ubisoft and Nintendo are assumed to be Monday as well

369
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
But who knows

370
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
We're gonna have a crazy June

371
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Between the 15 years of OLR

372
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
And the E3 and all that stuff

373
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
It's gonna be a crazy June

374
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Isn't that the week that we're out to?

375
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
It's gonna be June 11th

376
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
June 11th is E3

377
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
June 18th is our 15th anniversary show

378
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
June 25th is we're giving ourselves a week off

379
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
As a reward for doing the show for 15 years

380
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Got it

381
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Because I'm going to Chicago

382
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
There it is

383
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
So that's our June

384
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
It's gonna be a little bit crazy

385
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Speaking of 15 years

386
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I wanna make sure I got this out at some point during the show

387
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Because obviously we're coming up on the big 15

388
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
If you didn't already know, Orange Launch Radio started

389
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Actually, technically as a station

390
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
It started in May of 2002

391
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
So we're in the 15 years right now

392
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
As a station we started in 2002

393
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Because originally we were a station on the Live 365 service

394
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Which is no longer around

395
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
But that was where you could set up your own music thing

396
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
And we had DDR music and DanceMania soundtrack stuff

397
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
To differentiate ourselves from DDR Freak Radio

398
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Which was also started around the same time

399
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
But then the idea was that the centerpiece of Orange Launch Radio

400
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
The network was Orange Launch Radio Live

401
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
The show

402
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Which is this now, 15 years later

403
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Now that podcasting is a thing

404
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Now that Live 365 is gone

405
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
And we moved to all games

406
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Moved to VOG Network and all that

407
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
But, you know, 2002

408
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
When this show started

409
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Was really kind of like a peak of music gaming in a way

410
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Like I know, I know

411
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
There was other peaks obviously as well

412
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Rock band, Guitar Hero 2 and all that stuff that came later

413
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
But the reason why I say that is that I came across

414
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Something today that mentioned that

415
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
In the music gaming world

416
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
A website turned 15 years old this month as well

417
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Bamani style turned 15 this month

418
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
And, you know, we've had Eddie who started it

419
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
He was on the show probably a long time ago talking about it

420
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I think he was here around the time they did a big relaunch

421
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I think he was here

422
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
But I was, you know, reading up on the site

423
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
And I was just going like, wow, memories

424
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
This has been 15 years

425
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
It's been a long time since some of this stuff

426
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
And just, yeah

427
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
So I just wanted to acknowledge their anniversary as well

428
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Give them props

429
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I know they've kind of

430
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
They've gone through their own transformations

431
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
It used to be a place where people would look at like sim files

432
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Like that was their big thing

433
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
And now they're, you know, they can't really do that anymore

434
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
So they have more like, you know, what's going on in music gaming news and so forth

435
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
So we've transformed

436
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
They've transformed

437
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
You know, you don't usually go 15 years

438
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Being the exact same thing you were in the beginning

439
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
So, you know, just props to them

440
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
And we're all getting old

441
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Crazy stuff

442
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com

443
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
SSU100Matt says, shit, I feel old

444
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I remember checking Bamante's style every day

445
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Well, you could be doing that right now

446
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
They are still around

447
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
They're celebrating a birthday

448
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
So they're still doing their thing

449
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
It's just different than what it was in the beginning

450
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
You know, so

451
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
They just do a lot more news about, you know, the newer music games

452
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Because there's still a lot

453
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I'm gonna talk about my gaming week here in a moment

454
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I've been playing some new music games

455
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
And I was kind of shocked

456
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
What I found here locally

457
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
So I'm gonna talk about that in just a minute

458
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
When we get to our gaming weeks

459
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
vidpower points out ddrfreak for ddr forums

460
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Bamante's style for all other

461
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Bamante game forums

462
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Yeah, for sure

463
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Totally

464
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
So, yeah

465
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Congrats and happy anniversary to Bamante's style

466
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
So

467
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
One thing I wanted to ask about here at the top of the show

468
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Before we get into our gaming weeks

469
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
What we have been playing this week

470
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I just wanna ask you guys a little bit about

471
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
What haven't you been playing this week

472
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Because, again, it's a slower time of year

473
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
There hasn't been as many game releases

474
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I know we have Mario Kart 8, we've had a few big ones

475
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
But, um, what's your backlog

476
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
In gaming look like right now

477
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
What are the games you need to make it a point

478
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
To finish

479
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Before things get crazy

480
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Come September, October, November

481
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
What are, like, the biggest priorities

482
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
You're laughing at me, Loki

483
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
The joke is obvious

484
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Your backlog is like 500 games

485
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I'm sure

486
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
What are the biggest things

487
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
You're like, I need to get this done before

488
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Even more shit comes out

489
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
To pile up the backlog

490
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Since I'm just gonna steal the joke right here

491
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
The obvious answer would be my game

492
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Okay, fair enough

493
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I wasn't even coming for you

494
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
With that question

495
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Okay, sure, fair enough

496
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
God, there's so many things

497
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I have, I mean, even just strictly

498
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
PlayStation

499
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I have a finished

500
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Watch Dogs 2, Final Fantasy

501
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
15, um

502
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Hell, there's so many games

503
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I haven't even started yet that I have

504
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Like Dragon Age Inquisition

505
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Both Wolfenstein games

506
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Crap, I don't know, there's like a ton of games

507
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I have the original Watch Dogs 2 that I've never

508
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Played, it's on a disc and never played

509
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I have Destiny that I've never touched

510
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
How do you pick what you're gonna do first?

511
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I usually

512
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Buy something new

513
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
So in other words

514
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
You're full on admitting these games are never

515
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Gonna get touched because I'm gonna end up buying something new

516
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
And it's just added to the mountain of games

517
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Pretty much, yeah, I mean

518
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
There's uh

519
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I don't know

520
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
There's a lot of stuff

521
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
My PlayStation 4 backlog is starting to

522
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Look as bad as my

523
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Steam backlog

524
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
DarkSakura, what about you?

525
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I don't know if it's fair to say you're a little more

526
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Pinky-choosey when it comes to games, but

527
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Is your backlog as horrific as Loki's?

528
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Danganronpa 2

529
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I thought you already beat that

530
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
No, I'm almost done with it, but I put it off

531
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
To play other things

532
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I still want to finish Ultra Despair Girls

533
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
They've just been on the back burner since

534
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I was playing a couple other things

535
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
And right now

536
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I'm playing stuff, but kind of taking a bit of a break

537
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Just for

538
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
No mental recharge, I've got

539
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
A few other projects that have fallen on the side

540
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
That have fallen

541
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
On the side

542
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Sorry, my voice went out

543
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
That's okay, it went into 911 operator

544
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
It went into 900 number operator mode for a minute there

545
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Pick up the phone

546
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Let's look at chat

547
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Over at live.vognetwork.com

548
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I'd like to hear from you guys as well

549
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Stoppy says still haven't played through Hitman

550
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Ugh, Lady JJ says

551
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Tomb Raider Anthology on Mac

552
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Rise of the Tomb Raider is still in my backlog

553
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
So that's a big one actually

554
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Uh, Lissy Darktitsia says

555
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I was in the middle of Jet Set Radio and Nights

556
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
On Steam

557
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Stoppy says Mad Max I have for PS4

558
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
And I haven't touched it in months

559
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Oh, Grand Theft Auto 5

560
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
There's another one on Grand Theft Auto Online

561
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
In my backlog Grand Theft Auto 5 for sure

562
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Yeah, and Fallout 4

563
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Well, at least I played a little bit of Fallout 4

564
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Fallout 4 would also be in mine too

565
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Because I never finished that

566
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Yeah, no, I need to finish it

567
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
But, uh, yeah, I'm just, I'm horrible

568
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
At the Fallout games

569
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
But, yeah, I need to play that

570
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
But Grand Theft Auto 5 is definitely still there

571
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Uh, yeah

572
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Actdeftinchat says still haven't played Forza Horizon 3

573
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Yes, we heard a little bit about that on Bobby's show tonight

574
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
But yes, Forza is in my backlog too

575
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Uh, other big stuff in my backlog

576
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Um, Zelda Breath of the Wild

577
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I need to finish

578
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I need to finish that, like, I was really into it

579
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
And then I, I

580
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I don't know what happened, I felt like I was doing something wrong

581
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
But I really need to realize

582
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
In that game you can't do things wrong

583
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Like, you can do whatever you want when you want

584
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
And I just have to get my mind out of that place

585
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
And I'll be able to go back and do it

586
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Um, here's one that might kind of surprise you guys

587
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Uh, Mass Effect Andromeda is in my backlog right now

588
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I kind of stopped playing it

589
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Um, when a lot of the talk about patching and changes and all that stuff was going on

590
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I kind of painted myself in a corner in that game too

591
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Because I felt like I screwed myself

592
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
And I'm not able to do the loyalty missions

593
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Even though I'm close to the end of the game

594
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
So in my mind, whether this is logical or not

595
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
This is where my mind's going

596
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
My mind says the only way to fix this, Rob, is to start all over

597
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
And then couple that with

598
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I had a really bad multiplayer experience

599
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Because of fucking Origin

600
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Where we got kicked from a match like seconds before the end of the match

601
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
And we'd used consumables and all this stuff too

602
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Like, I got really frustrated

603
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I was just like, fuck this game

604
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
And I just, I kind of walked away from it for a little while

605
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,000
And in reality, I still think Mass Effect Andromeda is a great game

606
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
And I need to just get over that kind of mental hump and go finish it

607
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,000
But then, you know, I get sucked into a good old thing like 14

608
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Or Diablo 3 now

609
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I've been actively trying to hunt down this platinum trophy

610
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
And it's like, that's great

611
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
But it's keeping me from playing all of these other games

612
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
So my backlog over there is just growing as well

613
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
What can I say? Let's see

614
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
VidPowerInChat over at live.vognetwork.com says

615
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Pro tip, treat your backlog as more of an all-you-can-play buffet

616
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Instead of a checklist

617
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
It's way less stressful this way

618
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I like that, an all-you-can-play buffet

619
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
That's what PlayStation Now should be trying to brand its service as

620
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Well I keep wanting to play Minecraft on my laptop

621
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
But apparently something corrupted my profile

622
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:15,000
And so it doesn't authenticate with Microsoft servers or something stupid like that

623
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
So I haven't purchased, technically twice, thank you Microsoft

624
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
And I can't download it

625
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Because they're stupid

626
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Alright, enough about backlogs

627
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Let's talk about the current stuff

628
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
The types of video games that you've been playing this week

629
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
What have you been playing in a segment?

630
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
How was your gaming week?

631
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?

632
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Like I was saying, it hasn't been super eventful

633
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,000
But I've been playing some World of Warcraft and Mass Effect Andromeda

634
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Not really too many other things

635
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Except we did, well Dan actually repaired my old ColecoVision

636
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
And so there was some Mr. Do happening in Donkey Kong

637
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Mr. Do is an underrated 80s classic

638
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Fucking love Mr. Do

639
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Yeah Mr. Do is a fucking rad game

640
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
It's like Dig Dug but not

641
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
And people don't seem to realize just how good the ColecoVision was for its time

642
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,000
It was kind of a powerhouse for itself

643
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
And you had really some of the best arcade versions at home

644
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Short of having it on the computer versions

645
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,000
So it was really, except the controller is kind of shit

646
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Man, is there a way to play Mr. Do legally on a modern console?

647
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Like was it in any of those arcade repackaging things?

648
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I don't think so

649
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
That's a classic I'd like to play again

650
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
But anyway, sorry Dark Soccer but I couldn't help but wonder that

651
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Well and then of course Pokemon Go and Miitomo

652
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Which actually I forgot to try today

653
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
So that's what I'm playing

654
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
For now

655
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Awesome, we'll get to Loki in a minute

656
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Oh is that that arcade Internet Archives thing?

657
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Yeah it is, the latest thing they had in there

658
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
It was on the Wii Virtual Console in Japan

659
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Why did Japan get all the good stuff?

660
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Oh I forgot there was a Neo Geo version at one point too

661
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
There's Neo Mr. Do

662
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Yes there is

663
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
That is kind of a different game though if you think about it

664
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
It is, it looks absolutely different

665
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
So wow, they didn't put it in any of those like the arcade classic

666
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Yeah I guess not, interesting alright

667
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Random 80s arcade game that I want to play again

668
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Anyway, how about you Loki?

669
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I didn't play a whole lot

670
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
It's just pretty much what's on my phone

671
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Because I've been purposely avoiding playing games on consoles and stuff

672
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Because I wanted to work on my games

673
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Sort of happened and sorted it

674
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I was just really tired this week

675
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
So like every time I sat down to work on it

676
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
You have to have more mental capacity than I had at the time

677
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
To actually be able to program stuff

678
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
So it was kind of annoying

679
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,000
But I did play more of that Office Space idle clicker game thing

680
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Which is actually, it's kind of

681
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
It's entertaining because they do these like weekly challenge things

682
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
So it kind of mixes up the game almost every week

683
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
And so you can play that on top of your normal game as well

684
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
And it unlocks more of the consumable things that they have in the game

685
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
So you don't really have to spend real money on it

686
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
To kind of earn those things

687
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
And I kind of like that because it gives me a point to play it

688
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Because there's actually a little bit of a challenge to try to unlock those things

689
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:33,000
So I don't find it as kind of like throwing the ads or consumables in your face

690
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
As much as some of the other games did

691
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
I mean they still have you watch a lot of ads

692
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
But usually it's just kind of whatever

693
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Although there is an ad on there

694
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Which I might mention

695
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
For like some mobile game that has like Pokemon in it and stuff

696
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
It's not Pokemon Go

697
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
It's like something I'm like

698
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
How is this not violating like IP left and fucking right

699
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
And they're advertising it in another game

700
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
It's not the official match 3 game that Pokemon has

701
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Pokemon

702
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I forget the name of it

703
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
There's another Pokemon game

704
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
It's not from like Nintendo or from the Pokemon company or something

705
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
It's from some other company I've never heard of

706
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Thank you guys, Pokemon Shuffle says chat

707
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
No it's not Pokemon Shuffle at all

708
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
It's like some other thing

709
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
And it's like the actual title of the game

710
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
It sounds like a knock off

711
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
So I'm like

712
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
How the fuck

713
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Like how fucking ballsy must you be

714
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
To literally advertise this game

715
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
With like violating copyright all over the place

716
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
In another game

717
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I mean on Google services

718
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Come on Google like wake up

719
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
So that was kind of interesting

720
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
And then the other thing I play of course is Pokemon Go

721
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
A little bit because they're doing that whole grass type event or whatever

722
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
So I've been trying to level up my grass type Pokemon

723
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Shit I don't fucking see Bulbasaur anywhere normally

724
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
And now he's just like fucking all over the place

725
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Like I literally was walking through

726
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I haven't seen a one

727
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
A Bulbasaur

728
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
I'm seeing more

729
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
They're all over the place

730
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Like I caught like 5 the other edges of the outlets

731
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Just like in like 5 minutes

732
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I'm seeing more Chikorita than I am Bulbasaur

733
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Yeah

734
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Myself

735
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Yeah

736
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
But yeah that's what I've been doing

737
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
So just a little bit of that

738
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I mean it's entertaining enough

739
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I don't really

740
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Like I'm not going hardcore into the game

741
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I just more of like play it once a day

742
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
You know to get my daily stuff

743
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
And then that's it

744
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
But yeah I mean

745
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I don't know

746
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I look at games kind of

747
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
It's entertaining for what it is

748
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I mean that's fine

749
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
I'm enjoying it

750
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Not being sucked in like

751
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I've got to play it like the other ones

752
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
It's more of like

753
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Okay I got like 5 minutes

754
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Let me just do this real quick

755
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
And then that's that

756
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Yeah I mean

757
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
You know I've been playing Ingress myself this week

758
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Which I know is the other game you're referring to

759
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
But I've tried to take a little bit more

760
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Relaxed approach to Ingress

761
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Turning off notifications

762
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
And that game was the best thing I could do

763
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Possibly for just my own like

764
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Just not getting so sucked into it or whatever

765
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
But you know funny enough

766
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
They're doing an event in Pokemon Go

767
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
But they're also doing one in Ingress right now

768
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
They just started

769
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
So it's like Niantic

770
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Didn't really think this through for their servers

771
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Because like the Ingress ones have been hurting

772
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Like the game's been running really slow

773
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Like when you try to deploy resonators

774
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Like it's slow because the event is about

775
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Deploying resonators

776
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
And they have a big

777
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
They have a special badge in the game right now

778
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
For resonator deploys

779
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
So it was funny to me that Niantic's running

780
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Two different events at the same time

781
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Now granted I'm sure the Pokemon Go and Ingress

782
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Run on completely different servers and stuff

783
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
But still, still like it just seems like

784
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Wow there's a lot happening right now

785
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
So anyway

786
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Yeah

787
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Okay so my gaming week since I started there

788
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Let me talk about some other stuff

789
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Okay so I didn't talk about this last week

790
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I wanted to talk about this game last week

791
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
But we were a little pressed for time last week

792
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Because we had an interview which was awesome

793
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
But I had to kind of roll this talk to this week

794
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
So there's a newer game out on PlayStation 4

795
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
That I played and I beat in the past week

796
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Because this is one of those games

797
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
That's only gonna take you about three hours to beat

798
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
But it was a great three hours

799
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
The game is called What Remains of Edith Finch

800
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,000
So this is one of those walking simulator games

801
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Although you know I hate that label

802
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
But everybody knows what I'm talking about

803
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
When I say that

804
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I say more interactive story is what it really is

805
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
But if you haven't read much about it

806
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
It's basically about a girl that returns to a house in her family

807
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
And as she goes through the house she kind of learns the secrets

808
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Or the stories about her family

809
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
And we'll leave it at that because I want to keep it relatively spoiler free

810
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
So like Gone Home it sounds like?

811
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Not at all

812
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Well no the story is nothing like Gone Home actually

813
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
The story is nothing like it

814
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
But the gameplay is a little bit like it

815
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
But here's the thing about Edith Finch

816
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
And again I'm really trying to keep this very spoiler free

817
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
There are sections of Edith Finch

818
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Where I feel like there was more game to it

819
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Like there was like a segment where you had to

820
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Catch two things

821
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Or you have to like go through the sequence again

822
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
So there were some more like arcadey type of sequences in it

823
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Where you know Gone Home didn't really have any of that

824
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
So I do feel like even though

825
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
A lot of people are gonna write this game off as

826
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Oh it's another one of those

827
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
There's no fucking game here

828
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
You just watch a story unfold in front of you

829
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I do feel like Edith Finch is taking another step forward

830
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
In the genre to try to bring

831
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Walking simulators and interactive stories

832
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Forward a little more into

833
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
You know being the types of video games that

834
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
You know a lot of people think of when they think of video games

835
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
But I will say this as well

836
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
The story was very affecting

837
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
And there was some

838
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
There was some quite frankly like

839
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Disturbing and difficult sequences to watch in the game

840
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
And again I'm trying to keep it spoiler free but there's just you know

841
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
There's some heavy stuff in the game

842
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
And so I kind of wasn't prepared for it

843
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Like there was definitely a sequence

844
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
That like once it was over

845
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
And if you guys have played through the game

846
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
You're gonna know exactly what I'm fucking talking about

847
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
But I will say it is the

848
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
The

849
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
How do I say this without fucking ruining it

850
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
The bathtub sequence I'll leave it at that

851
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,000
So after that I had to just fucking like

852
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I need a break

853
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I need a break that was heavy

854
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
But the fact that a video game can kind of affect you like that

855
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I think is you know says a lot about the game as well

856
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
And I did you know I was

857
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
I was satisfied with the resolution of the story

858
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
It has kind of a weird ending

859
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
And I will say that I saw the ending coming

860
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
About halfway through the game

861
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
But I was still okay with the journey to get there

862
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
So that's what I

863
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Yeah that's what I liked

864
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I overall it was you know a great experience

865
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
I really like these types of games

866
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Especially you know as maybe I don't have the attention span

867
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
For video games that I used to

868
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,000
I really like these games that I can kind of like start and beat within a day

869
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
And I feel like it's really fulfilling

870
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
I think the trickiest part about this game

871
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Is going to be that $20 price tag

872
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
After I just told you you're gonna beat it in three hours

873
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
And although you can replay sequences

874
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
I'm not sure there's a ton of replayability in a game like this

875
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
I mean maybe if you were into speed running it or something

876
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
There might be a little more in it for you

877
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
But I really think this is kind of a one and done type of video game

878
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
And so the $20 price tag may be a tough sell

879
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Now that being said

880
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Some of y'all have no problem

881
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Buying a movie for 25, 30 bucks on blu-ray

882
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Watching it one time and then putting it in your shelf somewhere

883
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
So on one hand

884
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I kind of don't understand why people get really frustrated

885
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
With the price tags on video games

886
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
When it's really no different when it comes to movies

887
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
But on the other hand

888
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Sure I mean there's so much variance when it comes to video game prices

889
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
That there are other games you could be spending $5, $10 on

890
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
That will give you hours and hours of enjoyment

891
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
It might be tough to convince you that $20 is worth it for three hours of this

892
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
That being said there probably will be a sale at some point

893
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
So maybe some of y'all will just hold out for the sale

894
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
But I think the game is definitely worth your time

895
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
And it was a story I enjoyed going through

896
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Let's see go into our chat over at live.vognetwork.com

897
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Rama in chat says beat in three hours

898
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
What about Final Fantasy Mystic Quest?

899
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I don't remember that game taking only three hours

900
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
But the last time I played it I was like 12 or 13

901
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,000
So Dark Soccer do you remember how long was Mystic Quest of a game?

902
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
It's got to be more than three hours

903
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
It wasn't that long though

904
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
No it wasn't like a typical Final Fantasy

905
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
It wasn't really a Final Fantasy game

906
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
It really wasn't

907
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
It was Final Fantasy USA is what they released it as over series

908
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Yeah I don't remember offhand what the original was

909
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
I'd have to look back up

910
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,000
But it was definitely RPG for small children

911
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
One other quick thing I want to say about Edith Finch

912
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Is that I really loved some of the style that some of the stories were told through

913
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Like Jamie I really think this might be a game you'd be into for some of the style

914
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Some of that

915
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,000
I think some of the artistic direction in the game I think you'd be a big fan of

916
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
So it might be you know again it's 20 bucks

917
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
But when there's a sale or something you know I think it's worth

918
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
I don't know if it's on PC

919
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
I think it is

920
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
I don't think it's on Xbox it's only on PlayStation

921
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
But I think I heard it was on PC as well

922
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Maybe somebody in our chat knows over at live.vognetwork.com

923
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Bobby Blackwolf says Mystic Quest is a 12 to 15 hour game

924
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Yeah I was going to guess it was more like 10

925
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
So yeah 12 to 15 sounds a little more right

926
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Act Def points out I paid 40 dollars for Portal because of the orange box

927
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
And I can beat that game in an hour

928
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I think Portal has a lot of replayability value to it though

929
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
At least I think so

930
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
You would agree with that though right Dark Soccer

931
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
That Portal has a lot of replayability to it

932
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I mean yes

933
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
You know the answers to the puzzles and everything

934
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
But it's also one of those games where there's kind of more than one way to do it

935
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Yeah

936
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
And you know just the story is really good in that game too

937
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
And there's also finding the secrets

938
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Yes that's true

939
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
And in Portal 2 there's certainly a lot more

940
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
That's true

941
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Alright so other games I've been playing this week

942
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I've been playing a little bit of Heroes of the Storm

943
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Which is Blizzard's Dota-esque or League of Legends-esque type of game

944
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
And obviously the reason I've been playing it if you follow Blizzard games at all

945
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
You can get Overwatch stuff right now by playing Heroes of the Storm

946
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
So there's a little group of us people that you sometimes hear on OLR

947
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Like myself, Shane, Flaco Jones

948
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,000
And we've been playing Heroes of the Storm because if you play with friends

949
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
You unlock things in Overwatch

950
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
So the first week you just played five matches with a friend

951
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
And you got like a new Genji skin that was really cool

952
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
And you got some unlocks

953
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
And that was really easy because we just played against AI

954
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
And it was okay cool we did this

955
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Well Blizzard said for weeks two, three, and four

956
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
You can no longer play against AI

957
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
You have to play against real people

958
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
And we were like ugh

959
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
The people in this game can be so toxic

960
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
But whatever we're just gonna suck it up and play

961
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
So we did

962
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
And actually we won

963
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Like Shane and I played our last two games

964
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Or my last two games last night

965
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
And we won both games

966
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
So I was like woohoo we can actually do this

967
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
But I think it's because there's a lot of other people who don't play Heroes of the Storm a lot

968
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
That are playing now to get the unlocks

969
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
So you kind of have like a lot of baddies playing the game right now

970
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
I do wish they didn't force you to play against other people though

971
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Because I've also seen the side of this where

972
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
People are just teaming up in groups of five

973
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
And then letting the other team win

974
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Like they're just we're just gonna hang at base

975
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
And you guys can just steamroll

976
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
We just won our D.Va skin

977
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Because they have the whole South Korean police officer garb thing that D.Va can get

978
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
And her mech has a police siren on it and all this stuff

979
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
It's cute and if you're a D.Va player

980
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Which you know she's awesome in Overwatch

981
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
You want this skin

982
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
So a lot of people play for that

983
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
And then week four is gonna be ten loot boxes

984
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:41,000
So I do kind of wish they would just let people get it from AI matches

985
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Because you're gonna end up playing the game either way

986
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
So you're downloading it and you get those play stats on Blizzard

987
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Which is what they want to go for

988
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
But you're not like forced to play with other people

989
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
And I just

990
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
You know I don't have a problem doing it

991
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
I'm not afraid of other people

992
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Like you know oh darn we lost a match

993
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I don't give a fuck we still get our skin

994
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
And if somebody is abusive to me

995
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Blocked like it's not that hard

996
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Blocked reported easy to do

997
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
And I have like low tolerance for that shit in those games

998
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Like if somebody says something nasty

999
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Blocked I just don't even acknowledge it or anything

1000
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
I just block them

1001
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
But I just

1002
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Let the nasty people all play their game together or whatever

1003
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
And just let the people who want to steamroll for the skin just play AI or something

1004
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
I don't know

1005
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Make them do AI on medium mode or something

1006
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
I don't know what it is

1007
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Yeah actdeftinchat says good thing you only have to play not win

1008
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
I really hope weeks 3 and 4

1009
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Blizzard's solution for this better not be

1010
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
You have to win the matches now in order to get it

1011
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Because

1012
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
That's just gonna be a fucking mess

1013
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
People will figure out how to win trade

1014
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Mark my words

1015
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
They're gonna win trade

1016
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
And it's just gonna be bad for the Heroes of the Storm community if they do that

1017
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
So I really hope they don't do that

1018
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
And one other thing I want to talk about

1019
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
So

1020
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Yesterday my pal Shane and I went to an arcade here in the area

1021
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
It was the bowling alley out in Rockland

1022
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
You guys know that place?

1023
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,000
So that place has an arcade machine called Neon FM

1024
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Which speaking of this show being 15 years old

1025
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
And Mamani style being 15 years old

1026
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
I feel like development on that game started 15 years ago

1027
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Because I remember when that was gonna be a dance game

1028
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Remember that?

1029
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
But the controller looked like Beatmania

1030
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
But it was a dance pad

1031
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Girls Butts

1032
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Yes and there was the infamous Girls Butts song

1033
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Which is still there

1034
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
And I refuse to play it

1035
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Because it's banned from my life

1036
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
But that song aside

1037
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
There's a lot of great songs in the game

1038
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
There really are

1039
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
If you're okay with Sir Mix-A-Lot singing about girls butts

1040
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
It is different Loki

1041
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
It is different and you know it

1042
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Anyway

1043
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
So here's the thing

1044
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Neon FM is an iOS slash Android game now

1045
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
So you can download that on your phone

1046
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000
And I played the machine before

1047
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
They had it at MAGFest

1048
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
So seeing the machine was not new

1049
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
But what we saw in the app

1050
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Is that they actually have a list of arcades nearby

1051
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
That have the actual Neon FM game

1052
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
And that's how we saw

1053
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Oh they have one out in Rockland

1054
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
We should go fucking play Neon FM in the arcade

1055
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
And because at MAGFest

1056
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
As fun as MAGFest is

1057
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
I couldn't hear that fucking game

1058
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
For shit at MAGFest

1059
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Because MAGFest is so loud

1060
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
But we went to the arcade yesterday morning

1061
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Well morning-ish like noon

1062
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Which on a weekend is morning

1063
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
So we went over there

1064
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
And there wasn't really anybody there

1065
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
We were like the only ones in the arcade

1066
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Maybe some kids playing some Ticket Spitter games

1067
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
That was really it

1068
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
And us we were playing Neon FM

1069
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
So we were able to play it loud

1070
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
And that was cool

1071
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Because we could actually like hear the songs

1072
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
And I gotta say

1073
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
You know that game was a lot of fun to play

1074
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Like obviously now it's a little more pop and music

1075
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
It's probably the closest like Bimani game

1076
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
But it does different things

1077
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Like I don't want to say it's a clone

1078
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
It's not

1079
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Because I like that the grid

1080
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Where the notes fall

1081
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Will do different things

1082
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Based on the song

1083
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Like I was playing a chiptune sounding song

1084
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
And all of a sudden

1085
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
The grid turned into 8-bit looking notes

1086
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
At one part of the song

1087
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
And then there was another song

1088
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Where like the colors change

1089
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
And all this stuff

1090
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
So I thought that part was kind of cool

1091
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
And what I thought they did

1092
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
That was pretty neat

1093
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Is that they've really embraced

1094
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
And I know we've brought this up on OLR before

1095
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
But they've really embraced this whole fact

1096
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
That you can log into the machine

1097
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Using your smartphone

1098
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
So you scan a QR code on the machine

1099
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
As you're picking your song

1100
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
And they don't have time limits

1101
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
When you pick your song

1102
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Thank god

1103
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
You can just sit there and pick your song

1104
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
However long it's gonna take

1105
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Once you pick your song

1106
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
You only have 30 seconds to pick the difficulty

1107
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
But you pick your song or whatever

1108
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
So you can scan the QR code

1109
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
You log into the machine

1110
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
And then it knows it's you

1111
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
And so it's linked to whatever you're playing

1112
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
On your phone

1113
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
And so you're building like one profile

1114
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Or whatever

1115
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
So I thought that part was really cool

1116
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
And you know the points that you earn and stuff

1117
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Can go for the in-game currency

1118
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
That you use to play licensed music

1119
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
In the phone version

1120
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
So I thought that was really cool

1121
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
And you can do multiplayer

1122
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Across iPhone and the arcade machine

1123
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
And that's what the 30 seconds is for

1124
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Is that for those 30 seconds

1125
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Other players can join you

1126
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Unless you skip that out

1127
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
But

1128
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Excuse me

1129
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
But what we were able to do

1130
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
We had Shane was playing the machine

1131
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
He logged in

1132
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
He picked his song

1133
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
And as he was picking his song

1134
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
I went on my phone

1135
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
And I picked the same song

1136
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
And so I hit start now

1137
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Because he picked a licensed song

1138
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
I had to spend one of my in-game currency to do it

1139
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
But it was fine

1140
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
So as he was playing

1141
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
I was able to play the exact same song

1142
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Behind him on my phone

1143
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
And we were competing against each other basically

1144
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
I lost big time

1145
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Because I'm sorry

1146
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
You can't tap on your phone

1147
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
The same way you can smack those big buttons

1148
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
But I thought that was really fucking cool

1149
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
That you could play the same music game

1150
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
That the person is playing on the arcade

1151
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
But you're doing it on your account

1152
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
But you're playing

1153
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
I just thought that was really cool

1154
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
It reminded me of back in the day

1155
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
When Para Para was a big music game

1156
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
That everybody played

1157
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
That people would mimic the dances

1158
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Behind the person that was actually doing the dancing

1159
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
It kind of reminded me of that

1160
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
So

1161
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Loki, if you haven't checked out Neon FM

1162
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
I think that would be amazing to kick out of

1163
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Yeah

1164
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
So

1165
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
So

1166
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Yeah

1167
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
ActDeftInChat says

1168
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
That sounds pretty awesome

1169
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Yeah

1170
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
It was neat to play through that

1171
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
DrTouya says

1172
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
I've done that

1173
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Played people in the arcade version on my phone

1174
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
While I'm at home

1175
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Yeah

1176
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
You can do that

1177
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
So that's Neon FM's big selling point

1178
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
So congrats to those guys

1179
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
For finally getting their game out

1180
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
All these years later

1181
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
And

1182
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
I would say it paid off

1183
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Because

1184
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
I don't feel like I'm playing a 15 year old game

1185
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
They've put a very new modern spin on it

1186
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
With this whole linking the phones

1187
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
To the arcade machine

1188
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
So

1189
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Good job on you

1190
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Except

1191
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
That girl's butt song is fucking terrible

1192
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
And should be deleted from the game

1193
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
That's the only read I'm going to give on that game

1194
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Otherwise

1195
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Neon FM did a good job

1196
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
And there are a lot of great songs on it

1197
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
There really are

1198
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Is girl's butts also in the

1199
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Or the mole version

1200
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
The song list match

1201
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
At least as far as I've seen

1202
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
The exact same songs

1203
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Because it makes sense

1204
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Yeah

1205
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Yeah exactly

1206
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
I mean there's still some unlocks

1207
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
And they

1208
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
They actually

1209
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Like when you play enough songs

1210
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
It actually says

1211
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Coming on June 2nd

1212
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
This song

1213
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Coming on June 19th

1214
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
This song

1215
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
So they're

1216
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
I think that's kind of neat

1217
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
So

1218
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Anyway

1219
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
So yeah

1220
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
I would give a shout out

1221
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
For Neon FM

1222
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
And check that out on your mobile devices

1223
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
If you haven't already

1224
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
But while I was at the arcade

1225
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
I had no idea that this arcade

1226
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Was growing in music games

1227
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Because they had

1228
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
We looked over and we were like

1229
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Oh it's a DDR Supernova

1230
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Whatever

1231
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
And then when we give it a second look

1232
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
We were like

1233
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Wait a minute

1234
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
That's not Supernova

1235
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
That's DDR

1236
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Whatever

1237
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Not Ace

1238
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
2016

1239
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
2016 or 15

1240
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Or whatever was before Ace

1241
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Is that the one that was like

1242
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Cross second mix or something like that?

1243
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
No

1244
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
It was after that before Ace

1245
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
There was just

1246
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,000
It was the DDR reboot

1247
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
It was that game

1248
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
So we were like

1249
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Oh they just put that in a Supernova cabinet

1250
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
And then there was the brand new pump game

1251
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
That like just came

1252
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Shane was like

1253
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Oh my gosh

1254
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
It's the new pump game

1255
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
He's a big fan of pump

1256
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
He's like wow

1257
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
This like just came out

1258
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
And they have it here

1259
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
That's crazy

1260
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
But then here's the other thing

1261
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
That caught our eye

1262
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
And I was like

1263
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
I thought this game never happened

1264
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
They had an in the groove 3 cabinet

1265
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
And I was like

1266
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Wait a minute

1267
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Because it didn't happen

1268
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
In the groove 3 didn't fucking happen

1269
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Because Konami

1270
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
That is a custom cabinet

1271
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
That is a hell of a fucking custom cabinet

1272
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Because it has the signage

1273
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
It has

1274
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
It definitely has in the groove dance pads on it

1275
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
That's running straight up step mania

1276
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:31,000
And yeah it had 12,000 songs loaded on it

1277
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
And no shit it's running step mania

1278
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Because I was like

1279
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Okay whatever

1280
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
It's in the groove

1281
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
I'm here to play Neon FM

1282
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,000
And no shade against in the groove

1283
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
And DDR and all that stuff

1284
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
But the reality is

1285
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
I'm 38 years old and I'm out of shape

1286
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
I'm not gonna fucking dance in a public place

1287
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Because I can't do it like I used to

1288
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
I can't do it like I used to

1289
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Neon FM is fine

1290
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
That's a lot of songs to sort through

1291
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
But then

1292
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
So yeah I just was like

1293
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Okay whatever

1294
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Cool they have it

1295
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
You know we were kind of like

1296
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Just didn't pay it a second mind

1297
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
But then as we were playing Neon FM

1298
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Some other guy got up there

1299
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
We kind of looked over

1300
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
And I was like

1301
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Wait a minute

1302
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
There's nothing but fucking DDR songs on it

1303
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
I mean I just saw

1304
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
1-2 Little Bitch

1305
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
0-0-0-7

1306
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Like all the songs

1307
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
That would be in a DDR fourth mix plus

1308
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
And I was like

1309
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
The fuck

1310
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
And we kind of give it a second look

1311
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
And we're like

1312
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Oh my god

1313
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
This thing is like

1314
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
This in the groove three

1315
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
And then like Shane and I

1316
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Started to piece it together

1317
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
We were like

1318
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Wait a minute

1319
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Wasn't in the groove three

1320
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
The one where they kind of gave

1321
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
That final F you to Konami

1322
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Right as they were getting sued

1323
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Where they opened up the USB stick

1324
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
So you could load anything on it

1325
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Right

1326
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Nah it's just a step mini machine

1327
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Wow

1328
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
That's all it is

1329
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
So

1330
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,000
I did not know those machines actually existed

1331
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
And now that I've talked about it

1332
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Openly on a podcast

1333
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
That many

1334
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Not many people

1335
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
But some people listen to

1336
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Including some of the industry

1337
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Maybe that machine won't be there much longer

1338
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
I don't know

1339
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Yeah they could get in pretty big trouble for

1340
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Don't

1341
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
You guys don't

1342
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
No

1343
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
To those listening

1344
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Don't shut it down

1345
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Come on

1346
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
It's not hurting anybody being there

1347
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
You know what it's doing

1348
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
It's reminding people

1349
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Of the glory days of 15 years ago

1350
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Just let it be

1351
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
It's not fucking

1352
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Hurting sales of anything

1353
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
So just like

1354
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Yeah because Rockstar can't sue

1355
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Because Rockstar's not there anymore

1356
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Konami might sue but you know

1357
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Let in the groove three be

1358
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Let it be at peace

1359
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Maybe

1360
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
I don't

1361
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
So that was weird

1362
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
There must be something going on there

1363
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
I fully expect

1364
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
That we're gonna see

1365
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Kyle's new game

1366
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
StepMania X

1367
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Or whatever

1368
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
StepMania X

1369
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
I fully expect that thing

1370
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Is gonna end up

1371
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
At the same place

1372
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
That's actually out in the wild

1373
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Because

1374
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Just based on the music games

1375
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
I'm seeing there

1376
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
I'm like

1377
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Okay

1378
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
How weird to go to this arcade

1379
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
And like the vast majority of it

1380
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Is ticket spitters

1381
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
When we walked in there

1382
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
We were like

1383
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Oh

1384
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
That thing was a lie

1385
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
There's not gonna be a fucking

1386
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Neon FM here

1387
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
There's nothing but ticket spitters here

1388
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
But in the back corner

1389
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
It was like

1390
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Oh all these fucking music games

1391
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Right next to each other

1392
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
There's room for more

1393
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Yes

1394
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Secret Club says

1395
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Act Deaf

1396
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Yes that's very true

1397
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Act Deaf says

1398
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
This week's secret club

1399
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Is that

1400
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
In the Groove StepMania machine

1401
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Very true

1402
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Very true

1403
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Alright

1404
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Orange Right says

1405
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
I remember playing two of them in Reno

1406
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Not an ITG themed one

1407
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Two StepMania machines

1408
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
You know

1409
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Maybe the software in it

1410
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Wasn't in the Groove 3

1411
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Maybe it was like that

1412
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
DDR

1413
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
You know

1414
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Cause I didn't take a second look

1415
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Maybe you're right

1416
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Maybe it wasn't really in the Groove 3

1417
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
It just had the signage for it

1418
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
It was just fucking

1419
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
StepMania in a cabinet

1420
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
It is StepMania in a cabinet

1421
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
They have an In the Groove 3 theme

1422
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Now there's been some pretty awesome

1423
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Like In the Groove 3 skins

1424
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
That people have done

1425
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Or like actual cabinets that people have made

1426
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
I even went on to Wikipedia

1427
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Now here's it

1428
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
For you Wikipedia folks

1429
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
K

1430
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
It says on Wikipedia

1431
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
In the Groove 3 was cancelled

1432
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Due to such and such and such

1433
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
It says it right there on Wikipedia

1434
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Bitch I just saw one

1435
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
It was not

1436
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
It happened

1437
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
It happened

1438
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
It happened somehow

1439
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
But it's apparently this giant secret

1440
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Those pics didn't happen

1441
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
You have to know

1442
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
I fucking posted a picture on Twitter

1443
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Source that bitch

1444
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
It happened

1445
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
I would source my fucking Twitter

1446
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
On Wikipedia

1447
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Do it

1448
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Anyway

1449
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
D'Artesia says

1450
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
I think In the Groove 3 was a fan thing

1451
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Maybe I don't know

1452
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
I'm just saying

1453
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
It was a convincing fucking cabinet

1454
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
I you know I

1455
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
It's not like

1456
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Kyle's a busy guy

1457
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
But I'm sure he would answer an email

1458
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
If I sent him a picture

1459
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
And I'd be like

1460
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Explain this

1461
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Of course I don't want the response to be

1462
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Where was that

1463
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Anyway alright

1464
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
That looks like a

1465
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Isn't that a solo machine cabinet

1466
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
No that's not a solo machine

1467
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
No the floor was In the Groove

1468
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
I reckon

1469
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
The floor

1470
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
It's probably just an In the Groove machine

1471
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
That they put new

1472
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
It was a widescreen thing

1473
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
It was not In the Groove

1474
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Fucking win in DDR cabinets

1475
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Okay

1476
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
It's a custom cabinet

1477
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
That someone made

1478
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Anyway

1479
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
It's probably custom

1480
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Alright

1481
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,000
I could just see the source on Wikipedia right now

1482
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Episode 685 Orange Lounge Radio

1483
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Bitch I'm looking right at one

1484
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
I just like

1485
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
I love the

1486
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Wait In the Groove 3 happened?

1487
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
The emoji's like

1488
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Wait a second

1489
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Let me think about this

1490
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
That's cause that's what I thought

1491
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
I was like wait a minute

1492
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
I'm confused

1493
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Wikipedia told me it was cancelled

1494
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
I'm looking right at it

1495
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
TigerClodChat says

1496
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Sounds like In the Groove 3 is this year's polybus

1497
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Possibly

1498
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Act Def says

1499
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Looking at the photo it kind of looks like a pump it up machine

1500
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Okay

1501
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Wasn't there a pump it up

1502
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,000
That was In the Groove infused

1503
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
And it was four panel

1504
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Not five

1505
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Or am I crazy

1506
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
I

1507
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Okay I realized that the steps

1508
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
You can't see in the picture

1509
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
I didn't

1510
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
I should have thought to include the whole fucking thing

1511
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
But the steps

1512
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Were an In the Groove dance thing

1513
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Because it was like those orange blue arrows

1514
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
That you see in In the Groove

1515
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
So that's what it was

1516
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
It was not a five panel like pump

1517
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
It was a four panel

1518
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
They can custom make that stuff though

1519
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Maybe

1520
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Cause it's just a cabinet

1521
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
And then you get like a DDR panel

1522
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
You know eight

1523
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Or you know

1524
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Sixteen panel

1525
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Not sixteen panel

1526
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Eight panel

1527
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Set up stage or whatever

1528
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
And you just replace the arrows out of it

1529
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Alright

1530
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Alright we've talked

1531
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
We talked a long time about this

1532
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
I'm ready to move on

1533
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
But I just

1534
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
You know as a long time music game fan

1535
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
It was

1536
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
It was

1537
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
It was that poly bus moment of

1538
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Wait a minute

1539
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
What

1540
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
What the fuck is this doing here

1541
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Especially

1542
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Here

1543
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Like not the bay area

1544
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Not Seattle

1545
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
I would have fully expected to see one in Seattle

1546
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Cause that's where all that

1547
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Stuff started

1548
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
But um

1549
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Here

1550
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Like what

1551
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Anyway it was weird

1552
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Anyway

1553
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Maybe I'll get an email or tweet about it this week

1554
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Say Rob I wish you hadn't talked about that but

1555
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Sorry

1556
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Well you know what

1557
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
I'm sorry

1558
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
If you didn't want anybody

1559
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Nobody

1560
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
You don't put it in the middle of a fucking arcade

1561
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Yes

1562
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
I might be

1563
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
What did you think was gonna fucking happen

1564
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
I mean

1565
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
As I said

1566
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
The powers that be in the legal folks out there

1567
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Just

1568
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
It's not hurting anybody

1569
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
In fact

1570
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
I was

1571
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
It made me smile

1572
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
To be like

1573
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
If I wanna go fucking play

1574
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Conga feeling

1575
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Or some of those old things

1576
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Cause all the

1577
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Cause I'll tell you what

1578
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Down the street at Roseville Golf Land

1579
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
That Max 2 machine needs to be euthanized

1580
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
It needs to be taken out back to the barn

1581
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
And shot in the

1582
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
It just

1583
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
It needs to be killed

1584
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Because it is

1585
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
It is horrific

1586
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
In horrific shape

1587
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
So I can only imagine

1588
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
There's probably very few number of fourth mix

1589
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
And fourth mix plus out there

1590
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
That are still in good shape

1591
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Like

1592
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Probably private owners

1593
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
That take good fucking care of them

1594
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
But like

1595
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Things that have been out there

1596
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
In the arcades and stuff

1597
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
They're

1598
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
They're

1599
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
They're all gonna be hurting

1600
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
So you know what

1601
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
I'm glad that

1602
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
It lives on

1603
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Through this

1604
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
So it made me happy so

1605
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
And just give it another season of wet feet

1606
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
From you know

1607
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
The water slides

1608
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Slopping all over the Max 2 machines

1609
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Well luckily

1610
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Luckily a bowling alley

1611
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Doesn't have that problem

1612
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Alright

1613
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Alright

1614
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Oh

1615
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Pump it up prime

1616
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Says act deft

1617
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
And actually links me to a picture

1618
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Of pump it up prime

1619
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,000
See but the floor's different

1620
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
The screen looks

1621
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
No but the screen didn't say pump it up on it

1622
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Look at my picture

1623
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
It didn't say pump at the bottom

1624
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
So

1625
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
But yes

1626
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Pump it up prime

1627
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Was the one that was in the

1628
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Alright I don't know

1629
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
You know what

1630
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
I'm just gonna fucking email Kyle

1631
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Alright

1632
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
This is a custom camera man

1633
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
I'm just gonna fucking do it

1634
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Alright

1635
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Let's get into it

1636
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Let's talk about

1637
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
What's been going on in gaming

1638
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
I do want to quickly plug

1639
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000

1652
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
We are looking to

1653
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Kind of plug and promote

So if you are interested in

1657
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Having one of us on your podcast

1658
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Or shit if the timing works out

1659
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Maybe all of us

1660
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
We can be hard to get all in the

1661
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Same place at one point

1662
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
But just email us

1663
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000

Orange Lounge Radio dot com

1665
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
And we're really just trying to

1666
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Promote and get out there

1667
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
So we would love to come on

1668
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Your show

1669
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Um

1670
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Let's get started with some

1671
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Gaming news for the week

1672
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Loki

1673
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Yes

1674
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
So apparently the Oculus

1675
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Um

1676
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
What was it

1677
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Oculus story studio

1678
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Has

1679
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Closed down

1680
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Now the Oculus story studio

1681
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
If you're not familiar with that

1682
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Was supposed to be releasing

1683
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Some VR enhanced

1684
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Um

1685
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Movies

1686
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
So they had three that they had

1687
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Worked on and released

1688
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Lost Henry and Dear Angelica

1689
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
And you know they had some

1690
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Big name stars doing the voices

1691
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
In these movies as well

1692
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
But I guess according to

1693
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Um

1694
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
The Oculus VP of content

1695
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Jason Rubin

1696
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Um

1697
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
They're still looking to film

1698
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
VR projects

1699
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
But

1700
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
You know ongoing projects

1701
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
From the Oculus story studio

1702
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Have been cancelled

1703
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
And of course the three

1704
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
That have been released so far

1705
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Are still on the store

1706
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
They're not going to be

1707
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Delisted or anything like that

1708
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
So

1709
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Yeah

1710
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
That's um

1711
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
That's unfortunate

1712
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
But I guess it makes sense

1713
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Because there's not a lot of

1714
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Eyes hitting that stuff right now

1715
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
I mean you're talking about

1716
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
You know people that have

1717
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
VR

1718
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
You know headsets and stuff

1719
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
On the Oculus

1720
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Which is a closed store front

1721
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
And then people that are going to

1722
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Be interested in actually

1723
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Viewing these

1724
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Like movies

1725
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
That's a really small market

1726
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
That you're hitting right there

1727
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
It's just

1728
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Maybe when it's more mainstream

1729
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Bobby and I were talking about

1730
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
This in one of our chats earlier

1731
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Um

1732
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
And he said he's actually seen

1733
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Those movies

1734
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,000
And that they were

1735
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
They were good

1736
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
So

1737
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
It's kind of

1738
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Kind of a bummer to see it go

1739
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,000
But that's a really

1740
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,000
High caliber of talent

1741
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Which tells me

1742
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
It's expensive talent

1743
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
So this probably wasn't a cheap

1744
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Endeavor

1745
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
By

1746
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Especially

1747
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
If the quality of the films

1748
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Ended up being good too

1749
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
I mean it was probably

1750
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
It probably cost them to do it

1751
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
So you know

1752
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Again

1753
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,000
You gotta make money

1754
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Right

1755
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
So if they just weren't selling

1756
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Enough

1757
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
To justify it

1758
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Then

1759
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,000
They gotta do what they gotta do

1760
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
But

1761
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
It may be just something that's

1762
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Before it's time

1763
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Yeah

1764
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
And that could be the case too

1765
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
And you know they do say they're

1766
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Looking at

1767
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,000
You know funding

1768
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Other VR film projects

1769
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
So

1770
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Maybe

1771
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Maybe it's just something

1772
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
The indie scene is gonna have to

1773
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Pick up and run with

1774
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
I don't know

1775
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
I'm still surprised though

1776
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
We haven't had that

1777
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Well

1778
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Maybe this is out there

1779
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,000
And I'm just not aware of it

1780
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Because I'm not an Oculus owner

1781
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
And I don't use

1782
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
You know a lot of the VR stuff

1783
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Yet

1784
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,000
But

1785
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,000
We're finally getting a

1786
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Gear VR in the house

1787
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Because

1788
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
When Alan bought his phone

1789
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
They were running a promotion

1790
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Or whatever

1791
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Because he got one of those new

1792
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
SAs or whatever

1793
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Yeah I have no idea

1794
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Yeah he got a

1795
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Thing of that

1796
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
So

1797
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
I'm surprised that Facebook

1798
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Hasn't injected more VR

1799
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Into the news feed yet

1800
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
I know

1801
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Like some of it's there

1802
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
I see like 360 video

1803
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
So I'm

1804
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,000
What

1805
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
I'm sure you could put that on

1806
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
An Oculus headset

1807
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,000
And you could see the 360 video

1808
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,000
But I feel like

1809
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Isn't that the direction

1810
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Where Facebook wants to be

1811
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
When they're shoving that video

1812
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Stuff down your throat

1813
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
And they're really trying to

1814
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Like so and so is life

1815
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Like

1816
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,000
There's gonna be a time

1817
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Yeah but I don't think

1818
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,000
When

1819
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
There's gonna be a time when

1820
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
You don't have to strand yourself

1821
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
On a desert island

1822
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
To go see the fire festival

1823
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,000
You could see it live in VR

1824
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Maybe that

1825
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Maybe that's how

1826
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Fire Festival 2018

1827
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Will happen

1828
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000
It's from the safety

1829
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Of your own damn home

1830
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Because we can't figure out

1831
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,000
How to you know

1832
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Build a temporary home

1833
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,000
From the safety of your home

1834
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,000
In VR

1835
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Fully in VR

1836
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
On

1837
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Oculus Rift

1838
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Although

1839
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Obviously

1840
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
You don't want that fucking name

1841
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Anywhere near your product

1842
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Right now

1843
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Honestly

1844
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,000
The fire festival is like

1845
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
The beginning of a

1846
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Horror action movie

1847
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Or a thriller

1848
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Or something like that

1849
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Where you trick all these people

1850
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,000
And they're going on

1851
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,000
To a deserted island

1852
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
And then there's some

1853
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Fight to the death

1854
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,000
I mean that's really

1855
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Really pieces of

1856
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Sort of missing from

1857
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,000
That survivor

1858
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,000
The Hunger Games type thing

1859
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,000
You know

1860
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,000
It's like

1861
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Oh shit we got on this island

1862
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,000
To go see this festival

1863
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
It's like

1864
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Was it Blink 182

1865
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Or something like that

1866
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Was that

1867
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000

2268
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:51,000
I saw a cannon that shot cannons. So that was kind of fun. A cannon that shoots cannons. A cannon that shot cannons, yeah.

2269
02:04:51,000 --> 02:05:04,000
So it is kind of unfortunate that they are taking that. Basically it says you don't need to buy. They found a way around the bands as well.

2270
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:12,000
You basically own two consoles. You don't need to buy a new console each time you get banned. If you have two consoles you can get around this an infinite number of bands using the system transfer option.

2271
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:18,000
And apparently that's how he's gotten around the bands. He's been banned twice. But that's kind of funny.

2272
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:24,000
Would you like to know why they are no longer updating Super Mario Maker?

2273
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:32,000
Probably because it's coming out on the Switch. Mario Maker Deluxe is going to fucking happen on the Switch. Let's say first quarter next year.

2274
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:44,000
And it will include the skins from Super Mario All Stars. I can't say Mario 2 because Mario 2 is a very different game because of the whole fact that it was created from the Japanese game.

2275
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:50,000
But they could create some items from Mario 2 or something. They could. You can have the stackable mushrooms or something like that.

2276
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:56,000
But Mario All Stars would be perfect. Mario All Stars would be perfect because those sprites already exist.

2277
02:05:56,000 --> 02:06:02,000
And they could just. Especially from the original Mario. They could just put them right in there. And that will be Mario Maker Deluxe.

2278
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:10,000
And a few new items. A few new things. And that will be Mario Maker Deluxe on the Switch. Because this whole. The fact that Mario Kart 8 sold as well as it did.

2279
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:20,000
Here we go. Open them fucking floodgates because here come the Wii U ports on Switch. But you know what? Honestly. Mario Kart 8 is pretty fucking good actually.

2280
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:27,000
So I. And if it means Bayonetta 2 gets another chance. I can't hate on this.

2281
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:37,000
But I understand that. But I own Mario Kart 8. And I just have trouble justifying the system to play Mario Kart 8 that has Battle Mode in it.

2282
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:45,000
Because you know what? You can't fucking tell me that the Wii U can't handle Battle Mode. It fucking had Battle Mode in there.

2283
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:51,000
And you know what? It's a god damn insult that they're not updating the Wii U version to go along with that.

2284
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:57,000
I'm sorry. It's insulting that. Oh well you know we made this really cool thing that we really should have done in the beginning.

2285
02:06:57,000 --> 02:07:01,000
But guess what? You're gonna pay to get another $60 for it. You know what? Fuck them. That's what I'm saying.

2286
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:08,000
Seriously? Fuck them in this. Oh hey yeah we could fix these problems. But fuck you guys. Buy our new system.

2287
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:16,000
That's not how it's gonna work. And you know why fucking Mario Kart 8 sold so well? Because there's no fucking games on the god damn system. It's the next biggest game.

2288
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:22,000
Disagree. Disagree. Mario Kart 8 sold well because for most people that aren't you or me. It's their first Mario Kart 8.

2289
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:27,000
Because a lot of people skipped the fucking Wii U. That's. That's what it is. That's why Mario Kart 8 sold.

2290
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:33,000
I doubt it. I think it's really just the next big game that's from Nintendo that's on that platform. And that's why it's released on there.

2291
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:44,000
I'm sorry. It's not because it's the first Mario Kart game for them. Because you can't tell me that these people didn't have like Mario Kart 7 or any of the other games.

2292
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:51,000
It's their first Mario Kart 8. Because most people didn't buy the Wii U. So this is their first Mario Kart 8.

2293
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:57,000
And they're like wow this game is fucking feature filled right off the bat because they skipped Mario. They skipped the Wii U completely.

2294
02:07:57,000 --> 02:08:05,000
That's nice that they have a feature filled game. I wish I could get that because I paid the same $60 and actually more than that because I supported them with their DLC.

2295
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:11,000
So where's my fucking reward for my loyalty? Oh that's right. Fuck you. Buy our $400 system with another game.

2296
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:18,000
Alright. Here's a game that I don't think is planned for the Switch. I don't remember the original Kickstarter.

2297
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:27,000
But this team called No Matter is making a game called Pray for the Gods. It was a kickstarted action RPG and get this.

2298
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:33,000
They've had to change the name this week because it was called P-R-E-Y for the gods. Pray for the gods.

2299
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:42,000
Well you may have missed this week or maybe you didn't miss. Bethesda released a game called Pray this week which was an update to a game.

2300
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:47,000
Although I don't think the games really have that much in common. Name only that's it.

2301
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:54,000
Yeah like is it still like to be fair I have not played the new Pray but I beat the old Pray.

2302
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:57,000
The new Pray is nothing like the old Pray at all.

2303
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:59,000
So like the Native American themes and all that are gone?

2304
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:05,000
Nope. It's not even in there. You like take the forms of different things. Like you can jump in.

2305
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:12,000
It has more to do. It reminds me of like what was that game. It was. It had a fucking cherub in it.

2306
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:18,000
And I'm trying to remember what the hell it was called. It was. Oh god. I can't remember what it's called now.

2307
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:23,000
But they had like a. There was a cherub in it. You could take control of different people and stuff.

2308
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:30,000
DungeonBuster in chat says the new Pray is more like Bioshock in space. That's not the first person I've heard say that basically.

2309
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:34,000
But anyway so Pray is out obviously but now you've got this other game Pray for the Gods.

2310
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:42,000
And so they got basically threatened with legal stuff from Zenimax Bethesda over the trademark.

2311
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:46,000
So you may remember. This is not the first time Bethesda has done this.

2312
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:52,000
Do you remember when they threatened against Mojang because they were doing a game called Scrolls.

2313
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:55,000
And they were going to do. You know obviously Bethesda.

2314
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:59,000
I don't understand how they get the trademark for such a common name in the first place.

2315
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:01,000
That's a great fucking question.

2316
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:05,000
I mean that is stupid. It's a single name. It's very commonly used.

2317
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:09,000
And like the fact that they're going after other games. They have nothing to fucking do with it.

2318
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:10,000
Ahem. Saga.

2319
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:15,000
Exactly. It's our fucking trademark and copyright system is so goddamn messed up.

2320
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:20,000
But what's interesting because Notch had all that Minecraft money. He did fight Zenimax in court.

2321
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:23,000
But they did. They settled. They didn't actually go to court.

2322
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:28,000
They did use. Mojang got to use the name Scrolls but they could not own the trademark for it.

2323
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:32,000
But Scrolls never really came. I mean it was in beta. They did like a free beta.

2324
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:36,000
That's as far as that game ever got. Like they never really did a full release that game.

2325
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:40,000
This has nothing to do with it. It's like Fighter. Or like you know what the what they.

2326
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
Which is what all the games.

2327
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:43,000
It's like copywriting the.

2328
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:49,000
Okay but back in the day. Like on the Atari 2600. That's what those fucking games were called.

2329
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:54,000
You had Boxing. Pitfall. Adventure.

2330
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:57,000
Like these were the games.

2331
02:10:57,000 --> 02:11:03,000
Exactly. You like but I'm surprised that they get that kind of a copyright. They get the trademark for Prey.

2332
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:09,000
It's such a commonly used name. I mean it's just a word. It's one word.

2333
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:18,000
And you're telling me that like all these other games that that word is off limits now because of fucking Bethesda and their shitty game. Fuck that.

2334
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:27,000
Well they have had to change the name to the new name of the game is Prey for the gods. It is P R A E Y for the gods.

2335
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:30,000
That's stupid. It's fucking dumb.

2336
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:34,000
I don't blame the developer for that. I kind of credit them.

2337
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:45,000
No I blame Bethesda for this because the reason why you would file a lawsuit like this is because that there could be some confusion between Prey their game and Prey this game and pray for the gods.

2338
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:54,000
It's like totally different. You look at the two games are fucking completely different. There's nothing similar about them other than they work on game. They probably both on PC.

2339
02:11:55,000 --> 02:12:04,000
What's interesting though is that in the developer update they actually mentioned that one of the games. One of the names they were originally considering was P R A E Y for the gods.

2340
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:11,000
But that A and E was that special character where the A and E are linked. Darsagre you know more about writing than I do.

2341
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:17,000
Yeah. What do you call that when the A and E are linked together. It's like it's a specific alphabet like it's a Greek character.

2342
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:23,000
Give me a moment because I know it's not a ligature. That is not a ligature. Hold on.

2343
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:32,000
Okay. But here's the thing is that that A and E as a combined letter you can't Google that. I mean you can but you can't. People aren't going to do it.

2344
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:35,000
So now they're just going to call it P R A E Y.

2345
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:47,000
Actually it was originally a ligature and then it became its own letter coming actually from classic Greek and Latin and also used in Old English.

2346
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:56,000
Why are they suing Fallout Boy? I might confuse Fallout Boy with a fucking post apocalyptic RPG because that's certainly fucking similar.

2347
02:12:56,000 --> 02:13:01,000
Well Fallout Boy needs to be sued for a lot of reasons. I'm just kidding. I'm just hating for no reason.

2348
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:09,000
You know why they did it? Because they're small. They're a big company and that's a small company and they can fucking get away with it. Those fucking assholes.

2349
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:11,000
It's called an ash by the way.

2350
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:13,000
They're an ash. Thank you.

2351
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:24,000
Because Fallout Boy is in the name of a video game. You know what? Blackfall I understand that but this game has nothing to fucking do with their game other than the name and the name is not even the same.

2352
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:30,000
They both make digital disc media. Fallout Boy makes CDs.

2353
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
And a Playstation is a computer.

2354
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:36,000
Vault Boy is in there. I mean Fallout Boy, Vault Boy.

2355
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:37,000
Alright.

2356
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:39,000
It's a boy that's in Fallout.

2357
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:42,000
I need a pallet cleanser. This is getting too heated. Alright moving on.

2358
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:45,000
Dark Sakura take us away. Take us somewhere else.

2359
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:46,000
How about Andromeda?

2360
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
How about space? Yes.

2361
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:53,000
So um mods have finally legitimately happened in Mass Effect Andromeda.

2362
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:59,000
There is a new mod tool and I have already downloaded the best of all possible mods called Shut Up Sam.

2363
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:06,000
Where you know how every time you go into like it's really hot. The weather has increased.

2364
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:10,000
Okay thank you. It's fucking cold on vault. Duh.

2365
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
Or there's radiation. Duh.

2366
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
It happens every- Sam doesn't shut up.

2367
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:19,000
So the first mod I downloaded was one where Sam shuts the fuck up.

2368
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:28,000
Um but there is um there's a few other ones out there too and there's full installation um instructions on uh the nexus.

2369
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:29,000
For nexus mods.

2370
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:37,000
Um and there's even um one that helps you back up and recover your game with how it was and you know before.

2371
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:46,000
There's also like external mods that they did have out that honestly just about every game has had out those like cinematic and color pallet adjusting ones.

2372
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:54,000
But now um they finally they also have one that lets you use like any skin color in uh no matter what default that you choose.

2373
02:14:54,000 --> 02:15:01,000
Um how to change your outfits. It's gonna it's not gonna be too long before we have uh custom elements in there too.

2374
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:04,000
It didn't take them you know terribly long for Dragon Age.

2375
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:07,000
So let's just say it. The mods are there.

2376
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:12,000
Go forth and mod. Go forth and mod.

2377
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:15,000
So full booby rider? Is that?

2378
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:18,000
There actually is um a naked mod.

2379
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:21,000
Of course there is! That's always one of the first.

2380
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:24,000
That's like a prerequisite. Modding yeah.

2381
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:28,000
Your game hasn't made it till somebody put boobies and dong in it.

2382
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:33,000
I'm still looking for that inquisition mod that restores the iron bull to his former glory.

2383
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:35,000
You knew about that right?

2384
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:36,000
No I didn't.

2385
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:41,000
They apparently modded his dick. Not modded um they uh modeled it.

2386
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:51,000
And then when it was about ready to publish it finally got caught so now it's a big black rectangle where his junk is.

2387
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:59,000
And if you go look like Flycam stuff I'll find it but yeah it's the the big black box.

2388
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:04,000
Sorry guys they're telling me live that my mic cut out for 30 seconds when I didn't do it.

2389
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:09,000
There's no power switch on these mics so it must be something like I reset my connection here.

2390
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:14,000
Uh but I wouldn't be surprised at how much these mics get handled. There's some shorted wire or something.

2391
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:18,000
It's been a while since we've replaced all these mics and that that might be coming soon.

2392
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:23,000
I don't know these are the ones that uh Brad from Pod Culture so kindly passed down to us.

2393
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:27,000
So that means he used them then we used them. These mics are probably on their last legs.

2394
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:35,000
So we just might we might have to spend some money that I don't have to uh to to modernize this fucking studio.

2395
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:39,000
That might be a project. That's why I'm going to keep screaming streaming screaming onto it.

2396
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:45,000
I'll scream as I stream on Twitch uh to raise money to uh redo all our studios.

2397
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:46,000
That'll be funny.

2398
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:49,000
Alright anyway.

2399
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
Tigerclaw says yeah you need some better quality mics.

2400
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:53,000
I'm putting it in the chat by the way.

2401
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:56,000
You know what? We do the best we can.

2402
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:59,000
There you go. There's naked Iron Bull.

2403
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:03,000
Hooray. Alright just a couple more stories for you guys and then we'll get your calls.

2404
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:09,000
Let's see how shitty your mics sound on Skype at Orange Lounge Radio. All one word on Skype. Loki.

2405
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:20,000
Alright so like many modern uh video games that are out um they have finally added in the Horizon Zero Dawn a selfie mode.

2406
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:29,000
That's right you can take different poses um or take photos of different poses that Aloy can make in the game and add little tidbits and stuff to it.

2407
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:38,000
For example um you can you know form Aloy's hands into the shape of a heart or she can be lounging on her back or several different face expressions.

2408
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:44,000
You can add filters. You can even put like a postcard greetings from blah blah blah you know type thing in there.

2409
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:51,000
So that is available um I guess they're going to be coming soon with some more updates along with that.

2410
02:17:51,000 --> 02:18:00,000
But yeah I mean it makes sense now that a lot of games have done that and it really kind of helps drive the awareness on social media for them.

2411
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:09,000
Like Grand Theft Auto. I think Grand Theft Auto 5 was probably one of the first ones that really did that heavily in there as like a kind of an in game feature so.

2412
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:11,000
Yeah cool.

2413
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:15,000
Yeah and uh the selfie mode in Zelda was always the one.

2414
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:20,000
Or actually you know they also did that in Infamous Second Son I think.

2415
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:21,000
That's right they did.

2416
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:26,000
That was that was I think but um Grand Theft Auto to be fair was out before that so.

2417
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:35,000
A lot of people were using their PlayStation 4 Pros with that because that was one of the games that you know was was supposed to be bigger and better on the Pro was uh Infamous so.

2418
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:37,000
Alright well finally.

2419
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:38,000
Speaking of a game I haven't finished yeah.

2420
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:43,000
Finally tonight did you know they're making a movie out of Rampage.

2421
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:47,000
You know the classic 80's game about monsters invading town.

2422
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:50,000
Come on y'all have played this game you had to have played Rampage at some point in your life.

2423
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:55,000
Uh the movie is being directed by Brad Payton who made the movie San Andreas.

2424
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:57,000
Not to be confused with Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.

2425
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:58,000
And who does it star?

2426
02:18:58,000 --> 02:18:59,000
Why the Rock.

2427
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:02,000
Dwayne Johnson is the star of this movie.

2428
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:06,000
And uh guess what there is now a synopsis out there that came out this week.

2429
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:10,000
Uh so uh the Rock plays a primatologist.

2430
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:15,000
A man who keeps people at a distance shares an unshakable bond with George.

2431
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:19,000
The extraordinarily intelligent silverback gorilla who's been in his care since birth.

2432
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:26,000
But a rogue genetic experiment gone ary transforms this gentle ape into a raging monster.

2433
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:31,000
To make matters worse it's soon discovered that there are similarly altered alpha predators.

2434
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:36,000
As these newly created monsters tear across North America destroying everything in their path.

2435
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:40,000
The Rock teams with a discredited genetic engineer to secure an antidote.

2436
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:42,000
Fighting his way through an ever changing battlefield.

2437
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:48,000
Not only to haul a global catastrophe but to save the fearsome creature that was once his friend.

2438
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:52,000
I'll make room on the shelf next to the dumpies for this one.

2439
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:56,000
Because this does not sound that exciting to me but who knows.

2440
02:19:56,000 --> 02:20:05,000
Uh by the way it was stated previously by the director that the film would be more emotional, scarier, and real.

2441
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:09,000
You know what's funny is my phone apparently thought when he said make room on the shelf.

2442
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:14,000
Um was basically okay google which is kind of annoying.

2443
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:17,000
I fucking just turn off you piece of crap.

2444
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:20,000
Yeah you need to disable that stuff.

2445
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:27,000
Oh it enabled itself when it you know fucking updated to uh nougat or whatever this I don't know what the fuck it's on now.

2446
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:30,000
So if I say okay google it comes up.

2447
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,000
I will make oh yep there it goes.

2448
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,000
Download lots of porn.

2449
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
Hey it did that sweet.

2450
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:44,000
It brought me to uh let's see it says it's what does it say here.

2451
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:49,000
Wait search for I'll make you get it get up there goes download lots of porn.

2452
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:55,000
I think it I think all it is bring up like some weird like oops.

2453
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:58,000
Yeah I just realized Ricky and Gleese is lyrics.

2454
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:01,000
That's some weird shit.

2455
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:08,000
Yeah um I I just realized there might be podcast listeners listening on speakers that now I just set off all their phones too.

2456
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:09,000
Good job.

2457
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:11,000
Turn that turn that stuff off.

2458
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:12,000
Turn it off.

2459
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:13,000
You don't need it.

2460
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:18,000
Uh let's see Brad from Pod Culture says the phone will respond again.

2461
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:26,000
Alright Orange Lounge Radio all one word on Skype if you want to give us a call and say hello.

2462
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:30,000
Talk about something we've talked about tonight or maybe something of your own choosing.

2463
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:33,000
Anyhow before we get to that do you have any last minute stories Loki?

2464
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:35,000
I think we kind of tapped out on everything.

2465
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:38,000
That barrel is scraped to the bottom so.

2466
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:39,000
What about FUs?

2467
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:40,000
Oh you want to do some FUs tonight?

2468
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:41,000
Oh heck yeah.

2469
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:42,000
Let's do it.

2470
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:43,000
I've got plenty to FU.

2471
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:45,000
We got a call coming in we'll do FUs after this so let's get to it.

2472
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:47,000
Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this?

2473
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:50,000
It's me Rama.

2474
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:51,000
Hi Rama how are you?

2475
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:52,000
I'm good.

2476
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:56,000
I have a question for you and Jamie right now.

2477
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:58,000
What are you going to leave Matt out of this?

2478
02:21:58,000 --> 02:21:59,000
I'm cool with this.

2479
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:05,000
Well Matt is residential god of anger against Nintendo so but.

2480
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:06,000
Okay.

2481
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:09,000
I think it's between you and Jamie.

2482
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:14,000
Which one of y'all is the biggest saint of throwing shade tonight?

2483
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:15,000
I mean come on.

2484
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:20,000
I don't know Dark Soccer was pretty good on that email earlier.

2485
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:22,000
Rob is a sassy bitch though.

2486
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:39,000
Yeah I don't know I don't know I think we're but we're but we see we both went to that show last night so now we're both like oh we're gonna be Bianca Del Rio today and just throw a bunch of shade so I I don't know it's it's gonna be a close race till the end of the show ain't over Rama.

2487
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:42,000
Lord Jesus that's all I gotta say.

2488
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:43,000
You want us to read you?

2489
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:45,000
Just kidding.

2490
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:54,000
Rob I have Mako-chan that does that to me on a regular basis especially when we do our show okay I get I get enough from her.

2491
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:59,000
Alright I'm glad someone's giving it to you.

2492
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:02,000
You should have seen us last week in Good Lord Almighty.

2493
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:06,000
Alright anything else on your mind besides shade throwing?

2494
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:25,000
I just gotta say when you were talking about playing DDR at your age earlier in the show I am about your age and I still get up there and I play I think I need to give you some tips on you know trying to get up there still.

2495
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:30,000
Now I don't want to turn this into a race thing Rama but I'm gonna.

2496
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:33,000
Just so you know I'm just busting your balls because I love you.

2497
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:38,000
I know and I love you too but I am gonna go racial with this for a minute Rama.

2498
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:46,000
Your people have a better natural talent than my people when it comes to dancing.

2499
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:49,000
Okay okay okay Rob I want you to know something.

2500
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:54,000
That natural gift skipped my black ass okay?

2501
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:58,000
I cannot dance unless I am on the pads okay?

2502
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:03,000
Damn that's the thing about stereotypes they're not always true damn.

2503
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:16,000
Exactly while everybody was growing up learning how to break dance and all that I was at home playing Super Mario Brothers 2, Super Mario Brothers 3, Super Mario I was doing all of that.

2504
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:20,000
That doesn't impede one's ability to dance.

2505
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:22,000
Yes it does.

2506
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:25,000
Some people also are way out of practice like me.

2507
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:27,000
I think it's more of that Rama.

2508
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:30,000
Look here's the deal.

2509
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:34,000
I don't know how much you, this is a personal question I do not expect you to answer.

2510
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:40,000
I don't know how much you weigh now versus when you were let's say 15 years ago which for me would be 23 years old.

2511
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:45,000
But if I were to go how much I weigh now compared to when I was 23 years old.

2512
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:48,000
Some things have changed pretty majorly in that department Rama.

2513
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:55,000
So that's part of the reason it's contributed itself to the fact that I don't move as fast as I used to.

2514
02:24:55,000 --> 02:25:03,000
However maybe if I played more of these dancing games I would not have this problem and I admit that.

2515
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:06,000
Which is true but let me tell you.

2516
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:11,000
I've shown you the dance skits I have done with my friends at conventions.

2517
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:15,000
You can see I can move pretty quickly and I can keep in tone.

2518
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:21,000
I want you to know how much I hurt when we were off the stage.

2519
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:23,000
How much I hurt during practice.

2520
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:28,000
How many times I have tripped over my feet and slammed my face into the goddamn floor.

2521
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:33,000
I guess we share something in that regard because the day after a Rocky Horror performance.

2522
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:39,000
Which even though I'm retired I got dragged back on stage because they really really badly needed somebody.

2523
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:42,000
So I got dragged back on stage to do Brad at the last show.

2524
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:47,000
And so I got to do like fucking coordinated dance routines, kick lines and all this stuff right.

2525
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:52,000
And the next day I was just like kill me, kill me now, kill me.

2526
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:54,000
I was sore.

2527
02:25:54,000 --> 02:26:01,000
This is why when I go to cons I liquor up before I go down to the informal dance and dance all that booze off.

2528
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:03,000
That way I don't wake up trying to like.

2529
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:05,000
I can't feel my legs, can't feel my legs.

2530
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:07,000
I got to remember my part though.

2531
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:11,000
That's the problem if I drink I do that whole thing where I'm like oh yeah I know my part.

2532
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:16,000
I know and then I just I'm up there and I look like an asshole.

2533
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:18,000
But we still love you.

2534
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:20,000
Thank you, thank you very much I appreciate it.

2535
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:23,000
Alright anything else you want to point out about what I'm doing wrong in my life Rama?

2536
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:27,000
Anything wrong with your life is just that.

2537
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:30,000
I just want you to know I'm here for you.

2538
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:32,000
I got your back.

2539
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:34,000
Alright tell you what.

2540
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:37,000
Oh no you're not going to be there when I'm in New York.

2541
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:40,000
Look Rob I already said this.

2542
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:46,000
I realize that week I will be spending that week with my favorite gay and lesbian couple.

2543
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:51,000
And I'd be damned if I'm going to spend equal time with them all.

2544
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:53,000
It'll work one way or another.

2545
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:54,000
Alright.

2546
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:56,000
You bet your sweet ass it'll work.

2547
02:26:56,000 --> 02:27:02,000
We'll get up on a DDR machine together and I'll feel much better about it.

2548
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:05,000
And Mako-chan will be there to record us making fools of ourselves.

2549
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:08,000
I didn't say this shit could be on YouTube.

2550
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:10,000
Who said anything about it being on YouTube?

2551
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:13,000
It'll be on the secret Bogstash network.

2552
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:15,000
Alright secret club's fine.

2553
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:18,000
Alright Rama I'm going to let you go but take care.

2554
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:19,000
You too stay fabulous.

2555
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:20,000
Alright bye.

2556
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:21,000
Alright.

2557
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:23,000
Alright.

2558
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:28,000
Orange Lounge Radio all one word on Skype or 1877 game OLR.

2559
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:31,000
But first I did promise Dark Soccer we could have a moment to vent.

2560
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:39,000
Cause sometimes you know here on this show we need to dive into a long standing tradition here and let off some steam in a segment we call the FUs of the week.

2561
02:27:39,000 --> 02:28:01,000
FU to the GOP a major FU.

2562
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:14,000
FU to basically anyone who had anything to do with that piece of shit legislation that their Dr. Evil laughing asshole selves have passed the house.

2563
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:15,000
Fuck you.

2564
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:16,000
Fuck all of you.

2565
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:21,000
But bless the lady who put in the bill to remove their exemptions.

2566
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:24,000
Now they're also subject to the same piece of shit.

2567
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:25,000
That's it.

2568
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:32,000
My FU of the week goes to the 100 degree day we had this week.

2569
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:33,000
It is fucking May.

2570
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:34,000
It is not summer time yet.

2571
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:35,000
It is not August.

2572
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:36,000
Who was it here?

2573
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:38,000
Well lucky fucking you.

2574
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:39,000
Where did you go?

2575
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:40,000
Oh you were in the bay area that day.

2576
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:41,000
That's right.

2577
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:43,000
It was still pretty hot.

2578
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:44,000
Drinking cocktails.

2579
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,000
For the bay area it was hot that day.

2580
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:47,000
Like 89.

2581
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:49,000
But it is fucking early May.

2582
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:50,000
Triple degree weather.

2583
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:51,000
No ma'am.

2584
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:52,000
No ma'am.

2585
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:55,000
Loki your FU of the week.

2586
02:28:55,000 --> 02:29:01,000
I guess just FU to being tired.

2587
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:03,000
Because I'm tired.

2588
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:04,000
I don't want to be tired.

2589
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:06,000
I want to be productive and work on my game.

2590
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:08,000
My brain is like YouTube videos.

2591
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:13,000
Let's watch more fucking videos about 3D printing.

2592
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:15,000
The same videos you've already watched several times.

2593
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:18,000
Let's watch a funny video about what's wrong with said movie.

2594
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:21,000
I waste so much time.

2595
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:23,000
My brain is tired.

2596
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:25,000
Your brain is very tired.

2597
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:29,000
Well someday the kids will be 18 and out of the house and then maybe you'll finish your game.

2598
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:33,000
There it is.

2599
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:34,000
Your FUs of the week.

2600
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:35,000
It's been a while.

2601
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:37,000
It felt good to let loose a little bit of steam here.

2602
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:40,000
And some folks in chat.

2603
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:41,000
Let's see.

2604
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:45,000
Act F saying weather definitely deserves a permanent spot in the FUs.

2605
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:48,000
Act F says all week over 100 degree weather.

2606
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:50,000
This week it's fucking cold.

2607
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,000
I didn't even look at.

2608
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:53,000
I heard it was going to rain today.

2609
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:57,000
It was supposed to be thundering and rainy this weekend.

2610
02:29:57,000 --> 02:30:01,000
And it's supposed to be up in the upper 80s later this week.

2611
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:06,000
As much as the rain bothers me when it's non-stop.

2612
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:08,000
Like I've mentioned before I get affected by seasons.

2613
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:12,000
And as much as the non-stop rain bothers me.

2614
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:14,000
A day or two here and there I don't mind.

2615
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:18,000
So I was kind of like thinking oh it might be nice to have a little bit of rain.

2616
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:20,000
And then I don't have to water all the plants and the lawn.

2617
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:24,000
Now right now the 10 day forecast says maybe rain next Monday.

2618
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:28,000
But for now the next week 90 degrees on Tuesday.

2619
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:30,000
But otherwise the rest of the week mid 70s.

2620
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:31,000
That's not too bad.

2621
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:35,000
That's the May weather I expect living in Northern California in the valley.

2622
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:36,000
Alright.

2623
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:39,000
Well that is going to do it tonight.

2624
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:41,000
I'm sorry if you did not get through on the Skype line.

2625
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:43,000
But you can always give us an email.

2626
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:46,000
Participate at Orangelaunchradio.com.

2627
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:48,000
You can also tweet us at OLR.

2628
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:51,000
But I believe that is going to do it for another episode of our show tonight.

2629
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:54,000
I want to thank you guys for tuning in and supporting the show.

2630
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:57,000
If you like what you heard here at Orange Lawns Radio.

2631
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:59,000
Please tell a friend or five about the show.

2632
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:00,000
Help us spread the word.

2633
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:02,000
Because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

2634
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:05,000
But if your voices aren't here we can't air them.

2635
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:07,000
We do like seeing some new names once in a while.

2636
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:09,000
Although we love our old names too.

2637
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:10,000
Don't get us wrong.

2638
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:13,000
A nice five star review on a site like iTunes goes a long way.

2639
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:16,000
Seriously if you've never taken the 30 seconds to do a five star review on iTunes.

2640
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:17,000
Please, please help us out.

2641
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:19,000
Because those go a long way in getting noticed.

2642
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:23,000
Because there's probably easily a thousand video game podcasts on iTunes at this point.

2643
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:26,000
So it's sometimes hard to stay above the line.

2644
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:29,000
Even if you are 15 years old that doesn't really buy you jack shit.

2645
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:30,000
So anyway.

2646
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:32,000
That's it for that.

2647
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:34,000
So let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

2648
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:36,000
Loki your final thoughts tonight.

2649
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:41,000
I'm going to work more on this new game until I start another new game.

2650
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:42,000
And another new game.

2651
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:43,000
And another new game.

2652
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:44,000
No but this one actually sounds.

2653
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:45,000
I have an idea now.

2654
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:47,000
Because that was kind of where I was at before.

2655
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:48,000
Like I wanted to do.

2656
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:51,000
So actually I'm still going to do something with you on this.

2657
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:53,000
And I thought that that's why I started this one.

2658
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:55,000
But I still don't know what you're going to do yet.

2659
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:59,000
We talked about programming so I could learn Unity.

2660
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:03,000
That came up on an episode when the guys from Little Tanks were here.

2661
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:04,000
Yes.

2662
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:06,000
I do have to say though.

2663
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:08,000
What I'm coming up with so far is tank related.

2664
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:09,000
But not like their game.

2665
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:11,000
I was like don't rip off the guest game.

2666
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:12,000
No I'm not ripping off their game.

2667
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:13,000
No no no.

2668
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:14,000
Completely different type of.

2669
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:16,000
I mean it's an arcade type game.

2670
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:19,000
But different looking type game.

2671
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:21,000
Because they could sue you like Bethesda did.

2672
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:22,000
I'm kidding.

2673
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:23,000
Yeah yeah.

2674
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:25,000
I'm surprised you know.

2675
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:27,000
There's a tank you know.

2676
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:30,000
The word tank is used somewhere then they can.

2677
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:31,000
I don't know.

2678
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:33,000
Fuck Bethesda.

2679
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:34,000
Seriously.

2680
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:35,000
Dark Sakura.

2681
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:36,000
Your final thought tonight.

2682
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:41,000
Some of my photos from last night turned out really nice.

2683
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:43,000
From seeing Bianca Del Rio.

2684
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:46,000
I was just looking at my pictures.

2685
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:48,000
I like that dress.

2686
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:49,000
That black sequined thing.

2687
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:51,000
I want one.

2688
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:54,000
And my final thought for the night is I had a good time last night.

2689
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:58,000
It was very like doing dinner at a fancy-ish restaurant.

2690
02:32:58,000 --> 02:32:59,000
But not too fancy.

2691
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:02,000
And then a show and then dessert with my friends.

2692
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:05,000
That was a very pleasant evening.

2693
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:08,000
It was a very nice night and I need to do that more often.

2694
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:11,000
But I need to make sure I have time for video games as well.

2695
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:12,000
That's very important as well.

2696
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:14,000
So we hope you guys have time for video games this week.

2697
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:18,000
We will see you in seven days and we'll do this all over again.

2698
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:20,000
But until then, thanks for listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2699
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:21,000
Have a great week everybody.

2700
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:23,000
