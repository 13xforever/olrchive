Then stay tuned instead to hear about Overwatch, more Project Rap Rabbit, and autonomous driving fears played out in gaming. And yes, it all starts right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice. Orange Lounge Radio Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight on May the 21st of 2017, episode number 687 of our show. My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E. And joining me, as always, not just yet, DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers. She's literally on her way, she had another event just before the show tonight, so she'll be joining us in a few moments here as she comes in live. But I do have some other folks here in the studio to say hello to, of course, Techmaster Loki! Hello. Hi Loki, how are you? I'm fine. Hey, you got a brand new toy. Yes I did. It's shiny, it's shiny and it needed the wifi password. Yes it did. What is this? You bought a new laptop, right? I bought a new laptop, yes. And that keyboard kind of glows like my keyboard. It's RGB, and it matches my Tron background that I have. Oh, very cool. So what all went into it? So you got a new laptop because your other one was kind of... My other one is kind of, it's full of malware, and I just didn't feel like redoing everything on it. Also, it's overheating. I've had bad luck with old Asus laptops. The old ones that they had, not so much the Republic of Gaming stuff that they have now, but the old ones were like not thermally designed well. And so they would overheat. In fact, this was my first laptop, my first Asus laptop. Pretty much melted when Titanfall hit it. And then I had to buy this last one, which was a replacement. It was kind of one I had to pick up. It was whatever was available at Fry's at the time, and it was an AMD, an ATI... Well, I guess it's an AMD chip now too. The GPU, CPU, and an APU processor. I just wasn't all that satisfied with it. It was slightly better spec-wise than my old laptop. But it was getting old. I mean, it was like a few years old when I bought it, and now it's three more years old and just needed something new. So I got a brand new laptop. It's got like a Core i7 in it, 16GB of RAM, a GTX 1060 with 6GB of RAM. Pretty much can run anything. Oh, and it has a 5TB hard drive in it because I'll never fucking fill that up. You have more space on that than I do on my desktop that's not even that old. Exactly. That's a lot of porn. That's a lot of porn. Yeah, it could be a lot of porn. But who downloads porn nowadays? Oh, it's all streaming. Of course. It's all available on the internet. There's really no point. No, I mean, yeah. I could literally... I was backing up my laptop, my old one, and just kind of copying over what I needed. Because most of it was just Unity Project stuff, and I didn't have to really move any games over because I needed to download that crap again. But it felt like it was a lot of space, and I look at my hard drive's usage, and it's like, nothing. It's like, come on. Is this it? Seriously? Let me introduce our live chatroom, of course, because we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific and 9 o'clock Eastern at The Voice of Geeks Network. vognetwork.com, right after The Bobby Black Wolf Show. And if you are listening live, you can join us in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com. And Bobby Black Wolf, who I just referred to, says in chat, or I should say asks, what's the Wi-Fi password? It's blackwolfsucks123! Because, you know, all passwords have to have numbers and punctuation in them. Bobby's also asking, does Loki's old laptop make him want to cry? Like, did you get hit with want to cry? Is that why? No, I didn't want to cry. I'm the one at risk for that because I'm still on Windows XP, where all the IT people out there are going, No, I've got, um, you know, I've got, it was, it should be still fine if I reset it. It just runs really hot for no reason. And I have my, you know, I bought a new laptop cooling pad for this laptop, but I think it's too small. But for the other one, it actually works really well. So, I may just end up wiping it, putting Minecraft on, give it to my son or something, you know, to use. Oh, that's a, that's a cute idea. Like, put little kitty games. I mean, it can still run, I mean, that's what I was playing Minecraft on. Make him learn the way we did. Put Number Munchers, Odell Lake, put the classics. He's already playing other stuff. I mean, he's got the Wii U and everything. He's not going to go for that. But, um, yeah, I mean, it was just, I don't know, like, it has, like, some Chromium malware thing on it right now that's really pissing me off. And I tried removing it. I think that's what kind of borked a bunch of stuff. So, I just said, ah, fuck it. I'm not going to worry about fixing this laptop right now. It's kind of falling apart. Just going to get a new one in. I got a great deal. This one is actually used. I mean, it's practically brand new, except for, like, a couple tiny scratches on the top of the case, which is, like, who gives a shit? Um, and it's fantastic. It's a, uh, Electrix, or, um, I think they call them, like, they go by a bunch of different names. Clevo is another one. It's basically, it's Clevo shells. They have these laptop shells that a bunch of different companies fill with components. And they're really nice. I mean, just no, um, bloatware installed on it. Just a clean copy of Windows. And it just runs fantastic. I played, you know, Grand Theft Auto fully maxed out at, like, over 60 frames per second yesterday. I was like, I can't even run this game on my old laptop. It was fucking awesome. All right. Well, I'm going to ask you about some of the games you've been playing on your new laptop. But I figure that's probably best to hold on to How Was Your Gaming Week, which we'll get to in a little while. I'm going to have you start us with our kickoff topic in a little bit, though, with that story that we have. But first, of course, I want to introduce our other folks in the studio here while we still wait for Dark Soccer to arrive. We have folks that you've heard on the show plenty of times before say hello to JD, joining us again tonight. Hi. Hi. How are you? Doing pretty well. Yeah, good, good. What's new with you since the last time we saw you? I moved to Japantown. That's right. So you're within walking distance of all that fun stuff that's, you know, everybody likes to crash San Francisco in the area during the Sakura Cherry Blossom Festival, right? Yeah, I actually moved during the second weekend of that. Oh, of that. What good timing. I'm sure that was a lot of fun. Just pull up the U-Haul right next to all that other... Made it work. Yeah, you made it work. Good, good. You survived? I think so. And now you're within walking distance of that cute little arcade there that has, like, pop-in music and some of our old music game favorites, right? Yeah. Two pop-ins, a DDRX3, a Rhythm Tengoku arcade, which is not something I'd seen anywhere else, and a Taiko... I think it's Taiko 9. Nice. Well, that's fun. So, congrats on the move. And good thing you got out of the city this weekend because Beta Breakers is going on right now, or was earlier today, right? Yeah, it was today. It's a mess. A lot of people are probably still hungover. If you don't know what this is, it's like only in San Francisco is Beta Breakers. It's... Alan is also joining us. Hubby, Alan is here. Hello. Hi, how are you? I'm good. You were about to explain for us what Beta Breakers is. I was gonna say it's sort of a race question mark. A silly walk fitness question mark. Basically, they walk from the west side to the east side... no, east side to the west side of San Francisco in costumes, and there's lots of day drinking, and lots of people are naked, and it's basically... it just shuts down the city and makes traffic a shit show. Sounds very San Francisco. Anyway, let me talk to JD a little more, and I'm gonna come back to you, Alan, in a little bit for our little kickoff topic tonight. But JD, so I guess this kind of gets into our gaming week a little bit, but I know you've been playing console stuff as has I. We have other things we can talk about, but you and I took a little arcade adventure yesterday. Yeah. We went out to the arcade that I talked about a couple weeks ago on the show, where... because I wanted you to be able to play Pump It Up, which I knew they had. I wanted you to see this little bootleg machine that took over our show for two weeks, right? I wanted you to see like all the cool stuff they had. And then, so we got there and found that there's more, like the machines have been mating. There was now a Sound Voltex machine and a U-Beat. Two of them. Two U-Beats. Which is kind of the one... Is this all like, what's his name? The guy that... It is. I thought so, because he keeps moving his machines. All the stuff that used to... it's like the presence that used to be at Scandi is now over here. It took us a little while to figure that out, but that's apparently what's happening. Well, his name is on the Sound Voltex machine. Yes. When you log in with EMUs, like it says it's his. Yeah, yeah. Which I finally got to play Sound Voltex for the first time. Because every time I go to round one, like even when we go early, we'll go to round one like open. Because that's when it's the least crowded, right? We always go to these things early. That's what old people do. They get up early and they go to mall walks, right? They walk around the mall. So we did the mall walking at round one. And there's actually the Sound Voltex machines will also have people on them that early. So I usually never am able to get in and play that game, but I was finally able to play it. It was fun. I liked it. I still kind of like... I kind of like Neon FM a little more, I think. Which might be... I don't know. That might be Sacrilegion, some circles. I don't know. Maybe it's just because this... They're different games. They're very different games. They're also very different song lists. And I don't... it's hard to explain. Like I just don't... like the J-pop stuff doesn't resonate with me the way that it used to. I mean, a good portion of the song list these days is Vocaloid and Toho, so... That's very true as well, so. But what was I gonna say? So I... but when I played Neon FM, like my hands were hurting. Like just from slamming all the... you know, because it's basically... it's basically pop music, but like, you know, five... With flat pads instead of popping out buttons. But I had a good time. So we had a good time on our arcade adventure. Was there a favorite thing that you played? Oh, man. You know... I think it's probably... I'm gonna be lame. It's... it's... it was a tie between the StepMania cabinet and the DDR 2014. Because you're old school. You like dancing. Even though those pads were moving as you were dancing. That's so funny. Oh, man. Yeah. They... so I played doubles a lot. And these pads were not anchored down nearly enough. So I was playing and they moved probably like a foot and a half or something. And I had to move them back after each song. Alright. I thought they had feet on those things. They probably do, but they weren't using them. They weren't planted down very well. Alright. Well, I'm going to introduce here because she walked into the studio as we were having that little discussion. Hi, Dark Soccer or Jamie Summers. Hi, I'm on Sister Time. Oh, because you're running late. I got it. I was like, wait a minute, wait a minute. I've heard... I've heard gay time. I've heard a lot of different, you know, descriptions for why somebody runs late, but Sister Time. That's the same family. Yeah, it's all in the same family. It really is. I thought you'd still have full white face like I saw on Facebook earlier. I actually came home relatively in enough time, but I was so exhausted that I passed out. Like I sat on my bed. I washed my face off. Everything was fine. I sat on my bed. Midna comes in and then dead. The heat here right now is no joke though. Like it's already summer weather. We had some nice shade. We were all shady. Of course. But I got to meet some of the San Francisco sisters and made some new friends. Good. And it was just nice seeing, you know, seeing the smiles and recognition and people seeing their mood light up by having the sisters and pride. In that freaking heat. I mean, the fact that you guys did all that. That wasn't terrible. Really? That's good. Well, out in the sun. Yeah, it was terra bad. But in the shade, it was really nice. We sat out. We had wine. Okay. That's why you passed out drinking in this heat. Girl. No, I had like a little sippy cup of wine with a straw in it because I was wearing white face. So I was drinking my Prosecco through a straw, which is classy as fuck. Like a lady. Like a lady. Yeah. But there was like a nice like an Italian ice place. It was really yummy. Oh, yeah. Especially in the weather. And I found out that lemon and cherry mix very well. Yes, they do. And there were vendors there and there was no parade because it's Davis. Right. But there were lots of vendors there and people singing and cheerleaders. Mm hmm. You know, they would like you pay them a dollar for their cheer thing and they would do a jump or a cartwheel. One of the gals from Drag Race was supposed to be there, right? Trinity? Trinity was supposed to be there, but I didn't see her. Oh, that's too bad. But I also left when the things were still going on because I as a postulant, I have to stay with my big sister or at least one of the other sisters. And since they were all leaving to go to the coronation tonight or the investment for the local court, I got the OK to stay with the San Francisco sisters. So we just hung out dishing and it was great. It's a lip sync. What part of that don't you understand? Just kidding. OK. OK. It just clicked for her. It just clicked for her when I was raising. No, no, no, no, no, no, don't because some people haven't watched it. All right. All right. I'm just going to say this. I am disappointed doubly. Video games. This is a video game show. The other show is about this. But that bitch. All right. Anyway. OK. I had a Tyra moment. I had a Tyra moment. We all did. We all did. All right. Look. Speaking of that bitch, Alan. Just kidding. Hearts. How have you been? We haven't heard from you in a while. Fine. I know your day's office switched around a little bit. I'm on a new schedule. Yeah, you're able to you're able to join us now on Sunday night. So I like that a lot. So I want to talk VR with you a little bit. So you got a new toy this week, right? Yes. Tell us a little bit about it. I got a Galaxy S8 on launch day. And they had it because my my previous phone was literally dying and I was practically unusable. So the timing was great. And they had a promotion where if you got a Galaxy S8, which is the first phone that they've released since the Note 7 like was blowing up, like in people's hands and spraying, spraying battery acid everywhere. So this was kind of a big deal release. Literally banned in all airports. Yeah. And you got if you got the S8 in a certain window, you got a Gear VR, which is Samsung's at home Oculus equivalent VR device that uses your phone. You actually pop your phone into the front of it. And it arrived Thursday and I've been messing around with it. So tell us a little bit about what you like what you've been using the device for. I did get a code that had a bunch of like cheap games on it for free. I've been checking them out and I bought a couple for like four or five bucks each. You've been spending money on that? No, I'm just kidding. My favorite one so far is the scary one. Not because it's scary, but I just feel like the way that the hand controller is used as your flashlight and the way the VR looks when you're walking through the house. What's the name of it? Do you know? Affected the Manner. Okay. There are three other or two other episodes, but they're for the Oculus proper because the Oculus Rift you hook up to a PC, I believe, and the PC runs the game. Yeah, right. And it's pipe to the thing. This all has to be run on your phone. So even though the S8 is, I think, the strongest processing power of all the phones on the market, at least I would hope it is, it's still not going to be at the level of what an Oculus can do simply because you hook an Oculus up to a computer. And Tiger Claw on our chat is asking, is it the regular S8 or the S8 Plus? S8 Plus. Yeah, I was going to say you have the larger phone like I do with the iPhone 6 Plus. They do have, I don't know if you've tried it yet, they have something that you can actually run on your PC and stream it to your phone like actual Oculus proper games using that. Oh. Something to try. Yeah, for sure. Yeah, I wonder how that would. Since you probably have a pretty powerful PC then, you know, that might. Yeah. Or you could use Bluetooth or Wi-Fi or whatever. Yeah, you could even use my PC to do it too because we just upgraded mine. I was trying to get you to play one or two games before the show so you could talk about it a little. Yeah, I've had a lot of personal stuff going on today so I wasn't able to get around to doing that. But I'm curious to check it out. But let's. Okay, look. This is Orange Tons Radio. Y'all heard the warning in the beginning. This is an adult audiences show. Yeah. So let's not hold back because everybody fucking knows what we did with that thing first. Yes. Of course, it's VR porn. I mean, that's. Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding. That's what we did at the Oculus Dev Kids. Let's look at porn on this. Ding, ding, ding. Even Bobby Black Wolf and his family friendly show. Fantastic. He knows. It's like so weird. I mean. It's not sexy. That man knows. That man knows. The very first time I saw this VR stuff, you know, he was like, okay, here's the roller coaster sim. And isn't that kind of neat? And here's the, okay, here's the walk around the house and look at all this stuff, sim. And then, you know, I'm doing all these things. He's like, all right, I know you want to see the porn. Here's the porn. So I got to see. You just need to combine the two because everyone does the roller coasters and porn. We need a porno coaster. And then you download, you know, glory, hallelujah. Is that what, is that what y'all sang in church today, sisters? All right. Here's the thing. Here's the thing. Well, on that note, believe it or not, here's the thing. Bobby Black Wolf being a heterosexual male. I know that the porn I was going to see on that was going to be, you know, a lady who is going to walk over and fillet me in the first person. And that was, that was what the porno was that I watched. However, I don't know if any, I'm sure any podcast has talked about VR and VR porn probably has talked about that. But has any podcast talked about gay pornography in the VR? Because we're about to go there, ladies and gentlemen. I know it exists. Yes, it exists. And I'm not going to get super detailed, but I didn't say Alan wouldn't get it super detailed. Alan, tell us about the gay porn on the VR. The fact that it's first person so that it's happening in quotey fingers to you is very strange and jarring because everything is up close in your face. Like, you see everything. You see, you see glory, glory, hallelujah. You see Christmas and New Year's. And it's like, there are certain models that probably don't want to be in front of that camera because they're like, you know what, my butthole isn't that photogenic. You could tell that was a freshly waxed vehicle. Yes. Like that was just, it was a bit much. And they say that that bleaching it is an urban legend, but I'm convinced that it's real because I think this boy had it done. Anyway. And basically, I hear the clicks across America in the world of people shutting off the show. Those are like clicks. I hope, I hope. But anyway, dialing it back just a little bit. Like, what, what? These things are all like first person and all that. But here's, here's the $50,000 question. Is it hot? No. So the other thing that threw me off about it was that it was just a static video. Like, I mean, it was, it wasn't interactive at all. And I mean, when we were talking about VR and this heavily immersive experience, I was kind of expecting to have more agency. You know, like, you can see, like, even in the lobby of the Oculus, you walk around, you look at things, you do stuff, it responds to you. This was just, it felt like a 3D movie or something. And it wasn't. There are some that have 360 view where if you want to turn your back on the boy wanking in the bed and just look out the window, you can. Yeah. You're like, ooh, I'm sorry. What have I done with my life? I'm interrupting you. You're like, I'll give you some privacy and you turn around. I feel like it needed to go farther to do something for me. Yeah. And when I, I started laughing and when I put, I'm like, you have to watch this one. Cause I found some free trailers that were like 40 seconds long. You were like screaming. I was, I was screaming, laughing, like doing the full on, like, like I just, I, it was, it was funny. Porn's funny. It's not hot. It's not hot at all. At all. And I thought maybe like, it's going to be a scene just in 3d where I'm like this weird ghost person watching them, but no, it's through the perspective of it happening to you, which makes it far more shocking. It's like the, it's like the first time I can look down and not see my stomach just hanging there. You're like, oh, I have abs. I want, I want it for this. That was the hottest fucking part of it. Get, get the, get the other guy out of the way. I want to look down and see abs. JV wants to jump in here. See, now I have to invent glory. Hallelujah. Because it would come with like, it would come with a peripheral. Yeah, I bet it would bitch. It would come with an interactive peripheral that's based off of stimulation from the game. Copyright Jamie forever. That's, that's where they've already beat you to it because they already have devices that work with those, those, we saw that three years ago. The E3, feel three or whatever that thing was. I think that was before VR. I didn't think that had like attachments. You just did it. That thing had like a little wanker. Like what is, what do they call that thing? The wank mode. No. The flashlight. Thank you. It's a flesh, I knew you'd know it. It was, it was a fleshlight type attachment that you used when you were doing that, but it was more like a second life type of game, I think. Yeah, it was. And I remember boy play girl, whatever, but see, but see that, that I want to make that an OLR dream game now. All right. And I, but to, to defend Bobby's honor a little bit, he is in chat saying, Rob, I would have totally had it available for you if it was around and I was showing you the DK one. They just had, it's true that didn't come around. They hadn't invented gay porn yet. That came later. There's just one website that I found. Yeah. Cause I was like, there's gotta be something. Exactly right. And I just found this one site. Yeah. So the games that I have. Oh yeah. Video games. Right. Well, one issue that I have, especially with affected the manner, the scary game is that they're all, they're like basically four different paths. You can go down, but they all end ultimately the same way. It's not really a game. And I noticed that a lot of these VR experiences, they're not even like gone home or something where it's like a first person narrative. You're sort of like walking through and like, Oh, this is trippy. Oh, I really like how it uses the flashlight effect and then jump scare. And then it's over. And it's like, there's no puzzles. And it's, that's not the only game that was like that. And so it's kind of weird to find out, is this really a game or is this just like a neat thing to last me like 20 minutes of just. I think it's still because all VR, all this VR stuff is still in that gimmick phase. It's just like, you know, with the DS and we, and so they don't really know how to utilize the hardware well. So it's all these experimental, like, Oh, that's a neat idea. Let's do that a million times, you know, not really utilizing it in an innovative way. Like I think right now, the best thing we have like for VR, probably Resident Evil 7 is probably going to be one of the strongest examples of like a AAA game done exclusively in VR. Well, PlayStation VR is doing a lot right in that department. But in, but in a way, I mean, just to be fair, you know, when we, when we talked a lot about this, when Facebook bought Oculus and it was like, Oh my God, why would Facebook do this? And that all this stuff. And we were kind of like, well, wait a minute, maybe there's more to VR than just gaming. So to be fair, you know, a lot of these experiences and videos, you know, I know we're having fun talking about porn, but we've, we've seen other stuff in VR too. I mean, I remember seeing a Cirque du Soleil thing. I saw like the, the last Paul McCartney concert at Candlestick Park, you know, before they closed Candlestick Park down, they, there was a VR thing for that. So like, you know, it's definitely shown that there can be experiences. And I would think, especially when it comes to mobile devices and stuff, games are not going to be the strong point of mobile devices. It's going to be these more like immersive, like, Oh, it's almost like I was there type of experience. You know, like I'm surprised maybe that did exist, but Coachella didn't have like a VR thing where you could be a Coachella virtually. It probably did exist. I just didn't see it. There's this thing on here like that where it's Major Lazer and Diplo. Yeah. And watch him on stage. But now you go to PlayStation and PlayStation's bread and butter is games. So I would hope that the strongest stuff over there is going to be games. And so far that does seem to be true between Resident Evil 7. It's hit and miss. A lot of people love the rush of blood. I love rush of blood. I think that's for if you're going to get PlayStation VR, pick that up first. Twenty bucks. Great value for what you get. It's such a great game. Well, and then Thumper was one because I'm thinking of that. I was thinking that because that came out on Switch and JD. You were thinking like, do I want to get because I like music games, but rhythm violence. What the hell is that? So I was like, all right, let's put this on because I have it on PlayStation four. Let's play it. And I was like, you have to imagine this in VR because it's like twice as good when it's in VR. The thing about Thumper was that it just wasn't musical enough for me to really get going with it. Like it was definitely rhythmic. It's not J-pop. Well, it wasn't even that. There was no melody. Yeah, like it was just all percussive. And I'm like, you know, I can kind of keep the beat and stuff, but it just wasn't fun the same way. Interesting because Bobby points out a lot of those videos are also available on PlayStation VR. The Paul McCartney one is in the Jaunt VR app. Well, I guess and I guess that doesn't make sense because technically, I mean, yes, I say the PlayStation is bread and butter is games, but the reality is it's also a Netflix device. They sell movies on it. They do these this live events viewer thing that I'm sure later in the show, we'll talk about E3 and all that. You know, that is all part of PlayStation stuff as well. But even when it comes down to Sony, they're a media company. That's true. That's true. Not just televisions. Then the Oculus is actually what powers the Gear VR. Like it's their storefront and it's their, I guess, API or UI that you navigate on the phone. So there are 3D movies like X-Men Days of Future Past that I could buy on this to see a 3D movie. But the idea of even just laying in bed with this thing on my head watching a full movie for two hours seems very strange. I don't want to I'd rather watch it on an at home 3D TV, which we have. Yeah, but to be fair, it sucks. Like the 3D TV, it sucks. Those glasses don't even work anymore. It sucks. The game that I was playing that was actually a really good puzzle game is called Rangi. And I don't want to say it's portalesque, but basically you're in a room and you see the door that you're supposed to exit through and the color tile above the door is orange. And you look and you see like a blue beam and a red beam and a yellow beam. Well, if you're trying to get the color orange, the blue beam is like a red hair. Like you don't care about the blue beam because you want to slide these tiles over so that the red and the yellow merge. And then you direct the orange beam at the door and then the door unlocks and you go to the next room. That I thought was really cool because you look up and you're like, oh, there's a cliff up there. So then you click and you teleport up there and you find that there's another tile for you to flip to reflect the laser or whatever. I thought that was a neat game. So I want to play more of that. And then I have Drop Dead, which is a zombie game, but it's more like Time Crisis or where you lower your thing to reload and it's very fast and the zombies are just running at you. So it's not really scary at all. And Dragonfront, which is kind of like chess meets Magic the Gathering, but it's in, of course, 3D VR. So you take your card and you put it down and it pops up and it turns into a little knight. Oh, it's like I have judgment. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. OK. Well, that. Yeah. But those had a real element to it. This is all in a virtual space. Fair enough. Yeah. But it's neat. Now, let me ask this question. I was going to say I wanted to try to get the Power Rangers thing they have for it to show Shane because the first we're like, hey, Shane, I have a gear VR. There's porn on it. And he was immediately like, I'm not listening to anything you're ever going to say after this. Right. Shutting down. We offended his delegate sensibilities. Right. But I imagine if I had the Power Rangers movie VR experience on it, he would have tried it. Gimme, gimme, gimme. It's exclusive to some weird device that's also competing in the Oculus gear VR space. So I don't remember. Bobby might know. Was it a dream? I think possibly. So, yeah, I was looking for that, but I'm like, no, it's an exclusive because I want to see Power Rangers in VR. Well, thank you for playing some games in VR and, you know, telling us a little bit about it, especially since I failed to do so this week. But let me ask this. So since you have been doing a little bit of VR gaming this week, you're now the show's VR expert. Oh, I guess, I guess, Loki. Also, you said conditionally that the only reason why you were trying it out the first night that I got it is because it literally uses my phone and the device so that I couldn't record you using it. That was only when we were watching Christmas and New Year's. So, okay. So what was I gonna say? Oh, I know. So let me ask this about your kind of VR experience. So games that you play a lot of online, Mass Effect Andromeda, I know is one you're still playing a lot. Despite everything we talked about, about that show in the past, or about that game in the past couple of weeks, you are still very loyal to Andromeda. Yes. You play multiplayer and all that stuff, right? Would you play something like that in a VR space? Does that appeal to you, being able to, you know, obviously, I know your phone doesn't have that power, but let's just put all that aside. Let's assume that the capability was there that you could play something like Andromeda in a VR space, would you? I would feel like, because when I'm in a space to play an RPG like that, I'll put in a couple hours worth and I just can't, even if I've trained myself up to being used to having the VR thing on my face for that long. I just, it's so, I mean, it is isolating. You've got this thing on your head. So I think it's going to be mostly a casual experience until they become more like glasses that you can slide on and off. I don't know how to describe it. I'm trying to think of a game that I play now. Like, I was looking for a music game. Like, of course, Rez would be incredible on this, but again, that's very, like, you do a stage, then the stage is over, then you can stop. Right. So it's very, it's broken down into little bite-sized pieces. And that's actually kind of my thing with it too, is that actually, well, I don't know, I think I might just need to calibrate it better for my head because I was getting a lot of the double vision stuff. Yeah, you shouldn't be getting that at all. My eyes were shifting in and out of focus, like really bad. And I think, and that like can really give me a headache after a few minutes, at least with this particular device. But, you know, I actually, I would say, you know, I realize it isn't VR, it's completely different. But one of the better experiences I had was with HoloLens, because those were like glasses you put on your head and they didn't like pull on my eyes or any of that stuff. Like, that's why I was able, I did that whole mystery game thing that Bobby had me go through. And that was a lot of fun. And I was able to, that was a good, maybe 30 minutes that, you know, and I didn't feel anything after that. Whereas five minutes of all the stuff we were doing, I was like, okay, I need, I need to take a break. Yeah. So, let's see. I'm going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com. Bobby answers your question here. The Power Rangers stuff is only on Qualcomm's, Qualcomm's, oops, Snapdragon VR platform. Okay. Which literally nobody has. SSG100Matt says, I've seen the VR porn on the Gear VR. It's really meh and more ridiculous than anything. I wasn't expecting anything ridiculous. The other thing I got too, which you might want to try, it's, there's this Google Card, or a thing that allow you play Google Cardboard apps as well using that. That's another good one to get because there's a lot more that's available through the Google Play Store. And Google's own home VR thing is coming out soon, I think. The Dream or no? No, Dream's already out with the Pixel. Okay. That was the first phone that, but now, I mean, we'll get into it a little bit later, but like the Samsung Galaxy S8 is going to support Dream as well. I mean, I don't know. It's just, it's basically, they're trying to make like a platform, okay, these phones are powerful enough to run this. Kind of like how these graphics cards are VAR ready type thing. These phones are VR ready or VR AR ready or something like that. What was the puzzle game that I played a bit of? Do you remember? Lands End. That one was really cool. Which you liked. Yeah. It reminded me a lot of Monument Valley a bit with the kind of episodic do a little bit of a puzzle here and then move on to the next area. But it was really pretty. Like it takes place on a beach. And I mean, I'm a sucker for that kind of environment. But it was mostly like just connecting line puzzles, but I thought it was fun, at least the first area. Yeah. And I need to check that out because I think you've played that more than me. And then I downloaded this one thing called Groove VR, Groover, thinking it was a music game. But basically it's a very, it's like you're floating and there's like the sort of sea punk, like dolphins going through the sky. And it's like, I don't smoke enough weed or take shrooms to be, for this to be enjoyable. But it plays techno music and you're kind of just floating through and there's like a big Buddha statue with like green smoke coming out of its eyes. I'm like, all right, this is like, it's like, yeah, yeah, we get it. You vape. Yeah. It's basically, think of it as a 3D black light poster. That's exactly what it is. It's a 3D black light poster. So, yeah, that's all. It's a thing that I have. All right. No, I do want to try more of it when real life settles down a little bit. But yeah, I mean, that's yeah. I'm glad that you brought VR into the house. Bobby's probably very glad you brought VR into the house. So I'm curious to try out more stuff that isn't, you know, laughable. Yeah. After you get this laptop, it sounds like, oh, hey, I maybe I should get a vibe. They saw $800 and like, fuck that noise. Yeah. Yeah. Right. But I'm going to give Dark Sakura her mic back now so you can participate in the show. All right. Well, thank you for being here, Alan. Appreciate it. You're welcome. All right. Find some more porn. All right. Let me ask, we had a story about VR here. We want to do at the top of the show too on a related note, right? Yeah. Yeah. We can talk about that. Yeah. So maybe the whole Google IO thing, which is pretty cool because I actually watched that a bit and there was some exciting announcements there showing off. Of course, they talked a bit about VR, talking about, you know, the Google Dream platform or Daydream platform. And some of the things they announced with that, as I mentioned, that they're adding the Galaxy S8 to the lineup of phones that are going to be supporting it. There's also a new LG phone that's supporting it. I don't remember which phone it was, but a new LG phone is also going to be supporting the platform. They're saying that they're also working on some standalone devices. So some that you won't actually need a phone to be able to play VR content on. Which, I mean, it's a good idea, I guess, as long as they're significantly cheaper than the phones. Because honestly, if you're going to need a phone, the devices themselves aren't really that expensive. I mean, even if you're not necessarily picking up a Dream or the Daydream or the Gear VR, I mean, you can get cheap ass cardboard for pretty much nothing. I mean, so, I don't know. But yeah, these standalone devices are saying they're not going to require a phone or PC. Instead, you're going to be getting VR as simple as putting on the actual headset. And it's going to be optimized for VR and include new headset tracking technology called WorldSense. Which is positional tracking without all the extra sensors. So it sounds like a lot, kind of what they're talking about with Microsoft's, the headsets that they're making for them. Where it's going to be using, instead of having external cameras tracking the actual headset, the headset's tracking kind of the environment. It also kind of sounds like the console of VR in a way, right? Because that's what consoles are, right? They hook up directly to your TV and it's a game-dedicated device. Honestly though, I mean, that's cool if you're going to launch that. But I'm wary, just even with what's available on the Oculus Store and what's available on the Play Store. There's not really anything that justifies having a standalone device using this. Unless it's going to take a lot of that PC stuff. But then you're just kind of like, well, how much is this thing really going to cost? And if it's going to run PC content. I just have a hard time seeing how that would be worth it. I'm getting a little worried too, and I have been for some time. And you all know this is my concern, is that I'm really worried this VR pool is super diluted right now. Like, I'm not saying there should be only one player in VR. Like, I'm not saying that at all. But I'm having a really hard time keeping track of all these different devices. I'm having to defer to Bobby Blackwell constantly. What's that thing called? What's the Power Rangers thing on? I just don't fucking know, and I kind of think that's a problem. I don't know, I guess if I asked a non-video gamer what are the consoles available. They would not be able to say off the top of their head, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch. They would not be able to do that. I just can't help but feel like we've got so many choices that that can't be productive, right? But with that said though, what they're showing off with the AR stuff actually is really cool. So with the whole visual positioning service that they're basically putting into these phones, it allows it to basically kind of track your movement and everything based on your environment. And because they know where you are based on your GPS, and they kind of know what you're looking at with their contextual AI, they're able to do kind of some neat stuff. So for example, one of the things that they showed off is like, okay, you're looking at a restaurant on the street and you get kind of a pop-up showing, okay, here are the reviews for this restaurant. It knew what you were looking at. It was kind of like, okay, showing you information about that. And so I can see that being kind of cool, especially if the tracking gets better. I mean, you could do all sorts of cool stuff with that with AR. So that's kind of what I think is a little bit more interesting. I'm all for them putting more money into the VR stuff. The other cool thing they were showing off was also this AR pioneer program. So what that was is basically AR for classrooms. So they had these sets that looked like they were on selfie sticks with a phone, and they were actually doing different educational experiences. So, okay, we're going to see what a tornado looks like, or we're going to look at the galaxy or watch a volcano, and they can walk around and look at it. And I was like, that's pretty cool. For kids, that's really going to get them engaged and kind of learning everything. So that's kind of cool. Yeah, that's pretty cool. Again, showing my age here a little bit, but I lived through that age when VHS devices were new in the homes. I was young, like five, six, but still. And I remember just educational tapes so that I could watch Leonard Nimoy animating a movie. And yes, this was a real tape that I had, these little science films, where they would show pictures of traveling to Neptune, or obviously there's only so much they have they put on the film. But you guys know kind of where I'm going with this. I think a lot of times they would show it to you through the telescope, whatever. But as a kid, I remember like, holy shit, you could see these planets on my TV. And that was technology when I was younger, 30 years ago when I was that age. And now the fact that, okay, now the technology is like, okay, now we put you on the fucking surface of Mars, because we can do that, but that's still really cool for the kids. The price of this technology is going to get cheaper and cheaper. So we imagine these standalone headsets later on when, okay, hey, we're going to visit the surface of Mars because we actually have photographs of fucking Mars that we can stitch together into some VR thing. And I'm pretty sure that's probably already out there. You can already do that. But, you know, more mainstream where you can actually have kids experience that. And that's kind of cool. It's like you're literally visiting the surface of another planet. I'm trying to parse some of this stuff in chat here over at live.vognetwork.com. Let's see, SG100Matt says, I could see the good in there being a lot of choices. It forces everyone with a VR device to try to outdo the other and innovate. Competition can lead to more or quicker innovation as long as they see it's beneficial. Kaijuto in chat says, VR is not diluted at all. It's like one day there isn't enough for VR, the next there is too much for it. Make up your minds, lol. VR is fine and growing. I mean, okay, yeah, VR is growing. But I just, you know, if I wanted to start with VR, where should I go? There's so many options right now. I would assume, for me, I would go to PlayStation VR simply because I'm a gamer and that's, you know. I think it's going to be pretty interesting. Especially now that you have Microsoft kind of, they're going to base an operating system around VR AR. I think once that stuff starts hitting, I mean, God, in a decade's time we could be all using VR stuff as a PC. You know, we're going to be going to work and using this virtual space. And that's not going to be a weird thing. Come on, confide in me and chat says, I wonder if someday we'll be able to use AR to unlock a cute guy's private pics. Like, woof, scruff, unlock his pics. You know, be careful what you ask for because here's the thing. I mean, look, everything is going to come back to the whole time to penis and porn thing at the end of the day. But, you know, I could see definitely like one place where VR is going, especially with Facebook's involvement in this whole thing is, you know, like your Facebook newsfeed. You know, right now you can broadcast live video on Facebook, right? And, you know, I don't see a whole lot of exciting, exciting stuff in there. Like usually it's just a friend either playing a Blizzard game because it's integrated or talking about their day. Or I have one friend that will do drunk cooking, which I think is a big thing on YouTube too. They'll get on their Facebook feed and drink and cook to do that. But I would think it's only a matter of time before in VR, you could be at somebody's wedding that you couldn't be there in real life. But you could still attend it in VR through Facebook streaming and Oculus and all this tech. Like I don't think the technology is obviously not totally there yet, but like it's close. And as the cost of all this stuff, I mean, could you do that today? Yes, you probably could. But could your grandma easily see it? Probably not. But as the cost of this technology comes down and down and down in the next few years, we're going to be there pretty quick. So it's just interesting. Anyway. All right. And some folks in our chat are complaining. I guess our servers are having a little bit of a hiccup, but it's not on our end. It's on the server's end because we're still streaming a consistent amount of data. And more importantly, we didn't pop out of chat. That's usually a good sign. If it's on our end, we'll get disconnected from chat. And that didn't happen. But we're going to just try to push forward with our show anyway. RageNator in chat says the servers are drunk cooking apparently. Apparently. Apparently that's happening. All right. Anyway, lots of good VR talk. I'm sure there's going to be plenty more. Plenty more. E3 is around the corner. Who knows? I'm excited to see some more PlayStation VR announcements. Yeah, I'm excited. And I would like to see if Microsoft might be taking the next step with HoloLens. I'm assuming no because Scorpio is going to be their focus this year. Just please don't announce a complete redesign of the PlayStation VR headset because I'm going to feel a little bit pissed off if that's going to be the case. Yeah, well. I don't have one yet, so they could do that. But anyway. No, I get it. I get it. All right. Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week. Dark Soccer, I'll start with you. How was your gaming week? It was very light, just given work's been so busy. But I played some World of Warcraft, some Pokemon Go, Miitomo. Good lord. And I played a lot of Bust-A-Move. Like I played for like an hour and a half on like endless mode and never lost. And I was like, where did the fucking time go? And then I realized that it went down the drain along with the rest of my free time. So that's really it. Not a whole bunch. Although Shane's trying to get me into this room 999 game. Oh, yeah. He's been talking about that. He said, I don't know a lot about it. I keep trying to get him to come back to the show to talk about it. He said he's going to lend it to me. It's like an escape room as a video game is what he kind of described it to me as. It looks like it was up my alley because of the light down in Roompa. That's kind of funny because I thought escape rooms were based on Flash games to begin with. Like the Crimson Room? Or the Red Room? Yeah, like all those little Japanese Flash games where it's like you're stuck in a room and you have to put the clues together. I thought that's what they did. The real life escape room was based on. To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase LAMP. I thought when I heard, this is a while back when we were like selling that game, I thought it was like Saw. If I remember, maybe I'm thinking... It's kind of, from what I understand, it's a mix. There is some Saw-like elements to it. But the first thing I told Shane was I hate those movies. But he says it's not like in-your-face gore. It's kind of like off-camera type of thing. So I was like, alright, I guess I could probably handle that. I mean, if I can play Silent Hill, I can handle some of it. So, anyway. Alright, well then, if that's it for Dark Soccer's Gaming Week, let's talk about Loki's Gaming Week. So, I played a few mobile games. So, of course, more office space, idle profits. Because it's still entertaining. A little bit of Pokemon Go. Although, I got to say, this event that they did was like some rock-type adventure event thing. It's pretty lame. I guess we just have a lot of rock-type Pokemon around here already. So, it's just like, it's the same shit. I didn't notice anything. It's like, oh, more Rhyhorns. Hooray. That's how the water and grass events were for me in San Francisco. It's the same, it's just if you have what's already there, you're not going to see a difference. I just wish they would, yeah. Well, they have like, oh, there's going to be an Aerodactyl. Okay, cool. I don't have that. Let's catch that. Nope. Not seeing that anywhere. Fucking liars. So, yeah, it's been alright. I mean, I don't know. It's not as exciting as some of the other events that they've had. So, I'll just look forward to the next one, I guess. And then, of course, I got the new laptops. So, I've been just slowly loading some stuff on there. Probably going to do some modded Skyrim, because now I can mod the hell out of it and do all the fancy EMB stuff. But, haven't bothered to do that just yet. I did try a couple things. One of the last games I picked up was a game called, it's hardly a game, but it's an application called Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator. It's basically this Unity game where you put tons of units down and you watch them battle against each other. So, you can do ridiculous shit like, okay, it's a thousand T-Rexes versus some Archers and stuff like that. And it's just fun to watch. So, I did that for about ten minutes. I'm like, okay, I've seen that. Now, I'm going to go do something else. So, of course, it's been a while since I went back to Grand Theft Auto. And so, I picked up Grand Theft Auto 5 and I loaded on there. And I started playing through the story again. So, it looks fantastic on my laptop. And, yeah, I mean, I'm probably going to pick up Overwatch. I was going to pick it up this weekend, but I think we're going to get into a new story about it later. I'm going to wait a couple days, which is probably a good idea. We can say the free weekend's coming up. Yeah, the free weekend's coming up, and then they're doing a game of the year edition. So, I'll pick up the game of the year edition when it comes out. And then Forza Horizon 3, I'm probably going to pick that up. I was going to pick up an Xbox One controller to go with it, but my fucking god, those are expensive. I still use the 360 controller. It was like 80 bucks for the controller that doesn't fucking have a rechargeable battery. You've got to buy a rechargeable battery for another 25. I'm like, why? I can either buy Forza Horizon or this controller. I'll just use the 360 controller. I don't need the fucking trigger rumbles. So, I'm just going to hold off on that. But I'll eventually pick up Forza Horizon 3 because it looked pretty cool and I think it should run pretty well on this. Yeah, so, I mean, that's it. Awesome. All right, let's go to JD. How was your gaming week? And, JD, you've been really quiet tonight and I can't fix it on the board, so just make sure that microphone is real close to your mouth. Okay, is this better? Yeah, much. All right. It's been good. My sister came to visit me the past two weeks. So, we've been playing a lot of local multiplayer on Switch. I have Mario Kart, I have Puyo Puyo Tetris, and we played Snipperclips. So, that was the first half of this week. And I've also been playing, you know, Street Pass games on my DS, and Pokemon Shuffle, and Pokemon Go, and a couple other Pokemon games because I'm crazy like that. The arcade we went to was another definite highlight of my gaming week. I played a Groove Coaster, and I saw somebody posted, like, the last time you were there, there was a Crypt of the Necrodancer song, and so I had to play that one. I thought it was a really neat take on the roguelike moving every beat mechanic, because they had this- I believe that song is also in Pers- not Persona, the game that Jamie and Shane are obsessed with. Why can't- the name told us- Danganronpa? Danganronpa. Why do I- why am I thinking Persona? They kind of rhyme. Danganronpa, Persona, kind of. Anyway, that song in Crypt of the Necrodancer is also in Danganronpa because Shane made me film it and tweeted it at Jamie. There were a couple of different songs on the machine that were labeled Crypt of the Necrodancer, and I'm not sure if it's because- I know one of them was definitely from the game itself, and I'm wondering if some of the other was just, like, the music person did, like, a remix of a different game song. I don't know, but the specific one I played from the game, like, there were a lot of notes where it was, move the controller in an arrow direction on the beat, which really mimicked a lot of the way you're playing Crypt of the Necrodancer, where you're moving on the beat. And I thought that was a really neat crossover kind of a thing. I played Neon FM for the first time, which I'd, like, heard a bit about, but it was neat. It reminded me a lot of Poppin', like, five-key Poppin' with, you know, flat pads. But it was a nice change. And yeah, there was a State Mania cabinet, so I got to play, you know, erotic songs that haven't been in arcades in years. So, you know, I filled the bowling alley with Oh Nick, Please Not So Quick and stuff like that. During the kid's birthday party. It's good. Yeah, well, you know, they weren't running around, exactly, mostly. There was also a DDR 2014, which I don't think was a mix that got released in the US. And they had Caramel Dancin', so I had to play that. Curse you for doing so. Yeah, that was about it. Nice. Let's see, my gaming week. So, on a bit of a personal note, I hit affiliate status on my Twitch channel. So, thank you guys very much for supporting, because obviously What does that mean? What does that mean? That means that now I can put that on my resume. Now you get a dollar. Yeah, literally, now I can get a dollar. Now, when I say give me a dollar, you can actually give me a dollar. It makes me eligible for bits, which are the currency on Twitch that So how do you do that? Like, give the podcast for enough time? Oh, to hit the affiliate status? Yeah. There is, I think, four different criteria. You have to have at least 50 followers. So, you know, that's you guys that helped me make that, thank you. You have to have at least three concurrent viewers over all your streams For the past month, for the past 30 days. Which, again, because a lot of my streaming has been after OLR And I've been able to pick up a good, you know, 20 or so people watching Right after OLR, that's been very helpful. So, again, thank you guys. You made that possible. But I know that is the criteria that Flaco Jones, I think he thinks he's Hung up on that right now, because I think in the beginning of the month He didn't have a lot of people watching his stream. He's been picking up, as he's been doing it more regularly And he's thought up some other ideas, I think he's getting more viewers So hopefully he's going to hit it soon, too. But that is the trickiest one for people to hit, I think, is three concurrent. It doesn't sound like a lot, but it can be for a new person starting out Especially when so many people are streaming, right? So what is it, 50 followers, three concurrent? Seven days in the past 30 days that you've done a stream And then 500 minutes in the past 30 days of streaming. Which is about, if you do like an hour and 15 minutes Two or three times a week, you'll hit those criteria. So then it's kind of about just getting the followers and the viewers from there Which, you know, just takes a little time. But yeah, it makes me eligible for the bits, which You can either buy them through Twitch, which a lot of people are doing Or you can watch the ads, you can watch an ad and you get like five bits Or ten bits every time you watch an ad And what you can do is you can cheer a viewer So if somebody decides to cheer my channel Using the bits that they've got, watching ads Then I get one cent for every bit that is cheered at me So I've made, I think, about five dollars so far streaming on Twitch But you know what? Hey, I've been playing video games, having a good time And honestly, I'm not doing it for the money. Let me just be straight I've done this show for 15 years and haven't made a dime off this show Any money that has been made during OLR, like we've gotten some very generous donations over the years But that all has gone right back into the show Buying a mixing board, paying for the VOG stream, paying for mics Whatever it is, all that money has gone back into the show So, where was I going with that? Oh yeah, I don't expect to make money off of streaming But the nice thing about it is that I'm hoping what the affiliate status does Is that maybe it's going to help with a little bit more additional visibility Because what I'm trying to do is get more people exposed to OLR and VOG through streaming It's just like getting yourself out there, is what it is But I've been having fun playing games with people So now you can kind of see some of the games I've been playing throughout the week Because I played Forza Horizon 3 one night I played Diablo 3 again, but I did it on PC So I was doing Seasons this time around And I made my seasonal character I got all the way to I think Chapter 6 I think I'm in Chapter 6 now on my seasonal character on Diablo 3 So yes, I'm still playing a lot of that Still playing Final Fantasy XIV, eagerly anticipating Stormblood Which is less than a month out now until Early Access So that's really exciting And yeah, that's pretty much everything that I've live streamed There hasn't been a lot that I didn't live stream that I played Except we played some Mario Kart 8 the other night Which I have to vent about a little bit Because you know where I'm going with this So JD brought a Switch over And I was like, cool! We'll be able to do like, oh we can play Mario Kart Like I'll play on the TV And JD can play on the Switch And it's like we're battling each other, right? Okay, so in theory, this should, you know, it's a Nintendo thing It should just work, right? Right Oh my god, like no, we're having connection issues out the wazoo Like we could not, like JD, and to be fair Alan and I were both playing on the TV And then you were playing on your Switch device And we kept getting disconnected Like we couldn't even set, we got to do one race And then it disconnected us right after Or it would disconnect us during the prep Or we would always get disconnected We were like, what the hell is going on? So finally it was just like, fuck it We can do three people on the TV We just ended up doing it that way But then we tried again yesterday But this time we said, okay let's put Because your Switch was already in there Because you were playing Zelda on the TV While I was out doing something else And so I was like, okay I'll play on my Switch And we got through a whole circuit And we got through four races And then got disconnected When we switched to battle, wasn't it? Yeah, yeah, yeah, and then we tried to switch to battle But like, it shouldn't fucking do this Yeah, it's stupid because it doesn't even have anything to do with the internet Yeah Like this is just two Switches in proximity Like street passing or whatever, you know Like it's near field communication And it shouldn't be dropping like that And this really concerns me because this was the feature That like I'm most looking forward to on Switch Right Is being able to do this all in one room like this I am totally shocked Well, not shocked actually You know what we should do is we should try it with Puyo Puyo Tetris And see if it does the same thing See if it's the game or the system Or something else, you know, do some elimination testing Have you all tried this out in the chat Since we do have a live chat room over at live.fognetwork.com Have you guys had some issues trying to do Again, not internet, but in the same room Trying to do some gaming on Switch I've had absolutely no problem with Puyo Puyo Tetris But I have it on PS4 Well, what about Mario Kart 8? That's not going to help our situation So anyway, let's see ActDef says I played with friends last night Two on TV and two on a Switch And we didn't have any problems So yeah, it's I don't know what's going on there I feel like it might be something unique to my setup Is it because there's Is it because the Switch is right near all the other electronics Like maybe Maybe my I feel like it shouldn't make a difference Maybe I need to move the dock away from the other electronics You're right, it shouldn't make a difference It shouldn't make a difference I can't think of what else it is Well, for NFR The only things that could cause Any big problem with that would be If it's going through a concrete wall Or the microwave's going You can't tell me The Switch can't do what a DS can do Or the Bluetooth See, I don't want to say this Because I'm going to get judged by some people But y'all can kiss my butt It is sitting on top of my subwoofer Would that be Interference? That might be it That's going to be the first thing we try Maybe we're going to try moving it around Get it off the subwoofer No, it doesn't sit on the subwoofer But it sits right next to it If there's interference I set the games on top of the subwoofer Also, maybe line of sight might be a concern You were sitting on the couch Maybe the recliner would be better I'm just saying if you're holding the console Against it or something Maybe it's the subwoofer Speculation Troubleshooting is so much fun To be fair You guys are probably all rolling your eyes Rob, you're such an idiot It would be nice if Nintendo gave a little more description What is the communication error? Did a particular Switch drop? What's the fucking error? Give me something to help diagnose it a little better There's no error, it's a feature Shut up, alright I had to get that off my chest because that really concerned me But we'll just hope It was my Unique setup here in this household And not something that's going to be Long ongoing Anyway, let's move on And talk about some quick plugs Announcements, of course you can always follow us on Twitter Twitter.com slash O-L-R We're also on Facebook Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio June is going to be a Crazy month here at O-L-R E3 is going to be Taking over our episode on June 11th, no literally It is taking over our episode because Bethesda has their press conference Right in the middle of the show, but as always We're still going to do our thing here at VOG Network We'll start the show Pause it during the Bethesda conference Then pick up right there with some live reaction And all that good stuff And your calls and all that stuff as well The week after that, June 18th We celebrate 15 years Of OrangeLoungeRadio 15 freaking years Of OrangeLoungeRadio You know I need to look up When OrangeLoungeRadio started On live 365 because we launched the station A month before we launched The show because we were just playing music Like building hype to the first Like live event show that we were doing And I want to say the station started I feel like May 22nd Was the day, I could be wrong But I want to say it was late May So we're, technically OLR is like 15 Tomorrow Just not the show You can wear the dress I don't have the dress so I'll just come and drag Alright yeah it's fine, come and drag So June 18th is going to be the big 15th year because the first official Episode of OrangeLoungeRadio Is June 23rd, 2002 So we're going to celebrate 15 years On June 18th and then on June 25th we will be rewarding Our 15 years of OrangeLoungeRadio By taking a day off I will be in Chicago And my co-host will be Enjoying a day off I will probably be at San Francisco Pride That's right you're doing San Francisco Pride Kind of busy We're spreading pride throughout the world Because I'll be at Chicago Pride Alright cool So no show that day Episode 700 is creeping up on us And I am, that is in the back Of my head Unfortunately due to some personal life stuff Going on I wasn't able, I was supposed To go check out that space That our folks here, Bree and Gabe Were talking about, I was supposed to do that yesterday And I wasn't able to get around to it I'm hoping at some point I'm going to go over there and check it out And we are Exploring options for a place here Locally we can do Episode 700 Like as a more Event type show so Please look forward to it Or something around Episode 700 It may not be the actual show itself Is it going to be 700 club themed?

I don't know They're saying that it's going to be open to All E3 badge holders And the event will be continuing through E3 11 through 7 o'clock Attendees can check out Devolver's Lineup of games and also They'll be where the Indie Megabooth XSplit and Gambitius Take place And yeah so that's pretty Cool that they're going to have their own Indie They haven't announced a time yet for the Press conference but stay tuned for that I'm sure they're going to have to announce it pretty soon Alright well Any games you're hoping to see Out of them? They have such kind of wild Different stuff over there Yeah I just want something wild and cool Honestly I don't remember I don't think they publish super hot I would love to see super hot VR make it to The Playstation VR that's what I would like to see Because the VR one looks pretty awesome For the Vive And the Oculus so I'm kind of curious To see what that would be like on the Playstation Or I just wouldn't really want to play it $800 fucking headset and even the Oculus headset it's like $600 That shit needs to come down in price $300 That would be perfect Let's see I'm going to our chat over at Live.vognetwork.com Bobby Blackwolf says Devolver Digital has some former gathering Of developers people and they had The God lot before there were Condos across the street from the LA Convention Center It was the same kind of thing except with more Strippers and I'm not kidding they were stripper poles That's awesome I remember the days when it was Was it the Ouya event that was there? What was across the street from the LA Convention Center? Was that Ouya? The one year? They had Ouya No because I gave a shit about Ouya because it was one thing I could get into without a badge I think that was the year I went And I picked up Bobby Blackwolf at E3 And then we went to Disneyland Because I didn't actually go to E3 that year But we just went in the lobby in street past I was there for that wasn't I? That was electronica We've done it more than once So there it is Well you're not going to do the Ouya event anymore No we're not Alright moving on let's talk about A rumor about what could be coming to Smartphones you know Nintendo has been doing Their smartphone thing and They what me Tomo JD still plays me Tomo Yeah I lug in everything I was just checking in a moment ago My son plays the shit Out of Super Mario Run Which I think Super Mario Run Was more of a mixed bag of success I think their expectations were just really high for that Wasn't there also a Fire Emblem game? There was I have not Yeah I have not checked that out myself But that's a thing Well the Wall Street Journal is reporting that Nintendo Is going to be bringing the Legend of Zelda Franchise to mobile later this year This will be after Animal Crossing which we already knew Was slated for mobile Clearly they're going to bring the best Zelda Zelda 2 Adventures of Link I like Zelda 2 But A playing that on a phone Would be a disaster No that's not the worst of the franchise It would be Zelda Wand of Gamelon There you go that's a better joke Stick to that joke next time Anyway we don't know the game What it is the pricing structure This is all coming from the Wall Street Journal Saying the news is from people Familiar with the matter They've got leaks everywhere That the Wall Street Journal finds Maybe this is something that could come out at E3 A little more information about Especially with the popularity of Breath of the Wild This is a good thing to ride the coattails of We will see There will be a pretty huge franchise for Nintendo Although granted they put Mario on the phone You can't go much bigger than that really But Zelda is pretty close Especially with how well Breath of the Wild has been doing Non-stop Link Now well here's the thing I would expect It's not going to be a 2D It's not going to be the original Zelda It's not going to be Zelda Link to the Past Because you can't control that shit on the phone It's going to be horrible controls And I don't think Nintendo is going to sell it I disagree with that you know why? If you played the DS versions The Wind Waker looking ones Those all use touchpad controls I was getting to that because those are different games The Phantom Hourglass Completely different game And that's the type of game that I would expect A Rails shooter But with Zelda No it wasn't a Rails shooter Did you play those games? I mean seriously It's kind of a joke but yes Okay you didn't Obviously not because They controlled really well for touch Which is surprising They didn't really utilize the buttons at all It was basically you hold the screen Where you want Zelda There you go making a new mistake Have you ever watched the show? Take off that mask Jamie I'd like to keep it on You control Link by Basically holding the part of the screen And you can attack by tapping And it worked really well Which is kind of surprising From what I remember they didn't really utilize Buttons too much They could put a couple on screen buttons If you really needed something for that The only thing they could do for the most part Completely touch control and it would be fine Or they could just do a completely new idea And that would be fine too Honestly they you know Or they could just put fucking Pokemon Snap on there Because really that would be fucking amazing With like the AR shit They could do something in the Breath of the Wild world With all of the crazy stuff that you do And they're like you know using the different items It would be like cooking Mama but just cooking Link What about like a dungeon solver type of thing Or the shrines like a shrine solver type of thing That lends itself well to mobile phones I don't know there's different ideas They could do it doesn't necessarily have to be a copy Of something that already exists But this is all really Fan wank right now we just don't know What is really going to happen with Zelda so We'll just have to keep waiting till E3 To see if they talk about it then or if they They wait on it It might be actually I would think that this Type of thing may not be in the E3 Spotlight or whatever they're calling it It might be something that shows up at Treehouse Cause remember they show Pokemon Go at Treehouse And that was the first time they ever showed Gameplay outside of beta on that And we have this stupid Watch thing that we still Don't sell regularly even though it's been out For almost a year now I still want to cheat with it I wanted to take it apart and solder the fucking Lights to the button So that every time it would light up it would click the button Cause that's what I do I find ways to exploit shit And it would have been satisfying To be able to lord that over them Moving on to another story Dark Sakura if you wouldn't mind Well I have been Looking at this game with some kind Of mixed feelings but it's about Sonic Forces Well you get to customize a character In Sonic Forces You can have different Species of animals With their own different abilities And the things that they carry with them And their own looks Different masks so you basically get to Play dress up in Sonic Which is gonna open the door for A lot of Cosplay There are a lot of furry characters out of this You could I said it nicely by saying If you want to act out your first sona In a Sonic universe you go Right ahead, have fun There's a lot of people who already do that shit So now they just get to say Look I'm canon I'm in the game I'm canon What's the solution To Sonic's shitty friends? Let's make an infinite amount of Sonic's shitty friends Make it now it's you Now you're the bad friend I don't know if I hate the shitty friends Because I'm the shitty friend I'm so torn Everybody's gonna make their own shitty friend And then they're gonna post their shitty pictures To social media Through the Switches Twitch and Facebook Look I'm in a Sonic game Sonic's butt Can you put your me's in there? Can we have Hitler Sonic's friend? No no no That's terra bad Yeah they need to have limitations On what you can do Because otherwise There's people that have done me's That are just cocking balls There's people that have done me's That are Christmas and New Years It's all right there It's just gonna be a thing now isn't it Yes I can't wait for December Moving on You don't want to see Hanukkah All right That lasts for weeks Moving on Loki All right Ubisoft has made some announcements Prior to E3 Some things we're gonna be seeing more of During their press conference Far Cry 5 And The Crew 2 Are gonna be Coming soon And apparently maybe a new Assassin's Creed Cause I think that they took the year off So now we'll see something like that Remember I think we had the rumor that it was Opel World or something So I guess we'll see what's gonna happen But apparently yeah those three Are due to be released This fiscal year That's pretty cool that The Crew Is getting a sequel after all Cause I didn't think the first game did that well Cause it was like bargain basement Pretty cheap to play Pretty fast So I didn't think that lent well I'm not dogging the game To be fair I think a lot of people I knew that did Spend time with the game enjoyed it So I'm not saying it was a bad game Or unworthy of a sequel I was surprised with how fast they slashed the price That it's doing well enough to Necessitate a sequel Hopefully Maybe they'll do What they need to do to make it So that more people want to drop 50-60 bucks on it right away Dungeon Buster in Chat says I hope they fix the rubber banding And magnetic tires in The Crew The game was kind of fun but wow Issues We just like never ever do rubber banding ever again No one likes it Who actually likes rubber banding? Nobody Just like get rid of it It's a cop out For programming better driving AI Make it something you can enable and disable I don't know Tigerclaw in Chat says every racing game has rubber banding Like it or not I don't like it Yeah that's right I choose not to like it So I started a podcast about it Something I like though That I like talking about on the podcast Is Overwatch And Overwatch believe it or not is turning a year old It feels like that game is a lot older But I think it seems so cemented In gaming now Overwatch is coming up With their game of the year edition On Tuesday May 23 Is when that game of the year edition comes out It's going to be coming with 10 bonus loot boxes Some new hero skins Blackwatch Reyes And Strike Commander Morrison skins You can also get some of the stuff that I think Was in the original Overwatch Origins edition like the Ferris skin And some of that other stuff That is going to be available on PlayStation 4 Xbox One and PC But they're also going to be running an anniversary event In the game They haven't really said much more about what are the skins going to look like There are some voices that showed up But that's all we know So we don't really know exactly What all the extra stuff is going to be with that yet But yeah very cool That that game is Still doing strongly After a year I'm kind of curious how they're going to keep the momentum Going a few years from now So far they're doing really well And hell I'm still playing Diablo 3 And that game's That was like 2008, 2009 at this point Getting to be an older game No I don't think it's that old But still it's several years old at this point We get a Diablo 4 pretty soon? I wish Maybe that's one of the under construction things Or you think we'll see more Character classes or something For Overwatch? Diablo So they already announced that So that I still feel like it's going to be a couple years Before we even see Diablo 4 But I don't know Anyway Let's see, ActDeftInChat says it was Game of the Year In 2016 I don't think I mentioned it in that story But I know it's part of this too They are doing a free play weekend Over Memorial Day weekend of all times too So if you've never played Overwatch You have a chance This is the first time I think they've done the free play on PC I know they've done it on console a couple times But I think this is the first time they're doing it on PC I've never played it Yeah, no, I'm excited to have you check it out See what you think And I'm going to use controller like a complete noob Because I don't have a place to put my computer Where I can actually use a mouse Nor do I have a mouse Ooh, that's going to be rough, but good luck Fuck that, I'm fucking awesome with controller I think they did do free play on a PC a while back Because that was when Ryan tried it Maybe they did, I just don't remember it It was definitely a while ago, like six months or something Yeah, and I bought the game straight away So I wouldn't have been paying attention to that Let's see, SSQ100Matt saying I remember a chatter in here saying that Overwatch wasn't going to stick around Because Blizzard can't do shooters I wonder how that worked out Well, I think the reason why Overwatch is kind of working is because It's more than just a shooter They do have characters in there that you can play If you're not much of a shot A character like Symmetra Is really about where you place the turrets And you don't even really have to be able to aim To attack with Symmetra's gun And that makes her a very attractive player For some people A healer like Mercy You don't really have to be able to aim You support other characters Lucio is all about an aura You know, it's a healing aura or a boost aura So you don't necessarily have to be a good shot And I think that's what has made it very, very, very Attractive for a lot of people But if you want to play, I mean You have a Widowmaker who's a sniper And Soldier 76 is just basically Your Call of Duty character So they have that stuff in there too If that's what you're into Alright, and Yeah, SSG100Matt says They find new ways to reinvent the game all the time And Act F even suggests For Loki, start with Soldier 76 Because that will be the most familiar Probably from Other shooting games Alright, we will move on Just a few more stories for you guys Before we get to the classic game of the week But first, Dark Sakura This is something I've been Considering contributing to Ever since I found out But Project Rap Rabbit Is set for PC and PS4 And it has a Kickstarter on it With a 1.1 million dollar goal I see them making it No problem But there's Actually quite a few tiers on there And several of them seem actually fairly affordable One of the digital tiers Is like maybe 30 bucks For the game And then For like 70, there's one that has Art books and stuff with it I wouldn't mind having the art book for it Although Dan says I have 50 million art books For games I haven't played So, but Good, what's one more? But at any rate Basically, Rap Rabbit Is actually taking inspiration From what it's been Commented on like epic rap battles Of history Where it's a Rapping dialogue Not like necessarily a battle But a dialogue And you've got like different verses That you can throw in and not just doing whatever They're already in the song So, it definitely It definitely looks cool and definitely is something That I think is going to be getting Money from you on Kickstarter So I see some people In chat talking about the Switch version Of this, so here's the thing that happened To that, so when it was originally on Kickstarter, they posted all of their stretch goals And like the last stretch Goal on there was like a 5.5 million Stretch goal and it would say Switch version And the Nintendo fanboys Screamed basically, which I Kinda get, I mean that was a real That was a lot of money to do a Switch version So they've actually changed it and if you go back To the Kickstarter today, Switch is now The first stretch goal with 1.5 Million to get the Switch version Which, you know, the game Would definitely be attractive I think if it was on The Switch, but Well, and a little bit more about The character is that the main character is called Totomaru, who is basically A farm boy rabbit and wants To battle the forces of corruption And his sidekick is named Totomaru I'm in a really difficult place With this thing, I love these Companies, I love these, like you know Nana On'Sha, like I love these Companies, there's so much talent going into This, that being said, I'm kinda Done backing Big studio Kickstarters I realize these studios aren't big But like I'm not interested in buying The game today that's not gonna come out for 4 years And I know they say, oh we have A path to get it out Sure you do, buddy They all do Now, indies, and we've talked a lot about Indie Kickstarters on this show, I feel a lot Differently about, okay But something of this caliber, especially for these Guys that have done Playstation games before And so forth, like, I'm just kind of Shocked they can't get a publisher To sign on to this Like, I don't know, like Where's your guys' heads at with this? Like, Jamie, you said you were thinking about contributing to it So you must be a little more forgiving I'd rather that they raise the money Themselves this way and go independently For a publisher Just because I've seen publishers fuck stuff up You know what, I know what it is I know what bothered me about it It actually did have to do with the Nintendo thing I thought it was weird That the game was a Playstation 4 And a PC exclusive Because my head went to If it's a Playstation 4 exclusive Sony should be paying for it Not me Now, I realize the Switch thing Has changed a little bit So I don't feel that as much anymore But definitely when I first loaded the page That was a huge misfire on their part To be like, we'll do Nintendo Switch if we get 5 million dollars Because I'm kind of like, if you're going to stay Exclusive to one platform, then that platform Should be fronting the money for it And where the hell is Xbox One? I kind of get, it's Japanese developed So that question's Kind of, eh, I get it Probably is never Yeah, I know, I know It could also be based off what dev kits they have Maybe they have a Playstation 4 dev kit That could be, that could be But I just, I still couldn't help but feel a little bit of like Why am I paying for something that is going to be exclusive to one system You know, and all this stuff And I just I don't know, I just I feel like there's Kickstarters I've contributed to A long time ago Bloodstained, Ritual of the Night Which is a good example Still not out And I'm sure the game's going to be fine And it's, you know, all that stuff But it's like I'm not interested in making this 4 year long investment I'm sorry, I know some people strongly disagree with me But I kind of just Don't want to give my money away like that I want something a little more immediate I think Bobby Blackwolf says They will still have a publisher 1.1 million isn't enough to make the game They still have other investors And they say He says So We have gone to Great Lakes and are planning an early work to minimize this risk Between the shared experience of developers Nanno and Shaw and Innes And publisher Pcube's platform holder relationships And merchandise production know-how We're confident that all the pieces are in place to ship Project Rap Rabbit along with all Physical backer awards by August 2018 I Even with all that In front of me, I just, I don't I don't believe it And honestly And it sucks, but you can Kind of blame Mighty No. 9 for a lot of it A lot of it Mighty No. 9 done Fucked up Kickstarter Is it making you cry like an anime Fan on prom night? Yes But again When it comes to indies I feel a lot differently I get it The ones that have been on here that are like I need that artist or I need that Or my game is fucking done I need the money to do the distribution And all that stuff I'm kind of like, okay, well you've never done a game before You've clearly been working on something I feel a lot differently with the smaller people Maybe that's just my whole Yay indie type of nature anyway But these other These other things I have a harder time with I don't know Matt says So I don't know I couldn't help but feel a little burned When I saw that it was a Kickstarter Because I was thinking, oh it's going to be a big E3 announcement Yes, I realize Kickstarter Are E3 announcements now Ever since Shenmue 3 But When they were talking this whole thing What was the little tagline Make music games great again and all this stuff I was like, oh Music games are already great A, I was like please don't say that B, like With a line like that I would have thought your game Was ready to go Well then again With a line like that maybe they're channeling The one that said it originally I wouldn't go that far I get it, especially when you're an indie Developer, you want to get the hype And the community built up around your product Early But I just get annoyed, it's like We have this really kick ass product that's not Going to be out for two years Why didn't you just Show me this one that's more ready Did they have video of what it looks like Or is it just all concept shit right now Screenshots I don't think they actually Do they have the game running on that kickstarter I didn't look that far When I looked at it I looked at it on my mobile And I couldn't actually play videos I think I know they had screenshots, they had a lot of that stuff But I don't know if they actually have the game The actual product up there I don't want to go on record saying they don't That makes me wary That early Bobby says it's all concept, it's all whiteboard Yeah I know I'll play it when it comes out I will be, you know what if the game is good I will be the first one To plop down the money for it the day it comes out Good luck Well if you think about it What is really the advantage here I mean what It's just You get some extra crap I mean why should I risk Myself, I mean as it is Games that come out day one from AAA Are risky investments as it is Considering how broken some of them could be At launch, why am I going to put Risk in the game that may never even Come out It doesn't make any sense that you want my money I mean I know that you need to fund it And stuff but Then again you don't need the funding It's almost like we got to show that these Publishers that people are interested in this game That's a publishers job to figure that shit out Why do they have to show interest in it Alright I'm glad somebody in chat got my joke By the way, come on confide in me Says my name is Sky and I've got something to say That's right I got your joke Rob My name is Rob Roberts and I got something to say That part Amplitude done fucked up kickstarter Cause there's another game That I'm sorry, it was not as good As we all hoped it was going to be I'm sorry, straight up Anyway Let's move on We got more stories for you, Loki Alright So Netflix Has a lot of interesting shows They just showed this week Was a new Dark Crystal series Which looks pretty cool Something else that's also in the pipeline That's a little bit more game related And seems Proper for Netflix They're going to be a new series Based on The Witcher The fantasy series of course It is a book series as well as The game series but they're saying that they're Going to be having I guess they have the executive producers Sean Daniel and Jason Brown Who are known for a show Called The Expanse which I have never Seen nor heard of They're going to be following I guess Sounds like the books So it'll be interesting I don't know if you guys have all seen the pictures on Twitter But it's very clear that Julian Assange Is going for the lead role in this From his latest look I don't know if you all have seen that Such an awful bullet So The Witcher has some sexy Stuff in there There's going to be so many boobs in this show It's not a Witcher game Unless Sign me up because We need some Game of Thrones replacements You can have that As long as this time When he stands up in the tub I don't want no suds So Anyway So yeah William Murderface in chat says Witcher hype The direction And the way the stories Are told in The Witcher and all that Is really really well done If they bring some of that to a television show Like seriously It does have the ability to be something On a Game of Thrones-esque kind of level It really does I think the source material for The Witcher Which I understand is also based off a novel series So there's all that That we have to consider as well But I think it could Do really well in a way that video game Media hasn't really been done before Although Is it really video game media if it was all a book to begin with But remember we have Castlevania coming too We'll keep our fingers crossed Can we get boobs in that too? Why not? Well look at the original artwork For Symphony of the Night That's right Granted the Dark Crystal is going to be a little awkward But I mean it's necessary In order to keep a certain level of quality Across all Netflix shows Alright one more story for you guys Before we get to the classic game of the week This one's a very modern game actually I know a lot of people were really hyped for the Destiny 2 event That they had earlier this week Where they showed some footage of the game And shown off all the features coming to Destiny 2 Destiny 2 of course Is going to be coming out for the PC As well as the Playstation 4 and the Xbox One No longer on Playstation 3 or Xbox 360 Although that doesn't surprise anybody But it will be coming out on the consoles What was it? Early September I think was the date on the console right? For Playstation 4 and Xbox One There is no release date for PC yet It will not be out It sounds like the exact same day as September 8th But here's what is really interesting About the PC version of Destiny 2 It's better than both the other versions Well that's one That's an opinion But the other thing that's also interesting Is that it's going to be released on Battle.net Dun dun dun Wait a minute Blizzard's thing? Yes But remember who owns Blizzard? Activision It's Activision Blizzard What does Activision like? Greed That's right So no more 30% cut from the Steam store By releasing that thing on Battle.net And also you guys And this is something I don't see Any of the press really getting into That I think is a huge element Of this and why they're going To the Battle.net launcher for all this Sure the fact that they'll get to keep the cut Of all the digital sales and all that That's a great perk I'm sure You guys I think sometimes severely Underestimate the Blizzard fandom And Don't underestimate the dark side Don't underestimate the fucking Blizzard fandom Don't Because they're fucking crazy And I say that as a Blizzard fan I do I do I love Blizzard fans I had a great time at Blizzcon They're nuts and I mean that in a good way Because why do I say it that way? Why do you think something like Overwatch was As successful as it was? Because It got people that were playing World of Warcraft That were playing Diablo To say hey here's a shooter From this same company that I love That's coming out and I want to try this Or this team based game objective game Or whatever you don't want to call it a shooter And I want to try this out One game I didn't talk about during my gaming week That I actually have been playing quite a bit of Is Heroes of the Storm Why have I been playing Heroes of the Storm? By Blizzard Because I want the fucking Loot boxes for Overwatch That you get by playing a bunch of Matches with friends that's really what it boils Down to so Blizzard Very very very very very good At doing the synergy thing and here Come try our free game to get stuff In the other game and all this stuff now not that I'm saying That Destiny 2 is necessarily going to be a part of that Although this Certainly does open the door for Destiny Characters to start showing up in Heroes of the Storm Just saying Or Overwatch Well Overwatch is kind of It's own universe you don't exactly see the lost Vikings Running around in Overwatch But Heroes of the Storm is kind of that mixing Pot for all the Blizzard things I'm just saying it opens the door to it I'm not saying it's going to happen It just opens the door to it But also And this is another huge thing too is that If you're playing World Of Warcraft which a lot of people Still are some people are Selling their Warcraft gold For real money through This Blizzard token So they have this Blizzard balance That they're building up which most people Are using to therefore buy Overwatch loot boxes But now they could save That money and buy Copies of Destiny 2 because that's going to be Through Battle.net and you know what after they Announce this that Destiny 2 is going to be A part of Battle.net the prices In gold of those WoW tokens went through the Fucking roof because You've got a ton of players now Who are trying to save up money in their Battle.net balance so they can basically Buy Destiny 2 And Blizzard's still making money because Somebody's buying those WoW tokens to You know then that money is getting basically Reallocated to purchasing Destiny 2 so Dungeon Buster In chat says Destiny normally doesn't do any Cross-promotion well it's It's a crazy world out there It's a different game and this is going to be very very Very interesting for PC also some other things That should be mentioned about PC there's like the Full on 4K on PC right I didn't see a lot of the oh here it is on PC Destiny will support 4K That's 3820 by 2160 Un-capped frame rate Custom key mapping text chat And now that it's on Battle.net If I'm playing Destiny 2 I can send Dark Sakura a message through Battle.net while she's playing World of Warcraft And I can send her a message and I can say like It's a lip sync Jamie What part of that don't you understand I'd like to keep it on please And then there's an adjustable FOV field of view detailed PC setting screen 21 by 9 Monitor support and so on So I mean all this just basically Cemented for me oh yeah I'm Skipping consoles and I'll be buying this on PC like I Kind of fell off the Destiny wagon because Expansion expansion Expansion but I'm willing to Give it another go at Destiny 2 because Destiny 2 at least is going to hit the reset button on all That because you know none of that stuff carries Over so I I want to try it with mouse and keyboard on PC I never played the first one I have it I just never played it Yeah Tigerclaw does point out and say You'll need a good graphics card if you Want to play in 4K yes yes you will Need a good graphics card if you want to play in 4K I actually Don't even have a 4K monitor so that's not gonna Do me a lick of good but maybe I'll Buy one for Christmas or Something when I don't know if it's worth it for 4K price Stick with feeling what you got Oh Bobby has no shame At all saying that in the battle net system I could send Jamie a message while she's playing Wow I'm playing a game by Bungie it's immediate predecessor is A very classic game we should feature it If only you could see If only you could see If only you could see She's got one finger flying right now For you Bobby I'm saluting ya Well let's see what she did pick for the classic game of the week this week Every week Dark Soccer Jumps into the gaming vault and finds a game That she thinks hey Put down your destiny Sign out of battle net and play this Cause this game's not on battle net and it's awesome Alright Dark Soccer what is the classic game of the week? This is a game I spent a shitload of time playing In the arcade like a lot I was kinda hooked on this game We already did Dance Dance Revolution Girl APB All Points Bulletin came out in 1987 By Atari Atari games at the time Where you play Officer Bob not the drag queen Who is A rookie police officer And you have to go through Different parts of the game One of them is you go through And you pull people over For minor infractions Well you ticket people for minor infractions With the whole targeting system Or you can pull over Bad offenders and then eventually You get down to where you apprehend criminals When they put out an APB The cabinet Is a neat little cabinet It looks kinda like a police car Where it's got the siren Lights above on top Has a gas pedal, a steering wheel And Even a little seat I think some of them had a seat I remember playing one that didn't have it It really is just a Cartoony little game But it's not easy It is not an easy game In fact even the developers Said that over the development cycle The gameplay got a lot more complicated Than they originally had planned It did have some other Home releases But let's get a little bit more into the game itself Which I think is funny because you play as Car 54 Do you remember that show Where Are You? Exactly, that had, what's his face The Playroom in Munster? Uh, yes I don't remember his name I'll have to look it up again He was one of the officers in that show I mean, and I might But it wasn't around when Car 54 Where Are You was on TV But it did come on Nick at Night Not that old bitches Nick at Night used to run all those shows When we were kids Dennis the Menace from the 50's Was like prime time on Nickelodeon When they thought to make kids cute they had to scream Hey Mr. Woman Pull over buddy So on top of this This is also like every old stereotype You get bonuses for Every day where you arrest over the quota And you can pick up donuts That extend your time limit For the day I know donuts extend my time limit for the day Donuts expand My ability to even They expand my waistline Right? Anyway you can also drive through filling stations To refuel your patrol car You can also Upgrade your patrol car with brakes, guns Armor, radar I just keep thinking of this police car Turning into something from Road Warrior So you start off By ticketing for common Misdemeanors like littering You pull up behind them Tell them to bend over Then you press the siren button And then have them pull over Sometimes you have to kind of Over and over Speeding Comes into the game later And you also You also have to rescue different Not rescue but arrest different Fugitives And then you have to violently shake them To get a confession out of them Before the chief enters the room and you have a Confessometer Unless it's a baby, don't shake the baby God Rob Now I'm all sad because I see that little baby's face Aww Anyway So anyway Your life gauge is kind of like a demerit meter Um So if you hit that Then you get too many demerits You are fired So you can get fired in the game And you earn those by colliding with cones Or other vehicles when your siren is off Shooting Non offender vehicles Running into donut huts and pedestrians Running out of gas And failing to get a confession You can also Get demerits when your car explodes Or when you get hit by a train Or high speed collisions You know just all kinds of shit So basically you have to be perfect Um Now um the seat that I was talking about By the way it looks like it was detachable And I remembered because the first version I played Didn't have the seat on it Um APB had a really long Development process though like I mentioned earlier And so as it went on They added so many Things to it that it really became Complicated much more so than they had envisioned Um it was Pretty well received For the time it had great high resolution graphics The cabinet design was fairly new Especially with having the flashing lights On top it really made it attractive Um and It's difficulty was something That kept people going in to try to Master it you know So um There were home versions Mostly developed by Tengen Um there was A version on GameCube Actually I'm getting way ahead of the Original releases The original home versions Were Amiga, Atari ST, Commodore 64 ZX Spectrum in 1989 And then there was an Atari Lynx version That came out in 1991 which I think I have it I'll have to ask Um for the later versions we had A GameCube version, PS2 and Xbox As part of Midway Arcade Treasures 2 And a PC as Midway Arcade Treasures Deluxe Edition And later on was part of the Midway Arcade Origins in 2012 And there you go APB That's the game I have to admit I've only played the Slightest bit of this I think it was in one of those Like Midway collection things cause you know They have all the old Atari games in those too like the This is totally the same hardware It's like 720 in some of those other games Yeah the same era I think this is in one of those so I've only played like the Lightest bit of it but yeah I remember it being freaking hard It is but it's super Fun and I mean just the Cabinet itself you know When we got one At my Aladdin's castle That shows you how Long ago it was when I first Saw this one which I ended up eventually Working at when I was in college so Um but There amongst the carpeted walls and Everything was this shiny new game And I really enjoyed it yes it had Carpeted walls The arcade nice had carpeted Walls like you sound sound proving Yeah But true story carpeted walls at roller rink I tore up my jeans and my knee Rolling going at high Speed into one of those walls so I had Bad memories of carpeted walls Alright there it is your classic Game of the week APB Alright a good Good from a real much Better era of Atari than some of Our more recent memories although those Flashback consoles are still pretty sweet for what it's worth Anyway we're going to take a quick break but we have Plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come Including release dates, your emails And some more news stories And your calls at Orange Lounge Radio All one word on Skype and we'll Be back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live tonight Episode 687 already in progress For this May 21st 2017 If you are Joining us late well shame on you for being Here late no just kidding I know there's a lot of Other stuff going on tonight hey even I As well want to watch that Twin Peaks Reboot which started tonight but thankfully There's ways to do that online they got this Hulu thing the Amazon thing there's a lot of Ways to do that so I just have to figure out which ones gonna work For me and be watching that pretty Soon I'm really excited about that as I'm sure A lot of you guys are as well Any other shows I should be watching There's a lot of stuff Yeah Kimmy Schmidt season 3 I still need to Finish season 2 yes you do My wife quit in season 2 as well So I don't know I need to finish Sense8 season 2 As well I started it and I liked Well the Christmas episode was just basically The Christmas episode was practically like the VR thing we were talking about earlier With Christmas and New Years and it really Was the Christmas episode But I watched the first episode As well and it was good I liked it I liked the way it ended so I need to watch more Sense8 and even Shane is you know Bugging me about it he's like I'm gonna ruin it for you if you don't Finish it Crazy Ex-Girlfriend Is worth a watch yes absolutely I don't know that one so it's hilarious It's well written and they got musical Numbers in every show I mean it's Very it's seriously very well written The pilot episode has a song called the Sexy Getting Ready song okay Sounds good oh some folks in chat Suggesting the MST3K reboot Yeah Honestly though I've been kind of spoiled With Rift Tracks It's kind of hard to go back To that but I'll have to give it another try I watched the first episode of the Bill Nye Science show It was okay I hear he's a bit preachy though It's a little bit but I hope They give him another season I think it maybe just needs a little time to work out some of the kinks So I hope they give him another season But I liked it I just didn't love it A lot of Netflix shows I'm like oh my god These are so good It's not Netflix but it's Hulu Everybody is telling me fucking watch it Everybody is like fucking watch it But just be ready to just want to Cry for hours and hours After you watch the first couple episodes I guess there's like it's too real Have you read the book? No of course not I don't read a lot of books Books? Well it came out like 30 years ago So it's not new I had actually started it when I was in Middle school And had to put it down I haven't picked it up since I planned on going back I could read the Divine Comedy In middle school But yet that book hit me hard So I had to put it down I'm going to try to pick it back up and finish it For a book that was written in the 80s About current events and future predictions It's held up extremely well And terrifyingly so What was the other thing I was going to mention? Taking it with all these On demand things Let me go to chat I guess since I can't remember what it is Brad from Pod Culture says Gotham is okay I watched half the first season of that Okay is a good word to describe it Not watching any of the DC shit until Wonder Woman comes out I'm hearing the movie is getting good reviews Out the gate That's good But I also hear that it's the only good thing In their cinematic universe Well Unless we count the Nolan Batman movies Because I thought those were great I liked all of them Not even just the Heath Ledger one I liked them all Didn't they reboot that universe away though? Like they do every couple of years That was the Christian Bale one They were going to do a Batman with Batfleck But I don't know if that's actually happening or not Maybe? And Brad from Pod Culture does have a good point He says DC television is way better than the DC movies That also requires a time commitment That I would be taking away from At least I would be taking away from finishing Luke Cage and Iron Fist And Daredevil before Defenders comes out That's my problem TV TV is such a huge time Because I only give a shit about things that involve Jessica Jones I've heard that it's safe to skip Iron Fist And you're not missing anything I I've always liked Iron Fist and I read a good Bit of Iron Fist and Power Man In like the early 80's What I want to see Is a Misty Knight and Colin Wing series I want to see Daughters of the Dragon That would make me So happy So make it happen I remember what I was going to say about Hulu So I tried watching a show on Hulu Well Hulu does have the Golden Girls So we're thankful for Hulu for that But I tried watching a show that Shane or somebody thought I would like called Difficult People And I thought it was so Like I really tried to I watched a good like 7 or 8 episodes of it And I'm like this show is just not funny Like people It bothers me in shows When people don't Talk right That was the problem in Difficult People Was that they would talk about something And then it was like oh here's this completely Like side reference to a pop culture event That maybe 2% of America Is familiar with type of thing That's not talking to me Which I understand kind of why That type of show exists in that format It's like Family Guy in real life almost It's kind of like Oh so it's not bad funny the way that Seinfeld wasn't funny Yeah no no But then the other show This is the one that gets me And I swear I'll get back to video games But TV is important too Gilmore Girls is the other show I can't fucking watch Because of that I tried watching Gilmore Girls And people love Gilmore Girls And I tried watching it and I'm like People don't fucking talk like that It is driving me up a fucking wall The way they talk on the show Anyway sorry Jamie I had to get that off my chest Well you said Golden Girls Did you see Golden Girls Clue? Oh of course Like 2 people posted it to your wall Thank you for noticing yes 2 people posted it to my wall Which is I never Get mad and I never go and say Somebody else beat you to it because I go I'm touched that people Think of me when they think of the Golden Girls The only thing I have to say about Golden Girls Clue is Could they not Afford Estelle Getty's license Or likeness like what the fuck is up with that box art Like she doesn't Look right at all Who did Blanche do? In which room? In which room and with what Prophylactics Come on confide in me and chat says Binge the British version of Queer as Folk Oh years ago I saw it years ago I love all the Doctor Who references in that show Yes actually yeah Like when he's at the pub and his co-workers like Ex-dominate I think I watched that around the time that the Eccleston Doctor Who episodes are coming out And somebody told me that it was the same director And I was like after watching the British Queer as Folk I was like oh that's fucking obvious This guy is a total boner for Doctor Who What's his fuck Wrestle T Davies And then there was the American Queer as Folk Which was How many Good British shows get ruined when they're Americanized It was a thing that we had In the olden days ten years ago For representation And boy we've come a long way Let's just leave it at that I would say For British shows coming to America The Office wasn't bad But I love the British Office The Ma Na Ma Na scene Like cracked me up so fucking hard On the British Office like in just ways That TV here never makes me laugh that hard You know what else got fucked up? Being human I watched the shit out of that Out of the British version And then we got the US one and I tried to Watch the first episode and I was like no I can't But did you know that the first episode Of the Office in the US and the first episode of the Office in the UK are the same like script Like they might have done some Cuts because the commercials is different over there But like It's like the same script and I was like wow It's so different though But I think a lot of that is just the strength of Ricky Gervais Versus you know Why can't I think Steve Carell You know and just kind of like how they are Yeah that guy Alright we got to move on y'all Let's get back into some gaming news We're going to do some rapid fire news Yes so this is kind of an interesting experiment But you know Goes to show you can watch almost anything on Twitch So they have This cool Neural network Named Charles and what Charles does Is it's learning how to Drive I guess self driving Cars almost in Grand Theft Auto 5 so basically It's basing all the data off Of what it sees In the actual screenshots And everything to make its decision So you can actually watch it drive And Or drive poorly because that's Kind of what happens sometimes but It's pretty interesting so that's one thing You can check out on Twitch And then of course you know The user you'd want to look for Is Sentdex Is the guy that's hosting that so check that out Because it's kind of interesting I watched a few minutes of that and I was entertained And then Finally we're going to get A release date for South Park The Fractured But Whole That's going to be coming out in October So October 17th Is when it's going to be coming out And with that they have Released a new trailer which I Do need to watch and I do want to pick up the game Because the first one was awesome Do we think it will actually Come out? I think this time I think it's ready I hope so too And I know a lot of people are looking forward to that game And really I'm one of them I think it's going to be a good game By the way I have to answer this In chat because it's important Ragenator in chat says Speaking of Twitch I've heard that every episode of Mr. Rogers Neighborhood is coming to Twitch You're late to the party Ragenator It's been going on for a few days now actually We were watching The other night and I think we were in the Episodes from 1969 so it was in color They're probably in the early 70's by now But I mean that marathon Is going to be going on a while because Mr. Rogers That show didn't end until 2001 It was like 30 years worth of television It was a long time so they got a lot of episodes to go However I got to say Yes I've been watching some Mr. Rogers on Twitch And again chat Fucking makes it Kudos to the chatters who Make that an experience So are there any awesome memes coming out of this? No not really the same thing but it's like The type of stuff like when There was one episode he was doing He was doing like a seesaw He was weighing the fruit or something And when it balanced People were like Vak, Vak He's cheating and all this stuff Science, OMG The little emotes and all that People are really funny There's of course some of the Stupid shit that you would expect too Whenever Lady Abberline What's the real life lady That plays, not Lady Elaine The funky nose one Lady Abberline is her name or something Aberdeen? The one who's like Like his niece or something Yeah, yeah Maybe in chat, chat probably Knows it too, when she shows up Some toilet comments show up in chat But it's not like, it doesn't cross the line Like it's just like, you kind of Chalk it up to the whole like Lady Abberline Oh it's pervy dude At home or whatever Who is named Betty Abberline Everything is like their names It's funny because obviously I haven't Watched Mr. Rogers neighborhood in a very Fucking long time right But like many of you I watched it every fucking day When I was like 5 or 6 years old Picture picture is my fucking jam So all that stuff It's kind of fascinating to go back now And it's like The characters really talk like that Meow, meow, meow, meow, hello Meow, meow, meow, meow Adventure, meow, meow, meow I was like, how did that not drive me up a Fucking wall, but Isn't that how your cat talks? No, my cat Is meow, meow, meow, feed me I was like, mom Mom Alright Anyhow, sorry for the tangent We're back on TV That one's worthwhile cause they're raising Money for PBS I think at the end of the day I gotta say A fucking smart way to do it In this day and age You guys probably all remember back in the day When you would watch Mr. Rogers Then you'd have the telethon comes on If you send us $50 You'll get a free t-shirt or a free book Or a free VHS tape Of a night at the opera or something They would always have those telethons Like somebody at PBS And probably because of Bob Ross Okay, let's not It's because of Bob Ross Changed the fucking game at Twitch I'm sure now PBS was like, wait a minute We wanna do a fundraiser or something over there We get like 321 contact or something like that Fuck, Square One television Square One still hasn't been released On DVD They need to do something about that Can you imagine MathNet I'm gonna stay up For 72 hours straight when that happens I'll watch MathNet Didn't they release MathNet as a separate program At some point Like Friday Okay, here we go on TV again Friday would always be The extended MathNet episode There was only a couple Maybe they would have a MathMan In the very beginning The rest of the episode was MathNet Another really cool thing that PBS did To raise money was on YouTube They remixed certain themes like a year or two ago And those are Oh yeah, some of those are On the music feed They're amazing And Mr. Rogers has one too Mr. Rogers has one, I think Reading Rainbow has one And I think Julia Child has one Julia Child, love it Anyway, back to video games But the worlds are coming As Twitch is airing this stuff It's like our video game and TV worlds Are blending together Anyway, how would you like to buy a video game box For five dollars Yes, you can buy a video game box for five dollars It is the Nintendo Switch Splatoon 2 bundle Excuse me, hiccups If you can't afford the bundle Or perhaps you already own all the stuff Inside it But you just want to have a box For your collection You can buy one for 540 yen in Japan And I should stress This is on the My Nintendo Store in Japan It's not something they're doing here in the US There is no Switch inside No manuals, no boxes, no cords It's just the box The main box No little boxes inside of games or anything So you could also buy this to prank somebody Set it up for really Pranky eBay auctions Oh yeah, yeah Or I'm going to get Loki a gift On a future episode of OLR That's completely empty It's going to be a Splatoon 2 box And inside will just be a note that says I put all of your positive things About Nintendo inside this box And it's empty Those cartridges are so light that you wouldn't be able to tell if you lifted it up It's true The switches are pretty light as it is A lot of those boxes have instructions on the inside Have you looked inside the boxes? Oh yeah, the boxes, that's what they do now They do a one sheet print on the back And that's it But anyway Keep in mind, this box is the system box So it's not No, it's not the game box Alright, anyhow One other thing to mention about Speaking about Nintendo and so forth It's a Mario Kart 8 patch that came out You may have noticed that 1.1 version of Mario Kart 8 came out And it adjusted the time zone issue That we bitched about with the tournament thing last week So to be fair Nintendo fixed that, yay However, they also changed Inkling Girl's animation Apparently She was giving an animation I never really noticed this in her old animation But she was giving the Up Yours animation Which like Here is not super offensive Unless there's a finger coming out of it, right? But I suppose overseas In parts of Europe and so forth Yeah exactly, what she just did there That is a little more Hold your bicep and pump through your fist That's an insult It's the same as the middle finger basically Except if you're in Parts of Europe, namely England The two fingers Where they see the back of your hand That's right So in America your IQ is one In Britain your IQ is two That's how it works It's like one punch versus two punches That's how many licks you're gonna get Alright, so There it is Again, if you want to know why that animation changed That's because in another country It is not polite DarkSakura, what do you have for us before we get to release dates? Some stuff Actually one of the Switch games I've been mildly interested in Has been Arms Which would be why I'd want to get A Switch I think But they are getting a global Test punch event It's actually available right now Apparently on the eShop So if you want to see if you like it Test it! Punch it in the face! Arms Ok that sucked So also in other news We have the E3 2001 livestream plans For Sony Monday June 12th Is gonna be at 5pm Tuesday June 13th From 12pm to 6pm Live programming Wednesday June 14th from 12 to 6 And Thursday June 15th from 12 to 4 So you'd be able to watch it all There are quests to unlock Rewards and Different trailers To watch and the whole thing will also Be streamed on YouTube and Twitch Well good luck to my buddy Who I'm sure is going to be a part of this Who used to listen to OLR years and years ago And now does that stuff with Sony Yay! I'm sure he'll be in that That's what a lot of the companies are doing now When you can take your message direct to the people like that We know Nintendo is doing a similar thing with Treehouse Obviously Sony's got their thing going on We don't know of Microsoft Microsoft doesn't really have like a People team right now Like I know they have Major Nelson He's kind of like the face of Xbox and so forth I don't know, or am I mistaking something? Yes I know there's the MVP program And so forth but those folks Aren't really like on camera Or doing anything with that So Microsoft doesn't really, like who would host a Microsoft stream If they did something all day long I guess it would be Major Nelson But that's a lot for one person to do Beam? That's a good thought, that's actually a really good thought We see on Twitch TV We see a lot of the streaming from Heroes of the Storm championships Or League of Legends type of thing So sure if Microsoft wanted to do an all day long thing Beam would be a great place to do it for them To get some more eyes and accounts over there When they stream Their events actually normally They have it through Microsoft's own site They've got their Silverlight Plug in thing that they use Were they the ones that had Adam Sessler and Morgan Webb? Or is that Bethesda? That's Bethesda Bethesda, okay, my bad I thought somebody was using, yeah Bethesda was using them, so Microsoft's the only one that kind of Doesn't really do the same type of thing as the other companies Which you know, whatever works for them Alright Moving on, let's travel around the world and check out What you're going to be getting in stores this week A little sooner than E3, Loki We actually have a Wii U game coming out Darksiders WarMastered Edition Out on the Wii U Also Disgaea 5 Complete On the Nintendo Switch Embers of Murm On PC and Playstation 4 Impact Winter On PC Oh god, I'm going to butcher this But let's see, Utawari Rumono Mask of Deception on Playstation 4 And Vita Switch, finally coming out on PC Drive Girls on Vita Friday the 13th The game on PC, Playstation 4, and Xbox One Oh, some people looking forward to that That's pretty awesome, so that's coming out this week as well On Friday Still not going to be like the NES version Which I'm sorry, the NES version Gets a bad rap, it's not as bad as Y'all make it out to be Was it an action figure that you could buy that actually they had Yes Let's see, Get Even On PC, Playstation 4 And Xbox One Guilty Gear Xrd Revision 2 on Playstation 4 and Playstation 3 Rime on PC Playstation 4 and Xbox One Samurai Warriors Spirit of Sinata On Playstation 4 and PC And finally this week we're getting Ultra Street Fighter 2 The final challengers On the Nintendo Switch That's it Let's travel to Japan No really, let's go to Japan I'm gonna go Captain Spike over at Game Buoy just got back from Japan They did a great episode on that Princess Irene is on her way to Japan She left either yesterday or today I want to go to Japan But again, I'm worried Because I don't speak Japanese I know AkumaJP would help me out He's a great pal You'd actually be surprised the number of people Who do speak some English Oh yeah? I wouldn't want one person to have to worry about me For a whole trip while I'm out there It's a lot to ask one person Immersion is really good for our education I guess that's true Imagine if I could come back and I could actually pronounce Japanese release dates You should let me do them sometime We were gonna trade at one point but then something happened Oh you got pulled from the show for a few months And we never ended up switching You can take a semester of Japanese and you'd probably get A lot better with the pronunciation Education? I know right? Actually what's funny is that I am working on studying again To try to pass the First round of JLPT I think that's what I'm gonna do With the bidi fund I'm gonna set my bidi fund on Twitch So that once I get like $2,000 I'll go to Japan Funny that you mentioned There's a game, I think it's an RPG maker game That's on Steam that's about learning Japanese I picked it up, I just don't remember what it is We talked about that on the show once Is that the Fight Slimes Learn Japanese one? I don't think that's what it was called I know there was only 10 years ago I don't remember it because it's Somewhere by Steam library Good luck finding whatever game that was Yeah There is a game out there that Teaches you Japanese Alright And by the way I wouldn't really spend the bidi money Going to Japan, I probably buy new Microphones for our studio because I'm gonna Have to do that bidis or not pretty soon Alright anyway Let's travel around the world here to Japan And virtually we'll talk about What's coming out on the Playstation 4 We're getting back into some heavy releases now With all that Golden Week stuff that happened earlier in the month But we have Hyper Light Drifter Is making its Japanese release on the Playstation 4 this week On the 25th Summer Lesson Miyamoto Hikari edition And not to be confused with Nintendo's Miyamoto This is some other type of Education game I believe It is a Playstation VR game which I think is very interesting I'm not sure what it is You're learning about in this game But your instructor looks like A nice Japanese girl that you're Maybe it's kind of like immersion I like this shirt that she's wearing A yeah shirt with a shark on it It's cute anyway Miyamoto Hikari edition is out this week And then Guilty Gear Xrd Rev 2 Is also out in Japan This week as well That is all on the 25th On the 3DS this week Nothing, things are slowing down there On the Switch this week The Ultra Street Fighter release Is also making its way to Japan this week So you have that to look forward to And then lastly looking at the Vita for this week Sengoku Hime 7 Is out this week In a regular and a limited edition And Love of Love Emperor of Love That's a whole lot of love A limited edition on the Vita this week So check that out And those games, and I guess I didn't pick it up Or at least I don't see it in my life Learn Japanese to Survive Yes, oh I do have it Learn Japanese to Survive Hiragana Battle Is what I've got I have that one, I actually just bought the Katakana Battle Even though I read Katakana better than Hiragana I'll have to check that out That's the reverse for me Too many of the Katakana look similar to each other for me It's just because I've read too many labels Because if it's something that's Western It's in Katakana I still remember one of the first things I ever bought you Dark Sakura when we were first friends Was I bought you a Japanese copy of Harry Potter Do you know I still have it? Oh I would hope so It's on my shelf with the little jacket on it And it still has the insert in it where it explains what a crumpet is No seriously That's right The inner part goes through What different Foreign terms would be Jumper is used in the book Why didn't the American editions have that? Because we don't know what crumpets are Keep in mind The British one was Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone And they changed I have the British and the US one They changed a lot When you get further on Through the books, the last book is more Dead even Because I've read both of those two But still it's a lot of They actually shot like two different movies Yeah but really it was just scenes that Refer to the item Anyway I don't know why I Thought of that but you talking about reading Japanese Made me think oh remember that book It's because reading is fundamental Reading is what? What part of a lip sync don't you understand, Jamie? That part I'd like to keep it on please The same parts The same parts That was a choice Moving on, how about the UK Dark Saga On the What's today, the 21st? On the 22nd, Trackmania 2 Lagoon for PC On the 23rd, we have Steel Division Normandy 44 Why can't it be Normandy SR2? May 25th, we have Vanquish for PC Samurai Warriors Sanada Maru Oh it's the same game They just called it Spirit of Sanada For the PC one But it's PC and Playstation 4 And on the 26th Rime for Xbone PC and PS4 Stephanie That's it, alright Let's continue on with Dark Sakura However because she's going to take a dive Ain't gonna do it In case you are Why are you putting your phone number in your email? Did somebody put their phone number in the email? Yeah they did One of these days I'm gonna call you live on air We did that once On a really really early OLR We called somebody and it was so fucking awkward Cause that person was having a bad day You should just call my mom I'm not gonna call that number I would assume some people have it automatically In their work emails that they email us from Oh is it his signature? Yeah it might be but still Anyway I'm gonna call you Just say hey it's Rob Roberts what you doing? Hi baby How you doing? Well they didn't put a nickname in here so I'm just gonna call them Andrew Okay The email about the custom ITG machine last week reminded me Oh here we go again Here we go again Another week It's in the gate It's what this is The in the gate I've always kind of wanted to get an arcade machine I think Jamie said she has some And I know Rob has talked about it before Obviously space and funds are big hurdles But I'm also a little afraid of spending a bunch of money And then having a break and not being able to fix it I'm not completely inept with technology But I know enough to know that I know nothing Jon Snow Do you have any tips or suggestions as far as places that sell them Upkeeping machines etc? My dream would be to own a DJ Max Technica 3 machine I love that game so much And the Vita and phone Technica games Are merely serviceable limitations A custom DDR ITG machine Would probably be sweet too And there are plenty of other arcade faves I would enjoy having Thanks Andrew I will tell you this Dan and I have owned a number of games over history One of them was our original MAME cabinet That Shermie lived in We would pick up When we were putting a MAME in those We would just pick up Husks of old games And clean them up And actually Getting new arcade I'd say full working arcade machines Is not too far off than Getting pinball tables When Dan started He was actually helping A friend renovate Some machines and getting them working In exchange for our first pinball table Which We've had some Stinkers over time But working on them Taught Dan how to keep working on them You just don't do it until You do it But we've picked up machines on craigslist We got Our Gyruss And you've played our Gyruss Our Gyruss is in good shape All we had to do was fix a fuse in it So you're suggesting That maybe even though this person Knows nothing about arcade machines Admittedly I'm happy you referred to me in the email But the only arcade machine in my house Is a custom thing that Loki built That I haven't turned on in two years Because I think I unplugged something And I don't know how to fix it But at the same time I don't really use it a lot I've thought about it I was gonna say That was a bar top cabinet Kit that I bought I mean you can honestly just build one of your own But I just didn't want to cut all this shit out So really all it would take Is just Throw a computer inside Put a monitor on a computer And run MAME That's probably the cheapest Doing a Dance Dance Revolution cabinet That's gonna be fucking expensive and difficult Because either A, you're gonna have to build something yourself And most likely if you're gonna do that Just build some really nice pads Instead of actually having a whole cabinet Because it's gonna be a hassle To fit that in your house Or wherever you're gonna put it And then just It'd be probably cheaper anyway Back in the day you could get a third mix on the cheap And put anything in it But now they're all different hardware And people want that stuff to do that Here's something that's becoming, are we done with the email yet? Well not quite because I was gonna bring up another suggestion Okay I'm gonna bring on I actually know a subject matter expert on this Because I just texted him we're gonna bring on on this So in just a moment I was just gonna say there's A web show on YouTube Called John's Arcade Do you know who hosts that? John from Video Game Outsiders who used to be on All Games with us Back in the day Yeah right? Look what he's doing now And look what we're doing now I like to say that I like to watch His show because he does go into the guts Of the restoration He answers questions for people And I would probably say he's done a lot more renovation Than Dan and I have done He's learned a lot from his podcasting years That he's applying to his YouTube medium Yeah if I had a basement I would have an arcade Yeah Alright I'm gonna do a quick phone call here Okay So this might be somebody you want to say hello to as well We're actually gonna call her live on air So this is my pal Melody We're gonna take this call here And I warned her that this is coming through And she might have some people She said she's in the car That she's gonna take this call in the car Hi is Melody there? Hi Hi Hi Melody it's Rob Roberts Here at Orange Lounge Radio How are you my dear? I'm doing great how are you doing tonight? I am good and thank you for agreeing To come on last minute but you know sometimes we get emails Okay we get emails here on the show I don't know the answer to this question But I know somebody who does And this is what happened tonight is we got an email About and the question was about I want to get Can you paraphrase what was that question we got I want to own a DDR machine basically right? Yeah one of them was I want to own a DDR machine So I think we need to suggest something that's easy to maintain And relatively on the cheap So tell us a little bit about your home arcade Melody The one that keeps expanding Until we run out of space Which is now We started out with one DDR Solo 2000 That I'm with DJ Melvis right now And it was his And the board on it died It had a bad RAM chip So we have a friend who managed to hook a PS2 Into it so it runs off It's a giant PS2 essentially Then we stumbled Into a friend who was selling Para Para Paradise Which is the game how can you Brought that home Then went to California Extreme The gaming show and realized I love Dance Maniacs And wanted to own one And I got lucky in that I googled around and found one And then decided we wanted Another DDR machine So I hopped on good old eBay And discovered When I was looking for DDR Extreme I found Revolution X And we all went Oh, that would be fun to own So that came home from Indiana Then A special Revolution X And that's my friend Christine in the back We're all in the car right now Hi kids So Then we ended up Getting a friend's gauntlet Because he doesn't have space And then we decided we wanted Another DDR when a friend of mine Was talking to me about it So we currently have 3 DDRs, a Para Para Paradise A Dance Maniac, Gauntlet, and Revolution X All in one garage Even I don't know how you've And you've even gone so far as to Carpet your garage at this point Yes If I'm right don't y'all have a We have two disco balls now You almost Can't see the black light carpet now Because there's just so many machines in there One little sliver of carpet Wow It is turning out to be quite amazing And if I'm right don't y'all have a single Car garage? Yeah Technically it's a two car garage But you'd have to get really friendly with that second car They call it a two car garage But literally the two cars Are nothing else I know what you're talking about And trust me I feel your pain because we've got Two disco balls in my garage now And three arcade cabinets And I'm very jealous of that World Cup You know that's my baby And y'all are always welcome to come over and play anytime Okay so here's the thing I want to get answered for our emailer Now obviously when it comes to the money When it comes to the money I'm not going to ask how you afforded it Because that's nobody's business If y'all want something bad enough you save for it That's what it is So when it comes to the money you just have to save the money How did you know that what you were going to get was a good quality? It sounds like you took You had a friend of a friend Referral in a couple of those cases So you kind of knew that that was good But you did the eBay thing How did you know that you were going to buy something that was going to work? I asked a lot of questions In that case That was actually for the Revolution X For those of us who don't know what Revolution X is It's a 1990's Shooter game starring Aerosmith And it is fantastic Fantasticly bad But it is a lot of fun But I was Smart enough to kind of know what I was looking at I played it before once or twice Mel and Christine Have both played it several times So I asked them What should I be asking And just asked a lot of detailed questions When you can't get out To actually try the machine yourself It's important to know what you're looking at And just You're spending a lot of money on an investment They need to answer your questions If you're not comfortable with it, someone else is going to have another machine And you're going to be fine with that one I think that's some really solid advice Melody, I'm going to let you go Because obviously this segment Has taken like 10 minutes of our time now But I really appreciate you letting me do this to you last minute Yeah, not a problem Quite honestly, you know how to get a hold of me If they have more questions, I'm willing to answer Quite honestly, if any listeners have questions I'm willing to do what I can to help I mean, I'm not an expert By any stretch of the imagination But I've done this a few times now So if people have questions on what they should be looking for Or how to look for it I'm happy to help out Do you have a Twitter? I do have a Twitter What is my Twitter? anonymous There you go So you can get a hold of our direct You don't have to go through us You can reach out to anonymous directly And get your questions answered About DDR home ownership Thank you so much you guys Have a safe drive wherever you're going Have fun storming the castle Have a good dinner guys I did a quick search Bye, take care Did a quick search on eBay And every now and then you can find some pretty good deals Too bad it's in Washington I made a third mix It's missing the hardware But the pads and everything It's kind of torn apart But $167 for the whole cabinet What? Wow So I was like, fuck That's all I would want right there It's just the pads anyway It's a good deal, too bad it's in Washington Jump on that, ends tomorrow So if you're interested in the Washington area, there you go And let this be a lesson to anybody that knows me IRL It's not the Rolodex I hate, but it's the one next to that It's the little Rolodex in my head That's like, oh, so and so has this So and so does this And when I hear it, I'm gonna call you On a moment's notice Like I just called Melody There we go, anyway It was funny, I was thinking of Melody in terms of the DDR machines And all the stuff you said about pinball And all that's great, but I know Oh my god, when I hear all this, I'm like, Melody Owns the music game stuff Now I didn't know that they had a Revolution X And now I'm super jelly because I love That stupid game, because you can go And find like Steve Perry on the toilet The last time I was over There, we played Dance Mediacs And they had just got the Revolution X But the gauntlet is new and now The carpeting, they're really making an Arcade out of that, that's Mel's arcade You wanna talk about John's arcade, now you got Mel's arcade Competition on the west coast Dan and I had an off talk about Next time we look for another house Of maybe doing a three car garage So that he can have a place for the Mustang The Mustang's got paint on it now Get one of those insulated garages like I used to have At the other house, I know that place Got insanely hot, but with a swamp cooler That place would have been a great We had the tornado of doom That was great, anyhow Alright, last email, very long answer to that email But a good one As a follow up from last week, I neglected to specify That my headphones are used more for my mobile Devices than my computer and consoles This is from Robert M by the way Unfortunately by those standards, I really can't use Any of the sets that you recommend Coincidentally though, Ninja Sista and Pandelicious of Electric Sista-hood Began their show talking about Checking out Lucid Sound LS30 Set, as well as the manufacturer Set for Xbox One, I will definitely have to Try out the former for myself How funny, what a coincidence But yay, yay Electric Sista-hood I had the chance To go to this year's Anime St. Louis In St. Charles and Was excited to find out that the game room This year was set up by Tokyo Attack Who I'm sure Ron was familiar with I'm familiar with What's in Rhode Island? Yes, but they're all over the East Coast I've also laid out their ads for DerpyCon Funny FYI, I've done the DerpyCon Guidebook For like four years now If you're a music game fan on the East Coast, you know Tokyo Attack, you do Outstanding Japanese arcade games Mostly music rhythm and a surprisingly High representation of Konami machines Then again, being music games I got to play the WarioWare-like The Bishibashi I love Bishibashi They have that at Japantown in the arcade Is it the Original Bishibashi or the Bishibashi Special? I don't know what the difference is Okay And of course the Tea Table flipping game I'm also there Don't flip it unless you're playing it I like that sign Didn't stay as long as I probably should have But enjoyed wondering About seeing attendees' costumes Lots of Overwatch, of course Robert M That's it Great, awesome Thanks for the emails you guys If you want to email us in a future week Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to Participate To do those things Alright, we're going to be taking your calls Not only do we call out sometimes, but sometimes I'll call in over at OrangeLoungeRadio All one word on Skype But we'll get to those calls after some more news First off, Loki It's like this never ends, but You may remember It's been a big deal with the whole ZeniMax Oculus suit Well that's concluded, of course, with Oculus Owing ZeniMax some money So what's the next step? ZeniMax, of course, is going after Samsung Because Samsung Makes a device called the Gear VR Which is powered by Oculus Which is powered by profit for Bethesda, because they feel that it Fringes on their intellectual Property Is this the same thing? Bobby was talking a lot about VR stuff on his show tonight, he was talking about something where like There was a conversation that happened With like a former, and this whole lawsuit Is coming from a freaking conversation That happened between like a Former employee of a company It sounded like a stretch He described it much better than I could because Admittedly, do not follow all the VR Drama as much as he does, but you know Yeah, they're very litigious So hopefully, I'm wondering With this, if that's going to be More of a stretch, because it's like I don't know how much is really powered by Oculus I mean, because it's just It's just a damn image with It's a basic case There's no real hardware in the The device, so I don't know It might be a little bit trickier, but But they feel that they have precedent Based off the last Oculus Are they drunk with power now? Because what happened with Facebook Is that's what's happening? Dude, I get it That you're suing these people Let's see you put a VR device in If you're going to sue all these people over Your technology being used Let's see what this is going to be Are you going to sit on it? I just don't fucking care I mean, like Fallout VR might be cool, but I don't know Hey, like a Skyrim type of VR thing Might be really rad I'd be down with that too Alright, well let's move on to something else That I think a lot of us were down with And then it was suddenly gone Y'all know how Scalebound got cancelled, right? Microsoft was teaming up with Platinum Games to do Scalebound And it just got cancelled a couple months ago Which, unfortunately There's a variety of reasons why this could have happened It could have been because nobody in Japan Has an Xbox One and maybe Microsoft Has just decided they're not going to Continue to pursue the Japanese market, I don't know Or perhaps deadlines were not Being met, I don't know But, here's the interesting Again, these are rumors, but the interesting rabble rabble Going around right now is that this Project might not actually Be dead, but this is coming From the fact that Microsoft has renewed The trademark There are rumors in addition to that That are saying the teams are working On salvaging the project Possibly even Reworking it from the ground up Without Platinum being involved Talk about it Wouldn't Platinum's Logos still have to be on it? Because they kind of started the development And would own the name Scalebound? They wouldn't necessarily own it But they would be partial owners with it with Microsoft Right? Even though they might not end up Developing this game at all? I know, lots of rumors And who knows what, this could be a very If this shows up at E3 This is going to be a very Audible gasp type of moment During the presser I was all that hot on Scalebound to begin with I'd be like, yeah, that's neat I don't think I'd be Audible gasp Well, I mean, because there's going to be A lot of people that are like, whoa Platinum totally got shafted In that whole deal, so It's not like Platinum makes Stinker games, like Bayonetta, Bayonetta 2 Hello, those are like some of the best video games ever made Starbucks Oh yeah, that's right, Platinum did do that Well, okay, not everything's a winner They also did, I think it was Platinum They did Anarchy Reigns Which wasn't that great either Vanquish was good Whatever, not everybody's going to be Hitting everything out of the ballpark All the time After all, Rockstar did make Rockstar Table Tennis, but that's not necessarily A genre that I'm interested in Hi, Allen's back Hello, Platinum Games makes great Games, but they make great niche games That's their thing, they don't Really make games with mass appeal Which I'm sure a lot of people Love Platinum Games because They will do that good, weird shit But the rumor of like Is Platinum Games Studio going to Shut down because Microsoft totally Screwed them over with this Basically it's like Is this a sign That the studio is failing because They can't make a massive Blockbuster, but it's like that's Not what they do, like Bayonetta 2 Probably one of the best action fighting Beat em up games ever But it was made on the Wii U and even then If any fucking Wii U game Needs to be re-released, it's that Seriously, so Platinum Games is great, but they Just, they don't Because they're always looking for The new weird shit Maybe that's one of the things That Microsoft didn't like about them, they take too long And they're like, we don't know What you're doing with this, this is too weird for us Maybe that's it But I'm sure Platinum Games Is going to be just fine, there are rumors Very, very, very big rumors Of Bayo 3 With some things that showed up in the PC release And just the fact That Bayonetta deserves another game Even if the second game was on Wii U Nintendo may recognize that it's their own damn fault It didn't sell, and they may be back in the third one I was so happy when Bayonetta PC port showed up out of nowhere Because I thought, they have all the Devil May Cry shit On here, why don't they do Bayonetta, when it happened It's so awesome, but we'll never We will never get Bayonetta 2 On PC because Nintendo Paid every penny for that game So hopefully they're paying for a third game So I don't care, I want anyway But yeah, I realize it's not realistic A true internet gamer I don't care if it doesn't make sense I want it, and I'm going to be mad if I don't get it Alright, moving on Let's go to another story Dark Sakura Well this one made my heart sing You? Me, my shriveled little heart Inflated three sizes Basically There is a blind gamer Blind gamer in Japan Who sent Nintendo Yeah, there's the gasp That sent Nintendo a A letter, not asking for Nintendo's been known to replace Broken games and things When customers have been incredibly sad by it If their circumstances In particular The dad wrote out the letter From his son And I will Go ahead and read the letter Basically, the son's name is Hibiki And he has retinoblastoma In both eyes So he's been blind since he was two years old I'll read the letter Dear Nintendo, hello, my name is Hibiki Sakai And I am in fifth grade I am blind, but I've always wanted To play video games like everybody else But there aren't many games I can play at all The one game I can really play is Rhythm Tengoku For those who don't know, that's Rhythm Heaven It's the only game I can enjoy Together with others And I never lose at it I've gotten perfect scores on all the versions On the Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS, Wii And 3DS too So I really, really Want you to make more Rhythm Tengoku games And it's perfectly fine if you make them A little harder too I think that there are a lot of other kids with visual impairments Who want to play video games but can't So I'd love for you to develop more games For people with handicaps to enjoy playing with others I will always support you Nintendo From Hibiki Sakai So Nintendo replied First of all With a letter in Braille Which I thought was pretty neat And then a printed one I guess for Dad to read And so the response from that is Thank you so much for sending us here At Nintendo your heartwarming letter We're so happy to hear that you've perfected And enjoyed Rhythm Tengoku, Rhythm Tengoku Gold Mina no Rhythm Tengoku And Rhythm Tengoku the best We have passed on your letter to Nintendo's Development department We want to keep making games that everyone can have fun playing So thank you for your support So Also the kid plays the drums really well too Did you watch the video? I didn't watch the video He plays drums pretty well But yeah I just thought that it was neat Because there was another thing on here Where his dad said that He was going under surgery That will quote Be nothing but days full of pain and tears So that he can Hopefully regain some vision Or have his eyes taken care of But it's just You know we have some Some listeners Who have some visual impairment Others who Have you know All kinds of I would say Limited abilities In some physical aspects Be it You know like we were talking about vision Hearing, mobility Autism, hello You know other things And I think that it's great that Nintendo Took the time to respond to that Letter and acknowledge that There are people out there who play games Who may not be Your generally abled person So I thought it was really good No that's awesome And I really super love that they replied With a braille letter Well done Nintendo, kudos And also I Probably not going to hear this but I do hope Hibiki's surgery goes well Same Alright thank you for sharing that nice story DarkSarka Appreciate it Alright we just have a couple more stories for you guys So speaking of more VR stuff This is pretty cool So a I guess a Half Life 2 mod Or a Half Life 2 VR mod For the Oculus Rift and Vive Has been in the works since 2013 It just made its way through Steam Greenlight So hopefully that means It will be coming out relatively soon So having the project on Steam Of course will make it easier for them to develop So they're allowed to do this even though Half Life Isn't really their game I think so yeah, there's been other mods that have gotten Like Gary's mod is out there right Well Gary's mod, there's also Some Portal side story Stuff that they had that they released Granted those were free, I'm not sure if this Is going to cost anything when it comes out Maybe not, maybe it might be A free thing, so I don't know If you have Half Life or something like that Or a Valve game that you'll be able to play this Alright Well, unfortunately Ending on a not so great Note tonight, but I just want to take a minute to let You all know, if you didn't know That I guess this was on May 13th That this actually happened, but American voice actor John Sigan, I don't know if I said that right, I'm really sorry If I mispronounced that, but he passed away And he was more Probably known to you guys as an actor In the Metal Gear series He was Solidius Snake In Metal Gear Solid 2 Sons of Liberty, but he was also in Some other TV productions and so forth And he did Mafia 3, he was in that game As well, so Unfortunately We lost him this week, so rest in peace Alright, we're going to Move on to the Skype line Orange Lounge Radio, all one word On Skype is the place you can call us And we'll Take your calls, Orange Lounge Radio again All one word on Skype It is already lighting up in here Let's get to some calls and take some calls Oh my god Hi Orange Lounge Radio, who's this? Hey Zaku, long time I know, I know, the struggle Was kind of real, but it was only Because I finally Let's say, switched careers Well not so much switched careers, but switched jobs New phone, who dis? Yeah I'm starting a new job tomorrow So as a result, yeah I had to stay away from things like OLR for a bit Although you did see me in December When I was out on the West Coast Briefly Well what's on your mind tonight? Nothing much, other than the fact that Things like E3 is looming And the fact that I got Well, another one that I caught was like The fact that free to play Doesn't necessarily mean You know It doesn't necessarily mean That everyone's on the same page Case in point, I don't know If you read this article recently Where one YouTube streamer Basically got Threatened with a Strike on their account because Wargaming, the folks who make World of Tanks Didn't like the fact that they were That he was basically bashing Their New tank that essentially Played a win-grab That's designed to maximize The amount of profit You know, for these freemium games I really fucking hate When copyright holders, and this is a problem I put this squarely on YouTube Honestly, for having this system set up in the first place But I hate when copyright holders Kind of abuse that to Try to strike down, you know, things that are Critical, and that's what it is It's a criticism, and it's not like Unfounded criticism either It's, you know, like you say Potentially a play to win type of situation And people have a right to kind of know about that Just like, you know, when Siskel And Ebert use a clip from a movie To drive home the point that this movie might be kind of Fucking terrible, then Obviously I'm dating myself using that reference But you know what I mean, those names live on And mean any movie reviewers That are out there, they use a clip And they might be critical of it The movie people aren't like, well we're Gonna fucking sue your show, and You're never going to be able to review our movie again I'm sure somebody's tried that, but it doesn't Fucking work, because, you know, We have, that's why we have fair use laws To be able to comment on that stuff But on the other hand, to be fair This one, he was part Of a particular program That gives said people Insider access to upcoming DLC If they want to kick him out of the program, fine But he has every right to say, I got Kicked out of the program because I Went against the grain, and I wouldn't True, but at the same token The reason why they're after him in particular Is because of the fact that he actually Cursed him out in a YouTube video Like he cursed out Wargaming He essentially He essentially bit the hand that Fed him Well, now when we're getting into the level Now when we're talking about unprofessionalism Yeah Now, okay, now my opinion starts to sway A little bit, is that okay, well If you're unprofessional, then yes, you were gonna Get kicked out of the club. However I would still say he has A right to be critical, but you Have to expect that if you're unprofessional In the way that you do it, you're gonna get kicked Out of the special club, and you're not gonna be able to Get some of those perks But they also copyright strike his videos too Did they end up doing that? See, that's a low blow in my opinion Yeah, they did that Just because of the fact that Even though, yes, you have a right to criticize You know, under copyright law You have the right to criticize something Something copyrighted, but whether or not Like he's violating any Any NDA or any type of Agreement that he signed as part of joining The contributors program, that's probably where they're They're trying to Protect that copyright, in addition to Also protecting their brand by not By trying to essentially Not associate their brand With someone who essentially You know, uses F-bombs to You know, to make their point about Something, to vent their frustration But not do it in a very professional manner And they don't But they don't owe him a goddamn thing And that's important too And I say that to anybody That's trying to get into this medium The YouTubes, the Twitches, the podcasting And all this stuff, and this is one lesson We've learned over the past 15 years Not that I ever think we were guilty of committing it But one thing, you know, I gotta let you all know Is, you know, nobody Owes you a goddamn thing You're gonna have to work for it, you know And that's what it boils Down to at the end of the day, when it comes to Viewers, when it comes to Free products, when it comes to Getting into E3 and all this stuff Nobody fucking owes you shit And you're gonna have to really work and prove And that's Where people sometimes get into a tricky Tricky area, because some people Are like, I wanna be in the circle I wanna be somebody that's gonna be Recognized, so I'm gonna be a mouthpiece For these organizations and I'm gonna Say everything that they wanna hear Because I wanna be accepted, I wanna be loved And I wanna go to all these parties But then you're kind of, you know Losing, so it's like It's a really tricky Balance you have to do Where it's like, you can be nice To your, and you can be Professional, this is where this guy went wrong As he was unprofessional, you can be nice You can be professional to all that, to these companies But at the same time, you kinda owe it to your You owe it to your audience To be honest Yeah, and unfortunately He basically, the way he went about it He had, I mean His criticisms were very Fair, I have to give him that But the way he went about it And the fact that he threw his You know, he threw Wargaming Under the bus, especially if they provided Him with something that wasn't even out yet This was like upcoming Like this DLC was essentially You know, not even released to the public And that's probably why they're going after him Well, okay, now Okay, now, see, now the But why give it to him then? Why give it to him If they didn't want him talking about it? Well, but here's the, if the DLC wasn't Released yet, and he put that on YouTube But now we're in slippery slope But they wouldn't have done that If he talked favorably about it Yeah, I still Think it's a dick move On Wargaming's part, and this is a bigger Issue, for that part But really, this guy should have just been Professional to begin with I think the copyright strike is a bit far But this is, at the end of the day, this is all Fucking YouTube's problem This is a YouTube culture that YouTube's created And YouTube's bots have created this problem And YouTube refuses to fucking fix it Right, and I mean Like, I guess what he I guess where Wargaming draws the line Is that, you know, they're saying Quote, you know, there's a level of toxicity Under offensive language that is Unacceptable, even though they're more than Willing to give members of their community Second chances, but things like The fact that, you know, he's more than Welcome to make those types of Wargaming-related Videos, but, you know, they're really Drawing the line about things like hate Speech, homophobic slurs Things like that, and the fact that he Were, you know, cur- Oh, I see, they were trying to curb their extremely Profane language of a member Of our contributor program So, okay, so he used Like, homophobic, so he used trash language Basically Okay, do you Here's, this is important, do you know who uses Trash language? Trash people Okay, so Look, here's the thing He has a right to say all that shit Fine, whatever, but I have a right To fucking block his channel And I'm not gonna be fucking watching it anytime soon At the end of the day, though, I would say In light of all that, I would still say It's a little bit of an Overreach on their Part, but I do understand It's DLC that's not out yet, so it's Kinda like one of those, this Gets into very slippery slopes, but this Is for YouTube to work out With a real fucking human being That YouTube probably doesn't have staffed Anyway, Zaku Zaku, I gotta wrap up and let you go so we can get to other calls But thank you, thank you For that onion of a story, it was like every time we Peeled back, there was another fucking lair Alright, as the world turns Alright, take care, Zaku Bye, alright It was good to hear from him, it's been a very long time since we've heard from Zaku Let's see if there's any last minute stories Real quick, and we'll probably wrap up soon But I will take another shot for calls here OrangeLawnsRadio on Skype So they're not sure where that leaked from But it doesn't have any subtitles or anything like that It's all in Japanese, but Check it out, if you're interested Okay I got one Did you see, they've announced a Switch package for Splatoon 2 that's in Japan and Europe with different colored Joy-Cons Oh yeah, because it was All part of that, did they mention the Arms director, I know there was the trailer It was mentioned in something But yes, I did see the additional colors And I am really wanting that And it hasn't been announced for North America And I'm a little upset about that Well, it's a good thing the Switch is region free, right? Yeah, so that I can import a Switch's Joy-Cons Yeah, it would be expensive It's an expensive hobby I just hope they announce it here They probably, E3 is coming right around the corner, they might But at the same time, it's like, oh god I don't want to get into the territory of buying $40 controllers just because they're in different colors That's Shane's department, that's not something I want to do That's why I'm waiting until they're in different colors So they're $80 A set of two So they're $40 each Oh my god, no And you thought the pro controller was bad at 70 No! That HD rumble got paid that Nintendo price I like the all grey It matches Look, I will admit when I saw the yellow ones That they're doing for Arms, I was like, ooh those are pretty But $80, nope That just shut that off That's fine They're struggling color joy cons with specific games Since they've announced that Arms is the yellow, Splatoon is the green And Fuchsia, what if they do that? Well, do you remember those early rumors About the Switch that there may actually be Different types of joy cons That go in the Switch Do you remember some of those early rumors that there might be a GameCube controller That they'll use for Smash Brothers? That would be fucking interesting Having played with the pro controller for a couple months now I don't feel like I need The GameCube controller for Smash I know that The Melee community is still going strong There are going to be people who are going to stick to it But I think for the majority of gamers It's not like on the Wii Where the classic controller Didn't really feel the same I think the pro controller can hold up Alright, well you know what is getting kind of late I'm sorry to those guys who didn't get through on our Skype line But we're going to shut it down for the night Just so we can wrap up Because it's a little bit after 9 o'clock here Thank you guys for listening to the show tonight I want to thank you guys as always for tuning into And supporting Orange Lounge Radio If you like what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio Please consider leaving us a review on iTunes Or wherever it is you heard this show A nice 5 star review goes a very, very, very long way And of course, tell a friend about the show This is all about word of mouth We don't have a YouTube series Or anything like that to promote the show We do have a Twitch affiliate channel now We're getting there, we're moving on up Look out John's Arcade, I'm coming for your subs Just kidding, alright No, in all seriousness, indie stuff No matter where it is Really grows thanks to you guys So, JD Thanks for being here again tonight Appreciate it, always nice to have you here Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

So, one thing about this You know, office space idle clicker game Is they have this little event stuff that they do Where you earn like these in-game currency type things But The in-game currency, each one of them gives you A 10% bonus, but the bonuses That you can also buy with that currency Are actually less than if you just didn't spend them Which doesn't make any goddamn sense So who the fuck programmed this shit because they're a fucking idiot That's all I have to say about that It's a good thing Loki didn't have a YouTube channel Alright I do, I just don't post anything on it There's a reason, alright, no I'm kidding That's gonna do it guys, we will be back in 7 days Yes, Memorial Day weekend, we will still be here Nobody's going out of town, right?
