7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	17000	Regaining those powers of being in public is almost a year after its inception.
17000	21000	Pokemon GO may finally include the original 151 if five choice words are a clue.
21000	24000	This summer may be legendary, but tonight will be packed with the latest gaming news.
24000	27000	And it all starts right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
27000	32000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	37000	Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37000	44000	It's Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode number 688 for this May the 28th of 2017.
44000	50000	My name is Rob Roberts, here with you in studio with you guys in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com
50000	55000	where we do tape live Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at the Voice Geek Network.
55000	61000	And right after the Bobby Black Wolf Show, I am joined in studio with DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
61000	62000	Oh, hi.
62000	65000	Hi, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. How are you today?
65000	67000	I've got a shot of rum in me.
67000	73000	Yes, it is a three-day weekend here in the States. As I learned, it's a three-day weekend in lots of places this weekend.
73000	77000	But here in the States, we're honoring Memorial Day, which is Monday.
77000	82000	So, of course, a moment to remember those who have, you know, passed away.
82000	83000	Died.
83000	89000	Defending our right to free speech and being able to be here and, you know, among many, many other things, of course.
89000	93000	Well, yes, including the ones who fought for us that we never fought for them.
93000	100000	Yes. Yes. So, a moment for that. And, you know, that does make things a three-day weekend here in the States.
100000	102000	Which in America, it means that you sell cars and drink.
102000	104000	Yes. So, and barbecue.
104000	105000	And barbecue.
105000	108000	And travel, usually. We didn't travel, though. We're all here.
108000	110000	I traveled to your place.
110000	115000	We may be partaking in a little bit of the alcohol tonight. Which, speaking of which, hi, Tech Master Loki.
115000	116000	Hello.
116000	117000	How are you?
117000	118000	I'm fine.
118000	119000	You're three shots in, aren't you?
119000	120000	Yes, I am.
120000	121000	Do you enjoy libations?
121000	126000	Unfortunately, that is the max I can have in order to be sober by the time the show ends.
126000	129000	The three shots are three hours, I understand. But you're feeling pretty good.
129000	130000	I'm feeling great now.
130000	132000	Great. He's ready to roll.
132000	133000	I'm ready to do this.
133000	135000	We should get him started. So, Nintendo.
135000	137000	So, what about Nintendo?
138000	143000	I was going to ask if you tried the test punch, but you can't. You don't own a Switch. So, I don't know.
143000	146000	What do you think of ARMS, when you look at that stuff?
146000	152000	I think it's a game. I mean, I just, I think they're trying to really force it to be like an esports game.
152000	160000	Which, you can't really force that. You have to have it be popular first in order for it to actually be something that people would want to play for esports.
160000	164000	But they're like, no, it's esports. It is. Make it esports.
164000	173000	I mean, so it's just, it's a little force. I mean, it looks like a fun game. I just, I don't know. I played esports boxing and it seems kind of similar to that.
173000	175000	It's just, I don't know. Whatever.
175000	179000	It's one of those things I feel like I really can't accurately judge until I get my hands on it.
179000	182000	Which is why I'm really excited that they're doing this test punch this weekend.
182000	187000	Except for the fact that, because it's so limited, I have not been able to play it yet.
187000	191000	I've been doing other things each and every time that they had that hour open.
191000	195000	Well, I wasn't going to get up at 5 AM, let's be real. But still, you know, I just, I've been busy.
195000	198000	So I'll do it next weekend. I have more availability next week.
198000	201000	I worry that the game will get boring pretty fast.
201000	202000	Yeah?
202000	203000	I think that it's going to be kind of-
203000	206000	It seems like there's a lot of different modes and things, but you know, I don't know.
206000	211000	It seems like there might be more to it than say Ultra Street Fighter 2.
211000	216000	Which, you know, I have such mixed feelings on that whole thing because I get it.
217000	222000	Street Fighter 2 is such a legendary game. It is, you know, one of the most important video games.
222000	226000	Well, you know what? They should do a crossover with ARMS. They should have Delcime in there.
226000	228000	Anything's possible.
228000	240000	But no, with Ultra Street Fighter 2, it just stings a lot that this isn't that different from the HD remix that came out 10 years ago.
240000	242000	And they're charging $40 for it.
242000	243000	Yep.
243000	248000	And I get the whole fact that it's cartridge and all, but it's just, dudes, you gotta give me something more.
248000	251000	And this whole first person, blah-di-blah, that's not it.
251000	257000	That's like that throwaway game that you shoved into a Wii thing because you had to have motion control somewhere in it.
257000	263000	Like, Street Fighter 2 is strong enough to stand on its own, but maybe, you know, it could have been some more characters.
263000	267000	Or it could have been, you know, maybe HD-er, more HD-er.
267000	270000	Or just don't do, or don't necessarily do Street Fighter 2.
271000	275000	Do a different Street Fighter game. Here's a crazy idea.
275000	280000	Come up with a brand new Street Fighter game, but just include characters from the 90s games or something like that.
280000	284000	Oh, hey, we're gonna have, well, maybe not 90s, early 2000s as well.
284000	288000	So, you know, Street Fighter 2 and 3 characters and some other characters here.
288000	291000	And it could all be in that Street Fighter 2 style.
291000	295000	I mean, I guess they'd have to do the balancing and stuff, but just get all the 2D characters that they have.
295000	298000	Was there any character, and Jamie, you know these fighting games better than I do.
298000	306000	Maybe Chad knows. Were there any fighters in Street Fighter 2 and 3 who didn't show up in 4 in the numerous expansions?
306000	311000	I mean, by the time they got to the end of Street Fighter 4, that roster was gigantic.
311000	317000	They didn't even just have Street Fighter characters. They had Final Fight characters.
317000	321000	They had, I mean, they had a lot of different stuff in Street Fighter 4.
321000	324000	I'm thinking about it. Did we have Sodom? No, he was there.
324000	325000	Yeah, he was there.
325000	326000	Let's just put it this way, okay?
326000	327000	Juni and Julie.
327000	328000	Elena.
328000	329000	Karin.
329000	331000	Yeah, I feel like they were all there.
331000	334000	So here's what I want to know. Why they went back to Street Fighter 2...
334000	335000	Dudley.
335000	337000	Didn't Dudley show up? Maybe not.
337000	339000	And Steve.
339000	344000	Why did they go back to Street Fighter 2 when they went, like, they did Street Fighter 4 3D on the 3DS?
344000	347000	I mean, clearly, the Switch should be able to run Street Fighter 4.
347000	348000	Yeah.
348000	352000	Why wouldn't they just do, like, one of those games? I don't understand what the point was.
352000	358000	Well, see, if they'd done Street Fighter 4, then people would be giving them shit because you just did this on the 3DS.
358000	361000	You know, it would kind of be the same line, so I kind of get...
361000	363000	I don't know if they would do that, but, I mean, it's...
363000	367000	Whatever. I just don't think it's justifiable for the $40 points.
367000	369000	Okay, I know what they could have done.
369000	372000	And Capcom has done an awesome job at some of these lately.
372000	375000	So they did their Mega Man collection, which is cool.
375000	380000	That Disney morning collection with a lot of games that people love and some that weren't so...
380000	382000	Kill the ROM hex. The Street Fighter ROM hex.
382000	386000	Well, no, but do a 90s fighting game collection.
386000	390000	And do these. They put Street Fighter and Dark Stalkers.
390000	394000	Well, Capcom X-Men's probably going to be a little harder to get all those licenses.
394000	398000	But at least, you know, those and maybe Capcom SNK?
398000	400000	I don't know what else they could probably pull out.
400000	404000	I mean, they might have to go to, like, Street Fighter EX or something that was a little...
404000	406000	I would love to see a new Capcom SNK game.
407000	411000	Oh my god, I would love a good Street Fighter EX because Skullabania.
411000	413000	But, I mean, you know, why not at least maybe...
413000	414000	Rival Schools?
414000	417000	Okay, yes, thank you. Rival Schools.
417000	422000	And put them in the collection and now that's going to justify a lot more of that $40 price tag.
422000	424000	Yeah, I think that's a little bit more worth it.
424000	427000	Or just not even maybe necessarily all fighting.
427000	429000	You can just do a 90s arcade collection.
429000	433000	Sure. Oh man, Capcom had some killer arcade games in the 90s.
433000	437000	Y'all know I love Quiz and Dragons and it's 90s-riffic.
437000	444000	Although, Capcom did do an arcade collection on PS3, I think.
444000	448000	Because I seem to remember, yeah, I seem to remember they had, like, different packs in that.
448000	450000	And I think it's on...
452000	455000	What's PlayStation's streaming service? The PlayStation Now thing.
455000	456000	You can actually play it through that right now.
456000	458000	So they had, like, five different packs.
458000	461000	But I don't think Street Fighter was in there.
461000	467000	It was more, they went a little more, I don't want to say the B-cuts, because it did have, like, ghosts and goblins.
467000	469000	You know, some of those, you know, classics.
469000	473000	But there were a lot, it was a lot of B-cuts for filler stuff.
473000	479000	I just think that a lot of this price point stuff has to do with the fact that all the other games are kind of that price point.
479000	483000	And it's like, well, we could make our game cheaper, but what else are you going to buy?
483000	486000	Because they're all $40 or $60.
486000	487000	Nah.
487000	489000	I mean, like, Minecraft. I mean, come on.
489000	495000	Minecraft, I get it. It's Minecraft and they've charged, you know, quite a bit of money on all the different console versions.
495000	499000	But, dude, it's been out forever on all the other platforms.
499000	502000	And I hear people say, well, it's because the Mario DLC's in there.
502000	505000	The Mario DLC was free, by the way, for the Wii U version.
505000	507000	I've never picked up a DLC pack.
507000	513000	Okay, but that was to justify people buying the Wii U version years after 360 and PlayStation 3 had it.
513000	516000	Well, this is years after the Wii U version, so what do we have to say about that?
516000	521000	Well, no, that's true. Well, the fact that it is portable and console.
521000	527000	If you think about it, this is the first time that the portable version has been so rich, if that makes sense.
527000	532000	Well, if I wanted a portable console version, I could get the Vita version and play it on my PlayStation TV and play it on my Vita.
532000	536000	Alright, fair enough. I forgot about the Vita version. I forgot they released it on the Vita. Fair enough.
536000	538000	I think a lot of people forget about the Vita.
538000	540000	Well, a lot of people forgot about their Vita, period.
540000	542000	Yeah, they'll have a Vita? What's this?
542000	546000	That's on Sony. I mean, the Vita's still healthy in Japan.
546000	551000	I honestly mean, the Vita is maybe just a little bit before it's time.
551000	559000	Because look at how well the Switch is doing. I mean, how hard would it be for them to adapt the kind of Switch-like platform for the Vita?
559000	562000	Not to keep going tangent to tangent.
562000	563000	Sorry.
563000	565000	No, no, no. It's good.
565000	569000	Oh, I forgot what I was going to ask. I should have started drinking for the show.
570000	577000	Something about the Vita. Oh, this whole PlayStation VR and the way Sony supports hardware.
577000	585000	I was just having this conversation the other day that I kind of want to get a PlayStation VR because I think the 3D Blu-ray thing is really awesome that you can do.
585000	586000	I haven't done that yet.
586000	590000	I want Rez. I want Thumper. You know, there's a fair amount of games.
590000	596000	But I'm worried about what does the next year look like for PlayStation VR?
596000	600000	I'm a little worried Sony's going to abandon it like they do most of their hardware stuff.
600000	603000	I don't think they're going to abandon it, but we don't know a whole lot of stuff what's coming out.
603000	606000	Yeah, there's no real big AAA games on the horizon that have been announced yet.
606000	609000	Now E3 is in two weeks, so that could change everything. I get that.
609000	614000	I think it's a pretty strong platform. I'm worried that they're going to do a hardware revision before anything.
614000	620000	But it's fun. It's just right now it's being driven mostly by indies.
620000	625000	I mean, really the biggest AAA title they have on there I would say is probably Resident Evil.
625000	629000	That's more the most fully featured game. And then Farpoint is another one that's kind of...
629000	634000	I don't know if that's more of an indie game, or at least the developer.
634000	640000	I'm not sure if it's a AAA developer, but they're backing that with its own peripheral and stuff.
640000	642000	So obviously that's a pretty big deal.
642000	648000	And in fact Bobby kind of echoes that in chat, pointing out Farpoint and Star Trek Bridge Crew as well as being pushed.
648000	650000	I'm a little worried about the Bridge Crew game.
650000	657000	I don't know. I mean, that's Ubisoft. Ubisoft likes to say everything is big, just like a stupid eagle flight game and all that.
657000	659000	I'll try it. I mean, don't get me wrong.
659000	664000	I mean, that's fine. But I think even with what's on the platform right now, there's a lot of good stuff on there.
664000	668000	There's also a lot of crap, because there are people that will produce like,
668000	673000	oh hey, I really want a rollercoaster game on the PlayStation VR.
673000	676000	Then they made a rollercoaster game and it's just absolute shit.
676000	679000	And so you just have to be careful. But there is a lot of good stuff out there.
679000	682000	Let me get some of these other comments in chat where I'm going back a little bit.
682000	685000	Dar Tetsuya talking about the price of Street Fighter, saying,
685000	689000	If I had to switch, I'd probably wait till Holiday. 40 is a bit much, but 20 to 30 wouldn't be as bad.
689000	692000	At least what I hear the online is actually good at it.
692000	695000	Act F pointing out that Dudley did appear in Street Fighter IV.
695000	700000	Sorry, in all honesty, it's been a long time since I've played Street Fighter IV and I just don't remember.
700000	704000	It starts to blur together after a while, but thank you for pointing that out.
704000	707000	Orange Wright points out though that R. Mika isn't in Street Fighter IV.
707000	709000	So, Street Fighter IV didn't have everybody.
709000	714000	Rama pointing out that the license expired on rival schools, so that could be why.
714000	719000	But it's not that licenses can't ever be renewed for these types of things either.
719000	724000	I mean, you know, we have a new Marvel vs. Capcom game coming out, although it may not have X-Men in it.
724000	729000	We'll find out, but you know, whatever. I mean, these things can be figured out.
729000	732000	The Disney collection is going to be a bunch of licenses, right?
732000	736000	They got that out, so, you know, anything's possible.
737000	738000	Yeah.
739000	744000	Well, and also if you look at even the character roster that they have for the new LEGO Marvel game,
744000	749000	it's quite interesting because it's not really focused on the Avengers this time, it's Guardians of the Galaxy.
749000	756000	And so they've got some other stuff in there. They have Spider-Man 2099, Spider-Gwen or whatever.
756000	764000	So, I mean, imagine those type of characters in, like, a Marvel vs. Capcom game. That'd be pretty cool.
764000	767000	Two tangents from that. This is a tangent edition of Marvel.
767000	768000	Sorry, it's the alcohol.
768000	772000	No, I love it. It's my fault. Okay, so, uh, Guardians of the Galaxy.
772000	776000	Dar Sagar, did you hear the ride open to Disneyland at five hour wait times?
776000	781000	Yeah, I know. I'm iffy on it. I mean, it's one of those things where I can't change it.
781000	788000	It's done, what's done is done, so, you know, maybe it'll be a decent ride, you know, that lives up to the twilight.
788000	792000	See, now, would you feel so terrible about it if they replaced it with a Tron ride?
792000	799000	Oh, god, no. No, I would've been like, Twilight Zone, thank you. You know, your monumental franchise, what you did was important,
799000	804000	and I hope they leave a piece of you in Disneyland, but make way, bulldozers. Let's go, let's go, Tron. Tron time.
806000	812000	Ironically, Electronica used to surround the Tower of Terror, so it was kind of like you had this odd...
812000	813000	No.
813000	814000	Kinda.
814000	816000	It was over by Monsters, Inc.
816000	817000	But that's, like, right next to each other.
817000	819000	No, Tower of Terror was further down the road.
819000	823000	But remember, Electronica kind of spilled out that way because they had all the venues.
823000	833000	But it didn't go as far as over there, it was only right in front of where the Aladdin Theater was, and the Monsters, Inc. ride over in that corner where the arcade was on the back wall.
833000	836000	But the Aladdin Theater is next door to Twilight Tower of Terror.
836000	841000	No, it's not. Well, the whole, it's a big building, but the entrance to it is quite a walk away from it.
841000	842000	Okay.
842000	844000	Visual memories kicking in.
844000	850000	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I just, I thought it kind of spilled over that way a little bit. I mean, it wasn't like it took over the Tower of Terror, but anyway.
850000	859000	So that was one thing. The other thing I wanted to say, because you brought up Marvel, one of the things I am looking forward to at E3 is, what's this whole Square Enix Marvel game?
859000	860000	Yes.
860000	862000	Because I imagine we're going to see more of that.
862000	863000	I'm down with whatever it is.
863000	873000	And, you know, seeing that this is probably going to be, I guess, have similarities to Tomb Raider just based on where it's coming from, from Square Enix.
873000	878000	Or, let's imagine a fighting system with a Marvel character that's like Final Fantasy XV.
878000	879000	Uh-huh.
879000	881000	Yeah, I'd be on board with that.
881000	886000	Bobby Blackwolf says, the Square Enix Marvel game is Kingdom Hearts 3. That's why we haven't heard anything about it.
886000	887000	I'm...
887000	888000	We have heard about it.
888000	895000	You know, I'm, the problem with Kingdom Hearts 3, like for me, like, is I never really played through the original Kingdom Hearts, and now I don't even know where to begin.
895000	898000	I know they have all the collections, but my God, it's like so much content in there.
899000	905000	And the story is just so convoluted that I don't know if I'd be able to enjoy the game to the fullest extent if I don't understand what the hell...
905000	908000	And I don't know who any of these characters are, so we're okay.
908000	910000	No Sora's in there somewhere.
910000	913000	I mean, I don't know what the fuck has happened throughout all this.
913000	920000	Well, did you hear this week that they have delayed Kingdom Hearts 3 and the Final Fantasy VII remake again anyway?
920000	921000	Shock and awe.
921000	922000	I know.
922000	934000	Well, I mean, well, I shouldn't say they delayed because they never really got a date announced, but they're just basically saying, y'all need to temper your expectations going into E3 because these games aren't being, like, they're not coming out this year, so sit down.
934000	935000	It's eventual.
935000	946000	Yeah, they'll be out when they're damn good and ready, which I respect that, you know, we have to respect that there's games that have needed to be delayed that didn't, so we need to stop treating game delays as like bad news.
946000	953000	But at the same time, we need to stop hyping the fuck out of these early release dates when they never, game companies never hit them.
953000	955000	But anyway, I digress.
955000	971000	I'd be curious what Square Enix is going to be focusing on at E3 if these two games are not coming, and maybe this Marvel thing, although I thought this was really early on still, and I wasn't pegging this as something that would be this year, but I suppose you never know.
971000	981000	But I figured Dragon Quest XI could be the game that's, you know, maybe they're going to really push for Dragon Quest XI this year to be something that's big in the US, too.
981000	993000	I mean, Dragon Quest has always had a fandom in the US, it just hasn't been on the same level as Final Fantasy, but, you know, Square Enix has had enough faith to put out Dragon Quest Heroes and, you know, some of these side things.
993000	1003000	The Builders game was a surprising amount of fun, you know, they've been trying to build up the Dragon Quest stuff a little bit to maybe get people hyped a little more about XI, who knows.
1003000	1013000	So, alright. Anyway, let's get into the kickoff topic I had scheduled after we have 20 minutes of tangents. No, it's fine. It's going to be one of those shows tonight, it's fine.
1013000	1025000	I want to talk about this article that's going around about Nintendo's Summer of Play Tour. Nintendo's going to be taking a Play Nintendo event around to showcase games to the public.
1025000	1034000	And I'm assuming this is probably a little miniature version of their E3 booth that they're going to take around the country, and this is what they're doing instead of a Best Buy type thing this year.
1035000	1046000	Including, let me see if I can get some dates here. So, Irvine from June 9th to 11th at the Irvine Spectrum. Well, that's now, that's like right concurrent with E3, isn't it? 9th through 11th?
1046000	1053000	Yeah, that's right, that's right, the same weekend because Bethesda's thing is the 10th. So, that's where it's going to start, is the same area, Irvine, right?
1054000	1066000	Then it moves to Pleasanton and moves on into Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Arizona, more Southern California, no Northern California, but it's going to be traveling around the country from June to September.
1066000	1069000	Pleasanton's sort of Northern California.
1069000	1075000	Yeah, but not here. No, I guess Alameda County Fair is close enough, I guess, but still, it seems like such a drive.
1076000	1090000	Anyway, but anyway, it's going to be in Chicago and Brooklyn and Pennsylvania, but all these places. So, it's traveling around the country, and I'm sure there will be people that will travel, you know, hours and hours to check this thing out.
1090000	1098000	I mean, you know, if we do want to go to Pleasanton, we could drive for a few hours and go check this out. I don't, I don't know if I will. It depends what games are showing.
1098000	1106000	Depends what they're showing, but I don't know if I will because I'm just the type that's like, I'll just be patient and wait for the games to actually release during the holiday or whatever.
1106000	1119000	But I'm curious, since the Memorial Day weekend is a time for traveling, and it is a time we go out and everywhere and so forth, what's like the furthest that you've traveled to play video games or play a video game?
1119000	1126000	And I put this out to the chat room as well. What types of traveling have you done to play video games?
1127000	1136000	Well, I'd say the furthest that I've traveled to play video games have been going to Sunnyvale to play like the Bomani games. I mean, that's pretty much it.
1136000	1138000	Yeah, we used to do a lot of that back in the day.
1138000	1147000	I went to San Diego to play, uh, crap. What was the first DDR that brought in the freeze arrows?
1147000	1148000	Max?
1148000	1158000	Max, yeah. I had already planned on going to San Diego and I added that to my trip where, of course, I've played DDR in Pensacola.
1158000	1168000	Yeah, um, you know, back in those music game days, trips to LA to go to Arcade Infinity to play Beatmania 2DX and the things they had were not uncommon at all.
1168000	1179000	So, man, we used to do those types of trips all the time in the Bay Area. I'm still doing that now with these round one trips. I was just at round one on Saturday because I happened to be in San Jose, so we stopped by there.
1179000	1186000	So, uh, yeah, so, I mean, those trips are not completely unheard of anymore. Looking at chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
1186000	1193000	Let's see, Bobby Blackwolf says, I traveled to Tokyo to play the arcade games. I mean, I was also visiting my friend.
1193000	1205000	But Bobby says, if you want to restrict it to just to play video games and not take part in a bigger thing, I traveled to Dance Beat Arcade in Nashville a couple times just to visit the arcade and that's a four hour drive.
1206000	1213000	Yeah, I was looking at when I go to the East Coast, like, is it possible that I could get out to Fun Spot, but I just don't think I can swing it. It's just too far out of the way.
1213000	1219000	But it's one of those things I considered because, you know, it is a little piece of gaming history out there and so forth.
1219000	1228000	Yeah, I mean, I've traveled a lot. I mean, I could say, well, I went to Washington, D.C. to go to MAGFest and play games, but that's kind of, I didn't really go there.
1228000	1229000	Well, we went to E3.
1229000	1231000	Yeah, I didn't really just go there to play games.
1231000	1232000	We went to E3 to play video games.
1232000	1236000	Yeah, the conventions thing's a little outside what I was looking for here, maybe.
1236000	1242000	But did you ever go to, like, a preview event that you had to drive aways to get to, like these Nintendo things?
1242000	1244000	Didn't you go to the State Fair to play Rock Band one year?
1244000	1252000	No, I didn't go to the State Fair. I went to this, it was an event that they had at, I don't even know what it was exactly.
1252000	1261000	It was some event that they had out front of the, what was it, the Sacramento River Cats stadium.
1261000	1266000	So they had, like, I don't even know what it was, like some music festival thing.
1266000	1269000	And they had Rock Band set up there and I played it there.
1269000	1273000	But I don't think I necessarily went there just for that.
1273000	1277000	I went with, I don't even remember why I went there.
1277000	1280000	But yeah, it was one of the things I checked out while I was there.
1280000	1285000	Bobby Black Wolf says, I drove to Orlando to see video games live. That was an eight hour drive.
1285000	1287000	Didn't we go to San Jose for...
1287000	1292000	I don't think I went to San Jose with you guys. I went to San Francisco once for one of those.
1292000	1299000	But I remember going to LA to go to Dear Friends and More Friends. However, those were during E3.
1299000	1303000	But I would have still gone just for those shows.
1303000	1305000	We went to Great America just to play Planet Harrier.
1305000	1308000	We used to go to San Francisco, was it, for the Konami press events?
1308000	1313000	Yeah, yeah. We went to Great America to do the...
1313000	1314000	I didn't go.
1314000	1317000	I know you didn't go, but you reminded me of that. The Mass Effect ride.
1317000	1318000	I should go.
1318000	1319000	It's okay.
1319000	1320000	So?
1320000	1322000	You can see the review over at VOG Network's YouTube.
1322000	1325000	I should still go and see if they have the Planet Harrier still.
1325000	1329000	I don't remember seeing one. I remember doing a weird...
1329000	1333000	I don't know if, I think it's like a bonus clip at the end of the YouTube that we did.
1333000	1337000	But I remember shooting a lot of, like, when I sent all these videos to Bobby that we shot at Great America.
1337000	1339000	I was like, Bobby, I took a lot of B-roll.
1339000	1345000	I was like, you're going to have to sit through some bullshit that I took for this video.
1345000	1348000	And I remember some of it was like this arcade.
1348000	1351000	And I don't think I remember seeing a Planet Harrier there.
1351000	1355000	But I think I was pointing out one of the stupid prizes they had available in the arcade.
1355000	1359000	Like, there was some really tacky shit that they were giving away in the arcade.
1360000	1367000	We did drive, like, in San Jose across, you know, several freeways to go to round one.
1367000	1370000	Oh, yeah. Well, round one's kind of out there in San Jose.
1370000	1373000	Yeah, driving anywhere in the Bay Area is kind of like...
1373000	1374000	Depends on when you do it.
1374000	1375000	Yeah.
1375000	1376000	Yeah.
1376000	1381000	And, oh, here's, okay, you want to hear this one? Video game related things? You ready?
1381000	1384000	So I drove to Oakland to see video games live.
1384000	1389000	Not the eight-hour trip that Bobby took, but it was like a 90-minute drive for me.
1389000	1393000	So I went to video games live with Grandpa from Hoard House.
1393000	1397000	This is when, like, Grandpa and I were first friends and another mutual friend of ours.
1397000	1399000	So here's how everything works.
1399000	1405000	So at video games live in Oakland, I saw and I ran into, while I was with Grandpa from Hoard House,
1405000	1411000	I ran into Captain Spike from GameBooey.org, who is talking to another friend of his.
1411000	1415000	And he said, oh, Rob, I think you guys have been friends on LiveJournal for a long time.
1415000	1417000	Have you ever met Allen?
1417000	1422000	And that was the first time I ever met Allen in person was at video games live.
1422000	1424000	I don't know if anybody, everybody here knows that.
1424000	1427000	I probably, I can't imagine I wouldn't have told that before, but I met...
1427000	1428000	Apart from camp.
1428000	1432000	I met Allen, well, now you had to throw that out there.
1432000	1434000	Fine. It's one of those nights, a three-day weekend.
1434000	1438000	So Allen and I were in the same youth organization when we were 15 years old.
1438000	1440000	He was in a Bay Area part of it and I was in Sacramento part of it.
1440000	1442000	And we both went to leadership camp.
1442000	1446000	The same, we know we were there the same year because we have similar memories,
1446000	1448000	but we don't remember meeting each other.
1448000	1450000	But only like 40 kids went to this camp.
1450000	1456000	So Allen and I probably met each other when we were teenagers, like 15, 16, but we don't remember it.
1456000	1462000	Like, you know, but we're convinced there's a picture out there of all the kids at this event
1462000	1466000	that is probably in my parents' house somewhere that we have yet to find.
1466000	1468000	So, but that's just funny.
1468000	1472000	Yes, Dark Soccer, you're right. We would have met at camp, technically,
1472000	1475000	but then we didn't really meet in person until that video game's live event.
1475000	1477000	That time at leadership camp?
1477000	1478000	Exactly, right?
1480000	1481000	There it goes.
1481000	1484000	Alright, yeah, MXC says, I like this story.
1484000	1486000	I like that story, too. Thank you very much.
1486000	1487000	Alright.
1487000	1491000	So, a little bit about traveling for video games.
1491000	1494000	Good times. Hope you guys are being safe if you're traveling this weekend.
1494000	1497000	Or playing some games, if you're playing games at home, this is a great time to do it as well.
1497000	1500000	Let's talk about what types of video games you've been playing this week.
1500000	1502000	I have not really drank anything yet.
1502000	1506000	I've had the tiniest sip of this vodka that you made.
1506000	1508000	You didn't make the vodka, but you infused it.
1508000	1511000	Right, and when I do an infusion, I do potato vodka.
1511000	1512000	Okay.
1512000	1515000	Because, honestly, I like the flavor of potato vodka better.
1515000	1516000	I like potatoes.
1516000	1517000	Do you french fry your vodka?
1517000	1520000	No, but real vodka is made with potatoes.
1520000	1521000	Yeah, I know.
1521000	1528000	So, um, I did one that I infused with, uh, um, great, now I can't, crystallized ginger.
1528000	1529000	Ginger was one, yeah.
1529000	1530000	Crystallized ginger.
1530000	1531000	So, candy ginger.
1531000	1537000	I did another one that is made with Parma violets, which our UK buddies should know.
1537000	1542000	Um, they're like the little sweet, sweeties, smarties things that we have over here.
1542000	1543000	Oh, okay.
1543000	1544000	Except they're violet flavored.
1544000	1547000	We need to do a maple bacon infused vodka.
1547000	1548000	I will do that.
1548000	1551000	I'm just curious to see how that would either be really good or really horrible.
1551000	1554000	I have both maple, real maple syrup and bacon at my house.
1554000	1558000	I can't imagine they don't actually, I mean, I know it's not going to be as good as something
1558000	1563000	that you make, but, like, I can't imagine that with all the bacon mania in this country,
1563000	1565000	there isn't, like, an over-the-counter...
1565000	1568000	See, the problem with, like, today, I was trying to get vanilla vodka, but they only
1568000	1570000	had, like, they had vanilla vodka.
1570000	1571000	It was, like, $30 for a bottle.
1571000	1572000	Where did you go?
1572000	1573000	I went with a Raley's.
1573000	1574000	Like, crappy grocery store.
1574000	1575000	Do the Bevmo.
1575000	1577000	I know, I didn't have time to go to Bevmo.
1577000	1580000	I would have gone to Bevmo, because Bevmo, the last time I went there, I think the bottle
1580000	1581000	of vodka was, like, 12 bucks.
1581000	1582000	Yeah.
1582000	1583000	You know, like, for vanilla vodka.
1583000	1587000	It was, like, Raley's, they're like, oh, yeah, it's $30 for just vodka.
1587000	1590000	Wait, wait, wait, we're giving them free commercial space here.
1590000	1592000	Bevmo's smell really bad.
1592000	1593000	I'm just kidding.
1593000	1595000	I made that up, but they shouldn't get free advertising.
1595000	1600000	But, um, but, um, the other one I brought back just for you.
1600000	1601000	Yeah?
1601000	1602000	Candy corn.
1602000	1604000	I love the candy corn one, but the ginger one's really good.
1604000	1605000	It's strong.
1605000	1606000	It is.
1606000	1607720	But I can drink that ginger beer.
1607720	1613360	The first taste of it, it burns, and then it turns into this sweet.
1613360	1618640	So it starts off with that ginger bite, and then fades into something really sweet.
1618640	1622120	But now that you said, like, root beer, I'm like, oh, man, that would have been amazing
1622120	1623120	mixing that root beer.
1623120	1624120	Someone bring us root beer.
1624120	1625520	But I'm gonna try, what soda should I mix that with?
1625520	1627520	Is that just Sprite, or do you think I should do Dr. Pepper?
1627520	1631680	I did bring Diet Beverage, and I brought Dr. Pepper, and Sprite, and Diet Mountain Dew.
1631680	1635800	All right, I'm gonna try mixing the ginger with something, and that's gonna be my first
1635800	1638440	one with Sprite, because then it would come out kind of ginger ale-y.
1638440	1639440	All right.
1639440	1642360	Anyway, before we were talking about liquor, we were, and again, I'm just gonna warn y'all,
1642360	1644520	if this is your first Orange Lounge Radio.
1644520	1646680	This ain't our first drunk show.
1646680	1650820	If this is your first episode of Orange Lounge Radio, thank you so much for taking us out.
1650820	1651820	Really do appreciate it.
1651820	1655640	You know, we've been doing this for 15 years, uh, dark soccer, Logie and I have been kicking
1655640	1660640	it ever since we all first met playing DDR, but, um, this is just gonna be a crazy show
1660640	1661640	tonight.
1661640	1662880	I haven't drank that much.
1662880	1666480	Not just because of the liquor, but just because of the fact it's like a three-day weekend.
1666480	1670800	There hasn't been a ton of news, because E3 is coming up, so I'm just, I'm just saying.
1670800	1676120	Don't judge the entirety of OOLR based on this random fucking tangent episode.
1676120	1679600	Then again, some of our longtime listeners, they love this shit the most, so we do it
1679600	1680600	for you.
1680600	1684240	See, if I had, like, nowhere to drive to, then I would have had a lot more than what
1684240	1686520	I had, but unfortunately, you gotta...
1686520	1689960	Nothing's gonna talk, no, we're never gonna get, and yes, always drink responsibly, that's
1689960	1690960	very important.
1690960	1693760	Great caution to make sure we're not gonna drive drunk or any of that stuff.
1693760	1698000	But, uh, the other, I mean, nothing is ever gonna top that episode when you and I lived
1698000	1703400	together and I, I don't even remember what happened, Jamie ate all my waffles and then
1703400	1704400	passed out in my bed.
1704400	1705480	No, those were Matt's waffles.
1705480	1706480	This was during...
1706480	1708360	Because I paid you back for your waffles three years later.
1708360	1709360	I don't remember.
1709360	1711880	And this was not something that happened, like, before the show, this happened during
1711880	1716320	the show and I was, like, kicking the wall, yelling, I'm in the matrix, I'm in the matrix.
1716320	1721280	I don't remember what Loki was doing, but I think you were, like, deep frying bacon
1721280	1722280	or something.
1722280	1723280	Oh, I was super bacon, probably.
1723280	1724760	Should you be operating a deep fryer when you're toxic?
1724760	1726760	No, I wasn't deep frying bacon, it's microwaved.
1726760	1727760	Oh, okay.
1727760	1731160	I remember that you had the deep fryer and you made cornflake coated rice balls.
1731160	1732160	I used to do that.
1732160	1733160	That was good.
1733160	1736760	My wife still doesn't let me buy it, like, you know, a deep fryer, I'm like, I keep saying
1736760	1737760	that, should I get a deep fryer?
1737760	1738760	I need one to make falafel.
1738760	1739760	Deep fryer, deep fryer.
1739760	1743600	But, um, yeah, she wouldn't let me do that, and yes, because, you know, bacon is so healthy
1743600	1748160	by itself, I figured that it just needed more salt and pepper and whatever else I'd
1748160	1749160	sprinkle on it.
1749160	1751860	So, yeah, it's extra salty, extra peppery bacon.
1751860	1752860	Extra heart attacky.
1752860	1753860	Extra heart attacky.
1753860	1757160	It's like, oh, this is poison as it is, now it's really gonna kill you.
1757160	1761840	Act Def points out in our chat over at live.vognotework.com, there's always that disclosure for the drunk
1761840	1762840	shows.
1762840	1768280	Well, it's important, you know, it's okay to get stupid, just don't be stupid about
1768280	1769280	it.
1769280	1778200	I am sticking to my carefully crafted beverage of Diet Pepsi and Kraken.
1778200	1781080	I used up less of my Kraken and I kind of wish I bought some more.
1781080	1783400	I honestly don't feel it anymore, really, to be honest.
1783400	1784400	I love Kraken.
1784400	1786360	It makes every soda taste like oatmeal cookies.
1786360	1787360	All right.
1787360	1788360	Seriously, it's amazing.
1788360	1792320	Why would you want to make things tasting like oatmeal cookies?
1792320	1793320	Oatmeal cookies are great.
1793320	1796080	It's raisins that ruin oatmeal cookies.
1796080	1797080	That's true, raisins ruin everything.
1797080	1798080	All right.
1798080	1799080	Hello.
1799080	1802680	Yes, I know we're going to wait one quick tangent.
1802680	1804240	The grocery store near us.
1804240	1805400	It's like a cruel joke.
1805400	1809720	They put their stupid chocolate chip bagels next to their oatmeal raisin bagels.
1809720	1811640	I'm like, how evil is that?
1811640	1812640	Why would you do that?
1812640	1814640	I mean, they look exactly the same.
1814640	1816000	You put it next to each other.
1816000	1818600	Raisins are the enemy of Orange Lounge Radio.
1818600	1822320	Wait a minute.
1822320	1823640	Raisins are okay.
1823640	1824760	No, they're not.
1824760	1825760	They suck.
1826440	1831640	They're the evil Soviet spies of the condiment world.
1831640	1832640	They're not evil.
1832640	1837040	It's just I don't like if I'm going into it expecting chocolate chips and I bite into
1837040	1838680	a raisin, I'm going to be disappointed.
1838680	1840080	That's just really what it is.
1840080	1841080	Yeah.
1841080	1842080	No, I agree.
1842080	1843080	That's fucked up.
1843080	1844720	That if like you think like, oh, yummy, this chocolate chip cookie.
1844720	1845720	I'm so excited.
1845720	1848200	And you bite into it, it's fucking raisin and oatmeal.
1848200	1850760	I actually just hate raisins for real.
1850760	1852240	Who fucking did that?
1852240	1853240	Who did that?
1853240	1854240	Like, I'm okay.
1854240	1855240	I'm okay with that.
1855720	1856720	Raisins are great salad.
1856720	1857720	I have two things that I super hate.
1857720	1858720	You know what's better than raisins?
1858720	1859720	Crazins.
1859720	1864160	Okay, I can eat those because dried cranberries are good, but raisins are just like failed
1864160	1867480	grapes.
1867480	1869680	But I hate raisins and I hate marshmallows.
1869680	1873680	Well, Dark Tetsuya answered your question in chat over at live.voguenetwork.com.
1873680	1874920	Who would put those bagels next to each other?
1874920	1878040	He says some people just want to watch the world burn.
1878040	1881760	In this case, would it be some people just want to watch the bagels toast?
1881760	1882760	I guess.
1882760	1884080	I actually don't even like raisinets.
1884080	1889200	Not even chocolate can remove the hatred that, you know, and the only way I like marshmallows
1889200	1890800	is when they're on fire.
1890800	1891800	True.
1891800	1893800	I hate s'mores actually.
1893800	1895600	But I like Chris Crispy treats.
1895600	1896600	Wow.
1896600	1898280	I heart Rob Roberts in chat.
1898280	1899280	What a pleasant name.
1899280	1903360	Says, I don't hate raisins, but I also wouldn't go out of my way to defend them.
1903360	1904360	Thank you.
1904360	1905360	All right, look.
1905360	1906360	Hey, so my gaming week.
1906360	1907360	Yes.
1907360	1912520	I was like, this discussion is important.
1912520	1913620	Chocolate chip bagels and raisin bagels.
1914160	1915160	This shit needs to stop.
1915160	1918460	Go make your drink, Rob.
1918460	1919740	Bye.
1919740	1924340	So we've been watching a lot of YouTube at my house, but namely I have had this weird
1924340	1928100	kick for some reason to watch Injustice 2 videos.
1928100	1934100	Me, the person who does not like DC, has been kind of obsessed now with watching the character
1934100	1935840	interactions in Injustice 2.
1935840	1940040	So as a result, Dan said, you know what, let's just get the first game.
1940040	1941040	So he bought it.
1941440	1944680	Our game just arrived and we're going to be playing it soon.
1944680	1949480	And I like the voice acting and it's actually kind of fun because I'd played it for a little
1949480	1951840	bit before, but I was like, eh, DC, whatever the fuck.
1951840	1955080	He didn't have it in his game library because that was one of the free games that they had
1955080	1956080	in PlayStation Plus.
1956080	1958360	I don't think he even bothered.
1958360	1964600	So on top of that, it was cheap anyway for the ultimate whatever version.
1964600	1967480	We paid like 15 bucks for it, so it wasn't terrible.
1967480	1971260	And if we like it, we're going to get Injustice 2.
1971260	1976720	And it's all because of Green Arrow, really Green Arrow, because everyone else, I don't
1976720	1979200	care, but it's voiced by my man.
1979200	1984160	So I'm happy, although I have been going through like watching that and then looking up voice
1984160	1986280	actors going, I know that voice.
1986280	1995560	And so anyway, so also I have been playing World of Warcraft and I hit my first prestige
1995560	1999160	rep thing.
1999160	2003880	And apparently once you hit it, then you can refill it and you get like goodies for maxing
2003880	2006320	out your exalted rep again.
2006320	2008200	And it's kind of cool.
2008200	2011800	And yes, I know Kevin Conroy is Batman.
2011800	2020620	And then I have also been playing Miitomo and playing Pokemon Go.
2020620	2024840	I am behind on leveling, but whatever.
2024840	2032820	So we got, well Dan managed to get the Judge Dredd working so, and we have the Dead World
2032820	2033820	mod in it.
2033820	2039960	So for people who don't know this about the Judge Dredd pinball is that there is a spinning
2039960	2043880	thing in it that has these cutouts and it takes the, what?
2043880	2044880	I'm going to interrupt.
2044880	2045880	Sorry.
2045880	2046880	You have to try this.
2046880	2047880	It's really good.
2047880	2048880	No, guys, y'all, this is so important.
2048880	2049880	This is so important.
2049880	2051620	This ginger vodka she made mixed with the seven up.
2051620	2052620	This is amazing.
2052620	2053620	Hot.
2053620	2054620	Damn.
2054620	2055620	Yeah.
2055620	2056620	Right.
2056620	2057620	That's not really good.
2057620	2058620	Do you like ginger?
2058620	2059620	Loki?
2059620	2061340	No, I don't think that's a good idea.
2061340	2062340	Being that I'm sick.
2062340	2063340	Oh yeah.
2063340	2064340	That's right.
2064340	2065340	Yeah.
2065340	2066340	Don't drink from the glass.
2066340	2067340	Nevermind.
2067340	2068340	But alcohol is, it kills things.
2068340	2069340	This is true.
2069340	2070340	We can't argue that logic.
2070340	2071340	I can get you a straw.
2071340	2072340	All right.
2072340	2075580	Anyways, so sorry to interrupt the video game chat, but you know what?
2075580	2076700	I'll fucking warned you.
2076700	2082860	So anyway, so the Dead World on the Judge Dredd has these like little places that the
2082860	2087900	ball will jump into and then the ball will fall out of it as it moves.
2087900	2092940	Well, the original intent of it was that these little areas were closed off and that it locks
2092940	2094920	the ball in these different holes.
2094920	2099680	And there's a crane that has full functionality, but because they removed the way the Dead
2099680	2103160	World functioned, that crane is there and doesn't do anything.
2103160	2112080	So there's like a mod that came out to restore the Judge Dredd table to, shut up, Brad.
2112080	2119920	He said balls, holes, but anyway, it restored that original gameplay to the Judge Dredd
2119920	2124560	and it's really a lot of fun and it makes multiball a fucking bitch.
2124560	2129200	You've got all the balls going and they drop them and it's just so cool.
2129200	2130620	It is really neat.
2130620	2135540	The crane will just look up Dead World mod on Judge Dredd and you'll see what I'm talking
2135540	2136540	about.
2136540	2137540	It's totally awesome.
2137540	2141980	And then, um, I don't remember, so I guess I'm done.
2141980	2144220	All right, then we'll go over to Loki.
2144220	2145220	How was your gaming week?
2145220	2149440	Um, I played a few things this week, so I finally picked up Overwatch because now they
2149440	2150920	have that game of the year edition.
2150920	2152140	So I picked that up.
2152140	2155940	I, I didn't get to play a long time because I was home with my son.
2155940	2158820	He was sick with a cold, which now I have caught.
2158820	2166420	Um, so I was able to play a few rounds against AI and so I did that and that was all right.
2166420	2170100	Um, maybe I got the level up to three, which is nothing.
2170100	2173420	Um, but I like it so far.
2173420	2179260	And then I played more Grand Theft Auto five on PC and just going through the single player
2179260	2180260	game.
2180260	2181260	I'm having a lot of fun.
2181260	2182260	That looks fantastic.
2182260	2187180	Um, I played a little bit of, what did I play on the, there was something I played on the
2187180	2190340	PlayStation cause I had, what was it?
2190340	2191340	Oh no, no, no.
2191340	2192340	I didn't play them.
2192340	2199580	I had bought, um, they have a, uh, bacon frame theme for your PlayStation four.
2199580	2201540	So I have that now in my back.
2201540	2204020	How do people, I, okay, we need to talk about this for a minute.
2204020	2205200	This is important.
2205200	2210440	There is so much like garbage themes and stuff on PlayStation four, like all these throwaway
2210440	2211440	themes.
2211440	2213440	Like how do I, how do I get in on that?
2213440	2219000	Like I feel like VOG could make a lot of money if we just like, you know, joined forces with
2219000	2227600	a photographer and a graphic artist and like made some of these cheap themes on PlayStation
2227600	2230480	four because there's, there's a million of them.
2230480	2232280	I mean, go look on the store plays.
2232280	2233280	There's a million of them.
2233280	2235280	I don't know how that works at all.
2235280	2238720	Like obviously the photos would need to be original, which I said we need to team up
2238720	2241600	with a photographer who could take some original photos that we would have the rights to.
2242040	2246560	You know, it's like, my God, there's so much stuff out there.
2246560	2251280	Just get some cats, take some, I'm sure there's already cat themes out there, but what's,
2251280	2252720	what's wrong with more cat themes?
2252720	2256900	We'll take some pictures of cats and just, you know, have a little meow theme.
2256900	2262160	And then we do pictures of puppies and just all the animals.
2262160	2265120	I mean, yeah, I don't know how you get in with that.
2265120	2269240	If you have to, if it's the same kind of pathway that they have for like game developers, because
2269400	2272280	I know some of those themes are a little bit more interactive as far as like how you set
2272280	2277360	them up, but I can't imagine that it's all just necessarily, you know, game programming
2277360	2278360	stuff.
2278360	2281440	It's probably, I don't know, HTML stuff or whatever.
2281440	2283520	So yeah, I got that.
2283520	2285680	It's silly.
2285680	2286800	And then what else?
2286800	2293760	I didn't necessarily play this yet, but I picked up, cause I had back did a while ago,
2293760	2296080	we happy few, but I never got my key for it.
2296080	2298480	I'm like, well shit, you know, I can play it now.
2299040	2300520	I probably should get my key for it.
2300520	2305040	So I emailed them like, Hey, I don't believe you sent me a key for this.
2305040	2307080	And I think they did, but I may have deleted it.
2307080	2308080	And so they sent me a new one.
2308080	2309080	I got that.
2309080	2313440	But yeah, I mean, just kind of playing around with my computer here and being able to run
2313440	2316280	stuff now is nice.
2316280	2317280	That's pretty much it.
2317280	2318280	Oh, cell phone games.
2318280	2325240	You know, doing the daily Pokemon stuff and my idle, you know, clicker office space game,
2325240	2329440	which is actually, you know, for an aisle clicker game, they do give you a lot more
2329440	2332240	reasons to play, especially with all these different events that they do each week.
2332240	2338840	So it's kind of a challenge, I guess, to try to earn as many because you play it as a completely
2338840	2341240	separate game than the one you're at your main game.
2341240	2346640	And then you, the levels that you get to also unlock things for the main game, which is
2346640	2347640	kind of cool.
2347640	2350360	So it gives you a little bit of a challenge to play it.
2350360	2355200	And I'm sure for them, it means more ad revenue because you watch more ads, but I'm enjoying
2355200	2356200	it.
2356200	2361920	I mean, it's a good time sink and it doesn't seem to be so blatant with like, I don't know,
2361920	2365760	it's not, it doesn't feel like some of the other ones that play like Katamari or EDF
2365760	2366760	or anything like that.
2366760	2367760	So I don't know.
2367760	2368760	I enjoy it.
2368760	2369760	That's it.
2369760	2372360	I want to grow you a little more on Overwatch.
2372360	2375240	I know you didn't get to play a lot of it, but what did you think?
2375240	2376240	I liked it.
2376240	2377240	I thought it was interesting.
2377240	2378240	I mean, I don't know.
2378240	2379240	It was so brief.
2379240	2384040	I mainly played a few games, but I've been playing just Soldier 76.
2384080	2388160	Which is probably the easiest one to start with if you're used to, you know, other shooty
2388160	2389160	games.
2389160	2390680	They kind of made him to be the Call of Duty guy.
2390680	2391680	Yeah.
2391680	2393400	So that's what I've been just playing for now.
2393400	2398060	I mean, obviously, you know, against the AI, it's kind of stupid.
2398060	2400000	It's like, okay, I've just played through four games.
2400000	2401000	I've gotten no deaths.
2401000	2404920	I mean, obviously this is on super easy mode right now, but I mean, I don't know.
2404920	2405920	I had fun.
2405920	2412280	It was kind of ironic because like, I didn't know, like, I don't know if all like the AI
2412280	2416160	acts like people in the game because I finally figured out, because like when it said versus
2416160	2420400	AI, I thought, okay, it's just me with an AI team placing against another team of AI.
2420400	2423560	Apparently you're playing against other, with other people against AI.
2423560	2424560	I had no idea.
2424560	2425560	Yep.
2425560	2428240	And so there's like at the end of the matches, a whole bunch of like GG, GG, you know, and
2428240	2429240	stuff like that.
2429240	2432480	I'm like, is that the AI doing that or is that like the people doing that?
2432480	2433480	I'm like, I don't know.
2433480	2440120	I don't know who's really actually the AI does it in those AI matches, the AI will randomly
2440120	2445000	type GG, uh, you know, or if they lose, they'll put, you know, Oh, shucks, you know, things
2445000	2446000	like that.
2446000	2447640	They'll, they actually do put little chat messages in.
2447640	2448640	Okay.
2448640	2450040	I was like, I didn't, I thought that was kind of weird.
2450040	2454080	I'm like, I didn't realize that it was that sophisticated, but yeah, I mean, like it's
2454080	2455880	been super easy right now.
2455880	2460840	I mean, obviously cause I'm like level three, but, um, I don't know, like it is far as like
2460840	2461840	the unlocks go.
2461840	2467080	I got the, um, tracer skin for the, um, you know, game of the year things.
2467080	2469880	So you got a legendary in your first loot box.
2469880	2470880	Yeah.
2470880	2471880	Wow.
2471880	2472880	Good for you.
2472880	2473880	So, um, that was kind of nice.
2473880	2477080	I mean, all the other ones have sucked, but, uh, active to suggesting Loki can also try
2477080	2478920	diva then move on to other characters.
2478920	2479920	Yeah.
2479920	2482880	As far as, you know, especially with the tanks go, diva is just got a machine gun basically.
2482880	2487400	So she, and it's unlimited ammo, so it's just pretty easy to, but when you get knocked the
2487400	2491000	whole getting knocked out of the Mac and go, that can be a little weird, but that gets
2491000	2494280	you used to some of the other like weird shit that happens on other characters.
2494280	2495280	Yeah.
2495280	2496600	I'd be curious to figure out how to play the other characters.
2496600	2499960	I just don't want to grow, you know, jump into a match and like, Oh, you suck.
2499960	2504480	I mean, a great in on level three or something, they're gonna probably assume I suck anyways,
2504480	2507720	but like, I don't want to just like go in there and just be like complete detriment.
2507720	2510560	Most of that, most of that is kept to ranked at this point.
2510560	2513520	Anyway, if you're playing quick match, you're going to get people of all skill levels.
2513520	2516600	That's just a fact, but you can, and I use this a lot.
2516600	2520440	The practice range is great for getting used to characters.
2520440	2523280	Like especially when I was trying to learn how to play Sombra cause you really have to
2523280	2527960	get used to the whole, like how she disappears and you know, throws her thing that she can
2527960	2530400	teleport back to and kind of the timing between those.
2530400	2535880	So you can really effectively like, you know, throw out your teleport, invis, get behind
2535880	2540680	the enemy while you're invisible, hack the enemy and then teleport back before they notice
2540680	2542200	you and start shooting you.
2542200	2544760	That that takes practice to get all that timing down, you know?
2544760	2548040	So I mean the practice range is great for that type of stuff and really be able to time
2548040	2549160	the moves and stuff.
2549160	2551520	So all right.
2551520	2553960	Anything else for your gaming week?
2553960	2554960	That's it.
2554960	2555960	All right.
2555960	2558800	Uh, my gaming week, not, not, uh, not as exciting as other weeks.
2558800	2560200	I didn't play a lot of new stuff.
2560200	2564200	Uh, you know, I've been live streaming and playing some, playing some overwatch and live
2564200	2568200	stream and Final Fantasy 14 quite a bit as well, uh, and other stuff, but not a lot of
2568200	2569280	new stuff this week.
2569280	2575240	I feel like I've watched enough Friday the 13th on live streams to have said I played
2575240	2578520	it, but I haven't played it, but I've watched an awful lot of it.
2578520	2582720	Obviously my buddy Flaco Jones has been streaming a lot of it, but I watched other random people,
2582720	2584920	um, in some of the communities streaming it too.
2584920	2586800	And it looks, it looks like it's fun.
2586800	2591280	The only concern I have with dropping 40 bucks on a game like Friday the 13th is the fact
2591280	2594080	that, you know, there's only just a couple maps right now.
2594080	2599560	And it seems like that whole, the game format, like it's really fun now for a weekend, but
2599560	2600920	how long is that really going to last?
2600920	2602120	I'm not sure.
2602120	2606080	So that's why I'm, but the real question is, are they going to have like the Jason and
2606080	2608100	space map at some point?
2608100	2610940	They might, I don't, I don't know what else they're going to put out there, but, um, well
2610940	2615180	I did see, okay, so Flaco was streaming last night and he was letting his wife.
2615180	2619340	So is he play like as, you know, uh, Jason or is he, it's random.
2619340	2620340	You get random.
2620340	2621340	Yeah.
2621340	2623460	You can elect if you're willing to be Jason or whatever.
2623460	2626420	I think you can turn that on or off or something, but it's random.
2626420	2627420	Who's Jason.
2627420	2631140	In fact, this was about to say is that, uh, in the first match that Flaco played last
2631140	2633300	night when I was watching, he let his wife play.
2633300	2636960	So, um, he was like, you know, he wanted to let the wife get used to it and she screams
2636960	2639000	a lot when, you know, scary things happen.
2639000	2640600	So it's a lot of fun.
2640600	2647840	Um, so the first match, she gets Jason and it's, he, Flaco had never played Jason at
2647840	2648840	all ever.
2648840	2653200	So they were kind of both learning how Jason works because Jason obviously has all these
2653200	2657880	abilities that the counselor doesn't, counselors don't have to keep it balanced because there's,
2657880	2661560	there could be up to like seven camp counselors and one Jason.
2661560	2665640	So Jason can fricking teleport, he can do this thing called morph and he can teleport
2665640	2667180	pretty much anywhere on the map.
2667180	2670320	And then he can do this thing called like, I don't know if it was stock or what it was,
2670320	2675360	but you can basically like do this, like drifting through the woods at a really fast pace.
2675360	2678720	But it's that whole thing, like how in the movies, Jason would just suddenly appear behind
2678720	2679720	somebody.
2679720	2681380	Like you can do that in the game.
2681380	2684560	But obviously, you know, you still have to kind of have a general idea where the counselors
2684560	2686280	are to be able to do that.
2686280	2689120	Can you see them like through the walls or something like that and they have like, there's
2689120	2690120	certain modes.
2690120	2693520	Like I think if you just start, they glow red or you can see when they're sound, when
2693520	2698480	the counselors are making sound, you see little, little dots that appear on the map,
2698480	2704640	but they give the counselors like radios and some of the cabins to screw with Jason with
2704640	2705640	that.
2705640	2710280	So there is a little bit of, you know, Jason isn't super powerful, but like it's, it's
2710280	2715800	almost impossible to get through a Friday the 13th game and not have Jason at least
2715800	2717240	kill a couple people.
2717240	2722780	It's just, it's, it's a damn near impossible for all of the counselors to escape unscathed.
2723040	2726060	So, uh, yeah, it's just, it's as it should be.
2726060	2727060	Right.
2727060	2728060	Let's see.
2728060	2731460	I mean, if he's not killing somebody, he's going to, his reputation is definitely going
2731460	2733460	to be ruined from it.
2733460	2736700	Dungeon buster said it was funny watching one stream where the guy tried to rescue his
2736700	2740940	friend getting choked by Jason and took a shot killing his friend instead.
2740940	2743260	That's from a dungeon buster at live.vogdoer.com.
2743260	2744260	Yeah, that can happen.
2744260	2747940	You can actually kill the other counselors too, uh, in the game.
2747940	2752300	So cause I remember Flaco was about to escape on the boat and he was afraid that the other
2752300	2754620	counselor that was with him was going to try to kill him.
2754620	2757540	But then like Flaco got in the boat and the other counselor like wasn't getting in the
2757540	2758540	boat.
2758540	2763240	So Flaco gave it like 20 seconds then was like, I'm out of here and zoomed out and got
2763240	2766640	on the boat and left the other counselor basically to be stranded.
2766640	2770940	And sure enough, once he got out of there, he, you go into spectate mode once you're
2770940	2774480	either dead or you, you get out of the camp so you can see the rest of the game play out.
2774480	2778580	And he ended up spectating the counselor that was trying to get in the boat with him and
2778580	2781540	Jason was already killing her.
2781540	2787420	So Flaco got out of there and then Jason killed the one that he left behind.
2787420	2788420	And I was laughing.
2788420	2789420	I was laughing.
2789420	2793140	I think, I think I actually tipped Flaco like a hundred bits just cause that moment was
2793140	2794460	so fucking funny.
2794460	2797220	So yeah, you can see that over, over in his chat.
2797220	2798220	Yeah.
2798220	2800380	Bobby Black Wolf in chat says Flaco is a cold blooded murderer.
2800380	2801380	Yes.
2801380	2802380	Yes.
2802380	2803380	He was that night.
2803380	2804380	He definitely was.
2804380	2805380	Hey, it's all about survival.
2805380	2807980	I mean, I look out for number one because if you don't, then that's when stupid things
2807980	2808980	happen.
2808980	2809980	You die.
2810140	2811580	So I didn't even play that myself.
2811580	2813940	I'm just telling you what I'm like fun.
2813940	2817380	I think especially like with friends and stuff, it would be fun, but I just worry about the
2817380	2818380	longevity of it.
2818380	2819660	Does he have that on PlayStation 4 or?
2819660	2822900	He has it on PlayStation 4, but almost every other streamer I've seen is on PC.
2822900	2823900	Sounds like fun.
2823900	2824900	Yeah.
2824900	2826220	That'd be a lot of fun.
2826220	2827440	Um, let's see.
2827440	2828440	Other games.
2828440	2829440	Um, okay.
2829440	2832180	So I will talk about one phone game cause obviously I still play, you know, the Niantic
2832180	2835940	games, but I want to talk about another new game that just came out this week.
2835940	2836940	Oh yes.
2836940	2837940	I need to get this actually.
2837940	2843460	So, um, uh, Dark Soccer as the fortune cookie message last week or the week before played
2843460	2846820	that Magikarp song that was about how Magikarp is like the worst Pokemon ever.
2846820	2851980	Well, that was all to lead into a game that Pokemon company released called Magikarp basically,
2851980	2854140	or I think at least that's what the icon's called.
2854140	2855140	What is the actual name of this game?
2855140	2857140	I think it's like Magikarp.
2857140	2858540	Let's raise Magikarp or something like that.
2858540	2859780	I don't know the actual name of the game.
2859780	2861520	It's a Pokemon Magikarp jump.
2861520	2862860	That's the name of it.
2862860	2869360	So in this game, and I use that term very loosely, you feed Magikarp food, you train
2869360	2877040	Magikarp and you battle, but all it is is you jump and you jump high based on how well
2877040	2879460	your Pokemon has been raised basically.
2879460	2882540	But here's, here's the little twist with this game.
2882540	2883620	There's no fucking game.
2883620	2884620	There's no skill.
2884620	2885620	The training?
2885620	2886900	You just click train.
2886900	2887900	Okay.
2887900	2888900	You trained.
2888900	2889900	Uh, the feeding?
2889900	2891960	You just tap the food on the, I suppose that's the game.
2891960	2895400	You tap the food on the screen to feed your Magikarp.
2895400	2896400	That's it.
2896400	2897400	There's no other.
2897400	2902640	So I mean, I guess you could say loosely, like very loosely.
2902640	2907880	There's some strategy about, well, do I spend coins to upgrade the food in my tank or do
2907880	2911320	I spend coins to upgrade the types of training available?
2911320	2912320	What do I do?
2912320	2917460	What do I do or what should I spend those diamonds on that I could drop real money on
2917460	2921080	if I wanted to, but I'll just try to save enough from all the little piddly things you
2921080	2922080	do in the game.
2922080	2926640	Should I get a Charizard for my little thing that will restore points of training once
2926640	2927640	in a while?
2927640	2928760	You know, all the dumb things they do.
2928760	2932960	So like, that's the only thing about the Magikarp jump game is that like, there's no fucking
2932960	2933960	game.
2933960	2934960	There really isn't.
2934960	2940360	Like, I feel like I'm playing a BBS door game on an iPhone and yet those BBS door games
2940360	2941800	still had more skill.
2941800	2944800	You know what I mean?
2944800	2950440	Yet all that being said, I still can't stop playing it and I check in on my stupid little
2950440	2955720	Magikarp and I'm now on my eighth generation of Magikarp and I keep feeding and I train
2955720	2961560	and I jump and there's leaderboards so I can see how I'm doing versus my friends and Ziba,
2961560	2964480	if you're out there, I'm coming for you.
2964480	2967560	She's like number one or two on my leaderboard right now.
2967560	2972760	And you know, you can kind of compete with your friends in that regard, but it's like,
2972760	2975500	you really don't have any control over the jumping.
2975500	2979160	It's just press the button and depending on how well you've or how much you've raised
2979160	2981320	your Magikarp, that's how high they're going to jump.
2981320	2984920	So it's like, like you would think at least there's like a meter that like press button
2984920	2986080	when the arrow is here.
2986080	2987080	No, there's none of that.
2987080	2988380	None of that stuff.
2988380	2991680	So MXC says, so it's a clicker?
2991680	2996200	Like yes, but like there's no clicking.
2996200	2997200	It's worse somehow.
2997200	2999000	It's like a nothing.
2999000	3000000	Yeah.
3000000	3004920	It's just, it's, it, it is for, for Magikarp being a game.
3004920	3009880	It's kind of perfect actually.
3009880	3012160	That's going to be the fucking quote they put on the app store.
3012160	3013160	All right.
3013160	3016160	But y'all know what I mean by that, but yet I can't stop playing.
3016160	3017160	Yeah.
3017160	3018160	Like Ziba says, it's so addicting.
3018160	3019880	I don't know what it is.
3019880	3024600	Maybe it is just the fact that you can't help, but love that little derpy Magikarp and they
3024600	3026480	do have the Magikarp in the different patterns.
3026480	3029240	So you're like, Ooh, maybe I'll get a, maybe I'll get a polka dot pattern in this time
3029240	3031280	or something, you know, a little crazy.
3031280	3035480	Does it actually come with like actual carp patterns, like real koi?
3035480	3038160	I imagine some of it is modeled after real stuff.
3038160	3039160	It has to be.
3039160	3040160	There's a ton of different ones in there.
3040160	3042160	I think the Magikarp and the Goldeen are both patterned on koi.
3042160	3043160	Oh yeah.
3043160	3044160	So.
3044160	3045160	Huh.
3045160	3046160	Interesting.
3046160	3049600	Uh, Rama in chat says it's a Tamagotchi that never dies.
3049600	3052240	That is actually an interesting way of putting it.
3052240	3055480	Uh, but act F says, unless it gets snagged by a Pidgeotto.
3055480	3056480	Oh yes.
3056480	3058120	I learned that the hard way.
3058120	3061200	Be careful you guys, because some of those little side things that happen.
3061200	3065200	So after you train, it might be like, Ooh, an event happened to Magikarp.
3065200	3069240	And usually it'll be the mayor came out to greet Magikarp and gave you back a training
3069240	3074080	point or, you know, Magikarp made a fan and the fan gave you money, you know, those types
3074080	3075080	of things.
3075080	3079360	But there was one where it was like, should Magikarp jump up to try to get this berry
3079360	3082640	and you see like a really rare berry and you're like, fuck yeah, I get the berry and you hit
3082640	3083640	the button.
3083640	3088720	And Magikarp jumped and a Pidgeotto snatched Magikarp and carried him away.
3088720	3089800	And that was it.
3089800	3095100	My Magikarp was gone and I had to go back to the lake and fish up a new one.
3095100	3098880	And the mayor just consoled me like, Oh yeah, that happens.
3098880	3102840	So don't be so greedy asshole basically.
3102840	3109160	So yeah, that's what the vid power in chat says Pidgeottos eat Magikarp, uh, apparently
3109160	3113480	or they, or they carry them away to a far off land.
3113480	3115480	That's but that's what happened.
3115480	3120720	So be careful because there's another one that involves something shiny in the water.
3120720	3123880	And I've gotten a diamond most times when I do that.
3123880	3128400	And there was one time I got a piece of glass, but it said, Oh, Magikarp was just really
3128400	3131640	disappointed that it was glass and it lost some of the training points, but I'm just
3131640	3133400	waiting for the whole, Oh, it's shiny.
3133400	3134960	Oh, it's a hook.
3134960	3138300	Your Magikarp just got caught and got filleted for dinner.
3138300	3140280	Your Magikarp is an idiot and he swallowed glass.
3140280	3144560	No, he's dead cause his intestines have been ruptured by the glass.
3144560	3145560	Right.
3145560	3146560	All right.
3146560	3147560	Anyway.
3147560	3149880	Uh, so yeah, I've been playing the Magikarp game on phone.
3149880	3151700	Play at your own risk.
3151700	3155280	It's stupid, but yet sometimes we like stupid things.
3155280	3158960	Can you get, um, I'm signed Nintendo game was going to say, can you get like my Nintendo
3158960	3160200	points with it or something?
3160200	3161400	No, none of that stuff's in it.
3161400	3164200	Cause it doesn't tie in at all with Pokemon go.
3164200	3166280	No it's a Pokemon company game.
3166280	3170120	Uh, and so it's more like a Pokemon shuffle or something like that.
3170120	3174560	It does not tie into Pokemon go, which is a Niantic game and it doesn't tie into the
3174560	3177920	Nintendo stuff cause Nintendo didn't make anything they could do to earn more Magikarp
3177920	3180240	candy cause that's just ridiculous.
3180240	3181240	I hear ya.
3181240	3184920	Well you should have done this event where you could get like a Magikarp candy for going
3184920	3187240	a quarter mile or a quarter kilometer.
3187240	3188240	Excuse me.
3188240	3192240	I did that with my stupid, I have a, um, what is it?
3192240	3198860	It's a char Charizard, not a Charizard, a little over the Charmeleon.
3198860	3201860	So I've been doing it with the Charmeleon to try to evolve because there's no tormentors
3201860	3202860	around here to catch.
3202860	3208860	So speaking of Pokemon go, Alan came into the office today and said, well guess what
3208860	3210340	went through the wash?
3210340	3214200	And there went my, there's my Pokemon clicker that I lost and I couldn't find it had gone
3214200	3218060	through the wash, but here's the punchline still works.
3218060	3219060	Still works.
3219060	3222380	In fact, I would even argue it actually, it's a little cleaner now.
3222380	3225220	It looks very nice and actually probably works better.
3225220	3227940	Not that I'm encouraging you guys to put that through the wash, do it at your own risk.
3227940	3230940	But uh, I was very surprised.
3230940	3233260	I was like, wow, this went through the wash and it still works.
3233260	3234260	So cool.
3234260	3238180	I mean, I can imagine the technology sealed pretty tight in there.
3238180	3239180	These things are for little kids.
3239180	3243620	No, I mean, the only, I would think it would just harm is if it actually had like electricity
3243620	3246740	running through it and stuff and bridging stuff, but there's not that much electricity
3246740	3247740	running through that.
3247740	3251820	And also since you dried it out, I mean, it's probably fine.
3251820	3254900	I wouldn't be surprised if it like was melted more than anything.
3254940	3258540	Dark Tits Studio in chat says, never expected something like that to be made of Nintendium,
3258540	3259540	but there you go.
3259540	3260540	Is that a joke?
3260540	3263620	Because like the old, like super Nintendos, like they don't fucking break.
3263620	3268180	No, I think it was like, was it the one that, uh, the, um, Game Boy that went through from
3268180	3269620	the golf war or something like that?
3269620	3270620	Oh yeah.
3270620	3271620	Yeah.
3271620	3272620	They have that on display in New York.
3272620	3273620	Yeah.
3273620	3274620	Yeah.
3274620	3275620	Yeah.
3275620	3276620	Okay.
3276620	3277620	Yeah.
3277620	3278620	Yeah.
3278620	3279620	No, the Nintendo hardware, man, those things can take a beating.
3279620	3280620	Or, uh, what?
3280620	3281620	The Nintendo 64 that fell down an entire flight of stairs.
3281620	3282620	It still works.
3282620	3283620	It's just, yeah.
3283620	3284620	I guess, I guess it's true.
3284620	3287220	The Nintendo systems are great murder weapons.
3287220	3294380	All right, let's get a break first, your skull or the Nintendo 64.
3294380	3295380	Let's get into some gaming news.
3295380	3296820	Oh, I got to do some quick housekeeping.
3296820	3301380	Uh, we're two weeks away from E3, so Bethesda will be rudely interrupting our show in two
3301380	3304840	weeks with their press conference, but we will be talking all about E3 for the first
3304840	3308760	time we get to do Microsoft the day of, cause they're going a little earlier this year.
3308760	3309760	So talk all about that.
3309760	3310780	That's in two weeks.
3310780	3319380	And then in three weeks is the 15th anniversary of orange lounge radio on June 18th, 15 years
3319380	3321020	of this fucking show.
3321020	3326860	Um, and actually I should point out technically orange lounge radio, the station launched
3326860	3329900	on May 23rd, 2002.
3329900	3334340	So we actually hit 15 years as a, as an entity or whatever you want to call it this past
3334340	3335340	week.
3335340	3338260	But we launched the station on, on life's cause the way it was back 15 years ago, when
3338260	3342060	we first started, we had orange lounge radio, the station that just played like DDR music
3342060	3343540	and stuff that we liked.
3343540	3349300	And the highlight of the station was to be the orange lounge radio live, which was the
3349300	3354740	show on Sunday nights that this whole thing started with and, but we gave it like a month
3354740	3356340	lead in time.
3356340	3358940	Originally we were going to start it a week earlier than we did.
3358940	3364620	The first episode was supposed to be the June or June, June, what's seven days from the
3364620	3365620	23rd.
3365620	3367300	I can't math right now cause I've been drinking 16.
3367340	3369540	Originally the first show is supposed to be June 16th.
3369540	3374980	The earliest promo stuff we did said June 16th, 2002, but we had to push it back a week
3374980	3376540	and it was dark soccer's fault.
3376540	3380140	I don't remember why, probably a trip or something.
3380140	3381140	She's making a frown.
3381140	3384620	I'll show you a trip when I trip you down the stairs.
3384620	3388180	But yeah, so, so we had launched the station in advance of the show and then our first
3388180	3389420	show is June 23rd.
3389420	3395380	So we'll be celebrating all that in a few weeks with you guys here at our chatroom live.vognetworked.com.
3395380	3397260	All right, let's get into some gaming news.
3397260	3398380	Loki, start us off.
3398380	3402340	So Microsoft Beam is no more.
3402340	3408960	So because of some trouble that they had with registering the, using the Beam name overseas,
3408960	3412540	they decided to change the name to Mixer.
3412540	3417600	And Mixer of course is kind of relaunching with some new innovations.
3417600	3423980	So what's kind of cool is you can actually do, I want to say cooperative live streaming.
3423980	3429220	So it allows up to four streamers to combine their broadcast into a single experience,
3429220	3430940	they say with like split screen views.
3430940	3433780	So that alone is awesome.
3433780	3437700	But I actually went to go watch a feed where somebody was doing this.
3437700	3440140	And so there was the four stream, I don't remember what they're all playing.
3440140	3442500	They're playing some shooty bang bang game.
3442500	3446180	And there were the four streamers, but the problem was all four of their audios were
3446180	3447180	going at the same time.
3447180	3450780	And these were all, these were all four big Beam streamers.
3450780	3453900	So like all of them at the same time were like, thank you for the follow.
3453900	3454900	Thank you.
3454900	3457740	And like, they were all talking like over each other at the same time.
3457740	3460380	So it was kind of like, I couldn't watch it.
3460380	3461380	I was like, this is a mess.
3461380	3464380	Like, I should just watch one of these streams individually.
3464380	3466540	I mean, that's cool that they're all tied together.
3466540	3471220	So it's like, you could do the multi, it's like when you watch Big Brother on CBS, if
3471220	3474820	you've ever done that online, you can switch between the different camera feeds in the
3474820	3475820	house.
3475820	3478300	But if you try to watch them all at once, it's like, there's too much going on.
3478300	3479300	Night trap.
3479300	3480300	I would compare.
3480820	3481820	Or night trap.
3481820	3482820	Sure.
3482820	3483820	We'll go with that.
3483820	3484820	So it's a little bit like that.
3484820	3486940	But I mean, in theory, it's still a cool idea.
3486940	3488620	And you know, they're still working out the kinks.
3488620	3493500	I mean, if everybody had agreed to just be silent, you know, maybe three of the streamers
3493500	3494860	just agreed to be silent.
3494860	3498540	And then the four streamer did all the talking in the audio and you just watched on the other
3498540	3499540	ones.
3499540	3500540	I think it would have worked a lot better.
3500540	3504260	So, but I love that this is a feature.
3504260	3508380	When Beam announced that I was like, oh shit, that's something like I would love to do for
3508380	3509380	VOG.
3509380	3513580	Like when we do one of these Mario Kart 8 tournaments, like how easy would that be?
3513580	3515300	Bobby does a stream.
3515300	3516820	I do a stream.
3516820	3517820	Flaco does a stream.
3517820	3519900	Like this would be like really, really cool.
3519900	3524700	Now I still, you know, I'm, I'm don't plan on leaving Twitch right now.
3524700	3527700	I tried Beam or I guess now it is Mixer.
3527700	3532980	I have Mixer, Mixer, Mixer, I have an account over there.
3532980	3536860	There's a lot about Mixer that I like, but now that I have the whole Twitch affiliate
3536860	3539980	thing going on, I've just kind of tried to invest building up my presence over there.
3539980	3545500	I don't see myself jumping ship and leaving for Beam, but I love that there's competition
3545500	3546500	now.
3546500	3551380	And this is going to, I mean, yes, there was YouTube, but YouTube, I don't know, YouTube
3551380	3554640	wasn't trying to compete with Twitch the same way that I think Microsoft is trying to do
3554640	3556180	with now Mixer.
3556180	3560980	And so I love that Mixer exists and I love that they are putting stuff like this out
3560980	3567140	there to try to differentiate themselves from Twitch to keep Twitch on their toes.
3567140	3572580	But you know, one thing to consider for Mixer or Microsoft to consider, I suppose, is that
3572580	3578560	it's a lot easier right now to become an affiliate on Twitch and make money, even though you're
3578560	3581680	not going to make much money, but you know, have that door open to the potential to making
3581680	3582860	money like YouTube.
3582860	3585480	A lot of people, it's pretty, or was easy to do on YouTube.
3585480	3587820	Now it's a little harder, but still pretty reasonable, right?
3587820	3592380	You have to have what, 50,000 or 5,000 life views or something on your channel?
3592380	3593380	Yeah.
3593380	3594380	Yeah.
3594380	3598260	Well, I mean, like my channel, which is like, I don't upload anything to it, already has
3598260	3599260	that.
3599260	3600260	Yeah.
3600260	3601260	It's yeah.
3601260	3602260	Right.
3602260	3603260	Is if you've been on there a while, you've, you just kind of hit it naturally.
3603260	3605300	But, um, but anyway, all that aside.
3605300	3609300	So like Beam still doesn't have that where you have that potential to make money.
3609300	3613180	I mean, yes, you can become a partner over there, but the partner requirements are pretty
3613180	3617620	high for a service that still hasn't attracted a ton of people.
3617620	3623320	Now that being said, Microsoft clearly is pushing this forward with their E3 plans is
3623320	3625180	going to be exclusively through this, right?
3625180	3627100	Which we all, we knew this was coming.
3627100	3630420	The minute they bought Beam, we knew if you want to see their E3 stuff, you're going to
3630420	3631420	have to go to Beam.
3631420	3633900	They're not going to put it on Twitch because they want people to go to this new site and
3633900	3634900	check it out.
3634900	3637100	They could be on YouTube or on their own web page.
3637100	3638100	Yeah.
3638100	3641900	Well, you'll be on their own web page will be powered through this Beam thing, the mixer.
3641900	3645700	I'm still going to be calling it Beam, sorry guys, but, um, it's still going to be powered
3645700	3647180	through that whole thing.
3647180	3648180	Yeah.
3648180	3650900	So the other thing that they're adding to that with, um, with that is they're going
3650900	3653060	to be extending it also to mobile.
3653060	3656620	So they're going to have, um, iOS and Android apps that you'll like the broadcast mobile
3656620	3658180	games as well.
3658180	3660300	Um, yeah.
3660300	3661780	So it's interesting.
3661780	3664880	I like the name mixer better than Beam.
3664880	3669940	So it makes me think of audio though, exclusively, I'm kind of surprised that name was available
3669940	3670940	to be honest.
3670940	3673460	I was like, wow, there isn't already a site called mixer somewhere like for audio.
3673460	3676780	I would have thought like an audio thing for sure would have already had that name,
3676780	3682260	but maybe Microsoft bought a company called that a long time ago and now they're taking
3682260	3683260	advantage of that name.
3683260	3684260	Who knows?
3684260	3689380	So, yeah, no, uh, I think, I think it's cool, you know, it's like I said, I think this type
3689380	3690820	of competition is great.
3690820	3695940	Uh, Beam doing the whole 4k thing I think is going to push Twitch to figure out how
3695940	3698900	they can address some of those technical things a little faster.
3698900	3705020	Um, but it will be interesting to see as mixer gets more of an audience and gets E3,
3705020	3710540	are they going to be able to keep this promise of the whole, it is really live streaming
3710540	3715500	because Twitch used to be that way, but then when they got so popular, their servers couldn't
3715500	3716660	handle it.
3716660	3719820	But I think mixer does something with the encoder.
3719820	3724340	Like there is a new encoder that you use to have this because I, I checked it out when
3724340	3728380	I was doing, when I was playing around with Beam for a couple of streams that I did.
3728380	3731380	Um, you have to get a different codec for this.
3731380	3735780	So, you know, I'm sure this all kind of balances out, but it'll be interesting to see when
3735780	3739620	they do get that increased demand, which they're going to get at E3, I hope Microsoft's ready
3739620	3740820	for it.
3740820	3743580	That's all.
3743580	3748620	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I think it was the fact that they were stuck with dot pro
3748620	3752140	and that was the issue because that doesn't work in every country.
3752140	3757780	Uh, they probably bought the domain, but couldn't get beam.com was probably the big
3757780	3758780	issue there.
3758780	3763260	So it was that dot pro and that, yeah, I admit that's kind of a, I mean, why didn't they
3763260	3764940	get beam.tv?
3764940	3766340	Cause Twitch TV works everywhere.
3766340	3767340	Right?
3767340	3768340	Yeah.
3768340	3769780	Why, why was it pro?
3769780	3771540	Because remember Microsoft didn't create it.
3771540	3772540	Some other folks did.
3772540	3776680	So that's just what they beam was to stream or whatever.
3776680	3778180	Get a new webpage because why?
3778180	3779180	Well, they did.
3779180	3780180	They, now they have mixer.
3780220	3784060	It just makes me think of either booze or music.
3784060	3785140	I liked the name beam.
3785140	3786140	I did.
3786140	3787340	I thought, you know, for what it was, but I get it.
3787340	3792220	I mean if the dot pro thing doesn't work everywhere and it is, it is a harder extension name to
3792220	3794340	kind of catch on and you are going to get a lot of people to go.
3794340	3801780	I think if you go to twitch.com, beam slash dot xxx and then everybody would pay attention.
3801780	3802780	I'm actually curious.
3802780	3803780	I hope I don't get porn.
3803780	3804780	Yeah.
3804780	3807980	If you go to twitch.com it just redirects to twitch TV.
3807980	3812500	So even if people didn't know it was a dot TV and you type twitch.com, you're still going
3812500	3816060	to go to the right place and probably beam couldn't really do that.
3816060	3820100	And it might be surprised how much it might've been holding them back.
3820100	3821100	Anyway.
3821100	3822460	Um, cool.
3822460	3826860	I'm curious to see what else they announce, uh, closer to E3 and you know, I, I welcome
3826860	3830100	a little more competition in the streaming space as far as all that goes.
3830100	3832620	I think it's going to keep everybody on their toes and that's great.
3832620	3837140	Uh, we've been talking about this for a couple of weeks on the show and that is Castlevania
3837300	3838300	coming to Netflix.
3838300	3842500	Well, the first trailer came out and I've got some good news, everybody.
3842500	3844220	It's not a live action thing.
3844220	3845220	Yay.
3845220	3849900	Which I, yes, it's a good thing because live action probably, probably would have been
3849900	3850900	cheesy.
3850900	3854100	So it is an anime, uh, and, uh, it is actually not a movie.
3854100	3856500	It's like a television series type of thing.
3856500	3860220	So the trailer is out there and it will debut on Netflix, July 7th.
3860220	3863300	So this is going to be a little sooner than we thought.
3863300	3867060	Um, so I guess they must've been able to keep this a secret for a while before we found
3867060	3869220	out that the Castlevania thing was happening.
3869220	3873820	And I'm sure the production of anime is going to be a little more accelerated than something
3873820	3875540	that is live action.
3875540	3879300	But still that is a pretty fast after we got the announcement in February.
3879300	3883140	Um, so yep, it's an anime.
3883140	3885620	Looks like it might get to be a little bit violent.
3885620	3888300	Looks like it is going to have that tone that goes with it.
3888300	3891700	So I have to admit, I don't watch a ton of, ton of anime.
3891700	3893020	That's nothing against anime.
3893020	3896220	I just, I watch little TV as there is.
3896220	3898340	There's only so many shows I can make time to watch.
3898340	3900580	Um, but I do want to check out this Castlevania thing.
3900580	3901580	That's for sure.
3901580	3902580	It looked, it looked pretty cool.
3902580	3904620	At least the first episode to see if it's worth watching the rest.
3904620	3906020	What'd you guys think of the trailer?
3906020	3907020	It looked cool.
3907020	3908020	Yeah.
3908020	3909020	It looked cool.
3909020	3910020	I like Castlevania three.
3910020	3912900	So I mean, it'll be neat to see what it looks like.
3912900	3913900	Dark Sakura.
3913900	3915900	I know this is a franchise that's near and dear to you.
3915900	3917460	What are your thoughts with all this?
3917460	3918460	It looks cool.
3918460	3919460	Yeah.
3919460	3920460	So you're on board?
3920460	3921460	Maybe.
3921460	3922460	Maybe.
3922460	3923980	I'm in a reserve judgment for watching the first episode.
3923980	3924980	Fair enough.
3924980	3925980	Fair enough.
3926740	3928780	I think it's a good mindset to be in for a lot of people checking in our chat room over
3928780	3933860	at live.vognetwork.com dark Tetsuya says, I'm super hyped for the Castlevania anime.
3933860	3937460	YYR says, I can't wait for the episode with pachise slot machines.
3937460	3942980	A dungeon Buster says, I can't wait for the episode when Belmont finds meat inside a wall
3942980	3943980	and eats it.
3943980	3948660	Dan and I were talking about two and from the looks of it, it looks like it's actually
3948660	3955020	going to be based off of Castlevania three because we, for sure, we thought we saw Saifa
3955020	3956020	and Grant.
3956020	3957020	Yeah.
3957020	3958020	Grant.
3958020	3959660	I thought they had said, it's going to be counseling.
3959660	3963100	I thought they had said at some point, it's gonna be, I think that they did, but it was
3963100	3966220	more of a confirmation just to see the other characters there.
3966220	3967220	Sure.
3967220	3971180	Well, and just because something is inspired by something doesn't mean you're always going
3971180	3972980	to see it accurately represented.
3972980	3974620	Am I right?
3974620	3978220	So, but if you want to all see meat in the wall, I'm going to, I'm going to go a little
3978220	3979220	little.
3979220	3980220	It sounded dirty.
3980220	3981220	Didn't it?
3981220	3982580	I'm going to go a little bit deeper than that though.
3982580	3983580	Nevermind.
3983580	3988820	There's a scene where Belmont kneels and a tornado picks them up and carries them away.
3988820	3989820	That's what I'm waiting for.
3989820	3990820	You think that'll be in the anime?
3990820	3994780	I mean, I know it's the wrong Castlevania game, but there could still be a reference,
3994780	3995780	right?
3995780	3996780	Right.
3996780	3997780	Blink, blink.
3997780	3998780	You don't remember in Simon's quest you had to-
3998780	4001100	Yes, but Simon's quest wasn't great.
4001100	4002100	What?
4002100	4003100	I love Simon's quest.
4003100	4004660	I don't like the curse thing.
4004660	4005780	Oh my God.
4005780	4008180	It just felt like a completely different game.
4008180	4009180	First off-
4009180	4011180	The best of them is Dracula X.
4011180	4014500	Yes, but also one of the best soundtracks in the entire series.
4014500	4021300	Yeah, I had a good soundtrack, but still, I think that Dracula X was like the last actual
4021300	4023940	real Castlevania game.
4023940	4026860	Rage Nator in chat says, wouldn't wall meat be more of a hentai thing?
4026860	4029860	All right, look, when I drink, I choose my words less carefully.
4029860	4031900	I'm not going to bring up the glory hole references.
4031900	4032900	Yeah.
4032900	4033900	Come on, feels so good.
4033900	4036860	Says, there's a place in San Francisco where you can find meat in the walls.
4036860	4037860	Yes.
4037860	4038860	Yes, I'm sure.
4038860	4039860	Yes, I'm sure.
4039860	4040860	You've been to that bathroom.
4041540	4044140	All right, moving on.
4044140	4056060	Well, there is a teaser of sorts by Yotaka Saito, also goes by Ute, who is the person
4056060	4059940	who gave us Seaman for the Dreamcast.
4059940	4061180	Great.
4061180	4064700	From wall meat to, forget it.
4064700	4070860	And he put out a tweet and it says, seemingly any project is being started.
4070860	4071860	Guess what?
4071860	4072860	From the web address on their back.
4072860	4075380	Well, I couldn't read the address because it was really tiny.
4075380	4076380	I did.
4076380	4077380	And I found the webpage.
4077380	4078380	Oh.
4078380	4082380	It's, well, it's Seaman.ai.
4082380	4084020	Okay.
4084020	4086180	So it is Seaman.
4086180	4090860	And Seaman has become a bit of a joke on the show.
4090860	4094460	Oh yes, we love Seaman here at Orchons Radio.
4094460	4099100	We really, we really like Seaman here at O.L.R.
4099100	4101300	We're so friendly.
4101300	4107340	For those not familiar with Seaman, please allow me to take this opportunity to edumacate
4107340	4110820	you with one of our favorite YouTubes on the subject.
4110820	4116060	And full credit for this goes to YouTube user Samination, who uploaded this video in April
4116060	4117420	of 2008.
4117420	4119060	So it's 10 years old.
4119060	4124260	But here's a little bit of Sam, I'm assuming his name is, here's a little bit of Sam interacting
4124260	4125900	with the fish.
4125900	4129660	So you can hear Sam sounds a little tinny, like he's on a microphone, and the fish has
4129660	4133100	a very deep, vasey voice as Seaman did.
4133100	4134100	So here you go.
4134100	4135980	A little bit of interaction here.
4135980	4140500	If my calculations are correct, you must be a Libra.
4140500	4144460	I'll bet you get crushes on people all the time, huh?
4144460	4147300	Just don't get any ideas about me.
4147300	4149500	Let's just be friends.
4149500	4151500	For now.
4152500	4155500	I'll friend your butt.
4155500	4158500	Are you coming on to me?
4158500	4160500	Yes.
4160500	4162500	Yes!
4164500	4167500	Put this tongue in that mouth.
4167500	4170500	Dream on.
4170500	4176500	So, obviously the technology's probably come a long way thanks to things like Siri and
4176500	4180500	stuff like that, so if they do make a new Seaman game, I'm really interested to see
4180500	4184500	Think of how sophisticated that is for the Dreamcast.
4184500	4188500	Dude, we all know the Dreamcast was so fucking far ahead of its time.
4188500	4192500	Things like Phantasy Star Online and what that brought to online gaming.
4192500	4195500	The Dreamcast was ahead of its time, rest in peace.
4195500	4200500	But yeah, things like Siri and OK Google or all the other stuff.
4200500	4202500	Whatever that stupid Alexa thing.
4202500	4207500	Yeah, all that stuff is like, this is the oldest version of that.
4207500	4209500	So it'd be kind of neat.
4209500	4215500	As silly and as kitschus' game is, it would be cool to see it come back in this day and age.
4215500	4222500	We also had, not too long after that, on the Nintendo 64, there was the Hey You Pikachu,
4222500	4224500	or as it was in Japan, Pikachu Genki Dichu.
4224500	4226500	Oh yeah, I forgot Hey You Pikachu.
4226500	4229500	That's right, that was around the same time.
4229500	4233500	Dark Tetsuya in chat says, I was just playing my Dreamcast.
4233500	4237500	Granted, it was more Crazy Taxi than Seaman, but still.
4237500	4241500	Anytime I ever hear an Offspring song, and it doesn't even have to be the one that was in Crazy Taxi,
4241500	4244500	but anytime I hear an Offspring song, I think about the Dreamcast.
4244500	4246500	Or Bad Religion.
4246500	4248500	Well, it's more the...
4248500	4250500	It's just that, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
4250500	4252500	Every time you hear that, it's like...
4252500	4255500	Dexter's voice evokes the Dreamcast.
4255500	4257500	Exactly.
4259500	4265500	Alright, well, good luck to those that are producing Seaman remake right now.
4265500	4270500	Yes, just don't drain your resources.
4270500	4272500	That's right.
4272500	4274500	Loki, what's up next?
4274500	4280500	So, you may remember we talked a little bit about this Xbox Game Pass subscription service that they're going to have,
4280500	4289500	where you can play, I guess, older Xbox One and classic Xbox 360 titles on your Xbox One,
4289500	4291500	with a paid subscription each month.
4292500	4295500	So it was going to be $10 a month, and they would have different titles to play.
4295500	4297500	Well, it's actually going to be launching pretty soon.
4297500	4300500	It's coming June 1st, and you'll be able to check it out.
4300500	4306500	They have a 14-day trial if you are an Xbox Live Gold member, which you probably are if you're playing multiplayer.
4306500	4312500	However, Gold membership is not required for the service, just if you want to play multiplayer.
4312500	4315500	And it's going to cost $9.99 a month.
4315500	4322500	So yeah, some of the titles they've got in there, it looks like Saints Row, Mad Max, some of the Bioshock games,
4322500	4326500	Gears of War, the Mega Man collection, Halo 5.
4326500	4331500	So, I mean, it looks like a pretty decent selection, and $9.99 is not bad.
4331500	4334500	I mean, if I had an Xbox, maybe it might be worth it, but...
4334500	4341500	I have not jumped on right away to check this out, but I am super tempted right now to take advantage of that trial,
4341500	4343500	and jump in there and play a bunch of stuff.
4343500	4346500	And it's not all streaming. Take note, Sony.
4346500	4352500	You can download the games to your console, which, honestly, should be the way it works.
4352500	4355500	Like, this PlayStation Now service thing? Stupid.
4355500	4358500	Just put the damn emulators out there.
4359500	4360500	Alright, we'll see, we'll see.
4360500	4364500	Alright, something to look forward to in the future.
4364500	4370500	Well, maybe. I don't know if everybody's looking forward to this, but I think it could be interesting.
4370500	4375500	It looks like we have confirmation that a Mario Cross Rabbids game is happening.
4375500	4382500	We had heard some rumors and some things out there previously that Nintendo was about to announce this when they unveiled the Switch,
4382500	4386500	but this game ended up getting delayed behind the scenes to the fall,
4386500	4389500	and so they didn't end up announcing this when they announced the Switch.
4389500	4392500	But this looks like almost a certainty that this is something we're going to see at E3.
4392500	4398500	So, yes, Mario Cross Rabbids does look like it's going to be real. Certainly, that art is out there.
4398500	4403500	Some of the art has put in, and some of the other rumors that have been collected about this game so far.
4403500	4409500	Apparently, there is exploration, which is about 35% of the game, and combat makes up 65% of the game.
4409500	4414500	Note that this isn't Ubisoft's answer necessarily to Super Mario RPG.
4414500	4419500	It is and it isn't, because the fighting in this game is supposed to be more tactical in style,
4419500	4423500	so think something a little more Fire Emblem-ish or Final Fantasy Tactics
4423500	4427500	than necessarily what you saw in Super Mario RPG and what Square Enix brought to the table.
4427500	4430500	That's what the rumor is saying anyway with this so far.
4430500	4434500	There are supposed to be four twisted Mario worlds that are filled with Easter eggs.
4434500	4440500	The characters that will be available in the game, Mario, Luigi, Peach, Yoshi,
4440500	4445500	and Rabbids that are dressed up as Mario, Luigi, Peach, and Yoshi.
4445500	4450500	And if you haven't seen the picture yet, there is a Rabbid that's dressed up as Peach
4450500	4454500	that's pretty perfect taking a selfie and all this other silly stuff.
4454500	4460500	The game is estimated to be about 20 hours long and you're supposed to be able to co-op in this game as well.
4460500	4461500	That'll be pretty cool.
4461500	4466500	Mario uses guns in the game, but when I see the gun, that looks like a bullet bill gun,
4466500	4469500	so, you know, Mario guns. Don't think anything too crazy.
4469500	4471500	Honestly, when I saw it, it reminded me of Mega Man.
4471500	4475500	Oh, yeah, like the Mega Burst. It does a little bit. It does a little bit.
4475500	4482500	Now, what I thought was interesting is that they describe the characters in one of these pieces of promo art,
4482500	4488500	and they call Mario the leader, Luigi the eagle eye, Yoshi the explosive head.
4488500	4494500	They call the princess the badass princess, which, look, she is a badass princess,
4494500	4503500	but I was just a little surprised that Nintendo let the word ass be used next to one of their characters.
4503500	4506500	So I was just, that was a little surprising, that's all.
4507500	4513500	And then the rabid princess says, hashtag sassy, hashtag no filter.
4513500	4515500	It me.
4517500	4520500	Anyway, so, yeah, I want to see some gameplay.
4520500	4524500	I mean, all we know now is like rumors and some, you know, screenshots.
4524500	4527500	Well, not even really screenshots, like one screenshot on this little mock-up with the Switch
4527500	4530500	and some character mock-ups, but obviously there's much more to be seen,
4530500	4537500	and this seems like almost a given for E3 at this point, and the Nintendo Direct that will be around that time.
4537500	4540500	Or the Ubisoft. Well, probably Nintendo Direct.
4540500	4545500	Yeah. Rama in chat says, the badass princess is Daisy, not Peach.
4545500	4549500	Well, you know where Daisy is in this game, Rama? Nowhere to be seen.
4549500	4551500	Womp womp.
4551500	4554500	Not yet, anyway. We'll see what happens at E3.
4554500	4556500	That'd be thwomp thwomp.
4556500	4558500	Thwomp thwomp. I like that.
4558500	4560500	Alright, moving on, Dark Saga.
4560500	4565500	Mass Effect stuff, because it's not a show without Mass Effect references.
4567500	4571500	For those of us who beat the game before there were any patches or anything,
4571500	4581500	we had a hint to what happened to the Quarian arc, the Kila Sia, which also had Ilkor, Hanar, Drell, and Volus.
4581500	4584500	That sounds like a disaster waiting to happen.
4584500	4586500	Sounds like a party in space.
4586500	4590500	That sounds like a major disaster. Anyway...
4590500	4593500	Excited. Welcome to the party.
4596500	4606500	Anyway, there was another mission that came out, one of the Apex missions, that had a result from it that says,
4606500	4608500	and I don't care if it's a spoiler,
4608500	4614500	Analysis trying to boost the signal, unknown if, and then text seems to be helping even if we don't know the blank,
4614500	4617500	back to Kila Sia, blank, way home.
4617500	4623500	Meaning that they're hinting very strongly at a DLC related to the Quarian arc.
4623500	4629500	Of course, we don't know if that came out before or after they put the freeze on Mass Effect stuff,
4629500	4636500	but I would hope that if they pushed it that much and made so many references to it, that they would follow through.
4636500	4644500	Yeah, I mean, not to go too back to that place of negativity around all the rumored on-ice stuff with Mass Effect,
4644500	4649500	but I would hope this game gets to see at least some of its DLC realized,
4649500	4656500	so that whatever story they were trying to tell can kind of get the completion that it deserves.
4656500	4662500	But maybe we'll see an Andromeda 2 in several years when they can hand it off to a different studio or something,
4662500	4667500	and they figure out how they're going to rework that and erase the negativity that was out there on the internet,
4667500	4670500	that I think was a little much, but what else is new?
4670500	4675500	So far, the only actual Quarian reference we have besides this is the Regar Carbine.
4675500	4678500	Bam. Which really isn't that great of a weapon.
4678500	4686500	Plus, it would be nice if they could somehow introduce the Quarians and even some of these other races into the Andromeda universe,
4686500	4688500	then multiplayer could expand with all that too.
4688500	4690500	They can bring back the Quarian Engineer.
4690500	4693500	That would be great. I love the Quarian Engineer.
4693500	4696500	Anyway, we'll see what happens.
4696500	4700500	Just a few more stories for you guys, then the classic game of the week.
4700500	4701500	But first, Loki.
4701500	4707500	So, this is kind of a stretch, but I will go ahead and cover it.
4707500	4712500	It's a slow news week, so we're letting some things slip through this week.
4713500	4714500	Alright, anyways.
4714500	4721500	So, during the Webby Awards, I guess where Pokemon Go won the best mobile game and four other awards,
4721500	4734500	the Product Marketing Lead, Arshit Bhargava, he had his acceptance speech or whatever,
4734500	4736500	and the last thing he said was,
4736500	4738500	This summer will be legendary.
4738500	4741500	Hint, hint, nudge, nudge, wink, wink.
4741500	4748500	Which people think, oh my god, legendary Pokemon are coming this summer, oh my god.
4748500	4752500	Well, if they're going to do it, this is the time to do it.
4752500	4761500	Because summer being when all the kids are out of school, when the climate, at least here in the Northern Hemisphere, sorry Australia,
4761500	4766500	is going to be, you know, really good weather to be going outside and playing all this stuff,
4766500	4769500	this is the time to do it, if they're doing a legendary event.
4769500	4775500	Now, I thought they were going to do actual live events like Ingress does the live events,
4775500	4778500	but those Ingress live events have been on hold.
4778500	4781500	They haven't done them since, just so you guys know, because you guys may not, you know,
4781500	4783500	I know some of you still play Pokemon Go.
4783500	4787500	Here's what's going on with their other game, Ingress, because a lot of this is really important.
4787500	4793500	One, the engine that Ingress is written on is no longer supported, it's like a really old thing.
4793500	4798500	So they're having to create an Ingress 2.0, it's being confirmed that that's happening,
4798500	4803500	we just don't know when, but they are building it in Unity, which is the same platform that Pokemon goes on.
4803500	4805500	So, Ingress 2.0 is happening.
4805500	4811500	And I think partially because of that, we have not seen an Ingress live event happen in the past six months.
4812500	4816500	The last Ingress live events, and I actually went to one, was in Chicago in November.
4816500	4819500	It was on Veterans Day last year. It's been that long.
4819500	4824500	Now, just last weekend, because I had some friends that went to this,
4824500	4829500	they did this thing called Magnus Reawakens in the Redwood Forest.
4829500	4833500	So they did it out, which is funny because there's no cell signal out there.
4833500	4838500	However, they had Wi-Fi, and they did this whole event, like it almost sounded like Nerd Burning Man in a way to me.
4838500	4842500	It was out in the forest, and people were building portals.
4842500	4848500	They brought artistic creations that were then turned into temporary portals on site.
4848500	4851500	I mean, all things considered, it actually sounded like a really rad thing,
4851500	4854500	and everybody who went that I knew had a great time.
4854500	4857500	I just didn't want to fucking go camping for three days, so I didn't go.
4857500	4860500	I was like, bring me back some stuff. They brought me back some nice stuff.
4860500	4863500	For one, I'm going to hack the giant cock they just made.
4864500	4870500	So anyway, I tell you all that because at the end of that, they announced, Niantic announced,
4870500	4876500	anomalies are coming back, and here are all the cities for the rest of the year.
4876500	4880500	So we know the anomalies now for Ingress through December 2nd.
4880500	4886500	And I think the first wave, I think it all starts August 29th, question mark?
4886500	4888500	Any of them in our neighborhood?
4888500	4891500	Yes, San Francisco on December 2nd is the closest.
4891500	4894500	They haven't done one in Sacramento for a long, long time.
4894500	4897500	But San Francisco is pretty good.
4897500	4905500	So for us, San Francisco is the closest. Portland, Oregon is August's event.
4905500	4911500	And Boulder, Colorado is in early November. Those are the West Coast events, basically.
4911500	4921500	Anyway, the reason why I say all that is because my assumption was that Niantic would do live events for Legendaries,
4921500	4924500	because that's kind of the impression they gave us in that original trailer.
4924500	4931500	Now, to be fair, how much of that original trailer stuff is actually Pokémon GO? Not much, right?
4931500	4935500	So, you know, maybe they are going to do Legendaries just as an event that's available everywhere,
4935500	4940500	because trying to do live events everywhere is going to be, I mean, you know,
4940500	4947500	if they were to announce a live event for Legendaries in San Francisco, like, I don't think the city,
4947500	4952500	the city of San Francisco could handle the amount of people that would show up.
4952500	4954500	Yes, there are that many people still playing Pokémon GO.
4954500	4960500	And if like only San Francisco had this event, you'd have the entirety of like Northern and Southern California Pokémon GO players,
4960500	4963500	and then some showing up. Like, it's way more than Ingress.
4963500	4968500	So I wonder if they just, they are realizing that they can't do these live events for Pokémon GO.
4968500	4971500	There's just too damn many people to play it. Still.
4971500	4977500	Or, if, you know, again, the Ingress stuff isn't starting back up until August,
4977500	4983500	my assumption was that that's because probably 2.0 for Ingress is out during the summer.
4983500	4985500	So you didn't reset everybody's stats on that stuff?
4985500	4988500	On Ingress? Oh, hell no. They're not going to reset people's stats.
4988500	4995500	They're, people would up and leave. You know, they've sold codes that are in-game badges, things like that.
4995500	5000500	That has to carry over. They could expand the end game, they could make new agent levels, you know,
5000500	5003500	and a new version of the scanner would make room for that.
5003500	5007500	There's always been rumors about, ooh, what's going to be for level 24 and all that stuff.
5007500	5009500	But, you know, that's all to be determined for Ingress.
5009500	5013500	Anyway, I don't mean to take this on and on just talking about Ingress,
5013500	5017500	but I think obviously the two do relate, being that it's a company that makes Pokémon GO.
5017500	5022500	I just think that they're going to have to either do an event like they've been doing these other types of events
5022500	5031500	that are just kind of for everybody, or maybe they will do a bunch of cities, you know, on a particular July
5031500	5034500	since, you know, the Ingress stuff doesn't start until August. I don't know.
5034500	5038500	What do you think, Logie? Do you think it's just going to be an event, or do you think we could actually have live events?
5038500	5043500	They may try it, and if it fails, then they just won't do them anymore.
5043500	5048500	But I can't see it would be bad PR if, like, all of a sudden, you know, they do an event in San Francisco
5048500	5052500	and it just, like, clogs San Francisco. I mean, that's good PR right there.
5052500	5053500	Yeah, right?
5053500	5056500	That's just like, holy shit, you know, this is still popular.
5056500	5060500	Well, I remember when they did the Pokémon World Championships in San Francisco,
5060500	5064500	they actually had to close it off to the public, and they said,
5064500	5069500	nothing Pokémon GO will be happening here. Don't come if you're coming for Pokémon GO.
5069500	5074500	Because they were worried that there were people, there were rumors on the internet that,
5075500	5078500	oh, the legendaries are going to spawn at the Pokémon World Championships,
5078500	5083500	and people were already planning to go from very far away to be one of the first to catch a fuckup,
5083500	5087500	because that was right at the hype of Pokémon GO hysteria was right during that time.
5087500	5088500	Yeah.
5088500	5093500	So they actually had to come out and say, if you're coming for Pokémon GO, don't come.
5093500	5095500	We win anyway.
5095500	5099500	But I had a good time. I had a good time. We shopped at the little Pokémon Center that they had set up there,
5099500	5101500	and, you know, it was a good time.
5101500	5107500	Alright, anyway, so we'll see what ends up happening in Pokémon GO with legendary events,
5107500	5111500	but I'm sure those seasonal events they've been doing have been working very well for them.
5111500	5116500	Yeah, I like those. I'm not excited about the rock type one, but that's fine.
5116500	5121500	I hope they do more of those, because those are kind of, like, after they end, it's like, ehhh.
5121500	5123500	How about more fire ones? Hello, Charizard.
5123500	5125500	Yeah, fire event would be nice.
5125500	5127500	That would seem like a gimme.
5128500	5131500	DarkSakura was reminded to catch a Pokémon today, because I can see it on her phone.
5131500	5133500	Oh, because there's a Rattata in your yard.
5133500	5135500	Oh, well, thank you for...
5135500	5139500	I've now made a vow to never catch another Paras. Ever.
5139500	5141500	I don't want to.
5141500	5142500	Because they are fucking...
5142500	5143500	Everywhere.
5143500	5144500	And terribad.
5144500	5145500	Everywhere.
5145500	5149500	Well, you know what else is everywhere, but it's actually kind of good, is Monster Hunter.
5149500	5151500	You like that transition?
5151500	5155500	Monster Hunter Double Cross, or Monster Hunter XX, if you will.
5155500	5159500	This is going to be coming out on the Switch. That was announced this past week. That's pretty exciting.
5159500	5165500	We don't know the day, we don't know the pricing yet, but it will be coming out on the Nintendo Switch.
5165500	5169500	And, from what I understand, this is pretty interesting, because Shane and I were talking about it in the car the other day,
5169500	5173500	and he was following this a little closer, because I don't get super into the Monster Hunter games,
5173500	5179500	but he pointed out that the Monster Hunter on Switch is going to be able to talk to the 3DS version.
5179500	5185500	And that's a pretty big reveal for a feature in the Switch, is the fact that it can play with 3DS people.
5185500	5189500	So, hmm, who knows what that could bring for the future.
5189500	5192500	It could just be a one-time thing, but it's worth putting out there.
5192500	5205500	So, anyway, let's also talk about Ultra Street Fighter 2, the final challenge on the Nintendo Switch,
5205500	5211500	which of course was released this past week, and I'm sorry, it is called Ultra Street Fighter 2, I don't know why, sorry guys.
5211500	5214500	All that stuff that Dark Soccer is giving me is starting to take hold.
5214500	5218500	Anyway, so for Ultra Street Fighter 2, that just released this past week,
5218500	5227500	and there was some talk over on certain forums that talked about how well Capcom has actually said
5227500	5233500	that their future plans for the Switch can kind of hinge on the sales of Ultra Street Fighter 2.
5233500	5239500	And understandably, this pissed a lot of people off, because it's like, wow, way to set up your expectations for fucking failure,
5239500	5245500	and all those things we pointed out at the beginning of the show about how, you know, 40 bucks for this is a pretty tough pill to swallow.
5245500	5252500	However, the translation, as it was originally translated, was found to be a little erroneous.
5252500	5259500	So, the official translation, or I guess not even official, but the retranslation, if you will, said something a little bit more like,
5259500	5265500	we will plan our support while looking at the situation of the platform.
5265500	5272500	So, not necessarily saying that the expectations are based on the sales of Street Fighter 2, but more keeping an eye on the Switch.
5272500	5279500	You know, the fact that they're releasing Monster Hunter Double Cross on it is a little more promising,
5279500	5286500	because that's a game that will probably sell a little better, depending on how Monster Hunter can succeed here in the US.
5287500	5293500	But, the game that really needs to be on the fucking Switch is that Disney Afternoon Collection.
5293500	5296500	Why is that still not on the Switch?
5296500	5300500	Anyway, let's see, going to our chat.
5300500	5306500	Dartusuya says that Monster Hunter Double Cross has been dated, it's August 25th, at least in Japan.
5306500	5315500	YYR says, there was a NeoGAF thread called, which will sell more copies, Street Fighter 5 or Ultra Street Fighter 2?
5316500	5323500	I'm going to say Street Fighter 5, because you can already get it on sale cheaper than you can get Ultra Street Fighter 2.
5323500	5325500	And that's saying something right there.
5325500	5338500	And I understand that it came out earlier, but you're talking to Street Fighter that they just basically shoehorned a couple of characters in there that are really kind of, eh, it's not like a big deal or anything.
5338500	5344500	They're reskins, it's Evil Ryu and Violent Ken, they're just reskins, it's nothing that special.
5344500	5346500	It just doesn't seem worth the money.
5346500	5360500	And let's assume that the translation wasn't incorrect, then I think it's a stupid thing to hinge all your bets on the system based off one game that's really a port of a really old game.
5360500	5362500	Well, but if it's not what they said, then they didn't sell it.
5362500	5365500	Yeah, I understand that, but I know Konami in the past have done this.
5365500	5372500	That's true, there have been other companies that have said, well, if this game doesn't sell, then I guess we're done.
5372500	5376500	You're right, and Konami's been one of those companies when it comes to some of the music games.
5376500	5382500	And it's always shitty. Well, you know what, it's not up to, you're the one that has to make those decisions.
5382500	5391500	It's not up to the consumer to decide, you know, if you're going to support a platform, it's a gaming platform if you just choose not to support it because of whatever.
5391500	5396500	It's not going to be because people didn't buy your fucking old ass game that you ported to the system for way too much money.
5397500	5408500	And this can't be stressed enough, and we said this all the time when it came to Konami and their subpar releases of like DDR in the US and BeatMania and all that stuff is, you have to take a risk to get a reward.
5408500	5423500	You have to. If you take these low risk things and you go, oh, people will buy it anyway because, no, these low risk things, which Ultra Street Fighter 2 I think falls in that category, are going to open themselves up more to this, you know, bullshit on the internet.
5423500	5429500	Yeah, look at some of the stuff they did with the Wii. Tatsunoko vs Capcom. That was a game that was exclusive to that platform.
5429500	5442500	Yeah. I mean, that was pretty advantageous. Do another one of those. I mean, that would be pretty exciting. That's a brand new game. It was a different engine. It ran on the Wii, so you can't tell me that that shit does not run on the fucking Switch.
5443500	5456500	And yes, I understand that fucking that was a licensed game with Tatsunoko or whatever, but take that engine and make a Street Fighter game out of it or something, or do something crazy with it. Put some other Capcom characters in there.
5456500	5467500	Do another Street Fighter vs Capcom game or something. You can make it exclusive. Put some effort into it. And that would be worth $40 or even $60 if it's a really good game.
5467500	5477500	Not this, oh hey, it's a Street Fighter 2. Yeah, people love it. Yeah, people have purchased that game probably dozens of times. They don't need to purchase it again to play.
5477500	5488500	I mean, let's play this way. If you purchase a 3DS and you purchase Street Fighter 4 3D with it, how often did you play that against other people? I mean, just look at that.
5488500	5495500	I mean, this is probably how much you're going to use this system to play Street Fighter 2. Yeah, you may do it for a while, but then newer shit's going to come out and people are going to stop playing it.
5495500	5502500	And that's what's going to happen. It's not worth the $40. $20? Then that might be alright. $40? No, I don't think so.
5503500	5513500	Alright. Well, you know what? Let's take a trip down memory lane, you guys. Let's take a trip back. Back to when we paid $80 for Street Fighter 2 on the Super Nintendo.
5513500	5522500	And we fucking liked it. We loved it. It was legendary. Now, that's not the classic game of the week this week. Probably because that was done years and years ago.
5522500	5529500	However, Dark Sakura's going to step into the gaming vault and find another game that she thinks, hey, you know what? You should respect this game.
5529500	5539500	And by respect, that means don't charge $40 for it on Switch. Right, Dark Sakura? Yes, and it's an oldie. This is a very oldie game this week. Yeah.
5539500	5552500	The game I picked is Radar Scope by Nintendo, which was released in Japan December 1979. And we got it almost a year later in 1980, November in the US.
5552500	5566500	Radar Scope was a fairly early arcade game. You can tell from the ear. And the noise. But it wasn't Nintendo's first arcade game.
5566500	5576500	It was a shooter that kind of can be considered a cross between Space Invaders and Galaxian. It's kind of on a tilted plane.
5576500	5586500	And it had three different cabinets. You had an upright, a cockpit, and a cocktail. It really wasn't that popular. It was considered a failure.
5586500	5601500	But it is, I think, relatively unique for all of the little alien shooters that were out of that time. Because in the early days of gaming, I mean, really you just had more of the same kind of game for a while.
5601500	5607500	Until someone would make an innovation, release a certain type of game, and then you would have more games like it that played on the theme.
5607500	5617500	So we had Space Fighters for a long time, you know. But anyway, this was also the first game that Miyamoto helped develop.
5618500	5631500	It had the big innovation. It was the three-dimensional third-person perspective that was also used later in games like Juno First by Konami and Beam Rider by Activision.
5631500	5645500	And this game was actually considered second only to Pac-Man in Japan in popularity for a while. Even though it wasn't considered, you know, successful commercially.
5645500	5654500	But Donkey Kong was released on Radarscope's hardware. And it used surplus Radarscope cabinets.
5654500	5664500	So kind of interesting how this ties into other things that came later by Nintendo.
5664500	5678500	The earlier Nintendo games were EVR Space, Computer Othello, Sheriff that was released in the US by Exedy as Bandito, Space Fever, and Space Firebird.
5678500	5686500	So anyways, as far as the game, you have to defend your station against enemy spaceships.
5687500	5697500	And they attack and then go back into formation, kind of like Galaxian, and you have to destroy the 48 ships before you lose your space ports.
5697500	5713500	You also have rapid fire laser blasters that zooms the lasers onto this field so that it's kind of like a semi three-dimensional field of curved vectors that can shoot the enemies down.
5713500	5720500	And your laser blasters have a damage meter that light up as, you know, they're damaged and bingo.
5720500	5729500	And it also will weaken your offensive ability and you gain ability by attacking and destroying the enemies.
5729500	5734500	And like I said, the game was popular for a short while in Japan.
5735500	5742500	And the president of Nintendo of America at that time wanted a large order for it.
5742500	5751500	By the time it arrived in New York, the buzz kind of de-buzzed. It sobered.
5751500	5755500	And then no one really wanted to play it.
5755500	5761500	And on top of that, as you can hear this chirping sound in the background on the game, it kind of annoyed people.
5761500	5765500	Yeah, it's not the most audio friendly yet, but again, you have to consider the year.
5765500	5774500	This is before, this was 1980, right? This is what? This is at least like five years before doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.
5774500	5777500	So, you know, older.
5777500	5787500	Well, basically they were left with so many unsold units after this that Nintendo was actually heading toward a financial crash.
5788500	5798500	So, the president at the time, his name was Minoru Arakawa, he reached out to his father-in-law who was Nintendo's CEO.
5798500	5802500	By the way, this was the president of Nintendo of America, not Nintendo Japan.
5802500	5807500	His father-in-law was the CEO of Nintendo in general.
5808500	5818500	Basically, he begged for a new game that could come out, so that's when it was put out to make another game using that hardware.
5818500	5825500	Pretty much to convert it. And so, Miyamoto's idea was chosen and that became Donkey Kong.
5825500	5829500	So, they released them. A lot of them were via conversion kits.
5829500	5841500	So, basically of the 3,000 units that were created for a radar scope, 2,000 of them got converted to Donkey Kong.
5841500	5846500	And you can tell which ones are converted because of the red cabinets.
5846500	5850500	So, if you find one with a red cabinet, chances are it was converted radar scope.
5850500	5856500	And there you go. If not for this game, there would be no Donkey Kong.
5856500	5862500	This game has that classic Nintendo font. I don't know how else to describe it.
5862500	5872500	The way things are written and the hardware, it is very similar to what you see in the later Nintendo games like Donkey Kong.
5872500	5875500	That kind of semi-rounded pixelated.
5875500	5878500	Yeah, it has a very distinct look to it, I think.
5878500	5883500	I wanted to bring this up because Donkey Kong is considered one of the major classics.
5883500	5884500	Sure.
5884500	5887500	But would it have existed if this game hadn't failed?
5887500	5890500	Great question. Awesome. Well, thank you for that.
5890500	5893500	Alright, there it is. Your classic game of the week.
5893500	5897500	We are going to take a quick break. When we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio,
5897500	5902500	we're going to talk a little bit more about Donkey Kong because there's a very interesting something something happening.
5902500	5903500	Donkey Kang.
5903500	5909500	Donkey Kang and Princess Zordla. We'll be talking about that when we come back.
5909500	5913500	You know that meme is fake as hell. That did not actually happen on Jeopardy. I hope you all know.
5913500	5915500	It's on Snopes if you want to look it up. But anyway.
5915500	5916500	It's so funny.
5916500	5920500	We'll talk a little bit about Far Cry 5 because I know there's been a lot of talk about that.
5920500	5927500	And we're going to talk about, Dark Soccer's going to be excited about this, a new soundtrack of an old game on an old medium.
5927500	5928500	That I can't afford.
5928500	5933500	That you can't afford. But, you know, maybe she starts collecting the biddies on Twitch.
5933500	5934500	She could afford it in five years.
5934500	5935500	I have no idea what that is.
5935500	5936500	It's fine.
5936500	5940500	I don't Twitch. Although I will be going back to doing the next installment of How to a Full Boyfriend.
5940500	5941500	You got to start somewhere. Yes, start somewhere.
5941500	5945500	Alright, when we come back. And more vodka because my glass is now empty, y'all.
5945500	5950500	If you can't already tell. When we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
5950500	5962500	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio Memorial Day Weekend Edition.
5962500	5967500	This is Episode 688 for May 28th of 2017.
5967500	5971500	If you're just joining us live at the Voice of Geeks Network, being that it is a three-day weekend,
5971500	5980500	we're partaking a little bit in some beverages of an adult kind, including this 7-Up or Sprite, whatever,
5980500	5986500	same thing, mixed with this ginger vodka that Dark Soccer makes that is amazing when it's mixed together.
5986500	5990500	It tastes like ginger beer, but it's fucking me up. It's great. I like this. So, kudos.
5990500	5992500	It was a little bit too strong for me.
5992500	5994500	I love strong ginger.
5994500	5995500	It was one of my experiments.
5995500	5996500	Yeah.
5996500	6000500	And I can eat crystallized ginger, but the vodka came out, like that first drink, it burns.
6000500	6001500	Yeah.
6001500	6002500	And then it's sweet.
6002500	6004500	Well, I think the mixing helped. You tried it mixed. I think that helps a lot.
6004500	6005500	I did. It was pretty good.
6005500	6008500	Yeah. I tried a little bit of your other one that you talked about earlier, the Violet one.
6008500	6009500	The Parma Violet?
6009500	6013500	Yeah. That wasn't bad, but it was just like, I really just wanted more ginger.
6013500	6015500	It's probably a little more froofy in flavor.
6015500	6017500	Yeah. A little bit. A little bit.
6017500	6018500	Well, I will make you more of this.
6018500	6019500	Yeah.
6019500	6020500	I'll make you a lot more of it if you want.
6020500	6023500	Well, I appreciate that. Thank you very much. So, um-
6023500	6024500	And of course, candy corn.
6024500	6026500	Yeah, the candy corn one. I haven't touched it yet.
6026500	6028500	I wonder if the candy corn and the ginger would be good together.
6028500	6032500	Uh, we won't find out because I may have just finished off the ginger.
6032500	6033500	Oops.
6033500	6035500	There's a little bit left. There's a little bit. Probably enough for a shot.
6035500	6038500	I'll need to take the jar home then if you're going to finish it tonight.
6038500	6039500	Yeah, no worries.
6039500	6040500	Okay.
6040500	6043500	So anyway, I had to ask Darksire. I'm like, oh, I'm not drinking too much because I don't know how strong this stuff is.
6043500	6046500	This would be deceptively strong stuff, but I'm, I'm definitely feeling buzzed.
6046500	6052500	I don't think I'm at that like full on like point yet, which is probably good because, you know, I am still trying to do a radio show.
6052500	6054500	But yeah, I'm feeling, I'm feeling pretty good.
6054500	6061500	Uh, something else I'm feeling good about. So for the first time, uh, this past weekend, I didn't talk about this yet, but I got to do,
6061500	6066500	because it was our, our pal Shane's birthday a few days ago, so he wanted to do an escape room for his birthday.
6066500	6070500	So I got to do an escape room for the first time. We went to a place all the way in San Jose.
6070500	6074500	I don't know why. Well, I know why we couldn't do one here because Shane researched.
6074500	6081500	He said, I only want to do an escape room if it's a multi-room and you don't, you're not, you don't have somebody in there with you.
6081500	6086500	And like all this other stuff that's this monitor through cameras. So he found this place to go to, so I got to do an escape room for the first time.
6086500	6091500	I got to say it was a lot of fun. Like it was, uh, it was like four different rooms. It was like a room.
6091500	6096500	Then we went into like a hallway and then there was like two more rooms after that.
6096500	6102500	And there were some puzzles we had to solve and they were, they were kind of tough. Like, uh, we had to get a hint on the last one.
6102500	6108500	Um, you, you were allowed to use one hint in each room you went into and we didn't use a hint up until the very last room.
6108500	6113500	And it was one of those things where it was like, I was coming to that conclusion, but we only had five minutes left.
6113500	6121500	But with the, uh, with the hint, we got out of there with two minutes to spare. So that was exciting. So, but yeah, I got to do my first escape room experience. Cool.
6121500	6128500	It was cool because it was like, you had the cool, like you had like, if you got the code, you put it in the number pad and when you hit the number pad, the lights would change.
6128500	6132500	And then when you were like stepping on certain platforms, the gate would open to let you in the next room.
6132500	6139500	Like there was just like, there was cool, like James Bond shit like that. And that's what I was hoping for in my escape rooms. So it was, it was a good time.
6139500	6147500	Yeah, it was kind of, it was like doing a video game, but IRL and pretty serious puzzles. All right, let's get into some, uh, rapid fire news.
6147500	6153500	Actually, I want to mention our chat over at live.vognetwork.com. Vidpower mentions escape room designers always amaze me.
6153500	6161500	You know, if I remember right, Vidpower lives in Las Vegas. And I was just thinking, Shane was saying that the escape rooms he's done, he hasn't done any that are as good as the ones in Las Vegas.
6161500	6168500	I'm thinking, oh, Orlando's theme park center. You're not going to find anything better than there. I bet Las Vegas has some killer escape rooms.
6168500	6175500	I'll have to, I'll have to look into that. We'll see. Anyway, uh, yeah. Brad from Pop Culture says, sounds cool. Yeah, it was a good time. Good time.
6175500	6178500	All right. Uh, let's get into some rapid fire news. Loki.
6178500	6185500	So Grand Theft Auto online has been expanding and expanding and expanding and more expansions. Well, there's even more expansions coming.
6186500	6196500	This time they're going to be adding Gunrunning. So you'll be able to add that to your criminal enterprise as a way to diversify your cash income.
6196500	6203500	So what they're going to have along with that, apparently they're going to have these different hatches.
6203500	6209500	So they're mysterious properties that you'll find, I guess, with the Maze Bank foreclosure sites.
6209500	6221500	And there's like some underground warehouses, stuff that you can purchase and they even have like weapon ranges you can check out your different guns with.
6221500	6230500	And they're even seeing your military grade vehicles. Um, so that's all very cool. And of course, like all the other DLC that they've had for Grand Theft Auto online, it's free.
6230500	6241500	So I got to check that out. I still haven't gotten back to Grand Theft Auto online. I'm kind of not sure. I don't know if I can import my progress from when I was playing a console because I think I'm too late for that.
6241500	6250500	But it'll be kind of fun to go back. And I remember it's kind of a grindy affair, but now they have a lot more things you can do. So it'd be interesting to see how that all works now.
6251500	6263500	Alright. And then, um, this is kind of cool. So they're going to be getting a game, or there's a game called The Culling, which is coming out pretty soon here on Xbox One.
6263500	6272500	And I guess it's just recently, well within the last year, released on Steam Early Access. But The Culling is kind of a battle royale type game.
6272500	6283500	So basically you have 16 players that are pit against each other with guns, melee weapons, and traps, and all sorts of stuff. And it's like a battle royale format.
6283500	6292500	But yeah, it'll be coming to Xbox One on June 2nd as part of our Xbox Game Preview program. That's our kind of early access equivalent there.
6292500	6304500	But yeah, it'll be interesting to check that out. Too bad I don't have an Xbox One. But I guess I could pick up the Steam version if I wanted to. So yeah, that's it.
6304500	6309500	I think I would play that because I like battle royale. Sounds like fun.
6309500	6316500	I hear that some people didn't take kindly to all the changes in that game though, but I guess the game's getting a second chance on Xbox.
6316500	6317500	Yeah.
6317500	6323500	Alright, well let's move on and talk about Red Dead Redemption 2. I know that's a game the Loki's probably looking forward to.
6323500	6324500	Yep, I am looking forward to it.
6324500	6332500	Well, you'll have to look forward a little longer because it's been pushed back to spring of 2018. But again, it better they do that and have a good game.
6332500	6338500	If there's a company I'm going to trust with delays on games, it's going to be Rockstar Games. So I'm perfectly okay with that.
6339500	6344500	So there it is. It was originally planned for fall of 2017 and in a message they said,
6344500	6351500	This Outlaw epic set across the vast and unforgiving American heartland will be the first Rockstar game created from the ground up for the latest generation of console hardware.
6351500	6356500	And they released screenshots for that game. It looks fantastic.
6356500	6361500	And says some extra time is necessary to ensure that we can deliver the best experience possible for our fans.
6361500	6368500	We're sorry for any disappointment the delay causes, but we're firm believers in delivering a game only when it's ready.
6368500	6374500	We're excited to bring you more details about the game this summer. In the meantime, please enjoy this selection of new screenshots from Red Dead Redemption 2.
6374500	6377500	Too bad it's not coming out on PC, though. At launch, at least.
6377500	6381500	Well, I wonder if they'll just do a delay like they've done for the other games.
6381500	6388500	Well, you know, the Xbox, or when they did the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions, that's when the PC version came out for that.
6388500	6392500	That was a good year later, so I don't know. Still kind of disappointing.
6392500	6397500	ActDeftInChat says, Rockstar and delays in the same sentence. Color me surprised.
6397500	6399500	Glad it's worth it, though.
6399500	6404500	So if you have a Samsung TV that's been having a hard time with a Nintendo Switch, some good news for you.
6404500	6409500	Samsung is apparently going to be releasing a firmware update for their TVs.
6409500	6415500	Samsung TVs feature an automatic HDMI switching system that swap between channels when devices are in use.
6415500	6424500	But because of the way the Switch is designed, the TV can kind of switch back and forth between the Switch and whatever else is going when the console is docked.
6424500	6427500	Now the weird thing is I have a Samsung TV and this doesn't happen to me.
6427500	6435500	I actually do love the fact, though, that when I put the Switch in, it does switch right over to HDMI 2 where I have it plugged in and it goes right to it.
6435500	6439500	I like that. I don't have the same problem, but I've certainly been hearing that feedback from other people.
6439500	6442500	It must just be certain types of televisions.
6442500	6452500	So anyway, they are monitoring the feedback on the community thread and they are going to do a firmware update early this summer to address the behavior and provide the level of convenience that was intended.
6452500	6457500	So that is some good news for folks that have been annoyed with their TVs constantly switching on them.
6457500	6461500	ActDeft is saying, My TV is also Samsung. I haven't gotten that problem.
6461500	6468500	I've definitely heard from people that do get it. I think it's just probably what type of Samsung TV you have, maybe what year you bought it or what have you.
6468500	6470500	Moving on to Dark Sakura.
6470500	6478500	Well, Titanfall 2 is getting a new Titan and a new map next week. Hooray!
6478500	6486500	They have said that on the 30th that's going to come out and of course this content will be free.
6486500	6495500	The new Titan is called Monarch, who is a mid-range Vanguard class that can self-upgrade. So interesting.
6495500	6505500	And then in other news, we're going to be getting a classic Street Fighter 2 stage in Street Fighter 5.
6505500	6520500	On May 30th, that means Vegas, as he was in Japan, Balrog, his stage with the fence in the background that he can climb on will be coming back.
6520500	6530500	And there will be some different changes and of course, Ed. And there you go.
6531500	6538500	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at VoGnetwork.com, use the passphrase, shake.
6538500	6545500	Alright, let's travel around and check out what is coming out in stores this week. What hasn't been delayed and will actually be on shelves this week?
6546500	6554500	Quite a bit actually. So we've got coming out on the Nintendo Switch, Astro Duel Deluxe on PlayStation 4 and PC.
6554500	6562500	We have Danger Zone, MXGP3, the official motocross video game on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
6562500	6567500	Star Trek Bridge Crew on the Vive, the Rift, and the PlayStation VR.
6567500	6579500	Ease Origin on PlayStation Vita. We have Episode 5 of Season 3 of The Walking Dead on PC, Mac, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, iOS, and Android.
6579500	6590500	Don't Knock Twice on the Vive and the Rift. And then we have Seiken Detsetsu Collection on the Switch.
6591500	6600500	And Tekken 7 on the PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. That is it.
6600500	6604500	Let's go to the UK. Dark Sakura.
6604500	6613500	I wish. This kind of sucks over here. On the 30th, we have Crossout for PlayStation 4, Xbox One on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6613500	6619500	Also, we have Oh, Sir! The Insult Simulator. Or is that like Shade the Game? I don't know.
6619500	6628500	On the 31st, we have First Strike Final Hour for Mac and PC. And on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, we have Tokyo 42.
6628500	6640500	Now, in June, the first few days of June, just on the 2nd, we have Tekken 7 for PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
6640500	6642500	And Seifani.
6642500	6650500	Alright, heading over to Japan and checking out the releases there. On the 1st of June, a little game you might have heard of called Tekken 7.
6650500	6655500	It's coming out on the PlayStation 4 over there. I mean, Dark Sakura did just mention it, as did Loki.
6655500	6661500	But, you know, Tekken, the Tekken series, Dark Sakura, are you interested in Tekken 7 or are we kind of over Tekken at this point?
6661500	6663500	I kind of got burned after Tekken 4.
6663500	6664500	Yeah?
6664500	6665500	Yeah.
6666500	6671500	If they had kept the way that Jin handled, as he did in Tekken 3, then I would have been happy.
6671500	6672500	Akuma's in there.
6672500	6676500	It might be a time to just give it a shot. Give it a shot. Who knows.
6676500	6677500	I'll take a shot.
6677500	6683500	Alright, on the Vita, a game called Shin is coming out, as well as Sukitomo Sukiuta, 12 Memories.
6683500	6692500	Both are out on the Vita this week in Japan. And checking the Switch and the 3DS real quick, the Switch does have, of course, the Sekendetsu collection is out in Japan this week.
6692500	6696500	I have a feeling some of you guys are going to be importing that. That is out on June the 1st.
6696500	6700500	And on the Nintendo 3DS, some price reductions.
6700500	6703500	Tales of the Abyss goes into the Welcome Price from Bandai Namco.
6703500	6707500	And another Bandai Namco game going into the Welcome Price getting a price reduction.
6707500	6713500	Ridge Racer 3D gets a price reduction this week in the Welcome Price collection.
6713500	6717500	And I'm thinking in my mind, wasn't that like a launch game on 3DS?
6717500	6723500	Like, that game is old. But it's about time, I guess, that that gets a Welcome Price there.
6723500	6726500	Maybe it finally sold however many copies they need to do that.
6726500	6730500	Alright, let's go to the mailbag. Every week you guys email us.
6730500	6733500	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
6733500	6736500	It's the place where you can participate with the show.
6736500	6741500	Dark Soccer dives in the mailbag head first, and this week she found a bunch of air.
6741500	6743500	And one. There was one.
6743500	6747500	One lowly postcard lying at the bottom of the empty mailbag.
6747500	6749500	Let's get to the mailbag, Dark Soccer.
6749500	6752500	Hey, OLR. I hope all is well.
6752500	6753500	It doesn't suck.
6753500	6754500	It doesn't suck.
6754500	6760500	I just wanted to know what your E3 predictions are this year.
6760500	6764500	I'm hoping for an Onimusha remaster, a Need for Speed title that doesn't suck,
6764500	6769500	a Street Fighter collection since it's the 30th anniversary after all,
6769500	6773500	a Saga compilation, and some Final Fantasy VII remake footage.
6773500	6777500	Thanks guys, and take care. Tristan.
6777500	6780500	I stopped having expectations for E3 a long time ago.
6780500	6783500	Yeah, usually we kind of set some time aside to do these the week before.
6783500	6788500	However, since he is the only person to email us this week, let's indulge it a little bit.
6788500	6791500	What are some E3 predictions you guys might have?
6791500	6796500	Maybe like one thing from each of the companies. Loki.
6797500	6802500	Ironically enough, I would actually be all down for a new Ridge Racer game.
6802500	6805500	I really do wish they put out one. It's been soberly missed.
6805500	6810500	They used to launch consoles with Ridge Racer, and ever since the PlayStation 3,
6810500	6813500	I guess the Vita had a Ridge Racer, but it sucked.
6813500	6815500	It's just, bring it back.
6815500	6818500	Especially on modern hardware now, it looks so good.
6818500	6823500	I miss that. I really wish they'd just try again.
6823500	6825500	So there's that.
6825500	6827500	My expectations of the other systems.
6827500	6829500	Nintendo, I don't really have any expectations.
6829500	6834500	I'm sure we'll see some more Mario Odyssey or whatever.
6834500	6836500	That'll be probably pretty cool.
6836500	6839500	I'm just not really expecting any bombshell announcements.
6839500	6842500	Especially after last year, they didn't really have a whole ton.
6844500	6846500	Let's see, probably Microsoft.
6846500	6848500	Honestly, don't know what they're going to show.
6848500	6851500	Hope Crackdown is among what they're going to show.
6851500	6854500	Really, the rest of their announcements I'm kind of in the dark on.
6854500	6858500	Sony, I hope more PlayStation VR stuff,
6858500	6861500	because it would be nice to see what's on the forefront for that.
6861500	6864500	I know we still have a lot of games that they're showing at last year's E3
6864500	6868500	that aren't out yet, so I can't remember the names of them,
6868500	6870500	but there's that one with zombies in it.
6870500	6872500	It could be anything nowadays.
6872500	6875500	But that game is still not out yet, so it would be interesting to see
6875500	6879500	what exactly that's supposed to be and what other games they have in the works.
6880500	6882500	Bethesda.
6882500	6885500	I would like a new Elder Scrolls game would be nice.
6885500	6887500	Not happening.
6887500	6889500	Okay, well what new franchise are there?
6889500	6893500	I mean, I don't want Fallout Vegas and Fallout 4's setup.
6895500	6899500	Side story Fallout thing.
6899500	6902500	I'd find a Fallout New Vegas remastered. I'd try that.
6902500	6905500	I mean, I didn't play through much of it on PC,
6905500	6908500	but I'd be down for a remaster of that.
6908500	6910500	Sure, I'm on board.
6910500	6912500	Adar Saqra.
6912500	6915500	I don't really have any expectations so much as things I would hope for.
6915500	6920500	I would love for them to remaster the last Mass Effect trilogy.
6920500	6924500	Could you imagine all of that with really good graphics?
6924500	6928500	I just worry with where Mass Effect's at right now.
6928500	6931500	They're going to just kind of put the talk of that series on ice for a little while.
6931500	6933500	It would be a guaranteed money maker though.
6933500	6936500	Yeah, I know. If you want to try to get Mass Effect back up with people,
6936500	6940500	go back and do those games that everybody really enjoyed.
6940500	6943500	Not that Andromeda was bad though.
6943500	6947500	I would love to see multiplayer from 3 come back, but I love the new one,
6947500	6949500	but I understand it's so complicated.
6949500	6951500	Alright, my predictions quickly.
6951500	6957500	Nintendo, I think the Smash thing, the Smash remaster is going to be...
6957500	6962500	It's been rumored already and I think that's going to prove to be the big remaster that they do.
6963500	6965500	It's such low hanging fruit. I understand.
6965500	6970500	But as we talked about earlier, it's such a small risk.
6970500	6972500	People like Smash? Of course they do.
6972500	6974500	I mean, let's just port it over.
6974500	6978500	It's so low risk and they're going to charge a full retail price on it.
6978500	6980500	And it's sickening.
6980500	6982500	But here's a couple things with that.
6982500	6984500	Obviously there will be some new characters to sweeten the pot.
6984500	6985500	Maybe they'll do some stuff.
6985500	6990500	They'll add some new modes, some new cute things to try to sweeten the pot a little bit with that.
6990500	6993500	I also think that is going to be when Nintendo finally introduces
6993500	6996500	how they're answering the game sharing and the social media stuff.
6996500	6999500	I don't think the Switch is going to be capable of live streaming to Twitch,
6999500	7004500	but I think there will be something about the game sharing and buying into that.
7004500	7007500	And again, these are predictions and just things I'm pulling out of my hat.
7007500	7011500	But I think it's going to be exclusively through YouTube,
7011500	7014500	and that's not just because of Mario Kart 8, although I think that's a pretty good hint,
7014500	7016500	but I think it's going to be exclusively through YouTube
7016500	7021500	because Nintendo has YouTube on lock when it comes to getting their money out of it.
7021500	7022500	Why can't they share, though?
7022500	7028500	Because an Android phone or a phone or a tablet can stream to Twitch.
7028500	7029500	Well, maybe they will.
7029500	7033500	Aren't these pieces of hardware capable of what phones can do?
7033500	7034500	I'm going to keep it real.
7034500	7038500	I don't think Nintendo wants to put the full stuff out there like the other companies have it.
7038500	7039500	I just don't think Nintendo wants to do it.
7039500	7042500	I think they want to do highlights on YouTube and try to get that going,
7042500	7044500	but I don't know. We'll see. We'll see.
7044500	7049500	The only reason why I'm a little iffy on Smash is because we have ARMS already,
7049500	7052500	so it's like you're going to have two fighting games in a year,
7052500	7057500	but there are different types and there's plenty of room.
7057500	7060500	We had Fast Racing, Nioh, and Mario Kart.
7060500	7062500	Well, they could show Smash and it could be coming out next year.
7062500	7065500	Yeah, it could be. It could be an early 2018 game.
7065500	7067500	But anyway, that's what I think is going to go on with Nintendo,
7067500	7069500	and they need to say something about Virtual Console.
7069500	7072500	If they don't talk about Virtual Console, I'm going to be very disappointed.
7072500	7073500	Animal Crossing would be next.
7073500	7074500	On the phone, yeah.
7074500	7076500	I would be so happy, yeah.
7076500	7078500	Let's see, moving on to Sony.
7078500	7082500	I think Sony's going to be interesting because where I do expect a few surprises,
7082500	7084500	I think you hit the nail on the head with something,
7084500	7087500	is that they've shown so much that still isn't out.
7087500	7089500	So I fully expect God of War.
7089500	7093500	That ought to be the centerpiece of Sony's show, I would assume.
7093500	7096500	God of War, there's that other game I can't think of the name of,
7096500	7100500	but it was the really nice looking zombie game that they had.
7101500	7103500	The Second Last of Us.
7103500	7107500	Yeah, so I feel like Sony's going to be a lot of updates in a way,
7107500	7108500	and that's okay.
7108500	7111500	As long as Sony kind of goes, you know, playable, playable, playable,
7111500	7113500	that'll be some good stuff.
7113500	7116500	Microsoft obviously needs to focus on Scorpio,
7116500	7119500	and we just need to hear about why I need one.
7119500	7121500	That's what I really just need to hear from Microsoft,
7121500	7122500	is why do I need a Scorpio.
7122500	7124500	I would love to hear a little more about HoloLens.
7124500	7126500	Well, yeah, exactly with the Scorpio thing.
7126500	7127500	I mean, look at it this way.
7127500	7129500	I have a nice new laptop now.
7129500	7131500	I don't need to buy an Xbox One to play their games.
7131500	7134500	I mean, so it's like, what's the point?
7134500	7137500	I'm just going to buy, you know, I'll buy Crackdown on PC.
7137500	7140500	An interesting comment from Stoppy in chat, though,
7140500	7142500	saying at live.vognetwork.com,
7142500	7145500	maybe now that we plebs are allowed into E3,
7145500	7148500	it's more like the carnivals in town instead of an industry show.
7148500	7151500	And I think that's a really good thing to remember in the back of your mind,
7151500	7157500	is that E3 is not necessarily so much now about needing to get the word out
7157500	7161500	about products, because the internet does that for everybody now.
7161500	7163500	Nintendo knows that better than anyone,
7163500	7166500	but of course all the companies are doing this now, really.
7166500	7170500	But it's about really making hype for holiday games.
7170500	7174500	And, you know, hype for the systems themselves.
7174500	7178500	They still want to sell more PlayStation 4s and more Xbox Ones and all that.
7178500	7180500	I would like a new Excite Truck game, just saying.
7180500	7182500	It's going to be a different tone. We'll see.
7182500	7184500	All right, thank you for the email.
7184500	7185500	Email her.
7185500	7187500	Participate at OrangeLawnTrader.com.
7187500	7189500	It will sell me a system, I'm telling you.
7189500	7193500	You come out with a new Excite Truck game, I will buy the system.
7193500	7196500	And that goes for any console out there.
7196500	7198500	If you want to buy Excite Truck on another PlayStation system,
7198500	7201500	I will buy that system for Excite Truck.
7201500	7205500	All right, let's move on to some more news for the week.
7205500	7206500	We'll start with Logie.
7206500	7209500	All right, so this is kind of a really odd take on this,
7209500	7213500	but they're turning the King of Kong into a musical.
7213500	7215500	Yes, the King Kong Fistful of Quarters,
7215500	7219500	that whole documentary about Billy Mitchell and Steve Weeby,
7219500	7221500	is now going to be a musical.
7221500	7225500	They're, I guess, I don't know,
7225500	7231500	they're talking about that they're assessing the musical content,
7231500	7237500	including, they said, the Museum of Your Heart by Walter Dey.
7237500	7241500	I don't know, that sounds really weird.
7242500	7244500	I can't imagine that as a musical.
7246500	7249500	It sounds so cheesy and stupid, and I kind of love it.
7251500	7254500	Some of the best musicals out there are cheesy, stupid things.
7254500	7256500	I mean, look at Rocky Horror Picture Show.
7256500	7259500	This is true, this is me coming off of, you know,
7259500	7264500	not only a few weeks ago actually seeing the bodyguard, the musical.
7264500	7266500	You fucking went and saw the bodyguard.
7266500	7267500	Yes, I did.
7267500	7268500	Of course your wife.
7268500	7269500	Of course, look at my wife.
7269500	7271500	Of course your wife, the biggest Whitney Houston fan out there,
7271500	7273500	made you go see the bodyguard musical.
7273500	7274500	Oh my God, I didn't know this.
7274500	7276500	This is more important than the new story.
7276500	7277500	How was the bodyguard musical?
7277500	7278500	It wasn't bad, actually.
7278500	7280500	It was all right.
7280500	7282500	Was it Deborah Cox in the lead role?
7282500	7284500	Yeah, so it was all right.
7284500	7286500	I mean, I don't know.
7286500	7288500	And how was that?
7288500	7289500	It was all right.
7289500	7291500	They added some songs that weren't in there before,
7291500	7294500	like other Whitney Houston songs, which is kind of neat.
7294500	7296500	I thought they were pretty good.
7296500	7300500	And there was like one of the child, like a played her son.
7300500	7304500	Was it Mitchell or I think that was, I don't remember the kid's name.
7304500	7305500	Got it.
7305500	7307500	I've only seen the movie way too many times.
7307500	7310500	But yeah, they had, I don't know, it was very abridged.
7310500	7313500	And they changed kind of the story a little bit.
7313500	7315500	Like it doesn't follow the movie entirely.
7315500	7318500	Like the stalker guy is a different person.
7318500	7321500	And Lord knows how many times you've had to watch the movie.
7321500	7323500	Yeah, seriously.
7323500	7325500	But it is a little bit different.
7325500	7329500	But it's interesting. It was all right.
7329500	7331500	My wife kind of dragged me to it.
7331500	7334500	And it wasn't the worst thing I've seen.
7334500	7339500	The user named I heart Rob Roberts in our chat room asks,
7339500	7341500	did you cry, Loki?
7341500	7342500	No.
7342500	7344500	Only manly tears.
7344500	7346500	I'm just kidding. All right.
7346500	7348500	But yeah, King of Kong is a musical,
7348500	7352500	like is an off-off-off-Broadway sort of thing.
7352500	7354500	Like it's so off-Broadway it's in Jersey.
7354500	7356500	I could get into that.
7356500	7359500	I so want to see. They did Evil Dead the musical.
7359500	7361500	And that actually came locally here not too long ago.
7361500	7365500	And I mean, if they can make that into a musical, then sure, why not?
7365500	7366500	Why not?
7366500	7368500	All right.
7368500	7371500	Let's move on to Far Cry 5.
7371500	7374500	That's right. Far Cry 5 was announced.
7374500	7377500	A lot more of the details on the game this week.
7377500	7381500	So Far Cry 5 is being set in the mountains of Montana.
7381500	7383500	And it's going to be about a religious cult.
7383500	7385500	It's being set in Hope County, Montana.
7385500	7388500	And you can see this in the cover art.
7388500	7391500	There's lots of religious cultists there on it.
7391500	7397500	Kind of in the style of Heaven's Gate or those guys in Waco, Texas.
7397500	7399500	What was the name of that? Remember that whole thing?
7399500	7401500	But yeah, that whole stuff.
7401500	7402500	It's kind of...
7402500	7404500	It is interesting.
7404500	7408500	I did watch all the... They had six trailers available for that.
7408500	7409500	Geez.
7409500	7412500	Well, they had a trailer. They had the character highlights.
7412500	7415500	The heroes, the pastor, Mary May.
7415500	7420500	What's going to be different about this game versus other Far Cry games is there's multiple characters you can play as.
7420500	7423500	And they even have, I think, co-op throughout the whole game, which is kind of cool.
7423500	7431500	But basically, the premise is that these cultists come into this town and they're promising to save everybody.
7431500	7436500	And what they've done is actually started kidnapping people and just basically forcing them into this cult.
7436500	7441500	And now these people who are in this town are just going to fight back against them because they're just fucking sick of it.
7441500	7448500	And so it does look pretty cool. A very interesting premise and I'm down playing it and it looks very interesting.
7448500	7452500	Well, you'll be waiting until early 2018 when everything else is coming out.
7452500	7456500	That's fine. I think that's when the last Far Cry game, Far Cry 4, came out.
7456500	7458500	Was the November game, if I'm not mistaken.
7458500	7464500	No, Far Cry 4 is December. Far Cry Primal was February.
7465500	7472500	Stoppy in chat says, I'm glad we're finally getting historically accurate first person games again. They need to move on from World War 2.
7472500	7480500	Well, to be fair, this isn't based on any real religious cult, but obviously there's a lot of inspiration, heavy inspiration.
7480500	7487500	You probably don't want to see the latest Call of Duty then if you don't want World War 2 games because they're going back to World War 2.
7488500	7495500	And to be fair, I am interested to see what they come up with because I did like the Call of Duty 2.
7495500	7501500	Call of Duty 2 was one of the games that sold me on the Xbox 360 and it was a fantastic game.
7501500	7508500	Those old Call of Duty games, they were great. So I'm hoping that it stays like that.
7508500	7513500	Because honestly, what they did with Infinite Warfare was a little fucking crazy.
7513500	7515500	They took it too far.
7516500	7523500	Alright, well let's move on with a few more stories and we'll be getting your calls at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype very soon. But first, Dark Sakura.
7523500	7528500	Well, Vinyl is making a comeback. We have all known this.
7528500	7543500	And that same company that has put out the Shenmue soundtrack and Outrun and all these others is also now doing Gunstar Heroes, which is a really awesome treasure game.
7544500	7549500	It has some really great music and so it's going to be released by Data Discs.
7549500	7559500	That will be two LPs and they are going to be available to purchase apparently right now already.
7559500	7570500	Hold on, I loaded the price on it a moment ago because I was thinking about ordering it and then I realized that I have other things to spend my money on.
7571500	7574500	But hold on, I'm getting the price right now.
7574500	7581500	So they have it listed for, and this is of course British Pounds 24.99.
7581500	7586500	Some of the other things on their site is the Galaxy Force 2 and Thunder Blade soundtrack.
7586500	7595500	Revenge of Shinobi, Panzer Dragoon, Golden Axe 1 and 2, Outrun, Streets of Rage 2, Super Hang-On, Shinobi 3, Shenmue, and the original Streets of Rage.
7595500	7600500	So check it out, if you have a record player.
7600500	7602500	Are you interested in getting this?
7602500	7604500	You're going to drop the, let's drop the beat.
7604500	7612500	I thought about it and then I was like, we don't have a record player and we really only have a handful of albums that we'd want to keep.
7612500	7618500	Like we've got Weird Al's Even Worse, we have Mandatory Fun and it's signed.
7618500	7626500	We have Xanadu, I gave you the Rocky Horror Picture Show Audience Participation.
7626500	7630500	Yes, I have that in the closet somewhere.
7630500	7632500	Did I give you ABBA's Super Trooper?
7632500	7641500	I think you may have given me an ABBA cover, but the only ABBA album I have out here, Vinyl, I bought that copy of ABBA's The Visitors.
7641500	7643500	I'm fairly sure I bought you Super Troopers.
7643500	7644500	You did, I think it's in the closet.
7644500	7645500	And I bet Midler.
7645500	7652500	This one came from Seattle. It was a record store we were visiting, we were up there, and The Visitors is my favorite ABBA album. It was their last one.
7652500	7662500	And yes, I like ABBA a lot. It's like some gays like Gaga, some Madonna, I'm old school.
7662500	7670500	One treasure that I own is the Gorillaz Demon Days Parlophone release. The first printing of it, not the reprint, unopened.
7670500	7671500	Nice.
7671500	7673500	I could probably fetch 500 for it.
7673500	7674500	Look at their new album. They never asked you.
7674500	7681500	The new album is really good, but it's definitely something you have to listen to from start to finish. It's one of those kind of albums.
7681500	7688500	But, um, Saturn's Bars is like the best track on there, and Andromeda. So, really, really good album.
7688500	7692500	Cool. Alright, just a few more stories, and then your calls. Loki.
7692500	7701500	Speaking of movies that I've seen way too many times, the Angry Bird movie is something that I've had to watch dozens of times with my kids.
7701500	7709500	And it honestly, it's not a great movie, but it's funny for adults too. So, I mean, I enjoyed it enough.
7709500	7711500	There are worse things that I've seen.
7711500	7716500	But, they are making a sequel, and it's going to be coming out in 2019.
7716500	7721500	It's going to be, I guess they're going to have maybe some of the same voice actors in there as well.
7721500	7731500	It's being directed by Thrupper Van Orman, who did the Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack in Adventure Time.
7731500	7737500	And then it's being co-directed by John Rice, who does King of the Hill and Rick and Morty.
7737500	7743500	I like that combination. So, I'm all down with another adult, humored movie.
7743500	7746500	So, yeah. We'll check that out.
7746500	7756500	And then finally, Resident Evil. That movie series kind of went from typical Resident Evil to where you've gone beyond the Matrix kind of crazy shit.
7756500	7763500	But they're rebooting it. So, now they're going to have a brand new series that's going to be coming out.
7763500	7767500	I don't know when, but interesting.
7767500	7772500	All these video game reboots, maybe with the Tomb Raider one now, and this.
7773500	7777500	I wonder if they'll go in the direction of the new Resident Evil game, where it's more...
7777500	7781500	Although that's kind of really generic horror movie trope stuff right now.
7781500	7787500	Yeah, I mean, I don't know, because when the first Resident Evil movie came out, I was like, this doesn't seem to have that much in common with the game.
7787500	7789500	I mean, there's some of the ideas and so forth.
7789500	7797500	Well, in the later movies, I'm like, I haven't played any of these later games, I'm pretty sure none of this shit is in there, but it's pretty entertaining to watch.
7797500	7799500	I mean, it's just a popcorn movie.
7799500	7806500	Those movies kind of became something else, but doesn't seem a little, I don't know, doesn't seem a little early to reboot a series that just recently ended.
7806500	7808500	And I used my ended and quotey fingers.
7808500	7811500	Ended as in Mila Jovovich is sick of this shit.
7811500	7816500	Like, it's like, I mean, that woman has been in those movies.
7816500	7818500	How many of those movies are there? Six?
7818500	7819500	Seven, I think.
7819500	7823500	Oh my God. So, think of how much of her life she's been in those Resident Evil movies.
7823500	7825500	I mean, think of how much she's been paid.
7825500	7832500	Yeah, that's true, that's true. To be fair, I don't think Mila Jovovich has done much in the past decade or so outside of those movies.
7832500	7833500	She's been in a few things.
7833500	7835500	A few things, a few things, but you know.
7835500	7836500	This is the fifth element.
7836500	7838500	Okay, well, how long ago was that movie? That movie was-
7838500	7842500	A while ago. Well, do they have that new, oh man, that new movie that's coming out by that guy.
7842500	7843500	I'm looking forward to Valerian.
7843500	7844500	That looks pretty sweet.
7844500	7845500	Yeah, Valerian, yeah, yeah, yeah.
7845500	7847500	Have you ever read any of the Valerian comics?
7847500	7848500	No, I never have.
7848500	7849500	I remember that he was-
7849500	7850500	Isn't that, um-
7850500	7851500	They're French comics.
7851500	7853500	That's Grandpa Matt's, one of his online names he uses.
7853500	7854500	But Valerian?
7854500	7856500	I don't know, I don't know the whole-
7856500	7858500	Valerian is also a root that makes you sleepy.
7858500	7863500	I don't know anything about the storyline of that, but man, that was like a visual orgy in front of my face there.
7863500	7864500	Like, I totally want to go see that.
7864500	7872500	Well, Besson wanted to do it back in the 80s, and we didn't have the technology to render alien faces like that,
7872500	7877500	and he wouldn't have the makeup skills that would be very prohibitive to do something on that scale.
7877500	7880500	Now that the technology's here, hell yeah, he's doing it.
7880500	7881500	Yeah.
7882500	7885500	He's been directing movies for forever, he's gotta be getting up there in age.
7885500	7889500	I mean, Besson's been around since, God, he was doing stuff in the 80s, wasn't he?
7889500	7890500	Pretty sure.
7890500	7893500	Yeah, but the 80s was only 40 years ago?
7893500	7894500	30 years ago.
7894500	7895500	I mean, depending on when in the 80s.
7895500	7896500	Hold on, I'm gonna look it up.
7896500	7897500	Yeah.
7897500	7900500	Well, I mean, I was born in 78, and-
7900500	7903500	I'm still waiting for my live-action Matt Cross movie.
7903500	7905500	He was born in 1959.
7905500	7907500	Okay, so that's not as old as I thought he would've been.
7907500	7912500	And his first public movie was Subway in 1985.
7912500	7914500	Okay, so he has been making movies since the 80s, that's what I thought.
7914500	7915500	Yeah.
7915500	7916500	Alright.
7918500	7924500	Well, one more story for you guys, and I wonder if Dark Soccer would be interested in something like this.
7924500	7928500	Dark Soccer, do you ever play your Sega Nomad anymore these days?
7928500	7930500	No, it's kind of collecting dust.
7930500	7936500	Well, Sega Nomad, if you didn't know what that is, it was basically a handheld way to play the Genesis.
7936500	7941500	But it took six AA batteries to get three hours of playtime.
7941500	7945500	What kind of handheld gets a crap three hours of playtime? My god.
7945500	7946500	The Nomad.
7946500	7951500	It was seriously, if you didn't- you could get like another battery pack for it.
7951500	7952500	Yeah.
7952500	7955500	And that made it kind of tolerable, but no, it was shit for that.
7955500	7960500	And I joke, because obviously the Switch is another three hours of battery life when you're playing Zelda.
7960500	7963500	But the Switch has a dock that recharges very easy.
7963500	7967500	It was very different back when you had to buy six AA batteries. That's money, yo.
7967500	7968500	Rechargeable batteries.
7968500	7970500	Yeah, or rechargeable batteries, of course, you could always do that.
7970500	7979500	But anyway, so somebody has decided to update the technology to be able to play the Nomad without all these necessary battery swaps.
7979500	7992500	That's right, there's a new homebrew Nomad modification made by the Segaholic, and it will let your portable system, the Nomad, run on USB power.
7992500	7995500	That's right, you could use the same battery that you use for your phone.
7995500	7999500	Like this guy I have over here that I bought when we went to go play Ingress all day once.
7999500	8001500	I can charge four phones at once.
8001500	8005500	This is like, how many- what is the specs on this?
8005500	8009500	Capacity, 24,000 mAh.
8009500	8017500	That's like just a step below the legal limit for what you can take on an airplane.
8017500	8023500	So, anyway, yeah, you could run something off forever off that, off USB power, so that's pretty cool.
8023500	8029500	So anyway, you're gonna have to probably use some YouTube tutorials. This isn't something he's selling or anything like that.
8029500	8033500	But, you know, if this is possible, even more could be possible.
8033500	8040500	But I just love that somebody is still thinking about the Sega Nomad this way. I love all the tributes to the old systems.
8040500	8048500	Anyhow, time for you guys to give us a phone call, talk about anything you'd like to talk about that we were talking about in the news this week.
8048500	8053500	Or maybe something we missed. Or maybe you just want to talk alcohol with us. That would be fine too.
8053500	8060500	While we wait for your calls to come in at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype, I want to check in with Loki and see if there's any last minute stories.
8060500	8064500	Oh, I was supposed to be looking for last minute stories. Well, not this week. I don't think there's really anything out there.
8064500	8068500	Usually that's what we do towards the end of the show is look to see if there's any last minute stories.
8068500	8077500	But nothing so far. Alright. Well, you guys can also shout things out in chat if there's something you want us to talk about or banter on topic.
8077500	8082500	Because I'm kind of out of topics right now. I don't know what to talk about.
8082500	8085500	Overwatch Season 5 begins next week.
8085500	8088500	Oh yeah, because they just ended Overwatch Season 4. That's right.
8088500	8089500	So that's a thing.
8089500	8092500	Right around the time for the anniversary. Were you going to say something, DarkSucker?
8092500	8093500	No.
8093500	8094500	Oh.
8094500	8097500	No. Although I really want Mongolian BBQ.
8098500	8102500	It's a little late. I think the restaurant. Well, you have until 9 o'clock if we finish the show soon.
8102500	8103500	I'm going to come by myself.
8105500	8108500	Actually, on Sunday they might not be open until 9 now that I think about it.
8108500	8113500	There's a little hole in the wall place not far from here. But I don't like it as much as the one in Roseville. Some of the other stuff.
8113500	8114500	Anyway.
8115500	8121500	Let's see. Something I was going to mention. Speaking of Overwatch, I was going to do a stream tonight after the show.
8121500	8126500	Over on my Twitch channel, which of course is Rob Roberts over on Twitch.
8126500	8129500	And I put a poll on my Twitter to see what I was going to do.
8129500	8132500	I said I'll do either Overwatch because it's the free weekend.
8132500	8137500	I'll do Mario Kart 8 multiplayer because people have been asking me to play that with them.
8137500	8140500	Or just something retro because that's always a good stand by.
8140500	8142500	When in doubt, something retro.
8142500	8146500	And so far Overwatch is actually winning. I'm kind of surprised.
8146500	8148500	I thought some people thought I did too much Overwatch streaming.
8148500	8151500	So I guess with the free weekend there's more people that want to do that.
8151500	8152500	So right now that's winning over on my Twitter.
8152500	8155500	But I will check in. I'll make the final call here in about...
8155500	8159500	Oh no, it says final results. I guess I set the timer to finish up at 8.30.
8159500	8163500	So it is going to be Overwatch because there's no time left to vote.
8163500	8169500	ActDeftInChat says, too much Overwatch. Who says that? I agree. I agree.
8169500	8171500	I guess I could try playing some more Overwatch.
8171500	8173500	There you go. You got to add me on Battle.net.
8173500	8176500	I already did. I thought I submitted a thing.
8176500	8180500	Yeah, but you have to know my numbers. Did you send it to Sky or did you use my email?
8180500	8183500	I did it through Facebook. Remember, they can link it to Facebook.
8183500	8187500	I am no longer linked on Facebook on Battle.net, I don't think.
8187500	8189500	Oh, maybe I didn't. I did Allen though. I know that.
8189500	8192500	Okay, if you added Allen then I can look at his friends list.
8192500	8196500	I disconnected Facebook from Battle.net and I don't remember why.
8196500	8199500	But something about privacy pissed me off.
8199500	8203500	Oh, Battle.net shows my real last name. Facebook doesn't.
8203500	8209500	And there was something about that that I don't remember what I saw or something, but it pissed me off.
8209500	8211500	Oh, I didn't worry about that.
8211500	8220500	Yeah. And honestly, Battle.net needs to let us, especially for streaming purposes, that's what's really pissing me off.
8220500	8225500	Is that when I stream games I can't suppress the real names from showing up and it's pissing me off.
8225500	8229500	Like I don't want the game to show me the real names.
8229500	8234500	Maybe I got to look deeper into the options or something. I don't know. I guess I haven't been doing that.
8234500	8236500	Anyway, the phone is ringing so let's get to a call here.
8236500	8238500	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
8238500	8240500	Hey, it's Brad from 5 Culture.
8240500	8242500	Hey, Brad. Good to hear from you, buddy. How you doing?
8242500	8245500	Well, I had a call on a drunk show.
8245500	8249500	Have you been partaking in spirits tonight?
8249500	8252500	I do have a bottle of Fireball right here.
8252500	8256500	Your favorite, the standby. Have you tried Pepsi Fire, by the way?
8256500	8258500	No, I have not.
8258500	8263500	Okay, so it was described by a friend of mine on Twitter and I kind of agree.
8263500	8267500	Granted, I've only had Pepsi Fire as a Slurpee, but close enough.
8267500	8271500	Pepsi Fire is Pepsi mixed with Fireball, but without the booze.
8273500	8275500	The hell's the point of that?
8275500	8277500	That sounds terrible.
8277500	8280500	I know, it does sound terrible. My sister's super into it.
8280500	8285500	Tomorrow when we have this family picnic thing, they're bringing Pepsi Fire and I'm like, I don't want to try that.
8285500	8288500	Yeah, I have to admit, I kind of like it.
8288500	8296500	It's really sweet to me. I mean, granted, I had it as a Slurpee, but most soda like that is so sweet to me.
8297500	8303500	I can only use it on special occasions. I can't just drink a whole two-liter bottle of it or whatever.
8303500	8305500	I don't know, I could be kind of into it.
8305500	8311500	But you're right, Pepsi mixed with actual Fireball is much better, but you can't drink all the time.
8311500	8313500	Especially if you use the real sugar stuff.
8313500	8314500	That's true.
8314500	8317500	I wonder what you think of the stuff that I brought over for Rob.
8320500	8322500	That would burn you.
8322500	8325500	Well, no, you can't do that if he's flying to Dragon Con.
8325500	8330500	Yeah, I was going to say, if there was a way, can you check alcohol and luggage?
8330500	8333500	You can if it's sealed, I think, because I've brought back wine.
8333500	8339500	Yeah, but that's factory sealed. I don't know. I'd have to look at the TSA regulations on that.
8339500	8341500	Bail it to Bobby and I have him bring it.
8341500	8346500	That's true. Can you send it to FedEx? Because I would actually do that. Would you send FedEx to Bobby?
8346500	8348500	I don't know that you can FedEx alcohol.
8348500	8349500	Dang it.
8349500	8351500	I'll have to look it up, but...
8351500	8354500	No, you can FedEx it because wineries do it. You can ship it somehow.
8354500	8356500	Yeah, but it's still not factory.
8356500	8357500	Oh, and you can't?
8357500	8358500	Wineries can't ship to Kentucky.
8358500	8361500	Yeah, you can only ship to certain states, too. I forgot about that.
8363500	8364500	Road trip!
8364500	8367500	I know, right? Well, but with Dragon Con, people drive in from everywhere.
8367500	8371500	So if you can't send it to Georgia, you can probably send it to somebody nearby.
8371500	8375500	Anyway. Oh, to Act F saying you can't send alcohol. Damn it.
8375500	8378500	Am I just going to have to drive to Dragon Con this year? No, I'm just kidding.
8378500	8380500	I don't have the time off work for that type of trip.
8382500	8384500	Well, I just called to do a shot with you.
8384500	8388500	Oh, I appreciate that, my friend. So you're going to have a shot of Fireball with me?
8389500	8390500	Yes, sir.
8390500	8394500	All right, well I'm going to drink some of this ginger stuff. So what are we toasting today?
8395500	8397500	Just hopefully I find a damn job.
8398500	8399500	What's that?
8399500	8403500	I said hopefully I find a damn job. But I just do looking for an excuse to take a shot of Fireball.
8404500	8410500	Let's see, I will do a toast. Let's do a toast to E3 this year. Not sucking.
8411500	8412500	There you go.
8412500	8414500	I'll toast to that. Now that they've opened it to the public.
8414500	8415500	Maybe.
8416500	8418500	All right. Ah, nice be-
8418500	8420500	I am the eternal pessimist, you know.
8420500	8422500	I know, I know. All right.
8422500	8423500	You and me both, sister.
8424500	8430500	Any chance I'll run into you at Dragon Con this year? I know you got a lot of personal stuff to tend to as well, but any chance?
8431500	8433500	Well, there's always a chance.
8433500	8456500	So there's a chance. No, I hope it will work out. In fact, you actually remind me, I think the days are numbered on us submitting the podcast panel stuff, so I gotta harass Bobby in emails so we can come up with some ideas to try to make sure we're involved with that, especially with them not doing the parsecs this year. It's gonna be a quiet Dragon Con if we're not able to get on any of those panels. Then again-
8457500	8458500	Dragon Con's never quiet.
8458500	8459500	Dragon Con's never quiet.
8459500	8475500	That's right. Dragon Con's never quiet. I can always work on cosplay. I can always think about if there's something else I want to try cosplaying this year, so we'll see. I'm kicking ideas around, but for everything I want to do, I'd have to shave my beard, and I'm kind of like, but I like the beard. So I don't know.
8476500	8477500	At least you can grow one.
8477500	8486500	I know. I hear that complaint from some guys sometimes, but anyway. All right, my friend. Enjoy the alcohol, but not too much.
8489500	8490500	I got anywhere to drive in the morning.
8491500	8495500	We'll look forward to the next Pod Culture. I know you guys are on a repeat this week, but hopefully soon.
8496500	8497500	All right, you guys take care.
8498500	8499500	All right, take care. Bye-bye.
8500500	8509500	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype, or you can give us a call. 1-877-GAME-OLR if you'd like to call us that way.
8514500	8515500	Of course, we'll just sit here and wait.
8516500	8521500	I forgot one other thing I guess we should expect to see is another strange trailer for Death Stranding.
8522500	8524500	Oh, I didn't know another trailer came out for that.
8525500	8526500	Well, I'm assuming we'll get one with E3.
8526500	8529500	Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you said that one came out this week.
8530500	8531500	No, no, no.
8532500	8534500	That would be nice. Maybe some gameplay this time. Like, what's the fucking game?
8535500	8536500	It's like, what is the game?
8537500	8542500	Exactly. It's like No Man's Sky all over again, except I know that's a horrible thing to say with Kojima.
8543500	8544500	Let's see, going to chat.
8545500	8549500	Doomplague in chat says, I played Overwatch a bit for the free weekend and it quickly had enough.
8550500	8551500	Aw, sorry to hear that.
8552500	8553500	Let's see.
8554500	8558500	Act F says, Monster Hunter 5 is rumored to be a PlayStation 4 exclusive.
8559500	8563500	Well, that would be interesting. That would be a heck of a thing to show at E3 if they actually did get that as an exclusive.
8564500	8572500	Although, there could be some type of side story thing they could always do on the other platforms.
8573500	8576500	So, just because 5 is exclusive doesn't mean the other systems won't get their Monster Hunter shots.
8577500	8579500	I mean, after all, Monster Hunter XX we know is going to be on the Switch, right?
8579500	8580500	We know that.
8581500	8582500	Alright.
8583500	8586500	Dark Tetsuya says, I should go back to Phantom Dust. I just need people to play with.
8587500	8595500	I keep meaning to fire that up and play it. I just get sucked into other games instead, but I really need to make it a point to do that this week to sit down and play some Phantom Dust.
8596500	8598500	Alright, one more call out for calls and then we're going to close it up.
8599500	8600500	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word, on Skype.
8601500	8604500	But, if that's all we got this week, then that's fine too.
8605500	8607500	I knew in Memorial Day this weekend it would probably be a little shorter of a show.
8607500	8613500	Some of you folks are probably out of town, maybe checking this out on the podcast feed and that's okay too.
8614500	8617500	Maybe we're entertainment on the drive home for you somewhere and that's cool.
8618500	8622500	Hopefully the traffic isn't too horrendous on Memorial Day.
8623500	8628500	I know there's no way in hell I'd be making that drive from LA back to SAC on Memorial Day because I've heard some horror stories.
8629500	8635500	Actually, I think the worst is the day after Thanksgiving, or not, the Sunday after Thanksgiving, whatever that is.
8635500	8637500	It's like the worst day to do it.
8638500	8642500	Alright, well, the phone isn't ringing, so I think y'all are just being quiet tonight.
8643500	8647500	That's fine, that's fine. Maybe y'all just passed out from alcohol, which we might do soon too.
8648500	8653500	Anyway, we're going to wrap things up here, but I want to thank you guys, of course, for tuning into Orange Lounge Radio and being a part of the show.
8654500	8657500	If you do have something you think of after the fact and you want to email us, you always can.
8658500	8659500	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
8660500	8663500	And you guys know the thing we ask every week here on the show and we really do appreciate it.
8663500	8666500	Tell a friend or two about the shows.
8667500	8669500	A tweet. Send a tweet. That goes a long way.
8670500	8676500	And of course, what really helps, and I really can't stress this enough, reviews on sites because that helps you get visibility in the rankings.
8677500	8684500	So if you can just take 15 seconds to do a 5-star review on iTunes or wherever it is you found this show, those go an awful long way and is really appreciated.
8685500	8687500	That's all we ask. I'm not asking for your money.
8688500	8691500	Maybe your bits on Twitch, but that isn't technically a part of Orange Lounge Radio.
8691500	8694500	That's just another thing that Rob Roberts does as well as this show.
8695500	8699500	I think the time is here for us to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
8700500	8702500	DarkSakura, we'll start with you. Your final thoughts tonight?
8703500	8706500	I really still want Mongolian BBQ and I will do it for money.
8707500	8710500	Alright. Loki, how about your final thought?
8711500	8715500	I think I'm trying to play some more Overwatch this week just so that I can say that I did it.
8716500	8718500	That's good. And you actually bought it, so you don't even need the free weekend anymore, right?
8718500	8719500	You don't need the free weekend anymore.
8720500	8725500	Yeah, awesome. And my final thought is excellent work on the ginger drink, DarkSakura.
8726500	8729500	It's all I've drank tonight and I think you guys can all tell it's had its effects.
8730500	8732500	So be safe out there everybody. Have a safe weekend.
8733500	8740500	Next week here on Orange Lounge Radio, we'll be back in 7 days and it's probably going to be our last normal show for like a month.
8741500	8744500	With E3 and the week off and the 15-year anniversary.
8745500	8747500	Next week's going to be like our last normal show for a month.
8748500	8752500	So YYR originally was going to be here in person again, which was going to be a lot of fun.
8753500	8755500	However, unfortunately he did have to cancel that trip due to other reasons.
8756500	8763500	So YYR, we said let's do something on the telephone because we need to grill him about multitasking and some of the things that he's been working on.
8764500	8768500	So we're going to talk to him a little bit next week on the show and just catch up and have a good old time.
8769500	8770500	Sounds good.
8771500	8772500	And we'll have a good old time with you guys here again in 7 days.
8773500	8775500	We hope to see you again here at Orange Lounge Radio.
8775500	8777500	Have happy gaming. Have a great rest of your holiday.
8778500	8780500	And we'll see you soon. Good night!
8806500	8808500	But you know they were all still true.
8811500	8812500	See you next week.
8835500	8837500	See you next week.
