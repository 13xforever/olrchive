19000	24000	Then stay tuned instead to hear about Overwatch, more Project Rap Rabbit, and autonomous driving fears played out in gaming.
24000	27000	And yes, it all starts right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	37000	Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37000	45000	It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight on May the 21st of 2017, episode number 687 of our show.
45000	50000	My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E.
50000	54000	And joining me, as always, not just yet, DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
55000	61000	She's literally on her way, she had another event just before the show tonight, so she'll be joining us in a few moments here as she comes in live.
61000	65000	But I do have some other folks here in the studio to say hello to, of course, Techmaster Loki!
65000	66000	Hello.
66000	67000	Hi Loki, how are you?
67000	68000	I'm fine.
68000	69000	Hey, you got a brand new toy.
69000	70000	Yes I did.
70000	71000	It's shiny, it's shiny and it needed the wifi password.
71000	72000	Yes it did.
72000	74000	What is this? You bought a new laptop, right?
74000	75000	I bought a new laptop, yes.
75000	78000	And that keyboard kind of glows like my keyboard.
78000	81000	It's RGB, and it matches my Tron background that I have.
81000	88000	Oh, very cool. So what all went into it? So you got a new laptop because your other one was kind of...
88000	95000	My other one is kind of, it's full of malware, and I just didn't feel like redoing everything on it.
95000	102000	Also, it's overheating. I've had bad luck with old Asus laptops.
102000	110000	The old ones that they had, not so much the Republic of Gaming stuff that they have now, but the old ones were like not thermally designed well.
110000	114000	And so they would overheat. In fact, this was my first laptop, my first Asus laptop.
114000	116000	Pretty much melted when Titanfall hit it.
116000	120000	And then I had to buy this last one, which was a replacement.
120000	123000	It was kind of one I had to pick up.
123000	128000	It was whatever was available at Fry's at the time, and it was an AMD, an ATI...
128000	135000	Well, I guess it's an AMD chip now too. The GPU, CPU, and an APU processor.
135000	139000	I just wasn't all that satisfied with it. It was slightly better spec-wise than my old laptop.
139000	146000	But it was getting old. I mean, it was like a few years old when I bought it, and now it's three more years old and just needed something new.
146000	156000	So I got a brand new laptop. It's got like a Core i7 in it, 16GB of RAM, a GTX 1060 with 6GB of RAM.
156000	161000	Pretty much can run anything. Oh, and it has a 5TB hard drive in it because I'll never fucking fill that up.
161000	165000	You have more space on that than I do on my desktop that's not even that old.
165000	166000	Exactly.
166000	168000	That's a lot of porn. That's a lot of porn.
169000	172000	Yeah, it could be a lot of porn. But who downloads porn nowadays?
172000	173000	Oh, it's all streaming. Of course.
173000	175000	It's all available on the internet. There's really no point.
177000	184000	No, I mean, yeah. I could literally... I was backing up my laptop, my old one, and just kind of copying over what I needed.
184000	193000	Because most of it was just Unity Project stuff, and I didn't have to really move any games over because I needed to download that crap again.
193000	201000	But it felt like it was a lot of space, and I look at my hard drive's usage, and it's like, nothing.
201000	204000	It's like, come on. Is this it? Seriously?
204000	211000	Let me introduce our live chatroom, of course, because we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific and 9 o'clock Eastern at The Voice of Geeks Network.
211000	214000	vognetwork.com, right after The Bobby Black Wolf Show.
214000	218000	And if you are listening live, you can join us in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
218000	224000	And Bobby Black Wolf, who I just referred to, says in chat, or I should say asks, what's the Wi-Fi password?
224000	228000	It's blackwolfsucks123!
228000	231000	Because, you know, all passwords have to have numbers and punctuation in them.
231000	236000	Bobby's also asking, does Loki's old laptop make him want to cry?
236000	239000	Like, did you get hit with want to cry? Is that why?
239000	241000	No, I didn't want to cry.
241000	246000	I'm the one at risk for that because I'm still on Windows XP, where all the IT people out there are going,
246000	252000	No, I've got, um, you know, I've got, it was, it should be still fine if I reset it.
252000	254000	It just runs really hot for no reason.
254000	260000	And I have my, you know, I bought a new laptop cooling pad for this laptop, but I think it's too small.
260000	262000	But for the other one, it actually works really well.
262000	267000	So, I may just end up wiping it, putting Minecraft on, give it to my son or something, you know, to use.
267000	270000	Oh, that's a, that's a cute idea. Like, put little kitty games.
270000	274000	I mean, it can still run, I mean, that's what I was playing Minecraft on.
274000	279000	Make him learn the way we did. Put Number Munchers, Odell Lake, put the classics.
279000	283000	He's already playing other stuff. I mean, he's got the Wii U and everything. He's not going to go for that.
283000	291000	But, um, yeah, I mean, it was just, I don't know, like, it has, like, some Chromium malware thing on it right now that's really pissing me off.
291000	295000	And I tried removing it. I think that's what kind of borked a bunch of stuff.
295000	300000	So, I just said, ah, fuck it. I'm not going to worry about fixing this laptop right now. It's kind of falling apart.
300000	304000	Just going to get a new one in. I got a great deal. This one is actually used.
304000	310000	I mean, it's practically brand new, except for, like, a couple tiny scratches on the top of the case, which is, like, who gives a shit?
310000	318000	Um, and it's fantastic. It's a, uh, Electrix, or, um, I think they call them, like, they go by a bunch of different names.
318000	326000	Clevo is another one. It's basically, it's Clevo shells. They have these laptop shells that a bunch of different companies fill with components.
326000	333000	And they're really nice. I mean, just no, um, bloatware installed on it. Just a clean copy of Windows.
333000	341000	And it just runs fantastic. I played, you know, Grand Theft Auto fully maxed out at, like, over 60 frames per second yesterday.
341000	345000	I was like, I can't even run this game on my old laptop. It was fucking awesome.
345000	349000	All right. Well, I'm going to ask you about some of the games you've been playing on your new laptop.
349000	353000	But I figure that's probably best to hold on to How Was Your Gaming Week, which we'll get to in a little while.
353000	357000	I'm going to have you start us with our kickoff topic in a little bit, though, with that story that we have.
357000	362000	But first, of course, I want to introduce our other folks in the studio here while we still wait for Dark Soccer to arrive.
362000	368000	We have folks that you've heard on the show plenty of times before say hello to JD, joining us again tonight.
368000	369000	Hi.
369000	370000	Hi. How are you?
370000	371000	Doing pretty well.
371000	374000	Yeah, good, good. What's new with you since the last time we saw you?
374000	375000	I moved to Japantown.
375000	384000	That's right. So you're within walking distance of all that fun stuff that's, you know, everybody likes to crash San Francisco in the area during the Sakura Cherry Blossom Festival, right?
384000	386000	Yeah, I actually moved during the second weekend of that.
386000	388000	Oh, of that. What good timing.
388000	391000	I'm sure that was a lot of fun. Just pull up the U-Haul right next to all that other...
391000	392000	Made it work.
392000	394000	Yeah, you made it work. Good, good. You survived?
394000	395000	I think so.
395000	401000	And now you're within walking distance of that cute little arcade there that has, like, pop-in music and some of our old music game favorites, right?
401000	411000	Yeah. Two pop-ins, a DDRX3, a Rhythm Tengoku arcade, which is not something I'd seen anywhere else, and a Taiko... I think it's Taiko 9.
411000	420000	Nice. Well, that's fun. So, congrats on the move. And good thing you got out of the city this weekend because Beta Breakers is going on right now, or was earlier today, right?
420000	422000	Yeah, it was today. It's a mess.
422000	428000	A lot of people are probably still hungover. If you don't know what this is, it's like only in San Francisco is Beta Breakers. It's...
428000	431000	Alan is also joining us. Hubby, Alan is here.
431000	432000	Hello.
432000	433000	Hi, how are you?
433000	434000	I'm good.
434000	436000	You were about to explain for us what Beta Breakers is.
436000	445000	I was gonna say it's sort of a race question mark. A silly walk fitness question mark.
445000	459000	Basically, they walk from the west side to the east side... no, east side to the west side of San Francisco in costumes, and there's lots of day drinking, and lots of people are naked, and it's basically... it just shuts down the city and makes traffic a shit show.
459000	466000	Sounds very San Francisco. Anyway, let me talk to JD a little more, and I'm gonna come back to you, Alan, in a little bit for our little kickoff topic tonight.
467000	476000	But JD, so I guess this kind of gets into our gaming week a little bit, but I know you've been playing console stuff as has I. We have other things we can talk about, but you and I took a little arcade adventure yesterday.
476000	477000	Yeah.
477000	488000	We went out to the arcade that I talked about a couple weeks ago on the show, where... because I wanted you to be able to play Pump It Up, which I knew they had. I wanted you to see this little bootleg machine that took over our show for two weeks, right?
488000	495000	I wanted you to see like all the cool stuff they had. And then, so we got there and found that there's more, like the machines have been mating.
495000	502000	There was now a Sound Voltex machine and a U-Beat. Two of them. Two U-Beats. Which is kind of the one...
502000	505000	Is this all like, what's his name? The guy that...
505000	506000	It is.
506000	508000	I thought so, because he keeps moving his machines.
508000	516000	All the stuff that used to... it's like the presence that used to be at Scandi is now over here. It took us a little while to figure that out, but that's apparently what's happening.
516000	518000	Well, his name is on the Sound Voltex machine.
518000	519000	Yes.
519000	521000	When you log in with EMUs, like it says it's his.
521000	527000	Yeah, yeah. Which I finally got to play Sound Voltex for the first time. Because every time I go to round one, like even when we go early, we'll go to round one like open.
527000	535000	Because that's when it's the least crowded, right? We always go to these things early. That's what old people do. They get up early and they go to mall walks, right?
535000	546000	They walk around the mall. So we did the mall walking at round one. And there's actually the Sound Voltex machines will also have people on them that early.
547000	558000	So I usually never am able to get in and play that game, but I was finally able to play it. It was fun. I liked it. I still kind of like... I kind of like Neon FM a little more, I think.
558000	563000	Which might be... I don't know. That might be Sacrilegion, some circles. I don't know. Maybe it's just because this...
563000	564000	They're different games.
564000	574000	They're very different games. They're also very different song lists. And I don't... it's hard to explain. Like I just don't... like the J-pop stuff doesn't resonate with me the way that it used to.
574000	578000	I mean, a good portion of the song list these days is Vocaloid and Toho, so...
578000	592000	That's very true as well, so. But what was I gonna say? So I... but when I played Neon FM, like my hands were hurting. Like just from slamming all the... you know, because it's basically... it's basically pop music, but like, you know, five...
592000	595000	With flat pads instead of popping out buttons.
595000	600000	But I had a good time. So we had a good time on our arcade adventure. Was there a favorite thing that you played?
600000	611000	Oh, man. You know... I think it's probably... I'm gonna be lame. It's... it's... it was a tie between the StepMania cabinet and the DDR 2014.
611000	616000	Because you're old school. You like dancing. Even though those pads were moving as you were dancing. That's so funny.
616000	628000	Oh, man. Yeah. They... so I played doubles a lot. And these pads were not anchored down nearly enough. So I was playing and they moved probably like a foot and a half or something. And I had to move them back after each song.
628000	629000	Alright.
629000	634000	I thought they had feet on those things. They probably do, but they weren't using them.
634000	641000	They weren't planted down very well. Alright. Well, I'm going to introduce here because she walked into the studio as we were having that little discussion.
641000	643000	Hi, Dark Soccer or Jamie Summers.
643000	645000	Hi, I'm on Sister Time.
645000	655000	Oh, because you're running late. I got it. I was like, wait a minute, wait a minute. I've heard... I've heard gay time. I've heard a lot of different, you know, descriptions for why somebody runs late, but Sister Time.
655000	656000	That's the same family.
656000	660000	Yeah, it's all in the same family. It really is. I thought you'd still have full white face like I saw on Facebook earlier.
660000	674000	I actually came home relatively in enough time, but I was so exhausted that I passed out. Like I sat on my bed. I washed my face off. Everything was fine. I sat on my bed. Midna comes in and then dead.
674000	678000	The heat here right now is no joke though. Like it's already summer weather.
678000	681000	We had some nice shade. We were all shady.
681000	682000	Of course.
682000	686000	But I got to meet some of the San Francisco sisters and made some new friends.
686000	687000	Good.
687000	698000	And it was just nice seeing, you know, seeing the smiles and recognition and people seeing their mood light up by having the sisters and pride.
698000	701000	In that freaking heat. I mean, the fact that you guys did all that.
701000	702000	That wasn't terrible.
702000	703000	Really? That's good.
703000	710000	Well, out in the sun. Yeah, it was terra bad. But in the shade, it was really nice. We sat out. We had wine.
710000	713000	Okay. That's why you passed out drinking in this heat.
713000	714000	Girl.
714000	719000	No, I had like a little sippy cup of wine with a straw in it because I was wearing white face.
719000	722000	So I was drinking my Prosecco through a straw, which is classy as fuck.
722000	723000	Like a lady.
723000	724000	Like a lady.
724000	725000	Yeah.
725000	730000	But there was like a nice like an Italian ice place. It was really yummy.
730000	731000	Oh, yeah.
731000	734000	Especially in the weather. And I found out that lemon and cherry mix very well.
734000	735000	Yes, they do.
735000	738000	And there were vendors there and there was no parade because it's Davis.
738000	739000	Right.
739000	743000	But there were lots of vendors there and people singing and cheerleaders.
743000	744000	Mm hmm.
744000	749000	You know, they would like you pay them a dollar for their cheer thing and they would do a jump or a cartwheel.
749000	751000	One of the gals from Drag Race was supposed to be there, right? Trinity?
751000	753000	Trinity was supposed to be there, but I didn't see her.
753000	754000	Oh, that's too bad.
754000	764000	But I also left when the things were still going on because I as a postulant, I have to stay with my big sister or at least one of the other sisters.
764000	775000	And since they were all leaving to go to the coronation tonight or the investment for the local court, I got the OK to stay with the San Francisco sisters.
775000	777000	So we just hung out dishing and it was great.
777000	780000	It's a lip sync. What part of that don't you understand?
780000	782000	Just kidding.
782000	784000	OK. OK.
784000	787000	It just clicked for her. It just clicked for her when I was raising.
787000	790000	No, no, no, no, no, no, don't because some people haven't watched it.
790000	791000	All right.
791000	793000	All right. I'm just going to say this.
793000	795000	I am disappointed doubly.
795000	797000	Video games.
797000	799000	This is a video game show.
799000	801000	The other show is about this.
801000	802000	But that bitch.
802000	803000	All right. Anyway.
803000	804000	OK.
804000	806000	I had a Tyra moment.
806000	807000	I had a Tyra moment.
807000	808000	We all did. We all did.
808000	809000	All right. Look.
809000	811000	Speaking of that bitch, Alan.
811000	813000	Just kidding.
813000	814000	Hearts.
814000	815000	How have you been?
815000	816000	We haven't heard from you in a while.
816000	817000	Fine.
817000	818000	I know your day's office switched around a little bit.
818000	819000	I'm on a new schedule.
819000	821000	Yeah, you're able to you're able to join us now on Sunday night.
821000	822000	So I like that a lot.
822000	825000	So I want to talk VR with you a little bit.
825000	828000	So you got a new toy this week, right?
828000	829000	Yes.
829000	831000	Tell us a little bit about it.
831000	834000	I got a Galaxy S8 on launch day.
834000	839000	And they had it because my my previous phone was literally dying and I was practically unusable.
839000	841000	So the timing was great.
841000	845000	And they had a promotion where if you got a Galaxy S8,
846000	851000	which is the first phone that they've released since the Note 7 like was blowing up,
851000	855000	like in people's hands and spraying, spraying battery acid everywhere.
855000	857000	So this was kind of a big deal release.
857000	859000	Literally banned in all airports.
859000	860000	Yeah.
860000	869000	And you got if you got the S8 in a certain window, you got a Gear VR, which is Samsung's at home
869000	875000	Oculus equivalent VR device that uses your phone.
875000	879000	You actually pop your phone into the front of it.
879000	882000	And it arrived Thursday and I've been messing around with it.
882000	888000	So tell us a little bit about what you like what you've been using the device for.
888000	893000	I did get a code that had a bunch of like cheap games on it for free.
893000	897000	I've been checking them out and I bought a couple for like four or five bucks each.
897000	899000	You've been spending money on that? No, I'm just kidding.
900000	902000	My favorite one so far is the scary one.
902000	908000	Not because it's scary, but I just feel like the way that the hand controller is used as your flashlight
908000	911000	and the way the VR looks when you're walking through the house.
911000	912000	What's the name of it? Do you know?
912000	913000	Affected the Manner.
913000	914000	Okay.
914000	921000	There are three other or two other episodes, but they're for the Oculus proper
921000	925000	because the Oculus Rift you hook up to a PC, I believe, and the PC runs the game.
925000	926000	Yeah, right.
926000	929000	And it's pipe to the thing. This all has to be run on your phone.
929000	934000	So even though the S8 is, I think, the strongest processing power of all the phones on the market,
934000	939000	at least I would hope it is, it's still not going to be at the level of what an Oculus can do
939000	942000	simply because you hook an Oculus up to a computer.
942000	945000	And Tiger Claw on our chat is asking, is it the regular S8 or the S8 Plus?
945000	946000	S8 Plus.
946000	950000	Yeah, I was going to say you have the larger phone like I do with the iPhone 6 Plus.
950000	954000	They do have, I don't know if you've tried it yet, they have something that you can actually run on your PC
954000	959000	and stream it to your phone like actual Oculus proper games using that.
959000	960000	Oh.
960000	961000	Something to try.
961000	962000	Yeah, for sure.
962000	963000	Yeah, I wonder how that would.
963000	966000	Since you probably have a pretty powerful PC then, you know, that might.
966000	967000	Yeah.
967000	969000	Or you could use Bluetooth or Wi-Fi or whatever.
969000	973000	Yeah, you could even use my PC to do it too because we just upgraded mine.
973000	977000	I was trying to get you to play one or two games before the show so you could talk about it a little.
977000	981000	Yeah, I've had a lot of personal stuff going on today so I wasn't able to get around to doing that.
981000	982000	But I'm curious to check it out.
982000	983000	But let's.
983000	984000	Okay, look.
984000	985000	This is Orange Tons Radio.
985000	987000	Y'all heard the warning in the beginning.
987000	989000	This is an adult audiences show.
989000	990000	Yeah.
990000	996000	So let's not hold back because everybody fucking knows what we did with that thing first.
996000	997000	Yes.
997000	999000	Of course, it's VR porn.
999000	1000000	I mean, that's.
1000000	1001000	Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
1001000	1004000	That's what we did at the Oculus Dev Kids.
1004000	1005000	Let's look at porn on this.
1005000	1006000	Ding, ding, ding.
1007000	1011000	Even Bobby Black Wolf and his family friendly show.
1011000	1012000	Fantastic.
1012000	1013000	He knows.
1013000	1014000	It's like so weird.
1014000	1015000	I mean.
1015000	1016000	It's not sexy.
1016000	1017000	That man knows.
1017000	1018000	That man knows.
1018000	1023000	The very first time I saw this VR stuff, you know, he was like, okay, here's the roller coaster sim.
1023000	1024000	And isn't that kind of neat?
1024000	1028000	And here's the, okay, here's the walk around the house and look at all this stuff, sim.
1028000	1030000	And then, you know, I'm doing all these things.
1030000	1032000	He's like, all right, I know you want to see the porn.
1032000	1033000	Here's the porn.
1033000	1034000	So I got to see.
1034000	1038000	You just need to combine the two because everyone does the roller coasters and porn.
1038000	1039000	We need a porno coaster.
1039000	1042000	And then you download, you know, glory, hallelujah.
1042000	1045000	Is that what, is that what y'all sang in church today, sisters?
1045000	1046000	All right.
1046000	1047000	Here's the thing.
1047000	1048000	Here's the thing.
1048000	1051000	Well, on that note, believe it or not, here's the thing.
1051000	1054000	Bobby Black Wolf being a heterosexual male.
1054000	1060000	I know that the porn I was going to see on that was going to be, you know, a lady who is going to walk over and
1060000	1062000	fillet me in the first person.
1062000	1065000	And that was, that was what the porno was that I watched.
1065000	1071000	However, I don't know if any, I'm sure any podcast has talked about VR and VR porn probably has talked about that.
1071000	1075000	But has any podcast talked about gay pornography in the VR?
1075000	1078000	Because we're about to go there, ladies and gentlemen.
1078000	1079000	I know it exists.
1079000	1080000	Yes, it exists.
1080000	1085000	And I'm not going to get super detailed, but I didn't say Alan wouldn't get it super detailed.
1085000	1093000	Alan, tell us about the gay porn on the VR.
1093000	1102000	The fact that it's first person so that it's happening in quotey fingers to you is very strange and jarring because everything is up close in your face.
1102000	1106000	Like, you see everything.
1106000	1109000	You see, you see glory, glory, hallelujah.
1109000	1114000	You see Christmas and New Year's.
1114000	1121000	And it's like, there are certain models that probably don't want to be in front of that camera because they're like, you know what, my butthole isn't that photogenic.
1121000	1124000	You could tell that was a freshly waxed vehicle.
1124000	1125000	Yes.
1125000	1128000	Like that was just, it was a bit much.
1128000	1135000	And they say that that bleaching it is an urban legend, but I'm convinced that it's real because I think this boy had it done.
1135000	1136000	Anyway.
1136000	1141000	And basically, I hear the clicks across America in the world of people shutting off the show.
1141000	1143000	Those are like clicks.
1143000	1145000	I hope, I hope.
1145000	1148000	But anyway, dialing it back just a little bit.
1148000	1150000	Like, what, what?
1150000	1153000	These things are all like first person and all that.
1153000	1155000	But here's, here's the $50,000 question.
1155000	1156000	Is it hot?
1156000	1157000	No.
1157000	1162000	So the other thing that threw me off about it was that it was just a static video.
1162000	1165000	Like, I mean, it was, it wasn't interactive at all.
1165000	1171000	And I mean, when we were talking about VR and this heavily immersive experience, I was kind of expecting to have more agency.
1171000	1179000	You know, like, you can see, like, even in the lobby of the Oculus, you walk around, you look at things, you do stuff, it responds to you.
1179000	1182000	This was just, it felt like a 3D movie or something.
1182000	1183000	And it wasn't.
1183000	1191000	There are some that have 360 view where if you want to turn your back on the boy wanking in the bed and just look out the window, you can.
1191000	1192000	Yeah.
1192000	1194000	You're like, ooh, I'm sorry.
1194000	1196000	What have I done with my life?
1196000	1197000	I'm interrupting you.
1197000	1199000	You're like, I'll give you some privacy and you turn around.
1199000	1202000	I feel like it needed to go farther to do something for me.
1202000	1203000	Yeah.
1203000	1208000	And when I, I started laughing and when I put, I'm like, you have to watch this one.
1208000	1211000	Cause I found some free trailers that were like 40 seconds long.
1211000	1212000	You were like screaming.
1212000	1218000	I was, I was screaming, laughing, like doing the full on, like, like I just, I, it was, it was funny.
1218000	1220000	Porn's funny.
1220000	1221000	It's not hot.
1221000	1222000	It's not hot at all.
1222000	1223000	At all.
1223000	1233000	And I thought maybe like, it's going to be a scene just in 3d where I'm like this weird ghost person watching them, but no, it's through the perspective of it happening to you, which makes it far more shocking.
1233000	1240000	It's like the, it's like the first time I can look down and not see my stomach just hanging there.
1240000	1241000	You're like, oh, I have abs.
1241000	1242000	I want, I want it for this.
1242000	1244000	That was the hottest fucking part of it.
1244000	1246000	Get, get the, get the other guy out of the way.
1246000	1248000	I want to look down and see abs.
1248000	1250000	JV wants to jump in here.
1250000	1252000	See, now I have to invent glory.
1252000	1253000	Hallelujah.
1253000	1258000	Because it would come with like, it would come with a peripheral.
1258000	1260000	Yeah, I bet it would bitch.
1260000	1265000	It would come with an interactive peripheral that's based off of stimulation from the game.
1265000	1267000	Copyright Jamie forever.
1267000	1274000	That's, that's where they've already beat you to it because they already have devices that work with those, those, we saw that three years ago.
1274000	1277000	The E3, feel three or whatever that thing was.
1277000	1278000	I think that was before VR.
1278000	1280000	I didn't think that had like attachments.
1280000	1281000	You just did it.
1281000	1284000	That thing had like a little wanker.
1284000	1286000	Like what is, what do they call that thing?
1286000	1287000	The wank mode.
1287000	1289000	No.
1289000	1290000	The flashlight.
1290000	1291000	Thank you.
1291000	1292000	It's a flesh, I knew you'd know it.
1292000	1299000	It was, it was a fleshlight type attachment that you used when you were doing that, but it was more like a second life type of game, I think.
1299000	1300000	Yeah, it was.
1300000	1309000	And I remember boy play girl, whatever, but see, but see that, that I want to make that an OLR dream game now.
1309000	1310000	All right.
1310000	1321000	And I, but to, to defend Bobby's honor a little bit, he is in chat saying, Rob, I would have totally had it available for you if it was around and I was showing you the DK one.
1321000	1323000	They just had, it's true that didn't come around.
1323000	1324000	They hadn't invented gay porn yet.
1324000	1325000	That came later.
1325000	1327000	There's just one website that I found.
1327000	1328000	Yeah.
1328000	1329000	Cause I was like, there's gotta be something.
1329000	1330000	Exactly right.
1330000	1331000	And I just found this one site.
1331000	1332000	Yeah.
1332000	1333000	So the games that I have.
1333000	1334000	Oh yeah.
1334000	1335000	Video games.
1335000	1336000	Right.
1336000	1343000	Well, one issue that I have, especially with affected the manner, the scary game is that they're all, they're like basically four different paths.
1343000	1346000	You can go down, but they all end ultimately the same way.
1346000	1348000	It's not really a game.
1348000	1356000	And I noticed that a lot of these VR experiences, they're not even like gone home or something where it's like a first person narrative.
1357000	1360000	You're sort of like walking through and like, Oh, this is trippy.
1360000	1364000	Oh, I really like how it uses the flashlight effect and then jump scare.
1364000	1365000	And then it's over.
1365000	1366000	And it's like, there's no puzzles.
1366000	1369000	And it's, that's not the only game that was like that.
1369000	1376000	And so it's kind of weird to find out, is this really a game or is this just like a neat thing to last me like 20 minutes of just.
1376000	1381000	I think it's still because all VR, all this VR stuff is still in that gimmick phase.
1381000	1385000	It's just like, you know, with the DS and we, and so they don't really know how to utilize the hardware well.
1385000	1389000	So it's all these experimental, like, Oh, that's a neat idea.
1389000	1395000	Let's do that a million times, you know, not really utilizing it in an innovative way.
1395000	1407000	Like I think right now, the best thing we have like for VR, probably Resident Evil 7 is probably going to be one of the strongest examples of like a AAA game done exclusively in VR.
1407000	1410000	Well, PlayStation VR is doing a lot right in that department.
1411000	1420000	But in, but in a way, I mean, just to be fair, you know, when we, when we talked a lot about this, when Facebook bought Oculus and it was like, Oh my God, why would Facebook do this?
1420000	1421000	And that all this stuff.
1421000	1425000	And we were kind of like, well, wait a minute, maybe there's more to VR than just gaming.
1425000	1433000	So to be fair, you know, a lot of these experiences and videos, you know, I know we're having fun talking about porn, but we've, we've seen other stuff in VR too.
1433000	1435000	I mean, I remember seeing a Cirque du Soleil thing.
1435000	1443000	I saw like the, the last Paul McCartney concert at Candlestick Park, you know, before they closed Candlestick Park down, they, there was a VR thing for that.
1443000	1446000	So like, you know, it's definitely shown that there can be experiences.
1446000	1451000	And I would think, especially when it comes to mobile devices and stuff, games are not going to be the strong point of mobile devices.
1451000	1457000	It's going to be these more like immersive, like, Oh, it's almost like I was there type of experience.
1458000	1464000	You know, like I'm surprised maybe that did exist, but Coachella didn't have like a VR thing where you could be a Coachella virtually.
1464000	1465000	It probably did exist.
1465000	1466000	I just didn't see it.
1466000	1469000	There's this thing on here like that where it's Major Lazer and Diplo.
1469000	1470000	Yeah.
1470000	1471000	And watch him on stage.
1471000	1476000	But now you go to PlayStation and PlayStation's bread and butter is games.
1476000	1480000	So I would hope that the strongest stuff over there is going to be games.
1480000	1483000	And so far that does seem to be true between Resident Evil 7.
1483000	1484000	It's hit and miss.
1484000	1486000	A lot of people love the rush of blood.
1486000	1487000	I love rush of blood.
1487000	1491000	I think that's for if you're going to get PlayStation VR, pick that up first.
1491000	1492000	Twenty bucks.
1492000	1494000	Great value for what you get.
1494000	1495000	It's such a great game.
1495000	1498000	Well, and then Thumper was one because I'm thinking of that.
1498000	1500000	I was thinking that because that came out on Switch and JD.
1500000	1504000	You were thinking like, do I want to get because I like music games, but rhythm violence.
1504000	1505000	What the hell is that?
1505000	1507000	So I was like, all right, let's put this on because I have it on PlayStation four.
1507000	1508000	Let's play it.
1508000	1513000	And I was like, you have to imagine this in VR because it's like twice as good when it's in VR.
1514000	1518000	The thing about Thumper was that it just wasn't musical enough for me to really get going with it.
1518000	1520000	Like it was definitely rhythmic.
1520000	1521000	It's not J-pop.
1521000	1522000	Well, it wasn't even that.
1522000	1523000	There was no melody.
1523000	1525000	Yeah, like it was just all percussive.
1525000	1530000	And I'm like, you know, I can kind of keep the beat and stuff, but it just wasn't fun the same way.
1531000	1536000	Interesting because Bobby points out a lot of those videos are also available on PlayStation VR.
1536000	1538000	The Paul McCartney one is in the Jaunt VR app.
1538000	1541000	Well, I guess and I guess that doesn't make sense because technically, I mean, yes,
1541000	1547000	I say the PlayStation is bread and butter is games, but the reality is it's also a Netflix device.
1547000	1548000	They sell movies on it.
1548000	1554000	They do these this live events viewer thing that I'm sure later in the show, we'll talk about E3 and all that.
1554000	1558000	You know, that is all part of PlayStation stuff as well.
1558000	1561000	But even when it comes down to Sony, they're a media company.
1561000	1562000	That's true.
1562000	1563000	That's true. Not just televisions.
1563000	1567000	Then the Oculus is actually what powers the Gear VR.
1567000	1572000	Like it's their storefront and it's their, I guess, API or UI that you navigate on the phone.
1572000	1578000	So there are 3D movies like X-Men Days of Future Past that I could buy on this to see a 3D movie.
1578000	1585000	But the idea of even just laying in bed with this thing on my head watching a full movie for two hours seems very strange.
1585000	1589000	I don't want to I'd rather watch it on an at home 3D TV, which we have.
1590000	1592000	Yeah, but to be fair, it sucks.
1593000	1594000	Like the 3D TV, it sucks.
1594000	1597000	Those glasses don't even work anymore. It sucks.
1598000	1602000	The game that I was playing that was actually a really good puzzle game is called Rangi.
1602000	1610000	And I don't want to say it's portalesque, but basically you're in a room and you see the door that you're supposed to exit through and the color tile above the door is orange.
1610000	1614000	And you look and you see like a blue beam and a red beam and a yellow beam.
1614000	1618000	Well, if you're trying to get the color orange, the blue beam is like a red hair.
1618000	1626000	Like you don't care about the blue beam because you want to slide these tiles over so that the red and the yellow merge.
1626000	1631000	And then you direct the orange beam at the door and then the door unlocks and you go to the next room.
1631000	1635000	That I thought was really cool because you look up and you're like, oh, there's a cliff up there.
1635000	1641000	So then you click and you teleport up there and you find that there's another tile for you to flip to reflect the laser or whatever.
1641000	1644000	I thought that was a neat game. So I want to play more of that.
1644000	1658000	And then I have Drop Dead, which is a zombie game, but it's more like Time Crisis or where you lower your thing to reload and it's very fast and the zombies are just running at you.
1658000	1660000	So it's not really scary at all.
1660000	1667000	And Dragonfront, which is kind of like chess meets Magic the Gathering, but it's in, of course, 3D VR.
1667000	1673000	So you take your card and you put it down and it pops up and it turns into a little knight.
1673000	1675000	Oh, it's like I have judgment.
1675000	1676000	Yeah. Yeah.
1676000	1677000	Wow. OK.
1677000	1681000	Well, that. Yeah. But those had a real element to it. This is all in a virtual space.
1681000	1683000	Fair enough. Yeah.
1683000	1685000	But it's neat.
1685000	1686000	Now, let me ask this question.
1686000	1693000	I was going to say I wanted to try to get the Power Rangers thing they have for it to show Shane because the first we're like, hey, Shane, I have a gear VR.
1693000	1697000	There's porn on it. And he was immediately like, I'm not listening to anything you're ever going to say after this.
1697000	1698000	Right. Shutting down.
1698000	1700000	We offended his delegate sensibilities.
1700000	1701000	Right.
1701000	1706000	But I imagine if I had the Power Rangers movie VR experience on it, he would have tried it.
1706000	1707000	Gimme, gimme, gimme.
1707000	1712000	It's exclusive to some weird device that's also competing in the Oculus gear VR space.
1712000	1715000	So I don't remember. Bobby might know.
1715000	1717000	Was it a dream?
1717000	1719000	I think possibly.
1719000	1724000	So, yeah, I was looking for that, but I'm like, no, it's an exclusive because I want to see Power Rangers in VR.
1724000	1731000	Well, thank you for playing some games in VR and, you know, telling us a little bit about it, especially since I failed to do so this week.
1731000	1732000	But let me ask this.
1732000	1737000	So since you have been doing a little bit of VR gaming this week, you're now the show's VR expert.
1737000	1740000	Oh, I guess, I guess, Loki.
1740000	1751000	Also, you said conditionally that the only reason why you were trying it out the first night that I got it is because it literally uses my phone and the device so that I couldn't record you using it.
1751000	1754000	That was only when we were watching Christmas and New Year's.
1754000	1755000	So, okay.
1755000	1758000	So what was I gonna say? Oh, I know.
1758000	1761000	So let me ask this about your kind of VR experience.
1761000	1767000	So games that you play a lot of online, Mass Effect Andromeda, I know is one you're still playing a lot.
1767000	1773000	Despite everything we talked about, about that show in the past, or about that game in the past couple of weeks, you are still very loyal to Andromeda.
1773000	1774000	Yes.
1774000	1775000	You play multiplayer and all that stuff, right?
1775000	1778000	Would you play something like that in a VR space?
1779000	1785000	Does that appeal to you, being able to, you know, obviously, I know your phone doesn't have that power, but let's just put all that aside.
1785000	1791000	Let's assume that the capability was there that you could play something like Andromeda in a VR space, would you?
1794000	1806000	I would feel like, because when I'm in a space to play an RPG like that, I'll put in a couple hours worth and I just can't, even if I've trained myself up to being used to having the VR thing on my face for that long.
1806000	1811000	I just, it's so, I mean, it is isolating. You've got this thing on your head.
1811000	1819000	So I think it's going to be mostly a casual experience until they become more like glasses that you can slide on and off.
1819000	1820000	I don't know how to describe it.
1820000	1825000	I'm trying to think of a game that I play now. Like, I was looking for a music game.
1825000	1833000	Like, of course, Rez would be incredible on this, but again, that's very, like, you do a stage, then the stage is over, then you can stop.
1833000	1834000	Right.
1834000	1837000	So it's very, it's broken down into little bite-sized pieces.
1837000	1844000	And that's actually kind of my thing with it too, is that actually, well, I don't know, I think I might just need to calibrate it better for my head because I was getting a lot of the double vision stuff.
1844000	1846000	Yeah, you shouldn't be getting that at all.
1846000	1848000	My eyes were shifting in and out of focus, like really bad.
1848000	1853000	And I think, and that like can really give me a headache after a few minutes, at least with this particular device.
1853000	1859000	But, you know, I actually, I would say, you know, I realize it isn't VR, it's completely different.
1859000	1866000	But one of the better experiences I had was with HoloLens, because those were like glasses you put on your head and they didn't like pull on my eyes or any of that stuff.
1866000	1871000	Like, that's why I was able, I did that whole mystery game thing that Bobby had me go through.
1871000	1877000	And that was a lot of fun. And I was able to, that was a good, maybe 30 minutes that, you know, and I didn't feel anything after that.
1877000	1882000	Whereas five minutes of all the stuff we were doing, I was like, okay, I need, I need to take a break.
1882000	1883000	Yeah.
1884000	1890000	So, let's see. I'm going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com. Bobby answers your question here.
1890000	1896000	The Power Rangers stuff is only on Qualcomm's, Qualcomm's, oops, Snapdragon VR platform.
1896000	1897000	Okay.
1897000	1898000	Which literally nobody has.
1898000	1904000	SSG100Matt says, I've seen the VR porn on the Gear VR. It's really meh and more ridiculous than anything.
1904000	1905000	I wasn't expecting anything ridiculous.
1905000	1914000	The other thing I got too, which you might want to try, it's, there's this Google Card, or a thing that allow you play Google Cardboard apps as well using that.
1914000	1918000	That's another good one to get because there's a lot more that's available through the Google Play Store.
1918000	1924000	And Google's own home VR thing is coming out soon, I think. The Dream or no?
1924000	1926000	No, Dream's already out with the Pixel.
1926000	1927000	Okay.
1927000	1934000	That was the first phone that, but now, I mean, we'll get into it a little bit later, but like the Samsung Galaxy S8 is going to support Dream as well.
1934000	1941000	I mean, I don't know. It's just, it's basically, they're trying to make like a platform, okay, these phones are powerful enough to run this.
1941000	1948000	Kind of like how these graphics cards are VAR ready type thing. These phones are VR ready or VR AR ready or something like that.
1948000	1950000	What was the puzzle game that I played a bit of? Do you remember?
1950000	1951000	Lands End.
1951000	1952000	That one was really cool.
1952000	1953000	Which you liked.
1954000	1962000	Yeah. It reminded me a lot of Monument Valley a bit with the kind of episodic do a little bit of a puzzle here and then move on to the next area.
1962000	1968000	But it was really pretty. Like it takes place on a beach. And I mean, I'm a sucker for that kind of environment.
1968000	1975000	But it was mostly like just connecting line puzzles, but I thought it was fun, at least the first area.
1975000	1979000	Yeah. And I need to check that out because I think you've played that more than me.
1979000	1985000	And then I downloaded this one thing called Groove VR, Groover, thinking it was a music game.
1985000	1993000	But basically it's a very, it's like you're floating and there's like the sort of sea punk, like dolphins going through the sky.
1993000	1997000	And it's like, I don't smoke enough weed or take shrooms to be, for this to be enjoyable.
1997000	2003000	But it plays techno music and you're kind of just floating through and there's like a big Buddha statue with like green smoke coming out of its eyes.
2003000	2006000	I'm like, all right, this is like, it's like, yeah, yeah, we get it. You vape.
2006000	2013000	Yeah. It's basically, think of it as a 3D black light poster. That's exactly what it is.
2013000	2019000	It's a 3D black light poster. So, yeah, that's all. It's a thing that I have.
2019000	2023000	All right. No, I do want to try more of it when real life settles down a little bit.
2023000	2030000	But yeah, I mean, that's yeah. I'm glad that you brought VR into the house. Bobby's probably very glad you brought VR into the house.
2030000	2034000	So I'm curious to try out more stuff that isn't, you know, laughable.
2034000	2040000	Yeah. After you get this laptop, it sounds like, oh, hey, I maybe I should get a vibe. They saw $800 and like, fuck that noise.
2040000	2044000	Yeah. Yeah. Right. But I'm going to give Dark Sakura her mic back now so you can participate in the show.
2044000	2046000	All right. Well, thank you for being here, Alan. Appreciate it.
2046000	2050000	You're welcome. All right. Find some more porn. All right. Let me ask, we had a story about VR here.
2050000	2052000	We want to do at the top of the show too on a related note, right?
2052000	2054000	Yeah. Yeah. We can talk about that.
2054000	2062000	Yeah. So maybe the whole Google IO thing, which is pretty cool because I actually watched that a bit and there was some exciting announcements there showing off.
2062000	2070000	Of course, they talked a bit about VR, talking about, you know, the Google Dream platform or Daydream platform.
2070000	2078000	And some of the things they announced with that, as I mentioned, that they're adding the Galaxy S8 to the lineup of phones that are going to be supporting it.
2078000	2086000	There's also a new LG phone that's supporting it. I don't remember which phone it was, but a new LG phone is also going to be supporting the platform.
2087000	2097000	They're saying that they're also working on some standalone devices. So some that you won't actually need a phone to be able to play VR content on.
2097000	2103000	Which, I mean, it's a good idea, I guess, as long as they're significantly cheaper than the phones.
2103000	2109000	Because honestly, if you're going to need a phone, the devices themselves aren't really that expensive.
2109000	2123000	I mean, even if you're not necessarily picking up a Dream or the Daydream or the Gear VR, I mean, you can get cheap ass cardboard for pretty much nothing.
2123000	2129000	I mean, so, I don't know. But yeah, these standalone devices are saying they're not going to require a phone or PC.
2129000	2134000	Instead, you're going to be getting VR as simple as putting on the actual headset.
2134000	2141000	And it's going to be optimized for VR and include new headset tracking technology called WorldSense.
2141000	2146000	Which is positional tracking without all the extra sensors.
2146000	2153000	So it sounds like a lot, kind of what they're talking about with Microsoft's, the headsets that they're making for them.
2153000	2162000	Where it's going to be using, instead of having external cameras tracking the actual headset, the headset's tracking kind of the environment.
2163000	2168000	It also kind of sounds like the console of VR in a way, right? Because that's what consoles are, right?
2168000	2170000	They hook up directly to your TV and it's a game-dedicated device.
2170000	2173000	Honestly though, I mean, that's cool if you're going to launch that.
2173000	2183000	But I'm wary, just even with what's available on the Oculus Store and what's available on the Play Store.
2183000	2188000	There's not really anything that justifies having a standalone device using this.
2188000	2190000	Unless it's going to take a lot of that PC stuff.
2190000	2194000	But then you're just kind of like, well, how much is this thing really going to cost?
2194000	2196000	And if it's going to run PC content.
2196000	2201000	I just have a hard time seeing how that would be worth it.
2201000	2205000	I'm getting a little worried too, and I have been for some time.
2205000	2211000	And you all know this is my concern, is that I'm really worried this VR pool is super diluted right now.
2211000	2214000	Like, I'm not saying there should be only one player in VR.
2214000	2215000	Like, I'm not saying that at all.
2215000	2219000	But I'm having a really hard time keeping track of all these different devices.
2219000	2221000	I'm having to defer to Bobby Blackwell constantly.
2221000	2225000	What's that thing called? What's the Power Rangers thing on?
2225000	2228000	I just don't fucking know, and I kind of think that's a problem.
2228000	2235000	I don't know, I guess if I asked a non-video gamer what are the consoles available.
2235000	2237000	They would not be able to say off the top of their head,
2237000	2239000	Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch.
2239000	2241000	They would not be able to do that.
2241000	2247000	I just can't help but feel like we've got so many choices that that can't be productive, right?
2247000	2252000	But with that said though, what they're showing off with the AR stuff actually is really cool.
2252000	2257000	So with the whole visual positioning service that they're basically putting into these phones,
2257000	2262000	it allows it to basically kind of track your movement and everything based on your environment.
2262000	2269000	And because they know where you are based on your GPS, and they kind of know what you're looking at with their contextual AI,
2269000	2274000	they're able to do kind of some neat stuff.
2274000	2277000	So for example, one of the things that they showed off is like,
2277000	2282000	okay, you're looking at a restaurant on the street and you get kind of a pop-up showing,
2282000	2284000	okay, here are the reviews for this restaurant.
2284000	2288000	It knew what you were looking at. It was kind of like, okay, showing you information about that.
2288000	2293000	And so I can see that being kind of cool, especially if the tracking gets better.
2293000	2296000	I mean, you could do all sorts of cool stuff with that with AR.
2296000	2299000	So that's kind of what I think is a little bit more interesting.
2299000	2302000	I'm all for them putting more money into the VR stuff.
2302000	2308000	The other cool thing they were showing off was also this AR pioneer program.
2308000	2312000	So what that was is basically AR for classrooms.
2312000	2319000	So they had these sets that looked like they were on selfie sticks with a phone,
2319000	2328000	and they were actually doing different educational experiences.
2328000	2330000	So, okay, we're going to see what a tornado looks like,
2330000	2334000	or we're going to look at the galaxy or watch a volcano,
2334000	2335000	and they can walk around and look at it.
2335000	2337000	And I was like, that's pretty cool.
2337000	2342000	For kids, that's really going to get them engaged and kind of learning everything.
2342000	2343000	So that's kind of cool.
2343000	2344000	Yeah, that's pretty cool.
2344000	2346000	Again, showing my age here a little bit,
2346000	2351000	but I lived through that age when VHS devices were new in the homes.
2351000	2354000	I was young, like five, six, but still.
2354000	2359000	And I remember just educational tapes so that I could watch Leonard Nimoy
2359000	2360000	animating a movie.
2360000	2363000	And yes, this was a real tape that I had, these little science films,
2363000	2368000	where they would show pictures of traveling to Neptune,
2368000	2372000	or obviously there's only so much they have they put on the film.
2372000	2374000	But you guys know kind of where I'm going with this.
2374000	2377000	I think a lot of times they would show it to you through the telescope, whatever.
2377000	2382000	But as a kid, I remember like, holy shit, you could see these planets on my TV.
2382000	2387000	And that was technology when I was younger, 30 years ago when I was that age.
2387000	2389000	And now the fact that, okay, now the technology is like,
2389000	2392000	okay, now we put you on the fucking surface of Mars,
2392000	2395000	because we can do that, but that's still really cool for the kids.
2395000	2397000	The price of this technology is going to get cheaper and cheaper.
2397000	2400000	So we imagine these standalone headsets later on when,
2400000	2403000	okay, hey, we're going to visit the surface of Mars
2403000	2406000	because we actually have photographs of fucking Mars
2406000	2408000	that we can stitch together into some VR thing.
2408000	2410000	And I'm pretty sure that's probably already out there.
2410000	2411000	You can already do that.
2411000	2415000	But, you know, more mainstream where you can actually have kids experience that.
2415000	2417000	And that's kind of cool.
2417000	2420000	It's like you're literally visiting the surface of another planet.
2420000	2425000	I'm trying to parse some of this stuff in chat here over at live.vognetwork.com.
2425000	2427000	Let's see, SG100Matt says,
2427000	2429000	I could see the good in there being a lot of choices.
2429000	2433000	It forces everyone with a VR device to try to outdo the other and innovate.
2433000	2435000	Competition can lead to more or quicker innovation
2435000	2437000	as long as they see it's beneficial.
2437000	2439000	Kaijuto in chat says,
2439000	2441000	VR is not diluted at all.
2441000	2443000	It's like one day there isn't enough for VR,
2443000	2445000	the next there is too much for it.
2445000	2446000	Make up your minds, lol.
2446000	2448000	VR is fine and growing.
2448000	2450000	I mean, okay, yeah, VR is growing.
2450000	2456000	But I just, you know, if I wanted to start with VR, where should I go?
2456000	2459000	There's so many options right now.
2459000	2462000	I would assume, for me, I would go to PlayStation VR
2462000	2465000	simply because I'm a gamer and that's, you know.
2465000	2468000	I think it's going to be pretty interesting.
2468000	2471000	Especially now that you have Microsoft kind of,
2471000	2474000	they're going to base an operating system around VR AR.
2474000	2477000	I think once that stuff starts hitting,
2477000	2483000	I mean, God, in a decade's time we could be all using VR stuff as a PC.
2483000	2487000	You know, we're going to be going to work and using this virtual space.
2487000	2490000	And that's not going to be a weird thing.
2490000	2493000	Come on, confide in me and chat says,
2493000	2498000	I wonder if someday we'll be able to use AR to unlock a cute guy's private pics.
2498000	2500000	Like, woof, scruff, unlock his pics.
2500000	2504000	You know, be careful what you ask for because here's the thing.
2504000	2507000	I mean, look, everything is going to come back to the whole time to penis
2507000	2509000	and porn thing at the end of the day.
2509000	2513000	But, you know, I could see definitely like one place where VR is going,
2513000	2516000	especially with Facebook's involvement in this whole thing is,
2516000	2519000	you know, like your Facebook newsfeed.
2519000	2523000	You know, right now you can broadcast live video on Facebook, right?
2523000	2527000	And, you know, I don't see a whole lot of exciting, exciting stuff in there.
2527000	2530000	Like usually it's just a friend either playing a Blizzard game
2530000	2532000	because it's integrated or talking about their day.
2532000	2536000	Or I have one friend that will do drunk cooking,
2536000	2537000	which I think is a big thing on YouTube too.
2537000	2541000	They'll get on their Facebook feed and drink and cook to do that.
2541000	2546000	But I would think it's only a matter of time before in VR,
2546000	2551000	you could be at somebody's wedding that you couldn't be there in real life.
2551000	2556000	But you could still attend it in VR through Facebook streaming
2556000	2558000	and Oculus and all this tech.
2558000	2560000	Like I don't think the technology is obviously not totally there yet,
2560000	2562000	but like it's close.
2562000	2566000	And as the cost of all this stuff,
2567000	2569000	I mean, could you do that today?
2569000	2571000	Yes, you probably could.
2571000	2573000	But could your grandma easily see it?
2573000	2574000	Probably not.
2574000	2578000	But as the cost of this technology comes down and down and down
2578000	2581000	in the next few years, we're going to be there pretty quick.
2581000	2583000	So it's just interesting.
2583000	2584000	Anyway.
2584000	2586000	All right.
2586000	2589000	And some folks in our chat are complaining.
2589000	2592000	I guess our servers are having a little bit of a hiccup,
2592000	2595000	but it's not on our end.
2595000	2598000	It's on the server's end because we're still streaming
2598000	2599000	a consistent amount of data.
2599000	2601000	And more importantly, we didn't pop out of chat.
2601000	2603000	That's usually a good sign.
2603000	2605000	If it's on our end, we'll get disconnected from chat.
2605000	2606000	And that didn't happen.
2606000	2609000	But we're going to just try to push forward with our show anyway.
2609000	2613000	RageNator in chat says the servers are drunk cooking apparently.
2613000	2614000	Apparently.
2614000	2615000	Apparently that's happening.
2615000	2616000	All right.
2616000	2618000	Anyway, lots of good VR talk.
2618000	2619000	I'm sure there's going to be plenty more.
2619000	2620000	Plenty more.
2620000	2621000	E3 is around the corner.
2621000	2622000	Who knows?
2622000	2625000	I'm excited to see some more PlayStation VR announcements.
2625000	2626000	Yeah, I'm excited.
2626000	2630000	And I would like to see if Microsoft might be taking the next step
2630000	2631000	with HoloLens.
2631000	2634000	I'm assuming no because Scorpio is going to be their focus this year.
2634000	2637000	Just please don't announce a complete redesign of the PlayStation VR
2637000	2639000	headset because I'm going to feel a little bit pissed off
2639000	2640000	if that's going to be the case.
2640000	2641000	Yeah, well.
2641000	2643000	I don't have one yet, so they could do that.
2643000	2644000	But anyway.
2644000	2645000	No, I get it.
2645000	2646000	I get it.
2646000	2647000	All right.
2647000	2650000	Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games
2650000	2651000	that we have been playing this week.
2651000	2652000	Dark Soccer, I'll start with you.
2652000	2653000	How was your gaming week?
2653000	2657000	It was very light, just given work's been so busy.
2657000	2663000	But I played some World of Warcraft, some Pokemon Go, Miitomo.
2663000	2665000	Good lord.
2665000	2668000	And I played a lot of Bust-A-Move.
2668000	2671000	Like I played for like an hour and a half on like endless mode
2671000	2673000	and never lost.
2673000	2675000	And I was like, where did the fucking time go?
2675000	2679000	And then I realized that it went down the drain along with the rest
2679000	2680000	of my free time.
2680000	2683000	So that's really it.
2683000	2684000	Not a whole bunch.
2684000	2689000	Although Shane's trying to get me into this room 999 game.
2689000	2690000	Oh, yeah.
2690000	2691000	He's been talking about that.
2691000	2693000	He said, I don't know a lot about it.
2693000	2695000	I keep trying to get him to come back to the show to talk about it.
2695000	2697000	He said he's going to lend it to me.
2697000	2700000	It's like an escape room as a video game is what he kind of
2700000	2701000	described it to me as.
2701000	2704000	It looks like it was up my alley because of the light down in Roompa.
2704000	2707000	That's kind of funny because I thought escape rooms were based
2707000	2708000	on Flash games to begin with.
2709000	2710000	Like the Crimson Room?
2710000	2711000	Or the Red Room?
2711000	2713000	Yeah, like all those little Japanese Flash games where it's like
2713000	2715000	you're stuck in a room and you have to put the clues together.
2715000	2716000	I thought that's what they did.
2716000	2718000	The real life escape room was based on.
2720000	2722000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange
2722000	2726000	Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase LAMP.
2726000	2729000	I thought when I heard, this is a while back when we were like
2729000	2733000	selling that game, I thought it was like Saw.
2733000	2735000	If I remember, maybe I'm thinking...
2735000	2737000	It's kind of, from what I understand, it's a mix.
2737000	2740000	There is some Saw-like elements to it.
2740000	2743000	But the first thing I told Shane was I hate those movies.
2743000	2745000	But he says it's not like in-your-face gore.
2745000	2747000	It's kind of like off-camera type of thing.
2747000	2749000	So I was like, alright, I guess I could probably handle that.
2749000	2752000	I mean, if I can play Silent Hill, I can handle some of it.
2752000	2754000	So, anyway.
2755000	2757000	Alright, well then, if that's it for Dark Soccer's Gaming Week,
2757000	2760000	let's talk about Loki's Gaming Week.
2760000	2763000	So, I played a few mobile games.
2763000	2766000	So, of course, more office space, idle profits.
2766000	2768000	Because it's still entertaining.
2768000	2770000	A little bit of Pokemon Go.
2770000	2772000	Although, I got to say, this event that they did
2772000	2774000	was like some rock-type adventure event thing.
2774000	2776000	It's pretty lame.
2776000	2779000	I guess we just have a lot of rock-type Pokemon around here already.
2779000	2782000	So, it's just like, it's the same shit.
2782000	2785000	I didn't notice anything. It's like, oh, more Rhyhorns.
2785000	2786000	Hooray.
2786000	2789000	That's how the water and grass events were for me in San Francisco.
2789000	2792000	It's the same, it's just if you have what's already there,
2792000	2794000	you're not going to see a difference.
2794000	2796000	I just wish they would, yeah.
2796000	2798000	Well, they have like, oh, there's going to be an Aerodactyl.
2798000	2800000	Okay, cool. I don't have that.
2800000	2802000	Let's catch that.
2802000	2804000	Nope. Not seeing that anywhere.
2804000	2806000	Fucking liars.
2806000	2808000	So, yeah, it's been alright.
2808000	2810000	I mean, I don't know.
2810000	2812000	It's not as exciting as some of the other events that they've had.
2812000	2814000	So, I'll just look forward to the next one, I guess.
2814000	2816000	And then, of course, I got the new laptops.
2816000	2820000	So, I've been just slowly loading some stuff on there.
2820000	2822000	Probably going to do some modded Skyrim,
2822000	2826000	because now I can mod the hell out of it and do all the fancy EMB stuff.
2826000	2828000	But, haven't bothered to do that just yet.
2828000	2830000	I did try a couple things.
2830000	2833000	One of the last games I picked up was a game called,
2833000	2839000	it's hardly a game, but it's an application called Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator.
2839000	2844000	It's basically this Unity game where you put tons of units down
2844000	2846000	and you watch them battle against each other.
2846000	2848000	So, you can do ridiculous shit like,
2848000	2853000	okay, it's a thousand T-Rexes versus some Archers and stuff like that.
2853000	2854000	And it's just fun to watch.
2854000	2855000	So, I did that for about ten minutes.
2855000	2857000	I'm like, okay, I've seen that.
2857000	2858000	Now, I'm going to go do something else.
2858000	2861000	So, of course, it's been a while since I went back to Grand Theft Auto.
2861000	2866000	And so, I picked up Grand Theft Auto 5 and I loaded on there.
2866000	2868000	And I started playing through the story again.
2868000	2872000	So, it looks fantastic on my laptop.
2872000	2877000	And, yeah, I mean, I'm probably going to pick up Overwatch.
2877000	2881000	I was going to pick it up this weekend,
2881000	2883000	but I think we're going to get into a new story about it later.
2883000	2886000	I'm going to wait a couple days, which is probably a good idea.
2886000	2888000	We can say the free weekend's coming up.
2888000	2890000	Yeah, the free weekend's coming up,
2890000	2892000	and then they're doing a game of the year edition.
2892000	2894000	So, I'll pick up the game of the year edition when it comes out.
2894000	2899000	And then Forza Horizon 3, I'm probably going to pick that up.
2899000	2902000	I was going to pick up an Xbox One controller to go with it,
2902000	2904000	but my fucking god, those are expensive.
2904000	2906000	I still use the 360 controller.
2906000	2911000	It was like 80 bucks for the controller that doesn't fucking have a rechargeable battery.
2911000	2914000	You've got to buy a rechargeable battery for another 25.
2914000	2919000	I'm like, why? I can either buy Forza Horizon or this controller.
2919000	2921000	I'll just use the 360 controller.
2921000	2923000	I don't need the fucking trigger rumbles.
2923000	2926000	So, I'm just going to hold off on that.
2926000	2929000	But I'll eventually pick up Forza Horizon 3 because it looked pretty cool
2929000	2931000	and I think it should run pretty well on this.
2931000	2934000	Yeah, so, I mean, that's it.
2934000	2935000	Awesome.
2935000	2937000	All right, let's go to JD. How was your gaming week?
2937000	2939000	And, JD, you've been really quiet tonight and I can't fix it on the board,
2939000	2941000	so just make sure that microphone is real close to your mouth.
2941000	2942000	Okay, is this better?
2942000	2943000	Yeah, much.
2943000	2945000	All right. It's been good.
2945000	2947000	My sister came to visit me the past two weeks.
2947000	2951000	So, we've been playing a lot of local multiplayer on Switch.
2951000	2957000	I have Mario Kart, I have Puyo Puyo Tetris, and we played Snipperclips.
2957000	2961000	So, that was the first half of this week.
2961000	2965000	And I've also been playing, you know, Street Pass games on my DS,
2965000	2970000	and Pokemon Shuffle, and Pokemon Go, and a couple other Pokemon games
2970000	2972000	because I'm crazy like that.
2972000	2977000	The arcade we went to was another definite highlight of my gaming week.
2977000	2982000	I played a Groove Coaster, and I saw somebody posted, like,
2982000	2985000	the last time you were there, there was a Crypt of the Necrodancer song,
2985000	2987000	and so I had to play that one.
2987000	2993000	I thought it was a really neat take on the roguelike moving every beat mechanic,
2993000	2994000	because they had this-
2994000	2998000	I believe that song is also in Pers- not Persona,
2998000	3002000	the game that Jamie and Shane are obsessed with.
3002000	3003000	Why can't- the name told us-
3003000	3004000	Danganronpa?
3004000	3006000	Danganronpa. Why do I- why am I thinking Persona?
3006000	3009000	They kind of rhyme. Danganronpa, Persona, kind of.
3009000	3012000	Anyway, that song in Crypt of the Necrodancer is also in Danganronpa
3012000	3014000	because Shane made me film it and tweeted it at Jamie.
3014000	3017000	There were a couple of different songs on the machine that were labeled
3017000	3020000	Crypt of the Necrodancer, and I'm not sure if it's because-
3020000	3023000	I know one of them was definitely from the game itself,
3023000	3025000	and I'm wondering if some of the other was just, like,
3025000	3028000	the music person did, like, a remix of a different game song.
3028000	3033000	I don't know, but the specific one I played from the game, like,
3033000	3035000	there were a lot of notes where it was,
3035000	3038000	move the controller in an arrow direction on the beat,
3038000	3042000	which really mimicked a lot of the way you're playing Crypt of the Necrodancer,
3042000	3044000	where you're moving on the beat.
3044000	3048000	And I thought that was a really neat crossover kind of a thing.
3048000	3053000	I played Neon FM for the first time, which I'd, like, heard a bit about,
3053000	3056000	but it was neat. It reminded me a lot of Poppin',
3056000	3060000	like, five-key Poppin' with, you know, flat pads.
3060000	3062000	But it was a nice change.
3062000	3066000	And yeah, there was a State Mania cabinet,
3066000	3069000	so I got to play, you know, erotic songs that haven't been in arcades in years.
3069000	3071000	So, you know, I filled the bowling alley with
3071000	3074000	Oh Nick, Please Not So Quick and stuff like that.
3074000	3076000	During the kid's birthday party. It's good.
3076000	3079000	Yeah, well, you know, they weren't running around, exactly, mostly.
3079000	3084000	There was also a DDR 2014, which I don't think was a mix that got released in the US.
3084000	3087000	And they had Caramel Dancin', so I had to play that.
3087000	3089000	Curse you for doing so.
3089000	3092000	Yeah, that was about it.
3092000	3094000	Nice. Let's see, my gaming week.
3094000	3098000	So, on a bit of a personal note, I hit affiliate status on my Twitch channel.
3098000	3101000	So, thank you guys very much for supporting, because obviously
3101000	3102000	What does that mean?
3102000	3105000	What does that mean? That means that now I can put that on my resume.
3105000	3107000	Now you get a dollar.
3107000	3109000	Yeah, literally, now I can get a dollar.
3109000	3111000	Now, when I say give me a dollar, you can actually give me a dollar.
3111000	3115000	It makes me eligible for bits, which are the currency on Twitch that
3115000	3118000	So how do you do that? Like, give the podcast for enough time?
3118000	3120000	Oh, to hit the affiliate status?
3120000	3121000	Yeah.
3121000	3123000	There is, I think, four different criteria.
3123000	3125000	You have to have at least 50 followers.
3125000	3127000	So, you know, that's you guys that helped me make that, thank you.
3127000	3132000	You have to have at least three concurrent viewers over all your streams
3132000	3135000	For the past month, for the past 30 days.
3135000	3138000	Which, again, because a lot of my streaming has been after OLR
3138000	3141000	And I've been able to pick up a good, you know, 20 or so people watching
3141000	3143000	Right after OLR, that's been very helpful.
3143000	3146000	So, again, thank you guys. You made that possible.
3146000	3151000	But I know that is the criteria that Flaco Jones, I think he thinks he's
3151000	3154000	Hung up on that right now, because I think in the beginning of the month
3154000	3156000	He didn't have a lot of people watching his stream.
3156000	3158000	He's been picking up, as he's been doing it more regularly
3158000	3160000	And he's thought up some other ideas, I think he's getting more viewers
3160000	3162000	So hopefully he's going to hit it soon, too.
3162000	3165000	But that is the trickiest one for people to hit, I think, is three concurrent.
3165000	3169000	It doesn't sound like a lot, but it can be for a new person starting out
3169000	3171000	Especially when so many people are streaming, right?
3171000	3173000	So what is it, 50 followers, three concurrent?
3173000	3178000	Seven days in the past 30 days that you've done a stream
3178000	3182000	And then 500 minutes in the past 30 days of streaming.
3182000	3185000	Which is about, if you do like an hour and 15 minutes
3185000	3188000	Two or three times a week, you'll hit those criteria.
3188000	3191000	So then it's kind of about just getting the followers and the viewers from there
3191000	3193000	Which, you know, just takes a little time.
3193000	3195000	But yeah, it makes me eligible for the bits, which
3195000	3199000	You can either buy them through Twitch, which a lot of people are doing
3199000	3204000	Or you can watch the ads, you can watch an ad and you get like five bits
3204000	3206000	Or ten bits every time you watch an ad
3206000	3209000	And what you can do is you can cheer a viewer
3209000	3211000	So if somebody decides to cheer my channel
3211000	3213000	Using the bits that they've got, watching ads
3213000	3218000	Then I get one cent for every bit that is cheered at me
3218000	3222000	So I've made, I think, about five dollars so far streaming on Twitch
3222000	3226000	But you know what? Hey, I've been playing video games, having a good time
3226000	3230000	And honestly, I'm not doing it for the money. Let me just be straight
3230000	3235000	I've done this show for 15 years and haven't made a dime off this show
3235000	3240000	Any money that has been made during OLR, like we've gotten some very generous donations over the years
3240000	3243000	But that all has gone right back into the show
3243000	3248000	Buying a mixing board, paying for the VOG stream, paying for mics
3248000	3251000	Whatever it is, all that money has gone back into the show
3251000	3254000	So, where was I going with that?
3254000	3257000	Oh yeah, I don't expect to make money off of streaming
3257000	3261000	But the nice thing about it is that I'm hoping what the affiliate status does
3261000	3264000	Is that maybe it's going to help with a little bit more additional visibility
3264000	3270000	Because what I'm trying to do is get more people exposed to OLR and VOG through streaming
3270000	3273000	It's just like getting yourself out there, is what it is
3273000	3276000	But I've been having fun playing games with people
3276000	3280000	So now you can kind of see some of the games I've been playing throughout the week
3280000	3282000	Because I played Forza Horizon 3 one night
3282000	3286000	I played Diablo 3 again, but I did it on PC
3286000	3289000	So I was doing Seasons this time around
3289000	3291000	And I made my seasonal character
3291000	3294000	I got all the way to I think Chapter 6
3294000	3297000	I think I'm in Chapter 6 now on my seasonal character on Diablo 3
3297000	3299000	So yes, I'm still playing a lot of that
3299000	3302000	Still playing Final Fantasy XIV, eagerly anticipating Stormblood
3302000	3305000	Which is less than a month out now until Early Access
3305000	3307000	So that's really exciting
3307000	3311000	And yeah, that's pretty much everything that I've live streamed
3311000	3314000	There hasn't been a lot that I didn't live stream that I played
3314000	3316000	Except we played some Mario Kart 8 the other night
3316000	3318000	Which I have to vent about a little bit
3318000	3319000	Because you know where I'm going with this
3319000	3321000	So JD brought a Switch over
3321000	3322000	And I was like, cool!
3322000	3324000	We'll be able to do like, oh we can play Mario Kart
3324000	3326000	Like I'll play on the TV
3326000	3327000	And JD can play on the Switch
3327000	3329000	And it's like we're battling each other, right?
3329000	3332000	Okay, so in theory, this should, you know, it's a Nintendo thing
3332000	3334000	It should just work, right?
3334000	3335000	Right
3336000	3340000	Oh my god, like no, we're having connection issues out the wazoo
3340000	3344000	Like we could not, like JD, and to be fair
3344000	3346000	Alan and I were both playing on the TV
3346000	3348000	And then you were playing on your Switch device
3348000	3350000	And we kept getting disconnected
3350000	3353000	Like we couldn't even set, we got to do one race
3353000	3355000	And then it disconnected us right after
3355000	3357000	Or it would disconnect us during the prep
3357000	3358000	Or we would always get disconnected
3358000	3359000	We were like, what the hell is going on?
3359000	3360000	So finally it was just like, fuck it
3360000	3362000	We can do three people on the TV
3362000	3364000	We just ended up doing it that way
3364000	3366000	But then we tried again yesterday
3366000	3368000	But this time we said, okay let's put
3368000	3369000	Because your Switch was already in there
3369000	3371000	Because you were playing Zelda on the TV
3371000	3373000	While I was out doing something else
3373000	3375000	And so I was like, okay I'll play on my Switch
3375000	3377000	And we got through a whole circuit
3377000	3378000	And we got through four races
3378000	3379000	And then got disconnected
3379000	3381000	When we switched to battle, wasn't it?
3381000	3383000	Yeah, yeah, yeah, and then we tried to switch to battle
3383000	3385000	But like, it shouldn't fucking do this
3385000	3388000	Yeah, it's stupid because it doesn't even have anything to do with the internet
3388000	3389000	Yeah
3389000	3391000	Like this is just two Switches in proximity
3391000	3393000	Like street passing or whatever, you know
3393000	3395000	Like it's near field communication
3395000	3396000	And it shouldn't be dropping like that
3396000	3399000	And this really concerns me because this was the feature
3399000	3402000	That like I'm most looking forward to on Switch
3402000	3403000	Right
3403000	3405000	Is being able to do this all in one room like this
3405000	3406000	I am totally shocked
3406000	3408000	Well, not shocked actually
3408000	3410000	You know what we should do is we should try it with Puyo Puyo Tetris
3410000	3412000	And see if it does the same thing
3412000	3414000	See if it's the game or the system
3414000	3416000	Or something else, you know, do some elimination testing
3416000	3418000	Have you all tried this out in the chat
3418000	3420000	Since we do have a live chat room over at live.fognetwork.com
3420000	3422000	Have you guys had some issues trying to do
3422000	3424000	Again, not internet, but in the same room
3424000	3426000	Trying to do some gaming on Switch
3426000	3428000	I've had absolutely no problem with Puyo Puyo Tetris
3428000	3430000	But I have it on PS4
3430000	3432000	Well, what about Mario Kart 8?
3432000	3433000	That's not going to help our situation
3433000	3435000	So anyway, let's see
3435000	3437000	ActDef says I played with friends last night
3437000	3439000	Two on TV and two on a Switch
3439000	3441000	And we didn't have any problems
3441000	3443000	So yeah, it's
3443000	3445000	I don't know what's going on there
3445000	3447000	I feel like it might be something unique to my setup
3447000	3449000	Is it because there's
3449000	3451000	Is it because the Switch is right near all the other electronics
3451000	3453000	Like maybe
3453000	3455000	Maybe my
3455000	3457000	I feel like it shouldn't make a difference
3457000	3459000	Maybe I need to move the dock away from the other electronics
3459000	3461000	You're right, it shouldn't make a difference
3461000	3463000	It shouldn't make a difference
3463000	3465000	I can't think of what else it is
3465000	3467000	Well, for NFR
3467000	3469000	The only things that could cause
3469000	3471000	Any big problem with that would be
3471000	3473000	If it's going through a concrete wall
3473000	3475000	Or the microwave's going
3475000	3477000	You can't tell me
3477000	3479000	The Switch can't do what a DS can do
3479000	3481000	Or the Bluetooth
3481000	3483000	See, I don't want to say this
3483000	3485000	Because I'm going to get judged by some people
3485000	3487000	But y'all can kiss my butt
3487000	3489000	It is sitting on top of my subwoofer
3489000	3491000	Would that be
3491000	3493000	Interference?
3493000	3495000	That might be it
3495000	3497000	That's going to be the first thing we try
3497000	3499000	Maybe we're going to try moving it around
3499000	3501000	Get it off the subwoofer
3501000	3503000	No, it doesn't sit on the subwoofer
3503000	3505000	But it sits right next to it
3505000	3507000	If there's interference
3507000	3509000	I set the games on top of the subwoofer
3509000	3511000	Also, maybe line of sight might be a concern
3511000	3513000	You were sitting on the couch
3513000	3515000	Maybe the recliner would be better
3515000	3517000	I'm just saying if you're holding the console
3517000	3519000	Against it or something
3519000	3521000	Maybe it's the subwoofer
3521000	3523000	Speculation
3523000	3525000	Troubleshooting is so much fun
3525000	3527000	To be fair
3527000	3529000	You guys are probably all rolling your eyes
3529000	3531000	Rob, you're such an idiot
3531000	3533000	It would be nice if Nintendo gave a little more description
3533000	3535000	What is the communication error?
3535000	3537000	Did a particular
3537000	3539000	Switch drop?
3539000	3541000	What's the fucking error?
3541000	3543000	Give me something to help diagnose it a little better
3543000	3545000	There's no error, it's a feature
3545000	3547000	Shut up, alright
3547000	3549000	I had to get that off my chest because that really concerned me
3549000	3551000	But we'll just hope
3551000	3553000	It was my
3553000	3555000	Unique setup here in this household
3555000	3557000	And not something that's going to be
3557000	3559000	Long ongoing
3559000	3561000	Anyway, let's move on
3561000	3563000	And talk about some quick plugs
3563000	3565000	Announcements, of course you can always follow us on Twitter
3565000	3567000	Twitter.com slash O-L-R
3567000	3569000	We're also on Facebook
3569000	3571000	Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio
3571000	3573000	June is going to be a
3573000	3575000	Crazy month here at O-L-R
3575000	3577000	E3 is going to be
3577000	3579000	Taking over our episode on
3579000	3581000	June 11th, no literally
3581000	3583000	It is taking over our episode because
3583000	3585000	Bethesda has their press conference
3585000	3587000	Right in the middle of the show, but as always
3587000	3589000	We're still going to do our thing here at VOG Network
3589000	3591000	We'll start the show
3591000	3593000	Pause it during the Bethesda conference
3593000	3595000	Then pick up right there with some live reaction
3595000	3597000	And all that good stuff
3597000	3599000	And your calls and all that stuff as well
3599000	3601000	The week after that, June 18th
3601000	3603000	We celebrate
3603000	3605000	15 years
3605000	3607000	Of OrangeLoungeRadio
3607000	3609000	15 freaking years
3609000	3611000	Of OrangeLoungeRadio
3611000	3613000	You know I need to look up
3613000	3615000	When OrangeLoungeRadio started
3615000	3617000	On live 365 because we launched the station
3617000	3619000	A month before we launched
3619000	3621000	The show because we were just playing music
3621000	3623000	Like building hype to the first
3623000	3625000	Like live event show that we were doing
3625000	3627000	And I want to say the station started
3627000	3629000	I feel like May 22nd
3629000	3631000	Was the day, I could be wrong
3631000	3633000	But I want to say it was late May
3633000	3635000	So we're, technically
3635000	3637000	OLR is like 15
3637000	3639000	Tomorrow
3639000	3641000	Just not the show
3641000	3643000	You can wear the dress
3643000	3645000	I don't have the dress so I'll just come and drag
3645000	3647000	Alright yeah it's fine, come and drag
3647000	3649000	So June 18th is going to be the big
3649000	3651000	15th year because the first official
3651000	3653000	Episode of OrangeLoungeRadio
3653000	3655000	Is June 23rd, 2002
3655000	3657000	So we're going to celebrate 15 years
3657000	3659000	On June 18th and then on
3659000	3661000	June 25th we will be rewarding
3661000	3663000	Our 15 years of OrangeLoungeRadio
3663000	3665000	By taking a day off
3665000	3667000	I will be in Chicago
3667000	3669000	And my co-host will be
3669000	3671000	Enjoying a day off
3671000	3673000	I will probably be at San Francisco Pride
3673000	3675000	That's right you're doing San Francisco Pride
3675000	3677000	Kind of busy
3677000	3679000	We're spreading pride throughout the world
3679000	3681000	Because I'll be at Chicago Pride
3683000	3685000	Alright cool
3685000	3687000	So no show that day
3687000	3689000	Episode 700 is creeping up on us
3689000	3691000	And I am, that is in the back
3691000	3693000	Of my head
3693000	3695000	Unfortunately due to some personal life stuff
3695000	3697000	Going on I wasn't able, I was supposed
3697000	3699000	To go check out that space
3699000	3701000	That our folks here, Bree and Gabe
3701000	3703000	Were talking about, I was supposed to do that yesterday
3703000	3705000	And I wasn't able to get around to it
3705000	3707000	I'm hoping at some point I'm going to go over there and check it out
3707000	3709000	And we are
3709000	3711000	Exploring options for a place here
3711000	3713000	Locally we can do Episode 700
3713000	3715000	Like as a more
3715000	3717000	Event type show so
3717000	3719000	Please look forward to it
3719000	3721000	Or something around Episode 700
3721000	3723000	It may not be the actual show itself
3723000	3725000	Is it going to be 700 club themed?
3725000	3727000	Fuck no
3727000	3729000	Only if we get to
3729000	3731000	Beat an effigy of what's a fuck
3731000	3733000	Well here's the thing
3733000	3735000	Because of the missed weeks, I have to count out the weeks again
3735000	3737000	But because I think I got sick
3737000	3739000	Episode 700 might be freaking the week that
3739000	3741000	Dragon Con is supposed to be
3741000	3743000	So I have to figure all that timing out
3743000	3745000	And all that good stuff
3745000	3747000	So more to come on that
3747000	3749000	But in the meantime we've still got some gaming news to talk about
3749000	3751000	Let's get into the gaming news for the week
3751000	3753000	Loki
3753000	3755000	So this year we've got a brand new publisher
3755000	3757000	That's going to be doing an E3 presentation
3757000	3759000	And I'm pretty excited
3759000	3761000	To see this because
3761000	3763000	You've got to love them on Twitter
3763000	3765000	But Devolver Digital
3765000	3767000	Is going to be doing their event
3767000	3769000	Called Indie Picnic
3769000	3771000	In the parking lot across from the LA Convention Center
3771000	3773000	South Hall
3773000	3775000	And they said next door to Hooters
3775000	3777000	Jesus
3777000	3779000	I didn't realize there was a Hooters down there
3779000	3781000	That must be new
3781000	3783000	Basically they're saying that
3783000	3785000	They're going to have their own E3 press conference
3785000	3787000	That the
3787000	3789000	Picnic I guess is going to be open
3789000	3791000	Are they just going to stand on the corner and scream it?
3791000	3793000	I don't know
3793000	3795000	They're saying that it's going to be open to
3795000	3797000	All E3 badge holders
3797000	3799000	And the event will be continuing through
3799000	3801000	E3 11 through 7 o'clock
3801000	3803000	Attendees can check out Devolver's
3803000	3805000	Lineup of games and also
3805000	3807000	They'll be where the Indie Megabooth
3807000	3809000	XSplit and Gambitius
3809000	3811000	Take place
3811000	3813000	And yeah so that's pretty
3813000	3815000	Cool that they're going to have their own
3815000	3817000	Indie
3817000	3819000	They haven't announced a time yet for the
3819000	3821000	Press conference but stay tuned for that
3821000	3823000	I'm sure they're going to have to announce it pretty soon
3825000	3827000	Alright well
3827000	3829000	Any games you're hoping to see
3829000	3831000	Out of them?
3831000	3833000	They have such kind of wild
3833000	3835000	Different stuff over there
3835000	3837000	Yeah I just want something wild and cool
3837000	3839000	Honestly I don't remember
3839000	3841000	I don't think they publish super hot
3841000	3843000	I would love to see super hot VR make it to
3843000	3845000	The Playstation VR that's what I would like to see
3845000	3847000	Because the VR one looks pretty awesome
3847000	3849000	For the Vive
3849000	3851000	And the Oculus so I'm kind of curious
3851000	3853000	To see what that would be like on the Playstation
3853000	3855000	Or I just wouldn't really want to play it
3855000	3857000	$800 fucking headset and even the
3857000	3859000	Oculus headset it's like $600
3859000	3861000	That shit needs to come down in price
3861000	3863000	$300
3863000	3865000	That would be perfect
3865000	3867000	Let's see I'm going to our chat over at
3867000	3869000	Live.vognetwork.com Bobby Blackwolf says
3869000	3871000	Devolver Digital has some former gathering
3871000	3873000	Of developers people and they had
3873000	3875000	The God lot before there were
3875000	3877000	Condos across the street from the LA Convention Center
3877000	3879000	It was the same kind of thing except with more
3879000	3881000	Strippers and I'm not kidding they were stripper poles
3881000	3883000	That's awesome
3883000	3885000	I remember the days when it was
3885000	3887000	Was it the Ouya event that was there?
3887000	3889000	What was across the street from the LA Convention Center?
3889000	3891000	Was that Ouya? The one year?
3891000	3893000	They had Ouya
3893000	3895000	No because I gave a shit about
3895000	3897000	Ouya because it was one thing I could get into without a badge
3897000	3899000	I think that was the year I went
3899000	3901000	And I picked up Bobby Blackwolf at E3
3901000	3903000	And then we went to Disneyland
3903000	3905000	Because I didn't actually go to E3 that year
3905000	3907000	But we just went in the lobby in street past
3907000	3909000	I was there for that wasn't I?
3909000	3911000	That was electronica
3912000	3914000	We've done it more than once
3914000	3916000	So there it is
3916000	3918000	Well you're not going to do the Ouya event anymore
3918000	3920000	No we're not
3920000	3922000	Alright moving on let's talk about
3922000	3924000	A rumor about what could be coming to
3924000	3926000	Smartphones you know Nintendo has been doing
3926000	3928000	Their smartphone thing and
3928000	3930000	They what me Tomo
3930000	3932000	JD still plays me Tomo
3932000	3934000	Yeah I lug in everything
3934000	3936000	I was just checking in a moment ago
3936000	3938000	My son plays the shit
3938000	3940000	Out of Super Mario Run
3940000	3942000	Which I think Super Mario Run
3942000	3944000	Was more of a mixed bag of success
3944000	3946000	I think their expectations were just really high for that
3946000	3948000	Wasn't there also a Fire Emblem game?
3948000	3950000	There was I have not
3950000	3952000	Yeah I have not checked that out myself
3952000	3954000	But that's a thing
3954000	3956000	Well the Wall Street Journal is reporting that Nintendo
3956000	3958000	Is going to be bringing the Legend of Zelda
3958000	3960000	Franchise to mobile later this year
3960000	3962000	This will be after
3962000	3964000	Animal Crossing which we already knew
3964000	3966000	Was slated for mobile
3966000	3968000	Clearly they're going to bring the best Zelda
3969000	3971000	Zelda 2 Adventures of Link
3971000	3973000	I like Zelda 2
3973000	3975000	But A playing that on a phone
3975000	3977000	Would be a disaster
3977000	3979000	No that's not the worst of the franchise
3979000	3981000	It would be Zelda Wand of Gamelon
3981000	3983000	There you go that's a better joke
3983000	3985000	Stick to that joke next time
3985000	3987000	Anyway we don't know the game
3987000	3989000	What it is the pricing structure
3989000	3991000	This is all coming from the Wall Street Journal
3991000	3993000	Saying the news is from people
3993000	3995000	Familiar with the matter
3995000	3997000	They've got leaks everywhere
3997000	3999000	That the Wall Street Journal finds
3999000	4001000	Maybe this is something that could come out at E3
4001000	4003000	A little more information about
4003000	4005000	Especially with the popularity of Breath of the Wild
4005000	4007000	This is a good thing to ride the coattails of
4007000	4009000	We will see
4009000	4011000	There will be a pretty huge franchise for Nintendo
4011000	4013000	Although granted they put Mario on the phone
4013000	4015000	You can't go much bigger than that really
4015000	4017000	But Zelda is pretty close
4017000	4019000	Especially with how well Breath of the Wild has been doing
4019000	4021000	Non-stop Link
4021000	4023000	Now well here's the thing
4023000	4025000	I would expect
4025000	4027000	It's not going to be a 2D
4027000	4029000	It's not going to be the original Zelda
4029000	4031000	It's not going to be Zelda Link to the Past
4031000	4033000	Because you can't control that shit on the phone
4033000	4035000	It's going to be horrible controls
4035000	4037000	And I don't think Nintendo is going to sell it
4037000	4039000	I disagree with that you know why?
4039000	4041000	If you played the DS versions
4041000	4043000	The Wind Waker looking ones
4043000	4045000	Those all use touchpad controls
4045000	4047000	I was getting to that because those are different games
4047000	4049000	The Phantom Hourglass
4049000	4051000	Completely different game
4051000	4053000	And that's the type of game that I would expect
4053000	4055000	A Rails shooter
4055000	4057000	But with Zelda
4057000	4059000	No it wasn't a Rails shooter
4059000	4061000	Did you play those games?
4061000	4063000	I mean seriously
4063000	4065000	It's kind of a joke but yes
4065000	4067000	Okay you didn't
4067000	4069000	Obviously not because
4069000	4071000	They controlled really well for touch
4071000	4073000	Which is surprising
4073000	4075000	They didn't really utilize the buttons at all
4075000	4077000	It was basically you hold the screen
4077000	4079000	Where you want Zelda
4079000	4081000	There you go making a new mistake
4082000	4084000	Have you ever watched the show?
4087000	4089000	Take off that mask Jamie
4089000	4091000	I'd like to keep it on
4091000	4093000	You control Link by
4093000	4095000	Basically holding the part of the screen
4095000	4097000	And you can attack by tapping
4097000	4099000	And it worked really well
4099000	4101000	Which is kind of surprising
4101000	4103000	From what I remember they didn't really utilize
4103000	4105000	Buttons too much
4105000	4107000	They could put a couple on screen buttons
4107000	4109000	If you really needed something for that
4109000	4111000	The only thing they could do for the most part
4111000	4113000	Completely touch control and it would be fine
4113000	4115000	Or they could just do a completely new idea
4115000	4117000	And that would be fine too
4117000	4119000	Honestly they you know
4119000	4121000	Or they could just put fucking Pokemon Snap on there
4121000	4123000	Because really that would be fucking amazing
4123000	4125000	With like the AR shit
4125000	4127000	They could do something in the
4127000	4129000	Breath of the Wild world
4129000	4131000	With all of the crazy stuff that you do
4131000	4133000	And they're like you know using the different items
4133000	4135000	It would be like cooking Mama but just cooking Link
4135000	4137000	What about like a dungeon solver type of thing
4137000	4139000	Or the shrines like a shrine solver type of thing
4139000	4141000	That lends itself well to mobile phones
4141000	4143000	I don't know there's different ideas
4143000	4145000	They could do it doesn't necessarily have to be a copy
4145000	4147000	Of something that already exists
4147000	4149000	But this is all really
4149000	4151000	Fan wank right now we just don't know
4151000	4153000	What is really going to happen with Zelda so
4153000	4155000	We'll just have to keep waiting till E3
4155000	4157000	To see if they talk about it then or if they
4157000	4159000	They wait on it
4159000	4161000	It might be actually I would think that this
4161000	4163000	Type of thing may not be in the E3
4163000	4165000	Spotlight or whatever they're calling it
4165000	4167000	It might be something that shows up at Treehouse
4167000	4169000	Cause remember they show
4169000	4171000	Pokemon Go at Treehouse
4171000	4173000	And that was the first time they ever showed
4173000	4175000	Gameplay outside of beta on that
4175000	4177000	And we have this stupid
4177000	4179000	Watch thing that we still
4179000	4181000	Don't sell regularly even though it's been out
4181000	4183000	For almost a year now
4183000	4185000	I still want to cheat with it
4185000	4187000	I wanted to take it apart and solder the fucking
4187000	4189000	Lights to the button
4189000	4191000	So that every time it would light up it would click the button
4191000	4193000	Cause that's what I do
4193000	4195000	I find ways to exploit shit
4195000	4197000	And it would have been satisfying
4197000	4199000	To be able to lord that over them
4199000	4201000	Moving on to another story
4201000	4203000	Dark Sakura if you wouldn't mind
4203000	4205000	Well I have been
4205000	4207000	Looking at this game with some kind
4207000	4209000	Of mixed feelings but it's about
4209000	4211000	Sonic Forces
4211000	4213000	Well you get to customize a character
4213000	4215000	In Sonic Forces
4215000	4217000	You can have different
4217000	4219000	Species of animals
4219000	4221000	With their own different abilities
4221000	4223000	And the things that they carry with them
4223000	4225000	And their own looks
4225000	4227000	Different masks so you basically get to
4227000	4229000	Play dress up in Sonic
4229000	4231000	Which is gonna open the door for
4231000	4233000	A lot of
4233000	4235000	Cosplay
4251000	4253000	There are a lot of furry characters out of this
4253000	4255000	You could
4255000	4257000	I said it nicely by saying
4257000	4259000	If you want to act out your first sona
4259000	4261000	In a Sonic universe you go
4261000	4263000	Right ahead, have fun
4263000	4265000	There's a lot of people who already do that shit
4265000	4267000	So now they just get to say
4267000	4269000	Look I'm canon
4269000	4271000	I'm in the game
4271000	4273000	I'm canon
4273000	4275000	What's the solution
4275000	4277000	To Sonic's shitty friends?
4277000	4279000	Let's make an infinite amount of Sonic's shitty friends
4279000	4281000	Make it now it's you
4281000	4283000	Now you're the bad friend
4283000	4285000	I don't know if I hate the shitty friends
4285000	4287000	Because I'm the shitty friend
4287000	4289000	I'm so torn
4289000	4291000	Everybody's gonna make their own shitty friend
4291000	4293000	And then they're gonna post their shitty pictures
4293000	4295000	To social media
4295000	4297000	Through the Switches
4297000	4299000	Twitch and Facebook
4299000	4301000	Look I'm in a Sonic game
4301000	4303000	Sonic's butt
4303000	4305000	Can you put your me's in there?
4305000	4307000	Can we have Hitler Sonic's friend?
4307000	4309000	No no no
4309000	4311000	That's terra bad
4311000	4313000	Yeah they need to have limitations
4313000	4315000	On what you can do
4315000	4317000	Because otherwise
4317000	4319000	There's people that have done me's
4319000	4321000	That are just cocking balls
4321000	4323000	There's people that have done me's
4323000	4325000	That are Christmas and New Years
4325000	4327000	It's all right there
4327000	4329000	It's just gonna be a thing now isn't it
4329000	4331000	Yes
4331000	4333000	I can't wait for December
4333000	4335000	Moving on
4335000	4337000	You don't want to see Hanukkah
4337000	4339000	All right
4339000	4341000	That lasts for weeks
4341000	4343000	Moving on
4343000	4345000	Loki
4345000	4347000	All right
4347000	4349000	Ubisoft has made some announcements
4349000	4351000	Prior to E3
4351000	4353000	Some things we're gonna be seeing more of
4353000	4355000	During their press conference
4355000	4357000	Far Cry 5
4357000	4359000	And The Crew 2
4359000	4361000	Are gonna be
4361000	4363000	Coming soon
4363000	4365000	And apparently maybe a new Assassin's Creed
4365000	4367000	Cause I think that they took the year off
4367000	4369000	So now we'll see something like that
4369000	4371000	Remember I think we had the rumor that it was
4371000	4373000	Opel World or something
4373000	4375000	So I guess we'll see what's gonna happen
4375000	4377000	But apparently yeah those three
4377000	4379000	Are due to be released
4379000	4381000	This fiscal year
4381000	4383000	That's pretty cool that The Crew
4383000	4385000	Is getting a sequel after all
4385000	4387000	Cause I didn't think the first game did that well
4387000	4389000	Cause it was like bargain basement
4389000	4391000	Pretty cheap to play
4391000	4393000	Pretty fast
4393000	4395000	So I didn't think that lent well
4395000	4397000	I'm not dogging the game
4397000	4399000	To be fair
4399000	4401000	I think a lot of people I knew that did
4401000	4403000	Spend time with the game enjoyed it
4403000	4405000	So I'm not saying it was a bad game
4405000	4407000	Or unworthy of a sequel
4407000	4409000	I was surprised with how fast they slashed the price
4409000	4411000	That it's doing well enough to
4411000	4413000	Necessitate a sequel
4413000	4415000	Hopefully
4415000	4417000	Maybe they'll do
4417000	4419000	What they need to do to make it
4419000	4421000	So that more people want to drop 50-60 bucks on it right away
4421000	4423000	Dungeon Buster in Chat says
4423000	4425000	I hope they fix the rubber banding
4425000	4427000	And magnetic tires in The Crew
4427000	4429000	The game was kind of fun but wow
4429000	4431000	Issues
4431000	4433000	We just like never ever do rubber banding ever again
4433000	4435000	No one likes it
4435000	4437000	Who actually likes rubber banding?
4437000	4439000	Nobody
4439000	4441000	Just like get rid of it
4441000	4443000	It's a cop out
4443000	4445000	For programming better driving AI
4446000	4448000	Make it something you can enable and disable
4448000	4450000	I don't know
4450000	4452000	Tigerclaw in Chat says every racing game has rubber banding
4452000	4454000	Like it or not
4454000	4456000	I don't like it
4456000	4458000	Yeah that's right I choose not to like it
4458000	4460000	So I started a podcast about it
4460000	4462000	Something I like though
4462000	4464000	That I like talking about on the podcast
4464000	4466000	Is Overwatch
4466000	4468000	And Overwatch believe it or not is turning a year old
4468000	4470000	It feels like that game is a lot older
4470000	4472000	But I think it seems so cemented
4472000	4474000	In gaming now
4475000	4477000	Overwatch is coming up
4477000	4479000	With their game of the year edition
4479000	4481000	On Tuesday May 23
4481000	4483000	Is when that game of the year edition comes out
4483000	4485000	It's going to be coming with
4485000	4487000	10 bonus loot boxes
4487000	4489000	Some new hero skins
4489000	4491000	Blackwatch Reyes
4491000	4493000	And Strike Commander Morrison skins
4493000	4495000	You can also get some of the stuff that I think
4495000	4497000	Was in the original Overwatch
4497000	4499000	Origins edition like the Ferris skin
4499000	4501000	And some of that other stuff
4501000	4503000	That is going to be available on PlayStation 4
4503000	4505000	Xbox One and PC
4505000	4507000	But they're also going to be running an anniversary event
4507000	4509000	In the game
4509000	4511000	They haven't really said much more about what are the skins going to look like
4511000	4513000	There are some voices that showed up
4513000	4515000	But that's all we know
4515000	4517000	So we don't really know exactly
4517000	4519000	What all the extra stuff is going to be with that yet
4519000	4521000	But yeah very cool
4521000	4523000	That that game is
4523000	4525000	Still doing strongly
4525000	4527000	After a year
4527000	4529000	I'm kind of curious how they're going to keep the momentum
4529000	4531000	Going a few years from now
4531000	4533000	So far they're doing really well
4533000	4535000	And hell I'm still playing Diablo 3
4535000	4537000	And that game's
4537000	4539000	That was like 2008, 2009 at this point
4539000	4541000	Getting to be an older game
4541000	4543000	No I don't think it's that old
4543000	4545000	But still it's several years old at this point
4545000	4547000	We get a Diablo 4 pretty soon?
4547000	4549000	I wish
4549000	4551000	Maybe that's one of the under construction things
4551000	4553000	Or you think we'll see more
4553000	4555000	Character classes or something
4555000	4557000	For Overwatch?
4557000	4559000	Diablo
4559000	4561000	So they already announced that
4561000	4563000	So that
4563000	4565000	I still feel like it's going to be a couple years
4565000	4567000	Before we even see Diablo 4
4567000	4569000	But I don't know
4569000	4571000	Anyway
4571000	4573000	Let's see, ActDeftInChat says it was Game of the Year
4573000	4575000	In 2016
4575000	4577000	I don't think I mentioned it in that story
4577000	4579000	But I know it's part of this too
4579000	4581000	They are doing a free play weekend
4581000	4583000	Over Memorial Day weekend of all times too
4583000	4585000	So if you've never played Overwatch
4585000	4587000	You have a chance
4587000	4589000	This is the first time I think they've done the free play on PC
4589000	4591000	I know they've done it on console a couple times
4591000	4593000	But I think this is the first time they're doing it on PC
4593000	4595000	I've never played it
4595000	4597000	Yeah, no, I'm excited to have you check it out
4597000	4599000	See what you think
4599000	4601000	And I'm going to use controller like a complete noob
4601000	4603000	Because I don't have a place to put my computer
4603000	4605000	Where I can actually use a mouse
4605000	4607000	Nor do I have a mouse
4607000	4609000	Ooh, that's going to be rough, but good luck
4609000	4611000	Fuck that, I'm fucking awesome with controller
4611000	4613000	I think they did do free play on a PC a while back
4613000	4615000	Because that was when Ryan tried it
4615000	4617000	Maybe they did, I just don't remember it
4617000	4619000	It was definitely a while ago, like six months or something
4619000	4621000	Yeah, and I bought the game straight away
4621000	4623000	So I wouldn't have been paying attention to that
4623000	4625000	Let's see, SSQ100Matt saying
4625000	4627000	I remember a chatter in here saying that
4627000	4629000	Overwatch wasn't going to stick around
4629000	4631000	Because Blizzard can't do shooters
4631000	4633000	I wonder how that worked out
4633000	4635000	Well, I think the reason why Overwatch is kind of working is because
4635000	4637000	It's more than just a shooter
4637000	4639000	They do have characters in there that you can play
4639000	4641000	If you're not much of a shot
4641000	4643000	A character like Symmetra
4643000	4645000	Is really about where you place the turrets
4645000	4647000	And you don't even really have to be able to aim
4647000	4649000	To attack with Symmetra's gun
4649000	4651000	And that makes her a very attractive player
4651000	4653000	For some people
4653000	4655000	A healer like Mercy
4655000	4657000	You don't really have to be able to aim
4657000	4659000	You support other characters
4659000	4661000	Lucio is all about an aura
4661000	4663000	You know, it's a healing aura or a boost aura
4663000	4665000	So you don't necessarily have to be a good shot
4665000	4667000	And I think that's what has made it very, very, very
4667000	4669000	Attractive for a lot of people
4669000	4671000	But if you want to play, I mean
4671000	4673000	You have a Widowmaker who's a sniper
4673000	4675000	And Soldier 76 is just basically
4675000	4677000	Your Call of Duty character
4677000	4679000	So they have that stuff in there too
4679000	4681000	If that's what you're into
4681000	4683000	Alright, and
4683000	4685000	Yeah, SSG100Matt says
4685000	4687000	They find new ways to reinvent the game all the time
4687000	4689000	And Act F even suggests
4689000	4691000	For Loki, start with Soldier 76
4691000	4693000	Because that will be the most familiar
4693000	4695000	Probably from
4695000	4697000	Other shooting games
4697000	4699000	Alright, we will move on
4699000	4701000	Just a few more stories for you guys
4701000	4703000	Before we get to the classic game of the week
4703000	4705000	But first, Dark Sakura
4705000	4707000	This is something I've been
4707000	4709000	Considering contributing to
4709000	4711000	Ever since I found out
4711000	4713000	But Project Rap Rabbit
4713000	4715000	Is set for PC and PS4
4715000	4717000	And it has a
4717000	4719000	Kickstarter on it
4719000	4723000	With a 1.1 million dollar goal
4723000	4725000	I see them making it
4725000	4727000	No problem
4727000	4729000	But there's
4729000	4731000	Actually quite a few tiers on there
4731000	4733000	And several of them seem actually fairly affordable
4733000	4735000	One of the digital tiers
4735000	4737000	Is like maybe 30 bucks
4737000	4739000	For the game
4739000	4741000	And then
4741000	4743000	For like 70, there's one that has
4743000	4745000	Art books and stuff with it
4745000	4747000	I wouldn't mind having the art book for it
4747000	4749000	Although Dan says I have 50 million art books
4749000	4751000	For games I haven't played
4751000	4753000	So, but
4753000	4755000	Good, what's one more?
4755000	4757000	But at any rate
4757000	4759000	Basically, Rap Rabbit
4759000	4761000	Is actually taking inspiration
4761000	4763000	From what it's been
4763000	4765000	Commented on like epic rap battles
4765000	4767000	Of history
4767000	4769000	Where it's a
4769000	4771000	Rapping dialogue
4771000	4773000	Not like necessarily a battle
4773000	4775000	But a dialogue
4775000	4777000	And you've got like different verses
4777000	4779000	That you can throw in and not just doing whatever
4779000	4781000	They're already in the song
4781000	4783000	So, it definitely
4783000	4785000	It definitely looks cool and definitely is something
4785000	4787000	That I think is going to be getting
4787000	4789000	Money from you on Kickstarter
4789000	4791000	So I see some people
4791000	4793000	In chat talking about the Switch version
4793000	4795000	Of this, so here's the thing that happened
4795000	4797000	To that, so when it was originally on
4797000	4799000	Kickstarter, they posted all of their stretch goals
4799000	4801000	And like the last stretch
4801000	4803000	Goal on there was like a 5.5 million
4803000	4805000	Stretch goal and it would say Switch version
4805000	4807000	And the Nintendo fanboys
4807000	4809000	Screamed basically, which I
4809000	4811000	Kinda get, I mean that was a real
4811000	4813000	That was a lot of money to do a Switch version
4813000	4815000	So they've actually changed it and if you go back
4815000	4817000	To the Kickstarter today, Switch is now
4817000	4819000	The first stretch goal with 1.5
4819000	4821000	Million to get the Switch version
4821000	4823000	Which, you know, the game
4823000	4825000	Would definitely be attractive I think if it was on
4825000	4827000	The Switch, but
4827000	4829000	Well, and a little bit more about
4829000	4831000	The character is that the main character is called
4831000	4833000	Totomaru, who is basically
4833000	4835000	A farm boy rabbit and wants
4835000	4837000	To battle the forces of corruption
4837000	4839000	And his sidekick is named
4839000	4841000	Totomaru
4841000	4843000	I'm in a really difficult place
4843000	4845000	With this thing, I love these
4845000	4847000	Companies, I love these, like you know
4847000	4849000	Nana On'Sha, like I love these
4849000	4851000	Companies, there's so much talent going into
4851000	4853000	This, that being said, I'm kinda
4853000	4855000	Done backing
4855000	4857000	Big studio Kickstarters
4857000	4859000	I realize these studios aren't big
4859000	4861000	But like
4861000	4863000	I'm not interested in buying
4863000	4865000	The game today that's not gonna come out for 4 years
4865000	4867000	And I know they say, oh we have
4867000	4869000	A path to get it out
4869000	4871000	Sure you do, buddy
4871000	4873000	They all do
4873000	4875000	Now, indies, and we've talked a lot about
4875000	4877000	Indie Kickstarters on this show, I feel a lot
4877000	4879000	Differently about, okay
4879000	4881000	But something of this caliber, especially for these
4881000	4883000	Guys that have done Playstation games before
4883000	4885000	And so forth, like, I'm just kind of
4885000	4887000	Shocked they can't get a publisher
4887000	4889000	To sign on to this
4889000	4891000	Like, I don't know, like
4891000	4893000	Where's your guys' heads at with this?
4893000	4895000	Like, Jamie, you said you were thinking about contributing to it
4895000	4897000	So you must be a little more forgiving
4897000	4899000	I'd rather that they raise the money
4899000	4901000	Themselves this way and go independently
4901000	4903000	For a publisher
4903000	4905000	Just because I've seen publishers fuck stuff up
4905000	4907000	You know what, I know what it is
4907000	4909000	I know what bothered me about it
4909000	4911000	It actually did have to do with the Nintendo thing
4911000	4913000	I thought it was weird
4913000	4915000	That the game was a Playstation 4
4915000	4917000	And a PC exclusive
4917000	4919000	Because my head went to
4919000	4921000	If it's a Playstation 4 exclusive
4921000	4923000	Sony should be paying for it
4923000	4925000	Not me
4925000	4927000	Now, I realize the Switch thing
4927000	4929000	Has changed a little bit
4929000	4931000	So I don't feel that as much anymore
4931000	4933000	But definitely when I first loaded the page
4933000	4935000	That was a huge misfire on their part
4935000	4937000	To be like, we'll do Nintendo Switch if we get 5 million dollars
4937000	4939000	Because I'm kind of like, if you're going to stay
4939000	4941000	Exclusive to one platform, then that platform
4941000	4943000	Should be fronting the money for it
4943000	4945000	And where the hell is Xbox One?
4945000	4947000	I kind of get, it's Japanese developed
4947000	4949000	So that question's
4949000	4951000	Kind of, eh, I get it
4951000	4953000	Probably is never
4953000	4955000	Yeah, I know, I know
4955000	4957000	It could also be based off what dev kits they have
4957000	4959000	Maybe they have a Playstation 4 dev kit
4959000	4961000	That could be, that could be
4961000	4963000	But I just, I still couldn't help but feel a little bit of like
4963000	4965000	Why am I paying for something that is going to be exclusive to one system
4965000	4967000	You know, and all this stuff
4967000	4969000	And I just
4969000	4971000	I don't know, I just
4971000	4973000	I feel like there's
4973000	4975000	Kickstarters I've contributed to
4975000	4977000	A long time ago
4977000	4979000	Bloodstained, Ritual of the Night
4979000	4981000	Which is a good example
4981000	4983000	Still not out
4983000	4985000	And I'm sure the game's going to be fine
4985000	4987000	And it's, you know, all that stuff
4987000	4989000	But it's like
4989000	4991000	I'm not interested in making this 4 year long investment
4991000	4993000	I'm sorry, I know some people strongly disagree with me
4993000	4995000	But I kind of just
4995000	4997000	Don't want to give my money away like that
4997000	4999000	I want something a little more immediate
4999000	5001000	I think
5001000	5003000	Bobby Blackwolf says
5003000	5005000	They will still have a publisher
5005000	5007000	1.1 million isn't enough to make the game
5007000	5009000	They still have other investors
5009000	5011000	And they say
5011000	5013000	He says
5013000	5015000	So
5015000	5017000	We have gone to Great Lakes and are planning an early work to minimize this risk
5017000	5019000	Between the shared experience of developers
5019000	5021000	Nanno and Shaw and Innes
5021000	5023000	And publisher Pcube's platform holder relationships
5023000	5025000	And merchandise production know-how
5025000	5027000	We're confident that all the pieces are in place to ship
5027000	5029000	Project Rap Rabbit along with all
5029000	5031000	Physical backer awards by August 2018
5031000	5033000	I
5033000	5035000	Even with all that
5035000	5037000	In front of me, I just, I don't
5037000	5039000	I don't believe it
5039000	5041000	And honestly
5041000	5043000	And it sucks, but you can
5043000	5045000	Kind of blame Mighty No. 9 for a lot of it
5045000	5047000	A lot of it
5047000	5049000	Mighty No. 9 done
5049000	5051000	Fucked up Kickstarter
5051000	5053000	Is it making you cry like an anime
5053000	5055000	Fan on prom night?
5055000	5057000	Yes
5057000	5059000	But again
5059000	5061000	When it comes to indies
5061000	5063000	I feel a lot differently
5063000	5065000	I get it
5065000	5067000	The ones that have been on here that are like
5067000	5069000	I need that artist or I need that
5069000	5071000	Or my game is fucking done
5071000	5073000	I need the money to do the distribution
5073000	5075000	And all that stuff
5075000	5077000	I'm kind of like, okay, well you've never done a game before
5077000	5079000	You've clearly been working on something
5079000	5081000	I feel a lot differently with the smaller people
5081000	5083000	Maybe that's just my whole
5083000	5085000	Yay indie type of nature anyway
5085000	5087000	But these other
5087000	5089000	These other things I have a harder time with
5089000	5091000	I don't know
5091000	5093000	Matt says
5105000	5107000	So I don't know
5107000	5109000	I couldn't help but feel a little burned
5109000	5111000	When I saw that it was a Kickstarter
5111000	5113000	Because I was thinking, oh it's going to be a big
5113000	5115000	E3 announcement
5115000	5117000	Yes, I realize Kickstarter
5117000	5119000	Are E3 announcements now
5119000	5121000	Ever since Shenmue 3
5121000	5123000	But
5123000	5125000	When they were talking this whole thing
5125000	5127000	What was the little tagline
5127000	5129000	Make music games great again and all this stuff
5129000	5131000	I was like, oh
5131000	5133000	Music games are already great
5133000	5135000	A, I was like please don't say that
5135000	5137000	B, like
5137000	5139000	With a line like that I would have thought your game
5139000	5141000	Was ready to go
5141000	5143000	Well then again
5143000	5145000	With a line like that maybe they're channeling
5145000	5147000	The one that said it originally
5147000	5149000	I wouldn't go that far
5149000	5151000	I get it, especially when you're an indie
5151000	5153000	Developer, you want to get the hype
5153000	5155000	And the community built up around your product
5155000	5157000	Early
5157000	5159000	But I just get annoyed, it's like
5159000	5161000	We have this really kick ass product that's not
5161000	5163000	Going to be out for two years
5163000	5165000	Why didn't you just
5165000	5167000	Show me this one that's more ready
5167000	5169000	Did they have video of what it looks like
5169000	5171000	Or is it just all concept shit right now
5171000	5173000	Screenshots
5173000	5175000	I don't think they actually
5175000	5177000	Do they have the game running on that kickstarter
5177000	5179000	I didn't look that far
5179000	5181000	When I looked at it I looked at it on my mobile
5181000	5183000	And I couldn't actually play videos
5183000	5185000	I think
5185000	5187000	I know they had screenshots, they had a lot of that stuff
5187000	5189000	But I don't know if they actually have the game
5189000	5191000	The actual product up there
5191000	5193000	I don't want to go on record saying they don't
5193000	5195000	That makes me wary
5195000	5197000	That early
5197000	5199000	Bobby says it's all concept, it's all whiteboard
5199000	5201000	Yeah I know
5201000	5203000	I'll play it when it comes out
5203000	5205000	I will be, you know what if the game is good
5205000	5207000	I will be the first one
5207000	5209000	To plop down the money for it the day it comes out
5209000	5211000	Good luck
5211000	5213000	Well if you think about it
5213000	5215000	What is really the advantage here
5215000	5217000	I mean what
5217000	5219000	It's just
5219000	5221000	You get some extra crap
5221000	5223000	I mean why should I risk
5223000	5225000	Myself, I mean as it is
5225000	5227000	Games that come out day one from AAA
5227000	5229000	Are risky investments as it is
5229000	5231000	Considering how broken some of them could be
5231000	5233000	At launch, why am I going to put
5233000	5235000	Risk in the game that may never even
5235000	5237000	Come out
5237000	5239000	It doesn't make any sense that you want my money
5239000	5241000	I mean I know that you need to fund it
5241000	5243000	And stuff but
5243000	5245000	Then again you don't need the funding
5245000	5247000	It's almost like we got to show that these
5247000	5249000	Publishers that people are interested in this game
5249000	5251000	That's a publishers job to figure that shit out
5251000	5253000	Why do they have to show interest in it
5253000	5255000	Alright
5255000	5257000	I'm glad somebody in chat got my joke
5257000	5259000	By the way, come on confide in me
5259000	5261000	Says my name is Sky and I've got something to say
5261000	5263000	That's right
5263000	5265000	I got your joke Rob
5265000	5267000	My name is Rob Roberts and I got something to say
5267000	5269000	That part
5269000	5271000	Amplitude done fucked up kickstarter
5273000	5275000	Cause there's another game
5275000	5277000	That I'm sorry, it was not as good
5277000	5279000	As we all hoped it was going to be
5279000	5281000	I'm sorry, straight up
5281000	5283000	Anyway
5283000	5285000	Let's move on
5285000	5287000	We got more stories for you, Loki
5287000	5289000	Alright
5289000	5291000	So Netflix
5291000	5293000	Has a lot of interesting shows
5293000	5295000	They just showed this week
5295000	5297000	Was a new
5297000	5299000	Dark Crystal series
5299000	5301000	Which looks pretty cool
5301000	5303000	Something else that's also in the pipeline
5303000	5305000	That's a little bit more game related
5305000	5307000	And seems
5307000	5309000	Proper for Netflix
5309000	5311000	They're going to be a new series
5311000	5313000	Based on The Witcher
5313000	5315000	The fantasy series of course
5315000	5317000	It is a book series as well as
5317000	5319000	The game series but they're saying that they're
5319000	5321000	Going to be having
5321000	5323000	I guess they have the executive producers
5323000	5325000	Sean Daniel and Jason Brown
5325000	5327000	Who are known for a show
5327000	5329000	Called The Expanse which I have never
5329000	5331000	Seen nor heard of
5331000	5333000	They're going to be following I guess
5333000	5335000	Sounds like the books
5335000	5337000	So it'll be interesting
5338000	5340000	I don't know if you guys have all seen the pictures on Twitter
5340000	5342000	But it's very clear that Julian Assange
5342000	5344000	Is going for the lead role in this
5344000	5346000	From his latest look
5346000	5348000	I don't know if you all have seen that
5348000	5350000	Such an awful bullet
5350000	5352000	So
5352000	5354000	The Witcher has some sexy
5354000	5356000	Stuff in there
5356000	5358000	There's going to be so many boobs in this show
5358000	5360000	It's not a Witcher game
5360000	5362000	Unless
5362000	5364000	Sign me up because
5364000	5366000	We need some Game of Thrones replacements
5366000	5368000	You can have that
5368000	5370000	As long as this time
5370000	5372000	When he stands up in the tub
5372000	5374000	I don't want no suds
5374000	5376000	So
5376000	5378000	Anyway
5378000	5380000	So yeah
5380000	5382000	William Murderface in chat says
5382000	5384000	Witcher hype
5384000	5386000	The direction
5386000	5388000	And the way the stories
5388000	5390000	Are told in The Witcher and all that
5390000	5392000	Is really really well done
5392000	5394000	If they bring some of that to a television show
5394000	5396000	Like seriously
5396000	5398000	It does have the ability to be something
5398000	5400000	On a Game of Thrones-esque kind of level
5400000	5402000	It really does
5402000	5404000	I think the source material for The Witcher
5404000	5406000	Which I understand is also based off a novel series
5406000	5408000	So there's all that
5408000	5410000	That we have to consider as well
5410000	5412000	But I think it could
5412000	5414000	Do really well in a way that video game
5414000	5416000	Media hasn't really been done before
5416000	5418000	Although
5418000	5420000	Is it really video game media if it was all a book to begin with
5420000	5422000	But remember we have Castlevania coming too
5423000	5425000	We'll keep our fingers crossed
5425000	5427000	Can we get boobs in that too?
5427000	5429000	Why not?
5429000	5431000	Well look at the original artwork
5431000	5433000	For Symphony of the Night
5433000	5435000	That's right
5435000	5437000	Granted the Dark Crystal is going to be a little awkward
5437000	5439000	But I mean it's necessary
5439000	5441000	In order to keep a certain level of quality
5441000	5443000	Across all Netflix shows
5446000	5448000	Alright one more story for you guys
5448000	5450000	Before we get to the classic game of the week
5450000	5452000	This one's a very modern game actually
5452000	5454000	I know a lot of people were really hyped for the
5454000	5456000	Destiny 2 event
5456000	5458000	That they had earlier this week
5458000	5460000	Where they showed some footage of the game
5460000	5462000	And shown off all the features coming to Destiny 2
5462000	5464000	Destiny 2 of course
5464000	5466000	Is going to be coming out for the PC
5466000	5468000	As well as the Playstation 4 and the Xbox One
5468000	5470000	No longer on Playstation 3 or Xbox 360
5470000	5472000	Although that doesn't surprise anybody
5472000	5474000	But it will be coming out on the consoles
5474000	5476000	What was it? Early September
5476000	5478000	I think was the date on the console right?
5478000	5480000	For Playstation 4 and Xbox One
5480000	5482000	There is no release date for PC yet
5482000	5484000	It will not be out
5484000	5486000	It sounds like the exact same day as September 8th
5486000	5488000	But here's what is really interesting
5488000	5490000	About the PC version of
5490000	5492000	Destiny 2
5492000	5494000	It's better than both the other versions
5494000	5496000	Well that's one
5496000	5498000	That's an opinion
5498000	5500000	But the other thing that's also interesting
5500000	5502000	Is that it's going to be released on Battle.net
5502000	5504000	Dun dun dun
5504000	5506000	Wait a minute
5506000	5508000	Blizzard's thing? Yes
5508000	5510000	But remember who owns Blizzard?
5510000	5512000	Activision
5512000	5514000	It's Activision Blizzard
5514000	5516000	What does Activision like? Greed
5516000	5518000	That's right
5518000	5520000	So no more 30% cut from the Steam store
5520000	5522000	By releasing that thing on Battle.net
5522000	5524000	And also you guys
5524000	5526000	And this is something I don't see
5526000	5528000	Any of the press really getting into
5528000	5530000	That I think is a huge element
5530000	5532000	Of this and why they're going
5532000	5534000	To the Battle.net launcher for all this
5534000	5536000	Sure the fact that they'll get to keep the cut
5536000	5538000	Of all the digital sales and all that
5538000	5540000	That's a great perk I'm sure
5540000	5542000	You guys
5542000	5544000	I think sometimes severely
5544000	5546000	Underestimate the Blizzard fandom
5546000	5548000	And
5548000	5550000	Don't underestimate the dark side
5550000	5552000	Don't underestimate the fucking Blizzard fandom
5552000	5554000	Don't
5554000	5556000	Because they're fucking crazy
5556000	5558000	And I say that as a Blizzard fan
5558000	5560000	I do I do I love Blizzard fans
5560000	5562000	I had a great time at Blizzcon
5562000	5564000	They're nuts and I mean that in a good way
5564000	5566000	Because why do I say it that way?
5566000	5568000	Why do you think something like Overwatch was
5568000	5570000	As successful as it was? Because
5570000	5572000	It got people that were playing
5572000	5574000	World of Warcraft
5574000	5576000	That were playing Diablo
5576000	5578000	To say hey here's a shooter
5578000	5580000	From this same company that I love
5580000	5582000	That's coming out and I want to try this
5582000	5584000	Or this team based game objective game
5584000	5586000	Or whatever you don't want to call it a shooter
5586000	5588000	And I want to try this out
5588000	5590000	One game I didn't talk about during my gaming week
5590000	5592000	That I actually have been playing quite a bit of
5592000	5594000	Is Heroes of the Storm
5594000	5596000	Why have I been playing Heroes of the Storm? By Blizzard
5596000	5598000	Because I want the fucking
5598000	5600000	Loot boxes for Overwatch
5600000	5602000	That you get by playing a bunch of
5602000	5604000	Matches with friends that's really what it boils
5604000	5606000	Down to so Blizzard
5606000	5608000	Very very very very very good
5608000	5610000	At doing the synergy thing and here
5610000	5612000	Come try our free game to get stuff
5612000	5614000	In the other game and all this stuff now not that I'm saying
5614000	5616000	That Destiny 2 is necessarily going to be a part of that
5616000	5618000	Although this
5618000	5620000	Certainly does open the door for Destiny
5620000	5622000	Characters to start showing up in Heroes of the Storm
5622000	5624000	Just saying
5624000	5626000	Or Overwatch
5626000	5628000	Well Overwatch is kind of
5628000	5630000	It's own universe you don't exactly see the lost Vikings
5630000	5632000	Running around in Overwatch
5632000	5634000	But Heroes of the Storm is kind of that mixing
5634000	5636000	Pot for all the Blizzard things
5636000	5638000	I'm just saying it opens the door to it I'm not saying it's going to happen
5638000	5640000	It just opens the door to it
5640000	5642000	But also
5642000	5644000	And this is another huge thing too is that
5644000	5646000	If you're playing World
5646000	5648000	Of Warcraft which a lot of people
5648000	5650000	Still are some people are
5650000	5652000	Selling their Warcraft gold
5652000	5654000	For real money through
5654000	5656000	This Blizzard token
5656000	5658000	So they have this Blizzard balance
5658000	5660000	That they're building up which most people
5660000	5662000	Are using to therefore buy
5662000	5664000	Overwatch loot boxes
5664000	5666000	But now they could save
5666000	5668000	That money and buy
5668000	5670000	Copies of Destiny 2 because that's going to be
5670000	5672000	Through Battle.net and you know what after they
5672000	5674000	Announce this that Destiny 2 is going to be
5674000	5676000	A part of Battle.net the prices
5676000	5678000	In gold of those WoW tokens went through the
5678000	5680000	Fucking roof because
5680000	5682000	You've got a ton of players now
5682000	5684000	Who are trying to save up money in their
5684000	5686000	Battle.net balance so they can basically
5686000	5688000	Buy Destiny 2
5688000	5690000	And Blizzard's still making money because
5690000	5692000	Somebody's buying those WoW tokens to
5692000	5694000	You know then that money is getting basically
5694000	5696000	Reallocated to purchasing
5696000	5698000	Destiny 2 so
5698000	5700000	Dungeon Buster
5700000	5702000	In chat says Destiny normally doesn't do any
5702000	5704000	Cross-promotion well it's
5704000	5706000	It's a crazy world out there
5706000	5708000	It's a different game and this is going to be very very
5708000	5710000	Very interesting for
5710000	5712000	PC also some other things
5712000	5714000	That should be mentioned about PC there's like the
5714000	5716000	Full on 4K on PC right
5716000	5718000	I didn't see a lot of the oh here it is on
5718000	5720000	PC Destiny will support 4K
5720000	5722000	That's 3820 by 2160
5722000	5724000	Un-capped frame rate
5724000	5726000	Custom key mapping text chat
5726000	5728000	And now that it's on Battle.net
5728000	5730000	If I'm playing Destiny 2
5730000	5732000	I can send
5732000	5734000	Dark Sakura a message through
5734000	5736000	Battle.net while she's playing World of Warcraft
5736000	5738000	And I can send her a message and I can say like
5738000	5740000	It's a lip sync Jamie
5740000	5742000	What part of that don't you understand
5742000	5744000	I'd like to keep it on please
5744000	5746000	And then there's an adjustable
5746000	5748000	FOV field of view detailed
5748000	5750000	PC setting screen 21 by 9
5750000	5752000	Monitor support and so on
5752000	5754000	So I mean all this just basically
5754000	5756000	Cemented for me oh yeah I'm
5756000	5758000	Skipping consoles and I'll be buying this on
5758000	5760000	PC like I
5760000	5762000	Kind of fell off the Destiny wagon because
5762000	5764000	Expansion expansion
5764000	5766000	Expansion but I'm willing to
5766000	5768000	Give it another go at Destiny 2 because
5768000	5770000	Destiny 2 at least is going to hit the reset button on all
5770000	5772000	That because you know none of that stuff carries
5772000	5774000	Over so I
5774000	5776000	I want to try it with mouse and keyboard on PC
5776000	5778000	I never played the first one I have it I just never played it
5778000	5780000	Yeah
5780000	5782000	Tigerclaw does point out and say
5782000	5784000	You'll need a good graphics card if you
5784000	5786000	Want to play in 4K yes yes you will
5786000	5788000	Need a good graphics card if you want to play in 4K I actually
5788000	5790000	Don't even have a 4K monitor so that's not gonna
5790000	5792000	Do me a lick of good but maybe I'll
5792000	5794000	Buy one for Christmas or
5794000	5796000	Something when
5796000	5798000	I don't know if it's worth it for
5798000	5800000	4K price
5800000	5802000	Stick with feeling what you got
5802000	5804000	Oh Bobby has no shame
5804000	5806000	At all saying that in the battle net system
5806000	5808000	I could send Jamie a message while she's playing
5808000	5810000	Wow I'm playing a game by
5810000	5812000	Bungie it's immediate predecessor is
5812000	5814000	A very classic game we should feature it
5814000	5816000	If only you could see
5816000	5818000	If only you could see
5818000	5820000	If only you could see
5820000	5822000	She's got one finger flying right now
5822000	5824000	For you Bobby
5824000	5826000	I'm saluting ya
5826000	5828000	Well let's see what she did pick for the classic game of the week this week
5828000	5830000	Every week Dark Soccer
5830000	5832000	Jumps into the gaming vault and finds a game
5832000	5834000	That she thinks hey
5834000	5836000	Put down your destiny
5836000	5838000	Sign out of battle net and play this
5838000	5840000	Cause this game's not on battle net and it's awesome
5840000	5842000	Alright
5842000	5844000	Dark Soccer what is the classic game of the week?
5844000	5846000	This is a game
5846000	5848000	I spent a shitload of time playing
5848000	5850000	In the arcade like a lot
5850000	5852000	I was kinda hooked on this game
5852000	5854000	We already did Dance Dance Revolution
5854000	5856000	Girl
5856000	5858000	APB
5858000	5860000	All Points Bulletin came out in 1987
5860000	5862000	By Atari
5862000	5864000	Atari games at the time
5864000	5866000	Where you play Officer Bob not the drag queen
5866000	5868000	Who is
5868000	5870000	A rookie police officer
5870000	5872000	And you have to go through
5872000	5874000	Different parts of the game
5874000	5876000	One of them is you go through
5876000	5878000	And you pull people over
5878000	5880000	For minor infractions
5880000	5882000	Well you ticket people for minor infractions
5882000	5884000	With the whole targeting system
5884000	5886000	Or you can pull over
5886000	5888000	Bad offenders and then eventually
5888000	5890000	You get down to where you apprehend criminals
5890000	5892000	When they put out an APB
5892000	5894000	The cabinet
5894000	5896000	Is a neat little cabinet
5896000	5898000	It looks kinda like a police car
5898000	5900000	Where it's got the siren
5900000	5902000	Lights above on top
5902000	5904000	Has a gas pedal, a steering wheel
5904000	5906000	And
5906000	5908000	Even a little seat
5908000	5910000	I think some of them had a seat
5910000	5912000	I remember playing one that didn't have it
5912000	5914000	It really is just a
5914000	5916000	Cartoony little game
5916000	5918000	But it's not easy
5918000	5920000	It is not an easy game
5920000	5922000	In fact even the developers
5922000	5924000	Said that over the development cycle
5924000	5926000	The gameplay got a lot more complicated
5926000	5928000	Than they originally had planned
5928000	5930000	It did have some other
5930000	5932000	Home releases
5932000	5934000	But let's get a little bit more into the game itself
5934000	5936000	Which I think is funny because you play as Car 54
5936000	5938000	Do you remember that show
5938000	5940000	Where Are You?
5940000	5942000	Exactly, that had, what's his face
5942000	5944000	The Playroom in Munster?
5944000	5946000	Uh, yes
5946000	5948000	I don't remember his name
5948000	5950000	I'll have to look it up again
5950000	5952000	He was one of the officers in that show
5952000	5954000	I mean, and I might
5954000	5956000	But it wasn't around when Car 54
5956000	5958000	Where Are You was on TV
5958000	5960000	But it did come on Nick at Night
5960000	5962000	Not that old bitches
5962000	5964000	Nick at Night used to run all those shows
5964000	5966000	When we were kids
5966000	5968000	Dennis the Menace from the 50's
5968000	5970000	Was like prime time on Nickelodeon
5970000	5972000	When they thought to make kids cute they had to scream
5972000	5974000	Hey Mr. Woman
5974000	5976000	Pull over buddy
5976000	5978000	So on top of this
5978000	5980000	This is also like every old stereotype
5980000	5982000	You get bonuses for
5982000	5984000	Every day where you arrest over the quota
5984000	5986000	And you can pick up donuts
5986000	5988000	That extend your time limit
5988000	5990000	For the day
5990000	5992000	I know donuts extend my time limit for the day
5992000	5994000	Donuts expand
5994000	5996000	My ability to even
5996000	5998000	They expand my waistline
5998000	6000000	Right?
6000000	6002000	Anyway you can also drive through filling stations
6002000	6004000	To refuel your patrol car
6004000	6006000	You can also
6006000	6008000	Upgrade your patrol car with brakes, guns
6008000	6010000	Armor, radar
6010000	6012000	I just keep thinking of this police car
6012000	6014000	Turning into something from Road Warrior
6014000	6016000	So you start off
6016000	6018000	By ticketing for common
6018000	6020000	Misdemeanors like littering
6020000	6022000	You pull up behind them
6022000	6024000	Tell them to bend over
6024000	6026000	Then you press the siren button
6026000	6028000	And then have them pull over
6028000	6030000	Sometimes you have to kind of
6030000	6032000	Over and over
6032000	6034000	Speeding
6034000	6036000	Comes into the game later
6036000	6038000	And you also
6038000	6040000	You also have to rescue different
6040000	6042000	Not rescue but arrest different
6042000	6044000	Fugitives
6044000	6046000	And then you have to violently shake them
6046000	6048000	To get a confession out of them
6048000	6050000	Before the chief enters the room and you have a
6050000	6052000	Confessometer
6052000	6054000	Unless it's a baby, don't shake the baby
6054000	6056000	God Rob
6056000	6058000	Now I'm all sad because I see that little baby's face
6058000	6060000	Aww
6060000	6062000	Anyway
6062000	6064000	So anyway
6064000	6066000	Your life gauge is kind of like a demerit meter
6066000	6068000	Um
6068000	6070000	So if you hit that
6070000	6072000	Then you get too many demerits
6072000	6074000	You are fired
6074000	6076000	So you can get fired in the game
6076000	6078000	And you earn those by colliding with cones
6078000	6080000	Or other vehicles when your siren is off
6080000	6082000	Shooting
6082000	6084000	Non offender vehicles
6084000	6086000	Running into donut huts and pedestrians
6086000	6088000	Running out of gas
6088000	6090000	And failing to get a confession
6090000	6092000	You can also
6092000	6094000	Get demerits when your car explodes
6094000	6096000	Or when you get hit by a train
6096000	6098000	Or high speed collisions
6098000	6100000	You know just all kinds of shit
6100000	6102000	So basically you have to be perfect
6102000	6104000	Um
6104000	6106000	Now um the seat that I was talking about
6106000	6108000	By the way it looks like it was detachable
6108000	6110000	And I remembered because the first version I played
6110000	6112000	Didn't have the seat on it
6112000	6114000	Um APB had a really long
6114000	6116000	Development process though like I mentioned earlier
6116000	6118000	And so as it went on
6118000	6120000	They added so many
6120000	6122000	Things to it that it really became
6122000	6124000	Complicated much more so than they had envisioned
6124000	6126000	Um it was
6126000	6128000	Pretty well received
6128000	6130000	For the time it had great high resolution graphics
6130000	6132000	The cabinet design was fairly new
6132000	6134000	Especially with having the flashing lights
6134000	6136000	On top it really made it attractive
6136000	6138000	Um and
6138000	6140000	It's difficulty was something
6140000	6142000	That kept people going in to try to
6142000	6144000	Master it you know
6144000	6146000	So um
6146000	6148000	There were home versions
6148000	6150000	Mostly developed by Tengen
6150000	6152000	Um there was
6152000	6154000	A version on GameCube
6154000	6156000	Actually I'm getting way ahead of the
6156000	6158000	Original releases
6158000	6160000	The original home versions
6160000	6162000	Were Amiga, Atari
6162000	6164000	ST, Commodore 64
6164000	6166000	ZX Spectrum in 1989
6166000	6168000	And then there was an Atari Lynx version
6168000	6170000	That came out in 1991 which I think
6170000	6172000	I have it I'll have to ask
6172000	6174000	Um for the later versions we had
6174000	6176000	A GameCube version, PS2 and Xbox
6176000	6178000	As part of Midway Arcade Treasures 2
6178000	6180000	And a PC as Midway
6180000	6182000	Arcade Treasures Deluxe Edition
6182000	6184000	And later on was part of the Midway
6184000	6186000	Arcade Origins in 2012
6186000	6188000	And there you go APB
6188000	6190000	That's the game
6190000	6192000	I have to admit I've only played the
6192000	6194000	Slightest bit of this I think it was in one of those
6194000	6196000	Like Midway collection things cause you know
6196000	6198000	They have all the old Atari games in those too like the
6198000	6200000	This is totally the same hardware
6200000	6202000	It's like 720 in some of those other games
6202000	6204000	Yeah the same era
6204000	6206000	I think this is in one of those so I've only played like the
6206000	6208000	Lightest bit of it but yeah I remember it being freaking hard
6208000	6210000	It is but it's super
6210000	6212000	Fun and I mean just the
6212000	6214000	Cabinet itself you know
6214000	6216000	When we got one
6216000	6218000	At my Aladdin's castle
6218000	6220000	That shows you how
6220000	6222000	Long ago it was when I first
6222000	6224000	Saw this one which I ended up eventually
6224000	6226000	Working at when I was in college so
6226000	6228000	Um but
6228000	6230000	There amongst the carpeted walls and
6230000	6232000	Everything was this shiny new game
6232000	6234000	And I really enjoyed it yes it had
6234000	6236000	Carpeted walls
6236000	6238000	The arcade nice had carpeted
6238000	6240000	Walls like you sound sound proving
6240000	6242000	Yeah
6242000	6244000	But true story carpeted walls at roller rink
6244000	6246000	I tore up my jeans and my knee
6246000	6248000	Rolling going at high
6248000	6250000	Speed into one of those walls so I had
6250000	6252000	Bad memories of carpeted walls
6252000	6254000	Alright there it is your classic
6254000	6256000	Game of the week APB
6256000	6258000	Alright a good
6258000	6260000	Good from a real much
6260000	6262000	Better era of Atari than some of
6262000	6264000	Our more recent memories although those
6264000	6266000	Flashback consoles are still pretty sweet for what it's worth
6266000	6268000	Anyway we're going to take a quick break but we have
6268000	6270000	Plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come

6310000	6312000	Hulu thing the Amazon thing there's a lot of
6312000	6314000	Ways to do that so I just have to figure out which ones gonna work
6314000	6316000	For me and be watching that pretty
6316000	6318000	Soon I'm really excited about that as I'm sure

6328000	6330000	My wife quit in season 2 as well
6330000	6332000	So I don't know
6332000	6334000	I need to finish Sense8 season 2
6334000	6336000	As well I started it and I liked
6336000	6338000	Well the Christmas episode was just basically
6338000	6340000	The Christmas episode was practically like the
6340000	6342000	VR thing we were talking about earlier
6342000	6344000	With Christmas and New Years and it really
6344000	6346000	Was the Christmas episode
6346000	6348000	But I watched the first episode
6348000	6350000	As well and it was good I liked it
6350000	6352000	I liked the way it ended so I need to watch more
6352000	6354000	Sense8 and even Shane is you know
6354000	6356000	Bugging me about it he's like I'm gonna ruin it for you if you don't
6356000	6358000	Finish it Crazy Ex-Girlfriend
6358000	6360000	Is worth a watch yes absolutely
6360000	6362000	I don't know that one so it's hilarious
6362000	6364000	It's well written and they got musical
6364000	6366000	Numbers in every show I mean it's
6366000	6368000	Very it's seriously very well written
6368000	6370000	The pilot episode has a song called the Sexy Getting
6370000	6372000	Ready song okay
6372000	6374000	Sounds good oh some folks in chat
6374000	6376000	Suggesting the MST3K reboot
6376000	6378000	Yeah
6378000	6380000	Honestly though I've been kind of spoiled
6380000	6382000	With Rift Tracks
6382000	6384000	It's kind of hard to go back
6384000	6386000	To that but
6386000	6388000	I'll have to give it another try
6388000	6390000	I watched the first episode of the Bill Nye
6390000	6392000	Science show
6392000	6394000	It was okay
6394000	6396000	I hear he's a bit preachy though
6396000	6398000	It's a little bit but I hope
6398000	6400000	They give him another season
6400000	6402000	I think it maybe just needs a little time to work out some of the kinks
6402000	6404000	So I hope they give him another season
6404000	6406000	But I liked it
6406000	6408000	I just didn't love it
6408000	6410000	A lot of Netflix shows I'm like oh my god
6410000	6412000	These are so good
6412000	6414000	It's not Netflix but it's Hulu
6414000	6416000	Everybody is telling me fucking watch it
6416000	6418000	Everybody is like fucking watch it
6418000	6420000	But just be ready to just want to
6420000	6422000	Cry for hours and hours
6422000	6424000	After you watch the first couple episodes
6424000	6426000	I guess there's like it's too real
6426000	6428000	Have you read the book?
6428000	6430000	No of course not
6430000	6432000	I don't read a lot of books
6432000	6434000	Books?
6434000	6436000	Well it came out like 30 years ago
6436000	6438000	So it's not new
6438000	6440000	I had actually started it when I was in
6440000	6442000	Middle school
6442000	6444000	And had to put it down
6444000	6446000	I haven't picked it up since
6446000	6448000	I planned on going back
6448000	6450000	I could read the Divine Comedy
6450000	6452000	In middle school
6452000	6454000	But yet that book hit me hard
6454000	6456000	So I had to put it down
6456000	6458000	I'm going to try to pick it back up and finish it
6459000	6461000	For a book that was written in the 80s
6461000	6463000	About current events and future predictions
6463000	6465000	It's held up extremely well
6465000	6467000	And terrifyingly so
6467000	6469000	What was the other thing I was going to mention?
6469000	6471000	Taking it with all these
6471000	6473000	On demand things
6473000	6475000	Let me go to chat I guess since I can't remember what it is
6475000	6477000	Brad from Pod Culture says
6477000	6479000	Gotham is okay
6479000	6481000	I watched half the first season of that
6481000	6483000	Okay is a good word to describe it
6483000	6485000	Not watching any of the DC shit until Wonder Woman comes out
6485000	6487000	I'm hearing the movie is getting good reviews
6487000	6489000	Out the gate
6489000	6491000	That's good
6491000	6493000	But I also hear that it's the only good thing
6493000	6495000	In their cinematic universe
6495000	6497000	Well
6497000	6499000	Unless we count the Nolan Batman movies
6499000	6501000	Because I thought those were great
6501000	6503000	I liked all of them
6503000	6505000	Not even just the Heath Ledger one
6505000	6507000	I liked them all
6507000	6509000	Didn't they reboot that universe away though?
6509000	6511000	Like they do every couple of years
6511000	6513000	That was the Christian Bale one
6513000	6515000	They were going to do a Batman with Batfleck
6515000	6517000	But I don't know if that's actually happening or not
6519000	6521000	Maybe?
6521000	6523000	And Brad from Pod Culture does have a good point
6523000	6525000	He says DC television is way better than the DC movies
6525000	6527000	That also requires a time commitment
6527000	6529000	That I would be taking away from
6529000	6531000	At least
6531000	6533000	I would be taking away from finishing Luke Cage and Iron Fist
6533000	6535000	And Daredevil before Defenders comes out
6535000	6537000	That's my problem TV
6537000	6539000	TV is such a huge time
6539000	6541000	Because I only give a shit about things that involve Jessica Jones
6541000	6543000	I've heard that it's safe to skip Iron Fist
6543000	6545000	And you're not missing anything
6545000	6547000	I
6547000	6549000	I've always liked Iron Fist and I read a good
6549000	6551000	Bit of Iron Fist and Power Man
6551000	6553000	In like the early 80's
6553000	6555000	What I want to see
6555000	6557000	Is a Misty Knight and Colin Wing series
6557000	6559000	I want to see Daughters of the Dragon
6559000	6561000	That would make me
6561000	6563000	So happy
6563000	6565000	So make it happen
6565000	6567000	I remember what I was going to say about Hulu
6567000	6569000	So I tried watching a show on Hulu
6569000	6571000	Well Hulu does have the Golden Girls
6571000	6573000	So we're thankful for Hulu for that
6573000	6575000	But I tried watching a show that
6575000	6577000	Shane or somebody thought I would like called Difficult People
6577000	6579000	And I thought it was so
6579000	6581000	Like I really tried to
6581000	6583000	I watched a good like 7 or 8 episodes of it
6583000	6585000	And I'm like this show is just not funny
6585000	6587000	Like people
6587000	6589000	It bothers me in shows
6589000	6591000	When people don't
6591000	6593000	Talk right
6593000	6595000	That was the problem in Difficult People
6595000	6597000	Was that they would talk about something
6597000	6599000	And then it was like oh here's this completely
6599000	6601000	Like side reference to a pop culture event
6601000	6603000	That maybe 2% of America
6603000	6605000	Is familiar with type of thing
6605000	6607000	That's not talking to me
6607000	6609000	Which I understand kind of why
6609000	6611000	That type of show exists in that format
6611000	6613000	It's like Family Guy in real life almost
6613000	6615000	It's kind of like
6615000	6617000	Oh so it's not bad funny the way that Seinfeld wasn't funny
6617000	6619000	Yeah no no
6619000	6621000	But then the other show
6621000	6623000	This is the one that gets me
6623000	6625000	And I swear I'll get back to video games
6625000	6627000	But TV is important too
6627000	6629000	Gilmore Girls is the other show I can't fucking watch
6629000	6631000	Because of that I tried watching Gilmore Girls
6631000	6633000	And people love Gilmore Girls
6633000	6635000	And I tried watching it and I'm like
6635000	6637000	People don't fucking talk like that
6637000	6639000	It is driving me up a fucking wall
6639000	6641000	The way they talk on the show
6641000	6643000	Anyway sorry Jamie I had to get that off my chest
6643000	6645000	Well you said Golden Girls
6645000	6647000	Did you see Golden Girls Clue?
6647000	6649000	Oh of course
6649000	6651000	Like 2 people posted it to your wall
6651000	6653000	Thank you for noticing yes 2 people posted it to my wall
6653000	6655000	Which is I never
6655000	6657000	Get mad and I never go and say
6657000	6659000	Somebody else beat you to it because I go
6659000	6661000	I'm touched that people
6661000	6663000	Think of me when they think of the Golden Girls
6663000	6665000	The only thing I have to say about Golden Girls Clue is
6665000	6667000	Could they not
6667000	6669000	Afford Estelle Getty's license
6669000	6671000	Or likeness like what the fuck is up with that box art
6671000	6673000	Like she doesn't
6673000	6675000	Look right at all
6675000	6677000	Who did Blanche do?
6677000	6679000	In which room?
6679000	6681000	In which room and with what
6681000	6683000	Prophylactics
6683000	6685000	Come on confide in me and chat says
6685000	6687000	Binge the British version of Queer as Folk
6687000	6689000	Oh years ago
6689000	6691000	I saw it years ago
6691000	6693000	I love all the Doctor Who references in that show
6693000	6695000	Yes actually yeah
6695000	6697000	Like when he's at the pub and his co-workers like
6697000	6699000	Ex-dominate
6699000	6701000	I think I watched that around the time that the
6701000	6703000	Eccleston Doctor Who episodes are coming out
6703000	6705000	And somebody told me that it was the same director
6705000	6707000	And I was like after watching the British
6707000	6709000	Queer as Folk I was like oh that's fucking obvious
6709000	6711000	This guy is a total boner for Doctor Who
6711000	6713000	What's his fuck
6713000	6715000	Wrestle T Davies
6715000	6717000	And then there was the American Queer as Folk
6717000	6719000	Which was
6719000	6721000	How many
6721000	6723000	Good British shows get ruined when they're Americanized
6723000	6725000	It was a thing that we had
6725000	6727000	In the olden days ten years ago
6727000	6729000	For representation
6729000	6731000	And boy we've come a long way
6731000	6733000	Let's just leave it at that
6735000	6737000	I would say
6737000	6739000	For British shows coming to America
6739000	6741000	The Office wasn't bad
6741000	6743000	But I love the British Office
6743000	6745000	The Ma Na Ma Na scene
6745000	6747000	Like cracked me up so fucking hard
6747000	6749000	On the British Office like in just ways
6749000	6751000	That TV here never makes me laugh that hard
6751000	6753000	You know what else got fucked up? Being human
6755000	6757000	I watched the shit out of that
6757000	6759000	Out of the British version
6759000	6761000	And then we got the US one and I tried to
6761000	6763000	Watch the first episode and I was like no I can't
6763000	6765000	But did you know that the first episode
6765000	6767000	Of the Office in the US and the first episode of the
6767000	6769000	Office in the UK are the same like script
6769000	6771000	Like they might have done some
6771000	6773000	Cuts because the commercials is different over there
6773000	6775000	But like
6775000	6777000	It's like the same script and I was like wow
6777000	6779000	It's so different though
6779000	6781000	But I think a lot of that is just the strength of
6781000	6783000	Ricky Gervais
6783000	6785000	Versus you know
6785000	6787000	Why can't I think Steve Carell
6787000	6789000	You know and just kind of like how they are
6789000	6791000	Yeah that guy
6791000	6793000	Alright we got to move on y'all
6793000	6795000	Let's get back into some gaming news
6795000	6797000	We're going to do some rapid fire news
6797000	6799000	Yes so this is kind of an interesting experiment
6799000	6801000	But you know
6801000	6803000	Goes to show you can watch almost anything on Twitch
6803000	6805000	So they have
6805000	6807000	This cool
6807000	6809000	Neural network
6809000	6811000	Named Charles and what Charles does
6811000	6813000	Is it's learning how to
6813000	6815000	Drive I guess self driving
6815000	6817000	Cars almost in Grand Theft Auto
6817000	6819000	5 so basically
6819000	6821000	It's basing all the data off
6821000	6823000	Of what it sees
6823000	6825000	In the actual screenshots
6825000	6827000	And everything to make its decision
6827000	6829000	So you can actually watch it drive
6829000	6831000	And
6831000	6833000	Or drive poorly because that's
6833000	6835000	Kind of what happens sometimes but
6835000	6837000	It's pretty interesting so that's one thing
6837000	6839000	You can check out on
6839000	6841000	Twitch
6841000	6843000	And then of course you know
6843000	6845000	The user you'd want to look for
6845000	6847000	Is Sentdex
6847000	6849000	Is the guy that's hosting that so check that out
6849000	6851000	Because it's kind of interesting
6851000	6853000	I watched a few minutes of that and I was entertained
6853000	6855000	And then
6855000	6857000	Finally we're going to get
6857000	6859000	A release date for South Park
6859000	6861000	The Fractured But Whole
6861000	6863000	That's going to be coming out in October
6863000	6865000	So October 17th
6865000	6867000	Is when it's going to be coming out
6867000	6869000	And with that they have
6869000	6871000	Released a new trailer which I
6871000	6873000	Do need to watch and I do want to pick up the game
6873000	6875000	Because the first one was awesome
6875000	6877000	Do we think it will actually
6877000	6879000	Come out? I think this time
6879000	6881000	I think it's ready
6881000	6883000	I hope so too
6883000	6885000	And I know a lot of people are looking forward to that game
6885000	6887000	And really I'm one of them I think it's going to be a good game
6887000	6889000	By the way I have to answer this
6889000	6891000	In chat because it's important
6891000	6893000	Ragenator in chat says
6893000	6895000	Speaking of Twitch I've heard that every episode of
6895000	6897000	Mr. Rogers Neighborhood is coming to Twitch
6897000	6899000	You're late to the party Ragenator
6899000	6901000	It's been going on for a few days now actually
6901000	6903000	We were watching
6903000	6905000	The other night and I think we were in the
6905000	6907000	Episodes from 1969 so it was in color
6907000	6909000	They're probably in the early 70's by now
6909000	6911000	But I mean that marathon
6911000	6913000	Is going to be going on a while because Mr. Rogers
6913000	6915000	That show didn't end until
6915000	6917000	2001
6917000	6919000	It was like 30 years worth of television
6919000	6921000	It was a long time so they got a lot of episodes to go
6921000	6923000	However I got to say
6923000	6925000	Yes I've been watching some Mr. Rogers on Twitch
6925000	6927000	And again chat
6927000	6929000	Fucking makes it
6929000	6931000	Kudos to the chatters who
6931000	6933000	Make that an experience
6933000	6935000	So are there any awesome memes coming out of this?
6935000	6937000	No not really the same thing but it's like
6937000	6939000	The type of stuff like when
6939000	6941000	There was one episode he was doing
6941000	6943000	He was doing like a seesaw
6943000	6945000	He was weighing the fruit or something
6945000	6947000	And when it balanced
6947000	6949000	People were like Vak, Vak
6949000	6951000	He's cheating and all this stuff
6951000	6953000	Science, OMG
6953000	6955000	The little emotes and all that
6955000	6957000	People are really funny
6957000	6959000	There's of course some of the
6959000	6961000	Stupid shit that you would expect too
6961000	6963000	Whenever Lady Abberline
6963000	6965000	What's the real life lady
6965000	6967000	That plays, not Lady Elaine
6967000	6969000	The funky nose one
6969000	6971000	Lady Abberline is her name or something
6971000	6973000	Aberdeen?
6973000	6975000	The one who's like
6975000	6977000	Like his niece or something
6977000	6979000	Yeah, yeah
6979000	6981000	Maybe in chat, chat probably
6981000	6983000	Knows it too, when she shows up
6983000	6985000	Some toilet comments show up in chat
6985000	6987000	But it's not like, it doesn't cross the line
6987000	6989000	Like it's just like, you kind of
6989000	6991000	Chalk it up to the whole like
6991000	6993000	Lady Abberline
6993000	6995000	Oh it's pervy dude
6995000	6997000	At home or whatever
6997000	6999000	Who is named Betty Abberline
6999000	7001000	Everything is like their names
7001000	7003000	It's funny because obviously I haven't
7003000	7005000	Watched Mr. Rogers neighborhood in a very
7005000	7007000	Fucking long time right
7007000	7009000	But like many of you
7009000	7011000	I watched it every fucking day
7011000	7013000	When I was like 5 or 6 years old
7013000	7015000	Picture picture is my fucking jam
7015000	7017000	So all that stuff
7017000	7019000	It's kind of fascinating to go back now
7019000	7021000	And it's like
7021000	7023000	The characters really talk like that
7023000	7025000	Meow, meow, meow, meow, hello
7025000	7027000	Meow, meow, meow, meow
7027000	7029000	Adventure, meow, meow, meow
7029000	7031000	I was like, how did that not drive me up a
7031000	7033000	Fucking wall, but
7033000	7035000	Isn't that how your cat talks?
7035000	7037000	No, my cat
7037000	7039000	Is meow, meow, meow, feed me
7039000	7041000	I was like, mom
7041000	7043000	Mom
7043000	7045000	Alright
7045000	7047000	Anyhow, sorry for the tangent
7048000	7050000	We're back on TV
7050000	7052000	That one's worthwhile cause they're raising
7052000	7054000	Money for PBS I think at the end of the day
7054000	7056000	I gotta say
7056000	7058000	A fucking smart way to do it
7058000	7060000	In this day and age
7060000	7062000	You guys probably all remember back in the day
7062000	7063000	When you would watch Mr. Rogers
7063000	7065000	Then you'd have the telethon comes on
7065000	7067000	If you send us $50
7067000	7069000	You'll get a free t-shirt or a free book
7069000	7071000	Or a free VHS tape
7071000	7073000	Of a night at the opera or something
7073000	7075000	They would always have those telethons
7075000	7077000	Like somebody at PBS
7077000	7079000	And probably because of Bob Ross
7079000	7081000	Okay, let's not
7081000	7083000	It's because of Bob Ross
7083000	7085000	Changed the fucking game at Twitch
7085000	7087000	I'm sure now
7087000	7089000	PBS was like, wait a minute
7089000	7091000	We wanna do a fundraiser or something over there
7091000	7093000	We get like 321 contact or something like that
7093000	7095000	Fuck, Square One television
7095000	7097000	Square One still hasn't been released
7097000	7099000	On DVD
7099000	7101000	They need to do something about that
7101000	7103000	Can you imagine MathNet
7103000	7105000	I'm gonna stay up
7105000	7107000	For 72 hours straight when that happens
7107000	7109000	I'll watch MathNet
7109000	7111000	Didn't they release MathNet as a separate program
7111000	7113000	At some point
7113000	7115000	Like Friday
7115000	7117000	Okay, here we go on TV again
7117000	7119000	Friday would always be
7119000	7121000	The extended
7121000	7123000	MathNet episode
7123000	7125000	There was only a couple
7125000	7127000	Maybe they would have a MathMan
7127000	7129000	In the very beginning
7129000	7131000	The rest of the episode was MathNet
7132000	7134000	Another really cool thing that PBS did
7134000	7136000	To raise money was on YouTube
7136000	7138000	They remixed certain themes like a year or two ago
7138000	7140000	And those are
7140000	7142000	Oh yeah, some of those are
7142000	7144000	On the music feed
7144000	7146000	They're amazing
7146000	7148000	And Mr. Rogers has one too
7148000	7150000	Mr. Rogers has one, I think Reading Rainbow has one
7150000	7152000	And I think Julia Child has one
7152000	7154000	Julia Child, love it
7154000	7156000	Anyway, back to video games
7156000	7158000	But the worlds are coming
7158000	7160000	As Twitch is airing this stuff
7160000	7162000	It's like our video game and TV worlds
7162000	7164000	Are blending together
7164000	7166000	Anyway, how would you like to buy a video game box
7166000	7168000	For five dollars
7168000	7170000	Yes, you can buy a video game box for five dollars
7170000	7172000	It is the Nintendo Switch
7172000	7174000	Splatoon 2 bundle
7174000	7176000	Excuse me, hiccups
7176000	7178000	If you can't afford the bundle
7178000	7180000	Or perhaps you already own all the stuff
7180000	7182000	Inside it
7182000	7184000	But you just want to have a box
7184000	7186000	For your collection
7186000	7188000	You can buy one for 540 yen in Japan
7188000	7190000	And I should stress
7190000	7192000	This is on the My Nintendo Store in Japan
7192000	7194000	It's not something they're doing here in the US
7194000	7196000	There is no Switch inside
7196000	7198000	No manuals, no boxes, no cords
7198000	7200000	It's just the box
7200000	7202000	The main box
7202000	7204000	No little boxes inside of games or anything
7204000	7206000	So you could also buy this to prank somebody
7206000	7208000	Set it up for really
7208000	7210000	Pranky eBay auctions
7210000	7212000	Oh yeah, yeah
7212000	7214000	Or I'm going to get Loki a gift
7214000	7216000	On a future episode of OLR
7216000	7218000	That's completely empty
7218000	7220000	It's going to be a Splatoon 2 box
7220000	7222000	And inside will just be a note that says
7222000	7224000	I put all of your positive things
7224000	7226000	About Nintendo inside this box
7226000	7228000	And it's empty
7228000	7230000	Those cartridges are so light that you wouldn't be able to tell if you lifted it up
7230000	7232000	It's true
7232000	7234000	The switches are pretty light as it is
7234000	7236000	A lot of those boxes have instructions on the inside
7236000	7238000	Have you looked inside the boxes?
7238000	7240000	Oh yeah, the boxes, that's what they do now
7240000	7242000	They do a one sheet print on the back
7242000	7244000	And that's it
7244000	7246000	But anyway
7246000	7248000	Keep in mind, this box is the system box
7248000	7250000	So it's not
7250000	7252000	No, it's not the game box
7252000	7254000	Alright, anyhow
7254000	7256000	One other thing to mention about
7256000	7258000	Speaking about Nintendo and so forth
7258000	7260000	It's a Mario Kart 8 patch that came out
7260000	7262000	You may have noticed that 1.1 version of Mario Kart 8 came out
7262000	7264000	And it adjusted the time zone issue
7264000	7266000	That we bitched about with the tournament thing last week
7266000	7268000	So to be fair
7268000	7270000	Nintendo fixed that, yay
7270000	7272000	However, they also changed Inkling Girl's animation
7272000	7274000	Apparently
7274000	7276000	She was giving an animation
7276000	7278000	I never really noticed this in her old animation
7278000	7280000	But she was giving the Up Yours animation
7280000	7282000	Which like
7282000	7284000	Here is not super offensive
7284000	7286000	Unless there's a finger coming out of it, right?
7286000	7288000	But I suppose overseas
7288000	7290000	In parts of Europe and so forth
7290000	7292000	Yeah exactly, what she just did there
7292000	7294000	That is a little more
7294000	7296000	Hold your bicep and pump through your fist
7296000	7298000	That's an insult
7298000	7300000	It's the same as the middle finger basically
7300000	7302000	Except if you're in
7302000	7304000	Parts of Europe, namely England
7304000	7306000	The two fingers
7306000	7308000	Where they see the back of your hand
7308000	7310000	That's right
7310000	7312000	So in America your IQ is one
7312000	7314000	In Britain your IQ is two
7314000	7316000	That's how it works
7316000	7318000	It's like one punch versus two punches
7318000	7320000	That's how many licks you're gonna get
7320000	7322000	Alright, so
7322000	7324000	There it is
7324000	7326000	Again, if you want to know why that animation changed
7326000	7328000	That's because in another country
7328000	7330000	It is not polite
7330000	7332000	DarkSakura, what do you have for us before we get to release dates?
7332000	7334000	Some stuff
7334000	7336000	Actually one of the Switch games I've been mildly interested in
7336000	7338000	Has been Arms
7338000	7340000	Which would be why I'd want to get
7340000	7342000	A Switch I think
7342000	7344000	But they are getting a global
7344000	7346000	Test punch event
7346000	7348000	It's actually available right now
7348000	7350000	Apparently on the eShop
7350000	7352000	So if you want to see if you like it
7352000	7354000	Test it!
7354000	7356000	Punch it in the face!
7356000	7358000	Arms
7358000	7360000	Ok that sucked
7360000	7362000	So also in other news
7362000	7364000	We have the E3
7364000	7366000	2001 livestream plans
7366000	7368000	For Sony
7368000	7370000	Monday June 12th
7370000	7372000	Is gonna be at
7372000	7374000	5pm Tuesday June 13th
7374000	7376000	From 12pm to 6pm
7376000	7378000	Live programming
7378000	7380000	Wednesday June 14th from 12 to 6
7380000	7382000	And Thursday June 15th from 12 to 4
7382000	7384000	So you'd be able to watch it all
7385000	7387000	There are quests to unlock
7387000	7389000	Rewards and
7389000	7391000	Different trailers
7391000	7393000	To watch and the whole thing will also
7393000	7395000	Be streamed on YouTube and Twitch
7395000	7397000	Well good luck to my buddy
7397000	7399000	Who I'm sure is going to be a part of this
7399000	7401000	Who used to listen to OLR years and years ago
7401000	7403000	And now does that stuff with Sony
7403000	7405000	Yay!
7405000	7407000	I'm sure he'll be in that
7407000	7409000	That's what a lot of the companies are doing now
7409000	7411000	When you can take your message direct to the people like that
7411000	7413000	We know Nintendo is doing a similar thing with Treehouse
7413000	7415000	Obviously Sony's got their thing going on
7415000	7417000	We don't know of Microsoft
7417000	7419000	Microsoft doesn't really have like a
7419000	7421000	People team right now
7421000	7423000	Like I know they have Major Nelson
7423000	7425000	He's kind of like the face of Xbox and so forth
7425000	7427000	I don't know, or am I mistaking something?
7427000	7429000	Yes I know there's the MVP program
7429000	7431000	And so forth but those folks
7431000	7433000	Aren't really like on camera
7433000	7435000	Or doing anything with that
7435000	7437000	So Microsoft doesn't really, like who would host a Microsoft stream
7437000	7439000	If they did something all day long
7439000	7441000	I guess it would be Major Nelson
7441000	7443000	But that's a lot for one person to do
7443000	7445000	Beam?
7445000	7447000	That's a good thought, that's actually a really good thought
7447000	7449000	We see on Twitch TV
7449000	7451000	We see a lot of the streaming from
7451000	7453000	Heroes of the Storm championships
7453000	7455000	Or League of Legends type of thing
7455000	7457000	So sure if Microsoft wanted to do an all day long thing
7457000	7459000	Beam would be a great place to do it for them
7459000	7461000	To get some more eyes and accounts over there
7461000	7463000	When they stream
7463000	7465000	Their events actually normally
7465000	7467000	They have it through Microsoft's own site
7467000	7469000	They've got their Silverlight
7469000	7471000	Plug in thing that they use
7471000	7473000	Were they the ones that had
7473000	7475000	Adam Sessler and Morgan Webb? Or is that Bethesda?
7475000	7477000	That's Bethesda
7477000	7479000	Bethesda, okay, my bad
7479000	7481000	I thought somebody was using, yeah
7481000	7483000	Bethesda was using them, so
7483000	7485000	Microsoft's the only one that kind of
7485000	7487000	Doesn't really do the same type of thing as the other companies
7487000	7489000	Which you know, whatever works for them
7489000	7491000	Alright
7491000	7493000	Moving on, let's travel around the world and check out
7493000	7495000	What you're going to be getting in stores this week
7495000	7497000	A little sooner than E3, Loki
7497000	7499000	We actually have a Wii U game coming out
7499000	7501000	Darksiders WarMastered Edition
7501000	7503000	Out on the Wii U
7503000	7505000	Also Disgaea 5 Complete

7517000	7519000	But let's see, Utawari
7519000	7521000	Rumono
7521000	7523000	Mask of Deception on Playstation 4

7533000	7535000	PC, Playstation 4, and Xbox One
7535000	7537000	Oh, some people looking forward to that
7537000	7539000	That's pretty awesome, so that's coming out this week as well
7539000	7541000	On Friday
7541000	7543000	Still not going to be like the NES version
7543000	7545000	Which I'm sorry, the NES version
7545000	7547000	Gets a bad rap, it's not as bad as
7547000	7549000	Y'all make it out to be
7549000	7551000	Was it an action figure that you could buy that actually they had
7551000	7553000	Yes
7553000	7555000	Let's see, Get Even
7555000	7557000	On PC, Playstation 4
7557000	7559000	And Xbox One
7559000	7561000	Guilty Gear Xrd

7581000	7583000	On the Nintendo Switch
7583000	7585000	That's it
7585000	7587000	Let's travel to Japan
7587000	7589000	No really, let's go to Japan
7589000	7591000	I'm gonna go
7591000	7593000	Captain Spike over at Game Buoy just got back from Japan
7593000	7595000	They did a great episode on that
7595000	7597000	Princess Irene is on her way to Japan
7597000	7599000	She left either yesterday or today
7599000	7601000	I want to go to Japan
7601000	7603000	But again, I'm worried
7603000	7605000	Because I don't speak Japanese
7605000	7607000	I know AkumaJP would help me out
7607000	7609000	He's a great pal
7609000	7611000	You'd actually be surprised the number of people
7611000	7613000	Who do speak some English
7613000	7615000	Oh yeah?
7615000	7617000	I wouldn't want one person to have to worry about me
7617000	7619000	For a whole trip while I'm out there
7619000	7621000	It's a lot to ask one person
7621000	7623000	Immersion is really good for our education
7623000	7625000	I guess that's true
7625000	7627000	Imagine if I could come back and I could actually pronounce
7627000	7629000	Japanese release dates
7629000	7631000	You should let me do them sometime
7631000	7633000	We were gonna trade at one point but then something happened
7633000	7635000	Oh you got pulled from the show for a few months
7635000	7637000	And we never ended up switching
7637000	7639000	You can take a semester of Japanese and you'd probably get
7639000	7641000	A lot better with the pronunciation
7641000	7643000	Education? I know right?
7643000	7645000	Actually what's funny is that
7645000	7647000	I am working on studying again
7647000	7649000	To try to pass the
7649000	7651000	First round of JLPT
7651000	7653000	I think that's what I'm gonna do
7653000	7655000	With the bidi fund
7655000	7657000	I'm gonna set my bidi fund on Twitch
7657000	7659000	So that once I get like $2,000
7659000	7661000	I'll go to Japan
7661000	7663000	Funny that you mentioned
7663000	7665000	There's a game, I think it's an RPG maker game
7665000	7667000	That's on Steam that's about learning Japanese
7667000	7669000	I picked it up, I just don't remember what it is
7669000	7671000	We talked about that on the show once
7671000	7673000	Is that the Fight Slimes Learn Japanese one?
7673000	7675000	I don't think that's what it was called
7675000	7677000	I know there was only 10 years ago
7677000	7679000	I don't remember it because it's
7679000	7681000	Somewhere by Steam library
7681000	7683000	Good luck finding whatever game that was
7683000	7685000	Yeah
7685000	7687000	There is a game out there that
7687000	7689000	Teaches you Japanese
7689000	7691000	Alright
7691000	7693000	And by the way I wouldn't really spend the bidi money
7693000	7695000	Going to Japan, I probably buy new
7695000	7697000	Microphones for our studio because I'm gonna
7697000	7699000	Have to do that bidis or not pretty soon
7699000	7701000	Alright anyway
7701000	7703000	Let's travel around the world here to Japan
7703000	7705000	And virtually we'll talk about
7705000	7707000	What's coming out on the Playstation 4
7707000	7709000	We're getting back into some heavy releases now
7709000	7711000	With all that Golden Week stuff that happened earlier in the month
7711000	7713000	But we have Hyper Light Drifter
7713000	7715000	Is making its Japanese release on the Playstation 4 this week
7715000	7717000	On the 25th
7717000	7719000	Summer Lesson Miyamoto Hikari edition
7719000	7721000	And not to be confused with Nintendo's Miyamoto
7721000	7723000	This is some other type of
7723000	7725000	Education game I believe
7725000	7727000	It is a Playstation VR game which I think is very interesting
7727000	7729000	I'm not sure what it is
7729000	7731000	You're learning about in this game
7731000	7733000	But your instructor looks like
7733000	7735000	A nice Japanese girl that you're
7735000	7737000	Maybe it's kind of like immersion
7737000	7739000	I like this shirt that she's wearing
7739000	7741000	A yeah shirt with a shark on it
7741000	7743000	It's cute anyway
7743000	7745000	Miyamoto Hikari edition is out this week
7745000	7747000	And then Guilty Gear Xrd Rev 2
7747000	7749000	Is also out in Japan
7749000	7751000	This week as well
7751000	7753000	That is all on the 25th
7753000	7755000	On the 3DS this week
7755000	7757000	Nothing, things are slowing down there
7757000	7759000	On the Switch this week
7759000	7761000	The Ultra Street Fighter release
7761000	7763000	Is also making its way to Japan this week
7763000	7765000	So you have that to look forward to
7765000	7767000	And then lastly looking at the Vita for this week
7767000	7769000	Sengoku Hime 7
7769000	7771000	Is out this week
7771000	7773000	In a regular and a limited edition
7773000	7775000	And Love of Love Emperor of Love
7775000	7777000	That's a whole lot of love
7777000	7779000	A limited edition on the Vita this week
7779000	7781000	So check that out
7781000	7783000	And those games, and I guess I didn't pick it up
7783000	7785000	Or at least I don't see it in my life
7785000	7787000	Learn Japanese to Survive
7787000	7789000	Yes, oh I do have it
7789000	7791000	Learn Japanese to Survive Hiragana Battle
7791000	7793000	Is what I've got
7793000	7795000	I have that one, I actually just bought the Katakana Battle
7795000	7797000	Even though I read Katakana better than Hiragana
7797000	7799000	I'll have to check that out
7799000	7801000	That's the reverse for me
7801000	7803000	Too many of the Katakana look similar to each other for me
7803000	7805000	It's just because I've read too many labels
7805000	7807000	Because if it's something that's Western
7807000	7809000	It's in Katakana
7811000	7813000	I still remember one of the first things I ever bought you
7813000	7815000	Dark Sakura when we were first friends
7815000	7817000	Was I bought you a Japanese copy of Harry Potter
7817000	7819000	Do you know I still have it?
7819000	7821000	Oh I would hope so
7821000	7823000	It's on my shelf with the little jacket on it
7823000	7825000	And it still has the insert in it where it explains what a crumpet is
7825000	7827000	No seriously
7827000	7829000	That's right
7829000	7831000	The inner part goes through
7831000	7833000	What different
7833000	7835000	Foreign terms would be
7835000	7837000	Jumper is used in the book
7837000	7839000	Why didn't the American editions have that?
7839000	7841000	Because we don't know what crumpets are
7841000	7843000	Keep in mind
7843000	7845000	The British one was
7845000	7847000	Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone
7847000	7849000	And they changed
7849000	7851000	I have the British and the US one
7851000	7853000	They changed a lot
7853000	7855000	When you get further on
7855000	7857000	Through the books, the last book is more
7857000	7859000	Dead even
7859000	7861000	Because I've read both of those two
7861000	7863000	But still it's a lot of
7863000	7865000	They actually shot like two different movies
7865000	7867000	Yeah but really it was just scenes that
7867000	7869000	Refer to the item
7869000	7871000	Anyway I don't know why I
7871000	7873000	Thought of that but you talking about reading Japanese
7873000	7875000	Made me think oh remember that book
7875000	7877000	It's because reading is fundamental
7877000	7879000	Reading is what?
7879000	7881000	What part of a lip sync don't you understand, Jamie?
7881000	7883000	That part
7883000	7885000	I'd like to keep it on please
7885000	7887000	The same parts
7888000	7890000	The same parts
7890000	7892000	That was a choice
7894000	7896000	Moving on, how about the UK Dark Saga
7896000	7898000	On the
7898000	7900000	What's today, the 21st?
7900000	7902000	On the 22nd, Trackmania 2
7902000	7904000	Lagoon for PC
7904000	7906000	On the 23rd, we have
7906000	7908000	Steel Division Normandy 44
7908000	7910000	Why can't it be Normandy SR2?
7910000	7915000	May 25th, we have Vanquish for PC
7915000	7917000	Samurai Warriors
7917000	7919000	Sanada Maru
7919000	7921000	Oh it's the same game
7921000	7923000	They just called it Spirit of Sanada
7923000	7925000	For the PC one
7925000	7927000	But it's PC and Playstation 4
7927000	7929000	And on the 26th
7929000	7931000	Rime for Xbone
7931000	7933000	PC and PS4
7935000	7937000	Stephanie
7937000	7939000	That's it, alright
7939000	7941000	Let's continue on with Dark Sakura
7941000	7943000	However because she's going to take a dive
7944000	7946000	Ain't gonna do it
7946000	7948000	In case you are
7948000	7950000	Why are you putting your phone number in your email?
7950000	7952000	Did somebody put their phone number in the email?
7952000	7954000	Yeah they did
7954000	7956000	One of these days I'm gonna call you live on air
7956000	7958000	We did that once
7958000	7960000	On a really really early OLR
7960000	7962000	We called somebody and it was so fucking awkward
7962000	7964000	Cause that person was having a bad day
7964000	7966000	You should just call my mom
7966000	7968000	I'm not gonna call that number
7968000	7970000	I would assume some people have it automatically
7970000	7972000	In their work emails that they email us from
7973000	7975000	Oh is it his signature?
7975000	7977000	Yeah it might be but still
7977000	7979000	Anyway I'm gonna call you
7979000	7981000	Just say hey it's Rob Roberts what you doing?
7981000	7983000	Hi baby
7983000	7985000	How you doing?
7985000	7987000	Well they didn't put a nickname in here so I'm just gonna call them Andrew
7987000	7989000	Okay
7989000	7992000	The email about the custom ITG machine last week reminded me
7992000	7994000	Oh here we go again
7994000	7996000	Here we go again
7996000	7998000	Another week
7998000	8000000	It's in the gate
8000000	8002000	It's what this is
8002000	8004000	The in the gate
8004000	8006000	I've always kind of wanted to get an arcade machine
8006000	8008000	I think Jamie said she has some
8008000	8010000	And I know Rob has talked about it before
8010000	8012000	Obviously space and funds are big hurdles
8012000	8014000	But I'm also a little afraid of spending a bunch of money
8014000	8018000	And then having a break and not being able to fix it
8018000	8020000	I'm not completely inept with technology
8020000	8022000	But I know enough to know that I know nothing Jon Snow
8022000	8026000	Do you have any tips or suggestions as far as places that sell them
8026000	8028000	Upkeeping machines etc?
8028000	8030000	My dream would be to own a DJ Max Technica 3 machine
8030000	8032000	I love that game so much
8032000	8034000	And the Vita and phone Technica games
8034000	8036000	Are merely serviceable limitations
8036000	8038000	A custom DDR ITG machine
8038000	8040000	Would probably be sweet too
8040000	8042000	And there are plenty of other arcade faves
8042000	8044000	I would enjoy having
8044000	8046000	Thanks Andrew
8046000	8048000	I will tell you this
8048000	8050000	Dan and I have owned a number of games over history
8050000	8052000	One of them was our original MAME cabinet
8052000	8054000	That Shermie lived in
8054000	8056000	We would pick up
8056000	8058000	When we were putting a MAME in those
8058000	8060000	We would just pick up
8060000	8062000	Husks of old games
8062000	8064000	And clean them up
8064000	8066000	And actually
8066000	8068000	Getting new arcade
8068000	8070000	I'd say full working arcade machines
8070000	8072000	Is not too far off than
8072000	8074000	Getting pinball tables
8074000	8076000	When Dan started
8076000	8078000	He was actually helping
8078000	8080000	A friend renovate
8080000	8082000	Some machines and getting them working
8082000	8084000	In exchange for our first pinball table
8084000	8086000	Which
8086000	8088000	We've had some
8088000	8090000	Stinkers over time
8090000	8092000	But working on them
8092000	8094000	Taught Dan how to keep working on them
8094000	8096000	You just don't do it until
8096000	8098000	You do it
8098000	8100000	But we've picked up machines on craigslist
8100000	8102000	We got
8102000	8104000	Our Gyruss
8104000	8106000	And you've played our Gyruss
8106000	8108000	Our Gyruss is in good shape
8108000	8110000	All we had to do was fix a fuse in it
8110000	8112000	So you're suggesting
8112000	8114000	That maybe even though this person
8114000	8116000	Knows nothing about arcade machines
8116000	8118000	Admittedly
8118000	8120000	I'm happy you referred to me in the email
8120000	8122000	But the only arcade machine in my house
8122000	8124000	Is a custom thing that Loki built
8124000	8126000	That I haven't turned on in two years
8126000	8128000	Because I think I unplugged something
8128000	8130000	And I don't know how to fix it
8130000	8132000	But at the same time
8132000	8134000	I don't really use it a lot
8134000	8136000	I've thought about it
8136000	8138000	I was gonna say
8138000	8140000	That was a bar top cabinet
8140000	8142000	Kit that I bought
8142000	8144000	I mean you can honestly just build one of your own
8144000	8146000	But I just didn't want to cut all this shit out
8146000	8148000	So really all it would take
8148000	8150000	Is just
8150000	8152000	Throw a computer inside
8152000	8154000	Put a monitor on a computer
8154000	8156000	And run MAME
8156000	8158000	That's probably the cheapest
8158000	8160000	Doing a Dance Dance Revolution cabinet
8160000	8162000	That's gonna be fucking expensive and difficult
8162000	8164000	Because either A, you're gonna have to build something yourself
8164000	8166000	And most likely if you're gonna do that
8166000	8168000	Just build some really nice pads
8168000	8170000	Instead of actually having a whole cabinet
8170000	8172000	Because it's gonna be a hassle
8172000	8174000	To fit that in your house
8174000	8176000	Or wherever you're gonna put it
8176000	8178000	And then just
8178000	8180000	It'd be probably cheaper anyway
8180000	8182000	Back in the day you could get a third mix on the cheap
8182000	8184000	And put anything in it
8184000	8186000	But now they're all different hardware
8186000	8188000	And people want that stuff to do that
8188000	8190000	Here's something that's becoming, are we done with the email yet?
8190000	8192000	Well not quite because I was gonna bring up another suggestion
8192000	8194000	Okay I'm gonna bring on
8194000	8196000	I actually know a subject matter expert on this
8196000	8198000	Because I just texted him we're gonna bring on on this
8198000	8200000	So in just a moment
8200000	8202000	I was just gonna say there's
8202000	8204000	A web show on YouTube
8204000	8206000	Called John's Arcade
8206000	8208000	Do you know who hosts that?
8208000	8210000	John from Video Game Outsiders who used to be on All Games with us
8210000	8212000	Back in the day
8212000	8214000	Yeah right?
8214000	8216000	Look what he's doing now
8216000	8218000	And look what we're doing now
8220000	8222000	I like to say that I like to watch
8222000	8224000	His show because he does go into the guts
8224000	8226000	Of the restoration
8226000	8228000	He answers questions for people
8228000	8230000	And I would probably say he's done a lot more renovation
8230000	8232000	Than Dan and I have done
8232000	8234000	He's learned a lot from his podcasting years
8234000	8236000	That he's applying to his YouTube medium
8236000	8238000	Yeah if I had a basement I would have an arcade
8238000	8240000	Yeah
8240000	8242000	Alright I'm gonna do a quick phone call here
8242000	8244000	Okay
8244000	8246000	So this might be somebody you want to say hello to as well
8246000	8248000	We're actually gonna call her live on air
8248000	8250000	So this is my pal
8250000	8252000	Melody
8252000	8254000	We're gonna take this call here
8254000	8256000	And I warned her that this is coming through
8256000	8258000	And she might have some people
8258000	8260000	She said she's in the car
8260000	8262000	That she's gonna take this call in the car
8262000	8264000	Hi is Melody there? Hi
8264000	8266000	Hi
8266000	8268000	Hi Melody it's Rob Roberts
8268000	8270000	Here at Orange Lounge Radio
8270000	8272000	How are you my dear?
8272000	8274000	I'm doing great how are you doing tonight?
8274000	8276000	I am good and thank you for agreeing
8276000	8278000	To come on last minute but you know sometimes we get emails
8278000	8280000	Okay we get emails here on the show
8280000	8282000	I don't know the answer to this question
8282000	8284000	But I know somebody who does
8284000	8286000	And this is what happened tonight is we got an email
8286000	8288000	About and the question was about
8288000	8290000	I want to get
8290000	8292000	Can you paraphrase what was that question we got
8292000	8294000	I want to own a DDR machine basically right?
8294000	8296000	Yeah one of them was I want to own a DDR machine
8296000	8298000	So I think we need to suggest something that's easy to maintain
8298000	8300000	And relatively on the cheap
8300000	8302000	So tell us a little bit about your home arcade
8302000	8304000	Melody
8304000	8306000	The one that keeps expanding
8306000	8308000	Until we run out of space
8308000	8310000	Which is now
8310000	8312000	We started out with one
8312000	8314000	DDR Solo 2000
8314000	8316000	That I'm with DJ Melvis right now
8316000	8318000	And it was his
8318000	8320000	And the board on it died
8320000	8322000	It had a bad RAM chip
8322000	8324000	So we have a friend who managed to hook a PS2
8324000	8326000	Into it so it runs off
8326000	8328000	It's a giant PS2 essentially
8328000	8330000	Then we stumbled
8330000	8332000	Into a friend who was selling
8332000	8334000	Para Para Paradise
8334000	8336000	Which is the game how can you
8336000	8338000	Brought that home
8338000	8340000	Then went to California Extreme
8340000	8342000	The gaming show and realized
8342000	8344000	I love Dance Maniacs
8344000	8346000	And wanted to own one
8346000	8348000	And I got lucky in that
8348000	8350000	I googled around and found one
8350000	8352000	And then decided we wanted
8352000	8354000	Another DDR machine
8354000	8356000	So I hopped on good old eBay
8356000	8358000	And discovered
8358000	8360000	When I was looking for
8360000	8362000	DDR Extreme
8362000	8364000	I found Revolution X
8364000	8366000	And we all went
8366000	8368000	Oh, that would be fun to own
8368000	8370000	So that came home from Indiana
8370000	8372000	Then
8372000	8374000	A special Revolution X
8374000	8376000	And that's my friend Christine in the back
8376000	8378000	We're all in the car right now
8378000	8380000	Hi kids
8380000	8382000	So
8382000	8384000	Then we ended up
8384000	8386000	Getting a friend's gauntlet
8386000	8388000	Because he doesn't have space
8388000	8390000	And then we decided we wanted
8390000	8392000	Another DDR when a friend of mine
8392000	8394000	Was talking to me about it
8394000	8396000	So we currently have
8396000	8398000	3 DDRs, a Para Para Paradise
8398000	8400000	A Dance Maniac, Gauntlet, and Revolution X
8400000	8402000	All in one garage
8402000	8404000	Even I don't know how you've
8404000	8406000	And you've even gone so far as to
8406000	8408000	Carpet your garage at this point
8408000	8410000	Yes
8410000	8412000	If I'm right don't y'all have a
8412000	8414000	We have two disco balls now
8414000	8416000	You almost
8416000	8418000	Can't see the black light carpet now
8418000	8420000	Because there's just so many machines in there
8420000	8422000	One little sliver of carpet
8422000	8424000	Wow
8424000	8426000	It is turning out to be quite amazing
8426000	8428000	And if I'm right don't y'all have a single
8428000	8430000	Car garage?
8430000	8432000	Yeah
8432000	8434000	Technically it's a two car garage
8434000	8436000	But you'd have to get really friendly with that second car
8436000	8438000	They call it a two car garage
8438000	8440000	But literally the two cars
8440000	8442000	Are nothing else
8442000	8444000	I know what you're talking about
8444000	8446000	And trust me
8446000	8448000	I feel your pain because we've got
8448000	8450000	Two disco balls in my garage now
8450000	8452000	And three arcade cabinets
8452000	8454000	And I'm very jealous of that World Cup
8454000	8456000	You know that's my baby
8456000	8458000	And y'all are always welcome to come over and play anytime
8458000	8460000	Okay so here's the thing
8460000	8462000	I want to get answered for our emailer
8462000	8464000	Now obviously when it comes to the money
8464000	8466000	When it comes to the money
8466000	8468000	I'm not going to ask how you afforded it
8468000	8470000	Because that's nobody's business
8470000	8472000	If y'all want something bad enough you save for it
8472000	8474000	That's what it is
8474000	8476000	So when it comes to the money you just have to save the money
8476000	8480000	How did you know that what you were going to get was a good quality?
8480000	8482000	It sounds like you took
8482000	8484000	You had a friend of a friend
8484000	8486000	Referral in a couple of those cases
8486000	8488000	So you kind of knew that that was good
8488000	8490000	But you did the eBay thing
8490000	8492000	How did you know that you were going to buy something that was going to work?
8492000	8494000	I asked a lot of questions
8494000	8496000	In that case
8496000	8498000	That was actually for the Revolution X
8498000	8500000	For those of us who don't know what Revolution X is
8500000	8502000	It's a 1990's
8502000	8504000	Shooter game starring
8504000	8506000	Aerosmith
8506000	8508000	And it is fantastic
8508000	8510000	Fantasticly bad
8510000	8512000	But it is a lot of fun
8512000	8514000	But I was
8514000	8516000	Smart enough to kind of know what I was looking at
8516000	8518000	I played it before once or twice
8518000	8520000	Mel and Christine
8520000	8522000	Have both played it several times
8522000	8524000	So I asked them
8524000	8526000	What should I be asking
8526000	8528000	And just asked a lot of detailed questions
8528000	8530000	When you can't get out
8530000	8532000	To actually try the machine yourself
8532000	8534000	It's important to know what you're looking at
8534000	8536000	And just
8536000	8538000	You're spending a lot of money on an investment
8538000	8540000	They need to answer your questions
8540000	8542000	If you're not comfortable with it, someone else is going to have another machine
8542000	8544000	And you're going to be fine with that one
8544000	8546000	I think that's some really solid advice
8546000	8548000	Melody, I'm going to let you go
8548000	8550000	Because obviously this segment
8550000	8552000	Has taken like 10 minutes of our time now
8552000	8554000	But I really appreciate you letting me do this to you last minute
8556000	8558000	Yeah, not a problem
8558000	8560000	Quite honestly, you know how to get a hold of me
8560000	8562000	If they have more questions, I'm willing to answer
8562000	8564000	Quite honestly, if any listeners have questions
8564000	8566000	I'm willing to do what I can to help
8566000	8568000	I mean, I'm not an expert
8568000	8570000	By any stretch of the imagination
8570000	8572000	But I've done this a few times now
8572000	8574000	So if people have questions on what they should be looking for
8574000	8576000	Or how to look for it
8576000	8578000	I'm happy to help out
8578000	8580000	Do you have a Twitter?
8580000	8582000	I do have a Twitter
8582000	8584000	What is my Twitter?
8584000	8586000	anonymous
8586000	8588000	There you go
8588000	8590000	So you can get a hold of our direct
8590000	8592000	You don't have to go through us
8592000	8594000	You can reach out to anonymous directly
8594000	8596000	And get your questions answered
8596000	8598000	About DDR home ownership
8598000	8600000	Thank you so much you guys
8600000	8602000	Have a safe drive wherever you're going
8602000	8604000	Have fun storming the castle
8604000	8606000	Have a good dinner guys
8606000	8608000	I did a quick search
8608000	8610000	Bye, take care
8610000	8612000	Did a quick search on eBay
8612000	8614000	And every now and then you can find some pretty good deals
8614000	8616000	Too bad it's in Washington
8616000	8618000	I made a third mix
8618000	8620000	It's missing the hardware
8620000	8622000	But the pads and everything
8622000	8624000	It's kind of torn apart
8624000	8626000	But $167 for the whole cabinet
8626000	8628000	What? Wow
8628000	8630000	So I was like, fuck
8630000	8632000	That's all I would want right there
8632000	8634000	It's just the pads anyway
8634000	8636000	It's a good deal, too bad it's in Washington
8636000	8638000	Jump on that, ends tomorrow
8638000	8640000	So if you're interested in the Washington area, there you go
8640000	8642000	And let this be a lesson to anybody that knows me
8642000	8644000	IRL
8644000	8646000	It's not the Rolodex I hate, but it's the one next to that
8646000	8648000	It's the little Rolodex in my head
8648000	8650000	That's like, oh, so and so has this
8650000	8652000	So and so does this
8652000	8654000	And when I hear it, I'm gonna call you
8654000	8656000	On a moment's notice
8656000	8658000	Like I just called Melody
8658000	8660000	There we go, anyway
8660000	8662000	It was funny, I was thinking of Melody in terms of the
8662000	8664000	DDR machines
8664000	8666000	And all the stuff you said about pinball
8666000	8668000	And all that's great, but I know
8668000	8670000	Oh my god, when I hear all this, I'm like, Melody
8670000	8672000	Owns the music game stuff
8672000	8674000	Now I didn't know that they had a Revolution X
8674000	8676000	And now I'm super jelly because I love
8676000	8678000	That stupid game, because you can go
8678000	8680000	And find like Steve Perry on the toilet
8680000	8682000	The last time I was over
8682000	8684000	There, we played Dance Mediacs
8684000	8686000	And they had just got the Revolution X
8686000	8688000	But the gauntlet is new and now
8688000	8690000	The carpeting, they're really making an
8690000	8692000	Arcade out of that, that's Mel's arcade
8692000	8694000	You wanna talk about John's arcade, now you got Mel's arcade
8694000	8696000	Competition on the west coast
8696000	8698000	Dan and I had an off talk about
8698000	8700000	Next time we look for another house
8700000	8702000	Of maybe doing a three car garage
8702000	8704000	So that he can have a place for the Mustang
8704000	8706000	The Mustang's got paint on it now
8706000	8708000	Get one of those insulated garages like I used to have
8708000	8710000	At the other house, I know that place
8710000	8712000	Got insanely hot, but with a swamp cooler
8712000	8714000	That place would have been a great
8714000	8716000	We had the tornado of doom
8716000	8718000	That was great, anyhow
8718000	8720000	Alright, last email, very long answer to that email
8720000	8722000	But a good one
8722000	8724000	As a follow up from last week, I neglected to specify
8724000	8726000	That my headphones are used more for my mobile
8726000	8728000	Devices than my computer and consoles
8728000	8730000	This is from Robert M by the way
8730000	8732000	Unfortunately by those standards, I really can't use
8732000	8734000	Any of the sets that you recommend
8734000	8736000	Coincidentally though, Ninja Sista and
8736000	8738000	Pandelicious of Electric Sista-hood
8738000	8740000	Began their show talking about
8740000	8742000	Checking out Lucid Sound LS30
8742000	8744000	Set, as well as the manufacturer
8744000	8746000	Set for Xbox One, I will definitely have to
8746000	8748000	Try out the former for myself
8748000	8750000	How funny, what a coincidence
8750000	8752000	But yay, yay Electric Sista-hood
8752000	8754000	I had the chance
8754000	8756000	To go to this year's Anime St. Louis
8756000	8758000	In St. Charles and
8758000	8760000	Was excited to find out that the game room
8760000	8762000	This year was set up by Tokyo Attack
8762000	8764000	Who I'm sure Ron was familiar with
8764000	8766000	I'm familiar with
8766000	8768000	What's in Rhode Island?
8768000	8770000	Yes, but they're all over the East Coast
8770000	8772000	I've also laid out their ads for DerpyCon
8772000	8774000	Funny
8774000	8776000	FYI, I've done the DerpyCon
8776000	8778000	Guidebook
8778000	8780000	For like four years now
8780000	8782000	If you're a music game fan on the East Coast, you know
8782000	8784000	Tokyo Attack, you do
8784000	8786000	Outstanding Japanese arcade games
8786000	8788000	Mostly music rhythm and a surprisingly
8788000	8790000	High representation of Konami machines
8790000	8792000	Then again, being music games
8792000	8794000	I got to play the WarioWare-like
8794000	8796000	The Bishibashi
8796000	8798000	I love Bishibashi
8798000	8800000	They have that at Japantown in the arcade
8800000	8802000	Is it the
8802000	8804000	Original Bishibashi or the Bishibashi
8804000	8806000	Special? I don't know what the difference is
8806000	8808000	Okay
8808000	8810000	And of course the Tea Table flipping game
8810000	8812000	I'm also there
8812000	8814000	Don't flip it unless you're playing it
8814000	8816000	I like that sign
8816000	8818000	Didn't stay as long as I probably should have
8818000	8820000	But enjoyed wondering
8820000	8822000	About seeing attendees' costumes
8822000	8824000	Lots of Overwatch, of course
8824000	8826000	Robert M
8826000	8827000	That's it
8827000	8828000	Great, awesome
8828000	8829000	Thanks for the emails you guys
8829000	8830000	If you want to email us in a future week
8830000	8832000	Participate at
8832000	8834000	OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to
8834000	8835000	Participate
8835000	8836000	To do those things
8836000	8838000	Alright, we're going to be taking your calls
8838000	8840000	Not only do we call out sometimes, but sometimes
8840000	8842000	I'll call in over at OrangeLoungeRadio
8842000	8844000	All one word on Skype
8844000	8846000	But we'll get to those calls after some more news
8846000	8848000	First off, Loki
8848000	8850000	It's like this never ends, but
8850000	8852000	You may remember
8852000	8854000	It's been a big deal with the whole ZeniMax
8854000	8856000	Oculus suit
8856000	8858000	Well that's concluded, of course, with Oculus
8858000	8860000	Owing ZeniMax some money
8860000	8862000	So what's the next step?
8862000	8864000	ZeniMax, of course, is going after Samsung
8864000	8866000	Because Samsung
8866000	8868000	Makes a device called the Gear VR
8868000	8870000	Which is powered by Oculus
8870000	8872000	Which is powered by profit for
8872000	8874000	Bethesda, because they feel that it
8874000	8876000	Fringes on their intellectual
8876000	8878000	Property
8878000	8880000	Is this the same thing? Bobby was talking a lot about
8880000	8882000	VR stuff on his show tonight, he was talking about something where like
8882000	8884000	There was a conversation that happened
8884000	8886000	With like a former, and this whole lawsuit
8886000	8888000	Is coming from a freaking conversation
8888000	8890000	That happened between like a
8890000	8892000	Former employee of a company
8892000	8894000	It sounded like a stretch
8894000	8896000	He described it much better than I could because
8896000	8898000	Admittedly, do not follow all the VR
8898000	8900000	Drama as much as he does, but you know
8900000	8902000	Yeah, they're very litigious
8902000	8904000	So hopefully, I'm wondering
8904000	8906000	With this, if that's going to be
8906000	8908000	More of a stretch, because it's like
8908000	8910000	I don't know how much is really powered by Oculus
8910000	8912000	I mean, because it's just
8912000	8914000	It's just a damn image with
8914000	8916000	It's a basic case
8916000	8918000	There's no real hardware in the
8918000	8920000	The device, so I don't know
8920000	8922000	It might be a little bit trickier, but
8922000	8924000	But they feel that they have precedent
8924000	8926000	Based off the last Oculus
8926000	8928000	Are they drunk with power now? Because what happened with Facebook
8928000	8930000	Is that's what's happening?
8930000	8932000	Dude, I get it
8932000	8934000	That you're suing these people
8934000	8936000	Let's see you put a VR device in
8936000	8938000	If you're going to sue all these people over
8938000	8940000	Your technology being used
8940000	8942000	Let's see what this is going to be
8942000	8944000	Are you going to sit on it?
8944000	8946000	I just don't fucking care
8946000	8948000	I mean, like
8948000	8950000	Fallout VR might be cool, but
8950000	8952000	I don't know
8952000	8954000	Hey, like a
8954000	8956000	Skyrim type of VR thing
8956000	8958000	Might be really rad
8958000	8960000	I'd be down with that too
8960000	8962000	Alright, well let's move on to something else
8962000	8964000	That I think a lot of us were down with
8964000	8966000	And then it was suddenly gone
8966000	8968000	Y'all know how Scalebound got cancelled, right?
8968000	8970000	Microsoft was teaming up with
8970000	8972000	Platinum Games to do Scalebound
8972000	8974000	And it just got cancelled a couple months ago
8974000	8976000	Which, unfortunately
8976000	8978000	There's a variety of reasons why this could have happened
8978000	8980000	It could have been because nobody in Japan
8980000	8982000	Has an Xbox One and maybe Microsoft
8982000	8984000	Has just decided they're not going to
8984000	8986000	Continue to pursue the Japanese market, I don't know
8986000	8988000	Or perhaps deadlines were not
8988000	8990000	Being met, I don't know
8990000	8992000	But, here's the interesting
8992000	8994000	Again, these are rumors, but the interesting rabble rabble
8994000	8996000	Going around right now is that this
8996000	8998000	Project might not actually
8998000	9000000	Be dead, but this is coming
9000000	9002000	From the fact that Microsoft has renewed
9002000	9004000	The trademark
9004000	9006000	There are rumors in addition to that
9006000	9008000	That are saying the teams are working
9008000	9010000	On salvaging the project
9010000	9012000	Possibly even
9012000	9014000	Reworking it from the ground up
9014000	9016000	Without Platinum being involved
9016000	9018000	Talk about it
9018000	9020000	Wouldn't Platinum's
9020000	9022000	Logos still have to be on it?
9022000	9024000	Because they kind of started the development
9024000	9026000	And would own the name Scalebound?
9026000	9028000	They wouldn't necessarily own it
9028000	9030000	But they would be partial owners with it with Microsoft
9030000	9032000	Right? Even though they might not end up
9032000	9034000	Developing this game at all?
9034000	9036000	I know, lots of rumors
9036000	9038000	And who knows what, this could be a very
9038000	9040000	If this shows up at E3
9040000	9042000	This is going to be a very
9042000	9044000	Audible gasp type of moment
9044000	9046000	During the presser
9046000	9048000	I was all that hot on Scalebound to begin with
9048000	9050000	I'd be like, yeah, that's neat
9050000	9052000	I don't think I'd be
9052000	9054000	Audible gasp
9054000	9056000	Well, I mean, because there's going to be
9056000	9058000	A lot of people that are like, whoa
9058000	9060000	Platinum totally got shafted
9060000	9062000	In that whole deal, so
9062000	9064000	It's not like Platinum makes
9064000	9066000	Stinker games, like Bayonetta, Bayonetta 2
9066000	9068000	Hello, those are like some of the best video games ever made
9068000	9070000	Starbucks
9070000	9072000	Oh yeah, that's right, Platinum did do that
9072000	9074000	Well, okay, not everything's a winner
9074000	9076000	They also did, I think it was Platinum
9076000	9078000	They did Anarchy Reigns
9078000	9080000	Which wasn't that great either
9080000	9082000	Vanquish was good
9082000	9084000	Whatever, not everybody's going to be
9084000	9086000	Hitting everything out of the ballpark
9086000	9088000	All the time
9088000	9090000	After all, Rockstar did make
9090000	9092000	Rockstar Table Tennis, but that's not necessarily
9092000	9094000	A genre that I'm interested in
9094000	9096000	Hi, Allen's back
9096000	9098000	Hello, Platinum Games makes great
9098000	9100000	Games, but they make great niche games
9100000	9102000	That's their thing, they don't
9102000	9104000	Really make games with mass appeal
9104000	9106000	Which I'm sure a lot of people
9106000	9108000	Love Platinum Games because
9108000	9110000	They will do that good, weird shit
9110000	9112000	But the rumor of like
9112000	9114000	Is Platinum Games Studio going to
9114000	9116000	Shut down because Microsoft totally
9116000	9118000	Screwed them over with this
9118000	9120000	Basically it's like
9120000	9122000	Is this a sign
9122000	9124000	That the studio is failing because
9124000	9126000	They can't make a massive
9126000	9128000	Blockbuster, but it's like that's
9128000	9130000	Not what they do, like Bayonetta 2
9130000	9132000	Probably one of the best action fighting
9132000	9134000	Beat em up games ever
9134000	9136000	But it was made on the Wii U and even then
9136000	9138000	If any fucking Wii U game
9138000	9140000	Needs to be re-released, it's that
9140000	9142000	Seriously, so Platinum Games is great, but they
9142000	9144000	Just, they don't
9144000	9146000	Because they're always looking for
9146000	9148000	The new weird shit
9148000	9150000	Maybe that's one of the things
9150000	9152000	That Microsoft didn't like about them, they take too long
9152000	9154000	And they're like, we don't know
9154000	9156000	What you're doing with this, this is too weird for us
9156000	9158000	Maybe that's it
9158000	9160000	But I'm sure Platinum Games
9160000	9162000	Is going to be just fine, there are rumors
9162000	9164000	Very, very, very big rumors
9164000	9166000	Of Bayo 3
9166000	9168000	With some things that showed up in the PC release
9168000	9170000	And just the fact
9170000	9172000	That Bayonetta deserves another game
9172000	9174000	Even if the second game was on Wii U
9174000	9178000	Nintendo may recognize that it's their own damn fault
9178000	9180000	It didn't sell, and they may be back in the third one
9180000	9182000	I was so happy when Bayonetta
9182000	9184000	PC port showed up out of nowhere
9184000	9186000	Because I thought, they have all the Devil May Cry shit
9186000	9188000	On here, why don't they do
9188000	9190000	Bayonetta, when it happened
9190000	9192000	It's so awesome, but we'll never
9192000	9194000	We will never get Bayonetta 2
9194000	9196000	On PC because Nintendo
9196000	9198000	Paid every penny for that game
9198000	9200000	So hopefully they're paying for a third game
9200000	9202000	So I don't care, I want anyway
9202000	9204000	But yeah, I realize it's not realistic
9204000	9206000	A true internet gamer
9206000	9208000	I don't care if it doesn't make sense
9208000	9210000	I want it, and I'm going to be mad if I don't get it
9212000	9214000	Alright, moving on
9214000	9216000	Let's go to another story
9216000	9218000	Dark Sakura
9218000	9220000	Well this one made my heart sing
9220000	9222000	You?
9222000	9224000	Me, my shriveled little heart
9224000	9226000	Inflated three sizes
9226000	9228000	Basically
9228000	9230000	There is a blind gamer
9230000	9232000	Blind gamer in Japan
9232000	9234000	Who sent Nintendo
9234000	9236000	Yeah, there's the gasp
9236000	9238000	That sent Nintendo a
9238000	9240000	A letter, not asking for
9240000	9242000	Nintendo's been known to replace
9242000	9244000	Broken games and things
9244000	9246000	When customers have been incredibly sad by it
9246000	9248000	If their circumstances
9248000	9250000	In particular
9250000	9252000	The dad wrote out the letter
9252000	9254000	From his son
9254000	9256000	And I will
9256000	9258000	Go ahead and read the letter
9258000	9260000	Basically, the son's name is Hibiki
9260000	9262000	And he has retinoblastoma
9262000	9264000	In both eyes
9264000	9266000	So he's been blind since he was two years old
9266000	9268000	I'll read the letter
9268000	9270000	Dear Nintendo, hello, my name is Hibiki Sakai
9270000	9272000	And I am in fifth grade
9272000	9274000	I am blind, but I've always wanted
9274000	9276000	To play video games like everybody else
9276000	9278000	But there aren't many games
9278000	9280000	I can play at all
9280000	9282000	The one game I can really play is Rhythm Tengoku
9282000	9286000	For those who don't know, that's Rhythm Heaven
9286000	9288000	It's the only game I can enjoy
9288000	9290000	Together with others
9290000	9292000	And I never lose at it
9292000	9294000	I've gotten perfect scores on all the versions
9294000	9296000	On the Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS, Wii
9296000	9298000	And 3DS too
9298000	9300000	So I really, really
9300000	9302000	Want you to make more Rhythm Tengoku games
9302000	9304000	And it's perfectly fine if you make them
9304000	9306000	A little harder too
9306000	9308000	I think that there are a lot of other kids with visual impairments
9308000	9310000	Who want to play video games but can't
9310000	9312000	So I'd love for you to develop more games
9312000	9314000	For people with handicaps to enjoy playing with others
9314000	9316000	I will always support you Nintendo
9316000	9318000	From Hibiki Sakai
9318000	9320000	So Nintendo replied
9320000	9322000	First of all
9322000	9324000	With a letter in Braille
9324000	9326000	Which I thought was pretty neat
9326000	9328000	And then a printed one
9328000	9330000	I guess for Dad to read
9330000	9332000	And so the response from that is
9332000	9334000	Thank you so much for sending us here
9334000	9336000	At Nintendo your heartwarming letter
9336000	9338000	We're so happy to hear that you've perfected
9338000	9340000	And enjoyed Rhythm Tengoku, Rhythm Tengoku Gold
9340000	9342000	Mina no Rhythm Tengoku
9342000	9344000	And Rhythm Tengoku the best
9344000	9346000	We have passed on your letter to Nintendo's
9346000	9348000	Development department
9348000	9350000	We want to keep making games that everyone can have fun playing
9350000	9352000	So thank you for your support
9352000	9354000	So
9354000	9356000	Also the kid plays the drums really well too
9356000	9358000	Did you watch the video?
9358000	9360000	I didn't watch the video
9360000	9362000	He plays drums pretty well
9362000	9364000	But yeah I just thought that it was neat
9364000	9366000	Because there was another thing on here
9366000	9368000	Where his dad said that
9368000	9370000	He was going under surgery
9370000	9372000	That will quote
9372000	9374000	Be nothing but days full of pain and tears
9376000	9378000	So that he can
9378000	9380000	Hopefully regain some vision
9380000	9382000	Or have his eyes taken care of
9382000	9384000	But it's just
9384000	9386000	You know we have some
9386000	9388000	Some listeners
9388000	9390000	Who have some visual impairment
9390000	9392000	Others who
9392000	9394000	Have you know
9394000	9396000	All kinds of
9396000	9398000	I would say
9398000	9400000	Limited abilities
9400000	9402000	In some physical aspects
9402000	9404000	Be it
9404000	9406000	You know like we were talking about vision
9406000	9408000	Hearing, mobility
9408000	9410000	Autism, hello
9410000	9412000	You know other things
9412000	9414000	And I think that it's great that
9414000	9416000	Nintendo
9416000	9418000	Took the time to respond to that
9418000	9420000	Letter and acknowledge that
9420000	9422000	There are people out there who play games
9422000	9424000	Who may not be
9424000	9426000	Your generally abled person
9426000	9428000	So
9428000	9430000	I thought it was really good
9430000	9432000	No that's awesome
9432000	9434000	And I really super love that they replied
9434000	9436000	With a braille letter
9436000	9438000	Well done Nintendo, kudos
9438000	9440000	And also I
9440000	9442000	Probably not going to hear this but I do hope
9442000	9444000	Hibiki's surgery goes well
9444000	9446000	Same
9446000	9448000	Alright thank you for sharing that nice story DarkSarka
9448000	9450000	Appreciate it
9450000	9452000	Alright we just have a couple more stories for you guys
9452000	9454000	So speaking of more VR stuff
9454000	9456000	This is pretty cool
9456000	9458000	So a
9458000	9460000	I guess a
9460000	9462000	Half Life 2 mod
9462000	9464000	Or a Half Life 2
9464000	9466000	VR mod
9466000	9468000	For the Oculus Rift and Vive
9468000	9470000	Has been in the works since 2013
9470000	9472000	It just made its way through
9472000	9474000	Steam Greenlight
9474000	9476000	So hopefully that means
9476000	9478000	It will be coming out relatively soon
9478000	9480000	So having the project on Steam
9480000	9482000	Of course will make it easier for them to develop
9484000	9486000	So they're allowed to do this even though Half Life
9486000	9488000	Isn't really their game
9488000	9490000	I think so yeah, there's been other mods that have gotten
9490000	9492000	Like Gary's mod is out there right
9492000	9494000	Well Gary's mod, there's also
9494000	9496000	Some Portal side story
9496000	9498000	Stuff that they had that they released
9498000	9500000	Granted those were free, I'm not sure if this
9500000	9502000	Is going to cost anything when it comes out
9502000	9504000	Maybe not, maybe it might be
9504000	9506000	A free thing, so I don't know
9506000	9508000	If you have
9508000	9510000	Half Life or something like that
9510000	9512000	Or a Valve game that you'll be able to play this
9512000	9514000	Alright
9514000	9516000	Well, unfortunately
9516000	9518000	Ending on a not so great
9518000	9520000	Note tonight, but I just want to take a minute to let
9520000	9522000	You all know, if you didn't know
9522000	9524000	That I guess this was on May 13th
9524000	9526000	That this actually happened, but
9526000	9528000	American voice actor John
9528000	9530000	Sigan, I don't know if I said that right, I'm really sorry
9530000	9532000	If I mispronounced that, but he passed away
9532000	9534000	And he was more
9534000	9536000	Probably known to you guys as an actor
9536000	9538000	In the Metal Gear series
9538000	9540000	He was Solidius Snake
9540000	9542000	In Metal Gear Solid 2
9542000	9544000	Sons of Liberty, but he was also in
9544000	9546000	Some other TV productions and so forth
9546000	9548000	And he did Mafia 3, he was in that game
9548000	9550000	As well, so
9550000	9552000	Unfortunately
9552000	9554000	We lost him this week, so rest in peace
9554000	9556000	Alright, we're going to
9556000	9558000	Move on to the Skype line
9558000	9560000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word
9560000	9562000	On Skype is the place you can call us
9562000	9564000	And we'll
9564000	9566000	Take your calls, Orange Lounge Radio again
9566000	9568000	All one word on Skype
9568000	9570000	It is already lighting up in here
9570000	9572000	Let's get to some calls and take some calls
9572000	9574000	Oh my god
9574000	9576000	Hi Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
9576000	9578000	Hey Zaku, long time
9578000	9580000	I know, I know, the struggle
9580000	9582000	Was kind of real, but it was only
9582000	9584000	Because I finally
9584000	9586000	Let's say, switched careers
9586000	9588000	Well not so much switched careers, but switched jobs
9588000	9590000	New phone, who dis?
9590000	9592000	Yeah
9592000	9594000	I'm starting a new job tomorrow
9594000	9596000	So as a result, yeah
9596000	9598000	I had to stay away from things like OLR for a bit
9598000	9600000	Although you did see me in December
9600000	9602000	When I was out on the West Coast
9602000	9604000	Briefly
9604000	9606000	Well what's on your mind tonight?
9606000	9608000	Nothing much, other than the fact that
9608000	9610000	Things like E3 is looming
9610000	9612000	And the fact that I got
9612000	9614000	Well, another one that I caught was like
9614000	9616000	The fact that free to play
9616000	9618000	Doesn't necessarily mean
9618000	9620000	You know
9620000	9622000	It doesn't necessarily mean
9622000	9624000	That everyone's on the same page
9624000	9626000	Case in point, I don't know
9626000	9628000	If you read this article recently
9628000	9630000	Where one YouTube streamer
9630000	9632000	Basically got
9632000	9634000	Threatened with a
9634000	9636000	Strike on their account because
9636000	9638000	Wargaming, the folks who make World of Tanks
9638000	9640000	Didn't like the fact that they were
9640000	9642000	That he was basically bashing
9642000	9644000	Their
9644000	9646000	New tank that essentially
9646000	9648000	Played a win-grab
9648000	9650000	That's designed to maximize
9650000	9652000	The amount of profit
9652000	9654000	You know, for these freemium games
9654000	9656000	I really fucking hate
9656000	9658000	When copyright holders, and this is a problem
9658000	9660000	I put this squarely on YouTube
9660000	9662000	Honestly, for having this system set up in the first place
9662000	9664000	But I hate when copyright holders
9664000	9666000	Kind of abuse that to
9666000	9668000	Try to strike down, you know, things that are
9668000	9670000	Critical, and that's what it is
9670000	9672000	It's a criticism, and it's not like
9672000	9674000	Unfounded criticism either
9674000	9676000	It's, you know, like you say
9676000	9678000	Potentially a play to win type of situation
9678000	9680000	And people have a right to kind of know about that
9680000	9682000	Just like, you know, when Siskel
9682000	9684000	And Ebert use a clip from a movie
9684000	9686000	To drive home the point that this movie might be kind of
9686000	9688000	Fucking terrible, then
9688000	9690000	Obviously I'm dating myself using that reference
9690000	9692000	But you know what I mean, those names live on
9692000	9694000	And mean any movie reviewers
9694000	9696000	That are out there, they use a clip
9696000	9698000	And they might be critical of it
9698000	9700000	The movie people aren't like, well we're
9700000	9702000	Gonna fucking sue your show, and
9702000	9704000	You're never going to be able to review our movie again
9704000	9706000	I'm sure somebody's tried that, but it doesn't
9706000	9708000	Fucking work, because, you know,
9708000	9710000	We have, that's why we have fair use laws
9710000	9712000	To be able to comment on that stuff
9712000	9714000	But on the other hand, to be fair
9714000	9716000	This one, he was part
9716000	9718000	Of a particular program
9718000	9720000	That gives said people
9720000	9722000	Insider access to upcoming
9722000	9724000	DLC
9724000	9726000	If they want to kick him out of the program, fine
9726000	9728000	But he has every right to say, I got
9728000	9730000	Kicked out of the program because I
9730000	9732000	Went against the grain, and I wouldn't
9733000	9735000	True, but at the same token
9735000	9737000	The reason why they're after him in particular
9737000	9739000	Is because of the fact that he actually
9739000	9741000	Cursed him out in a YouTube video
9741000	9743000	Like he cursed out Wargaming
9743000	9745000	He essentially
9745000	9747000	He essentially bit the hand that
9747000	9748000	Fed him
9748000	9750000	Well, now when we're getting into the level
9750000	9752000	Now when we're talking about unprofessionalism
9752000	9753000	Yeah
9753000	9755000	Now, okay, now my opinion starts to sway
9755000	9757000	A little bit, is that okay, well
9757000	9759000	If you're unprofessional, then yes, you were gonna
9759000	9761000	Get kicked out of the club. However
9761000	9763000	I would still say he has
9763000	9765000	A right to be critical, but you
9765000	9767000	Have to expect that if you're unprofessional
9767000	9769000	In the way that you do it, you're gonna get kicked
9769000	9771000	Out of the special club, and you're not gonna be able to
9771000	9772000	Get some of those perks
9772000	9774000	But they also copyright strike his videos too
9774000	9776000	Did they end up doing that?
9776000	9778000	See, that's a low blow in my opinion
9778000	9780000	Yeah, they did that
9780000	9782000	Just because of the fact that
9782000	9784000	Even though, yes, you have a right to criticize
9784000	9786000	You know, under copyright law
9786000	9788000	You have the right to criticize something
9788000	9790000	Something copyrighted, but whether or not
9790000	9792000	Like he's violating any
9792000	9794000	Any NDA or any type of
9794000	9796000	Agreement that he signed as part of joining
9796000	9798000	The contributors program, that's probably where they're
9798000	9800000	They're trying to
9800000	9802000	Protect that copyright, in addition to
9802000	9804000	Also protecting their brand by not
9804000	9806000	By trying to essentially
9806000	9808000	Not associate their brand
9808000	9810000	With someone who essentially
9810000	9812000	You know, uses F-bombs to
9812000	9814000	You know, to make their point about
9814000	9816000	Something, to vent their frustration
9816000	9818000	But not do it in a very professional manner
9818000	9820000	And they don't
9820000	9822000	But they don't owe him a goddamn thing
9822000	9824000	And that's important too
9824000	9826000	And I say that to anybody
9826000	9828000	That's trying to get into this medium
9828000	9830000	The YouTubes, the Twitches, the podcasting
9830000	9832000	And all this stuff, and this is one lesson
9832000	9834000	We've learned over the past 15 years
9834000	9836000	Not that I ever think we were guilty of committing it
9836000	9838000	But one thing, you know, I gotta let you all know
9838000	9840000	Is, you know, nobody
9840000	9842000	Owes you a goddamn thing
9842000	9844000	You're gonna have to work for it, you know
9844000	9846000	And that's what it boils
9846000	9848000	Down to at the end of the day, when it comes to
9848000	9850000	Viewers, when it comes to
9850000	9852000	Free products, when it comes to
9852000	9854000	Getting into E3 and all this stuff
9854000	9856000	Nobody fucking owes you shit
9856000	9858000	And you're gonna have to really work and prove
9858000	9860000	And that's
9860000	9862000	Where people sometimes get into a tricky
9862000	9864000	Tricky area, because some people
9864000	9866000	Are like, I wanna be in the circle
9866000	9868000	I wanna be somebody that's gonna be
9868000	9870000	Recognized, so I'm gonna be a mouthpiece
9870000	9872000	For these organizations and I'm gonna
9872000	9874000	Say everything that they wanna hear
9874000	9876000	Because I wanna be accepted, I wanna be loved
9876000	9878000	And I wanna go to all these parties
9878000	9880000	But then you're kind of, you know
9880000	9882000	Losing, so it's like
9882000	9884000	It's a really tricky
9884000	9886000	Balance you have to do
9886000	9888000	Where it's like, you can be nice
9888000	9890000	To your, and you can be
9890000	9892000	Professional, this is where this guy went wrong
9892000	9894000	As he was unprofessional, you can be nice
9894000	9896000	You can be professional to all that, to these companies
9896000	9898000	But at the same time, you kinda owe it to your
9898000	9900000	You owe it to your audience
9900000	9902000	To be honest
9902000	9904000	Yeah, and unfortunately
9904000	9906000	He basically, the way he went about it
9906000	9908000	He had, I mean
9908000	9910000	His criticisms were very
9910000	9912000	Fair, I have to give him that
9912000	9914000	But the way he went about it
9914000	9916000	And the fact that he threw his
9916000	9918000	You know, he threw Wargaming
9918000	9920000	Under the bus, especially if they provided
9920000	9922000	Him with something that wasn't even out yet
9922000	9924000	This was like upcoming
9924000	9926000	Like this DLC was essentially
9926000	9928000	You know, not even released to the public
9928000	9930000	And that's probably why they're going after him
9930000	9932000	Well, okay, now
9932000	9934000	Okay, now, see, now the
9934000	9936000	But why give it to him then? Why give it to him
9936000	9938000	If they didn't want him talking about it?
9938000	9940000	Well, but here's the, if the DLC wasn't
9940000	9942000	Released yet, and he put that on
9942000	9944000	YouTube
9944000	9946000	But now we're in slippery slope
9946000	9948000	But they wouldn't have done that
9948000	9950000	If he talked favorably about it
9950000	9952000	Yeah, I still
9952000	9954000	Think it's a dick move
9954000	9956000	On Wargaming's part, and this is a bigger
9956000	9958000	Issue, for that part
9958000	9960000	But really, this guy should have just been
9960000	9962000	Professional to begin with
9962000	9964000	I think the copyright strike is a bit far
9964000	9966000	But this is, at the end of the day, this is all
9966000	9968000	Fucking YouTube's problem
9968000	9970000	This is a YouTube culture that YouTube's created
9970000	9972000	And YouTube's bots have created this problem
9972000	9974000	And YouTube refuses to fucking fix it
9974000	9976000	Right, and I mean
9976000	9978000	Like, I guess what he
9978000	9980000	I guess where Wargaming draws the line
9980000	9982000	Is that, you know, they're saying
9982000	9984000	Quote, you know, there's a level of toxicity
9984000	9986000	Under offensive language that is
9986000	9988000	Unacceptable, even though they're more than
9988000	9990000	Willing to give members of their community
9990000	9992000	Second chances, but things like
9992000	9994000	The fact that, you know, he's more than
9994000	9996000	Welcome to make those types of Wargaming-related
9996000	9998000	Videos, but, you know, they're really
9998000	10000000	Drawing the line about things like hate
10000000	10002000	Speech, homophobic slurs
10002000	10004000	Things like that, and the fact that he
10004000	10006000	Were, you know, cur-
10006000	10008000	Oh, I see, they were trying to curb their extremely
10008000	10010000	Profane language of a member
10010000	10012000	Of our contributor program
10012000	10014000	So, okay, so he used
10014000	10016000	Like, homophobic, so he used trash language
10016000	10018000	Basically
10018000	10020000	Okay, do you
10020000	10022000	Here's, this is important, do you know who uses
10022000	10024000	Trash language? Trash people
10024000	10026000	Okay, so
10026000	10028000	Look, here's the thing
10028000	10030000	He has a right to say all that shit
10030000	10032000	Fine, whatever, but I have a right
10032000	10034000	To fucking block his channel
10034000	10036000	And I'm not gonna be fucking watching it anytime soon
10036000	10038000	At the end of the day, though, I would say
10038000	10040000	In light of all that, I would still say
10040000	10042000	It's a little bit of an
10042000	10044000	Overreach on their
10044000	10046000	Part, but I do understand
10046000	10048000	It's DLC that's not out yet, so it's
10048000	10050000	Kinda like one of those, this
10050000	10052000	Gets into very slippery slopes, but this
10052000	10054000	Is for YouTube to work out
10054000	10056000	With a real fucking human being
10056000	10058000	That YouTube probably doesn't have staffed
10058000	10060000	Anyway, Zaku
10060000	10062000	Zaku, I gotta wrap up and let you go so we can get to other calls
10062000	10064000	But thank you, thank you
10064000	10066000	For that onion of a story, it was like every time we
10066000	10068000	Peeled back, there was another fucking lair
10068000	10070000	Alright, as the world turns
10070000	10072000	Alright, take care, Zaku
10072000	10074000	Bye, alright
10074000	10076000	It was good to hear from him, it's been a very long time since we've heard from Zaku
10076000	10078000	Let's see if there's any last minute stories
10078000	10080000	Real quick, and we'll probably wrap up soon
10080000	10082000	But I will take another shot for calls here
10082000	10084000	OrangeLawnsRadio on Skype
10100000	10102000	So they're not sure where that leaked from
10102000	10104000	But it doesn't have any subtitles or anything like that
10104000	10106000	It's all in Japanese, but
10106000	10108000	Check it out, if you're interested
10108000	10110000	Okay
10110000	10112000	I got one
10112000	10114000	Did you see, they've announced a
10114000	10116000	Switch package for Splatoon 2 that's in
10116000	10118000	Japan and Europe with different colored Joy-Cons
10118000	10120000	Oh yeah, because it was
10120000	10122000	All part of that, did they mention the
10122000	10124000	Arms director, I know there was the trailer
10124000	10126000	It was mentioned in something
10126000	10128000	But yes, I did see the additional colors
10128000	10130000	And I am really wanting that
10130000	10132000	And it hasn't been announced for North America
10132000	10134000	And I'm a little upset about that
10134000	10136000	Well, it's a good thing the Switch is region free, right?
10136000	10138000	Yeah, so that I can import a Switch's Joy-Cons
10138000	10140000	Yeah, it would be expensive
10140000	10142000	It's an expensive hobby
10142000	10144000	I just hope they announce it here
10144000	10146000	They probably, E3 is coming right around the corner, they might
10146000	10148000	But at the same time, it's like, oh god
10148000	10150000	I don't want to get into the territory of buying
10150000	10152000	$40 controllers just because they're in different colors
10152000	10154000	That's Shane's department, that's not something I want to do
10154000	10156000	That's why I'm waiting until they're in different colors
10156000	10158000	So they're $80
10158000	10160000	A set of two
10160000	10162000	So they're $40 each
10162000	10164000	Oh my god, no
10164000	10166000	And you thought the pro controller was bad at 70
10166000	10168000	No!
10168000	10170000	That HD rumble got paid that Nintendo price
10170000	10172000	I like the all grey
10172000	10174000	It matches
10174000	10176000	Look, I will admit when I saw the yellow ones
10176000	10178000	That they're doing for Arms, I was like, ooh those are pretty
10178000	10180000	But $80, nope
10180000	10182000	That just shut that off
10182000	10184000	That's fine
10184000	10186000	They're struggling color joy cons with specific games
10186000	10188000	Since they've announced that
10188000	10190000	Arms is the yellow, Splatoon is the green
10190000	10192000	And Fuchsia, what if they do that?
10194000	10196000	Well, do you remember those early rumors
10196000	10198000	About the Switch that there may actually be
10198000	10200000	Different types of joy cons
10200000	10202000	That go in the Switch
10202000	10204000	Do you remember some of those early rumors that there might be a GameCube controller
10204000	10206000	That they'll use for Smash Brothers?
10206000	10208000	That would be fucking interesting
10208000	10210000	Having played with the pro controller for a couple months now
10210000	10212000	I don't feel like I need
10212000	10214000	The GameCube controller for Smash
10214000	10216000	I know that
10216000	10218000	The Melee community is still going strong
10218000	10220000	There are going to be people who are going to stick to it
10220000	10222000	But I think for the majority of gamers
10222000	10224000	It's not like on the Wii
10224000	10226000	Where the classic controller
10226000	10228000	Didn't really feel the same
10228000	10230000	I think the pro controller can hold up
10230000	10232000	Alright, well you know what is getting kind of late
10232000	10234000	I'm sorry to those guys who didn't get through on our Skype line
10234000	10236000	But we're going to shut it down for the night
10236000	10238000	Just so we can wrap up
10238000	10240000	Because it's a little bit after 9 o'clock here
10240000	10242000	Thank you guys for listening to the show tonight

10256000	10258000	This is all about word of mouth

10260000	10262000	Or anything like that to promote the show
10262000	10264000	We do have a Twitch affiliate channel now
10264000	10266000	We're getting there, we're moving on up
10266000	10268000	Look out John's Arcade, I'm coming for your subs
10268000	10270000	Just kidding, alright
10270000	10272000	No, in all seriousness, indie stuff
10272000	10274000	No matter where it is
10274000	10276000	Really grows thanks to you guys
10276000	10278000	So, JD
10278000	10280000	Thanks for being here again tonight
10280000	10282000	Appreciate it, always nice to have you here
10282000	10284000	Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
10284000	10286000	All hail Orb
10286000	10288000	Alright, there you go
10288000	10290000	We'll move around the room here
10290000	10292000	Dark Soccer, do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
10292000	10294000	I want someone to buy me this camera
10294000	10296000	It's a Holga digital camera
10296000	10298000	It's like 40 bucks
10298000	10300000	Well, you need to start doing some streaming
10300000	10302000	And then when you get your biddies, you can buy the camera
10302000	10304000	I actually was planning on picking back up
10304000	10306000	On the Hot to Full Boyfriend stream
10306000	10308000	There you go
10308000	10310000	Cause I've got Holiday Star and the other ones
10310000	10312000	So, let me know on my Twitters
10312000	10314000	Aha, this will make me use my Twitter
10314000	10316000	You're gonna use Twitter?
10316000	10318000	I'm gonna use Twitter
10318000	10320000	You're gonna use my Twatter
10320000	10322000	Let me know if you want me to play more Hot to Full Boyfriend
10322000	10324000	I want you to play more Hot to Full Boyfriend
10324000	10326000	Yay, pigeon dating
10326000	10328000	My final thought is
10328000	10330000	Obviously I have to say something about
10330000	10332000	That my mom
10332000	10334000	Has not been doing too well this past week
10334000	10336000	And those of you that follow me on Twitter kinda know about that
10336000	10338000	And I just appreciate kinda having this show
10338000	10340000	As something to take my mind off it
10340000	10342000	For a little while, so thank you guys all for being here
10342000	10344000	I really, really appreciate it
10344000	10346000	And if you didn't see my latest tweet
10346000	10348000	I made about an hour ago, I did get a text from my sister
10348000	10350000	My mom is doing better
10350000	10352000	Things are hopefully improving
10352000	10354000	In that department, so thank you guys very much
10354000	10356000	Last but not least, Loki, your final thought?
10356000	10358000	So, one thing about this
10358000	10360000	You know, office space idle clicker game
10360000	10362000	Is they have this little event stuff that they do
10362000	10364000	Where you earn like these in-game currency type things
10364000	10366000	But
10366000	10368000	The in-game currency, each one of them gives you
10368000	10370000	A 10% bonus, but the bonuses
10370000	10372000	That you can also buy with that currency
10372000	10374000	Are actually less than if you just didn't spend them
10374000	10376000	Which doesn't make any goddamn sense
10376000	10378000	So who the fuck programmed this shit because they're a fucking idiot
10378000	10380000	That's all I have to say about that
10380000	10382000	It's a good thing Loki didn't have a YouTube channel
10382000	10384000	Alright
10384000	10386000	I do, I just don't post anything on it
10386000	10388000	There's a reason, alright, no I'm kidding
10388000	10390000	That's gonna do it guys, we will be back in 7 days
10390000	10392000	Yes, Memorial Day weekend, we will still be here
10392000	10394000	Nobody's going out of town, right?
10394000	10396000	I got Memorial Day off
10396000	10398000	Congrats!
10398000	10400000	You know what this means?
10400000	10402000	Vodka!
10402000	10404000	V-O-D-C-A-H
10404000	10406000	Responsible drinking

10408000	10410000	I still have
10410000	10412000	I still have like half the bottle of Stroopwafel
10412000	10414000	I was just about to ask
10414000	10416000	But I've been known to drink a drink or two
10416000	10418000	Alright, that's it, we're done
10418000	10420000	We're out of here, have a great night everybody
10420000	10422000	We will see you in 7 days, we may or may not
10422000	10424000	Be sober
