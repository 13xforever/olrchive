Orange Lounge Radio
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
This week I present to you the World Video Game Hall of Fame Class of 2017
Halo, Donkey Kong, Pokemon Red and Green, and Street Fighter 2
Join us for more news of the past revisited and future of gaming as it all starts right now in the show where every gamer has a voice
Orange Lounge Radio
Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice
It is Orange Lounge Radio
Live tonight, episode number 685 of our show for this May 7th of 2017
My name is Rob Roberts, you might follow me on Twitter at Skie
And I'm here with my co-host to talk to you about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle, and other stuff too
You know, tangents, 3 hour show, it happens
Say hello in studio to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers
Sup
Hi, how are you, Jamie?
I'm tired
Yeah, you said you were up late last night
I was up to like 4.30 in the morning
Bow chicka wow, no I'm just kidding
No
It's nothing like that
You were playing, playing
I wasn't playing anything
You were just
Watching random stuff on YouTube
Oh, okay, okay, you fell down one of those
I got caught in the trap and I was talking with my good friend and co-worker, James
Who is sometimes in the chat room and I hope soon tonight
Well, speaking of other stuff, this is really funny, some of our listeners will get a kick out of this
So, DarkSakura and I went to the same event last night in Sacramento
We didn't go together because we planned it completely separately with two different groups of people
But, so here's the thing, so DarkSakura and I went to see Bianca Del Rio
Which, if you follow Drag Race, which you may have caught that Jamie and I are a fan of
Loki, not so much
Oh, hi by the way, Techmaster Loki, how are you doing?
Fine
Alright, you just sit there for a minute because we're going to talk Drag Race for a moment
But not a super long time, I promise
But Bianca Del Rio is one of the stars of Drag Race, was the winner of season 6
So, but now, I mean honestly, I mean, however you feel about that show aside
I mean, she's really coming to her own as a stand-up comic who tours the country
And she's also known for being a very, how would you say it, like, unpolitically correct or off, you know
She's like Lisa Lampanelli except she's funny
Yes, she's Lisa Lampanelli but funny
But she's one of those like, there's like several disclaimers before you go to the show
Like, this is going to be offensive, you're going to be offended
So if you're here to like Tumblr police this show, get the f out
GTFO
Type of thing, yeah, basically
And don't bring your 9 month old baby
Although somebody did bring a baby
But we were just, ironically, we were both there
And I thought what was really funny, you were just sitting like two rows behind me
Yeah, Becky and I were like on G or something and y'all were like, what, on D?
Yeah, yeah, we were in D
We won the D
Yeah, we got the D at the Bianca Del Rio show
But I just thought it was funny, yeah, you went with Becky, who's one of your besties
And I went with my old co-worker
Because, you know, I changed jobs a couple years ago
But I still, there's, believe it or not, there's some people I like that I hang out with during the day
And so she was one of them
And so, you know, she and I used to talk every week about Drag Race
So I know she was really excited to go
Cool
Yeah, we had a good time
Yeah, it was good
And then there was Froyo and that was awesome
Yes, and then Dark Soccer and I went to Froyo
And that was, that was, that was our night
Good time, no gaming involved
Which is where we talked about going to coin op here locally
It was loud and
Well, okay, here's the thing about the local joint
And, you know, I'm obviously going to talk local for a minute here
But no matter where you guys are in the country
There's definitely been like a renaissance of classic coin op gaming
And I think most big cities at this point have a barcade of some sort at this point, right?
Where there's pinball machines and old arcade games plus alcohol
Which always makes for a good time, right?
So we have one in Sacramento and it's, it's a decent place
I'm glad it's here, I like it
But here's the weird thing about it for me
I don't, like there's just not a lot of stuff there
That I get really excited about
Because a lot of it is the really cliche classic gaming
Like a Ms. Pac-Man machine
It's like, it's like all the, like a Donkey Kong machine
No, it's got other things
There's a six player X-Men
Right, and I'm not, again, I don't want to knock this place
Because I want to support local business
There's a Golden Axe
I'm glad something like it exists
But I will say, I will give the place props for this
Their pinball game is on point
They have a lot of, like I play more pinball
One of Dan's buddies owns those
Oh okay, well yeah, when I go there I play more pinball
Then I'm giving your buddy money
Because when I go there I play more pinball than anything else in the joint
So, but I mean they have like the new shit
Like I played some Batman
There's some Batman, the 60's Batman
Yeah, that one's a new one
Back when it was awesome
There's, um
The TV show, and then there was like an Aerosmith one that was really new too
I think the ACDC was there before
And the same guy owns the Wizard of Oz
And he had that there until people kept breaking it
But there is, believe it or not, one of the SNK multi choice
And it's got a Blazing Star in it
Well that's cool
And that makes me super happy
Because what is my favorite shooter game next to R-Type?
Blazing Star
I would have thought it was a treasure game for sure
But that's alright
Well, alright
Let's see, Vidpower in chat says
Does being drunk make you lose even faster in old coin-op games?
Yes, it does
Sometimes it makes you better
Yeah
Because sometimes, you know what alcohol focus is?
Where you are just so blazed that you can like cut the rest of the universe out
Well blazed usually refers to something else
Well you know what I mean
I know what you mean
Blitzed I guess
Okay blitzed, yeah
Just so much on the sauce
That everything else falls behind you and you get hyper focused
Yeah, yeah, I've had those moments
That was the time I made it to like level fucking 29 on Luminess
While I was shit face drunk at my birthday
I think I did it on your PSP
I think you did
Yours or Wendell's
I think you did, yeah
At one of my birthday parties
But yeah, I mean, so we didn't end up going there
I mean, so I don't even know why I bring this up
But it's just one of those like, you know
It's cool that we have a place like that
But the magic's kind of worn off for me
But I do find, okay here's the thing though
I'm not, again, I'm really not trying to knock these places
I think it just depends on like what games and what presentation you have
Because I remember a place in Portland that I went to
Now granted, this was, this was when Alan and I were first dating
So it was like six years ago
So we went to Portland and we went to an arcade there
I had a lot of fun there
But that was like one of the first of those types of places that I went to
I didn't have anything in SAC or even the Bay Area at that time
Now San Francisco I think has a couple of these places too
There's one in the Castro, right?
Uh, I didn't see it in the Castro
There is, there is
It's on the edge of it
But it's, I can't remember the name of the place
JD's in chat, he'll know
Yes, Brucade, thank you
Okay, yeah, we didn't go there when I was there on Wednesday
It's not like near the theater
It's in a different, it's like down market a little further
Ohhhhh
It's closer to that music venue where we saw Frank music
And now I can't remember the name of it
It was like downstairs
Is it like just past the cafe?
The cafe?
It's past the cafe, yeah
Okay
Yeah
But now when I went we actually went to like a little Thai place
And then the GLBT museum was having a free day
So I went and kind of cried for a little bit
When I heard the Harvey Milk recording
The Living Will, the recorded Will
Oh
Because I had that as a recording there
I've never been there, I'd like to check that out
And then we went down to the mix, so
JD is in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com
Because hello, chat, we do tape live every Sunday night
At the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com
Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern
And JD in chat, who lives in San Francisco
That's why I knew he'd know this stuff
He says it's near Gateway
So, do you know, you know where that is, right?
Yeah, the gay jumbo's right next to it
Yes
So, alright, anyway
Yeah
Hurray, and all the people around the world
And other countries who are outside Northern California
Are like, wow, these places that I've never heard of
But again
Now you know
These barcades are showing up in a lot of different places
Let's see, in chat
I really liked round one, though
SSG100Matt says, when you come to New York, Rob
We can barcade Bar Hop
That would be awesome
I would really love to go, though, out there
I want to go to that Fun Spot place
Where all the, like, that's one of those
They don't have alcohol there, I don't think
But that's where, like, all the classic games are at
But I was looking, and it's kind of a hell of a deal
I don't think I could really get to Fun Spot when I'm out there
I am coming to New York this year, but I am going for a wedding
So, I can't do too much crazy stuff
Because the wedding's actually in Connecticut
But I'm trying to plan it where it's like
Well, maybe we'll have a fun day in New York
I feel like, if we're going to go to New York
Alan and I have to go to see something on Broadway
Like, how can you not?
But, I don't know, we'll see
We'll see
Let's see, going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com
Tigerclaw says
Wasn't Fun Spot the place where King of Kong was filmed?
Yeah, some of it
That's where most people know the place from
Fantaz in chat says
All the arcades closed down here in Canada
That's sad
Doesn't Canada like their arcades too?
Well, what part of Canada
I mean, Canada's a big place, yo
What part of Canada are you in?
Because I bet the big s-
I would be gasped, shocked
If, like, Toronto didn't have these things
But Toronto's one city in a big place
So, uh, you know
Let's see
Oh, Fantaz says I'm in Toronto
Wow, and they don't have-
There's gotta be something
I gotta ask my other buddies that live out there
If there's any place like that
There's gotta be something out there
Let's see
Shadeinator in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says
Rob, speaking of arcades
Do you remember an old mechanical game involving clay pigeons
Projected onto a screen and you shoot them with light guns that look like rifles
What was that called?
We had one at my arcade when I worked at the arcade
I remember that
Do you know how else I know that?
It was like clay shooting
I think it was just like clay pigeons or clay shooting
Yeah
Here, here's a tip for you
It's in the movie Karate Kid
Yeah
There's a montage
And they're at the arcade
And that is in the movie
Gotta have montage
That's right, there's a montage
So go watch
Karate Kid's gotta be on Netflix or something, right?
Go watch it
And pause right there on that sequence
So there it is
And JD found it, Clay Pigeon is the name of it
Yeah, we used to have all like the
Okay, I lived in Alabama, they were the dirty rednecks
You know, wearing wife beaters
Stereotypes
Wife beaters and jeans and boots
I'm not even joking because the stereotype exists for a reason
Okay, we come in and like just be loud and raucous
And play the stupid gun game
And then leave it a mess
Let's see, going to a chat
Bobby Blackwolf using good old Yelp found 10 arcades in Toronto
That doesn't mean there are going to be 10 good arcades
But it sounds like there's some to choose from there
Yelp was a good idea though to find stuff there
As studio 100 Matt suggests, you might have to go to Niagara Falls or something
Yeah, I wonder if those arcades
I'm not looking at the link right now
But I wonder if those arcades aren't like bowling alleys
But sometimes bowling alleys can have good arcades
You just have to experiment a little bit and look around
So, we'll see, we'll see
Alright, anyhow, let's see
Loki, how are you doing? I haven't heard a lot from you tonight
Have you been?
I'm fine
Yeah?
Any progress on your new project, your authoring project this week
Or whatever it is you're working on?
I think I'm working on a new game
Oh yeah, I guess
Maybe you're not if you don't know what the fun is
No, I haven't made that much progress on it
In fact, actually, I was working on it last night
I literally fell asleep while working on it and woke up later on
I'm like, oh crap
So, no, I haven't made a ton of progress on it yet
It's still design phase, I guess
How about 3D printing?
I didn't really work on the 3D printing too much
I did install the fan shroud I printed last week on it
And I just need to solder the fan
I need to extend the cords on it so that they can reach the board on the actual printer
So they can control the fan
So I started doing that last night
And then I haven't really bothered to print anything else yet
Because I needed to get that done so I can reinstall the auto level on there
And then redo that because it's all jacked up
Since I tore a hole in the top of my build plate
Or the little cup
There's like this surface that's on top of the aluminum plate
So I tore a hole in that surface that's on there and covered it up with tape
And it works okay, I guess
But I really do need to replace it with some tempered glass or something
I just haven't gotten around to buying a piece of tempered glass to put on there
But soon, I mean, I still have been like
When are you printing my mini me?
Your mini you?
My mini me. Remember we were going to make an action figure of Rob Roberts
That came up on a previous OR
But I have to get a 3D model of you first
If I must
Alright
I did find, now this was cool
We're sending you 3D printers
There's instructions on how to take your model out of World of Warcraft
Oh cool
And import it into a 3D printer
And it requires some tweaking to it
Because you have to change the type of polygon
But they did really realistic, like someone did a full on Lich King
It was pretty cool
I remember back when we were doing Horde House
There was a service that came up on the show
Where they would like print, they would make statues
They still have that
Yeah, so I'm not too surprised the technology's out there
But now it's probably more easier for you and I to get access to the 3D models
To do that kind of stuff, so yeah, pretty cool
Anyhow, it's a bit of a slower news week this week
We will get into the video game news and what's been going on here in a minute
After we do our gaming weeks
But obviously it's a little slower in the news cycle right now
We're less than a month away from E3
No, we're a month away from E3 at this point
When does it all start? June 9th?
June 10th
First press conferences are June 10th
It's like Saturday this year is when E3 starts
Yeah, there's EAs on Saturday
Microsoft and Bethesda on Sunday
Sony is at their usual time on Monday
Ubisoft and Nintendo are assumed to be Monday as well
But who knows
We're gonna have a crazy June
Between the 15 years of OLR
And the E3 and all that stuff
It's gonna be a crazy June
Isn't that the week that we're out to?
It's gonna be June 11th
June 11th is E3
June 18th is our 15th anniversary show
June 25th is we're giving ourselves a week off
As a reward for doing the show for 15 years
Got it
Because I'm going to Chicago
There it is
So that's our June
It's gonna be a little bit crazy
Speaking of 15 years
I wanna make sure I got this out at some point during the show
Because obviously we're coming up on the big 15
If you didn't already know, Orange Launch Radio started
Actually, technically as a station
It started in May of 2002
So we're in the 15 years right now
As a station we started in 2002
Because originally we were a station on the Live 365 service
Which is no longer around
But that was where you could set up your own music thing
And we had DDR music and DanceMania soundtrack stuff
To differentiate ourselves from DDR Freak Radio
Which was also started around the same time
But then the idea was that the centerpiece of Orange Launch Radio
The network was Orange Launch Radio Live
The show
Which is this now, 15 years later
Now that podcasting is a thing
Now that Live 365 is gone
And we moved to all games
Moved to VOG Network and all that
But, you know, 2002
When this show started
Was really kind of like a peak of music gaming in a way
Like I know, I know
There was other peaks obviously as well
Rock band, Guitar Hero 2 and all that stuff that came later
But the reason why I say that is that I came across
Something today that mentioned that
In the music gaming world
A website turned 15 years old this month as well
Bamani style turned 15 this month
And, you know, we've had Eddie who started it
He was on the show probably a long time ago talking about it
I think he was here around the time they did a big relaunch
I think he was here
But I was, you know, reading up on the site
And I was just going like, wow, memories
This has been 15 years
It's been a long time since some of this stuff
And just, yeah
So I just wanted to acknowledge their anniversary as well
Give them props
I know they've kind of
They've gone through their own transformations
It used to be a place where people would look at like sim files
Like that was their big thing
And now they're, you know, they can't really do that anymore
So they have more like, you know, what's going on in music gaming news and so forth
So we've transformed
They've transformed
You know, you don't usually go 15 years
Being the exact same thing you were in the beginning
So, you know, just props to them
And we're all getting old
Crazy stuff
Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com
SSU100Matt says, shit, I feel old
I remember checking Bamante's style every day
Well, you could be doing that right now
They are still around
They're celebrating a birthday
So they're still doing their thing
It's just different than what it was in the beginning
You know, so
They just do a lot more news about, you know, the newer music games
Because there's still a lot
I'm gonna talk about my gaming week here in a moment
I've been playing some new music games
And I was kind of shocked
What I found here locally
So I'm gonna talk about that in just a minute
When we get to our gaming weeks
vidpower points out ddrfreak for ddr forums
Bamante's style for all other
Bamante game forums
Yeah, for sure
Totally
So, yeah
Congrats and happy anniversary to Bamante's style
So
One thing I wanted to ask about here at the top of the show
Before we get into our gaming weeks
What we have been playing this week
I just wanna ask you guys a little bit about
What haven't you been playing this week
Because, again, it's a slower time of year
There hasn't been as many game releases
I know we have Mario Kart 8, we've had a few big ones
But, um, what's your backlog
In gaming look like right now
What are the games you need to make it a point
To finish
Before things get crazy
Come September, October, November
What are, like, the biggest priorities
You're laughing at me, Loki
The joke is obvious
Your backlog is like 500 games
I'm sure
What are the biggest things
You're like, I need to get this done before
Even more shit comes out
To pile up the backlog
Since I'm just gonna steal the joke right here
The obvious answer would be my game
Okay, fair enough
I wasn't even coming for you
With that question
Okay, sure, fair enough
God, there's so many things
I have, I mean, even just strictly
PlayStation
I have a finished
Watch Dogs 2, Final Fantasy
15, um
Hell, there's so many games
I haven't even started yet that I have
Like Dragon Age Inquisition
Both Wolfenstein games
Crap, I don't know, there's like a ton of games
I have the original Watch Dogs 2 that I've never
Played, it's on a disc and never played
I have Destiny that I've never touched
How do you pick what you're gonna do first?
I usually
Buy something new
So in other words
You're full on admitting these games are never
Gonna get touched because I'm gonna end up buying something new
And it's just added to the mountain of games
Pretty much, yeah, I mean
There's uh
I don't know
There's a lot of stuff
My PlayStation 4 backlog is starting to
Look as bad as my
Steam backlog
DarkSakura, what about you?
I don't know if it's fair to say you're a little more
Pinky-choosey when it comes to games, but
Is your backlog as horrific as Loki's?
Danganronpa 2
I thought you already beat that
No, I'm almost done with it, but I put it off
To play other things
I still want to finish Ultra Despair Girls
They've just been on the back burner since
I was playing a couple other things
And right now
I'm playing stuff, but kind of taking a bit of a break
Just for
No mental recharge, I've got
A few other projects that have fallen on the side
That have fallen
On the side
Sorry, my voice went out
That's okay, it went into 911 operator
It went into 900 number operator mode for a minute there
Pick up the phone
Let's look at chat
Over at live.vognetwork.com
I'd like to hear from you guys as well
Stoppy says still haven't played through Hitman
Ugh, Lady JJ says
Tomb Raider Anthology on Mac
Rise of the Tomb Raider is still in my backlog
So that's a big one actually
Uh, Lissy Darktitsia says
I was in the middle of Jet Set Radio and Nights
On Steam
Stoppy says Mad Max I have for PS4
And I haven't touched it in months
Oh, Grand Theft Auto 5
There's another one on Grand Theft Auto Online
In my backlog Grand Theft Auto 5 for sure
Yeah, and Fallout 4
Well, at least I played a little bit of Fallout 4
Fallout 4 would also be in mine too
Because I never finished that
Yeah, no, I need to finish it
But, uh, yeah, I'm just, I'm horrible
At the Fallout games
But, yeah, I need to play that
But Grand Theft Auto 5 is definitely still there
Uh, yeah
Actdeftinchat says still haven't played Forza Horizon 3
Yes, we heard a little bit about that on Bobby's show tonight
But yes, Forza is in my backlog too
Uh, other big stuff in my backlog
Um, Zelda Breath of the Wild
I need to finish
I need to finish that, like, I was really into it
And then I, I
I don't know what happened, I felt like I was doing something wrong
But I really need to realize
In that game you can't do things wrong
Like, you can do whatever you want when you want
And I just have to get my mind out of that place
And I'll be able to go back and do it
Um, here's one that might kind of surprise you guys
Uh, Mass Effect Andromeda is in my backlog right now
I kind of stopped playing it
Um, when a lot of the talk about patching and changes and all that stuff was going on
I kind of painted myself in a corner in that game too
Because I felt like I screwed myself
And I'm not able to do the loyalty missions
Even though I'm close to the end of the game
So in my mind, whether this is logical or not
This is where my mind's going
My mind says the only way to fix this, Rob, is to start all over
And then couple that with
I had a really bad multiplayer experience
Because of fucking Origin
Where we got kicked from a match like seconds before the end of the match
And we'd used consumables and all this stuff too
Like, I got really frustrated
I was just like, fuck this game
And I just, I kind of walked away from it for a little while
And in reality, I still think Mass Effect Andromeda is a great game
And I need to just get over that kind of mental hump and go finish it
But then, you know, I get sucked into a good old thing like 14
Or Diablo 3 now
I've been actively trying to hunt down this platinum trophy
And it's like, that's great
But it's keeping me from playing all of these other games
So my backlog over there is just growing as well
What can I say? Let's see
VidPowerInChat over at live.vognetwork.com says
Pro tip, treat your backlog as more of an all-you-can-play buffet
Instead of a checklist
It's way less stressful this way
I like that, an all-you-can-play buffet
That's what PlayStation Now should be trying to brand its service as
Well I keep wanting to play Minecraft on my laptop
But apparently something corrupted my profile
And so it doesn't authenticate with Microsoft servers or something stupid like that
So I haven't purchased, technically twice, thank you Microsoft
And I can't download it
Because they're stupid
Alright, enough about backlogs
Let's talk about the current stuff
The types of video games that you've been playing this week
What have you been playing in a segment?
How was your gaming week?
Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?
Like I was saying, it hasn't been super eventful
But I've been playing some World of Warcraft and Mass Effect Andromeda
Not really too many other things
Except we did, well Dan actually repaired my old ColecoVision
And so there was some Mr. Do happening in Donkey Kong
Mr. Do is an underrated 80s classic
Fucking love Mr. Do
Yeah Mr. Do is a fucking rad game
It's like Dig Dug but not
And people don't seem to realize just how good the ColecoVision was for its time
It was kind of a powerhouse for itself
And you had really some of the best arcade versions at home
Short of having it on the computer versions
So it was really, except the controller is kind of shit
Man, is there a way to play Mr. Do legally on a modern console?
Like was it in any of those arcade repackaging things?
I don't think so
That's a classic I'd like to play again
But anyway, sorry Dark Soccer but I couldn't help but wonder that
Well and then of course Pokemon Go and Miitomo
Which actually I forgot to try today
So that's what I'm playing
For now
Awesome, we'll get to Loki in a minute
Oh is that that arcade Internet Archives thing?
Yeah it is, the latest thing they had in there
It was on the Wii Virtual Console in Japan
Why did Japan get all the good stuff?
Oh I forgot there was a Neo Geo version at one point too
There's Neo Mr. Do
Yes there is
That is kind of a different game though if you think about it
It is, it looks absolutely different
So wow, they didn't put it in any of those like the arcade classic
Yeah I guess not, interesting alright
Random 80s arcade game that I want to play again
Anyway, how about you Loki?
I didn't play a whole lot
It's just pretty much what's on my phone
Because I've been purposely avoiding playing games on consoles and stuff
Because I wanted to work on my games
Sort of happened and sorted it
I was just really tired this week
So like every time I sat down to work on it
You have to have more mental capacity than I had at the time
To actually be able to program stuff
So it was kind of annoying
But I did play more of that Office Space idle clicker game thing
Which is actually, it's kind of
It's entertaining because they do these like weekly challenge things
So it kind of mixes up the game almost every week
And so you can play that on top of your normal game as well
And it unlocks more of the consumable things that they have in the game
So you don't really have to spend real money on it
To kind of earn those things
And I kind of like that because it gives me a point to play it
Because there's actually a little bit of a challenge to try to unlock those things
So I don't find it as kind of like throwing the ads or consumables in your face
As much as some of the other games did
I mean they still have you watch a lot of ads
But usually it's just kind of whatever
Although there is an ad on there
Which I might mention
For like some mobile game that has like Pokemon in it and stuff
It's not Pokemon Go
It's like something I'm like
How is this not violating like IP left and fucking right
And they're advertising it in another game
It's not the official match 3 game that Pokemon has
Pokemon
I forget the name of it
There's another Pokemon game
It's not from like Nintendo or from the Pokemon company or something
It's from some other company I've never heard of
Thank you guys, Pokemon Shuffle says chat
No it's not Pokemon Shuffle at all
It's like some other thing
And it's like the actual title of the game
It sounds like a knock off
So I'm like
How the fuck
Like how fucking ballsy must you be
To literally advertise this game
With like violating copyright all over the place
In another game
I mean on Google services
Come on Google like wake up
So that was kind of interesting
And then the other thing I play of course is Pokemon Go
A little bit because they're doing that whole grass type event or whatever
So I've been trying to level up my grass type Pokemon
Shit I don't fucking see Bulbasaur anywhere normally
And now he's just like fucking all over the place
Like I literally was walking through
I haven't seen a one
A Bulbasaur
I'm seeing more
They're all over the place
Like I caught like 5 the other edges of the outlets
Just like in like 5 minutes
I'm seeing more Chikorita than I am Bulbasaur
Yeah
Myself
Yeah
But yeah that's what I've been doing
So just a little bit of that
I mean it's entertaining enough
I don't really
Like I'm not going hardcore into the game
I just more of like play it once a day
You know to get my daily stuff
And then that's it
But yeah I mean
I don't know
I look at games kind of
It's entertaining for what it is
I mean that's fine
I'm enjoying it
Not being sucked in like
I've got to play it like the other ones
It's more of like
Okay I got like 5 minutes
Let me just do this real quick
And then that's that
Yeah I mean
You know I've been playing Ingress myself this week
Which I know is the other game you're referring to
But I've tried to take a little bit more
Relaxed approach to Ingress
Turning off notifications
And that game was the best thing I could do
Possibly for just my own like
Just not getting so sucked into it or whatever
But you know funny enough
They're doing an event in Pokemon Go
But they're also doing one in Ingress right now
They just started
So it's like Niantic
Didn't really think this through for their servers
Because like the Ingress ones have been hurting
Like the game's been running really slow
Like when you try to deploy resonators
Like it's slow because the event is about
Deploying resonators
And they have a big
They have a special badge in the game right now
For resonator deploys
So it was funny to me that Niantic's running
Two different events at the same time
Now granted I'm sure the Pokemon Go and Ingress
Run on completely different servers and stuff
But still, still like it just seems like
Wow there's a lot happening right now
So anyway
Yeah
Okay so my gaming week since I started there
Let me talk about some other stuff
Okay so I didn't talk about this last week
I wanted to talk about this game last week
But we were a little pressed for time last week
Because we had an interview which was awesome
But I had to kind of roll this talk to this week
So there's a newer game out on PlayStation 4
That I played and I beat in the past week
Because this is one of those games
That's only gonna take you about three hours to beat
But it was a great three hours
The game is called What Remains of Edith Finch
So this is one of those walking simulator games
Although you know I hate that label
But everybody knows what I'm talking about
When I say that
I say more interactive story is what it really is
But if you haven't read much about it
It's basically about a girl that returns to a house in her family
And as she goes through the house she kind of learns the secrets
Or the stories about her family
And we'll leave it at that because I want to keep it relatively spoiler free
So like Gone Home it sounds like?
Not at all
Well no the story is nothing like Gone Home actually
The story is nothing like it
But the gameplay is a little bit like it
But here's the thing about Edith Finch
And again I'm really trying to keep this very spoiler free
There are sections of Edith Finch
Where I feel like there was more game to it
Like there was like a segment where you had to
Catch two things
Or you have to like go through the sequence again
So there were some more like arcadey type of sequences in it
Where you know Gone Home didn't really have any of that
So I do feel like even though
A lot of people are gonna write this game off as
Oh it's another one of those
There's no fucking game here
You just watch a story unfold in front of you
I do feel like Edith Finch is taking another step forward
In the genre to try to bring
Walking simulators and interactive stories
Forward a little more into
You know being the types of video games that
You know a lot of people think of when they think of video games
But I will say this as well
The story was very affecting
And there was some
There was some quite frankly like
Disturbing and difficult sequences to watch in the game
And again I'm trying to keep it spoiler free but there's just you know
There's some heavy stuff in the game
And so I kind of wasn't prepared for it
Like there was definitely a sequence
That like once it was over
And if you guys have played through the game
You're gonna know exactly what I'm fucking talking about
But I will say it is the
The
How do I say this without fucking ruining it
The bathtub sequence I'll leave it at that
So after that I had to just fucking like
I need a break
I need a break that was heavy
But the fact that a video game can kind of affect you like that
I think is you know says a lot about the game as well
And I did you know I was
I was satisfied with the resolution of the story
It has kind of a weird ending
And I will say that I saw the ending coming
About halfway through the game
But I was still okay with the journey to get there
So that's what I
Yeah that's what I liked
I overall it was you know a great experience
I really like these types of games
Especially you know as maybe I don't have the attention span
For video games that I used to
I really like these games that I can kind of like start and beat within a day
And I feel like it's really fulfilling
I think the trickiest part about this game
Is going to be that $20 price tag
After I just told you you're gonna beat it in three hours
And although you can replay sequences
I'm not sure there's a ton of replayability in a game like this
I mean maybe if you were into speed running it or something
There might be a little more in it for you
But I really think this is kind of a one and done type of video game
And so the $20 price tag may be a tough sell
Now that being said
Some of y'all have no problem
Buying a movie for 25, 30 bucks on blu-ray
Watching it one time and then putting it in your shelf somewhere
So on one hand
I kind of don't understand why people get really frustrated
With the price tags on video games
When it's really no different when it comes to movies
But on the other hand
Sure I mean there's so much variance when it comes to video game prices
That there are other games you could be spending $5, $10 on
That will give you hours and hours of enjoyment
It might be tough to convince you that $20 is worth it for three hours of this
That being said there probably will be a sale at some point
So maybe some of y'all will just hold out for the sale
But I think the game is definitely worth your time
And it was a story I enjoyed going through
Let's see go into our chat over at live.vognetwork.com
Rama in chat says beat in three hours
What about Final Fantasy Mystic Quest?
I don't remember that game taking only three hours
But the last time I played it I was like 12 or 13
So Dark Soccer do you remember how long was Mystic Quest of a game?
It's got to be more than three hours
It wasn't that long though
No it wasn't like a typical Final Fantasy
It wasn't really a Final Fantasy game
It really wasn't
It was Final Fantasy USA is what they released it as over series
Yeah I don't remember offhand what the original was
I'd have to look back up
But it was definitely RPG for small children
One other quick thing I want to say about Edith Finch
Is that I really loved some of the style that some of the stories were told through
Like Jamie I really think this might be a game you'd be into for some of the style
Some of that
I think some of the artistic direction in the game I think you'd be a big fan of
So it might be you know again it's 20 bucks
But when there's a sale or something you know I think it's worth
I don't know if it's on PC
I think it is
I don't think it's on Xbox it's only on PlayStation
But I think I heard it was on PC as well
Maybe somebody in our chat knows over at live.vognetwork.com
Bobby Blackwolf says Mystic Quest is a 12 to 15 hour game
Yeah I was going to guess it was more like 10
So yeah 12 to 15 sounds a little more right
Act Def points out I paid 40 dollars for Portal because of the orange box
And I can beat that game in an hour
I think Portal has a lot of replayability value to it though
At least I think so
You would agree with that though right Dark Soccer
That Portal has a lot of replayability to it
I mean yes
You know the answers to the puzzles and everything
But it's also one of those games where there's kind of more than one way to do it
Yeah
And you know just the story is really good in that game too
And there's also finding the secrets
Yes that's true
And in Portal 2 there's certainly a lot more
That's true
Alright so other games I've been playing this week
I've been playing a little bit of Heroes of the Storm
Which is Blizzard's Dota-esque or League of Legends-esque type of game
And obviously the reason I've been playing it if you follow Blizzard games at all
You can get Overwatch stuff right now by playing Heroes of the Storm
So there's a little group of us people that you sometimes hear on OLR
Like myself, Shane, Flaco Jones
And we've been playing Heroes of the Storm because if you play with friends
You unlock things in Overwatch
So the first week you just played five matches with a friend
And you got like a new Genji skin that was really cool
And you got some unlocks
And that was really easy because we just played against AI
And it was okay cool we did this
Well Blizzard said for weeks two, three, and four
You can no longer play against AI
You have to play against real people
And we were like ugh
The people in this game can be so toxic
But whatever we're just gonna suck it up and play
So we did
And actually we won
Like Shane and I played our last two games
Or my last two games last night
And we won both games
So I was like woohoo we can actually do this
But I think it's because there's a lot of other people who don't play Heroes of the Storm a lot
That are playing now to get the unlocks
So you kind of have like a lot of baddies playing the game right now
I do wish they didn't force you to play against other people though
Because I've also seen the side of this where
People are just teaming up in groups of five
And then letting the other team win
Like they're just we're just gonna hang at base
And you guys can just steamroll
We just won our D.Va skin
Because they have the whole South Korean police officer garb thing that D.Va can get
And her mech has a police siren on it and all this stuff
It's cute and if you're a D.Va player
Which you know she's awesome in Overwatch
You want this skin
So a lot of people play for that
And then week four is gonna be ten loot boxes
So I do kind of wish they would just let people get it from AI matches
Because you're gonna end up playing the game either way
So you're downloading it and you get those play stats on Blizzard
Which is what they want to go for
But you're not like forced to play with other people
And I just
You know I don't have a problem doing it
I'm not afraid of other people
Like you know oh darn we lost a match
I don't give a fuck we still get our skin
And if somebody is abusive to me
Blocked like it's not that hard
Blocked reported easy to do
And I have like low tolerance for that shit in those games
Like if somebody says something nasty
Blocked I just don't even acknowledge it or anything
I just block them
But I just
Let the nasty people all play their game together or whatever
And just let the people who want to steamroll for the skin just play AI or something
I don't know
Make them do AI on medium mode or something
I don't know what it is
Yeah actdeftinchat says good thing you only have to play not win
I really hope weeks 3 and 4
Blizzard's solution for this better not be
You have to win the matches now in order to get it
Because
That's just gonna be a fucking mess
People will figure out how to win trade
Mark my words
They're gonna win trade
And it's just gonna be bad for the Heroes of the Storm community if they do that
So I really hope they don't do that
And one other thing I want to talk about
So
Yesterday my pal Shane and I went to an arcade here in the area
It was the bowling alley out in Rockland
You guys know that place?
So that place has an arcade machine called Neon FM
Which speaking of this show being 15 years old
And Mamani style being 15 years old
I feel like development on that game started 15 years ago
Because I remember when that was gonna be a dance game
Remember that?
But the controller looked like Beatmania
But it was a dance pad
Girls Butts
Yes and there was the infamous Girls Butts song
Which is still there
And I refuse to play it
Because it's banned from my life
But that song aside
There's a lot of great songs in the game
There really are
If you're okay with Sir Mix-A-Lot singing about girls butts
It is different Loki
It is different and you know it
Anyway
So here's the thing
Neon FM is an iOS slash Android game now
So you can download that on your phone
And I played the machine before
They had it at MAGFest
So seeing the machine was not new
But what we saw in the app
Is that they actually have a list of arcades nearby
That have the actual Neon FM game
And that's how we saw
Oh they have one out in Rockland
We should go fucking play Neon FM in the arcade
And because at MAGFest
As fun as MAGFest is
I couldn't hear that fucking game
For shit at MAGFest
Because MAGFest is so loud
But we went to the arcade yesterday morning
Well morning-ish like noon
Which on a weekend is morning
So we went over there
And there wasn't really anybody there
We were like the only ones in the arcade
Maybe some kids playing some Ticket Spitter games
That was really it
And us we were playing Neon FM
So we were able to play it loud
And that was cool
Because we could actually like hear the songs
And I gotta say
You know that game was a lot of fun to play
Like obviously now it's a little more pop and music
It's probably the closest like Bimani game
But it does different things
Like I don't want to say it's a clone
It's not
Because I like that the grid
Where the notes fall
Will do different things
Based on the song
Like I was playing a chiptune sounding song
And all of a sudden
The grid turned into 8-bit looking notes
At one part of the song
And then there was another song
Where like the colors change
And all this stuff
So I thought that part was kind of cool
And what I thought they did
That was pretty neat
Is that they've really embraced
And I know we've brought this up on OLR before
But they've really embraced this whole fact
That you can log into the machine
Using your smartphone
So you scan a QR code on the machine
As you're picking your song
And they don't have time limits
When you pick your song
Thank god
You can just sit there and pick your song
However long it's gonna take
Once you pick your song
You only have 30 seconds to pick the difficulty
But you pick your song or whatever
So you can scan the QR code
You log into the machine
And then it knows it's you
And so it's linked to whatever you're playing
On your phone
And so you're building like one profile
Or whatever
So I thought that part was really cool
And you know the points that you earn and stuff
Can go for the in-game currency
That you use to play licensed music
In the phone version
So I thought that was really cool
And you can do multiplayer
Across iPhone and the arcade machine
And that's what the 30 seconds is for
Is that for those 30 seconds
Other players can join you
Unless you skip that out
But
Excuse me
But what we were able to do
We had Shane was playing the machine
He logged in
He picked his song
And as he was picking his song
I went on my phone
And I picked the same song
And so I hit start now
Because he picked a licensed song
I had to spend one of my in-game currency to do it
But it was fine
So as he was playing
I was able to play the exact same song
Behind him on my phone
And we were competing against each other basically
I lost big time
Because I'm sorry
You can't tap on your phone
The same way you can smack those big buttons
But I thought that was really fucking cool
That you could play the same music game
That the person is playing on the arcade
But you're doing it on your account
But you're playing
I just thought that was really cool
It reminded me of back in the day
When Para Para was a big music game
That everybody played
That people would mimic the dances
Behind the person that was actually doing the dancing
It kind of reminded me of that
So
Loki, if you haven't checked out Neon FM
I think that would be amazing to kick out of
Yeah
So
So
Yeah
ActDeftInChat says
That sounds pretty awesome
Yeah
It was neat to play through that
DrTouya says
I've done that
Played people in the arcade version on my phone
While I'm at home
Yeah
You can do that
So that's Neon FM's big selling point
So congrats to those guys
For finally getting their game out
All these years later
And
I would say it paid off
Because
I don't feel like I'm playing a 15 year old game
They've put a very new modern spin on it
With this whole linking the phones
To the arcade machine
So
Good job on you
Except
That girl's butt song is fucking terrible
And should be deleted from the game
That's the only read I'm going to give on that game
Otherwise
Neon FM did a good job
And there are a lot of great songs on it
There really are
Is girl's butts also in the
Or the mole version
The song list match
At least as far as I've seen
The exact same songs
Because it makes sense
Yeah
Yeah exactly
I mean there's still some unlocks
And they
They actually
Like when you play enough songs
It actually says
Coming on June 2nd
This song
Coming on June 19th
This song
So they're
I think that's kind of neat
So
Anyway
So yeah
I would give a shout out
For Neon FM
And check that out on your mobile devices
If you haven't already
But while I was at the arcade
I had no idea that this arcade
Was growing in music games
Because they had
We looked over and we were like
Oh it's a DDR Supernova
Whatever
And then when we give it a second look
We were like
Wait a minute
That's not Supernova
That's DDR
Whatever
Not Ace
2016
2016 or 15
Or whatever was before Ace
Is that the one that was like
Cross second mix or something like that?
No
It was after that before Ace
There was just
It was the DDR reboot
It was that game
So we were like
Oh they just put that in a Supernova cabinet
And then there was the brand new pump game
That like just came
Shane was like
Oh my gosh
It's the new pump game
He's a big fan of pump
He's like wow
This like just came out
And they have it here
That's crazy
But then here's the other thing
That caught our eye
And I was like
I thought this game never happened
They had an in the groove 3 cabinet
And I was like
Wait a minute
Because it didn't happen
In the groove 3 didn't fucking happen
Because Konami
That is a custom cabinet
That is a hell of a fucking custom cabinet
Because it has the signage
It has
It definitely has in the groove dance pads on it
That's running straight up step mania
And yeah it had 12,000 songs loaded on it
And no shit it's running step mania
Because I was like
Okay whatever
It's in the groove
I'm here to play Neon FM
And no shade against in the groove
And DDR and all that stuff
But the reality is
I'm 38 years old and I'm out of shape
I'm not gonna fucking dance in a public place
Because I can't do it like I used to
I can't do it like I used to
Neon FM is fine
That's a lot of songs to sort through
But then
So yeah I just was like
Okay whatever
Cool they have it
You know we were kind of like
Just didn't pay it a second mind
But then as we were playing Neon FM
Some other guy got up there
We kind of looked over
And I was like
Wait a minute
There's nothing but fucking DDR songs on it
I mean I just saw
1-2 Little Bitch
0-0-0-7
Like all the songs
That would be in a DDR fourth mix plus
And I was like
The fuck
And we kind of give it a second look
And we're like
Oh my god
This thing is like
This in the groove three
And then like Shane and I
Started to piece it together
We were like
Wait a minute
Wasn't in the groove three
The one where they kind of gave
That final F you to Konami
Right as they were getting sued
Where they opened up the USB stick
So you could load anything on it
Right
Nah it's just a step mini machine
Wow
That's all it is
So
I did not know those machines actually existed
And now that I've talked about it
Openly on a podcast
That many
Not many people
But some people listen to
Including some of the industry
Maybe that machine won't be there much longer
I don't know
Yeah they could get in pretty big trouble for
Don't
You guys don't
No
To those listening
Don't shut it down
Come on
It's not hurting anybody being there
You know what it's doing
It's reminding people
Of the glory days of 15 years ago
Just let it be
It's not fucking
Hurting sales of anything
So just like
Yeah because Rockstar can't sue
Because Rockstar's not there anymore
Konami might sue but you know
Let in the groove three be
Let it be at peace
Maybe
I don't
So that was weird
There must be something going on there
I fully expect
That we're gonna see
Kyle's new game
StepMania X
Or whatever
StepMania X
I fully expect that thing
Is gonna end up
At the same place
That's actually out in the wild
Because
Just based on the music games
I'm seeing there
I'm like
Okay
How weird to go to this arcade
And like the vast majority of it
Is ticket spitters
When we walked in there
We were like
Oh
That thing was a lie
There's not gonna be a fucking
Neon FM here
There's nothing but ticket spitters here
But in the back corner
It was like
Oh all these fucking music games
Right next to each other
There's room for more
Yes
Secret Club says
Act Deaf
Yes that's very true
Act Deaf says
This week's secret club
Is that
In the Groove StepMania machine
Very true
Very true
Alright
Orange Right says
I remember playing two of them in Reno
Not an ITG themed one
Two StepMania machines
You know
Maybe the software in it
Wasn't in the Groove 3
Maybe it was like that
DDR
You know
Cause I didn't take a second look
Maybe you're right
Maybe it wasn't really in the Groove 3
It just had the signage for it
It was just fucking
StepMania in a cabinet
It is StepMania in a cabinet
They have an In the Groove 3 theme
Now there's been some pretty awesome
Like In the Groove 3 skins
That people have done
Or like actual cabinets that people have made
I even went on to Wikipedia
Now here's it
For you Wikipedia folks
K
It says on Wikipedia
In the Groove 3 was cancelled
Due to such and such and such
It says it right there on Wikipedia
Bitch I just saw one
It was not
It happened
It happened
It happened somehow
But it's apparently this giant secret
Those pics didn't happen
You have to know
I fucking posted a picture on Twitter
Source that bitch
It happened
I would source my fucking Twitter
On Wikipedia
Do it
Anyway
D'Artesia says
I think In the Groove 3 was a fan thing
Maybe I don't know
I'm just saying
It was a convincing fucking cabinet
I you know I
It's not like
Kyle's a busy guy
But I'm sure he would answer an email
If I sent him a picture
And I'd be like
Explain this
Of course I don't want the response to be
Where was that
Anyway alright
That looks like a
Isn't that a solo machine cabinet
No that's not a solo machine
No the floor was In the Groove
I reckon
The floor
It's probably just an In the Groove machine
That they put new
It was a widescreen thing
It was not In the Groove
Fucking win in DDR cabinets
Okay
It's a custom cabinet
That someone made
Anyway
It's probably custom
Alright
I could just see the source on Wikipedia right now
Episode 685 Orange Lounge Radio
Bitch I'm looking right at one
I just like
I love the
Wait In the Groove 3 happened?
The emoji's like
Wait a second
Let me think about this
That's cause that's what I thought
I was like wait a minute
I'm confused
Wikipedia told me it was cancelled
I'm looking right at it
TigerClodChat says
Sounds like In the Groove 3 is this year's polybus
Possibly
Act Def says
Looking at the photo it kind of looks like a pump it up machine
Okay
Wasn't there a pump it up
That was In the Groove infused
And it was four panel
Not five
Or am I crazy
I
Okay I realized that the steps
You can't see in the picture
I didn't
I should have thought to include the whole fucking thing
But the steps
Were an In the Groove dance thing
Because it was like those orange blue arrows
That you see in In the Groove
So that's what it was
It was not a five panel like pump
It was a four panel
They can custom make that stuff though
Maybe
Cause it's just a cabinet
And then you get like a DDR panel
You know eight
Or you know
Sixteen panel
Not sixteen panel
Eight panel
Set up stage or whatever
And you just replace the arrows out of it
Alright
Alright we've talked
We talked a long time about this
I'm ready to move on
But I just
You know as a long time music game fan
It was
It was
It was that poly bus moment of
Wait a minute
What
What the fuck is this doing here
Especially
Here
Like not the bay area
Not Seattle
I would have fully expected to see one in Seattle
Cause that's where all that
Stuff started
But um
Here
Like what
Anyway it was weird
Anyway
Maybe I'll get an email or tweet about it this week
Say Rob I wish you hadn't talked about that but
Sorry
Well you know what
I'm sorry
If you didn't want anybody
Nobody
You don't put it in the middle of a fucking arcade
Yes
I might be
What did you think was gonna fucking happen
I mean
As I said
The powers that be in the legal folks out there
Just
It's not hurting anybody
In fact
I was
It made me smile
To be like
If I wanna go fucking play
Conga feeling
Or some of those old things
Cause all the
Cause I'll tell you what
Down the street at Roseville Golf Land
That Max 2 machine needs to be euthanized
It needs to be taken out back to the barn
And shot in the
It just
It needs to be killed
Because it is
It is horrific
In horrific shape
So I can only imagine
There's probably very few number of fourth mix
And fourth mix plus out there
That are still in good shape
Like
Probably private owners
That take good fucking care of them
But like
Things that have been out there
In the arcades and stuff
They're
They're
They're all gonna be hurting
So you know what
I'm glad that
It lives on
Through this
So it made me happy so
And just give it another season of wet feet
From you know
The water slides
Slopping all over the Max 2 machines
Well luckily
Luckily a bowling alley
Doesn't have that problem
Alright
Alright
Oh
Pump it up prime
Says act deft
And actually links me to a picture
Of pump it up prime
See but the floor's different
The screen looks
No but the screen didn't say pump it up on it
Look at my picture
It didn't say pump at the bottom
So
But yes
Pump it up prime
Was the one that was in the
Alright I don't know
You know what
I'm just gonna fucking email Kyle
Alright
This is a custom camera man
I'm just gonna fucking do it
Alright
Let's get into it
Let's talk about
What's been going on in gaming
I do want to quickly plug

Orange Lounge Radio
Lots of great shows coming up
For you throughout the month of May
And then of course into June
It's gonna be a crazy busy month
Leading up to our 15th anniversary
On June 18th
And
We are looking to
Kind of plug and promote
15 years of O-L-R
So if you are interested in
So if you are interested in
Having one of us on your podcast
Or shit if the timing works out
Maybe all of us
We can be hard to get all in the
Same place at one point
But just email us
Participate at
Orange Lounge Radio dot com
And we're really just trying to
Promote and get out there
So we would love to come on
Your show
Um
Let's get started with some
Gaming news for the week
Loki
Yes
So apparently the Oculus
Um
What was it
Oculus story studio
Has
Closed down
Now the Oculus story studio
If you're not familiar with that
Was supposed to be releasing
Some VR enhanced
Um
Movies
So they had three that they had
Worked on and released
Lost Henry and Dear Angelica
And you know they had some
Big name stars doing the voices
In these movies as well
But I guess according to
Um
The Oculus VP of content
Jason Rubin
Um
They're still looking to film
VR projects
But
You know ongoing projects
From the Oculus story studio
Have been cancelled
And of course the three
That have been released so far
Are still on the store
They're not going to be
Delisted or anything like that
So
Yeah
That's um
That's unfortunate
But I guess it makes sense
Because there's not a lot of
Eyes hitting that stuff right now
I mean you're talking about
You know people that have
VR
You know headsets and stuff
On the Oculus
Which is a closed store front
And then people that are going to
Be interested in actually
Viewing these
Like movies
That's a really small market
That you're hitting right there
It's just
Maybe when it's more mainstream
Bobby and I were talking about
This in one of our chats earlier
Um
And he said he's actually seen
Those movies
And that they were
They were good
So
It's kind of
Kind of a bummer to see it go
But that's a really
High caliber of talent
Which tells me
It's expensive talent
So this probably wasn't a cheap
Endeavor
By
Especially
If the quality of the films
Ended up being good too
I mean it was probably
It probably cost them to do it
So you know
Again
You gotta make money
Right
So if they just weren't selling
Enough
To justify it
Then
They gotta do what they gotta do
But
It may be just something that's
Before it's time
Yeah
And that could be the case too
And you know they do say they're
Looking at
You know funding
Other VR film projects
So
Maybe
Maybe it's just something
The indie scene is gonna have to
Pick up and run with
I don't know
I'm still surprised though
We haven't had that
Well
Maybe this is out there
And I'm just not aware of it
Because I'm not an Oculus owner
And I don't use
You know a lot of the VR stuff
Yet
But
We're finally getting a
Gear VR in the house
Because
When Alan bought his phone
They were running a promotion
Or whatever
Because he got one of those new
SAs or whatever
Yeah I have no idea
Yeah he got a
Thing of that
So
I'm surprised that Facebook
Hasn't injected more VR
Into the news feed yet
I know
Like some of it's there
I see like 360 video
So I'm
What
I'm sure you could put that on
An Oculus headset
And you could see the 360 video
But I feel like
Isn't that the direction
Where Facebook wants to be
When they're shoving that video
Stuff down your throat
And they're really trying to
Like so and so is life
Like
There's gonna be a time
Yeah but I don't think
When
There's gonna be a time when
You don't have to strand yourself
On a desert island
To go see the fire festival
You could see it live in VR
Maybe that
Maybe that's how
Fire Festival 2018
Will happen
It's from the safety
Of your own damn home
Because we can't figure out
How to you know
Build a temporary home
From the safety of your home
In VR
Fully in VR
On
Oculus Rift
Although
Obviously
You don't want that fucking name
Anywhere near your product
Right now
Honestly
The fire festival is like
The beginning of a
Horror action movie
Or a thriller
Or something like that
Where you trick all these people
And they're going on
To a deserted island
And then there's some
Fight to the death
I mean that's really
Really pieces of
Sort of missing from
That survivor
The Hunger Games type thing
You know
It's like
Oh shit we got on this island
To go see this festival
It's like
Was it Blink 182
Or something like that

I saw a cannon that shot cannons. So that was kind of fun. A cannon that shoots cannons. A cannon that shot cannons, yeah.
So it is kind of unfortunate that they are taking that. Basically it says you don't need to buy. They found a way around the bands as well.
You basically own two consoles. You don't need to buy a new console each time you get banned. If you have two consoles you can get around this an infinite number of bands using the system transfer option.
And apparently that's how he's gotten around the bands. He's been banned twice. But that's kind of funny.
Would you like to know why they are no longer updating Super Mario Maker?
Probably because it's coming out on the Switch. Mario Maker Deluxe is going to fucking happen on the Switch. Let's say first quarter next year.
And it will include the skins from Super Mario All Stars. I can't say Mario 2 because Mario 2 is a very different game because of the whole fact that it was created from the Japanese game.
But they could create some items from Mario 2 or something. They could. You can have the stackable mushrooms or something like that.
But Mario All Stars would be perfect. Mario All Stars would be perfect because those sprites already exist.
And they could just. Especially from the original Mario. They could just put them right in there. And that will be Mario Maker Deluxe.
And a few new items. A few new things. And that will be Mario Maker Deluxe on the Switch. Because this whole. The fact that Mario Kart 8 sold as well as it did.
Here we go. Open them fucking floodgates because here come the Wii U ports on Switch. But you know what? Honestly. Mario Kart 8 is pretty fucking good actually.
So I. And if it means Bayonetta 2 gets another chance. I can't hate on this.
But I understand that. But I own Mario Kart 8. And I just have trouble justifying the system to play Mario Kart 8 that has Battle Mode in it.
Because you know what? You can't fucking tell me that the Wii U can't handle Battle Mode. It fucking had Battle Mode in there.
And you know what? It's a god damn insult that they're not updating the Wii U version to go along with that.
I'm sorry. It's insulting that. Oh well you know we made this really cool thing that we really should have done in the beginning.
But guess what? You're gonna pay to get another $60 for it. You know what? Fuck them. That's what I'm saying.
Seriously? Fuck them in this. Oh hey yeah we could fix these problems. But fuck you guys. Buy our new system.
That's not how it's gonna work. And you know why fucking Mario Kart 8 sold so well? Because there's no fucking games on the god damn system. It's the next biggest game.
Disagree. Disagree. Mario Kart 8 sold well because for most people that aren't you or me. It's their first Mario Kart 8.
Because a lot of people skipped the fucking Wii U. That's. That's what it is. That's why Mario Kart 8 sold.
I doubt it. I think it's really just the next big game that's from Nintendo that's on that platform. And that's why it's released on there.
I'm sorry. It's not because it's the first Mario Kart game for them. Because you can't tell me that these people didn't have like Mario Kart 7 or any of the other games.
It's their first Mario Kart 8. Because most people didn't buy the Wii U. So this is their first Mario Kart 8.
And they're like wow this game is fucking feature filled right off the bat because they skipped Mario. They skipped the Wii U completely.
That's nice that they have a feature filled game. I wish I could get that because I paid the same $60 and actually more than that because I supported them with their DLC.
So where's my fucking reward for my loyalty? Oh that's right. Fuck you. Buy our $400 system with another game.
Alright. Here's a game that I don't think is planned for the Switch. I don't remember the original Kickstarter.
But this team called No Matter is making a game called Pray for the Gods. It was a kickstarted action RPG and get this.
They've had to change the name this week because it was called P-R-E-Y for the gods. Pray for the gods.
Well you may have missed this week or maybe you didn't miss. Bethesda released a game called Pray this week which was an update to a game.
Although I don't think the games really have that much in common. Name only that's it.
Yeah like is it still like to be fair I have not played the new Pray but I beat the old Pray.
The new Pray is nothing like the old Pray at all.
So like the Native American themes and all that are gone?
Nope. It's not even in there. You like take the forms of different things. Like you can jump in.
It has more to do. It reminds me of like what was that game. It was. It had a fucking cherub in it.
And I'm trying to remember what the hell it was called. It was. Oh god. I can't remember what it's called now.
But they had like a. There was a cherub in it. You could take control of different people and stuff.
DungeonBuster in chat says the new Pray is more like Bioshock in space. That's not the first person I've heard say that basically.
But anyway so Pray is out obviously but now you've got this other game Pray for the Gods.
And so they got basically threatened with legal stuff from Zenimax Bethesda over the trademark.
So you may remember. This is not the first time Bethesda has done this.
Do you remember when they threatened against Mojang because they were doing a game called Scrolls.
And they were going to do. You know obviously Bethesda.
I don't understand how they get the trademark for such a common name in the first place.
That's a great fucking question.
I mean that is stupid. It's a single name. It's very commonly used.
And like the fact that they're going after other games. They have nothing to fucking do with it.
Ahem. Saga.
Exactly. It's our fucking trademark and copyright system is so goddamn messed up.
But what's interesting because Notch had all that Minecraft money. He did fight Zenimax in court.
But they did. They settled. They didn't actually go to court.
They did use. Mojang got to use the name Scrolls but they could not own the trademark for it.
But Scrolls never really came. I mean it was in beta. They did like a free beta.
That's as far as that game ever got. Like they never really did a full release that game.
This has nothing to do with it. It's like Fighter. Or like you know what the what they.
Which is what all the games.
It's like copywriting the.
Okay but back in the day. Like on the Atari 2600. That's what those fucking games were called.
You had Boxing. Pitfall. Adventure.
Like these were the games.
Exactly. You like but I'm surprised that they get that kind of a copyright. They get the trademark for Prey.
It's such a commonly used name. I mean it's just a word. It's one word.
And you're telling me that like all these other games that that word is off limits now because of fucking Bethesda and their shitty game. Fuck that.
Well they have had to change the name to the new name of the game is Prey for the gods. It is P R A E Y for the gods.
That's stupid. It's fucking dumb.
I don't blame the developer for that. I kind of credit them.
No I blame Bethesda for this because the reason why you would file a lawsuit like this is because that there could be some confusion between Prey their game and Prey this game and pray for the gods.
It's like totally different. You look at the two games are fucking completely different. There's nothing similar about them other than they work on game. They probably both on PC.
What's interesting though is that in the developer update they actually mentioned that one of the games. One of the names they were originally considering was P R A E Y for the gods.
But that A and E was that special character where the A and E are linked. Darsagre you know more about writing than I do.
Yeah. What do you call that when the A and E are linked together. It's like it's a specific alphabet like it's a Greek character.
Give me a moment because I know it's not a ligature. That is not a ligature. Hold on.
Okay. But here's the thing is that that A and E as a combined letter you can't Google that. I mean you can but you can't. People aren't going to do it.
So now they're just going to call it P R A E Y.
Actually it was originally a ligature and then it became its own letter coming actually from classic Greek and Latin and also used in Old English.
Why are they suing Fallout Boy? I might confuse Fallout Boy with a fucking post apocalyptic RPG because that's certainly fucking similar.
Well Fallout Boy needs to be sued for a lot of reasons. I'm just kidding. I'm just hating for no reason.
You know why they did it? Because they're small. They're a big company and that's a small company and they can fucking get away with it. Those fucking assholes.
It's called an ash by the way.
They're an ash. Thank you.
Because Fallout Boy is in the name of a video game. You know what? Blackfall I understand that but this game has nothing to fucking do with their game other than the name and the name is not even the same.
They both make digital disc media. Fallout Boy makes CDs.
And a Playstation is a computer.
Vault Boy is in there. I mean Fallout Boy, Vault Boy.
Alright.
It's a boy that's in Fallout.
I need a pallet cleanser. This is getting too heated. Alright moving on.
Dark Sakura take us away. Take us somewhere else.
How about Andromeda?
How about space? Yes.
So um mods have finally legitimately happened in Mass Effect Andromeda.
There is a new mod tool and I have already downloaded the best of all possible mods called Shut Up Sam.
Where you know how every time you go into like it's really hot. The weather has increased.
Okay thank you. It's fucking cold on vault. Duh.
Or there's radiation. Duh.
It happens every- Sam doesn't shut up.
So the first mod I downloaded was one where Sam shuts the fuck up.
Um but there is um there's a few other ones out there too and there's full installation um instructions on uh the nexus.
For nexus mods.
Um and there's even um one that helps you back up and recover your game with how it was and you know before.
There's also like external mods that they did have out that honestly just about every game has had out those like cinematic and color pallet adjusting ones.
But now um they finally they also have one that lets you use like any skin color in uh no matter what default that you choose.
Um how to change your outfits. It's gonna it's not gonna be too long before we have uh custom elements in there too.
It didn't take them you know terribly long for Dragon Age.
So let's just say it. The mods are there.
Go forth and mod. Go forth and mod.
So full booby rider? Is that?
There actually is um a naked mod.
Of course there is! That's always one of the first.
That's like a prerequisite. Modding yeah.
Your game hasn't made it till somebody put boobies and dong in it.
I'm still looking for that inquisition mod that restores the iron bull to his former glory.
You knew about that right?
No I didn't.
They apparently modded his dick. Not modded um they uh modeled it.
And then when it was about ready to publish it finally got caught so now it's a big black rectangle where his junk is.
And if you go look like Flycam stuff I'll find it but yeah it's the the big black box.
Sorry guys they're telling me live that my mic cut out for 30 seconds when I didn't do it.
There's no power switch on these mics so it must be something like I reset my connection here.
Uh but I wouldn't be surprised at how much these mics get handled. There's some shorted wire or something.
It's been a while since we've replaced all these mics and that that might be coming soon.
I don't know these are the ones that uh Brad from Pod Culture so kindly passed down to us.
So that means he used them then we used them. These mics are probably on their last legs.
So we just might we might have to spend some money that I don't have to uh to to modernize this fucking studio.
That might be a project. That's why I'm going to keep screaming streaming screaming onto it.
I'll scream as I stream on Twitch uh to raise money to uh redo all our studios.
That'll be funny.
Alright anyway.
Tigerclaw says yeah you need some better quality mics.
I'm putting it in the chat by the way.
You know what? We do the best we can.
There you go. There's naked Iron Bull.
Hooray. Alright just a couple more stories for you guys and then we'll get your calls.
Let's see how shitty your mics sound on Skype at Orange Lounge Radio. All one word on Skype. Loki.
Alright so like many modern uh video games that are out um they have finally added in the Horizon Zero Dawn a selfie mode.
That's right you can take different poses um or take photos of different poses that Aloy can make in the game and add little tidbits and stuff to it.
For example um you can you know form Aloy's hands into the shape of a heart or she can be lounging on her back or several different face expressions.
You can add filters. You can even put like a postcard greetings from blah blah blah you know type thing in there.
So that is available um I guess they're going to be coming soon with some more updates along with that.
But yeah I mean it makes sense now that a lot of games have done that and it really kind of helps drive the awareness on social media for them.
Like Grand Theft Auto. I think Grand Theft Auto 5 was probably one of the first ones that really did that heavily in there as like a kind of an in game feature so.
Yeah cool.
Yeah and uh the selfie mode in Zelda was always the one.
Or actually you know they also did that in Infamous Second Son I think.
That's right they did.
That was that was I think but um Grand Theft Auto to be fair was out before that so.
A lot of people were using their PlayStation 4 Pros with that because that was one of the games that you know was was supposed to be bigger and better on the Pro was uh Infamous so.
Alright well finally.
Speaking of a game I haven't finished yeah.
Finally tonight did you know they're making a movie out of Rampage.
You know the classic 80's game about monsters invading town.
Come on y'all have played this game you had to have played Rampage at some point in your life.
Uh the movie is being directed by Brad Payton who made the movie San Andreas.
Not to be confused with Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.
And who does it star?
Why the Rock.
Dwayne Johnson is the star of this movie.
And uh guess what there is now a synopsis out there that came out this week.
Uh so uh the Rock plays a primatologist.
A man who keeps people at a distance shares an unshakable bond with George.
The extraordinarily intelligent silverback gorilla who's been in his care since birth.
But a rogue genetic experiment gone ary transforms this gentle ape into a raging monster.
To make matters worse it's soon discovered that there are similarly altered alpha predators.
As these newly created monsters tear across North America destroying everything in their path.
The Rock teams with a discredited genetic engineer to secure an antidote.
Fighting his way through an ever changing battlefield.
Not only to haul a global catastrophe but to save the fearsome creature that was once his friend.
I'll make room on the shelf next to the dumpies for this one.
Because this does not sound that exciting to me but who knows.
Uh by the way it was stated previously by the director that the film would be more emotional, scarier, and real.
You know what's funny is my phone apparently thought when he said make room on the shelf.
Um was basically okay google which is kind of annoying.
I fucking just turn off you piece of crap.
Yeah you need to disable that stuff.
Oh it enabled itself when it you know fucking updated to uh nougat or whatever this I don't know what the fuck it's on now.
So if I say okay google it comes up.
I will make oh yep there it goes.
Download lots of porn.
Hey it did that sweet.
It brought me to uh let's see it says it's what does it say here.
Wait search for I'll make you get it get up there goes download lots of porn.
I think it I think all it is bring up like some weird like oops.
Yeah I just realized Ricky and Gleese is lyrics.
That's some weird shit.
Yeah um I I just realized there might be podcast listeners listening on speakers that now I just set off all their phones too.
Good job.
Turn that turn that stuff off.
Turn it off.
You don't need it.
Uh let's see Brad from Pod Culture says the phone will respond again.
Alright Orange Lounge Radio all one word on Skype if you want to give us a call and say hello.
Talk about something we've talked about tonight or maybe something of your own choosing.
Anyhow before we get to that do you have any last minute stories Loki?
I think we kind of tapped out on everything.
That barrel is scraped to the bottom so.
What about FUs?
Oh you want to do some FUs tonight?
Oh heck yeah.
Let's do it.
I've got plenty to FU.
We got a call coming in we'll do FUs after this so let's get to it.
Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this?
It's me Rama.
Hi Rama how are you?
I'm good.
I have a question for you and Jamie right now.
What are you going to leave Matt out of this?
I'm cool with this.
Well Matt is residential god of anger against Nintendo so but.
Okay.
I think it's between you and Jamie.
Which one of y'all is the biggest saint of throwing shade tonight?
I mean come on.
I don't know Dark Soccer was pretty good on that email earlier.
Rob is a sassy bitch though.
Yeah I don't know I don't know I think we're but we're but we see we both went to that show last night so now we're both like oh we're gonna be Bianca Del Rio today and just throw a bunch of shade so I I don't know it's it's gonna be a close race till the end of the show ain't over Rama.
Lord Jesus that's all I gotta say.
You want us to read you?
Just kidding.
Rob I have Mako-chan that does that to me on a regular basis especially when we do our show okay I get I get enough from her.
Alright I'm glad someone's giving it to you.
You should have seen us last week in Good Lord Almighty.
Alright anything else on your mind besides shade throwing?
I just gotta say when you were talking about playing DDR at your age earlier in the show I am about your age and I still get up there and I play I think I need to give you some tips on you know trying to get up there still.
Now I don't want to turn this into a race thing Rama but I'm gonna.
Just so you know I'm just busting your balls because I love you.
I know and I love you too but I am gonna go racial with this for a minute Rama.
Your people have a better natural talent than my people when it comes to dancing.
Okay okay okay Rob I want you to know something.
That natural gift skipped my black ass okay?
I cannot dance unless I am on the pads okay?
Damn that's the thing about stereotypes they're not always true damn.
Exactly while everybody was growing up learning how to break dance and all that I was at home playing Super Mario Brothers 2, Super Mario Brothers 3, Super Mario I was doing all of that.
That doesn't impede one's ability to dance.
Yes it does.
Some people also are way out of practice like me.
I think it's more of that Rama.
Look here's the deal.
I don't know how much you, this is a personal question I do not expect you to answer.
I don't know how much you weigh now versus when you were let's say 15 years ago which for me would be 23 years old.
But if I were to go how much I weigh now compared to when I was 23 years old.
Some things have changed pretty majorly in that department Rama.
So that's part of the reason it's contributed itself to the fact that I don't move as fast as I used to.
However maybe if I played more of these dancing games I would not have this problem and I admit that.
Which is true but let me tell you.
I've shown you the dance skits I have done with my friends at conventions.
You can see I can move pretty quickly and I can keep in tone.
I want you to know how much I hurt when we were off the stage.
How much I hurt during practice.
How many times I have tripped over my feet and slammed my face into the goddamn floor.
I guess we share something in that regard because the day after a Rocky Horror performance.
Which even though I'm retired I got dragged back on stage because they really really badly needed somebody.
So I got dragged back on stage to do Brad at the last show.
And so I got to do like fucking coordinated dance routines, kick lines and all this stuff right.
And the next day I was just like kill me, kill me now, kill me.
I was sore.
This is why when I go to cons I liquor up before I go down to the informal dance and dance all that booze off.
That way I don't wake up trying to like.
I can't feel my legs, can't feel my legs.
I got to remember my part though.
That's the problem if I drink I do that whole thing where I'm like oh yeah I know my part.
I know and then I just I'm up there and I look like an asshole.
But we still love you.
Thank you, thank you very much I appreciate it.
Alright anything else you want to point out about what I'm doing wrong in my life Rama?
Anything wrong with your life is just that.
I just want you to know I'm here for you.
I got your back.
Alright tell you what.
Oh no you're not going to be there when I'm in New York.
Look Rob I already said this.
I realize that week I will be spending that week with my favorite gay and lesbian couple.
And I'd be damned if I'm going to spend equal time with them all.
It'll work one way or another.
Alright.
You bet your sweet ass it'll work.
We'll get up on a DDR machine together and I'll feel much better about it.
And Mako-chan will be there to record us making fools of ourselves.
I didn't say this shit could be on YouTube.
Who said anything about it being on YouTube?
It'll be on the secret Bogstash network.
Alright secret club's fine.
Alright Rama I'm going to let you go but take care.
You too stay fabulous.
Alright bye.
Alright.
Alright.
Orange Lounge Radio all one word on Skype or 1877 game OLR.
But first I did promise Dark Soccer we could have a moment to vent.
Cause sometimes you know here on this show we need to dive into a long standing tradition here and let off some steam in a segment we call the FUs of the week.
FU to the GOP a major FU.
FU to basically anyone who had anything to do with that piece of shit legislation that their Dr. Evil laughing asshole selves have passed the house.
Fuck you.
Fuck all of you.
But bless the lady who put in the bill to remove their exemptions.
Now they're also subject to the same piece of shit.
That's it.
My FU of the week goes to the 100 degree day we had this week.
It is fucking May.
It is not summer time yet.
It is not August.
Who was it here?
Well lucky fucking you.
Where did you go?
Oh you were in the bay area that day.
That's right.
It was still pretty hot.
Drinking cocktails.
For the bay area it was hot that day.
Like 89.
But it is fucking early May.
Triple degree weather.
No ma'am.
No ma'am.
Loki your FU of the week.
I guess just FU to being tired.
Because I'm tired.
I don't want to be tired.
I want to be productive and work on my game.
My brain is like YouTube videos.
Let's watch more fucking videos about 3D printing.
The same videos you've already watched several times.
Let's watch a funny video about what's wrong with said movie.
I waste so much time.
My brain is tired.
Your brain is very tired.
Well someday the kids will be 18 and out of the house and then maybe you'll finish your game.
There it is.
Your FUs of the week.
It's been a while.
It felt good to let loose a little bit of steam here.
And some folks in chat.
Let's see.
Act F saying weather definitely deserves a permanent spot in the FUs.
Act F says all week over 100 degree weather.
This week it's fucking cold.
I didn't even look at.
I heard it was going to rain today.
It was supposed to be thundering and rainy this weekend.
And it's supposed to be up in the upper 80s later this week.
As much as the rain bothers me when it's non-stop.
Like I've mentioned before I get affected by seasons.
And as much as the non-stop rain bothers me.
A day or two here and there I don't mind.
So I was kind of like thinking oh it might be nice to have a little bit of rain.
And then I don't have to water all the plants and the lawn.
Now right now the 10 day forecast says maybe rain next Monday.
But for now the next week 90 degrees on Tuesday.
But otherwise the rest of the week mid 70s.
That's not too bad.
That's the May weather I expect living in Northern California in the valley.
Alright.
Well that is going to do it tonight.
I'm sorry if you did not get through on the Skype line.
But you can always give us an email.
Participate at Orangelaunchradio.com.
You can also tweet us at OLR.
But I believe that is going to do it for another episode of our show tonight.
I want to thank you guys for tuning in and supporting the show.
If you like what you heard here at Orange Lawns Radio.
Please tell a friend or five about the show.
Help us spread the word.
Because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
But if your voices aren't here we can't air them.
We do like seeing some new names once in a while.
Although we love our old names too.
Don't get us wrong.
A nice five star review on a site like iTunes goes a long way.
Seriously if you've never taken the 30 seconds to do a five star review on iTunes.
Please, please help us out.
Because those go a long way in getting noticed.
Because there's probably easily a thousand video game podcasts on iTunes at this point.
So it's sometimes hard to stay above the line.
Even if you are 15 years old that doesn't really buy you jack shit.
So anyway.
That's it for that.
So let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
Loki your final thoughts tonight.
I'm going to work more on this new game until I start another new game.
And another new game.
And another new game.
No but this one actually sounds.
I have an idea now.
Because that was kind of where I was at before.
Like I wanted to do.
So actually I'm still going to do something with you on this.
And I thought that that's why I started this one.
But I still don't know what you're going to do yet.
We talked about programming so I could learn Unity.
That came up on an episode when the guys from Little Tanks were here.
Yes.
I do have to say though.
What I'm coming up with so far is tank related.
But not like their game.
I was like don't rip off the guest game.
No I'm not ripping off their game.
No no no.
Completely different type of.
I mean it's an arcade type game.
But different looking type game.
Because they could sue you like Bethesda did.
I'm kidding.
Yeah yeah.
I'm surprised you know.
There's a tank you know.
The word tank is used somewhere then they can.
I don't know.
Fuck Bethesda.
Seriously.
Dark Sakura.
Your final thought tonight.
Some of my photos from last night turned out really nice.
From seeing Bianca Del Rio.
I was just looking at my pictures.
I like that dress.
That black sequined thing.
I want one.
And my final thought for the night is I had a good time last night.
It was very like doing dinner at a fancy-ish restaurant.
But not too fancy.
And then a show and then dessert with my friends.
That was a very pleasant evening.
It was a very nice night and I need to do that more often.
But I need to make sure I have time for video games as well.
That's very important as well.
So we hope you guys have time for video games this week.
We will see you in seven days and we'll do this all over again.
But until then, thanks for listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
Have a great week everybody.
