27000	32000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	37000	Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice
37000	39000	It is Orange Lounge Radio
39000	46000	Live tonight, episode number 685 of our show for this May 7th of 2017
46000	51000	My name is Rob Roberts, you might follow me on Twitter at Skie
51000	58000	And I'm here with my co-host to talk to you about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle, and other stuff too
58000	61000	You know, tangents, 3 hour show, it happens
61000	64000	Say hello in studio to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers
64000	65000	Sup
65000	67000	Hi, how are you, Jamie?
67000	68000	I'm tired
68000	70000	Yeah, you said you were up late last night
70000	72000	I was up to like 4.30 in the morning
72000	74000	Bow chicka wow, no I'm just kidding
74000	75000	No
75000	76000	It's nothing like that
76000	77000	You were playing, playing
77000	78000	I wasn't playing anything
78000	79000	You were just
79000	80000	Watching random stuff on YouTube
80000	82000	Oh, okay, okay, you fell down one of those
82000	88000	I got caught in the trap and I was talking with my good friend and co-worker, James
88000	91000	Who is sometimes in the chat room and I hope soon tonight
91000	96000	Well, speaking of other stuff, this is really funny, some of our listeners will get a kick out of this
96000	101000	So, DarkSakura and I went to the same event last night in Sacramento
101000	106000	We didn't go together because we planned it completely separately with two different groups of people
106000	110000	But, so here's the thing, so DarkSakura and I went to see Bianca Del Rio
110000	115000	Which, if you follow Drag Race, which you may have caught that Jamie and I are a fan of
115000	116000	Loki, not so much
116000	119000	Oh, hi by the way, Techmaster Loki, how are you doing?
119000	120000	Fine
120000	123000	Alright, you just sit there for a minute because we're going to talk Drag Race for a moment
123000	125000	But not a super long time, I promise
125000	129000	But Bianca Del Rio is one of the stars of Drag Race, was the winner of season 6
129000	134000	So, but now, I mean honestly, I mean, however you feel about that show aside
134000	138000	I mean, she's really coming to her own as a stand-up comic who tours the country
138000	146000	And she's also known for being a very, how would you say it, like, unpolitically correct or off, you know
146000	148000	She's like Lisa Lampanelli except she's funny
148000	150000	Yes, she's Lisa Lampanelli but funny
150000	155000	But she's one of those like, there's like several disclaimers before you go to the show
155000	159000	Like, this is going to be offensive, you're going to be offended
159000	163000	So if you're here to like Tumblr police this show, get the f out
163000	164000	GTFO
164000	165000	Type of thing, yeah, basically
165000	166000	And don't bring your 9 month old baby
166000	168000	Although somebody did bring a baby
168000	170000	But we were just, ironically, we were both there
170000	173000	And I thought what was really funny, you were just sitting like two rows behind me
173000	178000	Yeah, Becky and I were like on G or something and y'all were like, what, on D?
178000	180000	Yeah, yeah, we were in D
180000	181000	We won the D
181000	184000	Yeah, we got the D at the Bianca Del Rio show
184000	187000	But I just thought it was funny, yeah, you went with Becky, who's one of your besties
187000	190000	And I went with my old co-worker
190000	192000	Because, you know, I changed jobs a couple years ago
192000	196000	But I still, there's, believe it or not, there's some people I like that I hang out with during the day
196000	198000	And so she was one of them
198000	201000	And so, you know, she and I used to talk every week about Drag Race
201000	203000	So I know she was really excited to go
203000	204000	Cool
204000	205000	Yeah, we had a good time
205000	206000	Yeah, it was good
206000	207000	And then there was Froyo and that was awesome
207000	209000	Yes, and then Dark Soccer and I went to Froyo
209000	212000	And that was, that was, that was our night
212000	214000	Good time, no gaming involved
214000	217000	Which is where we talked about going to coin op here locally
217000	218000	It was loud and
219000	222000	Well, okay, here's the thing about the local joint
222000	225000	And, you know, I'm obviously going to talk local for a minute here
225000	227000	But no matter where you guys are in the country
227000	231000	There's definitely been like a renaissance of classic coin op gaming
231000	236000	And I think most big cities at this point have a barcade of some sort at this point, right?
236000	241000	Where there's pinball machines and old arcade games plus alcohol
241000	243000	Which always makes for a good time, right?
243000	246000	So we have one in Sacramento and it's, it's a decent place
246000	248000	I'm glad it's here, I like it
248000	250000	But here's the weird thing about it for me
250000	253000	I don't, like there's just not a lot of stuff there
253000	255000	That I get really excited about
255000	260000	Because a lot of it is the really cliche classic gaming
260000	263000	Like a Ms. Pac-Man machine
263000	267000	It's like, it's like all the, like a Donkey Kong machine
267000	269000	No, it's got other things
269000	271000	There's a six player X-Men
271000	274000	Right, and I'm not, again, I don't want to knock this place
274000	276000	Because I want to support local business
276000	277000	There's a Golden Axe
277000	278000	I'm glad something like it exists
278000	281000	But I will say, I will give the place props for this
281000	283000	Their pinball game is on point
283000	285000	They have a lot of, like I play more pinball
285000	286000	One of Dan's buddies owns those
286000	288000	Oh okay, well yeah, when I go there I play more pinball
288000	289000	Then I'm giving your buddy money
289000	292000	Because when I go there I play more pinball than anything else in the joint
292000	294000	So, but I mean they have like the new shit
294000	296000	Like I played some Batman
296000	298000	There's some Batman, the 60's Batman
298000	299000	Yeah, that one's a new one
299000	301000	Back when it was awesome
301000	302000	There's, um
302000	306000	The TV show, and then there was like an Aerosmith one that was really new too
306000	309000	I think the ACDC was there before
309000	311000	And the same guy owns the Wizard of Oz
311000	313000	And he had that there until people kept breaking it
313000	320000	But there is, believe it or not, one of the SNK multi choice
320000	322000	And it's got a Blazing Star in it
322000	323000	Well that's cool
323000	325000	And that makes me super happy
325000	328000	Because what is my favorite shooter game next to R-Type?
328000	330000	Blazing Star
330000	332000	I would have thought it was a treasure game for sure
332000	334000	But that's alright
334000	335000	Well, alright
335000	337000	Let's see, Vidpower in chat says
337000	340000	Does being drunk make you lose even faster in old coin-op games?
340000	341000	Yes, it does
341000	342000	Sometimes it makes you better
342000	343000	Yeah
343000	346000	Because sometimes, you know what alcohol focus is?
346000	351000	Where you are just so blazed that you can like cut the rest of the universe out
351000	353000	Well blazed usually refers to something else
353000	354000	Well you know what I mean
354000	355000	I know what you mean
355000	356000	Blitzed I guess
356000	357000	Okay blitzed, yeah
357000	359000	Just so much on the sauce
359000	362000	That everything else falls behind you and you get hyper focused
362000	364000	Yeah, yeah, I've had those moments
364000	368000	That was the time I made it to like level fucking 29 on Luminess
368000	370000	While I was shit face drunk at my birthday
372000	374000	I think I did it on your PSP
374000	375000	I think you did
375000	376000	Yours or Wendell's
376000	377000	I think you did, yeah
377000	378000	At one of my birthday parties
378000	381000	But yeah, I mean, so we didn't end up going there
381000	383000	I mean, so I don't even know why I bring this up
383000	385000	But it's just one of those like, you know
385000	387000	It's cool that we have a place like that
387000	390000	But the magic's kind of worn off for me
390000	392000	But I do find, okay here's the thing though
392000	394000	I'm not, again, I'm really not trying to knock these places
394000	398000	I think it just depends on like what games and what presentation you have
398000	400000	Because I remember a place in Portland that I went to
400000	404000	Now granted, this was, this was when Alan and I were first dating
404000	405000	So it was like six years ago
405000	408000	So we went to Portland and we went to an arcade there
408000	409000	I had a lot of fun there
409000	413000	But that was like one of the first of those types of places that I went to
413000	416000	I didn't have anything in SAC or even the Bay Area at that time
416000	418000	Now San Francisco I think has a couple of these places too
418000	420000	There's one in the Castro, right?
420000	422000	Uh, I didn't see it in the Castro
422000	423000	There is, there is
423000	424000	It's on the edge of it
424000	426000	But it's, I can't remember the name of the place
426000	427000	JD's in chat, he'll know
427000	428000	Yes, Brucade, thank you
428000	431000	Okay, yeah, we didn't go there when I was there on Wednesday
431000	433000	It's not like near the theater
433000	436000	It's in a different, it's like down market a little further
436000	438000	Ohhhhh
438000	442000	It's closer to that music venue where we saw Frank music
442000	444000	And now I can't remember the name of it
444000	445000	It was like downstairs
445000	447000	Is it like just past the cafe?
447000	448000	The cafe?
448000	449000	It's past the cafe, yeah
449000	450000	Okay
450000	451000	Yeah
451000	454000	But now when I went we actually went to like a little Thai place
454000	457000	And then the GLBT museum was having a free day
457000	460000	So I went and kind of cried for a little bit
460000	463000	When I heard the Harvey Milk recording
463000	465000	The Living Will, the recorded Will
465000	466000	Oh
466000	468000	Because I had that as a recording there
468000	469000	I've never been there, I'd like to check that out
469000	471000	And then we went down to the mix, so
471000	474000	JD is in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com
474000	477000	Because hello, chat, we do tape live every Sunday night
477000	479000	At the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com
479000	482000	Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern
482000	484000	And JD in chat, who lives in San Francisco
484000	486000	That's why I knew he'd know this stuff
486000	488000	He says it's near Gateway
488000	491000	So, do you know, you know where that is, right?
491000	492000	Yeah, the gay jumbo's right next to it
492000	493000	Yes
493000	495000	So, alright, anyway
495000	496000	Yeah
496000	498000	Hurray, and all the people around the world
498000	500000	And other countries who are outside Northern California
500000	502000	Are like, wow, these places that I've never heard of
502000	503000	But again
503000	504000	Now you know
504000	506000	These barcades are showing up in a lot of different places
506000	507000	Let's see, in chat
507000	509000	I really liked round one, though
509000	511000	SSG100Matt says, when you come to New York, Rob
511000	513000	We can barcade Bar Hop
513000	514000	That would be awesome
514000	516000	I would really love to go, though, out there
516000	518000	I want to go to that Fun Spot place
518000	521000	Where all the, like, that's one of those
521000	523000	They don't have alcohol there, I don't think
523000	525000	But that's where, like, all the classic games are at
525000	528000	But I was looking, and it's kind of a hell of a deal
528000	530000	I don't think I could really get to Fun Spot when I'm out there
530000	533000	I am coming to New York this year, but I am going for a wedding
533000	536000	So, I can't do too much crazy stuff
536000	538000	Because the wedding's actually in Connecticut
538000	540000	But I'm trying to plan it where it's like
540000	542000	Well, maybe we'll have a fun day in New York
542000	544000	I feel like, if we're going to go to New York
544000	547000	Alan and I have to go to see something on Broadway
547000	548000	Like, how can you not?
548000	550000	But, I don't know, we'll see
550000	551000	We'll see
551000	555000	Let's see, going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com
556000	557000	Tigerclaw says
557000	559000	Wasn't Fun Spot the place where King of Kong was filmed?
559000	560000	Yeah, some of it
560000	562000	That's where most people know the place from
562000	563000	Fantaz in chat says
563000	565000	All the arcades closed down here in Canada
565000	567000	That's sad
567000	569000	Doesn't Canada like their arcades too?
569000	570000	Well, what part of Canada
570000	572000	I mean, Canada's a big place, yo
572000	574000	What part of Canada are you in?
574000	575000	Because I bet the big s-
575000	578000	I would be gasped, shocked
578000	580000	If, like, Toronto didn't have these things
580000	582000	But Toronto's one city in a big place
582000	585000	So, uh, you know
585000	586000	Let's see
586000	588000	Oh, Fantaz says I'm in Toronto
588000	590000	Wow, and they don't have-
590000	591000	There's gotta be something
591000	593000	I gotta ask my other buddies that live out there
593000	595000	If there's any place like that
595000	596000	There's gotta be something out there
596000	597000	Let's see
597000	600000	Shadeinator in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says
600000	602000	Rob, speaking of arcades
602000	606000	Do you remember an old mechanical game involving clay pigeons
606000	610000	Projected onto a screen and you shoot them with light guns that look like rifles
610000	611000	What was that called?
611000	614000	We had one at my arcade when I worked at the arcade
614000	615000	I remember that
615000	617000	Do you know how else I know that?
617000	618000	It was like clay shooting
618000	620000	I think it was just like clay pigeons or clay shooting
620000	621000	Yeah
621000	622000	Here, here's a tip for you
622000	625000	It's in the movie Karate Kid
625000	626000	Yeah
626000	629000	There's a montage
629000	630000	And they're at the arcade
630000	631000	And that is in the movie
631000	632000	Gotta have montage
632000	633000	That's right, there's a montage
633000	634000	So go watch
634000	636000	Karate Kid's gotta be on Netflix or something, right?
636000	637000	Go watch it
637000	640000	And pause right there on that sequence
640000	641000	So there it is
641000	645000	And JD found it, Clay Pigeon is the name of it
645000	647000	Yeah, we used to have all like the
647000	651000	Okay, I lived in Alabama, they were the dirty rednecks
651000	653000	You know, wearing wife beaters
653000	654000	Stereotypes
654000	655000	Wife beaters and jeans and boots
655000	659000	I'm not even joking because the stereotype exists for a reason
659000	665000	Okay, we come in and like just be loud and raucous
665000	668000	And play the stupid gun game
668000	670000	And then leave it a mess
673000	675000	Let's see, going to a chat
675000	678000	Bobby Blackwolf using good old Yelp found 10 arcades in Toronto
678000	680000	That doesn't mean there are going to be 10 good arcades
680000	682000	But it sounds like there's some to choose from there
682000	684000	Yelp was a good idea though to find stuff there
684000	688000	As studio 100 Matt suggests, you might have to go to Niagara Falls or something
688000	689000	Yeah, I wonder if those arcades
689000	690000	I'm not looking at the link right now
690000	693000	But I wonder if those arcades aren't like bowling alleys
693000	695000	But sometimes bowling alleys can have good arcades
695000	698000	You just have to experiment a little bit and look around
698000	700000	So, we'll see, we'll see
700000	702000	Alright, anyhow, let's see
702000	704000	Loki, how are you doing? I haven't heard a lot from you tonight
704000	705000	Have you been?
705000	706000	I'm fine
706000	707000	Yeah?
707000	711000	Any progress on your new project, your authoring project this week
711000	713000	Or whatever it is you're working on?
713000	715000	I think I'm working on a new game
715000	716000	Oh yeah, I guess
716000	718000	Maybe you're not if you don't know what the fun is
718000	721000	No, I haven't made that much progress on it
721000	723000	In fact, actually, I was working on it last night
723000	726000	I literally fell asleep while working on it and woke up later on
726000	727000	I'm like, oh crap
727000	731000	So, no, I haven't made a ton of progress on it yet
731000	735000	It's still design phase, I guess
737000	739000	How about 3D printing?
739000	742000	I didn't really work on the 3D printing too much
742000	747000	I did install the fan shroud I printed last week on it
747000	751000	And I just need to solder the fan
751000	757000	I need to extend the cords on it so that they can reach the board on the actual printer
757000	759000	So they can control the fan
759000	762000	So I started doing that last night
762000	765000	And then I haven't really bothered to print anything else yet
765000	770000	Because I needed to get that done so I can reinstall the auto level on there
770000	773000	And then redo that because it's all jacked up
773000	777000	Since I tore a hole in the top of my build plate
777000	779000	Or the little cup
779000	783000	There's like this surface that's on top of the aluminum plate
783000	787000	So I tore a hole in that surface that's on there and covered it up with tape
787000	789000	And it works okay, I guess
789000	793000	But I really do need to replace it with some tempered glass or something
793000	799000	I just haven't gotten around to buying a piece of tempered glass to put on there
799000	802000	But soon, I mean, I still have been like
802000	804000	When are you printing my mini me?
804000	806000	Your mini you?
806000	808000	My mini me. Remember we were going to make an action figure of Rob Roberts
808000	810000	That came up on a previous OR
810000	812000	But I have to get a 3D model of you first
812000	814000	If I must
814000	815000	Alright
815000	817000	I did find, now this was cool
817000	820000	We're sending you 3D printers
820000	826000	There's instructions on how to take your model out of World of Warcraft
826000	827000	Oh cool
827000	829000	And import it into a 3D printer
829000	832000	And it requires some tweaking to it
832000	835000	Because you have to change the type of polygon
835000	840000	But they did really realistic, like someone did a full on Lich King
840000	841000	It was pretty cool
841000	843000	I remember back when we were doing Horde House
843000	845000	There was a service that came up on the show
845000	847000	Where they would like print, they would make statues
847000	848000	They still have that
848000	851000	Yeah, so I'm not too surprised the technology's out there
851000	855000	But now it's probably more easier for you and I to get access to the 3D models
855000	857000	To do that kind of stuff, so yeah, pretty cool
857000	860000	Anyhow, it's a bit of a slower news week this week
860000	863000	We will get into the video game news and what's been going on here in a minute
863000	864000	After we do our gaming weeks
864000	867000	But obviously it's a little slower in the news cycle right now
867000	869000	We're less than a month away from E3
869000	871000	No, we're a month away from E3 at this point
871000	873000	When does it all start? June 9th?
873000	874000	June 10th
874000	876000	First press conferences are June 10th
876000	878000	It's like Saturday this year is when E3 starts
878000	881000	Yeah, there's EAs on Saturday
881000	884000	Microsoft and Bethesda on Sunday
884000	887000	Sony is at their usual time on Monday
887000	891000	Ubisoft and Nintendo are assumed to be Monday as well
891000	892000	But who knows
892000	894000	We're gonna have a crazy June
894000	896000	Between the 15 years of OLR
896000	898000	And the E3 and all that stuff
898000	899000	It's gonna be a crazy June
899000	901000	Isn't that the week that we're out to?
901000	905000	It's gonna be June 11th
905000	906000	June 11th is E3
906000	908000	June 18th is our 15th anniversary show
908000	912000	June 25th is we're giving ourselves a week off
913000	915000	As a reward for doing the show for 15 years
915000	916000	Got it
916000	918000	Because I'm going to Chicago
918000	919000	There it is
919000	923000	So that's our June
923000	924000	It's gonna be a little bit crazy
924000	925000	Speaking of 15 years
925000	927000	I wanna make sure I got this out at some point during the show
927000	930000	Because obviously we're coming up on the big 15
930000	933000	If you didn't already know, Orange Launch Radio started
933000	936000	Actually, technically as a station
936000	938000	It started in May of 2002
938000	941000	So we're in the 15 years right now
941000	943000	As a station we started in 2002
943000	947000	Because originally we were a station on the Live 365 service
947000	948000	Which is no longer around
948000	950000	But that was where you could set up your own music thing
950000	953000	And we had DDR music and DanceMania soundtrack stuff
953000	956000	To differentiate ourselves from DDR Freak Radio
956000	958000	Which was also started around the same time
958000	962000	But then the idea was that the centerpiece of Orange Launch Radio
962000	966000	The network was Orange Launch Radio Live
966000	967000	The show
967000	969000	Which is this now, 15 years later
969000	971000	Now that podcasting is a thing
971000	973000	Now that Live 365 is gone
973000	974000	And we moved to all games
974000	976000	Moved to VOG Network and all that
976000	980000	But, you know, 2002
980000	981000	When this show started
981000	984000	Was really kind of like a peak of music gaming in a way
984000	985000	Like I know, I know
985000	987000	There was other peaks obviously as well
987000	990000	Rock band, Guitar Hero 2 and all that stuff that came later
990000	993000	But the reason why I say that is that I came across
993000	995000	Something today that mentioned that
995000	997000	In the music gaming world
997000	1001000	A website turned 15 years old this month as well
1001000	1003000	Bamani style turned 15 this month
1003000	1006000	And, you know, we've had Eddie who started it
1006000	1008000	He was on the show probably a long time ago talking about it
1008000	1012000	I think he was here around the time they did a big relaunch
1012000	1013000	I think he was here
1013000	1016000	But I was, you know, reading up on the site
1016000	1017000	And I was just going like, wow, memories
1017000	1019000	This has been 15 years
1019000	1022000	It's been a long time since some of this stuff
1022000	1023000	And just, yeah
1023000	1025000	So I just wanted to acknowledge their anniversary as well
1025000	1026000	Give them props
1026000	1027000	I know they've kind of
1027000	1029000	They've gone through their own transformations
1029000	1031000	It used to be a place where people would look at like sim files
1031000	1032000	Like that was their big thing
1032000	1035000	And now they're, you know, they can't really do that anymore
1035000	1038000	So they have more like, you know, what's going on in music gaming news and so forth
1038000	1041000	So we've transformed
1041000	1042000	They've transformed
1042000	1044000	You know, you don't usually go 15 years
1044000	1046000	Being the exact same thing you were in the beginning
1046000	1048000	So, you know, just props to them
1048000	1050000	And we're all getting old
1050000	1053000	Crazy stuff
1054000	1057000	Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com
1057000	1059000	SSU100Matt says, shit, I feel old
1059000	1061000	I remember checking Bamante's style every day
1061000	1063000	Well, you could be doing that right now
1063000	1064000	They are still around
1064000	1065000	They're celebrating a birthday
1065000	1067000	So they're still doing their thing
1067000	1069000	It's just different than what it was in the beginning
1069000	1070000	You know, so
1070000	1073000	They just do a lot more news about, you know, the newer music games
1073000	1075000	Because there's still a lot
1075000	1077000	I'm gonna talk about my gaming week here in a moment
1077000	1079000	I've been playing some new music games
1079000	1081000	And I was kind of shocked
1081000	1083000	What I found here locally
1083000	1085000	So I'm gonna talk about that in just a minute
1085000	1087000	When we get to our gaming weeks
1087000	1089000	vidpower points out ddrfreak for ddr forums
1089000	1091000	Bamante's style for all other
1091000	1093000	Bamante game forums
1093000	1095000	Yeah, for sure
1095000	1097000	Totally
1097000	1099000	So, yeah
1099000	1101000	Congrats and happy anniversary to Bamante's style
1101000	1103000	So
1103000	1105000	One thing I wanted to ask about here at the top of the show
1105000	1107000	Before we get into our gaming weeks
1107000	1109000	What we have been playing this week
1109000	1111000	I just wanna ask you guys a little bit about
1111000	1113000	What haven't you been playing this week
1113000	1115000	Because, again, it's a slower time of year
1115000	1117000	There hasn't been as many game releases
1117000	1119000	I know we have Mario Kart 8, we've had a few big ones
1119000	1121000	But, um, what's your backlog
1121000	1123000	In gaming look like right now
1123000	1125000	What are the games you need to make it a point
1125000	1127000	To finish
1127000	1129000	Before things get crazy
1129000	1131000	Come September, October, November
1131000	1133000	What are, like, the biggest priorities
1133000	1135000	You're laughing at me, Loki
1135000	1137000	The joke is obvious
1137000	1139000	Your backlog is like 500 games
1139000	1141000	I'm sure
1141000	1143000	What are the biggest things
1143000	1145000	You're like, I need to get this done before
1145000	1147000	Even more shit comes out
1147000	1149000	To pile up the backlog
1149000	1151000	Since I'm just gonna steal the joke right here
1151000	1153000	The obvious answer would be my game
1153000	1155000	Okay, fair enough
1155000	1157000	I wasn't even coming for you
1157000	1159000	With that question
1159000	1161000	Okay, sure, fair enough
1161000	1163000	God, there's so many things
1163000	1165000	I have, I mean, even just strictly
1165000	1167000	PlayStation
1167000	1169000	I have a finished
1169000	1171000	Watch Dogs 2, Final Fantasy
1171000	1173000	15, um
1173000	1175000	Hell, there's so many games
1175000	1177000	I haven't even started yet that I have
1177000	1179000	Like Dragon Age Inquisition
1179000	1181000	Both Wolfenstein games
1183000	1185000	Crap, I don't know, there's like a ton of games
1185000	1187000	I have the original Watch Dogs 2 that I've never
1187000	1189000	Played, it's on a disc and never played
1189000	1191000	I have Destiny that I've never touched
1191000	1193000	How do you pick what you're gonna do first?
1193000	1195000	I usually
1195000	1197000	Buy something new
1197000	1199000	So in other words
1199000	1201000	You're full on admitting these games are never
1201000	1203000	Gonna get touched because I'm gonna end up buying something new
1203000	1205000	And it's just added to the mountain of games
1205000	1207000	Pretty much, yeah, I mean
1207000	1209000	There's uh
1209000	1211000	I don't know
1211000	1213000	There's a lot of stuff
1213000	1215000	My PlayStation 4 backlog is starting to
1215000	1217000	Look as bad as my
1217000	1219000	Steam backlog
1219000	1221000	DarkSakura, what about you?
1221000	1223000	I don't know if it's fair to say you're a little more
1223000	1225000	Pinky-choosey when it comes to games, but
1225000	1227000	Is your backlog as horrific as Loki's?
1227000	1229000	Danganronpa 2
1229000	1231000	I thought you already beat that
1231000	1233000	No, I'm almost done with it, but I put it off
1233000	1235000	To play other things
1235000	1237000	I still want to finish Ultra Despair Girls
1237000	1239000	They've just been on the back burner since
1239000	1241000	I was playing a couple other things
1241000	1243000	And right now
1243000	1245000	I'm playing stuff, but kind of taking a bit of a break
1245000	1247000	Just for
1247000	1249000	No mental recharge, I've got
1249000	1251000	A few other projects that have fallen on the side
1251000	1253000	That have fallen
1253000	1255000	On the side
1255000	1257000	Sorry, my voice went out
1257000	1259000	That's okay, it went into 911 operator
1259000	1261000	It went into 900 number operator mode for a minute there
1261000	1263000	Pick up the phone
1263000	1265000	Let's look at chat
1265000	1267000	Over at live.vognetwork.com
1267000	1269000	I'd like to hear from you guys as well
1269000	1271000	Stoppy says still haven't played through Hitman
1271000	1273000	Ugh, Lady JJ says
1273000	1275000	Tomb Raider Anthology on Mac
1275000	1277000	Rise of the Tomb Raider is still in my backlog
1277000	1279000	So that's a big one actually
1279000	1281000	Uh, Lissy Darktitsia says
1281000	1283000	I was in the middle of Jet Set Radio and Nights
1283000	1285000	On Steam
1285000	1287000	Stoppy says Mad Max I have for PS4
1287000	1289000	And I haven't touched it in months
1289000	1291000	Oh, Grand Theft Auto 5
1291000	1293000	There's another one on Grand Theft Auto Online
1293000	1295000	In my backlog Grand Theft Auto 5 for sure
1295000	1297000	Yeah, and Fallout 4
1297000	1299000	Well, at least I played a little bit of Fallout 4
1299000	1301000	Fallout 4 would also be in mine too
1301000	1303000	Because I never finished that
1303000	1305000	Yeah, no, I need to finish it
1305000	1307000	But, uh, yeah, I'm just, I'm horrible
1307000	1309000	At the Fallout games
1309000	1311000	But, yeah, I need to play that
1311000	1313000	But Grand Theft Auto 5 is definitely still there
1313000	1315000	Uh, yeah
1315000	1317000	Actdeftinchat says still haven't played Forza Horizon 3
1317000	1319000	Yes, we heard a little bit about that on Bobby's show tonight
1319000	1321000	But yes, Forza is in my backlog too
1321000	1323000	Uh, other big stuff in my backlog
1323000	1325000	Um, Zelda Breath of the Wild
1325000	1327000	I need to finish
1327000	1329000	I need to finish that, like, I was really into it
1329000	1331000	And then I, I
1331000	1334000	I don't know what happened, I felt like I was doing something wrong
1334000	1336000	But I really need to realize
1336000	1338000	In that game you can't do things wrong
1338000	1340000	Like, you can do whatever you want when you want
1340000	1342000	And I just have to get my mind out of that place
1342000	1344000	And I'll be able to go back and do it
1344000	1346000	Um, here's one that might kind of surprise you guys
1346000	1349000	Uh, Mass Effect Andromeda is in my backlog right now
1349000	1351000	I kind of stopped playing it
1351000	1358000	Um, when a lot of the talk about patching and changes and all that stuff was going on
1358000	1361000	I kind of painted myself in a corner in that game too
1361000	1364000	Because I felt like I screwed myself
1364000	1367000	And I'm not able to do the loyalty missions
1367000	1369000	Even though I'm close to the end of the game
1369000	1372000	So in my mind, whether this is logical or not
1372000	1374000	This is where my mind's going
1374000	1377000	My mind says the only way to fix this, Rob, is to start all over
1377000	1379000	And then couple that with
1379000	1382000	I had a really bad multiplayer experience
1382000	1384000	Because of fucking Origin
1384000	1386000	Where we got kicked from a match like seconds before the end of the match
1386000	1388000	And we'd used consumables and all this stuff too
1388000	1390000	Like, I got really frustrated
1390000	1391000	I was just like, fuck this game
1391000	1393000	And I just, I kind of walked away from it for a little while
1393000	1398000	And in reality, I still think Mass Effect Andromeda is a great game
1398000	1401000	And I need to just get over that kind of mental hump and go finish it
1401000	1406000	But then, you know, I get sucked into a good old thing like 14
1406000	1408000	Or Diablo 3 now
1408000	1410000	I've been actively trying to hunt down this platinum trophy
1410000	1412000	And it's like, that's great
1412000	1414000	But it's keeping me from playing all of these other games
1414000	1418000	So my backlog over there is just growing as well
1418000	1420000	What can I say? Let's see
1420000	1424000	VidPowerInChat over at live.vognetwork.com says
1424000	1430000	Pro tip, treat your backlog as more of an all-you-can-play buffet
1430000	1432000	Instead of a checklist
1432000	1434000	It's way less stressful this way
1434000	1436000	I like that, an all-you-can-play buffet
1436000	1440000	That's what PlayStation Now should be trying to brand its service as
1441000	1444000	Well I keep wanting to play Minecraft on my laptop
1444000	1448000	But apparently something corrupted my profile
1448000	1455000	And so it doesn't authenticate with Microsoft servers or something stupid like that
1455000	1459000	So I haven't purchased, technically twice, thank you Microsoft
1459000	1461000	And I can't download it
1461000	1464000	Because they're stupid
1466000	1468000	Alright, enough about backlogs
1468000	1470000	Let's talk about the current stuff
1470000	1472000	The types of video games that you've been playing this week
1472000	1474000	What have you been playing in a segment?
1474000	1476000	How was your gaming week?
1476000	1478000	Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?
1478000	1481000	Like I was saying, it hasn't been super eventful
1481000	1485000	But I've been playing some World of Warcraft and Mass Effect Andromeda
1485000	1488000	Not really too many other things
1488000	1492000	Except we did, well Dan actually repaired my old ColecoVision
1492000	1496000	And so there was some Mr. Do happening in Donkey Kong
1496000	1499000	Mr. Do is an underrated 80s classic
1499000	1500000	Fucking love Mr. Do
1500000	1502000	Yeah Mr. Do is a fucking rad game
1502000	1504000	It's like Dig Dug but not
1504000	1508000	And people don't seem to realize just how good the ColecoVision was for its time
1508000	1513000	It was kind of a powerhouse for itself
1513000	1516000	And you had really some of the best arcade versions at home
1516000	1518000	Short of having it on the computer versions
1518000	1523000	So it was really, except the controller is kind of shit
1523000	1527000	Man, is there a way to play Mr. Do legally on a modern console?
1527000	1531000	Like was it in any of those arcade repackaging things?
1531000	1533000	I don't think so
1533000	1536000	That's a classic I'd like to play again
1536000	1540000	But anyway, sorry Dark Soccer but I couldn't help but wonder that
1540000	1544000	Well and then of course Pokemon Go and Miitomo
1544000	1546000	Which actually I forgot to try today
1546000	1549000	So that's what I'm playing
1549000	1551000	For now
1551000	1553000	Awesome, we'll get to Loki in a minute
1553000	1557000	Oh is that that arcade Internet Archives thing?
1557000	1559000	Yeah it is, the latest thing they had in there
1559000	1562000	It was on the Wii Virtual Console in Japan
1562000	1564000	Why did Japan get all the good stuff?
1564000	1567000	Oh I forgot there was a Neo Geo version at one point too
1567000	1569000	There's Neo Mr. Do
1569000	1570000	Yes there is
1570000	1573000	That is kind of a different game though if you think about it
1573000	1575000	It is, it looks absolutely different
1575000	1579000	So wow, they didn't put it in any of those like the arcade classic
1579000	1581000	Yeah I guess not, interesting alright
1581000	1585000	Random 80s arcade game that I want to play again
1585000	1588000	Anyway, how about you Loki?
1588000	1590000	I didn't play a whole lot
1590000	1592000	It's just pretty much what's on my phone
1592000	1596000	Because I've been purposely avoiding playing games on consoles and stuff
1596000	1598000	Because I wanted to work on my games
1598000	1602000	Sort of happened and sorted it
1602000	1604000	I was just really tired this week
1604000	1606000	So like every time I sat down to work on it
1607000	1611000	You have to have more mental capacity than I had at the time
1611000	1613000	To actually be able to program stuff
1613000	1614000	So it was kind of annoying
1614000	1619000	But I did play more of that Office Space idle clicker game thing
1619000	1621000	Which is actually, it's kind of
1621000	1624000	It's entertaining because they do these like weekly challenge things
1624000	1627000	So it kind of mixes up the game almost every week
1627000	1630000	And so you can play that on top of your normal game as well
1630000	1634000	And it unlocks more of the consumable things that they have in the game
1634000	1637000	So you don't really have to spend real money on it
1637000	1638000	To kind of earn those things
1638000	1641000	And I kind of like that because it gives me a point to play it
1641000	1644000	Because there's actually a little bit of a challenge to try to unlock those things
1644000	1653000	So I don't find it as kind of like throwing the ads or consumables in your face
1653000	1655000	As much as some of the other games did
1655000	1657000	I mean they still have you watch a lot of ads
1657000	1660000	But usually it's just kind of whatever
1660000	1662000	Although there is an ad on there
1662000	1663000	Which I might mention
1663000	1666000	For like some mobile game that has like Pokemon in it and stuff
1666000	1667000	It's not Pokemon Go
1667000	1669000	It's like something I'm like
1669000	1673000	How is this not violating like IP left and fucking right
1673000	1675000	And they're advertising it in another game
1675000	1678000	It's not the official match 3 game that Pokemon has
1678000	1679000	Pokemon
1679000	1681000	I forget the name of it
1681000	1683000	There's another Pokemon game
1683000	1686000	It's not from like Nintendo or from the Pokemon company or something
1686000	1688000	It's from some other company I've never heard of
1688000	1690000	Thank you guys, Pokemon Shuffle says chat
1690000	1691000	No it's not Pokemon Shuffle at all
1692000	1693000	It's like some other thing
1693000	1696000	And it's like the actual title of the game
1696000	1697000	It sounds like a knock off
1697000	1698000	So I'm like
1698000	1699000	How the fuck
1699000	1701000	Like how fucking ballsy must you be
1701000	1703000	To literally advertise this game
1703000	1706000	With like violating copyright all over the place
1706000	1707000	In another game
1707000	1709000	I mean on Google services
1709000	1712000	Come on Google like wake up
1712000	1714000	So that was kind of interesting
1714000	1716000	And then the other thing I play of course is Pokemon Go
1716000	1719000	A little bit because they're doing that whole grass type event or whatever
1719000	1722000	So I've been trying to level up my grass type Pokemon
1722000	1726000	Shit I don't fucking see Bulbasaur anywhere normally
1726000	1728000	And now he's just like fucking all over the place
1728000	1729000	Like I literally was walking through
1729000	1730000	I haven't seen a one
1730000	1731000	A Bulbasaur
1731000	1732000	I'm seeing more
1732000	1733000	They're all over the place
1733000	1735000	Like I caught like 5 the other edges of the outlets
1735000	1736000	Just like in like 5 minutes
1736000	1738000	I'm seeing more Chikorita than I am Bulbasaur
1738000	1739000	Yeah
1739000	1740000	Myself
1740000	1741000	Yeah
1741000	1742000	But yeah that's what I've been doing
1742000	1744000	So just a little bit of that
1744000	1745000	I mean it's entertaining enough
1745000	1746000	I don't really
1746000	1748000	Like I'm not going hardcore into the game
1748000	1750000	I just more of like play it once a day
1750000	1751000	You know to get my daily stuff
1751000	1752000	And then that's it
1752000	1754000	But yeah I mean
1754000	1755000	I don't know
1755000	1756000	I look at games kind of
1756000	1758000	It's entertaining for what it is
1758000	1760000	I mean that's fine
1760000	1761000	I'm enjoying it
1761000	1763000	Not being sucked in like
1763000	1765000	I've got to play it like the other ones
1765000	1766000	It's more of like
1766000	1767000	Okay I got like 5 minutes
1767000	1769000	Let me just do this real quick
1769000	1770000	And then that's that
1770000	1771000	Yeah I mean
1771000	1774000	You know I've been playing Ingress myself this week
1774000	1775000	Which I know is the other game you're referring to
1775000	1777000	But I've tried to take a little bit more
1777000	1778000	Relaxed approach to Ingress
1778000	1779000	Turning off notifications
1779000	1780000	And that game was the best thing I could do
1780000	1782000	Possibly for just my own like
1782000	1785000	Just not getting so sucked into it or whatever
1785000	1786000	But you know funny enough
1786000	1788000	They're doing an event in Pokemon Go
1788000	1790000	But they're also doing one in Ingress right now
1790000	1791000	They just started
1791000	1792000	So it's like Niantic
1792000	1794000	Didn't really think this through for their servers
1794000	1797000	Because like the Ingress ones have been hurting
1797000	1799000	Like the game's been running really slow
1799000	1800000	Like when you try to deploy resonators
1800000	1803000	Like it's slow because the event is about
1803000	1804000	Deploying resonators
1804000	1805000	And they have a big
1805000	1806000	They have a special badge in the game right now
1806000	1807000	For resonator deploys
1807000	1809000	So it was funny to me that Niantic's running
1809000	1811000	Two different events at the same time
1811000	1813000	Now granted I'm sure the Pokemon Go and Ingress
1813000	1814000	Run on completely different servers and stuff
1814000	1817000	But still, still like it just seems like
1817000	1819000	Wow there's a lot happening right now
1819000	1820000	So anyway
1820000	1821000	Yeah
1821000	1823000	Okay so my gaming week since I started there
1823000	1825000	Let me talk about some other stuff
1825000	1829000	Okay so I didn't talk about this last week
1829000	1831000	I wanted to talk about this game last week
1831000	1833000	But we were a little pressed for time last week
1833000	1835000	Because we had an interview which was awesome
1835000	1837000	But I had to kind of roll this talk to this week
1837000	1839000	So there's a newer game out on PlayStation 4
1839000	1842000	That I played and I beat in the past week
1842000	1843000	Because this is one of those games
1843000	1845000	That's only gonna take you about three hours to beat
1845000	1847000	But it was a great three hours
1847000	1849000	The game is called What Remains of Edith Finch
1849000	1854000	So this is one of those walking simulator games
1854000	1856000	Although you know I hate that label
1856000	1857000	But everybody knows what I'm talking about
1857000	1858000	When I say that
1858000	1862000	I say more interactive story is what it really is
1862000	1864000	But if you haven't read much about it
1864000	1868000	It's basically about a girl that returns to a house in her family
1868000	1870000	And as she goes through the house she kind of learns the secrets
1870000	1872000	Or the stories about her family
1872000	1875000	And we'll leave it at that because I want to keep it relatively spoiler free
1875000	1877000	So like Gone Home it sounds like?
1877000	1878000	Not at all
1878000	1881000	Well no the story is nothing like Gone Home actually
1881000	1883000	The story is nothing like it
1883000	1886000	But the gameplay is a little bit like it
1886000	1889000	But here's the thing about Edith Finch
1889000	1892000	And again I'm really trying to keep this very spoiler free
1893000	1896000	There are sections of Edith Finch
1896000	1899000	Where I feel like there was more game to it
1899000	1902000	Like there was like a segment where you had to
1902000	1904000	Catch two things
1904000	1907000	Or you have to like go through the sequence again
1907000	1910000	So there were some more like arcadey type of sequences in it
1910000	1913000	Where you know Gone Home didn't really have any of that
1913000	1915000	So I do feel like even though
1915000	1917000	A lot of people are gonna write this game off as
1917000	1919000	Oh it's another one of those
1919000	1920000	There's no fucking game here
1920000	1922000	You just watch a story unfold in front of you
1922000	1925000	I do feel like Edith Finch is taking another step forward
1925000	1928000	In the genre to try to bring
1928000	1930000	Walking simulators and interactive stories
1930000	1932000	Forward a little more into
1932000	1934000	You know being the types of video games that
1934000	1936000	You know a lot of people think of when they think of video games
1936000	1938000	But I will say this as well
1938000	1940000	The story was very affecting
1940000	1941000	And there was some
1941000	1943000	There was some quite frankly like
1943000	1946000	Disturbing and difficult sequences to watch in the game
1946000	1948000	And again I'm trying to keep it spoiler free but there's just you know
1949000	1952000	There's some heavy stuff in the game
1952000	1955000	And so I kind of wasn't prepared for it
1955000	1956000	Like there was definitely a sequence
1956000	1958000	That like once it was over
1958000	1959000	And if you guys have played through the game
1959000	1961000	You're gonna know exactly what I'm fucking talking about
1961000	1964000	But I will say it is the
1964000	1966000	The
1966000	1969000	How do I say this without fucking ruining it
1969000	1971000	The bathtub sequence I'll leave it at that
1971000	1975000	So after that I had to just fucking like
1975000	1976000	I need a break
1976000	1979000	I need a break that was heavy
1979000	1981000	But the fact that a video game can kind of affect you like that
1981000	1984000	I think is you know says a lot about the game as well
1984000	1987000	And I did you know I was
1987000	1990000	I was satisfied with the resolution of the story
1990000	1992000	It has kind of a weird ending
1992000	1995000	And I will say that I saw the ending coming
1995000	1997000	About halfway through the game
1997000	2000000	But I was still okay with the journey to get there
2000000	2002000	So that's what I
2002000	2003000	Yeah that's what I liked
2003000	2006000	I overall it was you know a great experience
2006000	2008000	I really like these types of games
2008000	2012000	Especially you know as maybe I don't have the attention span
2012000	2013000	For video games that I used to
2013000	2017000	I really like these games that I can kind of like start and beat within a day
2017000	2019000	And I feel like it's really fulfilling
2019000	2022000	I think the trickiest part about this game
2022000	2024000	Is going to be that $20 price tag
2024000	2027000	After I just told you you're gonna beat it in three hours
2027000	2031000	And although you can replay sequences
2031000	2035000	I'm not sure there's a ton of replayability in a game like this
2035000	2039000	I mean maybe if you were into speed running it or something
2039000	2041000	There might be a little more in it for you
2041000	2044000	But I really think this is kind of a one and done type of video game
2044000	2047000	And so the $20 price tag may be a tough sell
2047000	2049000	Now that being said
2049000	2051000	Some of y'all have no problem
2051000	2055000	Buying a movie for 25, 30 bucks on blu-ray
2055000	2058000	Watching it one time and then putting it in your shelf somewhere
2058000	2061000	So on one hand
2061000	2065000	I kind of don't understand why people get really frustrated
2065000	2068000	With the price tags on video games
2068000	2071000	When it's really no different when it comes to movies
2071000	2072000	But on the other hand
2072000	2076000	Sure I mean there's so much variance when it comes to video game prices
2076000	2080000	That there are other games you could be spending $5, $10 on
2080000	2082000	That will give you hours and hours of enjoyment
2082000	2086000	It might be tough to convince you that $20 is worth it for three hours of this
2086000	2089000	That being said there probably will be a sale at some point
2089000	2092000	So maybe some of y'all will just hold out for the sale
2092000	2095000	But I think the game is definitely worth your time
2095000	2098000	And it was a story I enjoyed going through
2098000	2102000	Let's see go into our chat over at live.vognetwork.com
2102000	2104000	Rama in chat says beat in three hours
2104000	2106000	What about Final Fantasy Mystic Quest?
2106000	2109000	I don't remember that game taking only three hours
2109000	2112000	But the last time I played it I was like 12 or 13
2112000	2117000	So Dark Soccer do you remember how long was Mystic Quest of a game?
2117000	2119000	It's got to be more than three hours
2119000	2121000	It wasn't that long though
2121000	2123000	No it wasn't like a typical Final Fantasy
2123000	2124000	It wasn't really a Final Fantasy game
2124000	2125000	It really wasn't
2125000	2128000	It was Final Fantasy USA is what they released it as over series
2128000	2131000	Yeah I don't remember offhand what the original was
2131000	2132000	I'd have to look back up
2132000	2136000	But it was definitely RPG for small children
2137000	2140000	One other quick thing I want to say about Edith Finch
2140000	2145000	Is that I really loved some of the style that some of the stories were told through
2145000	2150000	Like Jamie I really think this might be a game you'd be into for some of the style
2150000	2151000	Some of that
2151000	2155000	I think some of the artistic direction in the game I think you'd be a big fan of
2155000	2157000	So it might be you know again it's 20 bucks
2157000	2159000	But when there's a sale or something you know I think it's worth
2159000	2161000	I don't know if it's on PC
2161000	2162000	I think it is
2162000	2164000	I don't think it's on Xbox it's only on PlayStation
2164000	2166000	But I think I heard it was on PC as well
2166000	2169000	Maybe somebody in our chat knows over at live.vognetwork.com
2169000	2173000	Bobby Blackwolf says Mystic Quest is a 12 to 15 hour game
2173000	2175000	Yeah I was going to guess it was more like 10
2175000	2178000	So yeah 12 to 15 sounds a little more right
2179000	2184000	Act Def points out I paid 40 dollars for Portal because of the orange box
2184000	2186000	And I can beat that game in an hour
2186000	2190000	I think Portal has a lot of replayability value to it though
2190000	2191000	At least I think so
2191000	2193000	You would agree with that though right Dark Soccer
2193000	2195000	That Portal has a lot of replayability to it
2195000	2196000	I mean yes
2196000	2198000	You know the answers to the puzzles and everything
2198000	2202000	But it's also one of those games where there's kind of more than one way to do it
2202000	2203000	Yeah
2203000	2206000	And you know just the story is really good in that game too
2206000	2208000	And there's also finding the secrets
2208000	2209000	Yes that's true
2209000	2210000	And in Portal 2 there's certainly a lot more
2210000	2211000	That's true
2211000	2213000	Alright so other games I've been playing this week
2213000	2216000	I've been playing a little bit of Heroes of the Storm
2216000	2221000	Which is Blizzard's Dota-esque or League of Legends-esque type of game
2221000	2225000	And obviously the reason I've been playing it if you follow Blizzard games at all
2225000	2228000	You can get Overwatch stuff right now by playing Heroes of the Storm
2228000	2231000	So there's a little group of us people that you sometimes hear on OLR
2231000	2233000	Like myself, Shane, Flaco Jones
2233000	2237000	And we've been playing Heroes of the Storm because if you play with friends
2237000	2241000	You unlock things in Overwatch
2241000	2244000	So the first week you just played five matches with a friend
2244000	2246000	And you got like a new Genji skin that was really cool
2246000	2247000	And you got some unlocks
2247000	2250000	And that was really easy because we just played against AI
2250000	2252000	And it was okay cool we did this
2252000	2256000	Well Blizzard said for weeks two, three, and four
2256000	2258000	You can no longer play against AI
2258000	2260000	You have to play against real people
2260000	2262000	And we were like ugh
2262000	2264000	The people in this game can be so toxic
2264000	2267000	But whatever we're just gonna suck it up and play
2267000	2269000	So we did
2269000	2271000	And actually we won
2271000	2273000	Like Shane and I played our last two games
2273000	2275000	Or my last two games last night
2275000	2277000	And we won both games
2277000	2279000	So I was like woohoo we can actually do this
2279000	2282000	But I think it's because there's a lot of other people who don't play Heroes of the Storm a lot
2282000	2284000	That are playing now to get the unlocks
2284000	2287000	So you kind of have like a lot of baddies playing the game right now
2287000	2290000	I do wish they didn't force you to play against other people though
2290000	2292000	Because I've also seen the side of this where
2292000	2294000	People are just teaming up in groups of five
2294000	2296000	And then letting the other team win
2296000	2298000	Like they're just we're just gonna hang at base
2298000	2299000	And you guys can just steamroll
2299000	2301000	We just won our D.Va skin
2301000	2305000	Because they have the whole South Korean police officer garb thing that D.Va can get
2305000	2307000	And her mech has a police siren on it and all this stuff
2307000	2309000	It's cute and if you're a D.Va player
2309000	2311000	Which you know she's awesome in Overwatch
2311000	2312000	You want this skin
2312000	2314000	So a lot of people play for that
2314000	2316000	And then week four is gonna be ten loot boxes
2316000	2321000	So I do kind of wish they would just let people get it from AI matches
2321000	2323000	Because you're gonna end up playing the game either way
2323000	2326000	So you're downloading it and you get those play stats on Blizzard
2326000	2328000	Which is what they want to go for
2328000	2330000	But you're not like forced to play with other people
2330000	2332000	And I just
2332000	2334000	You know I don't have a problem doing it
2334000	2336000	I'm not afraid of other people
2336000	2338000	Like you know oh darn we lost a match
2338000	2340000	I don't give a fuck we still get our skin
2340000	2342000	And if somebody is abusive to me
2342000	2344000	Blocked like it's not that hard
2344000	2346000	Blocked reported easy to do
2346000	2349000	And I have like low tolerance for that shit in those games
2349000	2351000	Like if somebody says something nasty
2351000	2353000	Blocked I just don't even acknowledge it or anything
2353000	2355000	I just block them
2355000	2357000	But I just
2357000	2360000	Let the nasty people all play their game together or whatever
2360000	2364000	And just let the people who want to steamroll for the skin just play AI or something
2364000	2365000	I don't know
2365000	2367000	Make them do AI on medium mode or something
2367000	2369000	I don't know what it is
2369000	2372000	Yeah actdeftinchat says good thing you only have to play not win
2372000	2374000	I really hope weeks 3 and 4
2374000	2376000	Blizzard's solution for this better not be
2376000	2379000	You have to win the matches now in order to get it
2379000	2381000	Because
2382000	2383000	That's just gonna be a fucking mess
2383000	2385000	People will figure out how to win trade
2385000	2386000	Mark my words
2386000	2387000	They're gonna win trade
2387000	2390000	And it's just gonna be bad for the Heroes of the Storm community if they do that
2390000	2392000	So I really hope they don't do that
2393000	2395000	And one other thing I want to talk about
2395000	2397000	So
2397000	2403000	Yesterday my pal Shane and I went to an arcade here in the area
2403000	2405000	It was the bowling alley out in Rockland
2405000	2407000	You guys know that place?
2407000	2411000	So that place has an arcade machine called Neon FM
2411000	2415000	Which speaking of this show being 15 years old
2415000	2417000	And Mamani style being 15 years old
2417000	2420000	I feel like development on that game started 15 years ago
2420000	2422000	Because I remember when that was gonna be a dance game
2422000	2424000	Remember that?
2424000	2426000	But the controller looked like Beatmania
2426000	2427000	But it was a dance pad
2427000	2428000	Girls Butts
2428000	2430000	Yes and there was the infamous Girls Butts song
2430000	2431000	Which is still there
2431000	2432000	And I refuse to play it
2432000	2434000	Because it's banned from my life
2434000	2436000	But that song aside
2436000	2438000	There's a lot of great songs in the game
2438000	2439000	There really are
2439000	2441000	If you're okay with Sir Mix-A-Lot singing about girls butts
2441000	2443000	It is different Loki
2443000	2445000	It is different and you know it
2445000	2447000	Anyway
2447000	2449000	So here's the thing
2449000	2452000	Neon FM is an iOS slash Android game now
2452000	2454000	So you can download that on your phone
2454000	2457000	And I played the machine before
2457000	2458000	They had it at MAGFest
2458000	2460000	So seeing the machine was not new
2460000	2462000	But what we saw in the app
2462000	2465000	Is that they actually have a list of arcades nearby
2465000	2467000	That have the actual Neon FM game
2467000	2468000	And that's how we saw
2468000	2470000	Oh they have one out in Rockland
2470000	2473000	We should go fucking play Neon FM in the arcade
2473000	2475000	And because at MAGFest
2475000	2476000	As fun as MAGFest is
2476000	2478000	I couldn't hear that fucking game
2478000	2479000	For shit at MAGFest
2479000	2481000	Because MAGFest is so loud
2481000	2483000	But we went to the arcade yesterday morning
2483000	2485000	Well morning-ish like noon
2485000	2487000	Which on a weekend is morning
2487000	2488000	So we went over there
2488000	2490000	And there wasn't really anybody there
2490000	2491000	We were like the only ones in the arcade
2491000	2493000	Maybe some kids playing some Ticket Spitter games
2493000	2494000	That was really it
2494000	2495000	And us we were playing Neon FM
2495000	2497000	So we were able to play it loud
2497000	2498000	And that was cool
2498000	2499000	Because we could actually like hear the songs
2499000	2500000	And I gotta say
2500000	2502000	You know that game was a lot of fun to play
2502000	2504000	Like obviously now it's a little more pop and music
2504000	2506000	It's probably the closest like Bimani game
2506000	2508000	But it does different things
2508000	2509000	Like I don't want to say it's a clone
2509000	2510000	It's not
2510000	2512000	Because I like that the grid
2512000	2513000	Where the notes fall
2513000	2515000	Will do different things
2515000	2516000	Based on the song
2516000	2519000	Like I was playing a chiptune sounding song
2519000	2520000	And all of a sudden
2520000	2522000	The grid turned into 8-bit looking notes
2522000	2523000	At one part of the song
2523000	2524000	And then there was another song
2524000	2526000	Where like the colors change
2526000	2527000	And all this stuff
2527000	2528000	So I thought that part was kind of cool
2528000	2530000	And what I thought they did
2530000	2531000	That was pretty neat
2531000	2533000	Is that they've really embraced
2533000	2535000	And I know we've brought this up on OLR before
2535000	2537000	But they've really embraced this whole fact
2537000	2539000	That you can log into the machine
2539000	2541000	Using your smartphone
2541000	2544000	So you scan a QR code on the machine
2544000	2545000	As you're picking your song
2545000	2547000	And they don't have time limits
2547000	2548000	When you pick your song
2548000	2549000	Thank god
2549000	2550000	You can just sit there and pick your song
2550000	2551000	However long it's gonna take
2551000	2552000	Once you pick your song
2552000	2554000	You only have 30 seconds to pick the difficulty
2554000	2556000	But you pick your song or whatever
2556000	2557000	So you can scan the QR code
2557000	2558000	You log into the machine
2558000	2559000	And then it knows it's you
2559000	2561000	And so it's linked to whatever you're playing
2561000	2562000	On your phone
2562000	2564000	And so you're building like one profile
2564000	2565000	Or whatever
2565000	2566000	So I thought that part was really cool
2566000	2569000	And you know the points that you earn and stuff
2569000	2571000	Can go for the in-game currency
2571000	2574000	That you use to play licensed music
2574000	2575000	In the phone version
2575000	2576000	So I thought that was really cool
2576000	2579000	And you can do multiplayer
2579000	2582000	Across iPhone and the arcade machine
2582000	2584000	And that's what the 30 seconds is for
2584000	2585000	Is that for those 30 seconds
2585000	2586000	Other players can join you
2586000	2588000	Unless you skip that out
2588000	2589000	But
2589000	2590000	Excuse me
2590000	2593000	But what we were able to do
2594000	2596000	We had Shane was playing the machine
2596000	2597000	He logged in
2597000	2598000	He picked his song
2598000	2600000	And as he was picking his song
2600000	2601000	I went on my phone
2601000	2603000	And I picked the same song
2603000	2605000	And so I hit start now
2605000	2606000	Because he picked a licensed song
2606000	2608000	I had to spend one of my in-game currency to do it
2608000	2609000	But it was fine
2609000	2610000	So as he was playing
2610000	2612000	I was able to play the exact same song
2612000	2614000	Behind him on my phone
2614000	2616000	And we were competing against each other basically
2616000	2617000	I lost big time
2617000	2618000	Because I'm sorry
2618000	2619000	You can't tap on your phone
2619000	2621000	The same way you can smack those big buttons
2621000	2623000	But I thought that was really fucking cool
2623000	2626000	That you could play the same music game
2626000	2628000	That the person is playing on the arcade
2628000	2630000	But you're doing it on your account
2630000	2631000	But you're playing
2631000	2632000	I just thought that was really cool
2632000	2633000	It reminded me of back in the day
2633000	2635000	When Para Para was a big music game
2635000	2636000	That everybody played
2636000	2639000	That people would mimic the dances
2639000	2641000	Behind the person that was actually doing the dancing
2641000	2643000	It kind of reminded me of that
2643000	2644000	So
2644000	2646000	Loki, if you haven't checked out Neon FM
2646000	2647000	I think that would be amazing to kick out of
2647000	2648000	Yeah
2648000	2649000	So
2649000	2650000	So
2650000	2651000	Yeah
2651000	2652000	ActDeftInChat says
2652000	2653000	That sounds pretty awesome
2653000	2654000	Yeah
2654000	2655000	It was neat to play through that
2655000	2656000	DrTouya says
2656000	2657000	I've done that
2657000	2658000	Played people in the arcade version on my phone
2658000	2659000	While I'm at home
2659000	2660000	Yeah
2660000	2661000	You can do that
2661000	2663000	So that's Neon FM's big selling point
2663000	2664000	So congrats to those guys
2664000	2665000	For finally getting their game out
2665000	2666000	All these years later
2666000	2667000	And
2667000	2668000	I would say it paid off
2668000	2669000	Because
2669000	2672000	I don't feel like I'm playing a 15 year old game
2672000	2674000	They've put a very new modern spin on it
2674000	2676000	With this whole linking the phones
2676000	2677000	To the arcade machine
2677000	2678000	So
2678000	2679000	Good job on you
2679000	2680000	Except
2680000	2681000	That girl's butt song is fucking terrible
2681000	2682000	And should be deleted from the game
2682000	2684000	That's the only read I'm going to give on that game
2684000	2685000	Otherwise
2685000	2686000	Neon FM did a good job
2686000	2687000	And there are a lot of great songs on it
2687000	2688000	There really are
2688000	2690000	Is girl's butts also in the
2690000	2691000	Or the mole version
2691000	2692000	The song list match
2692000	2693000	At least as far as I've seen
2693000	2694000	The exact same songs
2694000	2695000	Because it makes sense
2695000	2696000	Yeah
2696000	2697000	Yeah exactly
2697000	2698000	I mean there's still some unlocks
2698000	2699000	And they
2699000	2700000	They actually
2700000	2701000	Like when you play enough songs
2701000	2702000	It actually says
2702000	2703000	Coming on June 2nd
2703000	2704000	This song
2704000	2705000	Coming on June 19th
2705000	2706000	This song
2706000	2707000	So they're
2708000	2709000	I think that's kind of neat
2709000	2710000	So
2710000	2711000	Anyway
2711000	2712000	So yeah
2712000	2713000	I would give a shout out
2713000	2714000	For Neon FM
2714000	2715000	And check that out on your mobile devices
2715000	2716000	If you haven't already
2716000	2718000	But while I was at the arcade
2718000	2720000	I had no idea that this arcade
2720000	2721000	Was growing in music games
2721000	2722000	Because they had
2722000	2723000	We looked over and we were like
2723000	2725000	Oh it's a DDR Supernova
2725000	2726000	Whatever
2726000	2727000	And then when we give it a second look
2727000	2728000	We were like
2728000	2729000	Wait a minute
2729000	2730000	That's not Supernova
2730000	2731000	That's DDR
2731000	2732000	Whatever
2732000	2733000	Not Ace
2733000	2734000	2016
2734000	2735000	2016 or 15
2735000	2736000	Or whatever was before Ace
2737000	2738000	Is that the one that was like
2738000	2740000	Cross second mix or something like that?
2740000	2741000	No
2741000	2742000	It was after that before Ace
2742000	2743000	There was just
2743000	2746000	It was the DDR reboot
2746000	2747000	It was that game
2747000	2748000	So we were like
2748000	2750000	Oh they just put that in a Supernova cabinet
2750000	2753000	And then there was the brand new pump game
2753000	2754000	That like just came
2754000	2755000	Shane was like
2755000	2756000	Oh my gosh
2756000	2757000	It's the new pump game
2757000	2758000	He's a big fan of pump
2758000	2759000	He's like wow
2759000	2760000	This like just came out
2760000	2761000	And they have it here
2761000	2762000	That's crazy
2762000	2763000	But then here's the other thing
2763000	2764000	That caught our eye
2764000	2765000	And I was like
2765000	2767000	I thought this game never happened
2767000	2769000	They had an in the groove 3 cabinet
2769000	2771000	And I was like
2771000	2772000	Wait a minute
2772000	2773000	Because it didn't happen
2773000	2775000	In the groove 3 didn't fucking happen
2775000	2776000	Because Konami
2776000	2778000	That is a custom cabinet
2778000	2780000	That is a hell of a fucking custom cabinet
2780000	2782000	Because it has the signage
2782000	2783000	It has
2783000	2785000	It definitely has in the groove dance pads on it
2785000	2787000	That's running straight up step mania
2787000	2791000	And yeah it had 12,000 songs loaded on it
2791000	2793000	And no shit it's running step mania
2793000	2794000	Because I was like
2794000	2795000	Okay whatever
2795000	2796000	It's in the groove
2796000	2797000	I'm here to play Neon FM
2797000	2800000	And no shade against in the groove
2800000	2801000	And DDR and all that stuff
2801000	2802000	But the reality is
2802000	2804000	I'm 38 years old and I'm out of shape
2804000	2807000	I'm not gonna fucking dance in a public place
2807000	2809000	Because I can't do it like I used to
2809000	2810000	I can't do it like I used to
2810000	2811000	Neon FM is fine
2811000	2813000	That's a lot of songs to sort through
2813000	2814000	But then
2814000	2815000	So yeah I just was like
2815000	2816000	Okay whatever
2816000	2817000	Cool they have it
2817000	2818000	You know we were kind of like
2818000	2819000	Just didn't pay it a second mind
2819000	2820000	But then as we were playing Neon FM
2820000	2821000	Some other guy got up there
2821000	2822000	We kind of looked over
2822000	2823000	And I was like
2823000	2824000	Wait a minute
2824000	2825000	There's nothing but fucking DDR songs on it
2825000	2826000	I mean I just saw
2826000	2827000	1-2 Little Bitch
2827000	2828000	0-0-0-7
2828000	2829000	Like all the songs
2829000	2831000	That would be in a DDR fourth mix plus
2831000	2832000	And I was like
2832000	2833000	The fuck
2833000	2834000	And we kind of give it a second look
2834000	2835000	And we're like
2835000	2836000	Oh my god
2836000	2837000	This thing is like
2837000	2839000	This in the groove three
2839000	2840000	And then like Shane and I
2840000	2841000	Started to piece it together
2841000	2842000	We were like
2842000	2843000	Wait a minute
2843000	2844000	Wasn't in the groove three
2844000	2845000	The one where they kind of gave
2845000	2846000	That final F you to Konami
2846000	2848000	Right as they were getting sued
2848000	2849000	Where they opened up the USB stick
2849000	2851000	So you could load anything on it
2851000	2852000	Right
2853000	2854000	Nah it's just a step mini machine
2854000	2855000	Wow
2855000	2856000	That's all it is
2856000	2857000	So
2857000	2860000	I did not know those machines actually existed
2860000	2861000	And now that I've talked about it
2861000	2862000	Openly on a podcast
2862000	2863000	That many
2863000	2864000	Not many people
2864000	2865000	But some people listen to
2865000	2867000	Including some of the industry
2867000	2868000	Maybe that machine won't be there much longer
2868000	2869000	I don't know
2869000	2871000	Yeah they could get in pretty big trouble for
2871000	2872000	Don't
2872000	2873000	You guys don't
2873000	2874000	No
2874000	2875000	To those listening
2875000	2876000	Don't shut it down
2876000	2877000	Come on
2877000	2879000	It's not hurting anybody being there
2879000	2880000	You know what it's doing
2880000	2881000	It's reminding people
2881000	2883000	Of the glory days of 15 years ago
2883000	2884000	Just let it be
2884000	2885000	It's not fucking
2885000	2887000	Hurting sales of anything
2887000	2888000	So just like
2888000	2889000	Yeah because Rockstar can't sue
2889000	2890000	Because Rockstar's not there anymore
2890000	2893000	Konami might sue but you know
2893000	2895000	Let in the groove three be
2895000	2896000	Let it be at peace
2896000	2897000	Maybe
2897000	2898000	I don't
2898000	2899000	So that was weird
2899000	2900000	There must be something going on there
2900000	2901000	I fully expect
2901000	2903000	That we're gonna see
2903000	2904000	Kyle's new game
2904000	2905000	StepMania X
2905000	2906000	Or whatever
2906000	2907000	StepMania X
2907000	2908000	I fully expect that thing
2908000	2909000	Is gonna end up
2909000	2910000	At the same place
2910000	2911000	That's actually out in the wild
2911000	2912000	Because
2912000	2913000	Just based on the music games
2913000	2914000	I'm seeing there
2914000	2915000	I'm like
2915000	2916000	Okay
2916000	2917000	How weird to go to this arcade
2917000	2918000	And like the vast majority of it
2918000	2919000	Is ticket spitters
2919000	2920000	When we walked in there
2920000	2921000	We were like
2921000	2922000	Oh
2922000	2923000	That thing was a lie
2923000	2924000	There's not gonna be a fucking
2924000	2925000	Neon FM here
2925000	2926000	There's nothing but ticket spitters here
2926000	2927000	But in the back corner
2927000	2928000	It was like
2928000	2930000	Oh all these fucking music games
2930000	2931000	Right next to each other
2931000	2932000	There's room for more
2932000	2933000	Yes
2933000	2934000	Secret Club says
2934000	2935000	Act Deaf
2935000	2936000	Yes that's very true
2936000	2938000	Act Deaf says
2938000	2939000	This week's secret club
2939000	2940000	Is that
2940000	2943000	In the Groove StepMania machine
2943000	2944000	Very true
2944000	2945000	Very true
2945000	2946000	Alright
2946000	2947000	Orange Right says
2947000	2948000	I remember playing two of them in Reno
2948000	2950000	Not an ITG themed one
2950000	2951000	Two StepMania machines
2951000	2953000	You know
2953000	2955000	Maybe the software in it
2955000	2957000	Wasn't in the Groove 3
2957000	2959000	Maybe it was like that
2959000	2960000	DDR
2960000	2961000	You know
2961000	2962000	Cause I didn't take a second look
2962000	2963000	Maybe you're right
2963000	2965000	Maybe it wasn't really in the Groove 3
2965000	2966000	It just had the signage for it
2966000	2967000	It was just fucking
2967000	2968000	StepMania in a cabinet
2968000	2970000	It is StepMania in a cabinet
2970000	2972000	They have an In the Groove 3 theme
2972000	2974000	Now there's been some pretty awesome
2974000	2976000	Like In the Groove 3 skins
2976000	2977000	That people have done
2977000	2979000	Or like actual cabinets that people have made
2979000	2981000	I even went on to Wikipedia
2981000	2982000	Now here's it
2982000	2983000	For you Wikipedia folks
2983000	2984000	K
2984000	2986000	It says on Wikipedia
2986000	2988000	In the Groove 3 was cancelled
2988000	2990000	Due to such and such and such
2990000	2991000	It says it right there on Wikipedia
2991000	2993000	Bitch I just saw one
2993000	2995000	It was not
2995000	2996000	It happened
2996000	2997000	It happened
2997000	2998000	It happened somehow
2998000	3000000	But it's apparently this giant secret
3000000	3002000	Those pics didn't happen
3002000	3003000	You have to know
3003000	3005000	I fucking posted a picture on Twitter
3005000	3006000	Source that bitch
3006000	3007000	It happened
3007000	3009000	I would source my fucking Twitter
3009000	3010000	On Wikipedia
3010000	3011000	Do it
3013000	3014000	Anyway
3014000	3016000	D'Artesia says
3016000	3018000	I think In the Groove 3 was a fan thing
3018000	3019000	Maybe I don't know
3019000	3020000	I'm just saying
3020000	3022000	It was a convincing fucking cabinet
3022000	3024000	I you know I
3024000	3025000	It's not like
3025000	3026000	Kyle's a busy guy
3026000	3027000	But I'm sure he would answer an email
3027000	3028000	If I sent him a picture
3028000	3029000	And I'd be like
3029000	3030000	Explain this
3031000	3032000	Of course I don't want the response to be
3032000	3033000	Where was that
3036000	3037000	Anyway alright
3037000	3038000	That looks like a
3038000	3040000	Isn't that a solo machine cabinet
3040000	3041000	No that's not a solo machine
3041000	3042000	No the floor was In the Groove
3042000	3043000	I reckon
3043000	3044000	The floor
3044000	3045000	It's probably just an In the Groove machine
3045000	3047000	That they put new
3047000	3049000	It was a widescreen thing
3049000	3050000	It was not In the Groove
3050000	3051000	Fucking win in DDR cabinets
3051000	3052000	Okay
3052000	3053000	It's a custom cabinet
3053000	3054000	That someone made
3055000	3056000	Anyway
3056000	3057000	It's probably custom
3057000	3058000	Alright
3060000	3063000	I could just see the source on Wikipedia right now
3063000	3065000	Episode 685 Orange Lounge Radio
3065000	3067000	Bitch I'm looking right at one
3067000	3068000	I just like
3068000	3069000	I love the
3069000	3071000	Wait In the Groove 3 happened?
3071000	3072000	The emoji's like
3072000	3073000	Wait a second
3073000	3074000	Let me think about this
3074000	3075000	That's cause that's what I thought
3075000	3076000	I was like wait a minute
3076000	3077000	I'm confused
3077000	3079000	Wikipedia told me it was cancelled
3079000	3080000	I'm looking right at it
3082000	3083000	TigerClodChat says
3083000	3086000	Sounds like In the Groove 3 is this year's polybus
3087000	3088000	Possibly
3088000	3089000	Act Def says
3089000	3091000	Looking at the photo it kind of looks like a pump it up machine
3091000	3092000	Okay
3092000	3094000	Wasn't there a pump it up
3094000	3097000	That was In the Groove infused
3097000	3099000	And it was four panel
3099000	3100000	Not five
3100000	3101000	Or am I crazy
3101000	3102000	I
3102000	3103000	Okay I realized that the steps
3103000	3104000	You can't see in the picture
3104000	3105000	I didn't
3105000	3107000	I should have thought to include the whole fucking thing
3107000	3108000	But the steps
3108000	3110000	Were an In the Groove dance thing
3110000	3112000	Because it was like those orange blue arrows
3113000	3114000	That you see in In the Groove
3115000	3116000	So that's what it was
3116000	3117000	It was not a five panel like pump
3117000	3118000	It was a four panel
3118000	3119000	They can custom make that stuff though
3119000	3120000	Maybe
3120000	3121000	Cause it's just a cabinet
3121000	3122000	And then you get like a DDR panel
3122000	3123000	You know eight
3123000	3124000	Or you know
3124000	3125000	Sixteen panel
3125000	3126000	Not sixteen panel
3126000	3127000	Eight panel
3128000	3129000	Set up stage or whatever
3129000	3131000	And you just replace the arrows out of it
3131000	3132000	Alright
3132000	3133000	Alright we've talked
3133000	3135000	We talked a long time about this
3137000	3138000	I'm ready to move on
3138000	3139000	But I just
3139000	3140000	You know as a long time music game fan
3140000	3141000	It was
3141000	3142000	It was
3142000	3143000	It was that poly bus moment of
3143000	3144000	Wait a minute
3144000	3145000	What
3145000	3146000	What the fuck is this doing here
3146000	3147000	Especially
3147000	3148000	Here
3148000	3149000	Like not the bay area
3149000	3150000	Not Seattle
3150000	3152000	I would have fully expected to see one in Seattle
3152000	3153000	Cause that's where all that
3153000	3154000	Stuff started
3154000	3155000	But um
3155000	3156000	Here
3156000	3157000	Like what
3157000	3158000	Anyway it was weird
3158000	3159000	Anyway
3159000	3161000	Maybe I'll get an email or tweet about it this week
3161000	3163000	Say Rob I wish you hadn't talked about that but
3163000	3164000	Sorry
3164000	3165000	Well you know what
3165000	3166000	I'm sorry
3166000	3167000	If you didn't want anybody
3167000	3168000	Nobody
3168000	3169000	You don't put it in the middle of a fucking arcade
3169000	3170000	Yes
3170000	3171000	I might be
3171000	3173000	What did you think was gonna fucking happen
3173000	3174000	I mean
3174000	3175000	As I said
3175000	3176000	The powers that be in the legal folks out there
3176000	3177000	Just
3177000	3178000	It's not hurting anybody
3178000	3179000	In fact
3179000	3180000	I was
3180000	3181000	It made me smile
3181000	3182000	To be like
3182000	3183000	If I wanna go fucking play
3183000	3184000	Conga feeling
3184000	3185000	Or some of those old things
3185000	3186000	Cause all the
3186000	3187000	Cause I'll tell you what
3187000	3189000	Down the street at Roseville Golf Land
3189000	3191000	That Max 2 machine needs to be euthanized
3191000	3193000	It needs to be taken out back to the barn
3193000	3194000	And shot in the
3194000	3195000	It just
3195000	3196000	It needs to be killed
3196000	3197000	Because it is
3197000	3198000	It is horrific
3198000	3199000	In horrific shape
3199000	3200000	So I can only imagine
3200000	3202000	There's probably very few number of fourth mix
3202000	3203000	And fourth mix plus out there
3203000	3205000	That are still in good shape
3205000	3206000	Like
3206000	3207000	Probably private owners
3207000	3208000	That take good fucking care of them
3208000	3209000	But like
3209000	3210000	Things that have been out there
3210000	3211000	In the arcades and stuff
3211000	3212000	They're
3212000	3213000	They're
3213000	3214000	They're all gonna be hurting
3214000	3215000	So you know what
3215000	3216000	I'm glad that
3216000	3217000	It lives on
3217000	3218000	Through this
3218000	3219000	So it made me happy so
3219000	3221000	And just give it another season of wet feet
3221000	3222000	From you know
3222000	3223000	The water slides
3223000	3225000	Slopping all over the Max 2 machines
3225000	3226000	Well luckily
3226000	3227000	Luckily a bowling alley
3227000	3228000	Doesn't have that problem
3228000	3229000	Alright
3229000	3230000	Alright
3230000	3231000	Oh
3231000	3232000	Pump it up prime
3232000	3233000	Says act deft
3233000	3235000	And actually links me to a picture
3235000	3237000	Of pump it up prime
3237000	3240000	See but the floor's different
3240000	3242000	The screen looks
3242000	3244000	No but the screen didn't say pump it up on it
3244000	3245000	Look at my picture
3245000	3247000	It didn't say pump at the bottom
3247000	3248000	So
3248000	3249000	But yes
3249000	3250000	Pump it up prime
3250000	3251000	Was the one that was in the
3251000	3252000	Alright I don't know
3252000	3253000	You know what
3253000	3254000	I'm just gonna fucking email Kyle
3254000	3255000	Alright
3255000	3256000	This is a custom camera man
3256000	3257000	I'm just gonna fucking do it
3257000	3258000	Alright
3258000	3259000	Let's get into it
3259000	3260000	Let's talk about
3260000	3262000	What's been going on in gaming

3294000	3295000	Participate at
3295000	3296000	Orange Lounge Radio dot com
3296000	3298000	And we're really just trying to
3298000	3299000	Promote and get out there
3299000	3300000	So we would love to come on
3300000	3301000	Your show
3301000	3302000	Um
3302000	3303000	Let's get started with some
3303000	3304000	Gaming news for the week
3304000	3305000	Loki
3305000	3306000	Yes
3306000	3308000	So apparently the Oculus
3308000	3309000	Um
3309000	3310000	What was it
3310000	3311000	Oculus story studio
3311000	3312000	Has
3312000	3313000	Closed down
3313000	3315000	Now the Oculus story studio
3315000	3316000	If you're not familiar with that
3316000	3318000	Was supposed to be releasing
3318000	3320000	Some VR enhanced
3320000	3321000	Um
3321000	3322000	Movies
3322000	3323000	So they had three that they had
3323000	3324000	Worked on and released
3324000	3327000	Lost Henry and Dear Angelica
3327000	3329000	And you know they had some
3329000	3331000	Big name stars doing the voices
3331000	3332000	In these movies as well
3332000	3334000	But I guess according to
3334000	3335000	Um
3335000	3337000	The Oculus VP of content
3337000	3338000	Jason Rubin
3338000	3339000	Um
3339000	3340000	They're still looking to film
3340000	3341000	VR projects
3341000	3342000	But
3342000	3343000	You know ongoing projects
3343000	3344000	From the Oculus story studio
3344000	3345000	Have been cancelled
3345000	3347000	And of course the three
3347000	3349000	That have been released so far
3349000	3350000	Are still on the store
3350000	3351000	They're not going to be
3351000	3353000	Delisted or anything like that
3353000	3354000	So
3354000	3355000	Yeah
3355000	3356000	That's um
3356000	3358000	That's unfortunate
3358000	3359000	But I guess it makes sense
3359000	3360000	Because there's not a lot of
3360000	3361000	Eyes hitting that stuff right now
3361000	3363000	I mean you're talking about
3363000	3364000	You know people that have
3364000	3365000	VR
3365000	3366000	You know headsets and stuff
3366000	3367000	On the Oculus
3367000	3369000	Which is a closed store front
3369000	3370000	And then people that are going to
3370000	3371000	Be interested in actually
3371000	3372000	Viewing these
3372000	3373000	Like movies
3373000	3374000	That's a really small market
3374000	3376000	That you're hitting right there
3376000	3377000	It's just
3377000	3379000	Maybe when it's more mainstream
3379000	3380000	Bobby and I were talking about
3380000	3382000	This in one of our chats earlier
3382000	3383000	Um
3383000	3384000	And he said he's actually seen
3384000	3385000	Those movies
3385000	3386000	And that they were
3386000	3387000	They were good
3387000	3388000	So
3388000	3389000	It's kind of
3389000	3390000	Kind of a bummer to see it go
3390000	3391000	But that's a really
3391000	3392000	High caliber of talent
3392000	3393000	Which tells me
3393000	3394000	It's expensive talent
3394000	3395000	So this probably wasn't a cheap
3395000	3396000	Endeavor
3396000	3397000	By
3397000	3398000	Especially
3398000	3399000	If the quality of the films
3399000	3400000	Ended up being good too
3400000	3401000	I mean it was probably
3401000	3402000	It probably cost them to do it
3402000	3403000	So you know
3403000	3404000	Again
3404000	3405000	You gotta make money
3405000	3406000	Right
3406000	3407000	So if they just weren't selling
3407000	3408000	Enough
3408000	3409000	To justify it
3409000	3410000	Then
3410000	3411000	They gotta do what they gotta do
3411000	3412000	But
3412000	3413000	It may be just something that's
3413000	3414000	Before it's time
3414000	3415000	Yeah
3415000	3416000	And that could be the case too
3416000	3417000	And you know they do say they're
3417000	3418000	Looking at
3418000	3419000	You know funding
3419000	3420000	Other VR film projects
3420000	3421000	So
3421000	3422000	Maybe
3422000	3423000	Maybe it's just something
3423000	3424000	The indie scene is gonna have to
3424000	3425000	Pick up and run with
3425000	3426000	I don't know
3426000	3427000	I'm still surprised though
3427000	3428000	We haven't had that
3428000	3429000	Well
3429000	3430000	Maybe this is out there
3430000	3431000	And I'm just not aware of it
3431000	3432000	Because I'm not an Oculus owner
3432000	3433000	And I don't use
3433000	3435000	You know a lot of the VR stuff
3435000	3436000	Yet
3436000	3437000	But
3437000	3438000	We're finally getting a
3438000	3439000	Gear VR in the house
3439000	3440000	Because
3440000	3441000	When Alan bought his phone
3441000	3442000	They were running a promotion
3442000	3443000	Or whatever
3443000	3444000	Because he got one of those new
3444000	3445000	SAs or whatever
3445000	3446000	Yeah I have no idea
3446000	3447000	Yeah he got a
3447000	3448000	Thing of that
3448000	3449000	So
3449000	3451000	I'm surprised that Facebook
3451000	3453000	Hasn't injected more VR
3453000	3454000	Into the news feed yet
3454000	3455000	I know
3455000	3456000	Like some of it's there
3456000	3457000	I see like 360 video
3457000	3458000	So I'm
3458000	3459000	What
3459000	3460000	I'm sure you could put that on
3460000	3461000	An Oculus headset
3461000	3462000	And you could see the 360 video
3462000	3463000	But I feel like
3463000	3464000	Isn't that the direction
3464000	3465000	Where Facebook wants to be
3465000	3467000	When they're shoving that video
3467000	3468000	Stuff down your throat
3468000	3469000	And they're really trying to
3469000	3470000	Like so and so is life
3470000	3471000	Like
3471000	3472000	There's gonna be a time
3472000	3473000	Yeah but I don't think
3473000	3474000	When
3474000	3476000	There's gonna be a time when
3476000	3478000	You don't have to strand yourself
3478000	3479000	On a desert island
3479000	3481000	To go see the fire festival
3481000	3484000	You could see it live in VR
3484000	3485000	Maybe that
3485000	3486000	Maybe that's how
3486000	3488000	Fire Festival 2018
3488000	3489000	Will happen
3489000	3490000	It's from the safety
3490000	3491000	Of your own damn home
3491000	3492000	Because we can't figure out
3492000	3493000	How to you know
3493000	3494000	Build a temporary home
3494000	3495000	From the safety of your home
3495000	3496000	In VR
3496000	3497000	Fully in VR
3497000	3498000	On
3498000	3499000	Oculus Rift
3499000	3500000	Although
3500000	3501000	Obviously
3501000	3502000	You don't want that fucking name
3502000	3503000	Anywhere near your product
3503000	3504000	Right now
3504000	3505000	Honestly
3505000	3506000	The fire festival is like
3506000	3508000	The beginning of a
3508000	3509000	Horror action movie
3509000	3510000	Or a thriller
3510000	3511000	Or something like that
3511000	3513000	Where you trick all these people
3513000	3514000	And they're going on
3514000	3515000	To a deserted island
3515000	3517000	And then there's some
3517000	3518000	Fight to the death
3518000	3519000	I mean that's really
3519000	3520000	Really pieces of
3520000	3521000	Sort of missing from
3521000	3522000	That survivor
3522000	3523000	The Hunger Games type thing
3523000	3524000	You know
3524000	3525000	It's like
3525000	3526000	Oh shit we got on this island
3526000	3527000	To go see this festival
3527000	3528000	It's like
3528000	3529000	Was it Blink 182
3529000	3530000	Or something like that
3530000	3531000	Was that
3531000	3532000	Was that
3532000	3533000	Was that
3533000	3534000	Was that

7478000	7491000	I saw a cannon that shot cannons. So that was kind of fun. A cannon that shoots cannons. A cannon that shot cannons, yeah.
7491000	7504000	So it is kind of unfortunate that they are taking that. Basically it says you don't need to buy. They found a way around the bands as well.
7504000	7512000	You basically own two consoles. You don't need to buy a new console each time you get banned. If you have two consoles you can get around this an infinite number of bands using the system transfer option.
7512000	7518000	And apparently that's how he's gotten around the bands. He's been banned twice. But that's kind of funny.
7518000	7524000	Would you like to know why they are no longer updating Super Mario Maker?
7525000	7532000	Probably because it's coming out on the Switch. Mario Maker Deluxe is going to fucking happen on the Switch. Let's say first quarter next year.
7532000	7544000	And it will include the skins from Super Mario All Stars. I can't say Mario 2 because Mario 2 is a very different game because of the whole fact that it was created from the Japanese game.
7544000	7550000	But they could create some items from Mario 2 or something. They could. You can have the stackable mushrooms or something like that.
7550000	7556000	But Mario All Stars would be perfect. Mario All Stars would be perfect because those sprites already exist.
7556000	7562000	And they could just. Especially from the original Mario. They could just put them right in there. And that will be Mario Maker Deluxe.
7562000	7570000	And a few new items. A few new things. And that will be Mario Maker Deluxe on the Switch. Because this whole. The fact that Mario Kart 8 sold as well as it did.
7571000	7580000	Here we go. Open them fucking floodgates because here come the Wii U ports on Switch. But you know what? Honestly. Mario Kart 8 is pretty fucking good actually.
7580000	7587000	So I. And if it means Bayonetta 2 gets another chance. I can't hate on this.
7587000	7597000	But I understand that. But I own Mario Kart 8. And I just have trouble justifying the system to play Mario Kart 8 that has Battle Mode in it.
7597000	7605000	Because you know what? You can't fucking tell me that the Wii U can't handle Battle Mode. It fucking had Battle Mode in there.
7605000	7611000	And you know what? It's a god damn insult that they're not updating the Wii U version to go along with that.
7611000	7617000	I'm sorry. It's insulting that. Oh well you know we made this really cool thing that we really should have done in the beginning.
7617000	7621000	But guess what? You're gonna pay to get another $60 for it. You know what? Fuck them. That's what I'm saying.
7621000	7628000	Seriously? Fuck them in this. Oh hey yeah we could fix these problems. But fuck you guys. Buy our new system.
7628000	7636000	That's not how it's gonna work. And you know why fucking Mario Kart 8 sold so well? Because there's no fucking games on the god damn system. It's the next biggest game.
7636000	7642000	Disagree. Disagree. Mario Kart 8 sold well because for most people that aren't you or me. It's their first Mario Kart 8.
7642000	7647000	Because a lot of people skipped the fucking Wii U. That's. That's what it is. That's why Mario Kart 8 sold.
7647000	7653000	I doubt it. I think it's really just the next big game that's from Nintendo that's on that platform. And that's why it's released on there.
7655000	7664000	I'm sorry. It's not because it's the first Mario Kart game for them. Because you can't tell me that these people didn't have like Mario Kart 7 or any of the other games.
7665000	7671000	It's their first Mario Kart 8. Because most people didn't buy the Wii U. So this is their first Mario Kart 8.
7671000	7677000	And they're like wow this game is fucking feature filled right off the bat because they skipped Mario. They skipped the Wii U completely.
7677000	7685000	That's nice that they have a feature filled game. I wish I could get that because I paid the same $60 and actually more than that because I supported them with their DLC.
7685000	7691000	So where's my fucking reward for my loyalty? Oh that's right. Fuck you. Buy our $400 system with another game.
7692000	7698000	Alright. Here's a game that I don't think is planned for the Switch. I don't remember the original Kickstarter.
7698000	7707000	But this team called No Matter is making a game called Pray for the Gods. It was a kickstarted action RPG and get this.
7707000	7713000	They've had to change the name this week because it was called P-R-E-Y for the gods. Pray for the gods.
7713000	7722000	Well you may have missed this week or maybe you didn't miss. Bethesda released a game called Pray this week which was an update to a game.
7722000	7727000	Although I don't think the games really have that much in common. Name only that's it.
7727000	7734000	Yeah like is it still like to be fair I have not played the new Pray but I beat the old Pray.
7734000	7737000	The new Pray is nothing like the old Pray at all.
7737000	7739000	So like the Native American themes and all that are gone?
7739000	7745000	Nope. It's not even in there. You like take the forms of different things. Like you can jump in.
7745000	7752000	It has more to do. It reminds me of like what was that game. It was. It had a fucking cherub in it.
7752000	7758000	And I'm trying to remember what the hell it was called. It was. Oh god. I can't remember what it's called now.
7758000	7763000	But they had like a. There was a cherub in it. You could take control of different people and stuff.
7764000	7770000	DungeonBuster in chat says the new Pray is more like Bioshock in space. That's not the first person I've heard say that basically.
7770000	7774000	But anyway so Pray is out obviously but now you've got this other game Pray for the Gods.
7774000	7782000	And so they got basically threatened with legal stuff from Zenimax Bethesda over the trademark.
7782000	7786000	So you may remember. This is not the first time Bethesda has done this.
7786000	7792000	Do you remember when they threatened against Mojang because they were doing a game called Scrolls.
7792000	7795000	And they were going to do. You know obviously Bethesda.
7795000	7799000	I don't understand how they get the trademark for such a common name in the first place.
7799000	7801000	That's a great fucking question.
7801000	7805000	I mean that is stupid. It's a single name. It's very commonly used.
7805000	7809000	And like the fact that they're going after other games. They have nothing to fucking do with it.
7809000	7810000	Ahem. Saga.
7810000	7815000	Exactly. It's our fucking trademark and copyright system is so goddamn messed up.
7816000	7820000	But what's interesting because Notch had all that Minecraft money. He did fight Zenimax in court.
7820000	7823000	But they did. They settled. They didn't actually go to court.
7823000	7828000	They did use. Mojang got to use the name Scrolls but they could not own the trademark for it.
7828000	7832000	But Scrolls never really came. I mean it was in beta. They did like a free beta.
7832000	7836000	That's as far as that game ever got. Like they never really did a full release that game.
7836000	7840000	This has nothing to do with it. It's like Fighter. Or like you know what the what they.
7840000	7842000	Which is what all the games.
7842000	7843000	It's like copywriting the.
7843000	7849000	Okay but back in the day. Like on the Atari 2600. That's what those fucking games were called.
7849000	7854000	You had Boxing. Pitfall. Adventure.
7855000	7857000	Like these were the games.
7857000	7863000	Exactly. You like but I'm surprised that they get that kind of a copyright. They get the trademark for Prey.
7863000	7869000	It's such a commonly used name. I mean it's just a word. It's one word.
7869000	7878000	And you're telling me that like all these other games that that word is off limits now because of fucking Bethesda and their shitty game. Fuck that.
7878000	7887000	Well they have had to change the name to the new name of the game is Prey for the gods. It is P R A E Y for the gods.
7887000	7890000	That's stupid. It's fucking dumb.
7890000	7894000	I don't blame the developer for that. I kind of credit them.
7894000	7905000	No I blame Bethesda for this because the reason why you would file a lawsuit like this is because that there could be some confusion between Prey their game and Prey this game and pray for the gods.
7905000	7914000	It's like totally different. You look at the two games are fucking completely different. There's nothing similar about them other than they work on game. They probably both on PC.
7915000	7924000	What's interesting though is that in the developer update they actually mentioned that one of the games. One of the names they were originally considering was P R A E Y for the gods.
7924000	7931000	But that A and E was that special character where the A and E are linked. Darsagre you know more about writing than I do.
7931000	7937000	Yeah. What do you call that when the A and E are linked together. It's like it's a specific alphabet like it's a Greek character.
7937000	7943000	Give me a moment because I know it's not a ligature. That is not a ligature. Hold on.
7943000	7952000	Okay. But here's the thing is that that A and E as a combined letter you can't Google that. I mean you can but you can't. People aren't going to do it.
7952000	7955000	So now they're just going to call it P R A E Y.
7955000	7967000	Actually it was originally a ligature and then it became its own letter coming actually from classic Greek and Latin and also used in Old English.
7967000	7976000	Why are they suing Fallout Boy? I might confuse Fallout Boy with a fucking post apocalyptic RPG because that's certainly fucking similar.
7976000	7981000	Well Fallout Boy needs to be sued for a lot of reasons. I'm just kidding. I'm just hating for no reason.
7982000	7989000	You know why they did it? Because they're small. They're a big company and that's a small company and they can fucking get away with it. Those fucking assholes.
7989000	7991000	It's called an ash by the way.
7991000	7993000	They're an ash. Thank you.
7993000	8004000	Because Fallout Boy is in the name of a video game. You know what? Blackfall I understand that but this game has nothing to fucking do with their game other than the name and the name is not even the same.
8004000	8010000	They both make digital disc media. Fallout Boy makes CDs.
8010000	8012000	And a Playstation is a computer.
8012000	8016000	Vault Boy is in there. I mean Fallout Boy, Vault Boy.
8016000	8017000	Alright.
8017000	8019000	It's a boy that's in Fallout.
8019000	8022000	I need a pallet cleanser. This is getting too heated. Alright moving on.
8022000	8025000	Dark Sakura take us away. Take us somewhere else.
8025000	8026000	How about Andromeda?
8026000	8028000	How about space? Yes.
8028000	8033000	So um mods have finally legitimately happened in Mass Effect Andromeda.
8033000	8039000	There is a new mod tool and I have already downloaded the best of all possible mods called Shut Up Sam.
8039000	8046000	Where you know how every time you go into like it's really hot. The weather has increased.
8046000	8050000	Okay thank you. It's fucking cold on vault. Duh.
8050000	8052000	Or there's radiation. Duh.
8052000	8054000	It happens every- Sam doesn't shut up.
8054000	8059000	So the first mod I downloaded was one where Sam shuts the fuck up.
8059000	8068000	Um but there is um there's a few other ones out there too and there's full installation um instructions on uh the nexus.
8068000	8069000	For nexus mods.
8069000	8077000	Um and there's even um one that helps you back up and recover your game with how it was and you know before.
8077000	8086000	There's also like external mods that they did have out that honestly just about every game has had out those like cinematic and color pallet adjusting ones.
8086000	8094000	But now um they finally they also have one that lets you use like any skin color in uh no matter what default that you choose.
8094000	8101000	Um how to change your outfits. It's gonna it's not gonna be too long before we have uh custom elements in there too.
8101000	8104000	It didn't take them you know terribly long for Dragon Age.
8104000	8107000	So let's just say it. The mods are there.
8109000	8112000	Go forth and mod. Go forth and mod.
8112000	8115000	So full booby rider? Is that?
8115000	8118000	There actually is um a naked mod.
8118000	8121000	Of course there is! That's always one of the first.
8121000	8124000	That's like a prerequisite. Modding yeah.
8124000	8128000	Your game hasn't made it till somebody put boobies and dong in it.
8128000	8133000	I'm still looking for that inquisition mod that restores the iron bull to his former glory.
8133000	8135000	You knew about that right?
8135000	8136000	No I didn't.
8136000	8141000	They apparently modded his dick. Not modded um they uh modeled it.
8141000	8151000	And then when it was about ready to publish it finally got caught so now it's a big black rectangle where his junk is.
8151000	8159000	And if you go look like Flycam stuff I'll find it but yeah it's the the big black box.
8159000	8164000	Sorry guys they're telling me live that my mic cut out for 30 seconds when I didn't do it.
8164000	8169000	There's no power switch on these mics so it must be something like I reset my connection here.
8169000	8174000	Uh but I wouldn't be surprised at how much these mics get handled. There's some shorted wire or something.
8174000	8178000	It's been a while since we've replaced all these mics and that that might be coming soon.
8178000	8183000	I don't know these are the ones that uh Brad from Pod Culture so kindly passed down to us.
8183000	8187000	So that means he used them then we used them. These mics are probably on their last legs.
8187000	8195000	So we just might we might have to spend some money that I don't have to uh to to modernize this fucking studio.
8195000	8199000	That might be a project. That's why I'm going to keep screaming streaming screaming onto it.
8199000	8205000	I'll scream as I stream on Twitch uh to raise money to uh redo all our studios.
8205000	8206000	That'll be funny.
8207000	8209000	Alright anyway.
8210000	8212000	Tigerclaw says yeah you need some better quality mics.
8212000	8213000	I'm putting it in the chat by the way.
8213000	8216000	You know what? We do the best we can.
8216000	8219000	There you go. There's naked Iron Bull.
8219000	8223000	Hooray. Alright just a couple more stories for you guys and then we'll get your calls.
8223000	8229000	Let's see how shitty your mics sound on Skype at Orange Lounge Radio. All one word on Skype. Loki.
8229000	8240000	Alright so like many modern uh video games that are out um they have finally added in the Horizon Zero Dawn a selfie mode.
8240000	8249000	That's right you can take different poses um or take photos of different poses that Aloy can make in the game and add little tidbits and stuff to it.
8249000	8258000	For example um you can you know form Aloy's hands into the shape of a heart or she can be lounging on her back or several different face expressions.
8258000	8264000	You can add filters. You can even put like a postcard greetings from blah blah blah you know type thing in there.
8264000	8271000	So that is available um I guess they're going to be coming soon with some more updates along with that.
8271000	8280000	But yeah I mean it makes sense now that a lot of games have done that and it really kind of helps drive the awareness on social media for them.
8280000	8289000	Like Grand Theft Auto. I think Grand Theft Auto 5 was probably one of the first ones that really did that heavily in there as like a kind of an in game feature so.
8289000	8291000	Yeah cool.
8292000	8295000	Yeah and uh the selfie mode in Zelda was always the one.
8295000	8300000	Or actually you know they also did that in Infamous Second Son I think.
8300000	8301000	That's right they did.
8301000	8306000	That was that was I think but um Grand Theft Auto to be fair was out before that so.
8306000	8315000	A lot of people were using their PlayStation 4 Pros with that because that was one of the games that you know was was supposed to be bigger and better on the Pro was uh Infamous so.
8315000	8317000	Alright well finally.
8317000	8318000	Speaking of a game I haven't finished yeah.
8319000	8323000	Finally tonight did you know they're making a movie out of Rampage.
8323000	8327000	You know the classic 80's game about monsters invading town.
8327000	8330000	Come on y'all have played this game you had to have played Rampage at some point in your life.
8330000	8335000	Uh the movie is being directed by Brad Payton who made the movie San Andreas.
8335000	8337000	Not to be confused with Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.
8337000	8338000	And who does it star?
8338000	8339000	Why the Rock.
8339000	8342000	Dwayne Johnson is the star of this movie.
8342000	8346000	And uh guess what there is now a synopsis out there that came out this week.
8346000	8350000	Uh so uh the Rock plays a primatologist.
8350000	8355000	A man who keeps people at a distance shares an unshakable bond with George.
8355000	8359000	The extraordinarily intelligent silverback gorilla who's been in his care since birth.
8359000	8366000	But a rogue genetic experiment gone ary transforms this gentle ape into a raging monster.
8366000	8371000	To make matters worse it's soon discovered that there are similarly altered alpha predators.
8371000	8376000	As these newly created monsters tear across North America destroying everything in their path.
8376000	8380000	The Rock teams with a discredited genetic engineer to secure an antidote.
8380000	8382000	Fighting his way through an ever changing battlefield.
8382000	8388000	Not only to haul a global catastrophe but to save the fearsome creature that was once his friend.
8389000	8392000	I'll make room on the shelf next to the dumpies for this one.
8392000	8396000	Because this does not sound that exciting to me but who knows.
8396000	8405000	Uh by the way it was stated previously by the director that the film would be more emotional, scarier, and real.
8405000	8409000	You know what's funny is my phone apparently thought when he said make room on the shelf.
8409000	8414000	Um was basically okay google which is kind of annoying.
8414000	8417000	I fucking just turn off you piece of crap.
8417000	8420000	Yeah you need to disable that stuff.
8420000	8427000	Oh it enabled itself when it you know fucking updated to uh nougat or whatever this I don't know what the fuck it's on now.
8427000	8430000	So if I say okay google it comes up.
8430000	8432000	I will make oh yep there it goes.
8432000	8434000	Download lots of porn.
8436000	8438000	Hey it did that sweet.
8440000	8444000	It brought me to uh let's see it says it's what does it say here.
8444000	8449000	Wait search for I'll make you get it get up there goes download lots of porn.
8451000	8455000	I think it I think all it is bring up like some weird like oops.
8455000	8458000	Yeah I just realized Ricky and Gleese is lyrics.
8459000	8461000	That's some weird shit.
8461000	8468000	Yeah um I I just realized there might be podcast listeners listening on speakers that now I just set off all their phones too.
8468000	8469000	Good job.
8469000	8471000	Turn that turn that stuff off.
8471000	8472000	Turn it off.
8472000	8473000	You don't need it.
8473000	8478000	Uh let's see Brad from Pod Culture says the phone will respond again.
8481000	8486000	Alright Orange Lounge Radio all one word on Skype if you want to give us a call and say hello.
8486000	8490000	Talk about something we've talked about tonight or maybe something of your own choosing.
8490000	8493000	Anyhow before we get to that do you have any last minute stories Loki?
8493000	8495000	I think we kind of tapped out on everything.
8495000	8498000	That barrel is scraped to the bottom so.
8498000	8499000	What about FUs?
8499000	8500000	Oh you want to do some FUs tonight?
8500000	8501000	Oh heck yeah.
8501000	8502000	Let's do it.
8502000	8503000	I've got plenty to FU.
8503000	8505000	We got a call coming in we'll do FUs after this so let's get to it.
8505000	8507000	Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this?
8508000	8510000	It's me Rama.
8510000	8511000	Hi Rama how are you?
8511000	8512000	I'm good.
8512000	8516000	I have a question for you and Jamie right now.
8516000	8518000	What are you going to leave Matt out of this?
8518000	8519000	I'm cool with this.
8519000	8525000	Well Matt is residential god of anger against Nintendo so but.
8525000	8526000	Okay.
8526000	8529000	I think it's between you and Jamie.
8529000	8534000	Which one of y'all is the biggest saint of throwing shade tonight?
8534000	8535000	I mean come on.
8537000	8540000	I don't know Dark Soccer was pretty good on that email earlier.
8540000	8542000	Rob is a sassy bitch though.
8542000	8559000	Yeah I don't know I don't know I think we're but we're but we see we both went to that show last night so now we're both like oh we're gonna be Bianca Del Rio today and just throw a bunch of shade so I I don't know it's it's gonna be a close race till the end of the show ain't over Rama.
8559000	8562000	Lord Jesus that's all I gotta say.
8562000	8563000	You want us to read you?
8563000	8565000	Just kidding.
8565000	8574000	Rob I have Mako-chan that does that to me on a regular basis especially when we do our show okay I get I get enough from her.
8574000	8579000	Alright I'm glad someone's giving it to you.
8579000	8582000	You should have seen us last week in Good Lord Almighty.
8582000	8586000	Alright anything else on your mind besides shade throwing?
8586000	8605000	I just gotta say when you were talking about playing DDR at your age earlier in the show I am about your age and I still get up there and I play I think I need to give you some tips on you know trying to get up there still.
8605000	8610000	Now I don't want to turn this into a race thing Rama but I'm gonna.
8610000	8613000	Just so you know I'm just busting your balls because I love you.
8613000	8618000	I know and I love you too but I am gonna go racial with this for a minute Rama.
8618000	8626000	Your people have a better natural talent than my people when it comes to dancing.
8626000	8629000	Okay okay okay Rob I want you to know something.
8629000	8634000	That natural gift skipped my black ass okay?
8634000	8638000	I cannot dance unless I am on the pads okay?
8638000	8643000	Damn that's the thing about stereotypes they're not always true damn.
8643000	8656000	Exactly while everybody was growing up learning how to break dance and all that I was at home playing Super Mario Brothers 2, Super Mario Brothers 3, Super Mario I was doing all of that.
8656000	8660000	That doesn't impede one's ability to dance.
8660000	8662000	Yes it does.
8662000	8665000	Some people also are way out of practice like me.
8665000	8667000	I think it's more of that Rama.
8667000	8670000	Look here's the deal.
8670000	8674000	I don't know how much you, this is a personal question I do not expect you to answer.
8674000	8680000	I don't know how much you weigh now versus when you were let's say 15 years ago which for me would be 23 years old.
8680000	8685000	But if I were to go how much I weigh now compared to when I was 23 years old.
8685000	8688000	Some things have changed pretty majorly in that department Rama.
8688000	8695000	So that's part of the reason it's contributed itself to the fact that I don't move as fast as I used to.
8695000	8703000	However maybe if I played more of these dancing games I would not have this problem and I admit that.
8703000	8706000	Which is true but let me tell you.
8706000	8711000	I've shown you the dance skits I have done with my friends at conventions.
8711000	8715000	You can see I can move pretty quickly and I can keep in tone.
8715000	8721000	I want you to know how much I hurt when we were off the stage.
8721000	8723000	How much I hurt during practice.
8723000	8728000	How many times I have tripped over my feet and slammed my face into the goddamn floor.
8728000	8733000	I guess we share something in that regard because the day after a Rocky Horror performance.
8733000	8739000	Which even though I'm retired I got dragged back on stage because they really really badly needed somebody.
8739000	8742000	So I got dragged back on stage to do Brad at the last show.
8742000	8747000	And so I got to do like fucking coordinated dance routines, kick lines and all this stuff right.
8747000	8752000	And the next day I was just like kill me, kill me now, kill me.
8752000	8754000	I was sore.
8754000	8761000	This is why when I go to cons I liquor up before I go down to the informal dance and dance all that booze off.
8761000	8763000	That way I don't wake up trying to like.
8763000	8765000	I can't feel my legs, can't feel my legs.
8765000	8767000	I got to remember my part though.
8767000	8771000	That's the problem if I drink I do that whole thing where I'm like oh yeah I know my part.
8771000	8776000	I know and then I just I'm up there and I look like an asshole.
8776000	8778000	But we still love you.
8778000	8780000	Thank you, thank you very much I appreciate it.
8780000	8783000	Alright anything else you want to point out about what I'm doing wrong in my life Rama?
8783000	8787000	Anything wrong with your life is just that.
8787000	8790000	I just want you to know I'm here for you.
8790000	8792000	I got your back.
8792000	8794000	Alright tell you what.
8794000	8797000	Oh no you're not going to be there when I'm in New York.
8798000	8800000	Look Rob I already said this.
8800000	8806000	I realize that week I will be spending that week with my favorite gay and lesbian couple.
8806000	8811000	And I'd be damned if I'm going to spend equal time with them all.
8811000	8813000	It'll work one way or another.
8813000	8814000	Alright.
8814000	8816000	You bet your sweet ass it'll work.
8816000	8822000	We'll get up on a DDR machine together and I'll feel much better about it.
8822000	8825000	And Mako-chan will be there to record us making fools of ourselves.
8825000	8828000	I didn't say this shit could be on YouTube.
8828000	8830000	Who said anything about it being on YouTube?
8830000	8833000	It'll be on the secret Bogstash network.
8833000	8835000	Alright secret club's fine.
8835000	8838000	Alright Rama I'm going to let you go but take care.
8838000	8839000	You too stay fabulous.
8839000	8840000	Alright bye.
8840000	8841000	Alright.
8841000	8843000	Alright.
8843000	8848000	Orange Lounge Radio all one word on Skype or 1877 game OLR.
8848000	8851000	But first I did promise Dark Soccer we could have a moment to vent.
8851000	8859000	Cause sometimes you know here on this show we need to dive into a long standing tradition here and let off some steam in a segment we call the FUs of the week.
8859000	8881000	FU to the GOP a major FU.
8881000	8894000	FU to basically anyone who had anything to do with that piece of shit legislation that their Dr. Evil laughing asshole selves have passed the house.
8894000	8895000	Fuck you.
8895000	8896000	Fuck all of you.
8896000	8901000	But bless the lady who put in the bill to remove their exemptions.
8901000	8904000	Now they're also subject to the same piece of shit.
8904000	8905000	That's it.
8906000	8912000	My FU of the week goes to the 100 degree day we had this week.
8912000	8913000	It is fucking May.
8913000	8914000	It is not summer time yet.
8914000	8915000	It is not August.
8915000	8916000	Who was it here?
8916000	8918000	Well lucky fucking you.
8918000	8919000	Where did you go?
8919000	8920000	Oh you were in the bay area that day.
8920000	8921000	That's right.
8921000	8923000	It was still pretty hot.
8923000	8924000	Drinking cocktails.
8924000	8926000	For the bay area it was hot that day.
8926000	8927000	Like 89.
8927000	8929000	But it is fucking early May.
8929000	8930000	Triple degree weather.
8930000	8931000	No ma'am.
8931000	8932000	No ma'am.
8933000	8935000	Loki your FU of the week.
8935000	8941000	I guess just FU to being tired.
8941000	8943000	Because I'm tired.
8943000	8944000	I don't want to be tired.
8944000	8946000	I want to be productive and work on my game.
8946000	8948000	My brain is like YouTube videos.
8948000	8953000	Let's watch more fucking videos about 3D printing.
8953000	8955000	The same videos you've already watched several times.
8955000	8958000	Let's watch a funny video about what's wrong with said movie.
8959000	8961000	I waste so much time.
8961000	8963000	My brain is tired.
8963000	8965000	Your brain is very tired.
8965000	8969000	Well someday the kids will be 18 and out of the house and then maybe you'll finish your game.
8972000	8973000	There it is.
8973000	8974000	Your FUs of the week.
8974000	8975000	It's been a while.
8975000	8977000	It felt good to let loose a little bit of steam here.
8977000	8980000	And some folks in chat.
8980000	8981000	Let's see.
8981000	8985000	Act F saying weather definitely deserves a permanent spot in the FUs.
8985000	8988000	Act F says all week over 100 degree weather.
8988000	8990000	This week it's fucking cold.
8990000	8992000	I didn't even look at.
8992000	8993000	I heard it was going to rain today.
8993000	8997000	It was supposed to be thundering and rainy this weekend.
8997000	9001000	And it's supposed to be up in the upper 80s later this week.
9001000	9006000	As much as the rain bothers me when it's non-stop.
9006000	9008000	Like I've mentioned before I get affected by seasons.
9008000	9012000	And as much as the non-stop rain bothers me.
9012000	9014000	A day or two here and there I don't mind.
9014000	9018000	So I was kind of like thinking oh it might be nice to have a little bit of rain.
9018000	9020000	And then I don't have to water all the plants and the lawn.
9020000	9024000	Now right now the 10 day forecast says maybe rain next Monday.
9024000	9028000	But for now the next week 90 degrees on Tuesday.
9028000	9030000	But otherwise the rest of the week mid 70s.
9030000	9031000	That's not too bad.
9031000	9035000	That's the May weather I expect living in Northern California in the valley.
9035000	9036000	Alright.
9036000	9039000	Well that is going to do it tonight.
9039000	9041000	I'm sorry if you did not get through on the Skype line.
9041000	9043000	But you can always give us an email.
9043000	9046000	Participate at Orangelaunchradio.com.
9046000	9048000	You can also tweet us at OLR.
9048000	9051000	But I believe that is going to do it for another episode of our show tonight.
9051000	9054000	I want to thank you guys for tuning in and supporting the show.
9054000	9057000	If you like what you heard here at Orange Lawns Radio.
9057000	9059000	Please tell a friend or five about the show.
9059000	9060000	Help us spread the word.
9060000	9062000	Because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
9062000	9065000	But if your voices aren't here we can't air them.
9065000	9067000	We do like seeing some new names once in a while.
9067000	9069000	Although we love our old names too.
9069000	9070000	Don't get us wrong.
9070000	9073000	A nice five star review on a site like iTunes goes a long way.
9073000	9076000	Seriously if you've never taken the 30 seconds to do a five star review on iTunes.
9076000	9077000	Please, please help us out.
9077000	9079000	Because those go a long way in getting noticed.
9079000	9083000	Because there's probably easily a thousand video game podcasts on iTunes at this point.
9083000	9086000	So it's sometimes hard to stay above the line.
9086000	9089000	Even if you are 15 years old that doesn't really buy you jack shit.
9089000	9090000	So anyway.
9090000	9092000	That's it for that.
9092000	9094000	So let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
9094000	9096000	Loki your final thoughts tonight.
9096000	9101000	I'm going to work more on this new game until I start another new game.
9101000	9102000	And another new game.
9102000	9103000	And another new game.
9103000	9104000	No but this one actually sounds.
9104000	9105000	I have an idea now.
9105000	9107000	Because that was kind of where I was at before.
9107000	9108000	Like I wanted to do.
9108000	9111000	So actually I'm still going to do something with you on this.
9111000	9113000	And I thought that that's why I started this one.
9113000	9115000	But I still don't know what you're going to do yet.
9115000	9119000	We talked about programming so I could learn Unity.
9119000	9123000	That came up on an episode when the guys from Little Tanks were here.
9123000	9124000	Yes.
9125000	9126000	I do have to say though.
9126000	9128000	What I'm coming up with so far is tank related.
9128000	9129000	But not like their game.
9129000	9131000	I was like don't rip off the guest game.
9131000	9132000	No I'm not ripping off their game.
9132000	9133000	No no no.
9133000	9134000	Completely different type of.
9134000	9136000	I mean it's an arcade type game.
9136000	9139000	But different looking type game.
9139000	9141000	Because they could sue you like Bethesda did.
9141000	9142000	I'm kidding.
9142000	9143000	Yeah yeah.
9143000	9145000	I'm surprised you know.
9145000	9147000	There's a tank you know.
9147000	9150000	The word tank is used somewhere then they can.
9150000	9151000	I don't know.
9151000	9153000	Fuck Bethesda.
9153000	9154000	Seriously.
9154000	9155000	Dark Sakura.
9155000	9156000	Your final thought tonight.
9156000	9161000	Some of my photos from last night turned out really nice.
9161000	9163000	From seeing Bianca Del Rio.
9163000	9166000	I was just looking at my pictures.
9166000	9168000	I like that dress.
9168000	9169000	That black sequined thing.
9169000	9171000	I want one.
9171000	9174000	And my final thought for the night is I had a good time last night.
9174000	9178000	It was very like doing dinner at a fancy-ish restaurant.
9178000	9179000	But not too fancy.
9179000	9182000	And then a show and then dessert with my friends.
9182000	9185000	That was a very pleasant evening.
9185000	9188000	It was a very nice night and I need to do that more often.
9188000	9191000	But I need to make sure I have time for video games as well.
9191000	9192000	That's very important as well.
9192000	9194000	So we hope you guys have time for video games this week.
9194000	9198000	We will see you in seven days and we'll do this all over again.
9198000	9200000	But until then, thanks for listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
9200000	9201000	Have a great week everybody.
