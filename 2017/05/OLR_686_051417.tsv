7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	21000	This week, two veterans of non-Vimani music games team up to create a new story-driven rhythm action adventure game. Heard of Parappa, Guitarman, Vibberman?
21000	27000	Then stay tuned for the information we have along with the rest of the week's gaming news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	38000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio.
38000	48000	Live tonight, May the 14th of 2017 with episode number 686 of our show. My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E
48000	53000	Joining me in studio to talk about, of course, video games, gaming culture, the gaming lifestyle over the next few hours.
54000	60000	DarkSakura or Jamie Summers? I'm hunting. What are you hunting? Kittens. Are you hunting shinies? I'm hunting kittens.
60000	67000	That's what Shane was hunting all day yesterday on our road trip, but I'll talk about that later. I said a cat trap. You said a cat trap? No! What did the kitties do to you?
67000	76000	Okay, we have the poor little, the four babies and their mom in my front yard, hiding in the shrub. Dan accidentally backed over one. No! That's horrible.
76000	83000	He was real tore up about it, so I'm making sure that I'm trapped. Well, he didn't do it on purpose, you know. Yeah, but he was still tore up about it. Of course, of course.
83000	91000	So we're trapping the mama and the three remaining babies. So you're trapping them to take them to a safer place. Got it.
91000	103000	The ASPCA where I live is no kill. Good, good. And we'll get them adopted out. Yay! So, there'll be a happy end to this, but if I come in bleeding from my arms, everyone will know why.
104000	109000	All right. Well, good luck in that adventure, but good on you guys doing the right thing. As crappy as that situation was.
109000	118000	And if any local people want to adopt three adorable kittens, they're mostly weaned and they're cute and I'm going to help socialize them so they'll hate everybody.
118000	125000	Do you have pictures on Twitter or something for people to see? I can put them up. Okay, there you go. I want to wait till I get better pictures of them. All right.
125000	133000	Well, there's Animal Humanist, Dark Sakura, or Jamie Summers. Say hello as well over there to Tech Master Loki.
133000	140000	But remember, if they've lost their mittens, you can't give them pie. That's right. But I can tell their mittens good night.
140000	153000	How are you doing, Loki? Good night, kittens. I'm fine. Yeah? Yeah. Busy week? I guess. How's the adventures in 3D printing going?
153000	163000	I haven't done any this week because I've been really tired. Well, I've still been downloading stuff to 3D print, but I haven't actually gone.
163000	170000	I still have to set up the auto level on the new fan shroud thing now, so I was just like, I just don't want to do that right now.
170000	178000	And last night, I was like, man, I should 3D print something. I'm like, I'm too fucking tired to do this right now.
178000	185000	How long does it take? Is it a really slow process? Yeah, it takes a few hours. It depends on what you're printing.
185000	193000	But you just have to get started and just kind of go from there. But right now, mine is kind of, I still haven't gotten everything leveled and the firmware updated.
193000	204000	So it's just kind of, you kind of keep an eye on it. But after a while, once I know it's printing well, I can just leave it there for however many hours it's going to take.
204000	210000	But you know, a lot of the stuff I printed has been like three hours long, and that's really small things.
210000	220000	Yeah, wow. Okay. Well, good things come to those who wait. But it's one of those things where like the technology in 10 years, the same thing that takes you three hours to print today, will take like 30 seconds.
220000	227000	Like, I don't know if you remember. Okay. Do y'all remember out there? Well, you got to be as old as myself and my co-host to remember this.
227000	235000	Okay, there was a classic old program on the old computers, whether it was the Apple IIe or the Commodore 64, whatever it was you're using. It was called the print shop.
235000	245000	Yeah. And you could make banners. So today is Mother's Day, right? So Happy Mother's Day to all you moms and motherly figures and mothers of children with four legs and all that good stuff.
245000	253000	But in the print shop, let's say you wanted to print it, do a printer or a banner that said Happy Mother's Day. It would be like.
253000	260000	But see, that doesn't work on modern printers because you need those old feed dot matrix printers.
260000	267000	I do miss the banners that you can make the dot matrix printers and like peeling off the little the sides on it.
267000	274000	Yes. Yeah, those are pretty fun. But now it's like if you want to print a banner, you know, you could do. Yeah, you're right. You can't really do it the same way.
274000	282000	You could just string a bunch of laser paper together or, you know, take it to FedEx, Kinko's or one of those types of stores and they do it for you in minutes.
282000	284000	It doesn't take nearly as long.
284000	293000	I was going to say, though, you probably can't necessarily print faster because the reason it goes as speed as it does is the actual plastic needs to harden so that sticks.
293000	297000	Because if you go too fast, then that makes sense. It makes a big mess.
297000	306000	Gotcha. Let's go to our chat room. Hi, everybody. Over at live dot vog network dot com, because we do tape live every Sunday night after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice Geeks Network,
306000	310000	vog network dot com, six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern ish.
310000	317000	And I noticed that S.H.O. 100 Matt commenting on the Jamie situation about what happened if she came in here bleeding from her arms one day.
317000	323000	S.H.O. 100 Matt says, I would have guessed if Jamie came in bleeding from her arms, it would be because she finally snapped on a bad driver.
323000	332000	I almost did. Girl, no. This truck almost like tagged the snub nose of my roller skate, meaning my Fiat.
332000	339000	Not signaling. What a stupid, stupid fuck. What a stupid fuck.
339000	347000	Apparently the print shop ruffling a lot of nostalgic feathers in chat, a lot of people cheering for the print shop and Dungeon Buster says, I love that thing.
347000	354000	True workhorse. These ink jets are junk. Act up says dot matrix printers, the original dubstep creators.
354000	360000	Yes, I've said in there that the reason why we all have hearing damage is because of dot matrix printers and dial up modem.
360000	363000	Oh, my God. You'd have to leave the room when print shop is going like seriously.
363000	367000	A banner would take like 30 to 45 minutes to print in the frickin print shop.
367000	371000	But it was so cool, though, because they just feed out of this like big pile of paper.
371000	376000	I remember like my first year of college in ninety four.
376000	381000	Yeah. Writing my paper and having to do it in the lab that had the printer.
381000	384000	Right. The lab that had the printer. It was like that.
384000	390000	Yeah, yeah, yeah. And having to wait in line and seriously waited an hour just to get like a five page essay printed.
390000	397000	I remember when it was a big I mean, tuning in tonight to old people lounge radio.
397000	407000	But here's the thing. I remember when you would use a word processing software where it didn't look like on the screen what it did on the page.
407000	413000	Like, you know, it was you had just like plain text because we were in graphic environments yet.
413000	419000	Like, you know, the Commodore 64 didn't get that until they got Geos, the graphic environmental operating system,
419000	426000	which was kind of Commodore 64 is late life answer to what Apple ended up moving into at the time with Max.
426000	433000	It was just looks like a Mac was the big originator of a widespread graphical interface.
433000	439000	Right. And that was, you know, and then obviously Microsoft filed, followed suit on the PC and all that stuff with with their own word.
439000	441000	And then everything finally looked like what it was.
441000	448000	But I remember like the only way you could preview like what's this really going to look like is to print it or like pray.
448000	452000	What does it or you have to get out the manual because like what does this font look like?
452000	456000	Sacrifice some chickens. Seriously.
456000	459000	Let's see. OK, I'll read it. I'll read a few more memories here in chat.
459000	466000	S.H.O. 100 Matt says, I remember getting in trouble in the first grade for typing a book report and printing it on my dot matrix printer.
466000	473000	My teacher was pissed and wanted me to hand write it because she thought my parents would do it if it was type written.
473000	479000	Oh, interesting. Is that why I don't know about you S.H.O. 100 Matt, but I have hideous handwriting.
479000	483000	Is that because computers spoiled me in that regard?
483000	487000	I do feel like my handwriting did get better with age, but it's still not great.
487000	491000	Like you probably would look at my handwriting and think I was in like junior high school.
491000	494000	I had a lot better writing handwriting when I was in high school.
494000	499000	And now when I got actually when I got back into drawing again and working because I had that problem with my hand.
499000	503000	Right. My handwriting has gotten better since I've had all those surgeries.
503000	509000	So I've never had artistic ability that my mom had all that, but she didn't pass that down to me.
509000	512000	I got my dad's chicken scratch handwriting gene.
512000	516000	My five still sometimes look like S's. It's just a quirk.
516000	525000	It was it was a challenge because, you know, I'm a I'm a corporate teacher by day and now everything is really on projectors and all that stuff.
525000	532000	But I still remember when we were using whiteboards regularly and I'm having like right on the whiteboard and I'm like, God, my handwriting is awful.
532000	536000	So I just learned to write in all caps when I wrote on the board,
536000	541000	because like all capital letters are kind of like the easiest thing to like not have be super out here better.
541000	545000	And they can hear it better. That's right. I'm shouting at my class. You will learn this.
545000	558000	Although I will tell you that for most people, it actually is easier to read something written in lowercase because you have more different heights and a good reader will read by the shape of the word.
558000	562000	And a bad reader will sound out the letters.
562000	568000	Do you know what weird thing I do with my handwriting that I've been called out on before? My A's.
568000	572000	OK, most people write an A like an O but with a tail, right?
572000	582000	I write my A like an upside down E with a tail because on a computer, when you print it in time or in a book in times, that's what it really looks like.
582000	584000	The letter A looks like that.
584000	587000	Oh, with the appendage at top.
587000	592000	Yeah, like that's how most of us actually read A's in magazines. So that's kind of like how I learned to write it.
592000	598000	That's how I used to write my A's when I was in high school. And after, I don't know what it is, right after my surgery, that all went to the circle with the tail.
598000	603000	But that's yeah, isn't that weird? Why do they teach us to write? I mean, this is great video game chat, isn't it?
603000	608000	But hey, maybe you're designing a font for your video game and you need to know how to do your A.
608000	627000	Keep in mind, computer fonts are based off of old letterpress type, which usually letterpress type was based off of, you know, we're looking at letters generated in the 1700s, 1600s, back as far as the 1400s when we had the first letterpress.
627000	629000	Yeah, the first letterpress was Comic Sans.
629000	632000	No, it was Papyrus. That's why it's old looking.
632000	648000	Whatever. But I mean, a lot of letters, the alphabet itself has changed so much visually, just evolved that, you know, when you look at these letters, we're technically looking at the way people wrote thousands of years ago or hundreds of years ago, I should say.
648000	655000	You know, so there's your history lesson. That's why ye old shop and old letterpress, the YE was the TH sound.
655000	656000	Interesting.
656000	658000	It was actually a different letter set.
658000	660000	I'm learning tonight on OLR.
660000	662000	Who was the graphic design major here?
662000	664000	Alright, don't be all waving it around.
664000	669000	Looking in our chat, Fifth Dream in chat says, Me too Rob, A bros.
669000	672000	So I guess Fifth Dream also writes the A's like that.
672000	676000	And Brad from Pod Culture says, Orange font radio.
676000	679000	What is your favorite font, Dark Sakura?
679000	682000	My favorite font is Comic Papyrus.
682000	683000	I just got the finger.
683000	685000	Actually, have you seen Comic Slab?
685000	686000	No, I've not seen Comic Slab.
686000	690000	Okay, a slab font is the thick serifs, like the Old West font.
690000	695000	Someone did Comic Sans with, instead of it being Sans, it was a slab serif.
695000	700000	So it looks like Old Western Comic Sans and it's freaking hilarious.
700000	706000	By the way, my favorite fonts are Helvetica New.
706000	708000	They did a whole documentary on Helvetica, right?
708000	712000	That is so boring. I'm just kidding.
712000	715000	It actually is more or less like the social phenomenon behind Helvetica.
715000	717000	No, documentaries actually are fascinating.
717000	719000	It actually, though, was a really good documentary.
719000	725000	My other one is Adobe Garamond Pro for a serif font.
725000	727000	And my other one is Futura.
727000	730000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, Euro style.
730000	733000	Which is, of course, the VOG logo is Euro style.
733000	736000	Because it's clean and easy and modern looking.
736000	739000	I only type completely in Impact Bold.
739000	744000	Cinco de Milo in chat is falling asleep, so I think we need to get to video game talk.
744000	746000	Let's get to our kickoff topic tonight.
746000	748000	We're going to talk about what's going on in the news.
748000	751000	I want to start with this because I think this is kind of fascinating
751000	755000	and a sign of the, you know, talking about the olden days versus gaming today.
755000	759000	I'm sure a lot of you guys have heard by now, and if you haven't,
759000	761000	this is really your last chance to get in on this.
761000	765000	In fact, when the podcast listeners hear this, this is already going to be a done deal, unfortunately.
765000	768000	But Alan Wake is being delisted.
768000	773000	Alan Wake is being removed from Steam and other digital storefronts.
773000	777000	That includes the Xbox Live Store after May 15th, so Monday,
777000	780000	which I believe like 10 a.m. or so is the time it's going to go down.
780000	783000	And they are saying this is because of music licensing.
783000	787000	There are songs in Alan Wake, and if you've played Alan Wake,
787000	791000	the songs are very important in the game.
791000	794000	You know, obviously to set the mood and everything.
794000	797000	They use the songs pretty heavily, and they have some pretty big songs.
797000	799000	Like they have Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds.
799000	802000	They have the Black Angels, Young Men Dead.
802000	806000	And I was tweeting about this earlier, but there was a song I loved when I was in college,
806000	809000	and it's a song by the artist Poe.
809000	811000	She was a singer.
811000	813000	She was famous for that song, Hey Pretty.
813000	816000	But she had a song, and Johnny, Angry Johnny.
816000	819000	But she had a song called Haunted that was in Alan Wake.
819000	820000	Good song.
820000	822000	Oh my God, it's such an underrated song, right?
822000	825000	And I remember buying that CD in like 98 or 99 whenever it came out,
825000	827000	back when we still had Tower Records, right?
827000	829000	I bought that CD, and I loved it.
829000	834000	And then 11 years later, I'm playing Alan Wake in 2010, right?
834000	836000	When it finally came out for Xbox 360.
836000	838000	Because remember that game had a forever dev cycle.
838000	841000	Like they were showing that game off when they announced the 360.
841000	843000	It finally comes out in 2010.
843000	845000	And then like, I think it's the end of Chapter 2.
845000	848000	I beat Chapter 2, and that song started playing,
848000	850000	and I totally did the whole like gasp, like the,
850000	853000	like, oh my God, somebody else knows this song.
853000	856000	Somebody at Remedy knew this song and put it in the game,
856000	858000	and so like I freaked out.
858000	861000	It honestly made me like Alan Wake almost a little more
861000	862000	because like that song was in it.
862000	863000	I love that song so much.
863000	866000	But obviously the songs are very impactful.
866000	870000	So these songs must have some sort of limited license.
870000	873000	And I imagine when you're, you know, these are pretty big bands.
873000	877000	Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, Black, I mean, these are big bands.
877000	881000	So to license their music, you know, they probably only had a limited amount of time.
881000	884000	And especially in these earlier days of the Xbox 360,
884000	886000	there were probably still a lot of question marks.
886000	889000	I think a lot of that got learned through Rock Band
889000	891000	and some of the issues they've had, right?
891000	894000	Like you still can't export Beatles Rock Band,
894000	898000	but I'm sure the Beatles contract is an ironclad thing.
898000	900000	So when they got to do the Beatles Rock Band,
900000	903000	like I'm very sure that that contract is like,
903000	906000	you use it for this and only this and you know,
906000	909000	like they're, those songs ain't getting out of the game anytime soon.
909000	911000	Anyways, if you didn't already know,
911000	915000	Remedy is discounting the game by 90% on Steam.
915000	917000	So tonight's really your last chance to get it.
917000	919000	It's down to $3 because that's 90%.
919000	921000	I'll need to re-download it to make sure I keep it.
921000	923000	Yeah, I think, now here's the thing.
923000	925000	I actually think you've had,
925000	928000	you guys have had a lot of opportunity to get Alan Wake already.
928000	931000	I remember they were giving it away for free at one point.
931000	933000	I don't remember if it was through a Humble Bundle, maybe.
933000	934000	Maybe it was one of those things.
934000	938000	But I have a DRM-free version because I think they gave it away for free at one point.
938000	943000	And I would hope some of y'all that have an Xbox One checked out Quantum Break
943000	945000	because that game was pretty awesome also by Remedy.
945000	949000	And when you bought that, you got Alan Wake on backwards compatibility.
949000	954000	So I do feel like people have had ample opportunity to check out this game.
954000	959000	And, you know, Alan Wake is a pretty cool game.
959000	961000	A lot of people compare it to Silent Hill,
961000	964000	but I would say there's a lot of like that scary game stuff
964000	967000	mixed with a lot of like popular television,
967000	971000	especially one of my all-time favorite shows,
971000	973000	which, how timely is this?
973000	976000	One of my all-time favorite shows is Twin Peaks, right?
976000	978000	And I'm sure some of you guys have heard,
978000	981000	Showtime's bringing it back next week,
981000	985000	which I shouldn't be plugging here because it's going to be on the same time as OLR,
985000	989000	but that's why you have digital Hulu and all that stuff.
989000	991000	You can watch it on demand and all that stuff.
991000	993000	But, yeah, I mean like, you know,
993000	997000	I think Alan Wake was a game that got a lot of its influence from Twin Peaks,
997000	1001000	which also Twin Peaks maybe didn't use a lot of licensed music,
1001000	1007000	but that show in the 90s especially was like had a hugely impactful soundtrack.
1007000	1011000	Like the theme song is like probably one of the greatest theme songs
1011000	1013000	they ever did for television, honestly.
1013000	1019000	So anyway, so this game is being delisted and it's due to a music licensing issue.
1019000	1024000	So you're not going to be able to download the game or buy it from the storefronts.
1024000	1027000	But my understanding is that you can re-download it.
1027000	1030000	So if you already have the digital rights to it, you'll be able to re-download it.
1030000	1034000	And of course, if you have a disc-based copy of the game,
1034000	1036000	they can't come to your house and take that away from you,
1036000	1038000	so you still have the rights to the game.
1038000	1044000	But this does put an interesting little monkey wrench in the whole digital games thing,
1044000	1048000	is that some games can expire.
1048000	1052000	What do you guys kind of think about this whole Alan Wake thing?
1052000	1056000	Do you think that they should try to renegotiate the music licenses?
1056000	1059000	Because that's another thing they're talking about is that they may go back to the drawing.
1059000	1065000	I mean, they're not going to just do like when they released Beverly Hills 90210,
1065000	1067000	the television show on DVD,
1067000	1071000	I think they went back and replaced a lot of the music licenses from that time
1071000	1075000	with like generic, you know, music that you would hear in an elevator or whatever.
1075000	1077000	They're not going to go back and do that with Alan Wake.
1077000	1081000	They've already said that's a lot harder than you guys think it is to do.
1081000	1083000	So either the songs are there or they're not going to be there.
1083000	1086000	Do you think Remedy should go back and try to renegotiate the licenses
1086000	1090000	or to get this back up on digital storefronts or let it go, be done?
1090000	1093000	This game is seven years old, no one wants it anymore. What do you guys think?
1093000	1095000	I don't think that they would do it for this,
1095000	1098000	but if they're going to release like a remastered version or something like that,
1098000	1102000	they would renegotiate it and maybe do it at that time.
1102000	1105000	Oh, so if they ever did like an Alan Wake, you know, HD,
1105000	1107000	well, it's weird saying Alan Wake HD, but I get what you're saying.
1107000	1110000	Like, you know, there are some games from last gen that have come back
1110000	1112000	on the 60 frames a second and all this stuff.
1112000	1115000	If they were to give Alan Wake that treatment, absolutely,
1115000	1117000	you need to renegotiate that music, which Alan Wake deserves that.
1117000	1119000	Well, that's why I think because if they sell it right now,
1119000	1121000	I don't think it's that popular.
1121000	1124000	They're not going to make their money back for whatever deal
1124000	1126000	that they have to strike for this.
1126000	1129000	That's why they would need to resell it at, you know,
1129000	1132000	like a full retail value in order to make their money back.
1132000	1133000	Jamie?
1133000	1135000	Pretty much the same thing.
1135000	1139000	I don't think there's any logical reason to do it right now,
1139000	1141000	unless there were plans for rerelease.
1141000	1144000	So, Tiger Claw and Chat says,
1144000	1147000	if they bring back the game after they renegotiated an agreement,
1147000	1150000	should they leave the current prices they sold for the game
1150000	1154000	or raise it back to what it originally cost before this?
1154000	1157000	Well, that would really depend on how much they're paying for that music,
1157000	1158000	I would think.
1158000	1159000	Split the difference.
1159000	1161000	Yeah, they're going to pass down that cost to you.
1161000	1165000	At the same time, they're selling it for $3 a pop right now.
1165000	1168000	And because of all the press this story has been getting over the weekend,
1168000	1170000	I'm sure a lot of people are buying it.
1170000	1176000	So, I would imagine the musicians are signed on to some type of percentage of proceeds.
1176000	1177000	I mean, it has to be, right?
1177000	1178000	Because they wouldn't want to take a loss.
1178000	1180000	Licenses are usually paid up front, though.
1180000	1182000	Oh, so like it was some type of deal.
1182000	1183000	So, they've already recouped their cost.
1183000	1184000	I see.
1184000	1187000	So, yeah, that's true because I've heard of that for like music games, actually.
1187000	1193000	Some of those artists in certain large music games that we once talked about on the show
1193000	1195000	got paid $50 for the track.
1195000	1198000	And those tracks are in the game, you know, now.
1198000	1204000	So, obviously, when you're an indie band, $50 is a big freaking deal.
1204000	1205000	But I'm sure for some of these…
1205000	1206000	Well, it's certainly exposure as well.
1206000	1208000	I mean, I know you can't work for exposure.
1208000	1209000	Right.
1209000	1214000	But getting paid a significant amount, hopefully significant,
1214000	1219000	plus having your name put out there in a way that it wouldn't have been otherwise.
1219000	1220000	Right.
1220000	1224000	There is still a little bit of a trade-off, too, is that, you know, there can also be the publicity for,
1224000	1229000	like, you have to put the information in the game about how to get the song on iTunes or something.
1229000	1233000	Like, you know, I've seen that done in games before that, like, you know, you'll see, like,
1233000	1238000	oh, and available at, you know, RCArecords.com or whatever, you know, the deal is.
1238000	1242000	So, very interesting with all that.
1242000	1243000	Let me see.
1243000	1248000	I'm going into other comments from chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
1248000	1255000	Cinco de Milo in our chat says, I'm glad they didn't pull a Grand Theft Auto and patch out the music.
1255000	1258000	I hate it when developers retroactively screw with their games.
1258000	1261000	You know, I forgot that Grand Theft Auto had done that for some music.
1261000	1264000	It was only, like, a very few amount of tracks.
1264000	1268000	But, yeah, they did patch in, like, Grand Theft Auto 4, was it?
1268000	1269000	I think they went out and they…
1269000	1270000	San Andreas.
1270000	1271000	San Andreas.
1271000	1272000	And they patched out some of the music.
1272000	1273000	Yeah.
1273000	1274000	Yeah.
1274000	1278000	But, then again, there's also, you know, like, some of the older Grand Theft Auto games,
1278000	1281000	because they aren't, I guess, sold digitally, back when it got really big on PlayStation 2.
1281000	1283000	I mean, all those songs are still there.
1283000	1286000	You can't really patch a PS2 game, so…
1286000	1287000	Right.
1287000	1288000	Interesting.
1288000	1289000	Interesting.
1289000	1290000	Let's see.
1290000	1293000	I'll also go into our chat at live.vognetwork.com.
1293000	1297000	JD in chat says, old Konami originals expire too.
1297000	1303000	I think Sochichiro Hirata and Akira Yomoka's songs are gone from modern mixes, for instance.
1303000	1304000	Actually, no.
1304000	1308000	Akira Yomoka's songs, I actually know this, because I was getting into this in my gaming
1308000	1311000	week, but I played DDRA's this week, and I did play Akira Yomoka's songs.
1311000	1313000	So, they're still showing up.
1313000	1317000	But some of the songs have disappeared, and maybe that's some type of agreement.
1317000	1321000	It could be just also because the library's getting so huge in those mixes that you gotta
1321000	1322000	cut something.
1322000	1323000	Yeah.
1323000	1324000	Very, very true.
1324000	1328000	And then Rama's asking, can you explain more what this game is like?
1328000	1331000	What other games are similar to Alan Wake?
1331000	1334000	Ooh, that's a good question.
1334000	1341000	I mean, the easiest comparison to make is Silent Hill, but I feel like the tone of the
1341000	1343000	game is very different from Silent Hill.
1343000	1347000	The way the game plays might have some similarities, although there's more of a mechanic with
1347000	1352000	the flashlight, and it has been, in all honesty, it's been quite a while since I played it,
1352000	1355000	so I don't remember all the specifics, but I remember the flashlight played a very important
1355000	1359000	type of mechanic that doesn't exist in Silent Hill.
1359000	1361000	But the tone of the game's very different.
1361000	1368000	Alan Wake is not as in-your-face gory and creepy in some of those ways.
1368000	1375000	That's why I compare it to Twin Peaks, because Twin Peaks was creepy through the ambience
1375000	1380000	and through the unknowingness of this crazy town in the middle of nowhere.
1380000	1381000	Does that make sense?
1381000	1384000	And I think Alan Wake kind of shared a lot of that in tone, where the violence and all
1384000	1386000	that wasn't always in your face.
1386000	1387000	I mean, there were definitely some scary moments there.
1387000	1389000	Silent Hill wasn't overly violent, though.
1389000	1391000	It wasn't, but it had its moments.
1391000	1392000	You know what I mean?
1392000	1396000	Yeah, so like, and then there would be places you go, like you'd walk into a room and there
1396000	1398000	would be blood everywhere, that type of thing, you know?
1398000	1402000	What about more like everybody's gone to the rapture for that ambience, the creepy you
1402000	1403000	don't know what's going on?
1403000	1407000	I like that, except then when you bring in everybody's gone to the rapture, people think
1407000	1411000	about, oh, a game where you do nothing but walk around and listen to story, and that's
1411000	1413000	not really Alan Wake, either.
1413000	1415000	There is, you know, a game going on there.
1415000	1418000	So it's kind of, it's a little bit of everything there.
1418000	1423000	Rageinator in chat says, think X-Files meets Resident Evil 4, as brought to you by Energizer.
1423000	1427000	I think that's a tie-in to the flashlight play-in, but yeah.
1427000	1429000	Yeah, I guess X-Files is a pretty good comparison, too.
1429000	1433000	That's another show that was very creepy from ambience.
1433000	1439000	Anyway, it'll be interesting to see if they do go through the motions of re-licensing
1439000	1446000	Alan Wake, or maybe someday do an HD, again, I feel silly calling it HD, but a souped-up
1446000	1450000	remix of Alan Wake or something for a future release.
1450000	1452000	Because who knows what Remedy's going to do next?
1452000	1454000	They haven't announced their next project, right?
1454000	1458000	It doesn't look like Quantum Break may get a sequel, although who knows?
1458000	1459000	I guess anything's possible.
1459000	1462000	Yeah, I all about forgot about Quantum Break.
1462000	1464000	Yeah, it's a good game.
1464000	1470000	It looked good, it wasn't enough to sell me on an Xbox One.
1470000	1473000	Alright, let's get to our gaming week.
1473000	1476000	Sorry, I'm laughing because I just saw this.
1476000	1481000	Cinco de Milo in chat says, Alan Woke as fuck.
1481000	1483000	That could be a sequel.
1483000	1485000	Stay woke, Alan Woke.
1485000	1489000	Alright, let's get to our games and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.
1489000	1491000	So, let's go over to Dark Sakura.
1491000	1493000	How was your gaming week?
1493000	1496000	It was okay.
1496000	1500000	It was wow and Mass Effect Andromeda.
1500000	1504000	I didn't play for a few days because I just downloaded the new patch.
1504000	1510000	And, by the way, if anyone does have Origin access right now, the deluxe version is like 40 bucks.
1510000	1514000	So, just saying.
1514000	1520000	Well, Miitomo and Pokemon Go, it's the usual kind of.
1520000	1524000	Oh, no wait, I bought a game but I didn't start playing it yet.
1524000	1530000	And, I bought Shelter 2 because I heard really good reviews of it.
1530000	1536000	And, the deluxe version is on sale, well, it was on sale when I got it on the App Store.
1536000	1538000	So, I bought it to play on my Mac.
1538000	1540000	Nice.
1541000	1544000	Alright, we'll go over to Loki then.
1544000	1546000	How was your gaming week?
1546000	1549000	This week I did make an attempt to play some different things.
1549000	1551000	Not too much, though.
1551000	1553000	So, I decided to come.
1553000	1557000	Randomly, I read something about We Happy Field.
1557000	1561000	I'm like, oh shit, I backed that on Kickstarter and I never got my key for that.
1561000	1567000	So, I finally went and I was looking at a bunch of different places to see, oh, maybe it's in my humble library and stuff.
1567000	1573000	I'm like, holy crap, I have a ton of unclaimed keys in this library right now.
1573000	1576000	So, that made me think, oh, maybe I should go look at my scene library.
1576000	1579000	And so, you know, I've got like almost 600 games on there now.
1579000	1587000	And, I was like, okay, well, hell, I'll try, you know, The Seventh Guest because I fondly remember that.
1587000	1589000	Oh yeah, speaking of classics, old school games.
1589000	1591000	Yeah, really old.
1591000	1593000	So, I tried playing that.
1593000	1596000	Well, see, The Seventh Guest, when I played it, I played it at a friend's house.
1596000	1599000	I played, he was like well into the game.
1599000	1601000	And, I remembered it being fun.
1601000	1606000	Apparently, I didn't remember it correctly because that game is boring as fuck.
1606000	1610000	And, it does not show it age well.
1610000	1613000	It is, wow.
1613000	1615000	I mean, it's running on ScummVM, but, you know.
1615000	1622000	That is a problem with a lot of the old full motion video CD-ROM games is that they have not aged well.
1622000	1624000	And, I think, most of them have not aged well.
1624000	1629000	And, I think a big problem with that is that, you know, the acting in video games, technology in video games has come so far.
1629000	1633000	You know, we're giving away awards now for performances in video games.
1633000	1641000	Whereas before, actors and actresses wouldn't touch these CD-ROM motion games until their careers were already going downhill.
1641000	1645000	Hence, you know, no offense, but Dana Plato in Night Trap.
1645000	1649000	What, Tia Carrere had a CD-ROM game years after Wayne's World, right?
1649000	1652000	Well, I mean, I know a lot of it was all FMV.
1652000	1655000	I mean, all the transitions between rooms and everything was all FMV.
1655000	1657000	But, I'm like thinking, well, this was here.
1657000	1663000	I'm like, why couldn't they have just, like, even somehow, like, created extra frames for this?
1663000	1665000	Because the animation is super choppy.
1665000	1666000	And, I get it, it's old.
1666000	1673000	But, how hard would that have been to just insert some extra frames in there so that it kind of smooths out the animation?
1673000	1675000	Or, maybe speed up some of the stuff?
1675000	1677000	Because, it took forever to get into the game.
1677000	1679000	I did, like, a puzzle and it wasn't really that hard.
1679000	1683000	And then, like, some of the other puzzles, like, I don't know what the fuck you want me to do with this shit.
1683000	1685000	I mean, I get it, there's clues in the house.
1685000	1693000	I don't want to fucking wait through all these transitions to go find a fucking map to some shit somewhere hidden on a rug or something.
1693000	1697000	But, yeah, it didn't bother you as much in the 90s when that game was originally out.
1697000	1701000	Because, like, your computer, you never saw graphics like that on a computer, the transitions.
1701000	1704000	So, you were kind of, like, you were mesmerized by, ooh, this is so realistic.
1704000	1705000	Right, yeah.
1705000	1708000	So, I just kind of got bored with that really fast.
1708000	1710000	So, I deleted it.
1710000	1711000	Oh my god.
1711000	1715000	Well, whatever, it's a really small game, I just didn't want to play it anymore.
1715000	1724000	So, then I went ahead and I was going to play Minecraft on PlayStation 4, because my PC version, the Windows 10 one's all broken right now.
1724000	1728000	So, I was going to play Minecraft, but then it wanted the patch, and I was like, I don't want to wait for this.
1728000	1731000	So, then I played everything, which is that game I was talking about.
1731000	1734000	It's really weird. I still don't understand the point of it.
1734000	1737000	Basically, you play as everything.
1737000	1743000	So, you start off as a sheep, and the game has really terrible animation on purpose.
1743000	1750000	So, your sheep kind of rolls, like, you know, four different animation frames, which is kind of silly.
1750000	1752000	But, I don't really understand the point yet.
1752000	1756000	You're supposed to, like, you know, sing to other animals, which is basically just talking.
1756000	1763000	And then you can actually, literally, at some point in the game, like, play as everything, like, from microorganisms to plants to the universe.
1763000	1768000	I mean, it's just kind of, I don't know, I don't understand the point yet to it.
1768000	1774000	It's an artsy game, but I bought it because it had a really shitty animation, and I thought that was entertaining.
1774000	1776000	So, I ended up playing Skyrim.
1776000	1782000	So, I played more through Skyrim, just doing some of the quests in there that I hadn't done before, and just kind of playing through that a little bit.
1782000	1786000	So, I sunk a couple hours into that, and yeah.
1786000	1794000	That, and of course, you know, my mobile stuff, and I've been doing Pokémon GO daily, and still playing the idle clicker thing for office space.
1794000	1799000	Because, actually, each week they do add this, like, new kind of, they kind of mix it up a little bit.
1799000	1804000	So, they add, like, a bonus challenge thing, so you can play, like, two different games at once.
1804000	1806000	And that's been entertaining enough.
1807000	1814000	So, I do enjoy it. It's a good time kill, but it's not so in-your-face, like, obnoxious as some of the other ones.
1814000	1826000	Because, actually, you know, the clicking part of it, they have a part where you can tap to earn money, but you honestly earn more money faster through this whole, like, it almost looks like a tiny tower a little bit.
1826000	1832000	Setting that stuff up, you earn money faster than you do with tapping, so there's really no point to do that.
1832000	1834000	I don't know. It's been fun, though.
1834000	1835000	Alright. Is that it?
1835000	1836000	That's it.
1836000	1840000	Alright. My Gaming Week has actually been very active, very busy. Sorry, I have a lot to cover this week.
1840000	1846000	But, I want to thank, Monday night, we kind of did an impromptu Mario Kart 8 tournament, which I ended up live streaming.
1846000	1852000	And it was kind of, I mean, it wasn't really, like, an OLR thing, or a, you know, the podcast I tape on Monday nights, reading is fundamental.
1852000	1861000	I mean, it was kind of a little bit based around that, because it started as, oh, let's have me, Spike, John, maybe Delvin try to all, like, play Mario Kart 8 online at the same time.
1862000	1867000	And it kind of turned into this big, like, Twitter friend of friend thing, and so people were joining in.
1867000	1870000	We had a pretty good turnout. One of our races, we had a full 12 people in the race.
1870000	1874000	So did they have, like, a way to set up tournaments in there, or is it just, like, kind of, hey, let's all play together?
1874000	1879000	You can set up tournaments, and it was a learning experience, that's for sure, because we had some problems.
1879000	1886000	Like, some people were not able to join the tournament, for whatever reason, and then, like, suddenly they would break through and be able to join in.
1886000	1896000	We learned that the clock in Mario Kart 8 makes no freaking sense, it doesn't follow daylight savings time, so you have to set everything an hour earlier than you really want it to be.
1896000	1903000	Yeah, which does, like, it would be very easy for Nintendo to just display, the current time is, beep, and then, like, that would have fixed all those problems.
1903000	1906000	That's like shit that's built into all electronics, why can't that...
1906000	1908000	I know. Well, I'm not...
1908000	1914000	Like, isn't the clock on your system, doesn't that have daylight savings? Why can't it read the system time?
1914000	1924000	Yeah, I don't know, I mean, you know, in listening to Bobby's show earlier, he does explain that as a programmer, time zones are a lot harder than you think, but I just think this would be an easy...
1924000	1933000	Well, here's the weird thing, I don't remember this being a problem on the Wii U version, so maybe there's something weird about how it ported over, and the Switch...
1933000	1938000	I'm not going to overthink it, I'm just going to tell you all, it was an issue, so just be aware of it with the clocks.
1938000	1952000	But otherwise, we had a lot of fun. It did get to an interesting point where, because there were so many people that were playing in the tournament, you know, we got up to 13, 14 people, it split people into, now we have one room of six people here, and another room of six people over here.
1952000	1967000	And some people were frustrated with it because, you know, I'm streaming it, but they weren't in the match that was on the stream, and I was like, I set it up this way to try to avoid people feeling like that, and, you know, mixing it up after every race, but it's just kind of, like, inevitable, I guess, that that sometimes happens.
1967000	1973000	So when it's splitting it up, does that mean that they're doing six in one race, or is it just splitting up the lobbies?
1973000	1982000	It's splitting up the lobbies because we set it up as a tournament, so it's still the same tournament, but it's like there's one race going on over here and another going on over here. Does that make sense?
1982000	1984000	Can you, like, watch those races as they go on?
1984000	1989000	No, it's not that, it's not that involved. It's Nintendo.
1990000	2003000	You, as you join a race, you might find that there's already a race in progress, so you can watch it finish, and then you join that lobby, but that's about as far as it goes with it. I don't, again, maybe it's in there and I just haven't looked for it, but I don't know the spectator thing.
2003000	2005000	Is that the same way it works on the Wii U, or is that just, like...
2005000	2008000	The same way it works on the Wii U. They haven't really changed a lot of that.
2008000	2009000	God damn stupid.
2009000	2012000	Eh, it's not as bad as you think, but...
2012000	2018000	Well, I would think, though, if you're doing, like, a tournament, if you're setting up brackets and stuff, wouldn't you want to see how the other races go? Well, I'll just twiddle our fingers and figure out who...
2019000	2033000	It's not that kind of tournament. It's a points-based tournament. You're in point, like, if you come in first in the race, of so many people, you get this many points. If you come in last, you get, like, one point. So, that's how it's set up. It's not a knockout tournament type of thing. Like, you're thinking, like, a fighting game tournament.
2033000	2043000	Well, I'm thinking just, like, a tournament whatsoever. If you have a lobby of, like, if you have a group of 16 people that are playing in a tournament, wouldn't you want to see the other matches going on, or are they supposed to be going at the same time?
2043000	2044000	They're going at the same time.
2044000	2048000	That's silly. Why? Why would you do that? Why can't you put 16 people in one race?
2048000	2049000	Ask Nintendo.
2050000	2052000	Is it because the game can't handle that many?
2052000	2064000	Well, yeah, I think it's a hard cap for 12 people in one race. I don't think you can add more than 12. That would be a lot of objects and crap going on on the field.
2065000	2074000	You know, if you want the game to run at 60 frames a second so much, I cut him some slack there. The original Mario Kart was only 8 people on the track at one time, so...
2074000	2078000	I mean, yeah, I get it. It's a Nintendo system. I mean, we're not talking, like, Battlefield or something.
2078000	2079000	I think you're being...
2079000	2082000	I could run 64 player matches, you know, with full HD.
2082000	2092000	Okay. Okay. Let's talk about another racing game I played this week. Forza Horizon 3 on the Xbox One, right? Those races? Limited to 12.
2093000	2096000	So, watch your step there, Loki. It's not just Nintendo.
2096000	2103000	Yeah, it's limited to 12 because it's a big open world that's got a stream in there versus a tiny little map that they make for the race.
2103000	2107000	Alright. Anyway, thank you to those that were participating in the tournament. I appreciate it.
2107000	2114000	But, yeah, I played a little bit of Forza Horizon 3 this week because Bobby was livestreaming it earlier this week doing the Hot Wheels thing.
2114000	2118000	Our pal Bree with SakaiGDA, she was streaming it and doing the Hot Wheels thing.
2118000	2124000	And I was like, man, I really need to make more progress on this game. And I think I was in a racing game mode because of Mario Kart 8.
2124000	2132000	So, I actually fired up Forza Horizon 3 on the PC and was playing that because I wanted to see how it kind of compared to the Xbox One.
2132000	2138000	And it runs well on my system. I had a good time playing it. So, I'm going to do that as the post-show game tonight.
2138000	2143000	So, we'll take a look at that on my livestream over at twitch.tv slash Rob Roberts after the show.
2143000	2149000	So, I was playing some Forza Horizon 3. Also, this is a big accomplishment for me this week in gaming.
2149000	2154000	Diablo 3, Wednesday night, PlayStation 4, I got my platinum trophy.
2154000	2159000	So, I got every- and that was something I said on this show I was going to do like three years ago.
2159000	2167000	So, I finally did it! Wednesday night, I got my trophy and I actually livestreamed that because I figured that was an occasion worth streaming.
2167000	2176000	But 500 bounties, that's the trophy that took me the longest. It was faster for me to level up all of the classes to 70 than it was to do 500 bounties.
2176000	2180000	But the trick is, for those of you Diablo players, you probably already know this.
2180000	2188000	Take your main quote-unquote character and just do enough greater rifts to get your Gem of Ease, the XP gem, up to level 25.
2188000	2196000	So, you can socket it in any weapon and then it drops the item level requirement of the weapon to level 1 and provides a huge boost.
2196000	2210000	And so, what you do, you put the gem in your stash, roll a, let's say, Crusader or whatever new character you want to do, and then craft a weapon at the table that's a legendary level 70 weapon, socket the gem into it, and your first 40 levels are done in like five minutes.
2210000	2216000	You just fly through the beginning levels and then, you know, you don't have to worry about the later ones when the XP boost isn't enough to carry you through.
2217000	2229000	So, yeah, I did all the Diablo 3 stuff, so that was exciting to get the platinum trophy because I actually, I'm not sure I have any other platinum trophies. I think that was my first one.
2229000	2236000	I think I've gotten every trophy in other games, but they didn't have platinums. I got like a gold for getting through everything.
2236000	2242000	I've gotten a few platinums. I know, like in the Lego Marvel games, I've done those, but those are like cake.
2243000	2258000	I'm trying to get platinum in Skyrim, but that's going to be a pain in the ass because they have, you know, branching achievements for like, was it being a vampire and being like a werewolf and stuff.
2258000	2270000	I don't want to be a werewolf or a vampire in those, but I'm going to have to do that for a little bit so that I can get all those and then go back to a previous save, which, good luck with that because there's like a million saves I have for Skyrim.
2270000	2277000	Yeah, yeah, good luck tracking all that. So yeah, so now I don't know what platinum I'll work on next, who knows.
2277000	2278000	Overwatch?
2278000	2289000	I don't know about that. I'm not good enough at Overwatch, I don't think to do that. I mean, Overwatch is a lot of fun to play, don't get me wrong, and I did play some of that on Friday night with Alan, but not enough to really get the trophies for that.
2290000	2301000	So that was some of my console and PC gaming this week. Didn't do any AR gaming as well. There's an event going on in Ingress, I'm like halfway through it, so I'm trying to finish that one out just to be done with it and get my stupid little medal.
2301000	2313000	Just because those limited time things, if you don't do it during the limited time, you feel like you miss out. Still been trying to do Pokemon Go. I haven't been as active in Pokemon Go just because I kind of feel like that game is in a little bit of a lull.
2313000	2315000	Like I like the events, I like-
2315000	2316000	Yeah, the events kind of help out because-
2316000	2323000	Yeah, those things have really helped, but I feel like, I just feel like the gym game is garbage in that game right now.
2323000	2324000	Yeah, I don't even, yeah.
2325000	2346000	But the big rumor is Niantic is going to do something with it, and we're all kind of waiting to see what is the anti-spoof, anti-cheat, like people have actually data mined these newer versions of Pokemon Go that come out, and there's talk in there about raids, so now you might be raiding gyms with people.
2346000	2360000	And that could be very interesting, so yeah. I mean, Ingress is more fun when you play with other people, and you can do stronger things. You build stronger portals when you're playing with other people, so it'd make a lot of sense that maybe Pokemon Go wants to do some of that.
2360000	2365000	Well, they still don't have any sort of team-based stuff yet because we have teams, but it doesn't really do anything.
2365000	2384000	And to be clear, before I get corrected on it, you can do two people at once attacking a gym, but even that, if you don't start at the exact same time, it's kind of buggy, and there's all these little quirks that go with it, so yes, it's there, but it's kind of- it's like the only way to take out a Blissey, is to do two people.
2384000	2393000	So anyway, so just waiting to see what continues in Pokemon Go, but otherwise, hell yeah, I still need to collect my Stardust bonus every day because that's the hardest stuff to get if you're not doing gyms.
2394000	2406000	Anyway, what else have I been playing? So, yesterday, my pal Shane and I took a road trip to Concord. We went to round one and played some of the Japanese arcade games.
2406000	2415000	And what was really cool about it is that we met our pals, Captain Spike and First Mate Slidekick from GameBui.org. GameBui.org. They were there, another show on the network here.
2415000	2422000	And of course, my pal, my long-time pal Extrafur from other shows, like Courthouse and stuff, and his partner. So, it was like all six of us met up and played some games.
2422000	2430000	So, it was a lot of fun. It was like kind of a little reunion of sorts from all these people that have done podcasts together and just people that are my friends.
2430000	2440000	So, you know, we hung out, played some of the games. I got to play a little bit of DDR Ace, which I don't usually do a lot of DDR at my age, but I had fun.
2440000	2451000	I was that guy that got up on the machine and I would do one or two of the new songs, but then I was like, I want to go back and go into DDR Fifth Mix and I'm going to play Insertion and all these old-ass songs.
2451000	2461000	So, I was having fun with that. But here's the game that I played more than any other at round one. The arcade version of Theatrhythm they have.
2461000	2473000	And it's different because Theatrhythm, of course, is a DS game and so it's mostly based on the touchpads. So, you're doing, you know, you're tapping the screen, you're moving the stylus different directions.
2473000	2483000	Well, obviously, the arcade doesn't really have the touchscreen. Well, actually, what's weird, it does. You can actually touch the screen to pick your songs and all that stuff, but that's not how you control the game.
2484000	2496000	You have these buttons and, like, nubs. So, like, imagine, like, extend your hand out, your thumbs would be on a button, the palms of your hands would be on these nubs.
2496000	2507000	And so, when it's time to do, like, the little tap, tap, tap, you used your thumbs to press the buttons. And when it's time to do, like, the up, down, like those swipes, you push that direction on the nubs.
2507000	2517000	So, it really kind of changes the game a lot, obviously, but it also feels like something they could do on a PlayStation 4 because you could do this with analog controllers.
2517000	2528000	So, it's interesting to me that it hasn't been ported over there yet, but anyway. But, yeah, the arcade version was a lot of fun. I actually bought the card that works with Theatrhythm's system because it's also for Groove Coaster and all this stuff.
2528000	2540000	So, I actually bought the card and I was, like, saving my progress and, yeah, I was having fun. I just, I wish I could have understood, could have understand more of what was in the menus because they are, it's 100% Japanese.
2540000	2552000	And I, as you guys know, I don't read or speak a lick of it. So, I didn't understand. I mean, I kind of, like, figured some of it out. Like, I was like, oh, there's like a Soul Calibur-esque red versus blue thing going on.
2552000	2562000	So, at the end of the match, you would choose, like, which crystal on the battlefield do you want to represent and you could, like, either take energy away or add energy to it. So, there's all this kind of funky stuff going on there.
2562000	2572000	But it's also, it's so interesting and Theatrhythm, I think, really shows, like, how much the arcade games have kind of taken from mobile phones, you know, and you see a lot of this in the Japanese games as well.
2572000	2586000	Is that, like, oh, you get a daily logon bonus for signing in and, like, when you do have the card, you unlock more characters. You can actually purchase songs with in-game credits that would then show up.
2586000	2594000	Like, so, I bought the Mugamog song from Final Fantasy XIV and so I could actually play that in a later game. So, just, like, lots of neat little stuff like that.
2594000	2606000	So, yeah, I spent a lot of time playing Theatrhythm. I played, like, six games in a row. So, which doesn't sound like much, but when you consider, you know, it's three songs a game, it's a good, you know, at least 10 to 15 minutes.
2606000	2610000	I mean, I spent a good time playing that. So, anyway.
2610000	2619000	Yeah, it's just 100matt in chat says, don't sell yourself short. You've been reading Japanese for 10 plus years during the release dates. Oh, yeah, and I do such a good job of it, too, huh?
2619000	2630000	So, anyway. There you go. That's, uh, that was, so I, you know, played some of that and some of the other music games. I played some BeatMania 2DX. God, I already forgot the name of the new one.
2630000	2636000	Cinnabuzz. That was it. Cinnabuzz. Cinnabon. Cinnabon. That's it. It was 2DX Cinnabon.
2636000	2637000	I want Cinnabon.
2638000	2652000	Was the new one. So, I was playing that, but the volume on the machine was way too low, and I tried to do all the tricks. So, the equalizer, it wouldn't work because it's right next to Groove Coaster, and they had Groove Coaster at, like, the highest level it could go.
2652000	2661000	So, like, I could kind of get through 2DX, but the minute somebody came up and put their card into Groove Coaster to play, I couldn't hear a goddamn thing. All I could hear was that Groove Coaster machine.
2661000	2675000	So, round one needs to balance some of their noise out a little bit, or I just need to not be stupid and keep forgetting my headphones at home, because I could be plugging my headphones into these games, and then I wouldn't have to worry about any of this stuff, but alas, I forgot.
2675000	2682000	So, there you go. Yeah, and that's what Rama and Chad says. Headphones? Yeah, yeah, I forgot. All right, leave me alone. Leave me alone.
2682000	2693000	I guess, you know, it's not like round one isn't in a fucking mall, so I could have just walked out, bought headphones, and brought them back, but then it's like, I have, like, a million pairs of headphones here at home.
2693000	2703000	Like, Alan would be so mad at me if it's like, oh, because I'm stupid and I forgot, I bought more headphones while I was at the mall. He wouldn't really get mad, but he would roll his eyes. So, there you go.
2704000	2713000	ActDeft in chat says, Rob Roberts, did Theater of the Arcade have Crazy Chocobo? ActDeft, you're going to be proud of me when I answer that with, I didn't look for it.
2713000	2723000	I don't think it was there, though. I think there was, like, one song, because that was from Final Fantasy XIII-2, right? I think they had, like, one song from XIII-2 in it, and it wasn't that, so there you go.
2723000	2732000	Anyway, I have talked plenty about my gaming week. There it was. So, I did a lot this week. I had a pretty diverse week there, so there you go. Yes, DarkSakura?
2732000	2735000	We need to have a momentous event.
2735000	2736000	Yes, what's that?
2736000	2737000	Right now.
2737000	2742000	What? Oh, you want to do this? Some food tasting here?
2742000	2743000	It's happening.
2743000	2745000	Okay, so tell our listeners what you found at the store.
2745000	2747000	Waffles and syrup Oreos.
2747000	2753000	I've been wanting to try these. I have, I have. So, I'm really curious about this.
2753000	2757000	I saw it. It was so random. So, go ahead and kick us off while I lift the tab.
2757000	2762000	All right, well, I want to go into housekeeping real quick, because I do have a couple things to get into for housekeeping tonight.
2762000	2770000	First off, because I forgot to do it on the call, I want to embarrass Bobby Black Wolf for the late Happy Birthday Bobby Black Wolf.
2770000	2776000	He's years old, but he'll tell you he's 29. So, Happy Birthday Bobby Black Wolf.
2776000	2778000	Put this in your mouth.
2778000	2782000	Well, if you insist. All right, so waffles and syrup Oreo. Here we go.
2782000	2784000	Yeah, this is great radio.
2784000	2791000	I know, but you know what? Deal. It's food. If I gave you a cookie, you'd stop what you're doing too.
2791000	2792000	It's weird.
2792000	2794000	That is weird.
2794000	2795000	It's not bad.
2795000	2799000	It doesn't, I don't know if that really tastes like waffles and syrup to me.
2799000	2801000	I taste maple.
2801000	2807000	It tastes, it tastes like kind of an, it tastes like one of those like super basic shortbread cookies.
2807000	2809000	With maple.
2809000	2810000	I don't even really taste the maple.
2810000	2811000	I taste the maple.
2811000	2815000	These are a little bit of a letdown to me. I don't know. I don't know. All right. Anyway.
2815000	2824000	All right. Other housekeeping. Remember, we won't be here at the end of June. June 25th is the day we're not going to be here.
2824000	2828000	But our 15th anniversary show is June 18th.
2828000	2829000	Yay.
2829000	2837000	And E3 is coming up. June 11th. We're going to be cut short by Bethesda, but we'll have a big E3 spectacular on June 11th. That'll be fun.
2837000	2840000	None of us sadly going to E3 this year.
2841000	2849000	But yeah, we've gone into the reasons extensively on previous episodes and the long and the short of it is E3 just isn't what it used to be.
2849000	2850000	So we don't really go.
2850000	2852000	Don't catch San Francisco people at Pride.
2852000	2861000	I'm very curious though to see what happens with the public being open to, because I do know some people that are going.
2861000	2866000	In fact, Captain Spike from Game Buoy is trying to go.
2866000	2870000	I think he has the tickets, but he just, you know, he's trying to juggle stuff with work.
2870000	2872000	So I'll be very curious to hear his thoughts on it.
2872000	2875000	I'm not sure if the gals from Ninja's Electric Sisterhood.
2875000	2879000	I don't know if Ninja's Sister and Pandalicious are going.
2879000	2885000	They go almost every year, but there was just a wedding that happens.
2885000	2889000	I'm not sure if they are actually going, but we'll see.
2889000	2891000	So I'll hopefully be taught.
2891000	2894000	Oh, Bobby Blackwell says they got rejected. What?
2894000	2901000	This is all part of that stupid, the way we're opening this up to the public is by rejecting all of the independent media,
2901000	2906000	which is part of the reason why I think this whole thing is ridiculous.
2906000	2911000	But anyway, so Bobby Blackwell says Ninja's sister will be in LA and going to parties.
2911000	2913000	And Rama says Panda just got married.
2913000	2914000	Yeah, I know that.
2914000	2917000	But yeah, so Ninja's sister is going to LA and just going to parties.
2917000	2919000	Well, that's one way to do E3, I'll tell you that.
2920000	2929000	All right. And so what, on the 25th when we're not here, the show's being canceled because I'm taking a trip to Chicago.
2929000	2932000	I'm actually going to Chicago Pride for the very first time is happening.
2932000	2937000	But Dark Soccer, you just shouted there. You're going to San Francisco Pride the same day, right?
2937000	2938000	I am.
2938000	2941000	All right, so that's awesome that we're covering different stuff. Cool.
2941000	2946000	All right, let's get into some gaming news and what's going on in video games.
2946000	2947000	This is still so fucking weird.
2947000	2949000	Yeah, I don't know if I like these as much as like the Red Velvet ones.
2949000	2950000	Well, you're keeping the bag.
2952000	2957000	Great. I'm trying to lose weight because I have a Pride event coming up, but oh well.
2957000	2958000	Anyway.
2958000	2959000	Start tomorrow.
2959000	2962000	Let's get into video game news. Loki.
2962000	2967000	So Square Enix has announced that they have decided to withdraw from business.
2967000	2970000	Well, their English in this press release is not very good,
2970000	2976000	but decided to withdraw from the business of IO Interactive or doing business with IO Interactive.
2976000	2980000	So right now they're starting discussions with potential new investors
2980000	2985000	and are currently in negotiations to secure investment,
2985000	2988000	meaning that they're looking to sell the company.
2988000	2993000	Of course, IO Interactive did a lot of different things, including, you know,
2993000	2997000	Cane of Lynch, the Hitman series, and, you know, other games.
2997000	3001000	So interesting to see what happens with that.
3001000	3005000	So I'm assuming the transition to the episodic Hitman didn't work out so well.
3006000	3008000	I didn't think it was doing so bad.
3008000	3013000	In fact, I've heard a lot of positive stuff around the Hitman, so the episodic stuff.
3013000	3018000	Those are not usually games that I get into, so I myself have not really explored these games.
3018000	3021000	I don't know about you guys in chat over at live.vognetwork.com
3021000	3024000	if you guys have thoughts on the Hitman transition to episodic.
3024000	3029000	I'll kind of rely on you guys to tell me if it's been a good thing or a bad thing or what,
3029000	3034000	but my assumption is that risk didn't pay off or Square wouldn't be looking to unload them right now.
3035000	3038000	But are there expectations for the franchise too high?
3038000	3040000	I remember with Tomb Raider, they were like,
3040000	3043000	Oh, we only made, was it $300 million or something?
3043000	3044000	I'm like, that's terrible.
3044000	3046000	Yeah, we only sold so many copies, and it was like,
3046000	3049000	that actually sounds like a lot of copies that you sold, sir.
3049000	3052000	And well, but to be fair, Tomb Raider did get a sequel,
3052000	3054000	and the sequel was extremely well received.
3054000	3057000	And haven't there been rumors and rumblings that a third one,
3057000	3061000	I mean, it seems kind of obvious that they have this whole engine built.
3061000	3063000	The games are doing well enough.
3063000	3065000	Probably going to be another one, and they're doing a movie, aren't they?
3065000	3067000	Yes, there is a movie for sure, yeah,
3067000	3070000	because there were some photos that leaked from the set and so forth.
3070000	3073000	So, I mean, it's very possible a third game is going to show up at this E3.
3073000	3078000	In fact, I thought I heard that Rise of the Tomb Raider did well on PlayStation 4.
3078000	3082000	They actually called that out as part of Square Enix's financials.
3082000	3086000	Well, maybe we can stop this nonsense of console exclusives for a year.
3086000	3088000	Oh, yeah, I would bet if there's a third Tomb Raider game,
3088000	3090000	that console exclusive stuff ain't happening.
3090000	3092000	It's going to be out everywhere at once.
3092000	3094000	But I would imagine if they're doing a third game,
3094000	3099000	it's probably cheaper for them to just use the same engine they developed
3099000	3101000	and spent all their resources on in the first game,
3101000	3103000	which I assume is what they're using in the second game,
3103000	3105000	and then continue on into the third game, right?
3105000	3109000	So they're kind of getting the most bang for their buck from that engine?
3109000	3111000	I mean, if it works for what they need,
3111000	3117000	I mean, if it's able to handle whatever they need to render, I mean, sure, why not?
3117000	3120000	Okay, so some folks in chat have played Hitman.
3120000	3122000	Tigercaw, it doesn't sound like he's played it,
3122000	3125000	but saying that new Hitman game was such a huge success
3125000	3127000	that its future is in doubt. I wonder why.
3127000	3129000	So yeah, kind of weird.
3129000	3130000	But MXC in chat says,
3130000	3133000	I was super nervous about the episodicness,
3133000	3135000	but the new Hitman is fantastic.
3135000	3138000	Each stage is so big and full of things to potentially do,
3138000	3140000	and by parceling them out as episodes,
3140000	3142000	you really got the time to learn each level.
3142000	3145000	So it doesn't sound like this episode.
3145000	3146000	It didn't look bad.
3146000	3147000	Yeah, it did.
3147000	3148000	Just not my type of game,
3148000	3150000	I like watching videos of people playing it.
3150000	3151000	Yeah.
3151000	3154000	So, well, a bummer to IO Interactive,
3154000	3159000	but at least, I mean, for what silver lining we can find,
3159000	3162000	at least Square Enix didn't just close the studio and lay everybody off.
3162000	3163000	We're not talking about job launch yet, right?
3163000	3165000	They can be picked up by somebody else
3165000	3169000	and continue on with whatever new franchise they want to develop.
3169000	3172000	But would they get to keep the Hitman IP,
3172000	3173000	or would that stay with Square Enix?
3173000	3175000	I would imagine that would stay with Square Enix.
3175000	3176000	Interesting.
3176000	3177000	Well, I don't know.
3177000	3180000	It depends on what they're negotiating to sell.
3180000	3183000	If they're selling the studio and IP, then maybe.
3183000	3187000	I wonder if they would give Hitman to another studio like Crystal Dynamics
3187000	3189000	or maybe even in Japan somewhere or something,
3189000	3193000	or if they would just put the series on ice for a little while.
3193000	3195000	Who knows?
3195000	3197000	There wasn't enough Cup Noodle in Hitman.
3197000	3200000	Oh, stop it.
3200000	3202000	All right, let's move on to another big series.
3202000	3205000	Of course, as we are creeping more and more closer to E3,
3205000	3207000	there's a lot of rumors and things that are coming out,
3207000	3210000	but this one's got even some screenshots to prove it,
3210000	3213000	and that is the future for Assassin's Creed.
3213000	3215000	Now, here's the interesting thing about Assassin's Creed.
3215000	3218000	It's kind of got two working titles right now.
3218000	3222000	I guess the original working title of the game was Assassin's Creed Origins,
3222000	3225000	but now they're saying the Assassin's Creed game,
3225000	3227000	the title is Assassin's Creed Empire.
3227000	3229000	Sounds like it's going to be the new Assassin's Creed game.
3229000	3234000	It can't be Origins because I think they've been using that as a subtitle for other things.
3234000	3236000	Yeah, so that was the working title.
3236000	3238000	So it sounds like the actual title may be Empire.
3238000	3241000	Now, keep in mind, Assassin's Creed has been on ice.
3241000	3244000	It didn't get a game last year because of the whole fiasco that happened
3244000	3246000	with the last game that they did,
3246000	3249000	so they've had a little more time to work on this game.
3249000	3251000	And apparently a screenshot leaked out.
3251000	3255000	There was a Reddit user that actually leaked this picture,
3255000	3258000	and it sounds like it could have been internal.
3258000	3260000	They're thinking there's some stuff in the name.
3260000	3266000	Well, it says shout out to Ashraf and possibly saying,
3266000	3269000	you know, it's name checking this guy, but it probably isn't this guy
3269000	3272000	who's an actual Ubisoft staffer who worked on Black Flag and so forth.
3272000	3275000	So who knows? It could have been an internal thing.
3275000	3279000	I would think it's a smart thing to do to get a little hype for your game.
3279000	3283000	Why not, quote unquote, leak a screenshot to Reddit
3283000	3286000	and let the internet hype on that for a little while
3286000	3289000	and let all the game blogs and podcasts talk about it like we're doing now.
3289000	3292000	So anyway, it's a picture of a picture,
3292000	3295000	so it's not like an actual dump from the screen.
3295000	3299000	It's a picture of a monitor, but it actually shows a character on a boat
3299000	3302000	who's wielding a bow and arrow wearing a shield on their back.
3302000	3304000	So you can actually see.
3304000	3306000	And it looks like they're on a boat again,
3306000	3309000	which indicates there could be some more naval things going on here.
3309000	3311000	I'm on a boat.
3311000	3314000	It also shows that the mission is called Assassinate the Crocodile.
3314000	3316000	It sounds like very serious business,
3316000	3319000	although the crocodile could be codenamed for an individual,
3319000	3320000	you know, somebody on another boat.
3320000	3322000	It's Peter Pan.
3322000	3324000	Do not kill Peter Pan.
3324000	3326000	So anyway, interesting.
3326000	3329000	And apparently it actually says in the text for the mission,
3329000	3332000	follow Shadia to Kenut's Villa.
3332000	3334000	I'm probably mispronouncing these names, sorry,
3334000	3337000	but those names have to do with the Queen of Egypt.
3337000	3341000	So this is possibly like an Egypt-based game. Who knows?
3341000	3345000	But some other rumors about the game is that apparently the game is huge.
3345000	3348000	It is an open world experience set in Egypt,
3348000	3352000	telling the tale of the original Assassin's Guild.
3352000	3354000	It's sounding like it's a game.
3354000	3356000	They are saying it's as big as Skyrim,
3356000	3360000	which seeing how Zelda Breath of the Wild did,
3360000	3362000	that stuff is all the rage right now.
3362000	3366000	Let's take the vast open world-ness and adapt it to our game.
3366000	3368000	And for Zelda Breath of the Wild,
3368000	3371000	that has actually worked out very, very, very, very, very well for them.
3371000	3372000	So it'll be interesting.
3372000	3377000	What do you think of Assassin's Creed going to an open world, large format?
3377000	3381000	It was pretty open world as it was, just not a huge environment,
3381000	3384000	as long as it's interesting and fun.
3384000	3387000	I still don't want to play it, but...
3387000	3393000	Now also, they're talking about that this game actually will have two protagonists in it.
3393000	3395000	There will be a pair of protagonists.
3395000	3398000	It's a male and a female, which, if you remember,
3398000	3402000	one of the reasons the Assassin's Creed Unity game got a lot of shit
3402000	3405000	was the whole line about rendering females is hard.
3405000	3406000	Remember that whole thing?
3406000	3410000	Well, they did show examples of how hard it was to render anything.
3410000	3411000	Yes, exactly.
3411000	3416000	So Ubisoft may be trying to do a little better there by...
3416000	3420000	I don't know if there is two protagonists you will ping-pong
3420000	3423000	and play a little bit of each, or if you get to pick one or the other,
3423000	3425000	or what the deal is there,
3425000	3428000	but it sounds like they're going to have a man and a woman for you to choose from
3428000	3431000	in the new Assassin's Creed game.
3431000	3432000	Interesting.
3432000	3435000	So we'll see what happens with this.
3435000	3438000	I assume much more information to come at E3.
3438000	3441000	This will probably be a big highlight at an Ubisoft press conference,
3441000	3443000	assuming they do one, but they do every year.
3443000	3444000	Yeah, I think they're doing one.
3444000	3445000	Did they already time it?
3445000	3446000	I didn't know they announced the time.
3446000	3450000	Maybe not. Maybe I just assumed they are.
3450000	3451000	Yeah, they do one every year.
3451000	3453000	Hopefully Ayesha Tyler is back to host it.
3453000	3454000	I enjoy her as a host.
3454000	3457000	I know she gets mixed reviews, but she is a gamer.
3457000	3459000	She loves her Gears of War and stuff,
3459000	3463000	so I'm all for her being a host again at Ubisoft.
3463000	3465000	I think she's better than...
3465000	3467000	Who's the other comedian that they had before?
3467000	3469000	The guy from Community who was on the soup.
3469000	3470000	Joel McHale.
3470000	3472000	No, no, no. Joel McHale.
3472000	3473000	For him.
3473000	3475000	There was...
3475000	3478000	It's the other white comedian that was so funny.
3478000	3479000	Well, there's so many.
3479000	3480000	I can see his face, but I can't...
3480000	3482000	Carrot Top, Rob Schneider.
3483000	3485000	No, he was in the stupid...
3485000	3487000	God, I can see his stupid face,
3487000	3489000	but I can't think of his stupid name.
3489000	3490000	Maybe somebody in chat knows.
3490000	3491000	I don't know.
3491000	3492000	Darktitsius is Jamie Kennedy?
3492000	3493000	Yes, thank you.
3493000	3494000	Oh, God.
3494000	3495000	Yes, Jamie Kennedy.
3495000	3496000	I'd erase that from my mind.
3496000	3497000	He's not funny.
3497000	3500000	Exactly. Exactly.
3501000	3503000	He's the guy from Scream that everybody likes.
3503000	3505000	He's only comedian by occupation.
3508000	3509000	I forgot he had done that.
3509000	3510000	That's right, he did do that.
3510000	3511000	All right.
3511000	3512000	Joel McHale is all right.
3512000	3515000	I really wish I had cable, because I'd still watch the soup.
3515000	3517000	Ayesha Tyler's just busy, though, but I think she lives in L.A.
3517000	3519000	That's where they do The Talk, right?
3519000	3520000	Because The Talk is...
3520000	3521000	Is she on Talk To Now, too?
3521000	3523000	Well, she's on the...
3523000	3525000	CBS has their own version of The View called The Talk
3525000	3529000	with, like, Julie Chen and the girl that was on Roseanne all grown up.
3529000	3530000	Sharon Osbourne.
3530000	3531000	That's her show.
3531000	3533000	And Ayesha Tyler is one of the panelists on that show.
3533000	3535000	She has been for, like, two years, Loki.
3535000	3538000	Yeah, because, you know, I watch all those morning women talk shows.
3538000	3540000	Well, maybe your wife makes you, because your wife makes you.
3540000	3541000	She does it!
3541000	3543000	Like, when am I going to have time to do that shit?
3543000	3544000	I mean, seriously.
3544000	3545000	Oh, I'm going to...
3545000	3547000	I'm going for The Talk to figure out what...
3547000	3550000	I want to hear your opinion about all the internet news I read yesterday.
3550000	3551000	But she's busy.
3551000	3553000	Okay, so one of the few shows I watch on Netflix is Chelsea Handler.
3553000	3554000	Like, don't judge me.
3554000	3555000	I love her.
3555000	3559000	But Ayesha Tyler was on Chelsea's show, and she's got a movie coming out.
3559000	3562000	Like, she directed and wrote a movie, or I don't know if she wrote it, but she directed it.
3562000	3564000	And so she's probably busy.
3564000	3566000	I would be very surprised if she does the Ubisoft thing.
3566000	3567000	She's very busy.
3567000	3568000	Like, what is it?
3568000	3574000	She was recording for Archer, doing talk show, doing her... whose line?
3574000	3576000	She's like the female Ryan Seacrest.
3576000	3578000	Ryan Seacrest? Dude.
3578000	3582000	You hate on that guy, but man, that guy fucking works.
3582000	3585000	He's got employment out the ass.
3585000	3586000	Yeah.
3586000	3590000	He's got more jobs than any of us do, so you gotta do that.
3590000	3592000	Jamie, I feel like you're dying to say something.
3592000	3594000	I just felt ready to say, though, she has more talent.
3596000	3597000	Fair enough.
3597000	3598000	I'd agree, I'd agree.
3598000	3601000	I mean, I like Ryan Seacrest, but I love Ayesha Tyler, so there you go.
3601000	3603000	Remember, where there's a woman, there's a way.
3603000	3606000	And Ryan Seacrest, I don't believe is a gamer.
3606000	3608000	Ayesha Tyler is, so there's that.
3608000	3610000	All right, anyhow.
3610000	3613000	Wasn't this supposed to be a story about Assassin's Creed, and now it's turned into a
3613000	3615000	let's talk about Ayesha Tyler's career?
3615000	3618000	Maybe Ayesha Tyler can voice a new Assassin in...
3618000	3619000	Why not?
3619000	3620000	Why not?
3620000	3621000	Why not?
3621000	3624000	She was a character in Gears of War, if I remember right.
3624000	3626000	She was always a big fan of that series, so anyway.
3626000	3628000	Or was it Halo?
3628000	3630000	I swear she showed up in some video game, though.
3630000	3634000	Now I know that Conan O'Brien was a character in Halo 5.
3634000	3636000	Him and Andy.
3636000	3638000	That's right, oh my god.
3638000	3640000	All right, let's move on to something else.
3640000	3644000	This is the new story I don't want to talk about, but we need to, right, Dark Sakura?
3647000	3650000	I can't sigh any louder for the phone.
3650000	3652000	Or for the mic.
3652000	3655000	We love our Mass Effect.
3655000	3657000	We mostly love BioWare.
3657000	3658000	Mostly.
3658000	3659000	Mostly.
3659000	3664000	But this is just, I really don't know what to make of it.
3664000	3673000	So basically, BioWare Montreal is being turned into a support studio.
3673000	3679000	And that means that their work is being moved on to other franchises.
3680000	3689000	In fact, a big group of the BioWare Montreal employees were moved over to work on Star Wars Battlefront II.
3689000	3694000	And the rest of them are going on to another property that's codenamed Dylan.
3697000	3699000	That's that other sci-fi game they're working on.
3699000	3701000	Because you know BioWare's got a new IP that they're doing.
3701000	3702000	Yeah, I know.
3702000	3705000	And the rumor is, it's an answer to Destiny.
3705000	3707000	It's gonna be that whole type of thing.
3707000	3716000	Which, I kind of shudder like you at first too, but then Dark Sakura, I think about how fun multiplayer is in Mass Effect when it works.
3716000	3722000	So the first thing they need to do with Dylan, fucking fix Origin.
3722000	3724000	Or don't run the game through it.
3724000	3726000	I cannot stress this enough.
3726000	3731000	You know they won't do anything because Origin is their baby, whatever.
3731000	3733000	But anyway, sorry Dark Sakura, but I had to get that out.
3734000	3738000	But anyway, it doesn't mean that there won't be another Mass Effect game.
3738000	3741000	It means they're still supporting Mass Effect.
3741000	3746000	You know, maintaining the servers, making sure everything is supposedly working right, bringing out patches.
3746000	3749000	And we did just get a new add-on.
3749000	3755000	But at the same time, we really don't know what that's gonna spell for the future of Andromeda for right now.
3755000	3763000	Since I'm completely clueless into the whole Mass Effect series, wasn't Andromeda developed by a different BioWare team than the first three?
3763000	3765000	Yes, it was.
3765000	3768000	Montreal did not do the first three games.
3768000	3772000	The first three games were, I forget, Edmonton?
3772000	3774000	I think so.
3774000	3776000	What happened to them?
3776000	3778000	They're working on the Dylan game.
3778000	3786000	So Montreal, however, developed DLC for Mass Effect 3.
3786000	3788000	And it was good.
3788000	3790000	The Citadel DLC, in my opinion, was...
3790000	3792000	Oh no, Citadel DLC was...
3792000	3793000	No. Which one?
3793000	3794000	Omega.
3794000	3797000	Omega. They did Omega and that one was kinda...
3797000	3799000	Omega was okay. It was pretty fun.
3799000	3801000	But Citadel was great.
3801000	3805000	Citadel was wonderful. It was basically everyone's fanfics come to life.
3805000	3806000	Yeah.
3806000	3812000	So maybe they're gonna take them off of Mass Effect and bring back the original team to Mass Effect.
3812000	3813000	Well, the problem is...
3813000	3815000	The original team is working on Dylan.
3815000	3817000	Well, they're gonna be working on Dylan forever.
3817000	3819000	A lot of the original team is gone.
3819000	3821000	Casey Hudson, gone.
3821000	3823000	Like, you know, some of the story people, gone.
3823000	3825000	A good number of people left already on their own.
3825000	3830000	So, you know, I don't think they can exactly get the band all back together again.
3830000	3832000	Do you want to say more on this?
3832000	3834000	Because I got my own take, but I don't want to interrupt you.
3834000	3835000	No, go ahead.
3835000	3838000	So, I just... I mean...
3838000	3842000	God, I'm so confused with this because I'm disappointed, but I'm not surprised.
3842000	3845000	The minute the reaction to this game all over the internet was negative,
3845000	3849000	I was not surprised that this is the inevitable end point we're at is that
3849000	3852000	the game is gonna be put on hold for a little bit.
3852000	3854000	I guess kinda like Assassin's Creed was.
3854000	3856000	But then again, we weren't getting new Mass Effect games every year.
3856000	3861000	So my concern is that it's gonna be a very long time before we get another Mass Effect game.
3861000	3863000	In a way, I might be part of the problem.
3863000	3865000	I started... Well, I mean, I bought the game, so I'm not.
3865000	3867000	But I started playing Mass Effect Andromeda.
3867000	3869000	I didn't finish it.
3869000	3872000	But the reason I didn't finish it is because BioWare came out and said
3872000	3874000	they're gonna patch a whole bunch of stuff.
3874000	3879000	So I said, you know what, I'll just wait and play this one that has the fully realized romances
3879000	3880000	and all this other stuff.
3880000	3882000	Which that patch, I think, just came out.
3882000	3886000	It does not change the Gill romance or any of that stuff.
3886000	3890000	It just... It does other stuff, like outfits and things.
3890000	3892000	But see, isn't that kind of like the weird point now?
3892000	3895000	Like, we kind of are all doing that with these games.
3895000	3899000	It's like, they come out, it's like, well, I guess I'll just play it when it's finished patching.
3899000	3901000	Like, Just Cause 3, when it came out, was a piece of shit.
3901000	3903000	It ran fucking poorly.
3903000	3906000	And I was like, well, I'll just wait until, you know, the patch to play it.
3906000	3909000	Final Fantasy XV, when it came out, there was a bunch of stuff wrong with it
3909000	3911000	and they have the patching stuff to fix things.
3911000	3914000	Oh, okay, I'm gonna play it then when it's finished patching.
3914000	3917000	Now, at Mass Effect Andromeda, just fucking release your games working.
3917000	3922000	I played it right after it came out and I had no problem with it.
3922000	3925000	The animation issues weren't terribly distracting.
3925000	3928000	That's the thing. That's exactly right.
3928000	3931000	A lot of that shit was blown way out of proportion.
3931000	3934000	It really wasn't that bad at all. It was people nitpicking.
3934000	3936000	And I thought some of it was fucking funny.
3936000	3941000	Most of the shit on the internet is from people who didn't fucking play it.
3941000	3944000	And that's the thing that pisses me off more than anything.
3944000	3947000	However, and this is a big however,
3947000	3950000	I also think this game should have been delayed six more months.
3950000	3951000	I think so.
3951000	3956000	It should have been a holiday release and almost any Mass Effect fan I talk to agrees with this.
3956000	3957000	Yeah.
3957000	3963000	So, ultimately, the decisions was EA, I'm assuming it had to be, to put this game out.
3963000	3967000	EA's CEO did put out a statement about it.
3967000	3972000	They were really happy with how BioWare was doing and how they were treating Mass Effect.
3972000	3973000	And the quote here is,
3973000	3978000	Our expectations for Mass Effect are still strong for the future and the franchise overall.
3978000	3982000	But they are putting focus on live service games.
3986000	3993000	And Dungeon Buster follows that up with the same thing as EA saying they still have great confidence in BioWare and all this stuff.
3993000	3995000	Of course they do, because Andromeda ended up being a good game.
3995000	4001000	And EA shares some of the blame for why it came out of the oven a little early.
4001000	4006000	And, again, my other biggest bitch about Mass Effect Andromeda,
4006000	4009000	and no, I'm not going to shut up about this until they fix Origin,
4009000	4014000	I am fucking pissed that I did a match online where I used consumables,
4014000	4019000	which is something that, you know, either you use the in-game currency to get or you pay them money to get.
4019000	4025000	And I got kicked out of the match with five fucking seconds to go,
4025000	4028000	didn't get credit for a goddamn thing and lost my consumables.
4028000	4030000	And it's Origin's fault.
4030000	4037000	So EA shares some of the responsibility for why Mass Effect is as borked as it is.
4037000	4040000	Which isn't really all that borked.
4040000	4045000	Which isn't really all that borked except for some of these things that I'm not letting go, like the online thing.
4045000	4048000	But the single player experience is fine and all that stuff.
4048000	4052000	And it is disappointing to know that it's not going to get DLC.
4052000	4056000	Now, the original Mass Effect game didn't really have DLC.
4056000	4061000	I mean, it did, but it wasn't nearly as expansive as the DLC in Mass Effect 2 and 3.
4061000	4067000	But the game's already so big. It really is huge, and there's so much to do.
4067000	4072000	Like, I could beat the first Mass Effect in maybe a week if I played a little bit every day.
4072000	4075000	And this one took me three weeks of steady playing to beat.
4075000	4079000	Now, I didn't have a lot of time in one sit-down to play.
4079000	4084000	But, you know, I played for two to three hours a night every night.
4084000	4090000	And I was going for almost full completion. I wanted to at least, you know, keep certain people alive.
4093000	4096000	But I was super happy with it.
4096000	4102000	You know, it's like you were saying, the only people who were, you know, pissy about it were the people who weren't playing it.
4102000	4106000	Oh, well, I heard this. Did you fucking play it?
4106000	4109000	Well, no. Then shut up. I don't care.
4109000	4112000	Well, this blog said, did you play it?
4112000	4116000	No, but I watched it. No, shut up. Shut up.
4116000	4120000	Play the damn game and form your own fucking opinion.
4120000	4124000	Learn to think for yourself.
4124000	4126000	I don't think it's fair, to be honest. You know why?
4126000	4131000	Why am I gonna invest $60 in a game that looks that fucking janky? I'm sorry.
4131000	4133000	It doesn't look janky. It's a great game.
4133000	4135000	Based on the videos I've seen, it looks fucking janky.
4135000	4138000	But you are watching, like, two second clips of an 80 hour experience.
4138000	4141000	No, I'm not. I'm watching long plays of the game.
4141000	4148000	And I'm sorry. It looks fucking janky. I'm not investing $60 into a game that may be patched later on.
4148000	4153000	No, I don't think it's fair that I should have to do that. My point is, it should come out of the gate looking nice.
4153000	4156000	I want to know what you're looking at that looks so janky, because it's beautiful.
4156000	4164000	Look, I'm sorry. I cannot take this from somebody who is a fan of Skyrim and Bethesda and the shit that they get away with every time.
4164000	4167000	Why are you giving them a pass?
4167000	4174000	Because their games are janky. I know that going into it. Is Mass Effect advertised as a janky-ass game?
4174000	4175000	But it's not.
4175000	4180000	I think that says it all right. That's fine. I'm gonna take that answer. Y'all draw your own conclusions.
4180000	4183000	But it's not. I mean, maybe people are playing with shitty graphic cards. I don't know.
4183000	4192000	I upgraded my graphics card in the middle of my playthrough and I had zero problems. It was fluid. The animations were fine.
4192000	4194000	It was perfect.
4194000	4205000	If you're trying to introduce new people into the series and you're trying to get them interested, just the whole animations and everything, yeah, it does take away from the whole impact of scenes and stuff.
4205000	4211000	And I do. I don't want to play that. Also, I don't want to play it because it's not broken enough.
4211000	4221000	That's the thing, Loki. This is where Jamie and I are at. In Skyrim, you have the exact same problems, but yet you're giving that a pass.
4221000	4228000	And to be fair, Jamie and I have a history with Mass Effect and we've always loved the game, so yes, we're going to defend it a little more.
4228000	4234000	And you've always been a fan of the Elder Scrolls game, so you're going to defend that a little more. This is just that whole gamer thing coming into play.
4234000	4240000	See, the Elder Scrolls games were pretty. I just couldn't get into them. They were kind of boring.
4240000	4244000	I don't think they were pretty. They're long.
4244000	4247000	I think Elder Scrolls is pretty, actually. I would say Elder Scrolls is a pretty game.
4247000	4249000	Well, I thought Skyrim was certainly pretty.
4249000	4250000	Yeah, especially the HD.
4250000	4254000	I'm actually kind of enjoying Elder Scrolls Online for a little bit. I need to go back and play some more.
4254000	4266000	But the problems with animation, because I played pre-patch and post-patch, they were really minor. Really minor. Like, you had to be looking for them.
4266000	4271000	So anyway, I think the one thing we can all agree on here, as much as the chat room is like,
4271000	4276000	yeah, OLR, throw down. Look, at the end of the day, we're going to disagree on some games, but we're still going to eat Oreos, waffles, cookies together.
4276000	4281000	So, here's the thing. The one thing it sounds like we can all agree on, the game should have been delayed.
4281000	4285000	And the other thing we can agree on? Skyrim is janky.
4285000	4290000	Well, yeah, of course it is. That's why I like it. It is incredibly janky.
4290000	4300000	To Loki's credit, Loki is the only person that I've seen entertained by Driver 3 for hours and hours and hours because of how fucking janky it is.
4300000	4309000	I do want to ask this. Which people who played through Mass Effect Andromeda did not complain about Sam? Shut the fuck up, Sam.
4309000	4314000	I don't care about the weather, the radiation, bless whoever made the Shut Up Sam mod.
4314000	4317000	Which, didn't they just patch that in the game officially?
4317000	4318000	I don't know.
4318000	4319000	I think they did.
4319000	4321000	But Sam talks too much.
4321000	4325000	Alright, let's see. I gotta grab some comments from chat here.
4325000	4326000	Stoppy in chat says,
4326000	4336000	Sky, a game has to make a good first impression. I can name a handful of games that look like shit but are fun to play, but I'm not going to cry about people not giving them a chance because that's not how consumers work.
4336000	4339000	If it was free or close to it, that would be a different issue.
4339000	4343000	Speaking of free, let me tell you about a game that had a huge turnaround.
4343000	4347000	Diablo 3. Remember what a fucking garbage heap that game was when it first came out?
4347000	4348000	I thought it was fun.
4348000	4350000	But even when it very first came out?
4350000	4351000	Yeah, I thought it was fun.
4351000	4352000	It was rough.
4352000	4355000	I actually played it more right after it came out than after they changed everything.
4355000	4365000	It was rough. Well, that I'm not with you with because it came, when they finally got rid of the auction house, basically when they did the expansion, that game turned right around and now it's fantastic.
4365000	4376000	Or another one that I've played way, Final Fantasy XIV. The worst MMO I ever played in my life when it first came out. Now, the best.
4376000	4382000	So, I should say one of the best. So, I mean, games kind of can turn around in that regard.
4382000	4393000	But there's something about those two particular games and those two particular franchises where, and maybe it's just because of the weight of companies like Blizzard or the fact that it was an MMO with Square Enix and stuff,
4393000	4397000	where those games were kind of afforded a second chance that most games aren't given.
4397000	4404000	And I agree, at least in the extent of the first impression of a game is so important.
4404000	4415000	And that's why, and I said this on the show too, the 10 hour preview thing, again, what EA did through Origin, was the worst thing they could have done for Andromeda.
4415000	4421000	That preview thing was the worst thing they could have done for that game. But they did it and they should have delayed it.
4421000	4429000	Well, they have to do that because they sell that. That shouldn't be a thing that they sell to play a game a few hours early.
4430000	4439000	Again, I disagree with that and that's on EA in my opinion. Dungeon Buster in chat says, it's not perfect either, but they weren't as in your face about Andromeda's.
4439000	4447000	Heck, the original Mass Effect trilogy were incredibly polished compared to Andromeda for me. I don't think the original Mass Effect game had its issues too, but you know.
4447000	4451000	The original ones weren't great until after there were the good high res mods.
4452000	4463000	I remember the problems they had with rendering Turian faces, especially the ones for Garrus' face in the first one. And that shit never got really fixed. It took modders to fix it.
4463000	4477000	You want to know another game in a completely different genre from things that we're talking about that I think kind of failed to make a good first impression, at least for me, that apparently is being patched and is now a lot better than it was its first go around.
4477000	4492000	It's a recent game. Super Bomberman R. That game came out on the Switch, right? And I think that game, it's apparently selling pretty well, but I would say it's only selling well because it's one of a very few launch titles that's retail on the Switch.
4492000	4502000	That's the only reason that game is selling. I'm sorry. I don't buy into the whole, oh Bomberman, people love this again and all this. Now, that game was only selling because it was one of the few things available at retail.
4503000	4518000	Because I did not think that game was particularly great the first time I played it. Again, I was never into Bomberman that much to begin with. I think it's kind of an overrated franchise in my opinion and there's just going to always be certain games we all kind of disagree on.
4518000	4531000	But my understanding is I should give it a second shot because apparently they patched a lot. They changed a lot of stuff with that and they've been doing this free DLC and all that stuff. So there's another example of a game that kind of had a first impression for some people.
4531000	4542000	They know how it plays. I mean, they have units to play the game on. How do they not know this plays poorly? And they're like, well, that's good enough. I mean, that's the decision that they made.
4542000	4546000	Yeah, maybe they did. Maybe they did know. Unfortunately.
4546000	4556000	And then they come back, oh, look, oh, we hear you. We're going to make sure it's taken care of. What if we didn't hear from you? Oh, well, that's good enough for them. I mean, come on.
4556000	4568000	All right. In the interest of time, we're going to move on to our next story. But needless to say, I'm glad at least it doesn't sound like it's the last time we'll hear about Mass Effect, but it sounds like it's probably going to go to another team within BioWare.
4568000	4580000	And it'll also be interesting to see what happens with this new game that they're working on, which we should at least kind of get to see some glimpses of at E3. We'll see. Moving on though for now, Loki.
4580000	4596000	All right. So Steam put out this big blog post, or I should say Valve put out this big blog post about Steam, mainly the Steam store and talking about kind of where it's been and where they're going with it and how they're going to be making revisions.
4596000	4610000	And so one of the things you're talking about, you know, there's different users, of course, of the store, like people that are constantly viewing the store, people that just come there once a month, you know, different developers that have stuff in the store.
4610000	4626000	And they're talking about a little bit how, you know, the experiment with Greenlight was kind of a step towards opening up Steam to a wider range of games and developers. And, you know, they didn't entirely work out the way that they wanted to.
4626000	4633000	You know, they, you know, basically should have done some basic checks to make sure the game works and now they know that they need to do that on each title.
4633000	4639000	But of course, you know, not just, you know, filter between what, you know, their tastes are and stuff.
4639000	4647000	And then with that also, they're talking about how they're exposing now how these different recommendation algorithms work.
4647000	4658000	So, for example, you know, if you're recommended a game now, what they're showing you is, you know, instead of just, oh, hey, why am I being recommended to play, you know, Hoth of a Boyfriend or something like that?
4658000	4663000	You can see, OK, well, it's because it's similar to these games you played or the reviews are positive.
4663000	4669000	It's follow, you know, these curators that you follow recommended it, your friends like it, you know, that type of stuff.
4669000	4678000	And so it kind of gives you more of an insight to why, you know, you're being recommended something, which is kind of useful, I think, instead of just blindly being recommended something.
4678000	4683000	We see you're attracted to foul. Play Hoth of a Boyfriend.
4683000	4691000	Well, I'm glad they're addressing some of these things, because I do have to admit the Steam store is really like hard to navigate for me.
4691000	4697000	Like, and I actually I don't know, I, I think the personalization sometimes is almost a bit much.
4697000	4702000	I don't like it seems like every little thing in there is like, you would like this because you like this.
4702000	4704000	And that's not always the case. You know what I mean?
4704000	4707000	Like, I just sometimes I just kind of wish I could see the store.
4707000	4711000	That's just like, what are the new popular games? What are the spotlights on and all this?
4711000	4715000	That's just why we kind of have it still. I mean, but yeah, it's just all over the place.
4715000	4722000	It's all over the place. And it's just the Steam store is so bloated. That's the other big problem.
4722000	4732000	It's so bloated that it's kind of hard to navigate around. And to be fair, I mean, I kind of feel the same way about like the app stores on phones, be it Apple or Google.
4732000	4735000	Like there's just there's too fucking much. You know what I mean?
4735000	4738000	Yeah, it's really hard to find the diamonds.
4738000	4744000	Just one of the things, you know, playing those clicker games, which require you to watch lots of ads for different bonuses.
4744000	4750000	I get to see a lot of the different apps that are out there. And I got to say, man, all of them look the same.
4750000	4754000	Like they seriously, it's just like a fucking cookie cutter.
4754000	4757000	Oh, sure. One thing catches on like Clash of Clans or whatever.
4757000	4761000	You still don't understand how that fucking Pokémon game is. I took a bunch of screenshots. I haven't posted on Twitter or anything like that.
4761000	4762000	You should, you should.
4762000	4771000	But it's like a fucking like just in your face, just complete IP violation fest right there.
4771000	4774000	I'm like, how the fucking hell can you get away with this shit?
4774000	4776000	Tag Nintendo in your screencabs. That'd be fun.
4776000	4782000	I've already reported it for violating IP, but it's just ridiculous.
4782000	4786000	That's the thing is like the advertisements show the Pokémon stuff.
4786000	4790000	But when you actually go to the page for the game, it doesn't show any of the Pokémon stuff.
4790000	4796000	Cinco de Milo in chat says, Rob, how do you know you didn't like the game Steam recommended if you haven't played it yet?
4796000	4806000	I guess I could take a chance on some of them, but the realistic part is there's only so many in the hours, so many hours in the day I have to game.
4806000	4813000	Usually by the time I get to the store, I've already made the decision on what it is I'm going to buy.
4813000	4822000	It's kind of like when you go to the grocery store, you know, oh, I'm going to buy some apples and I'm going to get some, you know, lunches for work and all this stuff.
4822000	4824000	You know, you kind of already have like, you know what you're going to buy.
4824000	4828000	But granted, once in a while you get tempted with other things.
4828000	4838000	And that does happen to me on Steam, to be fair, is that sometimes I have, you know, bought things a little bit on a whim, but you know when it happens, Steam sale.
4838000	4842000	And I think a lot of y'all fall for it during the Steam sale as well.
4842000	4847000	It's like, oh, well, this game's a buck fifty right now. Shit. Why not? I'll buy it. Jump in.
4847000	4855000	And that's the thing too, like the Steam sales now, the way that they're doing them, where it's not different each day, it's kind of like you look at it and you're like, okay, I'm done.
4855000	4861000	You know, it's just, whereas I think they had more engagement when it was you mixing it up each day.
4861000	4866000	Granted, I mean, there's certain rules, you know, wait for the, you know, flash sales or whatever.
4866000	4872000	In a way, it's a bummer that the Steam streaming thing hasn't taken off more than it has.
4872000	4880000	I mean, did you guys remember that you can actually stream video games within Steam? Like it has its own Twitch competitor embedded in it, right?
4880000	4888000	You know, that would be kind of neat if you're in the store, you can actually see people that are kind of playing the game there in the store so you can get a sense for like what the game is really like.
4888000	4899000	Like get a live moment somewhere within the game. But, you know, then again, at the same time, you know, not every stream is the same and some are going to be like in very weird parts of the game.
4899000	4902000	Are people actually, is that stream the Twitch or is that like, you know?
4902000	4904000	No, it's Steam's own internal thing that they do.
4904000	4906000	Why would I use that then?
4906000	4908000	People are, it is out there.
4908000	4911000	I don't know, I just would think that people would want to be on Twitch or something.
4911000	4920000	The reason why I think of that is because I'm on the PlayStation Store and the Xbox Store, they do that, is that you have the whole like the game is there and then it's like you can click here and watch people that are playing it right now.
4920000	4922000	Yeah, but those people are streaming the Twitch.
4922000	4923000	They are.
4923000	4929000	So why would I use the service to stream to Steam to do advertising for them? Like that, pay me.
4929000	4931000	That's a great question.
4931000	4940000	So, all right. Anyhow, moving on. Let's talk about E3 and let's talk about Nintendo a little bit. We brought them up there in that last story.
4940000	4949000	They're detailing some of their E3 plans a little bit, what's going on. Of course, and this is no surprise, Super Mario Odyssey is going to be a big focus at E3.
4949000	4956000	They are saying this is the first ever opportunity to play Super Mario Odyssey, so that will be something that's available at E3.
4956000	4966000	Apparently, they are also doing a video instead of a press conference and this is expected, but this is getting a lot of interesting feedback on the Internet.
4966000	4972000	Instead of a Nintendo Direct, they're calling it Nintendo Spotlight E3 2017.
4972000	4978000	Some people taking issue with the name change, that it's not a Nintendo Direct, it's a Nintendo Spotlight.
4978000	4984000	I don't really see what the big fucking deal is. I think it's going to be the same thing that you got before.
4984000	4996000	I think the difference is, and the reason why they're calling it a Nintendo Spotlight, is because this time, you can go to E3 and play the games they're about to show.
4996000	5006000	I think that's the difference. I think that's all this boils down to is that they're making this video not just for everybody out there, but the people that are about to walk in the door and actually see these things in front of them at E3.
5007000	5016000	That's my thought. I don't know. But anyway, I just thought that was really weird on Twitter. A lot of people are like, oh, Nintendo's doing another thing and they need to be doing X, Y, Z.
5016000	5018000	I'm like, it's going to be...
5018000	5020000	So, are they doing their Best Buy tour again?
5020000	5024000	I don't think they need to. E3 is public now.
5024000	5026000	Yeah, I'm not going to pay to go down there.
5026000	5032000	I'm just saying, they're going to get that word of mouth anyway, so the Best Buy thing was always kind of a clusterfuck anyway.
5032000	5041000	But anyway, they are going to be, of course, during the spotlight, announcing new details for Nintendo Switch games launching this year, and Treehouse Live will be back.
5041000	5046000	There's going to be tournaments for ARMS, because that game is out right days after E3.
5046000	5047000	Before E3.
5047000	5048000	Oh, was it right before E3?
5048000	5050000	I thought it was, isn't it the early part of June?
5050000	5053000	I thought it was June 16th, or right after.
5053000	5054000	How is it after?
5054000	5057000	I don't remember. Maybe somebody in chat knows, but I thought ARMS was right after.
5057000	5059000	Maybe it is right before. Maybe you're right.
5059000	5061000	Here, let me take a look at the release date.
5061000	5063000	Thank you. If somebody in chat didn't beat you to it already.
5063000	5065000	Oh, it is on the 16th, yeah.
5065000	5067000	The 16th. Okay, so it's Friday after E3.
5067000	5074000	So anyway, they also will be doing Treehouse Live, and they are saying that there will be some announcements during Treehouse Live.
5074000	5080000	Usually those end up being things like DLC and some other cute little things. It's not major, major announcements.
5080000	5083000	Although, I don't know. I feel like there was a couple big ones that were dropped.
5083000	5088000	I remember at the Treehouse last year, that was the first time we got to see Pokemon Go.
5088000	5096000	Well, the beta had been going on at that point, but that was the first time that they could openly really show Pokemon Go, which was kind of a big deal.
5096000	5099000	Especially considering that that's not really a Nintendo game.
5099000	5107000	I mean, yes, it's an IP, but they really didn't have a lot to do with Pokemon Go besides the intellectual stuff from one of their subsidiaries.
5107000	5116000	Splatoon 2 will also be livestreamed from the show floor. That's another big release that's coming in July, so that will get a lot of focus as well.
5116000	5123000	I guess some people are taking issue with the fact that, does this mean there's not going to be anything else for the Switch this holiday?
5123000	5132000	And I don't think that's true. We know Xenoblade is another big one that's coming. They haven't talked about how that's going to play into E3, but they have dated that for holiday.
5132000	5142000	I think there's still definitely room for surprises, and I think this is the time to finally fucking tell us, like, when else are they going to talk about?
5142000	5143000	Virtual Console?
5143000	5151000	Virtual Console, the online program that we're supposed to start paying for around the end of summer, and some of this stuff.
5151000	5164000	I think some of these questions ought to be answered around the same timeframe, but at the same time, Nintendo can kind of do a direct, and has done a direct, whenever the fuck they feel like it.
5164000	5170000	So, if it isn't announced at E3, that doesn't mean it won't come three weeks later.
5171000	5184000	Does that make sense? Because I think, even with E3, they will still find a way to do another direct in July, just before Splatoon 2, to remind everybody that Splatoon 2 is coming and to get your pre-orders in.
5184000	5188000	So, Nintendo will do that stuff.
5189000	5200000	I think it's just a little different, what they're doing for E3, but it's not that different from what they did last year and the year before, except last year was solely Breath of the Wild, as we know.
5200000	5208000	But that's also a great comparison, too, is that, keep in mind, last E3, we didn't know about the Switch.
5208000	5217000	All we had was Breath of the Wild, and we knew that there was a new Nintendo system coming, but Nintendo didn't really start announcing any of that shit until way after E3.
5217000	5222000	So, Nintendo's on Nintendo's timetable, I suppose.
5222000	5230000	Let's see, come on, hand on your heart, and chat says, I'm hoping for Smash Bros., although it's Nintendo, so low expectations.
5230000	5234000	I don't know, we talked about this last week on Mario Kart 8.
5234000	5235000	Yeah, the remasters.
5235000	5241000	People are willing to re-buy the Wii U games, and there's a lot of people that straight up fucking miss the Wii U games.
5241000	5250000	I think Smash could stand to do very, very well on Switch. It would really not surprise me at all if they ended up doing a Smash Bros. port for Switch.
5250000	5263000	But I think if you're going to lower your expectations, you need to expect it's going to be the Wii U 3DS game with new stages, a few new characters, maybe some real surprise characters, though.
5263000	5267000	We might get shit like Bomberman, you know, was obviously a big part of the Switch lineup.
5267000	5272000	You know, you might get some real cool characters, but that would be about it, you know what I mean?
5272000	5274000	We'll see, you're shaking your head.
5274000	5280000	It just pisses me off, like, I have a Wii U, and this is insulting, it's absolutely insulting.
5280000	5284000	Oh hey, we're going to release this new system, it's going to have the same fucking games you already own.
5284000	5287000	Well, but at least that's not all they're doing.
5287000	5292000	There's plenty of other stuff too, like Mario Odyssey. I'm sure it's going to be badass.
5292000	5295000	So, you know, there's other stuff too.
5296000	5301000	It's not out, once again, I don't need to buy the system then because none of this shit is out.
5301000	5303000	I'm not buying the system until this shit is out.
5303000	5311000	Because, you know what, I was fucking burned by the 3DS, I wanted my fucking Saints Row and DJ Hero, and I got neither of them, so fuck that shit.
5311000	5314000	You wouldn't be able to find a Switch even if you wanted one.
5314000	5317000	We talking about it, I've seen them in stores all the time.
5317000	5319000	Are they? I thought they were still kind of hard to find.
5319000	5321000	No, not at all.
5321000	5323000	On several occasions I've seen them already.
5324000	5328000	Alright, let's move on. More potential E3 stuff, right, Jamie?
5328000	5331000	Well, we remember Nana On'Sha, right?
5331000	5332000	Mhm.
5332000	5336000	And Imus, who gave us Katarou Man.
5336000	5348000	Well, they're two big guys, Masiya Matsuura and Kei Chiyano are going to be getting together to make a game that is currently titled Project Rap Rabbit.
5348000	5351000	That is a new rhythm action adventure game.
5351000	5362000	Matsuura gave us Parappa, Vib Ribbon, Yano gave us Katarou Man, also Tatakae Oedon and the US remake Elite Beat Agents.
5362000	5365000	And so they're going to be working together.
5365000	5375000	There's not much else about it except that it seems to have this sort of ancient Japan vibe with some technology.
5375000	5387000	Like a motorized unicycle and some drones and a flying saucer and a giant toad and a rabbit.
5387000	5397000	I'm sorry, with the way his ears are tied up, I can't help but think of Usagi Ojimbo from the early TMNT stuff.
5398000	5406000	I like the art style, it looks really neat and it just says it's coming quote very soon.
5406000	5408000	Soon!
5408000	5412000	Ooh, maybe one of those surprise bombshells that it's on the store now.
5412000	5413000	Mayhap.
5413000	5416000	At E3. I don't want to get my hopes up that far, but maybe a summer release.
5416000	5417000	Mayhap.
5417000	5418000	Yeah.
5418000	5419000	So we'll see.
5419000	5424000	I think something you're definitely going to see at Sony's press conference seems all but guaranteed at this point.
5424000	5427000	Just a few more stories for you guys than the classic game of the week.
5427000	5429000	Or excuse me, actually this week we got a system, right?
5429000	5430000	Yep.
5430000	5431000	Classic system of the month. Loki.
5431000	5432000	Alright.
5432000	5436000	So this is pretty exciting, maybe something we'll hear a little bit more about during E3.
5436000	5447000	But we've got a brand new game coming from Edmund McMillan who is the creator of Super Meat Boy and the Binding of Isaac.
5447000	5456000	So, not sure what it is yet, but they've teased that we're coming close to announcing it and it's release date so keep an eye out for it.
5456000	5464000	I don't want to spoil the fun yet, but I can say this, it's hard, it's weird, it's personal, and it has amazing controls.
5464000	5470000	It's a totally unannounced IP and easily one of the largest games I've ever made level wise.
5470000	5471000	Oh, interesting.
5471000	5476000	But, you know, a lot of the other stuff, the way he describes it does sound like the other two games.
5476000	5478000	Not that that's a bad thing, those are both very good games.
5478000	5479000	Yeah, sound good.
5479000	5482000	So, yeah, we'll see. I'm curious if it's going to have a very similar art style.
5482000	5484000	Probably, they removed the reason.
5484000	5487000	Leap Boy and Isaac are very, very similar in the way they look, even though they play completely differently, you know?
5487000	5488000	Yeah.
5488000	5489000	So, yeah.
5489000	5493000	I'm sure that'll be an E3 surprise somewhere. We'll see.
5493000	5498000	Let's move on to, here's a character that could show up in a Smash Brothers.
5498000	5505000	I think they've requested, they being the fans, that she show up in Smash Brothers at some point and that's Shantae.
5505000	5508000	Shantae, you stay. No, not that Shantae.
5508000	5513000	This is Shantae, S-H-A-N-T-A-E. Shantae, the half genie hero.
5513000	5515000	I remember the Kickstarters for this game.
5515000	5519000	Yeah, and it's coming to Switch, which is a big surprise.
5519000	5521000	Big surprise, not.
5521000	5525000	But that's still awesome for Shantae and, again, people who missed it on the Wii U.
5525000	5531000	So, WayForward did confirm that Shantae, the half genie hero, is going to come to Nintendo Switch over the summer.
5531000	5536000	It will be a digital and a physical release. XSeed is going to be handling the physical release.
5536000	5542000	The game will be compatible with the HD Rumble and WayForward has announced all this stuff on Twitter.
5542000	5546000	So, that may be something you see a little bit of a clip on at E3.
5546000	5550000	And, again, puts Shantae out there.
5550000	5554000	So, you know, again, if they did want to put her in Smash Brothers and answer some of that fan feedback,
5554000	5559000	that would be a great way to kind of put her back out there in front.
5559000	5562000	I don't know. I think when it comes to the more indie games and stuff,
5562000	5566000	I think Shovel Knight is still one that a lot of people have their fingers and toes crossed for.
5566000	5571000	But Shantae is certainly one of the big ones out of the Nintendo indies. We'll see.
5571000	5577000	So, alright. But you know what? Let's take a trip down memory lane, shall we?
5577000	5582000	Let's take a trip to the past with the classic Game of the Week segment.
5583000	5586000	Every week, Dark's to the magic of radio.
5587000	5592000	Not that. There's no radio magic this week. How the hell was that MV3 still in there?
5594000	5595000	That's embarrassing.
5595000	5596000	More like radio tragic.
5596000	5599000	That was a radio tragedy right there. Alright.
5599000	5602000	Let's get to the classic Game of the Week.
5604000	5609000	And Dark Sakura is going to jump into the gaming vault and find a system.
5609000	5615000	Because plot twist in 2017, not only are there pre-recorded segments sometimes,
5615000	5617000	but there's a system. Actually, that was last year.
5617000	5619000	But there's a system of the month.
5619000	5622000	How is this a plot twist now that I've been doing it for five months?
5622000	5625000	That's true. I don't know. It's a continued twist. I don't know. Anyway.
5625000	5626000	The classic Game of the Week.
5626000	5627000	Spiral out of control.
5627000	5631000	Dark Sakura, what is the classic system of the month?
5631000	5634000	The Texas Instruments TI99-4A.
5635000	5637000	You remember this thing?
5637000	5638000	Yes, I do.
5638000	5641000	This was one of the first systems I ever played.
5641000	5647000	In fact, I would even go on record saying that I played one of these before I played an Atari 2600.
5647000	5652000	Or maybe roughly around the same time, but I have stronger memories of this because my friends had one.
5652000	5660000	The TI99-4A was a computer that was released in June of 1981.
5660000	5669000	It came out for $525 at the time, which today would be about $1300 now.
5669000	5677000	And it was an enhanced version of the TI99-4 that came out in 1979.
5677000	5684000	Now the one in 1979 came out for $1150, which would be about $3700 today.
5684000	5689000	So it actually was re-released with better stuff at a lower price point.
5689000	5694000	So this was the first computer that had a 16-bit processor in it.
5696000	5712000	It basically was like this weird built-in cartridge slot in it and a chiclet keyboard that was more of a calculator style keyboard.
5712000	5720000	It was pretty neat, but it also had, for the 99-4A, it also had additional graphics mode.
5720000	5725000	You could use lower case characters instead of what were pretty much just small caps.
5725000	5728000	And it had a travel keyboard.
5728000	5732000	It was the most powerful thing that was out at the time.
5734000	5740000	It had the ROM cartridge, which they referred to as solid state software at the time.
5740000	5745000	And you could put in the cartridges for different applications or games.
5745000	5749000	You could do all kinds of stuff on it.
5749000	5759000	Now there was a power regulator board that was housed in front of the cartridge slot.
5759000	5763000	And I remembered this because it got so hot.
5763000	5766000	People were calling it the coffee cup warmer.
5767000	5774000	But I remember we would have to put some padding around that because it was so hot and such.
5777000	5782000	One of the other neat things about this too is that you could get peripherals for 5.25 floppy drives.
5782000	5788000	You could get an RS-232 card that had two serial ports and a parallel port.
5788000	5792000	Basically it had all kinds of extra add-ons.
5792000	5799000	There was a thermal printer, an acoustic coupler, a tape drive that used audio cassettes as media.
5799000	5803000	Oh, don't get me started on the one in the Coleco add-on.
5803000	5806000	I still cry over how many erased tapes I had that day.
5806000	5812000	I erased mine too because I got this programming book for the TI basic and it came with a tape.
5812000	5818000	My family didn't understand how that worked and so we recorded over it.
5819000	5832000	The other thing about it too is that you could get it on its own or with a modified 13 inch TV.
5832000	5840000	It actually couldn't get its RF modulator approved by the FCC.
5840000	5847000	But it eventually did chip with the modulator.
5847000	5852000	It also was great for speech synthesis. It had a plugin speech synthesizer module.
5852000	5857000	All kinds of neat stuff that it could do.
5857000	5863000	Seriously, if you look at it with all of its peripherals side to side hooked up to each other.
5863000	5867000	Oh my goodness, it was pretty crazy and it took up a lot of dust.
5867000	5869000	Is that Wolfenstein in TI?
5869000	5875000	This is one of those demo scene things.
5875000	5877000	So this isn't an actual game.
5877000	5879000	I just want something that had music.
5879000	5883000	Yeah, it shows that this is what the system is capable of rendering.
5883000	5885000	It's pretty awesome.
5885000	5890000	The way that you hooked up the peripherals to it were by a daisy chain fashion.
5890000	5897000	It would basically have a sidecar expansion unit that would just go on and on and on.
5897000	5901000	But it took up a lot of room.
5901000	5910000	Not to go into too much else with this system is that you also had a joystick port for it.
5910000	5914000	You could use a wired remote controller.
5914000	5916000	That's what the joysticks were called.
5916000	5923000	You could also use Atari 2600 joysticks with a converter.
5923000	5925000	I remember that in particular.
5926000	5929000	It had composite video and audio out.
5929000	5932000	It worked for NTFC.
5932000	5939000	The PAL based ones had to go through some UHF channel if I remember right.
5939000	5942000	But anyway, going back to the 80's.
5942000	5947000	This was the first 16-bit home machine that could play video games.
5947000	5950000	So technically this is our first 16-bit video game console.
5951000	5955000	As far as the hardware support, it was all plug and play.
5955000	5960000	Pretty novel for its time given what systems were like then.
5962000	5971000	It had something called a hexbus that could be considered almost a prototype for today's USB.
5971000	5977000	The theory worked the same way that these are all powered ports for data transfer.
5978000	5985000	Some of the other things you could get were a four-color printer, a 300 baud modem.
5985000	5990000	At the time though, pretty crazy.
5990000	5994000	We had a 300 baud modem for our Commodore 64 and it was the shit.
5994000	5996000	Now it's just shit.
5998000	6001000	You could also get these different cartridges that were the ROM cartridges.
6001000	6003000	This is where a lot of the game came through.
6003000	6008000	You get a memory plug in that gave you 4kb of ram.
6008000	6016000	You could also get a super cart that would go to 32k which is pretty good for what it was.
6016000	6020000	It also included the assembler grom.
6020000	6027000	Then you had various games that would come out with it.
6028000	6033000	For the games that came out, there was Space Invaders.
6033000	6044000	You had Parsec, well it was TI Invaders, Munchman, Alpiner, Tombstone City 21st Century, Hunt the Wumpus, and Car Wars.
6044000	6050000	A lot of the games were developed by John Phillips.
6051000	6058000	You could put them in cheat mode by holding shift and then pressing 838.
6058000	6060000	A lot of that was in there.
6060000	6068000	There were their own versions of some of the more popular games.
6068000	6075000	It was open architecture and super easy to develop for but it didn't make that huge of an impact.
6076000	6083000	Some of the other major games, I know that Tunnels of Doom was a big one on there.
6083000	6088000	It was kind of like a D&D style game. It was pretty neat.
6090000	6102000	Today though, because of the capability it has with that 16-bit processor, there are modern developments going on.
6102000	6107000	People have done a build of Super Mario Brothers that will run on it.
6107000	6112000	It takes a while for that thing to load it, but it's all on that cartridge.
6116000	6131000	Basically, what really drove this machine into failure was the advent of the Apple II and the Commodore systems.
6131000	6138000	When this machine first came out in 1979, the Apple II pretty much kicked it to the dirt.
6138000	6145000	At the time, its price point for the Apple II was about $200 less than what this machine costs.
6145000	6150000	By the time it came out in the 80s, we had Commodore running things pretty much.
6151000	6163000	Basically, the head of Commodore was almost immediately responsible for the demise of the system because of the output of the Commodore VIC-20.
6164000	6172000	There you go. A silver and black definite machine of its time.
6172000	6179000	There actually is another big thing that killed it. Lack of third-party support.
6180000	6189000	Nintendo. Pay attention. Lack of third-party development can definitely kill something no matter how great it is.
6189000	6193000	It was a great system, and it still has a major cult following.
6194000	6209000	It was succeeded by the TI-99-2, the TI-99-8. There was the Geneve 9640 that was a clone of the system that was built as a card to fit into the TI peripheral expansion system.
6211000	6217000	There was a second-generation CPU. There was the Tommy Tutor. Basically, things like that.
6217000	6221000	But this right here? Our first 16-bit system.
6222000	6223000	Nice. There it is.
6223000	6224000	So there you go. TI-99-4A.
6224000	6232000	Your classic system of the month, the TI-99-4A. Not to be confused with the graphing calculators the Texas systems became known for later on.
6232000	6234000	Hey, I used to play pole position on those.
6234000	6242000	Yeah. I remember those graphing calculators were pretty sweet. But that is interesting how that kind of became like in the 80s when this faded.
6242000	6247000	That's kind of what in the 90s Texas instruments really became known for were those fucking souped-up calculators.
6247000	6248000	Right? Yeah.
6248000	6258000	Yeah. No, those were the shit. There's still… I mean, and we used to see… God, what was it? Tandy, which Tandy gave us Radio Shack.
6258000	6259000	Yeah.
6259000	6266000	Tandy had their own kind of version of the same thing. But I don't remember it taking off very well at all.
6266000	6274000	But this, I mean, when I was a kid, this was fantastic. I was like, ooh. So…
6274000	6279000	And Bobby Blackwolf points out the Texas instrument still does the souped-up calculators, even though we have smartphones now.
6279000	6280000	True that.
6280000	6285000	Yeah. I've seen their name. Now it's all color graphing calculators. Super fancy now.
6285000	6301000	I will tell you this. When I was taking my algebra classes… I hate algebra. But anyway, when I was taking my classes, the teacher still insists on having a graphics calculator and not using your phone for it, even though the phone will do all the same functionality.
6301000	6306000	Because you do have a graphing calculator built in on the standard app, a scientific calculator, sorry.
6306000	6307000	Yeah.
6307000	6310000	Built in with the standard calculator app if you turn your phone sideways.
6310000	6311000	Right.
6311000	6316000	But they don't want to have any risk of cheating. So…
6316000	6321000	Right. Like the graphing calculators weren't able to cheat with those.
6321000	6335000	Now, we had these kind of longer scientific calculators that we were using in chemistry. It was more like a data storage. But we were allowed to have that in chemistry, but we would just draw all of our formulas on them. So…
6335000	6339000	Interesting. All right. Well, we'll have to talk about the calculators another time.
6339000	6342000	For now, that is the classic system of the month.
6344000	6350000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, target.
6350000	6363000	We've got plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come. We're going to take a quick break. We will be back to do some rapid fire news, what's in stores this week, and of course, your calls at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype when we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
6370000	6381000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio. Live tonight with episode number 686 of our show, already in progress for this, May the 14th of 2017.
6381000	6390000	I know those that are on the podcast feed don't get to hear our live music breaks because, you know, we can't just go around distributing other people's music as part of our show.
6390000	6401000	But we did do a live tribute tonight to Robert Miles, who passed away this week, obviously, a legendary trans music producer. I'm sure everybody knew that song, Children, back when that song first came out.
6401000	6416000	That song was all over my college years. I don't know about you, Dark Sakura. That song was everywhere. And then, of course, the one we played during the break was my one I'm partial to, a song called Fable, which I think many people knew that song from the fact that it was in the trailer to the movie Ever After.
6417000	6421000	Did you ever see that movie, Dark Sakura, the one with Drew Barrymore and Angelica Houston?
6421000	6422000	No, I didn't.
6422000	6431000	No, you didn't? Oh, my gosh. It was a pretty good movie. It's worth your time. Just because Angelica Houston is awesome. I mean, is there anything that she's bad in? I don't think there is. Anyway.
6431000	6444000	All right, enough about movies. Let's get back into video games. Let's get to some rapid fire news. Again, you guys can, of course, join us over at live.vognetwork.com if you have anything to say as the show is going on. So, Loki, why don't you start us off with some rapid fire news?
6444000	6463000	Well, as you may remember, we talked a couple of weeks ago about how there was some hidden teases inside Bayonets PC release alluding to possibly Vanquish being the next game to be released. And, well, yes, it is. So, Vanquish has finally been announced coming to PC on May 25th.
6464000	6476000	And also with that, of course, they're going to have 4K resolution support, tons of graphic options, full keyboard and mouse support, and unlocked frame rates, which I believe is all good news for people.
6478000	6484000	So, yeah, a lot of people are very excited by that and definitely worth checking it out when it comes out in about a week.
6485000	6498000	And then finally, Bob Ross. That's not a character or a person you would normally associate with, you know, different games like Smite or, you know, Dota or something like that.
6498000	6511000	But, hey, Smite is getting a skin based off Bob Ross for Sylvanus. And I guess there's going to be a loading frame and jump stamp based off of Ross's face.
6513000	6523000	Actually, that is already out for PC players. It's coming out on May 16th for console players, and you can purchase it for $999 or $700 in-game gems.
6523000	6535000	I'm loving this resurgence of Bob Ross. It's kind of like, I guess, a meme in these past couple years. I mean, obviously, the Twitch thing was huge in that department, but just, you know, Bob Ross was just a freaking genuine person.
6536000	6546000	So, I mean, putting him in the game Smite seems a little much, but, you know, Bob Ross was awesome and more people need to know about his show.
6546000	6557000	So, very cool. Alright, moving on to some other gaming news. Another E3 kind of preview, if you will, about the new Need for Speed game.
6558000	6565000	They did share a few details on their official website, that would be Ghost Games, about what to expect in the next Need for Speed franchise.
6566000	6571000	It will be out by the end of 2017. I'm sure that's no surprise there. That's something they're looking at doing probably for the holiday.
6571000	6580000	And they do say that customization will be as strong a role as ever. Of course, cop chases and street races. What else do you expect in a Need for Speed game?
6581000	6594000	Plenty of space in which to do the things you want. Also, I want to say they said something about, oh yes, you can do the single player experience completely offline, so now you can actually pause the game as well. Won't that be nice?
6595000	6602000	So yeah, apparently the last Need for Speed game had some issues there, but you can play the single player experience completely offline if you want and then you can pause since you're offline.
6603000	6612000	So that's pretty awesome. So there'll be more details on the game, of course, leading up to EA Play in June. That is an offside event from E3.
6613000	6621000	That is, of course, where we're expected to see more on FIFA 18, Star Wars Battlefront 2, and so on. We'll get more information on all that Saturday, June 10th at noon.
6621000	6627000	When the EA Play 2017 livestream is happening, that's all during the EA kickoff weekend.
6628000	6641000	On another note, Twitch has marked a day on their calendar to support more diversity and inclusivicity on the platform. Inclusiveness. Why can't I say that, but I can't say inclusivicity?
6641000	6643000	Anyway, May 26th, what?
6644000	6645000	Inclusivity.
6646000	6647000	Yeah, see? It ain't easy.
6648000	6649000	Inclusivity.
6650000	6667000	Inclusiveness. Anyway, on May 26th is the day. That's a Friday, and so Twitch is going to be celebrating what's called hashtag Twitch Unity, and they're going to be highlighting channels on the page that exemplify a positive culture that day, encouraging streamers to generate relevant discussions.
6667000	6677000	There's also going to be an emoji for the event, and I think they are doing a t-shirt as well where the proceeds all go to Amnesty International and their fight for human rights around the globe.
6678000	6693000	So yeah, that's pretty cool. You know, Twitch has had its problems in the past, and when you look around at the streamers, you see a lot of white dudes. Although, I'm seeing more women get involved, which is great.
6693000	6697000	Really, there's no barrier to entry for that stuff.
6698000	6705000	It is getting more and more accessible, so that's, you know, I think we just need to encourage more people to get in there and actually stream and have more voices heard.
6706000	6718000	And I've always been about that for podcasting, for sure, is that, you know, I don't see other podcasts as competition. I see that as a great thing, is that more voices are out there and more people are being heard. I would encourage everybody to podcast if you wanted to.
6718000	6733000	Anyway, so I guess Twitch is trying to improve some things because they did have a diversify Twitch panel, and the chat room turned into a toilet bowl, as you can probably expect happens on Internet chat rooms sometimes.
6734000	6742000	So Twitch is, you know, as a company trying to do things to really distance itself from that, and I'm sure, you know, there's a lot of learning to go all around.
6742000	6750000	But hopefully, many folks will see this as an opportunity to participate, and, you know, this is maybe a day to catch Twitch's ear on a lot of that stuff.
6751000	6769000	So I don't know yet if I will be participating or not. Here's the thing. The 26th is the Friday of Memorial Day weekend, so it's also kind of a weird weekend to do, but I'm gonna try and participate there on the Twitch Unity campaign that's on May 26th.
6769000	6772000	So, anyway, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
6773000	6789000	I have some stuff. Basically, how about a big sale for our Xbox folks? There's gonna be a backwards compatibility sale that will put more than 275 games on discount, some of them up to 75% off.
6789000	6811000	This starts on May 16th, which will be Tuesday here in the US. In other news, Taiko no Tatsujin is gonna be on the Nintendo Switch by March of next year. Yeah, we got some time on that one, but look forward to it. And maybe you'll get to play it at E3.
6812000	6816000	Sounds like something that's trying to get in by the end of a fiscal year for somebody over there.
6817000	6818000	Right.
6818000	6825000	But the nice thing is, with this Switch being region-free, no longer will we have to worry about, oh, Japan has like 20 different Taiko games and we get...
6826000	6827000	Import that sucker!
6828000	6829000	Yeah, exactly. You can do that now. So, very cool.
6830000	6838000	Alright, let's talk about what's in stores this week. Things you can get your hands on a little sooner than a new Taiko no Tatsujin game. Starting in the US. Loki?
6839000	6850000	Do you have some interesting stuff this week? So, for PlayStation VR, they're gonna be getting Farpoint, which is a new first-person shooter game. It actually does, they sell a retail version with...
6851000	6860000	I don't know if you remember when they were doing that whole push for the PlayStation Move and 3D and stuff. They kinda sold this gun peripheral thing for the Move.
6861000	6862000	Yeah.
6863000	6872000	And their little navigation controller. Well, since now the nav controller isn't really something that they sell a lot of, and that harness thing for those is not something they sell anymore, I think...
6873000	6880000	They're actually making a new one that's kind of all incorporated in the one piece for this game. So that's gonna be kind of neat and see if they're gonna use that for further shooters.
6880000	6894000	But that's gonna be out this week. Also, Operation Babble, the new Tokyo Legacy on PC and on the Vita. The Surge on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
6894000	6917000	Bokeda, Heartfelt Reunion on PC. Thumper on Nintendo Switch. Fire Emblem Echoes, Shadow of Valentia on 3DS. Skylar and Plux, Adventure on Clover Island on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. And that's it.
6917000	6926000	Alright. Let's travel to Japan and check out some of the releases there. We're finally... Now Golden Week is behind us, so we're getting back into some regular video game releases in Japan.
6927000	6940000	Including on the PlayStation 4 this week, the Japanese version of Prey will hit stores on May 18th. That's a game that I've been meaning to check out here, but it's one of those like, ugh, I don't know if I wanna jump in on the game because they really changed it from what it was.
6941000	6949000	And I really enjoyed it on the Xbox 360, but I'm hearing this time it's more like a lot of people are saying it's Bioshock in space. That doesn't necessarily sound bad.
6950000	6963000	Yeah, maybe. But anyway, so I'm curious about this game. I wanna learn a little more about it and what they really did to it, but in Japan you'll get your chance to finally get your hands on it. We've had it a week or two, but you'll finally get your chance in Japan this week on the 18th.
6963000	6970000	Also, Dark Sakura might be importing this. No, she probably won't, but it's Danganronpa 1 and 2 Reload is in Japan this week on the PlayStation 4.
6971000	6972000	These are the versions we already have.
6973000	6982000	Yeah, so it's something that's available. Yeah, that explains the low price in Japan. Also, Titanfall 2 moves into the best hits category in Japan this week, so you can check that out if you want.
6983000	6991000	Moving over to the Vita. Yes, we still get releases on the Vita in Japan, including Rewrite Harvest Festa comes out this week in Japan. That's kind of the lone release this week.
6991000	7001000	I don't believe we have anything on the Switch this week. No, Switch is still empty until we get to Ultra Street Fighter 2 a little later this month, which is the same story for us here in the US.
7002000	7010000	And on the 3DS, also a little slow right now in Japan, so really it's just about the Vita and the PS4 right now. Let's go to the UK, Dark Sakura.
7010000	7024000	A few things. On the 16th, we have Farpoint, and then that's for PS4. On PS4, Xbox One, and PC, we have The Surge, and on the 17th, we have Bolkita, Heartfelt Reunion for PC.
7025000	7032000	Alright. By the way, going to the chat, following up something you were saying there, Loki, over at live.vognetwork.com, Dungeonbuster says,
7033000	7040000	Loki was close. There was a leak a while ago that proposed a spiritual system shock sequel that eventually became Prey.
7041000	7047000	Well, they're actually doing a remaster for System Shock. If you remember, they had that whole Kickstarter. I think it was Kickstarter that did that.
7048000	7056000	So that's coming still, but yeah, it'd be nice. I mean, hell, we don't know what the Bioshock Infinite team, you know, what those guys are doing anymore.
7057000	7061000	So, I'm curious to see what their next game is.
7062000	7066000	Before we get back into some gaming news, we need to visit our mailbag.
7071000	7077000	Every week, you guys email us. Participate at orangelaungeradio.com is the place to send your emails.
7078000	7085000	DarkSakura will dive into the mailbag head first and pull out some emails that she says, this is worth our time to read.
7086000	7089000	And sometimes she'll read the ones that aren't worth our time to. All tea, all shade. Alright.
7090000	7092000	So, DarkSakura, what do you have for us in the mailbag tonight?
7092000	7102000	Two emails. The first one, good evening yet again. As of Monday, I will finally, I have finally completed my first playthrough of Night in the Woods.
7103000	7106000	I will probably do another run focusing on Gregagaga. Extra Gs.
7107000	7114000	My bad habit with this one is playing for several hours at a time, stopping for several days, as much as a week, then putting in several more hours.
7115000	7120000	Not the best way to handle a story-based game. Also, just got the second volume of the soundtrack.
7120000	7125000	As much music goes into this thing, the game itself makes pretty good use of silence.
7126000	7131000	Speaking of silence, my Bluetooth headphones, an old pair of JBL Synchros broke at the earpiece.
7132000	7138000	I tried the BT-55s but found the controls hard to handle and the BT signal kept cutting out.
7139000	7146000	What headphones wireless or otherwise does or do each of you use? And yes, it would be do each of you use.
7146000	7151000	And can you recommend a good Bluetooth headset under $200? This is Robert M.
7152000	7158000	All my last ones were free. I had some Plantronics ones that were good. I've used Turtle Beach.
7159000	7166000	I even used my husband's Beats. They're alright. I don't like the way the Beats does game sound.
7167000	7173000	I use a Razer Chroma? Although that might be the mouse. I can't remember what they're all called.
7174000	7183000	It's a Razer and the lights on the head can change. When I play Diablo 3, everything goes red.
7184000	7188000	That's a cute little thing they do with Diablo 3. But that's a USB. It's not Bluetooth.
7188000	7196000	I still use USB because... I think I actually mentioned this a week or two ago. I'm not exactly some brand loyalist,
7197000	7201000	but it just so happens that all this stuff I have. I have a Razer mouse, a Razer keyboard, a Razer headset.
7202000	7211000	So the mechanical keyboard I have is Razer and it has a USB port on it. So I plug my USB headset into that port and it works really well.
7212000	7217000	And maybe because it is all the same ecosystem, it kind of plays off each other. So I don't really have a need for a Bluetooth headset.
7218000	7226000	In that regard. The one thing I could say is that it does cause this really awkward wire to be showing on me when I'm streaming games.
7227000	7234000	You probably noticed I have a big old wire dangling from me because that's my headset. But I don't have enough experience with Bluetooth to really recommend you anything.
7235000	7240000	I'd have to look to chat. My car does Bluetooth, but that's not under $200.
7241000	7244000	Loki, what about you? Do you have any experience with headsets? Bluetooth or otherwise? What do you use?
7244000	7250000	The only Bluetooth headset I've ever had was just the Sony stereo ones for the PlayStation 3.
7251000	7257000	And those have broken unfortunately. So I don't really technically have a Bluetooth headset right now.
7258000	7263000	I just use a pair of headphones I got from Sony's actual online store because a long time ago with my old job,
7264000	7269000	they gave us as a promotion like $2,000 worth of money towards the Sony store.
7269000	7274000	And so I bought headsets for our game room at the time. So I own four pairs of them.
7275000	7278000	They're not really headsets. They're more headphones. They're just like normal headphones.
7279000	7286000	And I've worn them so long that all of the rubber that's on the actual headphone pad has worn off and now it's just like this felt.
7287000	7291000	And I'm just like, ah fuck it. I'm not gonna switch this out. Because it works fine for what I use.
7292000	7298000	So I use that with the PlayStation 4 because you can plug in the headphones into the controller, which I love that all consoles should have that.
7299000	7303000	It's fantastic. But yeah, I don't have a Bluetooth headset right now.
7304000	7308000	So I guess I totally lied because Act F reminded me. I do have a Bluetooth headset.
7309000	7315000	Act F says I love the Sony PlayStation 3 or 4 wireless headset. Duh! I do have a PlayStation 4 wireless headset.
7316000	7320000	I wasn't thinking, I don't know why I didn't think of Bluetooth at first. Probably because I'm using it on my PlayStation on my PC and I just,
7321000	7324000	for some reason I wasn't associating Bluetooth. I do use that PlayStation 4 headset.
7324000	7333000	It's great for the audio in the game. It's not great for your voice. I sound very tin can when I do the live streams.
7334000	7340000	Because I was doing a Diablo live stream on my wireless headset and actually people were complaining about how awful I sounded.
7341000	7349000	So yeah, that is a concern. But I mean, it'll get you through your shooter games and the things you have to do with that.
7349000	7359000	And the sound output is fine. I mean if I want to really immerse myself in a game like, I think I use the headsets a lot when doing Edith Finch and some of those games.
7360000	7371000	You know, that was really good. Plus for some games, although it's really really limited, you can actually download audio balancing specs that the developers did.
7371000	7381000	Because I know they have things like that for, you know, like your Call of Duty games. And what's the horror movie thing that was a huge sleeper hit?
7382000	7383000	Until Dawn.
7384000	7387000	Thank you, Until Dawn. There's one of those on there and all that stuff. So yeah, that's the headset.
7388000	7392000	Alright, some ideas for you, hopefully, Robert M. Let's move on, Darsakra.
7393000	7396000	Um, the last email. Um, it's long. Okay.
7397000	7403000	Hello Alar, Rob mentioned the scandalous In the Groove 3 cabinet he found before last week's show.
7404000	7409000	In actuality, this is an ordinary In the Groove 2 cabinet. The fact of the matter is that hackers gonna hack.
7410000	7414000	Beginning around 2006 or so, folks started to get bored of the songs that came on the machine.
7415000	7422000	Some digging on the hard drive revealed it was simply running a slightly modified Linux version of StepMania 3.95.
7423000	7435000	Some experimentation revealed that just as you can add songs, themes, notes, skins, etc. to StepMania on your computer, such things can also be added to an In the Groove 2 cabinet.
7436000	7438000	Heck, I have actually done this myself.
7438000	7445000	Machine owners and savvy players who sought permission from their arcade's owners have modified the software in In the Groove 2 cabinets all over the world.
7446000	7454000	Some of the more popular themes include the Simply Love theme, Usault, which is a high-visibility theme, packing many tournament-friendly features,
7455000	7465000	and actually In the Groove 3 theme, which was leaked onto the internet in a partially finished date, along with the incomplete songs and stepcharts.
7465000	7470000	Fans finished off all the stuff on their own, and even designed the marquee that Rob saw atop the machine.
7471000	7475000	Modifying your own cabinet involves jumping through some hoops and dealing with the installed Linux OS,
7476000	7483000	or you could just wipe it out or replace it with a more modern OS and something called OpenITG, which is the newer open-source version of In the Groove.
7484000	7489000	It supports a wider range of hardware and is quite flexible. Highly recommended if you own a machine.
7490000	7501000	Another note about the cabinets themselves. Some say Andamiro on them. That's because Andamiro actually manufactured the first batch of In the Groove 2 cabinets.
7502000	7506000	Cabinets that don't say Andamiro are manufactured later and are slightly lower quality.
7507000	7514000	And that's everything in a nutshell about modifying In the Groove 2 cabinets. Time to go buy one, except for the fact that they're actually quite hard to find,
7514000	7518000	quite expensive, considered to the cheap, freely available and older DDR machines.
7519000	7526000	In fact, the Andamiro can cost $5,000 or more, even today, oh well. Maybe next life, Aaron YYR.
7527000	7532000	I knew the minute we were having that discussion last week about that, what the hell is this In the Groove 3 machine I'm looking at,
7533000	7540000	I knew YYR would email the show and explain it all. And there it is. I'm just blown away that the marquee was a fan thing.
7540000	7546000	Like that's the thing that threw me. Like the cabinet being modded and all that stuff. I was like, all right, I get that. That's cool.
7547000	7553000	But like the fact that it actually has like a fan marquee and it's not like an official thing. That's the part that like threw me for a loop.
7554000	7563000	But I was, well, I just, I wasn't expecting to see it in an arcade. Like somebody's house. Yes, this was in an actual arcade somewhere. That's why it threw me.
7564000	7566000	Looks like you're getting some serious trouble.
7566000	7572000	Which is why I'm saying, just if there's anybody out there, just let it go. It's not hurting nobody.
7573000	7579000	But there are a lot of arcades. I mean, shoot, even coin op down here is mostly privately owned machines.
7580000	7582000	Yeah. Maybe that's what's happening at the place I was at.
7583000	7589000	So a lot of times, especially if a person is leasing out their cabinets, you know, they could have their own custom artwork on it.
7589000	7598000	We were, when we were working on our MAME, I was making a marquee for it and I've seen custom art on cabinets and arcades before. So it's not entirely unheard of.
7599000	7612000	The other thing that really got me, I don't remember if it was in this email or something someone sent to me on Twitter or something, but somebody sent me like an, a different in the groove three marquee that looked really professionally done, but it was different from even the one I saw.
7613000	7614000	And I was like, okay, that's a trip.
7614000	7621000	There's one that I saw where a guy built a cabinet completely from scratch, like pads, everything in that sucker look legit.
7622000	7628000	So, I mean, there's, and that's on YouTube. I think if you search for like a custom ITG three cabin or something like that.
7629000	7636000	I got to say though, I wonder if that's the case of the in the groove three machine, then I wonder if that's why they had some DDR thing.
7636000	7647000	It was DDR, what 2014 or 2015, one of those mixes in a supernova cabinet, which I'd never seen that before. I always thought that was in its own cabinet. I wonder if somebody didn't just upgrade.
7648000	7649000	No, I think you can do the upgrade kits for those.
7650000	7651000	Can you? I didn't know that. Anyway.
7652000	7656000	And just know if you're buying the cabinet new, it's got all the fancy light bars and stuff, but I think you can still upgrade those.
7656000	7663000	Well, uh, our pal JD has been on the show before. I believe it's coming up. I think it's next weekend and I said, I'm going back.
7664000	7667000	So we're going to go back and check it out and play some more. So, uh, I'll let you know what happened.
7668000	7671000	I know JD is not afraid to play all those like dance games. He's got more stamina than I do.
7672000	7677000	So, uh, we'll get the lowdown on what's going on here locally on the next episode of OLR on the continuing saga.
7678000	7680000	Is that it for emails tonight, Dark Saga?
7681000	7682000	That's it.
7682000	7688000	All right. Thank you YYR for that email. Even if it was long, it definitely pretty well that answers all the questions I had. So there you go.
7689000	7697000	Um, I do want to quickly address Twitter. You know, I've been very bad about acknowledging Twitter on the show as of late, but I do want to mention some tweets that we got this week.
7698000	7708000	Uh, there was a tweet from at morning Wolf with an E on Twitter who said that regarding last week's show fun spot is completely worth a visit, but it is not a day trip.
7708000	7720000	We have great pics from 2001. Need to go back. Yeah. When I'm on the east coast this time, as much as I'd love to go to fun spot, I just, it's a little far off the beaten path, at least for where I'm going out there for me to really justify going.
7721000	7732000	But someday, someday I would really, um, like to see that. So, um, there you go. And then we have, um, yeah, that's it because the other one was from last week. So there you go.
7733000	7744000	That's 200 masks says three hour drive from the beginning. Rob, we can do it. All right. Maybe, maybe we'll see. I still have to plan that trip. I'm still waiting for the official wedding invitation.
7745000	7752000	So I have to save the day, but not the wedding invite. So, uh, still, still a little ways to go though. That's still what, like almost six months out. So, all right.
7752000	7758000	Uh, let's move into some more news and then we'll get to your calls at Orange Laundrio on Skype, but first Loki.
7759000	7771000	All right. Um, so Google has acquired Alkemi Labs and they did, of course, a wonderful VR game that I like playing called Job Simulator.
7771000	7785000	So of course they both announced, um, both Alkemi and Google had posted their own announcements, um, which is interesting because you may remember, um, they also did, uh, the Rick and Morty virtual Rickality too.
7786000	7799000	So I'm wondering with all this stuff, maybe Google's going to start launching their own VR. I mean, they have like their like whole dream stuff, but I wonder if they're going to try to get into like, you know, PC VR as well.
7799000	7802000	The revenge of Google Glass.
7803000	7818000	Google Glass is just before it's time. That's all. Hey, you know what? Eventually I'm, I'm just waiting for, you know, cause VR is kind of taken off. I mean, it's still pretty early, but I'm waiting for when we get into the whole AR taking off as much as VR is right now.
7819000	7825000	So that's what I'm waiting for, which I'm probably, we're not going to wait much longer. Give it a few more years.
7825000	7841000	All right, let's move on and talk about Quake Champions. I want to check this game out actually. And, and I actually could because, uh, apparently this test, this large scale tech test actually started on Friday, May 12th. Oops, I've missed it.
7842000	7851000	But the good news is it's still going until Sunday, May 21st. There is no NDA with this beta. So go ahead and share the footage or opinion online all you want.
7851000	7862000	Uh, so the beta is not just live during the weekend. It is going to be available through the entire duration of the test. Uh, there will be a new four versus four mode called Sacrifice that's available during the test.
7863000	7871000	And if you want to get in on this, you just go to quake.b Bethesda.net. That's the official Quake site. Put in your details and you will get a key that Bethesda says will come immediately.
7872000	7881000	It's going to be an eight gigabyte download. You do have to have the Bethesda launcher to play it because that's what we fucking need is another game company with their own launcher software.
7882000	7892000	Because we've got what? We've got Origin. We've got Uplay. We've got, anyway, the list goes on and on. Every company wants their own launcher, but fine. I guess there ain't anything in this world that's truly free.
7893000	7896000	So if you want to do Quake Champions, you got to get the Bethesda launcher. There you go.
7896000	7904000	Anybody else planning on checking you out? Just me? I want, if it's like as fast paced as the old school Quake games were, I think I'd be really into it.
7905000	7917000	So, I mean, I like Overwatch, but, and Overwatch isn't slow by any means, but I could just imagine like it would basically be like 200 CC mode on Overwatch. Like I'm all for that. So, all right, let's move on. Dark Sakura.
7918000	7921000	Oh yeah. How about Super Nintendo games?
7921000	7939000	There's going to be a Super Nintendo game coming out, Rob. A Super Famicom game, to be honest. Actually, it is a related to a Satellaview game that came out and they're going to be doing this as an anniversary celebration.
7940000	7955000	Basically, the game was called Kaizo Choujin Shibi- I'm going to butcher this- Shibi Binman Zero. It came out in 1997 and this cartridge is being released to commemorate the game's 20th anniversary.
7955000	7973000	And it will be for 6,998 yen, which is roughly 62 bucks and it goes on sale in June. And I remember a little bit of this game. I think I played like a ROM of it, but it's just a little platformer adventure game. It's cute and fun.
7974000	7982000	And if you want to go out and buy a brand new Super Nintendo game, import it. I don't know how I feel about this.
7982000	7991000	I think it's great when people make these new games for old consoles. I don't think it's going to be particularly profitable, but that's not what this is about.
7992000	7998000	Well, it's more of a collector thing anyway. So, it's novel. I don't know. I kind of want it.
7999000	8001000	Will the cartridge be yellow to match my Super Nintendo?
8002000	8003000	No.
8004000	8013000	Because it should be. Actually, in all serieses, those cartridges don't have the same chemical in them, so they don't change color like your Super Nindennos do.
8014000	8019000	Well, this is also a Super Famicom cartridge, so it uses the lighter gray material and different texture.
8020000	8023000	And you have to have the little adapter thingy mabob. Or pull the tabs out or whatever it is.
8024000	8025000	Pull the tabs out.
8027000	8029000	Although, I used to play mine on a Game Genie.
8029000	8034000	Darted Studios has the same series as Shock Man on TurboGrafx-16, I do believe. Cool.
8035000	8039000	Alright, just a few more stories for you guys, and then your calls at Orange Launch Radio on Skype. Loki?
8040000	8043000	Completely unaware that this was even going to be a thing, but apparently it is.
8044000	8059000	China. They have a Chinese company that's making a live action Contra movie. That's right. It's going to be, I guess, based off the original game. Read the synopsis.
8060000	8071000	In 1988, a huge meteorite lands on an uninhabited island in the South China Sea. Chen Quang and Li Xiong investigate but become empty-handed.
8072000	8082000	29 years later, Chen sends commandos Bill and Lance into a combat mission to neutralize the villainous Red Falcon organization, but end up facing a different enemy altogether.
8083000	8088000	Yes, I'm down. I mean, it doesn't really have anything in the little teaser other than their logo. I'm still down with that.
8089000	8090000	Why not? Why not? It's gonna be fucking awesome.
8091000	8098000	You know what? China ate up our Warcraft movie. Why not let the Chinese cinema community do a take on something?
8099000	8107000	I'm down with it. Contra's really cheesy anyways. There's no way you can make it bad. I mean, it really just goes with everything.
8108000	8109000	Just go for broke. Go for broke, yeah.
8109000	8111000	If you're going to make it bad, just make it really bad.
8112000	8113000	I'm totally down to see this whenever it comes out.
8114000	8119000	Dartusuya in chat says, I'm excited for this. It's going to be amazingly ridiculous and I'm okay with it.
8120000	8123000	Stoppy says, I think Contra movie was its own film genre back in the 80s.
8124000	8127000	SSG100Matt says, I'm looking forward to the riff tracks of this.
8128000	8134000	Well, apparently this mystery science theater revival, a lot of people are really loving. I haven't watched it yet.
8134000	8140000	I tried to watch part of it, but the problem is I don't have enough time to sit down and actually watch it without the kids going, it's my turn.
8141000	8144000	Like you just had your turn last like two years. So no.
8145000	8150000	Yeah, shut up and watch what I'm watching. Those shows aren't dirty. Mystery Science Theater was never dirty.
8151000	8157000	I mean, maybe they have the dual level humor, but it's not going to hurt kids. So that's cool.
8158000	8160000	Did you ever get into Mystery Science Theater, Dark Sakura?
8161000	8162000	Yeah, I have the movie on laserdisc.
8162000	8164000	Okay. I thought this was the Eastman.
8165000	8169000	Okay. He came for the East to do battle with the amazing Rondo.
8170000	8171000	You haven't seen the new ones though?
8172000	8173000	No.
8174000	8175000	Oh, I just kind of surprised me. I would have thought you'd been all over that.
8176000	8177000	The movie was great.
8178000	8179000	The movie was great.
8180000	8183000	The one that was so boring that I couldn't watch it all in one sitting was Manos the Hands of Fate.
8184000	8185000	Oh God, I've fallen asleep through that several times.
8186000	8190000	It was the one that they apologized for making them watch because it was that bad.
8192000	8198000	And the one without waffles. I remember my friend Gwen who was playing Final Fantasy 14 with us, remember?
8199000	8200000	Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
8201000	8205000	She came to visit and we were watching the episode where they were singing the waffle song.
8206000	8209000	So we left in the middle of the night to go to Walmart to buy waffles.
8210000	8212000	True story because that's all there is to do in Alabama.
8213000	8215000	I hope they actually tasted like waffles, unlike those waffle Oreos.
8216000	8217000	Fucking Eggos.
8217000	8222000	Anyhow, lastly tonight, you know what they say y'all, hackers gonna hack.
8223000	8227000	This is more of a modders gonna mod type of situation though going on here.
8228000	8229000	And what is going on?
8230000	8233000	They have actually put Sonic into Mario Kart.
8234000	8236000	That's right, Sonic has made his debut in Mario Kart 8.
8237000	8238000	That's all through a mod.
8239000	8240000	Yes, that's how they've done it.
8241000	8242000	They've modded Sonic into Mario Kart 8.
8243000	8244000	There's actually a video out there where you can watch it.
8244000	8246000	I'd play it for you but it's just all Mario Kart noises really.
8247000	8248000	It's just one of the things you have to see to believe.
8249000	8252000	So I'm sure they just probably took one of the other characters and like modified the skin.
8253000	8254000	But it looks really good.
8255000	8258000	And it does make me go, you know, Loki's gonna love this.
8259000	8265000	But you know, if they wanted to do more DLC for Mario Kart 8 now on the Switch,
8266000	8269000	a Sonic based thing would actually be kinda rad.
8269000	8274000	Now yes, I do know Sega has their own Sonic Racing All-Stars Transport with all that stuff.
8275000	8278000	I know they have that and it's actually a fun series. It's a good series.
8279000	8281000	But we also haven't seen a game in that series in a while.
8282000	8284000	It was a Wii U launch title and I think that's the last time we've seen it.
8285000	8293000	So maybe if Sega would let them do, can you imagine a Sonic course and some of the Sega characters?
8294000	8295000	You could have like, oh god, who would show up?
8296000	8297000	Probably Sonic of course.
8297000	8301000	Maybe they'd stretch and do like Ooh La La or something.
8302000	8306000	Maybe they can't do it anymore because if they put Sonic in the game, he has to have all his friends
8307000	8309000	and they really don't have space for like 60 more slots of characters.
8310000	8314000	Ooh, good point. ActDeft in chat says, there is the amiibo costume.
8315000	8318000	That's right, you can unlock a Sonic costume with the amiibo.
8319000	8322000	I forgot about that and I should have remembered because you can do a Mega Man costume too.
8322000	8326000	So that would be kind of fun for DLC if Nintendo wanted to go there.
8327000	8329000	I mean, again, would just blow your childhood mind.
8330000	8334000	The new Sega DLC coming to Nintendo is so weird, but I love it.
8335000	8337000	Is there something else you want to jump in there with, Logie?
8338000	8340000	No, I mean, it's just, I don't know.
8341000	8343000	Yeah, I mean, I guess they could do that.
8344000	8347000	I don't think they're going to do that because it's minimal effort.
8347000	8354000	I don't know, never seen it. I think if they're going to do it, you're going to hear about it at E3.
8355000	8360000	And if you don't hear about it at E3, then they're probably moving on to cranking out other Wii U games,
8361000	8364000	much to Logie's excitement.
8365000	8369000	All right, well, that is it for our scheduled news tonight, but we're going to go ahead and open up the
8370000	8373000	Skype line right now over at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
8373000	8376000	If you want to give us a call and talk about, well, heck, anything we've been talking about tonight,
8377000	8379000	or maybe something different, let's get to it.
8380000	8381000	We've got a call coming in. We'll take it right now.
8382000	8383000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
8384000	8385000	Hi, this is Ragingator.
8386000	8387000	Hey, buddy, what's on your mind tonight, Ragingator?
8388000	8398000	Excuse me. Since there's been news this week about Alienware being delisted everywhere
8398000	8406000	because of music licensing issues, I thought I would pose a rather timely question.
8407000	8420000	Now, all of us have been gamers for a while now, and that being said, we've probably played a ton of games over the years.
8420000	8431000	Has there been any games out there that have soundtracks that we particularly loved?
8432000	8443000	Either we listened to music directly through the game or the game came with the soundtrack that we listened to.
8443000	8451000	I got you. So, like, another game that relies on licensed music that we really love that we don't want to see suffer the same fate, maybe?
8452000	8456000	Yeah, well, not necessarily licensed music, you know, like you may add-ins or whatever.
8457000	8471000	But let's say, for example, I've always loved two soundtracks, the soundtrack to Killer Instinct for the Super Nintendo.
8471000	8472000	Good choice.
8473000	8475000	I played the soundtrack to that like crazy.
8476000	8477000	Killer Cuts.
8478000	8491000	Yeah, and although I never played the actual game itself, one soundtrack that I loved over the years was the soundtrack to Mr. Bones for the Sega Saturn.
8492000	8494000	Ooh, that's a deep cut. All right, all right.
8494000	8505000	Okay, so a game whose soundtrack you might not want to see kind of go down the same path or what you're worried about losing in the future.
8506000	8513000	Well, you know, currently what comes to mind, I just can't help but think of this game like jumps to my mind right away because it's something I've been playing recently.
8514000	8522000	But Forza Horizon 3 has an awesome, like, licensed music that it uses and some really cool songs. I love the Pulse station in there, but there's some other good stuff too.
8522000	8528000	The one station that I don't think would ever shut down within Forza Horizon is the one that plays classical music all the time.
8529000	8537000	But let me tell you, there is something to be said about racing to classical music everywhere, which in fact, since I'm going to be doing a livestream for Forza later on tonight,
8538000	8544000	I will probably do the classic music livestream in the game because it's the one thing that's not going to get my stream muted.
8545000	8546000	Oh, that you think of.
8546000	8554000	Oh, yeah, maybe. Maybe it might. I don't know. Most of those songs are public domain, which is why it's very easy for them to create a radio station around it.
8555000	8558000	Doesn't Grand Theft Auto have a similar thing, like you go around killing people to classic music?
8559000	8562000	I think they had a classic station. I know Saints Row did.
8563000	8569000	Yeah, that's it. Saints Row had something like that. Well, that's another game that the soundtrack is pretty killer on.
8569000	8580000	But of course, then there's also in my mind, I've got to go back to, of course, music-infused games and a lot of what this show is built on.
8581000	8587000	Things like DDR and Beatmania and even more so recently as Rock Band.
8588000	8595000	And we do see that Rock Band has had to put up with some of these issues where they have to delist songs after a certain amount of time because they can't renew the music licensing or what have you.
8595000	8608000	So, you know, music is so important on those games. Anything that comes to mind for you guys? Something that, you know, you wouldn't want to see suffer a similar fate to Alan Wake based on the music licensing?
8609000	8612000	Or some other type of strong, strong soundtrack?
8613000	8616000	I mean, I don't know. I can't think of anything.
8617000	8618000	Not really.
8618000	8626000	Really? Almost anything Nintendo. I think a lot of Nintendo, a lot of Nintendo music really defines a lot of Nintendo games. But see, I mean, like,
8627000	8628000	Those are all in-house for them.
8629000	8630000	Exactly, exactly.
8631000	8632000	And that would be kind of karma, to be honest, but, you know.
8632000	8638000	Exactly. It's like, when I think about those, I think, like, well, that's never going to be a problem because Nintendo developed all that stuff in-house.
8639000	8648000	They own it. They're never going to pull the rug on that stuff. I can't help but only focus on, like, these license type of situations that are a little more vulnerable for those types of things.
8649000	8654000	All right. Well, RageNator, thank you for the question. I appreciate it. Oh, let me go to chat. There's some good answers here in chat.
8654000	8663000	Dartusuya says, Jet Set Radio. That's a very good one as well. Let's see, Fifth Dream does call out that Watch Dogs also uses the classical music station.
8664000	8673000	Act Def calls out Tyco no Tatujin, speaking of music-based video games. So, there you go. Some other answers as well, Spaznator.
8673000	8684000	Well, have a nice weekend and I'll probably speak to you guys either over Steam during the week or talk to you next week then.
8685000	8686000	Sounds good. You take care, all right?
8687000	8688000	Yep.
8689000	8690000	Bye.
8690000	8698000	All right. Let's see if we get any other phone calls over on our Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio.
8699000	8709000	1-877-GAME-OLR if you want to do it the old school way. But Orange Lounge Radio is the place to call on Skype. I think most people are using Skype these days.
8710000	8716000	You can also, of course, download Skype on your smartphone. So, it makes it really, really, really easy to give us a call.
8717000	8723000	Some late-breaking news they're talking about in our chat room right now. Apparently, Powers Booth has passed away.
8724000	8731000	He's recently in Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Although, I must admit, I had to look him up a little bit, but he was in the Sin City sequel as well.
8732000	8737000	He's one of those actors that I totally recognize him, but I don't think he's ever been the star of the movie.
8738000	8743000	But anyway, that is unfortunate. So, rest in peace there.
8743000	8753000	Let's see. Sorry, Raginator, if I said the wrong name, but it is your current Skype handle there, so that's what threw me off there for a minute.
8754000	8761000	Yeah, S.H.I.E.L.D. points out he was that prototypical bad guy and asshole dad in the 90s. Yes, that's true. That's very true.
8762000	8771000	All right. I'll take one more call for calls. Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype. Meanwhile, while we wait for anything to come in, I'll check in with Loki for possible last minute stories.
8771000	8778000	I don't really have anything. The only thing I have, there's a Kickstarter going on right now. They have 21 hours to go called Eagle Island that looks pretty awesome.
8779000	8784000	It's all pixelarty, so go check that out on Kickstarter. They have a demo you can try too, and it looks pretty fantastic.
8785000	8788000	Cool. And they've already hit their goal, but they can always use more money.
8789000	8799000	Of course. Who doesn't want more money? All right. Well, since our Skype line isn't lighting up, I am left to believe that Raginator was the only one that wanted a call, so I'm going to go ahead and close it up.
8799000	8809000	But you can, of course, always email us at a later time. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com. You can also tweet us throughout the week as well. We do always like to read the tweets and hear your feedback.
8810000	8819000	At O-L-R on Twitter. Yes, we actually have a three-letter handle on Twitter, which is kind of shocking, but we got on Twitter really early, so I guess we were able to grab it.
8819000	8825000	At O-L-R. All righty. Well, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
8826000	8832000	We're going to wrap up for tonight. Go around to hear everybody's final thoughts, but of course, as first and always, I do want to thank you guys for listening to the show.
8833000	8838000	If you enjoyed Orange Lounge Radio, please help us spread the word. Tell a friend or five about the show. Heck, tell an enemy.
8839000	8845000	But we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we have to have the voices here in order to be able to air them, so we appreciate that.
8846000	8856000	So, yeah. Nice five-star review on a place like iTunes, Google Play, wherever it is you found this show. Those reviews go a long, long, long way. Let me tell you. Really appreciate it.
8857000	8862000	So, that's it for those plugs. So, let's go around and get everybody's final thought for the night.
8863000	8872000	I'll start. My final thought is my sinuses have been acting really bitchy. Like, I think I've developed allergies in the past year, and it sucks.
8872000	8880000	But soup sounds really good. I want some soup. Yum. All right. Dark Soccer, you got the mic. Your final thought tonight?
8881000	8885000	I accidentally deleted everything in my inbox, but I'm kind of not mad about it.
8886000	8887000	Can you undelete?
8888000	8891000	I could go back in and recover what I want to, but again, I'm kind of not mad about it.
8892000	8893000	You just have to set it free.
8894000	8901000	I've already moved over, like, the biggest stuff that I do and look at, and I'm not going to empty out my trash for a while, so it'll be fine.
8902000	8904000	All right. Fair enough. And last but not least, Loki.
8905000	8909000	Um, I don't know. Maybe I'll have to 3D print something this week.
8910000	8913000	Sounds like a good idea. And bring it to the show. I want to see what it looks like.
8914000	8920000	Yeah, I do need to set it up. I wanted to print you something for the Wii, or Wii U. Something for the Switch.
8921000	8925000	Because they've got, like, they've got stands for it and stuff so that you can still charge it.
8926000	8927000	Oh, like, better stands then?
8927000	8933000	Like, you can still charge it. Like, if you've taken it to go, you can, so the kickstand, you can charge it that way. So they have those.
8934000	8942000	They have, like, alternative, um, I don't know what you'd call them. Like, the thing that you strap the two ends to together to kind of make it one controller.
8943000	8945000	Oh, the, you know, the Joy-Con holder thing.
8946000	8949000	Yeah, whatever that's called. So they have, like, stuff you can make with those.
8950000	8951000	So, I don't know, maybe we can make a custom one of that or something.
8952000	8953000	That'd be fun.
8953000	8960000	Alright, well that's going to do it for another week of Orange Lounge Radio, but we will be back in seven days to talk about whatever comes up in gaming the next week.
8961000	8965000	Be nice to each other. Don't be jerks online. Unless the person really, really, really deserves it.
8966000	8968000	Alright, just kidding. Have fun gaming everybody. We'll see you next time in seven days. Bye.
