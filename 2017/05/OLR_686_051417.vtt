Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:21.000
This week, two veterans of non-Vimani music games team up to create a new story-driven rhythm action adventure game. Heard of Parappa, Guitarman, Vibberman?

00:21.000 --> 00:27.000
Then stay tuned for the information we have along with the rest of the week's gaming news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:38.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio.

00:38.000 --> 00:48.000
Live tonight, May the 14th of 2017 with episode number 686 of our show. My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E

00:48.000 --> 00:53.000
Joining me in studio to talk about, of course, video games, gaming culture, the gaming lifestyle over the next few hours.

00:54.000 --> 01:00.000
DarkSakura or Jamie Summers? I'm hunting. What are you hunting? Kittens. Are you hunting shinies? I'm hunting kittens.

01:00.000 --> 01:07.000
That's what Shane was hunting all day yesterday on our road trip, but I'll talk about that later. I said a cat trap. You said a cat trap? No! What did the kitties do to you?

01:07.000 --> 01:16.000
Okay, we have the poor little, the four babies and their mom in my front yard, hiding in the shrub. Dan accidentally backed over one. No! That's horrible.

01:16.000 --> 01:23.000
He was real tore up about it, so I'm making sure that I'm trapped. Well, he didn't do it on purpose, you know. Yeah, but he was still tore up about it. Of course, of course.

01:23.000 --> 01:31.000
So we're trapping the mama and the three remaining babies. So you're trapping them to take them to a safer place. Got it.

01:31.000 --> 01:43.000
The ASPCA where I live is no kill. Good, good. And we'll get them adopted out. Yay! So, there'll be a happy end to this, but if I come in bleeding from my arms, everyone will know why.

01:44.000 --> 01:49.000
All right. Well, good luck in that adventure, but good on you guys doing the right thing. As crappy as that situation was.

01:49.000 --> 01:58.000
And if any local people want to adopt three adorable kittens, they're mostly weaned and they're cute and I'm going to help socialize them so they'll hate everybody.

01:58.000 --> 02:05.000
Do you have pictures on Twitter or something for people to see? I can put them up. Okay, there you go. I want to wait till I get better pictures of them. All right.

02:05.000 --> 02:13.000
Well, there's Animal Humanist, Dark Sakura, or Jamie Summers. Say hello as well over there to Tech Master Loki.

02:13.000 --> 02:20.000
But remember, if they've lost their mittens, you can't give them pie. That's right. But I can tell their mittens good night.

02:20.000 --> 02:33.000
How are you doing, Loki? Good night, kittens. I'm fine. Yeah? Yeah. Busy week? I guess. How's the adventures in 3D printing going?

02:33.000 --> 02:43.000
I haven't done any this week because I've been really tired. Well, I've still been downloading stuff to 3D print, but I haven't actually gone.

02:43.000 --> 02:50.000
I still have to set up the auto level on the new fan shroud thing now, so I was just like, I just don't want to do that right now.

02:50.000 --> 02:58.000
And last night, I was like, man, I should 3D print something. I'm like, I'm too fucking tired to do this right now.

02:58.000 --> 03:05.000
How long does it take? Is it a really slow process? Yeah, it takes a few hours. It depends on what you're printing.

03:05.000 --> 03:13.000
But you just have to get started and just kind of go from there. But right now, mine is kind of, I still haven't gotten everything leveled and the firmware updated.

03:13.000 --> 03:24.000
So it's just kind of, you kind of keep an eye on it. But after a while, once I know it's printing well, I can just leave it there for however many hours it's going to take.

03:24.000 --> 03:30.000
But you know, a lot of the stuff I printed has been like three hours long, and that's really small things.

03:30.000 --> 03:40.000
Yeah, wow. Okay. Well, good things come to those who wait. But it's one of those things where like the technology in 10 years, the same thing that takes you three hours to print today, will take like 30 seconds.

03:40.000 --> 03:47.000
Like, I don't know if you remember. Okay. Do y'all remember out there? Well, you got to be as old as myself and my co-host to remember this.

03:47.000 --> 03:55.000
Okay, there was a classic old program on the old computers, whether it was the Apple IIe or the Commodore 64, whatever it was you're using. It was called the print shop.

03:55.000 --> 04:05.000
Yeah. And you could make banners. So today is Mother's Day, right? So Happy Mother's Day to all you moms and motherly figures and mothers of children with four legs and all that good stuff.

04:05.000 --> 04:13.000
But in the print shop, let's say you wanted to print it, do a printer or a banner that said Happy Mother's Day. It would be like.

04:13.000 --> 04:20.000
But see, that doesn't work on modern printers because you need those old feed dot matrix printers.

04:20.000 --> 04:27.000
I do miss the banners that you can make the dot matrix printers and like peeling off the little the sides on it.

04:27.000 --> 04:34.000
Yes. Yeah, those are pretty fun. But now it's like if you want to print a banner, you know, you could do. Yeah, you're right. You can't really do it the same way.

04:34.000 --> 04:42.000
You could just string a bunch of laser paper together or, you know, take it to FedEx, Kinko's or one of those types of stores and they do it for you in minutes.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
It doesn't take nearly as long.

04:44.000 --> 04:53.000
I was going to say, though, you probably can't necessarily print faster because the reason it goes as speed as it does is the actual plastic needs to harden so that sticks.

04:53.000 --> 04:57.000
Because if you go too fast, then that makes sense. It makes a big mess.

04:57.000 --> 05:06.000
Gotcha. Let's go to our chat room. Hi, everybody. Over at live dot vog network dot com, because we do tape live every Sunday night after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice Geeks Network,

05:06.000 --> 05:10.000
vog network dot com, six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern ish.

05:10.000 --> 05:17.000
And I noticed that S.H.O. 100 Matt commenting on the Jamie situation about what happened if she came in here bleeding from her arms one day.

05:17.000 --> 05:23.000
S.H.O. 100 Matt says, I would have guessed if Jamie came in bleeding from her arms, it would be because she finally snapped on a bad driver.

05:23.000 --> 05:32.000
I almost did. Girl, no. This truck almost like tagged the snub nose of my roller skate, meaning my Fiat.

05:32.000 --> 05:39.000
Not signaling. What a stupid, stupid fuck. What a stupid fuck.

05:39.000 --> 05:47.000
Apparently the print shop ruffling a lot of nostalgic feathers in chat, a lot of people cheering for the print shop and Dungeon Buster says, I love that thing.

05:47.000 --> 05:54.000
True workhorse. These ink jets are junk. Act up says dot matrix printers, the original dubstep creators.

05:54.000 --> 06:00.000
Yes, I've said in there that the reason why we all have hearing damage is because of dot matrix printers and dial up modem.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
Oh, my God. You'd have to leave the room when print shop is going like seriously.

06:03.000 --> 06:07.000
A banner would take like 30 to 45 minutes to print in the frickin print shop.

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
But it was so cool, though, because they just feed out of this like big pile of paper.

06:11.000 --> 06:16.000
I remember like my first year of college in ninety four.

06:16.000 --> 06:21.000
Yeah. Writing my paper and having to do it in the lab that had the printer.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
Right. The lab that had the printer. It was like that.

06:24.000 --> 06:30.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And having to wait in line and seriously waited an hour just to get like a five page essay printed.

06:30.000 --> 06:37.000
I remember when it was a big I mean, tuning in tonight to old people lounge radio.

06:37.000 --> 06:47.000
But here's the thing. I remember when you would use a word processing software where it didn't look like on the screen what it did on the page.

06:47.000 --> 06:53.000
Like, you know, it was you had just like plain text because we were in graphic environments yet.

06:53.000 --> 06:59.000
Like, you know, the Commodore 64 didn't get that until they got Geos, the graphic environmental operating system,

06:59.000 --> 07:06.000
which was kind of Commodore 64 is late life answer to what Apple ended up moving into at the time with Max.

07:06.000 --> 07:13.000
It was just looks like a Mac was the big originator of a widespread graphical interface.

07:13.000 --> 07:19.000
Right. And that was, you know, and then obviously Microsoft filed, followed suit on the PC and all that stuff with with their own word.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
And then everything finally looked like what it was.

07:21.000 --> 07:28.000
But I remember like the only way you could preview like what's this really going to look like is to print it or like pray.

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
What does it or you have to get out the manual because like what does this font look like?

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
Sacrifice some chickens. Seriously.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
Let's see. OK, I'll read it. I'll read a few more memories here in chat.

07:39.000 --> 07:46.000
S.H.O. 100 Matt says, I remember getting in trouble in the first grade for typing a book report and printing it on my dot matrix printer.

07:46.000 --> 07:53.000
My teacher was pissed and wanted me to hand write it because she thought my parents would do it if it was type written.

07:53.000 --> 07:59.000
Oh, interesting. Is that why I don't know about you S.H.O. 100 Matt, but I have hideous handwriting.

07:59.000 --> 08:03.000
Is that because computers spoiled me in that regard?

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
I do feel like my handwriting did get better with age, but it's still not great.

08:07.000 --> 08:11.000
Like you probably would look at my handwriting and think I was in like junior high school.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
I had a lot better writing handwriting when I was in high school.

08:14.000 --> 08:19.000
And now when I got actually when I got back into drawing again and working because I had that problem with my hand.

08:19.000 --> 08:23.000
Right. My handwriting has gotten better since I've had all those surgeries.

08:23.000 --> 08:29.000
So I've never had artistic ability that my mom had all that, but she didn't pass that down to me.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
I got my dad's chicken scratch handwriting gene.

08:32.000 --> 08:36.000
My five still sometimes look like S's. It's just a quirk.

08:36.000 --> 08:45.000
It was it was a challenge because, you know, I'm a I'm a corporate teacher by day and now everything is really on projectors and all that stuff.

08:45.000 --> 08:52.000
But I still remember when we were using whiteboards regularly and I'm having like right on the whiteboard and I'm like, God, my handwriting is awful.

08:52.000 --> 08:56.000
So I just learned to write in all caps when I wrote on the board,

08:56.000 --> 09:01.000
because like all capital letters are kind of like the easiest thing to like not have be super out here better.

09:01.000 --> 09:05.000
And they can hear it better. That's right. I'm shouting at my class. You will learn this.

09:05.000 --> 09:18.000
Although I will tell you that for most people, it actually is easier to read something written in lowercase because you have more different heights and a good reader will read by the shape of the word.

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
And a bad reader will sound out the letters.

09:22.000 --> 09:28.000
Do you know what weird thing I do with my handwriting that I've been called out on before? My A's.

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
OK, most people write an A like an O but with a tail, right?

09:32.000 --> 09:42.000
I write my A like an upside down E with a tail because on a computer, when you print it in time or in a book in times, that's what it really looks like.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
The letter A looks like that.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
Oh, with the appendage at top.

09:47.000 --> 09:52.000
Yeah, like that's how most of us actually read A's in magazines. So that's kind of like how I learned to write it.

09:52.000 --> 09:58.000
That's how I used to write my A's when I was in high school. And after, I don't know what it is, right after my surgery, that all went to the circle with the tail.

09:58.000 --> 10:03.000
But that's yeah, isn't that weird? Why do they teach us to write? I mean, this is great video game chat, isn't it?

10:03.000 --> 10:08.000
But hey, maybe you're designing a font for your video game and you need to know how to do your A.

10:08.000 --> 10:27.000
Keep in mind, computer fonts are based off of old letterpress type, which usually letterpress type was based off of, you know, we're looking at letters generated in the 1700s, 1600s, back as far as the 1400s when we had the first letterpress.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
Yeah, the first letterpress was Comic Sans.

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
No, it was Papyrus. That's why it's old looking.

10:32.000 --> 10:48.000
Whatever. But I mean, a lot of letters, the alphabet itself has changed so much visually, just evolved that, you know, when you look at these letters, we're technically looking at the way people wrote thousands of years ago or hundreds of years ago, I should say.

10:48.000 --> 10:55.000
You know, so there's your history lesson. That's why ye old shop and old letterpress, the YE was the TH sound.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
Interesting.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
It was actually a different letter set.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
I'm learning tonight on OLR.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Who was the graphic design major here?

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
Alright, don't be all waving it around.

11:04.000 --> 11:09.000
Looking in our chat, Fifth Dream in chat says, Me too Rob, A bros.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
So I guess Fifth Dream also writes the A's like that.

11:12.000 --> 11:16.000
And Brad from Pod Culture says, Orange font radio.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
What is your favorite font, Dark Sakura?

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
My favorite font is Comic Papyrus.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
I just got the finger.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
Actually, have you seen Comic Slab?

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
No, I've not seen Comic Slab.

11:26.000 --> 11:30.000
Okay, a slab font is the thick serifs, like the Old West font.

11:30.000 --> 11:35.000
Someone did Comic Sans with, instead of it being Sans, it was a slab serif.

11:35.000 --> 11:40.000
So it looks like Old Western Comic Sans and it's freaking hilarious.

11:40.000 --> 11:46.000
By the way, my favorite fonts are Helvetica New.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
They did a whole documentary on Helvetica, right?

11:48.000 --> 11:52.000
That is so boring. I'm just kidding.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
It actually is more or less like the social phenomenon behind Helvetica.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
No, documentaries actually are fascinating.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
It actually, though, was a really good documentary.

11:59.000 --> 12:05.000
My other one is Adobe Garamond Pro for a serif font.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
And my other one is Futura.

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, Euro style.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
Which is, of course, the VOG logo is Euro style.

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
Because it's clean and easy and modern looking.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
I only type completely in Impact Bold.

12:19.000 --> 12:24.000
Cinco de Milo in chat is falling asleep, so I think we need to get to video game talk.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
Let's get to our kickoff topic tonight.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
We're going to talk about what's going on in the news.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
I want to start with this because I think this is kind of fascinating

12:31.000 --> 12:35.000
and a sign of the, you know, talking about the olden days versus gaming today.

12:35.000 --> 12:39.000
I'm sure a lot of you guys have heard by now, and if you haven't,

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
this is really your last chance to get in on this.

12:41.000 --> 12:45.000
In fact, when the podcast listeners hear this, this is already going to be a done deal, unfortunately.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
But Alan Wake is being delisted.

12:48.000 --> 12:53.000
Alan Wake is being removed from Steam and other digital storefronts.

12:53.000 --> 12:57.000
That includes the Xbox Live Store after May 15th, so Monday,

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
which I believe like 10 a.m. or so is the time it's going to go down.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
And they are saying this is because of music licensing.

13:03.000 --> 13:07.000
There are songs in Alan Wake, and if you've played Alan Wake,

13:07.000 --> 13:11.000
the songs are very important in the game.

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
You know, obviously to set the mood and everything.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
They use the songs pretty heavily, and they have some pretty big songs.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
Like they have Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
They have the Black Angels, Young Men Dead.

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
And I was tweeting about this earlier, but there was a song I loved when I was in college,

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
and it's a song by the artist Poe.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
She was a singer.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
She was famous for that song, Hey Pretty.

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
But she had a song, and Johnny, Angry Johnny.

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
But she had a song called Haunted that was in Alan Wake.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
Good song.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
Oh my God, it's such an underrated song, right?

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
And I remember buying that CD in like 98 or 99 whenever it came out,

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
back when we still had Tower Records, right?

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
I bought that CD, and I loved it.

13:49.000 --> 13:54.000
And then 11 years later, I'm playing Alan Wake in 2010, right?

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
When it finally came out for Xbox 360.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
Because remember that game had a forever dev cycle.

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
Like they were showing that game off when they announced the 360.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
It finally comes out in 2010.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
And then like, I think it's the end of Chapter 2.

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
I beat Chapter 2, and that song started playing,

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
and I totally did the whole like gasp, like the,

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
like, oh my God, somebody else knows this song.

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
Somebody at Remedy knew this song and put it in the game,

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
and so like I freaked out.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
It honestly made me like Alan Wake almost a little more

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
because like that song was in it.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
I love that song so much.

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
But obviously the songs are very impactful.

14:26.000 --> 14:30.000
So these songs must have some sort of limited license.

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
And I imagine when you're, you know, these are pretty big bands.

14:33.000 --> 14:37.000
Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, Black, I mean, these are big bands.

14:37.000 --> 14:41.000
So to license their music, you know, they probably only had a limited amount of time.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
And especially in these earlier days of the Xbox 360,

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
there were probably still a lot of question marks.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
I think a lot of that got learned through Rock Band

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
and some of the issues they've had, right?

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
Like you still can't export Beatles Rock Band,

14:54.000 --> 14:58.000
but I'm sure the Beatles contract is an ironclad thing.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
So when they got to do the Beatles Rock Band,

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
like I'm very sure that that contract is like,

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
you use it for this and only this and you know,

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
like they're, those songs ain't getting out of the game anytime soon.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
Anyways, if you didn't already know,

15:11.000 --> 15:15.000
Remedy is discounting the game by 90% on Steam.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
So tonight's really your last chance to get it.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
It's down to $3 because that's 90%.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
I'll need to re-download it to make sure I keep it.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
Yeah, I think, now here's the thing.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
I actually think you've had,

15:25.000 --> 15:28.000
you guys have had a lot of opportunity to get Alan Wake already.

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
I remember they were giving it away for free at one point.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
I don't remember if it was through a Humble Bundle, maybe.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
Maybe it was one of those things.

15:34.000 --> 15:38.000
But I have a DRM-free version because I think they gave it away for free at one point.

15:38.000 --> 15:43.000
And I would hope some of y'all that have an Xbox One checked out Quantum Break

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
because that game was pretty awesome also by Remedy.

15:45.000 --> 15:49.000
And when you bought that, you got Alan Wake on backwards compatibility.

15:49.000 --> 15:54.000
So I do feel like people have had ample opportunity to check out this game.

15:54.000 --> 15:59.000
And, you know, Alan Wake is a pretty cool game.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
A lot of people compare it to Silent Hill,

16:01.000 --> 16:04.000
but I would say there's a lot of like that scary game stuff

16:04.000 --> 16:07.000
mixed with a lot of like popular television,

16:07.000 --> 16:11.000
especially one of my all-time favorite shows,

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
which, how timely is this?

16:13.000 --> 16:16.000
One of my all-time favorite shows is Twin Peaks, right?

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
And I'm sure some of you guys have heard,

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
Showtime's bringing it back next week,

16:21.000 --> 16:25.000
which I shouldn't be plugging here because it's going to be on the same time as OLR,

16:25.000 --> 16:29.000
but that's why you have digital Hulu and all that stuff.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
You can watch it on demand and all that stuff.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
But, yeah, I mean like, you know,

16:33.000 --> 16:37.000
I think Alan Wake was a game that got a lot of its influence from Twin Peaks,

16:37.000 --> 16:41.000
which also Twin Peaks maybe didn't use a lot of licensed music,

16:41.000 --> 16:47.000
but that show in the 90s especially was like had a hugely impactful soundtrack.

16:47.000 --> 16:51.000
Like the theme song is like probably one of the greatest theme songs

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
they ever did for television, honestly.

16:53.000 --> 16:59.000
So anyway, so this game is being delisted and it's due to a music licensing issue.

16:59.000 --> 17:04.000
So you're not going to be able to download the game or buy it from the storefronts.

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
But my understanding is that you can re-download it.

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
So if you already have the digital rights to it, you'll be able to re-download it.

17:10.000 --> 17:14.000
And of course, if you have a disc-based copy of the game,

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
they can't come to your house and take that away from you,

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
so you still have the rights to the game.

17:18.000 --> 17:24.000
But this does put an interesting little monkey wrench in the whole digital games thing,

17:24.000 --> 17:28.000
is that some games can expire.

17:28.000 --> 17:32.000
What do you guys kind of think about this whole Alan Wake thing?

17:32.000 --> 17:36.000
Do you think that they should try to renegotiate the music licenses?

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
Because that's another thing they're talking about is that they may go back to the drawing.

17:39.000 --> 17:45.000
I mean, they're not going to just do like when they released Beverly Hills 90210,

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
the television show on DVD,

17:47.000 --> 17:51.000
I think they went back and replaced a lot of the music licenses from that time

17:51.000 --> 17:55.000
with like generic, you know, music that you would hear in an elevator or whatever.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
They're not going to go back and do that with Alan Wake.

17:57.000 --> 18:01.000
They've already said that's a lot harder than you guys think it is to do.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
So either the songs are there or they're not going to be there.

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
Do you think Remedy should go back and try to renegotiate the licenses

18:06.000 --> 18:10.000
or to get this back up on digital storefronts or let it go, be done?

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
This game is seven years old, no one wants it anymore. What do you guys think?

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
I don't think that they would do it for this,

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
but if they're going to release like a remastered version or something like that,

18:18.000 --> 18:22.000
they would renegotiate it and maybe do it at that time.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
Oh, so if they ever did like an Alan Wake, you know, HD,

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
well, it's weird saying Alan Wake HD, but I get what you're saying.

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
Like, you know, there are some games from last gen that have come back

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
on the 60 frames a second and all this stuff.

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
If they were to give Alan Wake that treatment, absolutely,

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
you need to renegotiate that music, which Alan Wake deserves that.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
Well, that's why I think because if they sell it right now,

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
I don't think it's that popular.

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
They're not going to make their money back for whatever deal

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
that they have to strike for this.

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
That's why they would need to resell it at, you know,

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
like a full retail value in order to make their money back.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
Jamie?

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Pretty much the same thing.

18:55.000 --> 18:59.000
I don't think there's any logical reason to do it right now,

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
unless there were plans for rerelease.

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
So, Tiger Claw and Chat says,

19:04.000 --> 19:07.000
if they bring back the game after they renegotiated an agreement,

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
should they leave the current prices they sold for the game

19:10.000 --> 19:14.000
or raise it back to what it originally cost before this?

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
Well, that would really depend on how much they're paying for that music,

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
I would think.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
Split the difference.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
Yeah, they're going to pass down that cost to you.

19:21.000 --> 19:25.000
At the same time, they're selling it for $3 a pop right now.

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
And because of all the press this story has been getting over the weekend,

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
I'm sure a lot of people are buying it.

19:30.000 --> 19:36.000
So, I would imagine the musicians are signed on to some type of percentage of proceeds.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
I mean, it has to be, right?

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
Because they wouldn't want to take a loss.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
Licenses are usually paid up front, though.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Oh, so like it was some type of deal.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
So, they've already recouped their cost.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
I see.

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
So, yeah, that's true because I've heard of that for like music games, actually.

19:47.000 --> 19:53.000
Some of those artists in certain large music games that we once talked about on the show

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
got paid $50 for the track.

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
And those tracks are in the game, you know, now.

19:58.000 --> 20:04.000
So, obviously, when you're an indie band, $50 is a big freaking deal.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
But I'm sure for some of these…

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
Well, it's certainly exposure as well.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
I mean, I know you can't work for exposure.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
Right.

20:09.000 --> 20:14.000
But getting paid a significant amount, hopefully significant,

20:14.000 --> 20:19.000
plus having your name put out there in a way that it wouldn't have been otherwise.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
Right.

20:20.000 --> 20:24.000
There is still a little bit of a trade-off, too, is that, you know, there can also be the publicity for,

20:24.000 --> 20:29.000
like, you have to put the information in the game about how to get the song on iTunes or something.

20:29.000 --> 20:33.000
Like, you know, I've seen that done in games before that, like, you know, you'll see, like,

20:33.000 --> 20:38.000
oh, and available at, you know, RCArecords.com or whatever, you know, the deal is.

20:38.000 --> 20:42.000
So, very interesting with all that.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
Let me see.

20:43.000 --> 20:48.000
I'm going into other comments from chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

20:48.000 --> 20:55.000
Cinco de Milo in our chat says, I'm glad they didn't pull a Grand Theft Auto and patch out the music.

20:55.000 --> 20:58.000
I hate it when developers retroactively screw with their games.

20:58.000 --> 21:01.000
You know, I forgot that Grand Theft Auto had done that for some music.

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
It was only, like, a very few amount of tracks.

21:04.000 --> 21:08.000
But, yeah, they did patch in, like, Grand Theft Auto 4, was it?

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
I think they went out and they…

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
San Andreas.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
San Andreas.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
And they patched out some of the music.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
Yeah.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
Yeah.

21:14.000 --> 21:18.000
But, then again, there's also, you know, like, some of the older Grand Theft Auto games,

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
because they aren't, I guess, sold digitally, back when it got really big on PlayStation 2.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
I mean, all those songs are still there.

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
You can't really patch a PS2 game, so…

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
Right.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
Interesting.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
Interesting.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
Let's see.

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
I'll also go into our chat at live.vognetwork.com.

21:33.000 --> 21:37.000
JD in chat says, old Konami originals expire too.

21:37.000 --> 21:43.000
I think Sochichiro Hirata and Akira Yomoka's songs are gone from modern mixes, for instance.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
Actually, no.

21:44.000 --> 21:48.000
Akira Yomoka's songs, I actually know this, because I was getting into this in my gaming

21:48.000 --> 21:51.000
week, but I played DDRA's this week, and I did play Akira Yomoka's songs.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
So, they're still showing up.

21:53.000 --> 21:57.000
But some of the songs have disappeared, and maybe that's some type of agreement.

21:57.000 --> 22:01.000
It could be just also because the library's getting so huge in those mixes that you gotta

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
cut something.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
Yeah.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
Very, very true.

22:04.000 --> 22:08.000
And then Rama's asking, can you explain more what this game is like?

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
What other games are similar to Alan Wake?

22:11.000 --> 22:14.000
Ooh, that's a good question.

22:14.000 --> 22:21.000
I mean, the easiest comparison to make is Silent Hill, but I feel like the tone of the

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
game is very different from Silent Hill.

22:23.000 --> 22:27.000
The way the game plays might have some similarities, although there's more of a mechanic with

22:27.000 --> 22:32.000
the flashlight, and it has been, in all honesty, it's been quite a while since I played it,

22:32.000 --> 22:35.000
so I don't remember all the specifics, but I remember the flashlight played a very important

22:35.000 --> 22:39.000
type of mechanic that doesn't exist in Silent Hill.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
But the tone of the game's very different.

22:41.000 --> 22:48.000
Alan Wake is not as in-your-face gory and creepy in some of those ways.

22:48.000 --> 22:55.000
That's why I compare it to Twin Peaks, because Twin Peaks was creepy through the ambience

22:55.000 --> 23:00.000
and through the unknowingness of this crazy town in the middle of nowhere.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
Does that make sense?

23:01.000 --> 23:04.000
And I think Alan Wake kind of shared a lot of that in tone, where the violence and all

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
that wasn't always in your face.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
I mean, there were definitely some scary moments there.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
Silent Hill wasn't overly violent, though.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
It wasn't, but it had its moments.

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
You know what I mean?

23:12.000 --> 23:16.000
Yeah, so like, and then there would be places you go, like you'd walk into a room and there

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
would be blood everywhere, that type of thing, you know?

23:18.000 --> 23:22.000
What about more like everybody's gone to the rapture for that ambience, the creepy you

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
don't know what's going on?

23:23.000 --> 23:27.000
I like that, except then when you bring in everybody's gone to the rapture, people think

23:27.000 --> 23:31.000
about, oh, a game where you do nothing but walk around and listen to story, and that's

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
not really Alan Wake, either.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
There is, you know, a game going on there.

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
So it's kind of, it's a little bit of everything there.

23:38.000 --> 23:43.000
Rageinator in chat says, think X-Files meets Resident Evil 4, as brought to you by Energizer.

23:43.000 --> 23:47.000
I think that's a tie-in to the flashlight play-in, but yeah.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
Yeah, I guess X-Files is a pretty good comparison, too.

23:49.000 --> 23:53.000
That's another show that was very creepy from ambience.

23:53.000 --> 23:59.000
Anyway, it'll be interesting to see if they do go through the motions of re-licensing

23:59.000 --> 24:06.000
Alan Wake, or maybe someday do an HD, again, I feel silly calling it HD, but a souped-up

24:06.000 --> 24:10.000
remix of Alan Wake or something for a future release.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
Because who knows what Remedy's going to do next?

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
They haven't announced their next project, right?

24:14.000 --> 24:18.000
It doesn't look like Quantum Break may get a sequel, although who knows?

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
I guess anything's possible.

24:19.000 --> 24:22.000
Yeah, I all about forgot about Quantum Break.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
Yeah, it's a good game.

24:24.000 --> 24:30.000
It looked good, it wasn't enough to sell me on an Xbox One.

24:30.000 --> 24:33.000
Alright, let's get to our gaming week.

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
Sorry, I'm laughing because I just saw this.

24:36.000 --> 24:41.000
Cinco de Milo in chat says, Alan Woke as fuck.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
That could be a sequel.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
Stay woke, Alan Woke.

24:45.000 --> 24:49.000
Alright, let's get to our games and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
So, let's go over to Dark Sakura.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
How was your gaming week?

24:53.000 --> 24:56.000
It was okay.

24:56.000 --> 25:00.000
It was wow and Mass Effect Andromeda.

25:00.000 --> 25:04.000
I didn't play for a few days because I just downloaded the new patch.

25:04.000 --> 25:10.000
And, by the way, if anyone does have Origin access right now, the deluxe version is like 40 bucks.

25:10.000 --> 25:14.000
So, just saying.

25:14.000 --> 25:20.000
Well, Miitomo and Pokemon Go, it's the usual kind of.

25:20.000 --> 25:24.000
Oh, no wait, I bought a game but I didn't start playing it yet.

25:24.000 --> 25:30.000
And, I bought Shelter 2 because I heard really good reviews of it.

25:30.000 --> 25:36.000
And, the deluxe version is on sale, well, it was on sale when I got it on the App Store.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
So, I bought it to play on my Mac.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
Nice.

25:41.000 --> 25:44.000
Alright, we'll go over to Loki then.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
How was your gaming week?

25:46.000 --> 25:49.000
This week I did make an attempt to play some different things.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
Not too much, though.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
So, I decided to come.

25:53.000 --> 25:57.000
Randomly, I read something about We Happy Field.

25:57.000 --> 26:01.000
I'm like, oh shit, I backed that on Kickstarter and I never got my key for that.

26:01.000 --> 26:07.000
So, I finally went and I was looking at a bunch of different places to see, oh, maybe it's in my humble library and stuff.

26:07.000 --> 26:13.000
I'm like, holy crap, I have a ton of unclaimed keys in this library right now.

26:13.000 --> 26:16.000
So, that made me think, oh, maybe I should go look at my scene library.

26:16.000 --> 26:19.000
And so, you know, I've got like almost 600 games on there now.

26:19.000 --> 26:27.000
And, I was like, okay, well, hell, I'll try, you know, The Seventh Guest because I fondly remember that.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
Oh yeah, speaking of classics, old school games.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
Yeah, really old.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
So, I tried playing that.

26:33.000 --> 26:36.000
Well, see, The Seventh Guest, when I played it, I played it at a friend's house.

26:36.000 --> 26:39.000
I played, he was like well into the game.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
And, I remembered it being fun.

26:41.000 --> 26:46.000
Apparently, I didn't remember it correctly because that game is boring as fuck.

26:46.000 --> 26:50.000
And, it does not show it age well.

26:50.000 --> 26:53.000
It is, wow.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
I mean, it's running on ScummVM, but, you know.

26:55.000 --> 27:02.000
That is a problem with a lot of the old full motion video CD-ROM games is that they have not aged well.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
And, I think, most of them have not aged well.

27:04.000 --> 27:09.000
And, I think a big problem with that is that, you know, the acting in video games, technology in video games has come so far.

27:09.000 --> 27:13.000
You know, we're giving away awards now for performances in video games.

27:13.000 --> 27:21.000
Whereas before, actors and actresses wouldn't touch these CD-ROM motion games until their careers were already going downhill.

27:21.000 --> 27:25.000
Hence, you know, no offense, but Dana Plato in Night Trap.

27:25.000 --> 27:29.000
What, Tia Carrere had a CD-ROM game years after Wayne's World, right?

27:29.000 --> 27:32.000
Well, I mean, I know a lot of it was all FMV.

27:32.000 --> 27:35.000
I mean, all the transitions between rooms and everything was all FMV.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
But, I'm like thinking, well, this was here.

27:37.000 --> 27:43.000
I'm like, why couldn't they have just, like, even somehow, like, created extra frames for this?

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
Because the animation is super choppy.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.000
And, I get it, it's old.

27:46.000 --> 27:53.000
But, how hard would that have been to just insert some extra frames in there so that it kind of smooths out the animation?

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
Or, maybe speed up some of the stuff?

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
Because, it took forever to get into the game.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
I did, like, a puzzle and it wasn't really that hard.

27:59.000 --> 28:03.000
And then, like, some of the other puzzles, like, I don't know what the fuck you want me to do with this shit.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
I mean, I get it, there's clues in the house.

28:05.000 --> 28:13.000
I don't want to fucking wait through all these transitions to go find a fucking map to some shit somewhere hidden on a rug or something.

28:13.000 --> 28:17.000
But, yeah, it didn't bother you as much in the 90s when that game was originally out.

28:17.000 --> 28:21.000
Because, like, your computer, you never saw graphics like that on a computer, the transitions.

28:21.000 --> 28:24.000
So, you were kind of, like, you were mesmerized by, ooh, this is so realistic.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.000
Right, yeah.

28:25.000 --> 28:28.000
So, I just kind of got bored with that really fast.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
So, I deleted it.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
Oh my god.

28:31.000 --> 28:35.000
Well, whatever, it's a really small game, I just didn't want to play it anymore.

28:35.000 --> 28:44.000
So, then I went ahead and I was going to play Minecraft on PlayStation 4, because my PC version, the Windows 10 one's all broken right now.

28:44.000 --> 28:48.000
So, I was going to play Minecraft, but then it wanted the patch, and I was like, I don't want to wait for this.

28:48.000 --> 28:51.000
So, then I played everything, which is that game I was talking about.

28:51.000 --> 28:54.000
It's really weird. I still don't understand the point of it.

28:54.000 --> 28:57.000
Basically, you play as everything.

28:57.000 --> 29:03.000
So, you start off as a sheep, and the game has really terrible animation on purpose.

29:03.000 --> 29:10.000
So, your sheep kind of rolls, like, you know, four different animation frames, which is kind of silly.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
But, I don't really understand the point yet.

29:12.000 --> 29:16.000
You're supposed to, like, you know, sing to other animals, which is basically just talking.

29:16.000 --> 29:23.000
And then you can actually, literally, at some point in the game, like, play as everything, like, from microorganisms to plants to the universe.

29:23.000 --> 29:28.000
I mean, it's just kind of, I don't know, I don't understand the point yet to it.

29:28.000 --> 29:34.000
It's an artsy game, but I bought it because it had a really shitty animation, and I thought that was entertaining.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
So, I ended up playing Skyrim.

29:36.000 --> 29:42.000
So, I played more through Skyrim, just doing some of the quests in there that I hadn't done before, and just kind of playing through that a little bit.

29:42.000 --> 29:46.000
So, I sunk a couple hours into that, and yeah.

29:46.000 --> 29:54.000
That, and of course, you know, my mobile stuff, and I've been doing Pokémon GO daily, and still playing the idle clicker thing for office space.

29:54.000 --> 29:59.000
Because, actually, each week they do add this, like, new kind of, they kind of mix it up a little bit.

29:59.000 --> 30:04.000
So, they add, like, a bonus challenge thing, so you can play, like, two different games at once.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
And that's been entertaining enough.

30:07.000 --> 30:14.000
So, I do enjoy it. It's a good time kill, but it's not so in-your-face, like, obnoxious as some of the other ones.

30:14.000 --> 30:26.000
Because, actually, you know, the clicking part of it, they have a part where you can tap to earn money, but you honestly earn more money faster through this whole, like, it almost looks like a tiny tower a little bit.

30:26.000 --> 30:32.000
Setting that stuff up, you earn money faster than you do with tapping, so there's really no point to do that.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
I don't know. It's been fun, though.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.000
Alright. Is that it?

30:35.000 --> 30:36.000
That's it.

30:36.000 --> 30:40.000
Alright. My Gaming Week has actually been very active, very busy. Sorry, I have a lot to cover this week.

30:40.000 --> 30:46.000
But, I want to thank, Monday night, we kind of did an impromptu Mario Kart 8 tournament, which I ended up live streaming.

30:46.000 --> 30:52.000
And it was kind of, I mean, it wasn't really, like, an OLR thing, or a, you know, the podcast I tape on Monday nights, reading is fundamental.

30:52.000 --> 31:01.000
I mean, it was kind of a little bit based around that, because it started as, oh, let's have me, Spike, John, maybe Delvin try to all, like, play Mario Kart 8 online at the same time.

31:02.000 --> 31:07.000
And it kind of turned into this big, like, Twitter friend of friend thing, and so people were joining in.

31:07.000 --> 31:10.000
We had a pretty good turnout. One of our races, we had a full 12 people in the race.

31:10.000 --> 31:14.000
So did they have, like, a way to set up tournaments in there, or is it just, like, kind of, hey, let's all play together?

31:14.000 --> 31:19.000
You can set up tournaments, and it was a learning experience, that's for sure, because we had some problems.

31:19.000 --> 31:26.000
Like, some people were not able to join the tournament, for whatever reason, and then, like, suddenly they would break through and be able to join in.

31:26.000 --> 31:36.000
We learned that the clock in Mario Kart 8 makes no freaking sense, it doesn't follow daylight savings time, so you have to set everything an hour earlier than you really want it to be.

31:36.000 --> 31:43.000
Yeah, which does, like, it would be very easy for Nintendo to just display, the current time is, beep, and then, like, that would have fixed all those problems.

31:43.000 --> 31:46.000
That's like shit that's built into all electronics, why can't that...

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
I know. Well, I'm not...

31:48.000 --> 31:54.000
Like, isn't the clock on your system, doesn't that have daylight savings? Why can't it read the system time?

31:54.000 --> 32:04.000
Yeah, I don't know, I mean, you know, in listening to Bobby's show earlier, he does explain that as a programmer, time zones are a lot harder than you think, but I just think this would be an easy...

32:04.000 --> 32:13.000
Well, here's the weird thing, I don't remember this being a problem on the Wii U version, so maybe there's something weird about how it ported over, and the Switch...

32:13.000 --> 32:18.000
I'm not going to overthink it, I'm just going to tell you all, it was an issue, so just be aware of it with the clocks.

32:18.000 --> 32:32.000
But otherwise, we had a lot of fun. It did get to an interesting point where, because there were so many people that were playing in the tournament, you know, we got up to 13, 14 people, it split people into, now we have one room of six people here, and another room of six people over here.

32:32.000 --> 32:47.000
And some people were frustrated with it because, you know, I'm streaming it, but they weren't in the match that was on the stream, and I was like, I set it up this way to try to avoid people feeling like that, and, you know, mixing it up after every race, but it's just kind of, like, inevitable, I guess, that that sometimes happens.

32:47.000 --> 32:53.000
So when it's splitting it up, does that mean that they're doing six in one race, or is it just splitting up the lobbies?

32:53.000 --> 33:02.000
It's splitting up the lobbies because we set it up as a tournament, so it's still the same tournament, but it's like there's one race going on over here and another going on over here. Does that make sense?

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
Can you, like, watch those races as they go on?

33:04.000 --> 33:09.000
No, it's not that, it's not that involved. It's Nintendo.

33:10.000 --> 33:23.000
You, as you join a race, you might find that there's already a race in progress, so you can watch it finish, and then you join that lobby, but that's about as far as it goes with it. I don't, again, maybe it's in there and I just haven't looked for it, but I don't know the spectator thing.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
Is that the same way it works on the Wii U, or is that just, like...

33:25.000 --> 33:28.000
The same way it works on the Wii U. They haven't really changed a lot of that.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.000
God damn stupid.

33:29.000 --> 33:32.000
Eh, it's not as bad as you think, but...

33:32.000 --> 33:38.000
Well, I would think, though, if you're doing, like, a tournament, if you're setting up brackets and stuff, wouldn't you want to see how the other races go? Well, I'll just twiddle our fingers and figure out who...

33:39.000 --> 33:53.000
It's not that kind of tournament. It's a points-based tournament. You're in point, like, if you come in first in the race, of so many people, you get this many points. If you come in last, you get, like, one point. So, that's how it's set up. It's not a knockout tournament type of thing. Like, you're thinking, like, a fighting game tournament.

33:53.000 --> 34:03.000
Well, I'm thinking just, like, a tournament whatsoever. If you have a lobby of, like, if you have a group of 16 people that are playing in a tournament, wouldn't you want to see the other matches going on, or are they supposed to be going at the same time?

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
They're going at the same time.

34:04.000 --> 34:08.000
That's silly. Why? Why would you do that? Why can't you put 16 people in one race?

34:08.000 --> 34:09.000
Ask Nintendo.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
Is it because the game can't handle that many?

34:12.000 --> 34:24.000
Well, yeah, I think it's a hard cap for 12 people in one race. I don't think you can add more than 12. That would be a lot of objects and crap going on on the field.

34:25.000 --> 34:34.000
You know, if you want the game to run at 60 frames a second so much, I cut him some slack there. The original Mario Kart was only 8 people on the track at one time, so...

34:34.000 --> 34:38.000
I mean, yeah, I get it. It's a Nintendo system. I mean, we're not talking, like, Battlefield or something.

34:38.000 --> 34:39.000
I think you're being...

34:39.000 --> 34:42.000
I could run 64 player matches, you know, with full HD.

34:42.000 --> 34:52.000
Okay. Okay. Let's talk about another racing game I played this week. Forza Horizon 3 on the Xbox One, right? Those races? Limited to 12.

34:53.000 --> 34:56.000
So, watch your step there, Loki. It's not just Nintendo.

34:56.000 --> 35:03.000
Yeah, it's limited to 12 because it's a big open world that's got a stream in there versus a tiny little map that they make for the race.

35:03.000 --> 35:07.000
Alright. Anyway, thank you to those that were participating in the tournament. I appreciate it.

35:07.000 --> 35:14.000
But, yeah, I played a little bit of Forza Horizon 3 this week because Bobby was livestreaming it earlier this week doing the Hot Wheels thing.

35:14.000 --> 35:18.000
Our pal Bree with SakaiGDA, she was streaming it and doing the Hot Wheels thing.

35:18.000 --> 35:24.000
And I was like, man, I really need to make more progress on this game. And I think I was in a racing game mode because of Mario Kart 8.

35:24.000 --> 35:32.000
So, I actually fired up Forza Horizon 3 on the PC and was playing that because I wanted to see how it kind of compared to the Xbox One.

35:32.000 --> 35:38.000
And it runs well on my system. I had a good time playing it. So, I'm going to do that as the post-show game tonight.

35:38.000 --> 35:43.000
So, we'll take a look at that on my livestream over at twitch.tv slash Rob Roberts after the show.

35:43.000 --> 35:49.000
So, I was playing some Forza Horizon 3. Also, this is a big accomplishment for me this week in gaming.

35:49.000 --> 35:54.000
Diablo 3, Wednesday night, PlayStation 4, I got my platinum trophy.

35:54.000 --> 35:59.000
So, I got every- and that was something I said on this show I was going to do like three years ago.

35:59.000 --> 36:07.000
So, I finally did it! Wednesday night, I got my trophy and I actually livestreamed that because I figured that was an occasion worth streaming.

36:07.000 --> 36:16.000
But 500 bounties, that's the trophy that took me the longest. It was faster for me to level up all of the classes to 70 than it was to do 500 bounties.

36:16.000 --> 36:20.000
But the trick is, for those of you Diablo players, you probably already know this.

36:20.000 --> 36:28.000
Take your main quote-unquote character and just do enough greater rifts to get your Gem of Ease, the XP gem, up to level 25.

36:28.000 --> 36:36.000
So, you can socket it in any weapon and then it drops the item level requirement of the weapon to level 1 and provides a huge boost.

36:36.000 --> 36:50.000
And so, what you do, you put the gem in your stash, roll a, let's say, Crusader or whatever new character you want to do, and then craft a weapon at the table that's a legendary level 70 weapon, socket the gem into it, and your first 40 levels are done in like five minutes.

36:50.000 --> 36:56.000
You just fly through the beginning levels and then, you know, you don't have to worry about the later ones when the XP boost isn't enough to carry you through.

36:57.000 --> 37:09.000
So, yeah, I did all the Diablo 3 stuff, so that was exciting to get the platinum trophy because I actually, I'm not sure I have any other platinum trophies. I think that was my first one.

37:09.000 --> 37:16.000
I think I've gotten every trophy in other games, but they didn't have platinums. I got like a gold for getting through everything.

37:16.000 --> 37:22.000
I've gotten a few platinums. I know, like in the Lego Marvel games, I've done those, but those are like cake.

37:23.000 --> 37:38.000
I'm trying to get platinum in Skyrim, but that's going to be a pain in the ass because they have, you know, branching achievements for like, was it being a vampire and being like a werewolf and stuff.

37:38.000 --> 37:50.000
I don't want to be a werewolf or a vampire in those, but I'm going to have to do that for a little bit so that I can get all those and then go back to a previous save, which, good luck with that because there's like a million saves I have for Skyrim.

37:50.000 --> 37:57.000
Yeah, yeah, good luck tracking all that. So yeah, so now I don't know what platinum I'll work on next, who knows.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.000
Overwatch?

37:58.000 --> 38:09.000
I don't know about that. I'm not good enough at Overwatch, I don't think to do that. I mean, Overwatch is a lot of fun to play, don't get me wrong, and I did play some of that on Friday night with Alan, but not enough to really get the trophies for that.

38:10.000 --> 38:21.000
So that was some of my console and PC gaming this week. Didn't do any AR gaming as well. There's an event going on in Ingress, I'm like halfway through it, so I'm trying to finish that one out just to be done with it and get my stupid little medal.

38:21.000 --> 38:33.000
Just because those limited time things, if you don't do it during the limited time, you feel like you miss out. Still been trying to do Pokemon Go. I haven't been as active in Pokemon Go just because I kind of feel like that game is in a little bit of a lull.

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
Like I like the events, I like-

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
Yeah, the events kind of help out because-

38:36.000 --> 38:43.000
Yeah, those things have really helped, but I feel like, I just feel like the gym game is garbage in that game right now.

38:43.000 --> 38:44.000
Yeah, I don't even, yeah.

38:45.000 --> 39:06.000
But the big rumor is Niantic is going to do something with it, and we're all kind of waiting to see what is the anti-spoof, anti-cheat, like people have actually data mined these newer versions of Pokemon Go that come out, and there's talk in there about raids, so now you might be raiding gyms with people.

39:06.000 --> 39:20.000
And that could be very interesting, so yeah. I mean, Ingress is more fun when you play with other people, and you can do stronger things. You build stronger portals when you're playing with other people, so it'd make a lot of sense that maybe Pokemon Go wants to do some of that.

39:20.000 --> 39:25.000
Well, they still don't have any sort of team-based stuff yet because we have teams, but it doesn't really do anything.

39:25.000 --> 39:44.000
And to be clear, before I get corrected on it, you can do two people at once attacking a gym, but even that, if you don't start at the exact same time, it's kind of buggy, and there's all these little quirks that go with it, so yes, it's there, but it's kind of- it's like the only way to take out a Blissey, is to do two people.

39:44.000 --> 39:53.000
So anyway, so just waiting to see what continues in Pokemon Go, but otherwise, hell yeah, I still need to collect my Stardust bonus every day because that's the hardest stuff to get if you're not doing gyms.

39:54.000 --> 40:06.000
Anyway, what else have I been playing? So, yesterday, my pal Shane and I took a road trip to Concord. We went to round one and played some of the Japanese arcade games.

40:06.000 --> 40:15.000
And what was really cool about it is that we met our pals, Captain Spike and First Mate Slidekick from GameBui.org. GameBui.org. They were there, another show on the network here.

40:15.000 --> 40:22.000
And of course, my pal, my long-time pal Extrafur from other shows, like Courthouse and stuff, and his partner. So, it was like all six of us met up and played some games.

40:22.000 --> 40:30.000
So, it was a lot of fun. It was like kind of a little reunion of sorts from all these people that have done podcasts together and just people that are my friends.

40:30.000 --> 40:40.000
So, you know, we hung out, played some of the games. I got to play a little bit of DDR Ace, which I don't usually do a lot of DDR at my age, but I had fun.

40:40.000 --> 40:51.000
I was that guy that got up on the machine and I would do one or two of the new songs, but then I was like, I want to go back and go into DDR Fifth Mix and I'm going to play Insertion and all these old-ass songs.

40:51.000 --> 41:01.000
So, I was having fun with that. But here's the game that I played more than any other at round one. The arcade version of Theatrhythm they have.

41:01.000 --> 41:13.000
And it's different because Theatrhythm, of course, is a DS game and so it's mostly based on the touchpads. So, you're doing, you know, you're tapping the screen, you're moving the stylus different directions.

41:13.000 --> 41:23.000
Well, obviously, the arcade doesn't really have the touchscreen. Well, actually, what's weird, it does. You can actually touch the screen to pick your songs and all that stuff, but that's not how you control the game.

41:24.000 --> 41:36.000
You have these buttons and, like, nubs. So, like, imagine, like, extend your hand out, your thumbs would be on a button, the palms of your hands would be on these nubs.

41:36.000 --> 41:47.000
And so, when it's time to do, like, the little tap, tap, tap, you used your thumbs to press the buttons. And when it's time to do, like, the up, down, like those swipes, you push that direction on the nubs.

41:47.000 --> 41:57.000
So, it really kind of changes the game a lot, obviously, but it also feels like something they could do on a PlayStation 4 because you could do this with analog controllers.

41:57.000 --> 42:08.000
So, it's interesting to me that it hasn't been ported over there yet, but anyway. But, yeah, the arcade version was a lot of fun. I actually bought the card that works with Theatrhythm's system because it's also for Groove Coaster and all this stuff.

42:08.000 --> 42:20.000
So, I actually bought the card and I was, like, saving my progress and, yeah, I was having fun. I just, I wish I could have understood, could have understand more of what was in the menus because they are, it's 100% Japanese.

42:20.000 --> 42:32.000
And I, as you guys know, I don't read or speak a lick of it. So, I didn't understand. I mean, I kind of, like, figured some of it out. Like, I was like, oh, there's like a Soul Calibur-esque red versus blue thing going on.

42:32.000 --> 42:42.000
So, at the end of the match, you would choose, like, which crystal on the battlefield do you want to represent and you could, like, either take energy away or add energy to it. So, there's all this kind of funky stuff going on there.

42:42.000 --> 42:52.000
But it's also, it's so interesting and Theatrhythm, I think, really shows, like, how much the arcade games have kind of taken from mobile phones, you know, and you see a lot of this in the Japanese games as well.

42:52.000 --> 43:06.000
Is that, like, oh, you get a daily logon bonus for signing in and, like, when you do have the card, you unlock more characters. You can actually purchase songs with in-game credits that would then show up.

43:06.000 --> 43:14.000
Like, so, I bought the Mugamog song from Final Fantasy XIV and so I could actually play that in a later game. So, just, like, lots of neat little stuff like that.

43:14.000 --> 43:26.000
So, yeah, I spent a lot of time playing Theatrhythm. I played, like, six games in a row. So, which doesn't sound like much, but when you consider, you know, it's three songs a game, it's a good, you know, at least 10 to 15 minutes.

43:26.000 --> 43:30.000
I mean, I spent a good time playing that. So, anyway.

43:30.000 --> 43:39.000
Yeah, it's just 100matt in chat says, don't sell yourself short. You've been reading Japanese for 10 plus years during the release dates. Oh, yeah, and I do such a good job of it, too, huh?

43:39.000 --> 43:50.000
So, anyway. There you go. That's, uh, that was, so I, you know, played some of that and some of the other music games. I played some BeatMania 2DX. God, I already forgot the name of the new one.

43:50.000 --> 43:56.000
Cinnabuzz. That was it. Cinnabuzz. Cinnabon. Cinnabon. That's it. It was 2DX Cinnabon.

43:56.000 --> 43:57.000
I want Cinnabon.

43:58.000 --> 44:12.000
Was the new one. So, I was playing that, but the volume on the machine was way too low, and I tried to do all the tricks. So, the equalizer, it wouldn't work because it's right next to Groove Coaster, and they had Groove Coaster at, like, the highest level it could go.

44:12.000 --> 44:21.000
So, like, I could kind of get through 2DX, but the minute somebody came up and put their card into Groove Coaster to play, I couldn't hear a goddamn thing. All I could hear was that Groove Coaster machine.

44:21.000 --> 44:35.000
So, round one needs to balance some of their noise out a little bit, or I just need to not be stupid and keep forgetting my headphones at home, because I could be plugging my headphones into these games, and then I wouldn't have to worry about any of this stuff, but alas, I forgot.

44:35.000 --> 44:42.000
So, there you go. Yeah, and that's what Rama and Chad says. Headphones? Yeah, yeah, I forgot. All right, leave me alone. Leave me alone.

44:42.000 --> 44:53.000
I guess, you know, it's not like round one isn't in a fucking mall, so I could have just walked out, bought headphones, and brought them back, but then it's like, I have, like, a million pairs of headphones here at home.

44:53.000 --> 45:03.000
Like, Alan would be so mad at me if it's like, oh, because I'm stupid and I forgot, I bought more headphones while I was at the mall. He wouldn't really get mad, but he would roll his eyes. So, there you go.

45:04.000 --> 45:13.000
ActDeft in chat says, Rob Roberts, did Theater of the Arcade have Crazy Chocobo? ActDeft, you're going to be proud of me when I answer that with, I didn't look for it.

45:13.000 --> 45:23.000
I don't think it was there, though. I think there was, like, one song, because that was from Final Fantasy XIII-2, right? I think they had, like, one song from XIII-2 in it, and it wasn't that, so there you go.

45:23.000 --> 45:32.000
Anyway, I have talked plenty about my gaming week. There it was. So, I did a lot this week. I had a pretty diverse week there, so there you go. Yes, DarkSakura?

45:32.000 --> 45:35.000
We need to have a momentous event.

45:35.000 --> 45:36.000
Yes, what's that?

45:36.000 --> 45:37.000
Right now.

45:37.000 --> 45:42.000
What? Oh, you want to do this? Some food tasting here?

45:42.000 --> 45:43.000
It's happening.

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
Okay, so tell our listeners what you found at the store.

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
Waffles and syrup Oreos.

45:47.000 --> 45:53.000
I've been wanting to try these. I have, I have. So, I'm really curious about this.

45:53.000 --> 45:57.000
I saw it. It was so random. So, go ahead and kick us off while I lift the tab.

45:57.000 --> 46:02.000
All right, well, I want to go into housekeeping real quick, because I do have a couple things to get into for housekeeping tonight.

46:02.000 --> 46:10.000
First off, because I forgot to do it on the call, I want to embarrass Bobby Black Wolf for the late Happy Birthday Bobby Black Wolf.

46:10.000 --> 46:16.000
He's years old, but he'll tell you he's 29. So, Happy Birthday Bobby Black Wolf.

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
Put this in your mouth.

46:18.000 --> 46:22.000
Well, if you insist. All right, so waffles and syrup Oreo. Here we go.

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
Yeah, this is great radio.

46:24.000 --> 46:31.000
I know, but you know what? Deal. It's food. If I gave you a cookie, you'd stop what you're doing too.

46:31.000 --> 46:32.000
It's weird.

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
That is weird.

46:34.000 --> 46:35.000
It's not bad.

46:35.000 --> 46:39.000
It doesn't, I don't know if that really tastes like waffles and syrup to me.

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
I taste maple.

46:41.000 --> 46:47.000
It tastes, it tastes like kind of an, it tastes like one of those like super basic shortbread cookies.

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
With maple.

46:49.000 --> 46:50.000
I don't even really taste the maple.

46:50.000 --> 46:51.000
I taste the maple.

46:51.000 --> 46:55.000
These are a little bit of a letdown to me. I don't know. I don't know. All right. Anyway.

46:55.000 --> 47:04.000
All right. Other housekeeping. Remember, we won't be here at the end of June. June 25th is the day we're not going to be here.

47:04.000 --> 47:08.000
But our 15th anniversary show is June 18th.

47:08.000 --> 47:09.000
Yay.

47:09.000 --> 47:17.000
And E3 is coming up. June 11th. We're going to be cut short by Bethesda, but we'll have a big E3 spectacular on June 11th. That'll be fun.

47:17.000 --> 47:20.000
None of us sadly going to E3 this year.

47:21.000 --> 47:29.000
But yeah, we've gone into the reasons extensively on previous episodes and the long and the short of it is E3 just isn't what it used to be.

47:29.000 --> 47:30.000
So we don't really go.

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
Don't catch San Francisco people at Pride.

47:32.000 --> 47:41.000
I'm very curious though to see what happens with the public being open to, because I do know some people that are going.

47:41.000 --> 47:46.000
In fact, Captain Spike from Game Buoy is trying to go.

47:46.000 --> 47:50.000
I think he has the tickets, but he just, you know, he's trying to juggle stuff with work.

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
So I'll be very curious to hear his thoughts on it.

47:52.000 --> 47:55.000
I'm not sure if the gals from Ninja's Electric Sisterhood.

47:55.000 --> 47:59.000
I don't know if Ninja's Sister and Pandalicious are going.

47:59.000 --> 48:05.000
They go almost every year, but there was just a wedding that happens.

48:05.000 --> 48:09.000
I'm not sure if they are actually going, but we'll see.

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
So I'll hopefully be taught.

48:11.000 --> 48:14.000
Oh, Bobby Blackwell says they got rejected. What?

48:14.000 --> 48:21.000
This is all part of that stupid, the way we're opening this up to the public is by rejecting all of the independent media,

48:21.000 --> 48:26.000
which is part of the reason why I think this whole thing is ridiculous.

48:26.000 --> 48:31.000
But anyway, so Bobby Blackwell says Ninja's sister will be in LA and going to parties.

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
And Rama says Panda just got married.

48:33.000 --> 48:34.000
Yeah, I know that.

48:34.000 --> 48:37.000
But yeah, so Ninja's sister is going to LA and just going to parties.

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
Well, that's one way to do E3, I'll tell you that.

48:40.000 --> 48:49.000
All right. And so what, on the 25th when we're not here, the show's being canceled because I'm taking a trip to Chicago.

48:49.000 --> 48:52.000
I'm actually going to Chicago Pride for the very first time is happening.

48:52.000 --> 48:57.000
But Dark Soccer, you just shouted there. You're going to San Francisco Pride the same day, right?

48:57.000 --> 48:58.000
I am.

48:58.000 --> 49:01.000
All right, so that's awesome that we're covering different stuff. Cool.

49:01.000 --> 49:06.000
All right, let's get into some gaming news and what's going on in video games.

49:06.000 --> 49:07.000
This is still so fucking weird.

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
Yeah, I don't know if I like these as much as like the Red Velvet ones.

49:09.000 --> 49:10.000
Well, you're keeping the bag.

49:12.000 --> 49:17.000
Great. I'm trying to lose weight because I have a Pride event coming up, but oh well.

49:17.000 --> 49:18.000
Anyway.

49:18.000 --> 49:19.000
Start tomorrow.

49:19.000 --> 49:22.000
Let's get into video game news. Loki.

49:22.000 --> 49:27.000
So Square Enix has announced that they have decided to withdraw from business.

49:27.000 --> 49:30.000
Well, their English in this press release is not very good,

49:30.000 --> 49:36.000
but decided to withdraw from the business of IO Interactive or doing business with IO Interactive.

49:36.000 --> 49:40.000
So right now they're starting discussions with potential new investors

49:40.000 --> 49:45.000
and are currently in negotiations to secure investment,

49:45.000 --> 49:48.000
meaning that they're looking to sell the company.

49:48.000 --> 49:53.000
Of course, IO Interactive did a lot of different things, including, you know,

49:53.000 --> 49:57.000
Cane of Lynch, the Hitman series, and, you know, other games.

49:57.000 --> 50:01.000
So interesting to see what happens with that.

50:01.000 --> 50:05.000
So I'm assuming the transition to the episodic Hitman didn't work out so well.

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
I didn't think it was doing so bad.

50:08.000 --> 50:13.000
In fact, I've heard a lot of positive stuff around the Hitman, so the episodic stuff.

50:13.000 --> 50:18.000
Those are not usually games that I get into, so I myself have not really explored these games.

50:18.000 --> 50:21.000
I don't know about you guys in chat over at live.vognetwork.com

50:21.000 --> 50:24.000
if you guys have thoughts on the Hitman transition to episodic.

50:24.000 --> 50:29.000
I'll kind of rely on you guys to tell me if it's been a good thing or a bad thing or what,

50:29.000 --> 50:34.000
but my assumption is that risk didn't pay off or Square wouldn't be looking to unload them right now.

50:35.000 --> 50:38.000
But are there expectations for the franchise too high?

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
I remember with Tomb Raider, they were like,

50:40.000 --> 50:43.000
Oh, we only made, was it $300 million or something?

50:43.000 --> 50:44.000
I'm like, that's terrible.

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
Yeah, we only sold so many copies, and it was like,

50:46.000 --> 50:49.000
that actually sounds like a lot of copies that you sold, sir.

50:49.000 --> 50:52.000
And well, but to be fair, Tomb Raider did get a sequel,

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
and the sequel was extremely well received.

50:54.000 --> 50:57.000
And haven't there been rumors and rumblings that a third one,

50:57.000 --> 51:01.000
I mean, it seems kind of obvious that they have this whole engine built.

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
The games are doing well enough.

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
Probably going to be another one, and they're doing a movie, aren't they?

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
Yes, there is a movie for sure, yeah,

51:07.000 --> 51:10.000
because there were some photos that leaked from the set and so forth.

51:10.000 --> 51:13.000
So, I mean, it's very possible a third game is going to show up at this E3.

51:13.000 --> 51:18.000
In fact, I thought I heard that Rise of the Tomb Raider did well on PlayStation 4.

51:18.000 --> 51:22.000
They actually called that out as part of Square Enix's financials.

51:22.000 --> 51:26.000
Well, maybe we can stop this nonsense of console exclusives for a year.

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
Oh, yeah, I would bet if there's a third Tomb Raider game,

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
that console exclusive stuff ain't happening.

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
It's going to be out everywhere at once.

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
But I would imagine if they're doing a third game,

51:34.000 --> 51:39.000
it's probably cheaper for them to just use the same engine they developed

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
and spent all their resources on in the first game,

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
which I assume is what they're using in the second game,

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
and then continue on into the third game, right?

51:45.000 --> 51:49.000
So they're kind of getting the most bang for their buck from that engine?

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
I mean, if it works for what they need,

51:51.000 --> 51:57.000
I mean, if it's able to handle whatever they need to render, I mean, sure, why not?

51:57.000 --> 52:00.000
Okay, so some folks in chat have played Hitman.

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
Tigercaw, it doesn't sound like he's played it,

52:02.000 --> 52:05.000
but saying that new Hitman game was such a huge success

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
that its future is in doubt. I wonder why.

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
So yeah, kind of weird.

52:09.000 --> 52:10.000
But MXC in chat says,

52:10.000 --> 52:13.000
I was super nervous about the episodicness,

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
but the new Hitman is fantastic.

52:15.000 --> 52:18.000
Each stage is so big and full of things to potentially do,

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
and by parceling them out as episodes,

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
you really got the time to learn each level.

52:22.000 --> 52:25.000
So it doesn't sound like this episode.

52:25.000 --> 52:26.000
It didn't look bad.

52:26.000 --> 52:27.000
Yeah, it did.

52:27.000 --> 52:28.000
Just not my type of game,

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
I like watching videos of people playing it.

52:30.000 --> 52:31.000
Yeah.

52:31.000 --> 52:34.000
So, well, a bummer to IO Interactive,

52:34.000 --> 52:39.000
but at least, I mean, for what silver lining we can find,

52:39.000 --> 52:42.000
at least Square Enix didn't just close the studio and lay everybody off.

52:42.000 --> 52:43.000
We're not talking about job launch yet, right?

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
They can be picked up by somebody else

52:45.000 --> 52:49.000
and continue on with whatever new franchise they want to develop.

52:49.000 --> 52:52.000
But would they get to keep the Hitman IP,

52:52.000 --> 52:53.000
or would that stay with Square Enix?

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
I would imagine that would stay with Square Enix.

52:55.000 --> 52:56.000
Interesting.

52:56.000 --> 52:57.000
Well, I don't know.

52:57.000 --> 53:00.000
It depends on what they're negotiating to sell.

53:00.000 --> 53:03.000
If they're selling the studio and IP, then maybe.

53:03.000 --> 53:07.000
I wonder if they would give Hitman to another studio like Crystal Dynamics

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
or maybe even in Japan somewhere or something,

53:09.000 --> 53:13.000
or if they would just put the series on ice for a little while.

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
Who knows?

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
There wasn't enough Cup Noodle in Hitman.

53:17.000 --> 53:20.000
Oh, stop it.

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
All right, let's move on to another big series.

53:22.000 --> 53:25.000
Of course, as we are creeping more and more closer to E3,

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
there's a lot of rumors and things that are coming out,

53:27.000 --> 53:30.000
but this one's got even some screenshots to prove it,

53:30.000 --> 53:33.000
and that is the future for Assassin's Creed.

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
Now, here's the interesting thing about Assassin's Creed.

53:35.000 --> 53:38.000
It's kind of got two working titles right now.

53:38.000 --> 53:42.000
I guess the original working title of the game was Assassin's Creed Origins,

53:42.000 --> 53:45.000
but now they're saying the Assassin's Creed game,

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
the title is Assassin's Creed Empire.

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
Sounds like it's going to be the new Assassin's Creed game.

53:49.000 --> 53:54.000
It can't be Origins because I think they've been using that as a subtitle for other things.

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
Yeah, so that was the working title.

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
So it sounds like the actual title may be Empire.

53:58.000 --> 54:01.000
Now, keep in mind, Assassin's Creed has been on ice.

54:01.000 --> 54:04.000
It didn't get a game last year because of the whole fiasco that happened

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
with the last game that they did,

54:06.000 --> 54:09.000
so they've had a little more time to work on this game.

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
And apparently a screenshot leaked out.

54:11.000 --> 54:15.000
There was a Reddit user that actually leaked this picture,

54:15.000 --> 54:18.000
and it sounds like it could have been internal.

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
They're thinking there's some stuff in the name.

54:20.000 --> 54:26.000
Well, it says shout out to Ashraf and possibly saying,

54:26.000 --> 54:29.000
you know, it's name checking this guy, but it probably isn't this guy

54:29.000 --> 54:32.000
who's an actual Ubisoft staffer who worked on Black Flag and so forth.

54:32.000 --> 54:35.000
So who knows? It could have been an internal thing.

54:35.000 --> 54:39.000
I would think it's a smart thing to do to get a little hype for your game.

54:39.000 --> 54:43.000
Why not, quote unquote, leak a screenshot to Reddit

54:43.000 --> 54:46.000
and let the internet hype on that for a little while

54:46.000 --> 54:49.000
and let all the game blogs and podcasts talk about it like we're doing now.

54:49.000 --> 54:52.000
So anyway, it's a picture of a picture,

54:52.000 --> 54:55.000
so it's not like an actual dump from the screen.

54:55.000 --> 54:59.000
It's a picture of a monitor, but it actually shows a character on a boat

54:59.000 --> 55:02.000
who's wielding a bow and arrow wearing a shield on their back.

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
So you can actually see.

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
And it looks like they're on a boat again,

55:06.000 --> 55:09.000
which indicates there could be some more naval things going on here.

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
I'm on a boat.

55:11.000 --> 55:14.000
It also shows that the mission is called Assassinate the Crocodile.

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
It sounds like very serious business,

55:16.000 --> 55:19.000
although the crocodile could be codenamed for an individual,

55:19.000 --> 55:20.000
you know, somebody on another boat.

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
It's Peter Pan.

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
Do not kill Peter Pan.

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
So anyway, interesting.

55:26.000 --> 55:29.000
And apparently it actually says in the text for the mission,

55:29.000 --> 55:32.000
follow Shadia to Kenut's Villa.

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
I'm probably mispronouncing these names, sorry,

55:34.000 --> 55:37.000
but those names have to do with the Queen of Egypt.

55:37.000 --> 55:41.000
So this is possibly like an Egypt-based game. Who knows?

55:41.000 --> 55:45.000
But some other rumors about the game is that apparently the game is huge.

55:45.000 --> 55:48.000
It is an open world experience set in Egypt,

55:48.000 --> 55:52.000
telling the tale of the original Assassin's Guild.

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
It's sounding like it's a game.

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
They are saying it's as big as Skyrim,

55:56.000 --> 56:00.000
which seeing how Zelda Breath of the Wild did,

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
that stuff is all the rage right now.

56:02.000 --> 56:06.000
Let's take the vast open world-ness and adapt it to our game.

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
And for Zelda Breath of the Wild,

56:08.000 --> 56:11.000
that has actually worked out very, very, very, very, very well for them.

56:11.000 --> 56:12.000
So it'll be interesting.

56:12.000 --> 56:17.000
What do you think of Assassin's Creed going to an open world, large format?

56:17.000 --> 56:21.000
It was pretty open world as it was, just not a huge environment,

56:21.000 --> 56:24.000
as long as it's interesting and fun.

56:24.000 --> 56:27.000
I still don't want to play it, but...

56:27.000 --> 56:33.000
Now also, they're talking about that this game actually will have two protagonists in it.

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
There will be a pair of protagonists.

56:35.000 --> 56:38.000
It's a male and a female, which, if you remember,

56:38.000 --> 56:42.000
one of the reasons the Assassin's Creed Unity game got a lot of shit

56:42.000 --> 56:45.000
was the whole line about rendering females is hard.

56:45.000 --> 56:46.000
Remember that whole thing?

56:46.000 --> 56:50.000
Well, they did show examples of how hard it was to render anything.

56:50.000 --> 56:51.000
Yes, exactly.

56:51.000 --> 56:56.000
So Ubisoft may be trying to do a little better there by...

56:56.000 --> 57:00.000
I don't know if there is two protagonists you will ping-pong

57:00.000 --> 57:03.000
and play a little bit of each, or if you get to pick one or the other,

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
or what the deal is there,

57:05.000 --> 57:08.000
but it sounds like they're going to have a man and a woman for you to choose from

57:08.000 --> 57:11.000
in the new Assassin's Creed game.

57:11.000 --> 57:12.000
Interesting.

57:12.000 --> 57:15.000
So we'll see what happens with this.

57:15.000 --> 57:18.000
I assume much more information to come at E3.

57:18.000 --> 57:21.000
This will probably be a big highlight at an Ubisoft press conference,

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
assuming they do one, but they do every year.

57:23.000 --> 57:24.000
Yeah, I think they're doing one.

57:24.000 --> 57:25.000
Did they already time it?

57:25.000 --> 57:26.000
I didn't know they announced the time.

57:26.000 --> 57:30.000
Maybe not. Maybe I just assumed they are.

57:30.000 --> 57:31.000
Yeah, they do one every year.

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
Hopefully Ayesha Tyler is back to host it.

57:33.000 --> 57:34.000
I enjoy her as a host.

57:34.000 --> 57:37.000
I know she gets mixed reviews, but she is a gamer.

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
She loves her Gears of War and stuff,

57:39.000 --> 57:43.000
so I'm all for her being a host again at Ubisoft.

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
I think she's better than...

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
Who's the other comedian that they had before?

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
The guy from Community who was on the soup.

57:49.000 --> 57:50.000
Joel McHale.

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
No, no, no. Joel McHale.

57:52.000 --> 57:53.000
For him.

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
There was...

57:55.000 --> 57:58.000
It's the other white comedian that was so funny.

57:58.000 --> 57:59.000
Well, there's so many.

57:59.000 --> 58:00.000
I can see his face, but I can't...

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
Carrot Top, Rob Schneider.

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
No, he was in the stupid...

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
God, I can see his stupid face,

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
but I can't think of his stupid name.

58:09.000 --> 58:10.000
Maybe somebody in chat knows.

58:10.000 --> 58:11.000
I don't know.

58:11.000 --> 58:12.000
Darktitsius is Jamie Kennedy?

58:12.000 --> 58:13.000
Yes, thank you.

58:13.000 --> 58:14.000
Oh, God.

58:14.000 --> 58:15.000
Yes, Jamie Kennedy.

58:15.000 --> 58:16.000
I'd erase that from my mind.

58:16.000 --> 58:17.000
He's not funny.

58:17.000 --> 58:20.000
Exactly. Exactly.

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
He's the guy from Scream that everybody likes.

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
He's only comedian by occupation.

58:28.000 --> 58:29.000
I forgot he had done that.

58:29.000 --> 58:30.000
That's right, he did do that.

58:30.000 --> 58:31.000
All right.

58:31.000 --> 58:32.000
Joel McHale is all right.

58:32.000 --> 58:35.000
I really wish I had cable, because I'd still watch the soup.

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
Ayesha Tyler's just busy, though, but I think she lives in L.A.

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
That's where they do The Talk, right?

58:39.000 --> 58:40.000
Because The Talk is...

58:40.000 --> 58:41.000
Is she on Talk To Now, too?

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
Well, she's on the...

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
CBS has their own version of The View called The Talk

58:45.000 --> 58:49.000
with, like, Julie Chen and the girl that was on Roseanne all grown up.

58:49.000 --> 58:50.000
Sharon Osbourne.

58:50.000 --> 58:51.000
That's her show.

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
And Ayesha Tyler is one of the panelists on that show.

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
She has been for, like, two years, Loki.

58:55.000 --> 58:58.000
Yeah, because, you know, I watch all those morning women talk shows.

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
Well, maybe your wife makes you, because your wife makes you.

59:00.000 --> 59:01.000
She does it!

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
Like, when am I going to have time to do that shit?

59:03.000 --> 59:04.000
I mean, seriously.

59:04.000 --> 59:05.000
Oh, I'm going to...

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
I'm going for The Talk to figure out what...

59:07.000 --> 59:10.000
I want to hear your opinion about all the internet news I read yesterday.

59:10.000 --> 59:11.000
But she's busy.

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
Okay, so one of the few shows I watch on Netflix is Chelsea Handler.

59:13.000 --> 59:14.000
Like, don't judge me.

59:14.000 --> 59:15.000
I love her.

59:15.000 --> 59:19.000
But Ayesha Tyler was on Chelsea's show, and she's got a movie coming out.

59:19.000 --> 59:22.000
Like, she directed and wrote a movie, or I don't know if she wrote it, but she directed it.

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
And so she's probably busy.

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
I would be very surprised if she does the Ubisoft thing.

59:26.000 --> 59:27.000
She's very busy.

59:27.000 --> 59:28.000
Like, what is it?

59:28.000 --> 59:34.000
She was recording for Archer, doing talk show, doing her... whose line?

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
She's like the female Ryan Seacrest.

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
Ryan Seacrest? Dude.

59:38.000 --> 59:42.000
You hate on that guy, but man, that guy fucking works.

59:42.000 --> 59:45.000
He's got employment out the ass.

59:45.000 --> 59:46.000
Yeah.

59:46.000 --> 59:50.000
He's got more jobs than any of us do, so you gotta do that.

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
Jamie, I feel like you're dying to say something.

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
I just felt ready to say, though, she has more talent.

59:56.000 --> 59:57.000
Fair enough.

59:57.000 --> 59:58.000
I'd agree, I'd agree.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:01.000
I mean, I like Ryan Seacrest, but I love Ayesha Tyler, so there you go.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Remember, where there's a woman, there's a way.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:06.000
And Ryan Seacrest, I don't believe is a gamer.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Ayesha Tyler is, so there's that.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
All right, anyhow.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Wasn't this supposed to be a story about Assassin's Creed, and now it's turned into a

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
let's talk about Ayesha Tyler's career?

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Maybe Ayesha Tyler can voice a new Assassin in...

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Why not?

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Why not?

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.000
Why not?

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:24.000
She was a character in Gears of War, if I remember right.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
She was always a big fan of that series, so anyway.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Or was it Halo?

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
I swear she showed up in some video game, though.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Now I know that Conan O'Brien was a character in Halo 5.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
Him and Andy.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
That's right, oh my god.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
All right, let's move on to something else.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:44.000
This is the new story I don't want to talk about, but we need to, right, Dark Sakura?

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.000
I can't sigh any louder for the phone.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Or for the mic.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.000
We love our Mass Effect.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
We mostly love BioWare.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Mostly.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.000
Mostly.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:04.000
But this is just, I really don't know what to make of it.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:13.000
So basically, BioWare Montreal is being turned into a support studio.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:19.000
And that means that their work is being moved on to other franchises.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:29.000
In fact, a big group of the BioWare Montreal employees were moved over to work on Star Wars Battlefront II.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:34.000
And the rest of them are going on to another property that's codenamed Dylan.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
That's that other sci-fi game they're working on.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Because you know BioWare's got a new IP that they're doing.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Yeah, I know.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:45.000
And the rumor is, it's an answer to Destiny.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
It's gonna be that whole type of thing.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Which, I kind of shudder like you at first too, but then Dark Sakura, I think about how fun multiplayer is in Mass Effect when it works.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:02.000
So the first thing they need to do with Dylan, fucking fix Origin.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Or don't run the game through it.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
I cannot stress this enough.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:11.000
You know they won't do anything because Origin is their baby, whatever.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
But anyway, sorry Dark Sakura, but I had to get that out.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:18.000
But anyway, it doesn't mean that there won't be another Mass Effect game.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:21.000
It means they're still supporting Mass Effect.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:26.000
You know, maintaining the servers, making sure everything is supposedly working right, bringing out patches.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.000
And we did just get a new add-on.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:35.000
But at the same time, we really don't know what that's gonna spell for the future of Andromeda for right now.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:43.000
Since I'm completely clueless into the whole Mass Effect series, wasn't Andromeda developed by a different BioWare team than the first three?

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Yes, it was.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.000
Montreal did not do the first three games.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:52.000
The first three games were, I forget, Edmonton?

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
I think so.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
What happened to them?

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
They're working on the Dylan game.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:06.000
So Montreal, however, developed DLC for Mass Effect 3.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
And it was good.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
The Citadel DLC, in my opinion, was...

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Oh no, Citadel DLC was...

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.000
No. Which one?

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Omega.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Omega. They did Omega and that one was kinda...

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Omega was okay. It was pretty fun.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
But Citadel was great.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Citadel was wonderful. It was basically everyone's fanfics come to life.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Yeah.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:32.000
So maybe they're gonna take them off of Mass Effect and bring back the original team to Mass Effect.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:33.000
Well, the problem is...

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
The original team is working on Dylan.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Well, they're gonna be working on Dylan forever.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
A lot of the original team is gone.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Casey Hudson, gone.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Like, you know, some of the story people, gone.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
A good number of people left already on their own.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:50.000
So, you know, I don't think they can exactly get the band all back together again.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
Do you want to say more on this?

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Because I got my own take, but I don't want to interrupt you.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.000
No, go ahead.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.000
So, I just... I mean...

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:02.000
God, I'm so confused with this because I'm disappointed, but I'm not surprised.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.000
The minute the reaction to this game all over the internet was negative,

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:09.000
I was not surprised that this is the inevitable end point we're at is that

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.000
the game is gonna be put on hold for a little bit.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
I guess kinda like Assassin's Creed was.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
But then again, we weren't getting new Mass Effect games every year.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:21.000
So my concern is that it's gonna be a very long time before we get another Mass Effect game.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
In a way, I might be part of the problem.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
I started... Well, I mean, I bought the game, so I'm not.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
But I started playing Mass Effect Andromeda.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
I didn't finish it.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:32.000
But the reason I didn't finish it is because BioWare came out and said

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
they're gonna patch a whole bunch of stuff.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:39.000
So I said, you know what, I'll just wait and play this one that has the fully realized romances

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.000
and all this other stuff.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
Which that patch, I think, just came out.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:46.000
It does not change the Gill romance or any of that stuff.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:50.000
It just... It does other stuff, like outfits and things.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
But see, isn't that kind of like the weird point now?

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Like, we kind of are all doing that with these games.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:59.000
It's like, they come out, it's like, well, I guess I'll just play it when it's finished patching.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Like, Just Cause 3, when it came out, was a piece of shit.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
It ran fucking poorly.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.000
And I was like, well, I'll just wait until, you know, the patch to play it.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Final Fantasy XV, when it came out, there was a bunch of stuff wrong with it

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
and they have the patching stuff to fix things.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Oh, okay, I'm gonna play it then when it's finished patching.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:17.000
Now, at Mass Effect Andromeda, just fucking release your games working.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:22.000
I played it right after it came out and I had no problem with it.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:25.000
The animation issues weren't terribly distracting.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:28.000
That's the thing. That's exactly right.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:31.000
A lot of that shit was blown way out of proportion.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.000
It really wasn't that bad at all. It was people nitpicking.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
And I thought some of it was fucking funny.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Most of the shit on the internet is from people who didn't fucking play it.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:44.000
And that's the thing that pisses me off more than anything.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:47.000
However, and this is a big however,

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:50.000
I also think this game should have been delayed six more months.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:51.000
I think so.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:56.000
It should have been a holiday release and almost any Mass Effect fan I talk to agrees with this.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:57.000
Yeah.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:03.000
So, ultimately, the decisions was EA, I'm assuming it had to be, to put this game out.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:07.000
EA's CEO did put out a statement about it.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:12.000
They were really happy with how BioWare was doing and how they were treating Mass Effect.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.000
And the quote here is,

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Our expectations for Mass Effect are still strong for the future and the franchise overall.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:22.000
But they are putting focus on live service games.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:33.000
And Dungeon Buster follows that up with the same thing as EA saying they still have great confidence in BioWare and all this stuff.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Of course they do, because Andromeda ended up being a good game.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:41.000
And EA shares some of the blame for why it came out of the oven a little early.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:46.000
And, again, my other biggest bitch about Mass Effect Andromeda,

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:49.000
and no, I'm not going to shut up about this until they fix Origin,

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:54.000
I am fucking pissed that I did a match online where I used consumables,

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:59.000
which is something that, you know, either you use the in-game currency to get or you pay them money to get.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:05.000
And I got kicked out of the match with five fucking seconds to go,

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:08.000
didn't get credit for a goddamn thing and lost my consumables.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
And it's Origin's fault.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:17.000
So EA shares some of the responsibility for why Mass Effect is as borked as it is.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:20.000
Which isn't really all that borked.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:25.000
Which isn't really all that borked except for some of these things that I'm not letting go, like the online thing.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:28.000
But the single player experience is fine and all that stuff.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:32.000
And it is disappointing to know that it's not going to get DLC.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:36.000
Now, the original Mass Effect game didn't really have DLC.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:41.000
I mean, it did, but it wasn't nearly as expansive as the DLC in Mass Effect 2 and 3.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:47.000
But the game's already so big. It really is huge, and there's so much to do.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:52.000
Like, I could beat the first Mass Effect in maybe a week if I played a little bit every day.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:55.000
And this one took me three weeks of steady playing to beat.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Now, I didn't have a lot of time in one sit-down to play.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:04.000
But, you know, I played for two to three hours a night every night.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:10.000
And I was going for almost full completion. I wanted to at least, you know, keep certain people alive.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:16.000
But I was super happy with it.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:22.000
You know, it's like you were saying, the only people who were, you know, pissy about it were the people who weren't playing it.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:26.000
Oh, well, I heard this. Did you fucking play it?

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:29.000
Well, no. Then shut up. I don't care.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Well, this blog said, did you play it?

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:36.000
No, but I watched it. No, shut up. Shut up.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Play the damn game and form your own fucking opinion.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:44.000
Learn to think for yourself.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
I don't think it's fair, to be honest. You know why?

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Why am I gonna invest $60 in a game that looks that fucking janky? I'm sorry.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
It doesn't look janky. It's a great game.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
Based on the videos I've seen, it looks fucking janky.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:58.000
But you are watching, like, two second clips of an 80 hour experience.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:01.000
No, I'm not. I'm watching long plays of the game.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:08.000
And I'm sorry. It looks fucking janky. I'm not investing $60 into a game that may be patched later on.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:13.000
No, I don't think it's fair that I should have to do that. My point is, it should come out of the gate looking nice.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:16.000
I want to know what you're looking at that looks so janky, because it's beautiful.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:24.000
Look, I'm sorry. I cannot take this from somebody who is a fan of Skyrim and Bethesda and the shit that they get away with every time.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:27.000
Why are you giving them a pass?

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:34.000
Because their games are janky. I know that going into it. Is Mass Effect advertised as a janky-ass game?

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:35.000
But it's not.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:40.000
I think that says it all right. That's fine. I'm gonna take that answer. Y'all draw your own conclusions.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:43.000
But it's not. I mean, maybe people are playing with shitty graphic cards. I don't know.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:52.000
I upgraded my graphics card in the middle of my playthrough and I had zero problems. It was fluid. The animations were fine.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
It was perfect.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:10:05.000
If you're trying to introduce new people into the series and you're trying to get them interested, just the whole animations and everything, yeah, it does take away from the whole impact of scenes and stuff.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:11.000
And I do. I don't want to play that. Also, I don't want to play it because it's not broken enough.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:21.000
That's the thing, Loki. This is where Jamie and I are at. In Skyrim, you have the exact same problems, but yet you're giving that a pass.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:28.000
And to be fair, Jamie and I have a history with Mass Effect and we've always loved the game, so yes, we're going to defend it a little more.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:34.000
And you've always been a fan of the Elder Scrolls game, so you're going to defend that a little more. This is just that whole gamer thing coming into play.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:40.000
See, the Elder Scrolls games were pretty. I just couldn't get into them. They were kind of boring.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:44.000
I don't think they were pretty. They're long.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:47.000
I think Elder Scrolls is pretty, actually. I would say Elder Scrolls is a pretty game.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Well, I thought Skyrim was certainly pretty.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:50.000
Yeah, especially the HD.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:54.000
I'm actually kind of enjoying Elder Scrolls Online for a little bit. I need to go back and play some more.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:11:06.000
But the problems with animation, because I played pre-patch and post-patch, they were really minor. Really minor. Like, you had to be looking for them.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:11.000
So anyway, I think the one thing we can all agree on here, as much as the chat room is like,

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:16.000
yeah, OLR, throw down. Look, at the end of the day, we're going to disagree on some games, but we're still going to eat Oreos, waffles, cookies together.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:21.000
So, here's the thing. The one thing it sounds like we can all agree on, the game should have been delayed.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:25.000
And the other thing we can agree on? Skyrim is janky.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:30.000
Well, yeah, of course it is. That's why I like it. It is incredibly janky.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:40.000
To Loki's credit, Loki is the only person that I've seen entertained by Driver 3 for hours and hours and hours because of how fucking janky it is.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:49.000
I do want to ask this. Which people who played through Mass Effect Andromeda did not complain about Sam? Shut the fuck up, Sam.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:54.000
I don't care about the weather, the radiation, bless whoever made the Shut Up Sam mod.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:57.000
Which, didn't they just patch that in the game officially?

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:58.000
I don't know.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:11:59.000
I think they did.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
But Sam talks too much.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:05.000
Alright, let's see. I gotta grab some comments from chat here.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Stoppy in chat says,

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:16.000
Sky, a game has to make a good first impression. I can name a handful of games that look like shit but are fun to play, but I'm not going to cry about people not giving them a chance because that's not how consumers work.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:19.000
If it was free or close to it, that would be a different issue.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:23.000
Speaking of free, let me tell you about a game that had a huge turnaround.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:27.000
Diablo 3. Remember what a fucking garbage heap that game was when it first came out?

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:28.000
I thought it was fun.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
But even when it very first came out?

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Yeah, I thought it was fun.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:32.000
It was rough.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:35.000
I actually played it more right after it came out than after they changed everything.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:45.000
It was rough. Well, that I'm not with you with because it came, when they finally got rid of the auction house, basically when they did the expansion, that game turned right around and now it's fantastic.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:56.000
Or another one that I've played way, Final Fantasy XIV. The worst MMO I ever played in my life when it first came out. Now, the best.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:02.000
So, I should say one of the best. So, I mean, games kind of can turn around in that regard.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:13.000
But there's something about those two particular games and those two particular franchises where, and maybe it's just because of the weight of companies like Blizzard or the fact that it was an MMO with Square Enix and stuff,

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:17.000
where those games were kind of afforded a second chance that most games aren't given.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:24.000
And I agree, at least in the extent of the first impression of a game is so important.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:35.000
And that's why, and I said this on the show too, the 10 hour preview thing, again, what EA did through Origin, was the worst thing they could have done for Andromeda.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:41.000
That preview thing was the worst thing they could have done for that game. But they did it and they should have delayed it.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Well, they have to do that because they sell that. That shouldn't be a thing that they sell to play a game a few hours early.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Again, I disagree with that and that's on EA in my opinion. Dungeon Buster in chat says, it's not perfect either, but they weren't as in your face about Andromeda's.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:07.000
Heck, the original Mass Effect trilogy were incredibly polished compared to Andromeda for me. I don't think the original Mass Effect game had its issues too, but you know.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:11.000
The original ones weren't great until after there were the good high res mods.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:23.000
I remember the problems they had with rendering Turian faces, especially the ones for Garrus' face in the first one. And that shit never got really fixed. It took modders to fix it.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:37.000
You want to know another game in a completely different genre from things that we're talking about that I think kind of failed to make a good first impression, at least for me, that apparently is being patched and is now a lot better than it was its first go around.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:52.000
It's a recent game. Super Bomberman R. That game came out on the Switch, right? And I think that game, it's apparently selling pretty well, but I would say it's only selling well because it's one of a very few launch titles that's retail on the Switch.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:15:02.000
That's the only reason that game is selling. I'm sorry. I don't buy into the whole, oh Bomberman, people love this again and all this. Now, that game was only selling because it was one of the few things available at retail.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:18.000
Because I did not think that game was particularly great the first time I played it. Again, I was never into Bomberman that much to begin with. I think it's kind of an overrated franchise in my opinion and there's just going to always be certain games we all kind of disagree on.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:31.000
But my understanding is I should give it a second shot because apparently they patched a lot. They changed a lot of stuff with that and they've been doing this free DLC and all that stuff. So there's another example of a game that kind of had a first impression for some people.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:42.000
They know how it plays. I mean, they have units to play the game on. How do they not know this plays poorly? And they're like, well, that's good enough. I mean, that's the decision that they made.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:46.000
Yeah, maybe they did. Maybe they did know. Unfortunately.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:56.000
And then they come back, oh, look, oh, we hear you. We're going to make sure it's taken care of. What if we didn't hear from you? Oh, well, that's good enough for them. I mean, come on.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:08.000
All right. In the interest of time, we're going to move on to our next story. But needless to say, I'm glad at least it doesn't sound like it's the last time we'll hear about Mass Effect, but it sounds like it's probably going to go to another team within BioWare.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:20.000
And it'll also be interesting to see what happens with this new game that they're working on, which we should at least kind of get to see some glimpses of at E3. We'll see. Moving on though for now, Loki.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:36.000
All right. So Steam put out this big blog post, or I should say Valve put out this big blog post about Steam, mainly the Steam store and talking about kind of where it's been and where they're going with it and how they're going to be making revisions.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:50.000
And so one of the things you're talking about, you know, there's different users, of course, of the store, like people that are constantly viewing the store, people that just come there once a month, you know, different developers that have stuff in the store.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:17:06.000
And they're talking about a little bit how, you know, the experiment with Greenlight was kind of a step towards opening up Steam to a wider range of games and developers. And, you know, they didn't entirely work out the way that they wanted to.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:13.000
You know, they, you know, basically should have done some basic checks to make sure the game works and now they know that they need to do that on each title.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:19.000
But of course, you know, not just, you know, filter between what, you know, their tastes are and stuff.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:27.000
And then with that also, they're talking about how they're exposing now how these different recommendation algorithms work.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:38.000
So, for example, you know, if you're recommended a game now, what they're showing you is, you know, instead of just, oh, hey, why am I being recommended to play, you know, Hoth of a Boyfriend or something like that?

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:43.000
You can see, OK, well, it's because it's similar to these games you played or the reviews are positive.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:49.000
It's follow, you know, these curators that you follow recommended it, your friends like it, you know, that type of stuff.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:58.000
And so it kind of gives you more of an insight to why, you know, you're being recommended something, which is kind of useful, I think, instead of just blindly being recommended something.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:03.000
We see you're attracted to foul. Play Hoth of a Boyfriend.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:11.000
Well, I'm glad they're addressing some of these things, because I do have to admit the Steam store is really like hard to navigate for me.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:17.000
Like, and I actually I don't know, I, I think the personalization sometimes is almost a bit much.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:22.000
I don't like it seems like every little thing in there is like, you would like this because you like this.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
And that's not always the case. You know what I mean?

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:27.000
Like, I just sometimes I just kind of wish I could see the store.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:31.000
That's just like, what are the new popular games? What are the spotlights on and all this?

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:35.000
That's just why we kind of have it still. I mean, but yeah, it's just all over the place.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:42.000
It's all over the place. And it's just the Steam store is so bloated. That's the other big problem.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:52.000
It's so bloated that it's kind of hard to navigate around. And to be fair, I mean, I kind of feel the same way about like the app stores on phones, be it Apple or Google.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:55.000
Like there's just there's too fucking much. You know what I mean?

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:58.000
Yeah, it's really hard to find the diamonds.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:04.000
Just one of the things, you know, playing those clicker games, which require you to watch lots of ads for different bonuses.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:10.000
I get to see a lot of the different apps that are out there. And I got to say, man, all of them look the same.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:14.000
Like they seriously, it's just like a fucking cookie cutter.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:17.000
Oh, sure. One thing catches on like Clash of Clans or whatever.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:21.000
You still don't understand how that fucking Pokémon game is. I took a bunch of screenshots. I haven't posted on Twitter or anything like that.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:22.000
You should, you should.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:31.000
But it's like a fucking like just in your face, just complete IP violation fest right there.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:34.000
I'm like, how the fucking hell can you get away with this shit?

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
Tag Nintendo in your screencabs. That'd be fun.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:42.000
I've already reported it for violating IP, but it's just ridiculous.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:46.000
That's the thing is like the advertisements show the Pokémon stuff.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:50.000
But when you actually go to the page for the game, it doesn't show any of the Pokémon stuff.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:56.000
Cinco de Milo in chat says, Rob, how do you know you didn't like the game Steam recommended if you haven't played it yet?

01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:06.000
I guess I could take a chance on some of them, but the realistic part is there's only so many in the hours, so many hours in the day I have to game.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:13.000
Usually by the time I get to the store, I've already made the decision on what it is I'm going to buy.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:22.000
It's kind of like when you go to the grocery store, you know, oh, I'm going to buy some apples and I'm going to get some, you know, lunches for work and all this stuff.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
You know, you kind of already have like, you know what you're going to buy.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:28.000
But granted, once in a while you get tempted with other things.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:38.000
And that does happen to me on Steam, to be fair, is that sometimes I have, you know, bought things a little bit on a whim, but you know when it happens, Steam sale.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:42.000
And I think a lot of y'all fall for it during the Steam sale as well.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:47.000
It's like, oh, well, this game's a buck fifty right now. Shit. Why not? I'll buy it. Jump in.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:55.000
And that's the thing too, like the Steam sales now, the way that they're doing them, where it's not different each day, it's kind of like you look at it and you're like, okay, I'm done.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:21:01.000
You know, it's just, whereas I think they had more engagement when it was you mixing it up each day.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:06.000
Granted, I mean, there's certain rules, you know, wait for the, you know, flash sales or whatever.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:12.000
In a way, it's a bummer that the Steam streaming thing hasn't taken off more than it has.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:20.000
I mean, did you guys remember that you can actually stream video games within Steam? Like it has its own Twitch competitor embedded in it, right?

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:28.000
You know, that would be kind of neat if you're in the store, you can actually see people that are kind of playing the game there in the store so you can get a sense for like what the game is really like.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:39.000
Like get a live moment somewhere within the game. But, you know, then again, at the same time, you know, not every stream is the same and some are going to be like in very weird parts of the game.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:42.000
Are people actually, is that stream the Twitch or is that like, you know?

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
No, it's Steam's own internal thing that they do.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
Why would I use that then?

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
People are, it is out there.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:51.000
I don't know, I just would think that people would want to be on Twitch or something.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:22:00.000
The reason why I think of that is because I'm on the PlayStation Store and the Xbox Store, they do that, is that you have the whole like the game is there and then it's like you can click here and watch people that are playing it right now.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
Yeah, but those people are streaming the Twitch.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:03.000
They are.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:09.000
So why would I use the service to stream to Steam to do advertising for them? Like that, pay me.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
That's a great question.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:20.000
So, all right. Anyhow, moving on. Let's talk about E3 and let's talk about Nintendo a little bit. We brought them up there in that last story.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:29.000
They're detailing some of their E3 plans a little bit, what's going on. Of course, and this is no surprise, Super Mario Odyssey is going to be a big focus at E3.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:36.000
They are saying this is the first ever opportunity to play Super Mario Odyssey, so that will be something that's available at E3.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:46.000
Apparently, they are also doing a video instead of a press conference and this is expected, but this is getting a lot of interesting feedback on the Internet.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:52.000
Instead of a Nintendo Direct, they're calling it Nintendo Spotlight E3 2017.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:58.000
Some people taking issue with the name change, that it's not a Nintendo Direct, it's a Nintendo Spotlight.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:04.000
I don't really see what the big fucking deal is. I think it's going to be the same thing that you got before.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:16.000
I think the difference is, and the reason why they're calling it a Nintendo Spotlight, is because this time, you can go to E3 and play the games they're about to show.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:26.000
I think that's the difference. I think that's all this boils down to is that they're making this video not just for everybody out there, but the people that are about to walk in the door and actually see these things in front of them at E3.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:36.000
That's my thought. I don't know. But anyway, I just thought that was really weird on Twitter. A lot of people are like, oh, Nintendo's doing another thing and they need to be doing X, Y, Z.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
I'm like, it's going to be...

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
So, are they doing their Best Buy tour again?

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:44.000
I don't think they need to. E3 is public now.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
Yeah, I'm not going to pay to go down there.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:52.000
I'm just saying, they're going to get that word of mouth anyway, so the Best Buy thing was always kind of a clusterfuck anyway.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:24:01.000
But anyway, they are going to be, of course, during the spotlight, announcing new details for Nintendo Switch games launching this year, and Treehouse Live will be back.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:06.000
There's going to be tournaments for ARMS, because that game is out right days after E3.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:07.000
Before E3.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:08.000
Oh, was it right before E3?

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
I thought it was, isn't it the early part of June?

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:13.000
I thought it was June 16th, or right after.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:14.000
How is it after?

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:17.000
I don't remember. Maybe somebody in chat knows, but I thought ARMS was right after.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
Maybe it is right before. Maybe you're right.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
Here, let me take a look at the release date.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
Thank you. If somebody in chat didn't beat you to it already.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
Oh, it is on the 16th, yeah.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
The 16th. Okay, so it's Friday after E3.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:34.000
So anyway, they also will be doing Treehouse Live, and they are saying that there will be some announcements during Treehouse Live.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:40.000
Usually those end up being things like DLC and some other cute little things. It's not major, major announcements.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:43.000
Although, I don't know. I feel like there was a couple big ones that were dropped.

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:48.000
I remember at the Treehouse last year, that was the first time we got to see Pokemon Go.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:56.000
Well, the beta had been going on at that point, but that was the first time that they could openly really show Pokemon Go, which was kind of a big deal.

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:59.000
Especially considering that that's not really a Nintendo game.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:07.000
I mean, yes, it's an IP, but they really didn't have a lot to do with Pokemon Go besides the intellectual stuff from one of their subsidiaries.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:16.000
Splatoon 2 will also be livestreamed from the show floor. That's another big release that's coming in July, so that will get a lot of focus as well.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:23.000
I guess some people are taking issue with the fact that, does this mean there's not going to be anything else for the Switch this holiday?

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:32.000
And I don't think that's true. We know Xenoblade is another big one that's coming. They haven't talked about how that's going to play into E3, but they have dated that for holiday.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:42.000
I think there's still definitely room for surprises, and I think this is the time to finally fucking tell us, like, when else are they going to talk about?

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:43.000
Virtual Console?

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:51.000
Virtual Console, the online program that we're supposed to start paying for around the end of summer, and some of this stuff.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:26:04.000
I think some of these questions ought to be answered around the same timeframe, but at the same time, Nintendo can kind of do a direct, and has done a direct, whenever the fuck they feel like it.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:10.000
So, if it isn't announced at E3, that doesn't mean it won't come three weeks later.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:24.000
Does that make sense? Because I think, even with E3, they will still find a way to do another direct in July, just before Splatoon 2, to remind everybody that Splatoon 2 is coming and to get your pre-orders in.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:28.000
So, Nintendo will do that stuff.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:40.000
I think it's just a little different, what they're doing for E3, but it's not that different from what they did last year and the year before, except last year was solely Breath of the Wild, as we know.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:48.000
But that's also a great comparison, too, is that, keep in mind, last E3, we didn't know about the Switch.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:57.000
All we had was Breath of the Wild, and we knew that there was a new Nintendo system coming, but Nintendo didn't really start announcing any of that shit until way after E3.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:02.000
So, Nintendo's on Nintendo's timetable, I suppose.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:10.000
Let's see, come on, hand on your heart, and chat says, I'm hoping for Smash Bros., although it's Nintendo, so low expectations.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:14.000
I don't know, we talked about this last week on Mario Kart 8.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:15.000
Yeah, the remasters.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:21.000
People are willing to re-buy the Wii U games, and there's a lot of people that straight up fucking miss the Wii U games.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:30.000
I think Smash could stand to do very, very well on Switch. It would really not surprise me at all if they ended up doing a Smash Bros. port for Switch.

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:43.000
But I think if you're going to lower your expectations, you need to expect it's going to be the Wii U 3DS game with new stages, a few new characters, maybe some real surprise characters, though.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:47.000
We might get shit like Bomberman, you know, was obviously a big part of the Switch lineup.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:52.000
You know, you might get some real cool characters, but that would be about it, you know what I mean?

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
We'll see, you're shaking your head.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:28:00.000
It just pisses me off, like, I have a Wii U, and this is insulting, it's absolutely insulting.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:04.000
Oh hey, we're going to release this new system, it's going to have the same fucking games you already own.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:07.000
Well, but at least that's not all they're doing.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:12.000
There's plenty of other stuff too, like Mario Odyssey. I'm sure it's going to be badass.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:15.000
So, you know, there's other stuff too.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:21.000
It's not out, once again, I don't need to buy the system then because none of this shit is out.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
I'm not buying the system until this shit is out.

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:31.000
Because, you know what, I was fucking burned by the 3DS, I wanted my fucking Saints Row and DJ Hero, and I got neither of them, so fuck that shit.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:34.000
You wouldn't be able to find a Switch even if you wanted one.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:37.000
We talking about it, I've seen them in stores all the time.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
Are they? I thought they were still kind of hard to find.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
No, not at all.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
On several occasions I've seen them already.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:48.000
Alright, let's move on. More potential E3 stuff, right, Jamie?

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:51.000
Well, we remember Nana On'Sha, right?

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:52.000
Mhm.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:56.000
And Imus, who gave us Katarou Man.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:08.000
Well, they're two big guys, Masiya Matsuura and Kei Chiyano are going to be getting together to make a game that is currently titled Project Rap Rabbit.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:11.000
That is a new rhythm action adventure game.

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:22.000
Matsuura gave us Parappa, Vib Ribbon, Yano gave us Katarou Man, also Tatakae Oedon and the US remake Elite Beat Agents.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:25.000
And so they're going to be working together.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:35.000
There's not much else about it except that it seems to have this sort of ancient Japan vibe with some technology.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:47.000
Like a motorized unicycle and some drones and a flying saucer and a giant toad and a rabbit.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:57.000
I'm sorry, with the way his ears are tied up, I can't help but think of Usagi Ojimbo from the early TMNT stuff.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:06.000
I like the art style, it looks really neat and it just says it's coming quote very soon.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
Soon!

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:12.000
Ooh, maybe one of those surprise bombshells that it's on the store now.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:13.000
Mayhap.

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:16.000
At E3. I don't want to get my hopes up that far, but maybe a summer release.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:17.000
Mayhap.

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:18.000
Yeah.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:19.000
So we'll see.

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:24.000
I think something you're definitely going to see at Sony's press conference seems all but guaranteed at this point.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:27.000
Just a few more stories for you guys than the classic game of the week.

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
Or excuse me, actually this week we got a system, right?

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:30.000
Yep.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:31.000
Classic system of the month. Loki.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:32.000
Alright.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:36.000
So this is pretty exciting, maybe something we'll hear a little bit more about during E3.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:47.000
But we've got a brand new game coming from Edmund McMillan who is the creator of Super Meat Boy and the Binding of Isaac.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:56.000
So, not sure what it is yet, but they've teased that we're coming close to announcing it and it's release date so keep an eye out for it.

01:30:56.000 --> 01:31:04.000
I don't want to spoil the fun yet, but I can say this, it's hard, it's weird, it's personal, and it has amazing controls.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:10.000
It's a totally unannounced IP and easily one of the largest games I've ever made level wise.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:11.000
Oh, interesting.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:16.000
But, you know, a lot of the other stuff, the way he describes it does sound like the other two games.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
Not that that's a bad thing, those are both very good games.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:19.000
Yeah, sound good.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:22.000
So, yeah, we'll see. I'm curious if it's going to have a very similar art style.

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
Probably, they removed the reason.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:27.000
Leap Boy and Isaac are very, very similar in the way they look, even though they play completely differently, you know?

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:28.000
Yeah.

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:29.000
So, yeah.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:33.000
I'm sure that'll be an E3 surprise somewhere. We'll see.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:38.000
Let's move on to, here's a character that could show up in a Smash Brothers.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:45.000
I think they've requested, they being the fans, that she show up in Smash Brothers at some point and that's Shantae.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:48.000
Shantae, you stay. No, not that Shantae.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:53.000
This is Shantae, S-H-A-N-T-A-E. Shantae, the half genie hero.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
I remember the Kickstarters for this game.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:59.000
Yeah, and it's coming to Switch, which is a big surprise.

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
Big surprise, not.

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:05.000
But that's still awesome for Shantae and, again, people who missed it on the Wii U.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:11.000
So, WayForward did confirm that Shantae, the half genie hero, is going to come to Nintendo Switch over the summer.

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:16.000
It will be a digital and a physical release. XSeed is going to be handling the physical release.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:22.000
The game will be compatible with the HD Rumble and WayForward has announced all this stuff on Twitter.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:26.000
So, that may be something you see a little bit of a clip on at E3.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:30.000
And, again, puts Shantae out there.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:34.000
So, you know, again, if they did want to put her in Smash Brothers and answer some of that fan feedback,

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:39.000
that would be a great way to kind of put her back out there in front.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:42.000
I don't know. I think when it comes to the more indie games and stuff,

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:46.000
I think Shovel Knight is still one that a lot of people have their fingers and toes crossed for.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:51.000
But Shantae is certainly one of the big ones out of the Nintendo indies. We'll see.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:57.000
So, alright. But you know what? Let's take a trip down memory lane, shall we?

01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:02.000
Let's take a trip to the past with the classic Game of the Week segment.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:06.000
Every week, Dark's to the magic of radio.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:12.000
Not that. There's no radio magic this week. How the hell was that MV3 still in there?

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:15.000
That's embarrassing.

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:16.000
More like radio tragic.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:19.000
That was a radio tragedy right there. Alright.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:22.000
Let's get to the classic Game of the Week.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:29.000
And Dark Sakura is going to jump into the gaming vault and find a system.

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:35.000
Because plot twist in 2017, not only are there pre-recorded segments sometimes,

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
but there's a system. Actually, that was last year.

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
But there's a system of the month.

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:42.000
How is this a plot twist now that I've been doing it for five months?

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:45.000
That's true. I don't know. It's a continued twist. I don't know. Anyway.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:46.000
The classic Game of the Week.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:47.000
Spiral out of control.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:51.000
Dark Sakura, what is the classic system of the month?

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:54.000
The Texas Instruments TI99-4A.

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
You remember this thing?

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:58.000
Yes, I do.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:01.000
This was one of the first systems I ever played.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:07.000
In fact, I would even go on record saying that I played one of these before I played an Atari 2600.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:12.000
Or maybe roughly around the same time, but I have stronger memories of this because my friends had one.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:20.000
The TI99-4A was a computer that was released in June of 1981.

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:29.000
It came out for $525 at the time, which today would be about $1300 now.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:37.000
And it was an enhanced version of the TI99-4 that came out in 1979.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:44.000
Now the one in 1979 came out for $1150, which would be about $3700 today.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:49.000
So it actually was re-released with better stuff at a lower price point.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:54.000
So this was the first computer that had a 16-bit processor in it.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:12.000
It basically was like this weird built-in cartridge slot in it and a chiclet keyboard that was more of a calculator style keyboard.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:20.000
It was pretty neat, but it also had, for the 99-4A, it also had additional graphics mode.

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:25.000
You could use lower case characters instead of what were pretty much just small caps.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:28.000
And it had a travel keyboard.

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:32.000
It was the most powerful thing that was out at the time.

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:40.000
It had the ROM cartridge, which they referred to as solid state software at the time.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:45.000
And you could put in the cartridges for different applications or games.

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:49.000
You could do all kinds of stuff on it.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:59.000
Now there was a power regulator board that was housed in front of the cartridge slot.

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:03.000
And I remembered this because it got so hot.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:06.000
People were calling it the coffee cup warmer.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:14.000
But I remember we would have to put some padding around that because it was so hot and such.

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:22.000
One of the other neat things about this too is that you could get peripherals for 5.25 floppy drives.

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:28.000
You could get an RS-232 card that had two serial ports and a parallel port.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:32.000
Basically it had all kinds of extra add-ons.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:39.000
There was a thermal printer, an acoustic coupler, a tape drive that used audio cassettes as media.

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:43.000
Oh, don't get me started on the one in the Coleco add-on.

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:46.000
I still cry over how many erased tapes I had that day.

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:52.000
I erased mine too because I got this programming book for the TI basic and it came with a tape.

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:58.000
My family didn't understand how that worked and so we recorded over it.

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:12.000
The other thing about it too is that you could get it on its own or with a modified 13 inch TV.

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:20.000
It actually couldn't get its RF modulator approved by the FCC.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:27.000
But it eventually did chip with the modulator.

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:32.000
It also was great for speech synthesis. It had a plugin speech synthesizer module.

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:37.000
All kinds of neat stuff that it could do.

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:43.000
Seriously, if you look at it with all of its peripherals side to side hooked up to each other.

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:47.000
Oh my goodness, it was pretty crazy and it took up a lot of dust.

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
Is that Wolfenstein in TI?

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:55.000
This is one of those demo scene things.

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
So this isn't an actual game.

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
I just want something that had music.

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:03.000
Yeah, it shows that this is what the system is capable of rendering.

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
It's pretty awesome.

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:10.000
The way that you hooked up the peripherals to it were by a daisy chain fashion.

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:17.000
It would basically have a sidecar expansion unit that would just go on and on and on.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:21.000
But it took up a lot of room.

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:30.000
Not to go into too much else with this system is that you also had a joystick port for it.

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:34.000
You could use a wired remote controller.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
That's what the joysticks were called.

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:43.000
You could also use Atari 2600 joysticks with a converter.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
I remember that in particular.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:49.000
It had composite video and audio out.

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:52.000
It worked for NTFC.

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:59.000
The PAL based ones had to go through some UHF channel if I remember right.

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:02.000
But anyway, going back to the 80's.

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:07.000
This was the first 16-bit home machine that could play video games.

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:10.000
So technically this is our first 16-bit video game console.

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:15.000
As far as the hardware support, it was all plug and play.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:20.000
Pretty novel for its time given what systems were like then.

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:31.000
It had something called a hexbus that could be considered almost a prototype for today's USB.

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:37.000
The theory worked the same way that these are all powered ports for data transfer.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:45.000
Some of the other things you could get were a four-color printer, a 300 baud modem.

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:50.000
At the time though, pretty crazy.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:54.000
We had a 300 baud modem for our Commodore 64 and it was the shit.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
Now it's just shit.

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:01.000
You could also get these different cartridges that were the ROM cartridges.

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
This is where a lot of the game came through.

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:08.000
You get a memory plug in that gave you 4kb of ram.

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:16.000
You could also get a super cart that would go to 32k which is pretty good for what it was.

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:20.000
It also included the assembler grom.

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:27.000
Then you had various games that would come out with it.

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:33.000
For the games that came out, there was Space Invaders.

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:44.000
You had Parsec, well it was TI Invaders, Munchman, Alpiner, Tombstone City 21st Century, Hunt the Wumpus, and Car Wars.

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:50.000
A lot of the games were developed by John Phillips.

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:58.000
You could put them in cheat mode by holding shift and then pressing 838.

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
A lot of that was in there.

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:08.000
There were their own versions of some of the more popular games.

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:15.000
It was open architecture and super easy to develop for but it didn't make that huge of an impact.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:23.000
Some of the other major games, I know that Tunnels of Doom was a big one on there.

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:28.000
It was kind of like a D&D style game. It was pretty neat.

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:42.000
Today though, because of the capability it has with that 16-bit processor, there are modern developments going on.

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:47.000
People have done a build of Super Mario Brothers that will run on it.

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:52.000
It takes a while for that thing to load it, but it's all on that cartridge.

01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:11.000
Basically, what really drove this machine into failure was the advent of the Apple II and the Commodore systems.

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:18.000
When this machine first came out in 1979, the Apple II pretty much kicked it to the dirt.

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:25.000
At the time, its price point for the Apple II was about $200 less than what this machine costs.

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:30.000
By the time it came out in the 80s, we had Commodore running things pretty much.

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:43.000
Basically, the head of Commodore was almost immediately responsible for the demise of the system because of the output of the Commodore VIC-20.

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:52.000
There you go. A silver and black definite machine of its time.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:59.000
There actually is another big thing that killed it. Lack of third-party support.

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:09.000
Nintendo. Pay attention. Lack of third-party development can definitely kill something no matter how great it is.

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:13.000
It was a great system, and it still has a major cult following.

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:29.000
It was succeeded by the TI-99-2, the TI-99-8. There was the Geneve 9640 that was a clone of the system that was built as a card to fit into the TI peripheral expansion system.

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:37.000
There was a second-generation CPU. There was the Tommy Tutor. Basically, things like that.

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:41.000
But this right here? Our first 16-bit system.

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:43.000
Nice. There it is.

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:44.000
So there you go. TI-99-4A.

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:52.000
Your classic system of the month, the TI-99-4A. Not to be confused with the graphing calculators the Texas systems became known for later on.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
Hey, I used to play pole position on those.

01:43:54.000 --> 01:44:02.000
Yeah. I remember those graphing calculators were pretty sweet. But that is interesting how that kind of became like in the 80s when this faded.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:07.000
That's kind of what in the 90s Texas instruments really became known for were those fucking souped-up calculators.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:08.000
Right? Yeah.

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:18.000
Yeah. No, those were the shit. There's still… I mean, and we used to see… God, what was it? Tandy, which Tandy gave us Radio Shack.

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:19.000
Yeah.

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:26.000
Tandy had their own kind of version of the same thing. But I don't remember it taking off very well at all.

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:34.000
But this, I mean, when I was a kid, this was fantastic. I was like, ooh. So…

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:39.000
And Bobby Blackwolf points out the Texas instrument still does the souped-up calculators, even though we have smartphones now.

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:40.000
True that.

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:45.000
Yeah. I've seen their name. Now it's all color graphing calculators. Super fancy now.

01:44:45.000 --> 01:45:01.000
I will tell you this. When I was taking my algebra classes… I hate algebra. But anyway, when I was taking my classes, the teacher still insists on having a graphics calculator and not using your phone for it, even though the phone will do all the same functionality.

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:06.000
Because you do have a graphing calculator built in on the standard app, a scientific calculator, sorry.

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:07.000
Yeah.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:10.000
Built in with the standard calculator app if you turn your phone sideways.

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:11.000
Right.

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:16.000
But they don't want to have any risk of cheating. So…

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:21.000
Right. Like the graphing calculators weren't able to cheat with those.

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:35.000
Now, we had these kind of longer scientific calculators that we were using in chemistry. It was more like a data storage. But we were allowed to have that in chemistry, but we would just draw all of our formulas on them. So…

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:39.000
Interesting. All right. Well, we'll have to talk about the calculators another time.

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:42.000
For now, that is the classic system of the month.

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:50.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, target.

01:45:50.000 --> 01:46:03.000
We've got plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come. We're going to take a quick break. We will be back to do some rapid fire news, what's in stores this week, and of course, your calls at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype when we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:21.000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio. Live tonight with episode number 686 of our show, already in progress for this, May the 14th of 2017.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:30.000
I know those that are on the podcast feed don't get to hear our live music breaks because, you know, we can't just go around distributing other people's music as part of our show.

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:41.000
But we did do a live tribute tonight to Robert Miles, who passed away this week, obviously, a legendary trans music producer. I'm sure everybody knew that song, Children, back when that song first came out.

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:56.000
That song was all over my college years. I don't know about you, Dark Sakura. That song was everywhere. And then, of course, the one we played during the break was my one I'm partial to, a song called Fable, which I think many people knew that song from the fact that it was in the trailer to the movie Ever After.

01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:01.000
Did you ever see that movie, Dark Sakura, the one with Drew Barrymore and Angelica Houston?

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:02.000
No, I didn't.

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:11.000
No, you didn't? Oh, my gosh. It was a pretty good movie. It's worth your time. Just because Angelica Houston is awesome. I mean, is there anything that she's bad in? I don't think there is. Anyway.

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:24.000
All right, enough about movies. Let's get back into video games. Let's get to some rapid fire news. Again, you guys can, of course, join us over at live.vognetwork.com if you have anything to say as the show is going on. So, Loki, why don't you start us off with some rapid fire news?

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:43.000
Well, as you may remember, we talked a couple of weeks ago about how there was some hidden teases inside Bayonets PC release alluding to possibly Vanquish being the next game to be released. And, well, yes, it is. So, Vanquish has finally been announced coming to PC on May 25th.

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:56.000
And also with that, of course, they're going to have 4K resolution support, tons of graphic options, full keyboard and mouse support, and unlocked frame rates, which I believe is all good news for people.

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:04.000
So, yeah, a lot of people are very excited by that and definitely worth checking it out when it comes out in about a week.

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:18.000
And then finally, Bob Ross. That's not a character or a person you would normally associate with, you know, different games like Smite or, you know, Dota or something like that.

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:31.000
But, hey, Smite is getting a skin based off Bob Ross for Sylvanus. And I guess there's going to be a loading frame and jump stamp based off of Ross's face.

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:43.000
Actually, that is already out for PC players. It's coming out on May 16th for console players, and you can purchase it for $999 or $700 in-game gems.

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:55.000
I'm loving this resurgence of Bob Ross. It's kind of like, I guess, a meme in these past couple years. I mean, obviously, the Twitch thing was huge in that department, but just, you know, Bob Ross was just a freaking genuine person.

01:48:56.000 --> 01:49:06.000
So, I mean, putting him in the game Smite seems a little much, but, you know, Bob Ross was awesome and more people need to know about his show.

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:17.000
So, very cool. Alright, moving on to some other gaming news. Another E3 kind of preview, if you will, about the new Need for Speed game.

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:25.000
They did share a few details on their official website, that would be Ghost Games, about what to expect in the next Need for Speed franchise.

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:31.000
It will be out by the end of 2017. I'm sure that's no surprise there. That's something they're looking at doing probably for the holiday.

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:40.000
And they do say that customization will be as strong a role as ever. Of course, cop chases and street races. What else do you expect in a Need for Speed game?

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:54.000
Plenty of space in which to do the things you want. Also, I want to say they said something about, oh yes, you can do the single player experience completely offline, so now you can actually pause the game as well. Won't that be nice?

01:49:55.000 --> 01:50:02.000
So yeah, apparently the last Need for Speed game had some issues there, but you can play the single player experience completely offline if you want and then you can pause since you're offline.

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:12.000
So that's pretty awesome. So there'll be more details on the game, of course, leading up to EA Play in June. That is an offside event from E3.

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:21.000
That is, of course, where we're expected to see more on FIFA 18, Star Wars Battlefront 2, and so on. We'll get more information on all that Saturday, June 10th at noon.

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:27.000
When the EA Play 2017 livestream is happening, that's all during the EA kickoff weekend.

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:41.000
On another note, Twitch has marked a day on their calendar to support more diversity and inclusivicity on the platform. Inclusiveness. Why can't I say that, but I can't say inclusivicity?

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
Anyway, May 26th, what?

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:45.000
Inclusivity.

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:47.000
Yeah, see? It ain't easy.

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:49.000
Inclusivity.

01:50:50.000 --> 01:51:07.000
Inclusiveness. Anyway, on May 26th is the day. That's a Friday, and so Twitch is going to be celebrating what's called hashtag Twitch Unity, and they're going to be highlighting channels on the page that exemplify a positive culture that day, encouraging streamers to generate relevant discussions.

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:17.000
There's also going to be an emoji for the event, and I think they are doing a t-shirt as well where the proceeds all go to Amnesty International and their fight for human rights around the globe.

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:33.000
So yeah, that's pretty cool. You know, Twitch has had its problems in the past, and when you look around at the streamers, you see a lot of white dudes. Although, I'm seeing more women get involved, which is great.

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:37.000
Really, there's no barrier to entry for that stuff.

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:45.000
It is getting more and more accessible, so that's, you know, I think we just need to encourage more people to get in there and actually stream and have more voices heard.

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:58.000
And I've always been about that for podcasting, for sure, is that, you know, I don't see other podcasts as competition. I see that as a great thing, is that more voices are out there and more people are being heard. I would encourage everybody to podcast if you wanted to.

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:13.000
Anyway, so I guess Twitch is trying to improve some things because they did have a diversify Twitch panel, and the chat room turned into a toilet bowl, as you can probably expect happens on Internet chat rooms sometimes.

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:22.000
So Twitch is, you know, as a company trying to do things to really distance itself from that, and I'm sure, you know, there's a lot of learning to go all around.

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:30.000
But hopefully, many folks will see this as an opportunity to participate, and, you know, this is maybe a day to catch Twitch's ear on a lot of that stuff.

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:49.000
So I don't know yet if I will be participating or not. Here's the thing. The 26th is the Friday of Memorial Day weekend, so it's also kind of a weird weekend to do, but I'm gonna try and participate there on the Twitch Unity campaign that's on May 26th.

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:52.000
So, anyway, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

01:52:53.000 --> 01:53:09.000
I have some stuff. Basically, how about a big sale for our Xbox folks? There's gonna be a backwards compatibility sale that will put more than 275 games on discount, some of them up to 75% off.

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:31.000
This starts on May 16th, which will be Tuesday here in the US. In other news, Taiko no Tatsujin is gonna be on the Nintendo Switch by March of next year. Yeah, we got some time on that one, but look forward to it. And maybe you'll get to play it at E3.

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:36.000
Sounds like something that's trying to get in by the end of a fiscal year for somebody over there.

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:38.000
Right.

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:45.000
But the nice thing is, with this Switch being region-free, no longer will we have to worry about, oh, Japan has like 20 different Taiko games and we get...

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:47.000
Import that sucker!

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:49.000
Yeah, exactly. You can do that now. So, very cool.

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:58.000
Alright, let's talk about what's in stores this week. Things you can get your hands on a little sooner than a new Taiko no Tatsujin game. Starting in the US. Loki?

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:10.000
Do you have some interesting stuff this week? So, for PlayStation VR, they're gonna be getting Farpoint, which is a new first-person shooter game. It actually does, they sell a retail version with...

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:20.000
I don't know if you remember when they were doing that whole push for the PlayStation Move and 3D and stuff. They kinda sold this gun peripheral thing for the Move.

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:22.000
Yeah.

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:32.000
And their little navigation controller. Well, since now the nav controller isn't really something that they sell a lot of, and that harness thing for those is not something they sell anymore, I think...

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:40.000
They're actually making a new one that's kind of all incorporated in the one piece for this game. So that's gonna be kind of neat and see if they're gonna use that for further shooters.

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:54.000
But that's gonna be out this week. Also, Operation Babble, the new Tokyo Legacy on PC and on the Vita. The Surge on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:54:54.000 --> 01:55:17.000
Bokeda, Heartfelt Reunion on PC. Thumper on Nintendo Switch. Fire Emblem Echoes, Shadow of Valentia on 3DS. Skylar and Plux, Adventure on Clover Island on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. And that's it.

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:26.000
Alright. Let's travel to Japan and check out some of the releases there. We're finally... Now Golden Week is behind us, so we're getting back into some regular video game releases in Japan.

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:40.000
Including on the PlayStation 4 this week, the Japanese version of Prey will hit stores on May 18th. That's a game that I've been meaning to check out here, but it's one of those like, ugh, I don't know if I wanna jump in on the game because they really changed it from what it was.

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:49.000
And I really enjoyed it on the Xbox 360, but I'm hearing this time it's more like a lot of people are saying it's Bioshock in space. That doesn't necessarily sound bad.

01:55:50.000 --> 01:56:03.000
Yeah, maybe. But anyway, so I'm curious about this game. I wanna learn a little more about it and what they really did to it, but in Japan you'll get your chance to finally get your hands on it. We've had it a week or two, but you'll finally get your chance in Japan this week on the 18th.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:10.000
Also, Dark Sakura might be importing this. No, she probably won't, but it's Danganronpa 1 and 2 Reload is in Japan this week on the PlayStation 4.

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:12.000
These are the versions we already have.

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:22.000
Yeah, so it's something that's available. Yeah, that explains the low price in Japan. Also, Titanfall 2 moves into the best hits category in Japan this week, so you can check that out if you want.

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:31.000
Moving over to the Vita. Yes, we still get releases on the Vita in Japan, including Rewrite Harvest Festa comes out this week in Japan. That's kind of the lone release this week.

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:41.000
I don't believe we have anything on the Switch this week. No, Switch is still empty until we get to Ultra Street Fighter 2 a little later this month, which is the same story for us here in the US.

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:50.000
And on the 3DS, also a little slow right now in Japan, so really it's just about the Vita and the PS4 right now. Let's go to the UK, Dark Sakura.

01:56:50.000 --> 01:57:04.000
A few things. On the 16th, we have Farpoint, and then that's for PS4. On PS4, Xbox One, and PC, we have The Surge, and on the 17th, we have Bolkita, Heartfelt Reunion for PC.

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:12.000
Alright. By the way, going to the chat, following up something you were saying there, Loki, over at live.vognetwork.com, Dungeonbuster says,

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:20.000
Loki was close. There was a leak a while ago that proposed a spiritual system shock sequel that eventually became Prey.

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:27.000
Well, they're actually doing a remaster for System Shock. If you remember, they had that whole Kickstarter. I think it was Kickstarter that did that.

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:36.000
So that's coming still, but yeah, it'd be nice. I mean, hell, we don't know what the Bioshock Infinite team, you know, what those guys are doing anymore.

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:41.000
So, I'm curious to see what their next game is.

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:46.000
Before we get back into some gaming news, we need to visit our mailbag.

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:57.000
Every week, you guys email us. Participate at orangelaungeradio.com is the place to send your emails.

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:05.000
DarkSakura will dive into the mailbag head first and pull out some emails that she says, this is worth our time to read.

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:09.000
And sometimes she'll read the ones that aren't worth our time to. All tea, all shade. Alright.

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
So, DarkSakura, what do you have for us in the mailbag tonight?

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:22.000
Two emails. The first one, good evening yet again. As of Monday, I will finally, I have finally completed my first playthrough of Night in the Woods.

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:26.000
I will probably do another run focusing on Gregagaga. Extra Gs.

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:34.000
My bad habit with this one is playing for several hours at a time, stopping for several days, as much as a week, then putting in several more hours.

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:40.000
Not the best way to handle a story-based game. Also, just got the second volume of the soundtrack.

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:45.000
As much music goes into this thing, the game itself makes pretty good use of silence.

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:51.000
Speaking of silence, my Bluetooth headphones, an old pair of JBL Synchros broke at the earpiece.

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:58.000
I tried the BT-55s but found the controls hard to handle and the BT signal kept cutting out.

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:06.000
What headphones wireless or otherwise does or do each of you use? And yes, it would be do each of you use.

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:11.000
And can you recommend a good Bluetooth headset under $200? This is Robert M.

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:18.000
All my last ones were free. I had some Plantronics ones that were good. I've used Turtle Beach.

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:26.000
I even used my husband's Beats. They're alright. I don't like the way the Beats does game sound.

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:33.000
I use a Razer Chroma? Although that might be the mouse. I can't remember what they're all called.

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:43.000
It's a Razer and the lights on the head can change. When I play Diablo 3, everything goes red.

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:48.000
That's a cute little thing they do with Diablo 3. But that's a USB. It's not Bluetooth.

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:56.000
I still use USB because... I think I actually mentioned this a week or two ago. I'm not exactly some brand loyalist,

01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:01.000
but it just so happens that all this stuff I have. I have a Razer mouse, a Razer keyboard, a Razer headset.

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:11.000
So the mechanical keyboard I have is Razer and it has a USB port on it. So I plug my USB headset into that port and it works really well.

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:17.000
And maybe because it is all the same ecosystem, it kind of plays off each other. So I don't really have a need for a Bluetooth headset.

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:26.000
In that regard. The one thing I could say is that it does cause this really awkward wire to be showing on me when I'm streaming games.

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:34.000
You probably noticed I have a big old wire dangling from me because that's my headset. But I don't have enough experience with Bluetooth to really recommend you anything.

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:40.000
I'd have to look to chat. My car does Bluetooth, but that's not under $200.

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:44.000
Loki, what about you? Do you have any experience with headsets? Bluetooth or otherwise? What do you use?

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:50.000
The only Bluetooth headset I've ever had was just the Sony stereo ones for the PlayStation 3.

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:57.000
And those have broken unfortunately. So I don't really technically have a Bluetooth headset right now.

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:03.000
I just use a pair of headphones I got from Sony's actual online store because a long time ago with my old job,

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:09.000
they gave us as a promotion like $2,000 worth of money towards the Sony store.

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:14.000
And so I bought headsets for our game room at the time. So I own four pairs of them.

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:18.000
They're not really headsets. They're more headphones. They're just like normal headphones.

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:26.000
And I've worn them so long that all of the rubber that's on the actual headphone pad has worn off and now it's just like this felt.

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:31.000
And I'm just like, ah fuck it. I'm not gonna switch this out. Because it works fine for what I use.

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:38.000
So I use that with the PlayStation 4 because you can plug in the headphones into the controller, which I love that all consoles should have that.

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:43.000
It's fantastic. But yeah, I don't have a Bluetooth headset right now.

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:48.000
So I guess I totally lied because Act F reminded me. I do have a Bluetooth headset.

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:55.000
Act F says I love the Sony PlayStation 3 or 4 wireless headset. Duh! I do have a PlayStation 4 wireless headset.

02:01:56.000 --> 02:02:00.000
I wasn't thinking, I don't know why I didn't think of Bluetooth at first. Probably because I'm using it on my PlayStation on my PC and I just,

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:04.000
for some reason I wasn't associating Bluetooth. I do use that PlayStation 4 headset.

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:13.000
It's great for the audio in the game. It's not great for your voice. I sound very tin can when I do the live streams.

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:20.000
Because I was doing a Diablo live stream on my wireless headset and actually people were complaining about how awful I sounded.

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:29.000
So yeah, that is a concern. But I mean, it'll get you through your shooter games and the things you have to do with that.

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:39.000
And the sound output is fine. I mean if I want to really immerse myself in a game like, I think I use the headsets a lot when doing Edith Finch and some of those games.

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:51.000
You know, that was really good. Plus for some games, although it's really really limited, you can actually download audio balancing specs that the developers did.

02:02:51.000 --> 02:03:01.000
Because I know they have things like that for, you know, like your Call of Duty games. And what's the horror movie thing that was a huge sleeper hit?

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:03.000
Until Dawn.

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:07.000
Thank you, Until Dawn. There's one of those on there and all that stuff. So yeah, that's the headset.

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:12.000
Alright, some ideas for you, hopefully, Robert M. Let's move on, Darsakra.

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:16.000
Um, the last email. Um, it's long. Okay.

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:23.000
Hello Alar, Rob mentioned the scandalous In the Groove 3 cabinet he found before last week's show.

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:29.000
In actuality, this is an ordinary In the Groove 2 cabinet. The fact of the matter is that hackers gonna hack.

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:34.000
Beginning around 2006 or so, folks started to get bored of the songs that came on the machine.

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:42.000
Some digging on the hard drive revealed it was simply running a slightly modified Linux version of StepMania 3.95.

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:55.000
Some experimentation revealed that just as you can add songs, themes, notes, skins, etc. to StepMania on your computer, such things can also be added to an In the Groove 2 cabinet.

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000
Heck, I have actually done this myself.

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:05.000
Machine owners and savvy players who sought permission from their arcade's owners have modified the software in In the Groove 2 cabinets all over the world.

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:14.000
Some of the more popular themes include the Simply Love theme, Usault, which is a high-visibility theme, packing many tournament-friendly features,

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:25.000
and actually In the Groove 3 theme, which was leaked onto the internet in a partially finished date, along with the incomplete songs and stepcharts.

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:30.000
Fans finished off all the stuff on their own, and even designed the marquee that Rob saw atop the machine.

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:35.000
Modifying your own cabinet involves jumping through some hoops and dealing with the installed Linux OS,

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:43.000
or you could just wipe it out or replace it with a more modern OS and something called OpenITG, which is the newer open-source version of In the Groove.

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:49.000
It supports a wider range of hardware and is quite flexible. Highly recommended if you own a machine.

02:04:50.000 --> 02:05:01.000
Another note about the cabinets themselves. Some say Andamiro on them. That's because Andamiro actually manufactured the first batch of In the Groove 2 cabinets.

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:06.000
Cabinets that don't say Andamiro are manufactured later and are slightly lower quality.

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:14.000
And that's everything in a nutshell about modifying In the Groove 2 cabinets. Time to go buy one, except for the fact that they're actually quite hard to find,

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:18.000
quite expensive, considered to the cheap, freely available and older DDR machines.

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:26.000
In fact, the Andamiro can cost $5,000 or more, even today, oh well. Maybe next life, Aaron YYR.

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:32.000
I knew the minute we were having that discussion last week about that, what the hell is this In the Groove 3 machine I'm looking at,

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:40.000
I knew YYR would email the show and explain it all. And there it is. I'm just blown away that the marquee was a fan thing.

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:46.000
Like that's the thing that threw me. Like the cabinet being modded and all that stuff. I was like, all right, I get that. That's cool.

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:53.000
But like the fact that it actually has like a fan marquee and it's not like an official thing. That's the part that like threw me for a loop.

02:05:54.000 --> 02:06:03.000
But I was, well, I just, I wasn't expecting to see it in an arcade. Like somebody's house. Yes, this was in an actual arcade somewhere. That's why it threw me.

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.000
Looks like you're getting some serious trouble.

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:12.000
Which is why I'm saying, just if there's anybody out there, just let it go. It's not hurting nobody.

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:19.000
But there are a lot of arcades. I mean, shoot, even coin op down here is mostly privately owned machines.

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
Yeah. Maybe that's what's happening at the place I was at.

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:29.000
So a lot of times, especially if a person is leasing out their cabinets, you know, they could have their own custom artwork on it.

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:38.000
We were, when we were working on our MAME, I was making a marquee for it and I've seen custom art on cabinets and arcades before. So it's not entirely unheard of.

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:52.000
The other thing that really got me, I don't remember if it was in this email or something someone sent to me on Twitter or something, but somebody sent me like an, a different in the groove three marquee that looked really professionally done, but it was different from even the one I saw.

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:54.000
And I was like, okay, that's a trip.

02:06:54.000 --> 02:07:01.000
There's one that I saw where a guy built a cabinet completely from scratch, like pads, everything in that sucker look legit.

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:08.000
So, I mean, there's, and that's on YouTube. I think if you search for like a custom ITG three cabin or something like that.

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:16.000
I got to say though, I wonder if that's the case of the in the groove three machine, then I wonder if that's why they had some DDR thing.

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:27.000
It was DDR, what 2014 or 2015, one of those mixes in a supernova cabinet, which I'd never seen that before. I always thought that was in its own cabinet. I wonder if somebody didn't just upgrade.

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:29.000
No, I think you can do the upgrade kits for those.

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:31.000
Can you? I didn't know that. Anyway.

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:36.000
And just know if you're buying the cabinet new, it's got all the fancy light bars and stuff, but I think you can still upgrade those.

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:43.000
Well, uh, our pal JD has been on the show before. I believe it's coming up. I think it's next weekend and I said, I'm going back.

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:47.000
So we're going to go back and check it out and play some more. So, uh, I'll let you know what happened.

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:51.000
I know JD is not afraid to play all those like dance games. He's got more stamina than I do.

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:57.000
So, uh, we'll get the lowdown on what's going on here locally on the next episode of OLR on the continuing saga.

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:00.000
Is that it for emails tonight, Dark Saga?

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:02.000
That's it.

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:08.000
All right. Thank you YYR for that email. Even if it was long, it definitely pretty well that answers all the questions I had. So there you go.

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:17.000
Um, I do want to quickly address Twitter. You know, I've been very bad about acknowledging Twitter on the show as of late, but I do want to mention some tweets that we got this week.

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:28.000
Uh, there was a tweet from at morning Wolf with an E on Twitter who said that regarding last week's show fun spot is completely worth a visit, but it is not a day trip.

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:40.000
We have great pics from 2001. Need to go back. Yeah. When I'm on the east coast this time, as much as I'd love to go to fun spot, I just, it's a little far off the beaten path, at least for where I'm going out there for me to really justify going.

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:52.000
But someday, someday I would really, um, like to see that. So, um, there you go. And then we have, um, yeah, that's it because the other one was from last week. So there you go.

02:08:53.000 --> 02:09:04.000
That's 200 masks says three hour drive from the beginning. Rob, we can do it. All right. Maybe, maybe we'll see. I still have to plan that trip. I'm still waiting for the official wedding invitation.

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:12.000
So I have to save the day, but not the wedding invite. So, uh, still, still a little ways to go though. That's still what, like almost six months out. So, all right.

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:18.000
Uh, let's move into some more news and then we'll get to your calls at Orange Laundrio on Skype, but first Loki.

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:31.000
All right. Um, so Google has acquired Alkemi Labs and they did, of course, a wonderful VR game that I like playing called Job Simulator.

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:45.000
So of course they both announced, um, both Alkemi and Google had posted their own announcements, um, which is interesting because you may remember, um, they also did, uh, the Rick and Morty virtual Rickality too.

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:59.000
So I'm wondering with all this stuff, maybe Google's going to start launching their own VR. I mean, they have like their like whole dream stuff, but I wonder if they're going to try to get into like, you know, PC VR as well.

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:02.000
The revenge of Google Glass.

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:18.000
Google Glass is just before it's time. That's all. Hey, you know what? Eventually I'm, I'm just waiting for, you know, cause VR is kind of taken off. I mean, it's still pretty early, but I'm waiting for when we get into the whole AR taking off as much as VR is right now.

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:25.000
So that's what I'm waiting for, which I'm probably, we're not going to wait much longer. Give it a few more years.

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:41.000
All right, let's move on and talk about Quake Champions. I want to check this game out actually. And, and I actually could because, uh, apparently this test, this large scale tech test actually started on Friday, May 12th. Oops, I've missed it.

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:51.000
But the good news is it's still going until Sunday, May 21st. There is no NDA with this beta. So go ahead and share the footage or opinion online all you want.

02:10:51.000 --> 02:11:02.000
Uh, so the beta is not just live during the weekend. It is going to be available through the entire duration of the test. Uh, there will be a new four versus four mode called Sacrifice that's available during the test.

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:11.000
And if you want to get in on this, you just go to quake.b Bethesda.net. That's the official Quake site. Put in your details and you will get a key that Bethesda says will come immediately.

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:21.000
It's going to be an eight gigabyte download. You do have to have the Bethesda launcher to play it because that's what we fucking need is another game company with their own launcher software.

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:32.000
Because we've got what? We've got Origin. We've got Uplay. We've got, anyway, the list goes on and on. Every company wants their own launcher, but fine. I guess there ain't anything in this world that's truly free.

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:36.000
So if you want to do Quake Champions, you got to get the Bethesda launcher. There you go.

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:44.000
Anybody else planning on checking you out? Just me? I want, if it's like as fast paced as the old school Quake games were, I think I'd be really into it.

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:57.000
So, I mean, I like Overwatch, but, and Overwatch isn't slow by any means, but I could just imagine like it would basically be like 200 CC mode on Overwatch. Like I'm all for that. So, all right, let's move on. Dark Sakura.

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:01.000
Oh yeah. How about Super Nintendo games?

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:19.000
There's going to be a Super Nintendo game coming out, Rob. A Super Famicom game, to be honest. Actually, it is a related to a Satellaview game that came out and they're going to be doing this as an anniversary celebration.

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:35.000
Basically, the game was called Kaizo Choujin Shibi- I'm going to butcher this- Shibi Binman Zero. It came out in 1997 and this cartridge is being released to commemorate the game's 20th anniversary.

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:53.000
And it will be for 6,998 yen, which is roughly 62 bucks and it goes on sale in June. And I remember a little bit of this game. I think I played like a ROM of it, but it's just a little platformer adventure game. It's cute and fun.

02:12:54.000 --> 02:13:02.000
And if you want to go out and buy a brand new Super Nintendo game, import it. I don't know how I feel about this.

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:11.000
I think it's great when people make these new games for old consoles. I don't think it's going to be particularly profitable, but that's not what this is about.

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:18.000
Well, it's more of a collector thing anyway. So, it's novel. I don't know. I kind of want it.

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:21.000
Will the cartridge be yellow to match my Super Nintendo?

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:23.000
No.

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:33.000
Because it should be. Actually, in all serieses, those cartridges don't have the same chemical in them, so they don't change color like your Super Nindennos do.

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:39.000
Well, this is also a Super Famicom cartridge, so it uses the lighter gray material and different texture.

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:43.000
And you have to have the little adapter thingy mabob. Or pull the tabs out or whatever it is.

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:45.000
Pull the tabs out.

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:49.000
Although, I used to play mine on a Game Genie.

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:54.000
Darted Studios has the same series as Shock Man on TurboGrafx-16, I do believe. Cool.

02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:59.000
Alright, just a few more stories for you guys, and then your calls at Orange Launch Radio on Skype. Loki?

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:03.000
Completely unaware that this was even going to be a thing, but apparently it is.

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:19.000
China. They have a Chinese company that's making a live action Contra movie. That's right. It's going to be, I guess, based off the original game. Read the synopsis.

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:31.000
In 1988, a huge meteorite lands on an uninhabited island in the South China Sea. Chen Quang and Li Xiong investigate but become empty-handed.

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:42.000
29 years later, Chen sends commandos Bill and Lance into a combat mission to neutralize the villainous Red Falcon organization, but end up facing a different enemy altogether.

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:48.000
Yes, I'm down. I mean, it doesn't really have anything in the little teaser other than their logo. I'm still down with that.

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:50.000
Why not? Why not? It's gonna be fucking awesome.

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:58.000
You know what? China ate up our Warcraft movie. Why not let the Chinese cinema community do a take on something?

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:07.000
I'm down with it. Contra's really cheesy anyways. There's no way you can make it bad. I mean, it really just goes with everything.

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:09.000
Just go for broke. Go for broke, yeah.

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:11.000
If you're going to make it bad, just make it really bad.

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:13.000
I'm totally down to see this whenever it comes out.

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:19.000
Dartusuya in chat says, I'm excited for this. It's going to be amazingly ridiculous and I'm okay with it.

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:23.000
Stoppy says, I think Contra movie was its own film genre back in the 80s.

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:27.000
SSG100Matt says, I'm looking forward to the riff tracks of this.

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:34.000
Well, apparently this mystery science theater revival, a lot of people are really loving. I haven't watched it yet.

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:40.000
I tried to watch part of it, but the problem is I don't have enough time to sit down and actually watch it without the kids going, it's my turn.

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:44.000
Like you just had your turn last like two years. So no.

02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:50.000
Yeah, shut up and watch what I'm watching. Those shows aren't dirty. Mystery Science Theater was never dirty.

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:57.000
I mean, maybe they have the dual level humor, but it's not going to hurt kids. So that's cool.

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.000
Did you ever get into Mystery Science Theater, Dark Sakura?

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:02.000
Yeah, I have the movie on laserdisc.

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:04.000
Okay. I thought this was the Eastman.

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:09.000
Okay. He came for the East to do battle with the amazing Rondo.

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:11.000
You haven't seen the new ones though?

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:13.000
No.

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:15.000
Oh, I just kind of surprised me. I would have thought you'd been all over that.

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:17.000
The movie was great.

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:19.000
The movie was great.

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:23.000
The one that was so boring that I couldn't watch it all in one sitting was Manos the Hands of Fate.

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:25.000
Oh God, I've fallen asleep through that several times.

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:30.000
It was the one that they apologized for making them watch because it was that bad.

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:38.000
And the one without waffles. I remember my friend Gwen who was playing Final Fantasy 14 with us, remember?

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:40.000
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:45.000
She came to visit and we were watching the episode where they were singing the waffle song.

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:49.000
So we left in the middle of the night to go to Walmart to buy waffles.

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
True story because that's all there is to do in Alabama.

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:55.000
I hope they actually tasted like waffles, unlike those waffle Oreos.

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:57.000
Fucking Eggos.

02:16:57.000 --> 02:17:02.000
Anyhow, lastly tonight, you know what they say y'all, hackers gonna hack.

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:07.000
This is more of a modders gonna mod type of situation though going on here.

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:09.000
And what is going on?

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:13.000
They have actually put Sonic into Mario Kart.

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.000
That's right, Sonic has made his debut in Mario Kart 8.

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:18.000
That's all through a mod.

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:20.000
Yes, that's how they've done it.

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:22.000
They've modded Sonic into Mario Kart 8.

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:24.000
There's actually a video out there where you can watch it.

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000
I'd play it for you but it's just all Mario Kart noises really.

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:28.000
It's just one of the things you have to see to believe.

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:32.000
So I'm sure they just probably took one of the other characters and like modified the skin.

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:34.000
But it looks really good.

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:38.000
And it does make me go, you know, Loki's gonna love this.

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:45.000
But you know, if they wanted to do more DLC for Mario Kart 8 now on the Switch,

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:49.000
a Sonic based thing would actually be kinda rad.

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:54.000
Now yes, I do know Sega has their own Sonic Racing All-Stars Transport with all that stuff.

02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:58.000
I know they have that and it's actually a fun series. It's a good series.

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:01.000
But we also haven't seen a game in that series in a while.

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000
It was a Wii U launch title and I think that's the last time we've seen it.

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:13.000
So maybe if Sega would let them do, can you imagine a Sonic course and some of the Sega characters?

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:15.000
You could have like, oh god, who would show up?

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:17.000
Probably Sonic of course.

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:21.000
Maybe they'd stretch and do like Ooh La La or something.

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:26.000
Maybe they can't do it anymore because if they put Sonic in the game, he has to have all his friends

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:29.000
and they really don't have space for like 60 more slots of characters.

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:34.000
Ooh, good point. ActDeft in chat says, there is the amiibo costume.

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:38.000
That's right, you can unlock a Sonic costume with the amiibo.

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:42.000
I forgot about that and I should have remembered because you can do a Mega Man costume too.

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:46.000
So that would be kind of fun for DLC if Nintendo wanted to go there.

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:49.000
I mean, again, would just blow your childhood mind.

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:54.000
The new Sega DLC coming to Nintendo is so weird, but I love it.

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:57.000
Is there something else you want to jump in there with, Logie?

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:00.000
No, I mean, it's just, I don't know.

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:03.000
Yeah, I mean, I guess they could do that.

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:07.000
I don't think they're going to do that because it's minimal effort.

02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:14.000
I don't know, never seen it. I think if they're going to do it, you're going to hear about it at E3.

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:20.000
And if you don't hear about it at E3, then they're probably moving on to cranking out other Wii U games,

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:24.000
much to Logie's excitement.

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:29.000
All right, well, that is it for our scheduled news tonight, but we're going to go ahead and open up the

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:33.000
Skype line right now over at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:36.000
If you want to give us a call and talk about, well, heck, anything we've been talking about tonight,

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:39.000
or maybe something different, let's get to it.

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:41.000
We've got a call coming in. We'll take it right now.

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:43.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:45.000
Hi, this is Ragingator.

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:47.000
Hey, buddy, what's on your mind tonight, Ragingator?

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:58.000
Excuse me. Since there's been news this week about Alienware being delisted everywhere

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:06.000
because of music licensing issues, I thought I would pose a rather timely question.

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:20.000
Now, all of us have been gamers for a while now, and that being said, we've probably played a ton of games over the years.

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:31.000
Has there been any games out there that have soundtracks that we particularly loved?

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:43.000
Either we listened to music directly through the game or the game came with the soundtrack that we listened to.

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:51.000
I got you. So, like, another game that relies on licensed music that we really love that we don't want to see suffer the same fate, maybe?

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:56.000
Yeah, well, not necessarily licensed music, you know, like you may add-ins or whatever.

02:20:57.000 --> 02:21:11.000
But let's say, for example, I've always loved two soundtracks, the soundtrack to Killer Instinct for the Super Nintendo.

02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:12.000
Good choice.

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:15.000
I played the soundtrack to that like crazy.

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:17.000
Killer Cuts.

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:31.000
Yeah, and although I never played the actual game itself, one soundtrack that I loved over the years was the soundtrack to Mr. Bones for the Sega Saturn.

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.000
Ooh, that's a deep cut. All right, all right.

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:45.000
Okay, so a game whose soundtrack you might not want to see kind of go down the same path or what you're worried about losing in the future.

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:53.000
Well, you know, currently what comes to mind, I just can't help but think of this game like jumps to my mind right away because it's something I've been playing recently.

02:21:54.000 --> 02:22:02.000
But Forza Horizon 3 has an awesome, like, licensed music that it uses and some really cool songs. I love the Pulse station in there, but there's some other good stuff too.

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:08.000
The one station that I don't think would ever shut down within Forza Horizon is the one that plays classical music all the time.

02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:17.000
But let me tell you, there is something to be said about racing to classical music everywhere, which in fact, since I'm going to be doing a livestream for Forza later on tonight,

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:24.000
I will probably do the classic music livestream in the game because it's the one thing that's not going to get my stream muted.

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:26.000
Oh, that you think of.

02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:34.000
Oh, yeah, maybe. Maybe it might. I don't know. Most of those songs are public domain, which is why it's very easy for them to create a radio station around it.

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:38.000
Doesn't Grand Theft Auto have a similar thing, like you go around killing people to classic music?

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:42.000
I think they had a classic station. I know Saints Row did.

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:49.000
Yeah, that's it. Saints Row had something like that. Well, that's another game that the soundtrack is pretty killer on.

02:22:49.000 --> 02:23:00.000
But of course, then there's also in my mind, I've got to go back to, of course, music-infused games and a lot of what this show is built on.

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:07.000
Things like DDR and Beatmania and even more so recently as Rock Band.

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:15.000
And we do see that Rock Band has had to put up with some of these issues where they have to delist songs after a certain amount of time because they can't renew the music licensing or what have you.

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:28.000
So, you know, music is so important on those games. Anything that comes to mind for you guys? Something that, you know, you wouldn't want to see suffer a similar fate to Alan Wake based on the music licensing?

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:32.000
Or some other type of strong, strong soundtrack?

02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:36.000
I mean, I don't know. I can't think of anything.

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:38.000
Not really.

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:46.000
Really? Almost anything Nintendo. I think a lot of Nintendo, a lot of Nintendo music really defines a lot of Nintendo games. But see, I mean, like,

02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:48.000
Those are all in-house for them.

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:50.000
Exactly, exactly.

02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:52.000
And that would be kind of karma, to be honest, but, you know.

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:58.000
Exactly. It's like, when I think about those, I think, like, well, that's never going to be a problem because Nintendo developed all that stuff in-house.

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:08.000
They own it. They're never going to pull the rug on that stuff. I can't help but only focus on, like, these license type of situations that are a little more vulnerable for those types of things.

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:14.000
All right. Well, RageNator, thank you for the question. I appreciate it. Oh, let me go to chat. There's some good answers here in chat.

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:23.000
Dartusuya says, Jet Set Radio. That's a very good one as well. Let's see, Fifth Dream does call out that Watch Dogs also uses the classical music station.

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:33.000
Act Def calls out Tyco no Tatujin, speaking of music-based video games. So, there you go. Some other answers as well, Spaznator.

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:44.000
Well, have a nice weekend and I'll probably speak to you guys either over Steam during the week or talk to you next week then.

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:46.000
Sounds good. You take care, all right?

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:48.000
Yep.

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:50.000
Bye.

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:58.000
All right. Let's see if we get any other phone calls over on our Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio.

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:09.000
1-877-GAME-OLR if you want to do it the old school way. But Orange Lounge Radio is the place to call on Skype. I think most people are using Skype these days.

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:16.000
You can also, of course, download Skype on your smartphone. So, it makes it really, really, really easy to give us a call.

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:23.000
Some late-breaking news they're talking about in our chat room right now. Apparently, Powers Booth has passed away.

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:31.000
He's recently in Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Although, I must admit, I had to look him up a little bit, but he was in the Sin City sequel as well.

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:37.000
He's one of those actors that I totally recognize him, but I don't think he's ever been the star of the movie.

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:43.000
But anyway, that is unfortunate. So, rest in peace there.

02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:53.000
Let's see. Sorry, Raginator, if I said the wrong name, but it is your current Skype handle there, so that's what threw me off there for a minute.

02:25:54.000 --> 02:26:01.000
Yeah, S.H.I.E.L.D. points out he was that prototypical bad guy and asshole dad in the 90s. Yes, that's true. That's very true.

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:11.000
All right. I'll take one more call for calls. Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype. Meanwhile, while we wait for anything to come in, I'll check in with Loki for possible last minute stories.

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:18.000
I don't really have anything. The only thing I have, there's a Kickstarter going on right now. They have 21 hours to go called Eagle Island that looks pretty awesome.

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:24.000
It's all pixelarty, so go check that out on Kickstarter. They have a demo you can try too, and it looks pretty fantastic.

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:28.000
Cool. And they've already hit their goal, but they can always use more money.

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:39.000
Of course. Who doesn't want more money? All right. Well, since our Skype line isn't lighting up, I am left to believe that Raginator was the only one that wanted a call, so I'm going to go ahead and close it up.

02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:49.000
But you can, of course, always email us at a later time. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com. You can also tweet us throughout the week as well. We do always like to read the tweets and hear your feedback.

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:59.000
At O-L-R on Twitter. Yes, we actually have a three-letter handle on Twitter, which is kind of shocking, but we got on Twitter really early, so I guess we were able to grab it.

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:05.000
At O-L-R. All righty. Well, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:12.000
We're going to wrap up for tonight. Go around to hear everybody's final thoughts, but of course, as first and always, I do want to thank you guys for listening to the show.

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:18.000
If you enjoyed Orange Lounge Radio, please help us spread the word. Tell a friend or five about the show. Heck, tell an enemy.

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:25.000
But we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we have to have the voices here in order to be able to air them, so we appreciate that.

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:36.000
So, yeah. Nice five-star review on a place like iTunes, Google Play, wherever it is you found this show. Those reviews go a long, long, long way. Let me tell you. Really appreciate it.

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:42.000
So, that's it for those plugs. So, let's go around and get everybody's final thought for the night.

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:52.000
I'll start. My final thought is my sinuses have been acting really bitchy. Like, I think I've developed allergies in the past year, and it sucks.

02:27:52.000 --> 02:28:00.000
But soup sounds really good. I want some soup. Yum. All right. Dark Soccer, you got the mic. Your final thought tonight?

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:05.000
I accidentally deleted everything in my inbox, but I'm kind of not mad about it.

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:07.000
Can you undelete?

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:11.000
I could go back in and recover what I want to, but again, I'm kind of not mad about it.

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:13.000
You just have to set it free.

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:21.000
I've already moved over, like, the biggest stuff that I do and look at, and I'm not going to empty out my trash for a while, so it'll be fine.

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:24.000
All right. Fair enough. And last but not least, Loki.

02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:29.000
Um, I don't know. Maybe I'll have to 3D print something this week.

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:33.000
Sounds like a good idea. And bring it to the show. I want to see what it looks like.

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:40.000
Yeah, I do need to set it up. I wanted to print you something for the Wii, or Wii U. Something for the Switch.

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:45.000
Because they've got, like, they've got stands for it and stuff so that you can still charge it.

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:47.000
Oh, like, better stands then?

02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:53.000
Like, you can still charge it. Like, if you've taken it to go, you can, so the kickstand, you can charge it that way. So they have those.

02:28:54.000 --> 02:29:02.000
They have, like, alternative, um, I don't know what you'd call them. Like, the thing that you strap the two ends to together to kind of make it one controller.

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:05.000
Oh, the, you know, the Joy-Con holder thing.

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:09.000
Yeah, whatever that's called. So they have, like, stuff you can make with those.

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:11.000
So, I don't know, maybe we can make a custom one of that or something.

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:13.000
That'd be fun.

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:20.000
Alright, well that's going to do it for another week of Orange Lounge Radio, but we will be back in seven days to talk about whatever comes up in gaming the next week.

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:25.000
Be nice to each other. Don't be jerks online. Unless the person really, really, really deserves it.

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:28.000
Alright, just kidding. Have fun gaming everybody. We'll see you next time in seven days. Bye.

02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:36.000
