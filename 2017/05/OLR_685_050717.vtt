Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio

00:39.000 --> 00:46.000

00:46.000 --> 00:51.000
My name is Rob Roberts, you might follow me on Twitter at Skie

00:51.000 --> 00:58.000
And I'm here with my co-host to talk to you about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle, and other stuff too

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
You know, tangents, 3 hour show, it happens

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
Say hello in studio to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Sup

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Hi, how are you, Jamie?

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
I'm tired

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
Yeah, you said you were up late last night

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
I was up to like 4.30 in the morning

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
Bow chicka wow, no I'm just kidding

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
No

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
It's nothing like that

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
You were playing, playing

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
I wasn't playing anything

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
You were just

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
Watching random stuff on YouTube

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
Oh, okay, okay, you fell down one of those

01:22.000 --> 01:28.000
I got caught in the trap and I was talking with my good friend and co-worker, James

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
Who is sometimes in the chat room and I hope soon tonight

01:31.000 --> 01:36.000
Well, speaking of other stuff, this is really funny, some of our listeners will get a kick out of this

01:36.000 --> 01:41.000
So, DarkSakura and I went to the same event last night in Sacramento

01:41.000 --> 01:46.000
We didn't go together because we planned it completely separately with two different groups of people

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
But, so here's the thing, so DarkSakura and I went to see Bianca Del Rio

01:50.000 --> 01:55.000
Which, if you follow Drag Race, which you may have caught that Jamie and I are a fan of

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Loki, not so much

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
Oh, hi by the way, Techmaster Loki, how are you doing?

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
Fine

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
Alright, you just sit there for a minute because we're going to talk Drag Race for a moment

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
But not a super long time, I promise

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
But Bianca Del Rio is one of the stars of Drag Race, was the winner of season 6

02:09.000 --> 02:14.000
So, but now, I mean honestly, I mean, however you feel about that show aside

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
I mean, she's really coming to her own as a stand-up comic who tours the country

02:18.000 --> 02:26.000
And she's also known for being a very, how would you say it, like, unpolitically correct or off, you know

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
She's like Lisa Lampanelli except she's funny

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
Yes, she's Lisa Lampanelli but funny

02:30.000 --> 02:35.000
But she's one of those like, there's like several disclaimers before you go to the show

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
Like, this is going to be offensive, you're going to be offended

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
So if you're here to like Tumblr police this show, get the f out

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
GTFO

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
Type of thing, yeah, basically

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
And don't bring your 9 month old baby

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
Although somebody did bring a baby

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
But we were just, ironically, we were both there

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
And I thought what was really funny, you were just sitting like two rows behind me

02:53.000 --> 02:58.000
Yeah, Becky and I were like on G or something and y'all were like, what, on D?

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
Yeah, yeah, we were in D

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
We won the D

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
Yeah, we got the D at the Bianca Del Rio show

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
But I just thought it was funny, yeah, you went with Becky, who's one of your besties

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
And I went with my old co-worker

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
Because, you know, I changed jobs a couple years ago

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
But I still, there's, believe it or not, there's some people I like that I hang out with during the day

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
And so she was one of them

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
And so, you know, she and I used to talk every week about Drag Race

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
So I know she was really excited to go

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
Cool

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
Yeah, we had a good time

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
Yeah, it was good

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
And then there was Froyo and that was awesome

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
Yes, and then Dark Soccer and I went to Froyo

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
And that was, that was, that was our night

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
Good time, no gaming involved

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
Which is where we talked about going to coin op here locally

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
It was loud and

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
Well, okay, here's the thing about the local joint

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
And, you know, I'm obviously going to talk local for a minute here

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
But no matter where you guys are in the country

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
There's definitely been like a renaissance of classic coin op gaming

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
And I think most big cities at this point have a barcade of some sort at this point, right?

03:56.000 --> 04:01.000
Where there's pinball machines and old arcade games plus alcohol

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
Which always makes for a good time, right?

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
So we have one in Sacramento and it's, it's a decent place

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
I'm glad it's here, I like it

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
But here's the weird thing about it for me

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
I don't, like there's just not a lot of stuff there

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
That I get really excited about

04:15.000 --> 04:20.000
Because a lot of it is the really cliche classic gaming

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
Like a Ms. Pac-Man machine

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
It's like, it's like all the, like a Donkey Kong machine

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
No, it's got other things

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
There's a six player X-Men

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
Right, and I'm not, again, I don't want to knock this place

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
Because I want to support local business

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
There's a Golden Axe

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
I'm glad something like it exists

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
But I will say, I will give the place props for this

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
Their pinball game is on point

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
They have a lot of, like I play more pinball

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
One of Dan's buddies owns those

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
Oh okay, well yeah, when I go there I play more pinball

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
Then I'm giving your buddy money

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
Because when I go there I play more pinball than anything else in the joint

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
So, but I mean they have like the new shit

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
Like I played some Batman

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
There's some Batman, the 60's Batman

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Yeah, that one's a new one

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
Back when it was awesome

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
There's, um

05:02.000 --> 05:06.000
The TV show, and then there was like an Aerosmith one that was really new too

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
I think the ACDC was there before

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
And the same guy owns the Wizard of Oz

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
And he had that there until people kept breaking it

05:13.000 --> 05:20.000
But there is, believe it or not, one of the SNK multi choice

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
And it's got a Blazing Star in it

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
Well that's cool

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
And that makes me super happy

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
Because what is my favorite shooter game next to R-Type?

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
Blazing Star

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
I would have thought it was a treasure game for sure

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
But that's alright

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Well, alright

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
Let's see, Vidpower in chat says

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
Does being drunk make you lose even faster in old coin-op games?

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
Yes, it does

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
Sometimes it makes you better

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
Yeah

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
Because sometimes, you know what alcohol focus is?

05:46.000 --> 05:51.000
Where you are just so blazed that you can like cut the rest of the universe out

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
Well blazed usually refers to something else

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
Well you know what I mean

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
I know what you mean

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
Blitzed I guess

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
Okay blitzed, yeah

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
Just so much on the sauce

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
That everything else falls behind you and you get hyper focused

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
Yeah, yeah, I've had those moments

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
That was the time I made it to like level fucking 29 on Luminess

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
While I was shit face drunk at my birthday

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
I think I did it on your PSP

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
I think you did

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
Yours or Wendell's

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
I think you did, yeah

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
At one of my birthday parties

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
But yeah, I mean, so we didn't end up going there

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
I mean, so I don't even know why I bring this up

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
But it's just one of those like, you know

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
It's cool that we have a place like that

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
But the magic's kind of worn off for me

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
But I do find, okay here's the thing though

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
I'm not, again, I'm really not trying to knock these places

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
I think it just depends on like what games and what presentation you have

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
Because I remember a place in Portland that I went to

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
Now granted, this was, this was when Alan and I were first dating

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
So it was like six years ago

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
So we went to Portland and we went to an arcade there

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
I had a lot of fun there

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
But that was like one of the first of those types of places that I went to

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
I didn't have anything in SAC or even the Bay Area at that time

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
Now San Francisco I think has a couple of these places too

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
There's one in the Castro, right?

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
Uh, I didn't see it in the Castro

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
There is, there is

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
It's on the edge of it

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
But it's, I can't remember the name of the place

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
JD's in chat, he'll know

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Yes, Brucade, thank you

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
Okay, yeah, we didn't go there when I was there on Wednesday

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
It's not like near the theater

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
It's in a different, it's like down market a little further

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
Ohhhhh

07:18.000 --> 07:22.000
It's closer to that music venue where we saw Frank music

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
And now I can't remember the name of it

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
It was like downstairs

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
Is it like just past the cafe?

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
The cafe?

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
It's past the cafe, yeah

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
Okay

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
Yeah

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
But now when I went we actually went to like a little Thai place

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
And then the GLBT museum was having a free day

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
So I went and kind of cried for a little bit

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
When I heard the Harvey Milk recording

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
The Living Will, the recorded Will

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
Oh

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
Because I had that as a recording there

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
I've never been there, I'd like to check that out

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
And then we went down to the mix, so

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
JD is in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
Because hello, chat, we do tape live every Sunday night

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
At the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
And JD in chat, who lives in San Francisco

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
That's why I knew he'd know this stuff

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
He says it's near Gateway

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
So, do you know, you know where that is, right?

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
Yeah, the gay jumbo's right next to it

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
Yes

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
So, alright, anyway

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
Yeah

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
Hurray, and all the people around the world

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
And other countries who are outside Northern California

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
Are like, wow, these places that I've never heard of

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
But again

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
Now you know

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
These barcades are showing up in a lot of different places

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
Let's see, in chat

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
I really liked round one, though

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
SSG100Matt says, when you come to New York, Rob

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
We can barcade Bar Hop

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
That would be awesome

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
I would really love to go, though, out there

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
I want to go to that Fun Spot place

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
Where all the, like, that's one of those

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
They don't have alcohol there, I don't think

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
But that's where, like, all the classic games are at

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
But I was looking, and it's kind of a hell of a deal

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
I don't think I could really get to Fun Spot when I'm out there

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
I am coming to New York this year, but I am going for a wedding

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
So, I can't do too much crazy stuff

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
Because the wedding's actually in Connecticut

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
But I'm trying to plan it where it's like

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
Well, maybe we'll have a fun day in New York

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
I feel like, if we're going to go to New York

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
Alan and I have to go to see something on Broadway

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
Like, how can you not?

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
But, I don't know, we'll see

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
We'll see

09:11.000 --> 09:15.000
Let's see, going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
Tigerclaw says

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
Wasn't Fun Spot the place where King of Kong was filmed?

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
Yeah, some of it

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
That's where most people know the place from

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
Fantaz in chat says

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
All the arcades closed down here in Canada

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
That's sad

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
Doesn't Canada like their arcades too?

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
Well, what part of Canada

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
I mean, Canada's a big place, yo

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
What part of Canada are you in?

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
Because I bet the big s-

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
I would be gasped, shocked

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
If, like, Toronto didn't have these things

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
But Toronto's one city in a big place

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
So, uh, you know

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
Let's see

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
Oh, Fantaz says I'm in Toronto

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
Wow, and they don't have-

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
There's gotta be something

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
I gotta ask my other buddies that live out there

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
If there's any place like that

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
There's gotta be something out there

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
Let's see

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
Shadeinator in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
Rob, speaking of arcades

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
Do you remember an old mechanical game involving clay pigeons

10:06.000 --> 10:10.000
Projected onto a screen and you shoot them with light guns that look like rifles

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
What was that called?

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
We had one at my arcade when I worked at the arcade

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
I remember that

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
Do you know how else I know that?

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
It was like clay shooting

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
I think it was just like clay pigeons or clay shooting

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
Yeah

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
Here, here's a tip for you

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
It's in the movie Karate Kid

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
Yeah

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
There's a montage

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
And they're at the arcade

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
And that is in the movie

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
Gotta have montage

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
That's right, there's a montage

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
So go watch

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Karate Kid's gotta be on Netflix or something, right?

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
Go watch it

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
And pause right there on that sequence

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
So there it is

10:41.000 --> 10:45.000
And JD found it, Clay Pigeon is the name of it

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
Yeah, we used to have all like the

10:47.000 --> 10:51.000
Okay, I lived in Alabama, they were the dirty rednecks

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
You know, wearing wife beaters

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
Stereotypes

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
Wife beaters and jeans and boots

10:55.000 --> 10:59.000
I'm not even joking because the stereotype exists for a reason

10:59.000 --> 11:05.000
Okay, we come in and like just be loud and raucous

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
And play the stupid gun game

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
And then leave it a mess

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
Let's see, going to a chat

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
Bobby Blackwolf using good old Yelp found 10 arcades in Toronto

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
That doesn't mean there are going to be 10 good arcades

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
But it sounds like there's some to choose from there

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
Yelp was a good idea though to find stuff there

11:24.000 --> 11:28.000
As studio 100 Matt suggests, you might have to go to Niagara Falls or something

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
Yeah, I wonder if those arcades

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
I'm not looking at the link right now

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
But I wonder if those arcades aren't like bowling alleys

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
But sometimes bowling alleys can have good arcades

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
You just have to experiment a little bit and look around

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
So, we'll see, we'll see

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
Alright, anyhow, let's see

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
Loki, how are you doing? I haven't heard a lot from you tonight

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
Have you been?

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
I'm fine

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
Yeah?

11:47.000 --> 11:51.000
Any progress on your new project, your authoring project this week

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
Or whatever it is you're working on?

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
I think I'm working on a new game

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
Oh yeah, I guess

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
Maybe you're not if you don't know what the fun is

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
No, I haven't made that much progress on it

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
In fact, actually, I was working on it last night

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
I literally fell asleep while working on it and woke up later on

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
I'm like, oh crap

12:07.000 --> 12:11.000
So, no, I haven't made a ton of progress on it yet

12:11.000 --> 12:15.000
It's still design phase, I guess

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
How about 3D printing?

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
I didn't really work on the 3D printing too much

12:22.000 --> 12:27.000
I did install the fan shroud I printed last week on it

12:27.000 --> 12:31.000
And I just need to solder the fan

12:31.000 --> 12:37.000
I need to extend the cords on it so that they can reach the board on the actual printer

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
So they can control the fan

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
So I started doing that last night

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
And then I haven't really bothered to print anything else yet

12:45.000 --> 12:50.000
Because I needed to get that done so I can reinstall the auto level on there

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
And then redo that because it's all jacked up

12:53.000 --> 12:57.000
Since I tore a hole in the top of my build plate

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
Or the little cup

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
There's like this surface that's on top of the aluminum plate

13:03.000 --> 13:07.000
So I tore a hole in that surface that's on there and covered it up with tape

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
And it works okay, I guess

13:09.000 --> 13:13.000
But I really do need to replace it with some tempered glass or something

13:13.000 --> 13:19.000
I just haven't gotten around to buying a piece of tempered glass to put on there

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
But soon, I mean, I still have been like

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
When are you printing my mini me?

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
Your mini you?

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
My mini me. Remember we were going to make an action figure of Rob Roberts

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
That came up on a previous OR

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
But I have to get a 3D model of you first

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
If I must

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
Alright

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
I did find, now this was cool

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
We're sending you 3D printers

13:40.000 --> 13:46.000
There's instructions on how to take your model out of World of Warcraft

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
Oh cool

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
And import it into a 3D printer

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
And it requires some tweaking to it

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
Because you have to change the type of polygon

13:55.000 --> 14:00.000
But they did really realistic, like someone did a full on Lich King

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
It was pretty cool

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
I remember back when we were doing Horde House

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
There was a service that came up on the show

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
Where they would like print, they would make statues

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
They still have that

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
Yeah, so I'm not too surprised the technology's out there

14:11.000 --> 14:15.000
But now it's probably more easier for you and I to get access to the 3D models

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
To do that kind of stuff, so yeah, pretty cool

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
Anyhow, it's a bit of a slower news week this week

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
We will get into the video game news and what's been going on here in a minute

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
After we do our gaming weeks

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
But obviously it's a little slower in the news cycle right now

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
We're less than a month away from E3

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
No, we're a month away from E3 at this point

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
When does it all start? June 9th?

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
June 10th

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
First press conferences are June 10th

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
It's like Saturday this year is when E3 starts

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
Yeah, there's EAs on Saturday

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
Microsoft and Bethesda on Sunday

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
Sony is at their usual time on Monday

14:47.000 --> 14:51.000
Ubisoft and Nintendo are assumed to be Monday as well

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
But who knows

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
We're gonna have a crazy June

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
Between the 15 years of OLR

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
And the E3 and all that stuff

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
It's gonna be a crazy June

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
Isn't that the week that we're out to?

15:01.000 --> 15:05.000
It's gonna be June 11th

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
June 11th is E3

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
June 18th is our 15th anniversary show

15:08.000 --> 15:12.000
June 25th is we're giving ourselves a week off

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
As a reward for doing the show for 15 years

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
Got it

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Because I'm going to Chicago

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
There it is

15:19.000 --> 15:23.000
So that's our June

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
It's gonna be a little bit crazy

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
Speaking of 15 years

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
I wanna make sure I got this out at some point during the show

15:27.000 --> 15:30.000
Because obviously we're coming up on the big 15

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
If you didn't already know, Orange Launch Radio started

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
Actually, technically as a station

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
It started in May of 2002

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
So we're in the 15 years right now

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
As a station we started in 2002

15:43.000 --> 15:47.000
Because originally we were a station on the Live 365 service

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
Which is no longer around

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
But that was where you could set up your own music thing

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
And we had DDR music and DanceMania soundtrack stuff

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
To differentiate ourselves from DDR Freak Radio

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
Which was also started around the same time

15:58.000 --> 16:02.000
But then the idea was that the centerpiece of Orange Launch Radio

16:02.000 --> 16:06.000
The network was Orange Launch Radio Live

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
The show

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
Which is this now, 15 years later

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
Now that podcasting is a thing

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
Now that Live 365 is gone

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
And we moved to all games

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
Moved to VOG Network and all that

16:16.000 --> 16:20.000
But, you know, 2002

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
When this show started

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
Was really kind of like a peak of music gaming in a way

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
Like I know, I know

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
There was other peaks obviously as well

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
Rock band, Guitar Hero 2 and all that stuff that came later

16:30.000 --> 16:33.000
But the reason why I say that is that I came across

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
Something today that mentioned that

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
In the music gaming world

16:37.000 --> 16:41.000
A website turned 15 years old this month as well

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
Bamani style turned 15 this month

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
And, you know, we've had Eddie who started it

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
He was on the show probably a long time ago talking about it

16:48.000 --> 16:52.000
I think he was here around the time they did a big relaunch

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
I think he was here

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
But I was, you know, reading up on the site

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
And I was just going like, wow, memories

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
This has been 15 years

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
It's been a long time since some of this stuff

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
And just, yeah

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
So I just wanted to acknowledge their anniversary as well

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
Give them props

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
I know they've kind of

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
They've gone through their own transformations

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
It used to be a place where people would look at like sim files

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
Like that was their big thing

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
And now they're, you know, they can't really do that anymore

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
So they have more like, you know, what's going on in music gaming news and so forth

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
So we've transformed

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
They've transformed

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
You know, you don't usually go 15 years

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
Being the exact same thing you were in the beginning

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
So, you know, just props to them

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
And we're all getting old

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
Crazy stuff

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
SSU100Matt says, shit, I feel old

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
I remember checking Bamante's style every day

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
Well, you could be doing that right now

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
They are still around

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
They're celebrating a birthday

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
So they're still doing their thing

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
It's just different than what it was in the beginning

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
You know, so

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
They just do a lot more news about, you know, the newer music games

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
Because there's still a lot

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
I'm gonna talk about my gaming week here in a moment

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
I've been playing some new music games

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
And I was kind of shocked

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
What I found here locally

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
So I'm gonna talk about that in just a minute

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
When we get to our gaming weeks

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
vidpower points out ddrfreak for ddr forums

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
Bamante's style for all other

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
Bamante game forums

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
Yeah, for sure

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
Totally

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
So, yeah

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
Congrats and happy anniversary to Bamante's style

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
So

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
One thing I wanted to ask about here at the top of the show

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
Before we get into our gaming weeks

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
What we have been playing this week

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
I just wanna ask you guys a little bit about

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
What haven't you been playing this week

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
Because, again, it's a slower time of year

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
There hasn't been as many game releases

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
I know we have Mario Kart 8, we've had a few big ones

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
But, um, what's your backlog

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
In gaming look like right now

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
What are the games you need to make it a point

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
To finish

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
Before things get crazy

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
Come September, October, November

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
What are, like, the biggest priorities

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
You're laughing at me, Loki

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
The joke is obvious

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
Your backlog is like 500 games

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
I'm sure

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
What are the biggest things

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
You're like, I need to get this done before

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
Even more shit comes out

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
To pile up the backlog

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
Since I'm just gonna steal the joke right here

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
The obvious answer would be my game

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
Okay, fair enough

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
I wasn't even coming for you

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
With that question

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
Okay, sure, fair enough

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
God, there's so many things

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
I have, I mean, even just strictly

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
PlayStation

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
I have a finished

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
Watch Dogs 2, Final Fantasy

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
15, um

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
Hell, there's so many games

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
I haven't even started yet that I have

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
Like Dragon Age Inquisition

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
Both Wolfenstein games

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
Crap, I don't know, there's like a ton of games

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
I have the original Watch Dogs 2 that I've never

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
Played, it's on a disc and never played

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
I have Destiny that I've never touched

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
How do you pick what you're gonna do first?

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
I usually

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
Buy something new

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
So in other words

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
You're full on admitting these games are never

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
Gonna get touched because I'm gonna end up buying something new

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
And it's just added to the mountain of games

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
Pretty much, yeah, I mean

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
There's uh

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
I don't know

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
There's a lot of stuff

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
My PlayStation 4 backlog is starting to

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
Look as bad as my

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
Steam backlog

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
DarkSakura, what about you?

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
I don't know if it's fair to say you're a little more

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
Pinky-choosey when it comes to games, but

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
Is your backlog as horrific as Loki's?

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
Danganronpa 2

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
I thought you already beat that

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
No, I'm almost done with it, but I put it off

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
To play other things

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
I still want to finish Ultra Despair Girls

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
They've just been on the back burner since

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
I was playing a couple other things

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
And right now

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
I'm playing stuff, but kind of taking a bit of a break

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
Just for

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
No mental recharge, I've got

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
A few other projects that have fallen on the side

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
That have fallen

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
On the side

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
Sorry, my voice went out

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
That's okay, it went into 911 operator

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
It went into 900 number operator mode for a minute there

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
Pick up the phone

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
Let's look at chat

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
Over at live.vognetwork.com

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
I'd like to hear from you guys as well

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
Stoppy says still haven't played through Hitman

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
Ugh, Lady JJ says

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
Tomb Raider Anthology on Mac

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
Rise of the Tomb Raider is still in my backlog

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
So that's a big one actually

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
Uh, Lissy Darktitsia says

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
I was in the middle of Jet Set Radio and Nights

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
On Steam

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
Stoppy says Mad Max I have for PS4

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
And I haven't touched it in months

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
Oh, Grand Theft Auto 5

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
There's another one on Grand Theft Auto Online

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
In my backlog Grand Theft Auto 5 for sure

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
Yeah, and Fallout 4

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
Well, at least I played a little bit of Fallout 4

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
Fallout 4 would also be in mine too

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
Because I never finished that

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
Yeah, no, I need to finish it

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
But, uh, yeah, I'm just, I'm horrible

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
At the Fallout games

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
But, yeah, I need to play that

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
But Grand Theft Auto 5 is definitely still there

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
Uh, yeah

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
Actdeftinchat says still haven't played Forza Horizon 3

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
Yes, we heard a little bit about that on Bobby's show tonight

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
But yes, Forza is in my backlog too

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
Uh, other big stuff in my backlog

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
Um, Zelda Breath of the Wild

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
I need to finish

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
I need to finish that, like, I was really into it

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
And then I, I

22:11.000 --> 22:14.000
I don't know what happened, I felt like I was doing something wrong

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
But I really need to realize

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
In that game you can't do things wrong

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
Like, you can do whatever you want when you want

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
And I just have to get my mind out of that place

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
And I'll be able to go back and do it

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
Um, here's one that might kind of surprise you guys

22:26.000 --> 22:29.000
Uh, Mass Effect Andromeda is in my backlog right now

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
I kind of stopped playing it

22:31.000 --> 22:38.000
Um, when a lot of the talk about patching and changes and all that stuff was going on

22:38.000 --> 22:41.000
I kind of painted myself in a corner in that game too

22:41.000 --> 22:44.000
Because I felt like I screwed myself

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
And I'm not able to do the loyalty missions

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
Even though I'm close to the end of the game

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
So in my mind, whether this is logical or not

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
This is where my mind's going

22:54.000 --> 22:57.000
My mind says the only way to fix this, Rob, is to start all over

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
And then couple that with

22:59.000 --> 23:02.000
I had a really bad multiplayer experience

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
Because of fucking Origin

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
Where we got kicked from a match like seconds before the end of the match

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
And we'd used consumables and all this stuff too

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
Like, I got really frustrated

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
I was just like, fuck this game

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
And I just, I kind of walked away from it for a little while

23:13.000 --> 23:18.000
And in reality, I still think Mass Effect Andromeda is a great game

23:18.000 --> 23:21.000
And I need to just get over that kind of mental hump and go finish it

23:21.000 --> 23:26.000
But then, you know, I get sucked into a good old thing like 14

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
Or Diablo 3 now

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
I've been actively trying to hunt down this platinum trophy

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
And it's like, that's great

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
But it's keeping me from playing all of these other games

23:34.000 --> 23:38.000
So my backlog over there is just growing as well

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
What can I say? Let's see

23:40.000 --> 23:44.000
VidPowerInChat over at live.vognetwork.com says

23:44.000 --> 23:50.000
Pro tip, treat your backlog as more of an all-you-can-play buffet

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
Instead of a checklist

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
It's way less stressful this way

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
I like that, an all-you-can-play buffet

23:56.000 --> 24:00.000
That's what PlayStation Now should be trying to brand its service as

24:01.000 --> 24:04.000
Well I keep wanting to play Minecraft on my laptop

24:04.000 --> 24:08.000
But apparently something corrupted my profile

24:08.000 --> 24:15.000
And so it doesn't authenticate with Microsoft servers or something stupid like that

24:15.000 --> 24:19.000
So I haven't purchased, technically twice, thank you Microsoft

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
And I can't download it

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
Because they're stupid

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
Alright, enough about backlogs

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
Let's talk about the current stuff

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
The types of video games that you've been playing this week

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
What have you been playing in a segment?

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
How was your gaming week?

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?

24:38.000 --> 24:41.000
Like I was saying, it hasn't been super eventful

24:41.000 --> 24:45.000
But I've been playing some World of Warcraft and Mass Effect Andromeda

24:45.000 --> 24:48.000
Not really too many other things

24:48.000 --> 24:52.000
Except we did, well Dan actually repaired my old ColecoVision

24:52.000 --> 24:56.000
And so there was some Mr. Do happening in Donkey Kong

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
Mr. Do is an underrated 80s classic

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
Fucking love Mr. Do

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
Yeah Mr. Do is a fucking rad game

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
It's like Dig Dug but not

25:04.000 --> 25:08.000
And people don't seem to realize just how good the ColecoVision was for its time

25:08.000 --> 25:13.000
It was kind of a powerhouse for itself

25:13.000 --> 25:16.000
And you had really some of the best arcade versions at home

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
Short of having it on the computer versions

25:18.000 --> 25:23.000
So it was really, except the controller is kind of shit

25:23.000 --> 25:27.000
Man, is there a way to play Mr. Do legally on a modern console?

25:27.000 --> 25:31.000
Like was it in any of those arcade repackaging things?

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
I don't think so

25:33.000 --> 25:36.000
That's a classic I'd like to play again

25:36.000 --> 25:40.000
But anyway, sorry Dark Soccer but I couldn't help but wonder that

25:40.000 --> 25:44.000
Well and then of course Pokemon Go and Miitomo

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
Which actually I forgot to try today

25:46.000 --> 25:49.000
So that's what I'm playing

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
For now

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
Awesome, we'll get to Loki in a minute

25:53.000 --> 25:57.000
Oh is that that arcade Internet Archives thing?

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
Yeah it is, the latest thing they had in there

25:59.000 --> 26:02.000
It was on the Wii Virtual Console in Japan

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
Why did Japan get all the good stuff?

26:04.000 --> 26:07.000
Oh I forgot there was a Neo Geo version at one point too

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
There's Neo Mr. Do

26:09.000 --> 26:10.000
Yes there is

26:10.000 --> 26:13.000
That is kind of a different game though if you think about it

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
It is, it looks absolutely different

26:15.000 --> 26:19.000
So wow, they didn't put it in any of those like the arcade classic

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
Yeah I guess not, interesting alright

26:21.000 --> 26:25.000
Random 80s arcade game that I want to play again

26:25.000 --> 26:28.000
Anyway, how about you Loki?

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
I didn't play a whole lot

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
It's just pretty much what's on my phone

26:32.000 --> 26:36.000
Because I've been purposely avoiding playing games on consoles and stuff

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
Because I wanted to work on my games

26:38.000 --> 26:42.000
Sort of happened and sorted it

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
I was just really tired this week

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
So like every time I sat down to work on it

26:47.000 --> 26:51.000
You have to have more mental capacity than I had at the time

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
To actually be able to program stuff

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
So it was kind of annoying

26:54.000 --> 26:59.000
But I did play more of that Office Space idle clicker game thing

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
Which is actually, it's kind of

27:01.000 --> 27:04.000
It's entertaining because they do these like weekly challenge things

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
So it kind of mixes up the game almost every week

27:07.000 --> 27:10.000
And so you can play that on top of your normal game as well

27:10.000 --> 27:14.000
And it unlocks more of the consumable things that they have in the game

27:14.000 --> 27:17.000
So you don't really have to spend real money on it

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
To kind of earn those things

27:18.000 --> 27:21.000
And I kind of like that because it gives me a point to play it

27:21.000 --> 27:24.000
Because there's actually a little bit of a challenge to try to unlock those things

27:24.000 --> 27:33.000
So I don't find it as kind of like throwing the ads or consumables in your face

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
As much as some of the other games did

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
I mean they still have you watch a lot of ads

27:37.000 --> 27:40.000
But usually it's just kind of whatever

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
Although there is an ad on there

27:42.000 --> 27:43.000
Which I might mention

27:43.000 --> 27:46.000
For like some mobile game that has like Pokemon in it and stuff

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
It's not Pokemon Go

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
It's like something I'm like

27:49.000 --> 27:53.000
How is this not violating like IP left and fucking right

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
And they're advertising it in another game

27:55.000 --> 27:58.000
It's not the official match 3 game that Pokemon has

27:58.000 --> 27:59.000
Pokemon

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
I forget the name of it

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
There's another Pokemon game

28:03.000 --> 28:06.000
It's not from like Nintendo or from the Pokemon company or something

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
It's from some other company I've never heard of

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
Thank you guys, Pokemon Shuffle says chat

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
No it's not Pokemon Shuffle at all

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
It's like some other thing

28:13.000 --> 28:16.000
And it's like the actual title of the game

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
It sounds like a knock off

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
So I'm like

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
How the fuck

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
Like how fucking ballsy must you be

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
To literally advertise this game

28:23.000 --> 28:26.000
With like violating copyright all over the place

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
In another game

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
I mean on Google services

28:29.000 --> 28:32.000
Come on Google like wake up

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
So that was kind of interesting

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
And then the other thing I play of course is Pokemon Go

28:36.000 --> 28:39.000
A little bit because they're doing that whole grass type event or whatever

28:39.000 --> 28:42.000
So I've been trying to level up my grass type Pokemon

28:42.000 --> 28:46.000
Shit I don't fucking see Bulbasaur anywhere normally

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
And now he's just like fucking all over the place

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
Like I literally was walking through

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
I haven't seen a one

28:50.000 --> 28:51.000
A Bulbasaur

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
I'm seeing more

28:52.000 --> 28:53.000
They're all over the place

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
Like I caught like 5 the other edges of the outlets

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
Just like in like 5 minutes

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
I'm seeing more Chikorita than I am Bulbasaur

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
Yeah

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
Myself

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
Yeah

29:01.000 --> 29:02.000
But yeah that's what I've been doing

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
So just a little bit of that

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
I mean it's entertaining enough

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
I don't really

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
Like I'm not going hardcore into the game

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
I just more of like play it once a day

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
You know to get my daily stuff

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
And then that's it

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
But yeah I mean

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
I don't know

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
I look at games kind of

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
It's entertaining for what it is

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
I mean that's fine

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
I'm enjoying it

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
Not being sucked in like

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
I've got to play it like the other ones

29:25.000 --> 29:26.000
It's more of like

29:26.000 --> 29:27.000
Okay I got like 5 minutes

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
Let me just do this real quick

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
And then that's that

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
Yeah I mean

29:31.000 --> 29:34.000
You know I've been playing Ingress myself this week

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
Which I know is the other game you're referring to

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
But I've tried to take a little bit more

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
Relaxed approach to Ingress

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
Turning off notifications

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
And that game was the best thing I could do

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
Possibly for just my own like

29:42.000 --> 29:45.000
Just not getting so sucked into it or whatever

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
But you know funny enough

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
They're doing an event in Pokemon Go

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
But they're also doing one in Ingress right now

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
They just started

29:51.000 --> 29:52.000
So it's like Niantic

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
Didn't really think this through for their servers

29:54.000 --> 29:57.000
Because like the Ingress ones have been hurting

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
Like the game's been running really slow

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
Like when you try to deploy resonators

30:00.000 --> 30:03.000
Like it's slow because the event is about

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
Deploying resonators

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
And they have a big

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
They have a special badge in the game right now

30:06.000 --> 30:07.000
For resonator deploys

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
So it was funny to me that Niantic's running

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
Two different events at the same time

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
Now granted I'm sure the Pokemon Go and Ingress

30:13.000 --> 30:14.000
Run on completely different servers and stuff

30:14.000 --> 30:17.000
But still, still like it just seems like

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
Wow there's a lot happening right now

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
So anyway

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
Yeah

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
Okay so my gaming week since I started there

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
Let me talk about some other stuff

30:25.000 --> 30:29.000
Okay so I didn't talk about this last week

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
I wanted to talk about this game last week

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
But we were a little pressed for time last week

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
Because we had an interview which was awesome

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
But I had to kind of roll this talk to this week

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
So there's a newer game out on PlayStation 4

30:39.000 --> 30:42.000
That I played and I beat in the past week

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
Because this is one of those games

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
That's only gonna take you about three hours to beat

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
But it was a great three hours

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
The game is called What Remains of Edith Finch

30:49.000 --> 30:54.000
So this is one of those walking simulator games

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
Although you know I hate that label

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
But everybody knows what I'm talking about

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
When I say that

30:58.000 --> 31:02.000
I say more interactive story is what it really is

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
But if you haven't read much about it

31:04.000 --> 31:08.000
It's basically about a girl that returns to a house in her family

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
And as she goes through the house she kind of learns the secrets

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
Or the stories about her family

31:12.000 --> 31:15.000
And we'll leave it at that because I want to keep it relatively spoiler free

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
So like Gone Home it sounds like?

31:17.000 --> 31:18.000
Not at all

31:18.000 --> 31:21.000
Well no the story is nothing like Gone Home actually

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
The story is nothing like it

31:23.000 --> 31:26.000
But the gameplay is a little bit like it

31:26.000 --> 31:29.000
But here's the thing about Edith Finch

31:29.000 --> 31:32.000
And again I'm really trying to keep this very spoiler free

31:33.000 --> 31:36.000
There are sections of Edith Finch

31:36.000 --> 31:39.000
Where I feel like there was more game to it

31:39.000 --> 31:42.000
Like there was like a segment where you had to

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
Catch two things

31:44.000 --> 31:47.000
Or you have to like go through the sequence again

31:47.000 --> 31:50.000
So there were some more like arcadey type of sequences in it

31:50.000 --> 31:53.000
Where you know Gone Home didn't really have any of that

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
So I do feel like even though

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
A lot of people are gonna write this game off as

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
Oh it's another one of those

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
There's no fucking game here

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
You just watch a story unfold in front of you

32:02.000 --> 32:05.000
I do feel like Edith Finch is taking another step forward

32:05.000 --> 32:08.000
In the genre to try to bring

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
Walking simulators and interactive stories

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
Forward a little more into

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
You know being the types of video games that

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
You know a lot of people think of when they think of video games

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
But I will say this as well

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
The story was very affecting

32:20.000 --> 32:21.000
And there was some

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
There was some quite frankly like

32:23.000 --> 32:26.000
Disturbing and difficult sequences to watch in the game

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
And again I'm trying to keep it spoiler free but there's just you know

32:29.000 --> 32:32.000
There's some heavy stuff in the game

32:32.000 --> 32:35.000
And so I kind of wasn't prepared for it

32:35.000 --> 32:36.000
Like there was definitely a sequence

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
That like once it was over

32:38.000 --> 32:39.000
And if you guys have played through the game

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
You're gonna know exactly what I'm fucking talking about

32:41.000 --> 32:44.000
But I will say it is the

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
The

32:46.000 --> 32:49.000
How do I say this without fucking ruining it

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
The bathtub sequence I'll leave it at that

32:51.000 --> 32:55.000
So after that I had to just fucking like

32:55.000 --> 32:56.000
I need a break

32:56.000 --> 32:59.000
I need a break that was heavy

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
But the fact that a video game can kind of affect you like that

33:01.000 --> 33:04.000
I think is you know says a lot about the game as well

33:04.000 --> 33:07.000
And I did you know I was

33:07.000 --> 33:10.000
I was satisfied with the resolution of the story

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
It has kind of a weird ending

33:12.000 --> 33:15.000
And I will say that I saw the ending coming

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
About halfway through the game

33:17.000 --> 33:20.000
But I was still okay with the journey to get there

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
So that's what I

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
Yeah that's what I liked

33:23.000 --> 33:26.000
I overall it was you know a great experience

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
I really like these types of games

33:28.000 --> 33:32.000
Especially you know as maybe I don't have the attention span

33:32.000 --> 33:33.000
For video games that I used to

33:33.000 --> 33:37.000
I really like these games that I can kind of like start and beat within a day

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
And I feel like it's really fulfilling

33:39.000 --> 33:42.000
I think the trickiest part about this game

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
Is going to be that $20 price tag

33:44.000 --> 33:47.000
After I just told you you're gonna beat it in three hours

33:47.000 --> 33:51.000
And although you can replay sequences

33:51.000 --> 33:55.000
I'm not sure there's a ton of replayability in a game like this

33:55.000 --> 33:59.000
I mean maybe if you were into speed running it or something

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
There might be a little more in it for you

34:01.000 --> 34:04.000
But I really think this is kind of a one and done type of video game

34:04.000 --> 34:07.000
And so the $20 price tag may be a tough sell

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
Now that being said

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
Some of y'all have no problem

34:11.000 --> 34:15.000
Buying a movie for 25, 30 bucks on blu-ray

34:15.000 --> 34:18.000
Watching it one time and then putting it in your shelf somewhere

34:18.000 --> 34:21.000
So on one hand

34:21.000 --> 34:25.000
I kind of don't understand why people get really frustrated

34:25.000 --> 34:28.000
With the price tags on video games

34:28.000 --> 34:31.000
When it's really no different when it comes to movies

34:31.000 --> 34:32.000
But on the other hand

34:32.000 --> 34:36.000
Sure I mean there's so much variance when it comes to video game prices

34:36.000 --> 34:40.000
That there are other games you could be spending $5, $10 on

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
That will give you hours and hours of enjoyment

34:42.000 --> 34:46.000
It might be tough to convince you that $20 is worth it for three hours of this

34:46.000 --> 34:49.000
That being said there probably will be a sale at some point

34:49.000 --> 34:52.000
So maybe some of y'all will just hold out for the sale

34:52.000 --> 34:55.000
But I think the game is definitely worth your time

34:55.000 --> 34:58.000
And it was a story I enjoyed going through

34:58.000 --> 35:02.000
Let's see go into our chat over at live.vognetwork.com

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
Rama in chat says beat in three hours

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
What about Final Fantasy Mystic Quest?

35:06.000 --> 35:09.000
I don't remember that game taking only three hours

35:09.000 --> 35:12.000
But the last time I played it I was like 12 or 13

35:12.000 --> 35:17.000
So Dark Soccer do you remember how long was Mystic Quest of a game?

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
It's got to be more than three hours

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
It wasn't that long though

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
No it wasn't like a typical Final Fantasy

35:23.000 --> 35:24.000
It wasn't really a Final Fantasy game

35:24.000 --> 35:25.000
It really wasn't

35:25.000 --> 35:28.000
It was Final Fantasy USA is what they released it as over series

35:28.000 --> 35:31.000
Yeah I don't remember offhand what the original was

35:31.000 --> 35:32.000
I'd have to look back up

35:32.000 --> 35:36.000
But it was definitely RPG for small children

35:37.000 --> 35:40.000
One other quick thing I want to say about Edith Finch

35:40.000 --> 35:45.000
Is that I really loved some of the style that some of the stories were told through

35:45.000 --> 35:50.000
Like Jamie I really think this might be a game you'd be into for some of the style

35:50.000 --> 35:51.000
Some of that

35:51.000 --> 35:55.000
I think some of the artistic direction in the game I think you'd be a big fan of

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
So it might be you know again it's 20 bucks

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
But when there's a sale or something you know I think it's worth

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
I don't know if it's on PC

36:01.000 --> 36:02.000
I think it is

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
I don't think it's on Xbox it's only on PlayStation

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
But I think I heard it was on PC as well

36:06.000 --> 36:09.000
Maybe somebody in our chat knows over at live.vognetwork.com

36:09.000 --> 36:13.000
Bobby Blackwolf says Mystic Quest is a 12 to 15 hour game

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
Yeah I was going to guess it was more like 10

36:15.000 --> 36:18.000
So yeah 12 to 15 sounds a little more right

36:19.000 --> 36:24.000
Act Def points out I paid 40 dollars for Portal because of the orange box

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
And I can beat that game in an hour

36:26.000 --> 36:30.000
I think Portal has a lot of replayability value to it though

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
At least I think so

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
You would agree with that though right Dark Soccer

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
That Portal has a lot of replayability to it

36:35.000 --> 36:36.000
I mean yes

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
You know the answers to the puzzles and everything

36:38.000 --> 36:42.000
But it's also one of those games where there's kind of more than one way to do it

36:42.000 --> 36:43.000
Yeah

36:43.000 --> 36:46.000
And you know just the story is really good in that game too

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
And there's also finding the secrets

36:48.000 --> 36:49.000
Yes that's true

36:49.000 --> 36:50.000
And in Portal 2 there's certainly a lot more

36:50.000 --> 36:51.000
That's true

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
Alright so other games I've been playing this week

36:53.000 --> 36:56.000
I've been playing a little bit of Heroes of the Storm

36:56.000 --> 37:01.000
Which is Blizzard's Dota-esque or League of Legends-esque type of game

37:01.000 --> 37:05.000
And obviously the reason I've been playing it if you follow Blizzard games at all

37:05.000 --> 37:08.000
You can get Overwatch stuff right now by playing Heroes of the Storm

37:08.000 --> 37:11.000
So there's a little group of us people that you sometimes hear on OLR

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
Like myself, Shane, Flaco Jones

37:13.000 --> 37:17.000
And we've been playing Heroes of the Storm because if you play with friends

37:17.000 --> 37:21.000
You unlock things in Overwatch

37:21.000 --> 37:24.000
So the first week you just played five matches with a friend

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
And you got like a new Genji skin that was really cool

37:26.000 --> 37:27.000
And you got some unlocks

37:27.000 --> 37:30.000
And that was really easy because we just played against AI

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
And it was okay cool we did this

37:32.000 --> 37:36.000
Well Blizzard said for weeks two, three, and four

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
You can no longer play against AI

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
You have to play against real people

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
And we were like ugh

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
The people in this game can be so toxic

37:44.000 --> 37:47.000
But whatever we're just gonna suck it up and play

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
So we did

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
And actually we won

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
Like Shane and I played our last two games

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
Or my last two games last night

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
And we won both games

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
So I was like woohoo we can actually do this

37:59.000 --> 38:02.000
But I think it's because there's a lot of other people who don't play Heroes of the Storm a lot

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
That are playing now to get the unlocks

38:04.000 --> 38:07.000
So you kind of have like a lot of baddies playing the game right now

38:07.000 --> 38:10.000
I do wish they didn't force you to play against other people though

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
Because I've also seen the side of this where

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
People are just teaming up in groups of five

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
And then letting the other team win

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
Like they're just we're just gonna hang at base

38:18.000 --> 38:19.000
And you guys can just steamroll

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
We just won our D.Va skin

38:21.000 --> 38:25.000
Because they have the whole South Korean police officer garb thing that D.Va can get

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
And her mech has a police siren on it and all this stuff

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
It's cute and if you're a D.Va player

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
Which you know she's awesome in Overwatch

38:31.000 --> 38:32.000
You want this skin

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
So a lot of people play for that

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
And then week four is gonna be ten loot boxes

38:36.000 --> 38:41.000
So I do kind of wish they would just let people get it from AI matches

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
Because you're gonna end up playing the game either way

38:43.000 --> 38:46.000
So you're downloading it and you get those play stats on Blizzard

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
Which is what they want to go for

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
But you're not like forced to play with other people

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
And I just

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
You know I don't have a problem doing it

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
I'm not afraid of other people

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
Like you know oh darn we lost a match

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
I don't give a fuck we still get our skin

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
And if somebody is abusive to me

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
Blocked like it's not that hard

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
Blocked reported easy to do

39:06.000 --> 39:09.000
And I have like low tolerance for that shit in those games

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
Like if somebody says something nasty

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
Blocked I just don't even acknowledge it or anything

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
I just block them

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
But I just

39:17.000 --> 39:20.000
Let the nasty people all play their game together or whatever

39:20.000 --> 39:24.000
And just let the people who want to steamroll for the skin just play AI or something

39:24.000 --> 39:25.000
I don't know

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
Make them do AI on medium mode or something

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
I don't know what it is

39:29.000 --> 39:32.000
Yeah actdeftinchat says good thing you only have to play not win

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
I really hope weeks 3 and 4

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
Blizzard's solution for this better not be

39:36.000 --> 39:39.000
You have to win the matches now in order to get it

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
Because

39:42.000 --> 39:43.000
That's just gonna be a fucking mess

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
People will figure out how to win trade

39:45.000 --> 39:46.000
Mark my words

39:46.000 --> 39:47.000
They're gonna win trade

39:47.000 --> 39:50.000
And it's just gonna be bad for the Heroes of the Storm community if they do that

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
So I really hope they don't do that

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
And one other thing I want to talk about

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
So

39:57.000 --> 40:03.000
Yesterday my pal Shane and I went to an arcade here in the area

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
It was the bowling alley out in Rockland

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
You guys know that place?

40:07.000 --> 40:11.000
So that place has an arcade machine called Neon FM

40:11.000 --> 40:15.000
Which speaking of this show being 15 years old

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
And Mamani style being 15 years old

40:17.000 --> 40:20.000
I feel like development on that game started 15 years ago

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
Because I remember when that was gonna be a dance game

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
Remember that?

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
But the controller looked like Beatmania

40:26.000 --> 40:27.000
But it was a dance pad

40:27.000 --> 40:28.000
Girls Butts

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
Yes and there was the infamous Girls Butts song

40:30.000 --> 40:31.000
Which is still there

40:31.000 --> 40:32.000
And I refuse to play it

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
Because it's banned from my life

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
But that song aside

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
There's a lot of great songs in the game

40:38.000 --> 40:39.000
There really are

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
If you're okay with Sir Mix-A-Lot singing about girls butts

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
It is different Loki

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
It is different and you know it

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
Anyway

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
So here's the thing

40:49.000 --> 40:52.000
Neon FM is an iOS slash Android game now

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
So you can download that on your phone

40:54.000 --> 40:57.000
And I played the machine before

40:57.000 --> 40:58.000
They had it at MAGFest

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
So seeing the machine was not new

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
But what we saw in the app

41:02.000 --> 41:05.000
Is that they actually have a list of arcades nearby

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
That have the actual Neon FM game

41:07.000 --> 41:08.000
And that's how we saw

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
Oh they have one out in Rockland

41:10.000 --> 41:13.000
We should go fucking play Neon FM in the arcade

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
And because at MAGFest

41:15.000 --> 41:16.000
As fun as MAGFest is

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
I couldn't hear that fucking game

41:18.000 --> 41:19.000
For shit at MAGFest

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
Because MAGFest is so loud

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
But we went to the arcade yesterday morning

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
Well morning-ish like noon

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
Which on a weekend is morning

41:27.000 --> 41:28.000
So we went over there

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
And there wasn't really anybody there

41:30.000 --> 41:31.000
We were like the only ones in the arcade

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
Maybe some kids playing some Ticket Spitter games

41:33.000 --> 41:34.000
That was really it

41:34.000 --> 41:35.000
And us we were playing Neon FM

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
So we were able to play it loud

41:37.000 --> 41:38.000
And that was cool

41:38.000 --> 41:39.000
Because we could actually like hear the songs

41:39.000 --> 41:40.000
And I gotta say

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
You know that game was a lot of fun to play

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
Like obviously now it's a little more pop and music

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
It's probably the closest like Bimani game

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
But it does different things

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
Like I don't want to say it's a clone

41:49.000 --> 41:50.000
It's not

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
Because I like that the grid

41:52.000 --> 41:53.000
Where the notes fall

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
Will do different things

41:55.000 --> 41:56.000
Based on the song

41:56.000 --> 41:59.000
Like I was playing a chiptune sounding song

41:59.000 --> 42:00.000
And all of a sudden

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
The grid turned into 8-bit looking notes

42:02.000 --> 42:03.000
At one part of the song

42:03.000 --> 42:04.000
And then there was another song

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
Where like the colors change

42:06.000 --> 42:07.000
And all this stuff

42:07.000 --> 42:08.000
So I thought that part was kind of cool

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
And what I thought they did

42:10.000 --> 42:11.000
That was pretty neat

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
Is that they've really embraced

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
And I know we've brought this up on OLR before

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
But they've really embraced this whole fact

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
That you can log into the machine

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
Using your smartphone

42:21.000 --> 42:24.000
So you scan a QR code on the machine

42:24.000 --> 42:25.000
As you're picking your song

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
And they don't have time limits

42:27.000 --> 42:28.000
When you pick your song

42:28.000 --> 42:29.000
Thank god

42:29.000 --> 42:30.000
You can just sit there and pick your song

42:30.000 --> 42:31.000
However long it's gonna take

42:31.000 --> 42:32.000
Once you pick your song

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
You only have 30 seconds to pick the difficulty

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
But you pick your song or whatever

42:36.000 --> 42:37.000
So you can scan the QR code

42:37.000 --> 42:38.000
You log into the machine

42:38.000 --> 42:39.000
And then it knows it's you

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
And so it's linked to whatever you're playing

42:41.000 --> 42:42.000
On your phone

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
And so you're building like one profile

42:44.000 --> 42:45.000
Or whatever

42:45.000 --> 42:46.000
So I thought that part was really cool

42:46.000 --> 42:49.000
And you know the points that you earn and stuff

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
Can go for the in-game currency

42:51.000 --> 42:54.000
That you use to play licensed music

42:54.000 --> 42:55.000
In the phone version

42:55.000 --> 42:56.000
So I thought that was really cool

42:56.000 --> 42:59.000
And you can do multiplayer

42:59.000 --> 43:02.000
Across iPhone and the arcade machine

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
And that's what the 30 seconds is for

43:04.000 --> 43:05.000
Is that for those 30 seconds

43:05.000 --> 43:06.000
Other players can join you

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
Unless you skip that out

43:08.000 --> 43:09.000
But

43:09.000 --> 43:10.000
Excuse me

43:10.000 --> 43:13.000
But what we were able to do

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
We had Shane was playing the machine

43:16.000 --> 43:17.000
He logged in

43:17.000 --> 43:18.000
He picked his song

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
And as he was picking his song

43:20.000 --> 43:21.000
I went on my phone

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
And I picked the same song

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
And so I hit start now

43:25.000 --> 43:26.000
Because he picked a licensed song

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
I had to spend one of my in-game currency to do it

43:28.000 --> 43:29.000
But it was fine

43:29.000 --> 43:30.000
So as he was playing

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
I was able to play the exact same song

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
Behind him on my phone

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
And we were competing against each other basically

43:36.000 --> 43:37.000
I lost big time

43:37.000 --> 43:38.000
Because I'm sorry

43:38.000 --> 43:39.000
You can't tap on your phone

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
The same way you can smack those big buttons

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
But I thought that was really fucking cool

43:43.000 --> 43:46.000
That you could play the same music game

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
That the person is playing on the arcade

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
But you're doing it on your account

43:50.000 --> 43:51.000
But you're playing

43:51.000 --> 43:52.000
I just thought that was really cool

43:52.000 --> 43:53.000
It reminded me of back in the day

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
When Para Para was a big music game

43:55.000 --> 43:56.000
That everybody played

43:56.000 --> 43:59.000
That people would mimic the dances

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
Behind the person that was actually doing the dancing

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
It kind of reminded me of that

44:03.000 --> 44:04.000
So

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
Loki, if you haven't checked out Neon FM

44:06.000 --> 44:07.000
I think that would be amazing to kick out of

44:07.000 --> 44:08.000
Yeah

44:08.000 --> 44:09.000
So

44:09.000 --> 44:10.000
So

44:10.000 --> 44:11.000
Yeah

44:11.000 --> 44:12.000
ActDeftInChat says

44:12.000 --> 44:13.000
That sounds pretty awesome

44:13.000 --> 44:14.000
Yeah

44:14.000 --> 44:15.000
It was neat to play through that

44:15.000 --> 44:16.000
DrTouya says

44:16.000 --> 44:17.000
I've done that

44:17.000 --> 44:18.000
Played people in the arcade version on my phone

44:18.000 --> 44:19.000
While I'm at home

44:19.000 --> 44:20.000
Yeah

44:20.000 --> 44:21.000
You can do that

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
So that's Neon FM's big selling point

44:23.000 --> 44:24.000
So congrats to those guys

44:24.000 --> 44:25.000
For finally getting their game out

44:25.000 --> 44:26.000
All these years later

44:26.000 --> 44:27.000
And

44:27.000 --> 44:28.000
I would say it paid off

44:28.000 --> 44:29.000
Because

44:29.000 --> 44:32.000
I don't feel like I'm playing a 15 year old game

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
They've put a very new modern spin on it

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
With this whole linking the phones

44:36.000 --> 44:37.000
To the arcade machine

44:37.000 --> 44:38.000
So

44:38.000 --> 44:39.000
Good job on you

44:39.000 --> 44:40.000
Except

44:40.000 --> 44:41.000
That girl's butt song is fucking terrible

44:41.000 --> 44:42.000
And should be deleted from the game

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
That's the only read I'm going to give on that game

44:44.000 --> 44:45.000
Otherwise

44:45.000 --> 44:46.000
Neon FM did a good job

44:46.000 --> 44:47.000
And there are a lot of great songs on it

44:47.000 --> 44:48.000
There really are

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
Is girl's butts also in the

44:50.000 --> 44:51.000
Or the mole version

44:51.000 --> 44:52.000
The song list match

44:52.000 --> 44:53.000
At least as far as I've seen

44:53.000 --> 44:54.000
The exact same songs

44:54.000 --> 44:55.000
Because it makes sense

44:55.000 --> 44:56.000
Yeah

44:56.000 --> 44:57.000
Yeah exactly

44:57.000 --> 44:58.000
I mean there's still some unlocks

44:58.000 --> 44:59.000
And they

44:59.000 --> 45:00.000
They actually

45:00.000 --> 45:01.000
Like when you play enough songs

45:01.000 --> 45:02.000
It actually says

45:02.000 --> 45:03.000
Coming on June 2nd

45:03.000 --> 45:04.000
This song

45:04.000 --> 45:05.000
Coming on June 19th

45:05.000 --> 45:06.000
This song

45:06.000 --> 45:07.000
So they're

45:08.000 --> 45:09.000
I think that's kind of neat

45:09.000 --> 45:10.000
So

45:10.000 --> 45:11.000
Anyway

45:11.000 --> 45:12.000
So yeah

45:12.000 --> 45:13.000
I would give a shout out

45:13.000 --> 45:14.000
For Neon FM

45:14.000 --> 45:15.000
And check that out on your mobile devices

45:15.000 --> 45:16.000
If you haven't already

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
But while I was at the arcade

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
I had no idea that this arcade

45:20.000 --> 45:21.000
Was growing in music games

45:21.000 --> 45:22.000
Because they had

45:22.000 --> 45:23.000
We looked over and we were like

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
Oh it's a DDR Supernova

45:25.000 --> 45:26.000
Whatever

45:26.000 --> 45:27.000
And then when we give it a second look

45:27.000 --> 45:28.000
We were like

45:28.000 --> 45:29.000
Wait a minute

45:29.000 --> 45:30.000
That's not Supernova

45:30.000 --> 45:31.000
That's DDR

45:31.000 --> 45:32.000
Whatever

45:32.000 --> 45:33.000
Not Ace

45:33.000 --> 45:34.000
2016

45:34.000 --> 45:35.000
2016 or 15

45:35.000 --> 45:36.000
Or whatever was before Ace

45:37.000 --> 45:38.000
Is that the one that was like

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
Cross second mix or something like that?

45:40.000 --> 45:41.000
No

45:41.000 --> 45:42.000
It was after that before Ace

45:42.000 --> 45:43.000
There was just

45:43.000 --> 45:46.000
It was the DDR reboot

45:46.000 --> 45:47.000
It was that game

45:47.000 --> 45:48.000
So we were like

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
Oh they just put that in a Supernova cabinet

45:50.000 --> 45:53.000
And then there was the brand new pump game

45:53.000 --> 45:54.000
That like just came

45:54.000 --> 45:55.000
Shane was like

45:55.000 --> 45:56.000
Oh my gosh

45:56.000 --> 45:57.000
It's the new pump game

45:57.000 --> 45:58.000
He's a big fan of pump

45:58.000 --> 45:59.000
He's like wow

45:59.000 --> 46:00.000
This like just came out

46:00.000 --> 46:01.000
And they have it here

46:01.000 --> 46:02.000
That's crazy

46:02.000 --> 46:03.000
But then here's the other thing

46:03.000 --> 46:04.000
That caught our eye

46:04.000 --> 46:05.000
And I was like

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
I thought this game never happened

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
They had an in the groove 3 cabinet

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
And I was like

46:11.000 --> 46:12.000
Wait a minute

46:12.000 --> 46:13.000
Because it didn't happen

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
In the groove 3 didn't fucking happen

46:15.000 --> 46:16.000
Because Konami

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
That is a custom cabinet

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
That is a hell of a fucking custom cabinet

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
Because it has the signage

46:22.000 --> 46:23.000
It has

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
It definitely has in the groove dance pads on it

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
That's running straight up step mania

46:27.000 --> 46:31.000
And yeah it had 12,000 songs loaded on it

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
And no shit it's running step mania

46:33.000 --> 46:34.000
Because I was like

46:34.000 --> 46:35.000
Okay whatever

46:35.000 --> 46:36.000
It's in the groove

46:36.000 --> 46:37.000
I'm here to play Neon FM

46:37.000 --> 46:40.000
And no shade against in the groove

46:40.000 --> 46:41.000
And DDR and all that stuff

46:41.000 --> 46:42.000
But the reality is

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
I'm 38 years old and I'm out of shape

46:44.000 --> 46:47.000
I'm not gonna fucking dance in a public place

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
Because I can't do it like I used to

46:49.000 --> 46:50.000
I can't do it like I used to

46:50.000 --> 46:51.000
Neon FM is fine

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
That's a lot of songs to sort through

46:53.000 --> 46:54.000
But then

46:54.000 --> 46:55.000
So yeah I just was like

46:55.000 --> 46:56.000
Okay whatever

46:56.000 --> 46:57.000
Cool they have it

46:57.000 --> 46:58.000
You know we were kind of like

46:58.000 --> 46:59.000
Just didn't pay it a second mind

46:59.000 --> 47:00.000
But then as we were playing Neon FM

47:00.000 --> 47:01.000
Some other guy got up there

47:01.000 --> 47:02.000
We kind of looked over

47:02.000 --> 47:03.000
And I was like

47:03.000 --> 47:04.000
Wait a minute

47:04.000 --> 47:05.000
There's nothing but fucking DDR songs on it

47:05.000 --> 47:06.000
I mean I just saw

47:06.000 --> 47:07.000
1-2 Little Bitch

47:07.000 --> 47:08.000
0-0-0-7

47:08.000 --> 47:09.000
Like all the songs

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
That would be in a DDR fourth mix plus

47:11.000 --> 47:12.000
And I was like

47:12.000 --> 47:13.000
The fuck

47:13.000 --> 47:14.000
And we kind of give it a second look

47:14.000 --> 47:15.000
And we're like

47:15.000 --> 47:16.000
Oh my god

47:16.000 --> 47:17.000
This thing is like

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
This in the groove three

47:19.000 --> 47:20.000
And then like Shane and I

47:20.000 --> 47:21.000
Started to piece it together

47:21.000 --> 47:22.000
We were like

47:22.000 --> 47:23.000
Wait a minute

47:23.000 --> 47:24.000
Wasn't in the groove three

47:24.000 --> 47:25.000
The one where they kind of gave

47:25.000 --> 47:26.000
That final F you to Konami

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
Right as they were getting sued

47:28.000 --> 47:29.000
Where they opened up the USB stick

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
So you could load anything on it

47:31.000 --> 47:32.000
Right

47:33.000 --> 47:34.000
Nah it's just a step mini machine

47:34.000 --> 47:35.000
Wow

47:35.000 --> 47:36.000
That's all it is

47:36.000 --> 47:37.000
So

47:37.000 --> 47:40.000
I did not know those machines actually existed

47:40.000 --> 47:41.000
And now that I've talked about it

47:41.000 --> 47:42.000
Openly on a podcast

47:42.000 --> 47:43.000
That many

47:43.000 --> 47:44.000
Not many people

47:44.000 --> 47:45.000
But some people listen to

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
Including some of the industry

47:47.000 --> 47:48.000
Maybe that machine won't be there much longer

47:48.000 --> 47:49.000
I don't know

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
Yeah they could get in pretty big trouble for

47:51.000 --> 47:52.000
Don't

47:52.000 --> 47:53.000
You guys don't

47:53.000 --> 47:54.000
No

47:54.000 --> 47:55.000
To those listening

47:55.000 --> 47:56.000
Don't shut it down

47:56.000 --> 47:57.000
Come on

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
It's not hurting anybody being there

47:59.000 --> 48:00.000
You know what it's doing

48:00.000 --> 48:01.000
It's reminding people

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
Of the glory days of 15 years ago

48:03.000 --> 48:04.000
Just let it be

48:04.000 --> 48:05.000
It's not fucking

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
Hurting sales of anything

48:07.000 --> 48:08.000
So just like

48:08.000 --> 48:09.000
Yeah because Rockstar can't sue

48:09.000 --> 48:10.000
Because Rockstar's not there anymore

48:10.000 --> 48:13.000
Konami might sue but you know

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
Let in the groove three be

48:15.000 --> 48:16.000
Let it be at peace

48:16.000 --> 48:17.000
Maybe

48:17.000 --> 48:18.000
I don't

48:18.000 --> 48:19.000
So that was weird

48:19.000 --> 48:20.000
There must be something going on there

48:20.000 --> 48:21.000
I fully expect

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
That we're gonna see

48:23.000 --> 48:24.000
Kyle's new game

48:24.000 --> 48:25.000
StepMania X

48:25.000 --> 48:26.000
Or whatever

48:26.000 --> 48:27.000
StepMania X

48:27.000 --> 48:28.000
I fully expect that thing

48:28.000 --> 48:29.000
Is gonna end up

48:29.000 --> 48:30.000
At the same place

48:30.000 --> 48:31.000
That's actually out in the wild

48:31.000 --> 48:32.000
Because

48:32.000 --> 48:33.000
Just based on the music games

48:33.000 --> 48:34.000
I'm seeing there

48:34.000 --> 48:35.000
I'm like

48:35.000 --> 48:36.000
Okay

48:36.000 --> 48:37.000
How weird to go to this arcade

48:37.000 --> 48:38.000
And like the vast majority of it

48:38.000 --> 48:39.000
Is ticket spitters

48:39.000 --> 48:40.000
When we walked in there

48:40.000 --> 48:41.000
We were like

48:41.000 --> 48:42.000
Oh

48:42.000 --> 48:43.000
That thing was a lie

48:43.000 --> 48:44.000
There's not gonna be a fucking

48:44.000 --> 48:45.000
Neon FM here

48:45.000 --> 48:46.000
There's nothing but ticket spitters here

48:46.000 --> 48:47.000
But in the back corner

48:47.000 --> 48:48.000
It was like

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
Oh all these fucking music games

48:50.000 --> 48:51.000
Right next to each other

48:51.000 --> 48:52.000
There's room for more

48:52.000 --> 48:53.000
Yes

48:53.000 --> 48:54.000
Secret Club says

48:54.000 --> 48:55.000
Act Deaf

48:55.000 --> 48:56.000
Yes that's very true

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
Act Deaf says

48:58.000 --> 48:59.000
This week's secret club

48:59.000 --> 49:00.000
Is that

49:00.000 --> 49:03.000
In the Groove StepMania machine

49:03.000 --> 49:04.000
Very true

49:04.000 --> 49:05.000
Very true

49:05.000 --> 49:06.000
Alright

49:06.000 --> 49:07.000
Orange Right says

49:07.000 --> 49:08.000
I remember playing two of them in Reno

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
Not an ITG themed one

49:10.000 --> 49:11.000
Two StepMania machines

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
You know

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
Maybe the software in it

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
Wasn't in the Groove 3

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
Maybe it was like that

49:19.000 --> 49:20.000
DDR

49:20.000 --> 49:21.000
You know

49:21.000 --> 49:22.000
Cause I didn't take a second look

49:22.000 --> 49:23.000
Maybe you're right

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
Maybe it wasn't really in the Groove 3

49:25.000 --> 49:26.000
It just had the signage for it

49:26.000 --> 49:27.000
It was just fucking

49:27.000 --> 49:28.000
StepMania in a cabinet

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
It is StepMania in a cabinet

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
They have an In the Groove 3 theme

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
Now there's been some pretty awesome

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
Like In the Groove 3 skins

49:36.000 --> 49:37.000
That people have done

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
Or like actual cabinets that people have made

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
I even went on to Wikipedia

49:41.000 --> 49:42.000
Now here's it

49:42.000 --> 49:43.000
For you Wikipedia folks

49:43.000 --> 49:44.000
K

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
It says on Wikipedia

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
In the Groove 3 was cancelled

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
Due to such and such and such

49:50.000 --> 49:51.000
It says it right there on Wikipedia

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
Bitch I just saw one

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
It was not

49:55.000 --> 49:56.000
It happened

49:56.000 --> 49:57.000
It happened

49:57.000 --> 49:58.000
It happened somehow

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
But it's apparently this giant secret

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
Those pics didn't happen

50:02.000 --> 50:03.000
You have to know

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
I fucking posted a picture on Twitter

50:05.000 --> 50:06.000
Source that bitch

50:06.000 --> 50:07.000
It happened

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
I would source my fucking Twitter

50:09.000 --> 50:10.000
On Wikipedia

50:10.000 --> 50:11.000
Do it

50:13.000 --> 50:14.000
Anyway

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
D'Artesia says

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
I think In the Groove 3 was a fan thing

50:18.000 --> 50:19.000
Maybe I don't know

50:19.000 --> 50:20.000
I'm just saying

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
It was a convincing fucking cabinet

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
I you know I

50:24.000 --> 50:25.000
It's not like

50:25.000 --> 50:26.000
Kyle's a busy guy

50:26.000 --> 50:27.000
But I'm sure he would answer an email

50:27.000 --> 50:28.000
If I sent him a picture

50:28.000 --> 50:29.000
And I'd be like

50:29.000 --> 50:30.000
Explain this

50:31.000 --> 50:32.000
Of course I don't want the response to be

50:32.000 --> 50:33.000
Where was that

50:36.000 --> 50:37.000
Anyway alright

50:37.000 --> 50:38.000
That looks like a

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
Isn't that a solo machine cabinet

50:40.000 --> 50:41.000
No that's not a solo machine

50:41.000 --> 50:42.000
No the floor was In the Groove

50:42.000 --> 50:43.000
I reckon

50:43.000 --> 50:44.000
The floor

50:44.000 --> 50:45.000
It's probably just an In the Groove machine

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
That they put new

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
It was a widescreen thing

50:49.000 --> 50:50.000
It was not In the Groove

50:50.000 --> 50:51.000
Fucking win in DDR cabinets

50:51.000 --> 50:52.000
Okay

50:52.000 --> 50:53.000
It's a custom cabinet

50:53.000 --> 50:54.000
That someone made

50:55.000 --> 50:56.000
Anyway

50:56.000 --> 50:57.000
It's probably custom

50:57.000 --> 50:58.000
Alright

51:00.000 --> 51:03.000
I could just see the source on Wikipedia right now

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
Episode 685 Orange Lounge Radio

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
Bitch I'm looking right at one

51:07.000 --> 51:08.000
I just like

51:08.000 --> 51:09.000
I love the

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
Wait In the Groove 3 happened?

51:11.000 --> 51:12.000
The emoji's like

51:12.000 --> 51:13.000
Wait a second

51:13.000 --> 51:14.000
Let me think about this

51:14.000 --> 51:15.000
That's cause that's what I thought

51:15.000 --> 51:16.000
I was like wait a minute

51:16.000 --> 51:17.000
I'm confused

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
Wikipedia told me it was cancelled

51:19.000 --> 51:20.000
I'm looking right at it

51:22.000 --> 51:23.000
TigerClodChat says

51:23.000 --> 51:26.000
Sounds like In the Groove 3 is this year's polybus

51:27.000 --> 51:28.000
Possibly

51:28.000 --> 51:29.000
Act Def says

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
Looking at the photo it kind of looks like a pump it up machine

51:31.000 --> 51:32.000
Okay

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
Wasn't there a pump it up

51:34.000 --> 51:37.000
That was In the Groove infused

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
And it was four panel

51:39.000 --> 51:40.000
Not five

51:40.000 --> 51:41.000
Or am I crazy

51:41.000 --> 51:42.000
I

51:42.000 --> 51:43.000
Okay I realized that the steps

51:43.000 --> 51:44.000
You can't see in the picture

51:44.000 --> 51:45.000
I didn't

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
I should have thought to include the whole fucking thing

51:47.000 --> 51:48.000
But the steps

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
Were an In the Groove dance thing

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
Because it was like those orange blue arrows

51:53.000 --> 51:54.000
That you see in In the Groove

51:55.000 --> 51:56.000
So that's what it was

51:56.000 --> 51:57.000
It was not a five panel like pump

51:57.000 --> 51:58.000
It was a four panel

51:58.000 --> 51:59.000
They can custom make that stuff though

51:59.000 --> 52:00.000
Maybe

52:00.000 --> 52:01.000
Cause it's just a cabinet

52:01.000 --> 52:02.000
And then you get like a DDR panel

52:02.000 --> 52:03.000
You know eight

52:03.000 --> 52:04.000
Or you know

52:04.000 --> 52:05.000
Sixteen panel

52:05.000 --> 52:06.000
Not sixteen panel

52:06.000 --> 52:07.000
Eight panel

52:08.000 --> 52:09.000
Set up stage or whatever

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
And you just replace the arrows out of it

52:11.000 --> 52:12.000
Alright

52:12.000 --> 52:13.000
Alright we've talked

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
We talked a long time about this

52:17.000 --> 52:18.000
I'm ready to move on

52:18.000 --> 52:19.000
But I just

52:19.000 --> 52:20.000
You know as a long time music game fan

52:20.000 --> 52:21.000
It was

52:21.000 --> 52:22.000
It was

52:22.000 --> 52:23.000
It was that poly bus moment of

52:23.000 --> 52:24.000
Wait a minute

52:24.000 --> 52:25.000
What

52:25.000 --> 52:26.000
What the fuck is this doing here

52:26.000 --> 52:27.000
Especially

52:27.000 --> 52:28.000
Here

52:28.000 --> 52:29.000
Like not the bay area

52:29.000 --> 52:30.000
Not Seattle

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
I would have fully expected to see one in Seattle

52:32.000 --> 52:33.000
Cause that's where all that

52:33.000 --> 52:34.000
Stuff started

52:34.000 --> 52:35.000
But um

52:35.000 --> 52:36.000
Here

52:36.000 --> 52:37.000
Like what

52:37.000 --> 52:38.000
Anyway it was weird

52:38.000 --> 52:39.000
Anyway

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
Maybe I'll get an email or tweet about it this week

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
Say Rob I wish you hadn't talked about that but

52:43.000 --> 52:44.000
Sorry

52:44.000 --> 52:45.000
Well you know what

52:45.000 --> 52:46.000
I'm sorry

52:46.000 --> 52:47.000
If you didn't want anybody

52:47.000 --> 52:48.000
Nobody

52:48.000 --> 52:49.000
You don't put it in the middle of a fucking arcade

52:49.000 --> 52:50.000
Yes

52:50.000 --> 52:51.000
I might be

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
What did you think was gonna fucking happen

52:53.000 --> 52:54.000
I mean

52:54.000 --> 52:55.000
As I said

52:55.000 --> 52:56.000
The powers that be in the legal folks out there

52:56.000 --> 52:57.000
Just

52:57.000 --> 52:58.000
It's not hurting anybody

52:58.000 --> 52:59.000
In fact

52:59.000 --> 53:00.000
I was

53:00.000 --> 53:01.000
It made me smile

53:01.000 --> 53:02.000
To be like

53:02.000 --> 53:03.000
If I wanna go fucking play

53:03.000 --> 53:04.000
Conga feeling

53:04.000 --> 53:05.000
Or some of those old things

53:05.000 --> 53:06.000
Cause all the

53:06.000 --> 53:07.000
Cause I'll tell you what

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
Down the street at Roseville Golf Land

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
That Max 2 machine needs to be euthanized

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
It needs to be taken out back to the barn

53:13.000 --> 53:14.000
And shot in the

53:14.000 --> 53:15.000
It just

53:15.000 --> 53:16.000
It needs to be killed

53:16.000 --> 53:17.000
Because it is

53:17.000 --> 53:18.000
It is horrific

53:18.000 --> 53:19.000
In horrific shape

53:19.000 --> 53:20.000
So I can only imagine

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
There's probably very few number of fourth mix

53:22.000 --> 53:23.000
And fourth mix plus out there

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
That are still in good shape

53:25.000 --> 53:26.000
Like

53:26.000 --> 53:27.000
Probably private owners

53:27.000 --> 53:28.000
That take good fucking care of them

53:28.000 --> 53:29.000
But like

53:29.000 --> 53:30.000
Things that have been out there

53:30.000 --> 53:31.000
In the arcades and stuff

53:31.000 --> 53:32.000
They're

53:32.000 --> 53:33.000
They're

53:33.000 --> 53:34.000
They're all gonna be hurting

53:34.000 --> 53:35.000
So you know what

53:35.000 --> 53:36.000
I'm glad that

53:36.000 --> 53:37.000
It lives on

53:37.000 --> 53:38.000
Through this

53:38.000 --> 53:39.000
So it made me happy so

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
And just give it another season of wet feet

53:41.000 --> 53:42.000
From you know

53:42.000 --> 53:43.000
The water slides

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
Slopping all over the Max 2 machines

53:45.000 --> 53:46.000
Well luckily

53:46.000 --> 53:47.000
Luckily a bowling alley

53:47.000 --> 53:48.000
Doesn't have that problem

53:48.000 --> 53:49.000
Alright

53:49.000 --> 53:50.000
Alright

53:50.000 --> 53:51.000
Oh

53:51.000 --> 53:52.000
Pump it up prime

53:52.000 --> 53:53.000
Says act deft

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
And actually links me to a picture

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
Of pump it up prime

53:57.000 --> 54:00.000
See but the floor's different

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
The screen looks

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
No but the screen didn't say pump it up on it

54:04.000 --> 54:05.000
Look at my picture

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
It didn't say pump at the bottom

54:07.000 --> 54:08.000
So

54:08.000 --> 54:09.000
But yes

54:09.000 --> 54:10.000
Pump it up prime

54:10.000 --> 54:11.000
Was the one that was in the

54:11.000 --> 54:12.000
Alright I don't know

54:12.000 --> 54:13.000
You know what

54:13.000 --> 54:14.000
I'm just gonna fucking email Kyle

54:14.000 --> 54:15.000
Alright

54:15.000 --> 54:16.000
This is a custom camera man

54:16.000 --> 54:17.000
I'm just gonna fucking do it

54:17.000 --> 54:18.000
Alright

54:18.000 --> 54:19.000
Let's get into it

54:19.000 --> 54:20.000
Let's talk about

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
What's been going on in gaming

54:22.000 --> 54:23.000
I do want to quickly plug

54:23.000 --> 54:24.000
Our Twitter

54:24.000 --> 54:25.000

Lots of great shows coming up

For you throughout the month of May

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
And then of course into June

54:34.000 --> 54:35.000
It's gonna be a crazy busy month

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
Leading up to our 15th anniversary

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
On June 18th

54:39.000 --> 54:40.000
And

54:40.000 --> 54:41.000
We are looking to

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
Kind of plug and promote

54:43.000 --> 54:44.000
15 years of O-L-R

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
So if you are interested in

54:46.000 --> 54:47.000
So if you are interested in

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
Having one of us on your podcast

54:49.000 --> 54:50.000
Or shit if the timing works out

54:50.000 --> 54:51.000
Maybe all of us

54:51.000 --> 54:52.000
We can be hard to get all in the

54:52.000 --> 54:53.000
Same place at one point

54:53.000 --> 54:54.000
But just email us

54:54.000 --> 54:55.000
Participate at

54:55.000 --> 54:56.000
Orange Lounge Radio dot com

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
And we're really just trying to

54:58.000 --> 54:59.000
Promote and get out there

54:59.000 --> 55:00.000
So we would love to come on

55:00.000 --> 55:01.000
Your show

55:01.000 --> 55:02.000
Um

55:02.000 --> 55:03.000
Let's get started with some

55:03.000 --> 55:04.000
Gaming news for the week

55:04.000 --> 55:05.000
Loki

55:05.000 --> 55:06.000
Yes

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
So apparently the Oculus

55:08.000 --> 55:09.000
Um

55:09.000 --> 55:10.000
What was it

55:10.000 --> 55:11.000
Oculus story studio

55:11.000 --> 55:12.000
Has

55:12.000 --> 55:13.000
Closed down

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
Now the Oculus story studio

55:15.000 --> 55:16.000
If you're not familiar with that

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
Was supposed to be releasing

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
Some VR enhanced

55:20.000 --> 55:21.000
Um

55:21.000 --> 55:22.000
Movies

55:22.000 --> 55:23.000
So they had three that they had

55:23.000 --> 55:24.000
Worked on and released

55:24.000 --> 55:27.000
Lost Henry and Dear Angelica

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
And you know they had some

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
Big name stars doing the voices

55:31.000 --> 55:32.000
In these movies as well

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
But I guess according to

55:34.000 --> 55:35.000
Um

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
The Oculus VP of content

55:37.000 --> 55:38.000
Jason Rubin

55:38.000 --> 55:39.000
Um

55:39.000 --> 55:40.000
They're still looking to film

55:40.000 --> 55:41.000
VR projects

55:41.000 --> 55:42.000
But

55:42.000 --> 55:43.000
You know ongoing projects

55:43.000 --> 55:44.000
From the Oculus story studio

55:44.000 --> 55:45.000
Have been cancelled

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
And of course the three

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
That have been released so far

55:49.000 --> 55:50.000
Are still on the store

55:50.000 --> 55:51.000
They're not going to be

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
Delisted or anything like that

55:53.000 --> 55:54.000
So

55:54.000 --> 55:55.000
Yeah

55:55.000 --> 55:56.000
That's um

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
That's unfortunate

55:58.000 --> 55:59.000
But I guess it makes sense

55:59.000 --> 56:00.000
Because there's not a lot of

56:00.000 --> 56:01.000
Eyes hitting that stuff right now

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
I mean you're talking about

56:03.000 --> 56:04.000
You know people that have

56:04.000 --> 56:05.000
VR

56:05.000 --> 56:06.000
You know headsets and stuff

56:06.000 --> 56:07.000
On the Oculus

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
Which is a closed store front

56:09.000 --> 56:10.000
And then people that are going to

56:10.000 --> 56:11.000
Be interested in actually

56:11.000 --> 56:12.000
Viewing these

56:12.000 --> 56:13.000
Like movies

56:13.000 --> 56:14.000
That's a really small market

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
That you're hitting right there

56:16.000 --> 56:17.000
It's just

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
Maybe when it's more mainstream

56:19.000 --> 56:20.000
Bobby and I were talking about

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
This in one of our chats earlier

56:22.000 --> 56:23.000
Um

56:23.000 --> 56:24.000
And he said he's actually seen

56:24.000 --> 56:25.000
Those movies

56:25.000 --> 56:26.000
And that they were

56:26.000 --> 56:27.000
They were good

56:27.000 --> 56:28.000
So

56:28.000 --> 56:29.000
It's kind of

56:29.000 --> 56:30.000
Kind of a bummer to see it go

56:30.000 --> 56:31.000
But that's a really

56:31.000 --> 56:32.000
High caliber of talent

56:32.000 --> 56:33.000
Which tells me

56:33.000 --> 56:34.000
It's expensive talent

56:34.000 --> 56:35.000
So this probably wasn't a cheap

56:35.000 --> 56:36.000
Endeavor

56:36.000 --> 56:37.000
By

56:37.000 --> 56:38.000
Especially

56:38.000 --> 56:39.000
If the quality of the films

56:39.000 --> 56:40.000
Ended up being good too

56:40.000 --> 56:41.000
I mean it was probably

56:41.000 --> 56:42.000
It probably cost them to do it

56:42.000 --> 56:43.000
So you know

56:43.000 --> 56:44.000
Again

56:44.000 --> 56:45.000
You gotta make money

56:45.000 --> 56:46.000
Right

56:46.000 --> 56:47.000
So if they just weren't selling

56:47.000 --> 56:48.000
Enough

56:48.000 --> 56:49.000
To justify it

56:49.000 --> 56:50.000
Then

56:50.000 --> 56:51.000
They gotta do what they gotta do

56:51.000 --> 56:52.000
But

56:52.000 --> 56:53.000
It may be just something that's

56:53.000 --> 56:54.000
Before it's time

56:54.000 --> 56:55.000
Yeah

56:55.000 --> 56:56.000
And that could be the case too

56:56.000 --> 56:57.000
And you know they do say they're

56:57.000 --> 56:58.000
Looking at

56:58.000 --> 56:59.000
You know funding

56:59.000 --> 57:00.000
Other VR film projects

57:00.000 --> 57:01.000
So

57:01.000 --> 57:02.000
Maybe

57:02.000 --> 57:03.000
Maybe it's just something

57:03.000 --> 57:04.000
The indie scene is gonna have to

57:04.000 --> 57:05.000
Pick up and run with

57:05.000 --> 57:06.000
I don't know

57:06.000 --> 57:07.000
I'm still surprised though

57:07.000 --> 57:08.000
We haven't had that

57:08.000 --> 57:09.000
Well

57:09.000 --> 57:10.000
Maybe this is out there

57:10.000 --> 57:11.000
And I'm just not aware of it

57:11.000 --> 57:12.000
Because I'm not an Oculus owner

57:12.000 --> 57:13.000
And I don't use

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
You know a lot of the VR stuff

57:15.000 --> 57:16.000
Yet

57:16.000 --> 57:17.000
But

57:17.000 --> 57:18.000
We're finally getting a

57:18.000 --> 57:19.000
Gear VR in the house

57:19.000 --> 57:20.000
Because

57:20.000 --> 57:21.000
When Alan bought his phone

57:21.000 --> 57:22.000
They were running a promotion

57:22.000 --> 57:23.000
Or whatever

57:23.000 --> 57:24.000
Because he got one of those new

57:24.000 --> 57:25.000
SAs or whatever

57:25.000 --> 57:26.000
Yeah I have no idea

57:26.000 --> 57:27.000
Yeah he got a

57:27.000 --> 57:28.000
Thing of that

57:28.000 --> 57:29.000
So

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
I'm surprised that Facebook

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
Hasn't injected more VR

57:33.000 --> 57:34.000
Into the news feed yet

57:34.000 --> 57:35.000
I know

57:35.000 --> 57:36.000
Like some of it's there

57:36.000 --> 57:37.000
I see like 360 video

57:37.000 --> 57:38.000
So I'm

57:38.000 --> 57:39.000
What

57:39.000 --> 57:40.000
I'm sure you could put that on

57:40.000 --> 57:41.000
An Oculus headset

57:41.000 --> 57:42.000
And you could see the 360 video

57:42.000 --> 57:43.000
But I feel like

57:43.000 --> 57:44.000
Isn't that the direction

57:44.000 --> 57:45.000
Where Facebook wants to be

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
When they're shoving that video

57:47.000 --> 57:48.000
Stuff down your throat

57:48.000 --> 57:49.000
And they're really trying to

57:49.000 --> 57:50.000
Like so and so is life

57:50.000 --> 57:51.000
Like

57:51.000 --> 57:52.000
There's gonna be a time

57:52.000 --> 57:53.000
Yeah but I don't think

57:53.000 --> 57:54.000
When

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
There's gonna be a time when

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
You don't have to strand yourself

57:58.000 --> 57:59.000
On a desert island

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
To go see the fire festival

58:01.000 --> 58:04.000
You could see it live in VR

58:04.000 --> 58:05.000
Maybe that

58:05.000 --> 58:06.000
Maybe that's how

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
Fire Festival 2018

58:08.000 --> 58:09.000
Will happen

58:09.000 --> 58:10.000
It's from the safety

58:10.000 --> 58:11.000
Of your own damn home

58:11.000 --> 58:12.000
Because we can't figure out

58:12.000 --> 58:13.000
How to you know

58:13.000 --> 58:14.000
Build a temporary home

58:14.000 --> 58:15.000
From the safety of your home

58:15.000 --> 58:16.000
In VR

58:16.000 --> 58:17.000
Fully in VR

58:17.000 --> 58:18.000
On

58:18.000 --> 58:19.000
Oculus Rift

58:19.000 --> 58:20.000
Although

58:20.000 --> 58:21.000
Obviously

58:21.000 --> 58:22.000
You don't want that fucking name

58:22.000 --> 58:23.000
Anywhere near your product

58:23.000 --> 58:24.000
Right now

58:24.000 --> 58:25.000
Honestly

58:25.000 --> 58:26.000
The fire festival is like

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
The beginning of a

58:28.000 --> 58:29.000
Horror action movie

58:29.000 --> 58:30.000
Or a thriller

58:30.000 --> 58:31.000
Or something like that

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
Where you trick all these people

58:33.000 --> 58:34.000
And they're going on

58:34.000 --> 58:35.000
To a deserted island

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
And then there's some

58:37.000 --> 58:38.000
Fight to the death

58:38.000 --> 58:39.000
I mean that's really

58:39.000 --> 58:40.000
Really pieces of

58:40.000 --> 58:41.000
Sort of missing from

58:41.000 --> 58:42.000
That survivor

58:42.000 --> 58:43.000
The Hunger Games type thing

58:43.000 --> 58:44.000
You know

58:44.000 --> 58:45.000
It's like

58:45.000 --> 58:46.000
Oh shit we got on this island

58:46.000 --> 58:47.000
To go see this festival

58:47.000 --> 58:48.000
It's like

58:48.000 --> 58:49.000
Was it Blink 182

58:49.000 --> 58:50.000
Or something like that

58:50.000 --> 58:51.000
Was that

58:51.000 --> 58:52.000
Was that

58:52.000 --> 58:53.000

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:51.000
I saw a cannon that shot cannons. So that was kind of fun. A cannon that shoots cannons. A cannon that shot cannons, yeah.

02:04:51.000 --> 02:05:04.000
So it is kind of unfortunate that they are taking that. Basically it says you don't need to buy. They found a way around the bands as well.

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:12.000
You basically own two consoles. You don't need to buy a new console each time you get banned. If you have two consoles you can get around this an infinite number of bands using the system transfer option.

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:18.000
And apparently that's how he's gotten around the bands. He's been banned twice. But that's kind of funny.

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:24.000
Would you like to know why they are no longer updating Super Mario Maker?

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:32.000
Probably because it's coming out on the Switch. Mario Maker Deluxe is going to fucking happen on the Switch. Let's say first quarter next year.

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:44.000
And it will include the skins from Super Mario All Stars. I can't say Mario 2 because Mario 2 is a very different game because of the whole fact that it was created from the Japanese game.

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:50.000
But they could create some items from Mario 2 or something. They could. You can have the stackable mushrooms or something like that.

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:56.000
But Mario All Stars would be perfect. Mario All Stars would be perfect because those sprites already exist.

02:05:56.000 --> 02:06:02.000
And they could just. Especially from the original Mario. They could just put them right in there. And that will be Mario Maker Deluxe.

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:10.000
And a few new items. A few new things. And that will be Mario Maker Deluxe on the Switch. Because this whole. The fact that Mario Kart 8 sold as well as it did.

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:20.000
Here we go. Open them fucking floodgates because here come the Wii U ports on Switch. But you know what? Honestly. Mario Kart 8 is pretty fucking good actually.

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:27.000
So I. And if it means Bayonetta 2 gets another chance. I can't hate on this.

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:37.000
But I understand that. But I own Mario Kart 8. And I just have trouble justifying the system to play Mario Kart 8 that has Battle Mode in it.

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:45.000
Because you know what? You can't fucking tell me that the Wii U can't handle Battle Mode. It fucking had Battle Mode in there.

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:51.000
And you know what? It's a god damn insult that they're not updating the Wii U version to go along with that.

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:57.000
I'm sorry. It's insulting that. Oh well you know we made this really cool thing that we really should have done in the beginning.

02:06:57.000 --> 02:07:01.000
But guess what? You're gonna pay to get another $60 for it. You know what? Fuck them. That's what I'm saying.

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:08.000
Seriously? Fuck them in this. Oh hey yeah we could fix these problems. But fuck you guys. Buy our new system.

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:16.000
That's not how it's gonna work. And you know why fucking Mario Kart 8 sold so well? Because there's no fucking games on the god damn system. It's the next biggest game.

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:22.000
Disagree. Disagree. Mario Kart 8 sold well because for most people that aren't you or me. It's their first Mario Kart 8.

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:27.000
Because a lot of people skipped the fucking Wii U. That's. That's what it is. That's why Mario Kart 8 sold.

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:33.000
I doubt it. I think it's really just the next big game that's from Nintendo that's on that platform. And that's why it's released on there.

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:44.000
I'm sorry. It's not because it's the first Mario Kart game for them. Because you can't tell me that these people didn't have like Mario Kart 7 or any of the other games.

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:51.000
It's their first Mario Kart 8. Because most people didn't buy the Wii U. So this is their first Mario Kart 8.

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:57.000
And they're like wow this game is fucking feature filled right off the bat because they skipped Mario. They skipped the Wii U completely.

02:07:57.000 --> 02:08:05.000
That's nice that they have a feature filled game. I wish I could get that because I paid the same $60 and actually more than that because I supported them with their DLC.

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:11.000
So where's my fucking reward for my loyalty? Oh that's right. Fuck you. Buy our $400 system with another game.

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:18.000
Alright. Here's a game that I don't think is planned for the Switch. I don't remember the original Kickstarter.

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:27.000
But this team called No Matter is making a game called Pray for the Gods. It was a kickstarted action RPG and get this.

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:33.000
They've had to change the name this week because it was called P-R-E-Y for the gods. Pray for the gods.

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:42.000
Well you may have missed this week or maybe you didn't miss. Bethesda released a game called Pray this week which was an update to a game.

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:47.000
Although I don't think the games really have that much in common. Name only that's it.

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:54.000
Yeah like is it still like to be fair I have not played the new Pray but I beat the old Pray.

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:57.000
The new Pray is nothing like the old Pray at all.

02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:59.000
So like the Native American themes and all that are gone?

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:05.000
Nope. It's not even in there. You like take the forms of different things. Like you can jump in.

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:12.000
It has more to do. It reminds me of like what was that game. It was. It had a fucking cherub in it.

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:18.000
And I'm trying to remember what the hell it was called. It was. Oh god. I can't remember what it's called now.

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:23.000
But they had like a. There was a cherub in it. You could take control of different people and stuff.

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:30.000
DungeonBuster in chat says the new Pray is more like Bioshock in space. That's not the first person I've heard say that basically.

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:34.000
But anyway so Pray is out obviously but now you've got this other game Pray for the Gods.

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:42.000
And so they got basically threatened with legal stuff from Zenimax Bethesda over the trademark.

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:46.000
So you may remember. This is not the first time Bethesda has done this.

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:52.000
Do you remember when they threatened against Mojang because they were doing a game called Scrolls.

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:55.000
And they were going to do. You know obviously Bethesda.

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:59.000
I don't understand how they get the trademark for such a common name in the first place.

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:01.000
That's a great fucking question.

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:05.000
I mean that is stupid. It's a single name. It's very commonly used.

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:09.000
And like the fact that they're going after other games. They have nothing to fucking do with it.

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:10.000
Ahem. Saga.

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:15.000
Exactly. It's our fucking trademark and copyright system is so goddamn messed up.

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:20.000
But what's interesting because Notch had all that Minecraft money. He did fight Zenimax in court.

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:23.000
But they did. They settled. They didn't actually go to court.

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:28.000
They did use. Mojang got to use the name Scrolls but they could not own the trademark for it.

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:32.000
But Scrolls never really came. I mean it was in beta. They did like a free beta.

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:36.000
That's as far as that game ever got. Like they never really did a full release that game.

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:40.000
This has nothing to do with it. It's like Fighter. Or like you know what the what they.

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.000
Which is what all the games.

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:43.000
It's like copywriting the.

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:49.000
Okay but back in the day. Like on the Atari 2600. That's what those fucking games were called.

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:54.000
You had Boxing. Pitfall. Adventure.

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:57.000
Like these were the games.

02:10:57.000 --> 02:11:03.000
Exactly. You like but I'm surprised that they get that kind of a copyright. They get the trademark for Prey.

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:09.000
It's such a commonly used name. I mean it's just a word. It's one word.

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:18.000
And you're telling me that like all these other games that that word is off limits now because of fucking Bethesda and their shitty game. Fuck that.

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:27.000
Well they have had to change the name to the new name of the game is Prey for the gods. It is P R A E Y for the gods.

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:30.000
That's stupid. It's fucking dumb.

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:34.000
I don't blame the developer for that. I kind of credit them.

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:45.000
No I blame Bethesda for this because the reason why you would file a lawsuit like this is because that there could be some confusion between Prey their game and Prey this game and pray for the gods.

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:54.000
It's like totally different. You look at the two games are fucking completely different. There's nothing similar about them other than they work on game. They probably both on PC.

02:11:55.000 --> 02:12:04.000
What's interesting though is that in the developer update they actually mentioned that one of the games. One of the names they were originally considering was P R A E Y for the gods.

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:11.000
But that A and E was that special character where the A and E are linked. Darsagre you know more about writing than I do.

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:17.000
Yeah. What do you call that when the A and E are linked together. It's like it's a specific alphabet like it's a Greek character.

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:23.000
Give me a moment because I know it's not a ligature. That is not a ligature. Hold on.

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:32.000
Okay. But here's the thing is that that A and E as a combined letter you can't Google that. I mean you can but you can't. People aren't going to do it.

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:35.000
So now they're just going to call it P R A E Y.

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:47.000
Actually it was originally a ligature and then it became its own letter coming actually from classic Greek and Latin and also used in Old English.

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:56.000
Why are they suing Fallout Boy? I might confuse Fallout Boy with a fucking post apocalyptic RPG because that's certainly fucking similar.

02:12:56.000 --> 02:13:01.000
Well Fallout Boy needs to be sued for a lot of reasons. I'm just kidding. I'm just hating for no reason.

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:09.000
You know why they did it? Because they're small. They're a big company and that's a small company and they can fucking get away with it. Those fucking assholes.

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:11.000
It's called an ash by the way.

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:13.000
They're an ash. Thank you.

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:24.000
Because Fallout Boy is in the name of a video game. You know what? Blackfall I understand that but this game has nothing to fucking do with their game other than the name and the name is not even the same.

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:30.000
They both make digital disc media. Fallout Boy makes CDs.

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:32.000
And a Playstation is a computer.

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:36.000
Vault Boy is in there. I mean Fallout Boy, Vault Boy.

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:37.000
Alright.

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:39.000
It's a boy that's in Fallout.

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:42.000
I need a pallet cleanser. This is getting too heated. Alright moving on.

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:45.000
Dark Sakura take us away. Take us somewhere else.

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:46.000
How about Andromeda?

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:48.000
How about space? Yes.

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:53.000
So um mods have finally legitimately happened in Mass Effect Andromeda.

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:59.000
There is a new mod tool and I have already downloaded the best of all possible mods called Shut Up Sam.

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:06.000
Where you know how every time you go into like it's really hot. The weather has increased.

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:10.000
Okay thank you. It's fucking cold on vault. Duh.

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.000
Or there's radiation. Duh.

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000
It happens every- Sam doesn't shut up.

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:19.000
So the first mod I downloaded was one where Sam shuts the fuck up.

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:28.000
Um but there is um there's a few other ones out there too and there's full installation um instructions on uh the nexus.

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:29.000
For nexus mods.

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:37.000
Um and there's even um one that helps you back up and recover your game with how it was and you know before.

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:46.000
There's also like external mods that they did have out that honestly just about every game has had out those like cinematic and color pallet adjusting ones.

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:54.000
But now um they finally they also have one that lets you use like any skin color in uh no matter what default that you choose.

02:14:54.000 --> 02:15:01.000
Um how to change your outfits. It's gonna it's not gonna be too long before we have uh custom elements in there too.

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:04.000
It didn't take them you know terribly long for Dragon Age.

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:07.000
So let's just say it. The mods are there.

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:12.000
Go forth and mod. Go forth and mod.

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:15.000
So full booby rider? Is that?

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:18.000
There actually is um a naked mod.

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:21.000
Of course there is! That's always one of the first.

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:24.000
That's like a prerequisite. Modding yeah.

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:28.000
Your game hasn't made it till somebody put boobies and dong in it.

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:33.000
I'm still looking for that inquisition mod that restores the iron bull to his former glory.

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:35.000
You knew about that right?

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:36.000
No I didn't.

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:41.000
They apparently modded his dick. Not modded um they uh modeled it.

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:51.000
And then when it was about ready to publish it finally got caught so now it's a big black rectangle where his junk is.

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:59.000
And if you go look like Flycam stuff I'll find it but yeah it's the the big black box.

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:04.000
Sorry guys they're telling me live that my mic cut out for 30 seconds when I didn't do it.

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:09.000
There's no power switch on these mics so it must be something like I reset my connection here.

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:14.000
Uh but I wouldn't be surprised at how much these mics get handled. There's some shorted wire or something.

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:18.000
It's been a while since we've replaced all these mics and that that might be coming soon.

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:23.000
I don't know these are the ones that uh Brad from Pod Culture so kindly passed down to us.

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:27.000
So that means he used them then we used them. These mics are probably on their last legs.

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:35.000
So we just might we might have to spend some money that I don't have to uh to to modernize this fucking studio.

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:39.000
That might be a project. That's why I'm going to keep screaming streaming screaming onto it.

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:45.000
I'll scream as I stream on Twitch uh to raise money to uh redo all our studios.

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:46.000
That'll be funny.

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:49.000
Alright anyway.

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
Tigerclaw says yeah you need some better quality mics.

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:53.000
I'm putting it in the chat by the way.

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:56.000
You know what? We do the best we can.

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:59.000
There you go. There's naked Iron Bull.

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:03.000
Hooray. Alright just a couple more stories for you guys and then we'll get your calls.

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:09.000
Let's see how shitty your mics sound on Skype at Orange Lounge Radio. All one word on Skype. Loki.

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:20.000
Alright so like many modern uh video games that are out um they have finally added in the Horizon Zero Dawn a selfie mode.

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:29.000
That's right you can take different poses um or take photos of different poses that Aloy can make in the game and add little tidbits and stuff to it.

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:38.000
For example um you can you know form Aloy's hands into the shape of a heart or she can be lounging on her back or several different face expressions.

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:44.000
You can add filters. You can even put like a postcard greetings from blah blah blah you know type thing in there.

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:51.000
So that is available um I guess they're going to be coming soon with some more updates along with that.

02:17:51.000 --> 02:18:00.000
But yeah I mean it makes sense now that a lot of games have done that and it really kind of helps drive the awareness on social media for them.

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:09.000
Like Grand Theft Auto. I think Grand Theft Auto 5 was probably one of the first ones that really did that heavily in there as like a kind of an in game feature so.

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:11.000
Yeah cool.

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:15.000
Yeah and uh the selfie mode in Zelda was always the one.

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:20.000
Or actually you know they also did that in Infamous Second Son I think.

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:21.000
That's right they did.

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:26.000
That was that was I think but um Grand Theft Auto to be fair was out before that so.

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:35.000
A lot of people were using their PlayStation 4 Pros with that because that was one of the games that you know was was supposed to be bigger and better on the Pro was uh Infamous so.

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:37.000
Alright well finally.

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:38.000
Speaking of a game I haven't finished yeah.

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:43.000
Finally tonight did you know they're making a movie out of Rampage.

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:47.000
You know the classic 80's game about monsters invading town.

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:50.000
Come on y'all have played this game you had to have played Rampage at some point in your life.

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:55.000
Uh the movie is being directed by Brad Payton who made the movie San Andreas.

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:57.000
Not to be confused with Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.

02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:58.000
And who does it star?

02:18:58.000 --> 02:18:59.000
Why the Rock.

02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:02.000
Dwayne Johnson is the star of this movie.

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:06.000
And uh guess what there is now a synopsis out there that came out this week.

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:10.000
Uh so uh the Rock plays a primatologist.

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:15.000
A man who keeps people at a distance shares an unshakable bond with George.

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:19.000
The extraordinarily intelligent silverback gorilla who's been in his care since birth.

02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:26.000
But a rogue genetic experiment gone ary transforms this gentle ape into a raging monster.

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:31.000
To make matters worse it's soon discovered that there are similarly altered alpha predators.

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:36.000
As these newly created monsters tear across North America destroying everything in their path.

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:40.000
The Rock teams with a discredited genetic engineer to secure an antidote.

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:42.000
Fighting his way through an ever changing battlefield.

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:48.000
Not only to haul a global catastrophe but to save the fearsome creature that was once his friend.

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:52.000
I'll make room on the shelf next to the dumpies for this one.

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:56.000
Because this does not sound that exciting to me but who knows.

02:19:56.000 --> 02:20:05.000
Uh by the way it was stated previously by the director that the film would be more emotional, scarier, and real.

02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:09.000
You know what's funny is my phone apparently thought when he said make room on the shelf.

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:14.000
Um was basically okay google which is kind of annoying.

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:17.000
I fucking just turn off you piece of crap.

02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:20.000
Yeah you need to disable that stuff.

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:27.000
Oh it enabled itself when it you know fucking updated to uh nougat or whatever this I don't know what the fuck it's on now.

02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:30.000
So if I say okay google it comes up.

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:32.000
I will make oh yep there it goes.

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.000
Download lots of porn.

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000
Hey it did that sweet.

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:44.000
It brought me to uh let's see it says it's what does it say here.

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:49.000
Wait search for I'll make you get it get up there goes download lots of porn.

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:55.000
I think it I think all it is bring up like some weird like oops.

02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:58.000
Yeah I just realized Ricky and Gleese is lyrics.

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:01.000
That's some weird shit.

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:08.000
Yeah um I I just realized there might be podcast listeners listening on speakers that now I just set off all their phones too.

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:09.000
Good job.

02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:11.000
Turn that turn that stuff off.

02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:12.000
Turn it off.

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:13.000
You don't need it.

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:18.000
Uh let's see Brad from Pod Culture says the phone will respond again.

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:26.000
Alright Orange Lounge Radio all one word on Skype if you want to give us a call and say hello.

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:30.000
Talk about something we've talked about tonight or maybe something of your own choosing.

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:33.000
Anyhow before we get to that do you have any last minute stories Loki?

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:35.000
I think we kind of tapped out on everything.

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:38.000
That barrel is scraped to the bottom so.

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:39.000
What about FUs?

02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:40.000
Oh you want to do some FUs tonight?

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:41.000
Oh heck yeah.

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:42.000
Let's do it.

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:43.000
I've got plenty to FU.

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:45.000
We got a call coming in we'll do FUs after this so let's get to it.

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:47.000
Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this?

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:50.000
It's me Rama.

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:51.000
Hi Rama how are you?

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:52.000
I'm good.

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:56.000
I have a question for you and Jamie right now.

02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:58.000
What are you going to leave Matt out of this?

02:21:58.000 --> 02:21:59.000
I'm cool with this.

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:05.000
Well Matt is residential god of anger against Nintendo so but.

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:06.000
Okay.

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:09.000
I think it's between you and Jamie.

02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:14.000
Which one of y'all is the biggest saint of throwing shade tonight?

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:15.000
I mean come on.

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:20.000
I don't know Dark Soccer was pretty good on that email earlier.

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:22.000
Rob is a sassy bitch though.

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:39.000
Yeah I don't know I don't know I think we're but we're but we see we both went to that show last night so now we're both like oh we're gonna be Bianca Del Rio today and just throw a bunch of shade so I I don't know it's it's gonna be a close race till the end of the show ain't over Rama.

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:42.000
Lord Jesus that's all I gotta say.

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:43.000
You want us to read you?

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:45.000
Just kidding.

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:54.000
Rob I have Mako-chan that does that to me on a regular basis especially when we do our show okay I get I get enough from her.

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:59.000
Alright I'm glad someone's giving it to you.

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:02.000
You should have seen us last week in Good Lord Almighty.

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:06.000
Alright anything else on your mind besides shade throwing?

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:25.000
I just gotta say when you were talking about playing DDR at your age earlier in the show I am about your age and I still get up there and I play I think I need to give you some tips on you know trying to get up there still.

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:30.000
Now I don't want to turn this into a race thing Rama but I'm gonna.

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:33.000
Just so you know I'm just busting your balls because I love you.

02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:38.000
I know and I love you too but I am gonna go racial with this for a minute Rama.

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:46.000
Your people have a better natural talent than my people when it comes to dancing.

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:49.000
Okay okay okay Rob I want you to know something.

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:54.000
That natural gift skipped my black ass okay?

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:58.000
I cannot dance unless I am on the pads okay?

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:03.000
Damn that's the thing about stereotypes they're not always true damn.

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:16.000
Exactly while everybody was growing up learning how to break dance and all that I was at home playing Super Mario Brothers 2, Super Mario Brothers 3, Super Mario I was doing all of that.

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:20.000
That doesn't impede one's ability to dance.

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:22.000
Yes it does.

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:25.000
Some people also are way out of practice like me.

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:27.000
I think it's more of that Rama.

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:30.000
Look here's the deal.

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:34.000
I don't know how much you, this is a personal question I do not expect you to answer.

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:40.000
I don't know how much you weigh now versus when you were let's say 15 years ago which for me would be 23 years old.

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:45.000
But if I were to go how much I weigh now compared to when I was 23 years old.

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:48.000
Some things have changed pretty majorly in that department Rama.

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:55.000
So that's part of the reason it's contributed itself to the fact that I don't move as fast as I used to.

02:24:55.000 --> 02:25:03.000
However maybe if I played more of these dancing games I would not have this problem and I admit that.

02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:06.000
Which is true but let me tell you.

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:11.000
I've shown you the dance skits I have done with my friends at conventions.

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:15.000
You can see I can move pretty quickly and I can keep in tone.

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:21.000
I want you to know how much I hurt when we were off the stage.

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:23.000
How much I hurt during practice.

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:28.000
How many times I have tripped over my feet and slammed my face into the goddamn floor.

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:33.000
I guess we share something in that regard because the day after a Rocky Horror performance.

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:39.000
Which even though I'm retired I got dragged back on stage because they really really badly needed somebody.

02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:42.000
So I got dragged back on stage to do Brad at the last show.

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:47.000
And so I got to do like fucking coordinated dance routines, kick lines and all this stuff right.

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:52.000
And the next day I was just like kill me, kill me now, kill me.

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:54.000
I was sore.

02:25:54.000 --> 02:26:01.000
This is why when I go to cons I liquor up before I go down to the informal dance and dance all that booze off.

02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:03.000
That way I don't wake up trying to like.

02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:05.000
I can't feel my legs, can't feel my legs.

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:07.000
I got to remember my part though.

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:11.000
That's the problem if I drink I do that whole thing where I'm like oh yeah I know my part.

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:16.000
I know and then I just I'm up there and I look like an asshole.

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:18.000
But we still love you.

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:20.000
Thank you, thank you very much I appreciate it.

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:23.000
Alright anything else you want to point out about what I'm doing wrong in my life Rama?

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:27.000
Anything wrong with your life is just that.

02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:30.000
I just want you to know I'm here for you.

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:32.000
I got your back.

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:34.000
Alright tell you what.

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:37.000
Oh no you're not going to be there when I'm in New York.

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:40.000
Look Rob I already said this.

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:46.000
I realize that week I will be spending that week with my favorite gay and lesbian couple.

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:51.000
And I'd be damned if I'm going to spend equal time with them all.

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:53.000
It'll work one way or another.

02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:54.000
Alright.

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:56.000
You bet your sweet ass it'll work.

02:26:56.000 --> 02:27:02.000
We'll get up on a DDR machine together and I'll feel much better about it.

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:05.000
And Mako-chan will be there to record us making fools of ourselves.

02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:08.000
I didn't say this shit could be on YouTube.

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:10.000
Who said anything about it being on YouTube?

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:13.000
It'll be on the secret Bogstash network.

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:15.000
Alright secret club's fine.

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:18.000
Alright Rama I'm going to let you go but take care.

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:19.000
You too stay fabulous.

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:20.000
Alright bye.

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:21.000
Alright.

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:23.000
Alright.

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:28.000
Orange Lounge Radio all one word on Skype or 1877 game OLR.

02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:31.000
But first I did promise Dark Soccer we could have a moment to vent.

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:39.000
Cause sometimes you know here on this show we need to dive into a long standing tradition here and let off some steam in a segment we call the FUs of the week.

02:27:39.000 --> 02:28:01.000
FU to the GOP a major FU.

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:14.000
FU to basically anyone who had anything to do with that piece of shit legislation that their Dr. Evil laughing asshole selves have passed the house.

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:15.000
Fuck you.

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:16.000
Fuck all of you.

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:21.000
But bless the lady who put in the bill to remove their exemptions.

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:24.000
Now they're also subject to the same piece of shit.

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:25.000
That's it.

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:32.000
My FU of the week goes to the 100 degree day we had this week.

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:33.000
It is fucking May.

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:34.000
It is not summer time yet.

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:35.000
It is not August.

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:36.000
Who was it here?

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:38.000
Well lucky fucking you.

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:39.000
Where did you go?

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:40.000
Oh you were in the bay area that day.

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:41.000
That's right.

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:43.000
It was still pretty hot.

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:44.000
Drinking cocktails.

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:46.000
For the bay area it was hot that day.

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:47.000
Like 89.

02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:49.000
But it is fucking early May.

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:50.000
Triple degree weather.

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:51.000
No ma'am.

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:52.000
No ma'am.

02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:55.000
Loki your FU of the week.

02:28:55.000 --> 02:29:01.000
I guess just FU to being tired.

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:03.000
Because I'm tired.

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:04.000
I don't want to be tired.

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:06.000
I want to be productive and work on my game.

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:08.000
My brain is like YouTube videos.

02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:13.000
Let's watch more fucking videos about 3D printing.

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:15.000
The same videos you've already watched several times.

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:18.000
Let's watch a funny video about what's wrong with said movie.

02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:21.000
I waste so much time.

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:23.000
My brain is tired.

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:25.000
Your brain is very tired.

02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:29.000
Well someday the kids will be 18 and out of the house and then maybe you'll finish your game.

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:33.000
There it is.

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:34.000
Your FUs of the week.

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:35.000
It's been a while.

02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:37.000
It felt good to let loose a little bit of steam here.

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:40.000
And some folks in chat.

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:41.000
Let's see.

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:45.000
Act F saying weather definitely deserves a permanent spot in the FUs.

02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:48.000
Act F says all week over 100 degree weather.

02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:50.000
This week it's fucking cold.

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:52.000
I didn't even look at.

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:53.000
I heard it was going to rain today.

02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:57.000
It was supposed to be thundering and rainy this weekend.

02:29:57.000 --> 02:30:01.000
And it's supposed to be up in the upper 80s later this week.

02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:06.000
As much as the rain bothers me when it's non-stop.

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:08.000
Like I've mentioned before I get affected by seasons.

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:12.000
And as much as the non-stop rain bothers me.

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:14.000
A day or two here and there I don't mind.

02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:18.000
So I was kind of like thinking oh it might be nice to have a little bit of rain.

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:20.000
And then I don't have to water all the plants and the lawn.

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:24.000
Now right now the 10 day forecast says maybe rain next Monday.

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:28.000
But for now the next week 90 degrees on Tuesday.

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:30.000
But otherwise the rest of the week mid 70s.

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:31.000
That's not too bad.

02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:35.000
That's the May weather I expect living in Northern California in the valley.

02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:36.000
Alright.

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:39.000
Well that is going to do it tonight.

02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:41.000
I'm sorry if you did not get through on the Skype line.

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:43.000
But you can always give us an email.

02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:46.000
Participate at Orangelaunchradio.com.

02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:48.000
You can also tweet us at OLR.

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:51.000
But I believe that is going to do it for another episode of our show tonight.

02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:54.000
I want to thank you guys for tuning in and supporting the show.

02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:57.000
If you like what you heard here at Orange Lawns Radio.

02:30:57.000 --> 02:30:59.000
Please tell a friend or five about the show.

02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:00.000
Help us spread the word.

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:02.000
Because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:05.000
But if your voices aren't here we can't air them.

02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:07.000
We do like seeing some new names once in a while.

02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:09.000
Although we love our old names too.

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:10.000
Don't get us wrong.

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:13.000
A nice five star review on a site like iTunes goes a long way.

02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:16.000
Seriously if you've never taken the 30 seconds to do a five star review on iTunes.

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:17.000
Please, please help us out.

02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:19.000
Because those go a long way in getting noticed.

02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:23.000
Because there's probably easily a thousand video game podcasts on iTunes at this point.

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:26.000
So it's sometimes hard to stay above the line.

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:29.000
Even if you are 15 years old that doesn't really buy you jack shit.

02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:30.000
So anyway.

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:32.000
That's it for that.

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:34.000
So let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:36.000
Loki your final thoughts tonight.

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:41.000
I'm going to work more on this new game until I start another new game.

02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:42.000
And another new game.

02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:43.000
And another new game.

02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:44.000
No but this one actually sounds.

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:45.000
I have an idea now.

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:47.000
Because that was kind of where I was at before.

02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:48.000
Like I wanted to do.

02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:51.000
So actually I'm still going to do something with you on this.

02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:53.000
And I thought that that's why I started this one.

02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:55.000
But I still don't know what you're going to do yet.

02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:59.000
We talked about programming so I could learn Unity.

02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:03.000
That came up on an episode when the guys from Little Tanks were here.

02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:04.000
Yes.

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:06.000
I do have to say though.

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:08.000
What I'm coming up with so far is tank related.

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:09.000
But not like their game.

02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:11.000
I was like don't rip off the guest game.

02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:12.000
No I'm not ripping off their game.

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:13.000
No no no.

02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:14.000
Completely different type of.

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:16.000
I mean it's an arcade type game.

02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:19.000
But different looking type game.

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:21.000
Because they could sue you like Bethesda did.

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:22.000
I'm kidding.

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:23.000
Yeah yeah.

02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:25.000
I'm surprised you know.

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:27.000
There's a tank you know.

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:30.000
The word tank is used somewhere then they can.

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:31.000
I don't know.

02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:33.000
Fuck Bethesda.

02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:34.000
Seriously.

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:35.000
Dark Sakura.

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:36.000
Your final thought tonight.

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:41.000
Some of my photos from last night turned out really nice.

02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:43.000
From seeing Bianca Del Rio.

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:46.000
I was just looking at my pictures.

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:48.000
I like that dress.

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:49.000
That black sequined thing.

02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:51.000
I want one.

02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:54.000
And my final thought for the night is I had a good time last night.

02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:58.000
It was very like doing dinner at a fancy-ish restaurant.

02:32:58.000 --> 02:32:59.000
But not too fancy.

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:02.000
And then a show and then dessert with my friends.

02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:05.000
That was a very pleasant evening.

02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:08.000
It was a very nice night and I need to do that more often.

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:11.000
But I need to make sure I have time for video games as well.

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:12.000
That's very important as well.

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:14.000
So we hope you guys have time for video games this week.

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:18.000
We will see you in seven days and we'll do this all over again.

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:20.000
But until then, thanks for listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
