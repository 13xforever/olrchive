Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Tonight, our headlines include E3, ether show rumors, E3 playing, D3 teasers, and well, E3. Sound expected?

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Then stay tuned instead to hear about Overwatch, more Project Rap Rabbit, and autonomous driving fears played out in gaming.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And yes, it all starts right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight on May the 21st of 2017, episode number 687 of our show.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And joining me, as always, not just yet, DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
She's literally on her way, she had another event just before the show tonight, so she'll be joining us in a few moments here as she comes in live.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
But I do have some other folks here in the studio to say hello to, of course, Techmaster Loki!

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Hello.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Hi Loki, how are you?

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm fine.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Hey, you got a brand new toy.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Yes I did.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It's shiny, it's shiny and it needed the wifi password.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Yes it did.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
What is this? You bought a new laptop, right?

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I bought a new laptop, yes.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And that keyboard kind of glows like my keyboard.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It's RGB, and it matches my Tron background that I have.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Oh, very cool. So what all went into it? So you got a new laptop because your other one was kind of...

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
My other one is kind of, it's full of malware, and I just didn't feel like redoing everything on it.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Also, it's overheating. I've had bad luck with old Asus laptops.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The old ones that they had, not so much the Republic of Gaming stuff that they have now, but the old ones were like not thermally designed well.

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And so they would overheat. In fact, this was my first laptop, my first Asus laptop.

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Pretty much melted when Titanfall hit it.

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And then I had to buy this last one, which was a replacement.

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It was kind of one I had to pick up.

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It was whatever was available at Fry's at the time, and it was an AMD, an ATI...

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Well, I guess it's an AMD chip now too. The GPU, CPU, and an APU processor.

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I just wasn't all that satisfied with it. It was slightly better spec-wise than my old laptop.

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:26,000
But it was getting old. I mean, it was like a few years old when I bought it, and now it's three more years old and just needed something new.

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So I got a brand new laptop. It's got like a Core i7 in it, 16GB of RAM, a GTX 1060 with 6GB of RAM.

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Pretty much can run anything. Oh, and it has a 5TB hard drive in it because I'll never fucking fill that up.

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You have more space on that than I do on my desktop that's not even that old.

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Exactly.

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
That's a lot of porn. That's a lot of porn.

41
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Yeah, it could be a lot of porn. But who downloads porn nowadays?

42
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Oh, it's all streaming. Of course.

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's all available on the internet. There's really no point.

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,000
No, I mean, yeah. I could literally... I was backing up my laptop, my old one, and just kind of copying over what I needed.

45
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Because most of it was just Unity Project stuff, and I didn't have to really move any games over because I needed to download that crap again.

46
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:21,000
But it felt like it was a lot of space, and I look at my hard drive's usage, and it's like, nothing.

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It's like, come on. Is this it? Seriously?

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Let me introduce our live chatroom, of course, because we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific and 9 o'clock Eastern at The Voice of Geeks Network.

49
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
vognetwork.com, right after The Bobby Black Wolf Show.

50
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And if you are listening live, you can join us in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

51
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And Bobby Black Wolf, who I just referred to, says in chat, or I should say asks, what's the Wi-Fi password?

52
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's blackwolfsucks123!

53
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Because, you know, all passwords have to have numbers and punctuation in them.

54
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Bobby's also asking, does Loki's old laptop make him want to cry?

55
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Like, did you get hit with want to cry? Is that why?

56
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
No, I didn't want to cry.

57
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm the one at risk for that because I'm still on Windows XP, where all the IT people out there are going,

58
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,000
No, I've got, um, you know, I've got, it was, it should be still fine if I reset it.

59
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It just runs really hot for no reason.

60
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And I have my, you know, I bought a new laptop cooling pad for this laptop, but I think it's too small.

61
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
But for the other one, it actually works really well.

62
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So, I may just end up wiping it, putting Minecraft on, give it to my son or something, you know, to use.

63
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Oh, that's a, that's a cute idea. Like, put little kitty games.

64
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I mean, it can still run, I mean, that's what I was playing Minecraft on.

65
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Make him learn the way we did. Put Number Munchers, Odell Lake, put the classics.

66
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
He's already playing other stuff. I mean, he's got the Wii U and everything. He's not going to go for that.

67
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:51,000
But, um, yeah, I mean, it was just, I don't know, like, it has, like, some Chromium malware thing on it right now that's really pissing me off.

68
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
And I tried removing it. I think that's what kind of borked a bunch of stuff.

69
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
So, I just said, ah, fuck it. I'm not going to worry about fixing this laptop right now. It's kind of falling apart.

70
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Just going to get a new one in. I got a great deal. This one is actually used.

71
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I mean, it's practically brand new, except for, like, a couple tiny scratches on the top of the case, which is, like, who gives a shit?

72
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Um, and it's fantastic. It's a, uh, Electrix, or, um, I think they call them, like, they go by a bunch of different names.

73
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Clevo is another one. It's basically, it's Clevo shells. They have these laptop shells that a bunch of different companies fill with components.

74
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:33,000
And they're really nice. I mean, just no, um, bloatware installed on it. Just a clean copy of Windows.

75
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:41,000
And it just runs fantastic. I played, you know, Grand Theft Auto fully maxed out at, like, over 60 frames per second yesterday.

76
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I was like, I can't even run this game on my old laptop. It was fucking awesome.

77
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
All right. Well, I'm going to ask you about some of the games you've been playing on your new laptop.

78
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
But I figure that's probably best to hold on to How Was Your Gaming Week, which we'll get to in a little while.

79
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm going to have you start us with our kickoff topic in a little bit, though, with that story that we have.

80
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
But first, of course, I want to introduce our other folks in the studio here while we still wait for Dark Soccer to arrive.

81
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
We have folks that you've heard on the show plenty of times before say hello to JD, joining us again tonight.

82
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Hi.

83
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Hi. How are you?

84
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Doing pretty well.

85
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Yeah, good, good. What's new with you since the last time we saw you?

86
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I moved to Japantown.

87
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:24,000
That's right. So you're within walking distance of all that fun stuff that's, you know, everybody likes to crash San Francisco in the area during the Sakura Cherry Blossom Festival, right?

88
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Yeah, I actually moved during the second weekend of that.

89
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Oh, of that. What good timing.

90
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'm sure that was a lot of fun. Just pull up the U-Haul right next to all that other...

91
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Made it work.

92
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Yeah, you made it work. Good, good. You survived?

93
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I think so.

94
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,000
And now you're within walking distance of that cute little arcade there that has, like, pop-in music and some of our old music game favorites, right?

95
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Yeah. Two pop-ins, a DDRX3, a Rhythm Tengoku arcade, which is not something I'd seen anywhere else, and a Taiko... I think it's Taiko 9.

96
00:06:51,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Nice. Well, that's fun. So, congrats on the move. And good thing you got out of the city this weekend because Beta Breakers is going on right now, or was earlier today, right?

97
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Yeah, it was today. It's a mess.

98
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,000
A lot of people are probably still hungover. If you don't know what this is, it's like only in San Francisco is Beta Breakers. It's...

99
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Alan is also joining us. Hubby, Alan is here.

100
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Hello.

101
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Hi, how are you?

102
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm good.

103
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You were about to explain for us what Beta Breakers is.

104
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I was gonna say it's sort of a race question mark. A silly walk fitness question mark.

105
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Basically, they walk from the west side to the east side... no, east side to the west side of San Francisco in costumes, and there's lots of day drinking, and lots of people are naked, and it's basically... it just shuts down the city and makes traffic a shit show.

106
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Sounds very San Francisco. Anyway, let me talk to JD a little more, and I'm gonna come back to you, Alan, in a little bit for our little kickoff topic tonight.

107
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:56,000
But JD, so I guess this kind of gets into our gaming week a little bit, but I know you've been playing console stuff as has I. We have other things we can talk about, but you and I took a little arcade adventure yesterday.

108
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Yeah.

109
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:08,000
We went out to the arcade that I talked about a couple weeks ago on the show, where... because I wanted you to be able to play Pump It Up, which I knew they had. I wanted you to see this little bootleg machine that took over our show for two weeks, right?

110
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I wanted you to see like all the cool stuff they had. And then, so we got there and found that there's more, like the machines have been mating.

111
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:22,000
There was now a Sound Voltex machine and a U-Beat. Two of them. Two U-Beats. Which is kind of the one...

112
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Is this all like, what's his name? The guy that...

113
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It is.

114
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I thought so, because he keeps moving his machines.

115
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:36,000
All the stuff that used to... it's like the presence that used to be at Scandi is now over here. It took us a little while to figure that out, but that's apparently what's happening.

116
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Well, his name is on the Sound Voltex machine.

117
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Yes.

118
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
When you log in with EMUs, like it says it's his.

119
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Yeah, yeah. Which I finally got to play Sound Voltex for the first time. Because every time I go to round one, like even when we go early, we'll go to round one like open.

120
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Because that's when it's the least crowded, right? We always go to these things early. That's what old people do. They get up early and they go to mall walks, right?

121
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:06,000
They walk around the mall. So we did the mall walking at round one. And there's actually the Sound Voltex machines will also have people on them that early.

122
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:18,000
So I usually never am able to get in and play that game, but I was finally able to play it. It was fun. I liked it. I still kind of like... I kind of like Neon FM a little more, I think.

123
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Which might be... I don't know. That might be Sacrilegion, some circles. I don't know. Maybe it's just because this...

124
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
They're different games.

125
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:34,000
They're very different games. They're also very different song lists. And I don't... it's hard to explain. Like I just don't... like the J-pop stuff doesn't resonate with me the way that it used to.

126
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I mean, a good portion of the song list these days is Vocaloid and Toho, so...

127
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:52,000
That's very true as well, so. But what was I gonna say? So I... but when I played Neon FM, like my hands were hurting. Like just from slamming all the... you know, because it's basically... it's basically pop music, but like, you know, five...

128
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
With flat pads instead of popping out buttons.

129
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
But I had a good time. So we had a good time on our arcade adventure. Was there a favorite thing that you played?

130
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Oh, man. You know... I think it's probably... I'm gonna be lame. It's... it's... it was a tie between the StepMania cabinet and the DDR 2014.

131
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Because you're old school. You like dancing. Even though those pads were moving as you were dancing. That's so funny.

132
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Oh, man. Yeah. They... so I played doubles a lot. And these pads were not anchored down nearly enough. So I was playing and they moved probably like a foot and a half or something. And I had to move them back after each song.

133
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Alright.

134
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I thought they had feet on those things. They probably do, but they weren't using them.

135
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:41,000
They weren't planted down very well. Alright. Well, I'm going to introduce here because she walked into the studio as we were having that little discussion.

136
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Hi, Dark Soccer or Jamie Summers.

137
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Hi, I'm on Sister Time.

138
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Oh, because you're running late. I got it. I was like, wait a minute, wait a minute. I've heard... I've heard gay time. I've heard a lot of different, you know, descriptions for why somebody runs late, but Sister Time.

139
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
That's the same family.

140
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Yeah, it's all in the same family. It really is. I thought you'd still have full white face like I saw on Facebook earlier.

141
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I actually came home relatively in enough time, but I was so exhausted that I passed out. Like I sat on my bed. I washed my face off. Everything was fine. I sat on my bed. Midna comes in and then dead.

142
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
The heat here right now is no joke though. Like it's already summer weather.

143
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
We had some nice shade. We were all shady.

144
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Of course.

145
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
But I got to meet some of the San Francisco sisters and made some new friends.

146
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Good.

147
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:38,000
And it was just nice seeing, you know, seeing the smiles and recognition and people seeing their mood light up by having the sisters and pride.

148
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
In that freaking heat. I mean, the fact that you guys did all that.

149
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
That wasn't terrible.

150
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Really? That's good.

151
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Well, out in the sun. Yeah, it was terra bad. But in the shade, it was really nice. We sat out. We had wine.

152
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Okay. That's why you passed out drinking in this heat.

153
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Girl.

154
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
No, I had like a little sippy cup of wine with a straw in it because I was wearing white face.

155
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
So I was drinking my Prosecco through a straw, which is classy as fuck.

156
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Like a lady.

157
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Like a lady.

158
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Yeah.

159
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
But there was like a nice like an Italian ice place. It was really yummy.

160
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Oh, yeah.

161
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Especially in the weather. And I found out that lemon and cherry mix very well.

162
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Yes, they do.

163
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
And there were vendors there and there was no parade because it's Davis.

164
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Right.

165
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
But there were lots of vendors there and people singing and cheerleaders.

166
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Mm hmm.

167
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
You know, they would like you pay them a dollar for their cheer thing and they would do a jump or a cartwheel.

168
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
One of the gals from Drag Race was supposed to be there, right? Trinity?

169
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Trinity was supposed to be there, but I didn't see her.

170
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Oh, that's too bad.

171
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:44,000
But I also left when the things were still going on because I as a postulant, I have to stay with my big sister or at least one of the other sisters.

172
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:55,000
And since they were all leaving to go to the coronation tonight or the investment for the local court, I got the OK to stay with the San Francisco sisters.

173
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
So we just hung out dishing and it was great.

174
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It's a lip sync. What part of that don't you understand?

175
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Just kidding.

176
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
OK. OK.

177
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
It just clicked for her. It just clicked for her when I was raising.

178
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, don't because some people haven't watched it.

179
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
All right.

180
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
All right. I'm just going to say this.

181
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I am disappointed doubly.

182
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Video games.

183
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
This is a video game show.

184
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
The other show is about this.

185
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
But that bitch.

186
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
All right. Anyway.

187
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
OK.

188
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I had a Tyra moment.

189
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I had a Tyra moment.

190
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
We all did. We all did.

191
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
All right. Look.

192
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Speaking of that bitch, Alan.

193
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Just kidding.

194
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Hearts.

195
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
How have you been?

196
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
We haven't heard from you in a while.

197
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Fine.

198
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I know your day's office switched around a little bit.

199
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I'm on a new schedule.

200
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Yeah, you're able to you're able to join us now on Sunday night.

201
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
So I like that a lot.

202
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
So I want to talk VR with you a little bit.

203
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
So you got a new toy this week, right?

204
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Yes.

205
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Tell us a little bit about it.

206
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I got a Galaxy S8 on launch day.

207
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
And they had it because my my previous phone was literally dying and I was practically unusable.

208
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
So the timing was great.

209
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
And they had a promotion where if you got a Galaxy S8,

210
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
which is the first phone that they've released since the Note 7 like was blowing up,

211
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
like in people's hands and spraying, spraying battery acid everywhere.

212
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
So this was kind of a big deal release.

213
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Literally banned in all airports.

214
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Yeah.

215
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:29,000
And you got if you got the S8 in a certain window, you got a Gear VR, which is Samsung's at home

216
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Oculus equivalent VR device that uses your phone.

217
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
You actually pop your phone into the front of it.

218
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
And it arrived Thursday and I've been messing around with it.

219
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:48,000
So tell us a little bit about what you like what you've been using the device for.

220
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I did get a code that had a bunch of like cheap games on it for free.

221
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I've been checking them out and I bought a couple for like four or five bucks each.

222
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
You've been spending money on that? No, I'm just kidding.

223
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
My favorite one so far is the scary one.

224
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Not because it's scary, but I just feel like the way that the hand controller is used as your flashlight

225
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
and the way the VR looks when you're walking through the house.

226
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
What's the name of it? Do you know?

227
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Affected the Manner.

228
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Okay.

229
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:21,000
There are three other or two other episodes, but they're for the Oculus proper

230
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
because the Oculus Rift you hook up to a PC, I believe, and the PC runs the game.

231
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Yeah, right.

232
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
And it's pipe to the thing. This all has to be run on your phone.

233
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,000
So even though the S8 is, I think, the strongest processing power of all the phones on the market,

234
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
at least I would hope it is, it's still not going to be at the level of what an Oculus can do

235
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
simply because you hook an Oculus up to a computer.

236
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
And Tiger Claw on our chat is asking, is it the regular S8 or the S8 Plus?

237
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
S8 Plus.

238
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Yeah, I was going to say you have the larger phone like I do with the iPhone 6 Plus.

239
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
They do have, I don't know if you've tried it yet, they have something that you can actually run on your PC

240
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
and stream it to your phone like actual Oculus proper games using that.

241
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Oh.

242
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Something to try.

243
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Yeah, for sure.

244
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Yeah, I wonder how that would.

245
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Since you probably have a pretty powerful PC then, you know, that might.

246
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Yeah.

247
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Or you could use Bluetooth or Wi-Fi or whatever.

248
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Yeah, you could even use my PC to do it too because we just upgraded mine.

249
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I was trying to get you to play one or two games before the show so you could talk about it a little.

250
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Yeah, I've had a lot of personal stuff going on today so I wasn't able to get around to doing that.

251
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
But I'm curious to check it out.

252
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
But let's.

253
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Okay, look.

254
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
This is Orange Tons Radio.

255
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Y'all heard the warning in the beginning.

256
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
This is an adult audiences show.

257
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Yeah.

258
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:36,000
So let's not hold back because everybody fucking knows what we did with that thing first.

259
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Yes.

260
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Of course, it's VR porn.

261
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I mean, that's.

262
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

263
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
That's what we did at the Oculus Dev Kids.

264
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Let's look at porn on this.

265
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Ding, ding, ding.

266
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Even Bobby Black Wolf and his family friendly show.

267
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Fantastic.

268
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
He knows.

269
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
It's like so weird.

270
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I mean.

271
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
It's not sexy.

272
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
That man knows.

273
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
That man knows.

274
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,000
The very first time I saw this VR stuff, you know, he was like, okay, here's the roller coaster sim.

275
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
And isn't that kind of neat?

276
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
And here's the, okay, here's the walk around the house and look at all this stuff, sim.

277
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
And then, you know, I'm doing all these things.

278
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
He's like, all right, I know you want to see the porn.

279
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Here's the porn.

280
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
So I got to see.

281
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
You just need to combine the two because everyone does the roller coasters and porn.

282
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
We need a porno coaster.

283
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
And then you download, you know, glory, hallelujah.

284
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Is that what, is that what y'all sang in church today, sisters?

285
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
All right.

286
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Here's the thing.

287
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Here's the thing.

288
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Well, on that note, believe it or not, here's the thing.

289
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Bobby Black Wolf being a heterosexual male.

290
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I know that the porn I was going to see on that was going to be, you know, a lady who is going to walk over and

291
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
fillet me in the first person.

292
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
And that was, that was what the porno was that I watched.

293
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:51,000
However, I don't know if any, I'm sure any podcast has talked about VR and VR porn probably has talked about that.

294
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
But has any podcast talked about gay pornography in the VR?

295
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Because we're about to go there, ladies and gentlemen.

296
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I know it exists.

297
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Yes, it exists.

298
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
And I'm not going to get super detailed, but I didn't say Alan wouldn't get it super detailed.

299
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Alan, tell us about the gay porn on the VR.

300
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:22,000
The fact that it's first person so that it's happening in quotey fingers to you is very strange and jarring because everything is up close in your face.

301
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Like, you see everything.

302
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
You see, you see glory, glory, hallelujah.

303
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,000
You see Christmas and New Year's.

304
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:41,000
And it's like, there are certain models that probably don't want to be in front of that camera because they're like, you know what, my butthole isn't that photogenic.

305
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
You could tell that was a freshly waxed vehicle.

306
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Yes.

307
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Like that was just, it was a bit much.

308
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:55,000
And they say that that bleaching it is an urban legend, but I'm convinced that it's real because I think this boy had it done.

309
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Anyway.

310
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
And basically, I hear the clicks across America in the world of people shutting off the show.

311
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Those are like clicks.

312
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I hope, I hope.

313
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
But anyway, dialing it back just a little bit.

314
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Like, what, what?

315
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
These things are all like first person and all that.

316
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
But here's, here's the $50,000 question.

317
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Is it hot?

318
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
No.

319
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,000
So the other thing that threw me off about it was that it was just a static video.

320
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Like, I mean, it was, it wasn't interactive at all.

321
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:31,000
And I mean, when we were talking about VR and this heavily immersive experience, I was kind of expecting to have more agency.

322
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:39,000
You know, like, you can see, like, even in the lobby of the Oculus, you walk around, you look at things, you do stuff, it responds to you.

323
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
This was just, it felt like a 3D movie or something.

324
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
And it wasn't.

325
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:51,000
There are some that have 360 view where if you want to turn your back on the boy wanking in the bed and just look out the window, you can.

326
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Yeah.

327
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
You're like, ooh, I'm sorry.

328
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
What have I done with my life?

329
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I'm interrupting you.

330
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
You're like, I'll give you some privacy and you turn around.

331
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I feel like it needed to go farther to do something for me.

332
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Yeah.

333
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
And when I, I started laughing and when I put, I'm like, you have to watch this one.

334
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Cause I found some free trailers that were like 40 seconds long.

335
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
You were like screaming.

336
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I was, I was screaming, laughing, like doing the full on, like, like I just, I, it was, it was funny.

337
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Porn's funny.

338
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
It's not hot.

339
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
It's not hot at all.

340
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
At all.

341
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:33,000
And I thought maybe like, it's going to be a scene just in 3d where I'm like this weird ghost person watching them, but no, it's through the perspective of it happening to you, which makes it far more shocking.

342
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:40,000
It's like the, it's like the first time I can look down and not see my stomach just hanging there.

343
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
You're like, oh, I have abs.

344
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I want, I want it for this.

345
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
That was the hottest fucking part of it.

346
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Get, get the, get the other guy out of the way.

347
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I want to look down and see abs.

348
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
JV wants to jump in here.

349
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
See, now I have to invent glory.

350
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Hallelujah.

351
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Because it would come with like, it would come with a peripheral.

352
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Yeah, I bet it would bitch.

353
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,000
It would come with an interactive peripheral that's based off of stimulation from the game.

Copyright Jamie forever.

355
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:14,000
That's, that's where they've already beat you to it because they already have devices that work with those, those, we saw that three years ago.

356
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
The E3, feel three or whatever that thing was.

357
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I think that was before VR.

358
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I didn't think that had like attachments.

359
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
You just did it.

360
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
That thing had like a little wanker.

361
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Like what is, what do they call that thing?

362
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
The wank mode.

363
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
No.

364
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
The flashlight.

365
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Thank you.

366
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
It's a flesh, I knew you'd know it.

367
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:39,000
It was, it was a fleshlight type attachment that you used when you were doing that, but it was more like a second life type of game, I think.

368
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Yeah, it was.

369
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:49,000
And I remember boy play girl, whatever, but see, but see that, that I want to make that an OLR dream game now.

370
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
All right.

371
00:21:50,000 --> 00:22:01,000
And I, but to, to defend Bobby's honor a little bit, he is in chat saying, Rob, I would have totally had it available for you if it was around and I was showing you the DK one.

372
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
They just had, it's true that didn't come around.

373
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
They hadn't invented gay porn yet.

374
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
That came later.

375
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
There's just one website that I found.

376
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Yeah.

377
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Cause I was like, there's gotta be something.

378
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Exactly right.

379
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
And I just found this one site.

380
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Yeah.

381
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
So the games that I have.

382
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Oh yeah.

383
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Video games.

384
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Right.

385
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Well, one issue that I have, especially with affected the manner, the scary game is that they're all, they're like basically four different paths.

386
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
You can go down, but they all end ultimately the same way.

387
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
It's not really a game.

388
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:36,000
And I noticed that a lot of these VR experiences, they're not even like gone home or something where it's like a first person narrative.

389
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
You're sort of like walking through and like, Oh, this is trippy.

390
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Oh, I really like how it uses the flashlight effect and then jump scare.

391
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
And then it's over.

392
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
And it's like, there's no puzzles.

393
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
And it's, that's not the only game that was like that.

394
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:56,000
And so it's kind of weird to find out, is this really a game or is this just like a neat thing to last me like 20 minutes of just.

395
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I think it's still because all VR, all this VR stuff is still in that gimmick phase.

396
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
It's just like, you know, with the DS and we, and so they don't really know how to utilize the hardware well.

397
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
So it's all these experimental, like, Oh, that's a neat idea.

398
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Let's do that a million times, you know, not really utilizing it in an innovative way.

399
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Like I think right now, the best thing we have like for VR, probably Resident Evil 7 is probably going to be one of the strongest examples of like a AAA game done exclusively in VR.

400
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Well, PlayStation VR is doing a lot right in that department.

401
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:40,000
But in, but in a way, I mean, just to be fair, you know, when we, when we talked a lot about this, when Facebook bought Oculus and it was like, Oh my God, why would Facebook do this?

402
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
And that all this stuff.

403
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
And we were kind of like, well, wait a minute, maybe there's more to VR than just gaming.

404
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:53,000
So to be fair, you know, a lot of these experiences and videos, you know, I know we're having fun talking about porn, but we've, we've seen other stuff in VR too.

405
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I mean, I remember seeing a Cirque du Soleil thing.

406
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I saw like the, the last Paul McCartney concert at Candlestick Park, you know, before they closed Candlestick Park down, they, there was a VR thing for that.

407
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
So like, you know, it's definitely shown that there can be experiences.

408
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,000
And I would think, especially when it comes to mobile devices and stuff, games are not going to be the strong point of mobile devices.

409
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:17,000
It's going to be these more like immersive, like, Oh, it's almost like I was there type of experience.

410
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:24,000
You know, like I'm surprised maybe that did exist, but Coachella didn't have like a VR thing where you could be a Coachella virtually.

411
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
It probably did exist.

412
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I just didn't see it.

413
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
There's this thing on here like that where it's Major Lazer and Diplo.

414
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Yeah.

415
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
And watch him on stage.

416
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,000
But now you go to PlayStation and PlayStation's bread and butter is games.

417
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
So I would hope that the strongest stuff over there is going to be games.

418
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
And so far that does seem to be true between Resident Evil 7.

419
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
It's hit and miss.

420
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
A lot of people love the rush of blood.

421
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I love rush of blood.

422
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I think that's for if you're going to get PlayStation VR, pick that up first.

423
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Twenty bucks.

424
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Great value for what you get.

425
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
It's such a great game.

426
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Well, and then Thumper was one because I'm thinking of that.

427
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I was thinking that because that came out on Switch and JD.

428
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
You were thinking like, do I want to get because I like music games, but rhythm violence.

429
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
What the hell is that?

430
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
So I was like, all right, let's put this on because I have it on PlayStation four.

431
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Let's play it.

432
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,000
And I was like, you have to imagine this in VR because it's like twice as good when it's in VR.

433
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
The thing about Thumper was that it just wasn't musical enough for me to really get going with it.

434
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Like it was definitely rhythmic.

435
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
It's not J-pop.

436
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Well, it wasn't even that.

437
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
There was no melody.

438
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Yeah, like it was just all percussive.

439
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,000
And I'm like, you know, I can kind of keep the beat and stuff, but it just wasn't fun the same way.

440
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Interesting because Bobby points out a lot of those videos are also available on PlayStation VR.

441
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
The Paul McCartney one is in the Jaunt VR app.

442
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Well, I guess and I guess that doesn't make sense because technically, I mean, yes,

443
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:47,000
I say the PlayStation is bread and butter is games, but the reality is it's also a Netflix device.

444
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
They sell movies on it.

445
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:54,000
They do these this live events viewer thing that I'm sure later in the show, we'll talk about E3 and all that.

446
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
You know, that is all part of PlayStation stuff as well.

447
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
But even when it comes down to Sony, they're a media company.

448
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
That's true.

449
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
That's true. Not just televisions.

450
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Then the Oculus is actually what powers the Gear VR.

451
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Like it's their storefront and it's their, I guess, API or UI that you navigate on the phone.

452
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:18,000
So there are 3D movies like X-Men Days of Future Past that I could buy on this to see a 3D movie.

453
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:25,000
But the idea of even just laying in bed with this thing on my head watching a full movie for two hours seems very strange.

454
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I don't want to I'd rather watch it on an at home 3D TV, which we have.

455
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Yeah, but to be fair, it sucks.

456
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Like the 3D TV, it sucks.

457
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Those glasses don't even work anymore. It sucks.

458
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
The game that I was playing that was actually a really good puzzle game is called Rangi.

459
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:50,000
And I don't want to say it's portalesque, but basically you're in a room and you see the door that you're supposed to exit through and the color tile above the door is orange.

460
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
And you look and you see like a blue beam and a red beam and a yellow beam.

461
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Well, if you're trying to get the color orange, the blue beam is like a red hair.

462
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Like you don't care about the blue beam because you want to slide these tiles over so that the red and the yellow merge.

463
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,000
And then you direct the orange beam at the door and then the door unlocks and you go to the next room.

464
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
That I thought was really cool because you look up and you're like, oh, there's a cliff up there.

465
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:21,000
So then you click and you teleport up there and you find that there's another tile for you to flip to reflect the laser or whatever.

466
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I thought that was a neat game. So I want to play more of that.

467
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:38,000
And then I have Drop Dead, which is a zombie game, but it's more like Time Crisis or where you lower your thing to reload and it's very fast and the zombies are just running at you.

468
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
So it's not really scary at all.

469
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:47,000
And Dragonfront, which is kind of like chess meets Magic the Gathering, but it's in, of course, 3D VR.

470
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:53,000
So you take your card and you put it down and it pops up and it turns into a little knight.

471
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Oh, it's like I have judgment.

472
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Yeah. Yeah.

473
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Wow. OK.

474
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Well, that. Yeah. But those had a real element to it. This is all in a virtual space.

475
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Fair enough. Yeah.

476
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
But it's neat.

477
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Now, let me ask this question.

478
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:13,000
I was going to say I wanted to try to get the Power Rangers thing they have for it to show Shane because the first we're like, hey, Shane, I have a gear VR.

479
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,000
There's porn on it. And he was immediately like, I'm not listening to anything you're ever going to say after this.

480
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Right. Shutting down.

481
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
We offended his delegate sensibilities.

482
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Right.

483
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,000
But I imagine if I had the Power Rangers movie VR experience on it, he would have tried it.

484
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Gimme, gimme, gimme.

485
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,000
It's exclusive to some weird device that's also competing in the Oculus gear VR space.

486
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
So I don't remember. Bobby might know.

487
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Was it a dream?

488
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
I think possibly.

489
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:44,000
So, yeah, I was looking for that, but I'm like, no, it's an exclusive because I want to see Power Rangers in VR.

490
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Well, thank you for playing some games in VR and, you know, telling us a little bit about it, especially since I failed to do so this week.

491
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
But let me ask this.

492
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,000
So since you have been doing a little bit of VR gaming this week, you're now the show's VR expert.

493
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Oh, I guess, I guess, Loki.

494
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Also, you said conditionally that the only reason why you were trying it out the first night that I got it is because it literally uses my phone and the device so that I couldn't record you using it.

495
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
That was only when we were watching Christmas and New Year's.

496
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
So, okay.

497
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
So what was I gonna say? Oh, I know.

498
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
So let me ask this about your kind of VR experience.

499
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:27,000
So games that you play a lot of online, Mass Effect Andromeda, I know is one you're still playing a lot.

500
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Despite everything we talked about, about that show in the past, or about that game in the past couple of weeks, you are still very loyal to Andromeda.

501
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Yes.

502
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
You play multiplayer and all that stuff, right?

503
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Would you play something like that in a VR space?

504
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Does that appeal to you, being able to, you know, obviously, I know your phone doesn't have that power, but let's just put all that aside.

505
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Let's assume that the capability was there that you could play something like Andromeda in a VR space, would you?

506
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I would feel like, because when I'm in a space to play an RPG like that, I'll put in a couple hours worth and I just can't, even if I've trained myself up to being used to having the VR thing on my face for that long.

507
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I just, it's so, I mean, it is isolating. You've got this thing on your head.

508
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:19,000
So I think it's going to be mostly a casual experience until they become more like glasses that you can slide on and off.

509
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I don't know how to describe it.

510
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,000
I'm trying to think of a game that I play now. Like, I was looking for a music game.

511
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Like, of course, Rez would be incredible on this, but again, that's very, like, you do a stage, then the stage is over, then you can stop.

512
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Right.

513
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
So it's very, it's broken down into little bite-sized pieces.

514
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:44,000
And that's actually kind of my thing with it too, is that actually, well, I don't know, I think I might just need to calibrate it better for my head because I was getting a lot of the double vision stuff.

515
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Yeah, you shouldn't be getting that at all.

516
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
My eyes were shifting in and out of focus, like really bad.

517
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,000
And I think, and that like can really give me a headache after a few minutes, at least with this particular device.

518
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:59,000
But, you know, I actually, I would say, you know, I realize it isn't VR, it's completely different.

519
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:06,000
But one of the better experiences I had was with HoloLens, because those were like glasses you put on your head and they didn't like pull on my eyes or any of that stuff.

520
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Like, that's why I was able, I did that whole mystery game thing that Bobby had me go through.

521
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:17,000
And that was a lot of fun. And I was able to, that was a good, maybe 30 minutes that, you know, and I didn't feel anything after that.

522
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Whereas five minutes of all the stuff we were doing, I was like, okay, I need, I need to take a break.

523
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Yeah.

524
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:30,000
So, let's see. I'm going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com. Bobby answers your question here.

525
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:36,000
The Power Rangers stuff is only on Qualcomm's, Qualcomm's, oops, Snapdragon VR platform.

526
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Okay.

527
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Which literally nobody has.

528
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:44,000
SSG100Matt says, I've seen the VR porn on the Gear VR. It's really meh and more ridiculous than anything.

529
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I wasn't expecting anything ridiculous.

530
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:54,000
The other thing I got too, which you might want to try, it's, there's this Google Card, or a thing that allow you play Google Cardboard apps as well using that.

531
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
That's another good one to get because there's a lot more that's available through the Google Play Store.

532
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:04,000
And Google's own home VR thing is coming out soon, I think. The Dream or no?

533
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
No, Dream's already out with the Pixel.

534
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Okay.

535
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:14,000
That was the first phone that, but now, I mean, we'll get into it a little bit later, but like the Samsung Galaxy S8 is going to support Dream as well.

536
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:21,000
I mean, I don't know. It's just, it's basically, they're trying to make like a platform, okay, these phones are powerful enough to run this.

537
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Kind of like how these graphics cards are VAR ready type thing. These phones are VR ready or VR AR ready or something like that.

538
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
What was the puzzle game that I played a bit of? Do you remember?

539
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Lands End.

540
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
That one was really cool.

541
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Which you liked.

542
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Yeah. It reminded me a lot of Monument Valley a bit with the kind of episodic do a little bit of a puzzle here and then move on to the next area.

543
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:48,000
But it was really pretty. Like it takes place on a beach. And I mean, I'm a sucker for that kind of environment.

544
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:55,000
But it was mostly like just connecting line puzzles, but I thought it was fun, at least the first area.

545
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Yeah. And I need to check that out because I think you've played that more than me.

546
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:05,000
And then I downloaded this one thing called Groove VR, Groover, thinking it was a music game.

547
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:13,000
But basically it's a very, it's like you're floating and there's like the sort of sea punk, like dolphins going through the sky.

548
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,000
And it's like, I don't smoke enough weed or take shrooms to be, for this to be enjoyable.

549
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:23,000
But it plays techno music and you're kind of just floating through and there's like a big Buddha statue with like green smoke coming out of its eyes.

550
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I'm like, all right, this is like, it's like, yeah, yeah, we get it. You vape.

551
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Yeah. It's basically, think of it as a 3D black light poster. That's exactly what it is.

552
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:39,000
It's a 3D black light poster. So, yeah, that's all. It's a thing that I have.

553
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
All right. No, I do want to try more of it when real life settles down a little bit.

554
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:50,000
But yeah, I mean, that's yeah. I'm glad that you brought VR into the house. Bobby's probably very glad you brought VR into the house.

555
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
So I'm curious to try out more stuff that isn't, you know, laughable.

556
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Yeah. After you get this laptop, it sounds like, oh, hey, I maybe I should get a vibe. They saw $800 and like, fuck that noise.

557
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Yeah. Yeah. Right. But I'm going to give Dark Sakura her mic back now so you can participate in the show.

558
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
All right. Well, thank you for being here, Alan. Appreciate it.

559
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
You're welcome. All right. Find some more porn. All right. Let me ask, we had a story about VR here.

560
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
We want to do at the top of the show too on a related note, right?

561
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Yeah. Yeah. We can talk about that.

562
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Yeah. So maybe the whole Google IO thing, which is pretty cool because I actually watched that a bit and there was some exciting announcements there showing off.

563
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Of course, they talked a bit about VR, talking about, you know, the Google Dream platform or Daydream platform.

564
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:38,000
And some of the things they announced with that, as I mentioned, that they're adding the Galaxy S8 to the lineup of phones that are going to be supporting it.

565
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:46,000
There's also a new LG phone that's supporting it. I don't remember which phone it was, but a new LG phone is also going to be supporting the platform.

566
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:57,000
They're saying that they're also working on some standalone devices. So some that you won't actually need a phone to be able to play VR content on.

567
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Which, I mean, it's a good idea, I guess, as long as they're significantly cheaper than the phones.

568
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Because honestly, if you're going to need a phone, the devices themselves aren't really that expensive.

569
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:23,000
I mean, even if you're not necessarily picking up a Dream or the Daydream or the Gear VR, I mean, you can get cheap ass cardboard for pretty much nothing.

570
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:29,000
I mean, so, I don't know. But yeah, these standalone devices are saying they're not going to require a phone or PC.

571
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Instead, you're going to be getting VR as simple as putting on the actual headset.

572
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:41,000
And it's going to be optimized for VR and include new headset tracking technology called WorldSense.

573
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Which is positional tracking without all the extra sensors.

574
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:53,000
So it sounds like a lot, kind of what they're talking about with Microsoft's, the headsets that they're making for them.

575
00:35:53,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Where it's going to be using, instead of having external cameras tracking the actual headset, the headset's tracking kind of the environment.

576
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:08,000
It also kind of sounds like the console of VR in a way, right? Because that's what consoles are, right?

577
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
They hook up directly to your TV and it's a game-dedicated device.

578
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Honestly though, I mean, that's cool if you're going to launch that.

579
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:23,000
But I'm wary, just even with what's available on the Oculus Store and what's available on the Play Store.

580
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:28,000
There's not really anything that justifies having a standalone device using this.

581
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Unless it's going to take a lot of that PC stuff.

582
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
But then you're just kind of like, well, how much is this thing really going to cost?

583
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
And if it's going to run PC content.

584
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I just have a hard time seeing how that would be worth it.

585
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
I'm getting a little worried too, and I have been for some time.

586
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:51,000
And you all know this is my concern, is that I'm really worried this VR pool is super diluted right now.

587
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Like, I'm not saying there should be only one player in VR.

588
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Like, I'm not saying that at all.

589
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,000
But I'm having a really hard time keeping track of all these different devices.

590
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
I'm having to defer to Bobby Blackwell constantly.

591
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
What's that thing called? What's the Power Rangers thing on?

592
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
I just don't fucking know, and I kind of think that's a problem.

593
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:15,000
I don't know, I guess if I asked a non-video gamer what are the consoles available.

594
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
They would not be able to say off the top of their head,

595
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch.

596
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
They would not be able to do that.

597
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:27,000
I just can't help but feel like we've got so many choices that that can't be productive, right?

598
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:32,000
But with that said though, what they're showing off with the AR stuff actually is really cool.

599
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,000
So with the whole visual positioning service that they're basically putting into these phones,

600
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:42,000
it allows it to basically kind of track your movement and everything based on your environment.

601
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:49,000
And because they know where you are based on your GPS, and they kind of know what you're looking at with their contextual AI,

602
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:54,000
they're able to do kind of some neat stuff.

603
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
So for example, one of the things that they showed off is like,

604
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:02,000
okay, you're looking at a restaurant on the street and you get kind of a pop-up showing,

605
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
okay, here are the reviews for this restaurant.

606
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
It knew what you were looking at. It was kind of like, okay, showing you information about that.

607
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,000
And so I can see that being kind of cool, especially if the tracking gets better.

608
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
I mean, you could do all sorts of cool stuff with that with AR.

609
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
So that's kind of what I think is a little bit more interesting.

610
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
I'm all for them putting more money into the VR stuff.

611
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:28,000
The other cool thing they were showing off was also this AR pioneer program.

612
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,000
So what that was is basically AR for classrooms.

613
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:39,000
So they had these sets that looked like they were on selfie sticks with a phone,

614
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:48,000
and they were actually doing different educational experiences.

615
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
So, okay, we're going to see what a tornado looks like,

616
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,000
or we're going to look at the galaxy or watch a volcano,

617
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
and they can walk around and look at it.

618
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
And I was like, that's pretty cool.

619
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:02,000
For kids, that's really going to get them engaged and kind of learning everything.

620
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
So that's kind of cool.

621
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Yeah, that's pretty cool.

622
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Again, showing my age here a little bit,

623
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,000
but I lived through that age when VHS devices were new in the homes.

624
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I was young, like five, six, but still.

625
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,000
And I remember just educational tapes so that I could watch Leonard Nimoy

626
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
animating a movie.

627
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
And yes, this was a real tape that I had, these little science films,

628
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:28,000
where they would show pictures of traveling to Neptune,

629
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,000
or obviously there's only so much they have they put on the film.

630
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
But you guys know kind of where I'm going with this.

631
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
I think a lot of times they would show it to you through the telescope, whatever.

632
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:42,000
But as a kid, I remember like, holy shit, you could see these planets on my TV.

633
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,000
And that was technology when I was younger, 30 years ago when I was that age.

634
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
And now the fact that, okay, now the technology is like,

635
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
okay, now we put you on the fucking surface of Mars,

636
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
because we can do that, but that's still really cool for the kids.

637
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
The price of this technology is going to get cheaper and cheaper.

638
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
So we imagine these standalone headsets later on when,

639
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
okay, hey, we're going to visit the surface of Mars

640
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
because we actually have photographs of fucking Mars

641
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
that we can stitch together into some VR thing.

642
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
And I'm pretty sure that's probably already out there.

643
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
You can already do that.

644
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,000
But, you know, more mainstream where you can actually have kids experience that.

645
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
And that's kind of cool.

646
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
It's like you're literally visiting the surface of another planet.

647
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,000
I'm trying to parse some of this stuff in chat here over at live.vognetwork.com.

648
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Let's see, SG100Matt says,

649
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
I could see the good in there being a lot of choices.

650
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,000
It forces everyone with a VR device to try to outdo the other and innovate.

651
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Competition can lead to more or quicker innovation

652
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
as long as they see it's beneficial.

653
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Kaijuto in chat says,

654
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
VR is not diluted at all.

655
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
It's like one day there isn't enough for VR,

656
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
the next there is too much for it.

657
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Make up your minds, lol.

658
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
VR is fine and growing.

659
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
I mean, okay, yeah, VR is growing.

660
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:56,000
But I just, you know, if I wanted to start with VR, where should I go?

661
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
There's so many options right now.

662
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
I would assume, for me, I would go to PlayStation VR

663
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
simply because I'm a gamer and that's, you know.

664
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
I think it's going to be pretty interesting.

665
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Especially now that you have Microsoft kind of,

666
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
they're going to base an operating system around VR AR.

667
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
I think once that stuff starts hitting,

668
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:23,000
I mean, God, in a decade's time we could be all using VR stuff as a PC.

669
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,000
You know, we're going to be going to work and using this virtual space.

670
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
And that's not going to be a weird thing.

671
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Come on, confide in me and chat says,

672
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:38,000
I wonder if someday we'll be able to use AR to unlock a cute guy's private pics.

673
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Like, woof, scruff, unlock his pics.

674
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
You know, be careful what you ask for because here's the thing.

675
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
I mean, look, everything is going to come back to the whole time to penis

676
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
and porn thing at the end of the day.

677
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,000
But, you know, I could see definitely like one place where VR is going,

678
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
especially with Facebook's involvement in this whole thing is,

679
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
you know, like your Facebook newsfeed.

680
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,000
You know, right now you can broadcast live video on Facebook, right?

681
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,000
And, you know, I don't see a whole lot of exciting, exciting stuff in there.

682
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Like usually it's just a friend either playing a Blizzard game

683
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
because it's integrated or talking about their day.

684
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Or I have one friend that will do drunk cooking,

685
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
which I think is a big thing on YouTube too.

686
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,000
They'll get on their Facebook feed and drink and cook to do that.

687
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:26,000
But I would think it's only a matter of time before in VR,

688
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,000
you could be at somebody's wedding that you couldn't be there in real life.

689
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:36,000
But you could still attend it in VR through Facebook streaming

690
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
and Oculus and all this tech.

691
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Like I don't think the technology is obviously not totally there yet,

692
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
but like it's close.

693
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,000
And as the cost of all this stuff,

694
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
I mean, could you do that today?

695
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Yes, you probably could.

696
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
But could your grandma easily see it?

697
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Probably not.

698
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,000
But as the cost of this technology comes down and down and down

699
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
in the next few years, we're going to be there pretty quick.

700
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
So it's just interesting.

701
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Anyway.

702
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
All right.

703
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
And some folks in our chat are complaining.

704
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
I guess our servers are having a little bit of a hiccup,

705
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
but it's not on our end.

706
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
It's on the server's end because we're still streaming

707
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
a consistent amount of data.

708
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
And more importantly, we didn't pop out of chat.

709
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
That's usually a good sign.

710
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
If it's on our end, we'll get disconnected from chat.

711
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
And that didn't happen.

712
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
But we're going to just try to push forward with our show anyway.

713
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,000
RageNator in chat says the servers are drunk cooking apparently.

714
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Apparently.

715
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Apparently that's happening.

716
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
All right.

717
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Anyway, lots of good VR talk.

718
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
I'm sure there's going to be plenty more.

719
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Plenty more.

720
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
E3 is around the corner.

721
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Who knows?

722
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
I'm excited to see some more PlayStation VR announcements.

723
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Yeah, I'm excited.

724
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,000
And I would like to see if Microsoft might be taking the next step

725
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
with HoloLens.

726
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,000
I'm assuming no because Scorpio is going to be their focus this year.

727
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Just please don't announce a complete redesign of the PlayStation VR

728
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
headset because I'm going to feel a little bit pissed off

729
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
if that's going to be the case.

730
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Yeah, well.

731
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
I don't have one yet, so they could do that.

732
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
But anyway.

733
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
No, I get it.

734
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
I get it.

735
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
All right.

736
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games

737
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
that we have been playing this week.

738
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Dark Soccer, I'll start with you.

739
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
How was your gaming week?

740
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,000
It was very light, just given work's been so busy.

741
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:23,000
But I played some World of Warcraft, some Pokemon Go, Miitomo.

742
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Good lord.

743
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
And I played a lot of Bust-A-Move.

744
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Like I played for like an hour and a half on like endless mode

745
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
and never lost.

746
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
And I was like, where did the fucking time go?

747
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:39,000
And then I realized that it went down the drain along with the rest

748
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
of my free time.

749
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
So that's really it.

750
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Not a whole bunch.

751
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Although Shane's trying to get me into this room 999 game.

752
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Oh, yeah.

753
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
He's been talking about that.

754
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
He said, I don't know a lot about it.

755
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
I keep trying to get him to come back to the show to talk about it.

756
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
He said he's going to lend it to me.

757
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
It's like an escape room as a video game is what he kind of

758
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
described it to me as.

759
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
It looks like it was up my alley because of the light down in Roompa.

760
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
That's kind of funny because I thought escape rooms were based

761
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
on Flash games to begin with.

762
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Like the Crimson Room?

763
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Or the Red Room?

764
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Yeah, like all those little Japanese Flash games where it's like

765
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
you're stuck in a room and you have to put the clues together.

766
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
I thought that's what they did.

767
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
The real life escape room was based on.

768
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange

769
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase LAMP.

770
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,000
I thought when I heard, this is a while back when we were like

771
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,000
selling that game, I thought it was like Saw.

772
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
If I remember, maybe I'm thinking...

773
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
It's kind of, from what I understand, it's a mix.

774
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,000
There is some Saw-like elements to it.

775
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,000
But the first thing I told Shane was I hate those movies.

776
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
But he says it's not like in-your-face gore.

777
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
It's kind of like off-camera type of thing.

778
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
So I was like, alright, I guess I could probably handle that.

779
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
I mean, if I can play Silent Hill, I can handle some of it.

780
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
So, anyway.

781
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Alright, well then, if that's it for Dark Soccer's Gaming Week,

782
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
let's talk about Loki's Gaming Week.

783
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
So, I played a few mobile games.

784
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
So, of course, more office space, idle profits.

785
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Because it's still entertaining.

786
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
A little bit of Pokemon Go.

787
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Although, I got to say, this event that they did

788
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
was like some rock-type adventure event thing.

789
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
It's pretty lame.

790
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
I guess we just have a lot of rock-type Pokemon around here already.

791
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
So, it's just like, it's the same shit.

792
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,000
I didn't notice anything. It's like, oh, more Rhyhorns.

793
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Hooray.

794
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
That's how the water and grass events were for me in San Francisco.

795
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,000
It's the same, it's just if you have what's already there,

796
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
you're not going to see a difference.

797
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
I just wish they would, yeah.

798
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Well, they have like, oh, there's going to be an Aerodactyl.

799
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Okay, cool. I don't have that.

800
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Let's catch that.

801
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Nope. Not seeing that anywhere.

802
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Fucking liars.

803
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
So, yeah, it's been alright.

804
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
I mean, I don't know.

805
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
It's not as exciting as some of the other events that they've had.

806
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
So, I'll just look forward to the next one, I guess.

807
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
And then, of course, I got the new laptops.

808
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,000
So, I've been just slowly loading some stuff on there.

809
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Probably going to do some modded Skyrim,

810
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,000
because now I can mod the hell out of it and do all the fancy EMB stuff.

811
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
But, haven't bothered to do that just yet.

812
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
I did try a couple things.

813
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,000
One of the last games I picked up was a game called,

814
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:19,000
it's hardly a game, but it's an application called Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator.

815
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:24,000
It's basically this Unity game where you put tons of units down

816
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
and you watch them battle against each other.

817
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
So, you can do ridiculous shit like,

818
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:33,000
okay, it's a thousand T-Rexes versus some Archers and stuff like that.

819
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
And it's just fun to watch.

820
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
So, I did that for about ten minutes.

821
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
I'm like, okay, I've seen that.

822
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Now, I'm going to go do something else.

823
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
So, of course, it's been a while since I went back to Grand Theft Auto.

824
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:46,000
And so, I picked up Grand Theft Auto 5 and I loaded on there.

825
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
And I started playing through the story again.

826
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,000
So, it looks fantastic on my laptop.

827
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,000
And, yeah, I mean, I'm probably going to pick up Overwatch.

828
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,000
I was going to pick it up this weekend,

829
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
but I think we're going to get into a new story about it later.

830
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
I'm going to wait a couple days, which is probably a good idea.

831
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
We can say the free weekend's coming up.

832
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Yeah, the free weekend's coming up,

833
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
and then they're doing a game of the year edition.

834
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
So, I'll pick up the game of the year edition when it comes out.

835
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:19,000
And then Forza Horizon 3, I'm probably going to pick that up.

836
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,000
I was going to pick up an Xbox One controller to go with it,

837
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
but my fucking god, those are expensive.

838
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
I still use the 360 controller.

839
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:31,000
It was like 80 bucks for the controller that doesn't fucking have a rechargeable battery.

840
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,000
You've got to buy a rechargeable battery for another 25.

841
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:39,000
I'm like, why? I can either buy Forza Horizon or this controller.

842
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
I'll just use the 360 controller.

843
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
I don't need the fucking trigger rumbles.

844
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
So, I'm just going to hold off on that.

845
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,000
But I'll eventually pick up Forza Horizon 3 because it looked pretty cool

846
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
and I think it should run pretty well on this.

847
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Yeah, so, I mean, that's it.

848
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Awesome.

849
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
All right, let's go to JD. How was your gaming week?

850
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
And, JD, you've been really quiet tonight and I can't fix it on the board,

851
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
so just make sure that microphone is real close to your mouth.

852
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Okay, is this better?

853
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Yeah, much.

854
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
All right. It's been good.

855
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
My sister came to visit me the past two weeks.

856
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,000
So, we've been playing a lot of local multiplayer on Switch.

857
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:17,000
I have Mario Kart, I have Puyo Puyo Tetris, and we played Snipperclips.

858
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:21,000
So, that was the first half of this week.

859
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,000
And I've also been playing, you know, Street Pass games on my DS,

860
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:30,000
and Pokemon Shuffle, and Pokemon Go, and a couple other Pokemon games

861
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
because I'm crazy like that.

862
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:37,000
The arcade we went to was another definite highlight of my gaming week.

863
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:42,000
I played a Groove Coaster, and I saw somebody posted, like,

864
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
the last time you were there, there was a Crypt of the Necrodancer song,

865
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
and so I had to play that one.

866
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:53,000
I thought it was a really neat take on the roguelike moving every beat mechanic,

867
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
because they had this-

868
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,000
I believe that song is also in Pers- not Persona,

869
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,000
the game that Jamie and Shane are obsessed with.

870
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Why can't- the name told us-

871
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Danganronpa?

872
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Danganronpa. Why do I- why am I thinking Persona?

873
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,000
They kind of rhyme. Danganronpa, Persona, kind of.

874
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Anyway, that song in Crypt of the Necrodancer is also in Danganronpa

875
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
because Shane made me film it and tweeted it at Jamie.

876
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,000
There were a couple of different songs on the machine that were labeled

877
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Crypt of the Necrodancer, and I'm not sure if it's because-

878
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,000
I know one of them was definitely from the game itself,

879
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
and I'm wondering if some of the other was just, like,

880
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,000
the music person did, like, a remix of a different game song.

881
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:33,000
I don't know, but the specific one I played from the game, like,

882
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
there were a lot of notes where it was,

883
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,000
move the controller in an arrow direction on the beat,

884
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,000
which really mimicked a lot of the way you're playing Crypt of the Necrodancer,

885
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
where you're moving on the beat.

886
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,000
And I thought that was a really neat crossover kind of a thing.

887
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:53,000
I played Neon FM for the first time, which I'd, like, heard a bit about,

888
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
but it was neat. It reminded me a lot of Poppin',

889
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,000
like, five-key Poppin' with, you know, flat pads.

890
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
But it was a nice change.

891
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:06,000
And yeah, there was a State Mania cabinet,

892
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
so I got to play, you know, erotic songs that haven't been in arcades in years.

893
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
So, you know, I filled the bowling alley with

894
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Oh Nick, Please Not So Quick and stuff like that.

895
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
During the kid's birthday party. It's good.

896
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Yeah, well, you know, they weren't running around, exactly, mostly.

897
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:24,000
There was also a DDR 2014, which I don't think was a mix that got released in the US.

898
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,000
And they had Caramel Dancin', so I had to play that.

899
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Curse you for doing so.

900
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Yeah, that was about it.

901
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Nice. Let's see, my gaming week.

902
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,000
So, on a bit of a personal note, I hit affiliate status on my Twitch channel.

903
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,000
So, thank you guys very much for supporting, because obviously

904
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
What does that mean?

905
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
What does that mean? That means that now I can put that on my resume.

906
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Now you get a dollar.

907
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Yeah, literally, now I can get a dollar.

908
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Now, when I say give me a dollar, you can actually give me a dollar.

909
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:55,000
It makes me eligible for bits, which are the currency on Twitch that

910
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,000
So how do you do that? Like, give the podcast for enough time?

911
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Oh, to hit the affiliate status?

912
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Yeah.

913
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
There is, I think, four different criteria.

914
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
You have to have at least 50 followers.

915
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
So, you know, that's you guys that helped me make that, thank you.

916
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:12,000
You have to have at least three concurrent viewers over all your streams

917
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,000
For the past month, for the past 30 days.

918
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Which, again, because a lot of my streaming has been after OLR

919
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,000
And I've been able to pick up a good, you know, 20 or so people watching

920
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Right after OLR, that's been very helpful.

921
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
So, again, thank you guys. You made that possible.

922
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:31,000
But I know that is the criteria that Flaco Jones, I think he thinks he's

923
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Hung up on that right now, because I think in the beginning of the month

924
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
He didn't have a lot of people watching his stream.

925
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
He's been picking up, as he's been doing it more regularly

926
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
And he's thought up some other ideas, I think he's getting more viewers

927
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
So hopefully he's going to hit it soon, too.

928
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,000
But that is the trickiest one for people to hit, I think, is three concurrent.

929
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:49,000
It doesn't sound like a lot, but it can be for a new person starting out

930
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Especially when so many people are streaming, right?

931
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
So what is it, 50 followers, three concurrent?

932
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Seven days in the past 30 days that you've done a stream

933
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,000
And then 500 minutes in the past 30 days of streaming.

934
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Which is about, if you do like an hour and 15 minutes

935
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Two or three times a week, you'll hit those criteria.

936
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,000
So then it's kind of about just getting the followers and the viewers from there

937
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Which, you know, just takes a little time.

938
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
But yeah, it makes me eligible for the bits, which

939
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:19,000
You can either buy them through Twitch, which a lot of people are doing

940
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Or you can watch the ads, you can watch an ad and you get like five bits

941
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Or ten bits every time you watch an ad

942
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,000
And what you can do is you can cheer a viewer

943
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
So if somebody decides to cheer my channel

944
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Using the bits that they've got, watching ads

945
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Then I get one cent for every bit that is cheered at me

946
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,000
So I've made, I think, about five dollars so far streaming on Twitch

947
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,000
But you know what? Hey, I've been playing video games, having a good time

948
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,000
And honestly, I'm not doing it for the money. Let me just be straight

949
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:55,000
I've done this show for 15 years and haven't made a dime off this show

950
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Any money that has been made during OLR, like we've gotten some very generous donations over the years

951
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,000
But that all has gone right back into the show

952
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Buying a mixing board, paying for the VOG stream, paying for mics

953
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Whatever it is, all that money has gone back into the show

954
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,000
So, where was I going with that?

955
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Oh yeah, I don't expect to make money off of streaming

956
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:21,000
But the nice thing about it is that I'm hoping what the affiliate status does

957
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Is that maybe it's going to help with a little bit more additional visibility

958
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Because what I'm trying to do is get more people exposed to OLR and VOG through streaming

959
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,000
It's just like getting yourself out there, is what it is

960
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,000
But I've been having fun playing games with people

961
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,000
So now you can kind of see some of the games I've been playing throughout the week

962
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Because I played Forza Horizon 3 one night

963
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:46,000
I played Diablo 3 again, but I did it on PC

964
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,000
So I was doing Seasons this time around

965
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
And I made my seasonal character

966
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,000
I got all the way to I think Chapter 6

967
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,000
I think I'm in Chapter 6 now on my seasonal character on Diablo 3

968
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
So yes, I'm still playing a lot of that

969
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Still playing Final Fantasy XIV, eagerly anticipating Stormblood

970
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Which is less than a month out now until Early Access

971
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
So that's really exciting

972
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:11,000
And yeah, that's pretty much everything that I've live streamed

973
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,000
There hasn't been a lot that I didn't live stream that I played

974
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Except we played some Mario Kart 8 the other night

975
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Which I have to vent about a little bit

976
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Because you know where I'm going with this

977
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
So JD brought a Switch over

978
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
And I was like, cool!

979
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
We'll be able to do like, oh we can play Mario Kart

980
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Like I'll play on the TV

981
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
And JD can play on the Switch

982
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
And it's like we're battling each other, right?

983
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Okay, so in theory, this should, you know, it's a Nintendo thing

984
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
It should just work, right?

985
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Right

986
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Oh my god, like no, we're having connection issues out the wazoo

987
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Like we could not, like JD, and to be fair

988
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Alan and I were both playing on the TV

989
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
And then you were playing on your Switch device

990
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
And we kept getting disconnected

991
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Like we couldn't even set, we got to do one race

992
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
And then it disconnected us right after

993
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Or it would disconnect us during the prep

994
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Or we would always get disconnected

995
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
We were like, what the hell is going on?

996
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
So finally it was just like, fuck it

997
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
We can do three people on the TV

998
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
We just ended up doing it that way

999
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
But then we tried again yesterday

1000
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
But this time we said, okay let's put

1001
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Because your Switch was already in there

1002
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Because you were playing Zelda on the TV

1003
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
While I was out doing something else

1004
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
And so I was like, okay I'll play on my Switch

1005
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
And we got through a whole circuit

1006
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
And we got through four races

1007
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
And then got disconnected

1008
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
When we switched to battle, wasn't it?

1009
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, and then we tried to switch to battle

1010
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
But like, it shouldn't fucking do this

1011
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Yeah, it's stupid because it doesn't even have anything to do with the internet

1012
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Yeah

1013
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Like this is just two Switches in proximity

1014
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Like street passing or whatever, you know

1015
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Like it's near field communication

1016
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
And it shouldn't be dropping like that

1017
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,000
And this really concerns me because this was the feature

1018
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,000
That like I'm most looking forward to on Switch

1019
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Right

1020
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Is being able to do this all in one room like this

1021
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
I am totally shocked

1022
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Well, not shocked actually

1023
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
You know what we should do is we should try it with Puyo Puyo Tetris

1024
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
And see if it does the same thing

1025
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
See if it's the game or the system

1026
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Or something else, you know, do some elimination testing

1027
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Have you all tried this out in the chat

1028
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Since we do have a live chat room over at live.fognetwork.com

1029
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Have you guys had some issues trying to do

1030
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Again, not internet, but in the same room

1031
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Trying to do some gaming on Switch

1032
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
I've had absolutely no problem with Puyo Puyo Tetris

1033
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
But I have it on PS4

1034
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Well, what about Mario Kart 8?

1035
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
That's not going to help our situation

1036
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
So anyway, let's see

1037
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
ActDef says I played with friends last night

1038
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Two on TV and two on a Switch

1039
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
And we didn't have any problems

1040
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
So yeah, it's

1041
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
I don't know what's going on there

1042
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
I feel like it might be something unique to my setup

1043
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Is it because there's

1044
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Is it because the Switch is right near all the other electronics

1045
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Like maybe

1046
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Maybe my

1047
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
I feel like it shouldn't make a difference

1048
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Maybe I need to move the dock away from the other electronics

1049
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
You're right, it shouldn't make a difference

1050
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
It shouldn't make a difference

1051
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
I can't think of what else it is

1052
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Well, for NFR

1053
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
The only things that could cause

1054
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Any big problem with that would be

1055
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
If it's going through a concrete wall

1056
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Or the microwave's going

1057
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
You can't tell me

1058
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
The Switch can't do what a DS can do

1059
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Or the Bluetooth

1060
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
See, I don't want to say this

1061
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Because I'm going to get judged by some people

1062
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
But y'all can kiss my butt

1063
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
It is sitting on top of my subwoofer

1064
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Would that be

1065
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Interference?

1066
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
That might be it

1067
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
That's going to be the first thing we try

1068
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Maybe we're going to try moving it around

1069
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Get it off the subwoofer

1070
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
No, it doesn't sit on the subwoofer

1071
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
But it sits right next to it

1072
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
If there's interference

1073
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
I set the games on top of the subwoofer

1074
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Also, maybe line of sight might be a concern

1075
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
You were sitting on the couch

1076
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Maybe the recliner would be better

1077
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
I'm just saying if you're holding the console

1078
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Against it or something

1079
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Maybe it's the subwoofer

1080
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Speculation

1081
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Troubleshooting is so much fun

1082
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
To be fair

1083
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
You guys are probably all rolling your eyes

1084
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Rob, you're such an idiot

1085
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
It would be nice if Nintendo gave a little more description

1086
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
What is the communication error?

1087
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Did a particular

1088
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Switch drop?

1089
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
What's the fucking error?

1090
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Give me something to help diagnose it a little better

1091
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
There's no error, it's a feature

1092
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Shut up, alright

1093
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
I had to get that off my chest because that really concerned me

1094
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
But we'll just hope

1095
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
It was my

1096
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Unique setup here in this household

1097
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
And not something that's going to be

1098
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Long ongoing

1099
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Anyway, let's move on

1100
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
And talk about some quick plugs

1101
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Announcements, of course you can always follow us on Twitter

We're also on Facebook

1105
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
June is going to be a

1106
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Crazy month here at O-L-R

1107
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
E3 is going to be

1108
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Taking over our episode on

1109
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
June 11th, no literally

1110
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
It is taking over our episode because

1111
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Bethesda has their press conference

1112
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Right in the middle of the show, but as always

1113
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
We're still going to do our thing here at VOG Network

1114
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
We'll start the show

1115
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Pause it during the Bethesda conference

1116
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Then pick up right there with some live reaction

1117
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
And all that good stuff

1118
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
And your calls and all that stuff as well

1119
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
The week after that, June 18th

1120
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
We celebrate

1121
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
15 years

1122
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Of OrangeLoungeRadio

1123
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
15 freaking years

1124
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Of OrangeLoungeRadio

1125
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
You know I need to look up

1126
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
When OrangeLoungeRadio started

1127
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
On live 365 because we launched the station

1128
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
A month before we launched

1129
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
The show because we were just playing music

1130
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Like building hype to the first

1131
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Like live event show that we were doing

1132
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
And I want to say the station started

1133
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
I feel like May 22nd

1134
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Was the day, I could be wrong

1135
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
But I want to say it was late May

1136
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
So we're, technically

1137
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
OLR is like 15

1138
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Tomorrow

1139
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Just not the show

1140
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
You can wear the dress

1141
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
I don't have the dress so I'll just come and drag

1142
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Alright yeah it's fine, come and drag

1143
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
So June 18th is going to be the big

1144
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
15th year because the first official

1145
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Episode of OrangeLoungeRadio

1146
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Is June 23rd, 2002

1147
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
So we're going to celebrate 15 years

1148
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
On June 18th and then on

1149
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
June 25th we will be rewarding

1150
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Our 15 years of OrangeLoungeRadio

1151
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
By taking a day off

1152
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
I will be in Chicago

1153
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
And my co-host will be

1154
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Enjoying a day off

1155
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
I will probably be at San Francisco Pride

1156
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
That's right you're doing San Francisco Pride

1157
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Kind of busy

1158
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
We're spreading pride throughout the world

1159
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
Because I'll be at Chicago Pride

1160
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Alright cool

1161
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
So no show that day

1162
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Episode 700 is creeping up on us

1163
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
And I am, that is in the back

1164
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Of my head

1165
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Unfortunately due to some personal life stuff

1166
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Going on I wasn't able, I was supposed

1167
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
To go check out that space

1168
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
That our folks here, Bree and Gabe

1169
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Were talking about, I was supposed to do that yesterday

1170
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
And I wasn't able to get around to it

1171
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
I'm hoping at some point I'm going to go over there and check it out

1172
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
And we are

1173
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Exploring options for a place here

1174
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Locally we can do Episode 700

1175
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Like as a more

1176
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Event type show so

1177
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Please look forward to it

1178
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Or something around Episode 700

1179
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
It may not be the actual show itself

1180
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Is it going to be 700 club themed?

1181
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Fuck no

1182
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Only if we get to

1183
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Beat an effigy of what's a fuck

1184
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Well here's the thing

1185
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Because of the missed weeks, I have to count out the weeks again

1186
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
But because I think I got sick

1187
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Episode 700 might be freaking the week that

1188
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Dragon Con is supposed to be

1189
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
So I have to figure all that timing out

1190
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
And all that good stuff

1191
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
So more to come on that

1192
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
But in the meantime we've still got some gaming news to talk about

1193
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Let's get into the gaming news for the week

1194
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Loki

1195
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
So this year we've got a brand new publisher

1196
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
That's going to be doing an E3 presentation

1197
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
And I'm pretty excited

1198
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
To see this because

1199
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
You've got to love them on Twitter

1200
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
But Devolver Digital

1201
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Is going to be doing their event

1202
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Called Indie Picnic

1203
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
In the parking lot across from the LA Convention Center

1204
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
South Hall

1205
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
And they said next door to Hooters

1206
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Jesus

1207
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
I didn't realize there was a Hooters down there

1208
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
That must be new

1209
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Basically they're saying that

1210
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
They're going to have their own E3 press conference

1211
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
That the

1212
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Picnic I guess is going to be open

1213
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Are they just going to stand on the corner and scream it?

1214
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
I don't know

1215
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
They're saying that it's going to be open to

1216
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
All E3 badge holders

1217
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
And the event will be continuing through

1218
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
E3 11 through 7 o'clock

1219
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Attendees can check out Devolver's

1220
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Lineup of games and also

1221
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
They'll be where the Indie Megabooth

1222
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
XSplit and Gambitius

1223
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Take place

1224
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
And yeah so that's pretty

1225
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Cool that they're going to have their own

1226
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Indie

1227
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
They haven't announced a time yet for the

1228
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Press conference but stay tuned for that

1229
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
I'm sure they're going to have to announce it pretty soon

1230
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
Alright well

1231
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Any games you're hoping to see

1232
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Out of them?

1233
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
They have such kind of wild

1234
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Different stuff over there

1235
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Yeah I just want something wild and cool

1236
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Honestly I don't remember

1237
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
I don't think they publish super hot

1238
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
I would love to see super hot VR make it to

1239
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
The Playstation VR that's what I would like to see

1240
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Because the VR one looks pretty awesome

1241
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
For the Vive

1242
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
And the Oculus so I'm kind of curious

1243
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
To see what that would be like on the Playstation

1244
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Or I just wouldn't really want to play it

1245
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
$800 fucking headset and even the

1246
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Oculus headset it's like $600

1247
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
That shit needs to come down in price

1248
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
$300

1249
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
That would be perfect

1250
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Let's see I'm going to our chat over at

1251
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Live.vognetwork.com Bobby Blackwolf says

1252
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Devolver Digital has some former gathering

1253
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Of developers people and they had

1254
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
The God lot before there were

1255
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Condos across the street from the LA Convention Center

1256
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
It was the same kind of thing except with more

1257
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Strippers and I'm not kidding they were stripper poles

1258
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
That's awesome

1259
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
I remember the days when it was

1260
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Was it the Ouya event that was there?

1261
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
What was across the street from the LA Convention Center?

1262
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Was that Ouya? The one year?

1263
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
They had Ouya

1264
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
No because I gave a shit about

1265
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Ouya because it was one thing I could get into without a badge

1266
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
I think that was the year I went

1267
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
And I picked up Bobby Blackwolf at E3

1268
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
And then we went to Disneyland

1269
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Because I didn't actually go to E3 that year

1270
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
But we just went in the lobby in street past

1271
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
I was there for that wasn't I?

1272
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
That was electronica

1273
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
We've done it more than once

1274
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
So there it is

1275
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Well you're not going to do the Ouya event anymore

1276
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
No we're not

1277
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Alright moving on let's talk about

1278
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
A rumor about what could be coming to

1279
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Smartphones you know Nintendo has been doing

1280
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Their smartphone thing and

1281
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
They what me Tomo

1282
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
JD still plays me Tomo

1283
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Yeah I lug in everything

1284
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
I was just checking in a moment ago

1285
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
My son plays the shit

1286
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Out of Super Mario Run

1287
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
Which I think Super Mario Run

1288
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Was more of a mixed bag of success

1289
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
I think their expectations were just really high for that

1290
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Wasn't there also a Fire Emblem game?

1291
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
There was I have not

1292
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Yeah I have not checked that out myself

1293
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
But that's a thing

1294
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Well the Wall Street Journal is reporting that Nintendo

1295
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Is going to be bringing the Legend of Zelda

1296
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Franchise to mobile later this year

1297
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
This will be after

1298
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Animal Crossing which we already knew

1299
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Was slated for mobile

1300
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Clearly they're going to bring the best Zelda

1301
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Zelda 2 Adventures of Link

1302
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
I like Zelda 2

1303
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
But A playing that on a phone

1304
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Would be a disaster

1305
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
No that's not the worst of the franchise

1306
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
It would be Zelda Wand of Gamelon

1307
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
There you go that's a better joke

1308
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Stick to that joke next time

1309
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Anyway we don't know the game

1310
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
What it is the pricing structure

1311
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
This is all coming from the Wall Street Journal

1312
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Saying the news is from people

1313
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Familiar with the matter

1314
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
They've got leaks everywhere

1315
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
That the Wall Street Journal finds

1316
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Maybe this is something that could come out at E3

1317
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
A little more information about

1318
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Especially with the popularity of Breath of the Wild

1319
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
This is a good thing to ride the coattails of

1320
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
We will see

1321
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
There will be a pretty huge franchise for Nintendo

1322
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
Although granted they put Mario on the phone

1323
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
You can't go much bigger than that really

1324
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
But Zelda is pretty close

1325
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Especially with how well Breath of the Wild has been doing

1326
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Non-stop Link

1327
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Now well here's the thing

1328
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
I would expect

1329
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
It's not going to be a 2D

1330
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
It's not going to be the original Zelda

1331
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
It's not going to be Zelda Link to the Past

1332
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
Because you can't control that shit on the phone

1333
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
It's going to be horrible controls

1334
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
And I don't think Nintendo is going to sell it

1335
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
I disagree with that you know why?

1336
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
If you played the DS versions

1337
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
The Wind Waker looking ones

1338
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
Those all use touchpad controls

1339
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
I was getting to that because those are different games

1340
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
The Phantom Hourglass

1341
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Completely different game

1342
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
And that's the type of game that I would expect

1343
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
A Rails shooter

1344
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
But with Zelda

1345
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
No it wasn't a Rails shooter

1346
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Did you play those games?

1347
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
I mean seriously

1348
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
It's kind of a joke but yes

1349
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Okay you didn't

1350
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Obviously not because

1351
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
They controlled really well for touch

1352
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Which is surprising

1353
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
They didn't really utilize the buttons at all

1354
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
It was basically you hold the screen

1355
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Where you want Zelda

1356
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
There you go making a new mistake

1357
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Have you ever watched the show?

1358
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Take off that mask Jamie

1359
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
I'd like to keep it on

1360
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
You control Link by

1361
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Basically holding the part of the screen

1362
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
And you can attack by tapping

1363
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
And it worked really well

1364
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Which is kind of surprising

1365
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
From what I remember they didn't really utilize

1366
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Buttons too much

1367
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
They could put a couple on screen buttons

1368
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
If you really needed something for that

1369
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
The only thing they could do for the most part

1370
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Completely touch control and it would be fine

1371
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Or they could just do a completely new idea

1372
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
And that would be fine too

1373
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Honestly they you know

1374
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Or they could just put fucking Pokemon Snap on there

1375
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Because really that would be fucking amazing

1376
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
With like the AR shit

1377
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
They could do something in the

1378
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Breath of the Wild world

1379
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
With all of the crazy stuff that you do

1380
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
And they're like you know using the different items

1381
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
It would be like cooking Mama but just cooking Link

1382
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
What about like a dungeon solver type of thing

1383
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Or the shrines like a shrine solver type of thing

1384
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
That lends itself well to mobile phones

1385
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
I don't know there's different ideas

1386
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
They could do it doesn't necessarily have to be a copy

1387
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Of something that already exists

1388
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
But this is all really

1389
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Fan wank right now we just don't know

1390
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
What is really going to happen with Zelda so

1391
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
We'll just have to keep waiting till E3

1392
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
To see if they talk about it then or if they

1393
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
They wait on it

1394
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
It might be actually I would think that this

1395
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Type of thing may not be in the E3

1396
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
Spotlight or whatever they're calling it

1397
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
It might be something that shows up at Treehouse

1398
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Cause remember they show

1399
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Pokemon Go at Treehouse

1400
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
And that was the first time they ever showed

1401
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
Gameplay outside of beta on that

1402
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
And we have this stupid

1403
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
Watch thing that we still

1404
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Don't sell regularly even though it's been out

1405
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
For almost a year now

1406
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
I still want to cheat with it

1407
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
I wanted to take it apart and solder the fucking

1408
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Lights to the button

1409
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
So that every time it would light up it would click the button

1410
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Cause that's what I do

1411
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
I find ways to exploit shit

1412
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
And it would have been satisfying

1413
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
To be able to lord that over them

1414
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Moving on to another story

1415
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
Dark Sakura if you wouldn't mind

1416
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Well I have been

1417
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Looking at this game with some kind

1418
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Of mixed feelings but it's about

1419
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
Sonic Forces

1420
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Well you get to customize a character

1421
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
In Sonic Forces

1422
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
You can have different

1423
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
Species of animals

1424
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
With their own different abilities

1425
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
And the things that they carry with them

1426
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
And their own looks

1427
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Different masks so you basically get to

1428
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
Play dress up in Sonic

1429
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Which is gonna open the door for

1430
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
A lot of

1431
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Cosplay

1432
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
There are a lot of furry characters out of this

1433
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
You could

1434
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
I said it nicely by saying

1435
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
If you want to act out your first sona

1436
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
In a Sonic universe you go

1437
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Right ahead, have fun

1438
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
There's a lot of people who already do that shit

1439
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
So now they just get to say

1440
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Look I'm canon

1441
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
I'm in the game

1442
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
I'm canon

1443
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
What's the solution

1444
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
To Sonic's shitty friends?

1445
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
Let's make an infinite amount of Sonic's shitty friends

1446
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Make it now it's you

1447
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
Now you're the bad friend

1448
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
I don't know if I hate the shitty friends

1449
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Because I'm the shitty friend

1450
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
I'm so torn

1451
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Everybody's gonna make their own shitty friend

1452
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
And then they're gonna post their shitty pictures

1453
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
To social media

1454
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Through the Switches

1455
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
Twitch and Facebook

1456
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Look I'm in a Sonic game

1457
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Sonic's butt

1458
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Can you put your me's in there?

1459
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
Can we have Hitler Sonic's friend?

1460
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
No no no

1461
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
That's terra bad

1462
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Yeah they need to have limitations

1463
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
On what you can do

1464
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Because otherwise

1465
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
There's people that have done me's

1466
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
That are just cocking balls

1467
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
There's people that have done me's

1468
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
That are Christmas and New Years

1469
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
It's all right there

1470
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
It's just gonna be a thing now isn't it

1471
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
Yes

1472
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
I can't wait for December

1473
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
Moving on

1474
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
You don't want to see Hanukkah

1475
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
All right

1476
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
That lasts for weeks

1477
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
Moving on

1478
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Loki

1479
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
All right

1480
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Ubisoft has made some announcements

1481
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Prior to E3

1482
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Some things we're gonna be seeing more of

1483
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
During their press conference

1484
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
Far Cry 5

1485
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
And The Crew 2

1486
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
Are gonna be

1487
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Coming soon

1488
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
And apparently maybe a new Assassin's Creed

1489
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Cause I think that they took the year off

1490
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
So now we'll see something like that

1491
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Remember I think we had the rumor that it was

1492
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Opel World or something

1493
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
So I guess we'll see what's gonna happen

1494
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
But apparently yeah those three

1495
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
Are due to be released

1496
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
This fiscal year

1497
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
That's pretty cool that The Crew

1498
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Is getting a sequel after all

1499
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Cause I didn't think the first game did that well

1500
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Cause it was like bargain basement

1501
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Pretty cheap to play

1502
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Pretty fast

1503
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
So I didn't think that lent well

1504
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
I'm not dogging the game

1505
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
To be fair

1506
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
I think a lot of people I knew that did

1507
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Spend time with the game enjoyed it

1508
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
So I'm not saying it was a bad game

1509
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
Or unworthy of a sequel

1510
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
I was surprised with how fast they slashed the price

1511
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
That it's doing well enough to

1512
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
Necessitate a sequel

1513
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Hopefully

1514
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
Maybe they'll do

1515
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
What they need to do to make it

1516
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
So that more people want to drop 50-60 bucks on it right away

1517
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Dungeon Buster in Chat says

1518
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
I hope they fix the rubber banding

1519
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
And magnetic tires in The Crew

1520
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
The game was kind of fun but wow

1521
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Issues

1522
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
We just like never ever do rubber banding ever again

1523
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
No one likes it

1524
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Who actually likes rubber banding?

1525
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Nobody

1526
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Just like get rid of it

1527
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
It's a cop out

1528
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
For programming better driving AI

1529
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Make it something you can enable and disable

1530
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
I don't know

1531
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
Tigerclaw in Chat says every racing game has rubber banding

1532
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Like it or not

1533
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
I don't like it

1534
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Yeah that's right I choose not to like it

1535
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
So I started a podcast about it

1536
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
Something I like though

1537
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
That I like talking about on the podcast

1538
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Is Overwatch

1539
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
And Overwatch believe it or not is turning a year old

1540
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
It feels like that game is a lot older

1541
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
But I think it seems so cemented

1542
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
In gaming now

1543
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Overwatch is coming up

1544
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
With their game of the year edition

1545
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
On Tuesday May 23

1546
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Is when that game of the year edition comes out

1547
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
It's going to be coming with

1548
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
10 bonus loot boxes

1549
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Some new hero skins

1550
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Blackwatch Reyes

1551
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
And Strike Commander Morrison skins

1552
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
You can also get some of the stuff that I think

1553
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
Was in the original Overwatch

1554
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Origins edition like the Ferris skin

1555
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
And some of that other stuff

1556
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
That is going to be available on PlayStation 4

1557
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
Xbox One and PC

1558
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
But they're also going to be running an anniversary event

1559
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
In the game

1560
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
They haven't really said much more about what are the skins going to look like

1561
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
There are some voices that showed up

1562
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
But that's all we know

1563
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
So we don't really know exactly

1564
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
What all the extra stuff is going to be with that yet

1565
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
But yeah very cool

1566
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
That that game is

1567
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Still doing strongly

1568
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
After a year

1569
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
I'm kind of curious how they're going to keep the momentum

1570
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Going a few years from now

1571
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
So far they're doing really well

1572
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
And hell I'm still playing Diablo 3

1573
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
And that game's

1574
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
That was like 2008, 2009 at this point

1575
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Getting to be an older game

1576
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
No I don't think it's that old

1577
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
But still it's several years old at this point

1578
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
We get a Diablo 4 pretty soon?

1579
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
I wish

1580
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
Maybe that's one of the under construction things

1581
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
Or you think we'll see more

1582
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Character classes or something

1583
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
For Overwatch?

1584
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Diablo

1585
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
So they already announced that

1586
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
So that

1587
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
I still feel like it's going to be a couple years

1588
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Before we even see Diablo 4

1589
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
But I don't know

1590
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
Anyway

1591
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Let's see, ActDeftInChat says it was Game of the Year

1592
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
In 2016

1593
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
I don't think I mentioned it in that story

1594
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
But I know it's part of this too

1595
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
They are doing a free play weekend

1596
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
Over Memorial Day weekend of all times too

1597
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
So if you've never played Overwatch

1598
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
You have a chance

1599
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
This is the first time I think they've done the free play on PC

1600
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
I know they've done it on console a couple times

1601
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
But I think this is the first time they're doing it on PC

1602
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
I've never played it

1603
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
Yeah, no, I'm excited to have you check it out

1604
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
See what you think

1605
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
And I'm going to use controller like a complete noob

1606
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
Because I don't have a place to put my computer

1607
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
Where I can actually use a mouse

1608
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
Nor do I have a mouse

1609
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Ooh, that's going to be rough, but good luck

1610
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Fuck that, I'm fucking awesome with controller

1611
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
I think they did do free play on a PC a while back

1612
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
Because that was when Ryan tried it

1613
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Maybe they did, I just don't remember it

1614
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
It was definitely a while ago, like six months or something

1615
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
Yeah, and I bought the game straight away

1616
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
So I wouldn't have been paying attention to that

1617
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
Let's see, SSQ100Matt saying

1618
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
I remember a chatter in here saying that

1619
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Overwatch wasn't going to stick around

1620
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
Because Blizzard can't do shooters

1621
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
I wonder how that worked out

1622
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Well, I think the reason why Overwatch is kind of working is because

1623
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
It's more than just a shooter

1624
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
They do have characters in there that you can play

1625
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
If you're not much of a shot

1626
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
A character like Symmetra

1627
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
Is really about where you place the turrets

1628
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
And you don't even really have to be able to aim

1629
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
To attack with Symmetra's gun

1630
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
And that makes her a very attractive player

1631
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
For some people

1632
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
A healer like Mercy

1633
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
You don't really have to be able to aim

1634
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
You support other characters

1635
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
Lucio is all about an aura

1636
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
You know, it's a healing aura or a boost aura

1637
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
So you don't necessarily have to be a good shot

1638
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
And I think that's what has made it very, very, very

1639
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Attractive for a lot of people

1640
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
But if you want to play, I mean

1641
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
You have a Widowmaker who's a sniper

1642
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
And Soldier 76 is just basically

1643
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Your Call of Duty character

1644
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
So they have that stuff in there too

1645
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
If that's what you're into

1646
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
Alright, and

1647
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Yeah, SSG100Matt says

1648
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
They find new ways to reinvent the game all the time

1649
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
And Act F even suggests

1650
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
For Loki, start with Soldier 76

1651
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Because that will be the most familiar

1652
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Probably from

1653
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Other shooting games

1654
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Alright, we will move on

1655
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Just a few more stories for you guys

1656
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Before we get to the classic game of the week

1657
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
But first, Dark Sakura

1658
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
This is something I've been

1659
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Considering contributing to

1660
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
Ever since I found out

1661
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
But Project Rap Rabbit

1662
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
Is set for PC and PS4

1663
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
And it has a

1664
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
Kickstarter on it

1665
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:43,000
With a 1.1 million dollar goal

1666
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
I see them making it

1667
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
No problem

1668
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
But there's

1669
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
Actually quite a few tiers on there

1670
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
And several of them seem actually fairly affordable

1671
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
One of the digital tiers

1672
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
Is like maybe 30 bucks

1673
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
For the game

1674
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
And then

1675
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
For like 70, there's one that has

1676
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
Art books and stuff with it

1677
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
I wouldn't mind having the art book for it

1678
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Although Dan says I have 50 million art books

1679
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
For games I haven't played

1680
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
So, but

1681
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
Good, what's one more?

1682
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
But at any rate

1683
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
Basically, Rap Rabbit

1684
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
Is actually taking inspiration

1685
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
From what it's been

1686
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
Commented on like epic rap battles

1687
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
Of history

1688
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
Where it's a

1689
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
Rapping dialogue

1690
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
Not like necessarily a battle

1691
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
But a dialogue

1692
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
And you've got like different verses

1693
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
That you can throw in and not just doing whatever

1694
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
They're already in the song

1695
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
So, it definitely

1696
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
It definitely looks cool and definitely is something

1697
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
That I think is going to be getting

1698
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Money from you on Kickstarter

1699
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
So I see some people

1700
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
In chat talking about the Switch version

1701
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
Of this, so here's the thing that happened

1702
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
To that, so when it was originally on

1703
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
Kickstarter, they posted all of their stretch goals

1704
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
And like the last stretch

1705
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
Goal on there was like a 5.5 million

1706
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
Stretch goal and it would say Switch version

1707
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
And the Nintendo fanboys

1708
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Screamed basically, which I

1709
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
Kinda get, I mean that was a real

1710
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
That was a lot of money to do a Switch version

1711
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
So they've actually changed it and if you go back

1712
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
To the Kickstarter today, Switch is now

1713
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
The first stretch goal with 1.5

1714
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Million to get the Switch version

1715
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
Which, you know, the game

1716
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
Would definitely be attractive I think if it was on

1717
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
The Switch, but

1718
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
Well, and a little bit more about

1719
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
The character is that the main character is called

1720
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Totomaru, who is basically

1721
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
A farm boy rabbit and wants

1722
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
To battle the forces of corruption

1723
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
And his sidekick is named

1724
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
Totomaru

1725
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
I'm in a really difficult place

1726
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
With this thing, I love these

1727
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
Companies, I love these, like you know

1728
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
Nana On'Sha, like I love these

1729
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Companies, there's so much talent going into

1730
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
This, that being said, I'm kinda

1731
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
Done backing

1732
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
Big studio Kickstarters

1733
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
I realize these studios aren't big

1734
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
But like

1735
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
I'm not interested in buying

1736
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
The game today that's not gonna come out for 4 years

1737
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
And I know they say, oh we have

1738
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
A path to get it out

1739
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
Sure you do, buddy

1740
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
They all do

1741
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Now, indies, and we've talked a lot about

1742
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
Indie Kickstarters on this show, I feel a lot

1743
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
Differently about, okay

1744
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
But something of this caliber, especially for these

1745
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
Guys that have done Playstation games before

1746
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
And so forth, like, I'm just kind of

1747
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
Shocked they can't get a publisher

1748
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
To sign on to this

1749
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
Like, I don't know, like

1750
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
Where's your guys' heads at with this?

1751
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
Like, Jamie, you said you were thinking about contributing to it

1752
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
So you must be a little more forgiving

1753
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
I'd rather that they raise the money

1754
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
Themselves this way and go independently

1755
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
For a publisher

1756
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Just because I've seen publishers fuck stuff up

1757
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
You know what, I know what it is

1758
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
I know what bothered me about it

1759
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
It actually did have to do with the Nintendo thing

1760
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
I thought it was weird

1761
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
That the game was a Playstation 4

1762
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
And a PC exclusive

1763
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
Because my head went to

1764
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
If it's a Playstation 4 exclusive

1765
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
Sony should be paying for it

1766
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
Not me

1767
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
Now, I realize the Switch thing

1768
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
Has changed a little bit

1769
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
So I don't feel that as much anymore

1770
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
But definitely when I first loaded the page

1771
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
That was a huge misfire on their part

1772
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
To be like, we'll do Nintendo Switch if we get 5 million dollars

1773
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
Because I'm kind of like, if you're going to stay

1774
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Exclusive to one platform, then that platform

1775
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
Should be fronting the money for it

1776
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
And where the hell is Xbox One?

1777
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
I kind of get, it's Japanese developed

1778
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
So that question's

1779
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
Kind of, eh, I get it

1780
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
Probably is never

1781
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
Yeah, I know, I know

1782
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
It could also be based off what dev kits they have

1783
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
Maybe they have a Playstation 4 dev kit

1784
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
That could be, that could be

1785
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
But I just, I still couldn't help but feel a little bit of like

1786
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
Why am I paying for something that is going to be exclusive to one system

1787
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
You know, and all this stuff

1788
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
And I just

1789
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
I don't know, I just

1790
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
I feel like there's

1791
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
Kickstarters I've contributed to

1792
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
A long time ago

1793
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
Bloodstained, Ritual of the Night

1794
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
Which is a good example

1795
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
Still not out

1796
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
And I'm sure the game's going to be fine

1797
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
And it's, you know, all that stuff

1798
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
But it's like

1799
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
I'm not interested in making this 4 year long investment

1800
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
I'm sorry, I know some people strongly disagree with me

1801
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
But I kind of just

1802
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
Don't want to give my money away like that

1803
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
I want something a little more immediate

1804
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
I think

1805
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Bobby Blackwolf says

1806
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
They will still have a publisher

1807
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
1.1 million isn't enough to make the game

1808
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
They still have other investors

1809
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
And they say

1810
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
He says

1811
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
So

1812
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
We have gone to Great Lakes and are planning an early work to minimize this risk

1813
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
Between the shared experience of developers

1814
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
Nanno and Shaw and Innes

1815
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
And publisher Pcube's platform holder relationships

1816
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
And merchandise production know-how

1817
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
We're confident that all the pieces are in place to ship

1818
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
Project Rap Rabbit along with all

1819
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
Physical backer awards by August 2018

1820
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
I

1821
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
Even with all that

1822
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
In front of me, I just, I don't

1823
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
I don't believe it

1824
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
And honestly

1825
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
And it sucks, but you can

1826
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
Kind of blame Mighty No. 9 for a lot of it

1827
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
A lot of it

1828
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Mighty No. 9 done

1829
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
Fucked up Kickstarter

1830
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
Is it making you cry like an anime

1831
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
Fan on prom night?

1832
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
Yes

1833
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
But again

1834
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
When it comes to indies

1835
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
I feel a lot differently

1836
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
I get it

1837
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
The ones that have been on here that are like

1838
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
I need that artist or I need that

1839
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
Or my game is fucking done

1840
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
I need the money to do the distribution

1841
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
And all that stuff

1842
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
I'm kind of like, okay, well you've never done a game before

1843
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
You've clearly been working on something

1844
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
I feel a lot differently with the smaller people

1845
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
Maybe that's just my whole

1846
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
Yay indie type of nature anyway

1847
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
But these other

1848
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
These other things I have a harder time with

1849
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
I don't know

1850
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
Matt says

1851
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
So I don't know

1852
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
I couldn't help but feel a little burned

1853
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
When I saw that it was a Kickstarter

1854
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
Because I was thinking, oh it's going to be a big

1855
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
E3 announcement

1856
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
Yes, I realize Kickstarter

1857
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
Are E3 announcements now

1858
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
Ever since Shenmue 3

1859
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
But

1860
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
When they were talking this whole thing

1861
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
What was the little tagline

1862
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
Make music games great again and all this stuff

1863
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
I was like, oh

1864
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
Music games are already great

1865
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
A, I was like please don't say that

1866
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
B, like

1867
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
With a line like that I would have thought your game

1868
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
Was ready to go

1869
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
Well then again

1870
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
With a line like that maybe they're channeling

1871
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
The one that said it originally

1872
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
I wouldn't go that far

1873
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
I get it, especially when you're an indie

1874
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
Developer, you want to get the hype

1875
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
And the community built up around your product

1876
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
Early

1877
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
But I just get annoyed, it's like

1878
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
We have this really kick ass product that's not

1879
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
Going to be out for two years

1880
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
Why didn't you just

1881
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
Show me this one that's more ready

1882
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
Did they have video of what it looks like

1883
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
Or is it just all concept shit right now

1884
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
Screenshots

1885
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
I don't think they actually

1886
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
Do they have the game running on that kickstarter

1887
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
I didn't look that far

1888
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
When I looked at it I looked at it on my mobile

1889
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
And I couldn't actually play videos

1890
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
I think

1891
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
I know they had screenshots, they had a lot of that stuff

1892
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
But I don't know if they actually have the game

1893
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
The actual product up there

1894
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
I don't want to go on record saying they don't

1895
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
That makes me wary

1896
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
That early

1897
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
Bobby says it's all concept, it's all whiteboard

1898
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
Yeah I know

1899
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
I'll play it when it comes out

1900
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
I will be, you know what if the game is good

1901
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
I will be the first one

1902
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
To plop down the money for it the day it comes out

1903
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
Good luck

1904
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
Well if you think about it

1905
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
What is really the advantage here

1906
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
I mean what

1907
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
It's just

1908
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
You get some extra crap

1909
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
I mean why should I risk

1910
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
Myself, I mean as it is

1911
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
Games that come out day one from AAA

1912
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
Are risky investments as it is

1913
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
Considering how broken some of them could be

1914
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
At launch, why am I going to put

1915
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
Risk in the game that may never even

1916
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
Come out

1917
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
It doesn't make any sense that you want my money

1918
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
I mean I know that you need to fund it

1919
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
And stuff but

1920
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
Then again you don't need the funding

1921
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
It's almost like we got to show that these

1922
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
Publishers that people are interested in this game

1923
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
That's a publishers job to figure that shit out

1924
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
Why do they have to show interest in it

1925
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
Alright

1926
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
I'm glad somebody in chat got my joke

1927
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
By the way, come on confide in me

1928
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
Says my name is Sky and I've got something to say

1929
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
That's right

1930
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
I got your joke Rob

1931
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
My name is Rob Roberts and I got something to say

1932
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
That part

1933
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
Amplitude done fucked up kickstarter

1934
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
Cause there's another game

1935
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
That I'm sorry, it was not as good

1936
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
As we all hoped it was going to be

1937
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
I'm sorry, straight up

1938
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
Anyway

1939
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
Let's move on

1940
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
We got more stories for you, Loki

1941
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
Alright

1942
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
So Netflix

1943
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
Has a lot of interesting shows

1944
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
They just showed this week

1945
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
Was a new

1946
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
Dark Crystal series

1947
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
Which looks pretty cool

1948
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
Something else that's also in the pipeline

1949
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
That's a little bit more game related

1950
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
And seems

1951
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
Proper for Netflix

1952
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
They're going to be a new series

1953
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Based on The Witcher

1954
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
The fantasy series of course

1955
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
It is a book series as well as

1956
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
The game series but they're saying that they're

1957
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
Going to be having

1958
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
I guess they have the executive producers

1959
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
Sean Daniel and Jason Brown

1960
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
Who are known for a show

1961
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
Called The Expanse which I have never

1962
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
Seen nor heard of

1963
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
They're going to be following I guess

1964
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
Sounds like the books

1965
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
So it'll be interesting

1966
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
I don't know if you guys have all seen the pictures on Twitter

1967
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
But it's very clear that Julian Assange

1968
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
Is going for the lead role in this

1969
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
From his latest look

1970
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
I don't know if you all have seen that

1971
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
Such an awful bullet

1972
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
So

1973
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
The Witcher has some sexy

1974
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
Stuff in there

1975
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
There's going to be so many boobs in this show

1976
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
It's not a Witcher game

1977
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
Unless

1978
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
Sign me up because

1979
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
We need some Game of Thrones replacements

1980
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
You can have that

1981
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
As long as this time

1982
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
When he stands up in the tub

1983
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
I don't want no suds

1984
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
So

1985
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
Anyway

1986
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
So yeah

1987
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
William Murderface in chat says

1988
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
Witcher hype

1989
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
The direction

1990
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
And the way the stories

1991
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
Are told in The Witcher and all that

1992
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
Is really really well done

1993
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
If they bring some of that to a television show

1994
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
Like seriously

1995
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
It does have the ability to be something

1996
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
On a Game of Thrones-esque kind of level

1997
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
It really does

1998
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
I think the source material for The Witcher

1999
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
Which I understand is also based off a novel series

2000
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
So there's all that

2001
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
That we have to consider as well

2002
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
But I think it could

2003
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
Do really well in a way that video game

2004
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
Media hasn't really been done before

2005
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
Although

2006
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
Is it really video game media if it was all a book to begin with

2007
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
But remember we have Castlevania coming too

2008
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
We'll keep our fingers crossed

2009
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
Can we get boobs in that too?

2010
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
Why not?

2011
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
Well look at the original artwork

2012
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
For Symphony of the Night

2013
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
That's right

2014
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
Granted the Dark Crystal is going to be a little awkward

2015
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
But I mean it's necessary

2016
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
In order to keep a certain level of quality

2017
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
Across all Netflix shows

2018
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
Alright one more story for you guys

2019
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
Before we get to the classic game of the week

2020
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
This one's a very modern game actually

2021
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
I know a lot of people were really hyped for the

2022
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
Destiny 2 event

2023
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
That they had earlier this week

2024
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
Where they showed some footage of the game

2025
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
And shown off all the features coming to Destiny 2

2026
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
Destiny 2 of course

2027
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
Is going to be coming out for the PC

2028
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
As well as the Playstation 4 and the Xbox One

2029
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
No longer on Playstation 3 or Xbox 360

2030
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
Although that doesn't surprise anybody

2031
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
But it will be coming out on the consoles

2032
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
What was it? Early September

2033
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
I think was the date on the console right?

2034
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
For Playstation 4 and Xbox One

2035
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
There is no release date for PC yet

2036
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
It will not be out

2037
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
It sounds like the exact same day as September 8th

2038
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
But here's what is really interesting

2039
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
About the PC version of

2040
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
Destiny 2

2041
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
It's better than both the other versions

2042
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
Well that's one

2043
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
That's an opinion

2044
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
But the other thing that's also interesting

2045
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
Is that it's going to be released on Battle.net

2046
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
Dun dun dun

2047
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
Wait a minute

2048
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
Blizzard's thing? Yes

2049
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
But remember who owns Blizzard?

2050
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
Activision

2051
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
It's Activision Blizzard

2052
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
What does Activision like? Greed

2053
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
That's right

2054
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
So no more 30% cut from the Steam store

2055
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
By releasing that thing on Battle.net

2056
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
And also you guys

2057
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
And this is something I don't see

2058
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
Any of the press really getting into

2059
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
That I think is a huge element

2060
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
Of this and why they're going

2061
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
To the Battle.net launcher for all this

2062
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
Sure the fact that they'll get to keep the cut

2063
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
Of all the digital sales and all that

2064
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
That's a great perk I'm sure

2065
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
You guys

2066
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
I think sometimes severely

2067
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
Underestimate the Blizzard fandom

2068
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
And

2069
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
Don't underestimate the dark side

2070
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
Don't underestimate the fucking Blizzard fandom

2071
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
Don't

2072
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
Because they're fucking crazy

2073
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
And I say that as a Blizzard fan

2074
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
I do I do I love Blizzard fans

2075
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
I had a great time at Blizzcon

2076
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
They're nuts and I mean that in a good way

2077
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
Because why do I say it that way?

2078
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
Why do you think something like Overwatch was

2079
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
As successful as it was? Because

2080
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
It got people that were playing

2081
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
World of Warcraft

2082
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
That were playing Diablo

2083
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
To say hey here's a shooter

2084
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
From this same company that I love

2085
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
That's coming out and I want to try this

2086
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Or this team based game objective game

2087
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
Or whatever you don't want to call it a shooter

2088
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
And I want to try this out

2089
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
One game I didn't talk about during my gaming week

2090
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
That I actually have been playing quite a bit of

2091
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
Is Heroes of the Storm

2092
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
Why have I been playing Heroes of the Storm? By Blizzard

2093
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
Because I want the fucking

2094
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
Loot boxes for Overwatch

2095
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
That you get by playing a bunch of

2096
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
Matches with friends that's really what it boils

2097
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
Down to so Blizzard

2098
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
Very very very very very good

2099
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
At doing the synergy thing and here

2100
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
Come try our free game to get stuff

2101
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
In the other game and all this stuff now not that I'm saying

2102
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
That Destiny 2 is necessarily going to be a part of that

2103
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
Although this

2104
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
Certainly does open the door for Destiny

2105
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
Characters to start showing up in Heroes of the Storm

2106
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Just saying

2107
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
Or Overwatch

2108
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
Well Overwatch is kind of

2109
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
It's own universe you don't exactly see the lost Vikings

2110
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
Running around in Overwatch

2111
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
But Heroes of the Storm is kind of that mixing

2112
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Pot for all the Blizzard things

2113
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
I'm just saying it opens the door to it I'm not saying it's going to happen

2114
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
It just opens the door to it

2115
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
But also

2116
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
And this is another huge thing too is that

2117
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
If you're playing World

2118
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
Of Warcraft which a lot of people

2119
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
Still are some people are

2120
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
Selling their Warcraft gold

2121
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
For real money through

2122
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
This Blizzard token

2123
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
So they have this Blizzard balance

2124
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
That they're building up which most people

2125
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
Are using to therefore buy

2126
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
Overwatch loot boxes

2127
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
But now they could save

2128
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
That money and buy

2129
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
Copies of Destiny 2 because that's going to be

2130
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
Through Battle.net and you know what after they

2131
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
Announce this that Destiny 2 is going to be

2132
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
A part of Battle.net the prices

2133
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
In gold of those WoW tokens went through the

2134
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
Fucking roof because

2135
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
You've got a ton of players now

2136
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
Who are trying to save up money in their

2137
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
Battle.net balance so they can basically

2138
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
Buy Destiny 2

2139
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
And Blizzard's still making money because

2140
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
Somebody's buying those WoW tokens to

2141
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
You know then that money is getting basically

2142
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
Reallocated to purchasing

2143
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
Destiny 2 so

2144
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
Dungeon Buster

2145
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
In chat says Destiny normally doesn't do any

2146
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
Cross-promotion well it's

2147
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
It's a crazy world out there

2148
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
It's a different game and this is going to be very very

2149
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
Very interesting for

2150
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
PC also some other things

2151
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
That should be mentioned about PC there's like the

2152
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
Full on 4K on PC right

2153
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
I didn't see a lot of the oh here it is on

2154
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
PC Destiny will support 4K

2155
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
That's 3820 by 2160

2156
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
Un-capped frame rate

2157
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
Custom key mapping text chat

2158
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
And now that it's on Battle.net

2159
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
If I'm playing Destiny 2

2160
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
I can send

2161
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
Dark Sakura a message through

2162
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
Battle.net while she's playing World of Warcraft

2163
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
And I can send her a message and I can say like

2164
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
It's a lip sync Jamie

2165
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
What part of that don't you understand

2166
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
I'd like to keep it on please

2167
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
And then there's an adjustable

2168
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
FOV field of view detailed

2169
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
PC setting screen 21 by 9

2170
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
Monitor support and so on

2171
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
So I mean all this just basically

2172
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
Cemented for me oh yeah I'm

2173
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
Skipping consoles and I'll be buying this on

2174
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
PC like I

2175
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
Kind of fell off the Destiny wagon because

2176
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
Expansion expansion

2177
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
Expansion but I'm willing to

2178
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
Give it another go at Destiny 2 because

2179
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
Destiny 2 at least is going to hit the reset button on all

2180
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
That because you know none of that stuff carries

2181
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
Over so I

2182
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
I want to try it with mouse and keyboard on PC

2183
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
I never played the first one I have it I just never played it

2184
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
Yeah

2185
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
Tigerclaw does point out and say

2186
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
You'll need a good graphics card if you

2187
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
Want to play in 4K yes yes you will

2188
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
Need a good graphics card if you want to play in 4K I actually

2189
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
Don't even have a 4K monitor so that's not gonna

2190
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
Do me a lick of good but maybe I'll

2191
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
Buy one for Christmas or

2192
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
Something when

2193
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
I don't know if it's worth it for

2194
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
4K price

2195
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
Stick with feeling what you got

2196
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
Oh Bobby has no shame

2197
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
At all saying that in the battle net system

2198
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
I could send Jamie a message while she's playing

2199
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
Wow I'm playing a game by

2200
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
Bungie it's immediate predecessor is

2201
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
A very classic game we should feature it

2202
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
If only you could see

2203
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
If only you could see

2204
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
If only you could see

2205
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
She's got one finger flying right now

2206
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
For you Bobby

2207
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
I'm saluting ya

2208
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
Well let's see what she did pick for the classic game of the week this week

2209
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
Every week Dark Soccer

2210
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
Jumps into the gaming vault and finds a game

2211
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
That she thinks hey

2212
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
Put down your destiny

2213
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
Sign out of battle net and play this

2214
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
Cause this game's not on battle net and it's awesome

2215
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
Alright

2216
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
Dark Soccer what is the classic game of the week?

2217
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
This is a game

2218
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
I spent a shitload of time playing

2219
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
In the arcade like a lot

2220
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
I was kinda hooked on this game

2221
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
We already did Dance Dance Revolution

2222
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
Girl

2223
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
APB

2224
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
All Points Bulletin came out in 1987

2225
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
By Atari

2226
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
Atari games at the time

2227
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
Where you play Officer Bob not the drag queen

2228
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
Who is

2229
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
A rookie police officer

2230
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
And you have to go through

2231
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
Different parts of the game

2232
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
One of them is you go through

2233
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
And you pull people over

2234
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
For minor infractions

2235
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
Well you ticket people for minor infractions

2236
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
With the whole targeting system

2237
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
Or you can pull over

2238
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
Bad offenders and then eventually

2239
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
You get down to where you apprehend criminals

2240
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
When they put out an APB

2241
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
The cabinet

2242
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
Is a neat little cabinet

2243
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
It looks kinda like a police car

2244
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
Where it's got the siren

2245
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
Lights above on top

2246
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
Has a gas pedal, a steering wheel

2247
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
And

2248
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
Even a little seat

2249
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
I think some of them had a seat

2250
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
I remember playing one that didn't have it

2251
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
It really is just a

2252
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
Cartoony little game

2253
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
But it's not easy

2254
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
It is not an easy game

2255
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
In fact even the developers

2256
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
Said that over the development cycle

2257
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
The gameplay got a lot more complicated

2258
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
Than they originally had planned

2259
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
It did have some other

2260
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
Home releases

2261
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
But let's get a little bit more into the game itself

2262
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
Which I think is funny because you play as Car 54

2263
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
Do you remember that show

2264
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
Where Are You?

2265
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
Exactly, that had, what's his face

2266
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
The Playroom in Munster?

2267
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
Uh, yes

2268
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
I don't remember his name

2269
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
I'll have to look it up again

2270
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
He was one of the officers in that show

2271
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
I mean, and I might

2272
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
But it wasn't around when Car 54

2273
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
Where Are You was on TV

2274
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
But it did come on Nick at Night

2275
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
Not that old bitches

2276
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
Nick at Night used to run all those shows

2277
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
When we were kids

2278
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
Dennis the Menace from the 50's

2279
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
Was like prime time on Nickelodeon

2280
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
When they thought to make kids cute they had to scream

2281
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
Hey Mr. Woman

2282
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
Pull over buddy

2283
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
So on top of this

2284
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
This is also like every old stereotype

2285
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
You get bonuses for

2286
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
Every day where you arrest over the quota

2287
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
And you can pick up donuts

2288
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
That extend your time limit

2289
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
For the day

2290
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
I know donuts extend my time limit for the day

2291
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
Donuts expand

2292
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
My ability to even

2293
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
They expand my waistline

2294
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
Right?

2295
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
Anyway you can also drive through filling stations

2296
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
To refuel your patrol car

2297
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
You can also

2298
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
Upgrade your patrol car with brakes, guns

2299
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
Armor, radar

2300
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
I just keep thinking of this police car

2301
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
Turning into something from Road Warrior

2302
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
So you start off

2303
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
By ticketing for common

2304
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
Misdemeanors like littering

2305
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
You pull up behind them

2306
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
Tell them to bend over

2307
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
Then you press the siren button

2308
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
And then have them pull over

2309
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
Sometimes you have to kind of

2310
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
Over and over

2311
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
Speeding

2312
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
Comes into the game later

2313
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
And you also

2314
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
You also have to rescue different

2315
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
Not rescue but arrest different

2316
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
Fugitives

2317
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
And then you have to violently shake them

2318
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
To get a confession out of them

2319
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
Before the chief enters the room and you have a

2320
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
Confessometer

2321
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
Unless it's a baby, don't shake the baby

2322
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
God Rob

2323
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
Now I'm all sad because I see that little baby's face

2324
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
Aww

2325
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
Anyway

2326
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
So anyway

2327
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
Your life gauge is kind of like a demerit meter

2328
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
Um

2329
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
So if you hit that

2330
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
Then you get too many demerits

2331
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
You are fired

2332
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
So you can get fired in the game

2333
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
And you earn those by colliding with cones

2334
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
Or other vehicles when your siren is off

2335
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
Shooting

2336
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
Non offender vehicles

2337
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
Running into donut huts and pedestrians

2338
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
Running out of gas

2339
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
And failing to get a confession

2340
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
You can also

2341
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
Get demerits when your car explodes

2342
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
Or when you get hit by a train

2343
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
Or high speed collisions

2344
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
You know just all kinds of shit

2345
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
So basically you have to be perfect

2346
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
Um

2347
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
Now um the seat that I was talking about

2348
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
By the way it looks like it was detachable

2349
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
And I remembered because the first version I played

2350
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
Didn't have the seat on it

2351
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
Um APB had a really long

2352
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
Development process though like I mentioned earlier

2353
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
And so as it went on

2354
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
They added so many

2355
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
Things to it that it really became

2356
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
Complicated much more so than they had envisioned

2357
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
Um it was

2358
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
Pretty well received

2359
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
For the time it had great high resolution graphics

2360
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
The cabinet design was fairly new

2361
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
Especially with having the flashing lights

2362
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
On top it really made it attractive

2363
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
Um and

2364
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
It's difficulty was something

2365
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
That kept people going in to try to

2366
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
Master it you know

2367
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
So um

2368
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
There were home versions

2369
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
Mostly developed by Tengen

2370
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
Um there was

2371
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
A version on GameCube

2372
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
Actually I'm getting way ahead of the

2373
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
Original releases

2374
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
The original home versions

2375
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
Were Amiga, Atari

2376
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
ST, Commodore 64

2377
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
ZX Spectrum in 1989

2378
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
And then there was an Atari Lynx version

2379
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
That came out in 1991 which I think

2380
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
I have it I'll have to ask

2381
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
Um for the later versions we had

2382
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
A GameCube version, PS2 and Xbox

2383
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
As part of Midway Arcade Treasures 2

2384
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
And a PC as Midway

2385
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
Arcade Treasures Deluxe Edition

2386
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
And later on was part of the Midway

2387
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
Arcade Origins in 2012

2388
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
And there you go APB

2389
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
That's the game

2390
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
I have to admit I've only played the

2391
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
Slightest bit of this I think it was in one of those

2392
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
Like Midway collection things cause you know

2393
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
They have all the old Atari games in those too like the

2394
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
This is totally the same hardware

2395
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
It's like 720 in some of those other games

2396
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
Yeah the same era

2397
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
I think this is in one of those so I've only played like the

2398
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
Lightest bit of it but yeah I remember it being freaking hard

2399
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
It is but it's super

2400
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
Fun and I mean just the

2401
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
Cabinet itself you know

2402
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
When we got one

2403
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
At my Aladdin's castle

2404
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
That shows you how

2405
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
Long ago it was when I first

2406
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
Saw this one which I ended up eventually

2407
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
Working at when I was in college so

2408
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
Um but

2409
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
There amongst the carpeted walls and

2410
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
Everything was this shiny new game

2411
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
And I really enjoyed it yes it had

2412
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
Carpeted walls

2413
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
The arcade nice had carpeted

2414
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
Walls like you sound sound proving

2415
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
Yeah

2416
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
But true story carpeted walls at roller rink

2417
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
I tore up my jeans and my knee

2418
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
Rolling going at high

2419
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
Speed into one of those walls so I had

2420
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
Bad memories of carpeted walls

2421
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
Alright there it is your classic

2422
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
Game of the week APB

2423
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
Alright a good

2424
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
Good from a real much

2425
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
Better era of Atari than some of

2426
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
Our more recent memories although those

2427
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
Flashback consoles are still pretty sweet for what it's worth

2428
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
Anyway we're going to take a quick break but we have

2429

Reboot which started tonight but thankfully

2446
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
There's ways to do that online they got this

2447
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
Hulu thing the Amazon thing there's a lot of

2448
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
Ways to do that so I just have to figure out which ones gonna work

2449
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
For me and be watching that pretty

2450
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000

2452
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
Any other shows I should be watching

01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
There's a lot of stuff

2454
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
Yeah Kimmy Schmidt season 3 I still need to

2455
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
Finish season 2 yes you do

2456
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
My wife quit in season 2 as well

2457
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
So I don't know

2458
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
I need to finish Sense8 season 2

2459
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
As well I started it and I liked

2460
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
Well the Christmas episode was just basically

2461
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
The Christmas episode was practically like the

2462
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
VR thing we were talking about earlier

2463
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
With Christmas and New Years and it really

2464
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
Was the Christmas episode

2465
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
But I watched the first episode

2466
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
As well and it was good I liked it

2467
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
I liked the way it ended so I need to watch more

2468
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
Sense8 and even Shane is you know

2469
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
Bugging me about it he's like I'm gonna ruin it for you if you don't

2470
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
Finish it Crazy Ex-Girlfriend

2471
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
Is worth a watch yes absolutely

2472
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
I don't know that one so it's hilarious

2473
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
It's well written and they got musical

2474
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
Numbers in every show I mean it's

2475
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
Very it's seriously very well written

2476
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
The pilot episode has a song called the Sexy Getting

2477
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
Ready song okay

2478
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
Sounds good oh some folks in chat

2479
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
Suggesting the MST3K reboot

2480
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
Yeah

2481
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
Honestly though I've been kind of spoiled

2482
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
With Rift Tracks

2483
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
It's kind of hard to go back

2484
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
To that but

2485
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
I'll have to give it another try

2486
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
I watched the first episode of the Bill Nye

2487
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
Science show

2488
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
It was okay

2489
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
I hear he's a bit preachy though

2490
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
It's a little bit but I hope

2491
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
They give him another season

2492
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
I think it maybe just needs a little time to work out some of the kinks

2493
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
So I hope they give him another season

2494
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
But I liked it

2495
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
I just didn't love it

2496
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
A lot of Netflix shows I'm like oh my god

2497
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
These are so good

2498
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
It's not Netflix but it's Hulu

2499
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
Everybody is telling me fucking watch it

2500
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
Everybody is like fucking watch it

2501
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
But just be ready to just want to

2502
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
Cry for hours and hours

2503
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
After you watch the first couple episodes

2504
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
I guess there's like it's too real

2505
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
Have you read the book?

2506
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
No of course not

2507
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
I don't read a lot of books

2508
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
Books?

2509
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
Well it came out like 30 years ago

2510
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
So it's not new

2511
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
I had actually started it when I was in

2512
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
Middle school

2513
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
And had to put it down

2514
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
I haven't picked it up since

2515
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
I planned on going back

2516
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
I could read the Divine Comedy

2517
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
In middle school

2518
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
But yet that book hit me hard

2519
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
So I had to put it down

2520
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
I'm going to try to pick it back up and finish it

2521
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
For a book that was written in the 80s

2522
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
About current events and future predictions

2523
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
It's held up extremely well

2524
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
And terrifyingly so

2525
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
What was the other thing I was going to mention?

2526
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
Taking it with all these

2527
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
On demand things

2528
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
Let me go to chat I guess since I can't remember what it is

2529
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
Brad from Pod Culture says

2530
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
Gotham is okay

2531
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
I watched half the first season of that

2532
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
Okay is a good word to describe it

2533
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
Not watching any of the DC shit until Wonder Woman comes out

2534
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
I'm hearing the movie is getting good reviews

2535
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
Out the gate

2536
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
That's good

2537
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
But I also hear that it's the only good thing

2538
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
In their cinematic universe

2539
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
Well

2540
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
Unless we count the Nolan Batman movies

2541
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
Because I thought those were great

2542
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
I liked all of them

2543
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
Not even just the Heath Ledger one

2544
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
I liked them all

2545
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
Didn't they reboot that universe away though?

2546
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
Like they do every couple of years

2547
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
That was the Christian Bale one

2548
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
They were going to do a Batman with Batfleck

2549
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
But I don't know if that's actually happening or not

2550
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
Maybe?

2551
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
And Brad from Pod Culture does have a good point

2552
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
He says DC television is way better than the DC movies

2553
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
That also requires a time commitment

2554
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
That I would be taking away from

2555
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
At least

2556
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
I would be taking away from finishing Luke Cage and Iron Fist

2557
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
And Daredevil before Defenders comes out

2558
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
That's my problem TV

2559
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
TV is such a huge time

2560
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
Because I only give a shit about things that involve Jessica Jones

2561
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
I've heard that it's safe to skip Iron Fist

2562
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
And you're not missing anything

2563
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
I

2564
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
I've always liked Iron Fist and I read a good

2565
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
Bit of Iron Fist and Power Man

2566
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
In like the early 80's

2567
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
What I want to see

2568
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
Is a Misty Knight and Colin Wing series

2569
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
I want to see Daughters of the Dragon

2570
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
That would make me

2571
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
So happy

2572
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
So make it happen

2573
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
I remember what I was going to say about Hulu

2574
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
So I tried watching a show on Hulu

2575
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
Well Hulu does have the Golden Girls

2576
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
So we're thankful for Hulu for that

2577
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
But I tried watching a show that

2578
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
Shane or somebody thought I would like called Difficult People

2579
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
And I thought it was so

2580
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
Like I really tried to

2581
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
I watched a good like 7 or 8 episodes of it

2582
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
And I'm like this show is just not funny

2583
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
Like people

2584
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
It bothers me in shows

2585
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
When people don't

2586
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
Talk right

2587
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
That was the problem in Difficult People

2588
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
Was that they would talk about something

2589
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
And then it was like oh here's this completely

2590
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
Like side reference to a pop culture event

2591
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
That maybe 2% of America

2592
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
Is familiar with type of thing

2593
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
That's not talking to me

2594
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
Which I understand kind of why

2595
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
That type of show exists in that format

2596
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
It's like Family Guy in real life almost

2597
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
It's kind of like

2598
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
Oh so it's not bad funny the way that Seinfeld wasn't funny

2599
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
Yeah no no

2600
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
But then the other show

2601
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
This is the one that gets me

2602
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
And I swear I'll get back to video games

2603
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
But TV is important too

2604
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
Gilmore Girls is the other show I can't fucking watch

2605
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
Because of that I tried watching Gilmore Girls

2606
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
And people love Gilmore Girls

2607
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
And I tried watching it and I'm like

2608
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
People don't fucking talk like that

2609
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
It is driving me up a fucking wall

2610
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
The way they talk on the show

2611
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
Anyway sorry Jamie I had to get that off my chest

2612
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
Well you said Golden Girls

2613
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
Did you see Golden Girls Clue?

2614
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
Oh of course

2615
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
Like 2 people posted it to your wall

2616
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
Thank you for noticing yes 2 people posted it to my wall

2617
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
Which is I never

2618
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
Get mad and I never go and say

2619
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
Somebody else beat you to it because I go

2620
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
I'm touched that people

2621
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
Think of me when they think of the Golden Girls

2622
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
The only thing I have to say about Golden Girls Clue is

2623
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
Could they not

2624
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
Afford Estelle Getty's license

2625
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
Or likeness like what the fuck is up with that box art

2626
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
Like she doesn't

2627
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
Look right at all

2628
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
Who did Blanche do?

2629
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
In which room?

2630
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,000
In which room and with what

2631
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
Prophylactics

2632
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
Come on confide in me and chat says

2633
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
Binge the British version of Queer as Folk

2634
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
Oh years ago

2635
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
I saw it years ago

2636
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
I love all the Doctor Who references in that show

2637
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
Yes actually yeah

2638
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
Like when he's at the pub and his co-workers like

2639
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
Ex-dominate

2640
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
I think I watched that around the time that the

2641
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
Eccleston Doctor Who episodes are coming out

2642
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
And somebody told me that it was the same director

2643
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
And I was like after watching the British

2644
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
Queer as Folk I was like oh that's fucking obvious

2645
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
This guy is a total boner for Doctor Who

2646
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
What's his fuck

2647
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
Wrestle T Davies

2648
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
And then there was the American Queer as Folk

2649
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
Which was

2650
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
How many

2651
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
Good British shows get ruined when they're Americanized

2652
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
It was a thing that we had

2653
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
In the olden days ten years ago

2654
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
For representation

2655
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
And boy we've come a long way

2656
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
Let's just leave it at that

2657
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
I would say

2658
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
For British shows coming to America

2659
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
The Office wasn't bad

2660
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
But I love the British Office

2661
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
The Ma Na Ma Na scene

2662
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
Like cracked me up so fucking hard

2663
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
On the British Office like in just ways

2664
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
That TV here never makes me laugh that hard

2665
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
You know what else got fucked up? Being human

2666
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
I watched the shit out of that

2667
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
Out of the British version

2668
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
And then we got the US one and I tried to

2669
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,000
Watch the first episode and I was like no I can't

2670
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
But did you know that the first episode

2671
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
Of the Office in the US and the first episode of the

2672
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
Office in the UK are the same like script

2673
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
Like they might have done some

2674
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
Cuts because the commercials is different over there

2675
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
But like

2676
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
It's like the same script and I was like wow

2677
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000
It's so different though

2678
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
But I think a lot of that is just the strength of

2679
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
Ricky Gervais

2680
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
Versus you know

2681
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
Why can't I think Steve Carell

2682
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
You know and just kind of like how they are

2683
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
Yeah that guy

2684
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
Alright we got to move on y'all

2685
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,000
Let's get back into some gaming news

2686
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,000
We're going to do some rapid fire news

2687
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,000
Yes so this is kind of an interesting experiment

2688
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
But you know

2689
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
Goes to show you can watch almost anything on Twitch

2690
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
So they have

2691
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
This cool

2692
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
Neural network

2693
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
Named Charles and what Charles does

2694
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
Is it's learning how to

2695
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
Drive I guess self driving

2696
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
Cars almost in Grand Theft Auto

2697
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
5 so basically

2698
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
It's basing all the data off

2699
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
Of what it sees

2700
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
In the actual screenshots

2701
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
And everything to make its decision

2702
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
So you can actually watch it drive

2703
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
And

2704
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
Or drive poorly because that's

2705
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
Kind of what happens sometimes but

2706
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
It's pretty interesting so that's one thing

2707
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
You can check out on

2708
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
Twitch

2709
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
And then of course you know

2710
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
The user you'd want to look for

2711
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
Is Sentdex

2712
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,000
Is the guy that's hosting that so check that out

2713
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
Because it's kind of interesting

2714
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
I watched a few minutes of that and I was entertained

2715
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
And then

2716
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
Finally we're going to get

2717
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
A release date for South Park

2718
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,000
The Fractured But Whole

2719
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
That's going to be coming out in October

2720
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
So October 17th

2721
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
Is when it's going to be coming out

2722
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
And with that they have

2723
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
Released a new trailer which I

2724
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
Do need to watch and I do want to pick up the game

2725
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
Because the first one was awesome

2726
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
Do we think it will actually

2727
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
Come out? I think this time

2728
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
I think it's ready

2729
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
I hope so too

2730
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
And I know a lot of people are looking forward to that game

2731
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
And really I'm one of them I think it's going to be a good game

2732
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
By the way I have to answer this

2733
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
In chat because it's important

2734
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
Ragenator in chat says

2735
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
Speaking of Twitch I've heard that every episode of

2736
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
Mr. Rogers Neighborhood is coming to Twitch

2737
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,000
You're late to the party Ragenator

2738
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,000
It's been going on for a few days now actually

2739
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,000
We were watching

2740
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,000
The other night and I think we were in the

2741
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
Episodes from 1969 so it was in color

2742
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
They're probably in the early 70's by now

2743
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
But I mean that marathon

2744
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
Is going to be going on a while because Mr. Rogers

2745
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000
That show didn't end until

2746
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
2001

2747
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
It was like 30 years worth of television

2748
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
It was a long time so they got a lot of episodes to go

2749
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,000
However I got to say

2750
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000
Yes I've been watching some Mr. Rogers on Twitch

2751
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
And again chat

2752
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
Fucking makes it

2753
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
Kudos to the chatters who

2754
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
Make that an experience

2755
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,000
So are there any awesome memes coming out of this?

2756
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
No not really the same thing but it's like

2757
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
The type of stuff like when

2758
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
There was one episode he was doing

2759
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
He was doing like a seesaw

2760
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,000
He was weighing the fruit or something

2761
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
And when it balanced

2762
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,000
People were like Vak, Vak

2763
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,000
He's cheating and all this stuff

2764
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
Science, OMG

2765
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,000
The little emotes and all that

2766
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,000
People are really funny

2767
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
There's of course some of the

2768
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
Stupid shit that you would expect too

2769
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
Whenever Lady Abberline

2770
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
What's the real life lady

2771
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
That plays, not Lady Elaine

2772
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
The funky nose one

2773
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
Lady Abberline is her name or something

2774
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
Aberdeen?

2775
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
The one who's like

2776
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
Like his niece or something

2777
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
Yeah, yeah

2778
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
Maybe in chat, chat probably

2779
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,000
Knows it too, when she shows up

2780
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
Some toilet comments show up in chat

2781
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000
But it's not like, it doesn't cross the line

2782
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
Like it's just like, you kind of

2783
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
Chalk it up to the whole like

2784
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
Lady Abberline

2785
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
Oh it's pervy dude

2786
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,000
At home or whatever

2787
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,000
Who is named Betty Abberline

2788
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
Everything is like their names

2789
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,000
It's funny because obviously I haven't

2790
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:45,000
Watched Mr. Rogers neighborhood in a very

2791
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,000
Fucking long time right

2792
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,000
But like many of you

2793
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,000
I watched it every fucking day

2794
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,000
When I was like 5 or 6 years old

2795
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
Picture picture is my fucking jam

2796
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
So all that stuff

2797
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,000
It's kind of fascinating to go back now

2798
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,000
And it's like

2799
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:03,000
The characters really talk like that

2800
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
Meow, meow, meow, meow, hello

2801
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
Meow, meow, meow, meow

2802
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,000
Adventure, meow, meow, meow

2803
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
I was like, how did that not drive me up a

2804
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,000
Fucking wall, but

2805
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,000
Isn't that how your cat talks?

2806
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
No, my cat

2807
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
Is meow, meow, meow, feed me

2808
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000
I was like, mom

2809
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
Mom

2810
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
Alright

2811
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
Anyhow, sorry for the tangent

2812
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
We're back on TV

2813
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
That one's worthwhile cause they're raising

2814
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
Money for PBS I think at the end of the day

2815
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
I gotta say

2816
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
A fucking smart way to do it

2817
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
In this day and age

2818
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
You guys probably all remember back in the day

2819
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:43,000
When you would watch Mr. Rogers

2820
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:45,000
Then you'd have the telethon comes on

2821
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,000
If you send us $50

2822
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,000
You'll get a free t-shirt or a free book

2823
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:51,000
Or a free VHS tape

2824
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
Of a night at the opera or something

2825
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,000
They would always have those telethons

2826
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,000
Like somebody at PBS

2827
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,000
And probably because of Bob Ross

2828
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,000
Okay, let's not

2829
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,000
It's because of Bob Ross

2830
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:05,000
Changed the fucking game at Twitch

2831
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,000
I'm sure now

2832
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,000
PBS was like, wait a minute

2833
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,000
We wanna do a fundraiser or something over there

2834
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,000
We get like 321 contact or something like that

2835
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,000
Fuck, Square One television

2836
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,000
Square One still hasn't been released

2837
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
On DVD

2838
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,000
They need to do something about that

2839
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,000
Can you imagine MathNet

2840
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,000
I'm gonna stay up

2841
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
For 72 hours straight when that happens

2842
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:29,000
I'll watch MathNet

2843
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,000
Didn't they release MathNet as a separate program

2844
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,000
At some point

2845
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,000
Like Friday

2846
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000
Okay, here we go on TV again

2847
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,000
Friday would always be

2848
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,000
The extended

2849
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:43,000
MathNet episode

2850
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,000
There was only a couple

2851
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,000
Maybe they would have a MathMan

2852
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,000
In the very beginning

2853
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,000
The rest of the episode was MathNet

2854
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
Another really cool thing that PBS did

2855
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
To raise money was on YouTube

2856
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
They remixed certain themes like a year or two ago

2857
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
And those are

2858
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
Oh yeah, some of those are

2859
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
On the music feed

2860
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
They're amazing

2861
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
And Mr. Rogers has one too

2862
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
Mr. Rogers has one, I think Reading Rainbow has one

2863
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
And I think Julia Child has one

2864
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
Julia Child, love it

2865
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
Anyway, back to video games

2866
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
But the worlds are coming

2867
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
As Twitch is airing this stuff

2868
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
It's like our video game and TV worlds

2869
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
Are blending together

2870
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
Anyway, how would you like to buy a video game box

2871
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
For five dollars

2872
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
Yes, you can buy a video game box for five dollars

2873
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
It is the Nintendo Switch

2874
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
Splatoon 2 bundle

2875
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
Excuse me, hiccups

2876
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
If you can't afford the bundle

2877
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
Or perhaps you already own all the stuff

2878
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
Inside it

2879
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
But you just want to have a box

2880
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
For your collection

2881
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
You can buy one for 540 yen in Japan

2882
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
And I should stress

2883
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
This is on the My Nintendo Store in Japan

2884
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
It's not something they're doing here in the US

2885
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
There is no Switch inside

2886
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
No manuals, no boxes, no cords

2887
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
It's just the box

2888
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
The main box

2889
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
No little boxes inside of games or anything

2890
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
So you could also buy this to prank somebody

2891
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
Set it up for really

2892
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
Pranky eBay auctions

2893
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
Oh yeah, yeah

2894
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
Or I'm going to get Loki a gift

2895
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
On a future episode of OLR

2896
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
That's completely empty

2897
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
It's going to be a Splatoon 2 box

2898
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
And inside will just be a note that says

2899
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
I put all of your positive things

2900
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
About Nintendo inside this box

2901
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
And it's empty

2902
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
Those cartridges are so light that you wouldn't be able to tell if you lifted it up

2903
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
It's true

2904
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
The switches are pretty light as it is

2905
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
A lot of those boxes have instructions on the inside

2906
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
Have you looked inside the boxes?

2907
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
Oh yeah, the boxes, that's what they do now

2908
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
They do a one sheet print on the back

2909
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
And that's it

2910
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
But anyway

2911
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
Keep in mind, this box is the system box

2912
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
So it's not

2913
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
No, it's not the game box

2914
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
Alright, anyhow

2915
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
One other thing to mention about

2916
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
Speaking about Nintendo and so forth

2917
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
It's a Mario Kart 8 patch that came out

2918
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
You may have noticed that 1.1 version of Mario Kart 8 came out

2919
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
And it adjusted the time zone issue

2920
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
That we bitched about with the tournament thing last week

2921
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
So to be fair

2922
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
Nintendo fixed that, yay

2923
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
However, they also changed Inkling Girl's animation

2924
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
Apparently

2925
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
She was giving an animation

2926
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
I never really noticed this in her old animation

2927
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
But she was giving the Up Yours animation

2928
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
Which like

2929
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
Here is not super offensive

2930
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
Unless there's a finger coming out of it, right?

2931
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
But I suppose overseas

2932
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
In parts of Europe and so forth

2933
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
Yeah exactly, what she just did there

2934
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
That is a little more

2935
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
Hold your bicep and pump through your fist

2936
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
That's an insult

2937
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
It's the same as the middle finger basically

2938
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
Except if you're in

2939
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
Parts of Europe, namely England

2940
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
The two fingers

2941
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
Where they see the back of your hand

2942
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
That's right

2943
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
So in America your IQ is one

2944
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
In Britain your IQ is two

2945
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
That's how it works

2946
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
It's like one punch versus two punches

2947
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
That's how many licks you're gonna get

2948
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
Alright, so

2949
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
There it is

2950
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
Again, if you want to know why that animation changed

2951
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
That's because in another country

2952
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
It is not polite

2953
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
DarkSakura, what do you have for us before we get to release dates?

2954
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
Some stuff

2955
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
Actually one of the Switch games I've been mildly interested in

2956
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
Has been Arms

2957
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
Which would be why I'd want to get

2958
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
A Switch I think

2959
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
But they are getting a global

2960
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
Test punch event

2961
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
It's actually available right now

2962
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
Apparently on the eShop

2963
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
So if you want to see if you like it

2964
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
Test it!

2965
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
Punch it in the face!

2966
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
Arms

2967
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
Ok that sucked

2968
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
So also in other news

2969
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
We have the E3

2970
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
2001 livestream plans

2971
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
For Sony

2972
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
Monday June 12th

2973
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
Is gonna be at

2974
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
5pm Tuesday June 13th

2975
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
From 12pm to 6pm

2976
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
Live programming

2977
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
Wednesday June 14th from 12 to 6

2978
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
And Thursday June 15th from 12 to 4

2979
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
So you'd be able to watch it all

2980
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:07,000
There are quests to unlock

2981
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,000
Rewards and

2982
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:11,000
Different trailers

2983
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:13,000
To watch and the whole thing will also

2984
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:15,000
Be streamed on YouTube and Twitch

2985
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
Well good luck to my buddy

2986
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,000
Who I'm sure is going to be a part of this

2987
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:21,000
Who used to listen to OLR years and years ago

2988
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,000
And now does that stuff with Sony

2989
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,000
Yay!

2990
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,000
I'm sure he'll be in that

2991
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,000
That's what a lot of the companies are doing now

2992
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:31,000
When you can take your message direct to the people like that

2993
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,000
We know Nintendo is doing a similar thing with Treehouse

2994
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:35,000
Obviously Sony's got their thing going on

2995
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:37,000
We don't know of Microsoft

2996
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:39,000
Microsoft doesn't really have like a

2997
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:41,000
People team right now

2998
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:43,000
Like I know they have Major Nelson

2999
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:45,000
He's kind of like the face of Xbox and so forth

3000
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,000
I don't know, or am I mistaking something?

3001
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:49,000
Yes I know there's the MVP program

3002
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:51,000
And so forth but those folks

3003
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,000
Aren't really like on camera

3004
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,000
Or doing anything with that

3005
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:57,000
So Microsoft doesn't really, like who would host a Microsoft stream

3006
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
If they did something all day long

3007
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:01,000
I guess it would be Major Nelson

3008
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:03,000
But that's a lot for one person to do

3009
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,000
Beam?

3010
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,000
That's a good thought, that's actually a really good thought

3011
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,000
We see on Twitch TV

3012
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,000
We see a lot of the streaming from

3013
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,000
Heroes of the Storm championships

3014
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:15,000
Or League of Legends type of thing

3015
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:17,000
So sure if Microsoft wanted to do an all day long thing

3016
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,000
Beam would be a great place to do it for them

3017
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:21,000
To get some more eyes and accounts over there

3018
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:23,000
When they stream

3019
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:25,000
Their events actually normally

3020
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:27,000
They have it through Microsoft's own site

3021
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:29,000
They've got their Silverlight

3022
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,000
Plug in thing that they use

3023
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:33,000
Were they the ones that had

3024
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:35,000
Adam Sessler and Morgan Webb? Or is that Bethesda?

3025
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:37,000
That's Bethesda

3026
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:39,000
Bethesda, okay, my bad

3027
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:41,000
I thought somebody was using, yeah

3028
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:43,000
Bethesda was using them, so

3029
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,000
Microsoft's the only one that kind of

3030
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:47,000
Doesn't really do the same type of thing as the other companies

3031
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:49,000
Which you know, whatever works for them

3032
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:51,000
Alright

3033
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,000
Moving on, let's travel around the world and check out

3034
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:55,000
What you're going to be getting in stores this week

3035
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:57,000
A little sooner than E3, Loki

3036
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,000
We actually have a Wii U game coming out

3037
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:01,000
Darksiders WarMastered Edition

3038
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:03,000
Out on the Wii U

3039
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:05,000
Also Disgaea 5 Complete

3040
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,000
On the Nintendo Switch

3041
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:09,000
Embers of Murm

3042
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:11,000
On PC and Playstation 4

3043
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:13,000
Impact Winter

3044
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,000
On PC

3045
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:17,000
Oh god, I'm going to butcher this

3046
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:19,000
But let's see, Utawari

3047
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:21,000
Rumono

3048
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:23,000
Mask of Deception on Playstation 4

3049
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:25,000
And Vita

3050
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,000
Switch, finally coming out on PC

3051
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,000
Drive Girls on Vita

3052
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:31,000
Friday the 13th

3053
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:33,000
The game on

3054
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,000
PC, Playstation 4, and Xbox One

3055
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:37,000
Oh, some people looking forward to that

3056
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:39,000
That's pretty awesome, so that's coming out this week as well

3057
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:41,000
On Friday

3058
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:43,000
Still not going to be like the NES version

3059
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,000
Which I'm sorry, the NES version

3060
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:47,000
Gets a bad rap, it's not as bad as

3061
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:49,000
Y'all make it out to be

3062
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:51,000
Was it an action figure that you could buy that actually they had

3063
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:53,000
Yes

3064
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:55,000
Let's see, Get Even

3065
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,000
On PC, Playstation 4

3066
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:59,000
And Xbox One

3067
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:01,000
Guilty Gear Xrd

3068
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:03,000
Revision 2 on

3069
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,000
Playstation 4 and Playstation 3

3070
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:07,000
Rime on PC

3071
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:09,000
Playstation 4 and Xbox One

3072
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:11,000
Samurai Warriors

3073
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:13,000
Spirit of Sinata

3074
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:15,000
On Playstation 4 and

3075
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:17,000
PC

3076
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:19,000
And finally this week we're getting Ultra Street Fighter 2

3077
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:21,000
The final challengers

3078
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:23,000
On the Nintendo Switch

3079
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:25,000
That's it

3080
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:27,000
Let's travel to Japan

3081
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:29,000
No really, let's go to Japan

3082
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:31,000
I'm gonna go

3083
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:33,000
Captain Spike over at Game Buoy just got back from Japan

3084
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:35,000
They did a great episode on that

3085
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:37,000
Princess Irene is on her way to Japan

3086
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:39,000
She left either yesterday or today

3087
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:41,000
I want to go to Japan

3088
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:43,000
But again, I'm worried

3089
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:45,000
Because I don't speak Japanese

3090
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:47,000
I know AkumaJP would help me out

3091
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:49,000
He's a great pal

3092
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,000
You'd actually be surprised the number of people

3093
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:53,000
Who do speak some English

3094
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:55,000
Oh yeah?

3095
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:57,000
I wouldn't want one person to have to worry about me

3096
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:59,000
For a whole trip while I'm out there

3097
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,000
It's a lot to ask one person

3098
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:03,000
Immersion is really good for our education

3099
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:05,000
I guess that's true

3100
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:07,000
Imagine if I could come back and I could actually pronounce

3101
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:09,000
Japanese release dates

3102
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:11,000
You should let me do them sometime

3103
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:13,000
We were gonna trade at one point but then something happened

3104
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:15,000
Oh you got pulled from the show for a few months

3105
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:17,000
And we never ended up switching

3106
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,000
You can take a semester of Japanese and you'd probably get

3107
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:21,000
A lot better with the pronunciation

3108
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:23,000
Education? I know right?

3109
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:25,000
Actually what's funny is that

3110
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:27,000
I am working on studying again

3111
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,000
To try to pass the

3112
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:31,000
First round of JLPT

3113
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:33,000
I think that's what I'm gonna do

3114
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:35,000
With the bidi fund

3115
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:37,000
I'm gonna set my bidi fund on Twitch

3116
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:39,000
So that once I get like $2,000

3117
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:41,000
I'll go to Japan

3118
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:43,000
Funny that you mentioned

3119
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:45,000
There's a game, I think it's an RPG maker game

3120
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:47,000
That's on Steam that's about learning Japanese

3121
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:49,000
I picked it up, I just don't remember what it is

3122
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:51,000
We talked about that on the show once

3123
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,000
Is that the Fight Slimes Learn Japanese one?

3124
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:55,000
I don't think that's what it was called

3125
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:57,000
I know there was only 10 years ago

3126
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:59,000
I don't remember it because it's

3127
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:01,000
Somewhere by Steam library

3128
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:03,000
Good luck finding whatever game that was

3129
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:05,000
Yeah

3130
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:07,000
There is a game out there that

3131
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:09,000
Teaches you Japanese

3132
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:11,000
Alright

3133
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:13,000
And by the way I wouldn't really spend the bidi money

3134
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:15,000
Going to Japan, I probably buy new

3135
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:17,000
Microphones for our studio because I'm gonna

3136
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:19,000
Have to do that bidis or not pretty soon

3137
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:21,000
Alright anyway

3138
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:23,000
Let's travel around the world here to Japan

3139
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:25,000
And virtually we'll talk about

3140
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:27,000
What's coming out on the Playstation 4

3141
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:29,000
We're getting back into some heavy releases now

3142
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:31,000
With all that Golden Week stuff that happened earlier in the month

3143
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:33,000
But we have Hyper Light Drifter

3144
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:35,000
Is making its Japanese release on the Playstation 4 this week

3145
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:37,000
On the 25th

3146
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:39,000
Summer Lesson Miyamoto Hikari edition

3147
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:41,000
And not to be confused with Nintendo's Miyamoto

3148
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:43,000
This is some other type of

3149
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:45,000
Education game I believe

3150
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:47,000
It is a Playstation VR game which I think is very interesting

3151
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:49,000
I'm not sure what it is

3152
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:51,000
You're learning about in this game

3153
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:53,000
But your instructor looks like

3154
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:55,000
A nice Japanese girl that you're

3155
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:57,000
Maybe it's kind of like immersion

3156
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:59,000
I like this shirt that she's wearing

3157
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:01,000
A yeah shirt with a shark on it

3158
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:03,000
It's cute anyway

3159
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:05,000
Miyamoto Hikari edition is out this week

3160
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:07,000
And then Guilty Gear Xrd Rev 2

3161
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:09,000
Is also out in Japan

3162
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:11,000
This week as well

3163
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:13,000
That is all on the 25th

3164
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:15,000
On the 3DS this week

3165
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,000
Nothing, things are slowing down there

3166
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:19,000
On the Switch this week

3167
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:21,000
The Ultra Street Fighter release

3168
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:23,000
Is also making its way to Japan this week

3169
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:25,000
So you have that to look forward to

3170
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:27,000
And then lastly looking at the Vita for this week

3171
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:29,000
Sengoku Hime 7

3172
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:31,000
Is out this week

3173
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:33,000
In a regular and a limited edition

3174
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:35,000
And Love of Love Emperor of Love

3175
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:37,000
That's a whole lot of love

3176
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:39,000
A limited edition on the Vita this week

3177
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:41,000
So check that out

3178
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:43,000
And those games, and I guess I didn't pick it up

3179
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:45,000
Or at least I don't see it in my life

3180
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:47,000
Learn Japanese to Survive

3181
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:49,000
Yes, oh I do have it

3182
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:51,000
Learn Japanese to Survive Hiragana Battle

3183
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:53,000
Is what I've got

3184
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:55,000
I have that one, I actually just bought the Katakana Battle

3185
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:57,000
Even though I read Katakana better than Hiragana

3186
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:59,000
I'll have to check that out

3187
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:01,000
That's the reverse for me

3188
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:03,000
Too many of the Katakana look similar to each other for me

3189
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:05,000
It's just because I've read too many labels

3190
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:07,000
Because if it's something that's Western

3191
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:09,000
It's in Katakana

3192
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:13,000
I still remember one of the first things I ever bought you

3193
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:15,000
Dark Sakura when we were first friends

3194
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:17,000
Was I bought you a Japanese copy of Harry Potter

3195
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:19,000
Do you know I still have it?

3196
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:21,000
Oh I would hope so

3197
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:23,000
It's on my shelf with the little jacket on it

3198
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:25,000
And it still has the insert in it where it explains what a crumpet is

3199
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:27,000
No seriously

3200
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:29,000
That's right

3201
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:31,000
The inner part goes through

3202
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:33,000
What different

3203
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:35,000
Foreign terms would be

3204
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:37,000
Jumper is used in the book

3205
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:39,000
Why didn't the American editions have that?

3206
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:41,000
Because we don't know what crumpets are

3207
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:43,000
Keep in mind

3208
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:45,000
The British one was

3209
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:47,000
Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone

3210
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:49,000
And they changed

3211
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:51,000
I have the British and the US one

3212
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:53,000
They changed a lot

3213
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:55,000
When you get further on

3214
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:57,000
Through the books, the last book is more

3215
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:59,000
Dead even

3216
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:01,000
Because I've read both of those two

3217
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:03,000
But still it's a lot of

3218
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:05,000
They actually shot like two different movies

3219
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:07,000
Yeah but really it was just scenes that

3220
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:09,000
Refer to the item

3221
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:11,000
Anyway I don't know why I

3222
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:13,000
Thought of that but you talking about reading Japanese

3223
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:15,000
Made me think oh remember that book

3224
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:17,000
It's because reading is fundamental

3225
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:19,000
Reading is what?

3226
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:21,000
What part of a lip sync don't you understand, Jamie?

3227
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:23,000
That part

3228
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:25,000
I'd like to keep it on please

3229
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:27,000
The same parts

3230
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
The same parts

3231
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
That was a choice

3232
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
Moving on, how about the UK Dark Saga

3233
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
On the

3234
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
What's today, the 21st?

3235
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
On the 22nd, Trackmania 2

3236
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
Lagoon for PC

3237
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,000
On the 23rd, we have

3238
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
Steel Division Normandy 44

3239
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
Why can't it be Normandy SR2?

3240
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:55,000
May 25th, we have Vanquish for PC

3241
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:57,000
Samurai Warriors

3242
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:59,000
Sanada Maru

3243
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:01,000
Oh it's the same game

3244
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:03,000
They just called it Spirit of Sanada

3245
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:05,000
For the PC one

3246
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:07,000
But it's PC and Playstation 4

3247
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:09,000
And on the 26th

3248
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:11,000
Rime for Xbone

3249
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:13,000
PC and PS4

3250
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,000
Stephanie

3251
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:19,000
That's it, alright

3252
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:21,000
Let's continue on with Dark Sakura

3253
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:23,000
However because she's going to take a dive

3254
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
Ain't gonna do it

3255
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
In case you are

3256
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
Why are you putting your phone number in your email?

3257
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
Did somebody put their phone number in the email?

3258
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
Yeah they did

3259
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
One of these days I'm gonna call you live on air

3260
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
We did that once

3261
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
On a really really early OLR

3262
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
We called somebody and it was so fucking awkward

3263
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
Cause that person was having a bad day

3264
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
You should just call my mom

3265
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
I'm not gonna call that number

3266
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
I would assume some people have it automatically

3267
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,000
In their work emails that they email us from

3268
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:55,000
Oh is it his signature?

3269
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:57,000
Yeah it might be but still

3270
02:12:57,000 --> 02:12:59,000
Anyway I'm gonna call you

3271
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:01,000
Just say hey it's Rob Roberts what you doing?

3272
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:03,000
Hi baby

3273
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:05,000
How you doing?

3274
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:07,000
Well they didn't put a nickname in here so I'm just gonna call them Andrew

3275
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:09,000
Okay

3276
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:12,000
The email about the custom ITG machine last week reminded me

3277
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
Oh here we go again

3278
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
Here we go again

3279
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
Another week

3280
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
It's in the gate

3281
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
It's what this is

3282
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
The in the gate

3283
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
I've always kind of wanted to get an arcade machine

3284
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,000
I think Jamie said she has some

3285
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
And I know Rob has talked about it before

3286
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
Obviously space and funds are big hurdles

3287
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
But I'm also a little afraid of spending a bunch of money

3288
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:38,000
And then having a break and not being able to fix it

3289
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
I'm not completely inept with technology

3290
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
But I know enough to know that I know nothing Jon Snow

3291
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:46,000
Do you have any tips or suggestions as far as places that sell them

3292
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
Upkeeping machines etc?

3293
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
My dream would be to own a DJ Max Technica 3 machine

3294
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
I love that game so much

3295
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
And the Vita and phone Technica games

3296
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
Are merely serviceable limitations

3297
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
A custom DDR ITG machine

3298
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
Would probably be sweet too

3299
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
And there are plenty of other arcade faves

3300
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
I would enjoy having

3301
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
Thanks Andrew

3302
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
I will tell you this

3303
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
Dan and I have owned a number of games over history

3304
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
One of them was our original MAME cabinet

3305
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
That Shermie lived in

3306
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
We would pick up

3307
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
When we were putting a MAME in those

3308
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
We would just pick up

3309
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
Husks of old games

3310
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
And clean them up

3311
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
And actually

3312
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
Getting new arcade

3313
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
I'd say full working arcade machines

3314
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
Is not too far off than

3315
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
Getting pinball tables

3316
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
When Dan started

3317
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
He was actually helping

3318
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
A friend renovate

3319
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
Some machines and getting them working

3320
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
In exchange for our first pinball table

3321
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
Which

3322
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
We've had some

3323
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
Stinkers over time

3324
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
But working on them

3325
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
Taught Dan how to keep working on them

3326
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
You just don't do it until

3327
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
You do it

3328
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
But we've picked up machines on craigslist

3329
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
We got

3330
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
Our Gyruss

3331
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
And you've played our Gyruss

3332
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
Our Gyruss is in good shape

3333
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
All we had to do was fix a fuse in it

3334
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
So you're suggesting

3335
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
That maybe even though this person

3336
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
Knows nothing about arcade machines

3337
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
Admittedly

3338
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
I'm happy you referred to me in the email

3339
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
But the only arcade machine in my house

3340
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
Is a custom thing that Loki built

3341
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
That I haven't turned on in two years

3342
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
Because I think I unplugged something

3343
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
And I don't know how to fix it

3344
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
But at the same time

3345
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
I don't really use it a lot

3346
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
I've thought about it

3347
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
I was gonna say

3348
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
That was a bar top cabinet

3349
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
Kit that I bought

3350
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
I mean you can honestly just build one of your own

3351
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
But I just didn't want to cut all this shit out

3352
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
So really all it would take

3353
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
Is just

3354
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
Throw a computer inside

3355
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
Put a monitor on a computer

3356
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
And run MAME

3357
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
That's probably the cheapest

3358
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
Doing a Dance Dance Revolution cabinet

3359
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,000
That's gonna be fucking expensive and difficult

3360
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,000
Because either A, you're gonna have to build something yourself

3361
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,000
And most likely if you're gonna do that

3362
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
Just build some really nice pads

3363
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,000
Instead of actually having a whole cabinet

3364
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
Because it's gonna be a hassle

3365
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
To fit that in your house

3366
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
Or wherever you're gonna put it

3367
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,000
And then just

3368
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
It'd be probably cheaper anyway

3369
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,000
Back in the day you could get a third mix on the cheap

3370
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
And put anything in it

3371
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
But now they're all different hardware

3372
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
And people want that stuff to do that

3373
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
Here's something that's becoming, are we done with the email yet?

3374
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
Well not quite because I was gonna bring up another suggestion

3375
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
Okay I'm gonna bring on

3376
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
I actually know a subject matter expert on this

3377
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
Because I just texted him we're gonna bring on on this

3378
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
So in just a moment

3379
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
I was just gonna say there's

3380
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
A web show on YouTube

3381
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,000
Called John's Arcade

3382
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
Do you know who hosts that?

3383
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
John from Video Game Outsiders who used to be on All Games with us

3384
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
Back in the day

3385
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
Yeah right?

3386
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
Look what he's doing now

3387
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,000
And look what we're doing now

3388
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
I like to say that I like to watch

3389
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
His show because he does go into the guts

3390
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,000
Of the restoration

3391
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
He answers questions for people

3392
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
And I would probably say he's done a lot more renovation

3393
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
Than Dan and I have done

3394
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
He's learned a lot from his podcasting years

3395
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
That he's applying to his YouTube medium

3396
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
Yeah if I had a basement I would have an arcade

3397
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
Yeah

3398
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
Alright I'm gonna do a quick phone call here

3399
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
Okay

3400
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,000
So this might be somebody you want to say hello to as well

3401
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,000
We're actually gonna call her live on air

3402
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
So this is my pal

3403
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
Melody

3404
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
We're gonna take this call here

3405
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
And I warned her that this is coming through

3406
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
And she might have some people

3407
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
She said she's in the car

3408
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
That she's gonna take this call in the car

3409
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
Hi is Melody there? Hi

3410
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
Hi

3411
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
Hi Melody it's Rob Roberts

3412
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
Here at Orange Lounge Radio

3413
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
How are you my dear?

3414
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000
I'm doing great how are you doing tonight?

3415
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
I am good and thank you for agreeing

3416
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
To come on last minute but you know sometimes we get emails

3417
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
Okay we get emails here on the show

3418
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
I don't know the answer to this question

3419
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
But I know somebody who does

3420
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
And this is what happened tonight is we got an email

3421
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
About and the question was about

3422
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
I want to get

3423
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
Can you paraphrase what was that question we got

3424
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
I want to own a DDR machine basically right?

3425
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
Yeah one of them was I want to own a DDR machine

3426
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
So I think we need to suggest something that's easy to maintain

3427
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
And relatively on the cheap

3428
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
So tell us a little bit about your home arcade

3429
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
Melody

3430
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
The one that keeps expanding

3431
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
Until we run out of space

3432
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
Which is now

3433
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
We started out with one

3434
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
DDR Solo 2000

3435
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
That I'm with DJ Melvis right now

3436
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,000
And it was his

3437
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
And the board on it died

3438
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
It had a bad RAM chip

3439
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
So we have a friend who managed to hook a PS2

3440
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
Into it so it runs off

3441
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
It's a giant PS2 essentially

3442
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,000
Then we stumbled

3443
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
Into a friend who was selling

3444
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
Para Para Paradise

3445
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
Which is the game how can you

3446
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
Brought that home

3447
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
Then went to California Extreme

3448
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,000
The gaming show and realized

3449
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000
I love Dance Maniacs

3450
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
And wanted to own one

3451
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
And I got lucky in that

3452
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
I googled around and found one

3453
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,000
And then decided we wanted

3454
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
Another DDR machine

3455
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
So I hopped on good old eBay

3456
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,000
And discovered

3457
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,000
When I was looking for

3458
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:22,000
DDR Extreme

3459
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,000
I found Revolution X

3460
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:26,000
And we all went

3461
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:28,000
Oh, that would be fun to own

3462
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:30,000
So that came home from Indiana

3463
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,000
Then

3464
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,000
A special Revolution X

3465
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
And that's my friend Christine in the back

3466
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,000
We're all in the car right now

3467
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,000
Hi kids

3468
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:42,000
So

3469
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,000
Then we ended up

3470
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,000
Getting a friend's gauntlet

3471
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,000
Because he doesn't have space

3472
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,000
And then we decided we wanted

3473
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,000
Another DDR when a friend of mine

3474
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,000
Was talking to me about it

3475
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,000
So we currently have

3476
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
3 DDRs, a Para Para Paradise

3477
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
A Dance Maniac, Gauntlet, and Revolution X

3478
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,000
All in one garage

3479
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,000
Even I don't know how you've

3480
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
And you've even gone so far as to

3481
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:08,000
Carpet your garage at this point

3482
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000
Yes

3483
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:12,000
If I'm right don't y'all have a

3484
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,000
We have two disco balls now

3485
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,000
You almost

3486
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,000
Can't see the black light carpet now

3487
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:20,000
Because there's just so many machines in there

3488
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,000
One little sliver of carpet

3489
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
Wow

3490
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
It is turning out to be quite amazing

3491
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,000
And if I'm right don't y'all have a single

3492
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,000
Car garage?

3493
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,000
Yeah

3494
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,000
Technically it's a two car garage

3495
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
But you'd have to get really friendly with that second car

3496
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
They call it a two car garage

3497
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,000
But literally the two cars

3498
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:42,000
Are nothing else

3499
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:44,000
I know what you're talking about

3500
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
And trust me

3501
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
I feel your pain because we've got

3502
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
Two disco balls in my garage now

3503
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:52,000
And three arcade cabinets

3504
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,000
And I'm very jealous of that World Cup

3505
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,000
You know that's my baby

3506
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
And y'all are always welcome to come over and play anytime

3507
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:00,000
Okay so here's the thing

3508
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:02,000
I want to get answered for our emailer

3509
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:04,000
Now obviously when it comes to the money

3510
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,000
When it comes to the money

3511
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,000
I'm not going to ask how you afforded it

3512
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:10,000
Because that's nobody's business

3513
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
If y'all want something bad enough you save for it

3514
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:14,000
That's what it is

3515
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,000
So when it comes to the money you just have to save the money

3516
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:20,000
How did you know that what you were going to get was a good quality?

3517
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,000
It sounds like you took

3518
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,000
You had a friend of a friend

3519
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,000
Referral in a couple of those cases

3520
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:28,000
So you kind of knew that that was good

3521
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,000
But you did the eBay thing

3522
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:32,000
How did you know that you were going to buy something that was going to work?

3523
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
I asked a lot of questions

3524
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,000
In that case

3525
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,000
That was actually for the Revolution X

3526
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:40,000
For those of us who don't know what Revolution X is

3527
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:42,000
It's a 1990's

3528
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:44,000
Shooter game starring

3529
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:46,000
Aerosmith

3530
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:48,000
And it is fantastic

3531
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:50,000
Fantasticly bad

3532
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:52,000
But it is a lot of fun

3533
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:54,000
But I was

3534
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:56,000
Smart enough to kind of know what I was looking at

3535
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:58,000
I played it before once or twice

3536
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:00,000
Mel and Christine

3537
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,000
Have both played it several times

3538
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:04,000
So I asked them

3539
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,000
What should I be asking

3540
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,000
And just asked a lot of detailed questions

3541
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:10,000
When you can't get out

3542
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,000
To actually try the machine yourself

3543
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,000
It's important to know what you're looking at

3544
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,000
And just

3545
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:18,000
You're spending a lot of money on an investment

3546
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:20,000
They need to answer your questions

3547
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:22,000
If you're not comfortable with it, someone else is going to have another machine

3548
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:24,000
And you're going to be fine with that one

3549
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,000
I think that's some really solid advice

3550
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:28,000
Melody, I'm going to let you go

3551
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:30,000
Because obviously this segment

3552
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:32,000
Has taken like 10 minutes of our time now

3553
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:34,000
But I really appreciate you letting me do this to you last minute

3554
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,000
Yeah, not a problem

3555
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
Quite honestly, you know how to get a hold of me

3556
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:42,000
If they have more questions, I'm willing to answer

3557
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,000
Quite honestly, if any listeners have questions

3558
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:46,000
I'm willing to do what I can to help

3559
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
I mean, I'm not an expert

3560
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
By any stretch of the imagination

3561
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:52,000
But I've done this a few times now

3562
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,000
So if people have questions on what they should be looking for

3563
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:56,000
Or how to look for it

3564
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,000
I'm happy to help out

3565
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:00,000
Do you have a Twitter?

3566
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:02,000
I do have a Twitter

3567
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:04,000
What is my Twitter?

3568
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:06,000
anonymous

3569
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
There you go

3570
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:10,000
So you can get a hold of our direct

3571
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,000
You don't have to go through us

3572
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,000
You can reach out to anonymous directly

3573
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:16,000
And get your questions answered

3574
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:18,000
About DDR home ownership

3575
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:20,000
Thank you so much you guys

3576
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:22,000
Have a safe drive wherever you're going

3577
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:24,000
Have fun storming the castle

3578
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,000
Have a good dinner guys

3579
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:28,000
I did a quick search

3580
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:30,000
Bye, take care

3581
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:32,000
Did a quick search on eBay

3582
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,000
And every now and then you can find some pretty good deals

3583
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,000
Too bad it's in Washington

3584
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,000
I made a third mix

3585
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,000
It's missing the hardware

3586
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:42,000
But the pads and everything

3587
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:44,000
It's kind of torn apart

3588
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:46,000
But $167 for the whole cabinet

3589
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:48,000
What? Wow

3590
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,000
So I was like, fuck

3591
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,000
That's all I would want right there

3592
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,000
It's just the pads anyway

3593
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:56,000
It's a good deal, too bad it's in Washington

3594
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:58,000
Jump on that, ends tomorrow

3595
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:00,000
So if you're interested in the Washington area, there you go

3596
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:02,000
And let this be a lesson to anybody that knows me

3597
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:04,000
IRL

3598
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:06,000
It's not the Rolodex I hate, but it's the one next to that

3599
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:08,000
It's the little Rolodex in my head

3600
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:10,000
That's like, oh, so and so has this

3601
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:12,000
So and so does this

3602
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:14,000
And when I hear it, I'm gonna call you

3603
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:16,000
On a moment's notice

3604
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:18,000
Like I just called Melody

3605
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:20,000
There we go, anyway

3606
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:22,000
It was funny, I was thinking of Melody in terms of the

3607
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:24,000
DDR machines

3608
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:26,000
And all the stuff you said about pinball

3609
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:28,000
And all that's great, but I know

3610
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:30,000
Oh my god, when I hear all this, I'm like, Melody

3611
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:32,000
Owns the music game stuff

3612
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,000
Now I didn't know that they had a Revolution X

3613
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,000
And now I'm super jelly because I love

3614
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
That stupid game, because you can go

3615
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:40,000
And find like Steve Perry on the toilet

3616
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:42,000
The last time I was over

3617
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,000
There, we played Dance Mediacs

3618
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:46,000
And they had just got the Revolution X

3619
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:48,000
But the gauntlet is new and now

3620
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:50,000
The carpeting, they're really making an

3621
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:52,000
Arcade out of that, that's Mel's arcade

3622
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:54,000
You wanna talk about John's arcade, now you got Mel's arcade

3623
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:56,000
Competition on the west coast

3624
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:58,000
Dan and I had an off talk about

3625
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:00,000
Next time we look for another house

3626
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:02,000
Of maybe doing a three car garage

3627
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,000
So that he can have a place for the Mustang

3628
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:06,000
The Mustang's got paint on it now

3629
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:08,000
Get one of those insulated garages like I used to have

3630
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:10,000
At the other house, I know that place

3631
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:12,000
Got insanely hot, but with a swamp cooler

3632
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:14,000
That place would have been a great

3633
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:16,000
We had the tornado of doom

3634
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:18,000
That was great, anyhow

3635
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:20,000
Alright, last email, very long answer to that email

3636
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:22,000
But a good one

3637
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:24,000
As a follow up from last week, I neglected to specify

3638
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:26,000
That my headphones are used more for my mobile

3639
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:28,000
Devices than my computer and consoles

3640
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:30,000
This is from Robert M by the way

3641
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,000
Unfortunately by those standards, I really can't use

3642
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
Any of the sets that you recommend

3643
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,000
Coincidentally though, Ninja Sista and

3644
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,000
Pandelicious of Electric Sista-hood

3645
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:40,000
Began their show talking about

3646
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:42,000
Checking out Lucid Sound LS30

3647
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:44,000
Set, as well as the manufacturer

3648
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:46,000
Set for Xbox One, I will definitely have to

3649
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:48,000
Try out the former for myself

3650
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:50,000
How funny, what a coincidence

3651
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:52,000
But yay, yay Electric Sista-hood

3652
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:54,000
I had the chance

3653
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:56,000
To go to this year's Anime St. Louis

3654
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:58,000
In St. Charles and

3655
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:00,000
Was excited to find out that the game room

3656
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:02,000
This year was set up by Tokyo Attack

3657
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:04,000
Who I'm sure Ron was familiar with

3658
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:06,000
I'm familiar with

3659
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:08,000
What's in Rhode Island?

3660
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:10,000
Yes, but they're all over the East Coast

3661
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:12,000
I've also laid out their ads for DerpyCon

3662
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:14,000
Funny

3663
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:16,000
FYI, I've done the DerpyCon

3664
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:18,000
Guidebook

3665
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:20,000
For like four years now

3666
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:22,000
If you're a music game fan on the East Coast, you know

3667
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:24,000
Tokyo Attack, you do

3668
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:26,000
Outstanding Japanese arcade games

3669
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:28,000
Mostly music rhythm and a surprisingly

3670
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:30,000
High representation of Konami machines

3671
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:32,000
Then again, being music games

3672
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:34,000
I got to play the WarioWare-like

3673
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:36,000
The Bishibashi

3674
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:38,000
I love Bishibashi

3675
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:40,000
They have that at Japantown in the arcade

3676
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:42,000
Is it the

3677
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,000
Original Bishibashi or the Bishibashi

3678
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:46,000
Special? I don't know what the difference is

3679
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:48,000
Okay

3680
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:50,000
And of course the Tea Table flipping game

3681
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:52,000
I'm also there

3682
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:54,000
Don't flip it unless you're playing it

3683
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:56,000
I like that sign

3684
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:58,000
Didn't stay as long as I probably should have

3685
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:00,000
But enjoyed wondering

3686
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:02,000
About seeing attendees' costumes

3687
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,000
Lots of Overwatch, of course

3688
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:06,000
Robert M

3689
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:07,000
That's it

3690
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:08,000
Great, awesome

3691
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:09,000
Thanks for the emails you guys

3692
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:10,000
If you want to email us in a future week

3693
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:12,000
Participate at

3694
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:14,000
OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to

3695
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:15,000
Participate

3696
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:16,000
To do those things

3697
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:18,000
Alright, we're going to be taking your calls

3698
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:20,000
Not only do we call out sometimes, but sometimes

3699
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:22,000
I'll call in over at OrangeLoungeRadio

3700
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:24,000
All one word on Skype

3701
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:26,000
But we'll get to those calls after some more news

3702
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:28,000
First off, Loki

3703
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:30,000
It's like this never ends, but

3704
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:32,000
You may remember

3705
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:34,000
It's been a big deal with the whole ZeniMax

3706
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:36,000
Oculus suit

3707
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:38,000
Well that's concluded, of course, with Oculus

3708
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:40,000
Owing ZeniMax some money

3709
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:42,000
So what's the next step?

3710
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:44,000
ZeniMax, of course, is going after Samsung

3711
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:46,000
Because Samsung

3712
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:48,000
Makes a device called the Gear VR

3713
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:50,000
Which is powered by Oculus

3714
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:52,000
Which is powered by profit for

3715
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,000
Bethesda, because they feel that it

3716
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:56,000
Fringes on their intellectual

3717
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:58,000
Property

3718
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:00,000
Is this the same thing? Bobby was talking a lot about

3719
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:02,000
VR stuff on his show tonight, he was talking about something where like

3720
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:04,000
There was a conversation that happened

3721
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:06,000
With like a former, and this whole lawsuit

3722
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:08,000
Is coming from a freaking conversation

3723
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:10,000
That happened between like a

3724
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:12,000
Former employee of a company

3725
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:14,000
It sounded like a stretch

3726
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:16,000
He described it much better than I could because

3727
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:18,000
Admittedly, do not follow all the VR

3728
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:20,000
Drama as much as he does, but you know

3729
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:22,000
Yeah, they're very litigious

3730
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:24,000
So hopefully, I'm wondering

3731
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:26,000
With this, if that's going to be

3732
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:28,000
More of a stretch, because it's like

3733
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:30,000
I don't know how much is really powered by Oculus

3734
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:32,000
I mean, because it's just

3735
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:34,000
It's just a damn image with

3736
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:36,000
It's a basic case

3737
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:38,000
There's no real hardware in the

3738
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:40,000
The device, so I don't know

3739
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:42,000
It might be a little bit trickier, but

3740
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:44,000
But they feel that they have precedent

3741
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,000
Based off the last Oculus

3742
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,000
Are they drunk with power now? Because what happened with Facebook

3743
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:50,000
Is that's what's happening?

3744
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:52,000
Dude, I get it

3745
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:54,000
That you're suing these people

3746
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:56,000
Let's see you put a VR device in

3747
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:58,000
If you're going to sue all these people over

3748
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:00,000
Your technology being used

3749
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:02,000
Let's see what this is going to be

3750
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:04,000
Are you going to sit on it?

3751
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:06,000
I just don't fucking care

3752
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:08,000
I mean, like

3753
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:10,000
Fallout VR might be cool, but

3754
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:12,000
I don't know

3755
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:14,000
Hey, like a

3756
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:16,000
Skyrim type of VR thing

3757
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:18,000
Might be really rad

3758
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:20,000
I'd be down with that too

3759
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:22,000
Alright, well let's move on to something else

3760
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:24,000
That I think a lot of us were down with

3761
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:26,000
And then it was suddenly gone

3762
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:28,000
Y'all know how Scalebound got cancelled, right?

3763
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:30,000
Microsoft was teaming up with

3764
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:32,000
Platinum Games to do Scalebound

3765
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:34,000
And it just got cancelled a couple months ago

3766
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:36,000
Which, unfortunately

3767
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:38,000
There's a variety of reasons why this could have happened

3768
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:40,000
It could have been because nobody in Japan

3769
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:42,000
Has an Xbox One and maybe Microsoft

3770
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:44,000
Has just decided they're not going to

3771
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:46,000
Continue to pursue the Japanese market, I don't know

3772
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:48,000
Or perhaps deadlines were not

3773
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:50,000
Being met, I don't know

3774
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,000
But, here's the interesting

3775
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:54,000
Again, these are rumors, but the interesting rabble rabble

3776
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:56,000
Going around right now is that this

3777
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:58,000
Project might not actually

3778
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:00,000
Be dead, but this is coming

3779
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:02,000
From the fact that Microsoft has renewed

3780
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:04,000
The trademark

3781
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:06,000
There are rumors in addition to that

3782
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:08,000
That are saying the teams are working

3783
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:10,000
On salvaging the project

3784
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:12,000
Possibly even

3785
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:14,000
Reworking it from the ground up

3786
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:16,000
Without Platinum being involved

3787
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:18,000
Talk about it

3788
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:20,000
Wouldn't Platinum's

3789
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:22,000
Logos still have to be on it?

3790
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:24,000
Because they kind of started the development

3791
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,000
And would own the name Scalebound?

3792
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:28,000
They wouldn't necessarily own it

3793
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:30,000
But they would be partial owners with it with Microsoft

3794
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:32,000
Right? Even though they might not end up

3795
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:34,000
Developing this game at all?

3796
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:36,000
I know, lots of rumors

3797
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:38,000
And who knows what, this could be a very

3798
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:40,000
If this shows up at E3

3799
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:42,000
This is going to be a very

3800
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:44,000
Audible gasp type of moment

3801
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:46,000
During the presser

3802
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:48,000
I was all that hot on Scalebound to begin with

3803
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:50,000
I'd be like, yeah, that's neat

3804
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:52,000
I don't think I'd be

3805
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:54,000
Audible gasp

3806
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:56,000
Well, I mean, because there's going to be

3807
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:58,000
A lot of people that are like, whoa

3808
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:00,000
Platinum totally got shafted

3809
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:02,000
In that whole deal, so

3810
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:04,000
It's not like Platinum makes

3811
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:06,000
Stinker games, like Bayonetta, Bayonetta 2

3812
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:08,000
Hello, those are like some of the best video games ever made

3813
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:10,000
Starbucks

3814
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:12,000
Oh yeah, that's right, Platinum did do that

3815
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:14,000
Well, okay, not everything's a winner

3816
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:16,000
They also did, I think it was Platinum

3817
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:18,000
They did Anarchy Reigns

3818
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:20,000
Which wasn't that great either

3819
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:22,000
Vanquish was good

3820
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:24,000
Whatever, not everybody's going to be

3821
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:26,000
Hitting everything out of the ballpark

3822
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:28,000
All the time

3823
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:30,000
After all, Rockstar did make

3824
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:32,000
Rockstar Table Tennis, but that's not necessarily

3825
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:34,000
A genre that I'm interested in

3826
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:36,000
Hi, Allen's back

3827
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:38,000
Hello, Platinum Games makes great

3828
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:40,000
Games, but they make great niche games

3829
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:42,000
That's their thing, they don't

3830
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:44,000
Really make games with mass appeal

3831
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:46,000
Which I'm sure a lot of people

3832
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:48,000
Love Platinum Games because

3833
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:50,000
They will do that good, weird shit

3834
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:52,000
But the rumor of like

3835
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:54,000
Is Platinum Games Studio going to

3836
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:56,000
Shut down because Microsoft totally

3837
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:58,000
Screwed them over with this

3838
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:00,000
Basically it's like

3839
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:02,000
Is this a sign

3840
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:04,000
That the studio is failing because

3841
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,000
They can't make a massive

3842
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:08,000
Blockbuster, but it's like that's

3843
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:10,000
Not what they do, like Bayonetta 2

3844
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:12,000
Probably one of the best action fighting

3845
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:14,000
Beat em up games ever

3846
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:16,000
But it was made on the Wii U and even then

3847
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:18,000
If any fucking Wii U game

3848
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:20,000
Needs to be re-released, it's that

3849
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:22,000
Seriously, so Platinum Games is great, but they

3850
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:24,000
Just, they don't

3851
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:26,000
Because they're always looking for

3852
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:28,000
The new weird shit

3853
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:30,000
Maybe that's one of the things

3854
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:32,000
That Microsoft didn't like about them, they take too long

3855
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:34,000
And they're like, we don't know

3856
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:36,000
What you're doing with this, this is too weird for us

3857
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:38,000
Maybe that's it

3858
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:40,000
But I'm sure Platinum Games

3859
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:42,000
Is going to be just fine, there are rumors

3860
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:44,000
Very, very, very big rumors

3861
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:46,000
Of Bayo 3

3862
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:48,000
With some things that showed up in the PC release

3863
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:50,000
And just the fact

3864
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:52,000
That Bayonetta deserves another game

3865
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:54,000
Even if the second game was on Wii U

3866
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:58,000
Nintendo may recognize that it's their own damn fault

3867
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:00,000
It didn't sell, and they may be back in the third one

3868
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:02,000
I was so happy when Bayonetta

3869
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:04,000
PC port showed up out of nowhere

3870
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:06,000
Because I thought, they have all the Devil May Cry shit

3871
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:08,000
On here, why don't they do

3872
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:10,000
Bayonetta, when it happened

3873
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:12,000
It's so awesome, but we'll never

3874
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:14,000
We will never get Bayonetta 2

3875
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:16,000
On PC because Nintendo

3876
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:18,000
Paid every penny for that game

3877
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:20,000
So hopefully they're paying for a third game

3878
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:22,000
So I don't care, I want anyway

3879
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:24,000
But yeah, I realize it's not realistic

3880
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:26,000
A true internet gamer

3881
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:28,000
I don't care if it doesn't make sense

3882
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:30,000
I want it, and I'm going to be mad if I don't get it

3883
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:34,000
Alright, moving on

3884
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:36,000
Let's go to another story

3885
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:38,000
Dark Sakura

3886
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:40,000
Well this one made my heart sing

3887
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:42,000
You?

3888
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:44,000
Me, my shriveled little heart

3889
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:46,000
Inflated three sizes

3890
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:48,000
Basically

3891
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:50,000
There is a blind gamer

3892
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:52,000
Blind gamer in Japan

3893
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:54,000
Who sent Nintendo

3894
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:56,000
Yeah, there's the gasp

3895
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:58,000
That sent Nintendo a

3896
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:00,000
A letter, not asking for

3897
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:02,000
Nintendo's been known to replace

3898
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:04,000
Broken games and things

3899
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:06,000
When customers have been incredibly sad by it

3900
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:08,000
If their circumstances

3901
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:10,000
In particular

3902
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:12,000
The dad wrote out the letter

3903
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:14,000
From his son

3904
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:16,000
And I will

3905
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:18,000
Go ahead and read the letter

3906
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:20,000
Basically, the son's name is Hibiki

3907
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:22,000
And he has retinoblastoma

3908
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:24,000
In both eyes

3909
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:26,000
So he's been blind since he was two years old

3910
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:28,000
I'll read the letter

3911
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:30,000
Dear Nintendo, hello, my name is Hibiki Sakai

3912
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:32,000
And I am in fifth grade

3913
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:34,000
I am blind, but I've always wanted

3914
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:36,000
To play video games like everybody else

3915
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:38,000
But there aren't many games

3916
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:40,000
I can play at all

3917
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:42,000
The one game I can really play is Rhythm Tengoku

3918
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:46,000
For those who don't know, that's Rhythm Heaven

3919
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:48,000
It's the only game I can enjoy

3920
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:50,000
Together with others

3921
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:52,000
And I never lose at it

3922
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:54,000
I've gotten perfect scores on all the versions

3923
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:56,000
On the Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS, Wii

3924
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:58,000
And 3DS too

3925
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:00,000
So I really, really

3926
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:02,000
Want you to make more Rhythm Tengoku games

3927
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:04,000
And it's perfectly fine if you make them

3928
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:06,000
A little harder too

3929
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:08,000
I think that there are a lot of other kids with visual impairments

3930
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:10,000
Who want to play video games but can't

3931
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:12,000
So I'd love for you to develop more games

3932
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:14,000
For people with handicaps to enjoy playing with others

3933
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:16,000
I will always support you Nintendo

3934
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:18,000
From Hibiki Sakai

3935
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:20,000
So Nintendo replied

3936
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:22,000
First of all

3937
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:24,000
With a letter in Braille

3938
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:26,000
Which I thought was pretty neat

3939
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:28,000
And then a printed one

3940
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:30,000
I guess for Dad to read

3941
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:32,000
And so the response from that is

3942
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:34,000
Thank you so much for sending us here

3943
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:36,000
At Nintendo your heartwarming letter

3944
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:38,000
We're so happy to hear that you've perfected

3945
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:40,000
And enjoyed Rhythm Tengoku, Rhythm Tengoku Gold

3946
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:42,000
Mina no Rhythm Tengoku

3947
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:44,000
And Rhythm Tengoku the best

3948
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:46,000
We have passed on your letter to Nintendo's

3949
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:48,000
Development department

3950
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:50,000
We want to keep making games that everyone can have fun playing

3951
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:52,000
So thank you for your support

3952
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:54,000
So

3953
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:56,000
Also the kid plays the drums really well too

3954
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:58,000
Did you watch the video?

3955
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:00,000
I didn't watch the video

3956
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:02,000
He plays drums pretty well

3957
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:04,000
But yeah I just thought that it was neat

3958
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:06,000
Because there was another thing on here

3959
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:08,000
Where his dad said that

3960
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:10,000
He was going under surgery

3961
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:12,000
That will quote

3962
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:14,000
Be nothing but days full of pain and tears

3963
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:18,000
So that he can

3964
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:20,000
Hopefully regain some vision

3965
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:22,000
Or have his eyes taken care of

3966
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:24,000
But it's just

3967
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:26,000
You know we have some

3968
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:28,000
Some listeners

3969
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:30,000
Who have some visual impairment

3970
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:32,000
Others who

3971
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:34,000
Have you know

3972
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:36,000
All kinds of

3973
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:38,000
I would say

3974
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:40,000
Limited abilities

3975
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:42,000
In some physical aspects

3976
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:44,000
Be it

3977
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:46,000
You know like we were talking about vision

3978
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:48,000
Hearing, mobility

3979
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:50,000
Autism, hello

3980
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:52,000
You know other things

3981
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:54,000
And I think that it's great that

3982
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:56,000
Nintendo

3983
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:58,000
Took the time to respond to that

3984
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:00,000
Letter and acknowledge that

3985
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:02,000
There are people out there who play games

3986
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:04,000
Who may not be

3987
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:06,000
Your generally abled person

3988
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:08,000
So

3989
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:10,000
I thought it was really good

3990
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:12,000
No that's awesome

3991
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:14,000
And I really super love that they replied

3992
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:16,000
With a braille letter

3993
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:18,000
Well done Nintendo, kudos

3994
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:20,000
And also I

3995
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:22,000
Probably not going to hear this but I do hope

3996
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:24,000
Hibiki's surgery goes well

3997
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:26,000
Same

3998
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:28,000
Alright thank you for sharing that nice story DarkSarka

3999
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:30,000
Appreciate it

4000
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:32,000
Alright we just have a couple more stories for you guys

4001
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:34,000
So speaking of more VR stuff

4002
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:36,000
This is pretty cool

4003
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:38,000
So a

4004
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:40,000
I guess a

4005
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:42,000
Half Life 2 mod

4006
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:44,000
Or a Half Life 2

4007
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:46,000
VR mod

4008
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:48,000
For the Oculus Rift and Vive

4009
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:50,000
Has been in the works since 2013

4010
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:52,000
It just made its way through

4011
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:54,000
Steam Greenlight

4012
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:56,000
So hopefully that means

4013
02:37:56,000 --> 02:37:58,000
It will be coming out relatively soon

4014
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:00,000
So having the project on Steam

4015
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:02,000
Of course will make it easier for them to develop

4016
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:06,000
So they're allowed to do this even though Half Life

4017
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:08,000
Isn't really their game

4018
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:10,000
I think so yeah, there's been other mods that have gotten

4019
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:12,000
Like Gary's mod is out there right

4020
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:14,000
Well Gary's mod, there's also

4021
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:16,000
Some Portal side story

4022
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:18,000
Stuff that they had that they released

4023
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:20,000
Granted those were free, I'm not sure if this

4024
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:22,000
Is going to cost anything when it comes out

4025
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:24,000
Maybe not, maybe it might be

4026
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:26,000
A free thing, so I don't know

4027
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:28,000
If you have

4028
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:30,000
Half Life or something like that

4029
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:32,000
Or a Valve game that you'll be able to play this

4030
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:34,000
Alright

4031
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:36,000
Well, unfortunately

4032
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:38,000
Ending on a not so great

4033
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:40,000
Note tonight, but I just want to take a minute to let

4034
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:42,000
You all know, if you didn't know

4035
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:44,000
That I guess this was on May 13th

4036
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:46,000
That this actually happened, but

4037
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:48,000
American voice actor John

4038
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:50,000
Sigan, I don't know if I said that right, I'm really sorry

4039
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:52,000
If I mispronounced that, but he passed away

4040
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:54,000
And he was more

4041
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:56,000
Probably known to you guys as an actor

4042
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:58,000
In the Metal Gear series

4043
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:00,000
He was Solidius Snake

4044
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:02,000
In Metal Gear Solid 2

4045
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:04,000
Sons of Liberty, but he was also in

4046
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:06,000
Some other TV productions and so forth

4047
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:08,000
And he did Mafia 3, he was in that game

4048
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:10,000
As well, so

4049
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:12,000
Unfortunately

4050
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:14,000
We lost him this week, so rest in peace

4051
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:16,000
Alright, we're going to

4052
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:18,000
Move on to the Skype line

4053
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:20,000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word

4054
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:22,000
On Skype is the place you can call us

4055
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:24,000
And we'll

4056
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:26,000
Take your calls, Orange Lounge Radio again

4057
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:28,000
All one word on Skype

4058
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:30,000
It is already lighting up in here

4059
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:32,000
Let's get to some calls and take some calls

4060
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:34,000
Oh my god

4061
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:36,000
Hi Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

4062
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:38,000
Hey Zaku, long time

4063
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:40,000
I know, I know, the struggle

4064
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:42,000
Was kind of real, but it was only

4065
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:44,000
Because I finally

4066
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:46,000
Let's say, switched careers

4067
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:48,000
Well not so much switched careers, but switched jobs

4068
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:50,000
New phone, who dis?

4069
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:52,000
Yeah

4070
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:54,000
I'm starting a new job tomorrow

4071
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:56,000
So as a result, yeah

4072
02:39:56,000 --> 02:39:58,000
I had to stay away from things like OLR for a bit

4073
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:00,000
Although you did see me in December

4074
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:02,000
When I was out on the West Coast

4075
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:04,000
Briefly

4076
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:06,000
Well what's on your mind tonight?

4077
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:08,000
Nothing much, other than the fact that

4078
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:10,000
Things like E3 is looming

4079
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:12,000
And the fact that I got

4080
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:14,000
Well, another one that I caught was like

4081
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:16,000
The fact that free to play

4082
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:18,000
Doesn't necessarily mean

4083
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:20,000
You know

4084
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:22,000
It doesn't necessarily mean

4085
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:24,000
That everyone's on the same page

4086
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:26,000
Case in point, I don't know

4087
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:28,000
If you read this article recently

4088
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:30,000
Where one YouTube streamer

4089
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:32,000
Basically got

4090
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:34,000
Threatened with a

4091
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:36,000
Strike on their account because

4092
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:38,000
Wargaming, the folks who make World of Tanks

4093
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:40,000
Didn't like the fact that they were

4094
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:42,000
That he was basically bashing

4095
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:44,000
Their

4096
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:46,000
New tank that essentially

4097
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:48,000
Played a win-grab

4098
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:50,000
That's designed to maximize

4099
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:52,000
The amount of profit

4100
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:54,000
You know, for these freemium games

4101
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:56,000
I really fucking hate

4102
02:40:56,000 --> 02:40:58,000
When copyright holders, and this is a problem

4103
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:00,000
I put this squarely on YouTube

4104
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:02,000
Honestly, for having this system set up in the first place

4105
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:04,000
But I hate when copyright holders

4106
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:06,000
Kind of abuse that to

4107
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:08,000
Try to strike down, you know, things that are

4108
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:10,000
Critical, and that's what it is

4109
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:12,000
It's a criticism, and it's not like

4110
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:14,000
Unfounded criticism either

4111
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:16,000
It's, you know, like you say

4112
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:18,000
Potentially a play to win type of situation

4113
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:20,000
And people have a right to kind of know about that

4114
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:22,000
Just like, you know, when Siskel

4115
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:24,000
And Ebert use a clip from a movie

4116
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:26,000
To drive home the point that this movie might be kind of

4117
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:28,000
Fucking terrible, then

4118
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:30,000
Obviously I'm dating myself using that reference

4119
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:32,000
But you know what I mean, those names live on

4120
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:34,000
And mean any movie reviewers

4121
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:36,000
That are out there, they use a clip

4122
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:38,000
And they might be critical of it

4123
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:40,000
The movie people aren't like, well we're

4124
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:42,000
Gonna fucking sue your show, and

4125
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:44,000
You're never going to be able to review our movie again

4126
02:41:44,000 --> 02:41:46,000
I'm sure somebody's tried that, but it doesn't

4127
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:48,000
Fucking work, because, you know,

4128
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:50,000
We have, that's why we have fair use laws

4129
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:52,000
To be able to comment on that stuff

4130
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:54,000
But on the other hand, to be fair

4131
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:56,000
This one, he was part

4132
02:41:56,000 --> 02:41:58,000
Of a particular program

4133
02:41:58,000 --> 02:42:00,000
That gives said people

4134
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:02,000
Insider access to upcoming

4135
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:04,000
DLC

4136
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:06,000
If they want to kick him out of the program, fine

4137
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:08,000
But he has every right to say, I got

4138
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:10,000
Kicked out of the program because I

4139
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:12,000
Went against the grain, and I wouldn't

4140
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:15,000
True, but at the same token

4141
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:17,000
The reason why they're after him in particular

4142
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:19,000
Is because of the fact that he actually

4143
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:21,000
Cursed him out in a YouTube video

4144
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:23,000
Like he cursed out Wargaming

4145
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:25,000
He essentially

4146
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:27,000
He essentially bit the hand that

4147
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:28,000
Fed him

4148
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:30,000
Well, now when we're getting into the level

4149
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:32,000
Now when we're talking about unprofessionalism

4150
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:33,000
Yeah

4151
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:35,000
Now, okay, now my opinion starts to sway

4152
02:42:35,000 --> 02:42:37,000
A little bit, is that okay, well

4153
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:39,000
If you're unprofessional, then yes, you were gonna

4154
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:41,000
Get kicked out of the club. However

4155
02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:43,000
I would still say he has

4156
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:45,000
A right to be critical, but you

4157
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:47,000
Have to expect that if you're unprofessional

4158
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:49,000
In the way that you do it, you're gonna get kicked

4159
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:51,000
Out of the special club, and you're not gonna be able to

4160
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:52,000
Get some of those perks

4161
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:54,000
But they also copyright strike his videos too

4162
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:56,000
Did they end up doing that?

4163
02:42:56,000 --> 02:42:58,000
See, that's a low blow in my opinion

4164
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:00,000
Yeah, they did that

4165
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:02,000
Just because of the fact that

4166
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:04,000
Even though, yes, you have a right to criticize

4167
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:06,000
You know, under copyright law

4168
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:08,000
You have the right to criticize something

4169
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:10,000
Something copyrighted, but whether or not

4170
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:12,000
Like he's violating any

4171
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:14,000
Any NDA or any type of

4172
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:16,000
Agreement that he signed as part of joining

4173
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:18,000
The contributors program, that's probably where they're

4174
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:20,000
They're trying to

4175
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:22,000
Protect that copyright, in addition to

4176
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:24,000
Also protecting their brand by not

4177
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:26,000
By trying to essentially

4178
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:28,000
Not associate their brand

4179
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:30,000
With someone who essentially

4180
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:32,000
You know, uses F-bombs to

4181
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:34,000
You know, to make their point about

4182
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:36,000
Something, to vent their frustration

4183
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:38,000
But not do it in a very professional manner

4184
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:40,000
And they don't

4185
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:42,000
But they don't owe him a goddamn thing

4186
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:44,000
And that's important too

4187
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:46,000
And I say that to anybody

4188
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:48,000
That's trying to get into this medium

4189
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:50,000
The YouTubes, the Twitches, the podcasting

4190
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:52,000
And all this stuff, and this is one lesson

4191
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:54,000
We've learned over the past 15 years

4192
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:56,000
Not that I ever think we were guilty of committing it

4193
02:43:56,000 --> 02:43:58,000
But one thing, you know, I gotta let you all know

4194
02:43:58,000 --> 02:44:00,000
Is, you know, nobody

4195
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:02,000
Owes you a goddamn thing

4196
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:04,000
You're gonna have to work for it, you know

4197
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:06,000
And that's what it boils

4198
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:08,000
Down to at the end of the day, when it comes to

4199
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:10,000
Viewers, when it comes to

4200
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:12,000
Free products, when it comes to

4201
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:14,000
Getting into E3 and all this stuff

4202
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:16,000
Nobody fucking owes you shit

4203
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:18,000
And you're gonna have to really work and prove

4204
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:20,000
And that's

4205
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:22,000
Where people sometimes get into a tricky

4206
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:24,000
Tricky area, because some people

4207
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:26,000
Are like, I wanna be in the circle

4208
02:44:26,000 --> 02:44:28,000
I wanna be somebody that's gonna be

4209
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:30,000
Recognized, so I'm gonna be a mouthpiece

4210
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:32,000
For these organizations and I'm gonna

4211
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:34,000
Say everything that they wanna hear

4212
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:36,000
Because I wanna be accepted, I wanna be loved

4213
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:38,000
And I wanna go to all these parties

4214
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:40,000
But then you're kind of, you know

4215
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:42,000
Losing, so it's like

4216
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:44,000
It's a really tricky

4217
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:46,000
Balance you have to do

4218
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:48,000
Where it's like, you can be nice

4219
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:50,000
To your, and you can be

4220
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:52,000
Professional, this is where this guy went wrong

4221
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:54,000
As he was unprofessional, you can be nice

4222
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:56,000
You can be professional to all that, to these companies

4223
02:44:56,000 --> 02:44:58,000
But at the same time, you kinda owe it to your

4224
02:44:58,000 --> 02:45:00,000
You owe it to your audience

4225
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:02,000
To be honest

4226
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:04,000
Yeah, and unfortunately

4227
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:06,000
He basically, the way he went about it

4228
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:08,000
He had, I mean

4229
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:10,000
His criticisms were very

4230
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:12,000
Fair, I have to give him that

4231
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:14,000
But the way he went about it

4232
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:16,000
And the fact that he threw his

4233
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:18,000
You know, he threw Wargaming

4234
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:20,000
Under the bus, especially if they provided

4235
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:22,000
Him with something that wasn't even out yet

4236
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:24,000
This was like upcoming

4237
02:45:24,000 --> 02:45:26,000
Like this DLC was essentially

4238
02:45:26,000 --> 02:45:28,000
You know, not even released to the public

4239
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:30,000
And that's probably why they're going after him

4240
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:32,000
Well, okay, now

4241
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:34,000
Okay, now, see, now the

4242
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:36,000
But why give it to him then? Why give it to him

4243
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:38,000
If they didn't want him talking about it?

4244
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:40,000
Well, but here's the, if the DLC wasn't

4245
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:42,000
Released yet, and he put that on

4246
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:44,000
YouTube

4247
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:46,000
But now we're in slippery slope

4248
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:48,000
But they wouldn't have done that

4249
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:50,000
If he talked favorably about it

4250
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:52,000
Yeah, I still

4251
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:54,000
Think it's a dick move

4252
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:56,000
On Wargaming's part, and this is a bigger

4253
02:45:56,000 --> 02:45:58,000
Issue, for that part

4254
02:45:58,000 --> 02:46:00,000
But really, this guy should have just been

4255
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:02,000
Professional to begin with

4256
02:46:02,000 --> 02:46:04,000
I think the copyright strike is a bit far

4257
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:06,000
But this is, at the end of the day, this is all

4258
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:08,000
Fucking YouTube's problem

4259
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:10,000
This is a YouTube culture that YouTube's created

4260
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:12,000
And YouTube's bots have created this problem

4261
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:14,000
And YouTube refuses to fucking fix it

4262
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:16,000
Right, and I mean

4263
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:18,000
Like, I guess what he

4264
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:20,000
I guess where Wargaming draws the line

4265
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:22,000
Is that, you know, they're saying

4266
02:46:22,000 --> 02:46:24,000
Quote, you know, there's a level of toxicity

4267
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:26,000
Under offensive language that is

4268
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:28,000
Unacceptable, even though they're more than

4269
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:30,000
Willing to give members of their community

4270
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:32,000
Second chances, but things like

4271
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:34,000
The fact that, you know, he's more than

4272
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:36,000
Welcome to make those types of Wargaming-related

4273
02:46:36,000 --> 02:46:38,000
Videos, but, you know, they're really

4274
02:46:38,000 --> 02:46:40,000
Drawing the line about things like hate

4275
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:42,000
Speech, homophobic slurs

4276
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:44,000
Things like that, and the fact that he

4277
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:46,000
Were, you know, cur-

4278
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:48,000
Oh, I see, they were trying to curb their extremely

4279
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:50,000
Profane language of a member

4280
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:52,000
Of our contributor program

4281
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:54,000
So, okay, so he used

4282
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:56,000
Like, homophobic, so he used trash language

4283
02:46:56,000 --> 02:46:58,000
Basically

4284
02:46:58,000 --> 02:47:00,000
Okay, do you

4285
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:02,000
Here's, this is important, do you know who uses

4286
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:04,000
Trash language? Trash people

4287
02:47:04,000 --> 02:47:06,000
Okay, so

4288
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:08,000
Look, here's the thing

4289
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:10,000
He has a right to say all that shit

4290
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:12,000
Fine, whatever, but I have a right

4291
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:14,000
To fucking block his channel

4292
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:16,000
And I'm not gonna be fucking watching it anytime soon

4293
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:18,000
At the end of the day, though, I would say

4294
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:20,000
In light of all that, I would still say

4295
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:22,000
It's a little bit of an

4296
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:24,000
Overreach on their

4297
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:26,000
Part, but I do understand

4298
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:28,000
It's DLC that's not out yet, so it's

4299
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:30,000
Kinda like one of those, this

4300
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:32,000
Gets into very slippery slopes, but this

4301
02:47:32,000 --> 02:47:34,000
Is for YouTube to work out

4302
02:47:34,000 --> 02:47:36,000
With a real fucking human being

4303
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:38,000
That YouTube probably doesn't have staffed

4304
02:47:38,000 --> 02:47:40,000
Anyway, Zaku

4305
02:47:40,000 --> 02:47:42,000
Zaku, I gotta wrap up and let you go so we can get to other calls

4306
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:44,000
But thank you, thank you

4307
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:46,000
For that onion of a story, it was like every time we

4308
02:47:46,000 --> 02:47:48,000
Peeled back, there was another fucking lair

4309
02:47:48,000 --> 02:47:50,000
Alright, as the world turns

4310
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:52,000
Alright, take care, Zaku

4311
02:47:52,000 --> 02:47:54,000
Bye, alright

4312
02:47:54,000 --> 02:47:56,000
It was good to hear from him, it's been a very long time since we've heard from Zaku

4313
02:47:56,000 --> 02:47:58,000
Let's see if there's any last minute stories

4314
02:47:58,000 --> 02:48:00,000
Real quick, and we'll probably wrap up soon

4315
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:02,000
But I will take another shot for calls here

4316
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:04,000
OrangeLawnsRadio on Skype

4317
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:22,000
So they're not sure where that leaked from

4318
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:24,000
But it doesn't have any subtitles or anything like that

4319
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:26,000
It's all in Japanese, but

4320
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:28,000
Check it out, if you're interested

4321
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:30,000
Okay

4322
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:32,000
I got one

4323
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:34,000
Did you see, they've announced a

4324
02:48:34,000 --> 02:48:36,000
Switch package for Splatoon 2 that's in

4325
02:48:36,000 --> 02:48:38,000
Japan and Europe with different colored Joy-Cons

4326
02:48:38,000 --> 02:48:40,000
Oh yeah, because it was

4327
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:42,000
All part of that, did they mention the

4328
02:48:42,000 --> 02:48:44,000
Arms director, I know there was the trailer

4329
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:46,000
It was mentioned in something

4330
02:48:46,000 --> 02:48:48,000
But yes, I did see the additional colors

4331
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:50,000
And I am really wanting that

4332
02:48:50,000 --> 02:48:52,000
And it hasn't been announced for North America

4333
02:48:52,000 --> 02:48:54,000
And I'm a little upset about that

4334
02:48:54,000 --> 02:48:56,000
Well, it's a good thing the Switch is region free, right?

4335
02:48:56,000 --> 02:48:58,000
Yeah, so that I can import a Switch's Joy-Cons

4336
02:48:58,000 --> 02:49:00,000
Yeah, it would be expensive

4337
02:49:00,000 --> 02:49:02,000
It's an expensive hobby

4338
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:04,000
I just hope they announce it here

4339
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:06,000
They probably, E3 is coming right around the corner, they might

4340
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:08,000
But at the same time, it's like, oh god

4341
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:10,000
I don't want to get into the territory of buying

4342
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:12,000
$40 controllers just because they're in different colors

4343
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:14,000
That's Shane's department, that's not something I want to do

4344
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:16,000
That's why I'm waiting until they're in different colors

4345
02:49:16,000 --> 02:49:18,000
So they're $80

4346
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:20,000
A set of two

4347
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:22,000
So they're $40 each

4348
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:24,000
Oh my god, no

4349
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:26,000
And you thought the pro controller was bad at 70

4350
02:49:26,000 --> 02:49:28,000
No!

4351
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:30,000
That HD rumble got paid that Nintendo price

4352
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:32,000
I like the all grey

4353
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:34,000
It matches

4354
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:36,000
Look, I will admit when I saw the yellow ones

4355
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:38,000
That they're doing for Arms, I was like, ooh those are pretty

4356
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:40,000
But $80, nope

4357
02:49:40,000 --> 02:49:42,000
That just shut that off

4358
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:44,000
That's fine

4359
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:46,000
They're struggling color joy cons with specific games

4360
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:48,000
Since they've announced that

4361
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:50,000
Arms is the yellow, Splatoon is the green

4362
02:49:50,000 --> 02:49:52,000
And Fuchsia, what if they do that?

4363
02:49:54,000 --> 02:49:56,000
Well, do you remember those early rumors

4364
02:49:56,000 --> 02:49:58,000
About the Switch that there may actually be

4365
02:49:58,000 --> 02:50:00,000
Different types of joy cons

4366
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:02,000
That go in the Switch

4367
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:04,000
Do you remember some of those early rumors that there might be a GameCube controller

4368
02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:06,000
That they'll use for Smash Brothers?

4369
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:08,000
That would be fucking interesting

4370
02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:10,000
Having played with the pro controller for a couple months now

4371
02:50:10,000 --> 02:50:12,000
I don't feel like I need

4372
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:14,000
The GameCube controller for Smash

4373
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:16,000
I know that

4374
02:50:16,000 --> 02:50:18,000
The Melee community is still going strong

4375
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:20,000
There are going to be people who are going to stick to it

4376
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:22,000
But I think for the majority of gamers

4377
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:24,000
It's not like on the Wii

4378
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:26,000
Where the classic controller

4379
02:50:26,000 --> 02:50:28,000
Didn't really feel the same

4380
02:50:28,000 --> 02:50:30,000
I think the pro controller can hold up

4381
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:32,000
Alright, well you know what is getting kind of late

4382
02:50:32,000 --> 02:50:34,000
I'm sorry to those guys who didn't get through on our Skype line

4383
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:36,000
But we're going to shut it down for the night

4384
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:38,000
Just so we can wrap up

4385
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:40,000
Because it's a little bit after 9 o'clock here

4386
02:50:40,000 --> 02:50:42,000
Thank you guys for listening to the show tonight

4387
02:50:42,000 --> 02:50:44,000
I want to thank you guys as always for tuning into

And of course, tell a friend about the show

4394
02:50:56,000 --> 02:50:58,000
This is all about word of mouth

4395
02:50:58,000 --> 02:51:00,000
We don't have a YouTube series

4396
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:02,000
Or anything like that to promote the show

4397
02:51:02,000 --> 02:51:04,000
We do have a Twitch affiliate channel now

4398
02:51:04,000 --> 02:51:06,000
We're getting there, we're moving on up

4399
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:08,000
Look out John's Arcade, I'm coming for your subs

4400
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:10,000
Just kidding, alright

4401
02:51:10,000 --> 02:51:12,000
No, in all seriousness, indie stuff

4402
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:14,000
No matter where it is

4403
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:16,000
Really grows thanks to you guys

4404
02:51:16,000 --> 02:51:18,000
So, JD

4405
02:51:18,000 --> 02:51:20,000
Thanks for being here again tonight

4406
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:22,000
Appreciate it, always nice to have you here

4407
02:51:22,000 --> 02:51:24,000
Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

4408
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:26,000
All hail Orb

4409
02:51:26,000 --> 02:51:28,000
Alright, there you go

4410
02:51:28,000 --> 02:51:30,000
We'll move around the room here

4411
02:51:30,000 --> 02:51:32,000
Dark Soccer, do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

4412
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:34,000
I want someone to buy me this camera

4413
02:51:34,000 --> 02:51:36,000
It's a Holga digital camera

4414
02:51:36,000 --> 02:51:38,000
It's like 40 bucks

4415
02:51:38,000 --> 02:51:40,000
Well, you need to start doing some streaming

4416
02:51:40,000 --> 02:51:42,000
And then when you get your biddies, you can buy the camera

4417
02:51:42,000 --> 02:51:44,000
I actually was planning on picking back up

4418
02:51:44,000 --> 02:51:46,000
On the Hot to Full Boyfriend stream

4419
02:51:46,000 --> 02:51:48,000
There you go

4420
02:51:48,000 --> 02:51:50,000
Cause I've got Holiday Star and the other ones

4421
02:51:50,000 --> 02:51:52,000
So, let me know on my Twitters

4422
02:51:52,000 --> 02:51:54,000
Aha, this will make me use my Twitter

4423
02:51:54,000 --> 02:51:56,000
You're gonna use Twitter?

4424
02:51:56,000 --> 02:51:58,000
I'm gonna use Twitter

4425
02:51:58,000 --> 02:52:00,000
You're gonna use my Twatter

4426
02:52:00,000 --> 02:52:02,000
Let me know if you want me to play more Hot to Full Boyfriend

4427
02:52:02,000 --> 02:52:04,000
I want you to play more Hot to Full Boyfriend

4428
02:52:04,000 --> 02:52:06,000
Yay, pigeon dating

4429
02:52:06,000 --> 02:52:08,000
My final thought is

4430
02:52:08,000 --> 02:52:10,000
Obviously I have to say something about

4431
02:52:10,000 --> 02:52:12,000
That my mom

4432
02:52:12,000 --> 02:52:14,000
Has not been doing too well this past week

4433
02:52:14,000 --> 02:52:16,000
And those of you that follow me on Twitter kinda know about that

4434
02:52:16,000 --> 02:52:18,000
And I just appreciate kinda having this show

4435
02:52:18,000 --> 02:52:20,000
As something to take my mind off it

4436
02:52:20,000 --> 02:52:22,000
For a little while, so thank you guys all for being here

4437
02:52:22,000 --> 02:52:24,000
I really, really appreciate it

4438
02:52:24,000 --> 02:52:26,000
And if you didn't see my latest tweet

4439
02:52:26,000 --> 02:52:28,000
I made about an hour ago, I did get a text from my sister

4440
02:52:28,000 --> 02:52:30,000
My mom is doing better

4441
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:32,000
Things are hopefully improving

4442
02:52:32,000 --> 02:52:34,000
In that department, so thank you guys very much

4443
02:52:34,000 --> 02:52:36,000
Last but not least, Loki, your final thought?

4444
02:52:36,000 --> 02:52:38,000
So, one thing about this

4445
02:52:38,000 --> 02:52:40,000
You know, office space idle clicker game

4446
02:52:40,000 --> 02:52:42,000
Is they have this little event stuff that they do

4447
02:52:42,000 --> 02:52:44,000
Where you earn like these in-game currency type things

4448
02:52:44,000 --> 02:52:46,000
But

4449
02:52:46,000 --> 02:52:48,000
The in-game currency, each one of them gives you

4450
02:52:48,000 --> 02:52:50,000
A 10% bonus, but the bonuses

4451
02:52:50,000 --> 02:52:52,000
That you can also buy with that currency

4452
02:52:52,000 --> 02:52:54,000
Are actually less than if you just didn't spend them

4453
02:52:54,000 --> 02:52:56,000
Which doesn't make any goddamn sense

4454
02:52:56,000 --> 02:52:58,000
So who the fuck programmed this shit because they're a fucking idiot

4455
02:52:58,000 --> 02:53:00,000
That's all I have to say about that

4456
02:53:00,000 --> 02:53:02,000
It's a good thing Loki didn't have a YouTube channel

4457
02:53:02,000 --> 02:53:04,000
Alright

4458
02:53:04,000 --> 02:53:06,000
I do, I just don't post anything on it

4459
02:53:06,000 --> 02:53:08,000
There's a reason, alright, no I'm kidding

4460
02:53:08,000 --> 02:53:10,000
That's gonna do it guys, we will be back in 7 days

4461
02:53:10,000 --> 02:53:12,000
Yes, Memorial Day weekend, we will still be here

4462
02:53:12,000 --> 02:53:14,000
Nobody's going out of town, right?

4463
02:53:14,000 --> 02:53:16,000
I got Memorial Day off

4464
02:53:16,000 --> 02:53:18,000
Congrats!

4465
02:53:18,000 --> 02:53:20,000
You know what this means?

4466
02:53:20,000 --> 02:53:22,000
Vodka!

4467
02:53:22,000 --> 02:53:24,000
V-O-D-C-A-H

4468
02:53:24,000 --> 02:53:26,000
Responsible drinking

4469
02:53:26,000 --> 02:53:28,000
On next week's show

4470
02:53:28,000 --> 02:53:30,000
I still have

4471
02:53:30,000 --> 02:53:32,000
I still have like half the bottle of Stroopwafel

4472
02:53:32,000 --> 02:53:34,000
I was just about to ask

4473
02:53:34,000 --> 02:53:36,000
But I've been known to drink a drink or two

4474
02:53:36,000 --> 02:53:38,000
Alright, that's it, we're done

4475
02:53:38,000 --> 02:53:40,000
We're out of here, have a great night everybody

4476
02:53:40,000 --> 02:53:42,000
We will see you in 7 days, we may or may not

4477
02:53:42,000 --> 02:53:44,000
Be sober

4478
02:53:44,000 --> 02:53:46,000
But if you're operating a vehicle, you damn well better be sober

4479
02:53:46,000 --> 02:53:48,000
Goodnight everybody

4480
02:53:48,000 --> 02:53:50,000
