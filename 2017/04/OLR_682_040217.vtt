00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:15.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki!

00:15.000 --> 00:27.000
Tonight we talk indie gaming with our friends from the Sacramento IGBA as well as discuss big moves in the gaming industry this week as you all gear up for Persona 5 on another week with a show where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:37.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.000 --> 00:47.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with our 682nd episode for this April the 2nd of 2017 and that's no joke.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
My name is Rob Roberts here with you in studio as always.

00:50.000 --> 00:56.000
Look, April Fools was yesterday. I am playing with y'all today. We got too big a show tonight to be doing any jokes.

00:56.000 --> 01:00.000
If only people were as cautious every day as they are on April Fools Day.

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
Hello Calamity Jamie. Welcome to the show. Remember that's my new favorite name for you.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
God.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
DarkSakura or Jamie Summers or Calamity Jamie. How are you?

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Ugh.

01:10.000 --> 01:17.000
It makes me think. It's not only just the Ganon thing but I also think of like Calamity Jane like the Wild West sort of thing.

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
Like she's an outlaw who don't give a fuck. Like that whole type of thing. So I think it's fitting.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
And you need cowboy boots.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
No.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
Alright. How are you though otherwise?

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
I haven't owned a pair of cowboy boots since I was 10.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
Are you feeling better?

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
I am but it might be drugs. No I'm serious.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Legal. Legal. Legal. Prescribed.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
Drugs are bad.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
Hi Gabe.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
No they're good drugs.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
We'll get to you in a minute.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
I'm on good drugs.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
He can't help himself.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
I got a shot in the hip of Toradol.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
What is that?

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
It's like ibuprofen but liquid and it lasts for a couple of days.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
So it's kind of nice just not hurting for a little while.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
But I also don't know if I passed the kidney stone or not.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
I would think it would be pretty obvious.

01:57.000 --> 02:02.000
I think it would be obvious and I still have the other non-painful symptoms so whatever.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
Alright well hopefully you are.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
It's like I can't get a break.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
Hopefully this all passes quickly.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
Cause I'm still on round. Oh jeez Rob.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
That was a pun.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
No more cookies for you.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
Alright.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
I'm gonna take this peeps back.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
Not here tonight.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
Tech master Loki.

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
There was a medical issue in Loki's family just a couple hours ago.

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
I'm told that it's not like I'm probably making it sound way more serious than it is.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
But they just you know he had to go take care of business.

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
He's actually watching the kids right now cause Nellie had to go take care of the other business.

02:31.000 --> 02:35.000
So just thoughts with everybody that everything's going okay.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
But we do have to be a little more impromptu tonight.

02:37.000 --> 02:41.000
Cause we actually we have our whole little show thing ready for Loki to be here.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
And unfortunately he couldn't be here obviously for those obvious reasons.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
So people need.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
What is the curse of Orange Launch Radio this year?

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
Jesus do you guys.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
I don't know if you know this.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
My mom had surgery this week.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
She had a knee replacement surgery on Wednesday.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
How's she recovering?

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
She's fine.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
I just went and saw her today.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
So she's good.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
But she was asking.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
I don't know why she asked me about this.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
She was asking about Richard Simmons.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
Because Richard Simmons.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
There was an article about.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
Yeah it's in People right.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
And so my mom.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
That's the person that's still subscribing to People Magazine is my mom.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
So she was asking about the podcast.

03:15.000 --> 03:20.000
So I actually got out her iPad mini and I subscribed to missing Richard Simmons.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
On her iPad.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
By the way I want to point something else out.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
My mother was not subscribed to Orange Launch Radio.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
So you know I subscribed her to that too.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
Even though I don't know if she should be hearing this but.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
Hi Rob's mom.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
Hi.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
Hope you're feeling better.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
I still think we should call my mom sometime.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
We should.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
We have before.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
It's been years.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
Yeah.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Once.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
And then she said told the story about condensation.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
Oh my God.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
All right.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
Do you remember what episode number that was?

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
Because.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
I don't remember what episode number this one is.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
682.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
682.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
OK.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
Whatever.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
All right.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
Anyway.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
So not here tonight.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
Techmaster Loki.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
We'll see him in a couple of weeks.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
We're actually not going to be here live next week.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
Because we're going to be very busy on Saturday.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
And that's thanks to our special in-studio guests.

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
I want to welcome back to the show some old friends now of Orange Launch Radio.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
They've been here enough times that we can call them old friends.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
Friends of the show.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
Duh.

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
Say hello to Gabe from Sacramento IGDA.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Ladies first.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
Oh and his partner in business crime.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
Bree.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
Hi.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
Hi.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Except everything is legal.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
There's no actual crimes being committed.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
Just to be clear.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Allegedly.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
That we know of.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
That we know of.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
All right.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
And crickets enter the room.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
All right.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
So.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
Sacramento IGDA.

04:39.000 --> 04:43.000
You guys are putting on this big event in West Sacramento.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
This coming Saturday.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
Give us the elevator pitch.

04:47.000 --> 04:51.000
The 60 second pitch that I'm sure you've had to give 5,000 times this week.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
Mister, my dad said he saw you on Good Day Sacramento.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
And all this stuff.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
By the way.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
That was another thing.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
Oh I saw some guy on Good Day Sacramento.

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
I don't remember his name but he was talking about this indie game thing.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
If it was a guy it was Gabe.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
If it was a gal it was Bree.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
It was one of them.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
So.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
Give us the 60 second pitch you've been giving all over the town.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
Oh.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
There's no.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
There's never consistency with my message.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
It's just.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
It comes down to one thing.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
This is our fourth annual event.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
And it is.

05:20.000 --> 05:25.000
Sac and the Arcade is a celebration of independent game development here in Sacramento.

05:25.000 --> 05:29.000
And really spreading wildly throughout the region, the valley.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
And beyond that.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
And it is.

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
The core purpose of the second arcade is essentially.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
You're gonna play.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
You're gonna learn.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
And you're gonna be inspired.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
By what you.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
You know from both playing and learning.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
The idea here is that we don't have a job market here.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
We didn't have a job market for game development period.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
EA is here.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
We don't know what they're doing.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
And they're not making an impact at all within our community.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
And that's fine.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
It's all secrets.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
Of course.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
It's all secrets.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
It's one brick wall with windows and they're outside an alleged pizzeria.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
Next door to the gay bar.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
Right.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
True story.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
True story.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
Yeah.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
Right next door to faces.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
Next door to faces.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
So that's convenient.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
We camped out right by that building.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
I didn't even realize it was their building until I went back to my car when I was there

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
for the Sacramento Rainbow Festival.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
I thought we tried to take pictures with the shepherd that was in the window at one point.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
They used to have a commander shepherd cut out.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
Was that you?

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
Maybe it was Shane.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
That wasn't me.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
It might have been Shane.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
Oh, cause I look so much like Shane.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
You Mass Effect fanboys are all the same.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
Yeah.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
Mass Effect.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
Anyway.

06:30.000 --> 06:34.680
So the idea is that, and of course with due respect to EA, thank you for Unravel.

06:34.680 --> 06:35.680
We appreciate it.

06:35.680 --> 06:36.680
But we still don't.

06:36.680 --> 06:37.680
Well thank you for being in Sacramento.

06:37.680 --> 06:38.680
Yeah.

06:38.680 --> 06:39.680
Thank you for being in Sacramento.

06:39.680 --> 06:42.000
Even if y'all are bunkered in there and we don't know what y'all are doing.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
Yeah.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
Yeah.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
Seriously.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.320
But either way, you probably have to pay DLC to go in the front door.

06:46.320 --> 06:48.320
So but I digress.

06:48.320 --> 06:50.320
Anyway so.

06:50.320 --> 06:51.320
Don't burn your bridges yet.

06:51.320 --> 06:52.320
Where's the shade sound Rob?

06:52.320 --> 06:54.320
Oh, where's my shade button?

06:55.320 --> 06:56.320
I'm so sorry.

06:56.320 --> 06:57.320
I'm so sorry.

06:57.320 --> 06:58.320
No.

06:58.320 --> 06:59.320
But seriously.

06:59.320 --> 07:00.320
I didn't think I'd need it with Gabe here.

07:00.320 --> 07:01.320
No.

07:01.320 --> 07:02.320
No.

07:02.320 --> 07:03.320
I'm so sorry.

07:03.320 --> 07:04.320
Now I mean all half jokes aside.

07:04.320 --> 07:10.840
The idea here is that we're creating, we've created, we're nurturing and strengthening

07:10.840 --> 07:17.040
and empowering this community to feel like that their dream can come true.

07:17.040 --> 07:19.440
Their idea can become something more.

07:19.440 --> 07:24.120
And it's gonna get played by your local neighbor.

07:24.120 --> 07:25.320
And then some.

07:25.320 --> 07:29.880
And we, you know, again, we're approaching the fourth year of it and it has been incredible.

07:29.880 --> 07:36.040
I'm already more nervous than excited about the turnout for this this weekend because

07:36.040 --> 07:38.640
I've already seen numbers and oh my God.

07:38.640 --> 07:40.060
So yeah, it's.

07:40.060 --> 07:41.060
But that's the good.

07:41.060 --> 07:42.060
No, no.

07:42.060 --> 07:43.060
It's great.

07:43.060 --> 07:44.060
How are these people going to fucking fit?

07:44.060 --> 07:45.060
Yeah.

07:45.060 --> 07:46.060
Yeah.

07:46.060 --> 07:47.060
That's yeah.

07:47.060 --> 07:48.060
Yeah.

07:48.060 --> 07:49.060
Pretty.

07:49.060 --> 07:50.060
Yeah.

07:50.060 --> 07:51.060
Pretty much so.

07:51.060 --> 07:52.060
Yeah.

07:52.060 --> 07:53.060
But that but that's what we're here for.

07:53.060 --> 07:54.060
You know.

07:54.100 --> 07:57.940
And every time we're going to have the there's going to be a cafe in the venue so you'd be

07:57.940 --> 07:58.940
able to buy stuff.

07:58.940 --> 08:00.940
Oh, I just met I just met with the food charge.

08:00.940 --> 08:01.940
You get people outside.

08:01.940 --> 08:02.940
Oh, that's true.

08:02.940 --> 08:06.140
BlizzCon did that a while ago and it was really good for them because it gets people outside

08:06.140 --> 08:07.140
and you know.

08:07.140 --> 08:08.140
Well, that's true.

08:08.140 --> 08:09.140
Yeah, that's true, too.

08:09.140 --> 08:12.060
But I remember hoofing it to the subway across the street last year.

08:12.060 --> 08:13.060
Oh, yeah.

08:13.060 --> 08:14.060
You still have those options.

08:14.060 --> 08:15.060
But yeah.

08:15.060 --> 08:18.660
So but that's essentially what what second the arcade is all about.

08:18.660 --> 08:22.980
And it's been it's defined by our people.

08:22.980 --> 08:24.320
It's not defined by me.

08:24.320 --> 08:25.660
It's not defined by Brianna.

08:25.660 --> 08:30.340
It's you know, we we we host, you know, we we come up with with ways to keep improving

08:30.340 --> 08:34.100
on how we did the year before and, you know, continuous outreach.

08:34.100 --> 08:35.940
But it is defined by the people that come through.

08:35.940 --> 08:40.300
It is absolutely defined by Dark Sakura or we will all face a reign of terror.

08:40.300 --> 08:41.300
That's really what it.

08:41.300 --> 08:42.300
No, I'm kidding.

08:42.300 --> 08:43.300
I'm kidding.

08:43.300 --> 08:44.300
I'm kidding.

08:44.300 --> 08:45.300
All right.

08:45.300 --> 08:46.300
But no.

08:46.300 --> 08:48.820
When you when you say and I want the audience to know this and I realize that our audience

08:48.820 --> 08:52.500
is not like we maybe like two percent of our listeners are in Sacramento.

08:52.500 --> 08:55.760
Like if that like most of our listeners, we have listeners in Japan.

08:55.760 --> 08:57.700
We have listeners in Australia with Canada.

08:57.700 --> 09:00.020
So not everybody's going to be able to attend this event.

09:00.020 --> 09:01.020
All that.

09:01.020 --> 09:02.020
Yes.

09:02.020 --> 09:03.020
Of course.

09:03.020 --> 09:04.020
We have listeners in Belgium.

09:04.020 --> 09:05.020
How could I forget the chocolate?

09:05.020 --> 09:06.020
How could I forget?

09:06.020 --> 09:07.020
But anyway.

09:07.020 --> 09:09.620
So, you know, luckily, we'll be able to do the virtual thing and, you know, bring some

09:09.620 --> 09:10.620
to you.

09:10.620 --> 09:13.460
So although if you are like anywhere, like you're within 100 miles, Sacramento, you really

09:13.460 --> 09:16.340
should be trying to come here in person.

09:16.340 --> 09:17.340
And they are there.

09:17.340 --> 09:21.620
We are actually we actually are going to have some out of staters again this time.

09:21.740 --> 09:27.580
In fact, we we got hit with some international game developer submissions as well.

09:27.580 --> 09:28.580
Yeah.

09:28.580 --> 09:31.340
We got was that we're we got hit with some international game developers as well.

09:31.340 --> 09:32.340
Mexico.

09:32.340 --> 09:33.340
No, I mean, like Singapore.

09:33.340 --> 09:34.340
Oh, my God.

09:34.340 --> 09:38.340
Singapore, the UAE, Australia, Italy, Italy, Russia.

09:38.340 --> 09:39.340
Yeah.

09:39.340 --> 09:40.340
We got.

09:40.340 --> 09:41.340
Yeah.

09:41.340 --> 09:43.980
So I mean, they actually show up and that's another thing.

09:43.980 --> 09:47.020
But the fact that they even heard how they heard about us is beyond me.

09:47.020 --> 09:48.020
But but but somewhere.

09:48.020 --> 09:49.020
Yeah, indeed.

09:49.020 --> 09:50.020
But yeah.

09:50.420 --> 09:53.060
You know, we're just spreading out loud like wildfire.

09:53.060 --> 10:00.780
So but now again, you know, I mentioned Breed and, you know, her her two cents in this.

10:00.780 --> 10:06.460
So, you know, it's Breed why don't you share your thoughts on on this expand.

10:06.460 --> 10:08.460
Thanks, partner.

10:08.460 --> 10:09.460
Welcome.

10:09.460 --> 10:15.240
I'd like to say, you know, with you touching on your international audience, we are proud

10:15.240 --> 10:20.260
to say I think we've established that we are California's capital city that has their

10:20.260 --> 10:25.000
very first video game event to be proud of because California is the fifth largest economy

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
in the world.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.280
Why didn't Sacramento have something like that already established?

10:28.280 --> 10:34.600
So thanks to Orange Challenge Radio for helping us grow and setting a precedence here.

10:34.600 --> 10:40.280
We are able to say that we've had international game studios submit and then figure out that,

10:40.280 --> 10:41.460
oh, they're in Sacramento.

10:41.460 --> 10:42.960
It's kind of close to San Francisco.

10:42.960 --> 10:44.800
Like, should we come up?

10:45.360 --> 10:46.360
Oh, my God.

10:46.360 --> 10:47.680
Heck, I just it.

10:47.680 --> 10:49.200
It's just a natural fit.

10:49.200 --> 10:50.800
India and India is just a natural fit.

10:50.800 --> 10:54.920
We're so happy to be involved because I think we've been able to really see the growth.

10:54.920 --> 10:58.360
It's kind of like you said, like for a long time, you just kind of thought like, oh, EA

10:58.360 --> 11:00.320
has an office here, even though we're not sure what they do.

11:00.320 --> 11:03.160
But otherwise, like you don't really see a lot of the game development in Sacramento.

11:03.160 --> 11:06.720
But now it's like, you know, especially in large parts of this event, it's like, wow,

11:06.720 --> 11:11.760
you really see the passion that not just this community has, but you know, what's spilling

11:11.760 --> 11:16.080
in from the Bay Area, what's coming up from San Diego and all this, you know, our neighbors

11:16.080 --> 11:17.080
as well.

11:17.080 --> 11:19.240
Sacramento is a very central city.

11:19.240 --> 11:21.720
After all, this city was founded on the railroads, right?

11:21.720 --> 11:22.720
It was a big part of it.

11:22.720 --> 11:27.080
It was a very central kind of thing, but we're not a cow town, we're not a cow town.

11:27.080 --> 11:28.080
And gold.

11:28.080 --> 11:29.080
That's Vacaville.

11:29.080 --> 11:30.080
Literally.

11:30.080 --> 11:31.080
Yes.

11:31.080 --> 11:34.680
I have to acknowledge our chat room as well over at live.vognetwork.com.

11:34.680 --> 11:35.680
Hi chat room.

11:35.680 --> 11:40.800
We do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, vognetwork.com.

11:40.840 --> 11:43.440
It's six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

11:43.440 --> 11:47.960
And if you are listening live, head on over to live.vognetwork.com where they're talking

11:47.960 --> 11:51.320
about choc, choco tacos and is this something you did?

11:51.320 --> 11:52.920
No, no, no, no.

11:52.920 --> 11:56.840
Well, I just said choco taco, but act-deaf reminded us of Mexico.

11:56.840 --> 11:57.840
Yeah.

11:57.840 --> 11:58.840
Oh yes.

11:58.840 --> 11:59.840
We have a listener in Mexico right now.

11:59.840 --> 12:00.840
And the tacos are better than chocolate.

12:00.840 --> 12:01.840
Yes.

12:01.840 --> 12:05.200
And so my response was no, no, choco taco.

12:05.600 --> 12:11.000
JD, our pal who lives in the San Francisco area says, I'm looking forward to going to

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
IGDA.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
Yay.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
It's my first one.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
He's coming.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
He's coming for that.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
Yup.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
We welcome you.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
Thank you, JD.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
Is your last name Phoenix?

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
I don't think it is.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
Oh my God.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
I know JD and I don't think it is.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.360
If it is, we, we, you need to be my friend.

12:25.360 --> 12:26.960
So he can be your friend anyway though, right?

12:26.960 --> 12:27.960
I'll be Carmine.

12:27.960 --> 12:29.440
Uh, let's see.

12:29.440 --> 12:32.400
Going to some other comments from our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

12:32.400 --> 12:37.280
Raginator says question for Gabe and Brie, which, but this question is from Raginator.

12:37.280 --> 12:43.600
So which do you think will happen first Half Life 3 getting released or Loki finishing

12:43.600 --> 12:45.000
a game?

12:45.000 --> 12:53.120
Ooh, even I know the answer to that because I was looking forward to kind of busting his

12:53.120 --> 12:54.120
balls.

12:54.120 --> 12:55.120
Yeah.

12:55.120 --> 13:00.800
That's kind of why, you know, I mean, I'm like three confirmed folks love you.

13:00.800 --> 13:01.800
Love you.

13:02.200 --> 13:07.560
I'm sure we're not going to get through an episode without this, so I'll just keep that

13:07.560 --> 13:08.560
handy.

13:08.560 --> 13:09.560
Yes.

13:09.560 --> 13:10.560
Anyway.

13:10.560 --> 13:16.120
Well, wait, hold on, mister.

13:16.120 --> 13:17.120
Where's Crumple?

13:17.120 --> 13:19.120
Um, it's almost done.

13:19.120 --> 13:20.120
Crumple's almost finished.

13:20.120 --> 13:23.440
Do we have that almost done back when you were here in February?

13:23.440 --> 13:24.440
Yeah.

13:24.440 --> 13:27.760
And it's almost, it's only one other guy and myself.

13:27.760 --> 13:30.600
It's being polished.

13:30.600 --> 13:31.600
With a lot of flax.

13:31.600 --> 13:32.600
Okay.

13:32.600 --> 13:33.600
I got, I got to give you a little shit.

13:33.600 --> 13:34.600
What's the status of Crumple?

13:34.600 --> 13:35.600
So it'll be wax paper?

13:35.600 --> 13:37.720
Will I, will I get to play Crumple?

13:37.720 --> 13:41.040
Um, I cannot confirm or deny that as a matter of fact, we're not even going to go there

13:41.040 --> 13:42.040
just yet.

13:42.040 --> 13:43.040
Jesus Lord.

13:43.040 --> 13:44.280
I can't keep anything a secret.

13:44.280 --> 13:45.280
Well done on that.

13:45.280 --> 13:46.280
Anyway.

13:46.280 --> 13:47.280
So no, no, no.

13:47.280 --> 13:48.720
I'm saying, no, that was great.

13:48.720 --> 13:52.640
That was a wild coincidental guest and we're not going to talk about that idea for episode

13:52.640 --> 13:53.640
three.

13:53.640 --> 13:54.640
Anyway.

13:54.640 --> 13:57.640
You're going to have to sign an NDA first.

13:57.640 --> 13:58.640
No.

13:58.640 --> 14:00.560
That's the show after the show.

14:00.560 --> 14:02.920
So Crumple is almost done.

14:02.920 --> 14:06.800
And by almost done, I mean 97% done.

14:06.800 --> 14:07.800
We're fine.

14:07.800 --> 14:10.480
We're fine tuning the ending and then the ending's almost done.

14:10.480 --> 14:12.880
I got to look at it earlier this week.

14:12.880 --> 14:15.480
It is beautiful.

14:15.480 --> 14:21.840
In the message that it's, that I was hoping for it to convey and, and I, and I hope, I

14:21.840 --> 14:27.560
hope it made, I showed, I showed her, I showed Brianna and she really liked it a lot.

14:27.560 --> 14:30.520
So, but there's more, there's been more since then.

14:30.520 --> 14:32.360
And yeah, so we're, we're almost there.

14:32.360 --> 14:33.360
We're almost there.

14:33.360 --> 14:38.800
We're hoping this month will finally be it and, and we're already developing episode

14:38.800 --> 14:39.800
two.

14:39.800 --> 14:41.760
And yeah, so, but you can pre-order now.

14:41.760 --> 14:42.760
You can pre-order right.

14:42.760 --> 14:43.760
You still can pre-order.

14:43.760 --> 14:44.760
Go on my Twitter.

14:44.760 --> 14:47.720
It's on there and on my pin tweet and yeah, it's pre-orders a buck.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.320
When it goes on sale will be two.

14:49.320 --> 14:50.320
Nice.

14:50.320 --> 14:51.920
And nascent games on Twitter, right?

14:51.920 --> 14:52.920
Nascent games.

14:52.920 --> 14:53.920
Yeah.

14:53.920 --> 14:54.920
At nascent games.

14:54.920 --> 14:58.440
You can see gameplay of it right now, just in case, for those who have no idea what we're

14:58.440 --> 15:01.000
even talking about, nascentgames.net.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.120
And you can see gameplay immediately of Crumple.

15:03.120 --> 15:07.320
Wasn't there a demo on itch.io or is that not there anymore?

15:07.320 --> 15:11.240
I think the old demo is still on, on, on, on, but it's not, it's an old demo.

15:11.240 --> 15:12.240
Yeah.

15:12.240 --> 15:14.560
The, the, the, the most up to the final demos are on Newgrounds.

15:14.560 --> 15:18.720
You can go, you can play on through your browser on Newgrounds or you can download it on GameJolt.

15:18.720 --> 15:19.720
Okay.

15:19.720 --> 15:23.480
So yeah, we're hoping to get it released on those sites, the full game and as well as

15:23.480 --> 15:24.480
congregate.

15:24.480 --> 15:26.140
Um, and then a couple other spots, so.

15:26.140 --> 15:27.880
Or get your butt to West Sacramento on Saturday.

15:27.880 --> 15:28.880
Yeah.

15:28.880 --> 15:29.880
Come next Saturday.

15:29.880 --> 15:30.880
You can play there.

15:30.880 --> 15:31.880
So play it there.

15:31.880 --> 15:32.880
Absolutely.

15:32.880 --> 15:33.880
Excited for you.

15:33.880 --> 15:34.880
So I had to give you a little bit of crap on that.

15:34.880 --> 15:35.880
Totally.

15:35.880 --> 15:36.880
Okay.

15:36.880 --> 15:37.880
You're not.

15:37.880 --> 15:38.880
All right.

15:38.880 --> 15:39.880
Okay.

15:39.880 --> 15:40.880
Um, okay.

15:40.880 --> 15:41.880
So, so when you talk about this whole like play, learn, inspire, like I know sometimes

15:41.880 --> 15:46.160
people come here to promote their stuff with their taglines and a lot of us go, okay, yeah,

15:46.160 --> 15:47.160
sure.

15:47.160 --> 15:48.160
Cheesy.

15:48.160 --> 15:52.080
But you guys like, no, seriously, like, I really think that is a great way to describe

15:52.080 --> 15:56.080
the event because I have to admit, even from my perspective, you know, the very first year

15:56.080 --> 15:58.520
we didn't get to do, we, we hadn't met yet.

15:58.520 --> 16:01.960
We were connected the very, very first year, but we got to do this event with you guys

16:01.960 --> 16:02.960
the second year.

16:02.960 --> 16:05.400
And I remember, you know, I was kind of going into it going, okay, well, this is cool.

16:05.400 --> 16:06.880
It's gonna be like a local thing.

16:06.880 --> 16:10.440
And I saw the list of speakers and I was like, okay, well, I don't, I don't really know any

16:10.440 --> 16:11.440
of these people.

16:11.440 --> 16:12.440
They're local.

16:12.440 --> 16:15.620
I'm like, I'm not really gonna expect much, whatever will be interesting.

16:15.620 --> 16:19.520
But I was, I was like really blown away by like the quality of speakers that you guys

16:19.520 --> 16:21.360
been drawing to the event.

16:21.360 --> 16:25.760
Not just that year, you guys had a great set of people last year as well, which was even

16:25.760 --> 16:29.280
great networking to meet people like Kat and Michelle and some of the people we had last

16:29.280 --> 16:30.280
year.

16:30.280 --> 16:31.280
Absolutely.

16:31.280 --> 16:36.040
Um, you know, you, you guys, I think really have brought that inspiration and like thinking

16:36.040 --> 16:37.040
stuff.

16:37.040 --> 16:39.400
And I'm really happy that through VOG, we can kind of bring that to you guys virtually

16:39.400 --> 16:40.400
a little bit.

16:40.400 --> 16:43.520
I know some of you guys have heard it, uh, in chat that, you know, we're listening here

16:43.520 --> 16:46.840
the past couple of years, but, um, maybe I'll pick on Bree a little more here.

16:46.840 --> 16:50.160
Um, what, tell us a little bit about the speakers you guys have lined up for this year.

16:50.160 --> 16:51.760
What we're going to hear about this year.

16:51.760 --> 16:57.360
So we're really proud of the lineup that, um, Gabe has really, you know, spearheaded

16:57.360 --> 16:58.360
and putting together.

16:58.360 --> 17:03.080
We try to be conscious of, you know, making it diverse.

17:03.080 --> 17:06.160
Um, obviously we have some ladies who will be attending.

17:06.160 --> 17:08.640
Michelle Hill will be our keynote speaker.

17:08.640 --> 17:11.120
She is originally from Rancho Cordova.

17:11.120 --> 17:15.100
She now works at two K games out in the Bay area over the last 12 months.

17:15.100 --> 17:20.320
She has come back and poured into our community, mentoring our developers, um, really pouring

17:20.320 --> 17:21.420
her heart into it.

17:21.420 --> 17:23.180
And we appreciate her so much for that.

17:23.180 --> 17:24.180
Yeah.

17:24.180 --> 17:25.180
She's really cool.

17:25.180 --> 17:26.180
I met, I got met her and got to talk with her last year.

17:26.180 --> 17:27.180
She's great.

17:27.180 --> 17:28.180
She's great.

17:28.180 --> 17:29.180
Yes.

17:29.180 --> 17:30.180
And she's grown as well.

17:30.180 --> 17:33.900
Um, her first time speaking in public was last year at the 2016 second year arcade.

17:33.900 --> 17:37.660
Just a few weeks ago, she spoke at the game developers conference in San Francisco.

17:37.660 --> 17:39.720
That's up on YouTube and in the vault.

17:39.720 --> 17:43.300
If you guys want to check that out, but you gave her her big break.

17:43.300 --> 17:45.460
We gave her her big break.

17:45.460 --> 17:46.500
We did.

17:46.500 --> 17:51.040
And how it happened to this day, we laugh about how it even happened to begin with.

17:51.040 --> 17:55.600
She just happened to email us through the website on the contact form.

17:55.600 --> 17:57.540
I thought she was fake.

17:57.540 --> 17:59.620
So cause I'm looking her up on LinkedIn.

17:59.620 --> 18:04.300
I'm like, you're, you can't, someone, not some, nobody from two K games is seriously

18:04.300 --> 18:05.380
going to know about who we are.

18:05.380 --> 18:09.060
I remember telling Brie, like Brie, someone from two K games just messaged us.

18:09.060 --> 18:10.060
She's gotta be a fake.

18:10.060 --> 18:12.540
And it turns out, Oh my God, no, she's not.

18:13.140 --> 18:18.300
She ends up being a speaker last year, as Brianna said, and, and which is why it's like

18:18.300 --> 18:21.040
the amount of support just out of nowhere.

18:21.040 --> 18:27.860
She came, she came from the heavens and just help and has just helped us out from just

18:27.860 --> 18:30.940
continuing to educate our community.

18:30.940 --> 18:31.940
It's been wonderful.

18:31.940 --> 18:32.940
Absolutely wonderful.

18:32.940 --> 18:36.240
So yeah, hometown girls coming back.

18:36.240 --> 18:40.540
We also have the co-founder of Code for Hood, Alana Jennings.

18:40.540 --> 18:46.700
She works with youth that may not have much exposure to STEM programs like game development.

18:46.700 --> 18:50.000
She's going to be doing a presentation on what her organization has done.

18:50.000 --> 18:54.060
They also want a big grant from the city of Sacramento to help accelerate their program.

18:54.060 --> 18:56.240
So we're really proud to feature her.

18:56.240 --> 18:59.900
We have people from the United States Patent and Trademark Office because this is the one

18:59.900 --> 19:01.460
I'm looking forward to the most.

19:01.460 --> 19:02.460
I am.

19:02.460 --> 19:04.900
No, this is, we don't talk about this crap enough.

19:04.900 --> 19:06.600
I say that lovingly, but you know what I mean?

19:06.600 --> 19:09.060
Like you're right, but, but it becomes like that thing.

19:09.060 --> 19:11.780
Like when you're designing a game and stuff for these issues, these legal issues you get

19:11.780 --> 19:14.540
into the, you're probably not even thinking of in the beginning of it.

19:14.540 --> 19:16.480
I am really interested in this.

19:16.480 --> 19:20.600
This is a part of like game development that I think we don't ever like think about or

19:20.600 --> 19:21.600
talk about enough.

19:21.600 --> 19:22.600
So.

19:22.600 --> 19:23.600
Right.

19:23.600 --> 19:26.660
And that's one thing Gabe and I try to impress upon our community here is, you know, we want

19:26.660 --> 19:28.420
our developers to be successful.

19:28.420 --> 19:33.600
We want to help them grow smart and to build a strong foundation so that they're not a,

19:33.600 --> 19:36.420
you know, fly by night entity, if you will.

19:36.420 --> 19:41.280
So that's why we incorporate the business serious side with the United States Patent

19:41.280 --> 19:42.280
and Trademark Office.

19:42.280 --> 19:45.940
But I just, I just have to drop this here because you'll get a kick out of this, Bree.

19:45.940 --> 19:50.160
Our pal Bobby Blackwell, who does the show before us here at VOG, he's actually mentioning

19:50.160 --> 19:51.160
in chat.

19:51.160 --> 19:54.880
I got to meet Kat, who was one of the speakers last year in Atlanta last year.

19:54.880 --> 19:55.880
And I was like, did you name drop?

19:55.880 --> 19:56.880
He's like, of course I did.

19:56.880 --> 20:02.280
She's like, I know OLR, she's recognized, so there, yeah, so there you go through some

20:02.280 --> 20:04.060
of this whole networking thing.

20:04.060 --> 20:05.060
Beautiful.

20:05.060 --> 20:06.060
Creates contacts in other places.

20:06.700 --> 20:10.960
We're also going to have now, unfortunately, we don't get to do this part on VOG because

20:10.960 --> 20:11.960
it's music.

20:11.960 --> 20:16.240
But if you're going to be there in person, you guys you guys got like, I mean, your musicians

20:16.240 --> 20:19.720
in the past have been great, but you got one that like people are are going to know this

20:19.720 --> 20:20.720
year, right?

20:20.720 --> 20:21.720
Yeah.

20:21.720 --> 20:22.720
Thanks to Rockage on this one.

20:22.720 --> 20:27.080
They you know, we were you know, we were actively looking for somebody and, you know, we try

20:27.080 --> 20:32.900
to highlight just one good person, you know, to to, you know, just, you know, be a part

20:32.900 --> 20:36.640
of the vibe, enhance, further enhance the vibe, you know, at our event.

20:36.640 --> 20:41.280
And yeah, we have we have I didn't even know this either until after way afterwards.

20:41.280 --> 20:45.000
Ben Prunty, Prunty, I don't want to say prune like prunty.

20:45.000 --> 20:49.780
But anyway, so Ben Prunty, he is actually the guy that made the music for FTL.

20:49.780 --> 20:52.860
So which is insanity.

20:52.860 --> 20:53.860
And I freaked out completely.

20:53.860 --> 20:55.720
I was like, oh, my goodness.

20:55.720 --> 21:00.660
And yeah, so it was it was a big deal to have him a part of this of this event this time

21:00.660 --> 21:01.660
around.

21:01.660 --> 21:03.100
And we are eternally grateful for it.

21:03.100 --> 21:09.960
And I think this will be his second live show, I think, because this first one was Rockage

21:09.960 --> 21:13.440
just a month and a half about a month and a half ago.

21:13.440 --> 21:14.440
So this will be a second.

21:14.440 --> 21:15.800
But his first time in Sacramento.

21:15.800 --> 21:18.040
So yeah, this will be this is going to be big.

21:18.040 --> 21:24.000
And y'all may think you haven't heard of him, but you have because that Humble Freedom Bundle

21:24.000 --> 21:27.200
that just was out not that long ago, FTL was in that, right?

21:27.200 --> 21:28.760
Was the soundtrack in that too?

21:28.760 --> 21:29.760
I remember.

21:29.860 --> 21:32.820
I want to say yes, but I might be off somebody in chat.

21:32.820 --> 21:37.180
That's that's what the great thing about having a chat room is we get live fact checking because

21:37.180 --> 21:44.660
if we screw up, like that's an alternative fact, Rob, that's not at least someone's fact

21:44.660 --> 21:45.660
checking.

21:45.660 --> 21:46.660
In general.

21:46.660 --> 21:47.660
Take a shot.

21:47.660 --> 21:48.660
All right.

21:48.660 --> 22:00.380
Black Wolf in chat says FTL is usually in bundles.

22:00.380 --> 22:04.260
So you most likely have it at some point in the game is, you know, it's a very well known

22:04.260 --> 22:05.260
indie game.

22:05.260 --> 22:06.260
So that's great.

22:06.260 --> 22:07.580
That's gonna be cool that you have that.

22:07.580 --> 22:11.440
And hopefully I'll be able to slip him a business card to get him on our show, if not for a

22:11.440 --> 22:13.560
performance to at least talk about the music a little bit.

22:13.560 --> 22:14.560
So I'll be cool.

22:14.560 --> 22:15.560
It's all about networking.

22:15.560 --> 22:16.560
Yes.

22:17.060 --> 22:21.880
You know, the Sacramento shows us in the game back game bang.

22:21.880 --> 22:28.320
I can't say their name five times fast, those guys, but video game, game, game, game, game,

22:28.320 --> 22:29.320
game, bang.

22:29.320 --> 22:30.320
I can't fucking do it.

22:30.320 --> 22:31.320
VGB.

22:31.320 --> 22:32.320
VGB.

22:32.320 --> 22:33.320
I like that.

22:33.320 --> 22:36.440
So us and VGB are going to be circling like cocks.

22:36.440 --> 22:40.240
Come on the show, come on the show.

22:40.240 --> 22:41.520
And hey, it's all good.

22:41.520 --> 22:42.580
Those guys are awesome, too.

22:42.580 --> 22:45.240
And I'm sure we'll have all the same guests, but we're going to both have fun.

22:45.240 --> 22:46.240
It'll be good.

22:46.920 --> 22:47.920
Excellent.

22:47.920 --> 22:48.920
Excellent.

22:48.920 --> 22:49.920
Um, I'm still looking forward to the event.

22:49.920 --> 22:54.600
Um, what, what, um, have you, have you tried to do anything to this for either of you that

22:54.600 --> 22:55.600
want to answer it?

22:55.600 --> 22:59.960
Have you tried to do anything different this year compared to last year or you kind of

22:59.960 --> 23:04.520
like after last year show, you're like, okay, this formula, like this worked well, so we're

23:04.520 --> 23:06.040
going to kind of roll with it again.

23:06.040 --> 23:07.040
Like we got it.

23:07.040 --> 23:08.040
We got a template now.

23:08.040 --> 23:09.040
Yeah.

23:09.040 --> 23:10.040
Bree

23:10.040 --> 23:15.060
we really want to make it like a Disney freaking experience.

23:15.060 --> 23:18.460
It's supposed to be an interactive day, right?

23:18.460 --> 23:23.580
And you know, we're, we don't have any sponsors, but I'm working with the resources that I

23:23.580 --> 23:28.260
have to make it feel like people are watching, walking into an actual arcade.

23:28.260 --> 23:34.020
You're going to have the sounds and the feel and the looks and we just want it all encompassing.

23:34.020 --> 23:36.820
Oh, this is why you guys were there setting up the art.

23:36.820 --> 23:40.060
Or am I supposed to say that you guys are no, no, you can, no, you totally tweeted it.

23:40.060 --> 23:43.180
I can say it's out there.

23:43.180 --> 23:47.340
You were setting up the art gallery stuff there, which I don't remember that last year.

23:47.340 --> 23:48.340
That's new.

23:48.340 --> 23:49.340
This is brand new.

23:49.340 --> 23:50.340
Yeah.

23:50.340 --> 23:51.340
Yeah.

23:51.340 --> 23:52.340
I like that.

23:52.340 --> 23:55.460
So you're taking a Disney approach because one thing that separates Disneyland from like,

23:55.460 --> 24:01.620
I don't know, um, Marine world is that, um, when you go on like Indiana Jones, right,

24:01.620 --> 24:06.580
you're even, you're standing in the line and you can like shake the pole and the rope that

24:06.580 --> 24:07.960
the guy will fall from, right?

24:07.960 --> 24:10.040
Like everything around is an experience.

24:10.040 --> 24:13.520
Whereas like at Marine world, it's like, okay, you're going to go on the Superman roller

24:13.520 --> 24:19.000
coaster and there's literally nothing Superman about it except for the screams of pure terror

24:19.000 --> 24:20.180
that you hear coming from the ride.

24:20.180 --> 24:21.180
That's really it.

24:21.180 --> 24:23.840
Um, practically hear that on the drive going there.

24:23.840 --> 24:28.020
She's on I 80, you know, no, no disrespect to Marine world, but that's something that

24:28.020 --> 24:29.320
Disney does very well.

24:29.320 --> 24:30.320
Right.

24:30.320 --> 24:31.320
So I like that approach.

24:31.320 --> 24:36.960
So you want, you're gonna, you're gonna create that environment more this year.

24:36.960 --> 24:37.960
Definitely very cool.

24:37.960 --> 24:38.960
Very cool.

24:38.960 --> 24:39.960
I'm so excited to be a part of it.

24:39.960 --> 24:40.960
And that's just one aspect.

24:40.960 --> 24:41.960
Yeah.

24:41.960 --> 24:42.960
One.

24:42.960 --> 24:43.960
That's one.

24:43.960 --> 24:44.960
Yeah.

24:44.960 --> 24:45.960
So you guys don't just have indie games.

24:45.960 --> 24:48.920
I mean, I don't know how you cram this all in that space, but you do.

24:48.920 --> 24:50.800
You don't just have any games.

24:50.800 --> 24:54.920
You're going to have like retrospectives and stuff too.

24:54.920 --> 24:55.920
Huh?

24:55.920 --> 24:56.920
Yes.

24:56.920 --> 24:57.920
Pretty much.

24:57.920 --> 24:58.920
Yeah.

24:58.920 --> 25:01.760
We're going to be, I'm going to let Brie laugh that one off, but, um, the, the idea here

25:01.760 --> 25:08.180
is, is that, um, yeah, we, one thing we, one thing we, um, the gallery is one thing that

25:08.180 --> 25:10.780
we're incorporating for this, for this new event.

25:10.780 --> 25:15.460
Um, and we're super, super excited and very grateful to the community center for, you

25:15.460 --> 25:17.020
know, for that addition.

25:17.020 --> 25:20.620
Um, and, uh, if you happen to be in West Sac, stop by it.

25:20.620 --> 25:23.020
The art's on display all week, so be sure to go by there.

25:23.020 --> 25:24.020
Check that out.

25:24.020 --> 25:28.080
Um, you know, but we, well, there's a few things we weren't successful with because

25:28.080 --> 25:29.080
of the timing of such.

25:29.080 --> 25:30.820
We're hoping to incorporate that for next year.

25:30.820 --> 25:36.940
Um, but yeah, indie developers, both video, VR and board and tabletop.

25:36.940 --> 25:41.180
Um, and then, um, we'll, we will also, you know, again, we talked about the speakers

25:41.180 --> 25:42.420
and the panelists as well.

25:42.420 --> 25:43.820
Uh, additional game tournaments.

25:43.820 --> 25:46.020
We're going to have a speed runner this time.

25:46.020 --> 25:51.300
Um, yeah, he's a pretty significant speed runner and uh, yeah, yeah.

25:51.300 --> 25:53.340
Thanks to console cadence and them for that.

25:53.340 --> 25:56.660
So you have console Cade, you have Atari party parties coming back.

25:56.660 --> 25:57.660
Absolutely.

25:57.660 --> 25:58.660
That's, that's an absolute must.

25:58.660 --> 26:06.720
So that's a touch part of the vault Dan brings, Dan brings 52 hundreds, by the way, our chatters

26:06.720 --> 26:11.920
running away with this Disney thing, by the way, uh, dungeon buster says walking into

26:11.920 --> 26:12.920
an actual arcade.

26:12.920 --> 26:14.120
I like this approach.

26:14.120 --> 26:19.760
Uh, Bobby Black Wolf is asking, can I go ahead and register my fast passes?

26:19.760 --> 26:23.480
Is a season pass to sack in the arcade a thousand dollars?

26:23.480 --> 26:26.480
We're going to incorporate that on our Indiegogo campaign for 2018.

26:26.480 --> 26:28.480
Thank you for that suggestion.

26:28.480 --> 26:31.240
Will I have the music playing in line stuck in my head?

26:31.240 --> 26:35.680
Will it be a world of laughter and a world of tears?

26:35.680 --> 26:39.080
In a world of hope and a world of fear.

26:39.080 --> 26:40.560
This is already a world of pain.

26:40.560 --> 26:41.560
Seriously.

26:41.560 --> 26:42.560
Yes.

26:42.560 --> 26:43.560
Thank you.

26:43.560 --> 26:44.560
Yeah.

26:44.560 --> 26:45.560
JD is following that up.

26:45.560 --> 26:46.800
One thing that separates them is about $50 in admission.

26:46.800 --> 26:47.800
There you go.

26:47.800 --> 26:48.800
That's right.

26:48.800 --> 26:50.200
That's actually very $10.

26:50.200 --> 26:51.200
That's right.

26:51.200 --> 26:55.480
Will there be speakers hidden inside rocks?

26:55.480 --> 26:56.480
We can arrange that.

26:56.480 --> 26:57.480
Don't go looking.

26:57.480 --> 26:59.480
Let's just leave it that way.

26:59.480 --> 27:00.480
Don't go look.

27:00.480 --> 27:01.480
Yeah.

27:01.480 --> 27:02.480
We got a funny fucking bunch.

27:02.480 --> 27:04.480
These people are funny as shit.

27:04.480 --> 27:05.480
Oh, you nerds.

27:05.480 --> 27:08.880
We should have a two drink minimum here.

27:08.880 --> 27:09.880
Seriously.

27:09.880 --> 27:10.880
The voice of geeks network.

27:10.880 --> 27:11.880
They come out.

27:11.880 --> 27:12.880
They come out in force.

27:12.880 --> 27:14.160
All them funny geeks all over.

27:14.160 --> 27:19.320
It's probably a bad segue then for me to talk about the charitable organizations that'll

27:19.320 --> 27:20.320
be there.

27:20.320 --> 27:21.320
No, let's.

27:21.320 --> 27:22.320
Come on.

27:22.320 --> 27:23.920
It's all about doing some good.

27:23.920 --> 27:26.820
We can laugh and throw shade and stuff as long as we know at the end of the day we're

27:26.820 --> 27:27.820
doing good.

27:27.820 --> 27:28.820
Yeah, right.

27:28.820 --> 27:29.820
We're making a positive impact.

27:29.820 --> 27:30.820
Absolutely.

27:30.820 --> 27:34.300
The Sacramento Guild for Extra Life is also going to be on site.

27:34.300 --> 27:37.740
They're going to be hanging out with our Street Fighter tournament.

27:37.740 --> 27:41.780
And we also have a new organization that we're welcoming called the Gamers Gift.

27:41.780 --> 27:47.260
And they're based out of UC Davis college students who take VR consoles and video games

27:47.260 --> 27:50.900
to senior care facilities and children's hospitals.

27:50.900 --> 27:56.600
And they basically try to, you know, help liven up the atmosphere there and bring the

27:56.600 --> 27:57.820
adventure to them.

27:57.820 --> 28:00.500
That's like when you used to hear about the Nintendo Wiis.

28:00.500 --> 28:04.560
The Wii Sports Bowling were at all the senior care facilities and stuff to get more seniors

28:04.560 --> 28:05.560
into gaming.

28:05.560 --> 28:10.900
But I didn't even think of VR as something that could do that.

28:10.900 --> 28:12.460
That's really cool.

28:12.460 --> 28:15.860
I see Bobby Blackwell sitting up in his chair out there somewhere.

28:15.860 --> 28:19.240
He's our big VR guy on the network.

28:19.240 --> 28:22.600
So people will get a chance to meet them and learn more about who they are and how they

28:22.600 --> 28:24.920
can help their local organization too.

28:24.920 --> 28:25.920
That's so cool.

28:25.920 --> 28:26.920
I love that's a great idea.

28:26.920 --> 28:28.180
I love that.

28:28.180 --> 28:32.220
So yeah, we are we are not we are not just another convention.

28:32.220 --> 28:33.220
We are.

28:33.220 --> 28:34.220
We're really trying.

28:34.220 --> 28:35.220
No, we are.

28:35.220 --> 28:36.300
There's no trying.

28:36.300 --> 28:38.100
We are.

28:38.100 --> 28:44.020
We are standing out with with reference to the amount of folks we were trying to impact

28:44.020 --> 28:45.820
both locally and beyond.

28:45.820 --> 28:52.540
And you know, have substance in our event where it's not just a day, it's not just as

28:52.540 --> 28:55.060
you mentioned earlier, a day of networking.

28:55.060 --> 28:58.280
It's going to be an incredible day of networking.

28:58.280 --> 29:03.520
But then from that point, the hope I have for this is that someone's going to walk in

29:03.520 --> 29:07.960
there be a younger old and they're going to play something or they're going to hear they're

29:07.960 --> 29:13.160
going to meet someone and they're going to say, I can and they're going to be and then

29:13.160 --> 29:16.200
they're going to leave and they're going to find out how they're going to be able to utilize

29:16.200 --> 29:19.280
that because I was that person five and a half years ago.

29:19.280 --> 29:25.740
Or if they're Loki, they say, I will someday, eventually when I have time.

29:25.740 --> 29:28.500
Push that shade button, sir.

29:28.500 --> 29:29.500
Fantastic.

29:29.500 --> 29:35.280
But yes, that's Loki.

29:35.280 --> 29:36.280
We love you.

29:36.280 --> 29:37.280
Damn it.

29:37.280 --> 29:38.280
Get that game done already.

29:38.280 --> 29:43.340
Which I would like to stop busting his balls for a second because we will have a game developer

29:43.340 --> 29:46.780
panelist gentleman there who develops games with his kids.

29:46.780 --> 29:51.640
And props to Loki for doing the family bit and being on the show and holding down the

29:51.640 --> 29:52.640
day job.

29:52.640 --> 29:54.560
But if others can do it, Loki can do it too.

29:54.560 --> 30:00.040
So hopefully he takes notes during that panel.

30:00.040 --> 30:03.560
I thought she was going to get sick of that fucking button by the end of the night.

30:03.560 --> 30:09.920
I could have sworn she said, you know, let's not bust his balls and then just busted his

30:09.920 --> 30:11.920
balls anyway.

30:11.920 --> 30:16.020
That was the shade because I'm not going to do it directly, but I totally just did it.

30:16.040 --> 30:18.040
But indirectly, I'm going to do it anyway.

30:18.040 --> 30:19.040
Ninjas.

30:19.040 --> 30:20.040
No.

30:20.040 --> 30:21.040
We love Loki.

30:21.040 --> 30:22.040
Come on.

30:22.040 --> 30:29.680
And that's actually a good mention too because one of the speakers, our dear friend Steve

30:29.680 --> 30:33.800
Whitney, he's going to be talking, one of his panels is going to be highlighting just

30:33.800 --> 30:34.800
that.

30:34.800 --> 30:41.200
The importance of parents and their children, you know, gaming and game developing together.

30:41.200 --> 30:45.920
We're actually going to have a couple of game studios where it's actually parent and child

30:45.920 --> 30:49.580
together and showing off their game.

30:49.580 --> 30:56.540
One art piece in a gallery we received this past Friday, the poster is a great 80s style

30:56.540 --> 31:01.300
poster of the game that they're working on, RC battle, RC car battle.

31:01.300 --> 31:08.500
And the idea is that there's a kid with an old school retro style motorcycle helmet on

31:08.500 --> 31:11.820
with holding a remote control and it happens to be a son and the game is actually a son's

31:11.820 --> 31:12.820
idea.

31:12.820 --> 31:13.820
Oh, cool.

31:13.820 --> 31:15.240
It's just absolutely incredible.

31:15.240 --> 31:19.680
I mean, I was so touched by that.

31:19.680 --> 31:21.920
We actually had the pleasure of meeting them briefly.

31:21.920 --> 31:22.920
It was fantastic.

31:22.920 --> 31:30.680
So that's just an example of how we, you know, how in the arcade, SAC and the arcade is going

31:30.680 --> 31:37.240
to continue to be different and forge its own path and not copy other paths.

31:37.240 --> 31:43.580
We're going to forge our own path into creating something much more significant here.

31:43.580 --> 31:48.560
Because as I said earlier in the show, there was no job market for game development period

31:48.560 --> 31:49.560
here.

31:49.560 --> 31:50.560
There just wasn't.

31:50.560 --> 31:51.560
But now we do.

31:51.560 --> 31:54.300
Now we have one and it's, and it's just getting better.

31:54.300 --> 31:55.980
So well, okay.

31:55.980 --> 31:59.040
If y'all are local, I don't know how to sell this shit to you anymore.

31:59.040 --> 32:00.900
Like you aren't already planning on attending.

32:00.900 --> 32:02.980
I really don't know what else I can say at this point.

32:02.980 --> 32:06.800
So I hope you all are planning to be here to hang out with Gabe, to hang out with Bree

32:06.800 --> 32:08.620
and us at VOG Network.

32:08.620 --> 32:14.860
We will be upstairs in the little black box all day to work with the broadcast of the

32:14.860 --> 32:18.860
actual panels so that if you can't be here live, you can at least check out some of the

32:18.860 --> 32:19.860
panels.

32:19.860 --> 32:23.980
Although I'll warn you, tech shit always happens, so it's not super reliable.

32:23.980 --> 32:27.620
But if nothing else, we'll have it all taped and we're planning to rebroadcast it.

32:27.620 --> 32:30.820
Hopefully WinOLR would usually be on the next night since we're not going to actually be

32:30.820 --> 32:31.820
here the next night.

32:31.820 --> 32:35.980
So that'll be an opportunity for folks to check that out if nothing else.

32:35.980 --> 32:37.740
So we always have a plan B.

32:37.860 --> 32:38.860
Always have a plan B.

32:39.860 --> 32:40.860
Awesome.

32:40.860 --> 32:41.860
So, yeah.

32:41.860 --> 32:46.300
So we'll talk more, of course, about the event and what you guys are up to as we move on

32:46.300 --> 32:47.300
throughout the show tonight.

32:47.300 --> 32:50.300
But I do want to make sure we get to some of the other topics going on in gaming world

32:50.300 --> 32:51.300
this week.

32:51.300 --> 32:55.500
So let's move on and talk about, we'll get into gaming news in a moment here, but I want

32:55.500 --> 32:59.180
to talk quickly about this because Dark Soccer, you weren't here last week because you had

32:59.180 --> 33:01.660
the Kidney Stone thing going on.

33:01.660 --> 33:05.800
And we got to hear a little bit from you on Skype about this, but I really got the sense

33:05.840 --> 33:10.360
you didn't really get to dive into Mass Effect Andromeda until this week.

33:10.360 --> 33:14.640
So I want to check in with you a little bit more about how the game is going because I

33:14.640 --> 33:17.560
don't often listen to this show because I live it.

33:17.560 --> 33:19.320
I don't need to listen to it again usually.

33:19.320 --> 33:23.000
But I did kind of listen back to last week's show and in listening back, I was kind of

33:23.000 --> 33:27.040
like, God, I might've been like a little harsh on the game because at the end of the day,

33:27.040 --> 33:32.000
I'm still a fan of Mass Effect, but, and I know we use this scenario all the time and

33:32.000 --> 33:37.880
y'all are sick of hearing this metaphor, but it's that whole Tyra Banks yelling at the

33:37.880 --> 33:43.440
model thing because it's the things you care about the most that you're going to blow up

33:43.440 --> 33:44.880
and yell at first.

33:44.880 --> 33:47.880
And so I think kind of some of that was happening last week a little bit with Mass Effect because

33:47.880 --> 33:52.000
Dark Soccer, I know you weren't here, but I got into a little bit about the lack of

33:52.000 --> 33:57.600
the gay romances that were in it and some of that that was going on and well, because

33:57.600 --> 34:02.280
there's only two and there's a trophy for three and you can't actually get the trophy

34:02.280 --> 34:03.280
if you choose to play.

34:03.280 --> 34:04.280
Yeah, you can.

34:04.280 --> 34:05.280
No, you can't.

34:05.280 --> 34:09.480
Because there's ladies and there's dudes and you can do lesbian and you can do Dark

34:09.480 --> 34:10.480
Sakura.

34:10.480 --> 34:14.840
You, I don't think, I don't know if you're understanding, but you, I can't just, if I

34:14.840 --> 34:18.520
want to play a gay writer, I can't just suddenly say, oh, I'm going to sleep with a woman to

34:18.520 --> 34:19.520
get the trophy.

34:19.520 --> 34:20.520
Well, no, no, no, no.

34:20.520 --> 34:25.360
I mean that you could play a female character and get a lesbian romance, but you see, you

34:25.360 --> 34:26.360
see where the issue is, right?

34:26.360 --> 34:27.360
I do.

34:28.120 --> 34:30.520
I don't get that, but I think that there actually are more lesbian options.

34:30.520 --> 34:36.080
Well, yes, and that's great for the gay ladies, but it's also kind of like, you know, it kind

34:36.080 --> 34:43.580
of also, in my opinion, reinforces a trope that being a lesbian is more acceptable than

34:43.580 --> 34:46.520
being gay, which I've had to deal with in my life, right?

34:46.520 --> 34:51.060
And you know, anybody that's had to deal with that whole, well, if the two chicks are making

34:51.060 --> 34:53.400
out that's hot, you know, that whole, it's that thing.

34:53.400 --> 34:54.400
That's the only thing that bothers me about.

34:54.440 --> 34:58.200
But anyway, I promised I wouldn't be negative this week, but just to recap, those are some

34:58.200 --> 34:59.680
of the things we were talking about last week.

34:59.680 --> 35:00.680
And then there was the whole...

35:00.680 --> 35:01.680
Dude, I like Gil though.

35:01.680 --> 35:06.080
The trans character was, was like, it was a little rough.

35:06.080 --> 35:11.040
I think that they were, I wouldn't expect like a real trans person to use their dead

35:11.040 --> 35:12.040
name.

35:12.040 --> 35:16.720
But at the same time, I think it was just to bring out that this character does exist.

35:16.720 --> 35:20.920
So maybe it was a poorly designed storytelling.

35:20.920 --> 35:24.400
But at least they were trying to say that, yes, in the future, just like the present

35:24.400 --> 35:25.400
trans people exist.

35:25.400 --> 35:27.480
So, you know, that's...

35:27.480 --> 35:29.200
The execution could have been better, but...

35:29.200 --> 35:30.200
It's one of those...

35:30.200 --> 35:31.200
Have you seen that picture?

35:31.200 --> 35:32.200
I was pretty happy to see it.

35:32.200 --> 35:35.560
Have you seen that picture on Tumblr of the star where it says, you tried, written in

35:35.560 --> 35:36.560
Comic Sans?

35:36.560 --> 35:37.560
Yeah.

35:37.560 --> 35:38.560
That's kind of how I feel about it.

35:38.560 --> 35:39.560
You tried.

35:39.560 --> 35:40.560
Yeah.

35:40.560 --> 35:44.720
So anyway, all that stuff aside, I want to check in a little bit on some of the pauses

35:44.720 --> 35:48.560
because I got to say, I've spent a lot more time with the game this week and I, there

35:48.560 --> 35:52.400
is a lot that I really, really, really do like about Andromeda.

35:52.400 --> 35:56.800
Just like the story, I think what you really get into it, I think the story is really good.

35:56.800 --> 35:59.480
I convinced a dude in Target to buy it.

35:59.480 --> 36:00.480
Did you?

36:00.480 --> 36:01.480
I pulled a Shane.

36:01.480 --> 36:02.480
Yeah.

36:02.480 --> 36:03.480
His powers were on low.

36:03.480 --> 36:08.240
Well, Shane just beat the game today and obviously he won't tell me a lot because of spoilers,

36:08.240 --> 36:10.960
but he said it will absolutely be his game of the year.

36:10.960 --> 36:14.020
He doesn't understand the negativity going on at all.

36:14.020 --> 36:17.160
He said some of the most gut wrenching decisions he's ever had to make in a BioWare game were

36:17.160 --> 36:18.160
in this game.

36:18.600 --> 36:19.840
And I've had that same moment.

36:19.840 --> 36:24.440
There have definitely been decisions in this game where I'm like, I can't fucking choose.

36:24.440 --> 36:26.440
This is too hard.

36:26.440 --> 36:27.440
I don't know.

36:27.440 --> 36:30.600
I may have looked at a couple of spoilers.

36:30.600 --> 36:36.480
And what's tough about Andromeda this time is that, you know, in the Shepard Paragon

36:36.480 --> 36:40.200
Renegade thing, it was a lot of decisions were very black and white.

36:40.200 --> 36:42.700
You could be good guy or you could be bad guy basically.

36:42.700 --> 36:48.100
But it was more like it wasn't bad guy so much as like being an asshole to get what

36:48.100 --> 36:50.440
you want type of thing.

36:50.440 --> 36:52.520
But in Andromeda, those lines are gone.

36:52.520 --> 36:56.860
And so it's not always clear what the good guy option is.

36:56.860 --> 36:59.820
And that's what makes the decisions a lot fucking harder.

36:59.820 --> 37:03.320
I've been just aiming for whatever answers are professional when dealing with complete

37:03.320 --> 37:07.580
strangers and then with dealing with the crew have been a little bit snarky.

37:07.580 --> 37:09.620
Have you gone in to read your psychological profile?

37:09.620 --> 37:10.620
No, not yet.

37:10.620 --> 37:11.620
Oh, yeah.

37:11.620 --> 37:12.620
You got to do that.

37:12.660 --> 37:15.560
It's like a codex or journal when I don't forget which one it is and you actually select

37:15.560 --> 37:21.880
yourself and Lexi actually is filling out as you go along a psychological profile on

37:21.880 --> 37:22.880
you.

37:22.880 --> 37:23.880
Cool.

37:23.880 --> 37:24.880
And like the decisions you're making.

37:24.880 --> 37:25.880
I adore Lexi.

37:25.880 --> 37:26.880
Yeah.

37:26.880 --> 37:28.340
So what are your what are your thoughts on the game?

37:28.340 --> 37:29.340
What are your thoughts on Andromeda?

37:29.340 --> 37:33.180
So far, I love Gil and I wish I could date him.

37:33.180 --> 37:37.380
He makes me think of Alistair from Dragon Age.

37:37.380 --> 37:40.420
So yeah, that's a that's a good comparison right there.

37:40.420 --> 37:46.100
But Vetra is eternal space waifu although I am going for Jahl.

37:46.100 --> 37:47.940
I can't believe Dark Sakura of all people.

37:47.940 --> 37:48.940
No, seriously.

37:48.940 --> 37:53.420
I saw like a Facebook post or something where she's like Vetra is my waifu forever heart

37:53.420 --> 37:55.880
heart heart XOXO starry eyes.

37:55.880 --> 37:56.880
I'm like Desu Desu?

37:56.880 --> 37:57.880
What?

37:57.880 --> 37:58.880
It wasn't like that.

37:58.880 --> 38:02.020
I did a meme on Lol Effect.

38:02.020 --> 38:03.020
Future space waifu.

38:03.020 --> 38:04.020
I see.

38:04.020 --> 38:08.020
Although I am going for Jahl this time around because I don't like the way that my writer

38:08.020 --> 38:09.020
looks.

38:09.020 --> 38:11.740
He gets the less than perfect one and Vetra gets the perfect one.

38:11.740 --> 38:12.740
I love Jahl.

38:12.740 --> 38:13.740
I love Jahl.

38:13.740 --> 38:14.740
I love Jahl.

38:14.740 --> 38:15.740
I love Jahl.

38:15.740 --> 38:16.740
I love Jahl.

38:16.740 --> 38:17.740
I love Jahl.

38:17.740 --> 38:18.740
I love Jahl.

38:18.740 --> 38:19.740
Oh yeah.

38:19.740 --> 38:20.740
His voice purrs.

38:20.740 --> 38:21.740
Yeah.

38:21.740 --> 38:22.740
I there's like this big movement out there to like make Jahl.

38:22.740 --> 38:25.780
Well, I mean, you can't make anyone bisexual, but it is a video game, but let the dudes

38:25.780 --> 38:30.060
romance Jahl too, because to be fair, gay dudes have never got to bang an alien.

38:30.060 --> 38:33.100
Like that's the one thing that the series has robbed us of is we haven't gotten to bang

38:33.100 --> 38:34.100
an alien yet.

38:34.100 --> 38:38.420
Although I don't think Asari count because Asari are technically monogendered.

38:38.820 --> 38:39.820
True.

38:39.820 --> 38:44.460
But this is also though, this is the first game that you get to bang an alien that's

38:44.460 --> 38:49.540
not an Asari for, for a same sex pairing because you get Vetra.

38:49.540 --> 38:50.540
Yep.

38:50.540 --> 38:53.660
So, and um, one of the Angara as well, right?

38:53.660 --> 38:54.660
No.

38:54.660 --> 38:55.660
Oh, that's only heterosexual.

38:55.660 --> 38:56.660
Yeah.

38:56.660 --> 38:59.500
The, um, the Avalla who is the curator of the museum.

38:59.500 --> 39:00.500
Okay.

39:00.500 --> 39:01.500
She's the dude option.

39:01.500 --> 39:02.500
Okay.

39:02.500 --> 39:03.500
Okay.

39:03.500 --> 39:04.500
Anyway though, back to the game itself.

39:04.500 --> 39:05.500
I get motion sick.

39:05.740 --> 39:10.660
It actually crashed my old graphics card, like hardcore.

39:10.660 --> 39:13.260
I'm laughing because I know the punchline to this.

39:13.260 --> 39:15.260
So I bought a new one.

39:15.260 --> 39:18.020
More like, more like Dan bought a new one.

39:18.020 --> 39:23.140
It's like, okay, I go into the room to go, you know, I fuss about my card, reboot the

39:23.140 --> 39:24.140
game.

39:24.140 --> 39:25.420
I go into the bedroom to kiss Dan.

39:25.420 --> 39:26.420
Good night.

39:26.420 --> 39:29.020
And then he's like, by the way, your card will be here tomorrow.

39:29.020 --> 39:30.420
What?

39:30.420 --> 39:34.020
So I got, we got a GTX 1060.

39:34.020 --> 39:35.020
So good card.

39:35.540 --> 39:37.180
Not the best, but pretty good.

39:37.180 --> 39:38.180
That's really good.

39:38.180 --> 39:39.180
Yeah.

39:39.180 --> 39:40.180
That's what I have that.

39:40.180 --> 39:41.180
Yeah.

39:41.180 --> 39:42.180
That's good.

39:42.180 --> 39:45.660
And I've been able to bump up all my settings and I actually did pop into wow for a little

39:45.660 --> 39:46.660
bit too.

39:46.660 --> 39:47.660
And it looks really nice.

39:47.660 --> 39:48.660
So.

39:48.660 --> 39:49.660
I have a somewhat similar story.

39:49.660 --> 39:53.580
Just real quick aside is that, um, I actually wrote a tweet earlier this week where I said

39:53.580 --> 39:58.460
something like, uh, I really want to hurry up and beat a mass effect Andromeda on PlayStation

39:58.460 --> 39:59.460
four.

39:59.460 --> 40:02.300
I kind of want to get it on PC though, so I can play multiplayer with my husband, but

40:02.300 --> 40:04.660
I don't want to do it until I beat cause cause Alan's on PC.

40:04.700 --> 40:06.780
I don't want to do it till I beat the PlayStation four version.

40:06.780 --> 40:14.820
The next day you've received a gift on origin from Alan note, troll, lol, lol, lol, lol.

40:14.820 --> 40:18.860
The one thing I'm mad about is cause I ordered it, I ordered mine through Amazon so I could

40:18.860 --> 40:23.340
get the 20% off pre-order and they didn't have the deluxe one on there to pre-order.

40:23.340 --> 40:26.160
So I'm going to have to buy it again when it goes on sale.

40:26.160 --> 40:33.140
So I can get the other outfits and, uh, a pie Jack pet, AKA the monkey, then have all

40:33.140 --> 40:34.140
the stuff.

40:34.140 --> 40:38.260
So for those keeping track at home, I am now up to two copies of mass effect Andromeda

40:38.260 --> 40:41.260
thanks to husbando.

40:41.260 --> 40:43.140
So and the troll, lol, lol, lol.

40:43.140 --> 40:48.580
So if now I just have to get a copy on Xbox one and I'll complete the trifecta for now.

40:48.580 --> 40:51.940
So just, just for y'all keeping tabs at home, Rob's already up to two copies of mass effect

40:51.940 --> 40:52.940
Andromeda.

40:52.940 --> 40:54.620
Back to the actual review of the game.

40:54.620 --> 40:55.620
Yes.

40:55.620 --> 40:56.620
Okay.

40:56.620 --> 40:58.580
And this is coming from me with some of my weird depth perception issues.

40:58.580 --> 41:04.860
I do get motion sick on it whenever, um, I accelerate in the nomad, which by the way,

41:04.860 --> 41:07.660
nomad much, much, much, much, much better than the Mako.

41:07.660 --> 41:08.660
Oh yes.

41:08.660 --> 41:10.660
Anything is better than the hammerhead.

41:10.660 --> 41:17.960
Um, actually ATV mode for me is a lot easier than the non ATV mode because it's not moving

41:17.960 --> 41:25.120
as fast, but boosting and jumping and normally jumping with the character too, because it

41:25.120 --> 41:27.220
makes the screen jostle a little bit.

41:27.220 --> 41:28.220
Yeah.

41:28.860 --> 41:29.860
It, it will make me super motion sick.

41:29.860 --> 41:33.360
So if I'm stuck in the nomad for a long time, I'll get motion sick.

41:33.360 --> 41:38.920
So as for the animation issue, I, yeah, I did run into some of the dialogue problems

41:38.920 --> 41:39.920
from the get-go.

41:39.920 --> 41:47.360
Um, there's still a few glitchy things like one time, like it was in the, uh, the, the

41:47.360 --> 41:54.020
cat ship part where you're talking the smuggler thing and the ship is turned upside down and

41:54.020 --> 41:57.380
then it rotates and that made me so sick.

41:57.380 --> 42:05.280
They got all, uh, mode seven on you from like super Nintendo that whole thing made

42:05.280 --> 42:07.220
me so sick.

42:07.220 --> 42:11.000
But there was this one thing where you're hearing the people talk on the speaker and

42:11.000 --> 42:14.520
I swear my writer's head did the fucking owl thing.

42:14.520 --> 42:20.920
She was looking right behind her head and I'm like, girl, so I screenshot that one cause

42:20.920 --> 42:22.640
that's going to be a meme someday.

42:22.640 --> 42:27.160
Um, but the story has been really good.

42:27.160 --> 42:32.820
It had a kind of a slow buildup once you get into the meat of it, especially when you

42:32.820 --> 42:37.020
deal with the Angara and I, and this is just a little thing for me.

42:37.020 --> 42:40.420
This is actually why I liked fucking avatar of all things.

42:40.420 --> 42:45.220
I like when you were presented with an alien race and they already have an established

42:45.220 --> 42:52.080
culture, not just, Oh, here's this people and they kind of do this thing.

42:52.080 --> 42:59.980
I like that their whole mythology has been built up, that their way of life has been

42:59.980 --> 43:05.580
built up, that they are an established entity by the time you meet them instead of, Oh,

43:05.580 --> 43:06.960
let's just put these people here.

43:06.960 --> 43:07.960
Like in some games.

43:07.960 --> 43:08.960
Yeah.

43:08.960 --> 43:10.220
And Star Trek was always really good about this too.

43:10.220 --> 43:12.020
Star Trek was always really good about that.

43:12.020 --> 43:16.140
But I mean, that's the thing that really, I think is a mark of a good science fiction

43:16.140 --> 43:18.500
if it's going to have aliens in it.

43:18.500 --> 43:21.340
The aliens have to be established.

43:21.340 --> 43:25.800
I really think that 10 hour preview was the worst thing EA could have done for the game.

43:25.800 --> 43:30.320
I like looking back a little bit, especially about some of the tweets that came out about

43:30.320 --> 43:35.680
it and so forth, because there is a slow buildup, not in the game, but when we say slow buildup,

43:35.680 --> 43:39.920
I know the first thing everybody's going to say is like, well, Final Fantasy 13, it's

43:39.920 --> 43:40.920
different.

43:40.920 --> 43:43.980
When I say a slow buildup, I don't mean a slow buildup in the sense of the gameplay

43:43.980 --> 43:44.980
or anything like that.

43:44.980 --> 43:50.000
It's just the story takes a little bit of time before it really gets going, which if

43:50.020 --> 43:54.280
you're coming off of a game like Mass Effect 3, where the first fucking thing that happens

43:54.280 --> 43:58.640
in Mass Effect 3 is the town that you're in is getting shot the fuck up by Reapers, so

43:58.640 --> 43:59.640
you hit the ground running.

43:59.640 --> 44:02.820
Did they expect when you're playing 3 that you have already played the other series because

44:02.820 --> 44:04.380
the first Mass Effect?

44:04.380 --> 44:05.380
Right.

44:05.380 --> 44:07.180
It was also a slow build up in a ways.

44:07.180 --> 44:08.180
Yes it was.

44:08.180 --> 44:12.580
It did jump you into the action right away, but you had no fucking clue what was going

44:12.580 --> 44:14.560
on or what you were walking into.

44:14.560 --> 44:19.300
And then you get introduced to the rest of the galaxy, you know, along with everything

44:19.300 --> 44:20.300
else.

44:20.300 --> 44:25.100
And I think that, I honestly think, and this goes back to another video I saw complaining

44:25.100 --> 44:31.940
about how most, you see a lot of movies that are supposed to be like a not sequel, but

44:31.940 --> 44:35.260
a re-imaging, even though they're in the series.

44:35.260 --> 44:39.060
I kind of think that this one's trying to recapture the things that worked from the

44:39.060 --> 44:44.960
first Mass Effect and took the gameplay aspects from the other Mass Effect games that did

44:44.960 --> 44:45.960
work.

44:45.960 --> 44:51.880
And so I think that it was a valiant effort and I truly do believe that it's paid off.

44:51.880 --> 44:56.340
And as far as just visually, you know, now I am playing it as high as I can play it,

44:56.340 --> 44:59.780
it's really, really, really fucking pretty.

44:59.780 --> 45:03.800
It looks great on PC, now that I can say that.

45:03.800 --> 45:07.800
Right now, well actually I left that planet, I went back to Eos.

45:08.340 --> 45:13.780
I was on Havarl, which is one of the Angara planets.

45:13.780 --> 45:18.240
And it's all this wildlife and overgrown.

45:18.240 --> 45:19.240
That planet is gorgeous, yeah.

45:19.240 --> 45:20.240
I've been there too.

45:20.240 --> 45:21.840
That planet is gorgeous.

45:21.840 --> 45:29.180
And the thing though is that it felt like walking through a heavily wooded area, especially

45:29.180 --> 45:34.180
when you've got bugs that are hiding in the plants and, you know, things that can pop

45:34.180 --> 45:35.180
just out of the trees.

45:35.400 --> 45:43.040
If you've ever been in a dense forest or jungle situation or even in a swamp, which I have,

45:43.040 --> 45:46.180
it's kind of like that though, where someone can just come right out of nowhere.

45:46.180 --> 45:48.440
And so you get a little bit of suspense to it too.

45:48.440 --> 45:49.440
You'll hear the sounds.

45:49.440 --> 45:53.040
You always get an indicator of where enemies are showing up, but you still get those sounds

45:53.040 --> 45:55.640
like what's shooting at me, where is it?

45:55.640 --> 45:59.640
You know what else is really gorgeous is those vaults that you go into and especially again,

45:59.640 --> 46:05.040
I don't want to spoiler, but the first escape sequence from a vault, that was a really

46:05.100 --> 46:06.100
impressive sequence.

46:06.100 --> 46:07.100
Oh my goodness.

46:07.100 --> 46:08.100
Yes.

46:08.100 --> 46:12.540
There's you see some of it in a trailer, so it's not really spoilery, but still to actually

46:12.540 --> 46:18.540
play through that, like not only was it graphically, like really the demo, the vault was the demo

46:18.540 --> 46:19.540
that they did before.

46:19.540 --> 46:20.540
Oh yes, it was.

46:20.540 --> 46:21.540
It was.

46:21.540 --> 46:23.180
But did they do the escape sequence part of that?

46:23.180 --> 46:26.340
No, they did the getting into it, but the whole area was the demo.

46:26.340 --> 46:27.340
Yeah.

46:27.340 --> 46:28.340
No, no.

46:28.340 --> 46:30.640
I remember that the vault was that demo they did in the early YouTube, but the escape sequence

46:30.640 --> 46:31.640
was right.

46:31.640 --> 46:35.820
I think that was the moment or what the game really started to kick into.

46:35.820 --> 46:41.060
Which is funny because that's where they cut it off at the end of the day in the time demo.

46:41.060 --> 46:48.860
It's like seriously, so like for real, yeah, so, but yeah, absolute kudos to Mass Effect

46:48.860 --> 46:50.860
Inquisition because that's what it feels like.

46:50.860 --> 46:51.860
Yeah.

46:51.860 --> 46:59.900
Now here's the other thing too is that every day I go and check Nexus mods because you

46:59.900 --> 47:04.200
know it didn't take too long for them to have cracked the stuff for Dragon Age to do

47:04.200 --> 47:05.200
those mods.

47:05.200 --> 47:06.200
No, they didn't.

47:06.200 --> 47:07.200
Nope.

47:07.200 --> 47:10.120
And my biggest complaint is still the character creation.

47:10.120 --> 47:16.860
They could have done exactly what Dragon Age did and have this fully tweakable customizable,

47:16.860 --> 47:21.440
you know, where you pull X axis and Y axis to make things a certain size or to make it

47:21.440 --> 47:26.680
move, but they had all these really terrible presets.

47:26.680 --> 47:29.440
Even the guy presets were pretty terrible.

47:29.440 --> 47:35.260
But they just like were dead set that if you don't play the default, you might be stuck

47:35.260 --> 47:40.400
with a very, very homely looking character.

47:40.400 --> 47:43.640
Can I ask a question about that?

47:43.640 --> 47:48.360
And I want to get both of your opinions on this because there was some feedback based

47:48.360 --> 47:55.500
on that character creation where some, again, this is just, you know, you take the internet

47:55.500 --> 47:56.500
with a grain of salt.

47:56.500 --> 48:01.360
But, you know, I found this particular argument a very striking argument.

48:01.360 --> 48:08.860
The argument was that the reason for the character creation was so limited, if you will, was,

48:08.860 --> 48:17.140
you know, because they said BioWare did that to prevent any sort of or minimize any sort

48:17.140 --> 48:24.420
of backlash on any character that you can create that's too sexy, too pretty.

48:24.420 --> 48:29.260
And I would love to know, I mean, I laughed when I saw that, but, you know, because, you

48:29.260 --> 48:34.360
know, again, BioWare, you know, has been under this massive spotlight ever since the ending

48:34.360 --> 48:35.360
of 3, as you mentioned earlier.

48:35.360 --> 48:36.360
You get to cop out.

48:36.360 --> 48:37.360
Yeah.

48:37.360 --> 48:38.820
And I'll tell you why.

48:38.820 --> 48:42.100
Because of Dad Writer.

48:42.100 --> 48:52.060
He takes after the traits based on what physical traits, which of the basic presets that you

48:52.060 --> 49:00.540
choose and modify, his ethnicity and eye color and some of his other physical traits

49:00.540 --> 49:03.220
take directly from the choices that you pick in the character creator.

49:03.220 --> 49:06.180
I think Dad Writer's the reason it's so limited.

49:06.180 --> 49:07.820
That's my theory, too.

49:07.820 --> 49:13.400
However, I think that maybe you should have the option of choosing an ethnicity preset

49:13.400 --> 49:17.740
and then being able, instead of just having just the straight bar across, you can tweak

49:17.740 --> 49:19.220
it in better ways.

49:19.220 --> 49:20.220
And let's be real.

49:20.220 --> 49:23.620
If you want to play writer with the biggest breasts in the galaxy, a modder is going to

49:23.620 --> 49:25.400
bring that to you sooner rather than later.

49:25.400 --> 49:31.300
So of course, if not already, ever was for Mass Effect 3 that made Shepard look a little

49:31.300 --> 49:36.820
Lady Shepard look a little bit more buff because she's a fucking space marine.

49:36.820 --> 49:41.940
Jamie's also one of those people where Lady Shepard is the only Shepard.

49:41.940 --> 49:42.940
She was the first Shepard.

49:42.940 --> 49:43.940
Remember that?

49:43.940 --> 49:45.940
Dem Shep came first.

49:45.940 --> 49:46.940
All right.

49:46.940 --> 49:47.940
Anyway.

49:47.940 --> 49:48.940
Awesome.

49:48.940 --> 49:54.100
Quickly though, Gabe, since you've been playing as well, what are your thoughts on the game?

49:54.100 --> 49:58.220
I agree with reference to the pacing of it.

49:58.220 --> 50:00.540
And fortunately, I understood.

50:00.540 --> 50:06.860
I came into this with the understanding of they're not going to relate at all to the

50:06.860 --> 50:11.180
previous Mass Effect 3 games, even though they already have in a couple little tiny

50:11.180 --> 50:12.180
ways, which is nice.

50:12.180 --> 50:13.660
I mean, I think it's cool.

50:13.660 --> 50:20.340
I too feel like there was a bit of a slow buildup with it.

50:20.340 --> 50:24.180
But I think in this size of a game, you want to do that.

50:24.180 --> 50:26.860
And I think it was still executed well.

50:26.860 --> 50:29.480
I don't think it was executed perfectly.

50:29.480 --> 50:30.620
Nothing ever necessarily is.

50:30.620 --> 50:35.060
I mean, I think it could have been done a little bit better, but it's definitely not

50:35.060 --> 50:40.900
the worst pacing issues I've ever seen when introducing a new universe.

50:40.900 --> 50:48.780
As you mentioned, with that first vault, you first land on Eos and you start...

50:48.780 --> 50:54.140
I already got that feeling like, oh my goodness, I remember how awesome it felt to explore

50:54.140 --> 50:55.540
the planets.

50:55.540 --> 51:01.460
And Eos just gave me that feeling, and graphically, even on Xbox One, it's just astounding.

51:01.460 --> 51:04.060
So that's what I play it on.

51:04.060 --> 51:10.340
But yeah, as you explored around and did your thing, very hard to stay focused on the amount

51:10.340 --> 51:13.380
of crap that you have to do.

51:13.380 --> 51:15.500
And that's something that turned me...

51:15.500 --> 51:21.940
I don't want to say it turned me off, but it took me aback a little bit because I love

51:21.940 --> 51:26.180
those games, Dragon Age, Inquisition, my favorite of all the Dragon Age games, all the three

51:26.180 --> 51:30.460
Mass Effect's fantastic, but this new Mass Effect felt overwhelming.

51:30.460 --> 51:33.060
It is what is slowing me down the most.

51:33.060 --> 51:35.620
I shouldn't have that fucking game beat by now.

51:35.620 --> 51:37.500
I feel like I have barely progressed.

51:37.500 --> 51:42.940
And it's because all the worst elements of my gamer ADD kick in when it's like, I got

51:42.940 --> 51:46.820
to go do this quest, but there's a shiny over here, but I got to scan this thing over there,

51:46.820 --> 51:51.220
but there's a vault I got to do and a Sudoku puzzle.

51:51.220 --> 51:52.900
It's totally Sudoku, isn't it?

51:52.900 --> 51:53.900
It's totally Sudoku.

51:53.900 --> 51:58.740
But I'll tell you what though, I have super loved all the distractions because you're

51:58.740 --> 52:01.660
not necessarily timed on events in the game.

52:01.660 --> 52:02.660
Thank goodness.

52:02.660 --> 52:07.180
I didn't finish Eos, but I'm glad that I waited to finish Eos because when I came back, there

52:07.180 --> 52:08.180
was more to do.

52:08.180 --> 52:09.180
Yes.

52:09.180 --> 52:12.900
And there was even, I had left it like a 75% viability.

52:12.900 --> 52:16.900
Now I finished Vold, so I'd never have to fucking go there again.

52:16.900 --> 52:21.900
That world has been- I hate Vold because it's cold.

52:21.900 --> 52:26.380
Angry, angry, angry hoth is what- It's angry hoth.

52:26.380 --> 52:27.380
That's exactly it.

52:27.380 --> 52:35.260
And the mountain, I have driven my nomad over a mountain, over the mountain, that was kind

52:35.260 --> 52:36.900
of fun.

52:37.620 --> 52:39.620
Calamity Jamie makes her own fucking path.

52:39.620 --> 52:40.620
Exactly.

52:40.620 --> 52:44.980
Well, it's not like it wasn't the first Mass Effect where you were literally driving vertically.

52:44.980 --> 52:46.780
Yeah, right.

52:46.780 --> 52:52.260
So one problem is though, is that I have this series of memes on Mass Effecting.

52:52.260 --> 52:54.460
It's called Shepherds Bad Driving.

52:54.460 --> 52:59.260
And I'm starting a new one with- Well, you know, women drivers.

52:59.260 --> 53:00.260
Hey.

53:00.260 --> 53:04.220
She left the door wide fucking open.

53:04.220 --> 53:06.220
Hit the shade button.

53:06.220 --> 53:07.220
So anyway.

53:07.220 --> 53:10.300
The following comments are not necessarily of the internet.

53:10.300 --> 53:14.460
I'm going to be doing a sequel to that called Sarah's Nightmare Driving.

53:14.460 --> 53:21.340
But it's hard to get the nomad in one of those weird positions like you could with the Mako.

53:21.340 --> 53:25.500
So I'm having a really hard time for my blog.

53:25.500 --> 53:29.380
But I did drive it completely over a mountain and that was pretty fun.

53:29.380 --> 53:32.500
But the game- Climb every mountain.

53:32.500 --> 53:35.460
The game overall is absolutely, I think it's an absolutely beautiful game and I'm looking

53:35.460 --> 53:38.560
really forward to what comes next.

53:38.560 --> 53:42.820
And I'm just happy to see some smartassery from the Krogan again.

53:42.820 --> 53:43.820
That's great.

53:43.820 --> 53:44.820
All right.

53:44.820 --> 53:48.460
I got to move on past what Ziba and Chad is calling Orange Lounge Mass Effect Radio.

53:48.460 --> 53:53.900
But hey, look, we've been waiting five years, five long years.

53:53.900 --> 53:54.900
Jack is officially my new grandpa.

53:54.900 --> 53:57.140
So you know, it's going to happen a little bit.

53:57.140 --> 53:58.140
All right.

53:58.140 --> 53:59.340
But let's talk about some other games as well.

53:59.340 --> 54:02.020
We need to get into our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we've been playing

54:02.020 --> 54:05.540
this week besides Mass Effect, if there have been any.

54:05.540 --> 54:06.780
Dark Soccer, I'll check in with you first.

54:06.780 --> 54:08.780
How was your gaming week?

54:08.780 --> 54:10.540
Well, Mass Effect.

54:10.540 --> 54:15.020
I also played a little bit of World of Warcraft, basically just long enough to download the

54:15.020 --> 54:18.260
Tomb of Sargeras patch and see what my new card looks like.

54:18.260 --> 54:20.780
It's pretty.

54:20.780 --> 54:25.380
I have been- because I don't even know what it is, but I'm kind of getting back into some

54:25.380 --> 54:28.460
of my cell phone gaming.

54:28.460 --> 54:33.820
So I've been playing Bejeweled Stars, which is kind of stupid, but a fun little challenge.

54:33.820 --> 54:34.820
Lots of Bust-A-Move.

54:34.820 --> 54:39.020
Like I'm on Bust-A-Move marathon mode like you wouldn't believe.

54:39.020 --> 54:42.700
My puzzle bobble, that's it.

54:42.700 --> 54:45.540
And Pokemon Go, a bit here and there.

54:45.540 --> 54:49.340
I evolved a whole bunch of stuff last week that was pretty fun.

54:49.340 --> 54:50.340
Still doing Miitomo.

54:50.340 --> 54:54.820
I don't really consider that a game, but it's kind of like fun dress up.

54:54.820 --> 55:02.940
They just had these outfits that are all totally Tron-like, and it was pretty awesome.

55:02.940 --> 55:06.660
And I guess really- oh yeah, Dan got Bomberman Zero.

55:06.660 --> 55:07.660
Not Bomberman.

55:07.660 --> 55:08.660
Blaster Master.

55:08.660 --> 55:10.460
I'm sorry to hear it.

55:10.460 --> 55:11.460
Oh, Blaster Master.

55:11.460 --> 55:12.460
Blaster Master?

55:12.460 --> 55:13.460
I said Bomberman.

55:13.460 --> 55:14.460
Blaster Master.

55:14.460 --> 55:15.460
He finished it.

55:15.460 --> 55:16.460
The real ending.

55:16.460 --> 55:17.460
Oh yeah?

55:17.460 --> 55:18.460
He really likes it.

55:18.460 --> 55:19.460
Yeah.

55:19.460 --> 55:21.780
I think it's a- there was a smart time to put something like that out.

55:21.780 --> 55:24.300
It doesn't really get lost in other Switch titles.

55:24.300 --> 55:27.620
The only thing it's really competing against is Zelda, you know?

55:27.620 --> 55:28.620
And Binding of Isaac.

55:28.620 --> 55:29.620
Yeah, you know.

55:29.620 --> 55:32.620
And so I think there's a lot of room for that game to really-

55:32.620 --> 55:33.620
We got this on DS.

55:33.620 --> 55:34.620
3DS.

55:34.620 --> 55:35.620
Oh, okay.

55:35.620 --> 55:36.620
Yeah.

55:36.620 --> 55:37.620
And it was just fine.

55:37.620 --> 55:38.980
He really, really seemed to enjoy it.

55:38.980 --> 55:42.060
And then we did finish Breath of the Wild.

55:42.060 --> 55:47.540
And then, you know, I am disappointed because I would have liked for there to be like kind

55:47.540 --> 55:51.860
of a second quest, except your second quest is to rebuild Hyrule.

55:51.860 --> 55:53.900
But it's still a great game.

55:53.900 --> 55:57.180
The true ending, I admit I got a little sniffly.

55:57.180 --> 55:58.620
It was really great.

55:58.620 --> 56:04.060
And I think for all of us who have for years done the Link Zelda ship, it has finally paid

56:04.060 --> 56:05.060
off.

56:05.060 --> 56:06.940
Okay, spoiler alert.

56:06.940 --> 56:07.940
I didn't say-

56:07.940 --> 56:08.940
I haven't beaten- I haven't beaten yet.

56:08.940 --> 56:09.940
That's all.

56:09.940 --> 56:10.940
There's nothing-

56:10.940 --> 56:11.940
I didn't-

56:11.940 --> 56:12.940
All right, all right.

56:12.940 --> 56:15.220
That didn't spoil anything if you've ever looked at any of the memories.

56:15.220 --> 56:17.220
Zelda's a princess?

56:17.220 --> 56:18.220
What?

56:18.220 --> 56:19.220
Fair enough.

56:19.220 --> 56:20.220
All right.

56:20.220 --> 56:21.220
Anything else for game week?

56:21.220 --> 56:23.660
Um, no.

56:24.100 --> 56:25.380
Let's check in with our guests.

56:25.380 --> 56:29.020
Bree, I didn't get to hear from you during that whole Mass Effect thing.

56:29.020 --> 56:30.900
I'm assuming you kind of sat that one out.

56:30.900 --> 56:32.580
But what video games have you been just playing?

56:32.580 --> 56:34.460
Oh, I have opinions on Mass Effect.

56:34.460 --> 56:35.460
Do you?

56:35.460 --> 56:36.460
Oh, please.

56:36.460 --> 56:37.460
The chat room's not gonna like it.

56:37.460 --> 56:38.460
Go for it.

56:38.460 --> 56:39.460
Put them on blast.

56:39.460 --> 56:47.240
I have chosen to block any conversation in my timelines regarding Mass Effect Andromeda.

56:47.240 --> 56:51.660
There are certain aspects that this casual gamer does not agree with that are incorporated

56:51.660 --> 56:52.660
in that game.

56:52.660 --> 56:53.660
Ooh, what though?

56:53.660 --> 56:54.980
I want to know.

56:54.980 --> 56:56.860
That's for another show, my friend.

56:56.860 --> 56:58.980
Oh, that's a nasty tease.

56:58.980 --> 57:00.700
That is a nasty, nasty tease.

57:00.700 --> 57:01.700
All right.

57:01.700 --> 57:06.900
The whole sexual relations part is something I do not agree with.

57:06.900 --> 57:07.900
Okay.

57:07.900 --> 57:11.780
But again, if you'd like to have me back when we're not promoting SAC India Arcade, I'd be

57:11.780 --> 57:14.060
happy to discuss that with your people.

57:14.060 --> 57:15.060
We're gonna talk about-

57:15.060 --> 57:17.260
We'll talk about alien banging on another episode.

57:17.260 --> 57:18.260
Yes.

57:18.260 --> 57:21.020
And maybe you can help me understand that.

57:21.020 --> 57:22.860
I'll give you the short version.

57:22.860 --> 57:26.540
It's in movies for a reason.

57:26.540 --> 57:27.540
That's the short version.

57:27.540 --> 57:28.860
We can get into it another time.

57:28.860 --> 57:29.860
Yes.

57:29.860 --> 57:30.860
All right.

57:30.860 --> 57:35.420
So I will say you do have the ability to continue the relationship without the banging for some

57:35.420 --> 57:36.420
of them.

57:36.420 --> 57:41.780
And if you want to be completely non, not do any of it, you don't have to romance anybody.

57:41.780 --> 57:42.780
Exactly.

57:42.780 --> 57:47.860
And so I'll preface my next appearance on your show with when does it become crossing

57:47.860 --> 57:52.740
the line in relationships when you're engaging in that kind of romance or hinting at it with

57:52.740 --> 57:53.740
another player?

57:53.740 --> 57:54.740
Oh, interesting.

57:54.740 --> 57:55.740
All right.

57:55.740 --> 57:56.740
We'll leave it at that.

57:56.740 --> 57:57.740
We'll leave it at that for now.

57:57.740 --> 57:59.380
I think that could be a fascinating topic for-

57:59.380 --> 58:00.780
The chat room's going to go nuts.

58:00.780 --> 58:01.780
But on this topic-

58:01.780 --> 58:05.140
No, they're going to be like, finally, someone's pushing their buttons on Mass Effect.

58:05.140 --> 58:11.620
They're going to be- Bobby's getting out of pinata right now.

58:11.620 --> 58:17.780
Now he's really going to show up expecting his fast pass to the event.

58:17.780 --> 58:21.420
But I was so excited to talk about this topic because I think the last time I was on the

58:21.420 --> 58:27.420
show was like two years ago and I was still very infantile in my game playing world.

58:27.420 --> 58:29.260
But now are you sitting?

58:29.260 --> 58:30.380
Is everybody sitting?

58:30.380 --> 58:33.140
I have completed two games all by myself.

58:33.140 --> 58:34.140
Good job.

58:34.140 --> 58:36.380
Because I finally made time to do so.

58:36.380 --> 58:38.620
I know this because you've been live streaming some of them too.

58:38.620 --> 58:39.620
Yes.

58:39.620 --> 58:40.620
And you've been hosting me.

58:40.620 --> 58:41.620
So thank you.

58:41.620 --> 58:42.620
I'm just happy to.

58:42.620 --> 58:43.620
Happy to.

58:43.620 --> 58:45.300
So I'm going to encompass my whole two years.

58:45.300 --> 58:46.980
I finally beat Wolf Among Us.

58:46.980 --> 58:48.700
I started it and played it.

58:48.700 --> 58:49.700
I loved it.

58:49.700 --> 58:51.300
I played Life is Strange.

58:51.300 --> 58:54.540
I started Unravel.

58:54.540 --> 58:58.540
And I started- I feel so childish on this.

58:58.540 --> 58:59.540
Why?

58:59.540 --> 59:02.300
Do you know how much good stuff I've heard about Life is Strange?

59:02.300 --> 59:05.260
And I actually watched like, I don't remember what was going on.

59:05.260 --> 59:10.740
I was up at like 2am on a Friday night a few weeks ago and like, I just was like, well,

59:10.740 --> 59:11.740
what's going on on Twitch?

59:11.740 --> 59:15.380
Like, I feel like I should have been high or something, but I don't do that.

59:15.380 --> 59:16.460
I don't do any of that stuff.

59:16.460 --> 59:18.900
But like, I felt like still it was like one of those nights.

59:18.900 --> 59:23.220
And so at 2am on a Friday, I'm there on Twitch and like Bree's streaming Life is Strange.

59:23.220 --> 59:24.940
She's got Insomnia going on too.

59:24.940 --> 59:26.580
So I was actually watching for like a good hour.

59:26.580 --> 59:27.580
Oh, that was you.

59:27.580 --> 59:28.580
That was me.

59:28.580 --> 59:31.420
How come you didn't say hi?

59:31.420 --> 59:32.420
Usually I'm watching on PlayStation.

59:32.420 --> 59:33.420
I don't have a keyboard.

59:33.420 --> 59:35.580
I can, I can kind of do it.

59:35.580 --> 59:36.580
That's fine.

59:36.580 --> 59:39.940
But yeah, I grew so attached to those characters and I was going through some stuff at the

59:39.940 --> 59:41.780
time I was playing that game.

59:41.780 --> 59:46.180
And now that it's over, I finally understand why people played that game multiple times

59:46.220 --> 59:48.860
because there's so many different ways you could go about it.

59:48.860 --> 59:52.380
So I made some new friends when I was streaming online with that.

59:52.380 --> 59:55.100
And that was cool because there were some parts where I got stuck.

59:55.100 --> 59:59.060
But when I first started that game in the fall, I know everybody, please don't give

59:59.060 --> 01:00:00.860
me grief in the chat room.

01:00:00.860 --> 01:00:03.220
It took me like nine months to finish that game.

01:00:03.220 --> 01:00:04.380
They can fight me.

01:00:04.380 --> 01:00:07.100
Do you know how long it takes me to finish any game?

01:00:07.100 --> 01:00:12.100
But there was some heavy shit in that game that my heart just was not ready to address

01:00:12.100 --> 01:00:13.100
at that point.

01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:17.620
Yeah, I've heard, I've heard Life is Strange is, is really resonates with people.

01:00:17.620 --> 01:00:18.620
Yeah.

01:00:18.620 --> 01:00:21.060
So, but I loved it and I'm trying to keep it light.

01:00:21.060 --> 01:00:25.060
I downloaded Dear Esther on my Xbox.

01:00:25.060 --> 01:00:27.180
Why are indie titles so serious?

01:00:27.180 --> 01:00:28.180
Some of them.

01:00:28.180 --> 01:00:29.180
I just picked that up for Mac.

01:00:29.180 --> 01:00:30.180
Yeah.

01:00:30.180 --> 01:00:33.100
Dear Esther is really, cause they just did the remaster just came out.

01:00:33.100 --> 01:00:35.820
If you do enjoy Dear Esther, you must play.

01:00:35.820 --> 01:00:36.820
Everybody's gone to the rapture.

01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:37.820
Oh, okay.

01:00:37.820 --> 01:00:42.940
You, oh, I, that game like still resonates with me to this day and it doesn't, it doesn't

01:00:42.940 --> 01:00:46.420
affect everybody the same way, but there's something about that game that is just so

01:00:46.420 --> 01:00:48.300
fucking beautiful.

01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:49.580
Like I can't, like I can't handle it.

01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:53.880
Like, and even playing Dear Esther, I was like, this isn't rapture.

01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:57.020
This isn't like, it's good, but it's not rapture.

01:00:57.020 --> 01:00:59.620
So it's, it's almost like they're going to get crushed by their own success.

01:00:59.620 --> 01:01:02.580
But that, that you, you definitely need to try.

01:01:02.580 --> 01:01:04.420
Everybody's gone to the rapture is so good.

01:01:04.420 --> 01:01:05.420
I will look into that.

01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:06.420
Thank you.

01:01:06.420 --> 01:01:07.420
You're welcome.

01:01:07.420 --> 01:01:08.420
Give me another two years.

01:01:08.420 --> 01:01:09.420
You got it.

01:01:09.420 --> 01:01:10.420
Take your time.

01:01:10.420 --> 01:01:11.420
Take your time.

01:01:11.420 --> 01:01:12.420
Don't let anybody rush you.

01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:16.700
The dog network.com free kill zero says, Oh, I finished unravel myself last week.

01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:18.820
That game had some major feels.

01:01:18.820 --> 01:01:23.780
So just warning unravel may not be the emotional break you were hoping for.

01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:25.060
It's the controls.

01:01:25.060 --> 01:01:29.260
I take too much time away from that game that by the time I get back to it, I forget how

01:01:29.260 --> 01:01:32.340
to swing and throw the rope and do that whole bit, but it's beautiful.

01:01:32.340 --> 01:01:33.340
I love it.

01:01:33.340 --> 01:01:34.340
Damn that music though.

01:01:34.340 --> 01:01:37.200
Cause some of the pieces like that's what keeps drawing me back.

01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:41.100
It's difficult for me, but that music, the music and rapture is what will do it.

01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:42.780
Oh my God.

01:01:42.780 --> 01:01:43.780
Oh my God.

01:01:43.780 --> 01:01:44.780
I'm like it.

01:01:44.780 --> 01:01:45.780
I'm getting chills.

01:01:45.780 --> 01:01:46.780
Just thinking about it.

01:01:46.780 --> 01:01:47.780
Um, ice, ice, pee, ICP.

01:01:47.780 --> 01:01:52.980
I don't know if, I don't know if it's ICP or ice pee in the chat room with the ICP clearly

01:01:52.980 --> 01:01:54.180
a reference to the insane clown.

01:01:54.180 --> 01:01:55.180
Of course.

01:01:55.180 --> 01:01:56.180
Just kidding.

01:01:56.180 --> 01:02:02.500
But anyway, ICP and chat says, if you like walking simulators, uh, I would suggest firewatch

01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:03.660
love that.

01:02:03.660 --> 01:02:05.300
I really enjoyed firewatch as well.

01:02:05.300 --> 01:02:06.300
Beat that game in one night.

01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:07.300
It went on sale.

01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:08.560
Beat that game in one night.

01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:09.560
That's another one I'd recommend.

01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:11.880
That should only take you a few hours to get through.

01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:17.800
Even, even if you look behind every nook and cranny, it's like maybe five hours tops tops.

01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:20.400
So that was really good too.

01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:24.320
Um, uh, I don't, I don't like the brand walking simulators.

01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:26.320
I'm just, that's not, no, no shade.

01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:28.580
I'm not going to bring out the shade button for the chatter because I realized that's

01:02:28.580 --> 01:02:31.320
kind of like what the internet has adopted as kind of the term.

01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:34.520
I'm not a fan of that term because I feel like that term is used sometimes to belittle

01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:38.640
those types of games because I just consider them more.

01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:41.980
They are very heavily narrative based games.

01:02:41.980 --> 01:02:45.920
They're very heavily on the story as opposed to the action.

01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:49.880
I feel, I feel it's a, it's a true definition of visual narrative.

01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:53.300
It's what, it's an interactive, it's an interactive visual narrative.

01:02:53.300 --> 01:02:54.300
It's what it is.

01:02:54.300 --> 01:02:59.760
You are, you are in the story and you are, you are following the story that, that, that

01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:04.920
the book, if you will, has presented instead of you finding out when you turn the page,

01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:07.080
you're going to find out when you turn the corner.

01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:10.240
And it's going to, and it, you know, and it's going to reveal all these little things.

01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:15.720
But yeah, I, I, I, as an indie developer, you know, like if we're, if we're going to,

01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:19.720
you know, if we're going to trounce made up genres and stuff like that, Metroidvania needs

01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:21.680
to stop, but I won't even go there.

01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:25.440
But like, you know, but yeah, the walking simulator thing, it, it shouldn't, it shouldn't

01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:28.800
demeanor or, you know, devalue, you know.

01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:29.800
Yeah.

01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:31.600
I'm not saying it to like shake my finger.

01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:32.600
Don't do that.

01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:38.280
I'm just saying, I'm like, I just, I feel like those games deserve a label that, you

01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:43.080
know, cause, cause honestly it's quickly becoming one of my favorite genre of games and, you

01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:44.080
know, okay.

01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:46.640
Is it because I'm old and I can't do action as much anymore?

01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:52.360
I don't know, but I just like, I get more out of those types of games.

01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:55.800
Like I, especially for somebody with my, my short attention span type of thing.

01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:58.860
And obviously Brie is a victim of this too, cause she's, she mentioned this too, it takes

01:03:58.860 --> 01:04:00.400
her a while to get through a game.

01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:05.520
Like these like four hour interactive adventures are perfect.

01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:06.520
You know what I mean?

01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:07.520
Like they're just like perfect stories.

01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:08.520
I don't know for me.

01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:10.000
That's how I feel anyway.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:15.120
I blame it on sack indie arcade for right now, but we'll sit in front of the TV.

01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:19.520
You clearly have every right to blame event planning for why you don't play video games.

01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:22.980
Can I, I'm sorry, Brie, you were going to say, I want to piggyback off of Jamie though.

01:04:22.980 --> 01:04:27.560
I have started Pokemon go again because it's beautiful outside and I need to get my butt

01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:28.560
walking.

01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:31.400
I haven't gone to any gyms or battles yet.

01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:32.840
I don't know how to do that.

01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:34.280
So I haven't done any either.

01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:36.040
Can we do it together?

01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:40.980
You don't, you don't, you also don't have like, I think part of the beauty of that game,

01:04:40.980 --> 01:04:42.700
although that game has its flaws for sure.

01:04:42.700 --> 01:04:45.600
But part of the beauty of that game is that you don't have to do that at all.

01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:49.400
If you don't want, like there's tons of rewards to get from the game without ever touching

01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:52.720
that stuff, but you can, you can do it if you want.

01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:55.280
And it's, you do get other rewards for doing it.

01:04:55.280 --> 01:05:00.740
You do get the premium in game currency a little bit, you get that from doing the gyms,

01:05:00.740 --> 01:05:02.720
but I kind of think you can get a rich experience without it.

01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:06.440
Well, that's good to know that because here I am trying to like build up my Pokemon for

01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:08.060
something, but it's all for me.

01:05:08.060 --> 01:05:12.800
For me playing games with people is always more fun in real life, not necessarily online.

01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:13.800
Absolutely.

01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:14.800
Absolutely.

01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:17.800
Uh, JD wanted to back up a minute here and chat over at live.vognetwork.com saying I

01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:20.800
don't actually know what a walking simulator is.

01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:24.880
No, that's a fair question because it's kind of a newer genre of game.

01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:29.120
I would say the first big one, well, Dear Esther was probably actually the first big

01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:35.600
one, but Gone Home was probably the first really successful mainstream big one.

01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:40.120
And you may remember with Gone Home, Gone Home got shit from a lot of people because

01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:43.600
a lot of people were like, where's the game though?

01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:47.480
Like you're walking through this scary house and you think you, you think at some point

01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:50.080
like a ghost is going to jump out and chop off your head.

01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:56.240
And spoiler alert, that never happens because the game is actually not scare about scary

01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:57.240
things at all.

01:05:57.240 --> 01:05:58.240
Right?

01:05:58.240 --> 01:05:59.240
Absolutely.

01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:01.920
That game is, is really a masterpiece in a different way of like throwing like this curve

01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:05.340
ball at you that you think it's going to be this, this scary game.

01:06:05.340 --> 01:06:10.560
And then you find out it's actually like a different type of tragedy that's going on.

01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:13.560
That's very, in some ways it's kind of relatable.

01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:18.020
I mean, you know, I realized it's not an experience everybody's gone through, but I think that

01:06:18.020 --> 01:06:19.180
whole like teenage angst.

01:06:19.180 --> 01:06:21.700
I think everybody's felt teenage angst at some point.

01:06:21.700 --> 01:06:24.360
And there's a lot of that that you explore through the eyes of the character's sister

01:06:24.360 --> 01:06:25.360
in Gone Home.

01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:29.860
So anyway, I'm digressing a little bit, but my point is, is that they are more the games

01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:37.580
that are driven by the story and you are just this participant watching, not necessarily

01:06:37.580 --> 01:06:41.360
participating as if it were an action game or something.

01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:43.020
You're more of an observer.

01:06:43.020 --> 01:06:44.720
That's especially the case in Rapture.

01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:47.560
You are definitely an observer in that game.

01:06:48.540 --> 01:06:52.860
Even games with simple puzzle elements like Firewatch and things, you're still like just

01:06:52.860 --> 01:06:56.900
an observer who has to do things to see the whole picture.

01:06:56.900 --> 01:06:57.900
So I don't know.

01:06:57.900 --> 01:06:58.900
Absolutely.

01:06:58.900 --> 01:07:05.000
I think another game that got that, you know, that caught some heat, even though I think

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:09.420
the good obviously overpowered the bad was Journey, even though, you know, Journey, there

01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:15.500
are certain elements of Journey, you know, where it feels action-y, you don't necessarily

01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:19.840
do anything, but Journey caught a lot of heat for the same thing.

01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:23.480
I just paid $20 for a two hour game.

01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:24.480
Why?

01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:26.900
That's because it's the best damn two hours of your life.

01:07:26.900 --> 01:07:27.900
Damn straight.

01:07:27.900 --> 01:07:28.900
Damn straight.

01:07:28.900 --> 01:07:32.520
But that, Journey is an interesting example of something that kind of, because obviously

01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:34.080
genres blend.

01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:39.720
So Journey is kind of a blend of that narrative mixed with a Mario 64 type of game.

01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:40.720
Yeah, it is.

01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:41.720
It absolutely is.

01:07:41.720 --> 01:07:47.340
And, you know, with a lot more limitations, you know, all you have is limited jumps and

01:07:47.340 --> 01:07:48.340
not much else.

01:07:48.340 --> 01:07:50.860
Limited jumps and floats, so.

01:07:50.860 --> 01:07:54.980
Free Kill Zero says, I haven't played Gone Home, but isn't that Dragon Cancer in a similar

01:07:54.980 --> 01:07:55.980
vein?

01:07:55.980 --> 01:07:56.980
Oh.

01:07:56.980 --> 01:07:57.980
Yeah.

01:07:57.980 --> 01:08:02.060
I have not played that one start to finish yet because I keep waiting for that day where,

01:08:02.060 --> 01:08:07.540
like, do I have a 24 hour period where I can cry nonstop and not leave the house?

01:08:07.540 --> 01:08:08.540
No, I'm serious.

01:08:08.540 --> 01:08:09.540
I don't even know.

01:08:09.540 --> 01:08:15.520
Just everything I know about preparing me for this game is that, like, just, it's like

01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:20.880
that, I don't know for you guys, but for me, it's like, if Rob breaks out the Tori Amos

01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:25.680
CDs, like, it's a day, you know?

01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:28.680
That says a lot about how the day is going to go.

01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:30.240
Can I ask a question about that?

01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:31.240
Sure.

01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:32.240
I would love your thought.

01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:35.140
Even your, I don't know how familiar you are with that Dragon Cancer game.

01:08:35.140 --> 01:08:39.240
The creator of the game, for those who may not know what that game is about, essentially

01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:45.120
the developer created this game surrounding his son, and, you know, the son had passed

01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:50.160
and so on and so forth, and this game was a very striking game, and when the developer

01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:55.200
got awarded at the game awards, whatever it was called, I can't remember the name of it.

01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:58.560
Is that the big hub-a-loo that Jeff Keighley does?

01:08:58.560 --> 01:08:59.560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:00.560
The game awards.

01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:01.560
Yeah, the game awards or whatever.

01:09:01.980 --> 01:09:06.420
So, the developer caught a lot of heat because, you know, obviously the controversy was, you're

01:09:06.420 --> 01:09:14.900
making money off the illness and death of your son, so, you know, so I, yeah, you know,

01:09:14.900 --> 01:09:15.900
so...

01:09:15.900 --> 01:09:18.420
Rob is currently looking at his brain.

01:09:18.420 --> 01:09:27.980
So, yeah, you know, I mean, I know for me, there are games for me that I know I want

01:09:27.980 --> 01:09:33.140
to make to talk about my experiences with my family, because, you know, eventually they're

01:09:33.140 --> 01:09:37.040
going to go, they're going to go, and there's going to be things that I want to remember

01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:41.040
them by, you know, in different ways, but what are your thoughts, you know, what are

01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:42.040
your thoughts on that?

01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:43.040
This is a great question.

01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:45.920
I'm going to put it as simply as I can.

01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:52.120
If you go into any museum and see paintings of the Civil War or paintings of, you know,

01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:57.920
tragedies that have happened in culture, are those people profiting off of human tragedies?

01:09:57.920 --> 01:10:05.820
No, because art is a spontaneous expression of culture, and that is what that dragon cancer

01:10:05.820 --> 01:10:06.820
is.

01:10:06.820 --> 01:10:11.220
It is an expression of what this person was going through, but guess what?

01:10:11.220 --> 01:10:17.460
Expressions don't pay the fucking rent, so, yes, the guy gets to sell this because other

01:10:17.460 --> 01:10:26.260
people, you know, you get to, other people get to have this experience that many people

01:10:26.260 --> 01:10:31.800
are not going to, fortunately, I suppose, get to experience, you know what I mean by

01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:32.800
that?

01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:33.800
Absolutely.

01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:36.800
So, yes, it's fine for him to charge money for it.

01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:39.000
If you don't like it, don't fucking pay it.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:44.200
Go on to the next, download the next CD on your list or whatever you're going to steal

01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:48.840
for free, and then, you know, well, that's what it is, right?

01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:53.500
I don't fucking pay for art and the hippies, all those Burning Man hippies, I don't pay

01:10:53.500 --> 01:10:54.500
for art.

01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:56.320
Come on.

01:10:56.320 --> 01:10:57.320
I hear that.

01:10:57.320 --> 01:10:58.320
I hear that.

01:10:58.320 --> 01:10:59.320
Okay.

01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:00.320
Art, don't pay the rent.

01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:01.320
Mm-hmm.

01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:02.320
That's my thought.

01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:03.320
Fascinating.

01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:04.320
Okay.

01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:05.320
All right.

01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:09.720
Let's see, going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Bobby Blackwell reminded me Journey played

01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:10.880
live is awesome.

01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:15.200
He's not talking about the band, but at MAGFest, I mean, that journey is cool too, but back

01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:16.200
to the game.

01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:19.400
MAGFest, they did the Austin Wintory conducting live.

01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:23.920
That was my first MAGFest, and I swear to God, that's what made a fan, a MAGFest fan

01:11:23.940 --> 01:11:25.460
out of me, was going to that.

01:11:25.460 --> 01:11:26.460
It was a lot of fun.

01:11:26.460 --> 01:11:27.460
Yeah.

01:11:27.460 --> 01:11:28.460
Yeah.

01:11:28.460 --> 01:11:29.460
Yeah.

01:11:29.460 --> 01:11:33.960
That was, I saw bits and pieces of that, and it nearly brought me to tears, just because,

01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:37.720
you know, like, just the impact that that game itself has had on me, and just to hear,

01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:39.580
just to see that had happened.

01:11:39.580 --> 01:11:46.240
There is something about a crowd of 4,000 people or however many people were there when,

01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:52.320
to everyone's surprise, another player showed up in Journey, and everybody assumed that

01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:56.100
because this was, like, it was going to be a controlled environment, and that they were

01:11:56.100 --> 01:12:01.240
just going to be running through the game, and, okay, if you haven't experienced Journey

01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:03.680
by now, I guess I can tell you the big twist.

01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:07.340
In my opinion, this was a twist, and this was always better if you didn't know about

01:12:07.340 --> 01:12:10.820
this going into the game, but the reality is, it's been years, I need to get this off

01:12:10.820 --> 01:12:11.820
my chest now.

01:12:11.820 --> 01:12:16.460
The big twist in the game is that it's secretly a multiplayer game, is that you don't, you

01:12:16.460 --> 01:12:20.020
may be going through this experience, and all of a sudden, somebody who looks like you,

01:12:20.020 --> 01:12:23.800
and everything just like you shows up, and at first you're like, is this an NPC?

01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:27.960
But you don't really know, because you can't talk to them, you're not connected on voice

01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:28.960
chat or anything like that.

01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:33.040
All you can do is you can hit your button to go, and, like, make these little musical

01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:35.040
tones and, like, chirp at them, right?

01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:41.480
So, and then that's how you, and that's the magic of the game, is those, how you experience

01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:46.920
your journey with another person, or did you just run on ahead and leave that guy in the

01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:49.840
dust, literally, or what, it's how you choose to do that.

01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:56.920
So anyway, my point is, there was something really magical about reliving that in a crowd

01:12:56.920 --> 01:13:00.580
of 4,000 people, when you're going through this, and all of a sudden, another person

01:13:00.580 --> 01:13:01.580
showed up.

01:13:01.580 --> 01:13:07.380
And everybody was like, oh, shit, like, they're online, and there's another person here.

01:13:07.380 --> 01:13:10.060
And like, I remember even when they beat the game, and it showed the name of it, because

01:13:10.060 --> 01:13:11.380
it shows these people that you went on a game with.

01:13:11.380 --> 01:13:13.380
Oh, I lost my mind when I saw it.

01:13:13.380 --> 01:13:18.180
The whole audience started cheering, people were going on Twitter, who is this person?

01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:20.680
Do you know that you just played in front of MAGFest?

01:13:20.680 --> 01:13:22.680
I don't think they ever found who it was.

01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:23.680
Yeah.

01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:27.160
And that was, yeah, oh, God.

01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:31.320
I know, it was, like, I can't explain it.

01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:37.160
I can't put words on a moment like that, like, as just a gaming fan, like, that moment when

01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:39.160
it's like, I'm not alone.

01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:40.160
Right.

01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:42.160
Oh, Barf, just thinking about it, it's so powerful.

01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:44.160
I know, yeah, no, seriously, I'm getting.

01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:45.160
Yeah.

01:13:46.140 --> 01:13:49.140
I actually streamed, I recently streamed that game for their five-year anniversary.

01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:53.500
They had a five-year anniversary earlier in March, and I totally streamed it on Twitch

01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:58.140
that day to celebrate that five-year, and it still brought me to tears at the end.

01:13:58.140 --> 01:14:04.140
I had to, like, mute my mic, because I was like, so, yeah, I was done.

01:14:04.140 --> 01:14:09.480
But let me, now, back to those Twitter egg icons, or excuse me, what are the icons now?

01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:10.480
The oval people?

01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:12.660
Or whatever the fuck they are on Twitter now?

01:14:12.660 --> 01:14:13.660
Like, okay.

01:14:13.660 --> 01:14:14.660
Creepy things?

01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:20.240
People now that are tweeting that that dragon cancer guy shouldn't be making any money or

01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:21.240
whatever.

01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:23.240
Did you pay money for Journey?

01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:24.240
Yeah.

01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:27.240
Art, don't pay the fucking rent.

01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:29.240
Expressions, don't pay the rent.

01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:31.240
Money pays the rent.

01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:32.240
Yep.

01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:36.240
And that's the level of ignorance we as developers have to deal with when we make anything, you

01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:44.240
know, it's like, I could have played a game like this for free, it had so much more.

01:14:44.820 --> 01:14:50.360
I mean, and we talked about this on previous shows, it's like, what justifies the price

01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:51.900
of an indie game?

01:14:51.900 --> 01:14:58.620
What makes it quality over just, you know, a waste of steam credits or whatever the hell?

01:14:58.620 --> 01:15:04.540
And yeah, I mean, it's unfortunate, but you're absolutely right, you know, art doesn't.

01:15:04.540 --> 01:15:05.540
It doesn't.

01:15:05.540 --> 01:15:09.880
It gives us an opportunity to share who we are, but we still got to keep the roof over

01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:10.880
our heads.

01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:11.880
Yeah.

01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:12.880
Yeah.

01:15:13.020 --> 01:15:15.960
Sometimes it's just, everybody's going to be a fan of something and everything's going

01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:17.260
to have its haters.

01:15:17.260 --> 01:15:24.080
You know, somewhere out there, there is somebody who loves Bomberman Zero Mission on Xbox 360.

01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:25.480
It's got its fan club.

01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:27.580
It's small.

01:15:27.580 --> 01:15:32.900
It may not even be in this country, who knows, but it's got its fans somewhere and more power

01:15:32.900 --> 01:15:33.900
to them.

01:15:33.900 --> 01:15:37.200
Probably the same people who still play Phantasy Star Online on the 360.

01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:38.200
Excuse you.

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:40.200
You better watch where you're fucking going.

01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:41.200
Phantasy Star Online is great.

01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:42.200
Watch.

01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:46.280
You better stay in your fucking lane.

01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:49.400
That's why I started kind of turning left as I said that, because I already knew what

01:15:49.400 --> 01:15:50.400
was about to happen.

01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:51.400
That was fun.

01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:52.400
Thank you.

01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:55.440
So I don't mind coming back on the show next year to promote indie arcade.

01:15:55.440 --> 01:15:56.440
Without me?

01:15:56.440 --> 01:15:57.440
By yourself?

01:15:57.440 --> 01:15:58.440
Yeah.

01:15:58.440 --> 01:15:59.440
That'd be fantastic.

01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:00.440
Thank you.

01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:01.440
But you'll replace him in no time.

01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:02.440
I'm just kidding.

01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:03.440
I'm kidding.

01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:04.440
I'm kidding.

01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:05.440
I'm kidding.

01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:06.440
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:07.440
What?

01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:08.440
There we go.

01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:09.440
There we go.

01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:10.440
All right.

01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:11.680
So this is from your gaming week, Bree.

01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:14.680
Thank you for sharing.

01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:19.000
We spent 30 minutes with our analysis of walking simulators and all that.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:20.560
No, but it's great.

01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:22.360
Gabe, quickly, your gaming week.

01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:23.360
Of course.

01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:24.360
What would you play?

01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:32.520
Between Mass Effect Andromeda, Fallout Shelter on Xbox One, super addictive free game.

01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:33.520
I spent a couple.

01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:38.480
I decided to actually spend a couple dollars on that game because fantastic, fantastic

01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:41.280
free app game, I should say.

01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:47.840
Although it's not the most user friendly experience, but it's still a really, really good game.

01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:52.160
So between that and what else was I messing with?

01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:56.320
I kind of started dabbling again in Resident Evil 7.

01:16:56.320 --> 01:16:57.760
I haven't beat that game yet.

01:16:57.760 --> 01:16:58.760
I've just been.

01:16:58.760 --> 01:16:59.760
It's just one of those.

01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:01.320
I can only play that game in short spurts.

01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:05.840
But there was one other game that I've been messing with.

01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:11.720
I've been replaying Rayman Origins as well since it became Xbox One compatible.

01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:13.960
I never completed Origins.

01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:16.560
I beat Legends, but I never completed Origins.

01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:19.000
So I'm trying to finally beat that game.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.200
So I'm close to it now.

01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:27.320
I also dabbled in Halo Wars 2 a little bit, but yeah, Halo Wars 2 came out at the wrong

01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:31.920
time because Andromeda came out and I messed around with Breath of the Wild a little bit

01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:33.480
on the Wii U.

01:17:33.480 --> 01:17:34.480
Gorgeous game.

01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:37.880
I don't care too much about the frame rate thing, but again, that's just one of those

01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:44.640
games where I can only play one huge exploration type game at a time and Andromeda was going

01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:45.640
to be it for me.

01:17:45.640 --> 01:17:46.640
So, yeah.

01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:50.760
So that's what I've been playing and the next EDF game is coming out later this year.

01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:52.240
So yeah.

01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:55.720
So you and Loki can bro out over that.

01:17:55.720 --> 01:17:58.120
I don't get into those games the same way you guys do.

01:17:58.120 --> 01:17:59.480
No, that's okay.

01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:00.480
That's all right.

01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:04.960
I'm happy that you never played it.

01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:08.800
Maybe somebody in the chat room will relate or even Brie, because I've complained about

01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:13.920
it to her, the soldier will now be able to run because they finally added a run button

01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:19.040
for the soldier instead of me rolling, rolling constantly to speed forward.

01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:20.040
You know, yeah.

01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:24.320
So now they were genius enough to add a friggin' run button.

01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:29.440
It's like, okay, I get the wing diver can fly, but still make the dude run.

01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:30.440
Anyway.

01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:31.440
So I'm happy about that stuff.

01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:32.440
That's what I've been dabbling with.

01:18:32.440 --> 01:18:33.440
Quality of life.

01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:34.440
Things are huge.

01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:35.440
Yeah.

01:18:35.440 --> 01:18:36.440
Cool.

01:18:36.440 --> 01:18:37.440
Yeah.

01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:38.440
All right.

01:18:38.440 --> 01:18:39.440
My gaming week.

01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:40.720
So I've been obviously playing a lot of Mass Effect Andromeda.

01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:43.640
That's still been kind of continuing to dominate my week still.

01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:49.760
I am enjoying it probably even more so now than a week ago.

01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:53.760
Been trying to, it's hard to juggle multiplayer and single player.

01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:57.360
That's my biggest downfall right now is that multiplayer is still really fun for me.

01:18:57.360 --> 01:18:58.640
I'm glad we got to do that stream.

01:18:58.640 --> 01:19:01.240
We did a live stream after the show last week where I played some multiplayer.

01:19:01.240 --> 01:19:03.200
Sadly, the matchmaking was busted.

01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:06.960
So it was like, let's see how long a dungeon Buster was a good sport and he played with

01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:10.520
me and it was just the two of us and we, we were able to survive a couple of waves on

01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:14.280
our own, but you really need four people because it's balanced for people.

01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:18.460
But when I do get the matches of four people, a multiplayer is a lot of fun and Lord knows

01:19:18.460 --> 01:19:21.440
I spent a ton of time in multiplayer, Mass Effect three.

01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:24.800
That's the reason why I bought the game so many times.

01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:28.200
So yeah, well now that I'm on PC, I can play.

01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:30.000
I got to, I got to confess about that actually.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:36.080
The Mass Effect three multiplayer, I'll probably, I'll probably get some good laughs at my cost

01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:43.960
for this, but for the longest time, up until my friend back home in Jersey, Tino, he tells

01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:49.720
me, I thought Mass Effect the multiplayer part was competitive for the longest time.

01:19:49.720 --> 01:19:51.280
I, I, well that's the thing.

01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:56.760
It took me, it took me two years after the game came out for him and I to have a talk

01:19:56.760 --> 01:19:57.760
about it.

01:19:57.800 --> 01:19:59.560
And he's like, Oh, well you got to get into the multiplayer thing.

01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:02.000
And I'm like, yeah, but I'm not a competitive person.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:03.000
I do co-op.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:07.280
And then he, there was this dead silence and he's, he's typing all these dots on the screen

01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:09.680
and I'm like, Oh my God, what did I just say?

01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:11.080
And then he just railed me.

01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:13.320
He's like, Gabriel, the whole thing is co-op.

01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:15.160
I'm like, what are you talking about?

01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:16.900
He's like, you only play the computer.

01:20:16.900 --> 01:20:22.240
And I'm telling you that night I hopped right on that and I felt like such a, I felt like

01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:23.240
such a dumb ass.

01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:25.840
I was like, Oh my God, I could have been playing this forever.

01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:26.840
Yes.

01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:33.480
It blows my mind how much multiplayer and mass effect is ignored when it's such a, a

01:20:33.480 --> 01:20:37.300
like positive trait that the game has going for it.

01:20:37.300 --> 01:20:42.680
The fact that it exists in conjunction with the single player campaign, like it really

01:20:42.680 --> 01:20:44.560
blows my mind how much multiplayer gets ignored.

01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:47.880
I even went on Twitch the other night because I'm like, Oh, I want to see, no, I think it

01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:49.400
was after I was done streaming.

01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:52.460
I was like, I want to see who else streams multiplayer and what they do.

01:20:52.460 --> 01:20:56.160
And there was probably like maybe 15, 20 different channels streaming mass effect Andromeda.

01:20:56.160 --> 01:20:59.720
None of them doing multiplayer, none of them.

01:20:59.720 --> 01:21:03.060
And in a lot of the reviews of the game, multiplayer rarely got touched on.

01:21:03.060 --> 01:21:07.980
Now I understand the embargo I think was up like a day after the online servers went live.

01:21:07.980 --> 01:21:11.760
So people probably didn't have the chance to really test it, but, and I get it.

01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:15.600
Like some people don't want to touch multiplayer at all because some people are like, Ooh,

01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:16.600
the competitive stuff.

01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:18.720
It's like, kind of like what you were saying, like the competitive stuff, but, and people

01:21:18.720 --> 01:21:23.520
don't even know, like, no, it's, it's all co-op and it actually creates a much better

01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:25.920
environment than most multiplayer things.

01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:30.300
And that's what pleased me with it, Mass Effect 3, and eventually I'll play Andromeda for

01:21:30.300 --> 01:21:34.060
the co-op, but yeah, I want to go through the story first.

01:21:34.060 --> 01:21:35.700
It's probably, it's not a bad thing to do.

01:21:35.700 --> 01:21:38.540
I just enjoyed it in, in three so much I had to.

01:21:38.540 --> 01:21:39.540
So, okay.

01:21:39.540 --> 01:21:41.720
I've been playing Mass Effect Andromeda, but I've been playing some other games too.

01:21:41.720 --> 01:21:47.440
I've been playing Clicker Heroes because I hate my life and I just, it's so addicting

01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:48.440
you guys.

01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:49.440
It's so addicting.

01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:54.000
And I have to get more trophies on PlayStation 4, those fucking trophies.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:55.000
But then, okay.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:59.700
We haven't talked a lot about April Fool's jokes tonight, but I got to say Sega fucking

01:21:59.700 --> 01:22:03.400
won because they put out on Steam 8-bit Bayonetta.

01:22:03.400 --> 01:22:04.400
Yes!

01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:05.400
I saw that!

01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:06.400
Oh my goodness.

01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:07.400
Okay.

01:22:07.400 --> 01:22:10.400
It's, it's like temper your expectations.

01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:11.920
It's not like a full on platform or anything.

01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:12.920
It's a silly thing.

01:22:12.920 --> 01:22:14.400
Like it could have been a mobile game, people.

01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:18.020
Like literally all it is, like you have two buttons, like jump and shoot.

01:22:18.020 --> 01:22:20.580
And so it's like, you can just stay in one place and shoot the things or you can jump

01:22:20.580 --> 01:22:21.760
and hit the other thing.

01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:22.760
It's silly.

01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:29.760
The fact that it exists is great because that means Sega's still thinking about Bayonetta

01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:33.920
and they put it on PC on Steam.

01:22:33.920 --> 01:22:38.120
Could this be a sign that they might be doing Bayo or Bayo 2 on Steam at some point?

01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:40.200
I, Oh God, I hope so.

01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:46.360
Now the question of course is Bayo 2 was heavily, you know, heavily partnered by Nintendo.

01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:49.780
So where, you know, where it was only, you know, exclusive only with Nintendo.

01:22:49.780 --> 01:22:54.180
So how that, we'll see how that plays out, but you know, yeah.

01:22:54.180 --> 01:22:58.380
Well, I imagine that agreement's gotta be up at some point, but seriously, between all

01:22:58.380 --> 01:23:05.620
the Mario Kart 8 and Splatoon sequel and, and rumors of, of a Smash Brothers and all

01:23:05.620 --> 01:23:09.740
this stuff, like if any Wii U game deserves a second fucking chance, it's Bayo 2.

01:23:09.740 --> 01:23:10.740
Oh, no kidding.

01:23:10.740 --> 01:23:12.220
Like put it on the Switch.

01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:13.220
Put it on the Switch.

01:23:13.220 --> 01:23:14.220
Bayo 2 was...

01:23:14.220 --> 01:23:16.300
Hashtag put it on the Switch.

01:23:16.300 --> 01:23:17.300
Get switched.

01:23:17.300 --> 01:23:18.700
Hashtag get switched.

01:23:18.700 --> 01:23:21.700
So yeah, Bayonetta 2.

01:23:21.700 --> 01:23:22.700
Absolutely astounding game.

01:23:22.700 --> 01:23:23.700
Absolutely.

01:23:23.700 --> 01:23:29.300
I loved part one, but my God, part two just went in a direction I, I didn't think could

01:23:29.300 --> 01:23:30.300
be topped with part one.

01:23:30.300 --> 01:23:33.140
It's seriously like the best game that the least number of people have played.

01:23:33.140 --> 01:23:34.140
Probably.

01:23:34.140 --> 01:23:35.140
Yeah, absolutely.

01:23:35.140 --> 01:23:36.140
No, it's, it's so sad.

01:23:36.140 --> 01:23:37.140
You're right.

01:23:37.140 --> 01:23:38.140
You're right.

01:23:38.140 --> 01:23:41.660
And here I thought that, um, uh, Sinbad got it.

01:23:41.660 --> 01:23:42.660
Okay.

01:23:42.660 --> 01:23:44.580
Sinbad did do really good on April Fool's day.

01:23:44.580 --> 01:23:46.100
The Shazam thing was pretty funny.

01:23:46.620 --> 01:23:52.220
You know, talk about just, just make a, make a lemonade, lemonade out of lemons, right?

01:23:52.220 --> 01:23:57.100
Or in, in, in his case, Sinbad's case, how to make some fucking money off of it.

01:23:57.100 --> 01:24:00.460
Do you realize, do you realize he just turned a joke into money?

01:24:00.460 --> 01:24:02.380
He turned the internet urban legit.

01:24:02.380 --> 01:24:03.860
He made money off of it.

01:24:03.860 --> 01:24:08.540
What can be more American than that?

01:24:08.540 --> 01:24:12.340
But somebody's going to yell at the guy who made that dragon cancer.

01:24:12.340 --> 01:24:17.060
Meanwhile, Sinbad's making April Fool's jokes with ads on it and yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:24:17.060 --> 01:24:21.060
And they made it, but yeah, massive hypocrisy, but that's why we love this.

01:24:21.060 --> 01:24:22.060
Shut up internet.

01:24:22.060 --> 01:24:23.060
All right.

01:24:23.060 --> 01:24:26.460
You don't, you're drunk, log off.

01:24:26.460 --> 01:24:29.140
Drunk on power.

01:24:29.140 --> 01:24:32.420
And then I wanted to, I need to give this game a shout out too, because this is a, actually

01:24:32.420 --> 01:24:35.620
we're going to have these guys on the show in a couple of weeks, an indie developer.

01:24:35.620 --> 01:24:39.660
So get this, uh, Captain Matt from Starboard Power Coupling apparently has, he's one of

01:24:39.660 --> 01:24:43.580
those like small world thing, apparently has some friends who are indie developers

01:24:43.580 --> 01:24:49.220
and their game Lil' Tanks is hitting Steam on Tuesday.

01:24:49.220 --> 01:24:53.740
One of them's here in Sacramento and of course I told, I said, so it's probably a little

01:24:53.740 --> 01:24:56.700
late to submit, but do you know about this indie arcade event?

01:24:56.700 --> 01:24:59.500
You know, so I don't know if they're coming or what have you, but yeah.

01:24:59.500 --> 01:25:01.420
So another game, Lil' Tanks.

01:25:01.420 --> 01:25:05.740
So that game actually goes on sale Tuesday, but they were good enough to let me have a

01:25:05.740 --> 01:25:06.740
little peek at it early.

01:25:06.740 --> 01:25:10.220
So I was playing that over the weekend and it's kind of like a, it definitely feels like

01:25:10.220 --> 01:25:15.300
something that's probably inspired by bullet hell games, but because it's tanks, it runs

01:25:15.300 --> 01:25:16.900
sideways.

01:25:16.900 --> 01:25:22.220
So it kind of gets, you know how like a lot of like Japanese shooty games are very narrow

01:25:22.220 --> 01:25:24.540
because that's how the arcade cabinets were.

01:25:24.540 --> 01:25:27.140
This one kind of flips it on the side cause it's tanks.

01:25:27.140 --> 01:25:28.740
So it's, it's, it's different.

01:25:28.740 --> 01:25:32.940
It's very indie, you know, but it's, I, the soundtracks really good too.

01:25:32.940 --> 01:25:36.260
They're going to be here on Easter in two weeks when we're back with Orange Hospital.

01:25:36.260 --> 01:25:37.700
They're going to be here on the show.

01:25:37.700 --> 01:25:40.140
So yeah, those are the next guests we have up.

01:25:40.140 --> 01:25:41.140
So check that out.

01:25:41.140 --> 01:25:47.140
I am already thinking about Heavy Weapon on Xbox 360, Xbox Live Arcade.

01:25:47.140 --> 01:25:48.980
Yes, I'll have to bring that up.

01:25:48.980 --> 01:25:50.660
How influenced were you by Heavy Weapon?

01:25:50.660 --> 01:25:51.660
Yes, Heavy Weapon.

01:25:51.660 --> 01:25:52.660
Definitely, definitely.

01:25:52.660 --> 01:25:53.660
I'm getting some Heavy Weapon vibes.

01:25:53.660 --> 01:25:54.660
Shout out to PopCap.

01:25:54.660 --> 01:25:57.140
That was a great, great, great frigging game.

01:25:57.140 --> 01:25:59.180
So anyway, yeah, that's awesome.

01:25:59.180 --> 01:26:00.180
So check that out.

01:26:00.180 --> 01:26:02.260
That hits Steam on Tuesday, Lil' Tanks.

01:26:02.260 --> 01:26:03.940
It was a Kickstarter success too.

01:26:03.940 --> 01:26:04.940
They had to fund on Kickstarter.

01:26:04.940 --> 01:26:05.940
Nice.

01:26:06.620 --> 01:26:07.620
So good for them.

01:26:07.620 --> 01:26:10.620
So, uh, we'll, we'll ask them more questions in a couple of weeks, but I want to make sure

01:26:10.620 --> 01:26:14.780
they got a shout out because unfortunately with us not having a show next week, I couldn't

01:26:14.780 --> 01:26:16.680
get them here the week their game was out.

01:26:16.680 --> 01:26:19.620
So I want to make sure they got a shout out now.

01:26:19.620 --> 01:26:20.620
So we're all good.

01:26:20.620 --> 01:26:21.620
So check that out.

01:26:21.620 --> 01:26:22.620
Well, that's good.

01:26:22.620 --> 01:26:24.180
You could boost week two sales for an indie developer.

01:26:24.180 --> 01:26:25.180
That's true.

01:26:25.180 --> 01:26:26.180
That's true.

01:26:26.180 --> 01:26:27.180
That's true.

01:26:27.180 --> 01:26:29.140
You know, when so many games are kind of like, if you don't make it your first week, you

01:26:29.140 --> 01:26:30.220
know, see you later.

01:26:30.220 --> 01:26:31.700
Uh, I think that's good.

01:26:31.700 --> 01:26:34.700
That's good to have the lasting presence, two and three and so forth.

01:26:34.700 --> 01:26:35.700
Very, very true.

01:26:36.460 --> 01:26:37.460
All right.

01:26:37.460 --> 01:26:39.540
Anyhow, uh, I think that's going to do it for gaming weeks.

01:26:39.540 --> 01:26:41.340
Let's just do some quick housekeeping again.

01:26:41.340 --> 01:26:48.100
There will be no show live here next Sunday because we will be live on Saturday from 10

01:26:48.100 --> 01:26:56.220
AM to 4 PM for us, uh, will be live, uh, on the network provided there are no tech issues.

01:26:56.220 --> 01:26:57.220
There's always that disclaimer.

01:26:57.220 --> 01:27:00.920
There could always be a tech fuck up, uh, in which case we will record and bring to

01:27:00.920 --> 01:27:03.520
you an OLR's place, uh, the next night.

01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:08.680
But we will not be here because we will be busy with the event and actually, um, also

01:27:08.680 --> 01:27:12.960
just selfishly dark soccer and I have a long time friend who's going to be here from Japan

01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:14.440
who happens to be here that Sunday.

01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:18.300
So it's like, it's like one of those things like, okay guys, we're going to, since we're

01:27:18.300 --> 01:27:20.600
putting in the hours the day before, we're gonna take the night off to go be with our

01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:21.600
friends.

01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:22.600
F is for friendship.

01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:23.600
Exactly.

01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:24.600
Exactly.

01:27:24.600 --> 01:27:25.600
Dijour means friendship.

01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:29.400
And honestly, how long has it been since she's been in the U S like a year, at least, at

01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:30.400
least.

01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:31.400
Yeah.

01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:32.400
So this will be really, really nice.

01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:37.480
Oh, from there, my favorite, my favorite flavor right now.

01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:38.480
Oh, that's awesome.

01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:39.480
Fantastic.

01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:42.160
So, uh, but we will be back on, yes, Easter Sunday.

01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:45.600
So if WrestleMania can't stop us, you know, Easter ain't going to stop us.

01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:50.480
So mine remains to be seen because it's the sisters.

01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:52.560
I'm like, we're going to be missing the Jewish person on Easter.

01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:53.560
Really?

01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:54.560
It's Passover.

01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:55.560
All right.

01:27:55.560 --> 01:27:56.560
Fair enough.

01:27:56.560 --> 01:27:57.560
Fair enough.

01:27:57.560 --> 01:27:58.560
Fair enough.

01:27:59.160 --> 01:28:03.720
I will be hosting a Seder on Wednesday if you want to come eat horseradish and matzah

01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:04.720
with us.

01:28:04.720 --> 01:28:07.600
Matzah's, matzah's, it's an acquired taste, but yeah.

01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:08.600
All right.

01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:15.520
Matzah is, to quote a friend of mine, it's like Jewish ex lax.

01:28:15.520 --> 01:28:16.520
It's very binding.

01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:17.520
Wow.

01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:18.520
All right.

01:28:18.520 --> 01:28:19.520
Anyhow.

01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:21.400
Uh, so she's not wrong.

01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:22.400
So fine.

01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:23.400
So fine.

01:28:23.400 --> 01:28:24.400
I get totally not wrong.

01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:27.640
I swear to God, this happened to me for a month last year where I had flip flop posts

01:28:27.640 --> 01:28:28.640
for the whole month.

01:28:28.640 --> 01:28:29.640
It was like one week.

01:28:29.640 --> 01:28:30.640
Loki was here and Jamie wasn't.

01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:32.080
Then Jamie was here and Loki wasn't.

01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:33.860
So we're going to, we're going to do this again this month.

01:28:33.860 --> 01:28:35.240
So check that out.

01:28:35.240 --> 01:28:36.880
Uh, we'll be back on April 16th.

01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:40.460
I can also tell you now, I know this is a ways out, but I just want to make sure y'all

01:28:40.460 --> 01:28:41.460
can plan.

01:28:41.460 --> 01:28:42.460
It's also right before my birthday.

01:28:42.460 --> 01:28:43.460
It is.

01:28:43.460 --> 01:28:44.460
It is.

01:28:44.460 --> 01:28:45.460
You're going to miss your, you're going to miss your birthday show.

01:28:45.460 --> 01:28:46.460
That's fine.

01:28:46.460 --> 01:28:47.460
I'll do it the week after.

01:28:47.460 --> 01:28:50.080
Let's quickly talk about OLR's birthday show.

01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:56.560
So OLR's 15th birthday show is going to be June 18th.

01:28:56.600 --> 01:28:58.960
Quinceañera!

01:28:58.960 --> 01:29:00.520
Here's the thing with the Quinceañera.

01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:01.640
That's two months out.

01:29:01.640 --> 01:29:04.160
We don't have time to get a ballroom or any of that shit.

01:29:04.160 --> 01:29:05.160
So my thought is...

01:29:05.160 --> 01:29:06.580
Can I just wear a pretty dress?

01:29:06.580 --> 01:29:09.020
Let's him, yes, you can wear a pretty dress.

01:29:09.020 --> 01:29:13.240
Let's invite some of our friends to the studio to just have a nice 15th episode.

01:29:13.240 --> 01:29:14.240
Invite some of our friends.

01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:18.080
We'll see if maybe the game bang guys want to come back or I can sing some Spanish music.

01:29:18.080 --> 01:29:19.080
Yeah, you can.

01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:24.720
We'll get some folks here in studio and then maybe for episode 700, maybe our friends that

01:29:24.920 --> 01:29:28.160
have done event planning in the past will give me a list of contacts.

01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:33.360
And for episode 700, we can maybe look at, like, or something maybe would be willing

01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:36.160
to host episode 700 and we could do an event like that.

01:29:36.160 --> 01:29:40.160
I had to mouse something to the co-hosts because I don't want to put it on air, but...

01:29:40.160 --> 01:29:41.160
Secrets!

01:29:41.160 --> 01:29:42.160
Yes.

01:29:42.160 --> 01:29:43.160
So that way we have enough time to plan.

01:29:43.160 --> 01:29:48.720
Keep in mind in Alabama, I had no idea what that was called, that it was a thing.

01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:52.260
I had never heard of that until I moved to California.

01:29:52.260 --> 01:30:00.460
So I totally want to get everything done and wear a floofy 80s style dress.

01:30:00.460 --> 01:30:01.460
Go ahead.

01:30:01.460 --> 01:30:02.460
Do you want to do full drag for the quinceañera?

01:30:02.460 --> 01:30:03.460
Go for it.

01:30:03.460 --> 01:30:05.760
Well, I already do that.

01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:06.760
Give us your best Valentina.

01:30:06.760 --> 01:30:08.700
It's just reenacting Breakfast Club, apparently.

01:30:08.700 --> 01:30:14.700
But no, I will not ask if anyone wants to see my cuckoo.

01:30:14.700 --> 01:30:17.380
Episode 700 should be in about four months.

01:30:17.380 --> 01:30:18.380
I'm...

01:30:18.380 --> 01:30:20.460
God, I just, I hope it's not the same weekend as Dragon Con.

01:30:20.460 --> 01:30:21.460
I don't think it would be.

01:30:21.460 --> 01:30:24.820
It would be probably right around right after, right around mid-September, I think is when

01:30:24.820 --> 01:30:25.980
that would fall.

01:30:25.980 --> 01:30:27.580
Off the plot it out on a list somewhere.

01:30:27.580 --> 01:30:28.580
So all right.

01:30:28.580 --> 01:30:30.300
Well, Bree, you're dying to say something over there.

01:30:30.300 --> 01:30:33.180
Well, four months is plenty of time to plan a proper party.

01:30:33.180 --> 01:30:34.180
Yeah.

01:30:34.180 --> 01:30:35.240
So I think, I think that's okay.

01:30:35.240 --> 01:30:37.340
So Gabe and Bree are doing the we're going to talk thing.

01:30:37.340 --> 01:30:39.620
So get ready, y'all.

01:30:39.620 --> 01:30:44.620
Episode 700, we're going to bring to you everything we promised for the quinceañera in proper

01:30:44.620 --> 01:30:46.700
OLR tardy fashion.

01:30:46.700 --> 01:30:53.580
So and since JD said OMG Valentina, I want that wig.

01:30:53.580 --> 01:30:54.580
All right.

01:30:54.580 --> 01:30:55.580
Look, red wig.

01:30:55.580 --> 01:30:57.220
I got another podcast to talk about all that.

01:30:57.220 --> 01:30:58.220
All right.

01:30:58.220 --> 01:30:59.220
You never had me on.

01:30:59.220 --> 01:31:00.220
Oh, man.

01:31:00.220 --> 01:31:01.220
We had enough.

01:31:01.220 --> 01:31:04.020
We have a spot available this last week to the spikes in Japan.

01:31:04.020 --> 01:31:05.020
Oh, well.

01:31:05.020 --> 01:31:06.020
Anyway.

01:31:06.020 --> 01:31:07.020
We got to move.

01:31:07.020 --> 01:31:08.020
We got to move on.

01:31:08.020 --> 01:31:09.940
We got to get into some gaming news and what's going on.

01:31:09.940 --> 01:31:12.940
Oh, no, I didn't say the whole thing with the quinceañera.

01:31:12.940 --> 01:31:19.740
So the actual 15th birthday will be June 18th because we're giving ourselves the best

01:31:19.740 --> 01:31:22.140
birthday present ever.

01:31:22.140 --> 01:31:23.920
Taking a week off on June 25th.

01:31:23.920 --> 01:31:26.260
So we will not be here like June 25th.

01:31:26.260 --> 01:31:27.260
Awesome.

01:31:27.260 --> 01:31:28.580
Just just booked it today.

01:31:28.580 --> 01:31:30.460
Hubby and I are going to finally take our proper honeymoon.

01:31:30.460 --> 01:31:31.460
We're going to go to Chicago.

01:31:31.460 --> 01:31:32.460
We have.

01:31:32.460 --> 01:31:33.460
Oh, I saw the tweet.

01:31:33.460 --> 01:31:34.460
Congrats.

01:31:34.460 --> 01:31:35.460
Congrats, man.

01:31:35.460 --> 01:31:36.820
We have some friends that live out in Chicago.

01:31:36.820 --> 01:31:39.580
And for a couple of years now, they've been saying you got to come to Pride out in Chicago.

01:31:39.580 --> 01:31:40.580
It's a lot of fun.

01:31:40.580 --> 01:31:41.580
Come to Pride.

01:31:41.860 --> 01:31:44.540
Also, you guys may remember the show is right around my birthday.

01:31:44.540 --> 01:31:46.920
So it's kind of one of those like everything lines up just right.

01:31:46.920 --> 01:31:47.920
So we're going to.

01:31:47.920 --> 01:31:48.920
I'm.

01:31:48.920 --> 01:31:49.920
That's wonderful.

01:31:49.920 --> 01:31:50.920
You guys deserve that.

01:31:50.920 --> 01:31:51.920
That's awesome.

01:31:51.920 --> 01:31:52.920
Fucking gay as hell.

01:31:52.920 --> 01:31:53.920
That's what.

01:31:53.920 --> 01:31:55.380
No show is canceled due to gay.

01:31:55.380 --> 01:32:03.820
That is exactly what is happening on June 25th show canceled due to gay.

01:32:03.820 --> 01:32:08.060
The gay agenda has finally succeeded in overthrowing an episode of all right.

01:32:08.060 --> 01:32:09.060
Yes.

01:32:09.060 --> 01:32:10.060
There's ramen chat.

01:32:10.060 --> 01:32:11.060
Isn't that the gay agenda?

01:32:11.060 --> 01:32:12.060
Yes.

01:32:12.060 --> 01:32:14.660
All right.

01:32:14.660 --> 01:32:18.660
Let's get into some news this week at the top of the show.

01:32:18.660 --> 01:32:20.940
Again, we're missing Loki unexpectedly.

01:32:20.940 --> 01:32:23.340
Did you want me to start Dark Soccer or did you want to start with.

01:32:23.340 --> 01:32:24.340
Yes, you start.

01:32:24.340 --> 01:32:25.340
OK, I'm going to start with this one.

01:32:25.340 --> 01:32:29.020
So let's talk about the Video Game Hall of Fame.

01:32:29.020 --> 01:32:30.700
Did you know there was a Video Game Hall of Fame?

01:32:30.700 --> 01:32:34.420
I would hope so, because we've talked about it a couple of years past.

01:32:34.420 --> 01:32:38.980
There have only been 12 games inducted into the Hall of Fame previously.

01:32:38.980 --> 01:32:44.420
Doom, Grand Theft Auto 3, The Legend of Zelda, Oregon Trail, Pac-Man, Pong, The Sims, Sonic

01:32:44.420 --> 01:32:49.820
the Hedgehog, Space Invaders, Super Mario Brothers, Tetris, and World of Warcraft.

01:32:49.820 --> 01:32:56.420
So the Video Game Hall of Fame has the nominees for the 2017 class announced.

01:32:56.420 --> 01:33:01.420
You could think of this as something similar to like the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and

01:33:01.420 --> 01:33:04.780
that whole thing, because isn't Journey finally getting inducted to Rock and Roll Hall of

01:33:04.780 --> 01:33:05.780
Fame this year?

01:33:05.780 --> 01:33:07.660
I think I heard something about that.

01:33:07.660 --> 01:33:08.660
Yes.

01:33:09.340 --> 01:33:11.660
There's a series that Steve Perry might actually fucking show up and that has everybody like

01:33:11.660 --> 01:33:14.860
OMG, right?

01:33:14.860 --> 01:33:18.840
Well yeah, Bob Dylan finally accepted the Pulitzer or something like that, or a Nobel

01:33:18.840 --> 01:33:19.840
Peace Prize.

01:33:19.840 --> 01:33:21.660
So yeah, anything's possible now.

01:33:21.660 --> 01:33:27.020
So anyway, the Strong Museum of Play is located in Rochester, New York.

01:33:27.020 --> 01:33:29.540
That's where this whole thing is located if you want to know where it is physically.

01:33:29.540 --> 01:33:32.780
OK, so here's the part like most podcasts are going to do.

01:33:32.780 --> 01:33:33.780
We're going to do the same thing.

01:33:33.780 --> 01:33:36.500
We're going to read the list and then tell you how much it sucks.

01:33:36.500 --> 01:33:39.700
No, we're going to tell you what we would put in.

01:33:39.700 --> 01:33:45.520
So I'm going to tell you all, I'm going to ask you all of this list, which one is the

01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:46.820
most important?

01:33:46.820 --> 01:33:48.820
Which one needs to be in that fucking Hall of Fame already?

01:33:48.820 --> 01:33:49.820
You ready?

01:33:49.820 --> 01:33:50.820
You get to pick one.

01:33:50.820 --> 01:33:52.300
If you pick two, I'm muting you.

01:33:52.300 --> 01:33:53.300
All right.

01:33:53.300 --> 01:33:54.300
I'm cutting your mic off.

01:33:54.300 --> 01:33:55.300
Pick one.

01:33:55.300 --> 01:33:56.300
Here it is.

01:33:56.300 --> 01:34:04.260
Donkey Kong Country, Final Fantasy 7, Halo Combat Evolved, Microsoft Windows.

01:34:04.260 --> 01:34:07.380
Sorry, you all know why I'm laughing.

01:34:07.380 --> 01:34:08.780
Long time, all our losers.

01:34:08.780 --> 01:34:18.780
Microsoft Windows Solitaire, Mortal Kombat, Myst, Pokemon Red and Green, Portal, Resident

01:34:18.780 --> 01:34:25.700
Evil, Street Fighter 2, Tomb Raider and Wii Sports.

01:34:25.700 --> 01:34:27.780
This is fucking easy for me.

01:34:27.780 --> 01:34:28.780
But what do you think?

01:34:28.780 --> 01:34:29.780
One game on that list.

01:34:29.780 --> 01:34:31.780
It's Halo, right?

01:34:32.300 --> 01:34:33.300
I snorted over here.

01:34:33.300 --> 01:34:34.300
Didn't you hear that?

01:34:34.300 --> 01:34:35.300
No.

01:34:35.300 --> 01:34:36.300
I had to.

01:34:36.300 --> 01:34:40.900
And I'm going strictly on objective reasoning here, but I would pick Street Fighter 2.

01:34:40.900 --> 01:34:42.340
And why is that?

01:34:42.340 --> 01:34:47.420
Because it was the game that innovated the fighting game genre and has contributed to

01:34:47.420 --> 01:34:49.000
so many clones.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:54.020
And I don't even think we'd have would have Mortal Kombat if not for Street Fighter 2.

01:34:54.020 --> 01:34:58.700
So I mean, true, there was just the first Street Fighter and it was OK, but Street Fighter

01:34:58.700 --> 01:35:03.220
2 was the one that gained the real notoriety.

01:35:03.220 --> 01:35:07.620
And now, I mean, the franchise is still going strong today, so it has to count for something.

01:35:07.620 --> 01:35:09.180
All right.

01:35:09.180 --> 01:35:10.180
But Bree, can I pick on Bree?

01:35:10.180 --> 01:35:12.700
Did you pick one from that list that you think needs to be there?

01:35:12.700 --> 01:35:17.420
I was gonna say Mortal Kombat, but then I was just swayed by the knowledge of Jamie

01:35:17.420 --> 01:35:22.700
because I was only in first or second grade when Street Fighter 2 came out, I think.

01:35:22.700 --> 01:35:26.540
So I didn't really know, but I was gonna say Mortal Kombat because the rating system came

01:35:26.540 --> 01:35:27.540
out then, right?

01:35:27.540 --> 01:35:28.540
That's a good point.

01:35:28.580 --> 01:35:32.300
I was just about to say, you know, even though, yes, she makes a compelling argument, you

01:35:32.300 --> 01:35:38.700
make like that is the thing that Mortal Kombat brought the industry is Mortal Kombat caused

01:35:38.700 --> 01:35:41.860
our industry to self-regulate itself.

01:35:41.860 --> 01:35:43.420
So don't discount that.

01:35:43.420 --> 01:35:45.060
That's that's huge what that game did.

01:35:45.060 --> 01:35:50.980
So a fair counterpoint, Gabe, for you.

01:35:50.980 --> 01:35:56.900
So yeah, I would almost I would almost say Street Fighter 2 as well, because Street Fighter

01:35:56.900 --> 01:36:01.740
2 really did change the landscape of fighting games, period.

01:36:01.740 --> 01:36:04.860
Though one can argue, where's Virtua Fighter?

01:36:04.860 --> 01:36:07.500
But anyway, that's more on a 3D thing.

01:36:07.500 --> 01:36:14.540
But on both a personal level, on a very personal level, and then just on the technological

01:36:14.540 --> 01:36:22.020
standpoint, I'm gonna say Donkey Kong Country, because Donkey Kong Country is that was the

01:36:22.020 --> 01:36:27.500
first game to incorporate 3D graphics in a 16-bit system.

01:36:27.500 --> 01:36:28.500
Counter that.

01:36:28.500 --> 01:36:29.500
Counter that.

01:36:29.500 --> 01:36:32.500
There's a game on the TurboGrafx-16 called Sapphire.

01:36:32.500 --> 01:36:33.500
Okay.

01:36:33.500 --> 01:36:34.500
Okay.

01:36:34.500 --> 01:36:35.500
Counter to counter.

01:36:35.500 --> 01:36:38.780
How many kids owned a Super Nintendo versus how many kids owned a TurboGrafx-16?

01:36:38.780 --> 01:36:41.420
But we also had Star Fox.

01:36:41.420 --> 01:36:45.100
We also had Stunt Race.

01:36:45.100 --> 01:36:53.420
So Star Fox was so the significance with Star Fox is because of that Super FX chip

01:36:53.420 --> 01:36:57.940
that allowed a full 3D environment to be played.

01:36:57.940 --> 01:36:58.940
Where was it?

01:36:58.940 --> 01:37:04.180
Where, unlike Mode 7, where everything was flat, you know, the Super FX chip allowed

01:37:04.180 --> 01:37:09.660
actual an actual playable 3D environment, although it was linear and it was pathed,

01:37:09.660 --> 01:37:11.420
you know, you could still do that.

01:37:12.180 --> 01:37:18.980
For me, the significance with Donkey Kong Country was that it utilized actual silicone

01:37:18.980 --> 01:37:26.620
graphic models and animations into a 16-bit system, and it was just an astounding game.

01:37:26.620 --> 01:37:33.420
For me, you know, it proved that anything was possible, you know, VR was just beginning

01:37:33.420 --> 01:37:41.980
to blow up back then, because you're talking 93, 94 that this came out, and that was one

01:37:41.980 --> 01:37:46.540
of the games that ultimately inspired me to want to get into computer animation.

01:37:46.540 --> 01:37:51.640
You had to be 10 or 12 or a kid at the time and see that fucking game for the first time

01:37:51.640 --> 01:37:54.260
where it's like your head just fucking explodes.

01:37:54.260 --> 01:38:00.860
I still have the video of the behind the scenes that Nintendo Power included.

01:38:00.860 --> 01:38:07.220
It was a CD that included the making of Donkey Kong Country and all this other stuff, and

01:38:07.220 --> 01:38:10.340
it highlighted the actual development behind it and things like that.

01:38:10.340 --> 01:38:14.180
Did you have the balls to call the chatroom nerds earlier and then come with that?

01:38:14.180 --> 01:38:18.300
Let me make another step aside from that.

01:38:18.300 --> 01:38:23.140
As far as I was aware, the characters were rendered, yes, but there's still sprites in

01:38:23.140 --> 01:38:28.620
game, so they're still, the rendering was converted into sprites, so it technically

01:38:28.620 --> 01:38:33.180
is still sprite animation, and of course the backgrounds are easy to do because they're

01:38:33.180 --> 01:38:38.780
all going to be a flat 2D entity just rendered from 3D graphics.

01:38:38.780 --> 01:38:39.780
Right, certainly.

01:38:39.780 --> 01:38:40.780
Absolutely.

01:38:40.780 --> 01:38:44.640
So, in that being the respect, maybe the creation of the game had a little bit more tech going

01:38:44.640 --> 01:38:46.860
into it, but at the end of the day, it's still a platformer.

01:38:46.860 --> 01:38:49.940
Oh yeah, it was still a platformer, but I think that was the genius behind it.

01:38:49.940 --> 01:38:56.460
It was the fact that, you know, yes, it was a platformer, but, you know, it was the first

01:38:56.460 --> 01:39:04.460
time you had fully animated, full-framed characters and movement and expressions done

01:39:04.460 --> 01:39:11.380
that was actually genuinely powered by, you know, a silicone graphics machine, not a chip.

01:39:11.380 --> 01:39:12.380
That's where Star Fox comes in.

01:39:12.380 --> 01:39:17.660
Star Fox, you know, they created a proprietary chip, but Donkey Kong Country did not.

01:39:17.660 --> 01:39:22.540
It used an actual silicone graphics, and that wasn't cheap back then.

01:39:22.540 --> 01:39:27.260
For me, Street Fighter II, no contest, but not the reason Jamie said.

01:39:27.260 --> 01:39:32.300
I mean, not that what she said, but for me, it's the arcades in general, like it's not

01:39:32.300 --> 01:39:33.300
even just the fighting games.

01:39:33.300 --> 01:39:38.260
It's just the 90s arcades was defined by Street Fighter II, I think.

01:39:38.260 --> 01:39:39.820
And I think that's it.

01:39:39.820 --> 01:39:42.520
This game probably had a greater impact than any other game.

01:39:42.520 --> 01:39:45.660
It's really close with Pokemon, though, but I don't want to turn off my own mic.

01:39:45.660 --> 01:39:48.980
So that's all I'm going to say.

01:39:48.980 --> 01:39:53.740
So because, well, okay, I can't.

01:39:53.740 --> 01:39:54.740
He wants to.

01:39:54.740 --> 01:39:57.820
I want to so bad, but we need to move on.

01:39:57.820 --> 01:40:01.100
So let's talk about one other thing I will go back and say about Sapphire.

01:40:01.100 --> 01:40:04.380
It was one of the PC Engine Turbo game or duo games.

01:40:04.380 --> 01:40:05.380
So it was CD.

01:40:05.380 --> 01:40:06.380
Yes, it was CD.

01:40:06.380 --> 01:40:07.380
That's why.

01:40:07.380 --> 01:40:08.380
But I'm posting a picture in the chat room.

01:40:08.380 --> 01:40:09.380
But still, wonderful reference.

01:40:09.380 --> 01:40:10.380
Yeah, Sapphire.

01:40:10.380 --> 01:40:11.380
Wonderful reference.

01:40:11.380 --> 01:40:15.700
It goes for like 800 bucks, give or take.

01:40:15.700 --> 01:40:20.380
So anyway, one game that, hey, based on the early reviews might end up in the Hall of

01:40:20.380 --> 01:40:24.820
Fame in 10 years, who knows, Persona 5 finally making its way out this week.

01:40:24.820 --> 01:40:27.340
You know, Persona has its rabid fans.

01:40:27.340 --> 01:40:30.620
People are really freaking excited about Persona 5.

01:40:30.620 --> 01:40:31.900
See, here's the thing.

01:40:31.900 --> 01:40:35.380
And we talked a little bit about this on the call with Bobby earlier tonight.

01:40:35.380 --> 01:40:37.300
I have no hate in my heart for Persona.

01:40:37.300 --> 01:40:40.260
In fact, I played a little bit of Persona 4 on the Vita, and I do think it's really

01:40:40.260 --> 01:40:41.720
cool and a different experience.

01:40:41.720 --> 01:40:45.420
The problem is, like, it takes like 100 hours to get through one of those games.

01:40:45.420 --> 01:40:49.300
And it's like, it's hard enough for me to play the games that I play.

01:40:49.300 --> 01:40:54.820
Like, Bree, would you be able to squeeze in 100 hours to play Persona 5 this week?

01:40:54.820 --> 01:40:58.320
This week?

01:40:58.320 --> 01:41:02.740
One of my volunteers for the event has actually started it and he's like, Oh, you should try

01:41:02.740 --> 01:41:03.740
this.

01:41:03.740 --> 01:41:04.740
I'm like,

01:41:04.740 --> 01:41:05.740
Yeah, yeah.

01:41:05.740 --> 01:41:09.380
Let me pencil you in in 2019.

01:41:09.380 --> 01:41:11.620
But yeah, that's just the type of time commitment it's gonna take.

01:41:11.620 --> 01:41:15.000
But I know, like, especially JRPG fans, very excited about Persona.

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.440
The reviews are off the charts for this game.

01:41:17.440 --> 01:41:22.640
It's going to be, you know, this is this is one other interesting thing about this year.

01:41:22.640 --> 01:41:24.180
Lots of solid game reviews.

01:41:24.180 --> 01:41:27.960
You know, it's funny because a couple weeks ago, I think I said, I said, Oh, Zelda Breath

01:41:27.960 --> 01:41:29.200
of Wild is going to be game of the year.

01:41:29.200 --> 01:41:30.200
It's already over.

01:41:30.200 --> 01:41:34.040
And now I'm like, shit, maybe it maybe actually, that was a little early to say that.

01:41:34.040 --> 01:41:37.960
I mean, it really was early to say that, but shit, for some people, it's definitely gonna

01:41:37.960 --> 01:41:38.960
be Persona 5.

01:41:38.960 --> 01:41:41.080
I think it just depends on the type of game you're into.

01:41:41.080 --> 01:41:43.960
But like, it's getting a lot of solid reviews over there as well.

01:41:43.960 --> 01:41:46.880
There's other games too that we get into really, this has been a really just good fucking

01:41:46.880 --> 01:41:48.440
year for games so far.

01:41:48.440 --> 01:41:55.160
So anyway, Persona 5, of course, going to be coming out on PlayStation 3 and 4 because

01:41:55.160 --> 01:41:57.000
the game was originally supposed to be a PS3 exclusive.

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:58.000
That's true.

01:41:58.000 --> 01:41:59.000
It's just taken.

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:00.000
They've been taking their sweet ass time.

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:01.000
Smart move though.

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:06.180
You want, hey, we talked about Andromeda not being a well-cooked meal last week, and now

01:42:06.180 --> 01:42:08.920
this one is going to be a well-cooked meal, so that'll be exciting.

01:42:08.920 --> 01:42:12.180
However, here's the thing, the share button is going to be disabled.

01:42:12.180 --> 01:42:13.840
You will not be able to share the pictures.

01:42:13.840 --> 01:42:17.120
You won't be able to stream the game, at least natively through the PlayStation 4.

01:42:17.120 --> 01:42:20.860
They have cut all of that off, and Atlus did this.

01:42:20.860 --> 01:42:25.380
I guess this happens in other Japanese game releases on PlayStation 4.

01:42:25.380 --> 01:42:29.660
I know like cut scenes in other games have been blocked and so forth, but the whole game

01:42:29.660 --> 01:42:30.660
blocked.

01:42:30.660 --> 01:42:35.460
You are not going to be able to stream it, although we all know all you're going to need

01:42:35.460 --> 01:42:40.080
is a capture card, the extra outside material, and people will be streaming this.

01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:47.340
So in my opinion, it's just giving those people an advantage, so to speak, in the competition

01:42:47.340 --> 01:42:49.340
market, but it is what it is.

01:42:49.340 --> 01:42:50.740
They're not going to stop it.

01:42:50.740 --> 01:42:52.140
Yeah, they state why they blocked the share.

01:42:52.140 --> 01:42:53.140
Story spoilers.

01:42:53.140 --> 01:42:54.140
That's really what it is.

01:42:54.140 --> 01:42:55.460
They just don't want people ruining it.

01:42:55.460 --> 01:42:56.460
But it's going to happen anyway.

01:42:56.460 --> 01:42:58.940
But I'm saying like block Andromeda, if that's the case.

01:42:58.940 --> 01:42:59.940
Block Zelda.

01:42:59.940 --> 01:43:01.900
Well, but that's EA and Nintendo.

01:43:01.900 --> 01:43:02.900
That's not Atlus.

01:43:02.900 --> 01:43:07.060
Yeah, but I mean, if that's the premise for why they're going to block you, those stories,

01:43:07.060 --> 01:43:08.600
we want to spoil the story.

01:43:08.600 --> 01:43:13.900
It's like, it takes 100 hours, give or take, you know, to beat.

01:43:13.900 --> 01:43:16.180
It'll be the end of the year at the least.

01:43:16.180 --> 01:43:19.460
So I mean, before really, what are you ruining?

01:43:19.460 --> 01:43:23.300
But I mean, if it's one thing, if they want to block the cut scenes or the big story moments

01:43:23.300 --> 01:43:28.220
or things like that, but I mean, like, let us stream the battle sequences and things

01:43:28.220 --> 01:43:33.580
like that, at least, you know, the actual game elements, a little weird, but I just

01:43:33.580 --> 01:43:35.660
kind of think it's going to end up being useless.

01:43:35.660 --> 01:43:38.300
Okay, so the PlayStation can't do it natively.

01:43:38.320 --> 01:43:42.000
Well, people have capture cards in their computer.

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:43.000
They're going to get around it.

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:44.000
Yep.

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:45.000
So that's that.

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:48.180
This game will, game will be streamed, actually, it's probably going to, it's going to make

01:43:48.180 --> 01:43:51.200
more people want to stream it because they're going to feel like they have the exclusive

01:43:51.200 --> 01:43:52.200
on it.

01:43:52.200 --> 01:43:53.200
Now that this news is out there.

01:43:53.200 --> 01:43:54.560
You just made this a hotter property.

01:43:54.560 --> 01:43:55.560
Yep.

01:43:55.560 --> 01:43:56.560
You told us we can't.

01:43:56.560 --> 01:43:57.560
We will.

01:43:57.560 --> 01:43:58.560
I know the internet.

01:43:58.560 --> 01:44:02.840
I know the internet overuses this fucking term, but it's Streisand effect.

01:44:02.840 --> 01:44:04.440
It's true, man.

01:44:04.440 --> 01:44:07.760
That like most overused thing on the internet, but anyway, all right.

01:44:08.300 --> 01:44:15.280
To register participation for this week's episode of orange lounge radio at vognetwork.com,

01:44:15.280 --> 01:44:20.120
use the passphrase poison, dark Sakura, what do you got for us?

01:44:20.120 --> 01:44:23.800
Well, some stuff about Oculus ish.

01:44:23.800 --> 01:44:29.000
The co-founder Palmer lucky is leaving Facebook.

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:34.320
He had his last day already.

01:44:34.320 --> 01:44:38.860
There's no real notice as to why or not.

01:44:38.860 --> 01:44:48.340
However, it was revealed that he was a supporter of 45 because that name is not worth mentioning

01:44:48.340 --> 01:44:51.660
on the show.

01:44:51.660 --> 01:44:56.140
And he also created these memes that attacked Hillary Clinton.

01:44:56.140 --> 01:44:57.140
Yeah.

01:44:57.140 --> 01:45:00.300
And from what, you know, again, I want to watch the politics and everything, but my,

01:45:00.300 --> 01:45:02.220
my understanding is it was those memes.

01:45:02.220 --> 01:45:07.000
And they, I mean, it's, you know, people feel however they feel politically, but it

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:10.600
was the memes and the involvement and all that stuff that people were really taking

01:45:10.600 --> 01:45:11.600
issue with it.

01:45:11.600 --> 01:45:13.180
It was like, it wasn't just the politics.

01:45:13.180 --> 01:45:16.680
It was the heavy involvement in what was kind of, it was a big smear campaign.

01:45:16.680 --> 01:45:20.520
It wasn't pizza gate, but it was, it was a smear campaign.

01:45:20.520 --> 01:45:21.520
That's what it was.

01:45:21.520 --> 01:45:22.520
Plain and simple.

01:45:22.520 --> 01:45:27.560
So anyway, and so, um, Facebook's, uh, statement about it is just that they, uh, wish him well

01:45:27.560 --> 01:45:32.200
and thought his innovative spirit helped kickstart the modern VR revolution and build an internet

01:45:32.200 --> 01:45:33.180
industry.

01:45:33.180 --> 01:45:36.540
Um, but we've been hiding him in the basement for the past six months until his contract

01:45:36.540 --> 01:45:37.540
ran out.

01:45:37.540 --> 01:45:38.540
Anyway.

01:45:38.540 --> 01:45:39.540
Cause that seems obvious.

01:45:39.540 --> 01:45:40.540
What's been happening here.

01:45:40.540 --> 01:45:43.340
Where, where, where the fuck has he been?

01:45:43.340 --> 01:45:44.340
Yeah.

01:45:44.340 --> 01:45:46.720
In, in a, they kept him in the cellar.

01:45:46.720 --> 01:45:52.780
They kept him in the naughty room, clearly Christian gray was like, come here in my room

01:45:52.780 --> 01:45:54.780
of secrets.

01:45:54.780 --> 01:45:59.340
Oh, let's not give that any attention.

01:45:59.340 --> 01:46:00.340
I couldn't help myself.

01:46:00.340 --> 01:46:02.200
Oh, that's so disgusting.

01:46:02.200 --> 01:46:06.320
Bobby Black Wolf also points out, you know, besides the, besides the political stuff,

01:46:06.320 --> 01:46:12.080
he said he also violated an NDA and caused Facebook to lose a $500 million lawsuits.

01:46:12.080 --> 01:46:14.440
That was kind of a big deal.

01:46:14.440 --> 01:46:16.000
That's just a little thing.

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:17.000
Yeah.

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:18.000
An incident.

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:19.000
What was sort of a thing?

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:22.320
A performance improvement plan was put in his file.

01:46:22.320 --> 01:46:27.400
AKA the punishment basement.

01:46:27.400 --> 01:46:28.400
He was pipped.

01:46:28.660 --> 01:46:31.620
And Black Wolf wants to clarify, he didn't create the memes.

01:46:31.620 --> 01:46:33.340
He gave the money to the people who made the meme.

01:46:33.340 --> 01:46:34.340
Sorry.

01:46:34.340 --> 01:46:35.340
I thought I had made that clear.

01:46:35.340 --> 01:46:38.820
Well, he's still responsible for their inception.

01:46:38.820 --> 01:46:45.880
So he, he, he gave them the, the, the markers, I guess you could say, anyway, anyway, anyway,

01:46:45.880 --> 01:46:46.880
what else was there?

01:46:46.880 --> 01:46:47.880
That's it.

01:46:47.880 --> 01:46:49.880
No, I thought that was, oh, I thought,

01:46:49.880 --> 01:46:50.880
It's your turn.

01:46:50.880 --> 01:46:51.880
Is it?

01:46:51.880 --> 01:46:52.880
It's your turn.

01:46:52.880 --> 01:46:53.880
All right, fine.

01:46:53.880 --> 01:46:57.300
We can talk about destiny too, because yeah, no, you're right.

01:46:57.300 --> 01:46:59.960
Destiny 2 finally got confirmed this week.

01:46:59.960 --> 01:47:00.960
Yay.

01:47:00.960 --> 01:47:02.640
You know, it was already kind of leaked last week.

01:47:02.640 --> 01:47:06.840
I think there were some posters that were around out there.

01:47:06.840 --> 01:47:12.760
But anyway, there's a destiny 2 is being confirmed and there's some actual artwork for the game

01:47:12.760 --> 01:47:15.560
that's now out there as well as a trailer and so forth.

01:47:15.560 --> 01:47:19.640
So a lot of folks that are getting hyped for destiny 2.

01:47:19.640 --> 01:47:26.120
Also you will not again be able to carry over the exact same characters.

01:47:26.140 --> 01:47:31.700
But the other big news about destiny 2, you are going to get to play this on PC.

01:47:31.700 --> 01:47:35.740
Destiny 2 will be out for PC, which means it's keyboard and mouse time.

01:47:35.740 --> 01:47:40.260
So that's going to be pretty exciting because for first person shooters, you know, it's

01:47:40.260 --> 01:47:43.500
funny because I think if I were to go back 10 years on this show, there was a point where

01:47:43.500 --> 01:47:45.620
I was like, oh, controllers are still really good.

01:47:45.620 --> 01:47:49.460
But I think just something has evolved over the years and like keyboard and mouse, I like,

01:47:49.460 --> 01:47:51.180
that's the only way I could play shooters.

01:47:51.180 --> 01:47:56.020
Like well, I play Overwatch on PS4, but I'm better at it on PC.

01:47:56.160 --> 01:47:59.620
Of course, so is everybody else, but you know.

01:47:59.620 --> 01:48:05.460
I found that the pistol works just like a sniper rifle if you put the shot on the scope

01:48:05.460 --> 01:48:06.460
on it.

01:48:06.460 --> 01:48:07.960
So that's how I've been playing through the whole thing of Andromeda.

01:48:07.960 --> 01:48:08.960
Oh, over Andromeda.

01:48:08.960 --> 01:48:09.960
Yeah.

01:48:09.960 --> 01:48:10.960
Yeah.

01:48:10.960 --> 01:48:12.880
It's been especially good to have that fine control on a mouse.

01:48:12.880 --> 01:48:17.000
Andromeda multiplayer is hard with the controller for me because I can't get headshots.

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:18.280
It's just, it's hard.

01:48:18.280 --> 01:48:23.560
I have to play like people that can do pew pew fire lasers and things that like space

01:48:23.560 --> 01:48:24.980
magic all the way.

01:48:24.980 --> 01:48:25.980
Space magic.

01:48:26.040 --> 01:48:29.320
So on PC, I'll be able to be a little more accurate.

01:48:29.320 --> 01:48:35.840
So I'm, I have to say, even I myself, I'm interested when it comes to PC.

01:48:35.840 --> 01:48:40.720
I want to hear a little more about what the expansions are going to look like for destiny

01:48:40.720 --> 01:48:44.320
because that destiny too, because that's where I got a little turned off on the first game

01:48:44.320 --> 01:48:47.820
is that then it was like every few months, it's like, you have to have this expansion.

01:48:47.820 --> 01:48:49.080
You have to have this expansion.

01:48:49.080 --> 01:48:52.960
And now there's this other thing and it's like, I kind of, I kind of fell off the wagon

01:48:52.980 --> 01:48:59.060
at some point and didn't really fucking feel like getting back on, you know, and the, the,

01:48:59.060 --> 01:49:02.940
there wasn't really, I feel like the way they were trying to sell it too was weird.

01:49:02.940 --> 01:49:08.860
Like, well, we're not going to sell just a catch up pack, but we'll sell a destiny plus

01:49:08.860 --> 01:49:12.060
this is like, they want to resell me stuff I already bought.

01:49:12.060 --> 01:49:17.780
And I'm like, no, it was one of the, it was one of the poorest executions when it came

01:49:17.780 --> 01:49:18.860
to the downloaded content.

01:49:18.860 --> 01:49:22.460
Cause I barely had, as I, I loved the first destiny.

01:49:22.460 --> 01:49:25.880
I really, you know, the, the just the basic of it then right.

01:49:25.880 --> 01:49:27.560
You know, I'm taking King.

01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:32.480
So then I got to taking King cause I heard it was a massive improvement over, um, the,

01:49:32.480 --> 01:49:35.360
the initial destiny and I'm like, okay, great.

01:49:35.360 --> 01:49:40.040
So, you know, I got out on a deal, I sold my other destiny game and we knew everything

01:49:40.040 --> 01:49:41.040
was great.

01:49:41.040 --> 01:49:45.560
And just to only find out what six months later, if that rise of iron and I'm like,

01:49:45.560 --> 01:49:48.680
you know, I'm like, okay, how much is that going to cost?

01:49:48.680 --> 01:49:52.980
And then $30 just for the excess said whole.

01:49:52.980 --> 01:49:59.780
So I start cursing in Spanish in my head and I'm like, but I just, I just spent 40 on right

01:49:59.780 --> 01:50:03.060
on, on taking King destiny and taking King.

01:50:03.060 --> 01:50:08.220
And you know, and now I need rise of iron and which I heard was terrible, um, with the,

01:50:08.220 --> 01:50:13.080
with a few exceptions, but you know, as a developer, you know, if you're a developer

01:50:13.080 --> 01:50:17.100
out there, indie AAA, cut the shit with that already.

01:50:17.100 --> 01:50:18.100
Stop.

01:50:18.100 --> 01:50:21.600
You, you, you, you know, cause now they've announced destiny too.

01:50:21.600 --> 01:50:26.280
And now, you know, this whole hundred dollar pre-order thing, you know, to get both doc

01:50:26.280 --> 01:50:31.400
to get, you know, pre-ordered the downloaded packs, you know, the DLC for that as well.

01:50:31.400 --> 01:50:36.520
And you know, you really want to create this fault line between your cut, you know, in

01:50:36.520 --> 01:50:38.040
your customers.

01:50:38.040 --> 01:50:39.680
That's going to be the way to do it.

01:50:39.680 --> 01:50:45.880
And it just, just off, cause I remember meeting a few people who made that game and they expressed

01:50:45.880 --> 01:50:51.380
just, just, just acidic disdain for those business decisions behind.

01:50:51.380 --> 01:50:56.560
There was also, remember when the game first came out, there were all these rumblings about

01:50:56.560 --> 01:50:59.820
they fucking re hit the reset button on that game.

01:50:59.820 --> 01:51:03.980
Like two years ago, it was, it's found at the farm has he 15 had a very similar path

01:51:03.980 --> 01:51:04.980
of fantasy.

01:51:04.980 --> 01:51:07.920
Is that destiny was supposed to be something like completely different.

01:51:07.920 --> 01:51:10.940
And then they hit the reset button and then it's like, we have to fucking get a game out

01:51:10.940 --> 01:51:11.940
and it's happening now.

01:51:11.940 --> 01:51:14.080
And you could even feel it when you're playing the game, you're like, there's this whole

01:51:14.080 --> 01:51:15.080
rich story.

01:51:15.080 --> 01:51:18.000
And then all of a sudden the story just kind of just stops for the last half of the game.

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.500
And then that's it, but up, up, up, up.

01:51:20.500 --> 01:51:24.240
That's like, what the fuck was that?

01:51:24.240 --> 01:51:26.920
And that's one of my other biggest pet peeves with that.

01:51:26.920 --> 01:51:32.880
Don't don't, don't, don't sell me this massively expansive game, you know, where, you know,

01:51:32.880 --> 01:51:37.140
you're going to have all these unique story experiences, you know, buzzword after buzzword

01:51:37.140 --> 01:51:41.520
after buzzword only for me to find out that, Oh, in order to find out more about who you

01:51:41.520 --> 01:51:47.460
just killed and who's with you now, you know, here's a card, which you can't look at until

01:51:47.460 --> 01:51:52.720
you go on our website, F off because like, I'm here playing on console, you know, and

01:51:52.720 --> 01:51:54.600
I was saying like, you didn't even make it for PC.

01:51:54.600 --> 01:51:58.320
And you want to tell me to go online to look at a stupid car so I can find out who I killed

01:51:58.320 --> 01:52:00.760
and why get out of here with that nonsense.

01:52:00.760 --> 01:52:03.600
So I'm good.

01:52:03.600 --> 01:52:06.760
I I'm interested in destiny two on PC.

01:52:06.760 --> 01:52:10.000
If it's clear that they're going to take a different path with some of the way they've

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:14.680
done the DLC and stuff, but I'm not exactly going to hold my breath on that.

01:52:14.680 --> 01:52:15.680
So we'll see.

01:52:15.680 --> 01:52:16.680
I'm not.

01:52:16.680 --> 01:52:17.680
We'll see.

01:52:17.680 --> 01:52:18.680
All right.

01:52:18.680 --> 01:52:19.680
Moving right along.

01:52:19.680 --> 01:52:20.680
Dark Sakura.

01:52:20.680 --> 01:52:24.000
Well, I have a couple of stories.

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:25.880
One of them is about mad cats.

01:52:25.880 --> 01:52:31.720
Bobby already talked about it, so I'm not going to go too much into detail, but, um,

01:52:31.720 --> 01:52:37.880
mad cats filed for chapter seven bankruptcy and as of March 30th, they started, uh, liquidating.

01:52:37.880 --> 01:52:44.160
So they're basically going to pay off all their lenders ASAP, um, chapter seven.

01:52:44.160 --> 01:52:47.000
The difference between that and chapter 11 is I'm sure we've heard of both in the business

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:56.480
world is that, um, chapter seven, uh, would make you, uh, liquidate and basically vacate

01:52:56.480 --> 01:52:58.520
board of directors and officers.

01:52:58.520 --> 01:53:00.440
It's the death of the company.

01:53:00.440 --> 01:53:02.080
Chapter 11 usually allows for restructuring.

01:53:02.080 --> 01:53:03.080
Yeah.

01:53:03.080 --> 01:53:04.840
Chapter 11 is like Radio Shack right now.

01:53:04.840 --> 01:53:05.840
Right.

01:53:05.840 --> 01:53:11.680
Uh, what's the other, it was not yet Sears, but, but in the coming days it's happening.

01:53:11.680 --> 01:53:12.680
Yup.

01:53:12.680 --> 01:53:18.920
It's a sad, mad cats, as we know, we're co-publishers for some of the rock band games.

01:53:18.920 --> 01:53:22.240
Um, they also made many, many a cheap controller.

01:53:22.240 --> 01:53:25.320
I still blame Hori for their death cause Hori makes better controllers.

01:53:25.320 --> 01:53:28.080
Um, they do actually.

01:53:28.080 --> 01:53:33.000
And I mean in 2016 their CEO resigned, they laid off 37% of their employees.

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:36.040
So none of this should really be a surprise.

01:53:36.040 --> 01:53:40.480
Their stock's been shit basically for a while now.

01:53:40.480 --> 01:53:44.440
So I'm sure that anyone who watches financial markets saw this coming.

01:53:44.440 --> 01:53:49.800
So the other news, which is also shitty news.

01:53:49.800 --> 01:53:59.560
It was stated that as of March 31st, um, a couple of people at Squenix left, Square Enix,

01:53:59.560 --> 01:54:05.520
and that was Yoshinori Yamagishi and Isamu Kamikokurio.

01:54:05.520 --> 01:54:08.040
I'm going to say that Kamikokurio.

01:54:08.040 --> 01:54:11.160
So they have both left the company.

01:54:11.160 --> 01:54:12.680
I was such a big fan too.

01:54:12.680 --> 01:54:13.680
What did they do?

01:54:13.680 --> 01:54:15.680
Yamagishi produced Star Ocean and Valkyrie Profile.

01:54:15.680 --> 01:54:16.680
Oh shit.

01:54:16.680 --> 01:54:17.680
Okay.

01:54:17.680 --> 01:54:18.680
Wow.

01:54:18.680 --> 01:54:19.680
Yeah.

01:54:19.680 --> 01:54:20.680
That is a big deal.

01:54:20.680 --> 01:54:21.680
And then, um, I'm going to say this again.

01:54:21.680 --> 01:54:31.400
Kamikokurio, um, gave a Final Fantasy 13 trilogy, Final Fantasy 15, and the third birthday.

01:54:31.400 --> 01:54:37.440
So both of them resigned so that they can move on to new projects.

01:54:37.440 --> 01:54:38.500
What did he do on 15?

01:54:38.500 --> 01:54:39.720
He wasn't the producer of 15.

01:54:39.720 --> 01:54:40.720
That was somebody that was...

01:54:40.720 --> 01:54:42.200
He was art director.

01:54:42.200 --> 01:54:44.720
Oh, interesting.

01:54:44.720 --> 01:54:49.900
I guess that may be a, just a situation of he had another job that he wanted to take

01:54:49.900 --> 01:54:51.840
somewhere else or what have you.

01:54:51.840 --> 01:54:56.200
Probably not a, cause when you, when, if I hear about departures related to 15, I kind

01:54:56.200 --> 01:55:01.060
of go, I raise an eyebrow a little bit like, oh, but that, but speaking of fucking games

01:55:01.060 --> 01:55:04.540
I need to play, did you know the whole Gladio thing came out this week?

01:55:04.540 --> 01:55:06.020
I haven't even got a chance to touch that yet.

01:55:06.020 --> 01:55:11.660
I have a feeling that they're all doing this sort of Ayn Rand-esque Atlas Shrugged thing

01:55:11.660 --> 01:55:17.980
where all of the best developers go move to their own island and then just do menial work.

01:55:17.980 --> 01:55:23.460
Okay, and by the way, Atlas Shrugged was a crappy book, but it has become my example

01:55:23.460 --> 01:55:27.300
for people bringing themselves out of the limelight and leaving their jobs.

01:55:27.300 --> 01:55:32.020
I'm really curious to hear who's going to get put on Final Fantasy 16, cause you know

01:55:32.020 --> 01:55:33.020
it's coming.

01:55:33.020 --> 01:55:34.020
You?

01:55:34.020 --> 01:55:35.020
They're going to have me do it.

01:55:35.020 --> 01:55:36.020
Calamity Jamie presents.

01:55:36.020 --> 01:55:42.500
I'm just going to be like, that character needs more straps on his shorts and one leg

01:55:42.500 --> 01:55:47.020
should be longer than the other and there need to be more buckles on the shirt.

01:55:47.020 --> 01:55:50.440
So he needs to look very, very pretty.

01:55:50.440 --> 01:55:53.780
Also Eris will be back so I can kill her again.

01:55:53.780 --> 01:55:58.900
This guy needs a bigger fro cause I'm thinking of what's his face from 13.

01:55:58.900 --> 01:55:59.900
Sazh.

01:55:59.900 --> 01:56:00.900
That had the bird.

01:56:00.900 --> 01:56:01.900
Yeah.

01:56:01.900 --> 01:56:04.340
And this one needs a bird cage in his fro.

01:56:04.340 --> 01:56:10.940
Like kind of like a pre-French Revolution-esque wig that had all of that stuff in there.

01:56:10.940 --> 01:56:11.940
Yes.

01:56:11.940 --> 01:56:12.940
Yes.

01:56:12.940 --> 01:56:13.940
This guy needs to be gay.

01:56:14.940 --> 01:56:16.940
This is okay.

01:56:16.940 --> 01:56:17.940
Okay.

01:56:17.940 --> 01:56:23.940
That's me as a game designer.

01:56:23.940 --> 01:56:27.140
I'd be a good character designer.

01:56:27.140 --> 01:56:33.780
There are rumors and this could just be fanwank, but there's some rumors that Naoki Yoshida

01:56:33.780 --> 01:56:38.820
could be the one that ends up doing 16 and it's his reward for basically saving the fucking

01:56:38.820 --> 01:56:45.220
franchise because Naoki Yoshida is the one that did Final Fantasy 14 A Realm Reborn.

01:56:45.220 --> 01:56:51.020
So he's the one that took 1.0 and then made the new 2.0 and basically saved the entire

01:56:51.020 --> 01:56:52.700
fucking day.

01:56:52.700 --> 01:56:56.140
So there's rumors that he's going to, I mean, they're just rumors.

01:56:56.140 --> 01:56:58.940
There's rumors that he's going to get to do a single player Final Fantasy game.

01:56:58.940 --> 01:57:03.900
And I, that would be, I would be huge and I would be really fucking excited if that's

01:57:03.900 --> 01:57:04.900
the case.

01:57:04.900 --> 01:57:08.780
I mean, I would hope that 14 gets left in good hands while he has time to go do that.

01:57:08.780 --> 01:57:11.940
But, um, I would be really fucking excited about that if that happened.

01:57:11.940 --> 01:57:14.500
Oh, and yes, Reginator, one character will have more strap-ons.

01:57:14.500 --> 01:57:16.300
Oh God.

01:57:16.300 --> 01:57:17.300
Moving on.

01:57:17.300 --> 01:57:22.180
Speaking, oh, speaking of Final Fantasy 14, gosh, it wasn't supposed to be a segue, but

01:57:22.180 --> 01:57:23.180
it worked out.

01:57:23.180 --> 01:57:26.260
Final Fantasy 14 has expanded the free trial program.

01:57:26.260 --> 01:57:30.960
So, uh, you can now, if you've never played Final Fantasy 14 before, you can now play

01:57:30.960 --> 01:57:36.340
up to level 35 as opposed to level 20, you can play up to level 35 with no time restriction

01:57:36.340 --> 01:57:37.340
now.

01:57:37.340 --> 01:57:38.340
So you're not limited to 14 days.

01:57:38.900 --> 01:57:40.220
You can play as long as you want.

01:57:40.220 --> 01:57:43.740
However, you do not get to join free companies.

01:57:43.740 --> 01:57:46.140
You can join parties and link shells, but not free companies.

01:57:46.140 --> 01:57:48.420
Um, so yeah, you can check that out.

01:57:48.420 --> 01:57:52.100
That is all of course, to try to get more pre-orders in for Stormblood, Stormblood will

01:57:52.100 --> 01:57:54.100
be coming out over the summer.

01:57:54.100 --> 01:57:56.140
Those free companies ain't free.

01:57:56.140 --> 01:58:01.220
Um, but what's also interesting, the move that 14 is making is that, um, once Stormblood

01:58:01.220 --> 01:58:05.280
comes out, they are not going to sell the Heavensward expansion any longer.

01:58:05.280 --> 01:58:07.540
It will just be looped right into the base game.

01:58:08.140 --> 01:58:11.420
This took Blizzard some time to do with World of Warcraft.

01:58:11.420 --> 01:58:13.780
Although to be fair, I believe they do it now.

01:58:13.780 --> 01:58:17.500
I believe there's Legion and there's everything up to Legion.

01:58:17.500 --> 01:58:21.340
So, um, but for a while you kind of had to buy like two or three expansions to get current.

01:58:21.340 --> 01:58:25.060
But, um, yeah, you won't have to do that with Final Fantasy 14.

01:58:25.060 --> 01:58:26.060
So that's pretty cool.

01:58:26.060 --> 01:58:29.420
Uh, and they're not going to like, they're not going to suddenly charge you more money

01:58:29.420 --> 01:58:32.260
or anything like it's just going to be Heavensward will just be included in the cost of the base

01:58:32.260 --> 01:58:33.260
game.

01:58:33.260 --> 01:58:34.260
It's just all right there.

01:58:34.260 --> 01:58:35.260
So that's pretty cool.

01:58:35.260 --> 01:58:36.260
Not bad.

01:58:36.260 --> 01:58:37.260
Not bad.

01:58:37.980 --> 01:58:42.420
The new series is coming to Netflix and yes, this actually is coming to North America,

01:58:42.420 --> 01:58:45.020
but it's, um, supposedly something that's starting in Japan.

01:58:45.020 --> 01:58:48.980
Uh, it's called Final Fantasy, Daddy of Light.

01:58:48.980 --> 01:58:55.500
Now here's the thing, because we can make a lot of jokes about Daddy of Light, um, no,

01:58:55.500 --> 01:58:57.980
I think it's just, I think it's just a translation thing.

01:58:57.980 --> 01:59:01.660
I don't think, don't, don't take the name too literally you guys too late.

01:59:01.660 --> 01:59:02.660
So here's the thing.

01:59:02.660 --> 01:59:08.420
It actually is inspired by a blog that was kept by a father and son where they were actually

01:59:08.420 --> 01:59:13.220
playing Final Fantasy 14 together, but it helped their own relationship out in that

01:59:13.220 --> 01:59:14.580
they were kind of getting to bond.

01:59:14.580 --> 01:59:17.780
So it was like they played this game, but they were bonding through the game.

01:59:17.780 --> 01:59:22.260
And so it was helping them in real life function as father and son a little more.

01:59:22.260 --> 01:59:23.420
So I think it's an interesting story.

01:59:23.420 --> 01:59:29.240
So it's not directly about Final Fantasy 14, but Final Fantasy 14 plays like a key role

01:59:29.240 --> 01:59:31.220
in the whole storytelling things.

01:59:31.220 --> 01:59:32.220
That's kind of neat.

01:59:32.220 --> 01:59:36.620
Um, so yeah, you can, uh, there is a trailer out there if you want to check that out.

01:59:36.620 --> 01:59:43.900
Uh, yeah, Netflix Japan will get this, uh, April 20th, Netflix Stateside will get it

01:59:43.900 --> 01:59:45.700
this fall.

01:59:45.700 --> 01:59:47.020
I definitely am interested.

01:59:47.020 --> 01:59:48.020
Yeah.

01:59:48.020 --> 01:59:49.020
I'd like to check this out too.

01:59:49.020 --> 01:59:55.100
You may not know, but Netflix does translate a lot of their shows in for other countries.

01:59:55.100 --> 01:59:58.460
So the fact that it's happening this way too, it's kind of cool.

01:59:58.460 --> 01:59:59.460
Yeah.

01:59:59.460 --> 02:00:04.180
Netflix Japan's game is, although actually in Japan, MBS and TBS are getting this in

02:00:04.180 --> 02:00:05.180
Japan as well.

02:00:05.180 --> 02:00:08.380
It's not only a Netflix thing, so pretty neat.

02:00:08.380 --> 02:00:12.100
Anyway, one more thing for you guys, then we'll get to the classic game of the week.

02:00:12.100 --> 02:00:15.260
Let's talk about Call of Duty Infinite Warfare.

02:00:15.260 --> 02:00:20.580
Uh, there is a new pack available this week, uh, which you can actually buy this online.

02:00:20.580 --> 02:00:27.700
You can buy now a multiplayer voiceover pack featuring Method Man.

02:00:27.700 --> 02:00:28.700
That's right.

02:00:28.700 --> 02:00:34.540
The rapper, producer, and actor dials up the intensity, updating you on killstreaks, enemy

02:00:34.540 --> 02:00:39.700
activity, and adding some extra flavor to every multiplayer firefight.

02:00:39.700 --> 02:00:43.740
And so you can actually check out what, uh, oops, there's actually like a YouTube where

02:00:43.740 --> 02:00:45.100
you can check out some of this.

02:00:45.100 --> 02:00:46.100
Yeah, you heard that.

02:00:46.100 --> 02:00:48.100
Thor in position for their submission.

02:00:48.100 --> 02:00:51.100
The atomizer strike, waiting for your word, homie.

02:00:51.100 --> 02:00:55.500
Hey, yo, my G, you got a drone package at your discretion, that means whenever you want

02:00:55.500 --> 02:00:56.500
to use it.

02:00:56.500 --> 02:00:57.500
Gun game.

02:00:57.500 --> 02:01:02.860
Okay, so if you want Method Man barking in your ear at every corner, you can do that.

02:01:02.860 --> 02:01:09.380
Um, the other, uh, pack you can check out is a UK Special Forces voiceover pack, uh,

02:01:09.380 --> 02:01:13.340
which is Craig Fairbrass as Ghost from Modern Warfare 2.

02:01:13.340 --> 02:01:14.340
Let's go to work.

02:01:14.340 --> 02:01:17.340
Care package loaded up and waiting for your mark.

02:01:17.340 --> 02:01:18.340
Nice.

02:01:18.340 --> 02:01:19.340
Remote uplink successful.

02:01:19.340 --> 02:01:23.540
Well, that went pan-shaped, didn't it?

02:01:23.540 --> 02:01:30.540
That I would like to, I just want to offer my services to Activision for a Rob Roberts

02:01:30.540 --> 02:01:32.880
expansion pack for Call of Duty.

02:01:32.880 --> 02:01:36.900
And I think if you guys want this to happen, um, you could actually tweet at Activision

02:01:36.900 --> 02:01:42.460
and let them know you would actually pay $2 for a Rob Roberts, uh, voice pack for Call

02:01:42.460 --> 02:01:44.700
of Duty Infinite Warfare.

02:01:44.700 --> 02:01:45.700
Let me give you a little preview.

02:01:45.700 --> 02:01:46.700
You ready?

02:01:46.700 --> 02:01:47.700
Thank you.

02:01:47.700 --> 02:01:50.700
I was just gonna say, what the hell would you say?

02:01:50.860 --> 02:01:55.860
Don't you know that bitch is shooting at you?

02:01:55.860 --> 02:01:58.860
Get the hell out of here!

02:01:58.860 --> 02:02:05.060
Aim for the head, aim for the head.

02:02:05.060 --> 02:02:07.700
We dropped you some shit, use it!

02:02:07.700 --> 02:02:10.700
When you want.

02:02:10.700 --> 02:02:16.260
Oh my God.

02:02:16.820 --> 02:02:20.820
Let's see, uh, JD says, $2 sold and I don't even play shooters.

02:02:20.820 --> 02:02:24.460
Kaijuto says, I'd pay five bucks for that.

02:02:24.460 --> 02:02:26.820
Act F says, I'd buy the game for that.

02:02:26.820 --> 02:02:29.620
Tiger Claw says, Rob's saying, that's gross.

02:02:29.620 --> 02:02:34.220
Now that would be my mom, then she could be a whole nother pack of that.

02:02:34.220 --> 02:02:43.460
Oh my God, that's gross, did you just, ah, did you, you threw the grenade, that is gross.

02:02:43.660 --> 02:02:47.660
I should get my mother in it, doing the angry Spanish translation pack.

02:02:47.660 --> 02:02:50.260
Oh, now that I'd buy, getting cursed at in Spanish?

02:02:50.260 --> 02:02:51.260
Oh my God.

02:02:51.260 --> 02:02:52.260
Mira!

02:02:52.260 --> 02:02:53.260
Get the wussies!

02:02:53.260 --> 02:02:56.260
Oh yeah, oh please.

02:02:56.260 --> 02:02:59.460
I'm just thinking about what my mom would be like.

02:02:59.460 --> 02:03:12.460
But if it's featuring the true Spanish household parent, then shouldn't the chancla be a weapon?

02:03:12.460 --> 02:03:16.260
We've just alienated the entire listening crowd, but it does not matter because I know

02:03:16.260 --> 02:03:18.060
what he meant.

02:03:18.060 --> 02:03:21.060
I know how to fucking pay attention when my friends talk about the childhood.

02:03:21.060 --> 02:03:25.260
I didn't know what that was until I moved out here too, but I guarantee you in the south,

02:03:25.260 --> 02:03:28.460
the equivalent would be, pick your switch.

02:03:28.460 --> 02:03:32.060
It'd be that belt coming off.

02:03:32.060 --> 02:03:39.020
No, I didn't know about it until I saw Victoria beating her then boyfriend with the chancla,

02:03:39.020 --> 02:03:41.580
and it was actually saying like, do you want to get the chancla?

02:03:41.580 --> 02:03:42.580
Do you want to get it?

02:03:42.580 --> 02:03:43.740
And I was like, the fuck?

02:03:43.740 --> 02:03:45.780
And she explained to me the whole, the whole thing.

02:03:45.780 --> 02:03:46.780
So.

02:03:46.780 --> 02:03:47.780
Oh, that's great.

02:03:47.780 --> 02:03:48.780
That's great.

02:03:48.780 --> 02:03:53.900
The chancla as a DLC weapon, holy shit.

02:03:53.900 --> 02:03:56.900
That's incredible.

02:03:56.900 --> 02:03:57.900
All right.

02:03:57.900 --> 02:04:02.900
And act deft, by the way, who is our listener in Mexico is just eating this shit up in chat

02:04:02.900 --> 02:04:05.860
right now, by the way, just so you know.

02:04:05.860 --> 02:04:06.980
What's up act deaf?

02:04:06.980 --> 02:04:09.140
I almost, act deaf says fear the chancla.

02:04:09.140 --> 02:04:13.780
I almost bought my friend a shirt, the same friend, like a shirt that actually had the,

02:04:13.780 --> 02:04:17.020
and for those that don't know, it's, it's, we call it, this is where you usually hear

02:04:17.020 --> 02:04:22.780
them called thongs because like the flip flop thongs, but when I hear thong, I think of

02:04:22.780 --> 02:04:23.780
butt floss.

02:04:23.780 --> 02:04:30.300
So, but the, the, um, you know, the, the flippy flop shoes, but if you didn't know, you could

02:04:30.300 --> 02:04:33.220
actually beat somebody with those and it hurts a lot.

02:04:33.220 --> 02:04:35.340
So this is wack.

02:04:35.340 --> 02:04:36.340
So yeah, exactly.

02:04:36.540 --> 02:04:40.340
It's the same thing, like getting hit with a belt too, except the belt flutter.

02:04:40.340 --> 02:04:42.180
Just consensual, please.

02:04:42.180 --> 02:04:43.180
If you're going to get into that.

02:04:43.180 --> 02:04:44.180
All right.

02:04:44.180 --> 02:04:47.060
Don't be a bad kid.

02:04:47.060 --> 02:04:48.060
Anyhow.

02:04:48.060 --> 02:04:49.060
Where were we?

02:04:49.060 --> 02:04:50.060
Oh yes.

02:04:50.060 --> 02:04:51.060
Method man for call of duty, infinite warfare.

02:04:51.060 --> 02:04:52.060
Start tweeting.

02:04:52.060 --> 02:04:55.500
Why can't we do our own voice packs for these games?

02:04:55.500 --> 02:04:59.960
Why not in the, remember if you, if you were not aware of this, there is an OLR expansion

02:04:59.960 --> 02:05:02.380
pack for typing of the dead on steam.

02:05:02.380 --> 02:05:03.380
We're actually in the shop.

02:05:03.380 --> 02:05:04.380
Yeah.

02:05:04.380 --> 02:05:05.380
It was something we did for our 600th episode.

02:05:05.420 --> 02:05:06.420
Yeah.

02:05:06.420 --> 02:05:08.020
There's like an OLR DLC thing.

02:05:08.020 --> 02:05:09.020
It's free.

02:05:09.020 --> 02:05:13.020
Cause it's all through the workshop and so you can download and it's all like, like fucking

02:05:13.020 --> 02:05:15.460
years old inside jokes from this show.

02:05:15.460 --> 02:05:19.140
Like like Cylon, occupied Caprica and jokes that aren't even funny anymore.

02:05:19.140 --> 02:05:25.260
Like that you can type in, uh, into the, as the, the, but so Iraqi suicide babies isn't

02:05:25.260 --> 02:05:26.260
on there.

02:05:26.260 --> 02:05:32.340
I think it is, which is again, before Tumblr reports us, it just goes back to the match

02:05:32.340 --> 02:05:34.580
game from long, long, long, long, long time ago.

02:05:34.580 --> 02:05:38.260
So anyway, super pale, better be one.

02:05:38.260 --> 02:05:39.680
All right.

02:05:39.680 --> 02:05:40.680
Can I do a game, Ron?

02:05:40.680 --> 02:05:41.680
Yes.

02:05:41.680 --> 02:05:46.620
Let's get to the classic game of the week before a method man was out of diapers.

02:05:46.620 --> 02:05:47.620
Actually.

02:05:47.620 --> 02:05:53.540
Uh, we, uh, we take a trip back to a classic time when a video games were a little bit

02:05:53.540 --> 02:05:56.460
different and there was no voice expansion packs for games.

02:05:56.460 --> 02:06:01.060
If you didn't like the voices in the game too bad, you could, you, you would do what

02:06:01.060 --> 02:06:06.660
everybody on Twitch does now a day and just recite back the words that were on the screen

02:06:06.660 --> 02:06:08.540
in your own voices.

02:06:08.540 --> 02:06:12.500
That's what, that's what people on Twitch do when they played.

02:06:12.500 --> 02:06:13.500
That's right.

02:06:13.500 --> 02:06:14.500
Read without reading aloud.

02:06:14.500 --> 02:06:15.500
All right.

02:06:15.500 --> 02:06:16.500
Here it is.

02:06:16.500 --> 02:06:17.700
The classic game of the week.

02:06:17.700 --> 02:06:18.700
Dark soccer.

02:06:18.700 --> 02:06:19.700
What'd you pick for us?

02:06:19.700 --> 02:06:23.420
Well, with all this persona five coming out and everyone losing their shit about it, I

02:06:23.420 --> 02:06:30.500
decided to give people a hint into what even led to persona and it was an RPG.

02:06:30.500 --> 02:06:38.640
Back on the Super Famicom called Shin Megami Tensei If, which is in the Shin Megami, it's

02:06:38.640 --> 02:06:45.780
in the Megami Tensei series, but this is the first RPG of its type in the series that led

02:06:45.780 --> 02:06:47.860
to the persona series.

02:06:47.860 --> 02:06:52.500
So this game came out in 1994 for the Super Famicom, which was over here at the Super

02:06:52.500 --> 02:06:57.780
Nintendo and it is of course a spinoff of the Shin Megami Tensei series.

02:06:57.780 --> 02:06:59.580
It's been ported to mobile devices.

02:06:59.580 --> 02:07:04.220
There's a PlayStation port, there's a port on windows, and there is a digital version

02:07:04.220 --> 02:07:06.020
for the virtual console.

02:07:06.020 --> 02:07:12.900
Um, basically it follows a student at, uh, Karakazaka high school after their school

02:07:12.900 --> 02:07:20.560
gets sucked into a realm of demons by a vengeful student's demon summoning spell gone wrong.

02:07:20.560 --> 02:07:26.260
And so, um, it has a really, it focuses on like a smaller environment.

02:07:26.260 --> 02:07:31.920
So within the school in its areas and it actually was really decently received and

02:07:31.920 --> 02:07:39.260
of course it had print adaptations, it had a prequel to it, a mobile prequel, and the

02:07:39.260 --> 02:07:45.700
high school setting basically is what led to the spinoff persona series.

02:07:45.700 --> 02:07:48.620
So know your roots.

02:07:48.620 --> 02:07:58.780
So basically you will, um, take the role of a protagonist, um, it's an unnamed male student

02:07:58.780 --> 02:08:04.700
or you can play a female student named Tamaki Echida, um, that's, uh, in the later series.

02:08:04.700 --> 02:08:11.320
Um, you basically have to explore the school while it's all demon infested and these different

02:08:11.320 --> 02:08:14.120
towers that are based on the seven deadly sins.

02:08:14.120 --> 02:08:21.020
And then, um, you have this little wrist mounted device called comp and you fight demons in

02:08:21.020 --> 02:08:22.600
the turn based battle system.

02:08:22.600 --> 02:08:26.380
You have physical and magical attacks, healing attacks, status ailment.

02:08:26.380 --> 02:08:27.380
It's an RPG.

02:08:27.380 --> 02:08:34.220
I mean, really, but, um, you can also recruit demons in it and bring them into your party.

02:08:34.220 --> 02:08:42.360
You also can get other human companions, uh, and then when your player or your other human

02:08:42.360 --> 02:08:47.620
dies, they get a guardian spirit who can revive them at the last day point and teach

02:08:47.620 --> 02:08:49.740
them new skills and stuff like that.

02:08:49.740 --> 02:08:55.300
So the game, I mean, and the big reason I'm bringing it up is because we now are on our

02:08:55.300 --> 02:09:00.260
fifth installment of the persona series, all coming from Shin Megami Tensei, which I've

02:09:00.260 --> 02:09:05.700
done, um, as a previous classic game, but this one here, I think that this one is the

02:09:05.700 --> 02:09:06.960
one to pay attention to.

02:09:06.960 --> 02:09:11.820
When it came out, it actually was said to have really dated graphics for its time.

02:09:12.280 --> 02:09:13.360
I mean, this is 1994.

02:09:13.360 --> 02:09:20.400
I thought it was okay, but it does kind of look like it's not the best quality wise,

02:09:20.400 --> 02:09:28.040
but the game itself was, uh, so decently received and really opened the door to, um, to those

02:09:28.040 --> 02:09:29.680
future games.

02:09:29.680 --> 02:09:35.080
So, um, the other thing about it too is that it's working title is called Shin Megami Tensei

02:09:35.080 --> 02:09:36.080
X.

02:09:36.340 --> 02:09:42.080
Um, it was where they created that partner system where you could have, um, you know,

02:09:42.080 --> 02:09:45.660
basically creating that with multiple different characters in it.

02:09:45.660 --> 02:09:49.220
And then, um, they had a lot more that they wanted to do for it.

02:09:49.220 --> 02:09:52.700
So of course, a lot of the stuff that was left on the cutting room floor made it into

02:09:52.700 --> 02:09:54.220
future games.

02:09:54.220 --> 02:09:58.940
Um, and some of the music in the game actually had lyrics written for it.

02:09:58.940 --> 02:10:01.980
Um, but you don't hear the song in the game.

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:05.240
You only hear, like, a line of it in the game.

02:10:05.240 --> 02:10:12.800
Um, and then it really was supposed to bring in the theme of reincarnation as it's been,

02:10:12.800 --> 02:10:15.840
it was supposed to be something that was part of the Shin Megami Tensei series, but didn't

02:10:15.840 --> 02:10:22.600
have much representation, um, so that you could keep enjoying the game after you died

02:10:22.600 --> 02:10:23.600
in battle.

02:10:23.600 --> 02:10:26.160
And you also had lifeboats for people who die in battle.

02:10:26.160 --> 02:10:27.160
It's kind of interesting.

02:10:27.160 --> 02:10:31.200
The other thing that's cool is if you are a Japanese baseball fan, um, three of the

02:10:31.220 --> 02:10:38.820
characters in the games were named after pitchers for the, um, uh, Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters.

02:10:38.820 --> 02:10:44.460
Um, so, which is actually, like, one of the three baseball teams I know about over there.

02:10:44.460 --> 02:10:49.060
There's like them, the Bay Stars, and the Yakult Swallows, which I think is also funny

02:10:49.060 --> 02:10:52.300
that they're called the Swallows because you drink Yakult.

02:10:52.300 --> 02:10:53.300
Go fig.

02:10:53.300 --> 02:11:00.200
Anyway, um, there was, uh, one of the characters, Akira, his transformation was based off of

02:11:00.200 --> 02:11:01.200
Devilman.

02:11:01.200 --> 02:11:03.440
If anyone's ever seen that.

02:11:03.440 --> 02:11:08.300
It was, um, by the guy who did Cutie Honey.

02:11:08.300 --> 02:11:14.460
It was a dude who gets basically turned into a demon, so, um, Gonagai, that was his name.

02:11:14.460 --> 02:11:20.860
Um, and you know, another character was, uh, based off of a character from Black Jack there.

02:11:20.860 --> 02:11:27.700
You know, so there's lots of influences from just general anime and pop culture and sports

02:11:27.700 --> 02:11:30.640
history all thrown into the game.

02:11:30.640 --> 02:11:37.600
So, um, it came out on October 28th, 1994, and had a re-release on December 26th, 2002

02:11:37.600 --> 02:11:38.600
for PlayStation.

02:11:38.600 --> 02:11:45.320
Um, I almost liked the PlayStation version, but I wanted the SNES music, so.

02:11:45.320 --> 02:11:50.360
The music they did for the PlayStation one is actually pretty good, so.

02:11:50.360 --> 02:11:55.320
Um, there are, of course, like I said, there's ports on it, of it, for Virtual Console for

02:11:55.320 --> 02:11:56.880
Wii and Wii U.

02:11:56.880 --> 02:11:59.200
Um, I think Japan only, of course.

02:11:59.200 --> 02:12:04.020
There was a Microsoft Windows for the iRevo PC in 2006, and then there's an Android and

02:12:04.020 --> 02:12:06.580
iOS version that came out in 2013.

02:12:06.580 --> 02:12:11.660
Um, and that is also the first mobile version of the game.

02:12:11.660 --> 02:12:18.140
And then there came another game on April 22nd, 2004 called Shin Megami Tensei Ith Hazama's

02:12:18.140 --> 02:12:19.140
Chapter.

02:12:19.140 --> 02:12:26.200
Um, and that was for the FOMA 900i mobile phones, and it's a prologue to this game.

02:12:26.200 --> 02:12:30.100
So it basically is whatever the character Hazama did right before the incident went

02:12:30.100 --> 02:12:31.100
down.

02:12:31.100 --> 02:12:35.780
And they offered a limited edition ROM cartridge- Oh, sorry.

02:12:35.780 --> 02:12:39.740
They wanted to do a limited edition ROM cartridge of the game, but their budget did not let

02:12:39.740 --> 02:12:40.980
it happen.

02:12:40.980 --> 02:12:46.420
So basically after this, like I said, there were many, many other, um, iterations of the

02:12:46.420 --> 02:12:47.420
story that came out.

02:12:47.420 --> 02:12:53.260
There was the manga, which was, um, Shin Megami Tensei Ith School of the Demon Messenger.

02:12:53.260 --> 02:12:58.960
Um, uh, there actually got translated into French.

02:12:58.960 --> 02:13:03.200
Uh, there was another manga that was Shin Megami Tensei Kan.

02:13:03.200 --> 02:13:08.240
And then there was, uh, Shin Megami Tensei Ith Gen of Makai.

02:13:08.240 --> 02:13:16.680
Um, so basically a lot of, you know, the big thing is that the settings for the game, the,

02:13:16.680 --> 02:13:21.320
the high school setting and some of the mechanics that were introduced in this game are what

02:13:21.320 --> 02:13:24.160
led to Persona.

02:13:24.160 --> 02:13:29.440
And so this right here is your Persona progenitor.

02:13:29.440 --> 02:13:35.440
And if they hadn't branched out and made this spinoff, there'd probably be no Persona.

02:13:35.440 --> 02:13:36.440
And that's your classic game.

02:13:36.440 --> 02:13:37.440
All right.

02:13:37.440 --> 02:13:41.220
I'm sure a lot of Persona fans though, probably, probably check this out in an emulator at

02:13:41.220 --> 02:13:43.260
some point just to see, you know, what it's all about.

02:13:43.260 --> 02:13:44.600
I will point this out.

02:13:44.600 --> 02:13:51.080
Apparently accessories and outfits from this game have been featured in, uh, Shin Megami

02:13:51.080 --> 02:13:56.600
Tensei Imagine, and it will be available as downloadable content for Shin Megami Tensei

02:13:56.600 --> 02:13:57.600
Persona 5.

02:13:57.600 --> 02:13:58.600
Nice.

02:13:58.600 --> 02:13:59.600
So.

02:13:59.600 --> 02:14:00.600
All right.

02:14:00.600 --> 02:14:05.600
Shin Megami Tensei Ith, the classic game of the week, a little bit, a little bit thematic

02:14:05.600 --> 02:14:06.600
there.

02:14:06.600 --> 02:14:07.600
Uh, we're going to take a quick break though.

02:14:07.600 --> 02:14:09.000
We got more Orange Lounge Radio to come.

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:10.000
We're only halfway there.

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:11.000
Are you ready?

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:12.000
No, I'm just kidding.

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:13.880
We're going to, we're going to speed up part B a little bit, I think, so we can get through

02:14:13.880 --> 02:14:16.840
the show at a decent hour tonight, but we are going to get to your calls as well at

02:14:16.840 --> 02:14:18.520
Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

02:14:18.520 --> 02:14:20.920
You guys are gonna hang out a little longer with us here?

02:14:20.920 --> 02:14:24.320
Gabrielle studio a little longer with us, we'll, we'll dish a little more about, uh,

02:14:24.320 --> 02:14:27.280
the upcoming event and maybe what else is in store for IGG.

02:14:27.280 --> 02:14:29.760
I want to, I want to pick your brain on what else we might have to look for.

02:14:29.760 --> 02:14:32.960
I know you probably can't see much past next week right now, but if you want to throw us

02:14:32.960 --> 02:14:36.280
anything, what, what else we have to look forward to, we'll talk about that when we

02:14:36.280 --> 02:14:39.840
come back from a break, uh, here at Orange Lounge Radio.

02:14:39.840 --> 02:14:40.840
Don't go anywhere.

02:14:40.840 --> 02:14:47.840
We'll be right back.

02:14:47.840 --> 02:14:53.640
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live tonight, episode number 682 of our show

02:14:53.640 --> 02:14:57.280
for this April the 2nd of 2017.

02:14:57.280 --> 02:15:01.400
Rob Robertson studio with you with Dark Sakura, not Loki tonight.

02:15:01.400 --> 02:15:05.600
He's off for the night, but with us in studio, of course, Gabe and Bree from the Sacramento

02:15:05.600 --> 02:15:09.960
chapter of the IGDA, that is International Game Developers Association.

02:15:09.960 --> 02:15:10.960
Right?

02:15:10.960 --> 02:15:11.960
Did I get it right?

02:15:11.960 --> 02:15:12.960
Yes, sir.

02:15:12.960 --> 02:15:13.960
All right.

02:15:13.960 --> 02:15:16.840
And of course the indie arcade event is coming up this Saturday.

02:15:16.840 --> 02:15:18.080
And when do doors open?

02:15:18.080 --> 02:15:19.480
10 also as well.

02:15:19.480 --> 02:15:20.480
Yes.

02:15:20.480 --> 02:15:25.200
So this Saturday doors open at 10 o'clock, um, online ticket sales end Monday night at

02:15:25.200 --> 02:15:26.200
midnight.

02:15:26.200 --> 02:15:27.840
So save $5, get them online.

02:15:27.840 --> 02:15:31.080
If you're a local here in Northern California, it's only $10 right now.

02:15:31.080 --> 02:15:33.160
So JD get your ticket if you haven't already got it.

02:15:33.160 --> 02:15:36.760
If you're a student listening, college, high school, whatever the case may be, it's only

02:15:36.760 --> 02:15:39.720
$5 for you and kids under 12 are free.

02:15:39.720 --> 02:15:41.960
Oh wow.

02:15:41.960 --> 02:15:45.320
You're going to, I hope you don't get the, the Duggar family showing up with like, you

02:15:45.320 --> 02:15:46.320
know, 20 kids.

02:15:46.320 --> 02:15:49.880
Plus their grand babies.

02:15:49.880 --> 02:15:51.360
I think they live, they live far, far away.

02:15:51.360 --> 02:15:52.360
So you should be fine.

02:15:52.360 --> 02:15:53.360
Yeah.

02:15:53.360 --> 02:15:54.520
Video games are probably against their religion anyway.

02:15:54.520 --> 02:15:56.080
So all right.

02:15:56.080 --> 02:15:57.080
Yeah.

02:15:57.080 --> 02:16:01.040
Um, so in addition to Sac Indie Arcade, you know, we've got developers coming from all

02:16:01.040 --> 02:16:02.040
over the country.

02:16:02.040 --> 02:16:05.160
We even have some people coming in from Puerto Rico, which is weird.

02:16:05.160 --> 02:16:06.160
Yeah.

02:16:06.160 --> 02:16:07.160
That's great.

02:16:07.160 --> 02:16:08.160
Singapore.

02:16:08.160 --> 02:16:12.440
Um, so it's going to be a great time, whether you're a casual gamer, hardcore gamer, young

02:16:12.440 --> 02:16:14.520
gamer, old gamer, we've got something for everyone.

02:16:14.520 --> 02:16:17.600
Of course, OLR is going to be in the house as well.

02:16:17.600 --> 02:16:23.280
The most important thing, our VIPs, we got to make sure you guys are taken care of.

02:16:23.280 --> 02:16:29.000
And um, one of our offshoots of IGDA Sacramento square one clubs is actually getting ready

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:30.640
to open here in Sacramento.

02:16:30.640 --> 02:16:36.220
They, they are a coworking space focused on growing the video game development industry

02:16:36.220 --> 02:16:38.280
here in Sacramento.

02:16:38.280 --> 02:16:42.780
And um, so they sponsored our progressive game jam for the 2016 2017 season.

02:16:42.780 --> 02:16:44.820
We're going to have a special little section for them.

02:16:44.820 --> 02:16:49.180
If anyone's familiar with the game jams, usually it's kind of like a hackathon that takes place

02:16:49.180 --> 02:16:50.660
over a weekend.

02:16:50.660 --> 02:16:54.300
Our game jam has taken place over the course of nine months, so you'll get a chance to

02:16:54.300 --> 02:16:58.420
play demos of games developed in a nine month period.

02:16:58.420 --> 02:17:00.620
Can you tell us a little more about like this?

02:17:00.620 --> 02:17:04.260
Because this shared space thing seems to be this growing trend I see in the tech industry

02:17:04.260 --> 02:17:08.340
because I notice, um, like, uh, when, when you guys invited me, which thanks again, by

02:17:08.340 --> 02:17:13.500
the way, to, to host the T cubed event that with those guys, uh, we, we talked a little

02:17:13.500 --> 02:17:14.500
bit about the success they've had.

02:17:14.500 --> 02:17:18.260
And if you guys don't know the T cube thing, they're, they're not a video game per se.

02:17:18.260 --> 02:17:20.220
They're more one of those like tangible games.

02:17:20.220 --> 02:17:23.700
It's an actual cube that it's, it's, I get the easiest way I can say is tic tac toe on

02:17:23.700 --> 02:17:27.020
a cube, but it's more, it's more complex than that, but you just, you've got to trust me

02:17:27.020 --> 02:17:28.020
on it.

02:17:28.020 --> 02:17:30.700
Um, come play it at any arcade cause I'm sure they're going to be there.

02:17:30.700 --> 02:17:35.740
Um, but that was at that hacker lab, which is more of like a, like a, you know, kind

02:17:35.740 --> 02:17:39.060
of like a computer development space, but they also have, they have like, cause I know,

02:17:39.060 --> 02:17:42.920
um, the gentleman from T cube to talk about, he'd actually crafted some of those cubes

02:17:42.920 --> 02:17:44.020
there at hacker labs.

02:17:44.020 --> 02:17:47.220
They actually have industrial, like that type of technology and stuff too.

02:17:47.220 --> 02:17:48.220
Right.

02:17:48.220 --> 02:17:52.540
So, so this space, this square, square one, square one clubs, I can't help but think of

02:17:52.540 --> 02:17:53.820
the TV show, which is awesome.

02:17:53.820 --> 02:17:57.460
By the way, I don't know if you remember growing up square one.

02:17:57.460 --> 02:17:58.460
Yeah.

02:17:58.460 --> 02:17:59.460
Yeah.

02:17:59.460 --> 02:18:00.460
Thank you.

02:18:00.460 --> 02:18:01.460
Okay.

02:18:01.460 --> 02:18:06.540
I didn't even have to think, Oh, that's, that's, square one needs to play in homeroom.

02:18:06.540 --> 02:18:08.860
I know now, now you're not, okay, okay.

02:18:08.860 --> 02:18:13.420
I'm going to work on that, but tell me a little more about what like a collaborative space

02:18:13.420 --> 02:18:15.340
like means.

02:18:15.340 --> 02:18:21.100
So collaborative spaces in general really invite the community, people from different

02:18:21.100 --> 02:18:26.340
um, whatchamacallit, uh, disciplines to come and work together.

02:18:26.340 --> 02:18:31.220
You can either work in an office or work in the general area and it's kind of like being

02:18:31.220 --> 02:18:32.760
in a coffee shop, but not.

02:18:32.760 --> 02:18:38.180
So your membership provides access to internet printers, you know, beverages that may be

02:18:38.180 --> 02:18:39.180
in the area.

02:18:39.180 --> 02:18:44.480
I think what's really going to define square one clubs as opposed to the other spaces in,

02:18:44.480 --> 02:18:48.100
in Sacramento is that, um, we plan to have a studio.

02:18:48.100 --> 02:18:52.180
So if there's anybody who would like to broadcast from there, there'll be able to come and use

02:18:52.180 --> 02:18:53.180
that facility.

02:18:53.180 --> 02:18:56.340
Um, it's going to be focused around video games.

02:18:56.340 --> 02:18:58.380
Why don't you just roll out the orange carpet?

02:18:58.380 --> 02:19:00.820
I think we're going to have to come on and crash your facility.

02:19:00.820 --> 02:19:01.820
Yes.

02:19:01.820 --> 02:19:05.900
We invite Twitch streamers, podcasters, um, anyone who wants to come and check that out,

02:19:05.900 --> 02:19:09.900
voiceover talent who may want to record something for a call of duty.

02:19:09.900 --> 02:19:10.900
Yes.

02:19:10.900 --> 02:19:11.900
For that DLC.

02:19:11.900 --> 02:19:12.900
Reach out to Marissa.

02:19:12.900 --> 02:19:13.900
Yes.

02:19:13.900 --> 02:19:14.900
Oh my gosh.

02:19:14.900 --> 02:19:19.060
Marissa, our, our pal and just the legit stuff.

02:19:19.060 --> 02:19:22.160
It's going to be a very unique space and of course we're going to welcome other types

02:19:22.160 --> 02:19:28.060
of software developers and such, but um, the Sacramento game development community is finally

02:19:28.060 --> 02:19:29.380
going to have a place to call home.

02:19:29.380 --> 02:19:34.340
We've been bouncing around from coworking space to coworking space and we invite everybody

02:19:34.340 --> 02:19:37.300
to come in once doors open and you guys will definitely be the first to know.

02:19:37.300 --> 02:19:40.660
I want to, I totally, are you allowed to disclose where it is yet or is that still secret?

02:19:40.660 --> 02:19:43.820
It's going to be located in East Sacramento.

02:19:43.820 --> 02:19:45.380
Like what part?

02:19:45.380 --> 02:19:46.380
I'm just curious.

02:19:46.380 --> 02:19:47.380
I'm curious.

02:19:47.380 --> 02:19:48.940
Like really close to your studio.

02:19:48.940 --> 02:19:49.940
Really?

02:19:49.940 --> 02:19:50.940
Really.

02:19:50.940 --> 02:19:53.700
Is it, is it the space that save point was going to go into?

02:19:53.700 --> 02:19:54.700
No.

02:19:54.700 --> 02:19:55.700
Okay.

02:19:55.700 --> 02:19:56.700
All right.

02:19:57.340 --> 02:19:59.780
Cause I know that that was a contested space for a little bit.

02:19:59.780 --> 02:20:00.780
So, okay.

02:20:00.780 --> 02:20:01.780
All right.

02:20:01.780 --> 02:20:02.780
Oh, I'm excited.

02:20:02.780 --> 02:20:03.780
I'm excited.

02:20:03.780 --> 02:20:04.780
Yay.

02:20:04.780 --> 02:20:05.780
Okay.

02:20:05.780 --> 02:20:08.060
Uh, but I just want to point out, Bree, I do love the name, but I'm going to play this

02:20:08.060 --> 02:20:10.900
for you and now it ain't ever leaving your head.

02:20:10.900 --> 02:20:11.900
Okay.

02:20:11.900 --> 02:20:14.700
And this is whenever you walk through the doors of your shared space.

02:20:14.700 --> 02:20:16.700
Oh man.

02:20:27.700 --> 02:20:29.700
It's so nineties.

02:20:29.700 --> 02:20:31.700
I know, right?

02:20:31.700 --> 02:20:34.700
Oh, this was high school.

02:20:34.700 --> 02:20:36.700
It was like, no, Bree, you don't understand.

02:20:36.700 --> 02:20:41.700
It was like sketch comedy about math.

02:20:41.700 --> 02:20:47.300
I don't, I don't think there is, I don't think there is a nerdier thing in existence than

02:20:47.300 --> 02:20:48.340
square one television.

02:20:48.340 --> 02:20:49.340
There really is not.

02:20:49.340 --> 02:20:56.620
I mean, they, they had, it was, it was sketch comedy and it was all math jokes.

02:20:56.620 --> 02:20:59.380
Which me being a number cruncher, I should appreciate something.

02:20:59.380 --> 02:21:00.380
Yeah.

02:21:00.380 --> 02:21:03.660
You need, I don't know if PBS like fucking sells this stuff on DVD to raise money.

02:21:03.660 --> 02:21:08.220
Cause if you know, 45 tries to gut, they're going to, they're going to have to go, go

02:21:08.220 --> 02:21:11.340
deep into the archives to figure out how to keep the blights on over there.

02:21:11.340 --> 02:21:13.660
So you might be able to get square one on Blu-ray.

02:21:13.660 --> 02:21:17.420
So I encourage you to get on that and catch up on math net because they did this whole

02:21:17.420 --> 02:21:22.700
parody of that cop show drag net, but it was math net and they use math to solve crimes.

02:21:22.700 --> 02:21:23.900
I shit you not.

02:21:23.900 --> 02:21:26.860
It was like, no, I'm sad.

02:21:26.860 --> 02:21:34.580
I fucking with you when I was 10 years old, that was like the highlight of my Friday was

02:21:34.580 --> 02:21:38.100
that math net was going to come to a fucking conclusion that Friday.

02:21:38.100 --> 02:21:42.700
And we would find out who fucking stole the baseball or whatever the crime was they were

02:21:42.700 --> 02:21:50.660
trying to solve that night anyway, dark to see a points out.

02:21:50.660 --> 02:21:58.180
Also math, man, the Pac-Man clone, but with math problems, I remember that.

02:21:58.180 --> 02:22:00.060
Oh my heavens.

02:22:00.060 --> 02:22:01.060
Okie dokie.

02:22:01.060 --> 02:22:02.060
Okay.

02:22:02.060 --> 02:22:03.060
Um, so let's see.

02:22:03.060 --> 02:22:04.060
Oh gosh.

02:22:04.060 --> 02:22:05.060
Anything else quickly?

02:22:05.060 --> 02:22:07.380
I know, I know these spaces, this shared space is going to be awesome.

02:22:07.380 --> 02:22:10.820
I'm so like just the networking is going to be amazing there.

02:22:10.820 --> 02:22:15.260
Um, uh, we, we have to figure out like as some type of, I'm just going to like totally

02:22:15.260 --> 02:22:16.260
invite ourselves.

02:22:16.260 --> 02:22:17.260
Okay.

02:22:17.260 --> 02:22:18.720
Ready as some type of like inaugural event.

02:22:18.720 --> 02:22:25.760
I think us and the, the, the game bang and whoever, whoever else, it sounds like I'm

02:22:25.760 --> 02:22:26.760
making fun.

02:22:26.760 --> 02:22:27.760
I'm totally not.

02:22:27.760 --> 02:22:28.760
I love those guys.

02:22:28.760 --> 02:22:29.760
No, no, it's their name.

02:22:29.760 --> 02:22:34.140
Their studio, their studio is fucking off the hook to like, I thought we were crazy

02:22:34.140 --> 02:22:38.320
in our house, but like that guy, they, they, they did, they did some work.

02:22:38.320 --> 02:22:40.480
Um, but what was I going to say?

02:22:40.480 --> 02:22:44.960
Uh, um, and whoever, whatever other Sacramento podcast I'm not thinking of right now need

02:22:44.960 --> 02:22:48.400
to all come do like a super show to like kick that place off.

02:22:48.400 --> 02:22:49.600
I think that would be a fun thing to do.

02:22:49.600 --> 02:22:50.600
That's a great idea.

02:22:50.600 --> 02:22:55.320
Can I just give some props though to our Sacramento game mer community as a whole?

02:22:55.320 --> 02:22:57.400
Because last week was huge.

02:22:57.400 --> 02:23:01.120
Sac town magazine published two articles, one about square one, one about second year

02:23:01.120 --> 02:23:06.760
arcade, um, energy, the e-sports team co-owned by one of the Sacramento Kings.

02:23:06.760 --> 02:23:11.920
They had a halftime show with gamers playing games on the big screen and everything.

02:23:11.920 --> 02:23:17.040
I mean collectively everyone getting together to make something happen, like we're getting

02:23:17.040 --> 02:23:20.900
attention here to our area, to our neck of the woods, and I think everyone should be

02:23:20.900 --> 02:23:21.900
so proud.

02:23:21.900 --> 02:23:26.680
Yeah, no, I mean this is, I, and again, I feel like, like we've, we've kind of like

02:23:26.680 --> 02:23:31.200
literally watched this grow from you guys being here two years ago promoting for what

02:23:31.200 --> 02:23:35.240
was for us the first event, uh, into this now it's like, Oh my God, what's this going

02:23:35.240 --> 02:23:36.240
to look like in 2020?

02:23:36.240 --> 02:23:37.240
What's going on?

02:23:37.240 --> 02:23:40.740
And of course, probably Bree is starting to get a heart increased heart rate thinking

02:23:40.740 --> 02:23:46.800
about three years down the line, but all right, uh, let's see.

02:23:46.800 --> 02:23:47.800
Yeah.

02:23:47.800 --> 02:23:49.760
Brad from pop culture says you obviously haven't seen our studio.

02:23:49.760 --> 02:23:51.400
No, I mean, I've seen, I've seen pictures.

02:23:51.400 --> 02:23:53.680
Some of you, some of y'all are really dedicated to your craft.

02:23:53.680 --> 02:23:54.680
Not that we aren't.

02:23:54.680 --> 02:23:58.240
I'm just saying it's just like, I'm really impressed when I went over cause I did, I

02:23:58.240 --> 02:23:59.240
did their show.

02:23:59.240 --> 02:24:00.240
It was a while ago now.

02:24:00.240 --> 02:24:01.240
It was probably about a good six months ago.

02:24:01.240 --> 02:24:02.320
It was right around the time they were here.

02:24:02.320 --> 02:24:04.600
I did their show and I remember walking in their room.

02:24:04.600 --> 02:24:06.840
Have you, have you been over to their studio?

02:24:06.840 --> 02:24:09.240
It's I'm like, wow, you went full conversion.

02:24:09.240 --> 02:24:10.680
You, you committed here.

02:24:10.680 --> 02:24:14.680
Like in our place, it's like, it's still kind of half a living room.

02:24:14.680 --> 02:24:19.920
Like if I ever had a grandma over or something, I could like put draperies on things and things

02:24:19.920 --> 02:24:20.920
would be hidden.

02:24:20.920 --> 02:24:25.600
Like, so it wouldn't be so obvious that fucking nerds are here, but like that was, that was

02:24:25.600 --> 02:24:28.240
full on commit like in their, in their space.

02:24:28.240 --> 02:24:29.480
So props to them.

02:24:29.480 --> 02:24:30.480
All right.

02:24:30.480 --> 02:24:32.200
Anyhow, uh, we want to move on.

02:24:32.200 --> 02:24:36.260
We got to get to, um, some release dates, talk about, uh, what's coming up in stores

02:24:36.260 --> 02:24:39.480
this week and we're going to get to our mailbag as well.

02:24:39.480 --> 02:24:41.940
So dark soccer, what's coming up in stores this week?

02:24:41.940 --> 02:24:48.220
On the seventh, we have, um, in the U S we have, um, the Alchemist and the mysterious

02:24:48.220 --> 02:24:56.060
journey on PC, PS4, PS Vita, logo worlds for windows, PS, you know, I'm looking at March,

02:24:56.060 --> 02:24:57.060
Rob.

02:24:57.060 --> 02:24:58.060
I'm sorry.

02:24:58.060 --> 02:25:00.240
Oh, it's April.

02:25:00.240 --> 02:25:01.240
That's okay.

02:25:01.240 --> 02:25:04.340
And of course the one minute I look the other way to go look at something else.

02:25:04.340 --> 02:25:05.340
Okay.

02:25:05.340 --> 02:25:11.800
Um, on the fourth, drawn to death, prop of the rapper remastered persona five, Lego city

02:25:11.800 --> 02:25:17.560
undercover on the fifth paradigm and the seven bullet storm full clip edition.

02:25:17.560 --> 02:25:22.820
Ooh, Lego city undercover was spectacular.

02:25:22.820 --> 02:25:25.160
So love that game on Wii U.

02:25:25.160 --> 02:25:29.820
And now that I have to completely reevaluate all of my life choices, let me go back and

02:25:29.820 --> 02:25:30.820
double check.

02:25:30.820 --> 02:25:35.800
Um, the UK and on April 4th we have enter the Gungeon and on the seventh bullet storm

02:25:35.800 --> 02:25:38.520
full clip edition.

02:25:38.520 --> 02:25:40.760
You're just now getting entered to the Gungeon over in the UK.

02:25:40.760 --> 02:25:41.760
That's a fun game.

02:25:41.760 --> 02:25:42.760
So it's a rerelease.

02:25:42.760 --> 02:25:44.440
Oh, it's like a remastered one.

02:25:44.440 --> 02:25:50.000
They just cause, um, it was also on the American releases as I just said, sorry about that.

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:51.000
I hear you.

02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:52.960
Well, let's go to Japan right now.

02:25:52.960 --> 02:25:53.960
Get on a plane.

02:25:53.960 --> 02:25:55.800
Um, BRB over in Japan.

02:25:55.800 --> 02:25:56.800
Now this is interesting.

02:25:56.800 --> 02:26:01.200
There's not a really a huge game release that I see any way on the PlayStation four this

02:26:01.200 --> 02:26:02.200
week.

02:26:02.200 --> 02:26:07.480
Um, but they are getting an actual kingdom hearts, 15th anniversary PlayStation four.

02:26:07.480 --> 02:26:11.160
So like you can actually get the system and it's decked out and all the little symbols

02:26:11.160 --> 02:26:14.280
doesn't like have a giant Sora or anything, but it's got all the little symbols and all

02:26:14.280 --> 02:26:15.280
that stuff on it.

02:26:15.280 --> 02:26:20.160
So, um, that's, uh, that's a really nice looking piece of technology.

02:26:20.160 --> 02:26:22.720
Uh, Vita doesn't really have anything this week either.

02:26:22.720 --> 02:26:24.640
I think it's kind of a slower week over in Japan.

02:26:24.640 --> 02:26:29.960
We don't really, um, we have some type of a cover on the Nintendo switch, but I don't

02:26:29.960 --> 02:26:31.980
really see a lot of game releases this week.

02:26:31.980 --> 02:26:34.280
It seems to be just a slower week over in Japan.

02:26:34.280 --> 02:26:39.800
Uh, there's one isolated release on the three DS, kawaii pet to cut us.

02:26:39.800 --> 02:26:46.640
So one neon and mini, mini animal, which it's all, it's not just kitties.

02:26:46.640 --> 02:26:48.640
I mean, there's definitely a neon in there.

02:26:48.640 --> 02:26:49.640
I did it.

02:26:49.640 --> 02:26:50.640
Well, there's definitely a neon right there.

02:26:50.640 --> 02:26:51.640
Front and center.

02:26:51.640 --> 02:26:53.400
It's something like cute animals, something.

02:26:53.400 --> 02:26:54.400
It's cute.

02:26:54.400 --> 02:26:55.600
Oh God, this is so fucking adorable.

02:26:55.600 --> 02:26:56.600
I can't.

02:26:56.600 --> 02:27:00.120
It's like Nintendog, cats, chinchilla.

02:27:00.120 --> 02:27:05.100
That is a bunny, a chinchilla squirrel and an otter.

02:27:05.100 --> 02:27:06.600
There's a hedgie up there.

02:27:06.600 --> 02:27:09.860
So fucking cute.

02:27:09.860 --> 02:27:13.640
So that clearly they cleared the release calendar for two weeks cause everybody's going to be

02:27:13.640 --> 02:27:14.640
playing that.

02:27:14.640 --> 02:27:15.640
All right.

02:27:15.640 --> 02:27:16.640
So that's it for release dates.

02:27:16.640 --> 02:27:17.840
How about the mailbag?

02:27:17.840 --> 02:27:21.080
We're going to get to our mailbag and uh, just so you guys know, we did cut out rapid

02:27:21.080 --> 02:27:22.080
fire news tonight.

02:27:22.080 --> 02:27:26.480
We are trying to end at a decent hour tonight and our first half was a little more than

02:27:26.480 --> 02:27:27.480
half.

02:27:27.480 --> 02:27:29.880
So we are cutting a few corners here tonight just to make sure we wrap up the show in a

02:27:29.880 --> 02:27:32.800
timely manner because some of us have to work tomorrow.

02:27:32.800 --> 02:27:35.960
So we're going to get to the uh, mailbag this week.

02:27:35.960 --> 02:27:41.840
Uh, you guys send us emails, participate at orange lounge radio.com is the place where

02:27:41.840 --> 02:27:42.840
you can send us emails.

02:27:42.840 --> 02:27:43.840
Holy balls.

02:27:43.840 --> 02:27:45.240
Do we get a really long email?

02:27:45.240 --> 02:27:46.240
Yeah.

02:27:46.240 --> 02:27:47.240
No.

02:27:47.240 --> 02:27:48.240
Is it just one though?

02:27:48.240 --> 02:27:49.240
No, you have two others.

02:27:49.240 --> 02:27:50.240
Okay.

02:27:50.240 --> 02:27:52.560
Salutations from across the pond.

02:27:52.560 --> 02:27:53.920
I might've read this last week.

02:27:53.920 --> 02:27:54.920
Check the date.

02:27:54.920 --> 02:27:55.920
Okay.

02:27:55.920 --> 02:27:56.920
The 27th.

02:27:56.920 --> 02:27:57.920
Is it James Nighthawks?

02:27:57.920 --> 02:27:58.920
Yeah, it is.

02:27:58.960 --> 02:27:59.960
Yeah.

02:27:59.960 --> 02:28:00.960
I don't know how.

02:28:00.960 --> 02:28:02.960
Did you also read AZHPs?

02:28:02.960 --> 02:28:03.960
No.

02:28:03.960 --> 02:28:04.960
Fine.

02:28:04.960 --> 02:28:05.960
Okay.

02:28:05.960 --> 02:28:08.960
Hey, oh, well, this one's long too.

02:28:08.960 --> 02:28:09.960
Hey, O.L.R.

02:28:09.960 --> 02:28:10.960
AZHP here.

02:28:10.960 --> 02:28:13.880
I'm currently listening to last week's podcast.

02:28:13.880 --> 02:28:16.600
We all, where you all talk about Mass Effect Andromeda.

02:28:16.600 --> 02:28:17.600
Guess what?

02:28:17.600 --> 02:28:18.780
We did it this week too.

02:28:18.780 --> 02:28:22.560
And notice that Rob describes Andromeda as being a game that could have been a 10 out

02:28:22.560 --> 02:28:27.520
of 10, whereas Zelda can is considered by that to be many, if not for the glaring technical

02:28:27.520 --> 02:28:28.560
issues.

02:28:28.560 --> 02:28:32.680
I feel that Andromeda is a good game that leans too heavily on previous Mass Effect

02:28:32.680 --> 02:28:36.640
games for structure and set up to be a true 10 out of 10 masterpiece.

02:28:36.640 --> 02:28:40.380
Rob's story about the transgender character blurting out, I'm transgender.

02:28:40.380 --> 02:28:45.220
And Loki saying, I think they were just trying to check a box sums up my feeling about the

02:28:45.220 --> 02:28:46.220
game.

02:28:46.220 --> 02:28:50.380
It feels like a paint by numbers game across the board.

02:28:50.380 --> 02:28:54.620
I'm only a few hours in, but the Pathfinder concept seems like they attempted to fast

02:28:54.620 --> 02:28:57.640
forward the human specter concept from the first game.

02:28:57.640 --> 02:29:01.680
It's immediately obvious who your future squad mates will be and what their loyalty missions

02:29:01.680 --> 02:29:02.680
will be.

02:29:02.680 --> 02:29:03.680
Not really.

02:29:03.680 --> 02:29:04.680
One per colony ship.

02:29:04.680 --> 02:29:09.280
And a lot of writers dialogue options make me feel like I made the wrong choice after

02:29:09.280 --> 02:29:14.320
picking it because he sounds so snide and just reiterates I'm the Pathfinder.

02:29:14.320 --> 02:29:18.540
And we got this instead of being a closer to a reflection of what I, the player, wanted

02:29:18.540 --> 02:29:21.340
to choose as it was in the previous games with Shepard.

02:29:21.340 --> 02:29:25.960
For the record, Lady Rider doesn't sound like that.

02:29:25.960 --> 02:29:28.200
She sounds sincere.

02:29:28.200 --> 02:29:32.540
I don't think that more time with the game would have made it a 10 out of 10.

02:29:32.540 --> 02:29:36.960
It would have just made it the same 7 to 8 out of 10 game without animation bugs and

02:29:36.960 --> 02:29:41.200
scripting errors, which at the very least are entertaining to see.

02:29:41.200 --> 02:29:46.000
In a world where this was the first Mass Effect game, this game would have been an amazing

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:47.680
achievement even 10 out of 10.

02:29:47.680 --> 02:29:51.760
But coming off of the first three, and for me personally having loved those games, to

02:29:51.760 --> 02:29:55.800
have this be the long awaited sequel just falls a little flat to me.

02:29:55.800 --> 02:30:03.360
Finally, and sorry for the length of the email, now you say it, Rob noted that he hopes

02:30:03.360 --> 02:30:06.680
that the poor reception to the unfinished nature of the game would not stop a sequel

02:30:06.680 --> 02:30:07.680
to the game.

02:30:07.680 --> 02:30:12.420
EA has noted in interviews that they think of Andromeda as a standalone game with no

02:30:12.420 --> 02:30:13.920
planned sequel.

02:30:13.920 --> 02:30:19.360
I can't find a direct source on this aside from Jeff Girtzman, who has been covering

02:30:19.360 --> 02:30:23.080
video games for the last 21 years and who I consider a reliable source in the game's

02:30:23.080 --> 02:30:24.080
press.

02:30:24.080 --> 02:30:27.960
I just want to say to that real quick, I understand that PR put that out there, that doesn't mean

02:30:27.960 --> 02:30:28.960
I believe it.

02:30:28.960 --> 02:30:32.920
Like, I'm really going to believe that they're going to let the Mass Effect cache egg go.

02:30:32.920 --> 02:30:33.920
Come on.

02:30:33.920 --> 02:30:37.120
Mentioning that he heard this from a press contact.

02:30:37.120 --> 02:30:41.060
This of course does not preclude the sequel from being greenlit, but my guess is that

02:30:41.060 --> 02:30:45.240
not having plans to make this into another trilogy along with a tepid response from critics

02:30:45.240 --> 02:30:48.360
and players would push them in the direction of not making one.

02:30:48.360 --> 02:30:51.880
Sorry again for the long email, just wanted to add my voice to the show and see what you

02:30:51.880 --> 02:30:52.880
all think.

02:30:52.880 --> 02:30:54.000
Yours truly is HP.

02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:55.000
I'm curious.

02:30:55.000 --> 02:30:56.160
I welcome the opinion.

02:30:56.160 --> 02:31:00.120
And honestly, what's interesting about it is AZHP sounds like he's in a place somewhat

02:31:00.120 --> 02:31:02.080
similar to where I was at a week ago.

02:31:02.080 --> 02:31:08.060
So I'm curious, how much time did AZHP spend with the game since writing that email and

02:31:08.060 --> 02:31:10.040
have the opinions changed at all?

02:31:10.040 --> 02:31:14.360
Because the more time I spend with the game, my impression does get more favorable, I think

02:31:14.360 --> 02:31:16.640
is important to put out there.

02:31:16.640 --> 02:31:18.560
Not that that's going to be the same for everybody.

02:31:18.560 --> 02:31:21.240
And certainly, you know, it's the show where every gamer has a voice and there are going

02:31:21.240 --> 02:31:24.700
to be some people that feel that Mass Effect gets no stronger than a seven or eight.

02:31:24.700 --> 02:31:26.320
And that's that's fine.

02:31:26.320 --> 02:31:30.160
You know, and even even if I was saying last week, and this is probably still the case,

02:31:30.160 --> 02:31:33.560
although I think at the end of the day, I'm going to enjoy Andromeda and I probably would

02:31:33.560 --> 02:31:36.880
say Mass Effect Andromeda is probably going to be better than one.

02:31:36.880 --> 02:31:37.880
Not sure.

02:31:37.880 --> 02:31:40.960
I mean, again, I have to beat it to really know, but I'm not sure it's going to outpace

02:31:40.960 --> 02:31:41.960
two or three.

02:31:41.960 --> 02:31:44.680
I still think when all is said and done, two and three are going to be better games for

02:31:44.680 --> 02:31:45.680
me.

02:31:45.680 --> 02:31:50.760
But like, I don't have the flaming hate boner that Twitter seems to have for this game in

02:31:50.760 --> 02:31:51.880
some regards.

02:31:51.880 --> 02:31:56.080
That's the only thing that's like concerning me a little bit is that there's a lot of hater

02:31:56.080 --> 02:31:57.080
aid out.

02:31:57.080 --> 02:31:59.240
My biggest hate was the character creation.

02:31:59.240 --> 02:32:00.240
I mean, really.

02:32:00.240 --> 02:32:05.880
But like, I even sent like a positive tweet to BioWare saying that I really loved the

02:32:05.880 --> 02:32:12.120
rendering of fabric textures in the game, because with my new graphics card, I can see

02:32:12.120 --> 02:32:15.160
the leather looks like fucking leather.

02:32:15.160 --> 02:32:18.880
The vinyl looks like vinyl canvas looks like canvas.

02:32:18.880 --> 02:32:22.660
And to me, a lot of times you can find a rendered game.

02:32:22.660 --> 02:32:26.320
It takes a lot of work to render texture that well.

02:32:26.320 --> 02:32:28.000
And so I was super impressed with that.

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:29.720
I mean, graphically, it's an amazing game.

02:32:29.720 --> 02:32:32.600
I do want to make sure we point out at some point, too, because I don't think it's come

02:32:32.600 --> 02:32:33.680
up on the show yet.

02:32:33.680 --> 02:32:37.580
But BioWare has said they're going to be releasing some details.

02:32:37.580 --> 02:32:39.320
I think it was April 4th.

02:32:39.320 --> 02:32:41.040
So like Tuesday, I think it was.

02:32:41.040 --> 02:32:45.040
They're going to be releasing additional details about what the future of Andromeda will look

02:32:45.040 --> 02:32:46.040
like.

02:32:46.040 --> 02:32:50.520
A big part of it is addressing some of the concerns that have come out on Twitter.

02:32:50.520 --> 02:32:53.440
So like how the Turians are going to eat.

02:32:53.440 --> 02:32:54.440
I don't.

02:32:54.440 --> 02:32:55.440
We don't know.

02:32:55.440 --> 02:32:56.720
Like, we don't know what they're going to address.

02:32:56.720 --> 02:32:59.280
Could it be a DLC announcement?

02:32:59.280 --> 02:33:00.560
Could it be a free patch announcement?

02:33:00.560 --> 02:33:05.040
Are they going to do something like they did with the extended cut for three?

02:33:05.040 --> 02:33:06.040
I don't know.

02:33:06.040 --> 02:33:12.080
So so we won't know till the next show to put out a deluxe upgrade for those of us who

02:33:12.080 --> 02:33:14.120
are strong armed into buying the regular version.

02:33:14.120 --> 02:33:15.120
OK.

02:33:15.200 --> 02:33:16.200
That would be nice.

02:33:16.200 --> 02:33:17.520
So the last email.

02:33:17.520 --> 02:33:20.120
It's called Shane.

02:33:20.120 --> 02:33:21.480
Hello, O.L.R.

02:33:21.480 --> 02:33:26.120
Given recent gaming and movie releases, I feel like we're missing someone's input.

02:33:26.120 --> 02:33:29.360
Any chance Shane will chime in on the show tonight with his thoughts on Andromeda Power

02:33:29.360 --> 02:33:34.440
Rangers or the switch in Breath of the Wild and answer no unless he calls.

02:33:34.440 --> 02:33:38.600
I know this seems a bit of an odd request, but I miss the sassy molassie.

02:33:38.600 --> 02:33:40.920
Sincerely, Ospher.

02:33:40.920 --> 02:33:43.480
Shane, call.

02:33:43.480 --> 02:33:44.480
Please.

02:33:45.680 --> 02:33:46.920
And that's it.

02:33:48.080 --> 02:33:49.720
Dun dun dun.

02:33:52.760 --> 02:33:57.440
Phil Time, Phil Tech, I'm actually texting Shane right now, but I believe they are taping

02:33:57.440 --> 02:33:58.600
Ranger pride right now.

02:33:58.600 --> 02:33:59.600
Well, what's he doing that for?

02:33:59.600 --> 02:34:00.720
Well, here's some stuff.

02:34:00.720 --> 02:34:07.280
Speaking of Zelda, there are apparently going to be a patch for Breath of the Wild.

02:34:07.280 --> 02:34:10.600
Just a little update, but it's supposed to just make it more pleasant.

02:34:10.600 --> 02:34:12.400
Like, what the fuck does that mean?

02:34:12.600 --> 02:34:14.880
Not really anything perceptible.

02:34:14.880 --> 02:34:20.560
And of course, the prop of the rapper soundtrack got released in Japan.

02:34:20.560 --> 02:34:24.480
If some people who are in Japan right now, oh, wait, they're not in Japan anymore.

02:34:24.480 --> 02:34:25.480
Never mind.

02:34:26.680 --> 02:34:30.480
Yes, Spike, Spike is left and Christy is now on her way over here, so.

02:34:30.480 --> 02:34:33.200
She's already over here.

02:34:33.200 --> 02:34:35.520
So I was checking with Shane.

02:34:35.520 --> 02:34:44.160
Well, I could go ahead and also speak of another thing.

02:34:44.160 --> 02:34:49.800
That there's going to be free DLC for Super Bomberman R and that M2 is handling the Seiken

02:34:49.800 --> 02:34:54.840
Densetsu port, so that's also good too, right?

02:34:54.840 --> 02:35:00.080
Yeah, actually, that is great because those other ports they did were good.

02:35:00.080 --> 02:35:06.640
I still want to know if they're going to re-translate Seiken Densetsu 3.

02:35:06.640 --> 02:35:08.520
Did you hear about this, by the way, Jamie?

02:35:08.520 --> 02:35:10.720
Seiken Densetsu collection on the Switch.

02:35:10.720 --> 02:35:14.880
So it's one, two, and three, but it's only confirmed for Japan right now.

02:35:14.880 --> 02:35:17.680
Well, it'd be nice if we got it over here.

02:35:17.680 --> 02:35:20.160
I really like Seiken 3.

02:35:20.160 --> 02:35:22.560
Of course, I also like Secret of Mana.

02:35:22.560 --> 02:35:25.040
The later games were not so much.

02:35:25.040 --> 02:35:30.480
Well, if you would like, I can also move on to one other story.

02:35:30.480 --> 02:35:33.960
Yes, and just so you know, Shane is signing on Skype right now.

02:35:33.960 --> 02:35:35.760
I guess they're done with Ranger Pride.

02:35:35.760 --> 02:35:40.120
Just so you know, Captain Spike was in Japan, so they have not got to talk about the Power

02:35:40.120 --> 02:35:44.280
Rangers movie yet, which is kind of a big fucking deal, the fact that there's a Power

02:35:44.280 --> 02:35:45.280
Ranger.

02:35:45.280 --> 02:35:46.280
Did you see the Power Rangers movie yet?

02:35:46.280 --> 02:35:47.280
I want to.

02:35:47.280 --> 02:35:48.280
It's not bad.

02:35:48.280 --> 02:35:49.280
It's not bad.

02:35:49.280 --> 02:35:50.280
Okay.

02:35:50.280 --> 02:35:51.800
I'm starting to agree more with the people that are saying it should have just been a

02:35:51.800 --> 02:35:53.360
CW TV show.

02:35:53.960 --> 02:35:59.120
No, like for real, some of the CW TV shows are actually like, I really want to check

02:35:59.120 --> 02:36:00.120
out Riverdale.

02:36:00.120 --> 02:36:08.600
CW gave us Supernatural, which I stopped watching in season nine, and they're on season 11.

02:36:08.600 --> 02:36:10.280
My God.

02:36:10.280 --> 02:36:13.680
Can you make sure you have that email up from the person that was questioning?

02:36:13.680 --> 02:36:14.680
I closed the email already.

02:36:14.680 --> 02:36:16.320
Can you bring it back up real quick?

02:36:16.320 --> 02:36:17.320
Sure.

02:36:17.320 --> 02:36:18.320
Please?

02:36:18.320 --> 02:36:23.120
Okay, because I'm going to get Shane on the line here on the show.

02:36:23.880 --> 02:36:26.880
If I could.

02:36:26.880 --> 02:36:28.560
All live radio, but you know what?

02:36:28.560 --> 02:36:29.560
You won it.

02:36:29.560 --> 02:36:30.560
You got it.

02:36:30.560 --> 02:36:31.960
We're willing to give you what you need.

02:36:31.960 --> 02:36:32.960
Hi, Shane.

02:36:32.960 --> 02:36:33.960
You there?

02:36:33.960 --> 02:36:34.960
Yeah.

02:36:34.960 --> 02:36:35.960
How you doing?

02:36:35.960 --> 02:36:36.960
Fine.

02:36:36.960 --> 02:36:37.960
I'm just laying in bed.

02:36:37.960 --> 02:36:39.960
Oh, I'm sorry to wake you.

02:36:39.960 --> 02:36:41.080
I wasn't asleep.

02:36:41.080 --> 02:36:45.920
I was typing up my thoughts on Mass Effect.

02:36:45.920 --> 02:36:48.360
I bet you have a lot of thoughts on Mass Effect, actually.

02:36:48.360 --> 02:36:50.680
Are you going to do an article for VOG?

02:36:50.680 --> 02:36:53.000
You asked me or told me I should.

02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:54.000
I don't know.

02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:57.000
I'm just typing random things about it right now.

02:36:57.000 --> 02:36:58.000
It's no pressure.

02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:01.480
Okay, so we have an email this week in our mailbag, Shane, that you needed to hear.

02:37:01.480 --> 02:37:02.920
So is Jamie ready to go with that?

02:37:02.920 --> 02:37:03.920
Real quick.

02:37:03.920 --> 02:37:04.920
Okay, here we go.

02:37:04.920 --> 02:37:07.760
Given recent gaming and movie releases, I feel that we are missing someone's input.

02:37:07.760 --> 02:37:11.040
Any chance Shane will chime in on the show tonight with his thoughts on Andromeda Power

02:37:11.040 --> 02:37:13.000
Rangers or the Switch in Breath of Wild?

02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:17.120
I know this seems a bit of an odd request, but I miss the sassy molassie, and that comes

02:37:17.120 --> 02:37:18.120
from Ospher.

02:37:18.120 --> 02:37:19.120
All right.

02:37:19.120 --> 02:37:24.160
This is not sassy or molasses or whatever that was.

02:37:24.160 --> 02:37:25.160
Maybe a little molasses.

02:37:25.160 --> 02:37:26.160
Maybe a little bit.

02:37:26.160 --> 02:37:27.160
All right.

02:37:27.160 --> 02:37:30.960
So we actually are having a request for your take on this.

02:37:30.960 --> 02:37:34.440
Now let me start with Power Rangers, because I'm sure you're going to talk about this on

02:37:34.440 --> 02:37:35.440
Ranger Pride.

02:37:35.440 --> 02:37:40.260
So I don't want to ruin this discussion too much, but give us the quick high-level take

02:37:40.260 --> 02:37:42.080
on Power Rangers.

02:37:42.080 --> 02:37:43.080
Hold on.

02:37:43.080 --> 02:37:46.280
You have to keep stalling for time, because I'm switching to my headphones.

02:37:46.280 --> 02:37:47.600
Oh, okay.

02:37:47.600 --> 02:37:48.600
Well, I...

02:37:48.600 --> 02:37:54.400
Rob, let's go to the movie theaters that have the cushy seats.

02:37:54.400 --> 02:37:55.720
Actually Shane took me to those theaters.

02:37:55.720 --> 02:37:56.720
They're really nice.

02:37:56.720 --> 02:37:59.320
Well, I need to go and have someone watch that movie with me, because Dancer's Fuck

02:37:59.320 --> 02:38:00.320
will go.

02:38:00.320 --> 02:38:01.320
I will take you to see...

02:38:01.320 --> 02:38:02.320
God, am I really going to see that again?

02:38:02.320 --> 02:38:03.320
I want to go see...

02:38:03.320 --> 02:38:04.320
Have Shane take you.

02:38:04.320 --> 02:38:05.320
He'll go for the seventh time.

02:38:05.320 --> 02:38:06.920
Shane, will you go see Power Rangers with me?

02:38:06.920 --> 02:38:07.920
For a fifth time?

02:38:07.920 --> 02:38:08.920
Of course I would.

02:38:08.920 --> 02:38:09.920
Awesome.

02:38:09.920 --> 02:38:12.240
And then you can take me to see Beauty and the Beast, because nobody will go with me

02:38:12.240 --> 02:38:13.240
to see Beauty and the Beast.

02:38:13.240 --> 02:38:14.240
Oh, I will go with you.

02:38:14.240 --> 02:38:15.240
Thank you.

02:38:15.240 --> 02:38:16.240
But I also need someone to go to see Logan with me.

02:38:16.240 --> 02:38:17.240
I'm sorry.

02:38:17.880 --> 02:38:18.880
Will you go see Beauty and the Beast, a date movie, Dark Sakura?

02:38:18.880 --> 02:38:22.120
Well, it's not like we haven't had friend dates before.

02:38:22.120 --> 02:38:23.120
Thank you.

02:38:23.120 --> 02:38:25.720
Because Shane wouldn't go, because he said it's something I had to take Alan to.

02:38:25.720 --> 02:38:27.480
That is exactly what I said.

02:38:27.480 --> 02:38:28.480
That is correct.

02:38:28.480 --> 02:38:30.440
I will be your platonic date.

02:38:30.440 --> 02:38:31.440
Thank you.

02:38:31.440 --> 02:38:35.520
See, you can recognize that you can just be friends and go, and it's fine.

02:38:35.520 --> 02:38:36.520
Anyway.

02:38:36.520 --> 02:38:39.760
So, Shane, Power Rangers, what's your quick take?

02:38:39.760 --> 02:38:40.760
And then we'll make people listen to you.

02:38:40.760 --> 02:38:43.640
Well, I've seen it four times already, and I just made plans to see it at fifth.

02:38:43.640 --> 02:38:47.440
I don't really know if much else needs to be said.

02:38:47.440 --> 02:38:50.400
All right, fair enough.

02:38:50.400 --> 02:38:52.360
So stay tuned to Ranger Pride for the rest.

02:38:52.360 --> 02:38:53.360
Okay.

02:38:53.360 --> 02:38:55.800
Switch and Breath of the Wild.

02:38:55.800 --> 02:38:57.400
I love my Switch.

02:38:57.400 --> 02:39:02.680
Breath of the Wild is probably my favorite Zelda game, since I already beat it.

02:39:02.680 --> 02:39:04.880
I didn't get everything in it.

02:39:04.880 --> 02:39:07.560
But it's a really good game.

02:39:07.560 --> 02:39:11.400
But the more I reflect on it, even though I still say it's my favorite Zelda game, the

02:39:11.400 --> 02:39:18.080
more I realize that it feels like there's two hours of content in the entire game, and

02:39:18.080 --> 02:39:19.080
that's really it.

02:39:19.080 --> 02:39:22.080
But I played it for 60.

02:39:22.080 --> 02:39:23.080
Interesting you put it that way.

02:39:23.080 --> 02:39:29.080
Is that just because a big chunk of the game is just finding stuff and exploring, but the

02:39:29.080 --> 02:39:31.720
game might lend itself really well to speedrunning?

02:39:31.720 --> 02:39:33.280
Well, I think it does.

02:39:33.280 --> 02:39:36.600
I think people are under an hour and beating it now.

02:39:36.600 --> 02:39:39.480
And I think it's because it's all open world now.

02:39:39.480 --> 02:39:43.920
You have kind of less of a path that you have to take.

02:39:43.920 --> 02:39:50.440
And the stuff in between story points can be as long or as short as you really want

02:39:50.440 --> 02:39:51.480
it to be.

02:39:51.480 --> 02:39:54.680
For the record, the speedrun world record is at 45 minutes.

02:39:54.680 --> 02:39:55.680
Yeah.

02:39:55.680 --> 02:39:56.680
Naked.

02:39:56.680 --> 02:39:57.680
So...

02:39:57.680 --> 02:39:58.680
What?

02:39:58.680 --> 02:39:59.680
Naked?

02:39:59.680 --> 02:40:00.680
Like the speedrunner was naked?

02:40:00.680 --> 02:40:01.680
The character.

02:40:01.680 --> 02:40:03.680
He's running around in his shorts.

02:40:03.680 --> 02:40:06.200
And yeah, because you really wouldn't be collecting any items, really.

02:40:06.200 --> 02:40:07.200
I would think.

02:40:07.200 --> 02:40:08.200
Yeah.

02:40:08.240 --> 02:40:13.120
You get all of the first few shrines and then you can run on right to the castle.

02:40:13.120 --> 02:40:16.760
I was like, what kind of speedrunning marathons are they doing these days?

02:40:16.760 --> 02:40:17.760
Alright.

02:40:17.760 --> 02:40:20.160
So, but you like the Switch overall system too?

02:40:20.160 --> 02:40:22.160
Oh yeah, the Switch is fantastic.

02:40:22.160 --> 02:40:24.920
I am so glad I have one.

02:40:24.920 --> 02:40:31.320
And I think it's Nintendo's right step in the right direction for the first time in

02:40:31.320 --> 02:40:32.320
a long time.

02:40:32.320 --> 02:40:33.320
In terms of the consoles.

02:40:33.320 --> 02:40:36.040
Can you try to give us the why?

02:40:36.040 --> 02:40:37.680
Why?

02:40:37.680 --> 02:40:41.200
Because it plays to both of their fanbases.

02:40:41.200 --> 02:40:46.800
I'm more of a handheld person, so I can lay in bed and play my console game just laying

02:40:46.800 --> 02:40:47.800
down in bed.

02:40:47.800 --> 02:40:48.880
Or I can take it with me.

02:40:48.880 --> 02:40:53.320
Whereas other people I know still only really use it as a TV device.

02:40:53.320 --> 02:40:55.240
And so we get to do both things.

02:40:55.240 --> 02:41:00.220
And now, for me, what's really cool, and I tried this out when they were doing it during

02:41:00.220 --> 02:41:06.840
the test fire, is that you can, you know, for Splatoon 2.

02:41:06.840 --> 02:41:13.880
I have the capability of making my phone a personal hotspot so I can make that a wireless

02:41:13.880 --> 02:41:18.400
go-to for my Switch if I was on the go and play Splatoon online with people.

02:41:18.400 --> 02:41:20.120
Yeah, that's gonna be awesome.

02:41:20.120 --> 02:41:23.340
I'm looking forward to the, I know you don't do this stuff as much, but the convention

02:41:23.340 --> 02:41:27.000
type stuff where there's gonna be like several people all with their Switches and we can

02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:31.000
all kind of play a game of like Mario Kart or Splatoon or something.

02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:32.000
Yeah.

02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:33.760
Or Fast RMX, which is really good.

02:41:33.760 --> 02:41:35.380
Or Bomberman, which is really good.

02:41:35.380 --> 02:41:39.020
I heard they patched that, so I gotta try that again post-patch now.

02:41:39.020 --> 02:41:40.820
And there's free DLC coming out.

02:41:40.820 --> 02:41:42.140
Yeah, I heard about that.

02:41:42.140 --> 02:41:47.460
I don't know, like somebody must have taken over Konami or something because Konami's

02:41:47.460 --> 02:41:50.140
doing some weird stuff.

02:41:50.140 --> 02:41:53.580
It's almost like they're on the shade button.

02:41:53.580 --> 02:41:56.780
I accidentally closed that tab, all right, that was all right.

02:41:56.780 --> 02:41:59.900
Okay, so now, all right, everybody get your chairs and your air mattresses.

02:41:59.900 --> 02:42:00.900
Here we go.

02:42:00.900 --> 02:42:03.180
Mass Effect Andromeda.

02:42:03.180 --> 02:42:04.500
Is amazing.

02:42:04.500 --> 02:42:10.020
And if I can be, you know, just a little bit critical for a second, like all the critics

02:42:10.020 --> 02:42:14.860
that gave it low scores need to go fuck themselves because it's so good.

02:42:14.860 --> 02:42:17.180
Okay, hold on, hold on.

02:42:17.180 --> 02:42:18.180
I want you guys to...

02:42:18.180 --> 02:42:20.380
You really shouldn't have shut that shade button down.

02:42:20.380 --> 02:42:21.580
No, hold on, hold on, hold on.

02:42:21.580 --> 02:42:23.660
You guys need to understand something.

02:42:23.660 --> 02:42:25.500
Shane doesn't swear, like ever.

02:42:25.500 --> 02:42:29.580
Unless I'm playing Overwatch or Splatoon or games.

02:42:29.580 --> 02:42:30.580
Curse it, Splatoon.

02:42:30.580 --> 02:42:31.580
No, here's the thing.

02:42:31.580 --> 02:42:33.820
Like I'll be like, Shane, it's my birthday.

02:42:33.820 --> 02:42:35.260
Just give me a good hearty fuck you.

02:42:35.260 --> 02:42:36.900
And he'll be like, no, I don't swear.

02:42:36.900 --> 02:42:37.900
I don't do that.

02:42:37.900 --> 02:42:41.740
Do you see that Shane just very casually dropped the F bomb there.

02:42:41.740 --> 02:42:42.740
So he made it.

02:42:42.740 --> 02:42:45.540
And now I have it on tape.

02:42:45.540 --> 02:42:46.540
That's the best part of this.

02:42:46.540 --> 02:42:47.540
That's what you can use.

02:42:47.540 --> 02:42:51.140
You can use that for the voice pack for Call of Duty.

02:42:51.140 --> 02:42:53.860
Yes, exactly, exactly.

02:42:53.860 --> 02:42:54.860
So okay.

02:42:54.860 --> 02:42:55.860
Wow.

02:42:55.860 --> 02:42:59.580
So I just want to say when Shane tells somebody to go fuck themselves, he means it.

02:42:59.580 --> 02:43:02.900
So you are not happy with the critics here.

02:43:03.540 --> 02:43:06.480
I don't understand like at all.

02:43:06.480 --> 02:43:13.140
It feels like now that I'm done with the game for now, it feels like Mass Effect 1 where

02:43:13.140 --> 02:43:18.540
the game starts off slow, but you know, most Bioware starting stories do.

02:43:18.540 --> 02:43:21.500
And then it ramps up incredibly.

02:43:21.500 --> 02:43:26.220
And by the end, like every 10 minutes, my mind was being blown left and right.

02:43:26.220 --> 02:43:27.700
I was like, oh my God, this is so good.

02:43:27.700 --> 02:43:29.140
I don't want it to end.

02:43:29.140 --> 02:43:36.820
And I legit got sad when it was over as like, I need DLC now I need my plans for I need

02:43:36.820 --> 02:43:39.820
to hear about the plans for Andromeda 2.

02:43:39.820 --> 02:43:41.300
Like I can't do this.

02:43:41.300 --> 02:43:45.420
I just spent 75 hours on this game because that's what my total time said.

02:43:45.420 --> 02:43:51.100
With 96% complete, I'm like, I just need more like now.

02:43:51.100 --> 02:43:56.420
Do you think the ramp up or the I guess because the game has a bit of a slower ramp up I guess

02:43:56.420 --> 02:44:01.020
and the fact that EA did that, I don't think it did like, I think that's wrong too.

02:44:01.020 --> 02:44:05.720
I don't think it has a slow ramp up like compared to other EA games.

02:44:05.720 --> 02:44:10.360
When Mass Effect, you go play Mass Effect 1 right now and you tell me besides the fact

02:44:10.360 --> 02:44:15.180
that you're shooting guns in the first 10 minutes of the game, basically how quick that

02:44:15.180 --> 02:44:19.740
ramp up was, it wasn't at all.

02:44:19.740 --> 02:44:23.860
Well you do meet the antagonist on the first planet and you get a squad member shot in

02:44:23.860 --> 02:44:27.660
the first five minutes that you think is going to be with you the whole game.

02:44:27.660 --> 02:44:28.660
I mean, you do.

02:44:28.660 --> 02:44:29.660
I don't remember.

02:44:29.660 --> 02:44:31.100
They look like fodder to me.

02:44:31.100 --> 02:44:32.100
Yeah, well, whatever.

02:44:32.100 --> 02:44:33.100
All right, whatever.

02:44:33.100 --> 02:44:34.100
All right.

02:44:34.100 --> 02:44:35.100
Um, let's see.

02:44:35.100 --> 02:44:36.100
What else I want to ask you about Mass Effect.

02:44:36.100 --> 02:44:38.580
I mean, we already spent a lot of time talking about tonight, so I don't want to spend too

02:44:38.580 --> 02:44:39.580
much time.

02:44:39.580 --> 02:44:45.140
Oh, I know we Gabe and I were mentioning before, um, that whole sequence in the vault, uh, in

02:44:45.140 --> 02:44:48.640
the very, very first vault, and I'm trying to try to say a little spoiler free, but there's

02:44:48.640 --> 02:44:50.780
an escape sequence in that first vault.

02:44:50.780 --> 02:44:51.780
Right.

02:44:51.780 --> 02:44:55.420
And I just thought that that was the moment when the game really started to like pick

02:44:55.420 --> 02:44:56.420
up the pace.

02:44:56.420 --> 02:44:59.940
And that was just, that was just like a graphically stunning that whole vault and everything was

02:44:59.940 --> 02:45:00.940
really stunning scene.

02:45:00.940 --> 02:45:04.140
And then the kind of like the way they did that scene and the pressure that's on you

02:45:04.140 --> 02:45:05.140
in that scene.

02:45:05.140 --> 02:45:07.420
Um, it was like really, really good.

02:45:07.420 --> 02:45:11.140
And I guess that's the point where the demo cut off, right?

02:45:11.140 --> 02:45:16.380
That's before the demo or sorry, that's after the demo cut off the demo cuts off right before

02:45:16.380 --> 02:45:17.540
you actually enter the vault.

02:45:17.540 --> 02:45:21.300
See, that's why I thought that demo did the game of disservice too, because I don't, you

02:45:21.340 --> 02:45:24.740
don't think there was a shift kind of when that whole sequence started?

02:45:24.740 --> 02:45:32.220
No, cause I really, until you get all your squad mates and kind of establish what's going

02:45:32.220 --> 02:45:38.060
on in this galaxy, I feel like that's all ramp up to me.

02:45:38.060 --> 02:45:43.040
And so that, that, that probably takes a good 20, 30 hours if you're doing side quests and

02:45:43.040 --> 02:45:44.580
stuff like that.

02:45:44.580 --> 02:45:48.700
And so, yeah, I just, I don't understand.

02:45:48.700 --> 02:45:50.520
It's my favorite game of the year already.

02:45:50.520 --> 02:45:57.120
When I beat resident evil sevens, finally something did so Zelda wasn't number one already.

02:45:57.120 --> 02:46:00.600
Like when I beat Zelda, I already put it under resident evil cause like resident evil seven

02:46:00.600 --> 02:46:02.680
was way better than Zelda.

02:46:02.680 --> 02:46:09.560
So no, now Mass Effect is taking the top honors and I don't see anything taking that away.

02:46:09.560 --> 02:46:13.360
Um, quickly, we've talked about Mass Effect a lot tonight, so I want to move on.

02:46:13.360 --> 02:46:14.680
That's all I like to talk about.

02:46:14.680 --> 02:46:15.680
I know, I know.

02:46:15.680 --> 02:46:16.960
I'll give you one more thing.

02:46:16.960 --> 02:46:19.000
The multiplayer, nobody's talking about multiplayer.

02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:20.000
Do you have any quick takes on multiplayer?

02:46:20.600 --> 02:46:27.680
It's like multiplayer from three except you can jump around and it leads to some pretty

02:46:27.680 --> 02:46:30.480
hilarious situations.

02:46:30.480 --> 02:46:35.000
Like when you're, there's one time I was playing and this guy died, but he was on the other

02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:39.920
side of the map and my roommate was watching me play and the way I got to him, I was just

02:46:39.920 --> 02:46:43.840
like, cause I'm a vanguard and if you don't know what that is, I don't care.

02:46:43.840 --> 02:46:49.200
But I was charging across the map to an enemy and then once I hit the enemy, my focus wasn't

02:46:49.200 --> 02:46:50.200
on the enemy.

02:46:50.200 --> 02:46:51.200
It was just to get me over there.

02:46:51.200 --> 02:46:56.160
And then I jumped and I dashed to the side like sideways and then I charged another enemy

02:46:56.160 --> 02:46:59.640
that was directly in front of me and then I just dashed without jumping to the other

02:46:59.640 --> 02:47:05.400
side and I got to the, to the squad mate and my roommate was like, wow, that looked very

02:47:05.400 --> 02:47:06.400
like planned.

02:47:06.400 --> 02:47:11.040
I was like, well, I knew what I had to do, but yeah, it looked very fluid and like kind

02:47:11.040 --> 02:47:12.200
of cinematic almost.

02:47:12.200 --> 02:47:13.800
It was really neat.

02:47:13.800 --> 02:47:19.280
And the difficulty versus Mass Effect 3 for multiplayer, I think is no joke.

02:47:19.280 --> 02:47:25.880
Like I think this is a much harder multiplayer, whatever you want to call it, like just much

02:47:25.880 --> 02:47:29.560
harder than what Mass Effect 3 was even on bronze difficulty.

02:47:29.560 --> 02:47:31.040
All right.

02:47:31.040 --> 02:47:35.600
Any other games you want to quickly give a shout out to while you're here?

02:47:35.600 --> 02:47:38.040
With the Switch, I finally got to play Shovel Knight.

02:47:38.040 --> 02:47:42.560
I had not touched, I've never played Shovel Knight until then and I think it's an amazing

02:47:42.560 --> 02:47:47.360
game and if it had come out this year, I probably would put it on my top list as well, but I

02:47:47.360 --> 02:47:50.320
can't because it came out like three years ago or whatever.

02:47:50.320 --> 02:47:53.960
You could retroactively change your list from 2014 or whatever.

02:47:53.960 --> 02:47:54.960
Nope.

02:47:54.960 --> 02:47:55.960
Nope.

02:47:55.960 --> 02:47:56.960
That's cheating.

02:47:56.960 --> 02:47:57.960
Okay.

02:47:57.960 --> 02:47:58.960
All right.

02:47:58.960 --> 02:47:59.960
Fair enough.

02:47:59.960 --> 02:48:01.440
Everybody, if you want to hear more of Shane's opinions on things like the Power Rangers

02:48:01.440 --> 02:48:04.280
movie, check out Ranger Pride available.

02:48:04.280 --> 02:48:08.520
VOG Network.com has the latest episodes and of course they also air here Wednesdays and

02:48:08.520 --> 02:48:09.520
Fridays.

02:48:10.480 --> 02:48:13.480
Because Gabe and Brie are here tonight promoting the indie arcade event, is there any chance

02:48:13.480 --> 02:48:16.080
you're going to come out on Saturday and maybe say hi?

02:48:16.080 --> 02:48:17.360
I don't know.

02:48:17.360 --> 02:48:21.200
I feel like I might have something that day, like sleeping.

02:48:21.200 --> 02:48:22.200
Boo.

02:48:22.200 --> 02:48:23.200
Boo.

02:48:23.200 --> 02:48:24.200
I know I'm terrible.

02:48:24.200 --> 02:48:25.200
Yell at him.

02:48:25.200 --> 02:48:26.200
No.

02:48:26.200 --> 02:48:27.200
All right.

02:48:27.200 --> 02:48:30.240
Or you know what, I might start my next playthrough of Mass Effect now that I have to chart out

02:48:30.240 --> 02:48:33.560
how to get 100% and all the choices I want to make.

02:48:33.560 --> 02:48:34.560
All right.

02:48:34.560 --> 02:48:35.560
We didn't want you there anyway.

02:48:35.560 --> 02:48:36.560
All right.

02:48:36.560 --> 02:48:37.560
I didn't want you there.

02:48:37.560 --> 02:48:38.560
All right.

02:48:38.600 --> 02:48:39.600
All right.

02:48:39.600 --> 02:48:40.600
Shane, take care.

02:48:40.600 --> 02:48:41.600
Bye.

02:48:41.600 --> 02:48:42.600
Bye.

02:48:42.600 --> 02:48:43.600
All right.

02:48:43.600 --> 02:48:44.600
We'll go ahead and open up the Skype line.

02:48:44.600 --> 02:48:47.320
I think it's probably a good segue for us to take some more calls.

02:48:47.320 --> 02:48:49.000
So we'll try to fit in a couple more calls here.

02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:51.400
Orange Lounge, are you okay over there, Brie?

02:48:51.400 --> 02:48:52.560
Don't take him seriously.

02:48:52.560 --> 02:48:53.560
He's just a...

02:48:53.560 --> 02:48:54.560
Yeah.

02:48:54.560 --> 02:48:55.560
All right.

02:48:55.560 --> 02:48:56.560
Orange Lounge Radio.

02:48:56.560 --> 02:49:01.120
All one word on Skype if you want to give us a call or 1-877-GAME-OLR if you want to

02:49:01.120 --> 02:49:03.440
do it the old fashioned way.

02:49:03.440 --> 02:49:04.680
And of course, Gabe and Brie are here as well.

02:49:04.680 --> 02:49:08.040
If you have any questions about game development, tonight is a great night for those types of

02:49:08.040 --> 02:49:09.040
fans.

02:49:09.040 --> 02:49:11.920
I do want to give a couple of quick shout outs here before we jump right into the phone

02:49:11.920 --> 02:49:14.520
lines with some news.

02:49:14.520 --> 02:49:18.080
Speaking of game development, how many y'all out there using Unity?

02:49:18.080 --> 02:49:19.080
Use Unity for yourself?

02:49:19.080 --> 02:49:20.600
I am, as a matter of fact.

02:49:20.600 --> 02:49:21.600
You hear about this?

02:49:21.600 --> 02:49:28.180
5.6 Unity is going to be bringing native Nintendo Switch support into Unity.

02:49:28.180 --> 02:49:31.240
So obviously, Nintendo Switch is a new opportunity for folks.

02:49:31.240 --> 02:49:32.240
There's already...

02:49:32.240 --> 02:49:34.640
Now, Unity can already support Nintendo Switch.

02:49:34.640 --> 02:49:37.060
Super Bomberman, Snipperclips.

02:49:37.060 --> 02:49:42.540
Those were already on Unity, but there's going to be more support, or native support

02:49:42.540 --> 02:49:45.480
I guess, for Nintendo Switch available with Unity.

02:49:45.480 --> 02:49:49.140
These other games were created on an older version of Unity, which was not native, but

02:49:49.140 --> 02:49:51.300
that's just going to make it easier.

02:49:51.300 --> 02:49:52.300
Very much.

02:49:52.300 --> 02:49:54.300
So that's going to be awesome.

02:49:54.300 --> 02:49:56.020
All right.

02:49:56.020 --> 02:49:57.020
Let's see.

02:49:57.020 --> 02:50:00.660
That is what's happening with Unity, 5.6.

02:50:00.660 --> 02:50:01.700
Let's go to the phones.

02:50:01.700 --> 02:50:03.100
It's lighting up right now.

02:50:03.100 --> 02:50:04.100
Let's take a call.

02:50:04.100 --> 02:50:05.100
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:50:05.100 --> 02:50:06.100
Who's this?

02:50:06.140 --> 02:50:07.140
Hi, this is Reed.

02:50:07.140 --> 02:50:09.620
Sorry, got a little feedback there.

02:50:09.620 --> 02:50:10.620
This is Reed Junior.

02:50:10.620 --> 02:50:11.620
Hey, buddy.

02:50:11.620 --> 02:50:12.620
What's on your mind tonight?

02:50:12.620 --> 02:50:13.620
Not much.

02:50:13.620 --> 02:50:18.220
I'll try to make this short and sweet, because your show is already running as long as it

02:50:18.220 --> 02:50:19.220
is.

02:50:19.220 --> 02:50:20.220
Well, you know.

02:50:20.220 --> 02:50:27.300
Yeah, actually, I was going to call in about some sales that I've noticed that I think

02:50:27.300 --> 02:50:31.100
a lot of your listeners may like to know about.

02:50:31.100 --> 02:50:32.100
Wait.

02:50:32.100 --> 02:50:33.100
I got to ask you.

02:50:33.100 --> 02:50:34.100
Wait, wait, wait.

02:50:34.100 --> 02:50:35.700
Because you're all up on all this stuff.

02:50:35.700 --> 02:50:36.860
Here's the one I really want to know about.

02:50:36.860 --> 02:50:43.540
I heard something that GOG.com was taking old CD serial keys, and you could put them

02:50:43.540 --> 02:50:44.540
in GOG.com.

02:50:44.540 --> 02:50:46.900
Is that true, or is that an April Fool's joke?

02:50:46.900 --> 02:50:50.340
Yes and no.

02:50:50.340 --> 02:50:54.840
There's a very limited selection of games that you can do that with.

02:50:54.840 --> 02:50:58.700
I can't remember all that is included.

02:50:58.700 --> 02:51:06.580
I think at least one or two of the old stalker games you can do that with.

02:51:06.580 --> 02:51:10.460
But like I say, it's very, very limited.

02:51:10.460 --> 02:51:14.120
That's better than a sale, because that's getting to use something I already own from

02:51:14.120 --> 02:51:16.220
like ten years ago.

02:51:16.220 --> 02:51:17.220
That's awesome.

02:51:17.220 --> 02:51:19.500
I just want to make sure I was out there.

02:51:19.500 --> 02:51:26.980
What's even better is that I think your show is mentioned before some time ago, but last

02:51:26.980 --> 02:51:33.380
year they introduced a service called GOG Connect, where you tie your Steam account

02:51:33.380 --> 02:51:40.780
to your GOG account, and every so often if they can work out deals with the publisher,

02:51:40.780 --> 02:51:46.340
if you've got such and such game on Steam, you get the GOG version for free.

02:51:46.340 --> 02:51:51.020
Yeah, I had that happen with something I own, so that was pretty cool.

02:51:51.020 --> 02:51:59.540
But even that they haven't done a whole lot lately, it kind of comes and goes in spurts.

02:51:59.540 --> 02:52:04.900
You'll more likely see something happen with that right around the time they have the major

02:52:04.900 --> 02:52:07.220
seasonal sales.

02:52:07.220 --> 02:52:09.060
I steered you off course a little bit.

02:52:09.060 --> 02:52:12.260
What sale did you want to talk about tonight?

02:52:12.260 --> 02:52:17.780
Unfortunately these sales that I'm about to mention are probably going to be expiring

02:52:17.780 --> 02:52:18.780
on Monday.

02:52:18.780 --> 02:52:21.660
Well god damn it, Rage Nator, what am I going to do with that?

02:52:21.660 --> 02:52:28.020
Well, unfortunately those that catch the show on the podcast, sorry guys.

02:52:28.020 --> 02:52:29.300
Let's hear about everything you missed.

02:52:29.300 --> 02:52:33.900
Let's hear about all these great deals that you fucking missed because you're not here

02:52:33.900 --> 02:52:34.900
live.

02:52:34.900 --> 02:52:48.740
Yeah, but they had sales on some of the adventure games, like the best series, they had sales

02:52:48.740 --> 02:52:58.580
and in fact I picked up like the original missed Riven, the sequel and missed five over

02:52:58.580 --> 02:53:06.020
the past year or two, right off the bat right there, they, hang on I'm going to have to

02:53:06.020 --> 02:53:11.500
look at my account real quick to tell you exactly everything that is or has been on

02:53:11.500 --> 02:53:12.500
sale.

02:53:12.500 --> 02:53:24.140
In fact, they had the Deponia games on sale, the Broken Sword series on sale, Back to the

02:53:24.140 --> 02:53:27.540
Future Walking Dead games were on sale.

02:53:27.540 --> 02:53:28.540
Oh there you go.

02:53:28.540 --> 02:53:33.780
I bet Bree would be, if Bree liked the Wolf Among Us and those other Telltale games just

02:53:33.780 --> 02:53:37.020
a matter of time before he gets sucked into all the rest of them too, Telltale's got a

02:53:37.020 --> 02:53:38.020
pretty good formula.

02:53:38.020 --> 02:53:46.100
Walking the Wolf Among Us was one of the games that's on sale and even LucasArts games like

02:53:46.100 --> 02:53:53.220
Day of the Tentacle, yes, in fact I picked that up so, I mean.

02:53:53.220 --> 02:53:57.220
Here's the thing, if you're like, well gee this doesn't do me any good because it's already

02:53:57.220 --> 02:54:01.500
Monday and I'm listening on the podcast feed, here's what you all need to do, you all got

02:54:01.500 --> 02:54:05.980
smart phones, whether you got Android, whether you got iPhone, whether you have a Microsoft

02:54:05.980 --> 02:54:12.660
phone I guess, they all have calendars, so you need to set yourself a reminder like every

02:54:12.660 --> 02:54:16.820
Sunday morning or something, like if Sunday morning for you is at one in the afternoon

02:54:16.820 --> 02:54:24.460
then fine, set yourself a reminder, check Steam Store, check GOG, check whatever stores

02:54:24.460 --> 02:54:27.940
you shop on, you gotta set yourself a little reminder because otherwise you're gonna miss

02:54:27.940 --> 02:54:28.940
shit.

02:54:28.940 --> 02:54:29.940
Because all the good deals are on the weekend.

02:54:29.940 --> 02:54:36.340
Yeah, I was gonna say, yes, I realize that a lot of people out there have the jobs to

02:54:36.340 --> 02:54:44.660
go to, plus they have to worry about family obligations, etc., etc., etc., therefore

02:54:44.660 --> 02:54:50.300
you can't spend as much time on the computer as I do.

02:54:50.300 --> 02:54:58.180
That being said, if at all possible, do pretty much like what you suggested, like pick up

02:54:58.180 --> 02:55:09.900
a date and time during the week, let's say for example, Saturday at noon, check the storefronts

02:55:09.900 --> 02:55:22.860
on both services, then of course, one thing I tend to follow for information on free giveaways

02:55:22.860 --> 02:55:33.060
is this one site, it's kind of a news aggregate for free giveaways, it's called EpicBundle.com,

02:55:33.060 --> 02:55:45.460
in fact, I even follow them on Facebook and they'll let me know, origins giveaway, need

02:55:45.460 --> 02:55:52.820
for speed for free, here's a link to it, you can grab that, or no, Steam's giving away

02:55:52.860 --> 02:55:58.100
the walking dead for free, you can grab that here.

02:55:58.100 --> 02:56:02.860
So I love this, comments in chat over at live.foggenetware.com, actdef says, Ragenator just needs to work

02:56:02.860 --> 02:56:08.420
for CheapAssGamer at this point, Hitstun says, I watch the slick deals front page RSS feed,

02:56:08.420 --> 02:56:09.780
but that's not just for games.

02:56:09.780 --> 02:56:15.380
And these are both good tips, get a Twitter account if you don't already have one, and

02:56:15.380 --> 02:56:19.420
follow some of these, like CheapAssGamer, that's their bread and butter is following

02:56:19.420 --> 02:56:23.820
this type of stuff, and there's other well-known Twitter people out there that like to tweet

02:56:23.820 --> 02:56:28.660
about the sales and so forth, so get a Twitter account, that's a good way to stay on top

02:56:28.660 --> 02:56:35.780
of this stuff too, just don't follow creepos, but you can follow us at OLR, you can follow

02:56:35.780 --> 02:56:40.540
me, my personal account, at Skye, S-K-I-E, I really want to get at Rob Roberts, but a

02:56:40.540 --> 02:56:43.740
fucking spammer has that right now, so if y'all can report him, I'd appreciate that,

02:56:43.740 --> 02:56:48.860
you can follow DarkSakura as well, you can follow Nascent Games, and Bree, you're on

02:56:48.860 --> 02:56:52.700
Twitter as well, right, is that a personal or a business, can I give that out here?

02:56:52.700 --> 02:56:53.700
I'm all out there.

02:56:53.700 --> 02:56:55.700
You're all out there, Bree, A-E-A.

02:56:55.700 --> 02:56:56.700
Yes.

02:56:56.700 --> 02:56:57.700
There it is.

02:56:57.700 --> 02:56:58.700
And follow Sack Indie Arcade.

02:56:58.700 --> 02:56:59.700
Yes!

02:56:59.700 --> 02:57:04.420
You guys, it's really easy, because you guys are really good at like retweeting all your

02:57:04.420 --> 02:57:07.100
stuff, so like once you follow one, you'll get all the others.

02:57:07.100 --> 02:57:08.100
Yes.

02:57:08.100 --> 02:57:09.100
Yeah, so it's very easy, very easy.

02:57:09.100 --> 02:57:12.060
All right, Rage Nator, I gotta let you go, so we can get more calls.

02:57:12.060 --> 02:57:14.140
Sure, have a nice night.

02:57:14.140 --> 02:57:15.140
You too, take care, buddy.

02:57:15.140 --> 02:57:16.140
Yep, you too.

02:57:16.140 --> 02:57:17.140
Bye.

02:57:17.140 --> 02:57:20.620
All right, everybody in chat room giving out their Twitter handles there.

02:57:20.620 --> 02:57:25.780
All right, let's see if we, we can probably squeeze in one more call, Orange Launch Radio,

02:57:25.780 --> 02:57:29.580
all one word on Skype, or 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:57:29.580 --> 02:57:34.540
I wanted to make sure we talked about some movies here before we end the show tonight.

02:57:34.540 --> 02:57:37.980
For one, I know, well it's Bummer, Loki's not here, because I know he's looking forward

02:57:37.980 --> 02:57:42.620
to this, but the Ready Player One film is gonna be coming out in 2018, the new release

02:57:42.620 --> 02:57:46.560
date is March 30th, 2018, for Ready Player One.

02:57:46.560 --> 02:57:51.180
That is a pushback, it was originally going to be this Christmas, December 15th, in time

02:57:51.180 --> 02:57:56.780
for the Christmas season, however, if it had not moved, it would have been going up against

02:57:56.780 --> 02:57:58.320
Episode 8.

02:57:58.320 --> 02:58:05.040
Yeah, so, by the way, Warcraft movie did the same thing, it had to retreat into March because

02:58:05.040 --> 02:58:06.040
of Episode 7.

02:58:06.040 --> 02:58:10.540
It should have kept retreating, but anyway, well, yeah, it didn't, it didn't, it worked

02:58:10.540 --> 02:58:11.540
so well.

02:58:11.540 --> 02:58:12.540
I liked it.

02:58:12.540 --> 02:58:14.520
Yeah, there were, honestly, I didn't hate the Warcraft movie, I really didn't.

02:58:14.520 --> 02:58:17.280
I was expecting to really dislike it, but I was like, it actually really wasn't that

02:58:17.280 --> 02:58:18.280
bad.

02:58:18.280 --> 02:58:20.640
I just, I think they just marketed it wrong.

02:58:20.640 --> 02:58:22.280
I don't know how it's definitely what they did.

02:58:22.280 --> 02:58:24.320
I think they just really marketed it wrong.

02:58:24.320 --> 02:58:30.520
But anyway, Ready Player One will hopefully do well in 2018, on March 30th.

02:58:30.520 --> 02:58:35.780
Last call for calls at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word, on Skype.

02:58:35.780 --> 02:58:41.160
But the other big movie, and I know y'all are excited for this, Wreck-It Ralph 2 has

02:58:41.160 --> 02:58:48.080
its official subtitle, it's called Wreck-It Ralph 2, Ralph Breaks the Internet, Starting

02:58:48.080 --> 02:58:49.080
with Twitter.

02:58:49.080 --> 02:58:53.360
No, I'm sorry, I threw that in there myself, but we're just kind of hoping that's where

02:58:53.360 --> 02:58:54.360
he'll start.

02:58:54.360 --> 02:58:57.360
No, I just, I loved, there's a lot of great stuff under, there's a lot of stuff I really

02:58:57.360 --> 02:59:00.260
love on Twitter, and people I've really come to know and appreciate on Twitter, but there's

02:59:00.260 --> 02:59:02.240
a lot of fuckheads on Twitter too.

02:59:02.240 --> 02:59:03.240
Yes.

02:59:03.240 --> 02:59:06.320
So, it's just, I hope Wreck-It Ralph comes out and is like, I'm gonna wreck it, and takes

02:59:06.320 --> 02:59:12.200
all those egg icons and just, or the Mr. Creeper, Ms. Creeper icons.

02:59:12.200 --> 02:59:15.120
He takes the egg icons, put them in a blender, and has a protein shake.

02:59:15.120 --> 02:59:16.120
That's right.

02:59:16.120 --> 02:59:17.120
That's right.

02:59:17.120 --> 02:59:18.120
So, there you go.

02:59:18.120 --> 02:59:21.760
Maybe that'll hit, it's Fix It Felix will fix Twitter.

02:59:21.760 --> 02:59:25.840
If you know, I, what was the tweet I wrote earlier this week, because y'all know I get

02:59:25.840 --> 02:59:31.600
sassy on Twitter sometimes, there was a tweet I wrote that said something like, congratulations

02:59:31.600 --> 02:59:37.620
Twitter on removing the at replies so that, you know, now you have more characters.

02:59:37.620 --> 02:59:40.720
Could you next work on removing cyberbullying and abuse?

02:59:40.720 --> 02:59:41.720
I saw that.

02:59:41.720 --> 02:59:42.720
That was, that was glorious.

02:59:42.720 --> 02:59:46.880
Honestly, I feel like every, I feel like that's a recycled joke, that like I used that exact

02:59:46.880 --> 02:59:49.760
same joke the last feature, Twitter, unveiled.

02:59:49.760 --> 02:59:54.920
It's like, so how long until we get, anyway.

02:59:54.920 --> 02:59:55.920
Let's see.

02:59:55.920 --> 02:59:59.180
In chat, they're also talking about movies in chat, Tigerclaw says, anyone see Ghost

02:59:59.180 --> 03:00:00.520
in the Shell this weekend?

03:00:00.520 --> 03:00:03.620
I thought it was good, but it didn't do well at the box office.

03:00:03.620 --> 03:00:08.120
Number three with 19 million, Beauty and the Beast at number two with 47 million.

03:00:08.120 --> 03:00:10.040
Do you know what movie was number one?

03:00:10.040 --> 03:00:12.700
And I'm sorry, this movie looked awful.

03:00:12.700 --> 03:00:16.360
The boss, not the Power Rangers, that movie was good.

03:00:16.360 --> 03:00:17.360
The Boss Baby.

03:00:17.360 --> 03:00:18.360
Seriously?

03:00:18.360 --> 03:00:23.540
And fucking talking baby movies, it's all those families and shit.

03:00:23.540 --> 03:00:24.720
Did you see Get Out?

03:00:24.720 --> 03:00:26.120
No, I really want to.

03:00:26.120 --> 03:00:27.360
It was so good.

03:00:27.360 --> 03:00:28.360
I would see that again.

03:00:28.360 --> 03:00:31.240
Even though I know exactly what's going to happen now?

03:00:31.240 --> 03:00:32.960
We need to go on movie dates like every night this week.

03:00:32.960 --> 03:00:33.960
Double feature.

03:00:33.960 --> 03:00:34.960
We're going to see Power Rangers.

03:00:34.960 --> 03:00:36.920
We're going to say, you can't theater hop at the new theaters.

03:00:36.920 --> 03:00:37.920
Did you know that?

03:00:37.920 --> 03:00:38.920
It's impossible to theater hop.

03:00:38.920 --> 03:00:43.360
Because I actually overheard them saying, they were talking to some kids that they ejected

03:00:43.360 --> 03:00:46.540
and they said, we have sensors in the seats and we sell them by the seats.

03:00:46.540 --> 03:00:49.920
And so if a seat is being sat in that we didn't sell, we know.

03:00:49.920 --> 03:00:50.920
And I was like-

03:00:50.920 --> 03:00:51.920
That's right, because you picked the seats.

03:00:51.920 --> 03:00:52.920
You picked the seats when you were by the tickets.

03:00:52.920 --> 03:00:55.880
They fucking solved the problem with theater hopping.

03:00:55.880 --> 03:00:56.880
Those smart assholes.

03:00:56.880 --> 03:00:57.880
Unless you sit in the aisle.

03:00:58.400 --> 03:01:00.400
I guess we're still on the ground.

03:01:00.400 --> 03:01:01.400
Hell no.

03:01:01.400 --> 03:01:02.400
We won't go.

03:01:02.400 --> 03:01:03.400
All right.

03:01:03.400 --> 03:01:04.400
Anyway.

03:01:04.400 --> 03:01:05.400
See, I don't know about that.

03:01:05.400 --> 03:01:08.840
Because when Monet and I went to see Get Out, there were these people that were totally

03:01:08.840 --> 03:01:10.960
sitting in the wrong seats and no one ejected them.

03:01:10.960 --> 03:01:11.960
Oh, interesting.

03:01:11.960 --> 03:01:12.960
So.

03:01:12.960 --> 03:01:13.960
Maybe.

03:01:13.960 --> 03:01:14.960
Because they weren't kids.

03:01:14.960 --> 03:01:15.960
Anyway.

03:01:15.960 --> 03:01:16.960
All right.

03:01:16.960 --> 03:01:17.960
Nobody else is calling in on Skype line.

03:01:17.960 --> 03:01:18.960
So I guess that's going to do it.

03:01:18.960 --> 03:01:21.520
I guess, you know, WrestleMania and people went to bed, whatever.

03:01:21.520 --> 03:01:22.520
But you can always email us.

03:01:22.520 --> 03:01:25.080
Participate at OrangeLoungeTradio.com.

03:01:25.080 --> 03:01:27.480
You can also, well, it is after midnight on the East Coast.

03:01:28.080 --> 03:01:31.760
You can also send us a tweet at OLR.

03:01:31.760 --> 03:01:35.680
So we do read them to ourselves even if we don't always read them on air.

03:01:35.680 --> 03:01:37.660
Because there's just a lot of other stuff.

03:01:37.660 --> 03:01:39.240
So I always get lost on Twitter.

03:01:39.240 --> 03:01:40.320
But I do read everything.

03:01:40.320 --> 03:01:41.760
I'll heart your tweets.

03:01:41.760 --> 03:01:42.840
I do.

03:01:42.840 --> 03:01:44.640
So I like hearting tweets.

03:01:44.640 --> 03:01:46.160
I read it and I liked it.

03:01:46.160 --> 03:01:47.160
Thank you very much.

03:01:47.160 --> 03:01:48.160
All right.

03:01:48.160 --> 03:01:49.160
Ah.

03:01:49.160 --> 03:01:50.160
We've got to wrap up tonight.

03:01:50.160 --> 03:01:51.160
Gabe.

03:01:51.160 --> 03:01:52.160
Bree.

03:01:52.160 --> 03:01:53.160
Thank you guys so much for being here.

03:01:53.160 --> 03:01:54.160
It's always fun to have you guys here.

03:01:54.160 --> 03:01:55.160
You guys are so much fun.

03:01:55.160 --> 03:01:56.160
Thank you.

03:01:56.160 --> 03:01:57.160
Thank you guys.

03:01:57.840 --> 03:01:58.840
I'm so grateful for this.

03:01:58.840 --> 03:01:59.840
I'm so looking forward to Saturday.

03:01:59.840 --> 03:02:02.120
I know you guys are working your little tushies off.

03:02:02.120 --> 03:02:06.080
And I know things are going to go wrong and it's going to feel like the end of the world.

03:02:06.080 --> 03:02:07.400
But you know what?

03:02:07.400 --> 03:02:09.120
You guys are doing such a great thing for Sacramento.

03:02:09.120 --> 03:02:11.680
Remember, nobody's going to notice the little shit.

03:02:11.680 --> 03:02:15.680
Somebody's not going to show, you know, something weird is going to happen, but don't worry

03:02:15.680 --> 03:02:16.680
about it.

03:02:16.680 --> 03:02:17.680
It's going to be OK.

03:02:17.680 --> 03:02:18.680
That's right.

03:02:18.680 --> 03:02:22.360
Do them yoga exercises Saturday morning.

03:02:22.360 --> 03:02:23.360
Let it out.

03:02:23.360 --> 03:02:24.360
Shake it off.

03:02:24.360 --> 03:02:26.120
Let it go.

03:02:26.120 --> 03:02:27.120
Let it go.

03:02:28.080 --> 03:02:30.080
Or the Taylor Swift song.

03:02:30.080 --> 03:02:31.080
Shake it off.

03:02:31.080 --> 03:02:32.080
Shake it off.

03:02:32.080 --> 03:02:33.080
All right.

03:02:33.080 --> 03:02:35.000
But you guys are going to have a fantastic event Saturday.

03:02:35.000 --> 03:02:37.280
I'm so looking forward to it.

03:02:37.280 --> 03:02:38.760
And then we can start talking about 2018.

03:02:38.760 --> 03:02:39.760
Hell yeah.

03:02:39.760 --> 03:02:40.760
Yes, sir.

03:02:40.760 --> 03:02:41.760
All right.

03:02:41.760 --> 03:02:47.480
So, Bree, one more one more plug, anything you want to plug, any place we should follow

03:02:47.480 --> 03:02:48.760
you all that good stuff.

03:02:48.760 --> 03:02:54.040
Sacramento Indie Arcade is coming on Saturday, April 8th from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.

03:02:54.080 --> 03:02:57.400
The updates are still available online, indiearcade.org.

03:02:57.400 --> 03:02:59.240
You can get all the information.

03:02:59.240 --> 03:03:00.600
Follow us on our social media.

03:03:00.600 --> 03:03:04.760
We're updating that like every hour.

03:03:04.760 --> 03:03:06.120
And we welcome everybody.

03:03:06.120 --> 03:03:07.640
It's a safe space for all.

03:03:07.640 --> 03:03:10.840
So, you know, come out, hang with us, party with us.

03:03:10.840 --> 03:03:12.760
It's going to be a great time.

03:03:12.760 --> 03:03:15.160
There's even speaking of party with us, there's an after party, too.

03:03:15.160 --> 03:03:19.240
We didn't talk about that tonight, but there's an after party and it's going to get lit in

03:03:19.240 --> 03:03:24.760
South Sac because the after party, I don't know how y'all plan this, the after party

03:03:24.760 --> 03:03:28.680
is next door to Rocky Horror, which I'm hosting.

03:03:28.680 --> 03:03:31.520
So yeah, I got to somehow do both.

03:03:31.520 --> 03:03:34.600
I'm going to be in both places at the same time.

03:03:34.600 --> 03:03:37.320
We recommend the after party for the 18 and up.

03:03:37.320 --> 03:03:43.240
Well, yes, this place also serves alcohol and Shane, maybe they're saying the F word

03:03:43.240 --> 03:03:44.240
at people.

03:03:44.240 --> 03:03:45.240
Bring it, Shane.

03:03:45.240 --> 03:03:46.240
Yeah.

03:03:46.240 --> 03:03:47.240
Love it.

03:03:47.240 --> 03:03:48.240
All right.

03:03:48.240 --> 03:03:49.240
Looking forward to it.

03:03:49.240 --> 03:03:50.880
Best of luck with the event and everything.

03:03:50.880 --> 03:03:51.880
I'm so excited.

03:03:51.880 --> 03:03:52.880
Thank you.

03:03:52.880 --> 03:03:55.040
Gabe, any plugs you'd like to give?

03:03:55.040 --> 03:03:56.040
No, no.

03:03:56.040 --> 03:03:57.040
Yeah.

03:03:57.040 --> 03:04:00.360
I mean, the main thing is primarily, as Brianna said, you know, in the arcade coming up that,

03:04:00.360 --> 03:04:05.680
you know, the Saturday, you know, ticket prices will be $10 for the rest of the week.

03:04:05.680 --> 03:04:09.240
He goes up on the day of, so it goes up to 15.

03:04:09.240 --> 03:04:10.240
Don't procrastinate.

03:04:10.240 --> 03:04:11.240
Yeah, do not procrastinate.

03:04:11.240 --> 03:04:15.040
Sacramento, you're so addicted to complacency.

03:04:15.040 --> 03:04:16.040
Stop it.

03:04:16.040 --> 03:04:17.040
So be sure to come through.

03:04:17.040 --> 03:04:18.040
Yeah.

03:04:18.040 --> 03:04:19.040
Get your tickets early.

03:04:19.040 --> 03:04:24.520
If you lived here long enough and you followed the Kings at all, you know, you're always

03:04:24.520 --> 03:04:28.360
going to get fucked in the last quarter.

03:04:28.360 --> 03:04:32.240
That is so, that is the greatest thing I have heard this entire weekend.

03:04:32.240 --> 03:04:36.160
So do not wait until the last quarter because you're going to get beat.

03:04:36.160 --> 03:04:37.160
Yeah.

03:04:37.160 --> 03:04:38.160
Or fouled out.

03:04:38.160 --> 03:04:39.160
Anyways.

03:04:39.160 --> 03:04:40.160
So yeah.

03:04:40.160 --> 03:04:42.280
So yeah, definitely come through, you know, definitely come through for that.

03:04:42.280 --> 03:04:47.960
It's going to be another very inspirational event, very memorable event.

03:04:47.960 --> 03:04:48.960
Yeah.

03:04:48.960 --> 03:04:53.500
And then, you know, with the, with joking earlier about Crumple, Crumple will be out

03:04:53.500 --> 03:04:54.760
this month.

03:04:54.760 --> 03:04:56.560
Crossing Fingers this month.

03:04:56.560 --> 03:05:00.020
I've had to push it back a little bit just because, you know, again, it's just one other

03:05:00.020 --> 03:05:04.520
guy and myself and, and I'm working on Kinship and I'm working on my, you know, other stuff.

03:05:04.520 --> 03:05:07.560
If you don't make it, you can always just say April Fools.

03:05:07.560 --> 03:05:08.560
Right.

03:05:08.560 --> 03:05:09.560
Next year.

03:05:09.560 --> 03:05:10.560
Yeah.

03:05:10.560 --> 03:05:11.560
But yeah.

03:05:11.840 --> 03:05:14.840
It's going to be another club.

03:05:14.840 --> 03:05:15.840
Yeah.

03:05:15.840 --> 03:05:19.840
So, um, but yeah, if you, if you're following me on Twitter, uh, check out my Twitter page

03:05:19.840 --> 03:05:24.280
and you'll be able to see on the pinch tweet how to pre-order Crumple again, it's just

03:05:24.280 --> 03:05:29.920
$1 for the pre-order $2 when it comes out, uh, episode two is already in the works.

03:05:29.920 --> 03:05:34.600
So, um, yeah, there's going to be, there's a lot of stuff happening this year.

03:05:34.600 --> 03:05:35.960
So yeah, it's going to be good.

03:05:35.960 --> 03:05:38.440
So thank you guys so much for everything.

03:05:38.440 --> 03:05:39.440

03:05:39.440 --> 03:05:40.440
Thank you.

03:05:40.480 --> 03:05:42.000
We'll be back again before the next event.

03:05:42.000 --> 03:05:45.520
There's always some reason to have our pals on the show here, another event coming up

03:05:45.520 --> 03:05:46.520
or something like that.

03:05:46.520 --> 03:05:49.120
So, uh, keep in touch XOXO hearts.

03:05:49.120 --> 03:05:50.120
All right.

03:05:50.120 --> 03:05:51.120
All right.

03:05:51.120 --> 03:05:52.120
We'll see you soon.

03:05:52.120 --> 03:05:53.120
We'll see you Saturday.

03:05:53.120 --> 03:05:55.920
We'll be broadcasting live, but please come up to the black box and say hi on air at some

03:05:55.920 --> 03:05:56.920
point.

03:05:56.920 --> 03:05:57.920
Of course.

03:05:57.920 --> 03:05:58.920
Of course.

03:05:58.920 --> 03:06:02.320
Um, real quick before we officially sign off, I want to say, of course, as always, uh, thank

03:06:02.320 --> 03:06:03.960
you very much for checking out our show.

03:06:03.960 --> 03:06:07.960
Uh, we appreciate if you could help us spread the word, tell a friend or five or 20 about

03:06:07.960 --> 03:06:11.840
the show, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but, uh, without the voices

03:06:11.840 --> 03:06:12.920
here, we can't hear them.

03:06:12.920 --> 03:06:16.360
Uh, we don't, uh, we don't really put ads in the show.

03:06:16.360 --> 03:06:18.120
We don't really make a lot of money off doing this stuff.

03:06:18.120 --> 03:06:19.360
We just do it for the fun of it.

03:06:19.360 --> 03:06:23.420
Uh, that also means we don't have a big multimillion dollar website backing us up or anything like

03:06:23.420 --> 03:06:24.420
that.

03:06:24.420 --> 03:06:26.200
Um, so, you know, we, we need, we need help.

03:06:26.200 --> 03:06:27.200
We need word of mouth.

03:06:27.200 --> 03:06:32.160
So, uh, a nice five star review on a place like iTunes or Google podcasts or wherever

03:06:32.160 --> 03:06:36.920
it is that you found this show, that stuff all goes a very long way as well.

03:06:36.920 --> 03:06:43.480
I look to my left ever and always calamity, Jamie and her final thought tonight resist.

03:06:43.480 --> 03:06:48.400
And my final thought tonight is peeps.

03:06:48.400 --> 03:06:49.400
Goodnight everybody.

03:06:49.400 --> 03:06:52.000
We will see you in seven days.

03:06:52.000 --> 03:06:53.880
Thank you so much girl.

03:06:53.880 --> 03:06:57.640
Um, why that's it?

03:06:57.640 --> 03:06:58.640
We're done.

03:06:58.640 --> 03:06:59.640
We're out of here.

03:06:59.640 --> 03:07:00.640
Well, actually, no, we won't see you.

03:07:00.640 --> 03:07:01.640
We won't see you in seven days.

03:07:01.640 --> 03:07:08.200
Six days at the second, the arcade event, and then we'll see you, uh, like eight days

03:07:08.200 --> 03:07:09.200
after that.

03:07:09.200 --> 03:07:10.200
Cause we won't be here live next Sunday.

03:07:10.200 --> 03:07:14.200
So everybody have a good week off, uh, support Bobby, who I think will still be alive that

03:07:14.200 --> 03:07:18.840
night and all those indie podcasts and hardworking individuals out there.

03:07:18.840 --> 03:07:19.840
Have a great night, everybody.

03:07:19.840 --> 03:07:20.840
Bye.

03:07:20.840 --> 03:07:23.840
