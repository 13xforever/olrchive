Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:22,000
This week, Ravel with the girls of Night Trap. They're horror in suspense by revisiting Sega's most realistic, horrifying, and controversial titles of the FMB generation.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This is just one grip of tonight's show, and there's plenty more to come right now in the show where every gamer has a voice.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Orange Lounge Radio

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode number 684 for this April the 30th of 2017.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And a big thank you to being back this week. Sorry guys, we missed last week unexpectedly.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I hate canceling shows at the last minute the day of, but I got really sick.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
In fact, you might still hear it in my sinuses a little bit. Black being sick is awful.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
But my name is Rob Roberts, and I'm here joining you with my co-hosts here in Studio N7 in Sacramento, California.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle, say hello first off to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Hi!

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Hi! Happy birthday, a little belated. Since we missed last week, we missed your birthday show.

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm old. Where's my presents?

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I feel bad for that. Your presents is being the gifted with our presents. No, Alan and I owe you a fancy schmancy dinner.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Don't worry about it. I'm just being a bad.

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
We want to. It'll be fine.

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Okay, fine.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
But how'd you celebrate No Show last week? Did you get to catch up on some games? Did you beat Andromeda yet?

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Oh, I beat Andromeda before that.

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Congrats.

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm doing another playthrough right now. I'm trying 100%.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Of course.

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Except I had to go back and catch up on the WoW content, because I went flying.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Oh, yeah. They had a patch at some point recently.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
A big patch.

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Yeah, yeah.

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I mean, like, it's pretty big lore stuff if you've been a lore fiend.

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Sure.

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
But I'll talk about that and how what was I playing.

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Sounds good.

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Um, but, uh, it, uh, I didn't really do much. I just stayed at home in my pajamas.

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
That's all right. I needed to rest too. It happens sometimes.

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Well, my work schedule has split days off, so I don't really feel like I get any real rest.

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And so I needed the break today. I slept until two. It was great.

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Rockstar.

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
But for my birthday, I decided I wanted a fairy garden.

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
A fairy garden?

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
A fairy garden.

41
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Like Navi the fairy in Zelda?

42
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
No, it's-

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Hey, listen.

44
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It's basically a thing where you just make like a little in a like kind of like a maybe a foot diameter pot.

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And you make just like a little fairy house with a yard and trees made of succulents and stupid shit like that.

46
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I've never heard. All right.

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And next thing you know, you have growing frog fractions three in the bottom.

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Well, hello, Techmaster Loki. How are you?

49
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm fine.

50
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
She's, I know all I heard was that she's growing pot, but there was something else about that about fairies and stuff, but that's, that's all right.

51
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
How are you, Techmaster Loki?

52
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm fine.

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Did you have a good week off unexpectedly last week?

54
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Yeah, I went and saw The Fate of the Furious.

55
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Oh, how was that?

56
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It was just a totally random movie to pick because I haven't watched, I've literally only watched the first two Fast and the Furious movies.

57
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
And so like I'm totally out of the Fast and the Furious universe as far as it's concerned.

58
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It's actually pretty good. I was very surprised.

59
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I thought like, geez, by like was it the eighth movie now?

60
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It can't be that good.

61
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It's pretty entertaining.

62
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I mean, let's just, it's not an intelligent movie, but it was good for what it would expected it to be a good popcorn movie.

63
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
And I enjoyed it.

64
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I was very surprised.

65
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I rarely get to the movies anymore, but I mentioned a few weeks ago, I saw Power Rangers.

66
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It was kind of random for me, but I mean, you know, considering a really good friend of mine was obsessed.

67
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I wanted to see Ghost in the Shell, but apparently I waited too long for that.

68
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
So that's a lot of, they had like one showing at 10 o'clock at night that day.

69
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I was like, it flopped pretty bad.

70
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I know, but I still want to see it.

71
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Oh, hi, Alan. How are you?

72
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Everybody's being horrible tonight at waiting for their introductions.

73
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Hi, Alan. How are you?

74
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Hello.

75
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Hi, you're going to join us here for a little bit at the beginning.

76
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Yes.

77
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
There's a reason I'll get to that in a minute.

78
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
The Ghost in the Shell actually was like a big smash in Japan.

79
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Oh, was it?

80
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Oh, yeah.

81
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Interesting.

82
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Well, look, we can talk about movies, but it is a show about video games.

83
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
In fact, we have some new faces tonight and I'm sure that's thanks to our guest.

84
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Yes, Zircon is going to be joining us in about 20 minutes or so.

85
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It is a three hour show if you guys didn't know.

86
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So he'll be joining us for a little bit to talk a little bit about Tangledeep.

87
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And of course, we'll ask about some of his other projects.

88
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And of course, you guys can ask your questions because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific time.

89
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Nine o'clock Eastern at the Voice of Geeks Network.

90
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
vognetwork.com right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

91
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So hello.

92
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I know we have some new faces in chat tonight.

93
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
This is your first time at OLR.

94
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Hello.

95
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Welcome.

96
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Thanks for being here.

97
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Believe it or not, this show has been on the air since the year 2002 when we started as three friends all playing, get this, Dance Dance Revolution.

98
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:06,000
And even though we got a little old and our body parts gave out, so we don't play as much DDR anymore, we still talk about video games because that was the thing you do.

99
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You go play DDR, then you go meet at the diner across the street, have some mozzarella sticks because that's the healthy thing to eat after you play DDR, right?

100
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
And then talk smack.

101
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
But it's fine because back then we were burning enough calories where it didn't matter.

102
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I was never skinnier in my life than those years during DDR.

103
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Exactly.

104
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
So I'll always be thankful for that and the fact that it gave us this show.

105
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So yeah, this show might almost be as long as Zircon's music career.

106
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I've got to figure, I'm not sure what year he started with the Overclock Remix stuff.

107
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I got to ask about that.

108
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
But I remember in the early days of OLR, you were a fan.

109
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You brought a lot of the Overclock Remix stuff to OLR, Loki, so when you heard he was coming on tonight, you were excited. I'm excited.

110
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Well, I had backed his last, I don't know if his last Kickstarter, but one of his Kickstars, I have a couple albums from his.

111
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I've bought a few of his albums, I don't know. I've listened to a lot of it.

112
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Well, let's go to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com where I see William Murderface saying,

113
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Does anyone play DDR that much anymore? I mean, I feel like it's going through a little bit of a renaissance right now.

114
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Like, there was a few years where it was like deader than a doornail.

115
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,000
But then I think because of round one, Dave & Buster's, some of these other, well, I don't think it ever died in Japan.

116
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
But over, maybe it dipped.

117
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
But like, you know, I think it's kind of like has a renaissance now.

118
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Like I definitely see like more people are into it than it seemed were into it.

119
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Oh, I don't know, maybe five years ago or so.

120
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
So anyway, I do want to shift gears here a little bit because Alan is joining us here at the top of the show.

121
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
And what I was going to say for the whole DDR thing. Yes.

122
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Yeah. Well, for me, you know, the spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised.

123
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Wow. All right. Look, Alan is joining us here at the top of the show because you went on an interesting shopping adventure this week.

124
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And I want to I want to talk a little bit about this because it is about it's a shopping story, but it's about video games.

125
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Right, Alan? Yes. OK, what happened? What did you do? You woke up early Monday morning.

126
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:07,000
So the previous weekend and maybe the week leading up to it, a cheap ass gamer and a bunch of other sites like Polygon and Kotaku ran a story that said the Best Buy was getting.

127
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Factually, they were getting some Nintendo classic consoles on Monday, which would have been the 22nd.

128
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I have no concept of time, whatever Monday was.

129
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:28,000
So, of course, as we all know, the whole lifespan of this product has been sort of a shit show. Supply issues.

130
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It's been hacked. There's no interface on it for them to update the firmware on it. There's no storefront on it, which was mistake number one.

131
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
And I guess the manufacturing costs have gone up. So Nintendo is just like washing their hands of it.

132
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
So it's become a collector's item because it's only been around for like, what, November? Four months.

133
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:53,000
So I was like, all right, I will go to Best Buy early in the morning to see if I can get one of these suckers.

134
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:01,000
So I get there. For those that don't know, Alan is my husband. So Alan was like, even though in the beginning I was like, I don't want one.

135
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I don't need one. These are ridiculous. The minute now it's like, oh, well, if you don't get one now, you're never getting one.

136
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Then I was like, maybe I should get one.

137
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:17,000
There's a dozen better ways to play NES ROMs than a Nintendo classic that don't involve the short ass cable and this, that, and the other.

138
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
So it was more about the game of getting one.

139
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Now it's a thing. Now it's a thing. Yes.

140
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It's like the parents on some Mad Max shit in the parking lot at Toys R Us trying to get a Tickle Me Elmo.

141
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Their kid doesn't even like Elmo. They just want to be able to say that they're the parent that got one.

142
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
They're the mom of the year.

143
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,000
They're like, I got tooth marks on my elbow from where I clocked some bitch, but I got my Tickle Me Elmo.

144
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Did you clock a bitch, Alan?

145
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,000
No, I did not. So I show up. I get up kind of, I wanted to get there at 8am. I was not about to camp overnight.

146
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:57,000
This isn't a console launch. So I get there at around 830. You were sick. So I was trying to surprise you with a...

147
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
That's true. I missed last week's show and I was still sick on Monday morning. I had to call out of work.

148
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
So I was like, this will make you feel better.

149
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Yes.

150
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:11,000
So I got up early for me because I work evenings and nights. Get there around 830. I'm roughly the 30th person in line.

151
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Like 30 or 31. And I see as I'm pulling up that there's obviously a line of people, 30 people.

152
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:24,000
And I was like, I guess I'll hang out and see how many they get because I thought they were going to get like three.

153
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:33,000
So I get there at 830. People are kind of, it's not that cold. People are talking in line at around...

154
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Was everybody in line talking about reminiscing about Nintendo and their fondness for classic NES systems?

155
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Some of them and some of them were sharing consoles like, oh, I blasted this for the PS3.

156
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Okay. See, I thought that, okay, I got that because I thought the honest joke was going to be, I don't know, I'm here to buy one, sell it on eBay. What's a Nintendo?

157
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Well, I'm getting to that.

158
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Oh, sorry. Excuse me. I'll just have a seat over here.

159
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:04,000
No. So the people that were in the part of the line that I was in was social and everyone was buried into their phones. It was kind of cold, whatever.

160
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:17,000
So this one guy pulls up a customer is like, I just came from the Natomas one because the management, the Natomas Best Buy because the manager did the call, the vouchers earlier and they got seven.

161
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:32,000
So already I'm the 31st person in line and I'm hearing Natomas, this is like at 915, got seven. Best Buy opens at 10. So the guy drove from Natomas to here to see if we would get more because it's the Arden Best Buy is like the Best Buy in Sacramento.

162
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Right.

163
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I mean, Sacramento is kind of lame, but we're sort of a metropolitan area.

164
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:43,000
We're the capital of the biggest state. We have a basketball team. They're terrible, but we have a team.

165
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:53,000
So finally it's like quarter to 10. And finally the manager comes out with a little helper and a security guard. He's like, all right, I've got these vouchers here.

166
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,000
They are going to be first come first serve. I'm going to start here by the door, front of the line. We have 24.

167
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:09,000
24 Nest Classics. So being person number 31, I'm already shit out of luck. Okay, so that's really where the story should end.

168
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:25,000
But as soon as the manager handed out those 24 slips, the first five people in line who clearly had camped out, like they had lawn chairs and stuff, so they were in it to win it, immediately started to hustle their vouchers.

169
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
As soon as the manager was out of earshot and was trying to flip the voucher.

170
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
On the Best Buy premises.

171
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
On the Best Buy premises, right in front of the store. And I was like, what happened to the good old date?

172
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Well, like if they just bought their shit and then tried to flip it on Craigslist or on eBay, that's their business because they bought the product.

173
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
But I had a problem with the fact that one, they were doing it right as soon as the manager had left.

174
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:57,000
And it's like, you still have to buy the thing. And they're trying to sell this paper. I couldn't tell if this guy was joking, but one guy was like, for the low, low price of $300.

175
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
And it's like, this thing costs 80 bucks.

176
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Like go to 60.

177
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:08,000
60. So they were basically going up and down like, don't leave. I got here if you want to buy it.

178
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
So I'm like, all right. So the first five consoles are basically like a wash.

179
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
And again, in a weird way, it's like, do I respect the hustle of them?

180
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Because I mean, Nintendo created this fucking problem and they're just trying to make a buck off of it.

181
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I mean, Best Buy, of course, I'll get to this in a minute, does have some responsibility.

182
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
But it was just, it was lame. And I did see one dude finally.

183
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:43,000
So let me, I'm skipping ahead. So when people in line were like, nah, dude, like we missed, like, we're not, we're not buying the voucher from you.

184
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:52,000
They then started to approach people coming up for like five minutes to the store saying, hey, are you here for the next Nest Classic? Because who shows up at $9.59?

185
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,000
So they were going to respect the line for their hustle as they were moving down the line.

186
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
But as customers who had not waited in line were like, are you here for the Nest Classic? Yeah.

187
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Well, here's this piece of paper and you already missed your chances.

188
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:12,000
So they were basically trying to do their sales pitch to people that had not waited in line and had no idea what was going on,

189
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
which is kind of weird to have to like run through this gauntlet of dudes just to get into the store.

190
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I mean, to get there right when they opened, maybe they didn't want a Nest Classic, but these people said they did.

191
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
And they immediately got their sales pitch. So, lame.

192
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Finally, you saw them sell one.

193
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Yes, I did see one dude hand a bunch of 20s to a guy. I don't know if it was 80 bucks or 160. I don't know.

194
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I just saw, I saw wallet open and a piece of paper exchange hands. So I'm like, okay, well, there's a sucker right there.

195
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Let me move things forward here a little bit because we do have an interview coming up tonight.

196
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:47,000
But do we, did, did anybody complain to Best Buy about the fact that these guys are hustling on the premises?

197
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:54,000
So, I went, I went to the car, updated you, updated Twitter, was like, but by this point,

198
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:01,000
everyone from person number 25 onwards had pretty much left because it was the 24 people that got the vouchers.

199
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:08,000
And I was like, you know what? I wonder if these people trying to sell their shit, maybe they'll wash out.

200
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Maybe they won't find anyone. Maybe they'll leave. Maybe their credit, maybe someone's credit card will get declined.

201
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:20,000
So I'm going to stick it out and just wait for the damn doors to open, which at this point was only like 15 more minutes, 10 more minutes.

202
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I'm going to get in line and see what happens. So doors open, we all rush in and there's this mom who got there like five minutes to 10.

203
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
And I sort of, she was like, are you thinking about buying one of the papers? I'm like, I don't have cash on me.

204
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:39,000
And even if I did, I'm not, I'm not supporting their BS. So we are all in line.

205
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I'm sort of waiting to hear if someone is going to flake out. And the manager comes up and says, these vouchers are good until one in the afternoon.

206
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:56,000
So if you leave the property, the owner of that piece of paper can buy the product through 1 p.m.

207
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:03,000
If 1 p.m. comes and goes and all of those 24 vouchers are not accounted for, then they will do first come first serve to the people there.

208
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:10,000
And I was like, well, so now those, because three or four of those five guys that were trying to do the hustle had left.

209
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Why until one o'clock? What is, what is the pro consumer reason?

210
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
It's three hours. I don't know.

211
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
That you would let people wait until one o'clock.

212
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Why would you wait there to get a voucher that you're really, this is the vouchers that go buy something and then come back?

213
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm not ready to buy this yet. Then why are you in fucking line?

214
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I mean, okay. I understand maybe if you have to run and use the ATM or something like you got there.

215
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Okay. We'll give you until 11 then.

216
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Exactly. Give them an hour or say, you know, fine. Now that you're here.

217
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
They have an ATM in the goddamn store.

218
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Everybody uses cards these days anyway, but fine. If somebody has a big need like that, then fine.

219
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:54,000
If you come back in 30 minutes, we'll hold this for you while you work out your banking issues.

220
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
You know, fine. But that just encourages people to turn around and resell it.

221
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
And that's the part of your story that really like irks me the most.

222
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Why does Best Buy have that?

223
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
The mom that I sort of made friends with was like, okay, so you're the manager.

224
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:14,000
So I want to know what you're going to do about the people that are scalping the vouchers on your property.

225
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
And the guy was like, people were reselling them? Yes, you would have seen that if you stuck around.

226
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Well, I mean, our protocol is for any release like this is we hand out the vouchers.

227
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:29,000
What people do with those vouchers is their business. If they're scalping them, that's unfortunate.

228
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:37,000
But that is not okay. And it's like, all right, if they had one or two security guards at the front door that were like, okay, whatever you're doing, you're not doing it here.

229
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Go to Toys R Us. Go to Burger King. Go to the way you're putting it.

230
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
That says to me Best Buy supports the scalping culture, period. Yeah.

231
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
And part of this problem is being created is because of Best Buy.

232
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:57,000
It's like out of sight, out of mind. If you want to do your shady shit at the other end of the parking lot where it's not Best Buy property, then whatever.

233
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:03,000
But they just weren't there. They didn't care. So finally, we're like, so they left.

234
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
You're saying it that it was unfortunate, but you have no control over scalping.

235
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
What about the people that left? What's going to happen?

236
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
He's like, well, if you're here waiting to see if someone's going to wash out on their sale, those vouchers are good until 1 p.m.

237
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
So if you're here just to see if people can't get one, you have to come back at once.

238
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
So at that point, I was like, okay, so now I'm just wasting my time. So then I left for real.

239
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:29,000
So let me read some comments in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

240
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
William Murderface says, what, do they need to find a Bitcoin ATM or some shit?

241
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
S2100 Matt says, what a shit show. Sounds like they made this up as they went along.

242
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Dungeon Buster says, I feel less guilty visiting one and then ordering what I want from Amazon.

243
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Let's see. Dungeon Buster says, you can make a few Raspberry Pi versions for 300. Just saying.

244
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Yeah, but you know, sometimes it's just about the game of getting one.

245
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:59,000
And being person 31 out of 24, I already knew that that game was over for me.

246
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:06,000
But it was watching the resulting shit show of how Best Buy didn't care about the scalpers and then also gave them a three hour window to do their hustle.

247
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
And that's part of the reason why I wanted Alan to tell this story.

248
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Because we're hearing a lot of speak from Nintendo this week about the whole, oh, there's limited resources.

249
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:19,000
What's the line they've been given this week on why they've sold two million of them, but they're not doing any more because what?

250
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:25,000
We're only one company. We're only one company. We don't have unlimited resources. Resources are limited.

251
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
This is only supposed to be a holiday thing. Blah, blah. Jamie's making a motion with her hands.

252
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Like, yeah, this is just like it's a lot of speak and it sucks to hear things like this.

253
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:41,000
And look, at the end of the day, oh, well, we didn't get one. It's not about that.

254
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I don't care that we didn't get one and all that. If I really wanted one bad enough, I should have started fighting for one in the beginning.

255
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I accept that. But what sucks about this whole thing, what I think really needs to be examined is why is Best Buy's policies basically allowing scalping to happen?

256
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:01,000
And why are these? I mean, I can also understand that, you know, retailers don't give a fuck or whatever.

257
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
They still get the money at the end of the day, blah, blah, blah.

258
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:12,000
But I still think, you know, especially as one of our chatters put it, in this day and age where it's so easy where you can just turn your back on the retailer then and go to Amazon.

259
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Don't you want a retailer that's going to fight for the consumer a little bit, so to speak? Like, I don't know. Doesn't that little bit of faith go a long way?

260
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:27,000
They just had to have the security guard who was taller than me, and I'm 6'4", hang out front and be like, what are you guys doing? Don't do that here.

261
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:38,000
And just kind of make it a little harder to scalp. And just the fact, again, if they had bought their shit and then flipped it in the parking lot on Craigslist, on eBay, whatever, they bought the product.

262
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:50,000
If they want to resell it to some sucker for 400 bucks, fine. But the fact that it was for a piece of paper where you still have to buy the actual product after you paid them for their extortion BS.

263
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Let me read a few more comments here. Brad from Pod Culture says,

264
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Flipping one is one thing. The fuckers that show like 10 in a damn eBay auction pic are the real bastards.

265
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Come on, Cupid Boy says, At the end of the day, Alan is still a great guy for trying to do something nice for his man. I agree.

266
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:16,000
If I had gotten up at like, if I was there by 7am or 730, but again, I shouldn't have to go to a place at 7am for a retro console.

267
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Those five guys should have been an issue.

268
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Bobby Blackwolf says, My Best Buy screwed me out of a pro controller because they wouldn't let me jump out of the pre-order line to get it and let someone who didn't pre-order behind me in line go to the register first.

269
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
So they have some issues with their launch process. They also did vouchers for Switch.

270
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Picratos, hope I'm saying that right, in our chatroom says, Nintendo is trolling at this point.

271
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Well, okay, quickly, because again, we've got Zircon coming.

272
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Here's the quote. So the quote is, Even with the extraordinary level of performance, we understand that people are frustrated about not being able to find the system.

273
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:56,000
And for that, we really do apologize. But from our perspective, it's important to recognize where our future is and the key areas that we need to drive.

274
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:04,000
We've got a lot going on right now. We don't have unlimited resources. That is some, that is a fucking line of bullshit right there.

275
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Let me quickly ask this, because there's been a lot of increased rabble rabble on the internet this week about the Super NES Mini.

276
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:19,000
You know, first, that was the fanfic. Oh, the logical follow up to the NES Mini is the Super NES Mini. That's what Nintendo is really going to do.

277
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:25,000
And I don't, like Eurogamer has a tip or something, and they've been, you know, they're just spot on with Nintendo stuff.

278
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:34,000
But essentially, there's a lot more rabble rabble, where there's smoke, there's fire, et cetera, about Super Nintendo Mini is a thing happening this holiday.

279
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:41,000
And there's a part of me that's like, fuck them, I don't care. You know what? Here's what I think about your fucking NES Mini.

280
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I bought a fucking Raspberry Pi yesterday, so fuck you and your stupid Mini.

281
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
You know what? Virtual console on Switch would be fine too, but...

282
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:56,000
We told a friend to hold one for us, and we got one from our friend. At GameStop.

283
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:03,000
See, here's the thing though. Yes, but you have to, even that's a little, I don't want to say it's shady, but it's, you have to know somebody.

284
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
If you have a hookup, then that's, that applies to everything.

285
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
And we wanted it for ourselves, not to sell.

286
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:16,000
It shouldn't be like fucking alcohol in the 1920s. Like, you have to know the secret password to say at the front where they let you in the brothel in the back.

287
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
There's no one poisoning the machines.

288
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Like, it shouldn't be like that. I just, I don't understand.

289
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I mean, I'm sure we got at least one amiibo back when they were sort of fresh, ma'am, and relatively rare. They didn't have the third reprinting.

290
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:35,000
We got some of the more coveted amiibos through a hookup. I mean, that's just how that works if you know someone.

291
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:41,000
And please, don't give me this bullshit that, oh, I'm sorry, we're just, we don't have unlimited resources.

292
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Then how is it that other companies that manufacture, probably in the same countries as you, do not have these supply problems?

293
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Why is it that you're the only fucking company that consistently has supply problems?

294
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,000
It's not because you don't have unlimited resources. It's because you're fucking incompetent.

295
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I was, I'm going to try to wrap up on this, and then I want to move on.

296
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:07,000
But I, one thing I would like to see Nintendo do, I'm going to try to keep this constructive and happy and da da da da da.

297
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I would like to, in light of this story that we're hearing about how easy it is for scalpers to take advantage of what these retail channels are doing,

298
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I would like Nintendo, if they are going to do a Super Nintendo Mini, which is going to be, now that I really want,

299
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,000
because the Super Nintendo is like my favorite system, as I think many of you probably feel the same way.

300
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I want to know, what is Nintendo going to do to hold retailers accountable for this scalping market?

301
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Look, I understand you can't prevent scalping 100%. Like, that's just, capitalism is-

302
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
People are always going to try and get one over.

303
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Exactly. But what steps are you going to take to make it a lot fucking harder?

304
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Because what Alan is talking about was too easy. That's, that's the long and the short of it.

305
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Anyway, let's see, go into chat for a few more comments here over at live.vognetwork.com.

306
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:01,000
SC Mike says, all these limited resources do is just support pirating the ROMs and emulators, honestly.

307
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Yeah, we still don't have Virtual Console, which I would have thought could have been like their-

308
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
They could have gone, oh, well, you know, we don't have any more NES Classic Minis.

309
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
But guess what? We're going to release on the Switch for $29.99.

310
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:18,000
We're going to have a NES Classic bundle that will turn your Switch into an NES Classic.

311
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
And we're going to release a controller that will work with the Switch wirelessly.

312
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Would that have been the most difficult thing in the world to do?

313
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:33,000
But it's okay, you know, when they launch their online service, they'll have your free monthly rental of a game that, you know, Game ROM that you get for free or something like that.

314
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
And you'll love it.

315
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Okay, we're going to shift gears here because we are very excited here at Orange Lawn Radio to welcome-

316
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
By the way, Alan, thank you very much for sitting in.

317
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Bye, show.

318
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I know you guys-

319
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Went back to the office.

320
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Got other stuff to do like work.

321
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Thank you for trying. I really appreciate it.

322
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Okay.

323
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
You're welcome.

324
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
As I was saying, we're very, very honored tonight to have a special guest joining us on the show.

325
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Has had a very, very long musical career through organizations like Overclocked Remix.

326
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:05,000
And now is moving on into game development with developing and planning on releasing Tangle Deep a little later this year.

327
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
We're going to get Zircon on the line and he'll be joining us here.

328
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
And I believe we have him on the line.

329
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Hey, Zircon, you there?

330
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I am.

331
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Hey, welcome to Orange Lawn Radio.

332
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Hey, thank you for having me.

333
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Hey, no problem.

334
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Well, I should start.

335
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
First off, I have to say thank you very much.

336
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,000
You guys may not know this, but behind the scenes, Zircon was actually scheduled to be here last week.

337
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
And we had to reschedule because I got sick.

338
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
So I really want to thank you up front for your flexibility.

339
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
So-

340
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Oh, no problem at all, man.

341
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Good guy.

342
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Good guy, Zircon.

343
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
How long have you been doing Video Gate?

344
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
We were talking about this at the opening of the show.

345
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
You may not know this, but OLR has been around since 2002.

346
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
We've been doing this show in different forms.

347
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
And I was like, Zircon may still have beat us.

348
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
How long have you been working in video games?

349
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
No, you beat me.

350
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
You definitely beat me there.

351
00:25:51,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I started my first foray into remixing game music in 2003.

352
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Now, of course, that was as a rank amateur.

353
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
So no professional stuff.

354
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I think my first paid thing was 2004, and I got paid $15 for writing a song.

355
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
What was the game it was for?

356
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Captain Genia on Shell Island, which you can actually find Let's Plays of that on YouTube with like 50 views, but nonetheless.

357
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Hey, that's awesome.

358
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,000
If you guys have questions for Zircon, you can always check out our chat room over at live.vognetware.com.

359
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
We will be asking some of those questions that you guys ask in our chat room too as Zirconists are going through this.

360
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:42,000
So I want to congratulate you. Your Kickstarter, Tangledeep, smashed the goal that you had set.

361
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:48,000
How does it feel to now have the Kickstarter in your rearview mirror at this point?

362
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Man, it's blowing my mind.

363
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:59,000
It feels amazing that so many people are excited for the game and are as passionate for it as I am.

364
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:08,000
It's just even more motivation to see people play the game and the backers being excited about it and sending me their ideas is just incredible.

365
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,000
And I should say, disclosure, I backed it, so just throwing that out there.

366
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Thank you for that.

367
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
No worries, but I just don't want people going, oh ethics.

368
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:28,000
So anyway, for those that may not have heard of Tangledeep, why don't you give us the little elevator pitch. What is it?

369
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Alright, I condensed this very short. Imagine if Squaresoft made a Final Fantasy themed dungeon crawler for the Super Nintendo and that is Tangledeep.

370
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I like it.

371
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:51,000
That's the very short version. It's a PC and Mac game. I'm still working on it. It's in development now so it's not out.

372
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:58,000
But yeah, it's a dungeon crawler very much inspired by a lot of my favorite games from the Super Nintendo like Secret of Mana.

373
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:04,000
And art style wise, you definitely see shades of Chrono Trigger in there and games like that.

374
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
But it's mixed with that sort of roguelike turn-based gameplay.

375
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:17,000
So if you play stuff like Dungeons of Dreadmoor or Crypt of the Necrodancer minus the rhythmic part, you start to get a pretty good idea of what Tangledeep is like.

376
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I'm actually really glad you brought up Crypt of the Necrodancer yourself because I wasn't sure if it would have been like, is this going to be offensive if I say when I watched the trailer I totally got a Crypt of the Necrodancer vibe off of it but like a different style of game?

377
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:42,000
No, that game is incredible and I actually had the opportunity. I worked on it a little bit on the music side of things. I mixed the metal version of the soundtrack.

378
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:49,000
So I had a little bit of a hand in it and so I'm a little biased but it really is an incredible game.

379
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Now what I thought was interesting about your Kickstarter and what I see as a trend a little bit in 2017, at least I say that because we just had some guys here on our last episode two weeks ago.

380
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:09,000
They made a game called Little Tanks and they did a very similar Kickstarter where they had already kind of done their game and this was what you were doing is that you were doing this game no matter what.

381
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Like you've already poured yourself into this game. You're going to make this game happen but you were going to Kickstarter to ask for money to basically put a layer of polish on it. Would that be the way to describe it?

382
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Yeah, definitely.

383
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:30,000
So and not only did you make what you asked for but you made twice as much which is allowing you, you're going to have these guest contributors now like several guest musicians, right?

384
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:37,000
And some more fluid art, right? What do we have to look forward to for all this money that's been raised on Kickstarter?

385
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:53,000
So one of the main things that I wanted to do going in was, of course even though I write music myself, I was saying, gee, wouldn't it be awesome if I could actually get as guest composers people that I grew up listening to when I was playing games.

386
00:29:53,000 --> 00:30:02,000
So one of the composers was Hiroki Kikuda who is Secret of Mana and Seiken Densetsu 3 are the notable ones from that Super Nintendo period.

387
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:15,000
So he's going to be on board. And then as the Kickstarter was going on and we hit the goal and I was like, oh, I need some stretch goals now because I didn't think it was going to exceed the goal and certainly not that quickly.

388
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:25,000
So Grant Kirkhope who composed many of the rare soundtracks like GoldenEye and Donkey Kong 64 and he's been active ever since.

389
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:34,000
But those two are going to be contributing as composers and there's some other people that I can't announce it yet but that are going to be coming on board.

390
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:47,000
But on the art side, the animations, like you said, put another layer of just fluidity like running animations for all the characters because it's a surprising amount of work when you're doing all this hand-drawn sprite stuff.

391
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:58,000
And the big difference between an 8-bit style game like NES and a 16-bit one, there's just way more colors, there's more sprite resolution.

392
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:06,000
So like the one area of the game, for example, might be 1600 by 900 pixels or something like that which doesn't sound like a lot.

393
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:16,000
That's like one screen, right? On an average size monitor. But then when you think every single one of those pixels is being drawn by hand, it's a huge amount of work.

394
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
So that's what that money is going to do. It's more polished for the game, like you said.

395
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Awesome. Well, congratulations again. Obviously, there's a lot of enthusiasm for it.

396
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:33,000
And if people want to check out the game, you just released your last public build today, right? So people can actually check this out in progress, right?

397
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Yeah, absolutely. So the game that all the backers are playing right now, it's the same one that anybody can play even if you didn't back it.

398
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:46,000
If you go to tangledeep.com, there are links on there. And actually, the Kickstarter updates have generally been public.

399
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
So you can also grab it from the Kickstarter page if you just search for Tangledeep.

400
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:58,000
But yeah, going forward from here, I feel like we've now hit a little over 50% what I consider to be complete on the game.

401
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:06,000
So a lot of the gameplay is there. A lot of the art is there. But at this point on, I feel like it's now starting to get to the point where

402
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I want to think about getting it on Steam Early Access so that people that do want to keep following it, but maybe they missed the Kickstarter,

403
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:20,000
but they kind of wanted to wait and see. So that was the big thing with the Kickstarter in general.

404
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:31,000
The reason why I wanted to go on there when I already had a year of work was I think a lot of people, rightfully, feel like they've been burned on Kickstarter projects before.

405
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:37,000
I'm sure a lot of people have backed things that maybe didn't turn out the way they wanted.

406
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:45,000
I definitely don't want to name any specific names, but there have been even high-profile projects that have just not panned out the way people wanted.

407
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:53,000
So I figured I want to really show good faith, and not only here's the playable thing, but I'm going to keep updating it even after the Kickstarter ends

408
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:59,000
so people really get a sense of what this game is about and what it's like to play.

409
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Even watching your pitch video, it seemed very clear to me that you knew a lot of what makes people nervous about Kickstarters,

410
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:14,000
and you kind of let your resume be out there and all that. I personally think you kind of hit all the right points where Kickstarter should be in 2017

411
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,000
as to why I should give you my money, and I think that speaks to probably why you did so well.

412
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Oh, thank you. I definitely want to deliver on everything. I feel like the best way to show, you could have a million credits,

413
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:36,000
but if you just come up with either nothing at all, which has happened before on Kickstarter, stuff just doesn't come out,

414
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:43,000
or if you come up with something bad that hurts everybody's faith in the whole platform. So have something to show. I think that's just super important.

415
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Let me take a big step back here and ask you a little bit about, you're very well known for the music that you've done,

416
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
and you haven't just done OC Remix, even though we've talked a lot about that.

417
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Obviously that was a big part of your beginnings, but you went on to actually make music.

418
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,000
I know you've done some work with Video Games Live and some of the Kickstarters they've done.

419
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I know Soulcalibur V, you've worked with that, and you've worked with some big games.

420
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Why now, from making music to making the game, what made you decide, I want to go for something even bigger when it comes to the game?

421
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
I want to do the game.

422
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Man, I've always wanted to do this. What it boils down to, I've always been sort of a tech-minded guy, I guess.

423
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Like a lot of gamers, honestly. I got a Game Boy and I loved it, I got a Super Nintendo and I love that.

424
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:45,000
And for as long as I can remember, I was always interested in what it would be like to create my own game.

425
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,000
And I never had the tools or the know-how to do it. I didn't apply myself to that, I guess.

426
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,000
It was more fun for me to just write it down on paper, that kind of thing.

427
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:02,000
And I dabbled in some kind of simple script-based stuff, so back in the day we had IRC, if anybody remembers that.

428
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Our chat room is actually still powered by IRC, basically.

429
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Oh, excellent.

430
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Some things haven't changed since 2002.

431
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Yeah, OC Remix Discord only, I think that was 2016.

432
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Yeah, everybody's telling us to change to Slack or Discord at this point, and I'm like, but I like the old one, it's not broken.

433
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Yeah, that was our point of view, exactly. But ever since those days, I always wanted to create something.

434
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:43,000
And I have my parents, I think one of the things that sort of pushed me was that my parents recently, last year, sold the house that I grew up in.

435
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:52,000
They gave me a lot of my stuff that it kind of accumulated, that it held onto, and I just had hundreds and hundreds of papers of all these game ideas and everything.

436
00:35:52,000 --> 00:36:01,000
And I just thought, you know what, I'm almost 30, I'm 29 right now, I want to just take these steps, I want to do this thing that I've always wanted to do.

437
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:13,000
And just looking back, I could physically see, age seven, I'm actually looking in the corner of my eye, I have a book, it's titled Thinking Up and Drawing Monsters by Andrea Versa.

438
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:21,000
So it's this little school project I did, I guess, but I've always wanted to do this, so I threw myself into it.

439
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:27,000
I'm hung up on something for a minute. You're only 29, and you started this a year after we started doing OLR.

440
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,000
You were 16 when you had your first paid gig for music.

441
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Yeah, technically yes, and I remember my mom said I couldn't sign the contract, so she signed it for me. It was $15 per track for four tracks.

442
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Oh my gosh.

443
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Yeah, I'm getting that $60, I can buy three quarters of Chrono Trigger.

444
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:59,000
No, that's amazing though, that's awesome. I was doing public access TV around that same age, and it led to this, so I still don't get a dime for this, but that's alright.

445
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:13,000
I want to ask a little bit about how you got empowered a little bit more as a programmer, because I notice on your website you give tips for people that are interested in getting into music, and I love that.

446
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:22,000
One thing that I really love that has come up on this show a lot in the past year is that if you want to make a game, there's so many tools out there for people to go and do that.

447
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Just a month ago we were talking about the indie arcade event here.

448
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
I tried to do it before you have a family, because they really put a damper on everything.

449
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:34,000
There's a running gag where Loki has an unfinished game here if you want to wear it.

450
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Anyway, so you really put together a guide about, hey, if you want to get into doing music, here's some ideas, here's some software, and all that good stuff.

451
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:48,000
But what did you do, what helped you cross over into programming?

452
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:58,000
So what I'll say is that, first of all, I'll feel 100% more confident about answering anything like this once it's done.

453
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Even though I have a playable thing, I know I've done some things, but I'll try to answer it anyway.

454
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:17,000
One of the big things, and this is maybe just my personality, but I read a lot about getting into game development.

455
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,000
And a lot of people were like, alright, well you've got to start out and you've got to make a simple game.

456
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Make Pong, make Space Invaders, make Pac-Man or something like that.

457
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:31,000
And I kept reading it and I just thought to myself, man, I don't want to do that. I just want to make the game that I want to make.

458
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
I don't want to skip everything.

459
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Sorry, go ahead.

460
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:45,000
No, it's just like the thought of having to kind of build up into it was just not appealing to me.

461
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:51,000
And it was the same thing with music. Once I started making music on the computer, it was like, I want to make a Phantasy Star IV remix.

462
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,000
I'm just going to do it. It was awful, but I just did it.

463
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:01,000
And so I had sort of a concept in mind when I started out.

464
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:08,000
And everything that I applied myself to in terms of learning, I'm using Unity, which is of course very popular.

465
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
It's probably like a third of games at least use Unity.

466
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:21,000
I kind of focused on learning Unity within the framework of the specific game I wanted to make.

467
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Which is probably not the right way to do it necessarily.

468
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,000
But it's extremely satisfying. It's very motivating.

469
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:34,000
So I would say, okay, I know I want to have sprites, so how do I draw a sprite on the screen?

470
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Okay, got that. How do I make something that the player can click on pop up on the screen?

471
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Because it's a role-playing game, so you need to have menus and stuff. Okay, got that. Next.

472
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:52,000
So if I were kind of taking the approach of, I need to learn everything about programming and Unity from the start,

473
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:58,000
then I'd be learning all this stuff that I wouldn't necessarily apply to this project.

474
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Because again, I'm not saying it's necessarily the right way to do it.

475
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:08,000
But taking that piece-by-piece approach and then just iterating over and over like, okay, here's the game, here's a sprite,

476
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:13,000
and now I can move it around. And now there's a monster, and now I can attack the monster, and now the monster moves around too.

477
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:21,000
So doing it step-by-step kept me motivated, and I would just go online, look at a tutorial or something for the next feature that I wanted to do.

478
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:27,000
And then also having people that I could talk to that had Unity experience.

479
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
And there are some great Discord chats for that.

480
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:38,000
And I have to thank also, there's a friend of mine, Jim Shepherd, who I wrote music for several of his games now.

481
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:43,000
And he's just a master programmer. He's got a long history of AAA experience.

482
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,000
And so to be able to talk to him too was a big help anytime I hit a wall.

483
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Which of course I would, because I didn't do it in the right order.

484
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Well, I've heard, and I'm sorry, I was kind of interrupting you a minute ago, but I was having a laugh,

485
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:02,000
because I've heard the whole, you have to make Pac-Man, you have to make Pong thing as well.

486
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
And I think that's probably how you have to do it for most people.

487
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
But I think at the end of the day, you have to do what works for you.

488
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
And I think even probably Loki would agree to this, which is why I'm laughing,

489
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
because he almost said the exact same thing on the show not that long ago,

490
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,000
is that I can't just do Pac-Man. I have to do what I want to do.

491
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Because it's boring. And it's not that it's necessary to finish something,

492
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:28,000
but I was even trying to teach myself the rest of C-Sharp outside of Unity,

493
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
because I kind of taught myself a little bit of C-Sharp for Unity,

494
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
but I was like, I wonder how different it is outside of Unity.

495
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
It's so boring. I just don't want to do it.

496
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Exactly. I mean, it's different, I think, if you were doing it in a structured environment,

497
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:49,000
like you're taking a class. I never took any classes in game development or anything like that.

498
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
When you're teaching yourself, there's so much out there.

499
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I just feel like if you're going to devote your nights and weekends,

500
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
which is what I was doing for a long time with Tangledeep,

501
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
whatever just little bit of free time I had,

502
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:08,000
I want to show something for it. I don't want to just spend my weekend on this,

503
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
and then like, hey, I think I didn't want to make.

504
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
That's just the lowest amount of motivation you could have.

505
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Well, I understand your hesitation to talk about all the programming stuff

506
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,000
when the game isn't out yet, but look, you've got something out there,

507
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,000
and I don't think you're going to jinx yourself at all.

508
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:33,000
I think people will be very happy with the finished product, so congratulations on what you've self-taught

509
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:39,000
and otherwise learned through other people networking with other people you've worked with before.

510
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,000
I want to ask you about this before I get to some of our chatter questions

511
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,000
because we are, again, taking questions in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

512
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Yeah, one of the backers is actually chiming in our chat room right now.

513
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Strixel says, backer chiming in that Tangledeep as is is very good and fun.

514
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
So there's a little reaffirmation for you.

515
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

516
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
But what I wanted to point out, because I thought this was really cool,

517
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
is that with the soundtracks and with the music,

518
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:08,000
since that was the bread and butter before game programming,

519
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
you're going a two-soundtrack approach with this thing,

520
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
and you can actually check out on SoundCloud.

521
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:18,000
You've got modern, regular orchestral soundtracks,

522
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
but then you have Super Nintendo-style soundtracks.

523
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:27,000
It's the same soundtrack, but then you kind of redid it in a Super Nintendo music-making program, right?

524
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Yeah, so I don't know if my wife is listening to this right now.

525
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
She might be. She's in the other room right now,

526
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,000
so she can probably hear my side of the conversation if she's not actually tuned in.

527
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:41,000
So that's her idea, basically.

528
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:48,000
I want to say that because my initial thought was I just wanted to do it Super Nintendo-style.

529
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:54,000
That was actually because I have such nostalgia for those games,

530
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:59,000
and that's a product of my age and what I grew up playing.

531
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
But she was kind of listening to what I wrote and saying,

532
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,000
she doesn't have the Super Nintendo nostalgia. They had a Genesis.

533
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,000
And so she was thinking, I don't have any connection to these sounds.

534
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
And a lot of other people don't. Anybody younger, they're not going to have the same connection.

535
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,000
She was like, you should take this, and you should make it into a modern soundtrack.

536
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,000
And at first I was like, oh, I don't know. It's going to be more work.

537
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:26,000
But then when I actually tried it and took the main dungeon theme and I started doing it,

538
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:34,000
and I started adding some live parts in too, I was like, wow, actually, this really is a good idea.

539
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,000
So I really have to thank her for that suggestion.

540
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:43,000
And yeah, I'm going to do it for the whole soundtrack with the order of starting with the Super Nintendo stuff

541
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,000
and doing it authentically like that, and it's all general MIDI.

542
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:53,000
No fancy samples or anything like that. And then taking it and blowing it up into the modern production.

543
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
So that's the workflow.

544
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Well, Jill is listening. She's in chat, so we were able to give her a big blow there.

545
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:04,000
But that's a neat story because I would have assumed for some reason,

546
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
I mean, again, I would have assumed it went the other way around,

547
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:12,000
that the modern was first and then it kind of was deconstructed to Super Nintendo.

548
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
But that's really interesting that it actually is the other way. That's really cool.

549
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:19,000
So let me get to some of our, I know we're getting to our time here,

550
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
but I want to get to a few listener questions over at live.vognetwork.com.

551
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Let me get to this question. I love this question from SSG100Matt who asks,

552
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:32,000
do you plan to come back and or perform at MAGFest?

553
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:39,000
I definitely am going to be at MAGFest. I've been going for, I don't know, like seven years now.

554
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:44,000
And I don't normally do any kind of live performance stuff. It's usually not my thing.

555
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:50,000
But Ocean's Andrew, OA, who is a remixer on OCR and Judge,

556
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,000
and he's Overclock University is part of that as well.

557
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,000
And also he happens to be the environmental and UI artist for Tanglebeef.

558
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
So it's like a lot of connections to him.

559
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:05,000
He has roped me into some sort of DJ set at MAGFest.

560
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,000
So I don't know exactly what I'm going to be doing for that,

561
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:13,000
but I will have a DJ set ready and I'll be doing something.

562
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:18,000
I will be sure to check it out. You know, I actually, thanks to some of our listeners here at OLR,

563
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,000
I got tuned on to go into MAGFest. I went for my second year this last January.

564
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,000
I had a blast. Like it's just a great call. I flew from California to go.

565
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Like I know we're getting our own version, but it's not going to be the same.

566
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Like I shouldn't say that. I really shouldn't say it, but it's not going to be the same as the DC one.

567
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
You know, that's an amazing convention. I'm really...

568
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Yeah, I can't recommend it enough. It's so cool.

569
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Yeah, and hopefully the West Coast one does get a lot of the same vibe.

570
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:47,000
I definitely will go and check it out for sure, but there's something about the Prime site.

571
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Anyway, I want to go to another chat comment from Strixel here at live.vognetwork.com who says,

572
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
What drew you to roguelikes?

573
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Oh, that's a great question.

574
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:12,000
So, Roguelikes, that's been a genre favorite of mine for a long time,

575
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,000
because ever since Castle of the Winds on PC,

576
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:22,000
and I was just thinking about that because Jim Shepherd, Dungeon Man,

577
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,000
who I just mentioned, that was an inspiration for him as well,

578
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
like the Castle of the Winds, and that's been around for a long, long time.

579
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:35,000
And I've always liked that genre because I guess I'm the kind of person

580
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:42,000
that will tend to memorize and kind of play a little more the optimal way if I can.

581
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,000
So in other words, if I play the same level a million times,

582
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,000
go for the fastest route, go for the best build, I kind of just gravitate towards that.

583
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:55,000
And roguelikes really make it much harder to do that because everything is procedurally generated,

584
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
it's adding that extra layer of challenge, and it's always engaging

585
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,000
because you can't just rely on memory every time,

586
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:05,000
because so much of it is randomly generated.

587
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:10,000
So that is the big thing that drew me into it ever since the days of Castle of the Winds,

588
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,000
which I think you can play for free now, actually, and it's still a good game.

589
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
It definitely doesn't look too good, but it's still a great game.

590
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Yeah, I remember the original actual Rogue.

591
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,000
I think it was a cartridge, maybe a disc on my Commodore 64.

592
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:27,000
We had the actual game Rogue. I think Epyx published it for a time there.

593
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:32,000
And if you guys out there, if you've never played the original old-school Rogue,

594
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
it's still worth a look.

595
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,000
You might kind of be turned off by the fact that it's just like ASCII art,

596
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:43,000
there's no real graphics, but you see where that comes from,

597
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
where all these other games have been birthed because of this classic.

598
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
It's really something.

599
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Anyway, Zircon, I really want to thank you for taking the time out to be on our show this week.

600
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,000
I want to wish you the best of luck with Tangledeep and its release,

601
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,000
which is targeted for December this year, right?

602
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Yeah, and I do not intend on missing that.

603
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
I'm working very hard to make sure that we hit that.

604
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Everything is kind of scoped and planned around it,

605
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,000
and I went out of my way to make sure that with Kickstarter,

606
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
I was so tempted to say things like,

607
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,000
I'm going to do a world map, and I'm going to do ten new features,

608
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:23,000
but I've got to stick to the scope that I have in mind

609
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,000
so that it does not go over time, and we get it out this year.

610
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Well, yeah, you even had your little project plan out there

611
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
for everybody to look at on the Kickstarter.

612
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
I did. We'll see how badly I missed it.

613
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Oh, stop, stop. I'm sure we'll be fine.

614
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
If people want to follow the progress, I know Twitter is a good spot.

615
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:44,000
The game is at Tangledeepgame, is the Twitter that they can follow.

616
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Your personal Twitter, should I give that out, too, for following?

617
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Yeah, absolutely, yeah, at zirconst.

618
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Awesome. Any other websites or things we need to plug while you're here?

619
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:59,000
If you go to tangledeep.com, I forget if I don't have the link,

620
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,000
I'll have it up there tonight, but we actually have a Discord chat,

621
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,000
which is cool. It's a general chat about the game.

622
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
I post builds and stuff.

623
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Sometimes I stream game development on Twitch,

624
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,000
and there's also a place where you can report bugs or talk about balance.

625
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,000
It's pretty active, actually, and Strix is in there.

626
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Yeah, it's cool. If that link is not on the site, it will be soon.

627
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
All right, awesome.

628
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Again, Zircon, I want to thank you for being on the show,

629
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,000
and I'll be looking forward to Tangledeep this December,

630
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,000
and I'll be looking forward to MAGFest 2018 as well.

631
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,000
All right, sounds good, and thank you for having me.

632
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Hey, no problem. You take care.

633
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
All right, bye-bye.

634
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,000
All right, that is Zircon from the game Tangledeep,

635
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
but also the long career of music making

636
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,000
that goes all the way back to OC Remix

637
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:51,000
and moving on to commercial releases like Soulcalibur V.

638
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,000
I mean, the man's just done a lot when it comes to video game music,

639
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,000
and now getting on the other end of the rest of the game development.

640
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
I know he has some help, too.

641
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
I didn't give him a chance to...

642
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Well, he shouted out one of his art guys,

643
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
two other people he's working with, to make that game happen,

644
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
and wishing them much, much success,

645
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,000
and you guys will have to keep an eye on that

646
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
and check out that game when it releases.

647
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
All right, well, speaking of checking out games,

648
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,000
we like to... Again, this is a three-hour show, y'all.

649
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
We still got some news to get into for the week.

650
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
I want to get into, of course, though, a little bit about

651
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
how are the games that you've been playing this week,

652
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,000
as a little bit of a frame of the reference here at the top of the show.

653
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?

654
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
It was moderately eventful.

655
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
I've been playing...

656
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:38,000
I beat, during the last two weeks, I beat Mass Effect Andromeda,

657
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:44,000
and I am on my second play-through, aiming for 100% play-through on that one.

658
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,000
I went back to World of Warcraft since the new patch for Legion came out,

659
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:54,000
and I've been a little disappointed with how few world quests there have been,

660
00:51:54,000 --> 00:52:04,000
because I'm really trying to get the Revered for my faction so that I can fly.

661
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:10,000
And so I'll finish the quest in an hour, and I'm like, okay, where's more?

662
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
But there's one thing I can't do, because it's a solo fight

663
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:17,000
that's clearly something that should have been done for five people, so whatever.

664
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Other than that, Miitomo, Pokemon Go,

665
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,000
although I haven't been able to do a lot of walking with it since...

666
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
I'm supposed to be wearing a boot.

667
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Das Boot.

668
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
A walking boot. It's called Das Boot.

669
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:36,000
I told Dan the other day that I could probably smite my enemies with that boot.

670
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Fantas in our chat wants to know, is Mass Effect Andromeda worth 100%ing?

671
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Yeah, I think it is, because I missed quite a few things on my first play-through

672
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
that I kind of wish I had gone back and gotten.

673
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:51,000
There's actually even a few quests that I think you can't go back and do

674
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
if you've missed them the first time around.

675
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:57,000
I had the thing forum on my journal, but I couldn't find the points to do it.

676
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
It just wasn't showing up on the map.

677
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
And maybe they'll patch that again.

678
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:06,000
The last patch actually did quite a bit, at least for the aesthetics of the game.

679
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,000
There's some people who still walk kind of funny,

680
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,000
but for the most part, it's been pretty good.

681
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,000
I've hit a weird wall with Mass Effect Andromeda.

682
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:19,000
I didn't beat it, and I don't want to say I'm uninspired,

683
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:23,000
but I've just been allowing myself to get distracted with other games,

684
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
and I'm like, I'll come back to Andromeda.

685
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,000
It sounds like they have a few more things I kind of want to work on,

686
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
so I'm not really in a rush to beat it.

687
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
My only thing is I want to avoid spoilers,

688
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,000
but I know you're good enough you're not going to spoil it.

689
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Shane knows I'll kick his ass if he spoils it.

690
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Otherwise, I'm kind of like, I'll take my time,

691
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,000
and I'll get around to beating it eventually when it's kind of all patched up.

692
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,000
But I feel like I might have painted myself into a corner a little bit

693
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
because I'm not getting any of the loyalty missions,

694
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,000
and I'm understanding I'm kind of close to the end of the game.

695
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Make sure that you select the journals for the characters,

696
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,000
and it'll give you what you're waiting on or what to do next.

697
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,000
That really, really helped me because there's a lot of them

698
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:13,000
that require a certain event to happen before the next string of the loyalty mission.

699
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:21,000
And I did all the loyalty missions before doing the Archon ship mission.

700
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:25,000
And it'll actually say Archon ship mission, so it's not a spoiler.

701
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:29,000
But I did them all before that because I thought that was the big thing,

702
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
and it wasn't the big thing.

703
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
But you can get them done pretty quickly.

704
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Okay. Okay. I think I've actually done the Archon ship

705
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,000
and still don't have them unlocked, so that's the thing that's concerning me.

706
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Were Salarians involved?

707
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Yes. Yes, they were. Yes, they were. Okay.

708
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
So then you still have time to do them.

709
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Interesting. Okay. I'll go back at some point,

710
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
but I'll talk about my gaming week in a minute here.

711
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
I've just been distracted with other stuff, and it's like,

712
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Mass Effect Andromeda will be there tomorrow.

713
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,000
I don't have to rush to beat it in a week.

714
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
I've got bedding. Oh, sorry.

715
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Am I putting you to sleep with my Mass Effect?

716
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:07,000
No, I'm on allergy meds because of all the pollen and shit that's kicked in.

717
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:15,000
But I will say this, that it's a lot easier now to make a decent-looking character.

718
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,000
I know why they did all the presets.

719
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:22,000
I mean, I'm pretty sure it's because it affects the way that, you know,

720
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Daddy Rider looks, but still.

721
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Okay. Yeah.

722
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Well, if that's it for your gaming week, let me go to Loki.

723
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
How was your gaming week?

724
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Well, I played a few different things.

725
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,000
I played a little bit more Skyrim. Not that much.

726
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,000
I finished the quest line I was on, so that's done.

727
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:44,000
And then I played a little bit more of Thimbleweed Park, which is fun.

728
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:48,000
It's like that old LucasArts adventure game style type of game,

729
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,000
because it's done by the people that did that.

730
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:56,000
And I'm enjoying it, so that's pretty fun.

731
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,000
And then I got sucked into another idol clicker game.

732
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Oh, Jesus.

733
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
This one, I don't know, it's somewhat entertaining.

734
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
It's pretty relaxing.

735
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:11,000
It's Office Space Idol Profits or something like that.

736
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Obviously, it's a license from the movie, and the whole thing is-

737
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Oh, it's legit. Oh.

738
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Yeah, the whole thing is based off of just planting your virus

739
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:24,000
in all the different floors in the building and you extracting pennies.

740
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
You know I finally broke up with clicker heroes on PS4.

741
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Like, I'm done. And you know what did it?

742
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:35,000
I spent 80 hero souls on accident by hitting the wrong damn button on the screen.

743
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:38,000
And I was like, fuck this, I'm out.

744
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
That's finally what shut it down for me.

745
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Yeah, I never really got into it.

746
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,000
You can't undo stuff like that. That pissed me off.

747
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Yeah, I tried it a little bit and I was just like, eh, I'm not really into this.

748
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,000
But, yeah, so I've been playing that a little bit.

749
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
And then, of course, Pokémon Go, just the daily stuff.

750
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
I hit 26 the other day.

751
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Congrats.

752
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Just playing, you know, five minutes here, five minutes there.

753
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,000
I mean, I don't know. Not that gung ho into it.

754
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:09,000
But I'm not playing Ingress, so, you know, it's something.

755
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:13,000
And what else? Oh, I did pick up Everything,

756
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:17,000
which is some weird, like, artsy game that has really bad animation for their animals.

757
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
And I thought that was funny. And only because of that.

758
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:23,000
And I actually did try to play, there was another game called Epic Battle Simulator

759
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:26,000
that does not run on my computer at all.

760
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:30,000
I tried to play it and it's just like, my computer's like, what the fuck are you trying to do with me here?

761
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,000
I can't run this shit. I'm too old.

762
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,000
So, I was going to play that, though, because that's funny.

763
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:42,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,

764
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
use the passphrase, meet.

765
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Alright, is that it for gaming week?

766
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
That's it.

767
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Well, then I will talk about my gaming week here briefly.

768
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:54,000
So, yeah, like I said, I haven't been playing as much Mass Effect Andromeda.

769
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Still been playing, of course, Final Fantasy XIV.

770
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Here's the other game I randomly, and I mean randomly, just got back into,

771
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,000
and that is playing Diablo III, but specifically on PlayStation 4.

772
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Do you guys remember, like, two and a half years ago, I think it was, I said,

773
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
I'm going to platinum this damn game.

774
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:14,000
And then, of course, because Rob can't ever, like, I have the worst gamer ADD in the world,

775
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,000
I can't ever stick with one game, I never got around to platinuming it.

776
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Well, okay, I haven't platinumed it yet, but I'm really, I have two trophies left to go.

777
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:27,000
So, I actually, I got my hardcore character to 70, and I picked up some other trophies that I needed.

778
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:33,000
The last ones I have to get are, get all six classes to level 70, which sounds hard,

779
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:38,000
but once you get the experience gem from running greater rifts, and level it to 25,

780
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:43,000
it's actually, like, my Crusader, I leveled to level 51 in, like, a night, so it's, like, super easy.

781
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Like, and when I say a night, I mean, like, an hour and a half.

782
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:51,000
So, that part's going to be easy. The 500 bounties is the part that's going to kill me,

783
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:55,000
because I'm only up to, like, 240 right now, maybe, so that's, like, not even half.

784
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,000
So, I just have to do bounties, bounties, and more bounties.

785
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:03,000
But it looks like it's in reach, and so I actually will finally platinum this damn game, knock on wood,

786
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,000
if I don't get distracted by something shiny in the next couple weeks.

787
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,000
I will finally platinum this damn game about three years after I said I would.

788
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
So, there you go.

789
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:15,000
One of the games I checked out this week, I checked out Puyo Puyo Tetris,

790
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,000
which is now on the Nintendo Switch, and that's where I checked this game out.

791
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,000
I know it's been out on PS4 and some other places for a while,

792
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,000
and I was a little slower to get around to it, plus I wanted to, you know, I liked the whole,

793
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:30,000
it's on the TV, no, now I can play it in bed, or wherever my Switch is.

794
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:37,000
So, yeah, I mean, the story is, like, it's kind of nonexistent, it's just, it's anime trash.

795
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:42,000
And I don't, I'm not calling all anime trash, I'm saying this specifically is anime trash.

796
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,000
But that's fine, like, sometimes you live for a bad movie,

797
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:49,000
and I think some people are getting their memes and stuff off of this game,

798
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
and that's fine, there's a lot of silly stuff.

799
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:56,000
But when it comes down to it, there's a very competent just, like, base Tetris mode that you can play,

800
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,000
or a base Puyo Puyo mode that you can play,

801
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,000
and it's like you get both those games in one package and it's cool.

802
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:06,000
And yes, they did some interesting little things where they actually have a mode

803
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,000
that involves Tetris blocks and Puyo Puyo at the same time,

804
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:12,000
and it's like the blocks push through the Puyos,

805
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:17,000
so you can kind of, like, you can cause a delay trick where the Puyos will come back.

806
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
So it's like you're playing both games at the same time.

807
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,000
It's complicated, but it's kind of fun.

808
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:27,000
So I like that it's different, but that you can also just play Tetris or Puyo Puyo if you want.

809
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:33,000
When I got it for PlayStation 4, Dan and I would, I would pick the Puyo side, he would pick the Tetris side.

810
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Yeah, and you can do that, and you can still send each other lines and trash.

811
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:43,000
It was really fun. I mean, he was, we were pretty on equal footing because I'm really,

812
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:47,000
I mean, I used to be really good at Puyo Puyo, I'm out of practice, but it's a fun game.

813
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:52,000
You know, I just was really surprised that they took so long to bring it out in the US.

814
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,000
It's been out, like, three years already, to my recollection.

815
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Well, they don't do Puyo games very often here.

816
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
We got quite a few of them.

817
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:05,000
I know they did Kirby's Avalanche and all that stuff back in the day, but I mean, Puyo Puyo games as Puyo Puyo.

818
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:12,000
We had Puyo Pop, which was Puyo Puyo, and we had, um, there were a couple of other Puyo Puyo games that came out over here.

819
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
It just feels like we don't get as many as they do over there, but anyway.

820
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,000
We even got the little Puyolin, the little handheld LCD toy.

821
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:21,000
They're probably, they're probably, it's probably more prevalent now than it was 10 years ago.

822
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:28,000
But anyway, I had a similar thing. I was playing actually online against a friend of mine who can kind of murder people at Tetris.

823
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:34,000
I was not ready for him getting, like, seven Tetrises in a row. I shit you not, like, he can do that.

824
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
And I was like, oh god.

825
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:43,000
But when I was playing Puyo, and he was playing Tetris, he can't, he doesn't, he's still learning Puyo, so he can't set up the chains in Puyo.

826
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Whereas I know enough to actually set up very basic two and three chains in Puyo.

827
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,000
So we had a match that went on a little while.

828
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Still, he killed me because I, you just can't compete with somebody that can get Tetris after Tetris after Tetris.

829
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:00,000
But it was still fun. And the online mode actually worked, so there's that.

830
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:06,000
I've also been playing Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, which just came out on the Switch a couple days ago.

831
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Since it just came out a couple days ago, excuse me, I'm still getting over the cold.

832
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Since it just came out a couple days ago, I haven't had the chance to spend a lot of time with it.

833
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:20,000
But I will just say this, it does look gorgeous on the Switch's, like, built-in screen.

834
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Like, that little HD screen with the Switch is just, like, it's so bright and vibrant and pops.

835
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Like, it's really cool.

836
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,000
And I'm really looking forward to meeting up with some other people who have it,

837
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:34,000
so we can all kind of play Mario Kart in the wireless mode.

838
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
So, that'll be fun.

839
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:41,000
I'm hoping to also play a little bit after tonight's show, which, to follow up this comment in chat,

840
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
come on, CupidBoy in chat says,

841
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Rob Roberts, why don't you Twitch much?

842
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:51,000
For one, I kind of have to, like, when I do a Twitch, I don't want to just play the game.

843
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:54,000
I want to be lively and talk about it and talk with people.

844
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:58,000
And sometimes you kind of have to, you know, that takes a little bit of extrovertedness,

845
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:03,000
and sometimes I just want to not have that for a night, so I don't always want to stream.

846
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:07,000
But also, this is the other big reason, I really wanted to do some more streaming this past week,

847
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
but then I got sick.

848
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,000
So, I've been sick for, like, the past, like, I'm not even kidding, week and a half.

849
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Like, it's just now finally leaving, so that's been a big stopper for that, too.

850
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:23,000
But I will be doing Mario Kart 8 tonight after the show at twitch.tv slash Rob Roberts,

851
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,000
so you can follow me over there.

852
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:28,000
I will be doing that tonight as an OLR post-show, so there's that.

853
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
I guess that's really everything I wanted to talk about this week.

854
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,000
I feel like there was one more game I wanted to mention,

855
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:36,000
but I guess if I think of it later, I'll mention it later.

856
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,000
But those have been the games I've been taking up most of my time.

857
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:42,000
So, some quick housekeeping.

858
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:49,000
There will be no show on June 25th, I think is the date.

859
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
I'm trying to remember what Sunday is near there.

860
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
I'm actually going to be out of town.

861
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:58,000
I realize I'm well aware that falls right around the anniversary of Orange Lounge Radio.

862
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:05,000
We will be celebrating 15 years of Orange Lounge Radio on June 18th will be the big show.

863
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:08,000
And the reward for 15 years of Orange Lounge Radio?

864
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:11,000
A week off without being sick.

865
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
A week off for vacation purposes.

866
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
That will be the big reward.

867
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:18,000
I'm going to be going to Chicago to visit some friends and taking Alan out there,

868
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
so I'll be having a good time.

869
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:23,000
And hopefully Dark Soccer and Loki will have some fun around here.

870
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,000
But that's still a couple months off.

871
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:28,000
That's our next planned show off June 18th.

872
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Excuse me, June 25th, because June 18th will be such a big show.

873
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
15 years of OLR, if you can believe it.

874
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
I need to get a pretty dress.

875
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,000
A key senior address?

876
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Why not? I'll go to the thrift store and get something out of the 80s.

877
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Should we? Do I want to commit ourselves to this?

878
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Alright, fuck it. I'm just going to put it out there. We'll do it live.

879
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Do we want to bring back a video camera for June 18th and do the show on Twitch as a special little here we are?

880
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Maybe.

881
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Oh, that's some progress out of Dark Soccer.

882
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,000
I'll stay off camera.

883
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Alright.

884
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
You can look at my dress.

885
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
You need to go full on nunnery.

886
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,000
No, because I'm not a novice yet.

887
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Okay, I guess you can. Alright.

888
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Yeah, I can only manifest when I am with my big sister.

889
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
I see. Alright. Well, maybe.

890
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:20,000
And for those who don't know, I am a postulant as a sister of Perpetual Indulgence.

891
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,000
So, look it up.

892
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Clap, clap, clap.

893
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Okay, well, aside from that, you could do full on BioQueen drag, though, if you wanted, right?

894
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,000
That's not against the rules.

895
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:32,000
You know what? I will channel Valentina.

896
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
You can beat your face for the gods.

897
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:38,000
For the record. You saw the last episode, right?

898
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Yes.

899
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:42,000
I loved her lack of outfit. Just saying.

900
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,000
It was brilliant.

901
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,000
That was inspired.

902
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:49,000
You will have to come on reading is fundamental to talk about that, but we got to get back to video games.

903
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Valentina.

904
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:55,000
Alright, let's talk about video games. We got to get into gaming news this week. Loki, start us off.

905
01:05:55,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Well, Nintendo announced, because they don't have unlimited resources, that they're going to put out yet another system that no one asked for.

906
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:11,000
So, Nintendo announced that they're going to be releasing a 2DS XL system for $149.99.

907
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:14,000
It's going to be available on July 28th.

908
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Unlike the original 2DS, it's in a clamshell form factor, so it's like an actual DS.

909
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Just not 3D.

910
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:29,000
But it's got all the new 3DS hardware inside.

911
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:36,000
The 2DS thing doesn't actually really bug me because a lot of games are kind of forgoing that these days anyway.

912
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Like, you know, Pokemon Sun and Moon is probably the biggest 3DS game still right now.

913
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:45,000
And only one small portion of that game uses 3D at all.

914
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:52,000
It's the whole, I don't even remember what they call the mode, but it's the Pokemon Snap ripoff that they put into Sun and Moon.

915
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,000
You can actually use 3D there, and that's really the only thing that uses it.

916
01:06:55,000 --> 01:07:01,000
But it's a new 3DS, but in 2D.

917
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:04,000
But it's that whole, the word new.

918
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:12,000
So it will play all those new exclusives like Super Nintendo games and Xenoblade.

919
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,000
And there might be one other I'm not thinking of.

920
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:19,000
So I have to admit, there's a part of me that's just kind of like, eh?

921
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Again, my good old 3DS Triforce edition, I love my gold 3DS, 3DS XL from several years ago is working fine, and I see no need to replace it.

922
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:34,000
And there is nothing here that is screaming to me.

923
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:38,000
I mean, I like the fact that they ripped off the colors of the dress.

924
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:42,000
You remember the infamous dress that's black and blue, or is it gold and white?

925
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
I can't tell what color.

926
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Well, this one is black and turquoise specifically.

927
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
There is a gold and white one as well.

928
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:53,000
So the two SKUs are the two colors of that infamous dress.

929
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,000
I don't know if you got that.

930
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,000
I did not.

931
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,000
But I'm like, wow.

932
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Is that only in Japan that they're doing that?

933
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,000
Because they said there's only one color option here, and that's just the black and turquoise.

934
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
Oh, then maybe it is Japan that's doing it.

935
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Well, Japan's getting a frickin' metal slime one as well that looks awesome.

936
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,000
I don't know if you saw that.

937
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
That one looks awesome.

938
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:14,000
I'm not sure what this is for?

939
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Because, again, if it's a budget thing, I get that, but there's a $99 2DS still on the market.

940
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,000
$79, actually.

941
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Okay, it doesn't fold up and go in your pocket, okay.

942
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:33,000
But still, I'm like, if you're going for a budget option, usually those sorts of things, you know, you're not going to pay what now?

943
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:36,000
It's $50 less, so if you're basically...

944
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:45,000
I don't understand the point of that because it's like you basically said, okay, listen, we're not putting out 3D in our games,

945
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:48,000
but here's a system that doesn't do the 3D for $50 less.

946
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:53,000
They're almost like competing against themselves.

947
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Why does none of this make any sense?

948
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:01,000
I know they're still kind of pushing this too, especially after watching the last Nintendo Direct.

949
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:04,000
They still, you know, they have these Kirby things.

950
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:08,000
They have the Pikmin thing, Cold Sept, which I can't hang on. I love that series.

951
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
You know, they are still trying...

952
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:15,000
But there's also a part of me that's like, just go full tilt boogie on Switch right now.

953
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Don't get me wrong.

954
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Pikmin's a fun game, but how many games in the Pikmin series have we had and how many F-Zero games have we had recently?

955
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
I mean, or Metroid games?

956
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:30,000
I love my 3DS. I'm just not convinced this is...

957
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:35,000
You know, again, I was not convinced ever to upgrade to the new 3DS.

958
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:42,000
This, taking the 3D out and making it a little cheaper is still not convincing me to get rid of the 3DS I have.

959
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Like, I don't have a 3DS or a new 3DS. I mean, this looks cool. I'm not buying one.

960
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:55,000
Yeah, I was gonna say, if you don't have a 3DS at all whatsoever in any form,

961
01:09:55,000 --> 01:10:01,000
there is a huge library of games you're missing out on that you, you know, it's time to just get one and...

962
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
I don't think so, Ian. Here's why.

963
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Because they have a portable system as well called the Nintendo Switch,

964
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:14,000
and I'm very hesitant with Nintendo's track record to trust anything is gonna last forever.

965
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:19,000
So, that's why I'm not jumping on board with this brand new system that they're coming out with,

966
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:23,000
because who the fuck knows when this whole shit was gonna get discontinued?

967
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:29,000
I mean, I'm not, at this point, like I haven't jumped into the 3DS, I'm probably not going to.

968
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:34,000
I mean, that's it. If there was something that I was gonna, you know, it would be worth it,

969
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
and then I would have done it a long time ago.

970
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:41,000
But, you know what, there's people out there I see on Twitter and stuff that are all excited about this system

971
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:45,000
and loving the colors, they're gonna pick it up, so you know, more power to you, good, you know,

972
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
I hope you have fun with it, hope it's worth it for you.

973
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
What if some people pick up everything Nintendo puts out?

974
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Yeah, I'm just kind of like, but if you already have a 3DS, especially if you have a new 3DS already,

975
01:10:54,000 --> 01:11:01,000
it's like, what is this, you're gonna get this for the colors, and I don't know, I don't get it as much,

976
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:08,000
but it's your money, you buy what you want, you go on with yourself, it's fine, but I will be passing.

977
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Unless, you know what, maybe Nintendo at E3 is gonna come out and say, listen up fuckers,

978
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:20,000
the 2DS, that's exactly how Reggie's gonna phrase it, listen up fuckers, 2DS ain't dead,

979
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:25,000
because guess what, we got a new 2D Metroid game coming out on the 2DS this year.

980
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:30,000
I'm gonna be like, really pissed on one hand, but at the same hand I'm gonna be like,

981
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:35,000
ah, you sons of bitches, here's my money, take it, take it, here's more money, take it,

982
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:40,000
take it, what, a special Samus 3DS, fine, take that too, here's my money, enjoy it.

983
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Right.

984
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,000
That's all it's gonna take.

985
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Well, you know what, I stand corrected that there was a Metroid game that got released,

986
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:54,000
how could I forget that there was a Metroid game, oh maybe because it doesn't fucking look like Metroid at all.

987
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,000
We don't count.

988
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,000
Stupid Federation Force, I mean.

989
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
We don't count that, that didn't happen.

990
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,000
That's a pretty good imagination.

991
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:03,000
Garbage, absolute garbage, I don't trust them one bit.

992
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Alright, hey.

993
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:10,000
Hey, we got a new F-Zero game, it's called F-Zero, fuck you, we're not giving you a good game.

994
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:16,000
It's slow ass cars, they're snails now, Super Snails, it's F-Zero, it's fucking snails racing.

995
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Like it or not, and I'm in the not camp, I do believe Mario Kart is Nintendo's all-in racer at this point.

996
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Especially with all the other Nintendo properties they're bringing in, I feel like a new F-Zero game just ain't happening.

997
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:39,000
I would love to be proven wrong more than anything in the world, but I'm done getting my hopes up.

998
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Alright, well here's a game that I think would make me very excited for a 2DS or a 3DS if it happened over there,

999
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:51,000
although I'd rather see it on Switch, but it's something you could actually play on PC right now, at least until they take it down.

1000
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:59,000
This is a user on itch.io named Winter Drake, who has done a game called Breath of the Ness.

1001
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:06,000
That's right, it's the Zelda game, Breath of the Wild, but as a 2D adventure. Does that sound familiar?

1002
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Yeah, that's right, because game developers conference this year, Nintendo had a panel and the developers behind Zelda

1003
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:17,000
were talking about how they originally developed Breath of the Wild in a 2D format with some of the features,

1004
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:24,000
like dynamic weather, destructible objects, some of the things that actually ended up in the game when it hit its 3D form.

1005
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:31,000
So of course, somebody stepped up to the challenge and said, I wonder what this would look like as a real game.

1006
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:39,000
So they made this game. There's a trailer that you're able to look at where you can actually topple trees on enemies,

1007
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:46,000
lure them into dangerous spikes and so on. It has a lot of the elements from Breath of the Wild but in the more 2D format.

1008
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:53,000
So you can check that out again on itch.io, but tomorrow is Monday, that's probably when the lawyers are back in

1009
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:59,000
and the cease and desist will be headed over to this person. The demo is free, you don't have to pay for it.

1010
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Nintendo is probably going to end up shutting it down though, so get it while you can.

1011
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:08,000
But you know what they say, once it's on the internet, it's forever on the internet.

1012
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:15,000
So yeah, that might be worth a look, because I'm sure if you're interested in this, you've already bought Breath of the Wild,

1013
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:20,000
the regular version. If you haven't, you're missing the hell out, because it's one of the...

1014
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,000
I need to play that some more.

1015
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:24,000
It's a fantastic... I need to finish it, really.

1016
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,000
They picked up some new Wii U games this week from my kid.

1017
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,000
Oh yeah?

1018
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:38,000
I picked up Super Mario 3D World and Pokken Tournament, because he's bitching that he doesn't have enough games to play.

1019
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Oh, and guess what? The wonders of doing a live show, this is coming through in the chat room right now.

1020
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:48,000
This looks like this just broke a few hours ago.

1021
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Let's see, here it is. There was a tweet that says, from Winter Drake,

1022
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:59,000
I'm no longer legally able to distribute Breath of the NES, but any donations you made will be spent working on the game.

1023
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:04,000
The game isn't dead, I just won't be using the Zelda characters, it will live on.

1024
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:08,000
That's right, it was ordered, taken down by Nintendo.

1025
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
I'm so shocked.

1026
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:15,000
Shock and awe, but there it is. The tweets are up there.

1027
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:20,000
Oh, the Cease and Desist letter is even posted there for your perusal.

1028
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:26,000
If you want to release something like this to the internet, release it as a goddamn torrent on a torrent site,

1029
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:29,000
because what the fuck are they going to do there?

1030
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Well, it's an interesting thing, because there's a part of me that says,

1031
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:40,000
he should have just from the beginning used the non-Zelda sprites that he's going to obviously change this into now.

1032
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:46,000
He's just going to change all the sprites so that it's a completely different looking type of game, but it's still the same idea.

1033
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:51,000
But at the same time, if he had done that in the very beginning, he wouldn't have gotten all this press.

1034
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:58,000
So, I don't know, there's no easy answer here, there just isn't.

1035
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:02,000
Alright, let's move on with some other gaming news.

1036
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?

1037
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:09,000
I think it is aptly titled in the article as ludicrous.

1038
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
You remember Shaq-Fu?

1039
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Who doesn't?

1040
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Remember that Indiegogo about Shaq-Fu, a legendary born?

1041
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:20,000
I don't, but everything's got a Kickstarter.

1042
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:23,000
It was there, it barely made its goal.

1043
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Well, it has been announced, of course, in 2015 for PS4, Xbox One, PC, and Wii U.

1044
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:36,000
And now it's going to be coming to Switch.

1045
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Although there's commentary that it might have been cancelled for Wii U just to come on the Switch instead.

1046
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:45,000
It's being developed by Saber Interactive.

1047
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:52,000
And they said, not just are they getting Shaq-Fu, but they're getting another Motocross title.

1048
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:56,000
And another cooperative shooter, so who knows.

1049
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:01,000
But why can't they just let Shaq-Fu not exist?

1050
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:05,000
Well, Jamie, what if it is actually pretty good?

1051
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Sorry, I couldn't even make it through without laughing. I couldn't do it.

1052
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
Well...

1053
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
But it might, Jamie, it might.

1054
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Or it might not.

1055
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:24,000
If someone else owns it, I'll play it.

1056
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:29,000
Dartitsuyen Chat says, I could see that happening. I think that would be neat to play on Switch.

1057
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:33,000
Well, this new game is supposed to be a beat-em-up as opposed to a one-on-one fighter.

1058
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Well, that will fix everything.

1059
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,000
I'll reserve judgment for a trailer.

1060
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:40,000
I suppose that's the appropriate steps to take.

1061
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:46,000
We shouldn't judge the game until we see, you know, at least a trailer, if not the game itself.

1062
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:50,000
But it's Shaq-Fu. It's hard not to have some reservations about the game.

1063
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,000
You know what I'm saying?

1064
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,000
No reservations.

1065
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
All right. Loki, what's up next?

1066
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:58,000
So apparently there's some more information.

1067
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Nintendo Life had spoken with some indie devs about kind of what their relationship is with Nintendo right now.

1068
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Kind of in the past they've had different issues, you know, be that curation or just even assistance in getting their products onto their marketplaces.

1069
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Well, apparently now, coming from some of the independent developers, they're saying that that relationship hasn't really gotten any better and maybe even a little bit worse.

1070
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:30,000
Saying that one developer who's been described as like a top-rated eShop, had top-rated eShop releases, basically says that, you know, where in the past he had been pretty chummy with Nintendo.

1071
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,000
They had like, you know, dinner meetings and stuff like that.

1072
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Now it was like they, the way they're treating them is basically this is just a transaction.

1073
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:42,000
There's no helping them getting their product onto the store anymore.

1074
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:49,000
It was more of just like, okay, you submit us your game and we'll see, maybe we'll get it on the store for you or something.

1075
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:53,000
Just kind of some complaints that it's not really more personal.

1076
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:58,000
Also, you know, the fact that they're not really enforcing some of their policies.

1077
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:04,000
So, you know, there's some people that have been like actually shut out of the service.

1078
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:08,000
So basically they're very inconsistent about their policies.

1079
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:12,000
You know, there's games that they look at that, you know, 20% complete.

1080
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:20,000
And they're saying that, you know, they're being allowed to, you know, have permission to release on the store when they're done.

1081
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:23,000
When they have no idea what the game is going to even look like.

1082
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:29,000
Or, I don't know, it just, it seems like it's a lot harder to publish onto that platform now.

1083
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:35,000
This is weird for me to hear, though, because there's also other chatter where it sounds like Nintendo has been easier than ever.

1084
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:41,000
But it sounds like maybe if you're one of the companies in the circle or whatever, Nintendo's easier to work with than ever.

1085
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:45,000
But if you're outside of it, it might be a little harder. That's the impression I'm getting.

1086
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Well, yeah, like, you know, they were saying that, you know, for example, you know...

1087
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:50,000
Would you get all of this in the rumors and category?

1088
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:55,000
It could, it's obviously people that have had problems with it and I don't think anyone's really seen it.

1089
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Oh yeah, it's been fantastic.

1090
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,000
It's like reading a Yelp review.

1091
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:03,000
Exactly. Well, like they're saying, you know, getting a Wii U dev kit took about a week worth of work, which is basically nothing.

1092
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:07,000
While it was impossible to get our hands on a Switch, we had to go to a publisher for it.

1093
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:14,000
And the only other complaint about, was it, under communication professionalism is there, and no doubt about it.

1094
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:19,000
But hardware access was way more painful than it needed to be, especially compared to the Xbox One.

1095
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:23,000
Outside of that, everything else makes sense and it's in line with industry standards.

1096
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:32,000
So, I mean, is it really, like, were the Switch allocations that bad that they couldn't get dev kits out to people?

1097
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
That's kind of stupid if you ask me.

1098
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:39,000
It's like, well, shit, can't get the hardware to develop a game for our system.

1099
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:44,000
Because, let's be honest, it's really those indie games are fucking floating your shit right now, so...

1100
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:48,000
I mean, come on. That's kind of pathetic.

1101
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Well, if it's true, but, I mean, I think there's probably also, because of the success of the Switch, and let's not, you know, hold back, the Switch has been extraordinarily successful.

1102
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:02,000
We got the numbers from Nintendo this week. They're selling very, very well.

1103
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:07,000
You know, there's probably a ton of indie developers that all of a sudden want to get on this thing.

1104
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:10,000
And maybe it's because of some of the good words that have been out there.

1105
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:15,000
I think there's probably a lot of indie developers that are working on Wii U titles and all of a sudden it's like, oh, Wii U is pretty much gone.

1106
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Yeah, right.

1107
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
Well, shit, I better report this over this way.

1108
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Until they announce it E3, Wii U U.

1109
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:25,000
Because why not? They just released a 2DS XL. Why not do a Wii U U?

1110
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
It's like a Wii U, but without the gamepad.

1111
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
Would that be a Wii W?

1112
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:33,000
I was just going to say a Wii W. God damn it, Jamie, beat me to the joke.

1113
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Well, we are pensters.

1114
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:39,000
Yeah, what can you do? Alright, so...

1115
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:42,000
Or it could be just a Wii U, like, Wii U.

1116
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,000
Wii U 2.

1117
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Wii U.

1118
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
I like Wii W.

1119
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:52,000
Alright, anyway, let's get to another. We've had a lot of Nintendo stories.

1120
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:57,000
I want to talk about this game, which is headed, I think, for the PlayStation 4.

1121
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:00,000
And for the PC is where this game is headed.

1122
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:06,000
Yeah, PC and PlayStation 4 in May is a spiritual successor to Burnout.

1123
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
And I was wondering... What?

1124
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,000
I said yes.

1125
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:12,000
I know, because I've kind of been wondering what's happened to the Burnout series.

1126
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
We haven't had one of these games in a while.

1127
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:20,000
In Tyrian, they were working on a game. It was supposed to be some extreme sports thing that got cancelled.

1128
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:24,000
And then I think that they were working on the Need for Speed games,

1129
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:28,000
which had kind of sort of been going the Burnout route, but they're not quite Burnout.

1130
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,000
Yeah, they're not quite.

1131
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
So, that's as far as I've heard.

1132
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:35,000
Well, there's a company now out there called Three Fields Entertainment,

1133
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:38,000
and it's made up of former Burnout franchise developers.

1134
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:42,000
They're going to be releasing a vehicular destruction game called Danger Zone.

1135
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Please tell me they licensed... Was it Kenny Loggins that did that song?

1136
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,000
Yes.

1137
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
Please tell me they licensed that song to use in this...

1138
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:52,000
Because otherwise, how can you fucking do a game called Danger Zone and not actually...

1139
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
With cars crashing and not have the...

1140
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:57,000
Flying to the danger zone...

1141
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:00,000
It's got to be in the trailer. It's got to be in the trailer too.

1142
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
I don't know if I can support it if it doesn't.

1143
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:06,000
Well, anyway, this game takes place in a crash testing facility,

1144
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:12,000
and you will be surviving a variety of crash testing scenarios while trying to get bonus pickups.

1145
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:16,000
The studio in its press release said you can shunt vehicles into oncoming traffic,

1146
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
take down trailers to shed their payloads,

1147
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:22,000
and use your explosive Smash Breaker to move your vehicle around.

1148
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
The more explosions you cause, the bigger your score.

1149
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:28,000
Smash Breaker? Let's just completely rip off fucking Burnout Smash Mode.

1150
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:33,000
This sounds like they released a game on Xbox Arcade.

1151
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:38,000
Yeah, it's a party. It was Burnout Party or something like that.

1152
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,000
Yeah.

1153
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:44,000
Yeah, because that's based off of Burnout's Crash Mode that they had.

1154
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:48,000
But, I mean, they're literally ripping that off, which is...

1155
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:51,000
I guess it's okay, because it was fun, but...

1156
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:54,000
I mean, they're calling it literally the same thing.

1157
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,000
Yeah, it's just really funny.

1158
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:59,000
Anyway, this studio, they did already release a game called Dangerous Golf,

1159
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
but Danger Zone is coming out in May.

1160
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:04,000
Get this price, though. $12.99.

1161
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:07,000
Dangerous Golf is funny, too, because Dangerous Golf is basically...

1162
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:12,000
It's playing golf in a house, but it's like Burnout Crash Mode

1163
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:15,000
if you were to play golf in a house, if that makes sense.

1164
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:18,000
So, like, you're hitting a golf ball and try to break stuff in a house

1165
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:21,000
and your golf ball can explode and all sorts of ridiculous stuff

1166
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:24,000
because it's basically Burnout as a golf ball.

1167
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:27,000
The sad thing is, though, it doesn't sound like it has the actual racing parts.

1168
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
Like, that was... It sounds like that's missing.

1169
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,000
Yeah, that is unfortunate.

1170
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
Too bad. But for $12.99, okay.

1171
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
Like, because if the racing had been there, then it would probably be a security game.

1172
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
Just EA, come on, bring back fucking Burnout.

1173
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
No one gives a shit about Need for Speed anymore.

1174
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:42,000
Just give Need for Speed a year off and fucking put out Burnout Paradise 2

1175
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
or whatever the fuck you're going to put out.

1176
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Anyway, some good comments in chat regarding the whole Kenny Loggins thing.

1177
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:51,000
JD suggesting Archer should also be there.

1178
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Kenny Loggins and Archer.

1179
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:55,000
And Dark Tetsuya saying, if Rock Band can get them both,

1180
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
maybe these guys could license him for a cameo.

1181
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:00,000
Anything is possible, folks. Anything is possible.

1182
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:05,000
Anyhow, we need to get to the classic game of the week.

1183
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:10,000
That's not her music. Wrong music.

1184
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
How about that one?

1185
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,000
Sure.

1186
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
Emails are in part B. How about this one instead?

1187
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
Every week, Dar Sakura steps into the gaming vault

1188
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:22,000
and finds a game that she thinks, hey, listen, hey, listen.

1189
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
Oh, wait, no, that's her fairy garden.

1190
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:27,000
My fairy garden is Navi-free, thank you.

1191
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:30,000
She steps into the gaming vault, finds a game that she thinks, hey,

1192
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:34,000
you kids should be checking this game out this week.

1193
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Dar Sakura, what did you pick for the classic game of the week?

1194
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
I picked Burnout.

1195
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
How ironic.

1196
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,000
Mm-hmm.

1197
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
And we didn't even compare notes.

1198
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,000
No, we didn't.

1199
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:45,000
We sure didn't.

1200
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:48,000
I actually picked Burnout because Dan was watching Roadkill Garage

1201
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:51,000
and so I went to see if I had interest in metal, which I have,

1202
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:54,000
so I picked Burnout instead.

1203
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:57,000
Well, it's a good choice. It's a timely choice.

1204
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:07,000
So Burnout was released in 2001 and it came out on PlayStation 2 initially.

1205
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:12,000
It later got GameCube and Xbox versions a year later in 2002,

1206
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,000
but it still meets my criteria.

1207
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:20,000
It was noted for crashing.

1208
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
You're supposed to crash on purpose.

1209
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:25,000
So you have Championship mode, which is the main mode of the game,

1210
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:28,000
and you've got different races in that mode,

1211
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
and you compete against other cars,

1212
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:34,000
and it gets harder and harder and harder because it's a race.

1213
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
And then you have a face-off challenge after each of those

1214
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:40,000
where you can unlock a new car if you win.

1215
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
You've got sprinting. You've got all this other one.

1216
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:45,000
You have all kinds of different cars in it too

1217
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:50,000
that are generic, unbranded cars as far as I remember.

1218
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:54,000
But the big thing about this game is the crashes,

1219
01:26:54,000 --> 01:27:03,000
and it has led to pretty crazy versions of later games that have...

1220
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:06,000
Although, did it kind of move away from the whole crash thing?

1221
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:09,000
There's an E version, I think.

1222
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:10,000
No.

1223
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:11,000
No?

1224
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
That's Burnout. Of course it didn't.

1225
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:16,000
Well, no, there was another one that it's got...

1226
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:21,000
I'm thinking of the iOS version because it's all nothing but crashes.

1227
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
Yeah, I was going to say, you might be thinking of the thing we were thinking of a minute ago,

1228
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
the whole party spin-off thing that they had.

1229
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:26,000
Yeah.

1230
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:29,000
But the whole thing is that you're supposed to rack up

1231
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:34,000
as much property damage as you can with one crash.

1232
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:39,000
And the crash mechanics got more and more and more and more ridiculous.

1233
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:42,000
But there's not really much to say about it.

1234
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:46,000
It's a racing game with crashes, and exploding things is pretty damn cool.

1235
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
Well, it wasn't just about crashing, because Burnout was about

1236
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:51,000
you get nitrous, or boost, I guess.

1237
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:54,000
Your boost meter goes up by driving dangerously.

1238
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:57,000
So that could be crashing into opponent cars,

1239
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:02,000
or driving into uncommon traffic, or cutting cars off really close.

1240
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
It's basically reckless drive for the game.

1241
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:05,000
That type of stuff.

1242
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:08,000
So that was the main racing part of the game, of course.

1243
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:11,000
And then there's crash mode, which is awesome, and you can crash into things.

1244
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:14,000
I mean, how many people played this game for the races?

1245
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
I did. I played for both.

1246
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:17,000
Okay, five people.

1247
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:20,000
Racing is fun, but fire is funner.

1248
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:23,000
Well, you kind of have to play it for both the unlocked cars.

1249
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:24,000
That's true.

1250
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:27,000
I want that to be on the tombstone of Orange Lounge Radio

1251
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
when this inevitably ends someday.

1252
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:30,000
Fire is funner.

1253
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
Fire is funner.

1254
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:35,000
But the thing that people mostly know about this game

1255
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:40,000
is the explosions, crashing, and semi-trucks, and being a reckless driver.

1256
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:45,000
Like, you can race for only so long, and then you have to create an accident on purpose.

1257
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:46,000
You just have to.

1258
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:49,000
I tried to do the same thing in Mario Kart, but it's not the same.

1259
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:53,000
I remember Dan trying to play through this, and trying on purpose not to crash.

1260
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:57,000
And then he'd crash, and it would take five hours to finish the crash.

1261
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:00,000
And he'd be like, damn it, I was trying to get that car.

1262
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:03,000
Man, if Criterion can make a Mario Kart game,

1263
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:06,000
that would be awesome.

1264
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
Call it Mario Crash.

1265
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:11,000
I know this is never going to happen, and I know it was a different company.

1266
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
It was bizarre, but what about Blur?

1267
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:16,000
Like, that game got shafted really bad.

1268
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,000
It's too bad.

1269
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:18,000
It's too bad. Blur was...

1270
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
But Activision tends to do that.

1271
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:21,000
Anyway, sorry.

1272
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
I know that's not Burnout, but I have to bring it up.

1273
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
Burnout, I'm done.

1274
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
She's burnt out on Burnout.

1275
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:28,000
Yep.

1276
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:31,000
All right, there it is, your classic game of the week, a very timely choice.

1277
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:35,000
Burnout, the original from 2001,

1278
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:38,000
available on pretty much all the systems of the PS2 era.

1279
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:41,000
That would mean the GameCube and the Xbox as well.

1280
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:42,000
Check it out.

1281
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
All right, we're going to take a quick break,

1282
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:47,000
but when we come back, there is plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come.

1283
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:52,000
We'll be talking about a controversial video game from the past coming back.

1284
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
I think you all know what's coming up with this one.

1285
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
And then Dark Sakura's going to give us a little bit of a history lesson.

1286
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
We have all that and plenty more to look forward to

1287
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:03,000
when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

1288
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:14,000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

1289
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:19,000
Live tonight, episode number 684 of our show already in progress.

1290
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:22,000
If you're just joining us, you missed a fun part A.

1291
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:25,000
We had Zircon joining us to talk about Tangledeep

1292
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:28,000
as well as some of his other work with music and so forth.

1293
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
And then we had an interesting story from Alan,

1294
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:34,000
who was actually on site trying to get a classic NES,

1295
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:39,000
but alas, he was beat out by scalpers who were not shy about their scalping.

1296
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:40,000
And they suck.

1297
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:43,000
Yeah, if you missed that part of the show, you can check it out on our podcast feed.

1298
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:46,000
If you're already checking out the show on the podcast feed, hello,

1299
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
and thanks for joining us.

1300
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:51,000
As I say at the end of every show, we do appreciate a nice review,

1301
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:54,000
a five-star review on iTunes or Google Play,

1302
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
wherever it is that you found this podcast.

1303
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:59,000
Those ratings and such go an awful long way to help us spread the word

1304
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
about Orange Lounge Radio.

1305
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
Let's get back into some more gaming talk.

1306
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
We have some rapid-fire news to get to.

1307
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:06,000
Start with Loki.

1308
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:09,000
Yes, you may remember that Bayonetta was just released out on Steam,

1309
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:12,000
which is kind of a surprise, and everyone's thinking,

1310
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,000
oh, hey, cool.

1311
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:14,000
Bayonetta 2.

1312
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:21,000
Bayonetta 2, or maybe another new game will be coming out soon.

1313
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:26,000
So one of Platinum's games that people are really hoping to see next

1314
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:29,000
would be, of course, Vanquish,

1315
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:32,000
and there's maybe a little bit of a tease regarding that as well.

1316
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:36,000
Apparently there was a small update done to Bayonetta, the Steam version,

1317
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:41,000
adding a Vanquish avatar to the game's extras folder.

1318
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:42,000
Hmm.

1319
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:45,000
So that was kind of a little interesting.

1320
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
Could that be hinting that Vanquish would be the next title

1321
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
that's going to be coming to Steam?

1322
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
I guess we'll just have to wait and find out,

1323
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
because they haven't said anything.

1324
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
So, I don't know.

1325
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:58,000
And then, of course, for PlayStation Plus for May,

1326
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
we're going to be getting a handful of titles,

1327
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:05,000
including on PlayStation 4, Tales from the Borderlands and Abzu.

1328
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
Those are going to be both on PlayStation 4.

1329
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:12,000
Port Royale 3, Pirates and Merchants, and Blood Knights on PS3.

1330
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:17,000
And finally, on the Vita, Laser Disco Defenders and Typewriters.

1331
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
Those are also crossed by on PlayStation 4.

1332
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
So they'll be coming in May.

1333
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
Just to piggyback on that a little bit,

1334
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
don't forget it's the 30th today if you're listening live,

1335
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:29,000
so this is your last chance to grab some of the Xbox One stuff.

1336
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:32,000
I think Walking Dead Season 2 is one of the things today is the last chance to get.

1337
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:37,000
And then tomorrow, it's Gianna's Sister's Twisted Dreams.

1338
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:41,000
And I want to say Star Wars Force Unleashed 2?

1339
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:44,000
It's a Star Wars game of some sort, is also.

1340
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
Somebody in chat knows, but that's what's Xbox One.

1341
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:52,000
And you have until May 2nd to get a few more days for April as well.

1342
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
For PlayStation games.

1343
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:57,000
Yeah, but May 2nd is when they're going to be going up for May.

1344
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:02,000
Yeah, Microsoft's always kind of a hard stop on the 1st and the 15th and all that stuff,

1345
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:07,000
but PlayStation tends to kind of cycle out whatever Tuesday is close to the 1st of the month,

1346
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:08,000
is when they tend to do it.

1347
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
Although for E3, they might push back.

1348
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:15,000
I remember last June, the June games didn't show up until around E3 time.

1349
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:19,000
Well, speaking of E3 time, we're only like six weeks away, believe it or not.

1350
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:20,000
That's hard to believe.

1351
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
From the big public E3, which is going to be interesting.

1352
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
I should take some days off for the...

1353
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
Oh, I can't afford to at this point.

1354
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:29,000
Well, I think it's like a day off, because it's really only one day.

1355
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
It's really that first day when all the news hits, right?

1356
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
I have all the conferences.

1357
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
Or I could just watch conferences at my desk.

1358
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:38,000
Sadly, I can't do that this year.

1359
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:41,000
I'm going to have to just kind of play the catch-up game and so forth.

1360
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
I would love to do live reactions and so forth.

1361
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:46,000
Or nightly shows, kind of breaking it down or something.

1362
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
I just don't know if I'll be able to do that this year.

1363
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:55,000
But I know one of the things we're going to have to deal with is Bethesda's E3 event.

1364
01:33:55,000 --> 01:34:00,000
This is all the week before our big anniversary show, right?

1365
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:04,000
Sunday, June 11th is the E3 Bethesda conference.

1366
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:05,000
It's right in the middle of OLR.

1367
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:08,000
So I'll have to kind of work around that as we have for the past couple of years.

1368
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:11,000
Well, Bethesda has actually sent out their official invites this week.

1369
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
And they kind of did an amusement park theme with this.

1370
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:19,000
But what's interesting about this amusement park theme is that if you look at the little postcards they sent out,

1371
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:23,000
they see some things that are portrayed here in this amusement park.

1372
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:26,000
Such as there's definitely a Fallout 4 section.

1373
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:29,000
You can definitely see a Quake Champions.

1374
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:32,000
There's definitely a Doom thing back in there.

1375
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:35,000
Kind of an Elder Scrolls representative area as well.

1376
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:41,000
But there are two areas that show under construction.

1377
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:48,000
So it seems like Bethesda may unveil two new games at their show this year.

1378
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
Don't expect Elder Scrolls VI.

1379
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:56,000
Apparently it has already been commented on previously that Elder Scrolls VI is way too early in development.

1380
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
It is a long ways off. Don't expect that.

1381
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:05,000
But there is some murmurs and things out there that one of the games could be Evil Within 2.

1382
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:08,000
Yeah, I was going to say one of those, that's probably Elder Scrolls Online.

1383
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
Because I don't think they have...

1384
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:13,000
No, Elder Scrolls Online is represented in the little thing.

1385
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
That game is already out in the event.

1386
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
The top one there was Elder Scrolls Online.

1387
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:18,000
Yeah.

1388
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:19,000
They have the volcano there.

1389
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:20,000
Yeah, so no.

1390
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
I mean there could be a...

1391
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
Well, they just did the Morrowind expansion, right?

1392
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
Right, that's what that would be though.

1393
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:27,000
They have the volcano from that.

1394
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:28,000
Gotcha.

1395
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
And then of course Doom.

1396
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
And then it looks like Quake.

1397
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:35,000
I'm guessing that is...

1398
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
What the hell is that game?

1399
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:40,000
Wolfenstein is the other thought that people are thinking.

1400
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
It could be a Wolfenstein 2 is what they're going to use.

1401
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:43,000
Well, I don't know what the...

1402
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Oh, that's Prey.

1403
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:48,000
So Prey and then Dishonored is the other one.

1404
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Yeah, Prey and Dishonored are represented there too.

1405
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:51,000
And Fallout.

1406
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:55,000
So very likely that it could be Evil Within 2 and Wolfenstein 2.

1407
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:56,000
But who knows?

1408
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:57,000
Anything's possible.

1409
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:02,000
So you'll have to stay tuned for E3 to find out because maybe they have a new, new thing to do.

1410
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:08,000
One other thing I want to mention before we go over to Dark Sakura and that is the Mega Man Legacy Collection 2.

1411
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:12,000
Although nothing has been officially announced, apparently a Korean ratings board,

1412
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
which has leaked a few other games in the past,

1413
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:18,000
has leaked some information regarding the Mega Man Legacy Collection 2,

1414
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:23,000
which would include Mega Man 7, 8, 9, and 10.

1415
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:26,000
No word on any of the X series or anything else.

1416
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:32,000
It's just the 7, 8, 9, and 10 to complete off what started with 1 through 6 when that was released.

1417
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:35,000
Gosh, that was about a year and a half ago at this point that that came out.

1418
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:43,000
So this is only confirmed through the ratings board through PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

1419
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:46,000
That means we have not heard a confirmation on the 3DS yet,

1420
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:50,000
which I seem to recall the original Mega Man Collection was on the 3DS.

1421
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:56,000
And certainly nothing on the Nintendo Switch, which I don't know if you guys know,

1422
01:36:56,000 --> 01:37:00,000
but that Disney Afternoon Collection actually just came out this past week.

1423
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:04,000
That's the one that has the original DuckTales, DuckTales 2, Chip and Dale.

1424
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:09,000
You know, it has like a bunch of the Tailspin, you know, a bunch of those Disney games from the NES era.

1425
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:15,000
I passed on it, which I was surprised that I did, but I'm holding out for a Switch version.

1426
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:18,000
I truly believe Switch is the console that thing ought to be on.

1427
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:26,000
I might be waiting a while, especially if Capcom's first big release is going to be that Street Fighter 2 thing they're charging, what, 30, 40 bucks for.

1428
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
Yeah, that looks like crap.

1429
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:34,000
I'm not too excited about that, but I'm going to hope that these collections make their way to Switch at some point,

1430
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:38,000
because I really, especially with the Disney Afternoon Collection, that's where that thing belongs.

1431
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:39,000
It's a little silly.

1432
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:44,000
Is Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite coming to Switch?

1433
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
Good question. I don't think we know.

1434
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:49,000
I don't think we know. Right now, no.

1435
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:54,000
But, you know, again, Nintendo just announced these very powerful sales figures,

1436
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:57,000
so now third parties have probably got to be giving Nintendo another look.

1437
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
They might have wrote it off after the Wii U.

1438
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:02,000
I think there's going to be now people that might go back and look at Nintendo.

1439
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
We might have an interesting E3.

1440
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:07,000
We might see some things announced for Switch that we weren't expecting.

1441
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:14,000
I mean, we haven't had third parties really playing along strongly with Wii U in a while.

1442
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
Or Nintendo, really, in a while.

1443
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:21,000
I mean, 3DS, yes, here and there, but Wii U tended to be the focus of the E3 presentations.

1444
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:27,000
So I'll be very curious to see how much third parties kind of take over Nintendo's E3 with some of their announcements.

1445
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
We'll see. We'll see.

1446
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
We've got a good six weeks to go or so.

1447
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:34,000
Anyway, moving on. Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?

1448
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:35,000
Stuff.

1449
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:38,000
Guess what? There was an MMO I used to play a while back.

1450
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
And it was called Star Trek Online.

1451
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,000
Oh yeah, they're still going.

1452
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:45,000
It is still going. They're on episode 13 now.

1453
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:49,000
And it looks like this one is called Escalation.

1454
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:55,000
And they're actually doing a balance update for Space Combat.

1455
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:58,000
Ground Combat got its update last season.

1456
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:09,000
And then they're also bringing in new escort vessels and doing some touches on Star Trek Nemesis.

1457
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
So we'll see what happens with that.

1458
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:15,000
I don't know if it's enough to make me want to play again, but it's pretty interesting.

1459
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:18,000
And then last, Gundam Versus is coming out in the US.

1460
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:22,000
It's going to be out on PS4 by Bandai.

1461
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:26,000
And it is a multiplayer fighting game that's based on the Mobile Suit Gundam universe.

1462
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:32,000
So, we're getting Gundam games. That's cool. So, enjoy.

1463
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:36,000
I will. I will enjoy.

1464
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:37,000
Are you enjoy?

1465
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:44,000
Yes. Alright, let's travel around and check out some games that are coming out a little sooner, as in stores, this week.

1466
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:50,000
And what can be described as probably the weirdest spinoff of the Mass Effect series.

1467
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:53,000
The Caligula Effect is going to be coming out on Vita this week.

1468
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
A Vita game in the US?

1469
01:39:56,000 --> 01:40:00,000
In the US, I know. They happen sometimes.

1470
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:06,000
The Legend of Heroes Trails in the Sky III is coming out on PC.

1471
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:10,000
Prey is coming out on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

1472
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:11,000
Is that demo out?

1473
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
It is out, yes.

1474
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
Yeah, I heard people talking about that on the Twitters.

1475
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:23,000
And then World to the West on PC, Mac, and Linux, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Wii U.

1476
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:26,000
Wii U getting the game. That's it.

1477
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:30,000
Alright, well heading on over to Japan.

1478
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:33,000
There really isn't anything to speak of on the PlayStation 4 this week.

1479
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:37,000
Things are pretty dry over there, so nothing really for me to plug.

1480
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:40,000
And honestly, it's kind of the same story on the PlayStation Vita as well.

1481
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:43,000
The next release is on May 11th over there.

1482
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:46,000
I'm thinking it's kind of a slow week in Japan.

1483
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
Because the Switch doesn't have anything.

1484
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:51,000
But again, the physical releases are still very slow in Japan.

1485
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:54,000
And there's actually nothing on the 3DS either.

1486
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:57,000
However, I believe it's Golden Week in Japan right now.

1487
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:00,000
And that could probably explain their lack of releases.

1488
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:04,000
In fact, I just was looking up here.

1489
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
I think it's right at the end of April, right?

1490
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:09,000
Yeah, April 29th was Emperor's Birthday.

1491
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:10,000
May 5th is Children's Day.

1492
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:13,000
So we're right in the midst of Golden Week.

1493
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:16,000
So this is why there's really no releases in Japan right now.

1494
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:19,000
So you're going to have to wait a little while.

1495
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:22,000
Loki. I'm sorry. Dark Soccer. How about the UK?

1496
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:29,000
On May 4th, there's Space Plan for Android and iOS and PC.

1497
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:34,000
And then on the 5th, Prey for PC, Xbox One, PlayStation 4.

1498
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:37,000
World to the West on the major systems as well.

1499
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
And that's pretty it.

1500
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:42,000
So a little bit of a slower week in releases, except for Prey.

1501
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
That's kind of a big deal.

1502
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:47,000
I still remember Prey on the Xbox 360, the original one.

1503
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
But this new one's completely different.

1504
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
Nothing to do with the original Prey, right?

1505
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:54,000
Just two games that have the same name that happen to be first-person shooters.

1506
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
I'm curious about it.

1507
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:59,000
Let's go to the mailbag.

1508
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
I think it's time to hear from you guys.

1509
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
We have a couple weeks' worth of emails to catch up on.

1510
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
But not too many.

1511
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
You guys send us emails every week.

1512
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:15,000
DarkSoccer dives in the mailbag and finds her favorite emails to read right now.

1513
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:19,000
Now, I may be going a slight bit out of order on some of these emails.

1514
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
But I will go ahead and start.

1515
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:25,000
One of these is from Sam.

1516
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:28,000
Hello, OLR Crew. I love the show.

1517
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
Which console are you all going to buy?

1518
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:34,000
The $400 Scorpio or the feature-packed $600 Scorpio Elite.

1519
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
Thank you, Sam.

1520
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
We don't have confirmation on any of those right now.

1521
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
And I don't think we'll know until E3.

1522
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
But I do think there were some rumblings this past week about something.

1523
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:45,000
Like, a SKU had come out or something.

1524
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
Or, I don't know, some more details.

1525
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:50,000
Like, we know how many teraflops are in it and all this stuff, right?

1526
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:54,000
Well, they've already shown off the hardware too.

1527
01:42:54,000 --> 01:43:01,000
Like, was it Digital Trends? No, it was one of the Eurogamer and stuff.

1528
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
They were looking at it.

1529
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
But I remember there were some rumors out there about there being two versions of it.

1530
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
Which I don't see how they are.

1531
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
I don't think we know anything yet.

1532
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
Yeah, I mean, we really don't know until E3.

1533
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:16,000
And I'm going to be honest, when it comes to Scorpio, like, at this current time,

1534
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:19,000
and if anyone from Microsoft who makes these things happens to be listening,

1535
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
here's what's important about E3.

1536
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:24,000
If you want me to put the money down to pre-order a Scorpio,

1537
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:27,000
you really need to convince me, as an Xbox One owner,

1538
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:31,000
and as a pretty beefy computer running Windows 10 user,

1539
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
why do I need Scorpio?

1540
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:37,000
Because right now, it doesn't seem like there's a reason for me to own it.

1541
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:41,000
Like, anything I want, I could play on Xbox One,

1542
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:44,000
or I could play on my Windows 10 machine.

1543
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
Granted, there's some things that I prefer on Xbox One.

1544
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
Just hopefully you're not playing in game mode,

1545
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:52,000
because I saw a video today regarding Windows 10 game mode

1546
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
that apparently looks like it sucks.

1547
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:58,000
Really? I heard it's best used on older machines.

1548
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
You get better frame rate on older machines.

1549
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
But I haven't really, I don't need it.

1550
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
The games run fine for me.

1551
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
What I follow is Alliance Tech Tips,

1552
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:09,000
and they do a bunch of different videos regarding hardware benchmarking and stuff,

1553
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:13,000
and they test three different SKUs, kind of like low-end, mid-tier,

1554
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:17,000
and high-end PCs with three different games, including Gears of War 4.

1555
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:21,000
And with game mode on, it actually cuts some of the frame rates in half,

1556
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:24,000
like the 99% frame rate that they received.

1557
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:25,000
Interesting.

1558
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:28,000
Yeah, so there's a lot more frame rate dips, I guess, with that.

1559
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
No, I don't even worry about game mode.

1560
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
I haven't played with it, because I don't need to.

1561
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
I get great frame rates from Final Fantasy XIV.

1562
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:37,000
I get shitty frame rates with my laptop, so I'm all for that.

1563
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:42,000
But right now, I need to see what games would get me on board with it.

1564
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:48,000
I mean, like Forza Horizon 3, but Crackdown, hopefully this year, because...

1565
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:49,000
Finally.

1566
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:53,000
Finally? There's no confirmation yet that it's coming out this year yet.

1567
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
Have we heard anything about it? Nope.

1568
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:58,000
No, but we know Scalebound's not happening now, so...

1569
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
I mean, I don't know.

1570
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:03,000
Microsoft's going to be a real weird wild card at E3.

1571
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:07,000
We kind of know what to expect from Nintendo, I would say, going into E3.

1572
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:08,000
Nothing.

1573
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:12,000
No, it's not nothing, but it's the big games that are going to sell the Switch this holiday,

1574
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
including Mario Odyssey will be one of them.

1575
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:17,000
There's probably going to be a second AAA game, too.

1576
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:24,000
Can we get the pitchforks and torches out if they start, like, fucking announcing the Super Nintendo mini thing?

1577
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
Can we start a mob?

1578
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:30,000
If they do not address supply concerns, yes.

1579
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
This is Nintendo. Of course they're not going to address supply concerns.

1580
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
If they don't, then yes, we can get out the pitchforks.

1581
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:35,000
Yeah!

1582
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:41,000
But if they do, which they might, they might have a roundabout way of doing it.

1583
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
They'll use boardroom speakers.

1584
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:50,000
Somehow, we don't have unlimited resources, but we managed to get more resources.

1585
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:54,000
Exclusive pre-orders available to my Nintendo members starting today.

1586
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
Bam. Cut out scalpers immediately.

1587
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:59,000
They're made out of completely different plastic.

1588
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
Different polymers, you know.

1589
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
And much, much harder to hack.

1590
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:06,000
Anyway, Microsoft's going to be a very interesting wildcard for E3,

1591
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:09,000
whereas yes, we know what to expect. We know the Scorpio is coming,

1592
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:12,000
but what is going to substantiate the purchase of a Scorpio?

1593
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
That's what we don't know.

1594
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:19,000
So, my big roundabout answer to this very short email is

1595
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:23,000
that has to be answered until we can talk further about Scorpio.

1596
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:27,000
And that is, what's the compelling reason for me to get one?

1597
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:30,000
Because right now, beefier tech isn't doing it.

1598
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:33,000
I really feel burned by that from PlayStation 4 Pro.

1599
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
So, I'm not making that mistake again.

1600
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:38,000
Anyway, next email, DarkSakura, please.

1601
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:42,000
I will go ahead and read the next short one, which is much earlier.

1602
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:46,000
Dear Retertainment, Kylie Minogue is a flawless goddess.

1603
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:49,000
Please take those blasphemous statements of her being trashy elsewhere.

1604
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:52,000
With love, Oscar. P.S. Get out of my way.

1605
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
That's a song lyric from Kylie Minogue.

1606
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:55,000
I know.

1607
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
Well, I was hoping you'd sing it. No, I'm just kidding.

1608
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:58,000
No.

1609
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:01,000
I don't think you were here the last show, DarkSakura,

1610
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:04,000
but Retertainment unfortunately made a fleet.

1611
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
He was trying to refer to Kylie Minogue as campy,

1612
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
but I think he used the word trashy,

1613
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:11,000
and I may have read the right act live on air.

1614
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
I know he just made it.

1615
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:14,000
Kylie is a flawless goddess.

1616
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:18,000
Kylie is a flawless goddess, but I think he made an innocent mistake.

1617
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:19,000
She is campy.

1618
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
He made a mistake.

1619
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
No, wasn't she cammy?

1620
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
I mean, fuck off.

1621
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
I think we're getting to...

1622
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:31,000
Do you know the whole reason that I saw that movie was to see her as cammy?

1623
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:34,000
Oh, you know my, like, 12-year-old gay ass was like,

1624
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:35,000
Kylie Minogue!

1625
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:36,000
Right?

1626
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:37,000
No.

1627
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:38,000
She made a good cammy.

1628
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:39,000
Yeah, she was...

1629
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:40,000
And a good cammy.

1630
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:43,000
Raul Julia made that movie, really, in her.

1631
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:44,000
Sad it was his last film.

1632
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
It is really sad it was his last film.

1633
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
But you know I saw it twice in the theater.

1634
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:49,000
I always saw it once.

1635
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:50,000
Anyway, moving on.

1636
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:51,000
Okay.

1637
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:52,000
Hello, LR.

1638
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:55,000
Last week's show you mentioned the discontinuation of the Nests classic mini.

1639
01:47:55,000 --> 01:48:00,000
I absolutely agree with you guys that the fact that this discontinuation, along with a super limited supply,

1640
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:04,000
were absolute jerk moves and that Nintendo deserves whatever crap they're given for them.

1641
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:09,000
But purely from a business standpoint, I believe that Nintendo got exactly what they wanted out of the Nests classic mini.

1642
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:16,000
Now please understand that this is my personal speculation regarding the twisted, possibly deluded point of view of the Japanese corporation.

1643
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:19,000
This is widely regarded as marching to the beat of their own drum and no one else's.

1644
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:23,000
But Nintendo Switch is still four months out and no details have been released.

1645
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:29,000
The 3DS is old, nobody's talking about Wii U anymore, no significant Nintendo products are on anyone's Christmas list.

1646
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
Hi, it's May.

1647
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:39,000
This is something that will get people talking about Nintendo again, generate new interest in the brand to please the investors,

1648
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:42,000
and hopefully make folks hungrier for the Switch next year.

1649
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:46,000
Do we want to sell 20 million of these?

1650
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:47,000
Absolutely not.

1651
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:52,000
We would rather sell these games for $5 a pop as downloads on our dedicated consoles.

1652
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:55,000
But will this help us put up some holiday numbers?

1653
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
These look really good.

1654
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:02,000
So now we're hearing rumors about a possible SNES classic mini for the holiday season next year.

1655
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:05,000
Nintendo is always claiming that they're listening to customer feedback.

1656
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:08,000
What does that mean for the new mini?

1657
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:19,000
Probably that it will now say limited edition on the box to make sure we know from the outset that this is a special item made specifically for scalpers.

1658
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:26,000
No other significant changes will be made, especially in terms of quality, quantity manufactured, mark my words.

1659
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:30,000
Oh man, I hope I'm really wrong. I would love to get my hands on one of those things.

1660
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:33,000
Pretending to place a pre-order right now, Aaron Yyr.

1661
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
It's not the same market.

1662
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:41,000
The people that, like, if they're saying, oh well, you know, if you want to play your classic games, you can play it on the virtual console.

1663
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:50,000
The people that would have bought the NES mini aren't necessarily people that are even going to buy a Switch or Wii U or 3DS or whatever.

1664
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
You're selling to a completely new market.

1665
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:56,000
And they were making money off those because there's not enough in the hardware itself.

1666
01:49:56,000 --> 01:50:01,000
There was, component wise, there wasn't that much to it.

1667
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:04,000
It was just a chip running Linux.

1668
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
That's it.

1669
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:09,000
I mean, it doesn't make any sense.

1670
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:14,000
If I was an investor, I'd be furious because it's money on the table that they're throwing away.

1671
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:20,000
And yeah, the only thing that it really did for me is just enrage me as a consumer of Nintendo products.

1672
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:25,000
It's just, this is the bullshit that they claim that they've gotten all this supply chain shit fixed.

1673
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:29,000
And here's another fucking example of no, they don't know what the fuck they're doing.

1674
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:38,000
I agree with you, Loki, on the sense that as a publicly traded company in Japan, I would be furious if I was an investor if they're leaving this on the table as well.

1675
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:42,000
And especially when the reasons, I mean, do the investors know something we don't?

1676
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
Like the real reason why they're walking away from this? I don't know.

1677
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:49,000
But I can talk about this stuff and get huffy about it until I'm pink in the face.

1678
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:56,000
But the reality is Nintendo, we're at the point where Nintendo just fucking does no wrong.

1679
01:50:56,000 --> 01:51:00,000
We can sit here and go, what a bunch of fucking morons.

1680
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:03,000
But time and time again, Switch sells 2 million.

1681
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:06,000
They have all this freaking positive press out there.

1682
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
So you know what? I'm done trying to speculate.

1683
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:11,000
Because it's got Apple appeal. It's got Apple appeal.

1684
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:14,000
It doesn't matter what Apple will do, people will fucking buy the price.

1685
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
Nintendo, doesn't matter what they're going to do.

1686
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:19,000
We're beyond that at this point.

1687
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:22,000
I think we're away from those comparisons.

1688
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:30,000
Because it's to a religious fanatic state that they've got so much hope that Nintendo's going to do the right thing.

1689
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:34,000
Please show me some examples of how they're actually going to follow through this.

1690
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:37,000
Because right now this system is only a couple months old.

1691
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
We don't know what they're going to do.

1692
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:44,000
The Mario game that they're promising for fourth quarter, who knows if that's coming out in fourth quarter?

1693
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
It's a promise right now. We don't know shit.

1694
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:53,000
The thing with Apple though, they have never walked away from a product at the height of its popularity that I can recall.

1695
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:57,000
Exactly. They will sell that shit until it's just not moving off shelves.

1696
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
That's where we're beyond this now.

1697
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
Exactly. They get supply chain.

1698
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:09,000
But Nintendo, which is weird because I'm assuming that they manufacture in China because everybody fucking manufactures in China.

1699
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:17,000
How did they find the one part of China that can't fucking manufacture a tiny plastic box with a chip inside of it?

1700
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:25,000
I don't know anymore. I'm going to wait until E3 to see what fucking the circus brings to town next.

1701
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:31,000
That's all I can do at this point with Nintendo anymore. I'm going to wait until the circus comes to town for E3.

1702
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:34,000
Do you agree Dark Soccer? Are you going to wait for the circus?

1703
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:35,000
Nah.

1704
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
Alright. Is that it for our emails tonight?

1705
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:38,000
Yes.

1706
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:41,000
Alright. Then we will move on to some more news.

1707
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:46,000
But if you want to email us for a future week, participate at orangelaungeradio.com.

1708
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:52,000
We will be opening up the Skype line for your calls at Orange Lounge Radio a little later on in the show.

1709
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:55,000
But first, we do have some more news to get to. Loki.

1710
01:52:55,000 --> 01:53:00,000
Did you know it's been 25 years since Night Trap was released?

1711
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:06,000
I know that because they're releasing a Night Trap 25th anniversary edition that's going to be coming to PlayStation 4.

1712
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:11,000
Way to make me feel old, Loki, as all these fucking anniversary stories do.

1713
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:15,000
Like when Mario Brothers turned 30 and Zelda turned 30, I was like,

1714
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,000
Oh, what's that say about you, Rob Roberts?

1715
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:22,000
But, yeah, I mean, cool that Night Trap is 25, I guess.

1716
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:29,000
Now, I'm not sure if this is the same Night Trap remaster that was a Kickstarter, a really shitty Kickstarter.

1717
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:33,000
This may be a whole different thing since it's actually going to be releasing in spring.

1718
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
But it is coming. Soon.

1719
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:38,000
And that's all we know about it. We don't know anything other than it's Night Trap.

1720
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
I guess that's all you really need to know.

1721
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
For most people, that's what they need to know.

1722
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:48,000
I guess it's cool that it's getting a physical release on PlayStation 4, but I'm going to be that bitch for a minute.

1723
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
Why? Why?

1724
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
This game is not that good.

1725
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
It's not that good a game.

1726
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
You had this as the classic game of the week like a month ago.

1727
01:53:56,000 --> 01:54:00,000
We just recently were talking about Night Trap on this show.

1728
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:04,000
Excuse me. Night Trap is not that good of a game.

1729
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:09,000
You know, the thing that Night Trap did for us is that it gave us the ESRB.

1730
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:12,000
Now, granted, Mortal Kombat helped with that, too.

1731
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:17,000
But Night Trap was that game that Joe Lieberman had the copy of at the congressional hearings and so forth.

1732
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
So the game industry created the ESRB.

1733
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:24,000
Because why? Because there's women in it that are wearing tight shirts?

1734
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
Is that why you think of the children?

1735
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:32,000
Well, maybe Jamie remembers this a little better, but I seem to remember some of the depictions of the killing of the girls with the real problem.

1736
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:35,000
And by today's standards, it's really tame.

1737
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:41,000
Well, isn't that... It's funny you bring that up because I heard that this game is rated T for Teen now.

1738
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
It's not even M game anymore.

1739
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:48,000
But the version that I have is the pre-edited version.

1740
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
Oh, so maybe there's some edits in here that are making...

1741
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
There were edits.

1742
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:59,000
Because after the advent of the ESRB, there was a re-release of it that was toned down some.

1743
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:02,000
I guess Dungeon Buster in chat has a good point.

1744
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:05,000
Why does Mad Dog McCree keep getting re-releases?

1745
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
I don't know. Because it's probably a cheap license is what it is.

1746
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
Fucking somebody's buying it, I guess.

1747
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:15,000
The company Screaming Villains, who's actually developing the sequel though, or sequel remaster, I guess.

1748
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:19,000
They have their website, which doesn't really have anything on there except for the trailer.

1749
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:23,000
But it also does have a free copy of the Night Trap theme song.

1750
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:28,000
Or a remaster of the theme song if you want to play that until it comes out.

1751
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
So check it out.

1752
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:35,000
Alright, well hooray for those of you guys that are super into Night Trap.

1753
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:38,000
A question from chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

1754
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
SSJ100Matt says,

1755
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:44,000
Rob, was Sleepaway Camp good when it came out? I think it's just a cult classic.

1756
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:47,000
Let's be clear, that movie was never good.

1757
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:51,000
So yes, it's just a cult classic.

1758
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:54,000
But are you trying to compare Night Trap to Sleepaway Camp?

1759
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:57,000
I don't know if those two things can be compared.

1760
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
I would totally play a Sleepaway Camp game though.

1761
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:03,000
Again, if you've never seen Sleepaway Camp, you owe it to yourself.

1762
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:09,000
Do not fucking read about it. Do not spoil the ending to Sleepaway Camp.

1763
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:13,000
The ending is like such the cherry on top of...

1764
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:16,000
Well, and by today's standards, it's problematic.

1765
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:22,000
But remember, put your 1983 hat on and go watch Sleepaway Camp.

1766
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:25,000
It's such a silly, stupid movie, but it is.

1767
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:30,000
The ending though, it's just so ridiculous that it just made it...

1768
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
I remember watching that for the first time.

1769
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:37,000
And we were just uncontrollably laughing at the end.

1770
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,000
Just like the last scene with the music and everything.

1771
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
We were just like...

1772
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,000
It was just so ridiculous.

1773
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:45,000
It's more random than anything.

1774
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,000
It is random.

1775
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,000
It's very random.

1776
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:52,000
Anyway, JD in chat says,

1777
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
I don't have a 1983 cap.

1778
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
Well, knit one.

1779
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
Dark Soccer.

1780
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
You know what? I know Dark Soccer's twist this year

1781
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:03,000
is she does once a month the classic system of the week.

1782
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
But I'm thinking next year, for 2018,

1783
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:08,000
you might need to do the classic movie of the week,

1784
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
of the month or something.

1785
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
The first movie is Xanadu.

1786
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
Xanadu.

1787
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
Classic 80s movie.

1788
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
That was 1980 as well.

1789
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
If you were smart in the way you planned it out,

1790
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:23,000
you could still say Xanadu ties into video games

1791
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
because there's DDR,

1792
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
there's the Don Bluth animation sequences,

1793
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:31,000
which those games were a huge part of arcades in the early 80s, right?

1794
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,000
Dragon's Lair, Space Ace.

1795
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,000
So there's ways...

1796
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:38,000
And where did you play a lot of video games in the early 80s?

1797
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
At the roller rink, right?

1798
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
Mostly Frogger.

1799
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:45,000
I still can't play Frogger if I'm not wearing roller skates.

1800
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,000
True.

1801
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,000
Try playing Spy Hunter with roller skates

1802
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:51,000
because you have the acceleration pedal.

1803
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
Oh my god.

1804
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,000
But anyway, my thought is,

1805
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,000
I think we need to do like a movie

1806
01:57:57,000 --> 01:58:00,000
and you're going to tangentially relate these movies to video games somehow.

1807
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
You could do it.

1808
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
I guess.

1809
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
This movie came out in 1983,

1810
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
which is also the year that Blink came out.

1811
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
There. Tie-in.

1812
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
And Kevin Bacon. The end.

1813
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:15,000
I just committed all of us to a 16th year of Orange Lounge Radio.

1814
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:18,000
Look at that. Check that out in 2018.

1815
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
Girl, you can do the segment.

1816
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
Alright.

1817
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
Is that a challenge? Alright.

1818
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
Maybe a... Bitch, it might be.

1819
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
Well, okay, wait.

1820
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
Not to get too tangential, but we're running a little

1821
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
early tonight, so I can do a few tangent.

1822
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
Tangent us? Never.

1823
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
What if, and what would the listeners think about this,

1824
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
what if it was like a

1825
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
YouTube spin-off

1826
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
of OLR to do like a classic

1827
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
movie of the... Do I gotta...

1828
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
Yes.

1829
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
YouTube's where it's at now.

1830
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
Okay, but

1831
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
we have to have like snarky videos and bad animation.

1832
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
We can, we can probably have all of that.

1833
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
Okay. We could do a classic movie of the...

1834
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
I could actually just finally sit down and learn iMovie.

1835
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
There you go. Now we're talking.

1836
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
Okay, there you go.

1837
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
See, some of the folks in chat are

1838
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
SHO 100 Matt says yes, Dr. C says sure.

1839
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
JD says, actually Rob

1840
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
talking about movies would be a super interesting segment

1841
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
since he knows his cult movies. Well, thank you.

1842
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
Yeah, I know a thing or two about cult movies.

1843
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
Maybe that should just be our thing.

1844
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
Like, this is what we remember about these shitty

1845
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
movies.

1846
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
Do I want to talk about this on air?

1847
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
Dot, dot, dot. Okay. Do it.

1848
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
Do it. So,

1849
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
y'all know I am involved with Rocky Horror Picture

1850
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
Show here in Sacramento, right? No.

1851
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
You guys know about that. And

1852
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
the guy who puts it on has a whole

1853
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
organization of events that he does, and one of the

1854
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
things that he does is a thing called Sinister Creature Con.

1855
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
So, last year,

1856
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
or no, two years ago, excuse me, at Sinister Creature Con,

1857
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
he let me moderate the panel.

1858
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
It's one of the highlights of my life, really, that had

1859
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
Patricia Quinn, Nell Campbell, and

1860
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
Barry Bostwick, who played Magenta, Columbia, and Brad

1861
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
in the movie. I got to do that panel, so it was really cool.

1862
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
Like, me and these, like, three legit

1863
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
movie stars, like, on the panel. It was awesome.

1864
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
And she was Magenta on stage.

1865
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
She was, and she was Columbia on stage.

1866
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
So,

1867
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
guess who one of his

1868
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
big lands is

1869
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
for this October's

1870
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
Sinister Creature Con in Sacramento. Tim Curry.

1871
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
No, God, I wish. It has nothing to do

1872
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
with Rocky Horror, but everything to do with cult movies.

1873
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
And video games, there's a reason I'm bringing this

1874
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
up on OLR. What's his face from The Last

1875
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
Starfighter? No.

1876
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
Uwe Boll is going to be there.

1877
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
Oh my God.

1878
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
So, I'm thinking

1879
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
about, do I need to phone in a favor and

1880
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
ask to do that panel?

1881
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
Like, do I want to do that

1882
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
panel? Do I not want to do that panel? He's out of the movie

1883
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
industry now for you. He is. He's doing

1884
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
something else now.

1885
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
He is. Is it like a restaurant?

1886
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
I think he's doing something.

1887
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
How many explosions are in his restaurant?

1888
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
The reason why I bring that up is that if we do

1889
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
this whole YouTube thing,

1890
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
maybe, maybe we could get some

1891
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
interviews and talk to some of these cult people.

1892
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
So, that could be a something,

1893
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
something thing that comes up anyway.

1894
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
S.G.O. 100 Matt says, bring on a

1895
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
special guest like Travis. If I can get him out of the

1896
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
retirement home, sure, I'd love to have him on.

1897
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
Let's see,

1898
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
William Renovay says, there should be a whole episode

1899
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
of Rocky Horror. I could probably fill a

1900
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
whole episode of Rocky Horror. So,

1901
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
there you go. We'll see.

1902
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
Anyway, I probably should have blurted that out on air

1903
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
because that's still all under development, but it is

1904
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
something I'm trying to,

1905
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
I'm trying to

1906
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
be a part of later this year.

1907
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
Because I think it would be fun

1908
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
if nothing else. Right, Loki?

1909
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
It would be fun. I've already interviewed

1910
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
Uwe Boll once. For what?

1911
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
It was for Tunnel Rats. It was a

1912
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
movie that he's, it was

1913
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
kind of the reverse. He was making a movie that they're

1914
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
going to be making a game off of. So, we did a phone interview

1915
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
with him at my previous job.

1916
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
He's alright. I don't know.

1917
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
We didn't learn too much from, I mean,

1918
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
Despite his reputation,

1919
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
I bet he's actually a pretty normal person.

1920
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
He's just a person.

1921
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
I mean, whatever. He exploited,

1922
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
he exploited German tax laws to make

1923
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
movies and make money. Just like Adam Sandler

1924
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
exploits whatever

1925
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
to, you know, make movies with his

1926
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
friends so his friends get a constant

1927
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
check and he can go vacation with them.

1928
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
Didn't they say those movies are like the most

1929
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
watched thing on Netflix right now? Yeah, they make a ton of money

1930
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
and they, like, stealthily get onto Netflix

1931
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
and it's funny, but... Who's fucking

1932
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
watching it? Knock it off. Ford people.

1933
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
They're, you know what, I mean,

1934
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
honestly, though, like... More power to them, I guess.

1935
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
It's seriously, like, look at this guy.

1936
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
I mean, he's supported his friends,

1937
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
like, his best friends. I mean, if, if I

1938
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
could get paid, in fact, we had talked

1939
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
about this, like, a long time ago, like, with,

1940
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
you know, Eric and stuff, like, if we

1941
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
get paid, lots of money to make really

1942
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
shitty movies and just dumb movies that we

1943
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
find funny

1944
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
and just do that with our friends and get to go vacation

1945
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
places and buy cars for ourselves,

1946
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
fuck yeah, why wouldn't

1947
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
I do that? I would totally do that. So,

1948
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
Loki, I don't know if you've heard, but there's a website

1949
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
out there called YouTube

1950
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
and you can make

1951
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
dumb shit and put it on YouTube and

1952
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
you put these ads in front of it

1953
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
and you make money. Yeah, but I haven't heard

1954
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
that they have, they don't put ads in front of

1955
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
controversial stuff now.

1956
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
Remember, YouTube's become quite, quite

1957
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
the shit right now. That's, like, legit,

1958
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
like, fucking hate speech stuff. I don't

1959
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
think your movies would... No, it's everything

1960
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
because, you know, YouTube is

1961
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
run by a high, trained professional

1962
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
team of computer

1963
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
animated bots that don't actually, you know,

1964
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
have any sort of soul, they just basically go

1965
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
out there and go, yeah, I think this is this, but

1966
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
we're, we're gonna, hopefully that's correct.

1967
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
The LGBT community had a huge problem

1968
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
with the whole, like, a bunch of LGBT,

1969
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
like, coming out videos or being labeled restricted

1970
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
as adult content and it, like,

1971
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
they're actually not, it's not, they're

1972
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
not talking about anything adult. They're

1973
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
talking about experiences that

1974
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
sometimes help other people and so forth.

1975
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
Advertisers, they don't like that.

1976
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
Anyway, alright.

1977
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
Alright, we've gone down too many tangents.

1978
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
It's time to pull the train back into the

1979
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
station and talk about, hey, something else

1980
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
that you might be streaming on YouTube or

1981
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
on Twitch or one of those. Persona 5,

1982
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
remember, there was some, there were some

1983
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
pretty strict guidelines that came out for Persona 5.

1984
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
Well, shock and... Unenforceable guidelines.

1985
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
Shock and awe. Atlas

1986
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
has revised those guidelines.

1987
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
That's right. The guidelines

1988
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
have been, let's see,

1989
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
changed a little bit. The new

1990
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
guideline is that you can do video up to

1991
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
the in-game date of

1992
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
11-19. That's

1993
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
before the game gears up for the final act.

1994
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
Now, they also,

1995
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
as a part of this, I'm gonna read this verbatim here,

1996
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
we also want to apologize to those of you

1997
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
who saw the previous guidelines blog post

1998
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
as threatening. We wanted to be transparent

1999
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
about what we do, and the reason we

2000
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
released the guidelines was to give streamers the

2001
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
right information up front. It was never

2002
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
our intention to threaten people with copyright

2003
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
strikes, but we clearly chose the wrong

2004
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
tone for how to communicate this.

2005
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
Because you said you threatened them with a copyright

2006
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
strike. Yeah. Because you literally

2007
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
did that. It wasn't the tone, it was

2008
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
you literally came out and said, if you do this,

2009
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
we're gonna strike your channel. Now, the

2010
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
interesting thing is, they haven't said they're not

2011
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
gonna do that, but at the same time, have we

2012
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
heard of anybody actually getting copyright strikes

2013
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
from this? Because, I have a friend

2014
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
who put his entire playthrough of the game

2015
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
on YouTube in like 53 segments or something

2016
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
like that, haven't heard if there's been any

2017
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
problems yet. I mean, granted, he's not a

2018
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
huge streamer, so,

2019
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
but still. I get it, you don't want your

2020
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
game story ruined, but

2021
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
you have no control over that.

2022
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
You don't. You can't.

2023
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
You can't say it's okay to put part of the

2024
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
game on there. I don't think it's even

2025
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
enforceable the way you can do that. Especially

2026
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
if they're commenting over it and there's like actual

2027
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
transformative work being done

2028
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
to it, you can't do it.

2029
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
I do think, I

2030
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
realize this is a complicated issue, it's not

2031
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
easily gonna be solved. I do think

2032
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
there should be revenue sharing

2033
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
available. I do think that

2034
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
Atlus should be able to share

2035
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
in what, especially,

2036
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
especially when there is no

2037
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
commentary or nothing else going on, Atlus

2038
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
does deserve it. When there's

2039
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
commentary and stuff, I do believe

2040
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
Atlus, as they've made the game, they should

2041
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
be entitled to some of the revenue,

2042
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
but I don't think they should get to dictate

2043
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
oh, you do this, but not that.

2044
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
They already get some of the revenue when I purchase

2045
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
their fucking game. No, seriously,

2046
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
they're not entitled to any of that, and you know

2047
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
why? Because Nintendo does this shit.

2048
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
Nintendo

2049
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
monetizes every single

2050
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
video out there, unless

2051
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
you just, you know,

2052
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
join up in their

2053
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
special club where they get most of the

2054
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
profits anyways. That's still a thing?

2055
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
That's still a thing. Oh, I didn't know. So, I mean,

2056
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
I'm sorry, we've already seen how back ass

2057
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
words that shit is. I do not want more companies

2058
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
jumping on board with that.

2059
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
Alright, we need to get on to some more stories. We

2060
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
will be taking your calls at Orange Lounge

2061
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
Radio on Skype in a little while, but first,

2062
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
Dark Sakura,

2063
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
with something a little different. Yes.

2064
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
Well, um, this

2065
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
has been, uh, you know,

2066
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
Call of Duty isn't necessarily, like, my

2067
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
favorite ever game,

2068
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
but they're doing a World War

2069
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
2 campaign that,

2070
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
um, has a multiplayer mode that lets you

2071
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
play as, uh, female combatants.

2072
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
And, um,

2073
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
it's funny, because

2074
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
I've seen some people

2075
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
get kind of fussy about it, like, they'll

2076
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
like, we were actually commenting on

2077
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
before the show, there'll be people who

2078
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
are cool with having, you know,

2079
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
Nazi zombies, but

2080
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
get all fussy about women

2081
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
in combat. But even

2082
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
back then, I mean, now the

2083
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
US was definitely a lot more stuffy about

2084
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
it, but, um, there were

2085
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
women combatants in World War

2086
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
2. There were, uh,

2087
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
in fact, a very famous, uh, group

2088
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
of, uh, Russian snipers,

2089
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
um, who,

2090
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
uh, were, uh,

2091
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
actually had some of the highest

2092
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
kill counts of any of, uh,

2093
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
of the combatants. There, uh,

2094
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
were also, uh, people in the

2095
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
Air Force. There are plenty of

2096
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
American women were, uh, also involved

2097
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
in, uh,

2098
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
uh, aircraft, in, um,

2099
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
transport. A good number

2100
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
of Canadian, too. We had,

2101
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
um, medical, uh, sorry, transport vehicle

2102
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
drivers, um, and not

2103
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
just in, you know,

2104
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
working in, like, you know,

2105
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
canteens or as a cook

2106
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
or as a, you know, clerk, but,

2107
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
uh, women who,

2108
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
uh, were

2109
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
very, very important to the whole,

2110
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
uh, war effort

2111
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
in World War 2, just all over the world.

2112
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
So, um,

2113
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
I think it's not too far-fetched

2114
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
to have, um,

2115
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
female

2116
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
combatants in a World War

2117
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
2 era game, so.

2118
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
Why not? Sure. I mean, I think this is,

2119
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
you know, as much as we've made

2120
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
a lot of strides in the past ten years

2121
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
to try to bring more

2122
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
representation in games,

2123
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
I mean, Call of Duty definitely

2124
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
has that label as a brotastic

2125
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
type of video game,

2126
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
so I think that's really cool that

2127
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
they're bringing in, you know, a way

2128
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
for more women to get into Call of Duty by

2129
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
playing something that can represent themselves a little more.

2130
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,000
Did you know that even Queen Elizabeth II

2131
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
was, um, uh, enlisted

2132
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
in 1945? That doesn't surprise

2133
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
me, considering her family is kinda

2134
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
always, like, I know, like, William and

2135
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,000
and Harry were in the military

2136
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
and all that, so, you know, that family kinda has a

2137
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
military history to them, so. And see,

2138
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
what I would like to see is if

2139
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
they were gonna do, like, a World War 2 era

2140
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
game, I would wanna do something

2141
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
where someone fights as, like, a resistance member.

2142
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
You would be very proud of our chatters

2143
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
right now, by the way, because, like, they are saying things

2144
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
like, Justice, you're about to say them, Lady JJ

2145
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
just pointed out the Queen Elizabeth II thing,

2146
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
uh, S.G.O. and Hunter Matt

2147
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,000
talked about the Russian snipers thing,

2148
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
and so it's, it's funny that, like, they're

2149
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
naming stuff right, you'd be very proud of her. Hey, Lady

2150
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
JJ, I'm glad you can make it in.

2151
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
You'd be very proud of our listeners tonight.

2152
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
But, um, I mean,

2153
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
and even, there were, uh,

2154
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
of course, I learned a lot more, you know,

2155
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
studying, uh, the effects of

2156
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
the Holocaust, there was, um,

2157
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
a Jewish resistance leader named Hannah

2158
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
Senesch, who, um,

2159
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
uh, she

2160
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
airdropped several times into Germany

2161
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
to spread, uh, propaganda

2162
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
and to help the resistance

2163
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
and ended up being tortured and murdered

2164
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
by the Nazis. You know, plenty

2165
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
of, of women who, you know,

2166
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
I know there's a lot of women involved, it's about

2167
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
planes, like, usually, like, the flights and the planes

2168
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
stuff, like, a lot of women got involved in that.

2169
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
Or even, um, performers, there were plenty

2170
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
of performers who would, you know, pass

2171
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
notes and, and get information

2172
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
from people, but the whole

2173
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
thing is, is that, don't just

2174
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
look at a historical war

2175
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
through a patriarchal lens.

2176
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
I mean, and I'm not meaning to use,

2177
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,000
like, buzz feminist words, you know,

2178
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
whatever. It's truly

2179
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
clouded by

2180
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
a lot of male-centric discussion.

2181
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
Don't discount that women played their part

2182
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
in war, or that we still

2183
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
play a part in war. What is it, like, six years ago,

2184
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
um, the Air Force passed, uh,

2185
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
uh, their first female sniper

2186
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
through their Sniper Academy.

2187
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
Um, it's

2188
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
just, don't discount it, you know.

2189
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
If you say, oh, well, so

2190
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,000
and so was never in the war, there were

2191
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
women who fought in

2192
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
the American Civil War, on both sides,

2193
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
who would,

2194
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
in some cases, quite literally, cross-dressed

2195
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
to be in the army, or be in

2196
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
whichever militia. It's been going

2197
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
on for years. There's even, like, French

2198
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
nobles who, um,

2199
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
were absolutely famous

2200
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
for, uh, women who

2201
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
adopted men's dress. Well, and Mulan.

2202
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
I couldn't, I'm sorry, I couldn't help it.

2203
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
I'm sorry. Well, even, even

2204
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
Joan of Arc. Yeah, sure, of course. She

2205
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
was burned, not just for, you know,

2206
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
being, uh, in resistance

2207
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
to, uh, England's armies, but

2208
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
she was actually more burned

2209
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
as a heretic for refusing to wear women's clothing.

2210
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
Because she was female.

2211
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
So, I'm just saying,

2212
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
if you have an argument about

2213
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
a game because of some preconceived notion,

2214
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
actually take some time and study the fucking history.

2215
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
The end.

2216
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
Okay. This week on

2217
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
Jamie Takes On Video Games.

2218
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,000
I'm a, I'm a big history

2219
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
nerd, too. I do not disagree

2220
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
with what you're saying, and I think it's really cool that

2221
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
the video games are, like, reflecting, you know,

2222
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
the more diversities of, of, of

2223
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
how World War II affected

2224
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
everybody. You know what I mean?

2225
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
Exactly. I mean, it was a world

2226
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
war for a reason. And, you know,

2227
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
history is kind of repeating itself, so

2228
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
keep your eyes open.

2229
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
Alright.

2230
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
Uh, let's move on. Uh, just a few more

2231
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
stories for you guys, and then the Skype line. But first,

2232
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
If I may say. Oh, yeah. SSG100 Matt

2233
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
said, thankfully, our listener group doesn't think that way.

2234
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
And, yes, bless you all.

2235
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
I love you all.

2236
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
Doesn't think in the terms of.

2237
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
There might be somebody new to the show who might

2238
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
be like, oh, I didn't think about it that way before.

2239
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
Well, then, good. I hope to open

2240
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
some eyes. Exactly. That's all, that's

2241
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
all it is. Just think, think a little different.

2242
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
Bend over and take it.

2243
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
I'm kidding. Jamie.

2244
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
Oh, come on. You know it's me. Alright.

2245
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
Moving on. A few more stories for you guys.

2246
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
Loki. So, um,

2247
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
not too long ago, um,

2248
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
GTA V, you know,

2249
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
this whole, um, stunt

2250
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
racing and stuff

2251
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,000
that they kind of added to the game that

2252
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
really, I thought, made the racing really

2253
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
better, you know, with all these loops and

2254
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
ramps and crazy shit.

2255
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
So, it's only appropriate that Forza

2256
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
Horizon 3 has Hot Wheel DLC

2257
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
coming with all the fucking loops and

2258
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
shit they would find in the orange

2259
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
track to bear. And it looks

2260
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
fantastic. I mean, it

2261
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
just looks seriously

2262
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
cool from the trailer that I saw.

2263
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
You like this kind of over-the-top

2264
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
shit though. I know, I'm all

2265
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
on board for this too. Yeah, it looks great.

2266
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
I mean, the game, I mean, itself was

2267
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
pretty good, but now it's... You know what it

2268
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
reminds me of? Hard Drivin'.

2269
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,000
You remember that game? Yeah, right.

2270
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
I used to take a nap in that.

2271
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
It was a giant cabinet, right?

2272
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
And it was like the, the early

2273
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,000
days of, and I'm using my quotey fingers,

2274
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,000
virtual reality type games. Yeah, like

2275
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
was it Test Drive 3?

2276
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
Polygons, yeah. But like,

2277
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,000
Hard Drivin' was like that first game where you had like

2278
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
the ramp and you had like a loop

2279
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
and all this crazy shit. And now

2280
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
it's like, oh, that, it's like

2281
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
making that on hardware

2282
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
in 2017. Pretty cool.

2283
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
It looks cool though. Seriously, it's gonna be 20 bucks.

2284
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
The expansion by itself

2285
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
is $20. Or if you bought the

2286
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
games expansion pass, which

2287
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
is $35, you get that for free as

2288
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
well. It's coming out May

2289
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
9th on

2290
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
Xbox One. I'm assuming PC since

2291
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
it's a Windows 10 game. Yes.

2292
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
But yeah, definitely check that out.

2293
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
It looks really cool.

2294
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
Alright, well one more story

2295
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
for you guys before we open up the Skype line and

2296
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
that has to do with, hey

2297
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
guess what? Sometimes people

2298
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
online who, you know, when they do, we

2299
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
hear about these websites getting

2300
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
hit with DDoS attacks and stuff,

2301
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
we're wondering, when are some of these people gonna

2302
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
go to jail for breaking the

2303
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
law? And guess what?

2304
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
Somebody's finally going to jail for

2305
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
some of this shit. So it

2306
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
was the Central Criminal Court of England

2307
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
in Wales who found

2308
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
20 year old Adam Mudd

2309
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
guilty of creating a

2310
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
malware program that did

2311
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
distributed denial of service or DDoS

2312
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
attacks on computer network.

2313
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
Apparently it has caused 1.7

2314
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
million cyber attacks since

2315
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
2013. The malware

2316
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
was sold under a pseudonym and

2317
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
apparently made $400,000 from

2318
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
112,000 registered

2319
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
users. Let's see, apparently

2320
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
there's gaming companies that have been

2321
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
attacked like Xbox Live,

2322
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
Minecraft, and the MMORPG

2323
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
RuneScape. The

2324
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
DDoS would overload the company's networks

2325
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
with too much data and that would interrupt the

2326
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
connection to the internet and then they're

2327
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
unable to process the user request. And I think we

2328
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
all remember when Xbox Live and I think PlayStation

2329
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
Network got shut, I'm not saying that

2330
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
that is the same program that shut these

2331
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
things down, but we all

2332
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
remember when that happened on, like on

2333
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
Christmas, right? Didn't PlayStation Network go down

2334
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
on Christmas? It was really fucking rude,

2335
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
whatever it was they did. So, there we go.

2336
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
The judge

2337
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
wanted to make this sentence a

2338
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
strong deterrent to future

2339
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
cyber criminals and sentence Mudd

2340
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
to two years of jail and that will

2341
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
be served in a young offenders institution

2342
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
because I guess 20 is still a young offender

2343
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
over there. Whereas

2344
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
here, that would, you'd be

2345
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
in, you'd be in, you'd be in

2346
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,000
regular, you'd be in prison

2347
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,000
Orange is the new black style.

2348
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,000
No juvie hall over 18

2349
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
so, but I guess it's a little

2350
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,000
different over there, so.

2351
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
There you go, somebody finally going to jail for DDoSing

2352
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
so, there you go.

2353
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
Alright, wasn't that a prediction

2354
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,000
on a, not this year, probably last year,

2355
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
but I think I said one of them would get the death penalty.

2356
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,000
I think that was 2016. I think that's a bit much.

2357
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
Just chop off their fingers.

2358
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
I still could have gotten a half point.

2359
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
Alright, hey

2360
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
guess what guys, Skype line is open.

2361
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype

2362
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
and if you want to do it the old fashioned way, 1-877-GAME-OLR

2363
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
and guess what, our phone

2364
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
is ringing, but we will catch up with

2365
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
Loki on some last minute stories in a moment.

2366
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
But first, hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

2367
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
Hey, what's going on, it's Ranma.

2368
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,000
Hey Ranma, how you doing?

2369
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
Pretty good, I just got in from another convention

2370
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
about a good hour and a half ago.

2371
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
I know, I saw the picture, you were hanging out

2372
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
with your posse from Anime Jam

2373
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
Session and I saw John from Critical Myth in those pictures

2374
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,000
so, you guys had a good

2375
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,000
good old time, hello hello, and I hope you had fun.

2376
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
It was so much fun

2377
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
that I would say this, next

2378
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,000
year, y'all gotta come out for this

2379
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
convention, that's how much fun, how much

2380
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
how great it is. Which con is it?

2381
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
Zenkai Con, it's right in Lancaster

2382
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
County. I've heard of that before.

2383
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
But you know,

2384
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
realistically, I don't know if it

2385
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
would be in the budget for me to do another East Coast

2386
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
con, I'd have to choose between that

2387
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
and Magfest and, well,

2388
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,000
hate to break it to you buddy, but, you know

2389
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,000
Magfest's gonna win that one. You're coming with me to

2390
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
DragCon next year anyway.

2391
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
That's true.

2392
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
It sucks, when I switched jobs

2393
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
I lost 10 days of work

2394
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
off a year, I went from 25 days off to

2395
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
15, so it's like I really have to pick and choose my

2396
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
cons now.

2397
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
Well, we could always do this.

2398
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
You could always do Magfest, you could

2399
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
crash at Michael John's place until

2400
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
the con, you just work remotely.

2401
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
If I wasn't a corporate

2402
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000
trainer who needed to be in a classroom all day

2403
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
I would consider that.

2404
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
Video technology my friend!

2405
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what, when I'm a

2406
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
famous YouTuber,

2407
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
I'll go to all the cons.

2408
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
When I can quit my job and be a famous YouTuber.

2409
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
Sounds like a plan.

2410
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
Sounds like a plan my friend.

2411
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
Well no, I'm really glad you had a good time at the con though.

2412
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
Was there any type of gaming stuff at the con, or was it mostly

2413
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
anime?

2414
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
It was a mix of everything, and what I'm starting to

2415
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
see now, Bemani is

2416
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
coming back.

2417
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
I don't know if you were here at the beginning of the show,

2418
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
but somebody made a comment at the beginning of the show,

2419
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
and I kind of mentioned that I kind of felt

2420
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
DDR was going through a renaissance,

2421
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
but I really should have clarified that saying

2422
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
Bemani is going through a renaissance, because

2423
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
definitely things like Ubeat

2424
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,000
is like at conventions, there's always a

2425
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
fucking line to play Ubeat, whether it's

2426
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
Dragon Con or Magfest or wherever I'm at

2427
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
that has those machines, and then

2428
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
SoundVoltex is doing very well it seems as well,

2429
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
so it really isn't

2430
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,000
just DDR, but that's just kind of

2431
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
the grandpa of those games.

2432
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
True, true, true.

2433
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
So, but those games

2434
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
having a great presence at Zenkai Con

2435
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
it sounds like?

2436
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,000
A small presence because the gaming room

2437
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000
wasn't that big, but what I'm seeing in general

2438
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
over the last year and a half,

2439
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
big or small,

2440
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
the dance rhythm games are coming back pretty strong.

2441
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,000
Oh, that's great.

2442
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
I know

2443
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
speaking of all the dance game stuff,

2444
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,000
you guys probably know Kyle Ward

2445
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,000
who was on this show, oh god

2446
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:22,000
it was probably a couple years ago at this point, but

2447
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,000
you know, at the time we were talking about some of the

2448
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:26,000
stuff he's been doing with the cell phone games, well now

2449
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:28,000
I'm seeing a lot of activity now with his

2450
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:30,000
what did they end up calling the machine?

2451
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,000
It's like Step Maniacs, right?

2452
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,000
That's the name of it. It's like Step Mania

2453
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
but with an X. So, like, and it seems

2454
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,000
like this is, you know, a lot of people are

2455
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,000
really, really anticipating this game,

2456
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:42,000
this Step Maniacs game, and

2457
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,000
you know, I remember playing it at Magfest

2458
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,000
and it really looks like it's coming together, and I love the idea

2459
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,000
of the main screen being a touch screen.

2460
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,000
And then there's not just that,

2461
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,000
but fucking, did you, I didn't even know this was out

2462
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,000
on iPhones now,

2463
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,000
but Neon FM

2464
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
is fucking out on hand-helds

2465
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
and it syncs up with

2466
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,000
the arcade versions.

2467
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,000
I didn't know that was a thing now.

2468
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
I remember talking about

2469
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:08,000
Neon FM fucking like 2005,

2470
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000
like in the early days of OLR.

2471
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:12,000
This is crazy.

2472
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,000
But in a good way.

2473
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,000
Sure enough.

2474
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,000
Rob, you want to know something?

2475
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:20,000
That's not why I called in.

2476
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,000
Oh, that's alright. Well, why did you call in?

2477
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
I wanted to talk to you about

2478
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
your thoughts. I heard what you

2479
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,000
had to say about Project Scorpio,

2480
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,000
and you know what? I hear what

2481
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,000
you're saying. I get it.

2482
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,000
It's like

2483
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
when you have a basic PC to do

2484
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
stuff, and then

2485
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,000
you got the basic PC to do stuff, play games,

2486
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:42,000
do all this stuff, and you're happy. You got

2487
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:44,000
the Uber PC that does everything

2488
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
and much, much more.

2489
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
The PS4 Pro, Project Scorpio,

2490
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
I don't want to

2491
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:52,000
use the word lazy,

2492
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,000
but I'm going to use the word lazy.

2493
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,000
It's a lazy way

2494
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
of getting a high-end

2495
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:00,000
gaming PC

2496
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:02,000
or gaming console.

2497
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:04,000
It's like

2498
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,000
I just think these two

2499
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,000
consoles are a way to fight back at the

2500
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:10,000
quote-unquote master race of PC

2501
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
gaming.

2502
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:14,000
I sort of get that.

2503
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,000
I think it's for people who

2504
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:18,000
don't necessarily have an Uber-end PC,

2505
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,000
but again, I'm not

2506
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,000
saying that like, oh, I'm not getting

2507
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,000
one, and my mind's made up. I'm

2508
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,000
waiting to hear that out of E3, but

2509
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:28,000
that's really what I'm saying is that

2510
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,000
Microsoft needs to convince me at

2511
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:32,000
E3, or if not me, if

2512
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
what you're saying is really the

2513
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,000
case where it's like, no, this system is not for me. It's for

2514
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,000
these other people. Okay, then really, what is that

2515
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:40,000
compelling case why people

2516
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:42,000
need to spend the extra money on this

2517
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:44,000
system?

2518
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:46,000
What are the games going to be like?

2519
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:48,000
What's Scorpio going to lend itself to with that?

2520
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:50,000
What are those experiences going to be

2521
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:52,000
that makes it a little worth it?

2522
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:54,000
Because in some regards, I think Sony

2523
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:56,000
has kind of peed in the pool

2524
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:58,000
a little bit, because I don't

2525
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:00,000
think the PlayStation 4 Pro

2526
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,000
has really pushed things

2527
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:04,000
forward immensely

2528
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,000
in that regard, and now that's kind of what's

2529
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,000
stuck in our heads, and I realize

2530
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:10,000
Microsoft had nothing to do with that,

2531
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,000
but I can't help but feel like

2532
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,000
PlayStation has kind of

2533
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,000
already kind of screwed it

2534
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:18,000
up, if that makes sense?

2535
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:20,000
It does. I kind of see it this way.

2536
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:22,000
I mean, look at the specs between both consoles.

2537
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:24,000
I mean, I kind of feel

2538
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,000
that Sony is kind of banking

2539
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:28,000
on the name PlayStation

2540
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:30,000
to push the Pro, whereas

2541
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:32,000
not everybody knows the Microsoft

2542
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:34,000
brand per se. They know it, but it's like

2543
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:36,000
gaming, nine times out of ten, especially

2544
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,000
in the circles I roll with, more people

2545
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
are more apt to go towards the PS4

2546
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:42,000
because of the games, even though

2547
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,000
the Xbox has the hardware

2548
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:46,000
processing power. Now,

2549
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
with Scorpio comes out, if the

2550
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
price is right, and they can get

2551
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:52,000
these companies behind

2552
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,000
them with all these amazing games,

2553
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:56,000
then we're going to be good. Now,

2554
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,000
if they start doing exclusive

2555
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:00,000
PS4 Pro and Scorpio

2556
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:02,000
games, that's where we're going to

2557
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:04,000
have a problem. But they need

2558
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:06,000
to keep it at, keep the game

2559
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
optimized for PS4

2560
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:10,000
so that way you can play it on either

2561
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,000
or. You can see the power

2562
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,000
and graphical difference between both of those consoles

2563
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:16,000
as if they're the Xbox One.

2564
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:18,000
And I will say this now, and I'm not

2565
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:20,000
saying this as an Xbox

2566
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:22,000
fanboy, but you

2567
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:24,000
get that one game

2568
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,000
for both

2569
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:28,000
consoles. And you

2570
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:30,000
optimize it for their Pro systems.

2571
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:32,000
I hate to break it to you, but it's

2572
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,000
going on Scorpio, it's going to

2573
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,000
blow it out of the water compared to the PS4

2574
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,000
only because of the hardware that's

2575
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,000
underneath it. Well, I have to ask this

2576
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:42,000
because you made me think about something I've been

2577
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:44,000
reading a lot about today. And again,

2578
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:46,000
it's in the rumor camp very

2579
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:48,000
firmly, but there's rumors

2580
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,000
out there that PlayStation 5

2581
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,000
is going to be 2018,

2582
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,000
which seems

2583
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:56,000
really early, but then

2584
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:58,000
the way this kind of broke it down

2585
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:00,000
is that there were six years

2586
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:02,000
between PS1 and 2, six years

2587
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:04,000
between 2 and 3, seven years

2588
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:06,000
between 3 and 4,

2589
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:08,000
but three needed time to

2590
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:10,000
kind of catch on,

2591
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:12,000
right? Three needed the extra year to catch up.

2592
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:14,000
And then

2593
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:16,000
this will be five years

2594
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:18,000
if it comes out in 2018.

2595
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:20,000
So it's not that far

2596
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:22,000
off, but I can't help but feel

2597
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:24,000
like that seems fast. I still think it's

2598
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:26,000
pretty early into the consoles.

2599
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:28,000
Well, let me tell you.

2600
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:30,000
If they do announce

2601
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:32,000
a PS5 between now

2602
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,000
and December 2018,

2603
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,000
I'll say it.

2604
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
Sony's lost. They're playing a catch-up

2605
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:40,000
game. They're starting to realize

2606
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:42,000
we may have fucked up with the 4,

2607
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,000
so we gotta catch up.

2608
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:46,000
There is no reason to release a newer

2609
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:48,000
console at that time.

2610
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:50,000
You know? The most

2611
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:52,000
they could probably do is up the processor

2612
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:54,000
and up the graphics chip.

2613
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:56,000
And at that point,

2614
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:58,000
the games will probably look still wanting

2615
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:00,000
to say. I'm not sure I

2616
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:02,000
totally agree with you on that,

2617
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,000
because Sony is

2618
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:06,000
still selling very well. I don't think

2619
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:08,000
there's really an oh shit moment, but I think

2620
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:10,000
if there's anything oh shit in this,

2621
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:12,000
it's that, oh,

2622
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:14,000
Microsoft is gonna whip out the

2623
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:16,000
teraflops with Scorpio,

2624
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:18,000
so we need to put out PlayStation

2625
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:20,000
5 to basically match Scorpio.

2626
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:22,000
And if they do that, what

2627
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:24,000
was the point of the PS4 Pro in the

2628
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:26,000
first place?

2629
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:28,000
And that's where I agree

2630
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:30,000
with you. Yeah. In that case,

2631
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,000
if that's what they're going to do, the original

2632
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
PS4 is gonna get phased out, and they're

2633
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,000
gonna relabel the Pro as the 4.

2634
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,000
Remember, I mean,

2635
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:40,000
if you look at what Sony has done with

2636
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:42,000
their hardware, I mean, it

2637
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:44,000
wouldn't surprise me if they do this.

2638
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:48,000
I mean, we'll see. Again,

2639
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:50,000
it's a little tinfoil

2640
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:52,000
to fetish this PlayStation 5 stuff.

2641
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:54,000
I still feel like there's a long life left

2642
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:56,000
for PlayStation 4, especially if

2643
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:58,000
5 is backwards compatible

2644
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:00,000
with PlayStation 4, and that's the other way

2645
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:02,000
I could see them doing it, is if

2646
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:04,000
4 is 100% backwards compatible

2647
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:06,000
with 5, so 5 is

2648
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:08,000
really the Pro Pro,

2649
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:10,000
the Pro Plus. What's

2650
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:12,000
gonna end up happening is the Pro is gonna be a wash.

2651
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:14,000
Or, what Rahm is saying is that

2652
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:16,000
Pro is now the 4, and

2653
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:18,000
that just kind of will happen

2654
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:20,000
quietly. But,

2655
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:22,000
the only real advantages are the 4K

2656
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:24,000
things that, again, I think are really

2657
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:26,000
subtle, but anyway,

2658
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:28,000
I think we're getting ahead of ourselves.

2659
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:30,000
I mean, we're trying to forecast 2018,

2660
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:32,000
and we haven't even hit 2017's

2661
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:34,000
E3 yet to really

2662
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:36,000
truly know what Scorpio is.

2663
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:38,000
Yeah, and

2664
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:40,000
speaking of E3, yeah, go on.

2665
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:42,000
No, go ahead.

2666
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,000
I was gonna say, speaking of E3 2017,

2667
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:46,000
is it wrong of me

2668
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:48,000
to be smirky at some of my

2669
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:50,000
friends who are excited about going to E3

2670
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:52,000
for the very first time?

2671
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:54,000
Eh, don't shit on their parade.

2672
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:56,000
I don't say it, I just keep it to myself

2673
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:58,000
because I know people who are going to

2674
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:00,000
a con I'm going to, and then they're flying

2675
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:02,000
out for E3, and I'm just like,

2676
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,000
well, I guess

2677
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:06,000
you'll have to discover how it really

2678
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:08,000
is, you know? Because I just go back from

2679
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:10,000
O-L-R

2680
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:12,000
and we all tell me about E3, and I'm

2681
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:14,000
just like, you know what?

2682
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:16,000
There's no reason for me to go.

2683
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:18,000
To be fair, the ESA

2684
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:20,000
knows they've opened it up to the public

2685
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:22,000
essentially this year. I think the show

2686
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:24,000
will look different from the same

2687
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:26,000
show that Dark Soccer, myself, and Loki

2688
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:28,000
have attended in the past, and for

2689
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:30,000
those reasons, those people may have

2690
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:32,000
a very different experience than what

2691
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:34,000
our experience has been with E3.

2692
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:36,000
Only time will tell.

2693
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:38,000
True, true that.

2694
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:40,000
Alright, well,

2695
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:42,000
Rama, I'm gonna let you go to try to squeeze in another call or two,

2696
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:44,000
and we're gonna wrap up, but thanks so much for your call, buddy. I appreciate it.

2697
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:46,000
Ain't no problem, dude. Alright, later.

2698
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:48,000
Later. Alright,

2699
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:50,000
Orange Launch Radio, all one word on Skype,

2700
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:52,000
if you want to give us a call. Meanwhile,

2701
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,000
Loki, did you have any last minute stories you want to get out there?

2702
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:56,000
Or Dark Soccer, if you have anything. Yeah, I was gonna mention that

2703
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:58,000
the PlayStation 4 has hit

2704
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:00,000
60 million units sold.

2705
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:02,000
That was 20

2706
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:04,000
million of which were last year.

2707
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:06,000
Also, the PlayStation 3 is

2708
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:08,000
closing in on 80 million

2709
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:10,000
sold. That means

2710
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:12,000
4 is probably gonna sell more in its lifeline

2711
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:14,000
than the 3 did. Yeah.

2712
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:16,000
When all is said and done, because keep in mind,

2713
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:18,000
even if they do announce the PlayStation

2714
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:20,000
5 in 2018, that's still another

2715
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:22,000
like, two

2716
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:24,000
years of PS4 sales,

2717
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:26,000
and it's still, they're still, still, still

2718
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:28,000
sell 4's as a quote-unquote

2719
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:30,000
budget con, I can't believe I'm talking this far ahead,

2720
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:32,000
but this is what happens, they'll still sell the 4's

2721
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:34,000
as a quote-unquote budget console for a good

2722
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:36,000
first two years of the 5's life.

2723
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:38,000
Yeah, so it'll be nice when PlayStation

2724
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:40,000
5 comes out and my fucking PlayStation

2725
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:42,000
VR doesn't work with it.

2726
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:44,000
Well, hold on, hold on.

2727
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,000
We don't know anything about that yet.

2728
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,000
Alright, last chance to get in you guys, Orange

2729
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:50,000
Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype

2730
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:52,000
if you want to call it. It had a nice run all one of

2731
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:54,000
two years, one or two years, not

2732
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:56,000
even this point. Will's

2733
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:58,000
E3, E3's coming, you don't know

2734
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:00,000
what they're gonna announce. We never got that Final Fantasy

2735
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:02,000
XV experience yet on VR.

2736
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:04,000
It feels like there's things coming. Still haven't finished

2737
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:06,000
that game either. I need to do the

2738
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:08,000
Radio DLC, I still haven't got around to it.

2739
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:10,000
And I still haven't played the result either.

2740
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:12,000
Time to get

2741
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:14,000
caught up. Alright.

2742
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:16,000
Anything other, any other last minute stories

2743
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:18,000
you want to mention, Logie? That's it.

2744
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:20,000
I have an announcement.

2745
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:22,000
Yes? I want pie.

2746
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:24,000
Oh, that's a great announcement, thank you Dark Slacker.

2747
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:26,000
That's a great announcement. I think that I should have

2748
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:28,000
pie. If pie is what you want,

2749
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:30,000
pie is what you should get. You should get a pie shake.

2750
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:32,000
There's a

2751
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:34,000
cafe near my work that makes pie

2752
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:36,000
shakes. Pie shakes. That's what they do, they

2753
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:38,000
blend up a piece of pie, make it as a shake.

2754
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:40,000
Does my pie shake bring all the boys

2755
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:42,000
to the... No, they need to get out of my yard

2756
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:44,000
unless they're gonna do the yard work.

2757
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:46,000
Alright.

2758
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:48,000
Well, it's being quiet on our phone lines, so I guess

2759
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:50,000
that is going to be it. So we're gonna

2760
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,000
shut it down on the Skype line.

2761
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:54,000
If you want to send

2762
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:56,000
us your thoughts after the show, participate

2763
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:58,000
at orangelandrader.com or you can always

2764
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:00,000
tweet us as well, twitter.com

2765
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:02,000
slash o-l-r. But that is gonna wrap us

2766
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:04,000
up for another night here at Orange Lounge Radio.

2767
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:06,000
But we couldn't say good night

2768
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:08,000
until I plug quickly

2769
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:10,000
nice reviews on iTunes

2770
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:12,000
just like I did earlier, so I'll make it quick.

2771
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:14,000
A nice five star review goes a long way.

2772
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:16,000
You know, if you liked what you heard here at OLR,

2773
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:18,000
we don't take your money for doing the show.

2774
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:20,000
Just help us spread the word. Word of mouth is a great thing.

2775
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:22,000
We had some new people tuning in tonight

2776
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:24,000
thanks to our interview. So thanks to Zircon

2777
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,000
for being here, first and foremost.

2778
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:28,000
And thanks to those of you guys that stopped and checked out

2779
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:30,000
OLR, thanks to that. Or just because

2780
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:32,000
maybe when you saw the tweets at OC

2781
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:34,000
Remix or something, you were like, that show's still fucking

2782
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:36,000
on and you checked us out.

2783
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:38,000
Once

2784
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:40,000
every other month or so, I get a tweet that's

2785
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:42,000
like, you guys are still going.

2786
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:44,000
Yeah, yeah, we're here. So anyway,

2787
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:46,000
thank you, whether it's your first show or your

2788
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:48,000
600th show, we appreciate it all the

2789
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:50,000
same. Thanks for being here.

2790
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:52,000
We gotta go around and get everybody's final

2791
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:54,000
thought for the night. I'll

2792
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:56,000
start and I'll just say

2793
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:58,000
I am ready to be 100% done with

2794
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:00,000
this sickness because although I do feel a lot better,

2795
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:02,000
certainly better than I did last Sunday,

2796
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:04,000
I would still say I'm only like 96%.

2797
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:06,000
I want to be 100% over this

2798
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:08,000
damn cold. Done.

2799
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:10,000
And I don't like the pills I take because they make my head feel like

2800
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:12,000
it's on fire.

2801
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:14,000
I don't like feeling like I'm on fire.

2802
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:16,000
DarkSocker, your final thought for the night.

2803
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:18,000
I hate allergies. Hate,

2804
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:20,000
hate, hate, hate.

2805
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:22,000
With every fiber of

2806
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:24,000
my being.

2807
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:26,000
But, on the

2808
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:28,000
plus side.

2809
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:30,000
No, there's no plus side to it.

2810
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:32,000
I hate it.

2811
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:34,000
Alright, and last but not least,

2812
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:36,000
Loki, your final thought. My final

2813
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:38,000
thought is that

2814
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:40,000
I was gonna 3D print something

2815
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:42,000
larger, like

2816
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:44,000
they have this switch holder thing that you can get.

2817
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:46,000
You can plug in the two switch halves into it.

2818
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:48,000
That's a little bit different. I was gonna print that for you,

2819
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:50,000
but it didn't want to slice it today,

2820
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:52,000
so I couldn't even

2821
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:54,000
try to print it. Is that printer working well for you though?

2822
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:56,000
It's working okay.

2823
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:58,000
I've already broken

2824
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:00,000
the hotbed on it because I tore

2825
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:02,000
up a piece of the cover that was on there,

2826
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:04,000
so I need to put something else on it right now.

2827
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,000
I've taped over it, but

2828
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:08,000
I was in the process of

2829
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:10,000
putting a part cooling fan

2830
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:12,000
on there, so I finally printed the shroud for it,

2831
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:14,000
so I just have to wire that up and then

2832
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:16,000
get the auto-leveling

2833
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:18,000
working. I have to reflash

2834
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:20,000
the firmware and stuff.

2835
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:22,000
I just haven't gotten around to it

2836
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:24,000
because I had been playing with that printer for about

2837
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:26,000
four of the five days

2838
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:28,000
during the week, and I was like, okay, I've got to take a break from it.

2839
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:30,000
When are you going to 3D print me?

2840
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:32,000
I want Rob Roberts action figures.

2841
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:34,000
I'd have to get a 3D model of you to do that.

2842
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:36,000
Alright. Awesome.

2843
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:38,000
And then, I mean,

2844
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:40,000
then we can do it. Mini me.

2845
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:42,000
I think they have phone apps

2846
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:44,000
that sort of do 3D models

2847
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:46,000
with multiple stuff, so

2848
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:48,000
we can try. Awesome.

2849
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:50,000
We're gonna clone me on a 3D printer.

2850
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:52,000
That'd be awesome.

2851
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:54,000
Alright.

2852
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:56,000
Anyway, that's gonna do it for another episode

2853
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:58,000
of Orange Lounge Radio. Thank you guys so much for tuning in.

2854
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:00,000
We will be back next week to do it

2855
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:02,000
all over again. Until

2856
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:04,000
