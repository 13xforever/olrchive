7000	15000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki!
15000	27000	Tonight we talk indie gaming with our friends from the Sacramento IGBA as well as discuss big moves in the gaming industry this week as you all gear up for Persona 5 on another week with a show where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	37000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37000	47000	It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with our 682nd episode for this April the 2nd of 2017 and that's no joke.
47000	50000	My name is Rob Roberts here with you in studio as always.
50000	56000	Look, April Fools was yesterday. I am playing with y'all today. We got too big a show tonight to be doing any jokes.
56000	60000	If only people were as cautious every day as they are on April Fools Day.
60000	64000	Hello Calamity Jamie. Welcome to the show. Remember that's my new favorite name for you.
64000	65000	God.
65000	69000	DarkSakura or Jamie Summers or Calamity Jamie. How are you?
69000	70000	Ugh.
70000	77000	It makes me think. It's not only just the Ganon thing but I also think of like Calamity Jane like the Wild West sort of thing.
77000	81000	Like she's an outlaw who don't give a fuck. Like that whole type of thing. So I think it's fitting.
81000	83000	And you need cowboy boots.
83000	84000	No.
84000	86000	Alright. How are you though otherwise?
86000	88000	I haven't owned a pair of cowboy boots since I was 10.
88000	90000	Are you feeling better?
90000	93000	I am but it might be drugs. No I'm serious.
93000	94000	Legal. Legal. Legal. Prescribed.
94000	95000	Drugs are bad.
95000	96000	Hi Gabe.
96000	97000	No they're good drugs.
97000	98000	We'll get to you in a minute.
98000	99000	I'm on good drugs.
99000	100000	He can't help himself.
100000	103000	I got a shot in the hip of Toradol.
103000	104000	What is that?
104000	108000	It's like ibuprofen but liquid and it lasts for a couple of days.
109000	112000	So it's kind of nice just not hurting for a little while.
112000	115000	But I also don't know if I passed the kidney stone or not.
115000	117000	I would think it would be pretty obvious.
117000	122000	I think it would be obvious and I still have the other non-painful symptoms so whatever.
122000	124000	Alright well hopefully you are.
124000	125000	It's like I can't get a break.
125000	127000	Hopefully this all passes quickly.
127000	130000	Cause I'm still on round. Oh jeez Rob.
130000	131000	That was a pun.
131000	132000	No more cookies for you.
132000	133000	Alright.
133000	134000	I'm gonna take this peeps back.
134000	135000	Not here tonight.
135000	136000	Tech master Loki.
136000	140000	There was a medical issue in Loki's family just a couple hours ago.
140000	144000	I'm told that it's not like I'm probably making it sound way more serious than it is.
144000	147000	But they just you know he had to go take care of business.
147000	151000	He's actually watching the kids right now cause Nellie had to go take care of the other business.
151000	155000	So just thoughts with everybody that everything's going okay.
155000	157000	But we do have to be a little more impromptu tonight.
157000	161000	Cause we actually we have our whole little show thing ready for Loki to be here.
161000	164000	And unfortunately he couldn't be here obviously for those obvious reasons.
164000	165000	So people need.
165000	168000	What is the curse of Orange Launch Radio this year?
168000	169000	Jesus do you guys.
169000	170000	I don't know if you know this.
170000	171000	My mom had surgery this week.
171000	173000	She had a knee replacement surgery on Wednesday.
173000	174000	How's she recovering?
174000	175000	She's fine.
175000	176000	I just went and saw her today.
176000	177000	So she's good.
177000	179000	But she was asking.
179000	181000	I don't know why she asked me about this.
181000	183000	She was asking about Richard Simmons.
183000	185000	Because Richard Simmons.
185000	186000	There was an article about.
186000	188000	Yeah it's in People right.
188000	189000	And so my mom.
189000	192000	That's the person that's still subscribing to People Magazine is my mom.
192000	195000	So she was asking about the podcast.
195000	200000	So I actually got out her iPad mini and I subscribed to missing Richard Simmons.
200000	203000	On her iPad.
203000	205000	By the way I want to point something else out.
205000	208000	My mother was not subscribed to Orange Launch Radio.
208000	210000	So you know I subscribed her to that too.
210000	213000	Even though I don't know if she should be hearing this but.
213000	214000	Hi Rob's mom.
214000	215000	Hi.
215000	217000	Hope you're feeling better.
217000	219000	I still think we should call my mom sometime.
219000	220000	We should.
220000	221000	We have before.
221000	222000	It's been years.
222000	223000	Yeah.
223000	224000	Once.
224000	225000	And then she said told the story about condensation.
225000	227000	Oh my God.
227000	228000	All right.
228000	230000	Do you remember what episode number that was?
230000	231000	Because.
231000	233000	I don't remember what episode number this one is.
233000	234000	682.
234000	235000	682.
235000	236000	OK.
236000	237000	Whatever.
237000	238000	All right.
238000	239000	Anyway.
239000	240000	So not here tonight.
240000	241000	Techmaster Loki.
241000	242000	We'll see him in a couple of weeks.
242000	243000	We're actually not going to be here live next week.
243000	244000	Because we're going to be very busy on Saturday.
244000	247000	And that's thanks to our special in-studio guests.
247000	251000	I want to welcome back to the show some old friends now of Orange Launch Radio.
251000	253000	They've been here enough times that we can call them old friends.
253000	254000	Friends of the show.
254000	255000	Duh.
255000	259000	Say hello to Gabe from Sacramento IGDA.
259000	260000	Ladies first.
260000	263000	Oh and his partner in business crime.
263000	264000	Bree.
264000	265000	Hi.
265000	266000	Hi.
266000	267000	Except everything is legal.
267000	268000	There's no actual crimes being committed.
268000	269000	Just to be clear.
269000	270000	Allegedly.
270000	271000	That we know of.
271000	272000	That we know of.
272000	273000	All right.
274000	276000	And crickets enter the room.
276000	277000	All right.
277000	278000	So.
278000	279000	Sacramento IGDA.
279000	283000	You guys are putting on this big event in West Sacramento.
283000	285000	This coming Saturday.
285000	287000	Give us the elevator pitch.
287000	291000	The 60 second pitch that I'm sure you've had to give 5,000 times this week.
291000	294000	Mister, my dad said he saw you on Good Day Sacramento.
294000	295000	And all this stuff.
295000	296000	By the way.
296000	298000	That was another thing.
298000	300000	Oh I saw some guy on Good Day Sacramento.
300000	304000	I don't remember his name but he was talking about this indie game thing.
304000	305000	If it was a guy it was Gabe.
305000	307000	If it was a gal it was Bree.
307000	308000	It was one of them.
308000	309000	So.
309000	311000	Give us the 60 second pitch you've been giving all over the town.
311000	312000	Oh.
312000	313000	There's no.
313000	314000	There's never consistency with my message.
314000	315000	It's just.
315000	317000	It comes down to one thing.
317000	319000	This is our fourth annual event.
319000	320000	And it is.
320000	325000	Sac and the Arcade is a celebration of independent game development here in Sacramento.
325000	329000	And really spreading wildly throughout the region, the valley.
329000	330000	And beyond that.
330000	333000	And it is.
333000	337000	The core purpose of the second arcade is essentially.
337000	338000	You're gonna play.
338000	339000	You're gonna learn.
339000	341000	And you're gonna be inspired.
341000	342000	By what you.
342000	344000	You know from both playing and learning.
344000	347000	The idea here is that we don't have a job market here.
347000	350000	We didn't have a job market for game development period.
350000	352000	EA is here.
352000	353000	We don't know what they're doing.
353000	356000	And they're not making an impact at all within our community.
356000	357000	And that's fine.
357000	358000	It's all secrets.
358000	359000	Of course.
359000	360000	It's all secrets.
360000	363000	It's one brick wall with windows and they're outside an alleged pizzeria.
363000	364000	Next door to the gay bar.
364000	365000	Right.
365000	366000	True story.
366000	367000	True story.
367000	368000	Yeah.
368000	369000	Right next door to faces.
369000	370000	Next door to faces.
370000	371000	So that's convenient.
371000	372000	We camped out right by that building.
372000	374000	I didn't even realize it was their building until I went back to my car when I was there
374000	375000	for the Sacramento Rainbow Festival.
375000	378000	I thought we tried to take pictures with the shepherd that was in the window at one point.
378000	380000	They used to have a commander shepherd cut out.
380000	381000	Was that you?
381000	382000	Maybe it was Shane.
382000	383000	That wasn't me.
383000	384000	It might have been Shane.
384000	385000	Oh, cause I look so much like Shane.
385000	387000	You Mass Effect fanboys are all the same.
387000	388000	Yeah.
388000	389000	Mass Effect.
389000	390000	Anyway.
390000	394680	So the idea is that, and of course with due respect to EA, thank you for Unravel.
394680	395680	We appreciate it.
395680	396680	But we still don't.
396680	397680	Well thank you for being in Sacramento.
397680	398680	Yeah.
398680	399680	Thank you for being in Sacramento.
399680	402000	Even if y'all are bunkered in there and we don't know what y'all are doing.
402000	403000	Yeah.
403000	404000	Yeah.
404000	405000	Seriously.
405000	406320	But either way, you probably have to pay DLC to go in the front door.
406320	408320	So but I digress.
408320	410320	Anyway so.
410320	411320	Don't burn your bridges yet.
411320	412320	Where's the shade sound Rob?
412320	414320	Oh, where's my shade button?
415320	416320	I'm so sorry.
416320	417320	I'm so sorry.
417320	418320	No.
418320	419320	But seriously.
419320	420320	I didn't think I'd need it with Gabe here.
420320	421320	No.
421320	422320	No.
422320	423320	I'm so sorry.
423320	424320	Now I mean all half jokes aside.
424320	430840	The idea here is that we're creating, we've created, we're nurturing and strengthening
430840	437040	and empowering this community to feel like that their dream can come true.
437040	439440	Their idea can become something more.
439440	444120	And it's gonna get played by your local neighbor.
444120	445320	And then some.
445320	449880	And we, you know, again, we're approaching the fourth year of it and it has been incredible.
449880	456040	I'm already more nervous than excited about the turnout for this this weekend because
456040	458640	I've already seen numbers and oh my God.
458640	460060	So yeah, it's.
460060	461060	But that's the good.
461060	462060	No, no.
462060	463060	It's great.
463060	464060	How are these people going to fucking fit?
464060	465060	Yeah.
465060	466060	Yeah.
466060	467060	That's yeah.
467060	468060	Yeah.
468060	469060	Pretty.
469060	470060	Yeah.
470060	471060	Pretty much so.
471060	472060	Yeah.
472060	473060	But that but that's what we're here for.
473060	474060	You know.
474100	477940	And every time we're going to have the there's going to be a cafe in the venue so you'd be
477940	478940	able to buy stuff.
478940	480940	Oh, I just met I just met with the food charge.
480940	481940	You get people outside.
481940	482940	Oh, that's true.
482940	486140	BlizzCon did that a while ago and it was really good for them because it gets people outside
486140	487140	and you know.
487140	488140	Well, that's true.
488140	489140	Yeah, that's true, too.
489140	492060	But I remember hoofing it to the subway across the street last year.
492060	493060	Oh, yeah.
493060	494060	You still have those options.
494060	495060	But yeah.
495060	498660	So but that's essentially what what second the arcade is all about.
498660	502980	And it's been it's defined by our people.
502980	504320	It's not defined by me.
504320	505660	It's not defined by Brianna.
505660	510340	It's you know, we we we host, you know, we we come up with with ways to keep improving
510340	514100	on how we did the year before and, you know, continuous outreach.
514100	515940	But it is defined by the people that come through.
515940	520300	It is absolutely defined by Dark Sakura or we will all face a reign of terror.
520300	521300	That's really what it.
521300	522300	No, I'm kidding.
522300	523300	I'm kidding.
523300	524300	I'm kidding.
524300	525300	All right.
525300	526300	But no.
526300	528820	When you when you say and I want the audience to know this and I realize that our audience
528820	532500	is not like we maybe like two percent of our listeners are in Sacramento.
532500	535760	Like if that like most of our listeners, we have listeners in Japan.
535760	537700	We have listeners in Australia with Canada.
537700	540020	So not everybody's going to be able to attend this event.
540020	541020	All that.
541020	542020	Yes.
542020	543020	Of course.
543020	544020	We have listeners in Belgium.
544020	545020	How could I forget the chocolate?
545020	546020	How could I forget?
546020	547020	But anyway.
547020	549620	So, you know, luckily, we'll be able to do the virtual thing and, you know, bring some
549620	550620	to you.
550620	553460	So although if you are like anywhere, like you're within 100 miles, Sacramento, you really
553460	556340	should be trying to come here in person.
556340	557340	And they are there.
557340	561620	We are actually we actually are going to have some out of staters again this time.
561740	567580	In fact, we we got hit with some international game developer submissions as well.
567580	568580	Yeah.
568580	571340	We got was that we're we got hit with some international game developers as well.
571340	572340	Mexico.
572340	573340	No, I mean, like Singapore.
573340	574340	Oh, my God.
574340	578340	Singapore, the UAE, Australia, Italy, Italy, Russia.
578340	579340	Yeah.
579340	580340	We got.
580340	581340	Yeah.
581340	583980	So I mean, they actually show up and that's another thing.
583980	587020	But the fact that they even heard how they heard about us is beyond me.
587020	588020	But but but somewhere.
588020	589020	Yeah, indeed.
589020	590020	But yeah.
590420	593060	You know, we're just spreading out loud like wildfire.
593060	600780	So but now again, you know, I mentioned Breed and, you know, her her two cents in this.
600780	606460	So, you know, it's Breed why don't you share your thoughts on on this expand.
606460	608460	Thanks, partner.
608460	609460	Welcome.
609460	615240	I'd like to say, you know, with you touching on your international audience, we are proud
615240	620260	to say I think we've established that we are California's capital city that has their
620260	625000	very first video game event to be proud of because California is the fifth largest economy
625000	626000	in the world.
626000	628280	Why didn't Sacramento have something like that already established?
628280	634600	So thanks to Orange Challenge Radio for helping us grow and setting a precedence here.
634600	640280	We are able to say that we've had international game studios submit and then figure out that,
640280	641460	oh, they're in Sacramento.
641460	642960	It's kind of close to San Francisco.
642960	644800	Like, should we come up?
645360	646360	Oh, my God.
646360	647680	Heck, I just it.
647680	649200	It's just a natural fit.
649200	650800	India and India is just a natural fit.
650800	654920	We're so happy to be involved because I think we've been able to really see the growth.
654920	658360	It's kind of like you said, like for a long time, you just kind of thought like, oh, EA
658360	660320	has an office here, even though we're not sure what they do.
660320	663160	But otherwise, like you don't really see a lot of the game development in Sacramento.
663160	666720	But now it's like, you know, especially in large parts of this event, it's like, wow,
666720	671760	you really see the passion that not just this community has, but you know, what's spilling
671760	676080	in from the Bay Area, what's coming up from San Diego and all this, you know, our neighbors
676080	677080	as well.
677080	679240	Sacramento is a very central city.
679240	681720	After all, this city was founded on the railroads, right?
681720	682720	It was a big part of it.
682720	687080	It was a very central kind of thing, but we're not a cow town, we're not a cow town.
687080	688080	And gold.
688080	689080	That's Vacaville.
689080	690080	Literally.
690080	691080	Yes.
691080	694680	I have to acknowledge our chat room as well over at live.vognetwork.com.
694680	695680	Hi chat room.
695680	700800	We do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, vognetwork.com.
700840	703440	It's six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
703440	707960	And if you are listening live, head on over to live.vognetwork.com where they're talking
707960	711320	about choc, choco tacos and is this something you did?
711320	712920	No, no, no, no.
712920	716840	Well, I just said choco taco, but act-deaf reminded us of Mexico.
716840	717840	Yeah.
717840	718840	Oh yes.
718840	719840	We have a listener in Mexico right now.
719840	720840	And the tacos are better than chocolate.
720840	721840	Yes.
721840	725200	And so my response was no, no, choco taco.
725600	731000	JD, our pal who lives in the San Francisco area says, I'm looking forward to going to
731000	732000	IGDA.
732000	733000	Yay.
733000	734000	It's my first one.
734000	735000	He's coming.
735000	736000	He's coming for that.
736000	737000	Yup.
737000	738000	We welcome you.
738000	739000	Thank you, JD.
739000	740000	Is your last name Phoenix?
740000	741000	I don't think it is.
741000	742000	Oh my God.
742000	743000	I know JD and I don't think it is.
743000	745360	If it is, we, we, you need to be my friend.
745360	746960	So he can be your friend anyway though, right?
746960	747960	I'll be Carmine.
747960	749440	Uh, let's see.
749440	752400	Going to some other comments from our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
752400	757280	Raginator says question for Gabe and Brie, which, but this question is from Raginator.
757280	763600	So which do you think will happen first Half Life 3 getting released or Loki finishing
763600	765000	a game?
765000	773120	Ooh, even I know the answer to that because I was looking forward to kind of busting his
773120	774120	balls.
774120	775120	Yeah.
775120	780800	That's kind of why, you know, I mean, I'm like three confirmed folks love you.
780800	781800	Love you.
782200	787560	I'm sure we're not going to get through an episode without this, so I'll just keep that
787560	788560	handy.
788560	789560	Yes.
789560	790560	Anyway.
790560	796120	Well, wait, hold on, mister.
796120	797120	Where's Crumple?
797120	799120	Um, it's almost done.
799120	800120	Crumple's almost finished.
800120	803440	Do we have that almost done back when you were here in February?
803440	804440	Yeah.
804440	807760	And it's almost, it's only one other guy and myself.
807760	810600	It's being polished.
810600	811600	With a lot of flax.
811600	812600	Okay.
812600	813600	I got, I got to give you a little shit.
813600	814600	What's the status of Crumple?
814600	815600	So it'll be wax paper?
815600	817720	Will I, will I get to play Crumple?
817720	821040	Um, I cannot confirm or deny that as a matter of fact, we're not even going to go there
821040	822040	just yet.
822040	823040	Jesus Lord.
823040	824280	I can't keep anything a secret.
824280	825280	Well done on that.
825280	826280	Anyway.
826280	827280	So no, no, no.
827280	828720	I'm saying, no, that was great.
828720	832640	That was a wild coincidental guest and we're not going to talk about that idea for episode
832640	833640	three.
833640	834640	Anyway.
834640	837640	You're going to have to sign an NDA first.
837640	838640	No.
838640	840560	That's the show after the show.
840560	842920	So Crumple is almost done.
842920	846800	And by almost done, I mean 97% done.
846800	847800	We're fine.
847800	850480	We're fine tuning the ending and then the ending's almost done.
850480	852880	I got to look at it earlier this week.
852880	855480	It is beautiful.
855480	861840	In the message that it's, that I was hoping for it to convey and, and I, and I hope, I
861840	867560	hope it made, I showed, I showed her, I showed Brianna and she really liked it a lot.
867560	870520	So, but there's more, there's been more since then.
870520	872360	And yeah, so we're, we're almost there.
872360	873360	We're almost there.
873360	878800	We're hoping this month will finally be it and, and we're already developing episode
878800	879800	two.
879800	881760	And yeah, so, but you can pre-order now.
881760	882760	You can pre-order right.
882760	883760	You still can pre-order.
883760	884760	Go on my Twitter.
884760	887720	It's on there and on my pin tweet and yeah, it's pre-orders a buck.
887720	889320	When it goes on sale will be two.
889320	890320	Nice.
890320	891920	And nascent games on Twitter, right?
891920	892920	Nascent games.
892920	893920	Yeah.
893920	894920	At nascent games.
894920	898440	You can see gameplay of it right now, just in case, for those who have no idea what we're
898440	901000	even talking about, nascentgames.net.
901000	903120	And you can see gameplay immediately of Crumple.
903120	907320	Wasn't there a demo on itch.io or is that not there anymore?
907320	911240	I think the old demo is still on, on, on, on, but it's not, it's an old demo.
911240	912240	Yeah.
912240	914560	The, the, the, the most up to the final demos are on Newgrounds.
914560	918720	You can go, you can play on through your browser on Newgrounds or you can download it on GameJolt.
918720	919720	Okay.
919720	923480	So yeah, we're hoping to get it released on those sites, the full game and as well as
923480	924480	congregate.
924480	926140	Um, and then a couple other spots, so.
926140	927880	Or get your butt to West Sacramento on Saturday.
927880	928880	Yeah.
928880	929880	Come next Saturday.
929880	930880	You can play there.
930880	931880	So play it there.
931880	932880	Absolutely.
932880	933880	Excited for you.
933880	934880	So I had to give you a little bit of crap on that.
934880	935880	Totally.
935880	936880	Okay.
936880	937880	You're not.
937880	938880	All right.
938880	939880	Okay.
939880	940880	Um, okay.
940880	941880	So, so when you talk about this whole like play, learn, inspire, like I know sometimes
941880	946160	people come here to promote their stuff with their taglines and a lot of us go, okay, yeah,
946160	947160	sure.
947160	948160	Cheesy.
948160	952080	But you guys like, no, seriously, like, I really think that is a great way to describe
952080	956080	the event because I have to admit, even from my perspective, you know, the very first year
956080	958520	we didn't get to do, we, we hadn't met yet.
958520	961960	We were connected the very, very first year, but we got to do this event with you guys
961960	962960	the second year.
962960	965400	And I remember, you know, I was kind of going into it going, okay, well, this is cool.
965400	966880	It's gonna be like a local thing.
966880	970440	And I saw the list of speakers and I was like, okay, well, I don't, I don't really know any
970440	971440	of these people.
971440	972440	They're local.
972440	975620	I'm like, I'm not really gonna expect much, whatever will be interesting.
975620	979520	But I was, I was like really blown away by like the quality of speakers that you guys
979520	981360	been drawing to the event.
981360	985760	Not just that year, you guys had a great set of people last year as well, which was even
985760	989280	great networking to meet people like Kat and Michelle and some of the people we had last
989280	990280	year.
990280	991280	Absolutely.
991280	996040	Um, you know, you, you guys, I think really have brought that inspiration and like thinking
996040	997040	stuff.
997040	999400	And I'm really happy that through VOG, we can kind of bring that to you guys virtually
999400	1000400	a little bit.
1000400	1003520	I know some of you guys have heard it, uh, in chat that, you know, we're listening here
1003520	1006840	the past couple of years, but, um, maybe I'll pick on Bree a little more here.
1006840	1010160	Um, what, tell us a little bit about the speakers you guys have lined up for this year.
1010160	1011760	What we're going to hear about this year.
1011760	1017360	So we're really proud of the lineup that, um, Gabe has really, you know, spearheaded
1017360	1018360	and putting together.
1018360	1023080	We try to be conscious of, you know, making it diverse.
1023080	1026160	Um, obviously we have some ladies who will be attending.
1026160	1028640	Michelle Hill will be our keynote speaker.
1028640	1031120	She is originally from Rancho Cordova.
1031120	1035100	She now works at two K games out in the Bay area over the last 12 months.
1035100	1040320	She has come back and poured into our community, mentoring our developers, um, really pouring
1040320	1041420	her heart into it.
1041420	1043180	And we appreciate her so much for that.
1043180	1044180	Yeah.
1044180	1045180	She's really cool.
1045180	1046180	I met, I got met her and got to talk with her last year.
1046180	1047180	She's great.
1047180	1048180	She's great.
1048180	1049180	Yes.
1049180	1050180	And she's grown as well.
1050180	1053900	Um, her first time speaking in public was last year at the 2016 second year arcade.
1053900	1057660	Just a few weeks ago, she spoke at the game developers conference in San Francisco.
1057660	1059720	That's up on YouTube and in the vault.
1059720	1063300	If you guys want to check that out, but you gave her her big break.
1063300	1065460	We gave her her big break.
1065460	1066500	We did.
1066500	1071040	And how it happened to this day, we laugh about how it even happened to begin with.
1071040	1075600	She just happened to email us through the website on the contact form.
1075600	1077540	I thought she was fake.
1077540	1079620	So cause I'm looking her up on LinkedIn.
1079620	1084300	I'm like, you're, you can't, someone, not some, nobody from two K games is seriously
1084300	1085380	going to know about who we are.
1085380	1089060	I remember telling Brie, like Brie, someone from two K games just messaged us.
1089060	1090060	She's gotta be a fake.
1090060	1092540	And it turns out, Oh my God, no, she's not.
1093140	1098300	She ends up being a speaker last year, as Brianna said, and, and which is why it's like
1098300	1101040	the amount of support just out of nowhere.
1101040	1107860	She came, she came from the heavens and just help and has just helped us out from just
1107860	1110940	continuing to educate our community.
1110940	1111940	It's been wonderful.
1111940	1112940	Absolutely wonderful.
1112940	1116240	So yeah, hometown girls coming back.
1116240	1120540	We also have the co-founder of Code for Hood, Alana Jennings.
1120540	1126700	She works with youth that may not have much exposure to STEM programs like game development.
1126700	1130000	She's going to be doing a presentation on what her organization has done.
1130000	1134060	They also want a big grant from the city of Sacramento to help accelerate their program.
1134060	1136240	So we're really proud to feature her.
1136240	1139900	We have people from the United States Patent and Trademark Office because this is the one
1139900	1141460	I'm looking forward to the most.
1141460	1142460	I am.
1142460	1144900	No, this is, we don't talk about this crap enough.
1144900	1146600	I say that lovingly, but you know what I mean?
1146600	1149060	Like you're right, but, but it becomes like that thing.
1149060	1151780	Like when you're designing a game and stuff for these issues, these legal issues you get
1151780	1154540	into the, you're probably not even thinking of in the beginning of it.
1154540	1156480	I am really interested in this.
1156480	1160600	This is a part of like game development that I think we don't ever like think about or
1160600	1161600	talk about enough.
1161600	1162600	So.
1162600	1163600	Right.
1163600	1166660	And that's one thing Gabe and I try to impress upon our community here is, you know, we want
1166660	1168420	our developers to be successful.
1168420	1173600	We want to help them grow smart and to build a strong foundation so that they're not a,
1173600	1176420	you know, fly by night entity, if you will.
1176420	1181280	So that's why we incorporate the business serious side with the United States Patent
1181280	1182280	and Trademark Office.
1182280	1185940	But I just, I just have to drop this here because you'll get a kick out of this, Bree.
1185940	1190160	Our pal Bobby Blackwell, who does the show before us here at VOG, he's actually mentioning
1190160	1191160	in chat.
1191160	1194880	I got to meet Kat, who was one of the speakers last year in Atlanta last year.
1194880	1195880	And I was like, did you name drop?
1195880	1196880	He's like, of course I did.
1196880	1202280	She's like, I know OLR, she's recognized, so there, yeah, so there you go through some
1202280	1204060	of this whole networking thing.
1204060	1205060	Beautiful.
1205060	1206060	Creates contacts in other places.
1206700	1210960	We're also going to have now, unfortunately, we don't get to do this part on VOG because
1210960	1211960	it's music.
1211960	1216240	But if you're going to be there in person, you guys you guys got like, I mean, your musicians
1216240	1219720	in the past have been great, but you got one that like people are are going to know this
1219720	1220720	year, right?
1220720	1221720	Yeah.
1221720	1222720	Thanks to Rockage on this one.
1222720	1227080	They you know, we were you know, we were actively looking for somebody and, you know, we try
1227080	1232900	to highlight just one good person, you know, to to, you know, just, you know, be a part
1232900	1236640	of the vibe, enhance, further enhance the vibe, you know, at our event.
1236640	1241280	And yeah, we have we have I didn't even know this either until after way afterwards.
1241280	1245000	Ben Prunty, Prunty, I don't want to say prune like prunty.
1245000	1249780	But anyway, so Ben Prunty, he is actually the guy that made the music for FTL.
1249780	1252860	So which is insanity.
1252860	1253860	And I freaked out completely.
1253860	1255720	I was like, oh, my goodness.
1255720	1260660	And yeah, so it was it was a big deal to have him a part of this of this event this time
1260660	1261660	around.
1261660	1263100	And we are eternally grateful for it.
1263100	1269960	And I think this will be his second live show, I think, because this first one was Rockage
1269960	1273440	just a month and a half about a month and a half ago.
1273440	1274440	So this will be a second.
1274440	1275800	But his first time in Sacramento.
1275800	1278040	So yeah, this will be this is going to be big.
1278040	1284000	And y'all may think you haven't heard of him, but you have because that Humble Freedom Bundle
1284000	1287200	that just was out not that long ago, FTL was in that, right?
1287200	1288760	Was the soundtrack in that too?
1288760	1289760	I remember.
1289860	1292820	I want to say yes, but I might be off somebody in chat.
1292820	1297180	That's that's what the great thing about having a chat room is we get live fact checking because
1297180	1304660	if we screw up, like that's an alternative fact, Rob, that's not at least someone's fact
1304660	1305660	checking.
1305660	1306660	In general.
1306660	1307660	Take a shot.
1307660	1308660	All right.
1308660	1320380	Black Wolf in chat says FTL is usually in bundles.
1320380	1324260	So you most likely have it at some point in the game is, you know, it's a very well known
1324260	1325260	indie game.
1325260	1326260	So that's great.
1326260	1327580	That's gonna be cool that you have that.
1327580	1331440	And hopefully I'll be able to slip him a business card to get him on our show, if not for a
1331440	1333560	performance to at least talk about the music a little bit.
1333560	1334560	So I'll be cool.
1334560	1335560	It's all about networking.
1335560	1336560	Yes.
1337060	1341880	You know, the Sacramento shows us in the game back game bang.
1341880	1348320	I can't say their name five times fast, those guys, but video game, game, game, game, game,
1348320	1349320	game, bang.
1349320	1350320	I can't fucking do it.
1350320	1351320	VGB.
1351320	1352320	VGB.
1352320	1353320	I like that.
1353320	1356440	So us and VGB are going to be circling like cocks.
1356440	1360240	Come on the show, come on the show.
1360240	1361520	And hey, it's all good.
1361520	1362580	Those guys are awesome, too.
1362580	1365240	And I'm sure we'll have all the same guests, but we're going to both have fun.
1365240	1366240	It'll be good.
1366920	1367920	Excellent.
1367920	1368920	Excellent.
1368920	1369920	Um, I'm still looking forward to the event.
1369920	1374600	Um, what, what, um, have you, have you tried to do anything to this for either of you that
1374600	1375600	want to answer it?
1375600	1379960	Have you tried to do anything different this year compared to last year or you kind of
1379960	1384520	like after last year show, you're like, okay, this formula, like this worked well, so we're
1384520	1386040	going to kind of roll with it again.
1386040	1387040	Like we got it.
1387040	1388040	We got a template now.
1388040	1389040	Yeah.
1389040	1390040	Bree
1390040	1395060	we really want to make it like a Disney freaking experience.
1395060	1398460	It's supposed to be an interactive day, right?
1398460	1403580	And you know, we're, we don't have any sponsors, but I'm working with the resources that I
1403580	1408260	have to make it feel like people are watching, walking into an actual arcade.
1408260	1414020	You're going to have the sounds and the feel and the looks and we just want it all encompassing.
1414020	1416820	Oh, this is why you guys were there setting up the art.
1416820	1420060	Or am I supposed to say that you guys are no, no, you can, no, you totally tweeted it.
1420060	1423180	I can say it's out there.
1423180	1427340	You were setting up the art gallery stuff there, which I don't remember that last year.
1427340	1428340	That's new.
1428340	1429340	This is brand new.
1429340	1430340	Yeah.
1430340	1431340	Yeah.
1431340	1432340	I like that.
1432340	1435460	So you're taking a Disney approach because one thing that separates Disneyland from like,
1435460	1441620	I don't know, um, Marine world is that, um, when you go on like Indiana Jones, right,
1441620	1446580	you're even, you're standing in the line and you can like shake the pole and the rope that
1446580	1447960	the guy will fall from, right?
1447960	1450040	Like everything around is an experience.
1450040	1453520	Whereas like at Marine world, it's like, okay, you're going to go on the Superman roller
1453520	1459000	coaster and there's literally nothing Superman about it except for the screams of pure terror
1459000	1460180	that you hear coming from the ride.
1460180	1461180	That's really it.
1461180	1463840	Um, practically hear that on the drive going there.
1463840	1468020	She's on I 80, you know, no, no disrespect to Marine world, but that's something that
1468020	1469320	Disney does very well.
1469320	1470320	Right.
1470320	1471320	So I like that approach.
1471320	1476960	So you want, you're gonna, you're gonna create that environment more this year.
1476960	1477960	Definitely very cool.
1477960	1478960	Very cool.
1478960	1479960	I'm so excited to be a part of it.
1479960	1480960	And that's just one aspect.
1480960	1481960	Yeah.
1481960	1482960	One.
1482960	1483960	That's one.
1483960	1484960	Yeah.
1484960	1485960	So you guys don't just have indie games.
1485960	1488920	I mean, I don't know how you cram this all in that space, but you do.
1488920	1490800	You don't just have any games.
1490800	1494920	You're going to have like retrospectives and stuff too.
1494920	1495920	Huh?
1495920	1496920	Yes.
1496920	1497920	Pretty much.
1497920	1498920	Yeah.
1498920	1501760	We're going to be, I'm going to let Brie laugh that one off, but, um, the, the idea here
1501760	1508180	is, is that, um, yeah, we, one thing we, one thing we, um, the gallery is one thing that
1508180	1510780	we're incorporating for this, for this new event.
1510780	1515460	Um, and we're super, super excited and very grateful to the community center for, you
1515460	1517020	know, for that addition.
1517020	1520620	Um, and, uh, if you happen to be in West Sac, stop by it.
1520620	1523020	The art's on display all week, so be sure to go by there.
1523020	1524020	Check that out.
1524020	1528080	Um, you know, but we, well, there's a few things we weren't successful with because
1528080	1529080	of the timing of such.
1529080	1530820	We're hoping to incorporate that for next year.
1530820	1536940	Um, but yeah, indie developers, both video, VR and board and tabletop.
1536940	1541180	Um, and then, um, we'll, we will also, you know, again, we talked about the speakers
1541180	1542420	and the panelists as well.
1542420	1543820	Uh, additional game tournaments.
1543820	1546020	We're going to have a speed runner this time.
1546020	1551300	Um, yeah, he's a pretty significant speed runner and uh, yeah, yeah.
1551300	1553340	Thanks to console cadence and them for that.
1553340	1556660	So you have console Cade, you have Atari party parties coming back.
1556660	1557660	Absolutely.
1557660	1558660	That's, that's an absolute must.
1558660	1566720	So that's a touch part of the vault Dan brings, Dan brings 52 hundreds, by the way, our chatters
1566720	1571920	running away with this Disney thing, by the way, uh, dungeon buster says walking into
1571920	1572920	an actual arcade.
1572920	1574120	I like this approach.
1574120	1579760	Uh, Bobby Black Wolf is asking, can I go ahead and register my fast passes?
1579760	1583480	Is a season pass to sack in the arcade a thousand dollars?
1583480	1586480	We're going to incorporate that on our Indiegogo campaign for 2018.
1586480	1588480	Thank you for that suggestion.
1588480	1591240	Will I have the music playing in line stuck in my head?
1591240	1595680	Will it be a world of laughter and a world of tears?
1595680	1599080	In a world of hope and a world of fear.
1599080	1600560	This is already a world of pain.
1600560	1601560	Seriously.
1601560	1602560	Yes.
1602560	1603560	Thank you.
1603560	1604560	Yeah.
1604560	1605560	JD is following that up.
1605560	1606800	One thing that separates them is about $50 in admission.
1606800	1607800	There you go.
1607800	1608800	That's right.
1608800	1610200	That's actually very $10.
1610200	1611200	That's right.
1611200	1615480	Will there be speakers hidden inside rocks?
1615480	1616480	We can arrange that.
1616480	1617480	Don't go looking.
1617480	1619480	Let's just leave it that way.
1619480	1620480	Don't go look.
1620480	1621480	Yeah.
1621480	1622480	We got a funny fucking bunch.
1622480	1624480	These people are funny as shit.
1624480	1625480	Oh, you nerds.
1625480	1628880	We should have a two drink minimum here.
1628880	1629880	Seriously.
1629880	1630880	The voice of geeks network.
1630880	1631880	They come out.
1631880	1632880	They come out in force.
1632880	1634160	All them funny geeks all over.
1634160	1639320	It's probably a bad segue then for me to talk about the charitable organizations that'll
1639320	1640320	be there.
1640320	1641320	No, let's.
1641320	1642320	Come on.
1642320	1643920	It's all about doing some good.
1643920	1646820	We can laugh and throw shade and stuff as long as we know at the end of the day we're
1646820	1647820	doing good.
1647820	1648820	Yeah, right.
1648820	1649820	We're making a positive impact.
1649820	1650820	Absolutely.
1650820	1654300	The Sacramento Guild for Extra Life is also going to be on site.
1654300	1657740	They're going to be hanging out with our Street Fighter tournament.
1657740	1661780	And we also have a new organization that we're welcoming called the Gamers Gift.
1661780	1667260	And they're based out of UC Davis college students who take VR consoles and video games
1667260	1670900	to senior care facilities and children's hospitals.
1670900	1676600	And they basically try to, you know, help liven up the atmosphere there and bring the
1676600	1677820	adventure to them.
1677820	1680500	That's like when you used to hear about the Nintendo Wiis.
1680500	1684560	The Wii Sports Bowling were at all the senior care facilities and stuff to get more seniors
1684560	1685560	into gaming.
1685560	1690900	But I didn't even think of VR as something that could do that.
1690900	1692460	That's really cool.
1692460	1695860	I see Bobby Blackwell sitting up in his chair out there somewhere.
1695860	1699240	He's our big VR guy on the network.
1699240	1702600	So people will get a chance to meet them and learn more about who they are and how they
1702600	1704920	can help their local organization too.
1704920	1705920	That's so cool.
1705920	1706920	I love that's a great idea.
1706920	1708180	I love that.
1708180	1712220	So yeah, we are we are not we are not just another convention.
1712220	1713220	We are.
1713220	1714220	We're really trying.
1714220	1715220	No, we are.
1715220	1716300	There's no trying.
1716300	1718100	We are.
1718100	1724020	We are standing out with with reference to the amount of folks we were trying to impact
1724020	1725820	both locally and beyond.
1725820	1732540	And you know, have substance in our event where it's not just a day, it's not just as
1732540	1735060	you mentioned earlier, a day of networking.
1735060	1738280	It's going to be an incredible day of networking.
1738280	1743520	But then from that point, the hope I have for this is that someone's going to walk in
1743520	1747960	there be a younger old and they're going to play something or they're going to hear they're
1747960	1753160	going to meet someone and they're going to say, I can and they're going to be and then
1753160	1756200	they're going to leave and they're going to find out how they're going to be able to utilize
1756200	1759280	that because I was that person five and a half years ago.
1759280	1765740	Or if they're Loki, they say, I will someday, eventually when I have time.
1765740	1768500	Push that shade button, sir.
1768500	1769500	Fantastic.
1769500	1775280	But yes, that's Loki.
1775280	1776280	We love you.
1776280	1777280	Damn it.
1777280	1778280	Get that game done already.
1778280	1783340	Which I would like to stop busting his balls for a second because we will have a game developer
1783340	1786780	panelist gentleman there who develops games with his kids.
1786780	1791640	And props to Loki for doing the family bit and being on the show and holding down the
1791640	1792640	day job.
1792640	1794560	But if others can do it, Loki can do it too.
1794560	1800040	So hopefully he takes notes during that panel.
1800040	1803560	I thought she was going to get sick of that fucking button by the end of the night.
1803560	1809920	I could have sworn she said, you know, let's not bust his balls and then just busted his
1809920	1811920	balls anyway.
1811920	1816020	That was the shade because I'm not going to do it directly, but I totally just did it.
1816040	1818040	But indirectly, I'm going to do it anyway.
1818040	1819040	Ninjas.
1819040	1820040	No.
1820040	1821040	We love Loki.
1821040	1822040	Come on.
1822040	1829680	And that's actually a good mention too because one of the speakers, our dear friend Steve
1829680	1833800	Whitney, he's going to be talking, one of his panels is going to be highlighting just
1833800	1834800	that.
1834800	1841200	The importance of parents and their children, you know, gaming and game developing together.
1841200	1845920	We're actually going to have a couple of game studios where it's actually parent and child
1845920	1849580	together and showing off their game.
1849580	1856540	One art piece in a gallery we received this past Friday, the poster is a great 80s style
1856540	1861300	poster of the game that they're working on, RC battle, RC car battle.
1861300	1868500	And the idea is that there's a kid with an old school retro style motorcycle helmet on
1868500	1871820	with holding a remote control and it happens to be a son and the game is actually a son's
1871820	1872820	idea.
1872820	1873820	Oh, cool.
1873820	1875240	It's just absolutely incredible.
1875240	1879680	I mean, I was so touched by that.
1879680	1881920	We actually had the pleasure of meeting them briefly.
1881920	1882920	It was fantastic.
1882920	1890680	So that's just an example of how we, you know, how in the arcade, SAC and the arcade is going
1890680	1897240	to continue to be different and forge its own path and not copy other paths.
1897240	1903580	We're going to forge our own path into creating something much more significant here.
1903580	1908560	Because as I said earlier in the show, there was no job market for game development period
1908560	1909560	here.
1909560	1910560	There just wasn't.
1910560	1911560	But now we do.
1911560	1914300	Now we have one and it's, and it's just getting better.
1914300	1915980	So well, okay.
1915980	1919040	If y'all are local, I don't know how to sell this shit to you anymore.
1919040	1920900	Like you aren't already planning on attending.
1920900	1922980	I really don't know what else I can say at this point.
1922980	1926800	So I hope you all are planning to be here to hang out with Gabe, to hang out with Bree
1926800	1928620	and us at VOG Network.
1928620	1934860	We will be upstairs in the little black box all day to work with the broadcast of the
1934860	1938860	actual panels so that if you can't be here live, you can at least check out some of the
1938860	1939860	panels.
1939860	1943980	Although I'll warn you, tech shit always happens, so it's not super reliable.
1943980	1947620	But if nothing else, we'll have it all taped and we're planning to rebroadcast it.
1947620	1950820	Hopefully WinOLR would usually be on the next night since we're not going to actually be
1950820	1951820	here the next night.
1951820	1955980	So that'll be an opportunity for folks to check that out if nothing else.
1955980	1957740	So we always have a plan B.
1957860	1958860	Always have a plan B.
1959860	1960860	Awesome.
1960860	1961860	So, yeah.
1961860	1966300	So we'll talk more, of course, about the event and what you guys are up to as we move on
1966300	1967300	throughout the show tonight.
1967300	1970300	But I do want to make sure we get to some of the other topics going on in gaming world
1970300	1971300	this week.
1971300	1975500	So let's move on and talk about, we'll get into gaming news in a moment here, but I want
1975500	1979180	to talk quickly about this because Dark Soccer, you weren't here last week because you had
1979180	1981660	the Kidney Stone thing going on.
1981660	1985800	And we got to hear a little bit from you on Skype about this, but I really got the sense
1985840	1990360	you didn't really get to dive into Mass Effect Andromeda until this week.
1990360	1994640	So I want to check in with you a little bit more about how the game is going because I
1994640	1997560	don't often listen to this show because I live it.
1997560	1999320	I don't need to listen to it again usually.
1999320	2003000	But I did kind of listen back to last week's show and in listening back, I was kind of
2003000	2007040	like, God, I might've been like a little harsh on the game because at the end of the day,
2007040	2012000	I'm still a fan of Mass Effect, but, and I know we use this scenario all the time and
2012000	2017880	y'all are sick of hearing this metaphor, but it's that whole Tyra Banks yelling at the
2017880	2023440	model thing because it's the things you care about the most that you're going to blow up
2023440	2024880	and yell at first.
2024880	2027880	And so I think kind of some of that was happening last week a little bit with Mass Effect because
2027880	2032000	Dark Soccer, I know you weren't here, but I got into a little bit about the lack of
2032000	2037600	the gay romances that were in it and some of that that was going on and well, because
2037600	2042280	there's only two and there's a trophy for three and you can't actually get the trophy
2042280	2043280	if you choose to play.
2043280	2044280	Yeah, you can.
2044280	2045280	No, you can't.
2045280	2049480	Because there's ladies and there's dudes and you can do lesbian and you can do Dark
2049480	2050480	Sakura.
2050480	2054840	You, I don't think, I don't know if you're understanding, but you, I can't just, if I
2054840	2058520	want to play a gay writer, I can't just suddenly say, oh, I'm going to sleep with a woman to
2058520	2059520	get the trophy.
2059520	2060520	Well, no, no, no, no.
2060520	2065360	I mean that you could play a female character and get a lesbian romance, but you see, you
2065360	2066360	see where the issue is, right?
2066360	2067360	I do.
2068120	2070520	I don't get that, but I think that there actually are more lesbian options.
2070520	2076080	Well, yes, and that's great for the gay ladies, but it's also kind of like, you know, it kind
2076080	2083580	of also, in my opinion, reinforces a trope that being a lesbian is more acceptable than
2083580	2086520	being gay, which I've had to deal with in my life, right?
2086520	2091060	And you know, anybody that's had to deal with that whole, well, if the two chicks are making
2091060	2093400	out that's hot, you know, that whole, it's that thing.
2093400	2094400	That's the only thing that bothers me about.
2094440	2098200	But anyway, I promised I wouldn't be negative this week, but just to recap, those are some
2098200	2099680	of the things we were talking about last week.
2099680	2100680	And then there was the whole...
2100680	2101680	Dude, I like Gil though.
2101680	2106080	The trans character was, was like, it was a little rough.
2106080	2111040	I think that they were, I wouldn't expect like a real trans person to use their dead
2111040	2112040	name.
2112040	2116720	But at the same time, I think it was just to bring out that this character does exist.
2116720	2120920	So maybe it was a poorly designed storytelling.
2120920	2124400	But at least they were trying to say that, yes, in the future, just like the present
2124400	2125400	trans people exist.
2125400	2127480	So, you know, that's...
2127480	2129200	The execution could have been better, but...
2129200	2130200	It's one of those...
2130200	2131200	Have you seen that picture?
2131200	2132200	I was pretty happy to see it.
2132200	2135560	Have you seen that picture on Tumblr of the star where it says, you tried, written in
2135560	2136560	Comic Sans?
2136560	2137560	Yeah.
2137560	2138560	That's kind of how I feel about it.
2138560	2139560	You tried.
2139560	2140560	Yeah.
2140560	2144720	So anyway, all that stuff aside, I want to check in a little bit on some of the pauses
2144720	2148560	because I got to say, I've spent a lot more time with the game this week and I, there
2148560	2152400	is a lot that I really, really, really do like about Andromeda.
2152400	2156800	Just like the story, I think what you really get into it, I think the story is really good.
2156800	2159480	I convinced a dude in Target to buy it.
2159480	2160480	Did you?
2160480	2161480	I pulled a Shane.
2161480	2162480	Yeah.
2162480	2163480	His powers were on low.
2163480	2168240	Well, Shane just beat the game today and obviously he won't tell me a lot because of spoilers,
2168240	2170960	but he said it will absolutely be his game of the year.
2170960	2174020	He doesn't understand the negativity going on at all.
2174020	2177160	He said some of the most gut wrenching decisions he's ever had to make in a BioWare game were
2177160	2178160	in this game.
2178600	2179840	And I've had that same moment.
2179840	2184440	There have definitely been decisions in this game where I'm like, I can't fucking choose.
2184440	2186440	This is too hard.
2186440	2187440	I don't know.
2187440	2190600	I may have looked at a couple of spoilers.
2190600	2196480	And what's tough about Andromeda this time is that, you know, in the Shepard Paragon
2196480	2200200	Renegade thing, it was a lot of decisions were very black and white.
2200200	2202700	You could be good guy or you could be bad guy basically.
2202700	2208100	But it was more like it wasn't bad guy so much as like being an asshole to get what
2208100	2210440	you want type of thing.
2210440	2212520	But in Andromeda, those lines are gone.
2212520	2216860	And so it's not always clear what the good guy option is.
2216860	2219820	And that's what makes the decisions a lot fucking harder.
2219820	2223320	I've been just aiming for whatever answers are professional when dealing with complete
2223320	2227580	strangers and then with dealing with the crew have been a little bit snarky.
2227580	2229620	Have you gone in to read your psychological profile?
2229620	2230620	No, not yet.
2230620	2231620	Oh, yeah.
2231620	2232620	You got to do that.
2232660	2235560	It's like a codex or journal when I don't forget which one it is and you actually select
2235560	2241880	yourself and Lexi actually is filling out as you go along a psychological profile on
2241880	2242880	you.
2242880	2243880	Cool.
2243880	2244880	And like the decisions you're making.
2244880	2245880	I adore Lexi.
2245880	2246880	Yeah.
2246880	2248340	So what are your what are your thoughts on the game?
2248340	2249340	What are your thoughts on Andromeda?
2249340	2253180	So far, I love Gil and I wish I could date him.
2253180	2257380	He makes me think of Alistair from Dragon Age.
2257380	2260420	So yeah, that's a that's a good comparison right there.
2260420	2266100	But Vetra is eternal space waifu although I am going for Jahl.
2266100	2267940	I can't believe Dark Sakura of all people.
2267940	2268940	No, seriously.
2268940	2273420	I saw like a Facebook post or something where she's like Vetra is my waifu forever heart
2273420	2275880	heart heart XOXO starry eyes.
2275880	2276880	I'm like Desu Desu?
2276880	2277880	What?
2277880	2278880	It wasn't like that.
2278880	2282020	I did a meme on Lol Effect.
2282020	2283020	Future space waifu.
2283020	2284020	I see.
2284020	2288020	Although I am going for Jahl this time around because I don't like the way that my writer
2288020	2289020	looks.
2289020	2291740	He gets the less than perfect one and Vetra gets the perfect one.
2291740	2292740	I love Jahl.
2292740	2293740	I love Jahl.
2293740	2294740	I love Jahl.
2294740	2295740	I love Jahl.
2295740	2296740	I love Jahl.
2296740	2297740	I love Jahl.
2297740	2298740	I love Jahl.
2298740	2299740	Oh yeah.
2299740	2300740	His voice purrs.
2300740	2301740	Yeah.
2301740	2302740	I there's like this big movement out there to like make Jahl.
2302740	2305780	Well, I mean, you can't make anyone bisexual, but it is a video game, but let the dudes
2305780	2310060	romance Jahl too, because to be fair, gay dudes have never got to bang an alien.
2310060	2313100	Like that's the one thing that the series has robbed us of is we haven't gotten to bang
2313100	2314100	an alien yet.
2314100	2318420	Although I don't think Asari count because Asari are technically monogendered.
2318820	2319820	True.
2319820	2324460	But this is also though, this is the first game that you get to bang an alien that's
2324460	2329540	not an Asari for, for a same sex pairing because you get Vetra.
2329540	2330540	Yep.
2330540	2333660	So, and um, one of the Angara as well, right?
2333660	2334660	No.
2334660	2335660	Oh, that's only heterosexual.
2335660	2336660	Yeah.
2336660	2339500	The, um, the Avalla who is the curator of the museum.
2339500	2340500	Okay.
2340500	2341500	She's the dude option.
2341500	2342500	Okay.
2342500	2343500	Okay.
2343500	2344500	Anyway though, back to the game itself.
2344500	2345500	I get motion sick.
2345740	2350660	It actually crashed my old graphics card, like hardcore.
2350660	2353260	I'm laughing because I know the punchline to this.
2353260	2355260	So I bought a new one.
2355260	2358020	More like, more like Dan bought a new one.
2358020	2363140	It's like, okay, I go into the room to go, you know, I fuss about my card, reboot the
2363140	2364140	game.
2364140	2365420	I go into the bedroom to kiss Dan.
2365420	2366420	Good night.
2366420	2369020	And then he's like, by the way, your card will be here tomorrow.
2369020	2370420	What?
2370420	2374020	So I got, we got a GTX 1060.
2374020	2375020	So good card.
2375540	2377180	Not the best, but pretty good.
2377180	2378180	That's really good.
2378180	2379180	Yeah.
2379180	2380180	That's what I have that.
2380180	2381180	Yeah.
2381180	2382180	That's good.
2382180	2385660	And I've been able to bump up all my settings and I actually did pop into wow for a little
2385660	2386660	bit too.
2386660	2387660	And it looks really nice.
2387660	2388660	So.
2388660	2389660	I have a somewhat similar story.
2389660	2393580	Just real quick aside is that, um, I actually wrote a tweet earlier this week where I said
2393580	2398460	something like, uh, I really want to hurry up and beat a mass effect Andromeda on PlayStation
2398460	2399460	four.
2399460	2402300	I kind of want to get it on PC though, so I can play multiplayer with my husband, but
2402300	2404660	I don't want to do it until I beat cause cause Alan's on PC.
2404700	2406780	I don't want to do it till I beat the PlayStation four version.
2406780	2414820	The next day you've received a gift on origin from Alan note, troll, lol, lol, lol, lol.
2414820	2418860	The one thing I'm mad about is cause I ordered it, I ordered mine through Amazon so I could
2418860	2423340	get the 20% off pre-order and they didn't have the deluxe one on there to pre-order.
2423340	2426160	So I'm going to have to buy it again when it goes on sale.
2426160	2433140	So I can get the other outfits and, uh, a pie Jack pet, AKA the monkey, then have all
2433140	2434140	the stuff.
2434140	2438260	So for those keeping track at home, I am now up to two copies of mass effect Andromeda
2438260	2441260	thanks to husbando.
2441260	2443140	So and the troll, lol, lol, lol.
2443140	2448580	So if now I just have to get a copy on Xbox one and I'll complete the trifecta for now.
2448580	2451940	So just, just for y'all keeping tabs at home, Rob's already up to two copies of mass effect
2451940	2452940	Andromeda.
2452940	2454620	Back to the actual review of the game.
2454620	2455620	Yes.
2455620	2456620	Okay.
2456620	2458580	And this is coming from me with some of my weird depth perception issues.
2458580	2464860	I do get motion sick on it whenever, um, I accelerate in the nomad, which by the way,
2464860	2467660	nomad much, much, much, much, much better than the Mako.
2467660	2468660	Oh yes.
2468660	2470660	Anything is better than the hammerhead.
2470660	2477960	Um, actually ATV mode for me is a lot easier than the non ATV mode because it's not moving
2477960	2485120	as fast, but boosting and jumping and normally jumping with the character too, because it
2485120	2487220	makes the screen jostle a little bit.
2487220	2488220	Yeah.
2488860	2489860	It, it will make me super motion sick.
2489860	2493360	So if I'm stuck in the nomad for a long time, I'll get motion sick.
2493360	2498920	So as for the animation issue, I, yeah, I did run into some of the dialogue problems
2498920	2499920	from the get-go.
2499920	2507360	Um, there's still a few glitchy things like one time, like it was in the, uh, the, the
2507360	2514020	cat ship part where you're talking the smuggler thing and the ship is turned upside down and
2514020	2517380	then it rotates and that made me so sick.
2517380	2525280	They got all, uh, mode seven on you from like super Nintendo that whole thing made
2525280	2527220	me so sick.
2527220	2531000	But there was this one thing where you're hearing the people talk on the speaker and
2531000	2534520	I swear my writer's head did the fucking owl thing.
2534520	2540920	She was looking right behind her head and I'm like, girl, so I screenshot that one cause
2540920	2542640	that's going to be a meme someday.
2542640	2547160	Um, but the story has been really good.
2547160	2552820	It had a kind of a slow buildup once you get into the meat of it, especially when you
2552820	2557020	deal with the Angara and I, and this is just a little thing for me.
2557020	2560420	This is actually why I liked fucking avatar of all things.
2560420	2565220	I like when you were presented with an alien race and they already have an established
2565220	2572080	culture, not just, Oh, here's this people and they kind of do this thing.
2572080	2579980	I like that their whole mythology has been built up, that their way of life has been
2579980	2585580	built up, that they are an established entity by the time you meet them instead of, Oh,
2585580	2586960	let's just put these people here.
2586960	2587960	Like in some games.
2587960	2588960	Yeah.
2588960	2590220	And Star Trek was always really good about this too.
2590220	2592020	Star Trek was always really good about that.
2592020	2596140	But I mean, that's the thing that really, I think is a mark of a good science fiction
2596140	2598500	if it's going to have aliens in it.
2598500	2601340	The aliens have to be established.
2601340	2605800	I really think that 10 hour preview was the worst thing EA could have done for the game.
2605800	2610320	I like looking back a little bit, especially about some of the tweets that came out about
2610320	2615680	it and so forth, because there is a slow buildup, not in the game, but when we say slow buildup,
2615680	2619920	I know the first thing everybody's going to say is like, well, Final Fantasy 13, it's
2619920	2620920	different.
2620920	2623980	When I say a slow buildup, I don't mean a slow buildup in the sense of the gameplay
2623980	2624980	or anything like that.
2624980	2630000	It's just the story takes a little bit of time before it really gets going, which if
2630020	2634280	you're coming off of a game like Mass Effect 3, where the first fucking thing that happens
2634280	2638640	in Mass Effect 3 is the town that you're in is getting shot the fuck up by Reapers, so
2638640	2639640	you hit the ground running.
2639640	2642820	Did they expect when you're playing 3 that you have already played the other series because
2642820	2644380	the first Mass Effect?
2644380	2645380	Right.
2645380	2647180	It was also a slow build up in a ways.
2647180	2648180	Yes it was.
2648180	2652580	It did jump you into the action right away, but you had no fucking clue what was going
2652580	2654560	on or what you were walking into.
2654560	2659300	And then you get introduced to the rest of the galaxy, you know, along with everything
2659300	2660300	else.
2660300	2665100	And I think that, I honestly think, and this goes back to another video I saw complaining
2665100	2671940	about how most, you see a lot of movies that are supposed to be like a not sequel, but
2671940	2675260	a re-imaging, even though they're in the series.
2675260	2679060	I kind of think that this one's trying to recapture the things that worked from the
2679060	2684960	first Mass Effect and took the gameplay aspects from the other Mass Effect games that did
2684960	2685960	work.
2685960	2691880	And so I think that it was a valiant effort and I truly do believe that it's paid off.
2691880	2696340	And as far as just visually, you know, now I am playing it as high as I can play it,
2696340	2699780	it's really, really, really fucking pretty.
2699780	2703800	It looks great on PC, now that I can say that.
2703800	2707800	Right now, well actually I left that planet, I went back to Eos.
2708340	2713780	I was on Havarl, which is one of the Angara planets.
2713780	2718240	And it's all this wildlife and overgrown.
2718240	2719240	That planet is gorgeous, yeah.
2719240	2720240	I've been there too.
2720240	2721840	That planet is gorgeous.
2721840	2729180	And the thing though is that it felt like walking through a heavily wooded area, especially
2729180	2734180	when you've got bugs that are hiding in the plants and, you know, things that can pop
2734180	2735180	just out of the trees.
2735400	2743040	If you've ever been in a dense forest or jungle situation or even in a swamp, which I have,
2743040	2746180	it's kind of like that though, where someone can just come right out of nowhere.
2746180	2748440	And so you get a little bit of suspense to it too.
2748440	2749440	You'll hear the sounds.
2749440	2753040	You always get an indicator of where enemies are showing up, but you still get those sounds
2753040	2755640	like what's shooting at me, where is it?
2755640	2759640	You know what else is really gorgeous is those vaults that you go into and especially again,
2759640	2765040	I don't want to spoiler, but the first escape sequence from a vault, that was a really
2765100	2766100	impressive sequence.
2766100	2767100	Oh my goodness.
2767100	2768100	Yes.
2768100	2772540	There's you see some of it in a trailer, so it's not really spoilery, but still to actually
2772540	2778540	play through that, like not only was it graphically, like really the demo, the vault was the demo
2778540	2779540	that they did before.
2779540	2780540	Oh yes, it was.
2780540	2781540	It was.
2781540	2783180	But did they do the escape sequence part of that?
2783180	2786340	No, they did the getting into it, but the whole area was the demo.
2786340	2787340	Yeah.
2787340	2788340	No, no.
2788340	2790640	I remember that the vault was that demo they did in the early YouTube, but the escape sequence
2790640	2791640	was right.
2791640	2795820	I think that was the moment or what the game really started to kick into.
2795820	2801060	Which is funny because that's where they cut it off at the end of the day in the time demo.
2801060	2808860	It's like seriously, so like for real, yeah, so, but yeah, absolute kudos to Mass Effect
2808860	2810860	Inquisition because that's what it feels like.
2810860	2811860	Yeah.
2811860	2819900	Now here's the other thing too is that every day I go and check Nexus mods because you
2819900	2824200	know it didn't take too long for them to have cracked the stuff for Dragon Age to do
2824200	2825200	those mods.
2825200	2826200	No, they didn't.
2826200	2827200	Nope.
2827200	2830120	And my biggest complaint is still the character creation.
2830120	2836860	They could have done exactly what Dragon Age did and have this fully tweakable customizable,
2836860	2841440	you know, where you pull X axis and Y axis to make things a certain size or to make it
2841440	2846680	move, but they had all these really terrible presets.
2846680	2849440	Even the guy presets were pretty terrible.
2849440	2855260	But they just like were dead set that if you don't play the default, you might be stuck
2855260	2860400	with a very, very homely looking character.
2860400	2863640	Can I ask a question about that?
2863640	2868360	And I want to get both of your opinions on this because there was some feedback based
2868360	2875500	on that character creation where some, again, this is just, you know, you take the internet
2875500	2876500	with a grain of salt.
2876500	2881360	But, you know, I found this particular argument a very striking argument.
2881360	2888860	The argument was that the reason for the character creation was so limited, if you will, was,
2888860	2897140	you know, because they said BioWare did that to prevent any sort of or minimize any sort
2897140	2904420	of backlash on any character that you can create that's too sexy, too pretty.
2904420	2909260	And I would love to know, I mean, I laughed when I saw that, but, you know, because, you
2909260	2914360	know, again, BioWare, you know, has been under this massive spotlight ever since the ending
2914360	2915360	of 3, as you mentioned earlier.
2915360	2916360	You get to cop out.
2916360	2917360	Yeah.
2917360	2918820	And I'll tell you why.
2918820	2922100	Because of Dad Writer.
2922100	2932060	He takes after the traits based on what physical traits, which of the basic presets that you
2932060	2940540	choose and modify, his ethnicity and eye color and some of his other physical traits
2940540	2943220	take directly from the choices that you pick in the character creator.
2943220	2946180	I think Dad Writer's the reason it's so limited.
2946180	2947820	That's my theory, too.
2947820	2953400	However, I think that maybe you should have the option of choosing an ethnicity preset
2953400	2957740	and then being able, instead of just having just the straight bar across, you can tweak
2957740	2959220	it in better ways.
2959220	2960220	And let's be real.
2960220	2963620	If you want to play writer with the biggest breasts in the galaxy, a modder is going to
2963620	2965400	bring that to you sooner rather than later.
2965400	2971300	So of course, if not already, ever was for Mass Effect 3 that made Shepard look a little
2971300	2976820	Lady Shepard look a little bit more buff because she's a fucking space marine.
2976820	2981940	Jamie's also one of those people where Lady Shepard is the only Shepard.
2981940	2982940	She was the first Shepard.
2982940	2983940	Remember that?
2983940	2985940	Dem Shep came first.
2985940	2986940	All right.
2986940	2987940	Anyway.
2987940	2988940	Awesome.
2988940	2994100	Quickly though, Gabe, since you've been playing as well, what are your thoughts on the game?
2994100	2998220	I agree with reference to the pacing of it.
2998220	3000540	And fortunately, I understood.
3000540	3006860	I came into this with the understanding of they're not going to relate at all to the
3006860	3011180	previous Mass Effect 3 games, even though they already have in a couple little tiny
3011180	3012180	ways, which is nice.
3012180	3013660	I mean, I think it's cool.
3013660	3020340	I too feel like there was a bit of a slow buildup with it.
3020340	3024180	But I think in this size of a game, you want to do that.
3024180	3026860	And I think it was still executed well.
3026860	3029480	I don't think it was executed perfectly.
3029480	3030620	Nothing ever necessarily is.
3030620	3035060	I mean, I think it could have been done a little bit better, but it's definitely not
3035060	3040900	the worst pacing issues I've ever seen when introducing a new universe.
3040900	3048780	As you mentioned, with that first vault, you first land on Eos and you start...
3048780	3054140	I already got that feeling like, oh my goodness, I remember how awesome it felt to explore
3054140	3055540	the planets.
3055540	3061460	And Eos just gave me that feeling, and graphically, even on Xbox One, it's just astounding.
3061460	3064060	So that's what I play it on.
3064060	3070340	But yeah, as you explored around and did your thing, very hard to stay focused on the amount
3070340	3073380	of crap that you have to do.
3073380	3075500	And that's something that turned me...
3075500	3081940	I don't want to say it turned me off, but it took me aback a little bit because I love
3081940	3086180	those games, Dragon Age, Inquisition, my favorite of all the Dragon Age games, all the three
3086180	3090460	Mass Effect's fantastic, but this new Mass Effect felt overwhelming.
3090460	3093060	It is what is slowing me down the most.
3093060	3095620	I shouldn't have that fucking game beat by now.
3095620	3097500	I feel like I have barely progressed.
3097500	3102940	And it's because all the worst elements of my gamer ADD kick in when it's like, I got
3102940	3106820	to go do this quest, but there's a shiny over here, but I got to scan this thing over there,
3106820	3111220	but there's a vault I got to do and a Sudoku puzzle.
3111220	3112900	It's totally Sudoku, isn't it?
3112900	3113900	It's totally Sudoku.
3113900	3118740	But I'll tell you what though, I have super loved all the distractions because you're
3118740	3121660	not necessarily timed on events in the game.
3121660	3122660	Thank goodness.
3122660	3127180	I didn't finish Eos, but I'm glad that I waited to finish Eos because when I came back, there
3127180	3128180	was more to do.
3128180	3129180	Yes.
3129180	3132900	And there was even, I had left it like a 75% viability.
3132900	3136900	Now I finished Vold, so I'd never have to fucking go there again.
3136900	3141900	That world has been- I hate Vold because it's cold.
3141900	3146380	Angry, angry, angry hoth is what- It's angry hoth.
3146380	3147380	That's exactly it.
3147380	3155260	And the mountain, I have driven my nomad over a mountain, over the mountain, that was kind
3155260	3156900	of fun.
3157620	3159620	Calamity Jamie makes her own fucking path.
3159620	3160620	Exactly.
3160620	3164980	Well, it's not like it wasn't the first Mass Effect where you were literally driving vertically.
3164980	3166780	Yeah, right.
3166780	3172260	So one problem is though, is that I have this series of memes on Mass Effecting.
3172260	3174460	It's called Shepherds Bad Driving.
3174460	3179260	And I'm starting a new one with- Well, you know, women drivers.
3179260	3180260	Hey.
3180260	3184220	She left the door wide fucking open.
3184220	3186220	Hit the shade button.
3186220	3187220	So anyway.
3187220	3190300	The following comments are not necessarily of the internet.
3190300	3194460	I'm going to be doing a sequel to that called Sarah's Nightmare Driving.
3194460	3201340	But it's hard to get the nomad in one of those weird positions like you could with the Mako.
3201340	3205500	So I'm having a really hard time for my blog.
3205500	3209380	But I did drive it completely over a mountain and that was pretty fun.
3209380	3212500	But the game- Climb every mountain.
3212500	3215460	The game overall is absolutely, I think it's an absolutely beautiful game and I'm looking
3215460	3218560	really forward to what comes next.
3218560	3222820	And I'm just happy to see some smartassery from the Krogan again.
3222820	3223820	That's great.
3223820	3224820	All right.
3224820	3228460	I got to move on past what Ziba and Chad is calling Orange Lounge Mass Effect Radio.
3228460	3233900	But hey, look, we've been waiting five years, five long years.
3233900	3234900	Jack is officially my new grandpa.
3234900	3237140	So you know, it's going to happen a little bit.
3237140	3238140	All right.
3238140	3239340	But let's talk about some other games as well.
3239340	3242020	We need to get into our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we've been playing
3242020	3245540	this week besides Mass Effect, if there have been any.
3245540	3246780	Dark Soccer, I'll check in with you first.
3246780	3248780	How was your gaming week?
3248780	3250540	Well, Mass Effect.
3250540	3255020	I also played a little bit of World of Warcraft, basically just long enough to download the
3255020	3258260	Tomb of Sargeras patch and see what my new card looks like.
3258260	3260780	It's pretty.
3260780	3265380	I have been- because I don't even know what it is, but I'm kind of getting back into some
3265380	3268460	of my cell phone gaming.
3268460	3273820	So I've been playing Bejeweled Stars, which is kind of stupid, but a fun little challenge.
3273820	3274820	Lots of Bust-A-Move.
3274820	3279020	Like I'm on Bust-A-Move marathon mode like you wouldn't believe.
3279020	3282700	My puzzle bobble, that's it.
3282700	3285540	And Pokemon Go, a bit here and there.
3285540	3289340	I evolved a whole bunch of stuff last week that was pretty fun.
3289340	3290340	Still doing Miitomo.
3290340	3294820	I don't really consider that a game, but it's kind of like fun dress up.
3294820	3302940	They just had these outfits that are all totally Tron-like, and it was pretty awesome.
3302940	3306660	And I guess really- oh yeah, Dan got Bomberman Zero.
3306660	3307660	Not Bomberman.
3307660	3308660	Blaster Master.
3308660	3310460	I'm sorry to hear it.
3310460	3311460	Oh, Blaster Master.
3311460	3312460	Blaster Master?
3312460	3313460	I said Bomberman.
3313460	3314460	Blaster Master.
3314460	3315460	He finished it.
3315460	3316460	The real ending.
3316460	3317460	Oh yeah?
3317460	3318460	He really likes it.
3318460	3319460	Yeah.
3319460	3321780	I think it's a- there was a smart time to put something like that out.
3321780	3324300	It doesn't really get lost in other Switch titles.
3324300	3327620	The only thing it's really competing against is Zelda, you know?
3327620	3328620	And Binding of Isaac.
3328620	3329620	Yeah, you know.
3329620	3332620	And so I think there's a lot of room for that game to really-
3332620	3333620	We got this on DS.
3333620	3334620	3DS.
3334620	3335620	Oh, okay.
3335620	3336620	Yeah.
3336620	3337620	And it was just fine.
3337620	3338980	He really, really seemed to enjoy it.
3338980	3342060	And then we did finish Breath of the Wild.
3342060	3347540	And then, you know, I am disappointed because I would have liked for there to be like kind
3347540	3351860	of a second quest, except your second quest is to rebuild Hyrule.
3351860	3353900	But it's still a great game.
3353900	3357180	The true ending, I admit I got a little sniffly.
3357180	3358620	It was really great.
3358620	3364060	And I think for all of us who have for years done the Link Zelda ship, it has finally paid
3364060	3365060	off.
3365060	3366940	Okay, spoiler alert.
3366940	3367940	I didn't say-
3367940	3368940	I haven't beaten- I haven't beaten yet.
3368940	3369940	That's all.
3369940	3370940	There's nothing-
3370940	3371940	I didn't-
3371940	3372940	All right, all right.
3372940	3375220	That didn't spoil anything if you've ever looked at any of the memories.
3375220	3377220	Zelda's a princess?
3377220	3378220	What?
3378220	3379220	Fair enough.
3379220	3380220	All right.
3380220	3381220	Anything else for game week?
3381220	3383660	Um, no.
3384100	3385380	Let's check in with our guests.
3385380	3389020	Bree, I didn't get to hear from you during that whole Mass Effect thing.
3389020	3390900	I'm assuming you kind of sat that one out.
3390900	3392580	But what video games have you been just playing?
3392580	3394460	Oh, I have opinions on Mass Effect.
3394460	3395460	Do you?
3395460	3396460	Oh, please.
3396460	3397460	The chat room's not gonna like it.
3397460	3398460	Go for it.
3398460	3399460	Put them on blast.
3399460	3407240	I have chosen to block any conversation in my timelines regarding Mass Effect Andromeda.
3407240	3411660	There are certain aspects that this casual gamer does not agree with that are incorporated
3411660	3412660	in that game.
3412660	3413660	Ooh, what though?
3413660	3414980	I want to know.
3414980	3416860	That's for another show, my friend.
3416860	3418980	Oh, that's a nasty tease.
3418980	3420700	That is a nasty, nasty tease.
3420700	3421700	All right.
3421700	3426900	The whole sexual relations part is something I do not agree with.
3426900	3427900	Okay.
3427900	3431780	But again, if you'd like to have me back when we're not promoting SAC India Arcade, I'd be
3431780	3434060	happy to discuss that with your people.
3434060	3435060	We're gonna talk about-
3435060	3437260	We'll talk about alien banging on another episode.
3437260	3438260	Yes.
3438260	3441020	And maybe you can help me understand that.
3441020	3442860	I'll give you the short version.
3442860	3446540	It's in movies for a reason.
3446540	3447540	That's the short version.
3447540	3448860	We can get into it another time.
3448860	3449860	Yes.
3449860	3450860	All right.
3450860	3455420	So I will say you do have the ability to continue the relationship without the banging for some
3455420	3456420	of them.
3456420	3461780	And if you want to be completely non, not do any of it, you don't have to romance anybody.
3461780	3462780	Exactly.
3462780	3467860	And so I'll preface my next appearance on your show with when does it become crossing
3467860	3472740	the line in relationships when you're engaging in that kind of romance or hinting at it with
3472740	3473740	another player?
3473740	3474740	Oh, interesting.
3474740	3475740	All right.
3475740	3476740	We'll leave it at that.
3476740	3477740	We'll leave it at that for now.
3477740	3479380	I think that could be a fascinating topic for-
3479380	3480780	The chat room's going to go nuts.
3480780	3481780	But on this topic-
3481780	3485140	No, they're going to be like, finally, someone's pushing their buttons on Mass Effect.
3485140	3491620	They're going to be- Bobby's getting out of pinata right now.
3491620	3497780	Now he's really going to show up expecting his fast pass to the event.
3497780	3501420	But I was so excited to talk about this topic because I think the last time I was on the
3501420	3507420	show was like two years ago and I was still very infantile in my game playing world.
3507420	3509260	But now are you sitting?
3509260	3510380	Is everybody sitting?
3510380	3513140	I have completed two games all by myself.
3513140	3514140	Good job.
3514140	3516380	Because I finally made time to do so.
3516380	3518620	I know this because you've been live streaming some of them too.
3518620	3519620	Yes.
3519620	3520620	And you've been hosting me.
3520620	3521620	So thank you.
3521620	3522620	I'm just happy to.
3522620	3523620	Happy to.
3523620	3525300	So I'm going to encompass my whole two years.
3525300	3526980	I finally beat Wolf Among Us.
3526980	3528700	I started it and played it.
3528700	3529700	I loved it.
3529700	3531300	I played Life is Strange.
3531300	3534540	I started Unravel.
3534540	3538540	And I started- I feel so childish on this.
3538540	3539540	Why?
3539540	3542300	Do you know how much good stuff I've heard about Life is Strange?
3542300	3545260	And I actually watched like, I don't remember what was going on.
3545260	3550740	I was up at like 2am on a Friday night a few weeks ago and like, I just was like, well,
3550740	3551740	what's going on on Twitch?
3551740	3555380	Like, I feel like I should have been high or something, but I don't do that.
3555380	3556460	I don't do any of that stuff.
3556460	3558900	But like, I felt like still it was like one of those nights.
3558900	3563220	And so at 2am on a Friday, I'm there on Twitch and like Bree's streaming Life is Strange.
3563220	3564940	She's got Insomnia going on too.
3564940	3566580	So I was actually watching for like a good hour.
3566580	3567580	Oh, that was you.
3567580	3568580	That was me.
3568580	3571420	How come you didn't say hi?
3571420	3572420	Usually I'm watching on PlayStation.
3572420	3573420	I don't have a keyboard.
3573420	3575580	I can, I can kind of do it.
3575580	3576580	That's fine.
3576580	3579940	But yeah, I grew so attached to those characters and I was going through some stuff at the
3579940	3581780	time I was playing that game.
3581780	3586180	And now that it's over, I finally understand why people played that game multiple times
3586220	3588860	because there's so many different ways you could go about it.
3588860	3592380	So I made some new friends when I was streaming online with that.
3592380	3595100	And that was cool because there were some parts where I got stuck.
3595100	3599060	But when I first started that game in the fall, I know everybody, please don't give
3599060	3600860	me grief in the chat room.
3600860	3603220	It took me like nine months to finish that game.
3603220	3604380	They can fight me.
3604380	3607100	Do you know how long it takes me to finish any game?
3607100	3612100	But there was some heavy shit in that game that my heart just was not ready to address
3612100	3613100	at that point.
3613140	3617620	Yeah, I've heard, I've heard Life is Strange is, is really resonates with people.
3617620	3618620	Yeah.
3618620	3621060	So, but I loved it and I'm trying to keep it light.
3621060	3625060	I downloaded Dear Esther on my Xbox.
3625060	3627180	Why are indie titles so serious?
3627180	3628180	Some of them.
3628180	3629180	I just picked that up for Mac.
3629180	3630180	Yeah.
3630180	3633100	Dear Esther is really, cause they just did the remaster just came out.
3633100	3635820	If you do enjoy Dear Esther, you must play.
3635820	3636820	Everybody's gone to the rapture.
3636820	3637820	Oh, okay.
3637820	3642940	You, oh, I, that game like still resonates with me to this day and it doesn't, it doesn't
3642940	3646420	affect everybody the same way, but there's something about that game that is just so
3646420	3648300	fucking beautiful.
3648300	3649580	Like I can't, like I can't handle it.
3649580	3653880	Like, and even playing Dear Esther, I was like, this isn't rapture.
3653880	3657020	This isn't like, it's good, but it's not rapture.
3657020	3659620	So it's, it's almost like they're going to get crushed by their own success.
3659620	3662580	But that, that you, you definitely need to try.
3662580	3664420	Everybody's gone to the rapture is so good.
3664420	3665420	I will look into that.
3665420	3666420	Thank you.
3666420	3667420	You're welcome.
3667420	3668420	Give me another two years.
3668420	3669420	You got it.
3669420	3670420	Take your time.
3670420	3671420	Take your time.
3671420	3672420	Don't let anybody rush you.
3672900	3676700	The dog network.com free kill zero says, Oh, I finished unravel myself last week.
3676700	3678820	That game had some major feels.
3678820	3683780	So just warning unravel may not be the emotional break you were hoping for.
3683780	3685060	It's the controls.
3685060	3689260	I take too much time away from that game that by the time I get back to it, I forget how
3689260	3692340	to swing and throw the rope and do that whole bit, but it's beautiful.
3692340	3693340	I love it.
3693340	3694340	Damn that music though.
3694340	3697200	Cause some of the pieces like that's what keeps drawing me back.
3697200	3701100	It's difficult for me, but that music, the music and rapture is what will do it.
3701780	3702780	Oh my God.
3702780	3703780	Oh my God.
3703780	3704780	I'm like it.
3704780	3705780	I'm getting chills.
3705780	3706780	Just thinking about it.
3706780	3707780	Um, ice, ice, pee, ICP.
3707780	3712980	I don't know if, I don't know if it's ICP or ice pee in the chat room with the ICP clearly
3712980	3714180	a reference to the insane clown.
3714180	3715180	Of course.
3715180	3716180	Just kidding.
3716180	3722500	But anyway, ICP and chat says, if you like walking simulators, uh, I would suggest firewatch
3722500	3723660	love that.
3723660	3725300	I really enjoyed firewatch as well.
3725300	3726300	Beat that game in one night.
3726300	3727300	It went on sale.
3727300	3728560	Beat that game in one night.
3728560	3729560	That's another one I'd recommend.
3729800	3731880	That should only take you a few hours to get through.
3731880	3737800	Even, even if you look behind every nook and cranny, it's like maybe five hours tops tops.
3737800	3740400	So that was really good too.
3740400	3744320	Um, uh, I don't, I don't like the brand walking simulators.
3744320	3746320	I'm just, that's not, no, no shade.
3746320	3748580	I'm not going to bring out the shade button for the chatter because I realized that's
3748580	3751320	kind of like what the internet has adopted as kind of the term.
3751320	3754520	I'm not a fan of that term because I feel like that term is used sometimes to belittle
3754520	3758640	those types of games because I just consider them more.
3758640	3761980	They are very heavily narrative based games.
3761980	3765920	They're very heavily on the story as opposed to the action.
3765920	3769880	I feel, I feel it's a, it's a true definition of visual narrative.
3769880	3773300	It's what, it's an interactive, it's an interactive visual narrative.
3773300	3774300	It's what it is.
3774300	3779760	You are, you are in the story and you are, you are following the story that, that, that
3779760	3784920	the book, if you will, has presented instead of you finding out when you turn the page,
3784920	3787080	you're going to find out when you turn the corner.
3787080	3790240	And it's going to, and it, you know, and it's going to reveal all these little things.
3790240	3795720	But yeah, I, I, I, as an indie developer, you know, like if we're, if we're going to,
3795720	3799720	you know, if we're going to trounce made up genres and stuff like that, Metroidvania needs
3799720	3801680	to stop, but I won't even go there.
3801680	3805440	But like, you know, but yeah, the walking simulator thing, it, it shouldn't, it shouldn't
3805440	3808800	demeanor or, you know, devalue, you know.
3808800	3809800	Yeah.
3809800	3811600	I'm not saying it to like shake my finger.
3811600	3812600	Don't do that.
3812600	3818280	I'm just saying, I'm like, I just, I feel like those games deserve a label that, you
3818280	3823080	know, cause, cause honestly it's quickly becoming one of my favorite genre of games and, you
3823080	3824080	know, okay.
3824080	3826640	Is it because I'm old and I can't do action as much anymore?
3826640	3832360	I don't know, but I just like, I get more out of those types of games.
3832360	3835800	Like I, especially for somebody with my, my short attention span type of thing.
3835800	3838860	And obviously Brie is a victim of this too, cause she's, she mentioned this too, it takes
3838860	3840400	her a while to get through a game.
3840400	3845520	Like these like four hour interactive adventures are perfect.
3845520	3846520	You know what I mean?
3846520	3847520	Like they're just like perfect stories.
3847520	3848520	I don't know for me.
3848520	3850000	That's how I feel anyway.
3850000	3855120	I blame it on sack indie arcade for right now, but we'll sit in front of the TV.
3855120	3859520	You clearly have every right to blame event planning for why you don't play video games.
3859520	3862980	Can I, I'm sorry, Brie, you were going to say, I want to piggyback off of Jamie though.
3862980	3867560	I have started Pokemon go again because it's beautiful outside and I need to get my butt
3867560	3868560	walking.
3868560	3871400	I haven't gone to any gyms or battles yet.
3871400	3872840	I don't know how to do that.
3872840	3874280	So I haven't done any either.
3874280	3876040	Can we do it together?
3876040	3880980	You don't, you don't, you also don't have like, I think part of the beauty of that game,
3880980	3882700	although that game has its flaws for sure.
3882700	3885600	But part of the beauty of that game is that you don't have to do that at all.
3885600	3889400	If you don't want, like there's tons of rewards to get from the game without ever touching
3889400	3892720	that stuff, but you can, you can do it if you want.
3892720	3895280	And it's, you do get other rewards for doing it.
3895280	3900740	You do get the premium in game currency a little bit, you get that from doing the gyms,
3900740	3902720	but I kind of think you can get a rich experience without it.
3902720	3906440	Well, that's good to know that because here I am trying to like build up my Pokemon for
3906440	3908060	something, but it's all for me.
3908060	3912800	For me playing games with people is always more fun in real life, not necessarily online.
3912800	3913800	Absolutely.
3913800	3914800	Absolutely.
3914800	3917800	Uh, JD wanted to back up a minute here and chat over at live.vognetwork.com saying I
3917800	3920800	don't actually know what a walking simulator is.
3920800	3924880	No, that's a fair question because it's kind of a newer genre of game.
3924880	3929120	I would say the first big one, well, Dear Esther was probably actually the first big
3929120	3935600	one, but Gone Home was probably the first really successful mainstream big one.
3935600	3940120	And you may remember with Gone Home, Gone Home got shit from a lot of people because
3940120	3943600	a lot of people were like, where's the game though?
3943600	3947480	Like you're walking through this scary house and you think you, you think at some point
3947480	3950080	like a ghost is going to jump out and chop off your head.
3950080	3956240	And spoiler alert, that never happens because the game is actually not scare about scary
3956240	3957240	things at all.
3957240	3958240	Right?
3958240	3959240	Absolutely.
3959240	3961920	That game is, is really a masterpiece in a different way of like throwing like this curve
3961920	3965340	ball at you that you think it's going to be this, this scary game.
3965340	3970560	And then you find out it's actually like a different type of tragedy that's going on.
3970560	3973560	That's very, in some ways it's kind of relatable.
3973560	3978020	I mean, you know, I realized it's not an experience everybody's gone through, but I think that
3978020	3979180	whole like teenage angst.
3979180	3981700	I think everybody's felt teenage angst at some point.
3981700	3984360	And there's a lot of that that you explore through the eyes of the character's sister
3984360	3985360	in Gone Home.
3985360	3989860	So anyway, I'm digressing a little bit, but my point is, is that they are more the games
3989860	3997580	that are driven by the story and you are just this participant watching, not necessarily
3997580	4001360	participating as if it were an action game or something.
4001360	4003020	You're more of an observer.
4003020	4004720	That's especially the case in Rapture.
4004720	4007560	You are definitely an observer in that game.
4008540	4012860	Even games with simple puzzle elements like Firewatch and things, you're still like just
4012860	4016900	an observer who has to do things to see the whole picture.
4016900	4017900	So I don't know.
4017900	4018900	Absolutely.
4018900	4025000	I think another game that got that, you know, that caught some heat, even though I think
4025000	4029420	the good obviously overpowered the bad was Journey, even though, you know, Journey, there
4029420	4035500	are certain elements of Journey, you know, where it feels action-y, you don't necessarily
4035500	4039840	do anything, but Journey caught a lot of heat for the same thing.
4039840	4043480	I just paid $20 for a two hour game.
4043480	4044480	Why?
4044480	4046900	That's because it's the best damn two hours of your life.
4046900	4047900	Damn straight.
4047900	4048900	Damn straight.
4048900	4052520	But that, Journey is an interesting example of something that kind of, because obviously
4052520	4054080	genres blend.
4054080	4059720	So Journey is kind of a blend of that narrative mixed with a Mario 64 type of game.
4059720	4060720	Yeah, it is.
4060720	4061720	It absolutely is.
4061720	4067340	And, you know, with a lot more limitations, you know, all you have is limited jumps and
4067340	4068340	not much else.
4068340	4070860	Limited jumps and floats, so.
4070860	4074980	Free Kill Zero says, I haven't played Gone Home, but isn't that Dragon Cancer in a similar
4074980	4075980	vein?
4075980	4076980	Oh.
4076980	4077980	Yeah.
4077980	4082060	I have not played that one start to finish yet because I keep waiting for that day where,
4082060	4087540	like, do I have a 24 hour period where I can cry nonstop and not leave the house?
4087540	4088540	No, I'm serious.
4088540	4089540	I don't even know.
4089540	4095520	Just everything I know about preparing me for this game is that, like, just, it's like
4095520	4100880	that, I don't know for you guys, but for me, it's like, if Rob breaks out the Tori Amos
4100880	4105680	CDs, like, it's a day, you know?
4105680	4108680	That says a lot about how the day is going to go.
4108680	4110240	Can I ask a question about that?
4110240	4111240	Sure.
4111240	4112240	I would love your thought.
4112240	4115140	Even your, I don't know how familiar you are with that Dragon Cancer game.
4115140	4119240	The creator of the game, for those who may not know what that game is about, essentially
4119240	4125120	the developer created this game surrounding his son, and, you know, the son had passed
4125120	4130160	and so on and so forth, and this game was a very striking game, and when the developer
4130160	4135200	got awarded at the game awards, whatever it was called, I can't remember the name of it.
4135200	4138560	Is that the big hub-a-loo that Jeff Keighley does?
4138560	4139560	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4139560	4140560	The game awards.
4140560	4141560	Yeah, the game awards or whatever.
4141980	4146420	So, the developer caught a lot of heat because, you know, obviously the controversy was, you're
4146420	4154900	making money off the illness and death of your son, so, you know, so I, yeah, you know,
4154900	4155900	so...
4155900	4158420	Rob is currently looking at his brain.
4158420	4167980	So, yeah, you know, I mean, I know for me, there are games for me that I know I want
4167980	4173140	to make to talk about my experiences with my family, because, you know, eventually they're
4173140	4177040	going to go, they're going to go, and there's going to be things that I want to remember
4177040	4181040	them by, you know, in different ways, but what are your thoughts, you know, what are
4181040	4182040	your thoughts on that?
4182040	4183040	This is a great question.
4183040	4185920	I'm going to put it as simply as I can.
4185920	4192120	If you go into any museum and see paintings of the Civil War or paintings of, you know,
4192120	4197920	tragedies that have happened in culture, are those people profiting off of human tragedies?
4197920	4205820	No, because art is a spontaneous expression of culture, and that is what that dragon cancer
4205820	4206820	is.
4206820	4211220	It is an expression of what this person was going through, but guess what?
4211220	4217460	Expressions don't pay the fucking rent, so, yes, the guy gets to sell this because other
4217460	4226260	people, you know, you get to, other people get to have this experience that many people
4226260	4231800	are not going to, fortunately, I suppose, get to experience, you know what I mean by
4231800	4232800	that?
4232800	4233800	Absolutely.
4233800	4236800	So, yes, it's fine for him to charge money for it.
4236800	4239000	If you don't like it, don't fucking pay it.
4239000	4244200	Go on to the next, download the next CD on your list or whatever you're going to steal
4244200	4248840	for free, and then, you know, well, that's what it is, right?
4248840	4253500	I don't fucking pay for art and the hippies, all those Burning Man hippies, I don't pay
4253500	4254500	for art.
4255320	4256320	Come on.
4256320	4257320	I hear that.
4257320	4258320	I hear that.
4258320	4259320	Okay.
4259320	4260320	Art, don't pay the rent.
4260320	4261320	Mm-hmm.
4261320	4262320	That's my thought.
4262320	4263320	Fascinating.
4263320	4264320	Okay.
4264320	4265320	All right.
4265320	4269720	Let's see, going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Bobby Blackwell reminded me Journey played
4269720	4270880	live is awesome.
4270880	4275200	He's not talking about the band, but at MAGFest, I mean, that journey is cool too, but back
4275200	4276200	to the game.
4276200	4279400	MAGFest, they did the Austin Wintory conducting live.
4279400	4283920	That was my first MAGFest, and I swear to God, that's what made a fan, a MAGFest fan
4283940	4285460	out of me, was going to that.
4285460	4286460	It was a lot of fun.
4286460	4287460	Yeah.
4287460	4288460	Yeah.
4288460	4289460	Yeah.
4289460	4293960	That was, I saw bits and pieces of that, and it nearly brought me to tears, just because,
4293960	4297720	you know, like, just the impact that that game itself has had on me, and just to hear,
4297720	4299580	just to see that had happened.
4299580	4306240	There is something about a crowd of 4,000 people or however many people were there when,
4306240	4312320	to everyone's surprise, another player showed up in Journey, and everybody assumed that
4312320	4316100	because this was, like, it was going to be a controlled environment, and that they were
4316100	4321240	just going to be running through the game, and, okay, if you haven't experienced Journey
4321240	4323680	by now, I guess I can tell you the big twist.
4323680	4327340	In my opinion, this was a twist, and this was always better if you didn't know about
4327340	4330820	this going into the game, but the reality is, it's been years, I need to get this off
4330820	4331820	my chest now.
4331820	4336460	The big twist in the game is that it's secretly a multiplayer game, is that you don't, you
4336460	4340020	may be going through this experience, and all of a sudden, somebody who looks like you,
4340020	4343800	and everything just like you shows up, and at first you're like, is this an NPC?
4343800	4347960	But you don't really know, because you can't talk to them, you're not connected on voice
4347960	4348960	chat or anything like that.
4348960	4353040	All you can do is you can hit your button to go, and, like, make these little musical
4353040	4355040	tones and, like, chirp at them, right?
4355040	4361480	So, and then that's how you, and that's the magic of the game, is those, how you experience
4361480	4366920	your journey with another person, or did you just run on ahead and leave that guy in the
4366920	4369840	dust, literally, or what, it's how you choose to do that.
4369840	4376920	So anyway, my point is, there was something really magical about reliving that in a crowd
4376920	4380580	of 4,000 people, when you're going through this, and all of a sudden, another person
4380580	4381580	showed up.
4381580	4387380	And everybody was like, oh, shit, like, they're online, and there's another person here.
4387380	4390060	And like, I remember even when they beat the game, and it showed the name of it, because
4390060	4391380	it shows these people that you went on a game with.
4391380	4393380	Oh, I lost my mind when I saw it.
4393380	4398180	The whole audience started cheering, people were going on Twitter, who is this person?
4398200	4400680	Do you know that you just played in front of MAGFest?
4400680	4402680	I don't think they ever found who it was.
4402680	4403680	Yeah.
4403680	4407160	And that was, yeah, oh, God.
4407160	4411320	I know, it was, like, I can't explain it.
4411320	4417160	I can't put words on a moment like that, like, as just a gaming fan, like, that moment when
4417160	4419160	it's like, I'm not alone.
4419160	4420160	Right.
4420160	4422160	Oh, Barf, just thinking about it, it's so powerful.
4422160	4424160	I know, yeah, no, seriously, I'm getting.
4424160	4425160	Yeah.
4426140	4429140	I actually streamed, I recently streamed that game for their five-year anniversary.
4429140	4433500	They had a five-year anniversary earlier in March, and I totally streamed it on Twitch
4433500	4438140	that day to celebrate that five-year, and it still brought me to tears at the end.
4438140	4444140	I had to, like, mute my mic, because I was like, so, yeah, I was done.
4444140	4449480	But let me, now, back to those Twitter egg icons, or excuse me, what are the icons now?
4449480	4450480	The oval people?
4450480	4452660	Or whatever the fuck they are on Twitter now?
4452660	4453660	Like, okay.
4453660	4454660	Creepy things?
4455160	4460240	People now that are tweeting that that dragon cancer guy shouldn't be making any money or
4460240	4461240	whatever.
4461240	4463240	Did you pay money for Journey?
4463240	4464240	Yeah.
4464240	4467240	Art, don't pay the fucking rent.
4467240	4469240	Expressions, don't pay the rent.
4469240	4471240	Money pays the rent.
4471240	4472240	Yep.
4472240	4476240	And that's the level of ignorance we as developers have to deal with when we make anything, you
4476240	4484240	know, it's like, I could have played a game like this for free, it had so much more.
4484820	4490360	I mean, and we talked about this on previous shows, it's like, what justifies the price
4490360	4491900	of an indie game?
4491900	4498620	What makes it quality over just, you know, a waste of steam credits or whatever the hell?
4498620	4504540	And yeah, I mean, it's unfortunate, but you're absolutely right, you know, art doesn't.
4504540	4505540	It doesn't.
4505540	4509880	It gives us an opportunity to share who we are, but we still got to keep the roof over
4509880	4510880	our heads.
4510880	4511880	Yeah.
4511880	4512880	Yeah.
4513020	4515960	Sometimes it's just, everybody's going to be a fan of something and everything's going
4515960	4517260	to have its haters.
4517260	4524080	You know, somewhere out there, there is somebody who loves Bomberman Zero Mission on Xbox 360.
4524080	4525480	It's got its fan club.
4525480	4527580	It's small.
4527580	4532900	It may not even be in this country, who knows, but it's got its fans somewhere and more power
4532900	4533900	to them.
4533900	4537200	Probably the same people who still play Phantasy Star Online on the 360.
4537200	4538200	Excuse you.
4538200	4540200	You better watch where you're fucking going.
4540200	4541200	Phantasy Star Online is great.
4541200	4542200	Watch.
4542200	4546280	You better stay in your fucking lane.
4546280	4549400	That's why I started kind of turning left as I said that, because I already knew what
4549400	4550400	was about to happen.
4550400	4551400	That was fun.
4551400	4552400	Thank you.
4552400	4555440	So I don't mind coming back on the show next year to promote indie arcade.
4555440	4556440	Without me?
4556440	4557440	By yourself?
4557440	4558440	Yeah.
4558440	4559440	That'd be fantastic.
4559440	4560440	Thank you.
4560440	4561440	But you'll replace him in no time.
4561440	4562440	I'm just kidding.
4562440	4563440	I'm kidding.
4563440	4564440	I'm kidding.
4564440	4565440	I'm kidding.
4565440	4566440	Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
4566440	4567440	What?
4567440	4568440	There we go.
4568440	4569440	There we go.
4569440	4570440	All right.
4570680	4571680	So this is from your gaming week, Bree.
4571680	4574680	Thank you for sharing.
4574680	4579000	We spent 30 minutes with our analysis of walking simulators and all that.
4579000	4580560	No, but it's great.
4580560	4582360	Gabe, quickly, your gaming week.
4582360	4583360	Of course.
4583360	4584360	What would you play?
4584360	4592520	Between Mass Effect Andromeda, Fallout Shelter on Xbox One, super addictive free game.
4592520	4593520	I spent a couple.
4593520	4598480	I decided to actually spend a couple dollars on that game because fantastic, fantastic
4598480	4601280	free app game, I should say.
4601280	4607840	Although it's not the most user friendly experience, but it's still a really, really good game.
4607840	4612160	So between that and what else was I messing with?
4612160	4616320	I kind of started dabbling again in Resident Evil 7.
4616320	4617760	I haven't beat that game yet.
4617760	4618760	I've just been.
4618760	4619760	It's just one of those.
4619760	4621320	I can only play that game in short spurts.
4621320	4625840	But there was one other game that I've been messing with.
4626200	4631720	I've been replaying Rayman Origins as well since it became Xbox One compatible.
4631720	4633960	I never completed Origins.
4633960	4636560	I beat Legends, but I never completed Origins.
4636560	4639000	So I'm trying to finally beat that game.
4639000	4641200	So I'm close to it now.
4641200	4647320	I also dabbled in Halo Wars 2 a little bit, but yeah, Halo Wars 2 came out at the wrong
4647320	4651920	time because Andromeda came out and I messed around with Breath of the Wild a little bit
4651920	4653480	on the Wii U.
4653480	4654480	Gorgeous game.
4654800	4657880	I don't care too much about the frame rate thing, but again, that's just one of those
4657880	4664640	games where I can only play one huge exploration type game at a time and Andromeda was going
4664640	4665640	to be it for me.
4665640	4666640	So, yeah.
4666640	4670760	So that's what I've been playing and the next EDF game is coming out later this year.
4670760	4672240	So yeah.
4672240	4675720	So you and Loki can bro out over that.
4675720	4678120	I don't get into those games the same way you guys do.
4678120	4679480	No, that's okay.
4679480	4680480	That's all right.
4680480	4684960	I'm happy that you never played it.
4684960	4688800	Maybe somebody in the chat room will relate or even Brie, because I've complained about
4688800	4693920	it to her, the soldier will now be able to run because they finally added a run button
4693920	4699040	for the soldier instead of me rolling, rolling constantly to speed forward.
4699040	4700040	You know, yeah.
4700040	4704320	So now they were genius enough to add a friggin' run button.
4704320	4709440	It's like, okay, I get the wing diver can fly, but still make the dude run.
4709440	4710440	Anyway.
4710440	4711440	So I'm happy about that stuff.
4711440	4712440	That's what I've been dabbling with.
4712440	4713440	Quality of life.
4713440	4714440	Things are huge.
4714440	4715440	Yeah.
4715440	4716440	Cool.
4716440	4717440	Yeah.
4717440	4718440	All right.
4718440	4719440	My gaming week.
4719440	4720720	So I've been obviously playing a lot of Mass Effect Andromeda.
4720720	4723640	That's still been kind of continuing to dominate my week still.
4723640	4729760	I am enjoying it probably even more so now than a week ago.
4729760	4733760	Been trying to, it's hard to juggle multiplayer and single player.
4733760	4737360	That's my biggest downfall right now is that multiplayer is still really fun for me.
4737360	4738640	I'm glad we got to do that stream.
4738640	4741240	We did a live stream after the show last week where I played some multiplayer.
4741240	4743200	Sadly, the matchmaking was busted.
4743200	4746960	So it was like, let's see how long a dungeon Buster was a good sport and he played with
4746960	4750520	me and it was just the two of us and we, we were able to survive a couple of waves on
4750520	4754280	our own, but you really need four people because it's balanced for people.
4754280	4758460	But when I do get the matches of four people, a multiplayer is a lot of fun and Lord knows
4758460	4761440	I spent a ton of time in multiplayer, Mass Effect three.
4761440	4764800	That's the reason why I bought the game so many times.
4764800	4768200	So yeah, well now that I'm on PC, I can play.
4768200	4770000	I got to, I got to confess about that actually.
4770000	4776080	The Mass Effect three multiplayer, I'll probably, I'll probably get some good laughs at my cost
4776080	4783960	for this, but for the longest time, up until my friend back home in Jersey, Tino, he tells
4783960	4789720	me, I thought Mass Effect the multiplayer part was competitive for the longest time.
4789720	4791280	I, I, well that's the thing.
4791280	4796760	It took me, it took me two years after the game came out for him and I to have a talk
4796760	4797760	about it.
4797800	4799560	And he's like, Oh, well you got to get into the multiplayer thing.
4799560	4802000	And I'm like, yeah, but I'm not a competitive person.
4802000	4803000	I do co-op.
4803000	4807280	And then he, there was this dead silence and he's, he's typing all these dots on the screen
4807280	4809680	and I'm like, Oh my God, what did I just say?
4809680	4811080	And then he just railed me.
4811080	4813320	He's like, Gabriel, the whole thing is co-op.
4813320	4815160	I'm like, what are you talking about?
4815160	4816900	He's like, you only play the computer.
4816900	4822240	And I'm telling you that night I hopped right on that and I felt like such a, I felt like
4822240	4823240	such a dumb ass.
4823240	4825840	I was like, Oh my God, I could have been playing this forever.
4825840	4826840	Yes.
4827280	4833480	It blows my mind how much multiplayer and mass effect is ignored when it's such a, a
4833480	4837300	like positive trait that the game has going for it.
4837300	4842680	The fact that it exists in conjunction with the single player campaign, like it really
4842680	4844560	blows my mind how much multiplayer gets ignored.
4844560	4847880	I even went on Twitch the other night because I'm like, Oh, I want to see, no, I think it
4847880	4849400	was after I was done streaming.
4849400	4852460	I was like, I want to see who else streams multiplayer and what they do.
4852460	4856160	And there was probably like maybe 15, 20 different channels streaming mass effect Andromeda.
4856160	4859720	None of them doing multiplayer, none of them.
4859720	4863060	And in a lot of the reviews of the game, multiplayer rarely got touched on.
4863060	4867980	Now I understand the embargo I think was up like a day after the online servers went live.
4867980	4871760	So people probably didn't have the chance to really test it, but, and I get it.
4871760	4875600	Like some people don't want to touch multiplayer at all because some people are like, Ooh,
4875600	4876600	the competitive stuff.
4876600	4878720	It's like, kind of like what you were saying, like the competitive stuff, but, and people
4878720	4883520	don't even know, like, no, it's, it's all co-op and it actually creates a much better
4883520	4885920	environment than most multiplayer things.
4885920	4890300	And that's what pleased me with it, Mass Effect 3, and eventually I'll play Andromeda for
4890300	4894060	the co-op, but yeah, I want to go through the story first.
4894060	4895700	It's probably, it's not a bad thing to do.
4895700	4898540	I just enjoyed it in, in three so much I had to.
4898540	4899540	So, okay.
4899540	4901720	I've been playing Mass Effect Andromeda, but I've been playing some other games too.
4901720	4907440	I've been playing Clicker Heroes because I hate my life and I just, it's so addicting
4907440	4908440	you guys.
4908440	4909440	It's so addicting.
4909440	4914000	And I have to get more trophies on PlayStation 4, those fucking trophies.
4914000	4915000	But then, okay.
4915000	4919700	We haven't talked a lot about April Fool's jokes tonight, but I got to say Sega fucking
4919700	4923400	won because they put out on Steam 8-bit Bayonetta.
4923400	4924400	Yes!
4924400	4925400	I saw that!
4925400	4926400	Oh my goodness.
4926400	4927400	Okay.
4927400	4930400	It's, it's like temper your expectations.
4930400	4931920	It's not like a full on platform or anything.
4931920	4932920	It's a silly thing.
4932920	4934400	Like it could have been a mobile game, people.
4934400	4938020	Like literally all it is, like you have two buttons, like jump and shoot.
4938020	4940580	And so it's like, you can just stay in one place and shoot the things or you can jump
4940580	4941760	and hit the other thing.
4941760	4942760	It's silly.
4942760	4949760	The fact that it exists is great because that means Sega's still thinking about Bayonetta
4949760	4953920	and they put it on PC on Steam.
4953920	4958120	Could this be a sign that they might be doing Bayo or Bayo 2 on Steam at some point?
4958120	4960200	I, Oh God, I hope so.
4960200	4966360	Now the question of course is Bayo 2 was heavily, you know, heavily partnered by Nintendo.
4966360	4969780	So where, you know, where it was only, you know, exclusive only with Nintendo.
4969780	4974180	So how that, we'll see how that plays out, but you know, yeah.
4974180	4978380	Well, I imagine that agreement's gotta be up at some point, but seriously, between all
4978380	4985620	the Mario Kart 8 and Splatoon sequel and, and rumors of, of a Smash Brothers and all
4985620	4989740	this stuff, like if any Wii U game deserves a second fucking chance, it's Bayo 2.
4989740	4990740	Oh, no kidding.
4990740	4992220	Like put it on the Switch.
4992220	4993220	Put it on the Switch.
4993220	4994220	Bayo 2 was...
4994220	4996300	Hashtag put it on the Switch.
4996300	4997300	Get switched.
4997300	4998700	Hashtag get switched.
4998700	5001700	So yeah, Bayonetta 2.
5001700	5002700	Absolutely astounding game.
5002700	5003700	Absolutely.
5003700	5009300	I loved part one, but my God, part two just went in a direction I, I didn't think could
5009300	5010300	be topped with part one.
5010300	5013140	It's seriously like the best game that the least number of people have played.
5013140	5014140	Probably.
5014140	5015140	Yeah, absolutely.
5015140	5016140	No, it's, it's so sad.
5016140	5017140	You're right.
5017140	5018140	You're right.
5018140	5021660	And here I thought that, um, uh, Sinbad got it.
5021660	5022660	Okay.
5022660	5024580	Sinbad did do really good on April Fool's day.
5024580	5026100	The Shazam thing was pretty funny.
5026620	5032220	You know, talk about just, just make a, make a lemonade, lemonade out of lemons, right?
5032220	5037100	Or in, in, in his case, Sinbad's case, how to make some fucking money off of it.
5037100	5040460	Do you realize, do you realize he just turned a joke into money?
5040460	5042380	He turned the internet urban legit.
5042380	5043860	He made money off of it.
5043860	5048540	What can be more American than that?
5048540	5052340	But somebody's going to yell at the guy who made that dragon cancer.
5052340	5057060	Meanwhile, Sinbad's making April Fool's jokes with ads on it and yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
5057060	5061060	And they made it, but yeah, massive hypocrisy, but that's why we love this.
5061060	5062060	Shut up internet.
5062060	5063060	All right.
5063060	5066460	You don't, you're drunk, log off.
5066460	5069140	Drunk on power.
5069140	5072420	And then I wanted to, I need to give this game a shout out too, because this is a, actually
5072420	5075620	we're going to have these guys on the show in a couple of weeks, an indie developer.
5075620	5079660	So get this, uh, Captain Matt from Starboard Power Coupling apparently has, he's one of
5079660	5083580	those like small world thing, apparently has some friends who are indie developers
5083580	5089220	and their game Lil' Tanks is hitting Steam on Tuesday.
5089220	5093740	One of them's here in Sacramento and of course I told, I said, so it's probably a little
5093740	5096700	late to submit, but do you know about this indie arcade event?
5096700	5099500	You know, so I don't know if they're coming or what have you, but yeah.
5099500	5101420	So another game, Lil' Tanks.
5101420	5105740	So that game actually goes on sale Tuesday, but they were good enough to let me have a
5105740	5106740	little peek at it early.
5106740	5110220	So I was playing that over the weekend and it's kind of like a, it definitely feels like
5110220	5115300	something that's probably inspired by bullet hell games, but because it's tanks, it runs
5115300	5116900	sideways.
5116900	5122220	So it kind of gets, you know how like a lot of like Japanese shooty games are very narrow
5122220	5124540	because that's how the arcade cabinets were.
5124540	5127140	This one kind of flips it on the side cause it's tanks.
5127140	5128740	So it's, it's, it's different.
5128740	5132940	It's very indie, you know, but it's, I, the soundtracks really good too.
5132940	5136260	They're going to be here on Easter in two weeks when we're back with Orange Hospital.
5136260	5137700	They're going to be here on the show.
5137700	5140140	So yeah, those are the next guests we have up.
5140140	5141140	So check that out.
5141140	5147140	I am already thinking about Heavy Weapon on Xbox 360, Xbox Live Arcade.
5147140	5148980	Yes, I'll have to bring that up.
5148980	5150660	How influenced were you by Heavy Weapon?
5150660	5151660	Yes, Heavy Weapon.
5151660	5152660	Definitely, definitely.
5152660	5153660	I'm getting some Heavy Weapon vibes.
5153660	5154660	Shout out to PopCap.
5154660	5157140	That was a great, great, great frigging game.
5157140	5159180	So anyway, yeah, that's awesome.
5159180	5160180	So check that out.
5160180	5162260	That hits Steam on Tuesday, Lil' Tanks.
5162260	5163940	It was a Kickstarter success too.
5163940	5164940	They had to fund on Kickstarter.
5164940	5165940	Nice.
5166620	5167620	So good for them.
5167620	5170620	So, uh, we'll, we'll ask them more questions in a couple of weeks, but I want to make sure
5170620	5174780	they got a shout out because unfortunately with us not having a show next week, I couldn't
5174780	5176680	get them here the week their game was out.
5176680	5179620	So I want to make sure they got a shout out now.
5179620	5180620	So we're all good.
5180620	5181620	So check that out.
5181620	5182620	Well, that's good.
5182620	5184180	You could boost week two sales for an indie developer.
5184180	5185180	That's true.
5185180	5186180	That's true.
5186180	5187180	That's true.
5187180	5189140	You know, when so many games are kind of like, if you don't make it your first week, you
5189140	5190220	know, see you later.
5190220	5191700	Uh, I think that's good.
5191700	5194700	That's good to have the lasting presence, two and three and so forth.
5194700	5195700	Very, very true.
5196460	5197460	All right.
5197460	5199540	Anyhow, uh, I think that's going to do it for gaming weeks.
5199540	5201340	Let's just do some quick housekeeping again.
5201340	5208100	There will be no show live here next Sunday because we will be live on Saturday from 10
5208100	5216220	AM to 4 PM for us, uh, will be live, uh, on the network provided there are no tech issues.
5216220	5217220	There's always that disclaimer.
5217220	5220920	There could always be a tech fuck up, uh, in which case we will record and bring to
5220920	5223520	you an OLR's place, uh, the next night.
5223520	5228680	But we will not be here because we will be busy with the event and actually, um, also
5228680	5232960	just selfishly dark soccer and I have a long time friend who's going to be here from Japan
5232960	5234440	who happens to be here that Sunday.
5234440	5238300	So it's like, it's like one of those things like, okay guys, we're going to, since we're
5238300	5240600	putting in the hours the day before, we're gonna take the night off to go be with our
5240600	5241600	friends.
5241600	5242600	F is for friendship.
5242600	5243600	Exactly.
5243600	5244600	Exactly.
5244600	5245600	Dijour means friendship.
5245600	5249400	And honestly, how long has it been since she's been in the U S like a year, at least, at
5249400	5250400	least.
5250400	5251400	Yeah.
5251400	5252400	So this will be really, really nice.
5253280	5257480	Oh, from there, my favorite, my favorite flavor right now.
5257480	5258480	Oh, that's awesome.
5258480	5259480	Fantastic.
5259480	5262160	So, uh, but we will be back on, yes, Easter Sunday.
5262160	5265600	So if WrestleMania can't stop us, you know, Easter ain't going to stop us.
5265600	5270480	So mine remains to be seen because it's the sisters.
5270480	5272560	I'm like, we're going to be missing the Jewish person on Easter.
5272560	5273560	Really?
5273560	5274560	It's Passover.
5274560	5275560	All right.
5275560	5276560	Fair enough.
5276560	5277560	Fair enough.
5277560	5278560	Fair enough.
5279160	5283720	I will be hosting a Seder on Wednesday if you want to come eat horseradish and matzah
5283720	5284720	with us.
5284720	5287600	Matzah's, matzah's, it's an acquired taste, but yeah.
5287600	5288600	All right.
5288600	5295520	Matzah is, to quote a friend of mine, it's like Jewish ex lax.
5295520	5296520	It's very binding.
5296520	5297520	Wow.
5297520	5298520	All right.
5298520	5299520	Anyhow.
5299520	5301400	Uh, so she's not wrong.
5301400	5302400	So fine.
5302400	5303400	So fine.
5303400	5304400	I get totally not wrong.
5304400	5307640	I swear to God, this happened to me for a month last year where I had flip flop posts
5307640	5308640	for the whole month.
5308640	5309640	It was like one week.
5309640	5310640	Loki was here and Jamie wasn't.
5310640	5312080	Then Jamie was here and Loki wasn't.
5312080	5313860	So we're going to, we're going to do this again this month.
5313860	5315240	So check that out.
5315240	5316880	Uh, we'll be back on April 16th.
5316880	5320460	I can also tell you now, I know this is a ways out, but I just want to make sure y'all
5320460	5321460	can plan.
5321460	5322460	It's also right before my birthday.
5322460	5323460	It is.
5323460	5324460	It is.
5324460	5325460	You're going to miss your, you're going to miss your birthday show.
5325460	5326460	That's fine.
5326460	5327460	I'll do it the week after.
5327460	5330080	Let's quickly talk about OLR's birthday show.
5330080	5336560	So OLR's 15th birthday show is going to be June 18th.
5336600	5338960	Quinceañera!
5338960	5340520	Here's the thing with the Quinceañera.
5340520	5341640	That's two months out.
5341640	5344160	We don't have time to get a ballroom or any of that shit.
5344160	5345160	So my thought is...
5345160	5346580	Can I just wear a pretty dress?
5346580	5349020	Let's him, yes, you can wear a pretty dress.
5349020	5353240	Let's invite some of our friends to the studio to just have a nice 15th episode.
5353240	5354240	Invite some of our friends.
5354240	5358080	We'll see if maybe the game bang guys want to come back or I can sing some Spanish music.
5358080	5359080	Yeah, you can.
5359080	5364720	We'll get some folks here in studio and then maybe for episode 700, maybe our friends that
5364920	5368160	have done event planning in the past will give me a list of contacts.
5368160	5373360	And for episode 700, we can maybe look at, like, or something maybe would be willing
5373360	5376160	to host episode 700 and we could do an event like that.
5376160	5380160	I had to mouse something to the co-hosts because I don't want to put it on air, but...
5380160	5381160	Secrets!
5381160	5382160	Yes.
5382160	5383160	So that way we have enough time to plan.
5383160	5388720	Keep in mind in Alabama, I had no idea what that was called, that it was a thing.
5388720	5392260	I had never heard of that until I moved to California.
5392260	5400460	So I totally want to get everything done and wear a floofy 80s style dress.
5400460	5401460	Go ahead.
5401460	5402460	Do you want to do full drag for the quinceañera?
5402460	5403460	Go for it.
5403460	5405760	Well, I already do that.
5405760	5406760	Give us your best Valentina.
5406760	5408700	It's just reenacting Breakfast Club, apparently.
5408700	5414700	But no, I will not ask if anyone wants to see my cuckoo.
5414700	5417380	Episode 700 should be in about four months.
5417380	5418380	I'm...
5418380	5420460	God, I just, I hope it's not the same weekend as Dragon Con.
5420460	5421460	I don't think it would be.
5421460	5424820	It would be probably right around right after, right around mid-September, I think is when
5424820	5425980	that would fall.
5425980	5427580	Off the plot it out on a list somewhere.
5427580	5428580	So all right.
5428580	5430300	Well, Bree, you're dying to say something over there.
5430300	5433180	Well, four months is plenty of time to plan a proper party.
5433180	5434180	Yeah.
5434180	5435240	So I think, I think that's okay.
5435240	5437340	So Gabe and Bree are doing the we're going to talk thing.
5437340	5439620	So get ready, y'all.
5439620	5444620	Episode 700, we're going to bring to you everything we promised for the quinceañera in proper
5444620	5446700	OLR tardy fashion.
5446700	5453580	So and since JD said OMG Valentina, I want that wig.
5453580	5454580	All right.
5454580	5455580	Look, red wig.
5455580	5457220	I got another podcast to talk about all that.
5457220	5458220	All right.
5458220	5459220	You never had me on.
5459220	5460220	Oh, man.
5460220	5461220	We had enough.
5461220	5464020	We have a spot available this last week to the spikes in Japan.
5464020	5465020	Oh, well.
5465020	5466020	Anyway.
5466020	5467020	We got to move.
5467020	5468020	We got to move on.
5468020	5469940	We got to get into some gaming news and what's going on.
5469940	5472940	Oh, no, I didn't say the whole thing with the quinceañera.
5472940	5479740	So the actual 15th birthday will be June 18th because we're giving ourselves the best
5479740	5482140	birthday present ever.
5482140	5483920	Taking a week off on June 25th.
5483920	5486260	So we will not be here like June 25th.
5486260	5487260	Awesome.
5487260	5488580	Just just booked it today.
5488580	5490460	Hubby and I are going to finally take our proper honeymoon.
5490460	5491460	We're going to go to Chicago.
5491460	5492460	We have.
5492460	5493460	Oh, I saw the tweet.
5493460	5494460	Congrats.
5494460	5495460	Congrats, man.
5495460	5496820	We have some friends that live out in Chicago.
5496820	5499580	And for a couple of years now, they've been saying you got to come to Pride out in Chicago.
5499580	5500580	It's a lot of fun.
5500580	5501580	Come to Pride.
5501860	5504540	Also, you guys may remember the show is right around my birthday.
5504540	5506920	So it's kind of one of those like everything lines up just right.
5506920	5507920	So we're going to.
5507920	5508920	I'm.
5508920	5509920	That's wonderful.
5509920	5510920	You guys deserve that.
5510920	5511920	That's awesome.
5511920	5512920	Fucking gay as hell.
5512920	5513920	That's what.
5513920	5515380	No show is canceled due to gay.
5515380	5523820	That is exactly what is happening on June 25th show canceled due to gay.
5523820	5528060	The gay agenda has finally succeeded in overthrowing an episode of all right.
5528060	5529060	Yes.
5529060	5530060	There's ramen chat.
5530060	5531060	Isn't that the gay agenda?
5531060	5532060	Yes.
5532060	5534660	All right.
5534660	5538660	Let's get into some news this week at the top of the show.
5538660	5540940	Again, we're missing Loki unexpectedly.
5540940	5543340	Did you want me to start Dark Soccer or did you want to start with.
5543340	5544340	Yes, you start.
5544340	5545340	OK, I'm going to start with this one.
5545340	5549020	So let's talk about the Video Game Hall of Fame.
5549020	5550700	Did you know there was a Video Game Hall of Fame?
5550700	5554420	I would hope so, because we've talked about it a couple of years past.
5554420	5558980	There have only been 12 games inducted into the Hall of Fame previously.
5558980	5564420	Doom, Grand Theft Auto 3, The Legend of Zelda, Oregon Trail, Pac-Man, Pong, The Sims, Sonic
5564420	5569820	the Hedgehog, Space Invaders, Super Mario Brothers, Tetris, and World of Warcraft.
5569820	5576420	So the Video Game Hall of Fame has the nominees for the 2017 class announced.
5576420	5581420	You could think of this as something similar to like the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and
5581420	5584780	that whole thing, because isn't Journey finally getting inducted to Rock and Roll Hall of
5584780	5585780	Fame this year?
5585780	5587660	I think I heard something about that.
5587660	5588660	Yes.
5589340	5591660	There's a series that Steve Perry might actually fucking show up and that has everybody like
5591660	5594860	OMG, right?
5594860	5598840	Well yeah, Bob Dylan finally accepted the Pulitzer or something like that, or a Nobel
5598840	5599840	Peace Prize.
5599840	5601660	So yeah, anything's possible now.
5601660	5607020	So anyway, the Strong Museum of Play is located in Rochester, New York.
5607020	5609540	That's where this whole thing is located if you want to know where it is physically.
5609540	5612780	OK, so here's the part like most podcasts are going to do.
5612780	5613780	We're going to do the same thing.
5613780	5616500	We're going to read the list and then tell you how much it sucks.
5616500	5619700	No, we're going to tell you what we would put in.
5619700	5625520	So I'm going to tell you all, I'm going to ask you all of this list, which one is the
5625520	5626820	most important?
5626820	5628820	Which one needs to be in that fucking Hall of Fame already?
5628820	5629820	You ready?
5629820	5630820	You get to pick one.
5630820	5632300	If you pick two, I'm muting you.
5632300	5633300	All right.
5633300	5634300	I'm cutting your mic off.
5634300	5635300	Pick one.
5635300	5636300	Here it is.
5636300	5644260	Donkey Kong Country, Final Fantasy 7, Halo Combat Evolved, Microsoft Windows.
5644260	5647380	Sorry, you all know why I'm laughing.
5647380	5648780	Long time, all our losers.
5648780	5658780	Microsoft Windows Solitaire, Mortal Kombat, Myst, Pokemon Red and Green, Portal, Resident
5658780	5665700	Evil, Street Fighter 2, Tomb Raider and Wii Sports.
5665700	5667780	This is fucking easy for me.
5667780	5668780	But what do you think?
5668780	5669780	One game on that list.
5669780	5671780	It's Halo, right?
5672300	5673300	I snorted over here.
5673300	5674300	Didn't you hear that?
5674300	5675300	No.
5675300	5676300	I had to.
5676300	5680900	And I'm going strictly on objective reasoning here, but I would pick Street Fighter 2.
5680900	5682340	And why is that?
5682340	5687420	Because it was the game that innovated the fighting game genre and has contributed to
5687420	5689000	so many clones.
5689000	5694020	And I don't even think we'd have would have Mortal Kombat if not for Street Fighter 2.
5694020	5698700	So I mean, true, there was just the first Street Fighter and it was OK, but Street Fighter
5698700	5703220	2 was the one that gained the real notoriety.
5703220	5707620	And now, I mean, the franchise is still going strong today, so it has to count for something.
5707620	5709180	All right.
5709180	5710180	But Bree, can I pick on Bree?
5710180	5712700	Did you pick one from that list that you think needs to be there?
5712700	5717420	I was gonna say Mortal Kombat, but then I was just swayed by the knowledge of Jamie
5717420	5722700	because I was only in first or second grade when Street Fighter 2 came out, I think.
5722700	5726540	So I didn't really know, but I was gonna say Mortal Kombat because the rating system came
5726540	5727540	out then, right?
5727540	5728540	That's a good point.
5728580	5732300	I was just about to say, you know, even though, yes, she makes a compelling argument, you
5732300	5738700	make like that is the thing that Mortal Kombat brought the industry is Mortal Kombat caused
5738700	5741860	our industry to self-regulate itself.
5741860	5743420	So don't discount that.
5743420	5745060	That's that's huge what that game did.
5745060	5750980	So a fair counterpoint, Gabe, for you.
5750980	5756900	So yeah, I would almost I would almost say Street Fighter 2 as well, because Street Fighter
5756900	5761740	2 really did change the landscape of fighting games, period.
5761740	5764860	Though one can argue, where's Virtua Fighter?
5764860	5767500	But anyway, that's more on a 3D thing.
5767500	5774540	But on both a personal level, on a very personal level, and then just on the technological
5774540	5782020	standpoint, I'm gonna say Donkey Kong Country, because Donkey Kong Country is that was the
5782020	5787500	first game to incorporate 3D graphics in a 16-bit system.
5787500	5788500	Counter that.
5788500	5789500	Counter that.
5789500	5792500	There's a game on the TurboGrafx-16 called Sapphire.
5792500	5793500	Okay.
5793500	5794500	Okay.
5794500	5795500	Counter to counter.
5795500	5798780	How many kids owned a Super Nintendo versus how many kids owned a TurboGrafx-16?
5798780	5801420	But we also had Star Fox.
5801420	5805100	We also had Stunt Race.
5805100	5813420	So Star Fox was so the significance with Star Fox is because of that Super FX chip
5813420	5817940	that allowed a full 3D environment to be played.
5817940	5818940	Where was it?
5818940	5824180	Where, unlike Mode 7, where everything was flat, you know, the Super FX chip allowed
5824180	5829660	actual an actual playable 3D environment, although it was linear and it was pathed,
5829660	5831420	you know, you could still do that.
5832180	5838980	For me, the significance with Donkey Kong Country was that it utilized actual silicone
5838980	5846620	graphic models and animations into a 16-bit system, and it was just an astounding game.
5846620	5853420	For me, you know, it proved that anything was possible, you know, VR was just beginning
5853420	5861980	to blow up back then, because you're talking 93, 94 that this came out, and that was one
5861980	5866540	of the games that ultimately inspired me to want to get into computer animation.
5866540	5871640	You had to be 10 or 12 or a kid at the time and see that fucking game for the first time
5871640	5874260	where it's like your head just fucking explodes.
5874260	5880860	I still have the video of the behind the scenes that Nintendo Power included.
5880860	5887220	It was a CD that included the making of Donkey Kong Country and all this other stuff, and
5887220	5890340	it highlighted the actual development behind it and things like that.
5890340	5894180	Did you have the balls to call the chatroom nerds earlier and then come with that?
5894180	5898300	Let me make another step aside from that.
5898300	5903140	As far as I was aware, the characters were rendered, yes, but there's still sprites in
5903140	5908620	game, so they're still, the rendering was converted into sprites, so it technically
5908620	5913180	is still sprite animation, and of course the backgrounds are easy to do because they're
5913180	5918780	all going to be a flat 2D entity just rendered from 3D graphics.
5918780	5919780	Right, certainly.
5919780	5920780	Absolutely.
5920780	5924640	So, in that being the respect, maybe the creation of the game had a little bit more tech going
5924640	5926860	into it, but at the end of the day, it's still a platformer.
5926860	5929940	Oh yeah, it was still a platformer, but I think that was the genius behind it.
5929940	5936460	It was the fact that, you know, yes, it was a platformer, but, you know, it was the first
5936460	5944460	time you had fully animated, full-framed characters and movement and expressions done
5944460	5951380	that was actually genuinely powered by, you know, a silicone graphics machine, not a chip.
5951380	5952380	That's where Star Fox comes in.
5952380	5957660	Star Fox, you know, they created a proprietary chip, but Donkey Kong Country did not.
5957660	5962540	It used an actual silicone graphics, and that wasn't cheap back then.
5962540	5967260	For me, Street Fighter II, no contest, but not the reason Jamie said.
5967260	5972300	I mean, not that what she said, but for me, it's the arcades in general, like it's not
5972300	5973300	even just the fighting games.
5973300	5978260	It's just the 90s arcades was defined by Street Fighter II, I think.
5978260	5979820	And I think that's it.
5979820	5982520	This game probably had a greater impact than any other game.
5982520	5985660	It's really close with Pokemon, though, but I don't want to turn off my own mic.
5985660	5988980	So that's all I'm going to say.
5988980	5993740	So because, well, okay, I can't.
5993740	5994740	He wants to.
5994740	5997820	I want to so bad, but we need to move on.
5997820	6001100	So let's talk about one other thing I will go back and say about Sapphire.
6001100	6004380	It was one of the PC Engine Turbo game or duo games.
6004380	6005380	So it was CD.
6005380	6006380	Yes, it was CD.
6006380	6007380	That's why.
6007380	6008380	But I'm posting a picture in the chat room.
6008380	6009380	But still, wonderful reference.
6009380	6010380	Yeah, Sapphire.
6010380	6011380	Wonderful reference.
6011380	6015700	It goes for like 800 bucks, give or take.
6015700	6020380	So anyway, one game that, hey, based on the early reviews might end up in the Hall of
6020380	6024820	Fame in 10 years, who knows, Persona 5 finally making its way out this week.
6024820	6027340	You know, Persona has its rabid fans.
6027340	6030620	People are really freaking excited about Persona 5.
6030620	6031900	See, here's the thing.
6031900	6035380	And we talked a little bit about this on the call with Bobby earlier tonight.
6035380	6037300	I have no hate in my heart for Persona.
6037300	6040260	In fact, I played a little bit of Persona 4 on the Vita, and I do think it's really
6040260	6041720	cool and a different experience.
6041720	6045420	The problem is, like, it takes like 100 hours to get through one of those games.
6045420	6049300	And it's like, it's hard enough for me to play the games that I play.
6049300	6054820	Like, Bree, would you be able to squeeze in 100 hours to play Persona 5 this week?
6054820	6058320	This week?
6058320	6062740	One of my volunteers for the event has actually started it and he's like, Oh, you should try
6062740	6063740	this.
6063740	6064740	I'm like,
6064740	6065740	Yeah, yeah.
6065740	6069380	Let me pencil you in in 2019.
6069380	6071620	But yeah, that's just the type of time commitment it's gonna take.
6071620	6075000	But I know, like, especially JRPG fans, very excited about Persona.
6075000	6077440	The reviews are off the charts for this game.
6077440	6082640	It's going to be, you know, this is this is one other interesting thing about this year.
6082640	6084180	Lots of solid game reviews.
6084180	6087960	You know, it's funny because a couple weeks ago, I think I said, I said, Oh, Zelda Breath
6087960	6089200	of Wild is going to be game of the year.
6089200	6090200	It's already over.
6090200	6094040	And now I'm like, shit, maybe it maybe actually, that was a little early to say that.
6094040	6097960	I mean, it really was early to say that, but shit, for some people, it's definitely gonna
6097960	6098960	be Persona 5.
6098960	6101080	I think it just depends on the type of game you're into.
6101080	6103960	But like, it's getting a lot of solid reviews over there as well.
6103960	6106880	There's other games too that we get into really, this has been a really just good fucking
6106880	6108440	year for games so far.
6108440	6115160	So anyway, Persona 5, of course, going to be coming out on PlayStation 3 and 4 because
6115160	6117000	the game was originally supposed to be a PS3 exclusive.
6117000	6118000	That's true.
6118000	6119000	It's just taken.
6119000	6120000	They've been taking their sweet ass time.
6120000	6121000	Smart move though.
6121000	6126180	You want, hey, we talked about Andromeda not being a well-cooked meal last week, and now
6126180	6128920	this one is going to be a well-cooked meal, so that'll be exciting.
6128920	6132180	However, here's the thing, the share button is going to be disabled.
6132180	6133840	You will not be able to share the pictures.
6133840	6137120	You won't be able to stream the game, at least natively through the PlayStation 4.
6137120	6140860	They have cut all of that off, and Atlus did this.
6140860	6145380	I guess this happens in other Japanese game releases on PlayStation 4.
6145380	6149660	I know like cut scenes in other games have been blocked and so forth, but the whole game
6149660	6150660	blocked.
6150660	6155460	You are not going to be able to stream it, although we all know all you're going to need
6155460	6160080	is a capture card, the extra outside material, and people will be streaming this.
6160080	6167340	So in my opinion, it's just giving those people an advantage, so to speak, in the competition
6167340	6169340	market, but it is what it is.
6169340	6170740	They're not going to stop it.
6170740	6172140	Yeah, they state why they blocked the share.
6172140	6173140	Story spoilers.
6173140	6174140	That's really what it is.
6174140	6175460	They just don't want people ruining it.
6175460	6176460	But it's going to happen anyway.
6176460	6178940	But I'm saying like block Andromeda, if that's the case.
6178940	6179940	Block Zelda.
6179940	6181900	Well, but that's EA and Nintendo.
6181900	6182900	That's not Atlus.
6182900	6187060	Yeah, but I mean, if that's the premise for why they're going to block you, those stories,
6187060	6188600	we want to spoil the story.
6188600	6193900	It's like, it takes 100 hours, give or take, you know, to beat.
6193900	6196180	It'll be the end of the year at the least.
6196180	6199460	So I mean, before really, what are you ruining?
6199460	6203300	But I mean, if it's one thing, if they want to block the cut scenes or the big story moments
6203300	6208220	or things like that, but I mean, like, let us stream the battle sequences and things
6208220	6213580	like that, at least, you know, the actual game elements, a little weird, but I just
6213580	6215660	kind of think it's going to end up being useless.
6215660	6218300	Okay, so the PlayStation can't do it natively.
6218320	6222000	Well, people have capture cards in their computer.
6222000	6223000	They're going to get around it.
6223000	6224000	Yep.
6224000	6225000	So that's that.
6225000	6228180	This game will, game will be streamed, actually, it's probably going to, it's going to make
6228180	6231200	more people want to stream it because they're going to feel like they have the exclusive
6231200	6232200	on it.
6232200	6233200	Now that this news is out there.
6233200	6234560	You just made this a hotter property.
6234560	6235560	Yep.
6235560	6236560	You told us we can't.
6236560	6237560	We will.
6237560	6238560	I know the internet.
6238560	6242840	I know the internet overuses this fucking term, but it's Streisand effect.
6242840	6244440	It's true, man.
6244440	6247760	That like most overused thing on the internet, but anyway, all right.
6248300	6255280	To register participation for this week's episode of orange lounge radio at vognetwork.com,
6255280	6260120	use the passphrase poison, dark Sakura, what do you got for us?
6260120	6263800	Well, some stuff about Oculus ish.
6263800	6269000	The co-founder Palmer lucky is leaving Facebook.
6269000	6274320	He had his last day already.
6274320	6278860	There's no real notice as to why or not.
6278860	6288340	However, it was revealed that he was a supporter of 45 because that name is not worth mentioning
6288340	6291660	on the show.
6291660	6296140	And he also created these memes that attacked Hillary Clinton.
6296140	6297140	Yeah.
6297140	6300300	And from what, you know, again, I want to watch the politics and everything, but my,
6300300	6302220	my understanding is it was those memes.
6302220	6307000	And they, I mean, it's, you know, people feel however they feel politically, but it
6307000	6310600	was the memes and the involvement and all that stuff that people were really taking
6310600	6311600	issue with it.
6311600	6313180	It was like, it wasn't just the politics.
6313180	6316680	It was the heavy involvement in what was kind of, it was a big smear campaign.
6316680	6320520	It wasn't pizza gate, but it was, it was a smear campaign.
6320520	6321520	That's what it was.
6321520	6322520	Plain and simple.
6322520	6327560	So anyway, and so, um, Facebook's, uh, statement about it is just that they, uh, wish him well
6327560	6332200	and thought his innovative spirit helped kickstart the modern VR revolution and build an internet
6332200	6333180	industry.
6333180	6336540	Um, but we've been hiding him in the basement for the past six months until his contract
6336540	6337540	ran out.
6337540	6338540	Anyway.
6338540	6339540	Cause that seems obvious.
6339540	6340540	What's been happening here.
6340540	6343340	Where, where, where the fuck has he been?
6343340	6344340	Yeah.
6344340	6346720	In, in a, they kept him in the cellar.
6346720	6352780	They kept him in the naughty room, clearly Christian gray was like, come here in my room
6352780	6354780	of secrets.
6354780	6359340	Oh, let's not give that any attention.
6359340	6360340	I couldn't help myself.
6360340	6362200	Oh, that's so disgusting.
6362200	6366320	Bobby Black Wolf also points out, you know, besides the, besides the political stuff,
6366320	6372080	he said he also violated an NDA and caused Facebook to lose a $500 million lawsuits.
6372080	6374440	That was kind of a big deal.
6374440	6376000	That's just a little thing.
6376000	6377000	Yeah.
6377000	6378000	An incident.
6378000	6379000	What was sort of a thing?
6379000	6382320	A performance improvement plan was put in his file.
6382320	6387400	AKA the punishment basement.
6387400	6388400	He was pipped.
6388660	6391620	And Black Wolf wants to clarify, he didn't create the memes.
6391620	6393340	He gave the money to the people who made the meme.
6393340	6394340	Sorry.
6394340	6395340	I thought I had made that clear.
6395340	6398820	Well, he's still responsible for their inception.
6398820	6405880	So he, he, he gave them the, the, the markers, I guess you could say, anyway, anyway, anyway,
6405880	6406880	what else was there?
6406880	6407880	That's it.
6407880	6409880	No, I thought that was, oh, I thought,
6409880	6410880	It's your turn.
6410880	6411880	Is it?
6411880	6412880	It's your turn.
6412880	6413880	All right, fine.
6413880	6417300	We can talk about destiny too, because yeah, no, you're right.
6417300	6419960	Destiny 2 finally got confirmed this week.
6419960	6420960	Yay.
6420960	6422640	You know, it was already kind of leaked last week.
6422640	6426840	I think there were some posters that were around out there.
6426840	6432760	But anyway, there's a destiny 2 is being confirmed and there's some actual artwork for the game
6432760	6435560	that's now out there as well as a trailer and so forth.
6435560	6439640	So a lot of folks that are getting hyped for destiny 2.
6439640	6446120	Also you will not again be able to carry over the exact same characters.
6446140	6451700	But the other big news about destiny 2, you are going to get to play this on PC.
6451700	6455740	Destiny 2 will be out for PC, which means it's keyboard and mouse time.
6455740	6460260	So that's going to be pretty exciting because for first person shooters, you know, it's
6460260	6463500	funny because I think if I were to go back 10 years on this show, there was a point where
6463500	6465620	I was like, oh, controllers are still really good.
6465620	6469460	But I think just something has evolved over the years and like keyboard and mouse, I like,
6469460	6471180	that's the only way I could play shooters.
6471180	6476020	Like well, I play Overwatch on PS4, but I'm better at it on PC.
6476160	6479620	Of course, so is everybody else, but you know.
6479620	6485460	I found that the pistol works just like a sniper rifle if you put the shot on the scope
6485460	6486460	on it.
6486460	6487960	So that's how I've been playing through the whole thing of Andromeda.
6487960	6488960	Oh, over Andromeda.
6488960	6489960	Yeah.
6489960	6490960	Yeah.
6490960	6492880	It's been especially good to have that fine control on a mouse.
6492880	6497000	Andromeda multiplayer is hard with the controller for me because I can't get headshots.
6497000	6498280	It's just, it's hard.
6498280	6503560	I have to play like people that can do pew pew fire lasers and things that like space
6503560	6504980	magic all the way.
6504980	6505980	Space magic.
6506040	6509320	So on PC, I'll be able to be a little more accurate.
6509320	6515840	So I'm, I have to say, even I myself, I'm interested when it comes to PC.
6515840	6520720	I want to hear a little more about what the expansions are going to look like for destiny
6520720	6524320	because that destiny too, because that's where I got a little turned off on the first game
6524320	6527820	is that then it was like every few months, it's like, you have to have this expansion.
6527820	6529080	You have to have this expansion.
6529080	6532960	And now there's this other thing and it's like, I kind of, I kind of fell off the wagon
6532980	6539060	at some point and didn't really fucking feel like getting back on, you know, and the, the,
6539060	6542940	there wasn't really, I feel like the way they were trying to sell it too was weird.
6542940	6548860	Like, well, we're not going to sell just a catch up pack, but we'll sell a destiny plus
6548860	6552060	this is like, they want to resell me stuff I already bought.
6552060	6557780	And I'm like, no, it was one of the, it was one of the poorest executions when it came
6557780	6558860	to the downloaded content.
6558860	6562460	Cause I barely had, as I, I loved the first destiny.
6562460	6565880	I really, you know, the, the just the basic of it then right.
6565880	6567560	You know, I'm taking King.
6567560	6572480	So then I got to taking King cause I heard it was a massive improvement over, um, the,
6572480	6575360	the initial destiny and I'm like, okay, great.
6575360	6580040	So, you know, I got out on a deal, I sold my other destiny game and we knew everything
6580040	6581040	was great.
6581040	6585560	And just to only find out what six months later, if that rise of iron and I'm like,
6585560	6588680	you know, I'm like, okay, how much is that going to cost?
6588680	6592980	And then $30 just for the excess said whole.
6592980	6599780	So I start cursing in Spanish in my head and I'm like, but I just, I just spent 40 on right
6599780	6603060	on, on taking King destiny and taking King.
6603060	6608220	And you know, and now I need rise of iron and which I heard was terrible, um, with the,
6608220	6613080	with a few exceptions, but you know, as a developer, you know, if you're a developer
6613080	6617100	out there, indie AAA, cut the shit with that already.
6617100	6618100	Stop.
6618100	6621600	You, you, you, you know, cause now they've announced destiny too.
6621600	6626280	And now, you know, this whole hundred dollar pre-order thing, you know, to get both doc
6626280	6631400	to get, you know, pre-ordered the downloaded packs, you know, the DLC for that as well.
6631400	6636520	And you know, you really want to create this fault line between your cut, you know, in
6636520	6638040	your customers.
6638040	6639680	That's going to be the way to do it.
6639680	6645880	And it just, just off, cause I remember meeting a few people who made that game and they expressed
6645880	6651380	just, just, just acidic disdain for those business decisions behind.
6651380	6656560	There was also, remember when the game first came out, there were all these rumblings about
6656560	6659820	they fucking re hit the reset button on that game.
6659820	6663980	Like two years ago, it was, it's found at the farm has he 15 had a very similar path
6663980	6664980	of fantasy.
6664980	6667920	Is that destiny was supposed to be something like completely different.
6667920	6670940	And then they hit the reset button and then it's like, we have to fucking get a game out
6670940	6671940	and it's happening now.
6671940	6674080	And you could even feel it when you're playing the game, you're like, there's this whole
6674080	6675080	rich story.
6675080	6678000	And then all of a sudden the story just kind of just stops for the last half of the game.
6678000	6680500	And then that's it, but up, up, up, up.
6680500	6684240	That's like, what the fuck was that?
6684240	6686920	And that's one of my other biggest pet peeves with that.
6686920	6692880	Don't don't, don't, don't sell me this massively expansive game, you know, where, you know,
6692880	6697140	you're going to have all these unique story experiences, you know, buzzword after buzzword
6697140	6701520	after buzzword only for me to find out that, Oh, in order to find out more about who you
6701520	6707460	just killed and who's with you now, you know, here's a card, which you can't look at until
6707460	6712720	you go on our website, F off because like, I'm here playing on console, you know, and
6712720	6714600	I was saying like, you didn't even make it for PC.
6714600	6718320	And you want to tell me to go online to look at a stupid car so I can find out who I killed
6718320	6720760	and why get out of here with that nonsense.
6720760	6723600	So I'm good.
6723600	6726760	I I'm interested in destiny two on PC.
6726760	6730000	If it's clear that they're going to take a different path with some of the way they've
6730000	6734680	done the DLC and stuff, but I'm not exactly going to hold my breath on that.
6734680	6735680	So we'll see.
6735680	6736680	I'm not.
6736680	6737680	We'll see.
6737680	6738680	All right.
6738680	6739680	Moving right along.
6739680	6740680	Dark Sakura.
6740680	6744000	Well, I have a couple of stories.
6744000	6745880	One of them is about mad cats.
6745880	6751720	Bobby already talked about it, so I'm not going to go too much into detail, but, um,
6751720	6757880	mad cats filed for chapter seven bankruptcy and as of March 30th, they started, uh, liquidating.
6757880	6764160	So they're basically going to pay off all their lenders ASAP, um, chapter seven.
6764160	6767000	The difference between that and chapter 11 is I'm sure we've heard of both in the business
6767000	6776480	world is that, um, chapter seven, uh, would make you, uh, liquidate and basically vacate
6776480	6778520	board of directors and officers.
6778520	6780440	It's the death of the company.
6780440	6782080	Chapter 11 usually allows for restructuring.
6782080	6783080	Yeah.
6783080	6784840	Chapter 11 is like Radio Shack right now.
6784840	6785840	Right.
6785840	6791680	Uh, what's the other, it was not yet Sears, but, but in the coming days it's happening.
6791680	6792680	Yup.
6792680	6798920	It's a sad, mad cats, as we know, we're co-publishers for some of the rock band games.
6798920	6802240	Um, they also made many, many a cheap controller.
6802240	6805320	I still blame Hori for their death cause Hori makes better controllers.
6805320	6808080	Um, they do actually.
6808080	6813000	And I mean in 2016 their CEO resigned, they laid off 37% of their employees.
6813000	6816040	So none of this should really be a surprise.
6816040	6820480	Their stock's been shit basically for a while now.
6820480	6824440	So I'm sure that anyone who watches financial markets saw this coming.
6824440	6829800	So the other news, which is also shitty news.
6829800	6839560	It was stated that as of March 31st, um, a couple of people at Squenix left, Square Enix,
6839560	6845520	and that was Yoshinori Yamagishi and Isamu Kamikokurio.
6845520	6848040	I'm going to say that Kamikokurio.
6848040	6851160	So they have both left the company.
6851160	6852680	I was such a big fan too.
6852680	6853680	What did they do?
6853680	6855680	Yamagishi produced Star Ocean and Valkyrie Profile.
6855680	6856680	Oh shit.
6856680	6857680	Okay.
6857680	6858680	Wow.
6858680	6859680	Yeah.
6859680	6860680	That is a big deal.
6860680	6861680	And then, um, I'm going to say this again.
6861680	6871400	Kamikokurio, um, gave a Final Fantasy 13 trilogy, Final Fantasy 15, and the third birthday.
6871400	6877440	So both of them resigned so that they can move on to new projects.
6877440	6878500	What did he do on 15?
6878500	6879720	He wasn't the producer of 15.
6879720	6880720	That was somebody that was...
6880720	6882200	He was art director.
6882200	6884720	Oh, interesting.
6884720	6889900	I guess that may be a, just a situation of he had another job that he wanted to take
6889900	6891840	somewhere else or what have you.
6891840	6896200	Probably not a, cause when you, when, if I hear about departures related to 15, I kind
6896200	6901060	of go, I raise an eyebrow a little bit like, oh, but that, but speaking of fucking games
6901060	6904540	I need to play, did you know the whole Gladio thing came out this week?
6904540	6906020	I haven't even got a chance to touch that yet.
6906020	6911660	I have a feeling that they're all doing this sort of Ayn Rand-esque Atlas Shrugged thing
6911660	6917980	where all of the best developers go move to their own island and then just do menial work.
6917980	6923460	Okay, and by the way, Atlas Shrugged was a crappy book, but it has become my example
6923460	6927300	for people bringing themselves out of the limelight and leaving their jobs.
6927300	6932020	I'm really curious to hear who's going to get put on Final Fantasy 16, cause you know
6932020	6933020	it's coming.
6933020	6934020	You?
6934020	6935020	They're going to have me do it.
6935020	6936020	Calamity Jamie presents.
6936020	6942500	I'm just going to be like, that character needs more straps on his shorts and one leg
6942500	6947020	should be longer than the other and there need to be more buckles on the shirt.
6947020	6950440	So he needs to look very, very pretty.
6950440	6953780	Also Eris will be back so I can kill her again.
6953780	6958900	This guy needs a bigger fro cause I'm thinking of what's his face from 13.
6958900	6959900	Sazh.
6959900	6960900	That had the bird.
6960900	6961900	Yeah.
6961900	6964340	And this one needs a bird cage in his fro.
6964340	6970940	Like kind of like a pre-French Revolution-esque wig that had all of that stuff in there.
6970940	6971940	Yes.
6971940	6972940	Yes.
6972940	6973940	This guy needs to be gay.
6974940	6976940	This is okay.
6976940	6977940	Okay.
6977940	6983940	That's me as a game designer.
6983940	6987140	I'd be a good character designer.
6987140	6993780	There are rumors and this could just be fanwank, but there's some rumors that Naoki Yoshida
6993780	6998820	could be the one that ends up doing 16 and it's his reward for basically saving the fucking
6998820	7005220	franchise because Naoki Yoshida is the one that did Final Fantasy 14 A Realm Reborn.
7005220	7011020	So he's the one that took 1.0 and then made the new 2.0 and basically saved the entire
7011020	7012700	fucking day.
7012700	7016140	So there's rumors that he's going to, I mean, they're just rumors.
7016140	7018940	There's rumors that he's going to get to do a single player Final Fantasy game.
7018940	7023900	And I, that would be, I would be huge and I would be really fucking excited if that's
7023900	7024900	the case.
7024900	7028780	I mean, I would hope that 14 gets left in good hands while he has time to go do that.
7028780	7031940	But, um, I would be really fucking excited about that if that happened.
7031940	7034500	Oh, and yes, Reginator, one character will have more strap-ons.
7034500	7036300	Oh God.
7036300	7037300	Moving on.
7037300	7042180	Speaking, oh, speaking of Final Fantasy 14, gosh, it wasn't supposed to be a segue, but
7042180	7043180	it worked out.
7043180	7046260	Final Fantasy 14 has expanded the free trial program.
7046260	7050960	So, uh, you can now, if you've never played Final Fantasy 14 before, you can now play
7050960	7056340	up to level 35 as opposed to level 20, you can play up to level 35 with no time restriction
7056340	7057340	now.
7057340	7058340	So you're not limited to 14 days.
7058900	7060220	You can play as long as you want.
7060220	7063740	However, you do not get to join free companies.
7063740	7066140	You can join parties and link shells, but not free companies.
7066140	7068420	Um, so yeah, you can check that out.
7068420	7072100	That is all of course, to try to get more pre-orders in for Stormblood, Stormblood will
7072100	7074100	be coming out over the summer.
7074100	7076140	Those free companies ain't free.
7076140	7081220	Um, but what's also interesting, the move that 14 is making is that, um, once Stormblood
7081220	7085280	comes out, they are not going to sell the Heavensward expansion any longer.
7085280	7087540	It will just be looped right into the base game.
7088140	7091420	This took Blizzard some time to do with World of Warcraft.
7091420	7093780	Although to be fair, I believe they do it now.
7093780	7097500	I believe there's Legion and there's everything up to Legion.
7097500	7101340	So, um, but for a while you kind of had to buy like two or three expansions to get current.
7101340	7105060	But, um, yeah, you won't have to do that with Final Fantasy 14.
7105060	7106060	So that's pretty cool.
7106060	7109420	Uh, and they're not going to like, they're not going to suddenly charge you more money
7109420	7112260	or anything like it's just going to be Heavensward will just be included in the cost of the base
7112260	7113260	game.
7113260	7114260	It's just all right there.
7114260	7115260	So that's pretty cool.
7115260	7116260	Not bad.
7116260	7117260	Not bad.
7117980	7122420	The new series is coming to Netflix and yes, this actually is coming to North America,
7122420	7125020	but it's, um, supposedly something that's starting in Japan.
7125020	7128980	Uh, it's called Final Fantasy, Daddy of Light.
7128980	7135500	Now here's the thing, because we can make a lot of jokes about Daddy of Light, um, no,
7135500	7137980	I think it's just, I think it's just a translation thing.
7137980	7141660	I don't think, don't, don't take the name too literally you guys too late.
7141660	7142660	So here's the thing.
7142660	7148420	It actually is inspired by a blog that was kept by a father and son where they were actually
7148420	7153220	playing Final Fantasy 14 together, but it helped their own relationship out in that
7153220	7154580	they were kind of getting to bond.
7154580	7157780	So it was like they played this game, but they were bonding through the game.
7157780	7162260	And so it was helping them in real life function as father and son a little more.
7162260	7163420	So I think it's an interesting story.
7163420	7169240	So it's not directly about Final Fantasy 14, but Final Fantasy 14 plays like a key role
7169240	7171220	in the whole storytelling things.
7171220	7172220	That's kind of neat.
7172220	7176620	Um, so yeah, you can, uh, there is a trailer out there if you want to check that out.
7176620	7183900	Uh, yeah, Netflix Japan will get this, uh, April 20th, Netflix Stateside will get it
7183900	7185700	this fall.
7185700	7187020	I definitely am interested.
7187020	7188020	Yeah.
7188020	7189020	I'd like to check this out too.
7189020	7195100	You may not know, but Netflix does translate a lot of their shows in for other countries.
7195100	7198460	So the fact that it's happening this way too, it's kind of cool.
7198460	7199460	Yeah.
7199460	7204180	Netflix Japan's game is, although actually in Japan, MBS and TBS are getting this in
7204180	7205180	Japan as well.
7205180	7208380	It's not only a Netflix thing, so pretty neat.
7208380	7212100	Anyway, one more thing for you guys, then we'll get to the classic game of the week.
7212100	7215260	Let's talk about Call of Duty Infinite Warfare.
7215260	7220580	Uh, there is a new pack available this week, uh, which you can actually buy this online.
7220580	7227700	You can buy now a multiplayer voiceover pack featuring Method Man.
7227700	7228700	That's right.
7228700	7234540	The rapper, producer, and actor dials up the intensity, updating you on killstreaks, enemy

7278340	7279340	Remote uplink successful.
7279340	7283540	Well, that went pan-shaped, didn't it?
7283540	7290540	That I would like to, I just want to offer my services to Activision for a Rob Roberts
7290540	7292880	expansion pack for Call of Duty.
7292880	7296900	And I think if you guys want this to happen, um, you could actually tweet at Activision
7296900	7302460	and let them know you would actually pay $2 for a Rob Roberts, uh, voice pack for Call
7302460	7304700	of Duty Infinite Warfare.
7304700	7305700	Let me give you a little preview.
7305700	7306700	You ready?
7306700	7307700	Thank you.
7307700	7310700	I was just gonna say, what the hell would you say?
7310860	7315860	Don't you know that bitch is shooting at you?
7315860	7318860	Get the hell out of here!
7318860	7325060	Aim for the head, aim for the head.
7325060	7327700	We dropped you some shit, use it!
7327700	7330700	When you want.
7330700	7336260	Oh my God.
7336820	7340820	Let's see, uh, JD says, $2 sold and I don't even play shooters.
7340820	7344460	Kaijuto says, I'd pay five bucks for that.
7344460	7346820	Act F says, I'd buy the game for that.
7346820	7349620	Tiger Claw says, Rob's saying, that's gross.
7349620	7354220	Now that would be my mom, then she could be a whole nother pack of that.
7354220	7363460	Oh my God, that's gross, did you just, ah, did you, you threw the grenade, that is gross.
7363660	7367660	I should get my mother in it, doing the angry Spanish translation pack.
7367660	7370260	Oh, now that I'd buy, getting cursed at in Spanish?
7370260	7371260	Oh my God.
7371260	7372260	Mira!
7372260	7373260	Get the wussies!
7373260	7376260	Oh yeah, oh please.
7376260	7379460	I'm just thinking about what my mom would be like.
7379460	7392460	But if it's featuring the true Spanish household parent, then shouldn't the chancla be a weapon?
7392460	7396260	We've just alienated the entire listening crowd, but it does not matter because I know
7396260	7398060	what he meant.
7398060	7401060	I know how to fucking pay attention when my friends talk about the childhood.
7401060	7405260	I didn't know what that was until I moved out here too, but I guarantee you in the south,
7405260	7408460	the equivalent would be, pick your switch.
7408460	7412060	It'd be that belt coming off.
7412060	7419020	No, I didn't know about it until I saw Victoria beating her then boyfriend with the chancla,
7419020	7421580	and it was actually saying like, do you want to get the chancla?
7421580	7422580	Do you want to get it?
7422580	7423740	And I was like, the fuck?
7423740	7425780	And she explained to me the whole, the whole thing.
7425780	7426780	So.
7426780	7427780	Oh, that's great.
7427780	7428780	That's great.
7428780	7433900	The chancla as a DLC weapon, holy shit.
7433900	7436900	That's incredible.
7436900	7437900	All right.
7437900	7442900	And act deft, by the way, who is our listener in Mexico is just eating this shit up in chat
7442900	7445860	right now, by the way, just so you know.
7445860	7446980	What's up act deaf?
7446980	7449140	I almost, act deaf says fear the chancla.
7449140	7453780	I almost bought my friend a shirt, the same friend, like a shirt that actually had the,
7453780	7457020	and for those that don't know, it's, it's, we call it, this is where you usually hear
7457020	7462780	them called thongs because like the flip flop thongs, but when I hear thong, I think of
7462780	7463780	butt floss.
7463780	7470300	So, but the, the, um, you know, the, the flippy flop shoes, but if you didn't know, you could
7470300	7473220	actually beat somebody with those and it hurts a lot.
7473220	7475340	So this is wack.
7475340	7476340	So yeah, exactly.
7476540	7480340	It's the same thing, like getting hit with a belt too, except the belt flutter.
7480340	7482180	Just consensual, please.
7482180	7483180	If you're going to get into that.
7483180	7484180	All right.
7484180	7487060	Don't be a bad kid.
7487060	7488060	Anyhow.
7488060	7489060	Where were we?
7489060	7490060	Oh yes.
7490060	7491060	Method man for call of duty, infinite warfare.
7491060	7492060	Start tweeting.
7492060	7495500	Why can't we do our own voice packs for these games?
7495500	7499960	Why not in the, remember if you, if you were not aware of this, there is an OLR expansion
7499960	7502380	pack for typing of the dead on steam.
7502380	7503380	We're actually in the shop.
7503380	7504380	Yeah.
7504380	7505380	It was something we did for our 600th episode.
7505420	7506420	Yeah.
7506420	7508020	There's like an OLR DLC thing.
7508020	7509020	It's free.
7509020	7513020	Cause it's all through the workshop and so you can download and it's all like, like fucking
7513020	7515460	years old inside jokes from this show.
7515460	7519140	Like like Cylon, occupied Caprica and jokes that aren't even funny anymore.
7519140	7525260	Like that you can type in, uh, into the, as the, the, but so Iraqi suicide babies isn't
7525260	7526260	on there.
7526260	7532340	I think it is, which is again, before Tumblr reports us, it just goes back to the match
7532340	7534580	game from long, long, long, long, long time ago.
7534580	7538260	So anyway, super pale, better be one.
7538260	7539680	All right.
7539680	7540680	Can I do a game, Ron?
7540680	7541680	Yes.
7541680	7546620	Let's get to the classic game of the week before a method man was out of diapers.
7546620	7547620	Actually.
7547620	7553540	Uh, we, uh, we take a trip back to a classic time when a video games were a little bit
7553540	7556460	different and there was no voice expansion packs for games.
7556460	7561060	If you didn't like the voices in the game too bad, you could, you, you would do what
7561060	7566660	everybody on Twitch does now a day and just recite back the words that were on the screen
7566660	7568540	in your own voices.
7568540	7572500	That's what, that's what people on Twitch do when they played.
7572500	7573500	That's right.
7573500	7574500	Read without reading aloud.
7574500	7575500	All right.
7575500	7576500	Here it is.
7576500	7577700	The classic game of the week.
7577700	7578700	Dark soccer.
7578700	7579700	What'd you pick for us?
7579700	7583420	Well, with all this persona five coming out and everyone losing their shit about it, I
7583420	7590500	decided to give people a hint into what even led to persona and it was an RPG.
7590500	7598640	Back on the Super Famicom called Shin Megami Tensei If, which is in the Shin Megami, it's
7598640	7605780	in the Megami Tensei series, but this is the first RPG of its type in the series that led
7605780	7607860	to the persona series.
7607860	7612500	So this game came out in 1994 for the Super Famicom, which was over here at the Super
7612500	7617780	Nintendo and it is of course a spinoff of the Shin Megami Tensei series.
7617780	7619580	It's been ported to mobile devices.
7619580	7624220	There's a PlayStation port, there's a port on windows, and there is a digital version
7624220	7626020	for the virtual console.
7626020	7632900	Um, basically it follows a student at, uh, Karakazaka high school after their school
7632900	7640560	gets sucked into a realm of demons by a vengeful student's demon summoning spell gone wrong.
7640560	7646260	And so, um, it has a really, it focuses on like a smaller environment.
7646260	7651920	So within the school in its areas and it actually was really decently received and
7651920	7659260	of course it had print adaptations, it had a prequel to it, a mobile prequel, and the
7659260	7665700	high school setting basically is what led to the spinoff persona series.
7665700	7668620	So know your roots.
7668620	7678780	So basically you will, um, take the role of a protagonist, um, it's an unnamed male student
7678780	7684700	or you can play a female student named Tamaki Echida, um, that's, uh, in the later series.
7684700	7691320	Um, you basically have to explore the school while it's all demon infested and these different
7691320	7694120	towers that are based on the seven deadly sins.
7694120	7701020	And then, um, you have this little wrist mounted device called comp and you fight demons in
7701020	7702600	the turn based battle system.
7702600	7706380	You have physical and magical attacks, healing attacks, status ailment.
7706380	7707380	It's an RPG.
7707380	7714220	I mean, really, but, um, you can also recruit demons in it and bring them into your party.
7714220	7722360	You also can get other human companions, uh, and then when your player or your other human
7722360	7727620	dies, they get a guardian spirit who can revive them at the last day point and teach
7727620	7729740	them new skills and stuff like that.
7729740	7735300	So the game, I mean, and the big reason I'm bringing it up is because we now are on our
7735300	7740260	fifth installment of the persona series, all coming from Shin Megami Tensei, which I've
7740260	7745700	done, um, as a previous classic game, but this one here, I think that this one is the
7745700	7746960	one to pay attention to.
7746960	7751820	When it came out, it actually was said to have really dated graphics for its time.
7752280	7753360	I mean, this is 1994.
7753360	7760400	I thought it was okay, but it does kind of look like it's not the best quality wise,
7760400	7768040	but the game itself was, uh, so decently received and really opened the door to, um, to those
7768040	7769680	future games.
7769680	7775080	So, um, the other thing about it too is that it's working title is called Shin Megami Tensei
7775080	7776080	X.
7776340	7782080	Um, it was where they created that partner system where you could have, um, you know,
7782080	7785660	basically creating that with multiple different characters in it.
7785660	7789220	And then, um, they had a lot more that they wanted to do for it.
7789220	7792700	So of course, a lot of the stuff that was left on the cutting room floor made it into
7792700	7794220	future games.
7794220	7798940	Um, and some of the music in the game actually had lyrics written for it.
7798940	7801980	Um, but you don't hear the song in the game.
7802000	7805240	You only hear, like, a line of it in the game.
7805240	7812800	Um, and then it really was supposed to bring in the theme of reincarnation as it's been,
7812800	7815840	it was supposed to be something that was part of the Shin Megami Tensei series, but didn't
7815840	7822600	have much representation, um, so that you could keep enjoying the game after you died
7822600	7823600	in battle.
7823600	7826160	And you also had lifeboats for people who die in battle.
7826160	7827160	It's kind of interesting.
7827160	7831200	The other thing that's cool is if you are a Japanese baseball fan, um, three of the
7831220	7838820	characters in the games were named after pitchers for the, um, uh, Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters.
7838820	7844460	Um, so, which is actually, like, one of the three baseball teams I know about over there.
7844460	7849060	There's like them, the Bay Stars, and the Yakult Swallows, which I think is also funny
7849060	7852300	that they're called the Swallows because you drink Yakult.
7852300	7853300	Go fig.
7853300	7860200	Anyway, um, there was, uh, one of the characters, Akira, his transformation was based off of
7860200	7861200	Devilman.
7861200	7863440	If anyone's ever seen that.
7863440	7868300	It was, um, by the guy who did Cutie Honey.
7868300	7874460	It was a dude who gets basically turned into a demon, so, um, Gonagai, that was his name.
7874460	7880860	Um, and you know, another character was, uh, based off of a character from Black Jack there.
7880860	7887700	You know, so there's lots of influences from just general anime and pop culture and sports
7887700	7890640	history all thrown into the game.
7890640	7897600	So, um, it came out on October 28th, 1994, and had a re-release on December 26th, 2002
7897600	7898600	for PlayStation.
7898600	7905320	Um, I almost liked the PlayStation version, but I wanted the SNES music, so.
7905320	7910360	The music they did for the PlayStation one is actually pretty good, so.
7910360	7915320	Um, there are, of course, like I said, there's ports on it, of it, for Virtual Console for
7915320	7916880	Wii and Wii U.
7916880	7919200	Um, I think Japan only, of course.
7919200	7924020	There was a Microsoft Windows for the iRevo PC in 2006, and then there's an Android and
7924020	7926580	iOS version that came out in 2013.
7926580	7931660	Um, and that is also the first mobile version of the game.
7931660	7938140	And then there came another game on April 22nd, 2004 called Shin Megami Tensei Ith Hazama's
7938140	7939140	Chapter.
7939140	7946200	Um, and that was for the FOMA 900i mobile phones, and it's a prologue to this game.
7946200	7950100	So it basically is whatever the character Hazama did right before the incident went
7950100	7951100	down.
7951100	7955780	And they offered a limited edition ROM cartridge- Oh, sorry.
7955780	7959740	They wanted to do a limited edition ROM cartridge of the game, but their budget did not let
7959740	7960980	it happen.
7960980	7966420	So basically after this, like I said, there were many, many other, um, iterations of the
7966420	7967420	story that came out.
7967420	7973260	There was the manga, which was, um, Shin Megami Tensei Ith School of the Demon Messenger.
7973260	7978960	Um, uh, there actually got translated into French.
7978960	7983200	Uh, there was another manga that was Shin Megami Tensei Kan.
7983200	7988240	And then there was, uh, Shin Megami Tensei Ith Gen of Makai.
7988240	7996680	Um, so basically a lot of, you know, the big thing is that the settings for the game, the,
7996680	8001320	the high school setting and some of the mechanics that were introduced in this game are what
8001320	8004160	led to Persona.
8004160	8009440	And so this right here is your Persona progenitor.
8009440	8015440	And if they hadn't branched out and made this spinoff, there'd probably be no Persona.
8015440	8016440	And that's your classic game.
8016440	8017440	All right.
8017440	8021220	I'm sure a lot of Persona fans though, probably, probably check this out in an emulator at
8021220	8023260	some point just to see, you know, what it's all about.
8023260	8024600	I will point this out.
8024600	8031080	Apparently accessories and outfits from this game have been featured in, uh, Shin Megami
8031080	8036600	Tensei Imagine, and it will be available as downloadable content for Shin Megami Tensei
8036600	8037600	Persona 5.
8037600	8038600	Nice.
8038600	8039600	So.
8039600	8040600	All right.
8040600	8045600	Shin Megami Tensei Ith, the classic game of the week, a little bit, a little bit thematic
8045600	8046600	there.
8046600	8047600	Uh, we're going to take a quick break though.
8047600	8049000	We got more Orange Lounge Radio to come.
8049000	8050000	We're only halfway there.
8050000	8051000	Are you ready?
8051000	8052000	No, I'm just kidding.
8052000	8053880	We're going to, we're going to speed up part B a little bit, I think, so we can get through
8053880	8056840	the show at a decent hour tonight, but we are going to get to your calls as well at
8056840	8058520	Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

8064320	8067280	the upcoming event and maybe what else is in store for IGG.
8067280	8069760	I want to, I want to pick your brain on what else we might have to look for.
8069760	8072960	I know you probably can't see much past next week right now, but if you want to throw us
8072960	8076280	anything, what, what else we have to look forward to, we'll talk about that when we
8076280	8079840	come back from a break, uh, here at Orange Lounge Radio.
8079840	8080840	Don't go anywhere.
8080840	8087840	We'll be right back.
8087840	8093640	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live tonight, episode number 682 of our show

8110960	8111960	Did I get it right?

8145320	8146320	know, 20 kids.
8146320	8149880	Plus their grand babies.
8149880	8151360	I think they live, they live far, far away.
8151360	8152360	So you should be fine.
8152360	8153360	Yeah.
8153360	8154520	Video games are probably against their religion anyway.
8154520	8156080	So all right.
8156080	8157080	Yeah.
8157080	8161040	Um, so in addition to Sac Indie Arcade, you know, we've got developers coming from all
8161040	8162040	over the country.
8162040	8165160	We even have some people coming in from Puerto Rico, which is weird.
8165160	8166160	Yeah.
8166160	8167160	That's great.
8167160	8168160	Singapore.
8168160	8172440	Um, so it's going to be a great time, whether you're a casual gamer, hardcore gamer, young
8172440	8174520	gamer, old gamer, we've got something for everyone.
8174520	8177600	Of course, OLR is going to be in the house as well.
8177600	8183280	The most important thing, our VIPs, we got to make sure you guys are taken care of.
8183280	8189000	And um, one of our offshoots of IGDA Sacramento square one clubs is actually getting ready
8189000	8190640	to open here in Sacramento.
8190640	8196220	They, they are a coworking space focused on growing the video game development industry
8196220	8198280	here in Sacramento.
8198280	8202780	And um, so they sponsored our progressive game jam for the 2016 2017 season.
8202780	8204820	We're going to have a special little section for them.
8204820	8209180	If anyone's familiar with the game jams, usually it's kind of like a hackathon that takes place
8209180	8210660	over a weekend.
8210660	8214300	Our game jam has taken place over the course of nine months, so you'll get a chance to
8214300	8218420	play demos of games developed in a nine month period.
8218420	8220620	Can you tell us a little more about like this?
8220620	8224260	Because this shared space thing seems to be this growing trend I see in the tech industry
8224260	8228340	because I notice, um, like, uh, when, when you guys invited me, which thanks again, by
8228340	8233500	the way, to, to host the T cubed event that with those guys, uh, we, we talked a little
8233500	8234500	bit about the success they've had.
8234500	8238260	And if you guys don't know the T cube thing, they're, they're not a video game per se.
8238260	8240220	They're more one of those like tangible games.
8240220	8243700	It's an actual cube that it's, it's, I get the easiest way I can say is tic tac toe on
8243700	8247020	a cube, but it's more, it's more complex than that, but you just, you've got to trust me
8247020	8248020	on it.
8248020	8250700	Um, come play it at any arcade cause I'm sure they're going to be there.
8250700	8255740	Um, but that was at that hacker lab, which is more of like a, like a, you know, kind
8255740	8259060	of like a computer development space, but they also have, they have like, cause I know,
8259060	8262920	um, the gentleman from T cube to talk about, he'd actually crafted some of those cubes
8262920	8264020	there at hacker labs.
8264020	8267220	They actually have industrial, like that type of technology and stuff too.
8267220	8268220	Right.
8268220	8272540	So, so this space, this square, square one, square one clubs, I can't help but think of
8272540	8273820	the TV show, which is awesome.
8273820	8277460	By the way, I don't know if you remember growing up square one.
8277460	8278460	Yeah.
8278460	8279460	Yeah.
8279460	8280460	Thank you.
8280460	8281460	Okay.
8281460	8286540	I didn't even have to think, Oh, that's, that's, square one needs to play in homeroom.
8286540	8288860	I know now, now you're not, okay, okay.
8288860	8293420	I'm going to work on that, but tell me a little more about what like a collaborative space
8293420	8295340	like means.
8295340	8301100	So collaborative spaces in general really invite the community, people from different
8301100	8306340	um, whatchamacallit, uh, disciplines to come and work together.
8306340	8311220	You can either work in an office or work in the general area and it's kind of like being
8311220	8312760	in a coffee shop, but not.
8312760	8318180	So your membership provides access to internet printers, you know, beverages that may be
8318180	8319180	in the area.
8319180	8324480	I think what's really going to define square one clubs as opposed to the other spaces in,
8324480	8328100	in Sacramento is that, um, we plan to have a studio.
8328100	8332180	So if there's anybody who would like to broadcast from there, there'll be able to come and use
8332180	8333180	that facility.
8333180	8336340	Um, it's going to be focused around video games.
8336340	8338380	Why don't you just roll out the orange carpet?
8338380	8340820	I think we're going to have to come on and crash your facility.
8340820	8341820	Yes.
8341820	8345900	We invite Twitch streamers, podcasters, um, anyone who wants to come and check that out,
8345900	8349900	voiceover talent who may want to record something for a call of duty.
8349900	8350900	Yes.
8350900	8351900	For that DLC.
8351900	8352900	Reach out to Marissa.
8352900	8353900	Yes.
8353900	8354900	Oh my gosh.
8354900	8359060	Marissa, our, our pal and just the legit stuff.
8359060	8362160	It's going to be a very unique space and of course we're going to welcome other types
8362160	8368060	of software developers and such, but um, the Sacramento game development community is finally
8368060	8369380	going to have a place to call home.
8369380	8374340	We've been bouncing around from coworking space to coworking space and we invite everybody
8374340	8377300	to come in once doors open and you guys will definitely be the first to know.
8377300	8380660	I want to, I totally, are you allowed to disclose where it is yet or is that still secret?
8380660	8383820	It's going to be located in East Sacramento.
8383820	8385380	Like what part?
8385380	8386380	I'm just curious.
8386380	8387380	I'm curious.
8387380	8388940	Like really close to your studio.
8388940	8389940	Really?
8389940	8390940	Really.
8390940	8393700	Is it, is it the space that save point was going to go into?
8393700	8394700	No.
8394700	8395700	Okay.
8395700	8396700	All right.
8397340	8399780	Cause I know that that was a contested space for a little bit.
8399780	8400780	So, okay.
8400780	8401780	All right.
8401780	8402780	Oh, I'm excited.
8402780	8403780	I'm excited.
8403780	8404780	Yay.
8404780	8405780	Okay.
8405780	8408060	Uh, but I just want to point out, Bree, I do love the name, but I'm going to play this
8408060	8410900	for you and now it ain't ever leaving your head.
8410900	8411900	Okay.
8411900	8414700	And this is whenever you walk through the doors of your shared space.
8414700	8416700	Oh man.
8427700	8429700	It's so nineties.
8429700	8431700	I know, right?
8431700	8434700	Oh, this was high school.
8434700	8436700	It was like, no, Bree, you don't understand.
8436700	8441700	It was like sketch comedy about math.
8441700	8447300	I don't, I don't think there is, I don't think there is a nerdier thing in existence than
8447300	8448340	square one television.
8448340	8449340	There really is not.
8449340	8456620	I mean, they, they had, it was, it was sketch comedy and it was all math jokes.
8456620	8459380	Which me being a number cruncher, I should appreciate something.
8459380	8460380	Yeah.
8460380	8463660	You need, I don't know if PBS like fucking sells this stuff on DVD to raise money.
8463660	8468220	Cause if you know, 45 tries to gut, they're going to, they're going to have to go, go
8468220	8471340	deep into the archives to figure out how to keep the blights on over there.
8471340	8473660	So you might be able to get square one on Blu-ray.
8473660	8477420	So I encourage you to get on that and catch up on math net because they did this whole
8477420	8482700	parody of that cop show drag net, but it was math net and they use math to solve crimes.
8482700	8483900	I shit you not.
8483900	8486860	It was like, no, I'm sad.
8486860	8494580	I fucking with you when I was 10 years old, that was like the highlight of my Friday was
8494580	8498100	that math net was going to come to a fucking conclusion that Friday.
8498100	8502700	And we would find out who fucking stole the baseball or whatever the crime was they were
8502700	8510660	trying to solve that night anyway, dark to see a points out.
8510660	8518180	Also math, man, the Pac-Man clone, but with math problems, I remember that.
8518180	8520060	Oh my heavens.
8520060	8521060	Okie dokie.
8521060	8522060	Okay.
8522060	8523060	Um, so let's see.
8523060	8524060	Oh gosh.
8524060	8525060	Anything else quickly?
8525060	8527380	I know, I know these spaces, this shared space is going to be awesome.
8527380	8530820	I'm so like just the networking is going to be amazing there.
8530820	8535260	Um, uh, we, we have to figure out like as some type of, I'm just going to like totally
8535260	8536260	invite ourselves.
8536260	8537260	Okay.
8537260	8538720	Ready as some type of like inaugural event.
8538720	8545760	I think us and the, the, the game bang and whoever, whoever else, it sounds like I'm
8545760	8546760	making fun.
8546760	8547760	I'm totally not.
8547760	8548760	I love those guys.
8548760	8549760	No, no, it's their name.
8549760	8554140	Their studio, their studio is fucking off the hook to like, I thought we were crazy
8554140	8558320	in our house, but like that guy, they, they, they did, they did some work.
8558320	8560480	Um, but what was I going to say?
8560480	8564960	Uh, um, and whoever, whatever other Sacramento podcast I'm not thinking of right now need
8564960	8568400	to all come do like a super show to like kick that place off.
8568400	8569600	I think that would be a fun thing to do.
8569600	8570600	That's a great idea.
8570600	8575320	Can I just give some props though to our Sacramento game mer community as a whole?
8575320	8577400	Because last week was huge.
8577400	8581120	Sac town magazine published two articles, one about square one, one about second year
8581120	8586760	arcade, um, energy, the e-sports team co-owned by one of the Sacramento Kings.
8586760	8591920	They had a halftime show with gamers playing games on the big screen and everything.
8591920	8597040	I mean collectively everyone getting together to make something happen, like we're getting
8597040	8600900	attention here to our area, to our neck of the woods, and I think everyone should be
8600900	8601900	so proud.
8601900	8606680	Yeah, no, I mean this is, I, and again, I feel like, like we've, we've kind of like
8606680	8611200	literally watched this grow from you guys being here two years ago promoting for what
8611200	8615240	was for us the first event, uh, into this now it's like, Oh my God, what's this going
8615240	8616240	to look like in 2020?
8616240	8617240	What's going on?
8617240	8620740	And of course, probably Bree is starting to get a heart increased heart rate thinking
8620740	8626800	about three years down the line, but all right, uh, let's see.
8626800	8627800	Yeah.
8627800	8629760	Brad from pop culture says you obviously haven't seen our studio.
8629760	8631400	No, I mean, I've seen, I've seen pictures.
8631400	8633680	Some of you, some of y'all are really dedicated to your craft.
8633680	8634680	Not that we aren't.
8634680	8638240	I'm just saying it's just like, I'm really impressed when I went over cause I did, I
8638240	8639240	did their show.
8639240	8640240	It was a while ago now.
8640240	8641240	It was probably about a good six months ago.
8641240	8642320	It was right around the time they were here.
8642320	8644600	I did their show and I remember walking in their room.
8644600	8646840	Have you, have you been over to their studio?
8646840	8649240	It's I'm like, wow, you went full conversion.
8649240	8650680	You, you committed here.
8650680	8654680	Like in our place, it's like, it's still kind of half a living room.
8654680	8659920	Like if I ever had a grandma over or something, I could like put draperies on things and things
8659920	8660920	would be hidden.
8660920	8665600	Like, so it wouldn't be so obvious that fucking nerds are here, but like that was, that was
8665600	8668240	full on commit like in their, in their space.
8668240	8669480	So props to them.
8669480	8670480	All right.
8670480	8672200	Anyhow, uh, we want to move on.
8672200	8676260	We got to get to, um, some release dates, talk about, uh, what's coming up in stores
8676260	8679480	this week and we're going to get to our mailbag as well.
8679480	8681940	So dark soccer, what's coming up in stores this week?
8681940	8688220	On the seventh, we have, um, in the U S we have, um, the Alchemist and the mysterious
8688220	8696060	journey on PC, PS4, PS Vita, logo worlds for windows, PS, you know, I'm looking at March,
8696060	8697060	Rob.
8697060	8698060	I'm sorry.
8698060	8700240	Oh, it's April.
8700240	8701240	That's okay.
8701240	8704340	And of course the one minute I look the other way to go look at something else.
8704340	8705340	Okay.
8705340	8711800	Um, on the fourth, drawn to death, prop of the rapper remastered persona five, Lego city
8711800	8717560	undercover on the fifth paradigm and the seven bullet storm full clip edition.
8717560	8722820	Ooh, Lego city undercover was spectacular.
8722820	8725160	So love that game on Wii U.
8725160	8729820	And now that I have to completely reevaluate all of my life choices, let me go back and
8729820	8730820	double check.
8730820	8735800	Um, the UK and on April 4th we have enter the Gungeon and on the seventh bullet storm
8735800	8738520	full clip edition.
8738520	8740760	You're just now getting entered to the Gungeon over in the UK.
8740760	8741760	That's a fun game.
8741760	8742760	So it's a rerelease.
8742760	8744440	Oh, it's like a remastered one.
8744440	8750000	They just cause, um, it was also on the American releases as I just said, sorry about that.
8750000	8751000	I hear you.
8751000	8752960	Well, let's go to Japan right now.
8752960	8753960	Get on a plane.
8753960	8755800	Um, BRB over in Japan.
8755800	8756800	Now this is interesting.
8756800	8761200	There's not a really a huge game release that I see any way on the PlayStation four this
8761200	8762200	week.
8762200	8767480	Um, but they are getting an actual kingdom hearts, 15th anniversary PlayStation four.
8767480	8771160	So like you can actually get the system and it's decked out and all the little symbols
8771160	8774280	doesn't like have a giant Sora or anything, but it's got all the little symbols and all
8774280	8775280	that stuff on it.
8775280	8780160	So, um, that's, uh, that's a really nice looking piece of technology.
8780160	8782720	Uh, Vita doesn't really have anything this week either.
8782720	8784640	I think it's kind of a slower week over in Japan.
8784640	8789960	We don't really, um, we have some type of a cover on the Nintendo switch, but I don't
8789960	8791980	really see a lot of game releases this week.
8791980	8794280	It seems to be just a slower week over in Japan.
8794280	8799800	Uh, there's one isolated release on the three DS, kawaii pet to cut us.
8799800	8806640	So one neon and mini, mini animal, which it's all, it's not just kitties.
8806640	8808640	I mean, there's definitely a neon in there.
8808640	8809640	I did it.
8809640	8810640	Well, there's definitely a neon right there.
8810640	8811640	Front and center.
8811640	8813400	It's something like cute animals, something.
8813400	8814400	It's cute.
8814400	8815600	Oh God, this is so fucking adorable.
8815600	8816600	I can't.
8816600	8820120	It's like Nintendog, cats, chinchilla.
8820120	8825100	That is a bunny, a chinchilla squirrel and an otter.
8825100	8826600	There's a hedgie up there.
8826600	8829860	So fucking cute.
8829860	8833640	So that clearly they cleared the release calendar for two weeks cause everybody's going to be
8833640	8834640	playing that.
8834640	8835640	All right.
8835640	8836640	So that's it for release dates.
8836640	8837840	How about the mailbag?
8837840	8841080	We're going to get to our mailbag and uh, just so you guys know, we did cut out rapid
8841080	8842080	fire news tonight.
8842080	8846480	We are trying to end at a decent hour tonight and our first half was a little more than
8846480	8847480	half.
8847480	8849880	So we are cutting a few corners here tonight just to make sure we wrap up the show in a
8849880	8852800	timely manner because some of us have to work tomorrow.
8852800	8855960	So we're going to get to the uh, mailbag this week.
8855960	8861840	Uh, you guys send us emails, participate at orange lounge radio.com is the place where
8861840	8862840	you can send us emails.
8862840	8863840	Holy balls.
8863840	8865240	Do we get a really long email?
8865240	8866240	Yeah.
8866240	8867240	No.
8867240	8868240	Is it just one though?
8868240	8869240	No, you have two others.
8869240	8870240	Okay.
8870240	8872560	Salutations from across the pond.
8872560	8873920	I might've read this last week.
8873920	8874920	Check the date.
8874920	8875920	Okay.
8875920	8876920	The 27th.
8876920	8877920	Is it James Nighthawks?
8877920	8878920	Yeah, it is.
8878960	8879960	Yeah.
8879960	8880960	I don't know how.
8880960	8882960	Did you also read AZHPs?
8882960	8883960	No.
8883960	8884960	Fine.
8884960	8885960	Okay.
8885960	8888960	Hey, oh, well, this one's long too.
8888960	8889960	Hey, O.L.R.
8889960	8890960	AZHP here.
8890960	8893880	I'm currently listening to last week's podcast.
8893880	8896600	We all, where you all talk about Mass Effect Andromeda.
8896600	8897600	Guess what?
8897600	8898780	We did it this week too.
8898780	8902560	And notice that Rob describes Andromeda as being a game that could have been a 10 out
8902560	8907520	of 10, whereas Zelda can is considered by that to be many, if not for the glaring technical
8907520	8908560	issues.
8908560	8912680	I feel that Andromeda is a good game that leans too heavily on previous Mass Effect
8912680	8916640	games for structure and set up to be a true 10 out of 10 masterpiece.
8916640	8920380	Rob's story about the transgender character blurting out, I'm transgender.
8920380	8925220	And Loki saying, I think they were just trying to check a box sums up my feeling about the
8925220	8926220	game.
8926220	8930380	It feels like a paint by numbers game across the board.
8930380	8934620	I'm only a few hours in, but the Pathfinder concept seems like they attempted to fast
8934620	8937640	forward the human specter concept from the first game.
8937640	8941680	It's immediately obvious who your future squad mates will be and what their loyalty missions
8941680	8942680	will be.
8942680	8943680	Not really.
8943680	8944680	One per colony ship.
8944680	8949280	And a lot of writers dialogue options make me feel like I made the wrong choice after
8949280	8954320	picking it because he sounds so snide and just reiterates I'm the Pathfinder.
8954320	8958540	And we got this instead of being a closer to a reflection of what I, the player, wanted
8958540	8961340	to choose as it was in the previous games with Shepard.
8961340	8965960	For the record, Lady Rider doesn't sound like that.
8965960	8968200	She sounds sincere.
8968200	8972540	I don't think that more time with the game would have made it a 10 out of 10.
8972540	8976960	It would have just made it the same 7 to 8 out of 10 game without animation bugs and
8976960	8981200	scripting errors, which at the very least are entertaining to see.
8981200	8986000	In a world where this was the first Mass Effect game, this game would have been an amazing
8986000	8987680	achievement even 10 out of 10.
8987680	8991760	But coming off of the first three, and for me personally having loved those games, to
8991760	8995800	have this be the long awaited sequel just falls a little flat to me.
8995800	9003360	Finally, and sorry for the length of the email, now you say it, Rob noted that he hopes
9003360	9006680	that the poor reception to the unfinished nature of the game would not stop a sequel
9006680	9007680	to the game.
9007680	9012420	EA has noted in interviews that they think of Andromeda as a standalone game with no
9012420	9013920	planned sequel.
9013920	9019360	I can't find a direct source on this aside from Jeff Girtzman, who has been covering
9019360	9023080	video games for the last 21 years and who I consider a reliable source in the game's
9023080	9024080	press.
9024080	9027960	I just want to say to that real quick, I understand that PR put that out there, that doesn't mean
9027960	9028960	I believe it.
9028960	9032920	Like, I'm really going to believe that they're going to let the Mass Effect cache egg go.
9032920	9033920	Come on.
9033920	9037120	Mentioning that he heard this from a press contact.
9037120	9041060	This of course does not preclude the sequel from being greenlit, but my guess is that
9041060	9045240	not having plans to make this into another trilogy along with a tepid response from critics
9045240	9048360	and players would push them in the direction of not making one.
9048360	9051880	Sorry again for the long email, just wanted to add my voice to the show and see what you
9051880	9052880	all think.
9052880	9054000	Yours truly is HP.
9054000	9055000	I'm curious.
9055000	9056160	I welcome the opinion.
9056160	9060120	And honestly, what's interesting about it is AZHP sounds like he's in a place somewhat
9060120	9062080	similar to where I was at a week ago.
9062080	9068060	So I'm curious, how much time did AZHP spend with the game since writing that email and
9068060	9070040	have the opinions changed at all?
9070040	9074360	Because the more time I spend with the game, my impression does get more favorable, I think
9074360	9076640	is important to put out there.
9076640	9078560	Not that that's going to be the same for everybody.
9078560	9081240	And certainly, you know, it's the show where every gamer has a voice and there are going
9081240	9084700	to be some people that feel that Mass Effect gets no stronger than a seven or eight.
9084700	9086320	And that's that's fine.
9086320	9090160	You know, and even even if I was saying last week, and this is probably still the case,
9090160	9093560	although I think at the end of the day, I'm going to enjoy Andromeda and I probably would
9093560	9096880	say Mass Effect Andromeda is probably going to be better than one.
9096880	9097880	Not sure.
9097880	9100960	I mean, again, I have to beat it to really know, but I'm not sure it's going to outpace
9100960	9101960	two or three.
9101960	9104680	I still think when all is said and done, two and three are going to be better games for
9104680	9105680	me.
9105680	9110760	But like, I don't have the flaming hate boner that Twitter seems to have for this game in
9110760	9111880	some regards.
9111880	9116080	That's the only thing that's like concerning me a little bit is that there's a lot of hater
9116080	9117080	aid out.
9117080	9119240	My biggest hate was the character creation.
9119240	9120240	I mean, really.
9120240	9125880	But like, I even sent like a positive tweet to BioWare saying that I really loved the
9125880	9132120	rendering of fabric textures in the game, because with my new graphics card, I can see
9132120	9135160	the leather looks like fucking leather.
9135160	9138880	The vinyl looks like vinyl canvas looks like canvas.
9138880	9142660	And to me, a lot of times you can find a rendered game.
9142660	9146320	It takes a lot of work to render texture that well.
9146320	9148000	And so I was super impressed with that.
9148000	9149720	I mean, graphically, it's an amazing game.
9149720	9152600	I do want to make sure we point out at some point, too, because I don't think it's come
9152600	9153680	up on the show yet.
9153680	9157580	But BioWare has said they're going to be releasing some details.
9157580	9159320	I think it was April 4th.
9159320	9161040	So like Tuesday, I think it was.
9161040	9165040	They're going to be releasing additional details about what the future of Andromeda will look
9165040	9166040	like.
9166040	9170520	A big part of it is addressing some of the concerns that have come out on Twitter.
9170520	9173440	So like how the Turians are going to eat.
9173440	9174440	I don't.
9174440	9175440	We don't know.
9175440	9176720	Like, we don't know what they're going to address.
9176720	9179280	Could it be a DLC announcement?
9179280	9180560	Could it be a free patch announcement?
9180560	9185040	Are they going to do something like they did with the extended cut for three?
9185040	9186040	I don't know.
9186040	9192080	So so we won't know till the next show to put out a deluxe upgrade for those of us who
9192080	9194120	are strong armed into buying the regular version.
9194120	9195120	OK.
9195200	9196200	That would be nice.
9196200	9197520	So the last email.
9197520	9200120	It's called Shane.
9200120	9201480	Hello, O.L.R.
9201480	9206120	Given recent gaming and movie releases, I feel like we're missing someone's input.
9206120	9209360	Any chance Shane will chime in on the show tonight with his thoughts on Andromeda Power
9209360	9214440	Rangers or the switch in Breath of the Wild and answer no unless he calls.
9214440	9218600	I know this seems a bit of an odd request, but I miss the sassy molassie.
9218600	9220920	Sincerely, Ospher.
9220920	9223480	Shane, call.
9223480	9224480	Please.
9225680	9226920	And that's it.
9228080	9229720	Dun dun dun.
9232760	9237440	Phil Time, Phil Tech, I'm actually texting Shane right now, but I believe they are taping
9237440	9238600	Ranger pride right now.
9238600	9239600	Well, what's he doing that for?
9239600	9240720	Well, here's some stuff.
9240720	9247280	Speaking of Zelda, there are apparently going to be a patch for Breath of the Wild.
9247280	9250600	Just a little update, but it's supposed to just make it more pleasant.
9250600	9252400	Like, what the fuck does that mean?
9252600	9254880	Not really anything perceptible.
9254880	9260560	And of course, the prop of the rapper soundtrack got released in Japan.
9260560	9264480	If some people who are in Japan right now, oh, wait, they're not in Japan anymore.
9264480	9265480	Never mind.
9266680	9270480	Yes, Spike, Spike is left and Christy is now on her way over here, so.
9270480	9273200	She's already over here.
9273200	9275520	So I was checking with Shane.
9275520	9284160	Well, I could go ahead and also speak of another thing.
9284160	9289800	That there's going to be free DLC for Super Bomberman R and that M2 is handling the Seiken
9289800	9294840	Densetsu port, so that's also good too, right?
9294840	9300080	Yeah, actually, that is great because those other ports they did were good.
9300080	9306640	I still want to know if they're going to re-translate Seiken Densetsu 3.
9306640	9308520	Did you hear about this, by the way, Jamie?
9308520	9310720	Seiken Densetsu collection on the Switch.
9310720	9314880	So it's one, two, and three, but it's only confirmed for Japan right now.
9314880	9317680	Well, it'd be nice if we got it over here.
9317680	9320160	I really like Seiken 3.
9320160	9322560	Of course, I also like Secret of Mana.
9322560	9325040	The later games were not so much.
9325040	9330480	Well, if you would like, I can also move on to one other story.
9330480	9333960	Yes, and just so you know, Shane is signing on Skype right now.
9333960	9335760	I guess they're done with Ranger Pride.
9335760	9340120	Just so you know, Captain Spike was in Japan, so they have not got to talk about the Power
9340120	9344280	Rangers movie yet, which is kind of a big fucking deal, the fact that there's a Power
9344280	9345280	Ranger.
9345280	9346280	Did you see the Power Rangers movie yet?
9346280	9347280	I want to.
9347280	9348280	It's not bad.
9348280	9349280	It's not bad.
9349280	9350280	Okay.
9350280	9351800	I'm starting to agree more with the people that are saying it should have just been a
9351800	9353360	CW TV show.
9353960	9359120	No, like for real, some of the CW TV shows are actually like, I really want to check
9359120	9360120	out Riverdale.
9360120	9368600	CW gave us Supernatural, which I stopped watching in season nine, and they're on season 11.
9368600	9370280	My God.
9370280	9373680	Can you make sure you have that email up from the person that was questioning?
9373680	9374680	I closed the email already.
9374680	9376320	Can you bring it back up real quick?
9376320	9377320	Sure.
9377320	9378320	Please?
9378320	9383120	Okay, because I'm going to get Shane on the line here on the show.
9383880	9386880	If I could.
9386880	9388560	All live radio, but you know what?
9388560	9389560	You won it.
9389560	9390560	You got it.
9390560	9391960	We're willing to give you what you need.
9391960	9392960	Hi, Shane.
9392960	9393960	You there?
9393960	9394960	Yeah.
9394960	9395960	How you doing?
9395960	9396960	Fine.
9396960	9397960	I'm just laying in bed.
9397960	9399960	Oh, I'm sorry to wake you.
9399960	9401080	I wasn't asleep.
9401080	9405920	I was typing up my thoughts on Mass Effect.
9405920	9408360	I bet you have a lot of thoughts on Mass Effect, actually.
9408360	9410680	Are you going to do an article for VOG?
9410680	9413000	You asked me or told me I should.
9413000	9414000	I don't know.
9414000	9417000	I'm just typing random things about it right now.
9417000	9418000	It's no pressure.
9418000	9421480	Okay, so we have an email this week in our mailbag, Shane, that you needed to hear.
9421480	9422920	So is Jamie ready to go with that?
9422920	9423920	Real quick.
9423920	9424920	Okay, here we go.
9424920	9427760	Given recent gaming and movie releases, I feel that we are missing someone's input.
9427760	9431040	Any chance Shane will chime in on the show tonight with his thoughts on Andromeda Power
9431040	9433000	Rangers or the Switch in Breath of Wild?
9433000	9437120	I know this seems a bit of an odd request, but I miss the sassy molassie, and that comes
9437120	9438120	from Ospher.
9438120	9439120	All right.
9439120	9444160	This is not sassy or molasses or whatever that was.
9444160	9445160	Maybe a little molasses.
9445160	9446160	Maybe a little bit.
9446160	9447160	All right.
9447160	9450960	So we actually are having a request for your take on this.
9450960	9454440	Now let me start with Power Rangers, because I'm sure you're going to talk about this on
9454440	9455440	Ranger Pride.
9455440	9460260	So I don't want to ruin this discussion too much, but give us the quick high-level take
9460260	9462080	on Power Rangers.
9462080	9463080	Hold on.
9463080	9466280	You have to keep stalling for time, because I'm switching to my headphones.
9466280	9467600	Oh, okay.
9467600	9468600	Well, I...
9468600	9474400	Rob, let's go to the movie theaters that have the cushy seats.
9474400	9475720	Actually Shane took me to those theaters.
9475720	9476720	They're really nice.
9476720	9479320	Well, I need to go and have someone watch that movie with me, because Dancer's Fuck
9479320	9480320	will go.
9480320	9481320	I will take you to see...
9481320	9482320	God, am I really going to see that again?
9482320	9483320	I want to go see...
9483320	9484320	Have Shane take you.
9484320	9485320	He'll go for the seventh time.
9485320	9486920	Shane, will you go see Power Rangers with me?
9486920	9487920	For a fifth time?
9487920	9488920	Of course I would.
9488920	9489920	Awesome.
9489920	9492240	And then you can take me to see Beauty and the Beast, because nobody will go with me
9492240	9493240	to see Beauty and the Beast.
9493240	9494240	Oh, I will go with you.
9494240	9495240	Thank you.
9495240	9496240	But I also need someone to go to see Logan with me.
9496240	9497240	I'm sorry.
9497880	9498880	Will you go see Beauty and the Beast, a date movie, Dark Sakura?
9498880	9502120	Well, it's not like we haven't had friend dates before.
9502120	9503120	Thank you.
9503120	9505720	Because Shane wouldn't go, because he said it's something I had to take Alan to.
9505720	9507480	That is exactly what I said.
9507480	9508480	That is correct.
9508480	9510440	I will be your platonic date.
9510440	9511440	Thank you.
9511440	9515520	See, you can recognize that you can just be friends and go, and it's fine.
9515520	9516520	Anyway.
9516520	9519760	So, Shane, Power Rangers, what's your quick take?
9519760	9520760	And then we'll make people listen to you.
9520760	9523640	Well, I've seen it four times already, and I just made plans to see it at fifth.
9523640	9527440	I don't really know if much else needs to be said.
9527440	9530400	All right, fair enough.
9530400	9532360	So stay tuned to Ranger Pride for the rest.
9532360	9533360	Okay.
9533360	9535800	Switch and Breath of the Wild.
9535800	9537400	I love my Switch.
9537400	9542680	Breath of the Wild is probably my favorite Zelda game, since I already beat it.
9542680	9544880	I didn't get everything in it.
9544880	9547560	But it's a really good game.
9547560	9551400	But the more I reflect on it, even though I still say it's my favorite Zelda game, the
9551400	9558080	more I realize that it feels like there's two hours of content in the entire game, and
9558080	9559080	that's really it.
9559080	9562080	But I played it for 60.
9562080	9563080	Interesting you put it that way.
9563080	9569080	Is that just because a big chunk of the game is just finding stuff and exploring, but the
9569080	9571720	game might lend itself really well to speedrunning?
9571720	9573280	Well, I think it does.
9573280	9576600	I think people are under an hour and beating it now.
9576600	9579480	And I think it's because it's all open world now.
9579480	9583920	You have kind of less of a path that you have to take.
9583920	9590440	And the stuff in between story points can be as long or as short as you really want
9590440	9591480	it to be.
9591480	9594680	For the record, the speedrun world record is at 45 minutes.
9594680	9595680	Yeah.
9595680	9596680	Naked.
9596680	9597680	So...
9597680	9598680	What?
9598680	9599680	Naked?
9599680	9600680	Like the speedrunner was naked?
9600680	9601680	The character.
9601680	9603680	He's running around in his shorts.
9603680	9606200	And yeah, because you really wouldn't be collecting any items, really.
9606200	9607200	I would think.
9607200	9608200	Yeah.
9608240	9613120	You get all of the first few shrines and then you can run on right to the castle.
9613120	9616760	I was like, what kind of speedrunning marathons are they doing these days?
9616760	9617760	Alright.
9617760	9620160	So, but you like the Switch overall system too?
9620160	9622160	Oh yeah, the Switch is fantastic.
9622160	9624920	I am so glad I have one.
9624920	9631320	And I think it's Nintendo's right step in the right direction for the first time in
9631320	9632320	a long time.
9632320	9633320	In terms of the consoles.
9633320	9636040	Can you try to give us the why?
9636040	9637680	Why?
9637680	9641200	Because it plays to both of their fanbases.
9641200	9646800	I'm more of a handheld person, so I can lay in bed and play my console game just laying
9646800	9647800	down in bed.
9647800	9648880	Or I can take it with me.
9648880	9653320	Whereas other people I know still only really use it as a TV device.
9653320	9655240	And so we get to do both things.
9655240	9660220	And now, for me, what's really cool, and I tried this out when they were doing it during
9660220	9666840	the test fire, is that you can, you know, for Splatoon 2.
9666840	9673880	I have the capability of making my phone a personal hotspot so I can make that a wireless
9673880	9678400	go-to for my Switch if I was on the go and play Splatoon online with people.
9678400	9680120	Yeah, that's gonna be awesome.
9680120	9683340	I'm looking forward to the, I know you don't do this stuff as much, but the convention
9683340	9687000	type stuff where there's gonna be like several people all with their Switches and we can
9687000	9691000	all kind of play a game of like Mario Kart or Splatoon or something.
9691000	9692000	Yeah.
9692000	9693760	Or Fast RMX, which is really good.
9693760	9695380	Or Bomberman, which is really good.
9695380	9699020	I heard they patched that, so I gotta try that again post-patch now.
9699020	9700820	And there's free DLC coming out.
9700820	9702140	Yeah, I heard about that.
9702140	9707460	I don't know, like somebody must have taken over Konami or something because Konami's
9707460	9710140	doing some weird stuff.
9710140	9713580	It's almost like they're on the shade button.
9713580	9716780	I accidentally closed that tab, all right, that was all right.
9716780	9719900	Okay, so now, all right, everybody get your chairs and your air mattresses.
9719900	9720900	Here we go.
9720900	9723180	Mass Effect Andromeda.
9723180	9724500	Is amazing.
9724500	9730020	And if I can be, you know, just a little bit critical for a second, like all the critics
9730020	9734860	that gave it low scores need to go fuck themselves because it's so good.
9734860	9737180	Okay, hold on, hold on.
9737180	9738180	I want you guys to...
9738180	9740380	You really shouldn't have shut that shade button down.
9740380	9741580	No, hold on, hold on, hold on.
9741580	9743660	You guys need to understand something.
9743660	9745500	Shane doesn't swear, like ever.
9745500	9749580	Unless I'm playing Overwatch or Splatoon or games.
9749580	9750580	Curse it, Splatoon.
9750580	9751580	No, here's the thing.
9751580	9753820	Like I'll be like, Shane, it's my birthday.
9753820	9755260	Just give me a good hearty fuck you.
9755260	9756900	And he'll be like, no, I don't swear.
9756900	9757900	I don't do that.
9757900	9761740	Do you see that Shane just very casually dropped the F bomb there.
9761740	9762740	So he made it.
9762740	9765540	And now I have it on tape.
9765540	9766540	That's the best part of this.
9766540	9767540	That's what you can use.
9767540	9771140	You can use that for the voice pack for Call of Duty.
9771140	9773860	Yes, exactly, exactly.
9773860	9774860	So okay.
9774860	9775860	Wow.
9775860	9779580	So I just want to say when Shane tells somebody to go fuck themselves, he means it.
9779580	9782900	So you are not happy with the critics here.
9783540	9786480	I don't understand like at all.
9786480	9793140	It feels like now that I'm done with the game for now, it feels like Mass Effect 1 where
9793140	9798540	the game starts off slow, but you know, most Bioware starting stories do.
9798540	9801500	And then it ramps up incredibly.
9801500	9806220	And by the end, like every 10 minutes, my mind was being blown left and right.
9806220	9807700	I was like, oh my God, this is so good.
9807700	9809140	I don't want it to end.
9809140	9816820	And I legit got sad when it was over as like, I need DLC now I need my plans for I need
9816820	9819820	to hear about the plans for Andromeda 2.
9819820	9821300	Like I can't do this.
9821300	9825420	I just spent 75 hours on this game because that's what my total time said.
9825420	9831100	With 96% complete, I'm like, I just need more like now.
9831100	9836420	Do you think the ramp up or the I guess because the game has a bit of a slower ramp up I guess
9836420	9841020	and the fact that EA did that, I don't think it did like, I think that's wrong too.
9841020	9845720	I don't think it has a slow ramp up like compared to other EA games.
9845720	9850360	When Mass Effect, you go play Mass Effect 1 right now and you tell me besides the fact
9850360	9855180	that you're shooting guns in the first 10 minutes of the game, basically how quick that
9855180	9859740	ramp up was, it wasn't at all.
9859740	9863860	Well you do meet the antagonist on the first planet and you get a squad member shot in
9863860	9867660	the first five minutes that you think is going to be with you the whole game.
9867660	9868660	I mean, you do.
9868660	9869660	I don't remember.
9869660	9871100	They look like fodder to me.
9871100	9872100	Yeah, well, whatever.
9872100	9873100	All right, whatever.
9873100	9874100	All right.
9874100	9875100	Um, let's see.
9875100	9876100	What else I want to ask you about Mass Effect.
9876100	9878580	I mean, we already spent a lot of time talking about tonight, so I don't want to spend too
9878580	9879580	much time.
9879580	9885140	Oh, I know we Gabe and I were mentioning before, um, that whole sequence in the vault, uh, in
9885140	9888640	the very, very first vault, and I'm trying to try to say a little spoiler free, but there's
9888640	9890780	an escape sequence in that first vault.
9890780	9891780	Right.
9891780	9895420	And I just thought that that was the moment when the game really started to like pick
9895420	9896420	up the pace.
9896420	9899940	And that was just, that was just like a graphically stunning that whole vault and everything was
9899940	9900940	really stunning scene.
9900940	9904140	And then the kind of like the way they did that scene and the pressure that's on you
9904140	9905140	in that scene.
9905140	9907420	Um, it was like really, really good.
9907420	9911140	And I guess that's the point where the demo cut off, right?
9911140	9916380	That's before the demo or sorry, that's after the demo cut off the demo cuts off right before
9916380	9917540	you actually enter the vault.
9917540	9921300	See, that's why I thought that demo did the game of disservice too, because I don't, you
9921340	9924740	don't think there was a shift kind of when that whole sequence started?
9924740	9932220	No, cause I really, until you get all your squad mates and kind of establish what's going
9932220	9938060	on in this galaxy, I feel like that's all ramp up to me.
9938060	9943040	And so that, that, that probably takes a good 20, 30 hours if you're doing side quests and
9943040	9944580	stuff like that.
9944580	9948700	And so, yeah, I just, I don't understand.
9948700	9950520	It's my favorite game of the year already.
9950520	9957120	When I beat resident evil sevens, finally something did so Zelda wasn't number one already.
9957120	9960600	Like when I beat Zelda, I already put it under resident evil cause like resident evil seven
9960600	9962680	was way better than Zelda.
9962680	9969560	So no, now Mass Effect is taking the top honors and I don't see anything taking that away.
9969560	9973360	Um, quickly, we've talked about Mass Effect a lot tonight, so I want to move on.
9973360	9974680	That's all I like to talk about.
9974680	9975680	I know, I know.
9975680	9976960	I'll give you one more thing.
9976960	9979000	The multiplayer, nobody's talking about multiplayer.
9979000	9980000	Do you have any quick takes on multiplayer?
9980600	9987680	It's like multiplayer from three except you can jump around and it leads to some pretty
9987680	9990480	hilarious situations.
9990480	9995000	Like when you're, there's one time I was playing and this guy died, but he was on the other
9995000	9999920	side of the map and my roommate was watching me play and the way I got to him, I was just
9999920	10003840	like, cause I'm a vanguard and if you don't know what that is, I don't care.
10003840	10009200	But I was charging across the map to an enemy and then once I hit the enemy, my focus wasn't
10009200	10010200	on the enemy.
10010200	10011200	It was just to get me over there.
10011200	10016160	And then I jumped and I dashed to the side like sideways and then I charged another enemy
10016160	10019640	that was directly in front of me and then I just dashed without jumping to the other
10019640	10025400	side and I got to the, to the squad mate and my roommate was like, wow, that looked very
10025400	10026400	like planned.
10026400	10031040	I was like, well, I knew what I had to do, but yeah, it looked very fluid and like kind
10031040	10032200	of cinematic almost.
10032200	10033800	It was really neat.
10033800	10039280	And the difficulty versus Mass Effect 3 for multiplayer, I think is no joke.
10039280	10045880	Like I think this is a much harder multiplayer, whatever you want to call it, like just much
10045880	10049560	harder than what Mass Effect 3 was even on bronze difficulty.
10049560	10051040	All right.
10051040	10055600	Any other games you want to quickly give a shout out to while you're here?
10055600	10058040	With the Switch, I finally got to play Shovel Knight.
10058040	10062560	I had not touched, I've never played Shovel Knight until then and I think it's an amazing
10062560	10067360	game and if it had come out this year, I probably would put it on my top list as well, but I
10067360	10070320	can't because it came out like three years ago or whatever.
10070320	10073960	You could retroactively change your list from 2014 or whatever.
10073960	10074960	Nope.
10074960	10075960	Nope.
10075960	10076960	That's cheating.
10076960	10077960	Okay.
10077960	10078960	All right.
10078960	10079960	Fair enough.
10079960	10081440	Everybody, if you want to hear more of Shane's opinions on things like the Power Rangers
10081440	10084280	movie, check out Ranger Pride available.
10084280	10088520	VOG Network.com has the latest episodes and of course they also air here Wednesdays and
10088520	10089520	Fridays.
10090480	10093480	Because Gabe and Brie are here tonight promoting the indie arcade event, is there any chance
10093480	10096080	you're going to come out on Saturday and maybe say hi?
10096080	10097360	I don't know.
10097360	10101200	I feel like I might have something that day, like sleeping.
10101200	10102200	Boo.
10102200	10103200	Boo.
10103200	10104200	I know I'm terrible.
10104200	10105200	Yell at him.
10105200	10106200	No.
10106200	10107200	All right.
10107200	10110240	Or you know what, I might start my next playthrough of Mass Effect now that I have to chart out
10110240	10113560	how to get 100% and all the choices I want to make.
10113560	10114560	All right.
10114560	10115560	We didn't want you there anyway.
10115560	10116560	All right.
10116560	10117560	I didn't want you there.
10117560	10118560	All right.
10118600	10119600	All right.
10119600	10120600	Shane, take care.
10120600	10121600	Bye.
10121600	10122600	Bye.
10122600	10123600	All right.
10123600	10124600	We'll go ahead and open up the Skype line.
10124600	10127320	I think it's probably a good segue for us to take some more calls.
10127320	10129000	So we'll try to fit in a couple more calls here.
10129000	10131400	Orange Lounge, are you okay over there, Brie?
10131400	10132560	Don't take him seriously.
10132560	10133560	He's just a...
10133560	10134560	Yeah.
10134560	10135560	All right.
10135560	10136560	Orange Lounge Radio.
10136560	10141120	All one word on Skype if you want to give us a call or 1-877-GAME-OLR if you want to
10141120	10143440	do it the old fashioned way.
10143440	10144680	And of course, Gabe and Brie are here as well.
10144680	10148040	If you have any questions about game development, tonight is a great night for those types of
10148040	10149040	fans.
10149040	10151920	I do want to give a couple of quick shout outs here before we jump right into the phone
10151920	10154520	lines with some news.
10154520	10158080	Speaking of game development, how many y'all out there using Unity?
10158080	10159080	Use Unity for yourself?
10159080	10160600	I am, as a matter of fact.
10160600	10161600	You hear about this?
10161600	10168180	5.6 Unity is going to be bringing native Nintendo Switch support into Unity.
10168180	10171240	So obviously, Nintendo Switch is a new opportunity for folks.
10171240	10172240	There's already...
10172240	10174640	Now, Unity can already support Nintendo Switch.
10174640	10177060	Super Bomberman, Snipperclips.
10177060	10182540	Those were already on Unity, but there's going to be more support, or native support
10182540	10185480	I guess, for Nintendo Switch available with Unity.
10185480	10189140	These other games were created on an older version of Unity, which was not native, but
10189140	10191300	that's just going to make it easier.
10191300	10192300	Very much.
10192300	10194300	So that's going to be awesome.
10194300	10196020	All right.
10196020	10197020	Let's see.
10197020	10200660	That is what's happening with Unity, 5.6.
10200660	10201700	Let's go to the phones.
10201700	10203100	It's lighting up right now.
10203100	10204100	Let's take a call.
10204100	10205100	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
10205100	10206100	Who's this?
10206140	10207140	Hi, this is Reed.
10207140	10209620	Sorry, got a little feedback there.
10209620	10210620	This is Reed Junior.
10210620	10211620	Hey, buddy.
10211620	10212620	What's on your mind tonight?
10212620	10213620	Not much.
10213620	10218220	I'll try to make this short and sweet, because your show is already running as long as it
10218220	10219220	is.
10219220	10220220	Well, you know.
10220220	10227300	Yeah, actually, I was going to call in about some sales that I've noticed that I think
10227300	10231100	a lot of your listeners may like to know about.
10231100	10232100	Wait.
10232100	10233100	I got to ask you.
10233100	10234100	Wait, wait, wait.
10234100	10235700	Because you're all up on all this stuff.
10235700	10236860	Here's the one I really want to know about.
10236860	10243540	I heard something that GOG.com was taking old CD serial keys, and you could put them
10243540	10244540	in GOG.com.
10244540	10246900	Is that true, or is that an April Fool's joke?
10246900	10250340	Yes and no.
10250340	10254840	There's a very limited selection of games that you can do that with.
10254840	10258700	I can't remember all that is included.
10258700	10266580	I think at least one or two of the old stalker games you can do that with.
10266580	10270460	But like I say, it's very, very limited.
10270460	10274120	That's better than a sale, because that's getting to use something I already own from
10274120	10276220	like ten years ago.
10276220	10277220	That's awesome.
10277220	10279500	I just want to make sure I was out there.
10279500	10286980	What's even better is that I think your show is mentioned before some time ago, but last
10286980	10293380	year they introduced a service called GOG Connect, where you tie your Steam account
10293380	10300780	to your GOG account, and every so often if they can work out deals with the publisher,
10300780	10306340	if you've got such and such game on Steam, you get the GOG version for free.
10306340	10311020	Yeah, I had that happen with something I own, so that was pretty cool.
10311020	10319540	But even that they haven't done a whole lot lately, it kind of comes and goes in spurts.
10319540	10324900	You'll more likely see something happen with that right around the time they have the major
10324900	10327220	seasonal sales.
10327220	10329060	I steered you off course a little bit.
10329060	10332260	What sale did you want to talk about tonight?
10332260	10337780	Unfortunately these sales that I'm about to mention are probably going to be expiring
10337780	10338780	on Monday.
10338780	10341660	Well god damn it, Rage Nator, what am I going to do with that?
10341660	10348020	Well, unfortunately those that catch the show on the podcast, sorry guys.
10348020	10349300	Let's hear about everything you missed.
10349300	10353900	Let's hear about all these great deals that you fucking missed because you're not here
10353900	10354900	live.
10354900	10368740	Yeah, but they had sales on some of the adventure games, like the best series, they had sales
10368740	10378580	and in fact I picked up like the original missed Riven, the sequel and missed five over
10378580	10386020	the past year or two, right off the bat right there, they, hang on I'm going to have to
10386020	10391500	look at my account real quick to tell you exactly everything that is or has been on
10391500	10392500	sale.
10392500	10404140	In fact, they had the Deponia games on sale, the Broken Sword series on sale, Back to the
10404140	10407540	Future Walking Dead games were on sale.
10407540	10408540	Oh there you go.
10408540	10413780	I bet Bree would be, if Bree liked the Wolf Among Us and those other Telltale games just
10413780	10417020	a matter of time before he gets sucked into all the rest of them too, Telltale's got a
10417020	10418020	pretty good formula.
10418020	10426100	Walking the Wolf Among Us was one of the games that's on sale and even LucasArts games like
10426100	10433220	Day of the Tentacle, yes, in fact I picked that up so, I mean.
10433220	10437220	Here's the thing, if you're like, well gee this doesn't do me any good because it's already
10437220	10441500	Monday and I'm listening on the podcast feed, here's what you all need to do, you all got
10441500	10445980	smart phones, whether you got Android, whether you got iPhone, whether you have a Microsoft
10445980	10452660	phone I guess, they all have calendars, so you need to set yourself a reminder like every
10452660	10456820	Sunday morning or something, like if Sunday morning for you is at one in the afternoon
10456820	10464460	then fine, set yourself a reminder, check Steam Store, check GOG, check whatever stores
10464460	10467940	you shop on, you gotta set yourself a little reminder because otherwise you're gonna miss
10467940	10468940	shit.
10468940	10469940	Because all the good deals are on the weekend.
10469940	10476340	Yeah, I was gonna say, yes, I realize that a lot of people out there have the jobs to
10476340	10484660	go to, plus they have to worry about family obligations, etc., etc., etc., therefore
10484660	10490300	you can't spend as much time on the computer as I do.
10490300	10498180	That being said, if at all possible, do pretty much like what you suggested, like pick up
10498180	10509900	a date and time during the week, let's say for example, Saturday at noon, check the storefronts
10509900	10522860	on both services, then of course, one thing I tend to follow for information on free giveaways
10522860	10533060	is this one site, it's kind of a news aggregate for free giveaways, it's called EpicBundle.com,
10533060	10545460	in fact, I even follow them on Facebook and they'll let me know, origins giveaway, need
10545460	10552820	for speed for free, here's a link to it, you can grab that, or no, Steam's giving away
10552860	10558100	the walking dead for free, you can grab that here.
10558100	10562860	So I love this, comments in chat over at live.foggenetware.com, actdef says, Ragenator just needs to work
10562860	10568420	for CheapAssGamer at this point, Hitstun says, I watch the slick deals front page RSS feed,
10568420	10569780	but that's not just for games.
10569780	10575380	And these are both good tips, get a Twitter account if you don't already have one, and
10575380	10579420	follow some of these, like CheapAssGamer, that's their bread and butter is following
10579420	10583820	this type of stuff, and there's other well-known Twitter people out there that like to tweet
10583820	10588660	about the sales and so forth, so get a Twitter account, that's a good way to stay on top
10588660	10595780	of this stuff too, just don't follow creepos, but you can follow us at OLR, you can follow
10595780	10600540	me, my personal account, at Skye, S-K-I-E, I really want to get at Rob Roberts, but a
10600540	10603740	fucking spammer has that right now, so if y'all can report him, I'd appreciate that,
10603740	10608860	you can follow DarkSakura as well, you can follow Nascent Games, and Bree, you're on
10608860	10612700	Twitter as well, right, is that a personal or a business, can I give that out here?
10612700	10613700	I'm all out there.
10613700	10615700	You're all out there, Bree, A-E-A.
10615700	10616700	Yes.
10616700	10617700	There it is.
10617700	10618700	And follow Sack Indie Arcade.
10618700	10619700	Yes!
10619700	10624420	You guys, it's really easy, because you guys are really good at like retweeting all your
10624420	10627100	stuff, so like once you follow one, you'll get all the others.
10627100	10628100	Yes.
10628100	10629100	Yeah, so it's very easy, very easy.
10629100	10632060	All right, Rage Nator, I gotta let you go, so we can get more calls.
10632060	10634140	Sure, have a nice night.
10634140	10635140	You too, take care, buddy.
10635140	10636140	Yep, you too.
10636140	10637140	Bye.
10637140	10640620	All right, everybody in chat room giving out their Twitter handles there.
10640620	10645780	All right, let's see if we, we can probably squeeze in one more call, Orange Launch Radio,
10645780	10649580	all one word on Skype, or 1-877-GAME-OLR.
10649580	10654540	I wanted to make sure we talked about some movies here before we end the show tonight.
10654540	10657980	For one, I know, well it's Bummer, Loki's not here, because I know he's looking forward
10657980	10662620	to this, but the Ready Player One film is gonna be coming out in 2018, the new release
10662620	10666560	date is March 30th, 2018, for Ready Player One.
10666560	10671180	That is a pushback, it was originally going to be this Christmas, December 15th, in time
10671180	10676780	for the Christmas season, however, if it had not moved, it would have been going up against
10676780	10678320	Episode 8.
10678320	10685040	Yeah, so, by the way, Warcraft movie did the same thing, it had to retreat into March because
10685040	10686040	of Episode 7.
10686040	10690540	It should have kept retreating, but anyway, well, yeah, it didn't, it didn't, it worked
10690540	10691540	so well.
10691540	10692540	I liked it.
10692540	10694520	Yeah, there were, honestly, I didn't hate the Warcraft movie, I really didn't.
10694520	10697280	I was expecting to really dislike it, but I was like, it actually really wasn't that
10697280	10698280	bad.
10698280	10700640	I just, I think they just marketed it wrong.
10700640	10702280	I don't know how it's definitely what they did.
10702280	10704320	I think they just really marketed it wrong.
10704320	10710520	But anyway, Ready Player One will hopefully do well in 2018, on March 30th.
10710520	10715780	Last call for calls at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word, on Skype.
10715780	10721160	But the other big movie, and I know y'all are excited for this, Wreck-It Ralph 2 has
10721160	10728080	its official subtitle, it's called Wreck-It Ralph 2, Ralph Breaks the Internet, Starting
10728080	10729080	with Twitter.
10729080	10733360	No, I'm sorry, I threw that in there myself, but we're just kind of hoping that's where
10733360	10734360	he'll start.
10734360	10737360	No, I just, I loved, there's a lot of great stuff under, there's a lot of stuff I really
10737360	10740260	love on Twitter, and people I've really come to know and appreciate on Twitter, but there's
10740260	10742240	a lot of fuckheads on Twitter too.
10742240	10743240	Yes.
10743240	10746320	So, it's just, I hope Wreck-It Ralph comes out and is like, I'm gonna wreck it, and takes
10746320	10752200	all those egg icons and just, or the Mr. Creeper, Ms. Creeper icons.
10752200	10755120	He takes the egg icons, put them in a blender, and has a protein shake.
10755120	10756120	That's right.
10756120	10757120	That's right.
10757120	10758120	So, there you go.
10758120	10761760	Maybe that'll hit, it's Fix It Felix will fix Twitter.
10761760	10765840	If you know, I, what was the tweet I wrote earlier this week, because y'all know I get
10765840	10771600	sassy on Twitter sometimes, there was a tweet I wrote that said something like, congratulations
10771600	10777620	Twitter on removing the at replies so that, you know, now you have more characters.
10777620	10780720	Could you next work on removing cyberbullying and abuse?
10780720	10781720	I saw that.
10781720	10782720	That was, that was glorious.
10782720	10786880	Honestly, I feel like every, I feel like that's a recycled joke, that like I used that exact
10786880	10789760	same joke the last feature, Twitter, unveiled.
10789760	10794920	It's like, so how long until we get, anyway.
10794920	10795920	Let's see.
10795920	10799180	In chat, they're also talking about movies in chat, Tigerclaw says, anyone see Ghost
10799180	10800520	in the Shell this weekend?
10800520	10803620	I thought it was good, but it didn't do well at the box office.
10803620	10808120	Number three with 19 million, Beauty and the Beast at number two with 47 million.
10808120	10810040	Do you know what movie was number one?
10810040	10812700	And I'm sorry, this movie looked awful.
10812700	10816360	The boss, not the Power Rangers, that movie was good.
10816360	10817360	The Boss Baby.
10817360	10818360	Seriously?
10818360	10823540	And fucking talking baby movies, it's all those families and shit.
10823540	10824720	Did you see Get Out?
10824720	10826120	No, I really want to.
10826120	10827360	It was so good.
10827360	10828360	I would see that again.
10828360	10831240	Even though I know exactly what's going to happen now?
10831240	10832960	We need to go on movie dates like every night this week.
10832960	10833960	Double feature.
10833960	10834960	We're going to see Power Rangers.
10834960	10836920	We're going to say, you can't theater hop at the new theaters.
10836920	10837920	Did you know that?
10837920	10838920	It's impossible to theater hop.
10838920	10843360	Because I actually overheard them saying, they were talking to some kids that they ejected
10843360	10846540	and they said, we have sensors in the seats and we sell them by the seats.
10846540	10849920	And so if a seat is being sat in that we didn't sell, we know.
10849920	10850920	And I was like-
10850920	10851920	That's right, because you picked the seats.
10851920	10852920	You picked the seats when you were by the tickets.
10852920	10855880	They fucking solved the problem with theater hopping.
10855880	10856880	Those smart assholes.
10856880	10857880	Unless you sit in the aisle.
10858400	10860400	I guess we're still on the ground.
10860400	10861400	Hell no.
10861400	10862400	We won't go.
10862400	10863400	All right.
10863400	10864400	Anyway.
10864400	10865400	See, I don't know about that.
10865400	10868840	Because when Monet and I went to see Get Out, there were these people that were totally
10868840	10870960	sitting in the wrong seats and no one ejected them.
10870960	10871960	Oh, interesting.
10871960	10872960	So.
10872960	10873960	Maybe.
10873960	10874960	Because they weren't kids.
10874960	10875960	Anyway.
10875960	10876960	All right.
10876960	10877960	Nobody else is calling in on Skype line.
10877960	10878960	So I guess that's going to do it.
10878960	10881520	I guess, you know, WrestleMania and people went to bed, whatever.
10881520	10882520	But you can always email us.
10882520	10885080	Participate at OrangeLoungeTradio.com.
10885080	10887480	You can also, well, it is after midnight on the East Coast.
10888080	10891760	You can also send us a tweet at OLR.
10891760	10895680	So we do read them to ourselves even if we don't always read them on air.
10895680	10897660	Because there's just a lot of other stuff.
10897660	10899240	So I always get lost on Twitter.
10899240	10900320	But I do read everything.
10900320	10901760	I'll heart your tweets.
10901760	10902840	I do.
10902840	10904640	So I like hearting tweets.
10904640	10906160	I read it and I liked it.
10906160	10907160	Thank you very much.
10907160	10908160	All right.
10908160	10909160	Ah.
10909160	10910160	We've got to wrap up tonight.
10910160	10911160	Gabe.
10911160	10912160	Bree.
10912160	10913160	Thank you guys so much for being here.
10913160	10914160	It's always fun to have you guys here.
10914160	10915160	You guys are so much fun.
10915160	10916160	Thank you.
10916160	10917160	Thank you guys.
10917840	10918840	I'm so grateful for this.
10918840	10919840	I'm so looking forward to Saturday.
10919840	10922120	I know you guys are working your little tushies off.
10922120	10926080	And I know things are going to go wrong and it's going to feel like the end of the world.
10926080	10927400	But you know what?
10927400	10929120	You guys are doing such a great thing for Sacramento.
10929120	10931680	Remember, nobody's going to notice the little shit.
10931680	10935680	Somebody's not going to show, you know, something weird is going to happen, but don't worry
10935680	10936680	about it.
10936680	10937680	It's going to be OK.
10937680	10938680	That's right.
10938680	10942360	Do them yoga exercises Saturday morning.
10942360	10943360	Let it out.
10943360	10944360	Shake it off.
10944360	10946120	Let it go.
10946120	10947120	Let it go.
10948080	10950080	Or the Taylor Swift song.
10950080	10951080	Shake it off.
10951080	10952080	Shake it off.
10952080	10953080	All right.
10953080	10955000	But you guys are going to have a fantastic event Saturday.
10955000	10957280	I'm so looking forward to it.
10957280	10958760	And then we can start talking about 2018.
10958760	10959760	Hell yeah.

10995160	10999240	We didn't talk about that tonight, but there's an after party and it's going to get lit in
10999240	11004760	South Sac because the after party, I don't know how y'all plan this, the after party
11004760	11008680	is next door to Rocky Horror, which I'm hosting.
11008680	11011520	So yeah, I got to somehow do both.
11011520	11014600	I'm going to be in both places at the same time.
11014600	11017320	We recommend the after party for the 18 and up.
11017320	11023240	Well, yes, this place also serves alcohol and Shane, maybe they're saying the F word
11023240	11024240	at people.
11024240	11025240	Bring it, Shane.
11025240	11026240	Yeah.

11028240	11029240	Looking forward to it.
11029240	11030880	Best of luck with the event and everything.
11030880	11031880	I'm so excited.
11031880	11032880	Thank you.
11032880	11035040	Gabe, any plugs you'd like to give?
11035040	11036040	No, no.
11036040	11037040	Yeah.
11037040	11040360	I mean, the main thing is primarily, as Brianna said, you know, in the arcade coming up that,
11040360	11045680	you know, the Saturday, you know, ticket prices will be $10 for the rest of the week.
11045680	11049240	He goes up on the day of, so it goes up to 15.
11049240	11050240	Don't procrastinate.
11050240	11051240	Yeah, do not procrastinate.
11051240	11055040	Sacramento, you're so addicted to complacency.
11055040	11056040	Stop it.
11056040	11057040	So be sure to come through.
11057040	11058040	Yeah.
11058040	11059040	Get your tickets early.
11059040	11064520	If you lived here long enough and you followed the Kings at all, you know, you're always
11064520	11068360	going to get fucked in the last quarter.
11068360	11072240	That is so, that is the greatest thing I have heard this entire weekend.
11072240	11076160	So do not wait until the last quarter because you're going to get beat.
11076160	11077160	Yeah.
11077160	11078160	Or fouled out.
11078160	11079160	Anyways.
11079160	11080160	So yeah.
11080160	11082280	So yeah, definitely come through, you know, definitely come through for that.
11082280	11087960	It's going to be another very inspirational event, very memorable event.
11087960	11088960	Yeah.
11088960	11093500	And then, you know, with the, with joking earlier about Crumple, Crumple will be out
11093500	11094760	this month.
11094760	11096560	Crossing Fingers this month.
11096560	11100020	I've had to push it back a little bit just because, you know, again, it's just one other
11100020	11104520	guy and myself and, and I'm working on Kinship and I'm working on my, you know, other stuff.
11104520	11107560	If you don't make it, you can always just say April Fools.
11107560	11108560	Right.
11108560	11109560	Next year.
11109560	11110560	Yeah.
11110560	11111560	But yeah.
11111840	11114840	It's going to be another club.
11114840	11115840	Yeah.
11115840	11119840	So, um, but yeah, if you, if you're following me on Twitter, uh, check out my Twitter page
11119840	11124280	and you'll be able to see on the pinch tweet how to pre-order Crumple again, it's just
11124280	11129920	$1 for the pre-order $2 when it comes out, uh, episode two is already in the works.
11129920	11134600	So, um, yeah, there's going to be, there's a lot of stuff happening this year.

11140480	11142000	We'll be back again before the next event.
11142000	11145520	There's always some reason to have our pals on the show here, another event coming up
11145520	11146520	or something like that.
11146520	11149120	So, uh, keep in touch XOXO hearts.
11149120	11150120	All right.

11151120	11152120	We'll see you soon.
11152120	11153120	We'll see you Saturday.
11153120	11155920	We'll be broadcasting live, but please come up to the black box and say hi on air at some
11155920	11156920	point.
11156920	11157920	Of course.
11157920	11158920	Of course.
11158920	11162320	Um, real quick before we officially sign off, I want to say, of course, as always, uh, thank
11162320	11163960	you very much for checking out our show.
11163960	11167960	Uh, we appreciate if you could help us spread the word, tell a friend or five or 20 about
11167960	11171840	the show, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but, uh, without the voices
11171840	11172920	here, we can't hear them.
11172920	11176360	Uh, we don't, uh, we don't really put ads in the show.
11176360	11178120	We don't really make a lot of money off doing this stuff.
11178120	11179360	We just do it for the fun of it.
11179360	11183420	Uh, that also means we don't have a big multimillion dollar website backing us up or anything like
11183420	11184420	that.
11184420	11186200	Um, so, you know, we, we need, we need help.
11186200	11187200	We need word of mouth.
11187200	11192160	So, uh, a nice five star review on a place like iTunes or Google podcasts or wherever
11192160	11196920	it is that you found this show, that stuff all goes a very long way as well.
11196920	11203480	I look to my left ever and always calamity, Jamie and her final thought tonight resist.
11203480	11208400	And my final thought tonight is peeps.
11208400	11209400	Goodnight everybody.
11209400	11212000	We will see you in seven days.
11212000	11213880	Thank you so much girl.
11213880	11217640	Um, why that's it?
11217640	11218640	We're done.
11218640	11219640	We're out of here.
11219640	11220640	Well, actually, no, we won't see you.
11220640	11221640	We won't see you in seven days.
11221640	11228200	Six days at the second, the arcade event, and then we'll see you, uh, like eight days
11228200	11229200	after that.
11229200	11230200	Cause we won't be here live next Sunday.
11230200	11234200	So everybody have a good week off, uh, support Bobby, who I think will still be alive that
11234200	11238840	night and all those indie podcasts and hardworking individuals out there.
11238840	11239840	Have a great night, everybody.
11239840	11240840	Bye.
