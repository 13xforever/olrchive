Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki!

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Tonight we talk indie gaming with our friends from the Sacramento IGBA as well as discuss big moves in the gaming industry this week as you all gear up for Persona 5 on another week with a show where every gamer has a voice.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Orange Lounge Radio

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with our 682nd episode for this April the 2nd of 2017 and that's no joke.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
My name is Rob Roberts here with you in studio as always.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Look, April Fools was yesterday. I am playing with y'all today. We got too big a show tonight to be doing any jokes.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
If only people were as cautious every day as they are on April Fools Day.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Hello Calamity Jamie. Welcome to the show. Remember that's my new favorite name for you.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
God.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
DarkSakura or Jamie Summers or Calamity Jamie. How are you?

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Ugh.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It makes me think. It's not only just the Ganon thing but I also think of like Calamity Jane like the Wild West sort of thing.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Like she's an outlaw who don't give a fuck. Like that whole type of thing. So I think it's fitting.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And you need cowboy boots.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
No.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Alright. How are you though otherwise?

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I haven't owned a pair of cowboy boots since I was 10.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Are you feeling better?

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I am but it might be drugs. No I'm serious.

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Legal. Legal. Legal. Prescribed.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Drugs are bad.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Hi Gabe.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
No they're good drugs.

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
We'll get to you in a minute.

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm on good drugs.

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
He can't help himself.

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I got a shot in the hip of Toradol.

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
What is that?

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It's like ibuprofen but liquid and it lasts for a couple of days.

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So it's kind of nice just not hurting for a little while.

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
But I also don't know if I passed the kidney stone or not.

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I would think it would be pretty obvious.

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I think it would be obvious and I still have the other non-painful symptoms so whatever.

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Alright well hopefully you are.

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It's like I can't get a break.

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Hopefully this all passes quickly.

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Cause I'm still on round. Oh jeez Rob.

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
That was a pun.

41
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
No more cookies for you.

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Alright.

43
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm gonna take this peeps back.

44
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Not here tonight.

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Tech master Loki.

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
There was a medical issue in Loki's family just a couple hours ago.

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm told that it's not like I'm probably making it sound way more serious than it is.

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
But they just you know he had to go take care of business.

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
He's actually watching the kids right now cause Nellie had to go take care of the other business.

50
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So just thoughts with everybody that everything's going okay.

51
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
But we do have to be a little more impromptu tonight.

52
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Cause we actually we have our whole little show thing ready for Loki to be here.

53
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And unfortunately he couldn't be here obviously for those obvious reasons.

54
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So people need.

55
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
What is the curse of Orange Launch Radio this year?

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Jesus do you guys.

57
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I don't know if you know this.

58
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
My mom had surgery this week.

59
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
She had a knee replacement surgery on Wednesday.

60
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
How's she recovering?

61
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
She's fine.

62
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I just went and saw her today.

63
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So she's good.

64
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
But she was asking.

65
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I don't know why she asked me about this.

66
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
She was asking about Richard Simmons.

67
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Because Richard Simmons.

68
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
There was an article about.

69
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Yeah it's in People right.

70
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And so my mom.

71
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
That's the person that's still subscribing to People Magazine is my mom.

72
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So she was asking about the podcast.

73
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So I actually got out her iPad mini and I subscribed to missing Richard Simmons.

74
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
On her iPad.

75
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
By the way I want to point something else out.

76
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
My mother was not subscribed to Orange Launch Radio.

77
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So you know I subscribed her to that too.

78
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Even though I don't know if she should be hearing this but.

79
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Hi Rob's mom.

80
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Hi.

81
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Hope you're feeling better.

82
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I still think we should call my mom sometime.

83
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
We should.

84
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
We have before.

85
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's been years.

86
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Yeah.

87
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Once.

88
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And then she said told the story about condensation.

89
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Oh my God.

90
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
All right.

91
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Do you remember what episode number that was?

92
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Because.

93
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I don't remember what episode number this one is.

94
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
682.

95
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
682.

96
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
OK.

97
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Whatever.

98
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
All right.

99
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Anyway.

100
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
So not here tonight.

101
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Techmaster Loki.

102
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
We'll see him in a couple of weeks.

103
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
We're actually not going to be here live next week.

104
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Because we're going to be very busy on Saturday.

105
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And that's thanks to our special in-studio guests.

106
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I want to welcome back to the show some old friends now of Orange Launch Radio.

107
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
They've been here enough times that we can call them old friends.

108
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Friends of the show.

109
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Duh.

110
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Say hello to Gabe from Sacramento IGDA.

111
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Ladies first.

112
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Oh and his partner in business crime.

113
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Bree.

114
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Hi.

115
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Hi.

116
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Except everything is legal.

117
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
There's no actual crimes being committed.

118
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Just to be clear.

119
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Allegedly.

120
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
That we know of.

121
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
That we know of.

122
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
All right.

123
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
And crickets enter the room.

124
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
All right.

125
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
So.

126
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Sacramento IGDA.

127
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You guys are putting on this big event in West Sacramento.

128
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
This coming Saturday.

129
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Give us the elevator pitch.

130
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
The 60 second pitch that I'm sure you've had to give 5,000 times this week.

131
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Mister, my dad said he saw you on Good Day Sacramento.

132
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
And all this stuff.

133
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
By the way.

134
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
That was another thing.

135
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Oh I saw some guy on Good Day Sacramento.

136
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I don't remember his name but he was talking about this indie game thing.

137
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
If it was a guy it was Gabe.

138
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
If it was a gal it was Bree.

139
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It was one of them.

140
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
So.

141
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Give us the 60 second pitch you've been giving all over the town.

142
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Oh.

143
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
There's no.

144
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
There's never consistency with my message.

145
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It's just.

146
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It comes down to one thing.

147
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
This is our fourth annual event.

148
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
And it is.

149
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Sac and the Arcade is a celebration of independent game development here in Sacramento.

150
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
And really spreading wildly throughout the region, the valley.

151
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And beyond that.

152
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
And it is.

153
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
The core purpose of the second arcade is essentially.

154
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You're gonna play.

155
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You're gonna learn.

156
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
And you're gonna be inspired.

157
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
By what you.

158
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You know from both playing and learning.

159
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
The idea here is that we don't have a job market here.

160
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
We didn't have a job market for game development period.

161
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
EA is here.

162
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
We don't know what they're doing.

163
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And they're not making an impact at all within our community.

164
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
And that's fine.

165
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It's all secrets.

166
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Of course.

167
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It's all secrets.

168
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It's one brick wall with windows and they're outside an alleged pizzeria.

169
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Next door to the gay bar.

170
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Right.

171
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
True story.

172
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
True story.

173
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Yeah.

174
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Right next door to faces.

175
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Next door to faces.

176
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
So that's convenient.

177
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
We camped out right by that building.

178
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I didn't even realize it was their building until I went back to my car when I was there

179
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
for the Sacramento Rainbow Festival.

180
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I thought we tried to take pictures with the shepherd that was in the window at one point.

181
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
They used to have a commander shepherd cut out.

182
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Was that you?

183
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Maybe it was Shane.

184
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
That wasn't me.

185
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It might have been Shane.

186
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Oh, cause I look so much like Shane.

187
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You Mass Effect fanboys are all the same.

188
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Yeah.

189
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Mass Effect.

190
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Anyway.

191
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,680
So the idea is that, and of course with due respect to EA, thank you for Unravel.

192
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,680
We appreciate it.

193
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,680
But we still don't.

194
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,680
Well thank you for being in Sacramento.

195
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,680
Yeah.

196
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,680
Thank you for being in Sacramento.

197
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,000
Even if y'all are bunkered in there and we don't know what y'all are doing.

198
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Yeah.

199
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Yeah.

200
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Seriously.

201
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,320
But either way, you probably have to pay DLC to go in the front door.

202
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,320
So but I digress.

203
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,320
Anyway so.

204
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,320
Don't burn your bridges yet.

205
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,320
Where's the shade sound Rob?

206
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,320
Oh, where's my shade button?

207
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,320
I'm so sorry.

208
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,320
I'm so sorry.

209
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,320
No.

210
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,320
But seriously.

211
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,320
I didn't think I'd need it with Gabe here.

212
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,320
No.

213
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,320
No.

214
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,320
I'm so sorry.

215
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,320
Now I mean all half jokes aside.

216
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:10,840
The idea here is that we're creating, we've created, we're nurturing and strengthening

217
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:17,040
and empowering this community to feel like that their dream can come true.

218
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,440
Their idea can become something more.

219
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,120
And it's gonna get played by your local neighbor.

220
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,320
And then some.

221
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:29,880
And we, you know, again, we're approaching the fourth year of it and it has been incredible.

222
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:36,040
I'm already more nervous than excited about the turnout for this this weekend because

223
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,640
I've already seen numbers and oh my God.

224
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,060
So yeah, it's.

225
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,060
But that's the good.

226
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,060
No, no.

227
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,060
It's great.

228
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,060
How are these people going to fucking fit?

229
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,060
Yeah.

230
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,060
Yeah.

231
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,060
That's yeah.

232
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,060
Yeah.

233
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,060
Pretty.

234
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,060
Yeah.

235
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,060
Pretty much so.

236
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,060
Yeah.

237
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,060
But that but that's what we're here for.

238
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,060
You know.

239
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:57,940
And every time we're going to have the there's going to be a cafe in the venue so you'd be

240
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:58,940
able to buy stuff.

241
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,940
Oh, I just met I just met with the food charge.

242
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:01,940
You get people outside.

243
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:02,940
Oh, that's true.

244
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:06,140
BlizzCon did that a while ago and it was really good for them because it gets people outside

245
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,140
and you know.

246
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,140
Well, that's true.

247
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,140
Yeah, that's true, too.

248
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:12,060
But I remember hoofing it to the subway across the street last year.

249
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,060
Oh, yeah.

250
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,060
You still have those options.

251
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,060
But yeah.

252
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:18,660
So but that's essentially what what second the arcade is all about.

253
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:22,980
And it's been it's defined by our people.

254
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,320
It's not defined by me.

255
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,660
It's not defined by Brianna.

256
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:30,340
It's you know, we we we host, you know, we we come up with with ways to keep improving

257
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:34,100
on how we did the year before and, you know, continuous outreach.

258
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,940
But it is defined by the people that come through.

259
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:40,300
It is absolutely defined by Dark Sakura or we will all face a reign of terror.

260
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,300
That's really what it.

261
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,300
No, I'm kidding.

262
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,300
I'm kidding.

263
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,300
I'm kidding.

264
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,300
All right.

265
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,300
But no.

266
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,820
When you when you say and I want the audience to know this and I realize that our audience

267
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:52,500
is not like we maybe like two percent of our listeners are in Sacramento.

268
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,760
Like if that like most of our listeners, we have listeners in Japan.

269
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,700
We have listeners in Australia with Canada.

270
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,020
So not everybody's going to be able to attend this event.

271
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,020
All that.

272
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,020
Yes.

273
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,020
Of course.

274
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,020
We have listeners in Belgium.

275
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,020
How could I forget the chocolate?

276
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,020
How could I forget?

277
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,020
But anyway.

278
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,620
So, you know, luckily, we'll be able to do the virtual thing and, you know, bring some

279
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:10,620
to you.

280
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,460
So although if you are like anywhere, like you're within 100 miles, Sacramento, you really

281
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:16,340
should be trying to come here in person.

282
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,340
And they are there.

283
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:21,620
We are actually we actually are going to have some out of staters again this time.

284
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:27,580
In fact, we we got hit with some international game developer submissions as well.

285
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:28,580
Yeah.

286
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:31,340
We got was that we're we got hit with some international game developers as well.

287
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,340
Mexico.

288
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,340
No, I mean, like Singapore.

289
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,340
Oh, my God.

290
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:38,340
Singapore, the UAE, Australia, Italy, Italy, Russia.

291
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,340
Yeah.

292
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,340
We got.

293
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,340
Yeah.

294
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,980
So I mean, they actually show up and that's another thing.

295
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:47,020
But the fact that they even heard how they heard about us is beyond me.

296
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,020
But but but somewhere.

297
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,020
Yeah, indeed.

298
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,020
But yeah.

299
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:53,060
You know, we're just spreading out loud like wildfire.

300
00:09:53,060 --> 00:10:00,780
So but now again, you know, I mentioned Breed and, you know, her her two cents in this.

301
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:06,460
So, you know, it's Breed why don't you share your thoughts on on this expand.

302
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,460
Thanks, partner.

303
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,460
Welcome.

304
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:15,240
I'd like to say, you know, with you touching on your international audience, we are proud

305
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:20,260
to say I think we've established that we are California's capital city that has their

306
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:25,000
very first video game event to be proud of because California is the fifth largest economy

307
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
in the world.

308
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,280
Why didn't Sacramento have something like that already established?

309
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:34,600
So thanks to Orange Challenge Radio for helping us grow and setting a precedence here.

310
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:40,280
We are able to say that we've had international game studios submit and then figure out that,

311
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,460
oh, they're in Sacramento.

312
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,960
It's kind of close to San Francisco.

313
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,800
Like, should we come up?

314
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,360
Oh, my God.

315
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,680
Heck, I just it.

316
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,200
It's just a natural fit.

317
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,800
India and India is just a natural fit.

318
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,920
We're so happy to be involved because I think we've been able to really see the growth.

319
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,360
It's kind of like you said, like for a long time, you just kind of thought like, oh, EA

320
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,320
has an office here, even though we're not sure what they do.

321
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,160
But otherwise, like you don't really see a lot of the game development in Sacramento.

322
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,720
But now it's like, you know, especially in large parts of this event, it's like, wow,

323
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,760
you really see the passion that not just this community has, but you know, what's spilling

324
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,080
in from the Bay Area, what's coming up from San Diego and all this, you know, our neighbors

325
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,080
as well.

326
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,240
Sacramento is a very central city.

327
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,720
After all, this city was founded on the railroads, right?

328
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,720
It was a big part of it.

329
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,080
It was a very central kind of thing, but we're not a cow town, we're not a cow town.

330
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,080
And gold.

331
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,080
That's Vacaville.

332
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,080
Literally.

333
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,080
Yes.

334
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:34,680
I have to acknowledge our chat room as well over at live.vognetwork.com.

335
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,680
Hi chat room.

336
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,800
We do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, vognetwork.com.

337
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,440
It's six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

338
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,960
And if you are listening live, head on over to live.vognetwork.com where they're talking

339
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:51,320
about choc, choco tacos and is this something you did?

340
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,920
No, no, no, no.

341
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,840
Well, I just said choco taco, but act-deaf reminded us of Mexico.

342
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,840
Yeah.

343
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,840
Oh yes.

344
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,840
We have a listener in Mexico right now.

345
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,840
And the tacos are better than chocolate.

346
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,840
Yes.

347
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:05,200
And so my response was no, no, choco taco.

348
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:11,000
JD, our pal who lives in the San Francisco area says, I'm looking forward to going to

349
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
IGDA.

350
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Yay.

351
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
It's my first one.

352
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
He's coming.

353
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
He's coming for that.

354
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Yup.

355
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
We welcome you.

356
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Thank you, JD.

357
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Is your last name Phoenix?

358
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I don't think it is.

359
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Oh my God.

360
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I know JD and I don't think it is.

361
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,360
If it is, we, we, you need to be my friend.

362
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,960
So he can be your friend anyway though, right?

363
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,960
I'll be Carmine.

364
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,440
Uh, let's see.

365
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,400
Going to some other comments from our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

366
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:37,280
Raginator says question for Gabe and Brie, which, but this question is from Raginator.

367
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:43,600
So which do you think will happen first Half Life 3 getting released or Loki finishing

368
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,000
a game?

369
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:53,120
Ooh, even I know the answer to that because I was looking forward to kind of busting his

370
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,120
balls.

371
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,120
Yeah.

372
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:00,800
That's kind of why, you know, I mean, I'm like three confirmed folks love you.

373
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,800
Love you.

374
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:07,560
I'm sure we're not going to get through an episode without this, so I'll just keep that

375
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,560
handy.

376
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,560
Yes.

377
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,560
Anyway.

378
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:16,120
Well, wait, hold on, mister.

379
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,120
Where's Crumple?

380
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,120
Um, it's almost done.

381
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,120
Crumple's almost finished.

382
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:23,440
Do we have that almost done back when you were here in February?

383
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,440
Yeah.

384
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,760
And it's almost, it's only one other guy and myself.

385
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,600
It's being polished.

386
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,600
With a lot of flax.

387
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,600
Okay.

388
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,600
I got, I got to give you a little shit.

389
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,600
What's the status of Crumple?

390
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,600
So it'll be wax paper?

391
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,720
Will I, will I get to play Crumple?

392
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:41,040
Um, I cannot confirm or deny that as a matter of fact, we're not even going to go there

393
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,040
just yet.

394
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,040
Jesus Lord.

395
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,280
I can't keep anything a secret.

396
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,280
Well done on that.

397
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,280
Anyway.

398
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,280
So no, no, no.

399
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,720
I'm saying, no, that was great.

400
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,640
That was a wild coincidental guest and we're not going to talk about that idea for episode

401
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,640
three.

402
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,640
Anyway.

403
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,640
You're going to have to sign an NDA first.

404
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,640
No.

405
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,560
That's the show after the show.

406
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,920
So Crumple is almost done.

407
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:06,800
And by almost done, I mean 97% done.

408
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,800
We're fine.

409
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,480
We're fine tuning the ending and then the ending's almost done.

410
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,880
I got to look at it earlier this week.

411
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,480
It is beautiful.

412
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:21,840
In the message that it's, that I was hoping for it to convey and, and I, and I hope, I

413
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:27,560
hope it made, I showed, I showed her, I showed Brianna and she really liked it a lot.

414
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,520
So, but there's more, there's been more since then.

415
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,360
And yeah, so we're, we're almost there.

416
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,360
We're almost there.

417
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:38,800
We're hoping this month will finally be it and, and we're already developing episode

418
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,800
two.

419
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,760
And yeah, so, but you can pre-order now.

420
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,760
You can pre-order right.

421
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,760
You still can pre-order.

422
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,760
Go on my Twitter.

423
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,720
It's on there and on my pin tweet and yeah, it's pre-orders a buck.

424
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,320
When it goes on sale will be two.

425
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,320
Nice.

426
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,920
And nascent games on Twitter, right?

427
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,920
Nascent games.

428
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,920
Yeah.

429
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,920
At nascent games.

430
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,440
You can see gameplay of it right now, just in case, for those who have no idea what we're

431
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,000
even talking about, nascentgames.net.

432
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,120
And you can see gameplay immediately of Crumple.

433
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,320
Wasn't there a demo on itch.io or is that not there anymore?

434
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:11,240
I think the old demo is still on, on, on, on, but it's not, it's an old demo.

435
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,240
Yeah.

436
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,560
The, the, the, the most up to the final demos are on Newgrounds.

437
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,720
You can go, you can play on through your browser on Newgrounds or you can download it on GameJolt.

438
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,720
Okay.

439
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,480
So yeah, we're hoping to get it released on those sites, the full game and as well as

440
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,480
congregate.

441
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,140
Um, and then a couple other spots, so.

442
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,880
Or get your butt to West Sacramento on Saturday.

443
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,880
Yeah.

444
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,880
Come next Saturday.

445
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,880
You can play there.

446
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,880
So play it there.

447
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,880
Absolutely.

448
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,880
Excited for you.

449
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,880
So I had to give you a little bit of crap on that.

450
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,880
Totally.

451
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,880
Okay.

452
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,880
You're not.

453
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,880
All right.

454
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,880
Okay.

455
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,880
Um, okay.

456
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,880
So, so when you talk about this whole like play, learn, inspire, like I know sometimes

457
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:46,160
people come here to promote their stuff with their taglines and a lot of us go, okay, yeah,

458
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,160
sure.

459
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,160
Cheesy.

460
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,080
But you guys like, no, seriously, like, I really think that is a great way to describe

461
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:56,080
the event because I have to admit, even from my perspective, you know, the very first year

462
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,520
we didn't get to do, we, we hadn't met yet.

463
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,960
We were connected the very, very first year, but we got to do this event with you guys

464
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,960
the second year.

465
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,400
And I remember, you know, I was kind of going into it going, okay, well, this is cool.

466
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,880
It's gonna be like a local thing.

467
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,440
And I saw the list of speakers and I was like, okay, well, I don't, I don't really know any

468
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,440
of these people.

469
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,440
They're local.

470
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,620
I'm like, I'm not really gonna expect much, whatever will be interesting.

471
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:19,520
But I was, I was like really blown away by like the quality of speakers that you guys

472
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,360
been drawing to the event.

473
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,760
Not just that year, you guys had a great set of people last year as well, which was even

474
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:29,280
great networking to meet people like Kat and Michelle and some of the people we had last

475
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,280
year.

476
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,280
Absolutely.

477
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:36,040
Um, you know, you, you guys, I think really have brought that inspiration and like thinking

478
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,040
stuff.

479
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,400
And I'm really happy that through VOG, we can kind of bring that to you guys virtually

480
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,400
a little bit.

481
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,520
I know some of you guys have heard it, uh, in chat that, you know, we're listening here

482
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,840
the past couple of years, but, um, maybe I'll pick on Bree a little more here.

483
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:50,160
Um, what, tell us a little bit about the speakers you guys have lined up for this year.

484
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,760
What we're going to hear about this year.

485
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:57,360
So we're really proud of the lineup that, um, Gabe has really, you know, spearheaded

486
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,360
and putting together.

487
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:03,080
We try to be conscious of, you know, making it diverse.

488
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:06,160
Um, obviously we have some ladies who will be attending.

489
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,640
Michelle Hill will be our keynote speaker.

490
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,120
She is originally from Rancho Cordova.

491
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:15,100
She now works at two K games out in the Bay area over the last 12 months.

492
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:20,320
She has come back and poured into our community, mentoring our developers, um, really pouring

493
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,420
her heart into it.

494
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,180
And we appreciate her so much for that.

495
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,180
Yeah.

496
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,180
She's really cool.

497
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,180
I met, I got met her and got to talk with her last year.

498
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,180
She's great.

499
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,180
She's great.

500
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,180
Yes.

501
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,180
And she's grown as well.

502
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:33,900
Um, her first time speaking in public was last year at the 2016 second year arcade.

503
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:37,660
Just a few weeks ago, she spoke at the game developers conference in San Francisco.

504
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,720
That's up on YouTube and in the vault.

505
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,300
If you guys want to check that out, but you gave her her big break.

506
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,460
We gave her her big break.

507
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,500
We did.

508
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:51,040
And how it happened to this day, we laugh about how it even happened to begin with.

509
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:55,600
She just happened to email us through the website on the contact form.

510
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,540
I thought she was fake.

511
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,620
So cause I'm looking her up on LinkedIn.

512
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:04,300
I'm like, you're, you can't, someone, not some, nobody from two K games is seriously

513
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,380
going to know about who we are.

514
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:09,060
I remember telling Brie, like Brie, someone from two K games just messaged us.

515
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,060
She's gotta be a fake.

516
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:12,540
And it turns out, Oh my God, no, she's not.

517
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:18,300
She ends up being a speaker last year, as Brianna said, and, and which is why it's like

518
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:21,040
the amount of support just out of nowhere.

519
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:27,860
She came, she came from the heavens and just help and has just helped us out from just

520
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:30,940
continuing to educate our community.

521
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:31,940
It's been wonderful.

522
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:32,940
Absolutely wonderful.

523
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:36,240
So yeah, hometown girls coming back.

524
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,540
We also have the co-founder of Code for Hood, Alana Jennings.

525
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:46,700
She works with youth that may not have much exposure to STEM programs like game development.

526
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:50,000
She's going to be doing a presentation on what her organization has done.

527
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,060
They also want a big grant from the city of Sacramento to help accelerate their program.

528
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:56,240
So we're really proud to feature her.

529
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,900
We have people from the United States Patent and Trademark Office because this is the one

530
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,460
I'm looking forward to the most.

531
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,460
I am.

532
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,900
No, this is, we don't talk about this crap enough.

533
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,600
I say that lovingly, but you know what I mean?

534
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,060
Like you're right, but, but it becomes like that thing.

535
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,780
Like when you're designing a game and stuff for these issues, these legal issues you get

536
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:14,540
into the, you're probably not even thinking of in the beginning of it.

537
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:16,480
I am really interested in this.

538
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,600
This is a part of like game development that I think we don't ever like think about or

539
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,600
talk about enough.

540
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,600
So.

541
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,600
Right.

542
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,660
And that's one thing Gabe and I try to impress upon our community here is, you know, we want

543
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,420
our developers to be successful.

544
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:33,600
We want to help them grow smart and to build a strong foundation so that they're not a,

545
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,420
you know, fly by night entity, if you will.

546
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:41,280
So that's why we incorporate the business serious side with the United States Patent

547
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,280
and Trademark Office.

548
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,940
But I just, I just have to drop this here because you'll get a kick out of this, Bree.

549
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:50,160
Our pal Bobby Blackwell, who does the show before us here at VOG, he's actually mentioning

550
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,160
in chat.

551
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:54,880
I got to meet Kat, who was one of the speakers last year in Atlanta last year.

552
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,880
And I was like, did you name drop?

553
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,880
He's like, of course I did.

554
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:02,280
She's like, I know OLR, she's recognized, so there, yeah, so there you go through some

555
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,060
of this whole networking thing.

556
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,060
Beautiful.

557
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,060
Creates contacts in other places.

558
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:10,960
We're also going to have now, unfortunately, we don't get to do this part on VOG because

559
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,960
it's music.

560
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:16,240
But if you're going to be there in person, you guys you guys got like, I mean, your musicians

561
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,720
in the past have been great, but you got one that like people are are going to know this

562
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,720
year, right?

563
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,720
Yeah.

564
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,720
Thanks to Rockage on this one.

565
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,080
They you know, we were you know, we were actively looking for somebody and, you know, we try

566
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:32,900
to highlight just one good person, you know, to to, you know, just, you know, be a part

567
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:36,640
of the vibe, enhance, further enhance the vibe, you know, at our event.

568
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:41,280
And yeah, we have we have I didn't even know this either until after way afterwards.

569
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:45,000
Ben Prunty, Prunty, I don't want to say prune like prunty.

570
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,780
But anyway, so Ben Prunty, he is actually the guy that made the music for FTL.

571
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:52,860
So which is insanity.

572
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:53,860
And I freaked out completely.

573
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,720
I was like, oh, my goodness.

574
00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:00,660
And yeah, so it was it was a big deal to have him a part of this of this event this time

575
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,660
around.

576
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,100
And we are eternally grateful for it.

577
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:09,960
And I think this will be his second live show, I think, because this first one was Rockage

578
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,440
just a month and a half about a month and a half ago.

579
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,440
So this will be a second.

580
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,800
But his first time in Sacramento.

581
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,040
So yeah, this will be this is going to be big.

582
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:24,000
And y'all may think you haven't heard of him, but you have because that Humble Freedom Bundle

583
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,200
that just was out not that long ago, FTL was in that, right?

584
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,760
Was the soundtrack in that too?

585
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,760
I remember.

586
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:32,820
I want to say yes, but I might be off somebody in chat.

587
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:37,180
That's that's what the great thing about having a chat room is we get live fact checking because

588
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:44,660
if we screw up, like that's an alternative fact, Rob, that's not at least someone's fact

589
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:45,660
checking.

590
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:46,660
In general.

591
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,660
Take a shot.

592
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,660
All right.

593
00:21:48,660 --> 00:22:00,380
Black Wolf in chat says FTL is usually in bundles.

594
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:04,260
So you most likely have it at some point in the game is, you know, it's a very well known

595
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,260
indie game.

596
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,260
So that's great.

597
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,580
That's gonna be cool that you have that.

598
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:11,440
And hopefully I'll be able to slip him a business card to get him on our show, if not for a

599
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,560
performance to at least talk about the music a little bit.

600
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,560
So I'll be cool.

601
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,560
It's all about networking.

602
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,560
Yes.

603
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:21,880
You know, the Sacramento shows us in the game back game bang.

604
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:28,320
I can't say their name five times fast, those guys, but video game, game, game, game, game,

605
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,320
game, bang.

606
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,320
I can't fucking do it.

607
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,320
VGB.

608
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,320
VGB.

609
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,320
I like that.

610
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:36,440
So us and VGB are going to be circling like cocks.

611
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:40,240
Come on the show, come on the show.

612
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,520
And hey, it's all good.

613
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,580
Those guys are awesome, too.

614
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:45,240
And I'm sure we'll have all the same guests, but we're going to both have fun.

615
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,240
It'll be good.

616
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,920
Excellent.

617
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,920
Excellent.

618
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,920
Um, I'm still looking forward to the event.

619
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:54,600
Um, what, what, um, have you, have you tried to do anything to this for either of you that

620
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,600
want to answer it?

621
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,960
Have you tried to do anything different this year compared to last year or you kind of

622
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:04,520
like after last year show, you're like, okay, this formula, like this worked well, so we're

623
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,040
going to kind of roll with it again.

624
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,040
Like we got it.

625
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,040
We got a template now.

626
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,040
Yeah.

627
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,040
Bree

628
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:15,060
we really want to make it like a Disney freaking experience.

629
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:18,460
It's supposed to be an interactive day, right?

630
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:23,580
And you know, we're, we don't have any sponsors, but I'm working with the resources that I

631
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:28,260
have to make it feel like people are watching, walking into an actual arcade.

632
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:34,020
You're going to have the sounds and the feel and the looks and we just want it all encompassing.

633
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:36,820
Oh, this is why you guys were there setting up the art.

634
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:40,060
Or am I supposed to say that you guys are no, no, you can, no, you totally tweeted it.

635
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:43,180
I can say it's out there.

636
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:47,340
You were setting up the art gallery stuff there, which I don't remember that last year.

637
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,340
That's new.

638
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,340
This is brand new.

639
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,340
Yeah.

640
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,340
Yeah.

641
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:52,340
I like that.

642
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:55,460
So you're taking a Disney approach because one thing that separates Disneyland from like,

643
00:23:55,460 --> 00:24:01,620
I don't know, um, Marine world is that, um, when you go on like Indiana Jones, right,

644
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:06,580
you're even, you're standing in the line and you can like shake the pole and the rope that

645
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,960
the guy will fall from, right?

646
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,040
Like everything around is an experience.

647
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:13,520
Whereas like at Marine world, it's like, okay, you're going to go on the Superman roller

648
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:19,000
coaster and there's literally nothing Superman about it except for the screams of pure terror

649
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,180
that you hear coming from the ride.

650
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,180
That's really it.

651
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:23,840
Um, practically hear that on the drive going there.

652
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:28,020
She's on I 80, you know, no, no disrespect to Marine world, but that's something that

653
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,320
Disney does very well.

654
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,320
Right.

655
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,320
So I like that approach.

656
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:36,960
So you want, you're gonna, you're gonna create that environment more this year.

657
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,960
Definitely very cool.

658
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,960
Very cool.

659
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,960
I'm so excited to be a part of it.

660
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,960
And that's just one aspect.

661
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,960
Yeah.

662
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,960
One.

663
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,960
That's one.

664
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,960
Yeah.

665
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:45,960
So you guys don't just have indie games.

666
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,920
I mean, I don't know how you cram this all in that space, but you do.

667
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,800
You don't just have any games.

668
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:54,920
You're going to have like retrospectives and stuff too.

669
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,920
Huh?

670
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,920
Yes.

671
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:57,920
Pretty much.

672
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,920
Yeah.

673
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,760
We're going to be, I'm going to let Brie laugh that one off, but, um, the, the idea here

674
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:08,180
is, is that, um, yeah, we, one thing we, one thing we, um, the gallery is one thing that

675
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:10,780
we're incorporating for this, for this new event.

676
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:15,460
Um, and we're super, super excited and very grateful to the community center for, you

677
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,020
know, for that addition.

678
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:20,620
Um, and, uh, if you happen to be in West Sac, stop by it.

679
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:23,020
The art's on display all week, so be sure to go by there.

680
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:24,020
Check that out.

681
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:28,080
Um, you know, but we, well, there's a few things we weren't successful with because

682
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,080
of the timing of such.

683
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,820
We're hoping to incorporate that for next year.

684
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:36,940
Um, but yeah, indie developers, both video, VR and board and tabletop.

685
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:41,180
Um, and then, um, we'll, we will also, you know, again, we talked about the speakers

686
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,420
and the panelists as well.

687
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,820
Uh, additional game tournaments.

688
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:46,020
We're going to have a speed runner this time.

689
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:51,300
Um, yeah, he's a pretty significant speed runner and uh, yeah, yeah.

690
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,340
Thanks to console cadence and them for that.

691
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:56,660
So you have console Cade, you have Atari party parties coming back.

692
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,660
Absolutely.

693
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,660
That's, that's an absolute must.

694
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:06,720
So that's a touch part of the vault Dan brings, Dan brings 52 hundreds, by the way, our chatters

695
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,920
running away with this Disney thing, by the way, uh, dungeon buster says walking into

696
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,920
an actual arcade.

697
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,120
I like this approach.

698
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:19,760
Uh, Bobby Black Wolf is asking, can I go ahead and register my fast passes?

699
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,480
Is a season pass to sack in the arcade a thousand dollars?

700
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:26,480
We're going to incorporate that on our Indiegogo campaign for 2018.

701
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,480
Thank you for that suggestion.

702
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,240
Will I have the music playing in line stuck in my head?

703
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:35,680
Will it be a world of laughter and a world of tears?

704
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:39,080
In a world of hope and a world of fear.

705
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,560
This is already a world of pain.

706
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,560
Seriously.

707
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,560
Yes.

708
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,560
Thank you.

709
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,560
Yeah.

710
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,560
JD is following that up.

711
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,800
One thing that separates them is about $50 in admission.

712
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,800
There you go.

713
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,800
That's right.

714
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,200
That's actually very $10.

715
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,200
That's right.

716
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,480
Will there be speakers hidden inside rocks?

717
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,480
We can arrange that.

718
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,480
Don't go looking.

719
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,480
Let's just leave it that way.

720
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,480
Don't go look.

721
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,480
Yeah.

722
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,480
We got a funny fucking bunch.

723
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,480
These people are funny as shit.

724
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,480
Oh, you nerds.

725
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:08,880
We should have a two drink minimum here.

726
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,880
Seriously.

727
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,880
The voice of geeks network.

728
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,880
They come out.

729
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,880
They come out in force.

730
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,160
All them funny geeks all over.

731
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:19,320
It's probably a bad segue then for me to talk about the charitable organizations that'll

732
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,320
be there.

733
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,320
No, let's.

734
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,320
Come on.

735
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,920
It's all about doing some good.

736
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,820
We can laugh and throw shade and stuff as long as we know at the end of the day we're

737
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:27,820
doing good.

738
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:28,820
Yeah, right.

739
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:29,820
We're making a positive impact.

740
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:30,820
Absolutely.

741
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:34,300
The Sacramento Guild for Extra Life is also going to be on site.

742
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:37,740
They're going to be hanging out with our Street Fighter tournament.

743
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:41,780
And we also have a new organization that we're welcoming called the Gamers Gift.

744
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:47,260
And they're based out of UC Davis college students who take VR consoles and video games

745
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:50,900
to senior care facilities and children's hospitals.

746
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:56,600
And they basically try to, you know, help liven up the atmosphere there and bring the

747
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,820
adventure to them.

748
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:00,500
That's like when you used to hear about the Nintendo Wiis.

749
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:04,560
The Wii Sports Bowling were at all the senior care facilities and stuff to get more seniors

750
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,560
into gaming.

751
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:10,900
But I didn't even think of VR as something that could do that.

752
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,460
That's really cool.

753
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:15,860
I see Bobby Blackwell sitting up in his chair out there somewhere.

754
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:19,240
He's our big VR guy on the network.

755
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:22,600
So people will get a chance to meet them and learn more about who they are and how they

756
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,920
can help their local organization too.

757
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,920
That's so cool.

758
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,920
I love that's a great idea.

759
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,180
I love that.

760
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:32,220
So yeah, we are we are not we are not just another convention.

761
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,220
We are.

762
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,220
We're really trying.

763
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,220
No, we are.

764
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,300
There's no trying.

765
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,100
We are.

766
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:44,020
We are standing out with with reference to the amount of folks we were trying to impact

767
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,820
both locally and beyond.

768
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:52,540
And you know, have substance in our event where it's not just a day, it's not just as

769
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:55,060
you mentioned earlier, a day of networking.

770
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:58,280
It's going to be an incredible day of networking.

771
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:03,520
But then from that point, the hope I have for this is that someone's going to walk in

772
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,960
there be a younger old and they're going to play something or they're going to hear they're

773
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:13,160
going to meet someone and they're going to say, I can and they're going to be and then

774
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:16,200
they're going to leave and they're going to find out how they're going to be able to utilize

775
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,280
that because I was that person five and a half years ago.

776
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:25,740
Or if they're Loki, they say, I will someday, eventually when I have time.

777
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:28,500
Push that shade button, sir.

778
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,500
Fantastic.

779
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:35,280
But yes, that's Loki.

780
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,280
We love you.

781
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,280
Damn it.

782
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,280
Get that game done already.

783
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:43,340
Which I would like to stop busting his balls for a second because we will have a game developer

784
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:46,780
panelist gentleman there who develops games with his kids.

785
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:51,640
And props to Loki for doing the family bit and being on the show and holding down the

786
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,640
day job.

787
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,560
But if others can do it, Loki can do it too.

788
00:29:54,560 --> 00:30:00,040
So hopefully he takes notes during that panel.

789
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:03,560
I thought she was going to get sick of that fucking button by the end of the night.

790
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:09,920
I could have sworn she said, you know, let's not bust his balls and then just busted his

791
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,920
balls anyway.

792
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:16,020
That was the shade because I'm not going to do it directly, but I totally just did it.

793
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,040
But indirectly, I'm going to do it anyway.

794
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,040
Ninjas.

795
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,040
No.

796
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,040
We love Loki.

797
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,040
Come on.

798
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:29,680
And that's actually a good mention too because one of the speakers, our dear friend Steve

799
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:33,800
Whitney, he's going to be talking, one of his panels is going to be highlighting just

800
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,800
that.

801
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:41,200
The importance of parents and their children, you know, gaming and game developing together.

802
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,920
We're actually going to have a couple of game studios where it's actually parent and child

803
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:49,580
together and showing off their game.

804
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:56,540
One art piece in a gallery we received this past Friday, the poster is a great 80s style

805
00:30:56,540 --> 00:31:01,300
poster of the game that they're working on, RC battle, RC car battle.

806
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:08,500
And the idea is that there's a kid with an old school retro style motorcycle helmet on

807
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,820
with holding a remote control and it happens to be a son and the game is actually a son's

808
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:12,820
idea.

809
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:13,820
Oh, cool.

810
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:15,240
It's just absolutely incredible.

811
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:19,680
I mean, I was so touched by that.

812
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,920
We actually had the pleasure of meeting them briefly.

813
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,920
It was fantastic.

814
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:30,680
So that's just an example of how we, you know, how in the arcade, SAC and the arcade is going

815
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:37,240
to continue to be different and forge its own path and not copy other paths.

816
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:43,580
We're going to forge our own path into creating something much more significant here.

817
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:48,560
Because as I said earlier in the show, there was no job market for game development period

818
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,560
here.

819
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,560
There just wasn't.

820
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,560
But now we do.

821
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:54,300
Now we have one and it's, and it's just getting better.

822
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:55,980
So well, okay.

823
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:59,040
If y'all are local, I don't know how to sell this shit to you anymore.

824
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,900
Like you aren't already planning on attending.

825
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,980
I really don't know what else I can say at this point.

826
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:06,800
So I hope you all are planning to be here to hang out with Gabe, to hang out with Bree

827
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,620
and us at VOG Network.

828
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:14,860
We will be upstairs in the little black box all day to work with the broadcast of the

829
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:18,860
actual panels so that if you can't be here live, you can at least check out some of the

830
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:19,860
panels.

831
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:23,980
Although I'll warn you, tech shit always happens, so it's not super reliable.

832
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:27,620
But if nothing else, we'll have it all taped and we're planning to rebroadcast it.

833
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:30,820
Hopefully WinOLR would usually be on the next night since we're not going to actually be

834
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:31,820
here the next night.

835
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:35,980
So that'll be an opportunity for folks to check that out if nothing else.

836
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:37,740
So we always have a plan B.

837
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:38,860
Always have a plan B.

838
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:40,860
Awesome.

839
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:41,860
So, yeah.

840
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:46,300
So we'll talk more, of course, about the event and what you guys are up to as we move on

841
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,300
throughout the show tonight.

842
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:50,300
But I do want to make sure we get to some of the other topics going on in gaming world

843
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,300
this week.

844
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:55,500
So let's move on and talk about, we'll get into gaming news in a moment here, but I want

845
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:59,180
to talk quickly about this because Dark Soccer, you weren't here last week because you had

846
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:01,660
the Kidney Stone thing going on.

847
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:05,800
And we got to hear a little bit from you on Skype about this, but I really got the sense

848
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:10,360
you didn't really get to dive into Mass Effect Andromeda until this week.

849
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:14,640
So I want to check in with you a little bit more about how the game is going because I

850
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,560
don't often listen to this show because I live it.

851
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,320
I don't need to listen to it again usually.

852
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:23,000
But I did kind of listen back to last week's show and in listening back, I was kind of

853
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,040
like, God, I might've been like a little harsh on the game because at the end of the day,

854
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:32,000
I'm still a fan of Mass Effect, but, and I know we use this scenario all the time and

855
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:37,880
y'all are sick of hearing this metaphor, but it's that whole Tyra Banks yelling at the

856
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:43,440
model thing because it's the things you care about the most that you're going to blow up

857
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,880
and yell at first.

858
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,880
And so I think kind of some of that was happening last week a little bit with Mass Effect because

859
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:52,000
Dark Soccer, I know you weren't here, but I got into a little bit about the lack of

860
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:57,600
the gay romances that were in it and some of that that was going on and well, because

861
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:02,280
there's only two and there's a trophy for three and you can't actually get the trophy

862
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,280
if you choose to play.

863
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,280
Yeah, you can.

864
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,280
No, you can't.

865
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:09,480
Because there's ladies and there's dudes and you can do lesbian and you can do Dark

866
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,480
Sakura.

867
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,840
You, I don't think, I don't know if you're understanding, but you, I can't just, if I

868
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:18,520
want to play a gay writer, I can't just suddenly say, oh, I'm going to sleep with a woman to

869
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,520
get the trophy.

870
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,520
Well, no, no, no, no.

871
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:25,360
I mean that you could play a female character and get a lesbian romance, but you see, you

872
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,360
see where the issue is, right?

873
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,360
I do.

874
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,520
I don't get that, but I think that there actually are more lesbian options.

875
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:36,080
Well, yes, and that's great for the gay ladies, but it's also kind of like, you know, it kind

876
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:43,580
of also, in my opinion, reinforces a trope that being a lesbian is more acceptable than

877
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:46,520
being gay, which I've had to deal with in my life, right?

878
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:51,060
And you know, anybody that's had to deal with that whole, well, if the two chicks are making

879
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:53,400
out that's hot, you know, that whole, it's that thing.

880
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,400
That's the only thing that bothers me about.

881
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:58,200
But anyway, I promised I wouldn't be negative this week, but just to recap, those are some

882
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,680
of the things we were talking about last week.

883
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,680
And then there was the whole...

884
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,680
Dude, I like Gil though.

885
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:06,080
The trans character was, was like, it was a little rough.

886
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:11,040
I think that they were, I wouldn't expect like a real trans person to use their dead

887
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,040
name.

888
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:16,720
But at the same time, I think it was just to bring out that this character does exist.

889
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:20,920
So maybe it was a poorly designed storytelling.

890
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:24,400
But at least they were trying to say that, yes, in the future, just like the present

891
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,400
trans people exist.

892
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,480
So, you know, that's...

893
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,200
The execution could have been better, but...

894
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,200
It's one of those...

895
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,200
Have you seen that picture?

896
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,200
I was pretty happy to see it.

897
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:35,560
Have you seen that picture on Tumblr of the star where it says, you tried, written in

898
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,560
Comic Sans?

899
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,560
Yeah.

900
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,560
That's kind of how I feel about it.

901
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,560
You tried.

902
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,560
Yeah.

903
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:44,720
So anyway, all that stuff aside, I want to check in a little bit on some of the pauses

904
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:48,560
because I got to say, I've spent a lot more time with the game this week and I, there

905
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:52,400
is a lot that I really, really, really do like about Andromeda.

906
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,800
Just like the story, I think what you really get into it, I think the story is really good.

907
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,480
I convinced a dude in Target to buy it.

908
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,480
Did you?

909
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,480
I pulled a Shane.

910
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,480
Yeah.

911
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,480
His powers were on low.

912
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:08,240
Well, Shane just beat the game today and obviously he won't tell me a lot because of spoilers,

913
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,960
but he said it will absolutely be his game of the year.

914
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,020
He doesn't understand the negativity going on at all.

915
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:17,160
He said some of the most gut wrenching decisions he's ever had to make in a BioWare game were

916
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,160
in this game.

917
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,840
And I've had that same moment.

918
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:24,440
There have definitely been decisions in this game where I'm like, I can't fucking choose.

919
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,440
This is too hard.

920
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,440
I don't know.

921
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,600
I may have looked at a couple of spoilers.

922
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:36,480
And what's tough about Andromeda this time is that, you know, in the Shepard Paragon

923
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,200
Renegade thing, it was a lot of decisions were very black and white.

924
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,700
You could be good guy or you could be bad guy basically.

925
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:48,100
But it was more like it wasn't bad guy so much as like being an asshole to get what

926
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:50,440
you want type of thing.

927
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,520
But in Andromeda, those lines are gone.

928
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:56,860
And so it's not always clear what the good guy option is.

929
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:59,820
And that's what makes the decisions a lot fucking harder.

930
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:03,320
I've been just aiming for whatever answers are professional when dealing with complete

931
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:07,580
strangers and then with dealing with the crew have been a little bit snarky.

932
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:09,620
Have you gone in to read your psychological profile?

933
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:10,620
No, not yet.

934
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:11,620
Oh, yeah.

935
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:12,620
You got to do that.

936
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:15,560
It's like a codex or journal when I don't forget which one it is and you actually select

937
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:21,880
yourself and Lexi actually is filling out as you go along a psychological profile on

938
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:22,880
you.

939
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:23,880
Cool.

940
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,880
And like the decisions you're making.

941
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,880
I adore Lexi.

942
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,880
Yeah.

943
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,340
So what are your what are your thoughts on the game?

944
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:29,340
What are your thoughts on Andromeda?

945
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:33,180
So far, I love Gil and I wish I could date him.

946
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:37,380
He makes me think of Alistair from Dragon Age.

947
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,420
So yeah, that's a that's a good comparison right there.

948
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:46,100
But Vetra is eternal space waifu although I am going for Jahl.

949
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,940
I can't believe Dark Sakura of all people.

950
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:48,940
No, seriously.

951
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:53,420
I saw like a Facebook post or something where she's like Vetra is my waifu forever heart

952
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:55,880
heart heart XOXO starry eyes.

953
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,880
I'm like Desu Desu?

954
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,880
What?

955
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:58,880
It wasn't like that.

956
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:02,020
I did a meme on Lol Effect.

957
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,020
Future space waifu.

958
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,020
I see.

959
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:08,020
Although I am going for Jahl this time around because I don't like the way that my writer

960
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,020
looks.

961
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,740
He gets the less than perfect one and Vetra gets the perfect one.

962
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:12,740
I love Jahl.

963
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:13,740
I love Jahl.

964
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:14,740
I love Jahl.

965
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:15,740
I love Jahl.

966
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:16,740
I love Jahl.

967
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:17,740
I love Jahl.

968
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:18,740
I love Jahl.

969
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:19,740
Oh yeah.

970
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:20,740
His voice purrs.

971
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:21,740
Yeah.

972
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:22,740
I there's like this big movement out there to like make Jahl.

973
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:25,780
Well, I mean, you can't make anyone bisexual, but it is a video game, but let the dudes

974
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:30,060
romance Jahl too, because to be fair, gay dudes have never got to bang an alien.

975
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:33,100
Like that's the one thing that the series has robbed us of is we haven't gotten to bang

976
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,100
an alien yet.

977
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:38,420
Although I don't think Asari count because Asari are technically monogendered.

978
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:39,820
True.

979
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:44,460
But this is also though, this is the first game that you get to bang an alien that's

980
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:49,540
not an Asari for, for a same sex pairing because you get Vetra.

981
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:50,540
Yep.

982
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:53,660
So, and um, one of the Angara as well, right?

983
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:54,660
No.

984
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:55,660
Oh, that's only heterosexual.

985
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:56,660
Yeah.

986
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:59,500
The, um, the Avalla who is the curator of the museum.

987
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,500
Okay.

988
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,500
She's the dude option.

989
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,500
Okay.

990
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,500
Okay.

991
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,500
Anyway though, back to the game itself.

992
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,500
I get motion sick.

993
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:10,660
It actually crashed my old graphics card, like hardcore.

994
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:13,260
I'm laughing because I know the punchline to this.

995
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:15,260
So I bought a new one.

996
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:18,020
More like, more like Dan bought a new one.

997
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:23,140
It's like, okay, I go into the room to go, you know, I fuss about my card, reboot the

998
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:24,140
game.

999
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:25,420
I go into the bedroom to kiss Dan.

1000
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:26,420
Good night.

1001
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:29,020
And then he's like, by the way, your card will be here tomorrow.

1002
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:30,420
What?

1003
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:34,020
So I got, we got a GTX 1060.

1004
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,020
So good card.

1005
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,180
Not the best, but pretty good.

1006
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:38,180
That's really good.

1007
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:39,180
Yeah.

1008
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,180
That's what I have that.

1009
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:41,180
Yeah.

1010
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:42,180
That's good.

1011
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:45,660
And I've been able to bump up all my settings and I actually did pop into wow for a little

1012
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:46,660
bit too.

1013
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:47,660
And it looks really nice.

1014
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:48,660
So.

1015
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:49,660
I have a somewhat similar story.

1016
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:53,580
Just real quick aside is that, um, I actually wrote a tweet earlier this week where I said

1017
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:58,460
something like, uh, I really want to hurry up and beat a mass effect Andromeda on PlayStation

1018
00:39:58,460 --> 00:39:59,460
four.

1019
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:02,300
I kind of want to get it on PC though, so I can play multiplayer with my husband, but

1020
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,660
I don't want to do it until I beat cause cause Alan's on PC.

1021
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,780
I don't want to do it till I beat the PlayStation four version.

1022
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:14,820
The next day you've received a gift on origin from Alan note, troll, lol, lol, lol, lol.

1023
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:18,860
The one thing I'm mad about is cause I ordered it, I ordered mine through Amazon so I could

1024
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:23,340
get the 20% off pre-order and they didn't have the deluxe one on there to pre-order.

1025
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:26,160
So I'm going to have to buy it again when it goes on sale.

1026
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:33,140
So I can get the other outfits and, uh, a pie Jack pet, AKA the monkey, then have all

1027
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,140
the stuff.

1028
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:38,260
So for those keeping track at home, I am now up to two copies of mass effect Andromeda

1029
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:41,260
thanks to husbando.

1030
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:43,140
So and the troll, lol, lol, lol.

1031
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:48,580
So if now I just have to get a copy on Xbox one and I'll complete the trifecta for now.

1032
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:51,940
So just, just for y'all keeping tabs at home, Rob's already up to two copies of mass effect

1033
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:52,940
Andromeda.

1034
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:54,620
Back to the actual review of the game.

1035
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:55,620
Yes.

1036
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:56,620
Okay.

1037
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,580
And this is coming from me with some of my weird depth perception issues.

1038
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:04,860
I do get motion sick on it whenever, um, I accelerate in the nomad, which by the way,

1039
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:07,660
nomad much, much, much, much, much better than the Mako.

1040
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:08,660
Oh yes.

1041
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:10,660
Anything is better than the hammerhead.

1042
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:17,960
Um, actually ATV mode for me is a lot easier than the non ATV mode because it's not moving

1043
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:25,120
as fast, but boosting and jumping and normally jumping with the character too, because it

1044
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:27,220
makes the screen jostle a little bit.

1045
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:28,220
Yeah.

1046
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:29,860
It, it will make me super motion sick.

1047
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:33,360
So if I'm stuck in the nomad for a long time, I'll get motion sick.

1048
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:38,920
So as for the animation issue, I, yeah, I did run into some of the dialogue problems

1049
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:39,920
from the get-go.

1050
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:47,360
Um, there's still a few glitchy things like one time, like it was in the, uh, the, the

1051
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:54,020
cat ship part where you're talking the smuggler thing and the ship is turned upside down and

1052
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:57,380
then it rotates and that made me so sick.

1053
00:41:57,380 --> 00:42:05,280
They got all, uh, mode seven on you from like super Nintendo that whole thing made

1054
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,220
me so sick.

1055
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:11,000
But there was this one thing where you're hearing the people talk on the speaker and

1056
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,520
I swear my writer's head did the fucking owl thing.

1057
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:20,920
She was looking right behind her head and I'm like, girl, so I screenshot that one cause

1058
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,640
that's going to be a meme someday.

1059
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:27,160
Um, but the story has been really good.

1060
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:32,820
It had a kind of a slow buildup once you get into the meat of it, especially when you

1061
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:37,020
deal with the Angara and I, and this is just a little thing for me.

1062
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:40,420
This is actually why I liked fucking avatar of all things.

1063
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:45,220
I like when you were presented with an alien race and they already have an established

1064
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:52,080
culture, not just, Oh, here's this people and they kind of do this thing.

1065
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:59,980
I like that their whole mythology has been built up, that their way of life has been

1066
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:05,580
built up, that they are an established entity by the time you meet them instead of, Oh,

1067
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:06,960
let's just put these people here.

1068
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:07,960
Like in some games.

1069
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:08,960
Yeah.

1070
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,220
And Star Trek was always really good about this too.

1071
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:12,020
Star Trek was always really good about that.

1072
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:16,140
But I mean, that's the thing that really, I think is a mark of a good science fiction

1073
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:18,500
if it's going to have aliens in it.

1074
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:21,340
The aliens have to be established.

1075
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:25,800
I really think that 10 hour preview was the worst thing EA could have done for the game.

1076
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:30,320
I like looking back a little bit, especially about some of the tweets that came out about

1077
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:35,680
it and so forth, because there is a slow buildup, not in the game, but when we say slow buildup,

1078
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:39,920
I know the first thing everybody's going to say is like, well, Final Fantasy 13, it's

1079
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:40,920
different.

1080
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:43,980
When I say a slow buildup, I don't mean a slow buildup in the sense of the gameplay

1081
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:44,980
or anything like that.

1082
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:50,000
It's just the story takes a little bit of time before it really gets going, which if

1083
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:54,280
you're coming off of a game like Mass Effect 3, where the first fucking thing that happens

1084
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:58,640
in Mass Effect 3 is the town that you're in is getting shot the fuck up by Reapers, so

1085
00:43:58,640 --> 00:43:59,640
you hit the ground running.

1086
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:02,820
Did they expect when you're playing 3 that you have already played the other series because

1087
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:04,380
the first Mass Effect?

1088
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:05,380
Right.

1089
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:07,180
It was also a slow build up in a ways.

1090
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:08,180
Yes it was.

1091
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:12,580
It did jump you into the action right away, but you had no fucking clue what was going

1092
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:14,560
on or what you were walking into.

1093
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:19,300
And then you get introduced to the rest of the galaxy, you know, along with everything

1094
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:20,300
else.

1095
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:25,100
And I think that, I honestly think, and this goes back to another video I saw complaining

1096
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:31,940
about how most, you see a lot of movies that are supposed to be like a not sequel, but

1097
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:35,260
a re-imaging, even though they're in the series.

1098
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:39,060
I kind of think that this one's trying to recapture the things that worked from the

1099
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:44,960
first Mass Effect and took the gameplay aspects from the other Mass Effect games that did

1100
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:45,960
work.

1101
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:51,880
And so I think that it was a valiant effort and I truly do believe that it's paid off.

1102
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:56,340
And as far as just visually, you know, now I am playing it as high as I can play it,

1103
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:59,780
it's really, really, really fucking pretty.

1104
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:03,800
It looks great on PC, now that I can say that.

1105
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:07,800
Right now, well actually I left that planet, I went back to Eos.

1106
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:13,780
I was on Havarl, which is one of the Angara planets.

1107
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:18,240
And it's all this wildlife and overgrown.

1108
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:19,240
That planet is gorgeous, yeah.

1109
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:20,240
I've been there too.

1110
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,840
That planet is gorgeous.

1111
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:29,180
And the thing though is that it felt like walking through a heavily wooded area, especially

1112
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:34,180
when you've got bugs that are hiding in the plants and, you know, things that can pop

1113
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:35,180
just out of the trees.

1114
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:43,040
If you've ever been in a dense forest or jungle situation or even in a swamp, which I have,

1115
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:46,180
it's kind of like that though, where someone can just come right out of nowhere.

1116
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:48,440
And so you get a little bit of suspense to it too.

1117
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:49,440
You'll hear the sounds.

1118
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,040
You always get an indicator of where enemies are showing up, but you still get those sounds

1119
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,640
like what's shooting at me, where is it?

1120
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:59,640
You know what else is really gorgeous is those vaults that you go into and especially again,

1121
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:05,040
I don't want to spoiler, but the first escape sequence from a vault, that was a really

1122
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:06,100
impressive sequence.

1123
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:07,100
Oh my goodness.

1124
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:08,100
Yes.

1125
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:12,540
There's you see some of it in a trailer, so it's not really spoilery, but still to actually

1126
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:18,540
play through that, like not only was it graphically, like really the demo, the vault was the demo

1127
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:19,540
that they did before.

1128
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:20,540
Oh yes, it was.

1129
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:21,540
It was.

1130
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:23,180
But did they do the escape sequence part of that?

1131
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:26,340
No, they did the getting into it, but the whole area was the demo.

1132
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:27,340
Yeah.

1133
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:28,340
No, no.

1134
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:30,640
I remember that the vault was that demo they did in the early YouTube, but the escape sequence

1135
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:31,640
was right.

1136
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:35,820
I think that was the moment or what the game really started to kick into.

1137
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:41,060
Which is funny because that's where they cut it off at the end of the day in the time demo.

1138
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:48,860
It's like seriously, so like for real, yeah, so, but yeah, absolute kudos to Mass Effect

1139
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:50,860
Inquisition because that's what it feels like.

1140
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:51,860
Yeah.

1141
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:59,900
Now here's the other thing too is that every day I go and check Nexus mods because you

1142
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:04,200
know it didn't take too long for them to have cracked the stuff for Dragon Age to do

1143
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:05,200
those mods.

1144
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,200
No, they didn't.

1145
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,200
Nope.

1146
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,120
And my biggest complaint is still the character creation.

1147
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:16,860
They could have done exactly what Dragon Age did and have this fully tweakable customizable,

1148
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:21,440
you know, where you pull X axis and Y axis to make things a certain size or to make it

1149
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:26,680
move, but they had all these really terrible presets.

1150
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:29,440
Even the guy presets were pretty terrible.

1151
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:35,260
But they just like were dead set that if you don't play the default, you might be stuck

1152
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:40,400
with a very, very homely looking character.

1153
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:43,640
Can I ask a question about that?

1154
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:48,360
And I want to get both of your opinions on this because there was some feedback based

1155
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:55,500
on that character creation where some, again, this is just, you know, you take the internet

1156
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:56,500
with a grain of salt.

1157
00:47:56,500 --> 00:48:01,360
But, you know, I found this particular argument a very striking argument.

1158
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:08,860
The argument was that the reason for the character creation was so limited, if you will, was,

1159
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:17,140
you know, because they said BioWare did that to prevent any sort of or minimize any sort

1160
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:24,420
of backlash on any character that you can create that's too sexy, too pretty.

1161
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:29,260
And I would love to know, I mean, I laughed when I saw that, but, you know, because, you

1162
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:34,360
know, again, BioWare, you know, has been under this massive spotlight ever since the ending

1163
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:35,360
of 3, as you mentioned earlier.

1164
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:36,360
You get to cop out.

1165
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:37,360
Yeah.

1166
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:38,820
And I'll tell you why.

1167
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:42,100
Because of Dad Writer.

1168
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:52,060
He takes after the traits based on what physical traits, which of the basic presets that you

1169
00:48:52,060 --> 00:49:00,540
choose and modify, his ethnicity and eye color and some of his other physical traits

1170
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:03,220
take directly from the choices that you pick in the character creator.

1171
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:06,180
I think Dad Writer's the reason it's so limited.

1172
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:07,820
That's my theory, too.

1173
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:13,400
However, I think that maybe you should have the option of choosing an ethnicity preset

1174
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:17,740
and then being able, instead of just having just the straight bar across, you can tweak

1175
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:19,220
it in better ways.

1176
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:20,220
And let's be real.

1177
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:23,620
If you want to play writer with the biggest breasts in the galaxy, a modder is going to

1178
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:25,400
bring that to you sooner rather than later.

1179
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:31,300
So of course, if not already, ever was for Mass Effect 3 that made Shepard look a little

1180
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:36,820
Lady Shepard look a little bit more buff because she's a fucking space marine.

1181
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:41,940
Jamie's also one of those people where Lady Shepard is the only Shepard.

1182
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:42,940
She was the first Shepard.

1183
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:43,940
Remember that?

1184
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:45,940
Dem Shep came first.

1185
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:46,940
All right.

1186
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:47,940
Anyway.

1187
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:48,940
Awesome.

1188
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:54,100
Quickly though, Gabe, since you've been playing as well, what are your thoughts on the game?

1189
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:58,220
I agree with reference to the pacing of it.

1190
00:49:58,220 --> 00:50:00,540
And fortunately, I understood.

1191
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:06,860
I came into this with the understanding of they're not going to relate at all to the

1192
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:11,180
previous Mass Effect 3 games, even though they already have in a couple little tiny

1193
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:12,180
ways, which is nice.

1194
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:13,660
I mean, I think it's cool.

1195
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:20,340
I too feel like there was a bit of a slow buildup with it.

1196
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:24,180
But I think in this size of a game, you want to do that.

1197
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:26,860
And I think it was still executed well.

1198
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:29,480
I don't think it was executed perfectly.

1199
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:30,620
Nothing ever necessarily is.

1200
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:35,060
I mean, I think it could have been done a little bit better, but it's definitely not

1201
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:40,900
the worst pacing issues I've ever seen when introducing a new universe.

1202
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:48,780
As you mentioned, with that first vault, you first land on Eos and you start...

1203
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:54,140
I already got that feeling like, oh my goodness, I remember how awesome it felt to explore

1204
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:55,540
the planets.

1205
00:50:55,540 --> 00:51:01,460
And Eos just gave me that feeling, and graphically, even on Xbox One, it's just astounding.

1206
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:04,060
So that's what I play it on.

1207
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:10,340
But yeah, as you explored around and did your thing, very hard to stay focused on the amount

1208
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:13,380
of crap that you have to do.

1209
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:15,500
And that's something that turned me...

1210
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:21,940
I don't want to say it turned me off, but it took me aback a little bit because I love

1211
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:26,180
those games, Dragon Age, Inquisition, my favorite of all the Dragon Age games, all the three

1212
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:30,460
Mass Effect's fantastic, but this new Mass Effect felt overwhelming.

1213
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:33,060
It is what is slowing me down the most.

1214
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:35,620
I shouldn't have that fucking game beat by now.

1215
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:37,500
I feel like I have barely progressed.

1216
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:42,940
And it's because all the worst elements of my gamer ADD kick in when it's like, I got

1217
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:46,820
to go do this quest, but there's a shiny over here, but I got to scan this thing over there,

1218
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:51,220
but there's a vault I got to do and a Sudoku puzzle.

1219
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:52,900
It's totally Sudoku, isn't it?

1220
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:53,900
It's totally Sudoku.

1221
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:58,740
But I'll tell you what though, I have super loved all the distractions because you're

1222
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:01,660
not necessarily timed on events in the game.

1223
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:02,660
Thank goodness.

1224
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:07,180
I didn't finish Eos, but I'm glad that I waited to finish Eos because when I came back, there

1225
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:08,180
was more to do.

1226
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:09,180
Yes.

1227
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:12,900
And there was even, I had left it like a 75% viability.

1228
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:16,900
Now I finished Vold, so I'd never have to fucking go there again.

1229
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:21,900
That world has been- I hate Vold because it's cold.

1230
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:26,380
Angry, angry, angry hoth is what- It's angry hoth.

1231
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:27,380
That's exactly it.

1232
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:35,260
And the mountain, I have driven my nomad over a mountain, over the mountain, that was kind

1233
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:36,900
of fun.

1234
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:39,620
Calamity Jamie makes her own fucking path.

1235
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:40,620
Exactly.

1236
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:44,980
Well, it's not like it wasn't the first Mass Effect where you were literally driving vertically.

1237
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:46,780
Yeah, right.

1238
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:52,260
So one problem is though, is that I have this series of memes on Mass Effecting.

1239
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:54,460
It's called Shepherds Bad Driving.

1240
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:59,260
And I'm starting a new one with- Well, you know, women drivers.

1241
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:00,260
Hey.

1242
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:04,220
She left the door wide fucking open.

1243
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:06,220
Hit the shade button.

1244
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:07,220
So anyway.

1245
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:10,300
The following comments are not necessarily of the internet.

1246
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:14,460
I'm going to be doing a sequel to that called Sarah's Nightmare Driving.

1247
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:21,340
But it's hard to get the nomad in one of those weird positions like you could with the Mako.

1248
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:25,500
So I'm having a really hard time for my blog.

1249
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:29,380
But I did drive it completely over a mountain and that was pretty fun.

1250
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:32,500
But the game- Climb every mountain.

1251
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:35,460
The game overall is absolutely, I think it's an absolutely beautiful game and I'm looking

1252
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:38,560
really forward to what comes next.

1253
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:42,820
And I'm just happy to see some smartassery from the Krogan again.

1254
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:43,820
That's great.

1255
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:44,820
All right.

1256
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:48,460
I got to move on past what Ziba and Chad is calling Orange Lounge Mass Effect Radio.

1257
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:53,900
But hey, look, we've been waiting five years, five long years.

1258
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:54,900
Jack is officially my new grandpa.

1259
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:57,140
So you know, it's going to happen a little bit.

1260
00:53:57,140 --> 00:53:58,140
All right.

1261
00:53:58,140 --> 00:53:59,340
But let's talk about some other games as well.

1262
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:02,020
We need to get into our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we've been playing

1263
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:05,540
this week besides Mass Effect, if there have been any.

1264
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:06,780
Dark Soccer, I'll check in with you first.

1265
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:08,780
How was your gaming week?

1266
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:10,540
Well, Mass Effect.

1267
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:15,020
I also played a little bit of World of Warcraft, basically just long enough to download the

1268
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:18,260
Tomb of Sargeras patch and see what my new card looks like.

1269
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:20,780
It's pretty.

1270
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:25,380
I have been- because I don't even know what it is, but I'm kind of getting back into some

1271
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:28,460
of my cell phone gaming.

1272
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:33,820
So I've been playing Bejeweled Stars, which is kind of stupid, but a fun little challenge.

1273
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:34,820
Lots of Bust-A-Move.

1274
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:39,020
Like I'm on Bust-A-Move marathon mode like you wouldn't believe.

1275
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:42,700
My puzzle bobble, that's it.

1276
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:45,540
And Pokemon Go, a bit here and there.

1277
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:49,340
I evolved a whole bunch of stuff last week that was pretty fun.

1278
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:50,340
Still doing Miitomo.

1279
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:54,820
I don't really consider that a game, but it's kind of like fun dress up.

1280
00:54:54,820 --> 00:55:02,940
They just had these outfits that are all totally Tron-like, and it was pretty awesome.

1281
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:06,660
And I guess really- oh yeah, Dan got Bomberman Zero.

1282
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:07,660
Not Bomberman.

1283
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:08,660
Blaster Master.

1284
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:10,460
I'm sorry to hear it.

1285
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:11,460
Oh, Blaster Master.

1286
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:12,460
Blaster Master?

1287
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:13,460
I said Bomberman.

1288
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:14,460
Blaster Master.

1289
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:15,460
He finished it.

1290
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:16,460
The real ending.

1291
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:17,460
Oh yeah?

1292
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:18,460
He really likes it.

1293
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:19,460
Yeah.

1294
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:21,780
I think it's a- there was a smart time to put something like that out.

1295
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:24,300
It doesn't really get lost in other Switch titles.

1296
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:27,620
The only thing it's really competing against is Zelda, you know?

1297
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:28,620
And Binding of Isaac.

1298
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:29,620
Yeah, you know.

1299
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:32,620
And so I think there's a lot of room for that game to really-

1300
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:33,620
We got this on DS.

1301
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:34,620
3DS.

1302
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:35,620
Oh, okay.

1303
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:36,620
Yeah.

1304
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:37,620
And it was just fine.

1305
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:38,980
He really, really seemed to enjoy it.

1306
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:42,060
And then we did finish Breath of the Wild.

1307
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:47,540
And then, you know, I am disappointed because I would have liked for there to be like kind

1308
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:51,860
of a second quest, except your second quest is to rebuild Hyrule.

1309
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:53,900
But it's still a great game.

1310
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:57,180
The true ending, I admit I got a little sniffly.

1311
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:58,620
It was really great.

1312
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:04,060
And I think for all of us who have for years done the Link Zelda ship, it has finally paid

1313
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:05,060
off.

1314
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:06,940
Okay, spoiler alert.

1315
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:07,940
I didn't say-

1316
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:08,940
I haven't beaten- I haven't beaten yet.

1317
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:09,940
That's all.

1318
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:10,940
There's nothing-

1319
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:11,940
I didn't-

1320
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:12,940
All right, all right.

1321
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:15,220
That didn't spoil anything if you've ever looked at any of the memories.

1322
00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:17,220
Zelda's a princess?

1323
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:18,220
What?

1324
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:19,220
Fair enough.

1325
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:20,220
All right.

1326
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:21,220
Anything else for game week?

1327
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:23,660
Um, no.

1328
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:25,380
Let's check in with our guests.

1329
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:29,020
Bree, I didn't get to hear from you during that whole Mass Effect thing.

1330
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:30,900
I'm assuming you kind of sat that one out.

1331
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:32,580
But what video games have you been just playing?

1332
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:34,460
Oh, I have opinions on Mass Effect.

1333
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:35,460
Do you?

1334
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:36,460
Oh, please.

1335
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:37,460
The chat room's not gonna like it.

1336
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:38,460
Go for it.

1337
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:39,460
Put them on blast.

1338
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:47,240
I have chosen to block any conversation in my timelines regarding Mass Effect Andromeda.

1339
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:51,660
There are certain aspects that this casual gamer does not agree with that are incorporated

1340
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:52,660
in that game.

1341
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:53,660
Ooh, what though?

1342
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:54,980
I want to know.

1343
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:56,860
That's for another show, my friend.

1344
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:58,980
Oh, that's a nasty tease.

1345
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:00,700
That is a nasty, nasty tease.

1346
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:01,700
All right.

1347
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:06,900
The whole sexual relations part is something I do not agree with.

1348
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:07,900
Okay.

1349
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:11,780
But again, if you'd like to have me back when we're not promoting SAC India Arcade, I'd be

1350
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:14,060
happy to discuss that with your people.

1351
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:15,060
We're gonna talk about-

1352
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:17,260
We'll talk about alien banging on another episode.

1353
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:18,260
Yes.

1354
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:21,020
And maybe you can help me understand that.

1355
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:22,860
I'll give you the short version.

1356
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:26,540
It's in movies for a reason.

1357
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:27,540
That's the short version.

1358
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:28,860
We can get into it another time.

1359
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:29,860
Yes.

1360
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:30,860
All right.

1361
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:35,420
So I will say you do have the ability to continue the relationship without the banging for some

1362
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:36,420
of them.

1363
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:41,780
And if you want to be completely non, not do any of it, you don't have to romance anybody.

1364
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:42,780
Exactly.

1365
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:47,860
And so I'll preface my next appearance on your show with when does it become crossing

1366
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:52,740
the line in relationships when you're engaging in that kind of romance or hinting at it with

1367
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:53,740
another player?

1368
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:54,740
Oh, interesting.

1369
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:55,740
All right.

1370
00:57:55,740 --> 00:57:56,740
We'll leave it at that.

1371
00:57:56,740 --> 00:57:57,740
We'll leave it at that for now.

1372
00:57:57,740 --> 00:57:59,380
I think that could be a fascinating topic for-

1373
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:00,780
The chat room's going to go nuts.

1374
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:01,780
But on this topic-

1375
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:05,140
No, they're going to be like, finally, someone's pushing their buttons on Mass Effect.

1376
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:11,620
They're going to be- Bobby's getting out of pinata right now.

1377
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:17,780
Now he's really going to show up expecting his fast pass to the event.

1378
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:21,420
But I was so excited to talk about this topic because I think the last time I was on the

1379
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:27,420
show was like two years ago and I was still very infantile in my game playing world.

1380
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:29,260
But now are you sitting?

1381
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:30,380
Is everybody sitting?

1382
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:33,140
I have completed two games all by myself.

1383
00:58:33,140 --> 00:58:34,140
Good job.

1384
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:36,380
Because I finally made time to do so.

1385
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:38,620
I know this because you've been live streaming some of them too.

1386
00:58:38,620 --> 00:58:39,620
Yes.

1387
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:40,620
And you've been hosting me.

1388
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:41,620
So thank you.

1389
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:42,620
I'm just happy to.

1390
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:43,620
Happy to.

1391
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:45,300
So I'm going to encompass my whole two years.

1392
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:46,980
I finally beat Wolf Among Us.

1393
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:48,700
I started it and played it.

1394
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:49,700
I loved it.

1395
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:51,300
I played Life is Strange.

1396
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:54,540
I started Unravel.

1397
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:58,540
And I started- I feel so childish on this.

1398
00:58:58,540 --> 00:58:59,540
Why?

1399
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:02,300
Do you know how much good stuff I've heard about Life is Strange?

1400
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:05,260
And I actually watched like, I don't remember what was going on.

1401
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:10,740
I was up at like 2am on a Friday night a few weeks ago and like, I just was like, well,

1402
00:59:10,740 --> 00:59:11,740
what's going on on Twitch?

1403
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:15,380
Like, I feel like I should have been high or something, but I don't do that.

1404
00:59:15,380 --> 00:59:16,460
I don't do any of that stuff.

1405
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:18,900
But like, I felt like still it was like one of those nights.

1406
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:23,220
And so at 2am on a Friday, I'm there on Twitch and like Bree's streaming Life is Strange.

1407
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:24,940
She's got Insomnia going on too.

1408
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:26,580
So I was actually watching for like a good hour.

1409
00:59:26,580 --> 00:59:27,580
Oh, that was you.

1410
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:28,580
That was me.

1411
00:59:28,580 --> 00:59:31,420
How come you didn't say hi?

1412
00:59:31,420 --> 00:59:32,420
Usually I'm watching on PlayStation.

1413
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:33,420
I don't have a keyboard.

1414
00:59:33,420 --> 00:59:35,580
I can, I can kind of do it.

1415
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:36,580
That's fine.

1416
00:59:36,580 --> 00:59:39,940
But yeah, I grew so attached to those characters and I was going through some stuff at the

1417
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:41,780
time I was playing that game.

1418
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:46,180
And now that it's over, I finally understand why people played that game multiple times

1419
00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:48,860
because there's so many different ways you could go about it.

1420
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:52,380
So I made some new friends when I was streaming online with that.

1421
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:55,100
And that was cool because there were some parts where I got stuck.

1422
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:59,060
But when I first started that game in the fall, I know everybody, please don't give

1423
00:59:59,060 --> 01:00:00,860
me grief in the chat room.

1424
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:03,220
It took me like nine months to finish that game.

1425
01:00:03,220 --> 01:00:04,380
They can fight me.

1426
01:00:04,380 --> 01:00:07,100
Do you know how long it takes me to finish any game?

1427
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:12,100
But there was some heavy shit in that game that my heart just was not ready to address

1428
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:13,100
at that point.

1429
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:17,620
Yeah, I've heard, I've heard Life is Strange is, is really resonates with people.

1430
01:00:17,620 --> 01:00:18,620
Yeah.

1431
01:00:18,620 --> 01:00:21,060
So, but I loved it and I'm trying to keep it light.

1432
01:00:21,060 --> 01:00:25,060
I downloaded Dear Esther on my Xbox.

1433
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:27,180
Why are indie titles so serious?

1434
01:00:27,180 --> 01:00:28,180
Some of them.

1435
01:00:28,180 --> 01:00:29,180
I just picked that up for Mac.

1436
01:00:29,180 --> 01:00:30,180
Yeah.

1437
01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:33,100
Dear Esther is really, cause they just did the remaster just came out.

1438
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:35,820
If you do enjoy Dear Esther, you must play.

1439
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:36,820
Everybody's gone to the rapture.

1440
01:00:36,820 --> 01:00:37,820
Oh, okay.

1441
01:00:37,820 --> 01:00:42,940
You, oh, I, that game like still resonates with me to this day and it doesn't, it doesn't

1442
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:46,420
affect everybody the same way, but there's something about that game that is just so

1443
01:00:46,420 --> 01:00:48,300
fucking beautiful.

1444
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:49,580
Like I can't, like I can't handle it.

1445
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:53,880
Like, and even playing Dear Esther, I was like, this isn't rapture.

1446
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:57,020
This isn't like, it's good, but it's not rapture.

1447
01:00:57,020 --> 01:00:59,620
So it's, it's almost like they're going to get crushed by their own success.

1448
01:00:59,620 --> 01:01:02,580
But that, that you, you definitely need to try.

1449
01:01:02,580 --> 01:01:04,420
Everybody's gone to the rapture is so good.

1450
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:05,420
I will look into that.

1451
01:01:05,420 --> 01:01:06,420
Thank you.

1452
01:01:06,420 --> 01:01:07,420
You're welcome.

1453
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:08,420
Give me another two years.

1454
01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:09,420
You got it.

1455
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:10,420
Take your time.

1456
01:01:10,420 --> 01:01:11,420
Take your time.

1457
01:01:11,420 --> 01:01:12,420
Don't let anybody rush you.

1458
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:16,700
The dog network.com free kill zero says, Oh, I finished unravel myself last week.

1459
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:18,820
That game had some major feels.

1460
01:01:18,820 --> 01:01:23,780
So just warning unravel may not be the emotional break you were hoping for.

1461
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:25,060
It's the controls.

1462
01:01:25,060 --> 01:01:29,260
I take too much time away from that game that by the time I get back to it, I forget how

1463
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:32,340
to swing and throw the rope and do that whole bit, but it's beautiful.

1464
01:01:32,340 --> 01:01:33,340
I love it.

1465
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:34,340
Damn that music though.

1466
01:01:34,340 --> 01:01:37,200
Cause some of the pieces like that's what keeps drawing me back.

1467
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:41,100
It's difficult for me, but that music, the music and rapture is what will do it.

1468
01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:42,780
Oh my God.

1469
01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:43,780
Oh my God.

1470
01:01:43,780 --> 01:01:44,780
I'm like it.

1471
01:01:44,780 --> 01:01:45,780
I'm getting chills.

1472
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:46,780
Just thinking about it.

1473
01:01:46,780 --> 01:01:47,780
Um, ice, ice, pee, ICP.

1474
01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:52,980
I don't know if, I don't know if it's ICP or ice pee in the chat room with the ICP clearly

1475
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:54,180
a reference to the insane clown.

1476
01:01:54,180 --> 01:01:55,180
Of course.

1477
01:01:55,180 --> 01:01:56,180
Just kidding.

1478
01:01:56,180 --> 01:02:02,500
But anyway, ICP and chat says, if you like walking simulators, uh, I would suggest firewatch

1479
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:03,660
love that.

1480
01:02:03,660 --> 01:02:05,300
I really enjoyed firewatch as well.

1481
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:06,300
Beat that game in one night.

1482
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:07,300
It went on sale.

1483
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:08,560
Beat that game in one night.

1484
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:09,560
That's another one I'd recommend.

1485
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:11,880
That should only take you a few hours to get through.

1486
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:17,800
Even, even if you look behind every nook and cranny, it's like maybe five hours tops tops.

1487
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:20,400
So that was really good too.

1488
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:24,320
Um, uh, I don't, I don't like the brand walking simulators.

1489
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:26,320
I'm just, that's not, no, no shade.

1490
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:28,580
I'm not going to bring out the shade button for the chatter because I realized that's

1491
01:02:28,580 --> 01:02:31,320
kind of like what the internet has adopted as kind of the term.

1492
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:34,520
I'm not a fan of that term because I feel like that term is used sometimes to belittle

1493
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:38,640
those types of games because I just consider them more.

1494
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:41,980
They are very heavily narrative based games.

1495
01:02:41,980 --> 01:02:45,920
They're very heavily on the story as opposed to the action.

1496
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:49,880
I feel, I feel it's a, it's a true definition of visual narrative.

1497
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:53,300
It's what, it's an interactive, it's an interactive visual narrative.

1498
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:54,300
It's what it is.

1499
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:59,760
You are, you are in the story and you are, you are following the story that, that, that

1500
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:04,920
the book, if you will, has presented instead of you finding out when you turn the page,

1501
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:07,080
you're going to find out when you turn the corner.

1502
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:10,240
And it's going to, and it, you know, and it's going to reveal all these little things.

1503
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:15,720
But yeah, I, I, I, as an indie developer, you know, like if we're, if we're going to,

1504
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:19,720
you know, if we're going to trounce made up genres and stuff like that, Metroidvania needs

1505
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:21,680
to stop, but I won't even go there.

1506
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:25,440
But like, you know, but yeah, the walking simulator thing, it, it shouldn't, it shouldn't

1507
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:28,800
demeanor or, you know, devalue, you know.

1508
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:29,800
Yeah.

1509
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:31,600
I'm not saying it to like shake my finger.

1510
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:32,600
Don't do that.

1511
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:38,280
I'm just saying, I'm like, I just, I feel like those games deserve a label that, you

1512
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:43,080
know, cause, cause honestly it's quickly becoming one of my favorite genre of games and, you

1513
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:44,080
know, okay.

1514
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:46,640
Is it because I'm old and I can't do action as much anymore?

1515
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:52,360
I don't know, but I just like, I get more out of those types of games.

1516
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:55,800
Like I, especially for somebody with my, my short attention span type of thing.

1517
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:58,860
And obviously Brie is a victim of this too, cause she's, she mentioned this too, it takes

1518
01:03:58,860 --> 01:04:00,400
her a while to get through a game.

1519
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:05,520
Like these like four hour interactive adventures are perfect.

1520
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:06,520
You know what I mean?

1521
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:07,520
Like they're just like perfect stories.

1522
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:08,520
I don't know for me.

1523
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:10,000
That's how I feel anyway.

1524
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:15,120
I blame it on sack indie arcade for right now, but we'll sit in front of the TV.

1525
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:19,520
You clearly have every right to blame event planning for why you don't play video games.

1526
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:22,980
Can I, I'm sorry, Brie, you were going to say, I want to piggyback off of Jamie though.

1527
01:04:22,980 --> 01:04:27,560
I have started Pokemon go again because it's beautiful outside and I need to get my butt

1528
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:28,560
walking.

1529
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:31,400
I haven't gone to any gyms or battles yet.

1530
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:32,840
I don't know how to do that.

1531
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:34,280
So I haven't done any either.

1532
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:36,040
Can we do it together?

1533
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:40,980
You don't, you don't, you also don't have like, I think part of the beauty of that game,

1534
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:42,700
although that game has its flaws for sure.

1535
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:45,600
But part of the beauty of that game is that you don't have to do that at all.

1536
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:49,400
If you don't want, like there's tons of rewards to get from the game without ever touching

1537
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:52,720
that stuff, but you can, you can do it if you want.

1538
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:55,280
And it's, you do get other rewards for doing it.

1539
01:04:55,280 --> 01:05:00,740
You do get the premium in game currency a little bit, you get that from doing the gyms,

1540
01:05:00,740 --> 01:05:02,720
but I kind of think you can get a rich experience without it.

1541
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:06,440
Well, that's good to know that because here I am trying to like build up my Pokemon for

1542
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:08,060
something, but it's all for me.

1543
01:05:08,060 --> 01:05:12,800
For me playing games with people is always more fun in real life, not necessarily online.

1544
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:13,800
Absolutely.

1545
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:14,800
Absolutely.

1546
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:17,800
Uh, JD wanted to back up a minute here and chat over at live.vognetwork.com saying I

1547
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:20,800
don't actually know what a walking simulator is.

1548
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:24,880
No, that's a fair question because it's kind of a newer genre of game.

1549
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:29,120
I would say the first big one, well, Dear Esther was probably actually the first big

1550
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:35,600
one, but Gone Home was probably the first really successful mainstream big one.

1551
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:40,120
And you may remember with Gone Home, Gone Home got shit from a lot of people because

1552
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:43,600
a lot of people were like, where's the game though?

1553
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:47,480
Like you're walking through this scary house and you think you, you think at some point

1554
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:50,080
like a ghost is going to jump out and chop off your head.

1555
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:56,240
And spoiler alert, that never happens because the game is actually not scare about scary

1556
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:57,240
things at all.

1557
01:05:57,240 --> 01:05:58,240
Right?

1558
01:05:58,240 --> 01:05:59,240
Absolutely.

1559
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:01,920
That game is, is really a masterpiece in a different way of like throwing like this curve

1560
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:05,340
ball at you that you think it's going to be this, this scary game.

1561
01:06:05,340 --> 01:06:10,560
And then you find out it's actually like a different type of tragedy that's going on.

1562
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:13,560
That's very, in some ways it's kind of relatable.

1563
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:18,020
I mean, you know, I realized it's not an experience everybody's gone through, but I think that

1564
01:06:18,020 --> 01:06:19,180
whole like teenage angst.

1565
01:06:19,180 --> 01:06:21,700
I think everybody's felt teenage angst at some point.

1566
01:06:21,700 --> 01:06:24,360
And there's a lot of that that you explore through the eyes of the character's sister

1567
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:25,360
in Gone Home.

1568
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:29,860
So anyway, I'm digressing a little bit, but my point is, is that they are more the games

1569
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:37,580
that are driven by the story and you are just this participant watching, not necessarily

1570
01:06:37,580 --> 01:06:41,360
participating as if it were an action game or something.

1571
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:43,020
You're more of an observer.

1572
01:06:43,020 --> 01:06:44,720
That's especially the case in Rapture.

1573
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:47,560
You are definitely an observer in that game.

1574
01:06:48,540 --> 01:06:52,860
Even games with simple puzzle elements like Firewatch and things, you're still like just

1575
01:06:52,860 --> 01:06:56,900
an observer who has to do things to see the whole picture.

1576
01:06:56,900 --> 01:06:57,900
So I don't know.

1577
01:06:57,900 --> 01:06:58,900
Absolutely.

1578
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:05,000
I think another game that got that, you know, that caught some heat, even though I think

1579
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:09,420
the good obviously overpowered the bad was Journey, even though, you know, Journey, there

1580
01:07:09,420 --> 01:07:15,500
are certain elements of Journey, you know, where it feels action-y, you don't necessarily

1581
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:19,840
do anything, but Journey caught a lot of heat for the same thing.

1582
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:23,480
I just paid $20 for a two hour game.

1583
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:24,480
Why?

1584
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:26,900
That's because it's the best damn two hours of your life.

1585
01:07:26,900 --> 01:07:27,900
Damn straight.

1586
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:28,900
Damn straight.

1587
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:32,520
But that, Journey is an interesting example of something that kind of, because obviously

1588
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:34,080
genres blend.

1589
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:39,720
So Journey is kind of a blend of that narrative mixed with a Mario 64 type of game.

1590
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:40,720
Yeah, it is.

1591
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:41,720
It absolutely is.

1592
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:47,340
And, you know, with a lot more limitations, you know, all you have is limited jumps and

1593
01:07:47,340 --> 01:07:48,340
not much else.

1594
01:07:48,340 --> 01:07:50,860
Limited jumps and floats, so.

1595
01:07:50,860 --> 01:07:54,980
Free Kill Zero says, I haven't played Gone Home, but isn't that Dragon Cancer in a similar

1596
01:07:54,980 --> 01:07:55,980
vein?

1597
01:07:55,980 --> 01:07:56,980
Oh.

1598
01:07:56,980 --> 01:07:57,980
Yeah.

1599
01:07:57,980 --> 01:08:02,060
I have not played that one start to finish yet because I keep waiting for that day where,

1600
01:08:02,060 --> 01:08:07,540
like, do I have a 24 hour period where I can cry nonstop and not leave the house?

1601
01:08:07,540 --> 01:08:08,540
No, I'm serious.

1602
01:08:08,540 --> 01:08:09,540
I don't even know.

1603
01:08:09,540 --> 01:08:15,520
Just everything I know about preparing me for this game is that, like, just, it's like

1604
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:20,880
that, I don't know for you guys, but for me, it's like, if Rob breaks out the Tori Amos

1605
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:25,680
CDs, like, it's a day, you know?

1606
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:28,680
That says a lot about how the day is going to go.

1607
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:30,240
Can I ask a question about that?

1608
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:31,240
Sure.

1609
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:32,240
I would love your thought.

1610
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:35,140
Even your, I don't know how familiar you are with that Dragon Cancer game.

1611
01:08:35,140 --> 01:08:39,240
The creator of the game, for those who may not know what that game is about, essentially

1612
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:45,120
the developer created this game surrounding his son, and, you know, the son had passed

1613
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:50,160
and so on and so forth, and this game was a very striking game, and when the developer

1614
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:55,200
got awarded at the game awards, whatever it was called, I can't remember the name of it.

1615
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:58,560
Is that the big hub-a-loo that Jeff Keighley does?

1616
01:08:58,560 --> 01:08:59,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1617
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:00,560
The game awards.

1618
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:01,560
Yeah, the game awards or whatever.

1619
01:09:01,980 --> 01:09:06,420
So, the developer caught a lot of heat because, you know, obviously the controversy was, you're

1620
01:09:06,420 --> 01:09:14,900
making money off the illness and death of your son, so, you know, so I, yeah, you know,

1621
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:15,900
so...

1622
01:09:15,900 --> 01:09:18,420
Rob is currently looking at his brain.

1623
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:27,980
So, yeah, you know, I mean, I know for me, there are games for me that I know I want

1624
01:09:27,980 --> 01:09:33,140
to make to talk about my experiences with my family, because, you know, eventually they're

1625
01:09:33,140 --> 01:09:37,040
going to go, they're going to go, and there's going to be things that I want to remember

1626
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:41,040
them by, you know, in different ways, but what are your thoughts, you know, what are

1627
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:42,040
your thoughts on that?

1628
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:43,040
This is a great question.

1629
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:45,920
I'm going to put it as simply as I can.

1630
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:52,120
If you go into any museum and see paintings of the Civil War or paintings of, you know,

1631
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:57,920
tragedies that have happened in culture, are those people profiting off of human tragedies?

1632
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:05,820
No, because art is a spontaneous expression of culture, and that is what that dragon cancer

1633
01:10:05,820 --> 01:10:06,820
is.

1634
01:10:06,820 --> 01:10:11,220
It is an expression of what this person was going through, but guess what?

1635
01:10:11,220 --> 01:10:17,460
Expressions don't pay the fucking rent, so, yes, the guy gets to sell this because other

1636
01:10:17,460 --> 01:10:26,260
people, you know, you get to, other people get to have this experience that many people

1637
01:10:26,260 --> 01:10:31,800
are not going to, fortunately, I suppose, get to experience, you know what I mean by

1638
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:32,800
that?

1639
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:33,800
Absolutely.

1640
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:36,800
So, yes, it's fine for him to charge money for it.

1641
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:39,000
If you don't like it, don't fucking pay it.

1642
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:44,200
Go on to the next, download the next CD on your list or whatever you're going to steal

1643
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:48,840
for free, and then, you know, well, that's what it is, right?

1644
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:53,500
I don't fucking pay for art and the hippies, all those Burning Man hippies, I don't pay

1645
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:54,500
for art.

1646
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:56,320
Come on.

1647
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:57,320
I hear that.

1648
01:10:57,320 --> 01:10:58,320
I hear that.

1649
01:10:58,320 --> 01:10:59,320
Okay.

1650
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:00,320
Art, don't pay the rent.

1651
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:01,320
Mm-hmm.

1652
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:02,320
That's my thought.

1653
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:03,320
Fascinating.

1654
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:04,320
Okay.

1655
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:05,320
All right.

1656
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:09,720
Let's see, going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Bobby Blackwell reminded me Journey played

1657
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:10,880
live is awesome.

1658
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:15,200
He's not talking about the band, but at MAGFest, I mean, that journey is cool too, but back

1659
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:16,200
to the game.

1660
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:19,400
MAGFest, they did the Austin Wintory conducting live.

1661
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:23,920
That was my first MAGFest, and I swear to God, that's what made a fan, a MAGFest fan

1662
01:11:23,940 --> 01:11:25,460
out of me, was going to that.

1663
01:11:25,460 --> 01:11:26,460
It was a lot of fun.

1664
01:11:26,460 --> 01:11:27,460
Yeah.

1665
01:11:27,460 --> 01:11:28,460
Yeah.

1666
01:11:28,460 --> 01:11:29,460
Yeah.

1667
01:11:29,460 --> 01:11:33,960
That was, I saw bits and pieces of that, and it nearly brought me to tears, just because,

1668
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:37,720
you know, like, just the impact that that game itself has had on me, and just to hear,

1669
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:39,580
just to see that had happened.

1670
01:11:39,580 --> 01:11:46,240
There is something about a crowd of 4,000 people or however many people were there when,

1671
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:52,320
to everyone's surprise, another player showed up in Journey, and everybody assumed that

1672
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:56,100
because this was, like, it was going to be a controlled environment, and that they were

1673
01:11:56,100 --> 01:12:01,240
just going to be running through the game, and, okay, if you haven't experienced Journey

1674
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:03,680
by now, I guess I can tell you the big twist.

1675
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:07,340
In my opinion, this was a twist, and this was always better if you didn't know about

1676
01:12:07,340 --> 01:12:10,820
this going into the game, but the reality is, it's been years, I need to get this off

1677
01:12:10,820 --> 01:12:11,820
my chest now.

1678
01:12:11,820 --> 01:12:16,460
The big twist in the game is that it's secretly a multiplayer game, is that you don't, you

1679
01:12:16,460 --> 01:12:20,020
may be going through this experience, and all of a sudden, somebody who looks like you,

1680
01:12:20,020 --> 01:12:23,800
and everything just like you shows up, and at first you're like, is this an NPC?

1681
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:27,960
But you don't really know, because you can't talk to them, you're not connected on voice

1682
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:28,960
chat or anything like that.

1683
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:33,040
All you can do is you can hit your button to go, and, like, make these little musical

1684
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:35,040
tones and, like, chirp at them, right?

1685
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:41,480
So, and then that's how you, and that's the magic of the game, is those, how you experience

1686
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:46,920
your journey with another person, or did you just run on ahead and leave that guy in the

1687
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:49,840
dust, literally, or what, it's how you choose to do that.

1688
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:56,920
So anyway, my point is, there was something really magical about reliving that in a crowd

1689
01:12:56,920 --> 01:13:00,580
of 4,000 people, when you're going through this, and all of a sudden, another person

1690
01:13:00,580 --> 01:13:01,580
showed up.

1691
01:13:01,580 --> 01:13:07,380
And everybody was like, oh, shit, like, they're online, and there's another person here.

1692
01:13:07,380 --> 01:13:10,060
And like, I remember even when they beat the game, and it showed the name of it, because

1693
01:13:10,060 --> 01:13:11,380
it shows these people that you went on a game with.

1694
01:13:11,380 --> 01:13:13,380
Oh, I lost my mind when I saw it.

1695
01:13:13,380 --> 01:13:18,180
The whole audience started cheering, people were going on Twitter, who is this person?

1696
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:20,680
Do you know that you just played in front of MAGFest?

1697
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:22,680
I don't think they ever found who it was.

1698
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:23,680
Yeah.

1699
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:27,160
And that was, yeah, oh, God.

1700
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:31,320
I know, it was, like, I can't explain it.

1701
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:37,160
I can't put words on a moment like that, like, as just a gaming fan, like, that moment when

1702
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:39,160
it's like, I'm not alone.

1703
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:40,160
Right.

1704
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:42,160
Oh, Barf, just thinking about it, it's so powerful.

1705
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:44,160
I know, yeah, no, seriously, I'm getting.

1706
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:45,160
Yeah.

1707
01:13:46,140 --> 01:13:49,140
I actually streamed, I recently streamed that game for their five-year anniversary.

1708
01:13:49,140 --> 01:13:53,500
They had a five-year anniversary earlier in March, and I totally streamed it on Twitch

1709
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:58,140
that day to celebrate that five-year, and it still brought me to tears at the end.

1710
01:13:58,140 --> 01:14:04,140
I had to, like, mute my mic, because I was like, so, yeah, I was done.

1711
01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:09,480
But let me, now, back to those Twitter egg icons, or excuse me, what are the icons now?

1712
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:10,480
The oval people?

1713
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:12,660
Or whatever the fuck they are on Twitter now?

1714
01:14:12,660 --> 01:14:13,660
Like, okay.

1715
01:14:13,660 --> 01:14:14,660
Creepy things?

1716
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:20,240
People now that are tweeting that that dragon cancer guy shouldn't be making any money or

1717
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:21,240
whatever.

1718
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:23,240
Did you pay money for Journey?

1719
01:14:23,240 --> 01:14:24,240
Yeah.

1720
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:27,240
Art, don't pay the fucking rent.

1721
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:29,240
Expressions, don't pay the rent.

1722
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:31,240
Money pays the rent.

1723
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:32,240
Yep.

1724
01:14:32,240 --> 01:14:36,240
And that's the level of ignorance we as developers have to deal with when we make anything, you

1725
01:14:36,240 --> 01:14:44,240
know, it's like, I could have played a game like this for free, it had so much more.

1726
01:14:44,820 --> 01:14:50,360
I mean, and we talked about this on previous shows, it's like, what justifies the price

1727
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:51,900
of an indie game?

1728
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:58,620
What makes it quality over just, you know, a waste of steam credits or whatever the hell?

1729
01:14:58,620 --> 01:15:04,540
And yeah, I mean, it's unfortunate, but you're absolutely right, you know, art doesn't.

1730
01:15:04,540 --> 01:15:05,540
It doesn't.

1731
01:15:05,540 --> 01:15:09,880
It gives us an opportunity to share who we are, but we still got to keep the roof over

1732
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:10,880
our heads.

1733
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:11,880
Yeah.

1734
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:12,880
Yeah.

1735
01:15:13,020 --> 01:15:15,960
Sometimes it's just, everybody's going to be a fan of something and everything's going

1736
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:17,260
to have its haters.

1737
01:15:17,260 --> 01:15:24,080
You know, somewhere out there, there is somebody who loves Bomberman Zero Mission on Xbox 360.

1738
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:25,480
It's got its fan club.

1739
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:27,580
It's small.

1740
01:15:27,580 --> 01:15:32,900
It may not even be in this country, who knows, but it's got its fans somewhere and more power

1741
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:33,900
to them.

1742
01:15:33,900 --> 01:15:37,200
Probably the same people who still play Phantasy Star Online on the 360.

1743
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:38,200
Excuse you.

1744
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:40,200
You better watch where you're fucking going.

1745
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:41,200
Phantasy Star Online is great.

1746
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:42,200
Watch.

1747
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:46,280
You better stay in your fucking lane.

1748
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:49,400
That's why I started kind of turning left as I said that, because I already knew what

1749
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:50,400
was about to happen.

1750
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:51,400
That was fun.

1751
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:52,400
Thank you.

1752
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:55,440
So I don't mind coming back on the show next year to promote indie arcade.

1753
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:56,440
Without me?

1754
01:15:56,440 --> 01:15:57,440
By yourself?

1755
01:15:57,440 --> 01:15:58,440
Yeah.

1756
01:15:58,440 --> 01:15:59,440
That'd be fantastic.

1757
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:00,440
Thank you.

1758
01:16:00,440 --> 01:16:01,440
But you'll replace him in no time.

1759
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:02,440
I'm just kidding.

1760
01:16:02,440 --> 01:16:03,440
I'm kidding.

1761
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:04,440
I'm kidding.

1762
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:05,440
I'm kidding.

1763
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:06,440
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1764
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:07,440
What?

1765
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:08,440
There we go.

1766
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:09,440
There we go.

1767
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:10,440
All right.

1768
01:16:10,680 --> 01:16:11,680
So this is from your gaming week, Bree.

1769
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:14,680
Thank you for sharing.

1770
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:19,000
We spent 30 minutes with our analysis of walking simulators and all that.

1771
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,560
No, but it's great.

1772
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:22,360
Gabe, quickly, your gaming week.

1773
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:23,360
Of course.

1774
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:24,360
What would you play?

1775
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:32,520
Between Mass Effect Andromeda, Fallout Shelter on Xbox One, super addictive free game.

1776
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:33,520
I spent a couple.

1777
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:38,480
I decided to actually spend a couple dollars on that game because fantastic, fantastic

1778
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:41,280
free app game, I should say.

1779
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:47,840
Although it's not the most user friendly experience, but it's still a really, really good game.

1780
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:52,160
So between that and what else was I messing with?

1781
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:56,320
I kind of started dabbling again in Resident Evil 7.

1782
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:57,760
I haven't beat that game yet.

1783
01:16:57,760 --> 01:16:58,760
I've just been.

1784
01:16:58,760 --> 01:16:59,760
It's just one of those.

1785
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:01,320
I can only play that game in short spurts.

1786
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:05,840
But there was one other game that I've been messing with.

1787
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:11,720
I've been replaying Rayman Origins as well since it became Xbox One compatible.

1788
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:13,960
I never completed Origins.

1789
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:16,560
I beat Legends, but I never completed Origins.

1790
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:19,000
So I'm trying to finally beat that game.

1791
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,200
So I'm close to it now.

1792
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:27,320
I also dabbled in Halo Wars 2 a little bit, but yeah, Halo Wars 2 came out at the wrong

1793
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:31,920
time because Andromeda came out and I messed around with Breath of the Wild a little bit

1794
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:33,480
on the Wii U.

1795
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:34,480
Gorgeous game.

1796
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:37,880
I don't care too much about the frame rate thing, but again, that's just one of those

1797
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:44,640
games where I can only play one huge exploration type game at a time and Andromeda was going

1798
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:45,640
to be it for me.

1799
01:17:45,640 --> 01:17:46,640
So, yeah.

1800
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:50,760
So that's what I've been playing and the next EDF game is coming out later this year.

1801
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:52,240
So yeah.

1802
01:17:52,240 --> 01:17:55,720
So you and Loki can bro out over that.

1803
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:58,120
I don't get into those games the same way you guys do.

1804
01:17:58,120 --> 01:17:59,480
No, that's okay.

1805
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:00,480
That's all right.

1806
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:04,960
I'm happy that you never played it.

1807
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:08,800
Maybe somebody in the chat room will relate or even Brie, because I've complained about

1808
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:13,920
it to her, the soldier will now be able to run because they finally added a run button

1809
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:19,040
for the soldier instead of me rolling, rolling constantly to speed forward.

1810
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:20,040
You know, yeah.

1811
01:18:20,040 --> 01:18:24,320
So now they were genius enough to add a friggin' run button.

1812
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:29,440
It's like, okay, I get the wing diver can fly, but still make the dude run.

1813
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:30,440
Anyway.

1814
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:31,440
So I'm happy about that stuff.

1815
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:32,440
That's what I've been dabbling with.

1816
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:33,440
Quality of life.

1817
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:34,440
Things are huge.

1818
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:35,440
Yeah.

1819
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:36,440
Cool.

1820
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:37,440
Yeah.

1821
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:38,440
All right.

1822
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:39,440
My gaming week.

1823
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:40,720
So I've been obviously playing a lot of Mass Effect Andromeda.

1824
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:43,640
That's still been kind of continuing to dominate my week still.

1825
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:49,760
I am enjoying it probably even more so now than a week ago.

1826
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:53,760
Been trying to, it's hard to juggle multiplayer and single player.

1827
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:57,360
That's my biggest downfall right now is that multiplayer is still really fun for me.

1828
01:18:57,360 --> 01:18:58,640
I'm glad we got to do that stream.

1829
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:01,240
We did a live stream after the show last week where I played some multiplayer.

1830
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:03,200
Sadly, the matchmaking was busted.

1831
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:06,960
So it was like, let's see how long a dungeon Buster was a good sport and he played with

1832
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:10,520
me and it was just the two of us and we, we were able to survive a couple of waves on

1833
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:14,280
our own, but you really need four people because it's balanced for people.

1834
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:18,460
But when I do get the matches of four people, a multiplayer is a lot of fun and Lord knows

1835
01:19:18,460 --> 01:19:21,440
I spent a ton of time in multiplayer, Mass Effect three.

1836
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:24,800
That's the reason why I bought the game so many times.

1837
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:28,200
So yeah, well now that I'm on PC, I can play.

1838
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:30,000
I got to, I got to confess about that actually.

1839
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:36,080
The Mass Effect three multiplayer, I'll probably, I'll probably get some good laughs at my cost

1840
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:43,960
for this, but for the longest time, up until my friend back home in Jersey, Tino, he tells

1841
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:49,720
me, I thought Mass Effect the multiplayer part was competitive for the longest time.

1842
01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:51,280
I, I, well that's the thing.

1843
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:56,760
It took me, it took me two years after the game came out for him and I to have a talk

1844
01:19:56,760 --> 01:19:57,760
about it.

1845
01:19:57,800 --> 01:19:59,560
And he's like, Oh, well you got to get into the multiplayer thing.

1846
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:02,000
And I'm like, yeah, but I'm not a competitive person.

1847
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,000
I do co-op.

1848
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:07,280
And then he, there was this dead silence and he's, he's typing all these dots on the screen

1849
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:09,680
and I'm like, Oh my God, what did I just say?

1850
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:11,080
And then he just railed me.

1851
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:13,320
He's like, Gabriel, the whole thing is co-op.

1852
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:15,160
I'm like, what are you talking about?

1853
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:16,900
He's like, you only play the computer.

1854
01:20:16,900 --> 01:20:22,240
And I'm telling you that night I hopped right on that and I felt like such a, I felt like

1855
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:23,240
such a dumb ass.

1856
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:25,840
I was like, Oh my God, I could have been playing this forever.

1857
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:26,840
Yes.

1858
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:33,480
It blows my mind how much multiplayer and mass effect is ignored when it's such a, a

1859
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:37,300
like positive trait that the game has going for it.

1860
01:20:37,300 --> 01:20:42,680
The fact that it exists in conjunction with the single player campaign, like it really

1861
01:20:42,680 --> 01:20:44,560
blows my mind how much multiplayer gets ignored.

1862
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:47,880
I even went on Twitch the other night because I'm like, Oh, I want to see, no, I think it

1863
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:49,400
was after I was done streaming.

1864
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:52,460
I was like, I want to see who else streams multiplayer and what they do.

1865
01:20:52,460 --> 01:20:56,160
And there was probably like maybe 15, 20 different channels streaming mass effect Andromeda.

1866
01:20:56,160 --> 01:20:59,720
None of them doing multiplayer, none of them.

1867
01:20:59,720 --> 01:21:03,060
And in a lot of the reviews of the game, multiplayer rarely got touched on.

1868
01:21:03,060 --> 01:21:07,980
Now I understand the embargo I think was up like a day after the online servers went live.

1869
01:21:07,980 --> 01:21:11,760
So people probably didn't have the chance to really test it, but, and I get it.

1870
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:15,600
Like some people don't want to touch multiplayer at all because some people are like, Ooh,

1871
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:16,600
the competitive stuff.

1872
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:18,720
It's like, kind of like what you were saying, like the competitive stuff, but, and people

1873
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:23,520
don't even know, like, no, it's, it's all co-op and it actually creates a much better

1874
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:25,920
environment than most multiplayer things.

1875
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:30,300
And that's what pleased me with it, Mass Effect 3, and eventually I'll play Andromeda for

1876
01:21:30,300 --> 01:21:34,060
the co-op, but yeah, I want to go through the story first.

1877
01:21:34,060 --> 01:21:35,700
It's probably, it's not a bad thing to do.

1878
01:21:35,700 --> 01:21:38,540
I just enjoyed it in, in three so much I had to.

1879
01:21:38,540 --> 01:21:39,540
So, okay.

1880
01:21:39,540 --> 01:21:41,720
I've been playing Mass Effect Andromeda, but I've been playing some other games too.

1881
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:47,440
I've been playing Clicker Heroes because I hate my life and I just, it's so addicting

1882
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:48,440
you guys.

1883
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:49,440
It's so addicting.

1884
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:54,000
And I have to get more trophies on PlayStation 4, those fucking trophies.

1885
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,000
But then, okay.

1886
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:59,700
We haven't talked a lot about April Fool's jokes tonight, but I got to say Sega fucking

1887
01:21:59,700 --> 01:22:03,400
won because they put out on Steam 8-bit Bayonetta.

1888
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:04,400
Yes!

1889
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:05,400
I saw that!

1890
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:06,400
Oh my goodness.

1891
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:07,400
Okay.

1892
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:10,400
It's, it's like temper your expectations.

1893
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:11,920
It's not like a full on platform or anything.

1894
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:12,920
It's a silly thing.

1895
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:14,400
Like it could have been a mobile game, people.

1896
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:18,020
Like literally all it is, like you have two buttons, like jump and shoot.

1897
01:22:18,020 --> 01:22:20,580
And so it's like, you can just stay in one place and shoot the things or you can jump

1898
01:22:20,580 --> 01:22:21,760
and hit the other thing.

1899
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:22,760
It's silly.

1900
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:29,760
The fact that it exists is great because that means Sega's still thinking about Bayonetta

1901
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:33,920
and they put it on PC on Steam.

1902
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:38,120
Could this be a sign that they might be doing Bayo or Bayo 2 on Steam at some point?

1903
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:40,200
I, Oh God, I hope so.

1904
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:46,360
Now the question of course is Bayo 2 was heavily, you know, heavily partnered by Nintendo.

1905
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:49,780
So where, you know, where it was only, you know, exclusive only with Nintendo.

1906
01:22:49,780 --> 01:22:54,180
So how that, we'll see how that plays out, but you know, yeah.

1907
01:22:54,180 --> 01:22:58,380
Well, I imagine that agreement's gotta be up at some point, but seriously, between all

1908
01:22:58,380 --> 01:23:05,620
the Mario Kart 8 and Splatoon sequel and, and rumors of, of a Smash Brothers and all

1909
01:23:05,620 --> 01:23:09,740
this stuff, like if any Wii U game deserves a second fucking chance, it's Bayo 2.

1910
01:23:09,740 --> 01:23:10,740
Oh, no kidding.

1911
01:23:10,740 --> 01:23:12,220
Like put it on the Switch.

1912
01:23:12,220 --> 01:23:13,220
Put it on the Switch.

1913
01:23:13,220 --> 01:23:14,220
Bayo 2 was...

1914
01:23:14,220 --> 01:23:16,300
Hashtag put it on the Switch.

1915
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:17,300
Get switched.

1916
01:23:17,300 --> 01:23:18,700
Hashtag get switched.

1917
01:23:18,700 --> 01:23:21,700
So yeah, Bayonetta 2.

1918
01:23:21,700 --> 01:23:22,700
Absolutely astounding game.

1919
01:23:22,700 --> 01:23:23,700
Absolutely.

1920
01:23:23,700 --> 01:23:29,300
I loved part one, but my God, part two just went in a direction I, I didn't think could

1921
01:23:29,300 --> 01:23:30,300
be topped with part one.

1922
01:23:30,300 --> 01:23:33,140
It's seriously like the best game that the least number of people have played.

1923
01:23:33,140 --> 01:23:34,140
Probably.

1924
01:23:34,140 --> 01:23:35,140
Yeah, absolutely.

1925
01:23:35,140 --> 01:23:36,140
No, it's, it's so sad.

1926
01:23:36,140 --> 01:23:37,140
You're right.

1927
01:23:37,140 --> 01:23:38,140
You're right.

1928
01:23:38,140 --> 01:23:41,660
And here I thought that, um, uh, Sinbad got it.

1929
01:23:41,660 --> 01:23:42,660
Okay.

1930
01:23:42,660 --> 01:23:44,580
Sinbad did do really good on April Fool's day.

1931
01:23:44,580 --> 01:23:46,100
The Shazam thing was pretty funny.

1932
01:23:46,620 --> 01:23:52,220
You know, talk about just, just make a, make a lemonade, lemonade out of lemons, right?

1933
01:23:52,220 --> 01:23:57,100
Or in, in, in his case, Sinbad's case, how to make some fucking money off of it.

1934
01:23:57,100 --> 01:24:00,460
Do you realize, do you realize he just turned a joke into money?

1935
01:24:00,460 --> 01:24:02,380
He turned the internet urban legit.

1936
01:24:02,380 --> 01:24:03,860
He made money off of it.

1937
01:24:03,860 --> 01:24:08,540
What can be more American than that?

1938
01:24:08,540 --> 01:24:12,340
But somebody's going to yell at the guy who made that dragon cancer.

1939
01:24:12,340 --> 01:24:17,060
Meanwhile, Sinbad's making April Fool's jokes with ads on it and yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1940
01:24:17,060 --> 01:24:21,060
And they made it, but yeah, massive hypocrisy, but that's why we love this.

1941
01:24:21,060 --> 01:24:22,060
Shut up internet.

1942
01:24:22,060 --> 01:24:23,060
All right.

1943
01:24:23,060 --> 01:24:26,460
You don't, you're drunk, log off.

1944
01:24:26,460 --> 01:24:29,140
Drunk on power.

1945
01:24:29,140 --> 01:24:32,420
And then I wanted to, I need to give this game a shout out too, because this is a, actually

1946
01:24:32,420 --> 01:24:35,620
we're going to have these guys on the show in a couple of weeks, an indie developer.

1947
01:24:35,620 --> 01:24:39,660
So get this, uh, Captain Matt from Starboard Power Coupling apparently has, he's one of

1948
01:24:39,660 --> 01:24:43,580
those like small world thing, apparently has some friends who are indie developers

1949
01:24:43,580 --> 01:24:49,220
and their game Lil' Tanks is hitting Steam on Tuesday.

1950
01:24:49,220 --> 01:24:53,740
One of them's here in Sacramento and of course I told, I said, so it's probably a little

1951
01:24:53,740 --> 01:24:56,700
late to submit, but do you know about this indie arcade event?

1952
01:24:56,700 --> 01:24:59,500
You know, so I don't know if they're coming or what have you, but yeah.

1953
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:01,420
So another game, Lil' Tanks.

1954
01:25:01,420 --> 01:25:05,740
So that game actually goes on sale Tuesday, but they were good enough to let me have a

1955
01:25:05,740 --> 01:25:06,740
little peek at it early.

1956
01:25:06,740 --> 01:25:10,220
So I was playing that over the weekend and it's kind of like a, it definitely feels like

1957
01:25:10,220 --> 01:25:15,300
something that's probably inspired by bullet hell games, but because it's tanks, it runs

1958
01:25:15,300 --> 01:25:16,900
sideways.

1959
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:22,220
So it kind of gets, you know how like a lot of like Japanese shooty games are very narrow

1960
01:25:22,220 --> 01:25:24,540
because that's how the arcade cabinets were.

1961
01:25:24,540 --> 01:25:27,140
This one kind of flips it on the side cause it's tanks.

1962
01:25:27,140 --> 01:25:28,740
So it's, it's, it's different.

1963
01:25:28,740 --> 01:25:32,940
It's very indie, you know, but it's, I, the soundtracks really good too.

1964
01:25:32,940 --> 01:25:36,260
They're going to be here on Easter in two weeks when we're back with Orange Hospital.

1965
01:25:36,260 --> 01:25:37,700
They're going to be here on the show.

1966
01:25:37,700 --> 01:25:40,140
So yeah, those are the next guests we have up.

1967
01:25:40,140 --> 01:25:41,140
So check that out.

1968
01:25:41,140 --> 01:25:47,140
I am already thinking about Heavy Weapon on Xbox 360, Xbox Live Arcade.

1969
01:25:47,140 --> 01:25:48,980
Yes, I'll have to bring that up.

1970
01:25:48,980 --> 01:25:50,660
How influenced were you by Heavy Weapon?

1971
01:25:50,660 --> 01:25:51,660
Yes, Heavy Weapon.

1972
01:25:51,660 --> 01:25:52,660
Definitely, definitely.

1973
01:25:52,660 --> 01:25:53,660
I'm getting some Heavy Weapon vibes.

1974
01:25:53,660 --> 01:25:54,660
Shout out to PopCap.

1975
01:25:54,660 --> 01:25:57,140
That was a great, great, great frigging game.

1976
01:25:57,140 --> 01:25:59,180
So anyway, yeah, that's awesome.

1977
01:25:59,180 --> 01:26:00,180
So check that out.

1978
01:26:00,180 --> 01:26:02,260
That hits Steam on Tuesday, Lil' Tanks.

1979
01:26:02,260 --> 01:26:03,940
It was a Kickstarter success too.

1980
01:26:03,940 --> 01:26:04,940
They had to fund on Kickstarter.

1981
01:26:04,940 --> 01:26:05,940
Nice.

1982
01:26:06,620 --> 01:26:07,620
So good for them.

1983
01:26:07,620 --> 01:26:10,620
So, uh, we'll, we'll ask them more questions in a couple of weeks, but I want to make sure

1984
01:26:10,620 --> 01:26:14,780
they got a shout out because unfortunately with us not having a show next week, I couldn't

1985
01:26:14,780 --> 01:26:16,680
get them here the week their game was out.

1986
01:26:16,680 --> 01:26:19,620
So I want to make sure they got a shout out now.

1987
01:26:19,620 --> 01:26:20,620
So we're all good.

1988
01:26:20,620 --> 01:26:21,620
So check that out.

1989
01:26:21,620 --> 01:26:22,620
Well, that's good.

1990
01:26:22,620 --> 01:26:24,180
You could boost week two sales for an indie developer.

1991
01:26:24,180 --> 01:26:25,180
That's true.

1992
01:26:25,180 --> 01:26:26,180
That's true.

1993
01:26:26,180 --> 01:26:27,180
That's true.

1994
01:26:27,180 --> 01:26:29,140
You know, when so many games are kind of like, if you don't make it your first week, you

1995
01:26:29,140 --> 01:26:30,220
know, see you later.

1996
01:26:30,220 --> 01:26:31,700
Uh, I think that's good.

1997
01:26:31,700 --> 01:26:34,700
That's good to have the lasting presence, two and three and so forth.

1998
01:26:34,700 --> 01:26:35,700
Very, very true.

1999
01:26:36,460 --> 01:26:37,460
All right.

2000
01:26:37,460 --> 01:26:39,540
Anyhow, uh, I think that's going to do it for gaming weeks.

2001
01:26:39,540 --> 01:26:41,340
Let's just do some quick housekeeping again.

2002
01:26:41,340 --> 01:26:48,100
There will be no show live here next Sunday because we will be live on Saturday from 10

2003
01:26:48,100 --> 01:26:56,220
AM to 4 PM for us, uh, will be live, uh, on the network provided there are no tech issues.

2004
01:26:56,220 --> 01:26:57,220
There's always that disclaimer.

2005
01:26:57,220 --> 01:27:00,920
There could always be a tech fuck up, uh, in which case we will record and bring to

2006
01:27:00,920 --> 01:27:03,520
you an OLR's place, uh, the next night.

2007
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:08,680
But we will not be here because we will be busy with the event and actually, um, also

2008
01:27:08,680 --> 01:27:12,960
just selfishly dark soccer and I have a long time friend who's going to be here from Japan

2009
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:14,440
who happens to be here that Sunday.

2010
01:27:14,440 --> 01:27:18,300
So it's like, it's like one of those things like, okay guys, we're going to, since we're

2011
01:27:18,300 --> 01:27:20,600
putting in the hours the day before, we're gonna take the night off to go be with our

2012
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:21,600
friends.

2013
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:22,600
F is for friendship.

2014
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:23,600
Exactly.

2015
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:24,600
Exactly.

2016
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:25,600
Dijour means friendship.

2017
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:29,400
And honestly, how long has it been since she's been in the U S like a year, at least, at

2018
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:30,400
least.

2019
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:31,400
Yeah.

2020
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:32,400
So this will be really, really nice.

2021
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:37,480
Oh, from there, my favorite, my favorite flavor right now.

2022
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:38,480
Oh, that's awesome.

2023
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:39,480
Fantastic.

2024
01:27:39,480 --> 01:27:42,160
So, uh, but we will be back on, yes, Easter Sunday.

2025
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:45,600
So if WrestleMania can't stop us, you know, Easter ain't going to stop us.

2026
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:50,480
So mine remains to be seen because it's the sisters.

2027
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:52,560
I'm like, we're going to be missing the Jewish person on Easter.

2028
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:53,560
Really?

2029
01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:54,560
It's Passover.

2030
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:55,560
All right.

2031
01:27:55,560 --> 01:27:56,560
Fair enough.

2032
01:27:56,560 --> 01:27:57,560
Fair enough.

2033
01:27:57,560 --> 01:27:58,560
Fair enough.

2034
01:27:59,160 --> 01:28:03,720
I will be hosting a Seder on Wednesday if you want to come eat horseradish and matzah

2035
01:28:03,720 --> 01:28:04,720
with us.

2036
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:07,600
Matzah's, matzah's, it's an acquired taste, but yeah.

2037
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:08,600
All right.

2038
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:15,520
Matzah is, to quote a friend of mine, it's like Jewish ex lax.

2039
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:16,520
It's very binding.

2040
01:28:16,520 --> 01:28:17,520
Wow.

2041
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:18,520
All right.

2042
01:28:18,520 --> 01:28:19,520
Anyhow.

2043
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:21,400
Uh, so she's not wrong.

2044
01:28:21,400 --> 01:28:22,400
So fine.

2045
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:23,400
So fine.

2046
01:28:23,400 --> 01:28:24,400
I get totally not wrong.

2047
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:27,640
I swear to God, this happened to me for a month last year where I had flip flop posts

2048
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:28,640
for the whole month.

2049
01:28:28,640 --> 01:28:29,640
It was like one week.

2050
01:28:29,640 --> 01:28:30,640
Loki was here and Jamie wasn't.

2051
01:28:30,640 --> 01:28:32,080
Then Jamie was here and Loki wasn't.

2052
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:33,860
So we're going to, we're going to do this again this month.

2053
01:28:33,860 --> 01:28:35,240
So check that out.

2054
01:28:35,240 --> 01:28:36,880
Uh, we'll be back on April 16th.

2055
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:40,460
I can also tell you now, I know this is a ways out, but I just want to make sure y'all

2056
01:28:40,460 --> 01:28:41,460
can plan.

2057
01:28:41,460 --> 01:28:42,460
It's also right before my birthday.

2058
01:28:42,460 --> 01:28:43,460
It is.

2059
01:28:43,460 --> 01:28:44,460
It is.

2060
01:28:44,460 --> 01:28:45,460
You're going to miss your, you're going to miss your birthday show.

2061
01:28:45,460 --> 01:28:46,460
That's fine.

2062
01:28:46,460 --> 01:28:47,460
I'll do it the week after.

2063
01:28:47,460 --> 01:28:50,080
Let's quickly talk about OLR's birthday show.

2064
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:56,560
So OLR's 15th birthday show is going to be June 18th.

2065
01:28:56,600 --> 01:28:58,960
Quinceañera!

2066
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:00,520
Here's the thing with the Quinceañera.

2067
01:29:00,520 --> 01:29:01,640
That's two months out.

2068
01:29:01,640 --> 01:29:04,160
We don't have time to get a ballroom or any of that shit.

2069
01:29:04,160 --> 01:29:05,160
So my thought is...

2070
01:29:05,160 --> 01:29:06,580
Can I just wear a pretty dress?

2071
01:29:06,580 --> 01:29:09,020
Let's him, yes, you can wear a pretty dress.

2072
01:29:09,020 --> 01:29:13,240
Let's invite some of our friends to the studio to just have a nice 15th episode.

2073
01:29:13,240 --> 01:29:14,240
Invite some of our friends.

2074
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:18,080
We'll see if maybe the game bang guys want to come back or I can sing some Spanish music.

2075
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:19,080
Yeah, you can.

2076
01:29:19,080 --> 01:29:24,720
We'll get some folks here in studio and then maybe for episode 700, maybe our friends that

2077
01:29:24,920 --> 01:29:28,160
have done event planning in the past will give me a list of contacts.

2078
01:29:28,160 --> 01:29:33,360
And for episode 700, we can maybe look at, like, or something maybe would be willing

2079
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:36,160
to host episode 700 and we could do an event like that.

2080
01:29:36,160 --> 01:29:40,160
I had to mouse something to the co-hosts because I don't want to put it on air, but...

2081
01:29:40,160 --> 01:29:41,160
Secrets!

2082
01:29:41,160 --> 01:29:42,160
Yes.

2083
01:29:42,160 --> 01:29:43,160
So that way we have enough time to plan.

2084
01:29:43,160 --> 01:29:48,720
Keep in mind in Alabama, I had no idea what that was called, that it was a thing.

2085
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:52,260
I had never heard of that until I moved to California.

2086
01:29:52,260 --> 01:30:00,460
So I totally want to get everything done and wear a floofy 80s style dress.

2087
01:30:00,460 --> 01:30:01,460
Go ahead.

2088
01:30:01,460 --> 01:30:02,460
Do you want to do full drag for the quinceañera?

2089
01:30:02,460 --> 01:30:03,460
Go for it.

2090
01:30:03,460 --> 01:30:05,760
Well, I already do that.

2091
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:06,760
Give us your best Valentina.

2092
01:30:06,760 --> 01:30:08,700
It's just reenacting Breakfast Club, apparently.

2093
01:30:08,700 --> 01:30:14,700
But no, I will not ask if anyone wants to see my cuckoo.

2094
01:30:14,700 --> 01:30:17,380
Episode 700 should be in about four months.

2095
01:30:17,380 --> 01:30:18,380
I'm...

2096
01:30:18,380 --> 01:30:20,460
God, I just, I hope it's not the same weekend as Dragon Con.

2097
01:30:20,460 --> 01:30:21,460
I don't think it would be.

2098
01:30:21,460 --> 01:30:24,820
It would be probably right around right after, right around mid-September, I think is when

2099
01:30:24,820 --> 01:30:25,980
that would fall.

2100
01:30:25,980 --> 01:30:27,580
Off the plot it out on a list somewhere.

2101
01:30:27,580 --> 01:30:28,580
So all right.

2102
01:30:28,580 --> 01:30:30,300
Well, Bree, you're dying to say something over there.

2103
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:33,180
Well, four months is plenty of time to plan a proper party.

2104
01:30:33,180 --> 01:30:34,180
Yeah.

2105
01:30:34,180 --> 01:30:35,240
So I think, I think that's okay.

2106
01:30:35,240 --> 01:30:37,340
So Gabe and Bree are doing the we're going to talk thing.

2107
01:30:37,340 --> 01:30:39,620
So get ready, y'all.

2108
01:30:39,620 --> 01:30:44,620
Episode 700, we're going to bring to you everything we promised for the quinceañera in proper

2109
01:30:44,620 --> 01:30:46,700
OLR tardy fashion.

2110
01:30:46,700 --> 01:30:53,580
So and since JD said OMG Valentina, I want that wig.

2111
01:30:53,580 --> 01:30:54,580
All right.

2112
01:30:54,580 --> 01:30:55,580
Look, red wig.

2113
01:30:55,580 --> 01:30:57,220
I got another podcast to talk about all that.

2114
01:30:57,220 --> 01:30:58,220
All right.

2115
01:30:58,220 --> 01:30:59,220
You never had me on.

2116
01:30:59,220 --> 01:31:00,220
Oh, man.

2117
01:31:00,220 --> 01:31:01,220
We had enough.

2118
01:31:01,220 --> 01:31:04,020
We have a spot available this last week to the spikes in Japan.

2119
01:31:04,020 --> 01:31:05,020
Oh, well.

2120
01:31:05,020 --> 01:31:06,020
Anyway.

2121
01:31:06,020 --> 01:31:07,020
We got to move.

2122
01:31:07,020 --> 01:31:08,020
We got to move on.

2123
01:31:08,020 --> 01:31:09,940
We got to get into some gaming news and what's going on.

2124
01:31:09,940 --> 01:31:12,940
Oh, no, I didn't say the whole thing with the quinceañera.

2125
01:31:12,940 --> 01:31:19,740
So the actual 15th birthday will be June 18th because we're giving ourselves the best

2126
01:31:19,740 --> 01:31:22,140
birthday present ever.

2127
01:31:22,140 --> 01:31:23,920
Taking a week off on June 25th.

2128
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:26,260
So we will not be here like June 25th.

2129
01:31:26,260 --> 01:31:27,260
Awesome.

2130
01:31:27,260 --> 01:31:28,580
Just just booked it today.

2131
01:31:28,580 --> 01:31:30,460
Hubby and I are going to finally take our proper honeymoon.

2132
01:31:30,460 --> 01:31:31,460
We're going to go to Chicago.

2133
01:31:31,460 --> 01:31:32,460
We have.

2134
01:31:32,460 --> 01:31:33,460
Oh, I saw the tweet.

2135
01:31:33,460 --> 01:31:34,460
Congrats.

2136
01:31:34,460 --> 01:31:35,460
Congrats, man.

2137
01:31:35,460 --> 01:31:36,820
We have some friends that live out in Chicago.

2138
01:31:36,820 --> 01:31:39,580
And for a couple of years now, they've been saying you got to come to Pride out in Chicago.

2139
01:31:39,580 --> 01:31:40,580
It's a lot of fun.

2140
01:31:40,580 --> 01:31:41,580
Come to Pride.

2141
01:31:41,860 --> 01:31:44,540
Also, you guys may remember the show is right around my birthday.

2142
01:31:44,540 --> 01:31:46,920
So it's kind of one of those like everything lines up just right.

2143
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:47,920
So we're going to.

2144
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:48,920
I'm.

2145
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:49,920
That's wonderful.

2146
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:50,920
You guys deserve that.

2147
01:31:50,920 --> 01:31:51,920
That's awesome.

2148
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:52,920
Fucking gay as hell.

2149
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:53,920
That's what.

2150
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:55,380
No show is canceled due to gay.

2151
01:31:55,380 --> 01:32:03,820
That is exactly what is happening on June 25th show canceled due to gay.

2152
01:32:03,820 --> 01:32:08,060
The gay agenda has finally succeeded in overthrowing an episode of all right.

2153
01:32:08,060 --> 01:32:09,060
Yes.

2154
01:32:09,060 --> 01:32:10,060
There's ramen chat.

2155
01:32:10,060 --> 01:32:11,060
Isn't that the gay agenda?

2156
01:32:11,060 --> 01:32:12,060
Yes.

2157
01:32:12,060 --> 01:32:14,660
All right.

2158
01:32:14,660 --> 01:32:18,660
Let's get into some news this week at the top of the show.

2159
01:32:18,660 --> 01:32:20,940
Again, we're missing Loki unexpectedly.

2160
01:32:20,940 --> 01:32:23,340
Did you want me to start Dark Soccer or did you want to start with.

2161
01:32:23,340 --> 01:32:24,340
Yes, you start.

2162
01:32:24,340 --> 01:32:25,340
OK, I'm going to start with this one.

2163
01:32:25,340 --> 01:32:29,020
So let's talk about the Video Game Hall of Fame.

2164
01:32:29,020 --> 01:32:30,700
Did you know there was a Video Game Hall of Fame?

2165
01:32:30,700 --> 01:32:34,420
I would hope so, because we've talked about it a couple of years past.

2166
01:32:34,420 --> 01:32:38,980
There have only been 12 games inducted into the Hall of Fame previously.

2167
01:32:38,980 --> 01:32:44,420
Doom, Grand Theft Auto 3, The Legend of Zelda, Oregon Trail, Pac-Man, Pong, The Sims, Sonic

2168
01:32:44,420 --> 01:32:49,820
the Hedgehog, Space Invaders, Super Mario Brothers, Tetris, and World of Warcraft.

2169
01:32:49,820 --> 01:32:56,420
So the Video Game Hall of Fame has the nominees for the 2017 class announced.

2170
01:32:56,420 --> 01:33:01,420
You could think of this as something similar to like the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and

2171
01:33:01,420 --> 01:33:04,780
that whole thing, because isn't Journey finally getting inducted to Rock and Roll Hall of

2172
01:33:04,780 --> 01:33:05,780
Fame this year?

2173
01:33:05,780 --> 01:33:07,660
I think I heard something about that.

2174
01:33:07,660 --> 01:33:08,660
Yes.

2175
01:33:09,340 --> 01:33:11,660
There's a series that Steve Perry might actually fucking show up and that has everybody like

2176
01:33:11,660 --> 01:33:14,860
OMG, right?

2177
01:33:14,860 --> 01:33:18,840
Well yeah, Bob Dylan finally accepted the Pulitzer or something like that, or a Nobel

2178
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:19,840
Peace Prize.

2179
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:21,660
So yeah, anything's possible now.

2180
01:33:21,660 --> 01:33:27,020
So anyway, the Strong Museum of Play is located in Rochester, New York.

2181
01:33:27,020 --> 01:33:29,540
That's where this whole thing is located if you want to know where it is physically.

2182
01:33:29,540 --> 01:33:32,780
OK, so here's the part like most podcasts are going to do.

2183
01:33:32,780 --> 01:33:33,780
We're going to do the same thing.

2184
01:33:33,780 --> 01:33:36,500
We're going to read the list and then tell you how much it sucks.

2185
01:33:36,500 --> 01:33:39,700
No, we're going to tell you what we would put in.

2186
01:33:39,700 --> 01:33:45,520
So I'm going to tell you all, I'm going to ask you all of this list, which one is the

2187
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:46,820
most important?

2188
01:33:46,820 --> 01:33:48,820
Which one needs to be in that fucking Hall of Fame already?

2189
01:33:48,820 --> 01:33:49,820
You ready?

2190
01:33:49,820 --> 01:33:50,820
You get to pick one.

2191
01:33:50,820 --> 01:33:52,300
If you pick two, I'm muting you.

2192
01:33:52,300 --> 01:33:53,300
All right.

2193
01:33:53,300 --> 01:33:54,300
I'm cutting your mic off.

2194
01:33:54,300 --> 01:33:55,300
Pick one.

2195
01:33:55,300 --> 01:33:56,300
Here it is.

2196
01:33:56,300 --> 01:34:04,260
Donkey Kong Country, Final Fantasy 7, Halo Combat Evolved, Microsoft Windows.

2197
01:34:04,260 --> 01:34:07,380
Sorry, you all know why I'm laughing.

2198
01:34:07,380 --> 01:34:08,780
Long time, all our losers.

2199
01:34:08,780 --> 01:34:18,780
Microsoft Windows Solitaire, Mortal Kombat, Myst, Pokemon Red and Green, Portal, Resident

2200
01:34:18,780 --> 01:34:25,700
Evil, Street Fighter 2, Tomb Raider and Wii Sports.

2201
01:34:25,700 --> 01:34:27,780
This is fucking easy for me.

2202
01:34:27,780 --> 01:34:28,780
But what do you think?

2203
01:34:28,780 --> 01:34:29,780
One game on that list.

2204
01:34:29,780 --> 01:34:31,780
It's Halo, right?

2205
01:34:32,300 --> 01:34:33,300
I snorted over here.

2206
01:34:33,300 --> 01:34:34,300
Didn't you hear that?

2207
01:34:34,300 --> 01:34:35,300
No.

2208
01:34:35,300 --> 01:34:36,300
I had to.

2209
01:34:36,300 --> 01:34:40,900
And I'm going strictly on objective reasoning here, but I would pick Street Fighter 2.

2210
01:34:40,900 --> 01:34:42,340
And why is that?

2211
01:34:42,340 --> 01:34:47,420
Because it was the game that innovated the fighting game genre and has contributed to

2212
01:34:47,420 --> 01:34:49,000
so many clones.

2213
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:54,020
And I don't even think we'd have would have Mortal Kombat if not for Street Fighter 2.

2214
01:34:54,020 --> 01:34:58,700
So I mean, true, there was just the first Street Fighter and it was OK, but Street Fighter

2215
01:34:58,700 --> 01:35:03,220
2 was the one that gained the real notoriety.

2216
01:35:03,220 --> 01:35:07,620
And now, I mean, the franchise is still going strong today, so it has to count for something.

2217
01:35:07,620 --> 01:35:09,180
All right.

2218
01:35:09,180 --> 01:35:10,180
But Bree, can I pick on Bree?

2219
01:35:10,180 --> 01:35:12,700
Did you pick one from that list that you think needs to be there?

2220
01:35:12,700 --> 01:35:17,420
I was gonna say Mortal Kombat, but then I was just swayed by the knowledge of Jamie

2221
01:35:17,420 --> 01:35:22,700
because I was only in first or second grade when Street Fighter 2 came out, I think.

2222
01:35:22,700 --> 01:35:26,540
So I didn't really know, but I was gonna say Mortal Kombat because the rating system came

2223
01:35:26,540 --> 01:35:27,540
out then, right?

2224
01:35:27,540 --> 01:35:28,540
That's a good point.

2225
01:35:28,580 --> 01:35:32,300
I was just about to say, you know, even though, yes, she makes a compelling argument, you

2226
01:35:32,300 --> 01:35:38,700
make like that is the thing that Mortal Kombat brought the industry is Mortal Kombat caused

2227
01:35:38,700 --> 01:35:41,860
our industry to self-regulate itself.

2228
01:35:41,860 --> 01:35:43,420
So don't discount that.

2229
01:35:43,420 --> 01:35:45,060
That's that's huge what that game did.

2230
01:35:45,060 --> 01:35:50,980
So a fair counterpoint, Gabe, for you.

2231
01:35:50,980 --> 01:35:56,900
So yeah, I would almost I would almost say Street Fighter 2 as well, because Street Fighter

2232
01:35:56,900 --> 01:36:01,740
2 really did change the landscape of fighting games, period.

2233
01:36:01,740 --> 01:36:04,860
Though one can argue, where's Virtua Fighter?

2234
01:36:04,860 --> 01:36:07,500
But anyway, that's more on a 3D thing.

2235
01:36:07,500 --> 01:36:14,540
But on both a personal level, on a very personal level, and then just on the technological

2236
01:36:14,540 --> 01:36:22,020
standpoint, I'm gonna say Donkey Kong Country, because Donkey Kong Country is that was the

2237
01:36:22,020 --> 01:36:27,500
first game to incorporate 3D graphics in a 16-bit system.

2238
01:36:27,500 --> 01:36:28,500
Counter that.

2239
01:36:28,500 --> 01:36:29,500
Counter that.

2240
01:36:29,500 --> 01:36:32,500
There's a game on the TurboGrafx-16 called Sapphire.

2241
01:36:32,500 --> 01:36:33,500
Okay.

2242
01:36:33,500 --> 01:36:34,500
Okay.

2243
01:36:34,500 --> 01:36:35,500
Counter to counter.

2244
01:36:35,500 --> 01:36:38,780
How many kids owned a Super Nintendo versus how many kids owned a TurboGrafx-16?

2245
01:36:38,780 --> 01:36:41,420
But we also had Star Fox.

2246
01:36:41,420 --> 01:36:45,100
We also had Stunt Race.

2247
01:36:45,100 --> 01:36:53,420
So Star Fox was so the significance with Star Fox is because of that Super FX chip

2248
01:36:53,420 --> 01:36:57,940
that allowed a full 3D environment to be played.

2249
01:36:57,940 --> 01:36:58,940
Where was it?

2250
01:36:58,940 --> 01:37:04,180
Where, unlike Mode 7, where everything was flat, you know, the Super FX chip allowed

2251
01:37:04,180 --> 01:37:09,660
actual an actual playable 3D environment, although it was linear and it was pathed,

2252
01:37:09,660 --> 01:37:11,420
you know, you could still do that.

2253
01:37:12,180 --> 01:37:18,980
For me, the significance with Donkey Kong Country was that it utilized actual silicone

2254
01:37:18,980 --> 01:37:26,620
graphic models and animations into a 16-bit system, and it was just an astounding game.

2255
01:37:26,620 --> 01:37:33,420
For me, you know, it proved that anything was possible, you know, VR was just beginning

2256
01:37:33,420 --> 01:37:41,980
to blow up back then, because you're talking 93, 94 that this came out, and that was one

2257
01:37:41,980 --> 01:37:46,540
of the games that ultimately inspired me to want to get into computer animation.

2258
01:37:46,540 --> 01:37:51,640
You had to be 10 or 12 or a kid at the time and see that fucking game for the first time

2259
01:37:51,640 --> 01:37:54,260
where it's like your head just fucking explodes.

2260
01:37:54,260 --> 01:38:00,860
I still have the video of the behind the scenes that Nintendo Power included.

2261
01:38:00,860 --> 01:38:07,220
It was a CD that included the making of Donkey Kong Country and all this other stuff, and

2262
01:38:07,220 --> 01:38:10,340
it highlighted the actual development behind it and things like that.

2263
01:38:10,340 --> 01:38:14,180
Did you have the balls to call the chatroom nerds earlier and then come with that?

2264
01:38:14,180 --> 01:38:18,300
Let me make another step aside from that.

2265
01:38:18,300 --> 01:38:23,140
As far as I was aware, the characters were rendered, yes, but there's still sprites in

2266
01:38:23,140 --> 01:38:28,620
game, so they're still, the rendering was converted into sprites, so it technically

2267
01:38:28,620 --> 01:38:33,180
is still sprite animation, and of course the backgrounds are easy to do because they're

2268
01:38:33,180 --> 01:38:38,780
all going to be a flat 2D entity just rendered from 3D graphics.

2269
01:38:38,780 --> 01:38:39,780
Right, certainly.

2270
01:38:39,780 --> 01:38:40,780
Absolutely.

2271
01:38:40,780 --> 01:38:44,640
So, in that being the respect, maybe the creation of the game had a little bit more tech going

2272
01:38:44,640 --> 01:38:46,860
into it, but at the end of the day, it's still a platformer.

2273
01:38:46,860 --> 01:38:49,940
Oh yeah, it was still a platformer, but I think that was the genius behind it.

2274
01:38:49,940 --> 01:38:56,460
It was the fact that, you know, yes, it was a platformer, but, you know, it was the first

2275
01:38:56,460 --> 01:39:04,460
time you had fully animated, full-framed characters and movement and expressions done

2276
01:39:04,460 --> 01:39:11,380
that was actually genuinely powered by, you know, a silicone graphics machine, not a chip.

2277
01:39:11,380 --> 01:39:12,380
That's where Star Fox comes in.

2278
01:39:12,380 --> 01:39:17,660
Star Fox, you know, they created a proprietary chip, but Donkey Kong Country did not.

2279
01:39:17,660 --> 01:39:22,540
It used an actual silicone graphics, and that wasn't cheap back then.

2280
01:39:22,540 --> 01:39:27,260
For me, Street Fighter II, no contest, but not the reason Jamie said.

2281
01:39:27,260 --> 01:39:32,300
I mean, not that what she said, but for me, it's the arcades in general, like it's not

2282
01:39:32,300 --> 01:39:33,300
even just the fighting games.

2283
01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:38,260
It's just the 90s arcades was defined by Street Fighter II, I think.

2284
01:39:38,260 --> 01:39:39,820
And I think that's it.

2285
01:39:39,820 --> 01:39:42,520
This game probably had a greater impact than any other game.

2286
01:39:42,520 --> 01:39:45,660
It's really close with Pokemon, though, but I don't want to turn off my own mic.

2287
01:39:45,660 --> 01:39:48,980
So that's all I'm going to say.

2288
01:39:48,980 --> 01:39:53,740
So because, well, okay, I can't.

2289
01:39:53,740 --> 01:39:54,740
He wants to.

2290
01:39:54,740 --> 01:39:57,820
I want to so bad, but we need to move on.

2291
01:39:57,820 --> 01:40:01,100
So let's talk about one other thing I will go back and say about Sapphire.

2292
01:40:01,100 --> 01:40:04,380
It was one of the PC Engine Turbo game or duo games.

2293
01:40:04,380 --> 01:40:05,380
So it was CD.

2294
01:40:05,380 --> 01:40:06,380
Yes, it was CD.

2295
01:40:06,380 --> 01:40:07,380
That's why.

2296
01:40:07,380 --> 01:40:08,380
But I'm posting a picture in the chat room.

2297
01:40:08,380 --> 01:40:09,380
But still, wonderful reference.

2298
01:40:09,380 --> 01:40:10,380
Yeah, Sapphire.

2299
01:40:10,380 --> 01:40:11,380
Wonderful reference.

2300
01:40:11,380 --> 01:40:15,700
It goes for like 800 bucks, give or take.

2301
01:40:15,700 --> 01:40:20,380
So anyway, one game that, hey, based on the early reviews might end up in the Hall of

2302
01:40:20,380 --> 01:40:24,820
Fame in 10 years, who knows, Persona 5 finally making its way out this week.

2303
01:40:24,820 --> 01:40:27,340
You know, Persona has its rabid fans.

2304
01:40:27,340 --> 01:40:30,620
People are really freaking excited about Persona 5.

2305
01:40:30,620 --> 01:40:31,900
See, here's the thing.

2306
01:40:31,900 --> 01:40:35,380
And we talked a little bit about this on the call with Bobby earlier tonight.

2307
01:40:35,380 --> 01:40:37,300
I have no hate in my heart for Persona.

2308
01:40:37,300 --> 01:40:40,260
In fact, I played a little bit of Persona 4 on the Vita, and I do think it's really

2309
01:40:40,260 --> 01:40:41,720
cool and a different experience.

2310
01:40:41,720 --> 01:40:45,420
The problem is, like, it takes like 100 hours to get through one of those games.

2311
01:40:45,420 --> 01:40:49,300
And it's like, it's hard enough for me to play the games that I play.

2312
01:40:49,300 --> 01:40:54,820
Like, Bree, would you be able to squeeze in 100 hours to play Persona 5 this week?

2313
01:40:54,820 --> 01:40:58,320
This week?

2314
01:40:58,320 --> 01:41:02,740
One of my volunteers for the event has actually started it and he's like, Oh, you should try

2315
01:41:02,740 --> 01:41:03,740
this.

2316
01:41:03,740 --> 01:41:04,740
I'm like,

2317
01:41:04,740 --> 01:41:05,740
Yeah, yeah.

2318
01:41:05,740 --> 01:41:09,380
Let me pencil you in in 2019.

2319
01:41:09,380 --> 01:41:11,620
But yeah, that's just the type of time commitment it's gonna take.

2320
01:41:11,620 --> 01:41:15,000
But I know, like, especially JRPG fans, very excited about Persona.

2321
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,440
The reviews are off the charts for this game.

2322
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:22,640
It's going to be, you know, this is this is one other interesting thing about this year.

2323
01:41:22,640 --> 01:41:24,180
Lots of solid game reviews.

2324
01:41:24,180 --> 01:41:27,960
You know, it's funny because a couple weeks ago, I think I said, I said, Oh, Zelda Breath

2325
01:41:27,960 --> 01:41:29,200
of Wild is going to be game of the year.

2326
01:41:29,200 --> 01:41:30,200
It's already over.

2327
01:41:30,200 --> 01:41:34,040
And now I'm like, shit, maybe it maybe actually, that was a little early to say that.

2328
01:41:34,040 --> 01:41:37,960
I mean, it really was early to say that, but shit, for some people, it's definitely gonna

2329
01:41:37,960 --> 01:41:38,960
be Persona 5.

2330
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:41,080
I think it just depends on the type of game you're into.

2331
01:41:41,080 --> 01:41:43,960
But like, it's getting a lot of solid reviews over there as well.

2332
01:41:43,960 --> 01:41:46,880
There's other games too that we get into really, this has been a really just good fucking

2333
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:48,440
year for games so far.

2334
01:41:48,440 --> 01:41:55,160
So anyway, Persona 5, of course, going to be coming out on PlayStation 3 and 4 because

2335
01:41:55,160 --> 01:41:57,000
the game was originally supposed to be a PS3 exclusive.

2336
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:58,000
That's true.

2337
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:59,000
It's just taken.

2338
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:00,000
They've been taking their sweet ass time.

2339
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:01,000
Smart move though.

2340
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:06,180
You want, hey, we talked about Andromeda not being a well-cooked meal last week, and now

2341
01:42:06,180 --> 01:42:08,920
this one is going to be a well-cooked meal, so that'll be exciting.

2342
01:42:08,920 --> 01:42:12,180
However, here's the thing, the share button is going to be disabled.

2343
01:42:12,180 --> 01:42:13,840
You will not be able to share the pictures.

2344
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:17,120
You won't be able to stream the game, at least natively through the PlayStation 4.

2345
01:42:17,120 --> 01:42:20,860
They have cut all of that off, and Atlus did this.

2346
01:42:20,860 --> 01:42:25,380
I guess this happens in other Japanese game releases on PlayStation 4.

2347
01:42:25,380 --> 01:42:29,660
I know like cut scenes in other games have been blocked and so forth, but the whole game

2348
01:42:29,660 --> 01:42:30,660
blocked.

2349
01:42:30,660 --> 01:42:35,460
You are not going to be able to stream it, although we all know all you're going to need

2350
01:42:35,460 --> 01:42:40,080
is a capture card, the extra outside material, and people will be streaming this.

2351
01:42:40,080 --> 01:42:47,340
So in my opinion, it's just giving those people an advantage, so to speak, in the competition

2352
01:42:47,340 --> 01:42:49,340
market, but it is what it is.

2353
01:42:49,340 --> 01:42:50,740
They're not going to stop it.

2354
01:42:50,740 --> 01:42:52,140
Yeah, they state why they blocked the share.

2355
01:42:52,140 --> 01:42:53,140
Story spoilers.

2356
01:42:53,140 --> 01:42:54,140
That's really what it is.

2357
01:42:54,140 --> 01:42:55,460
They just don't want people ruining it.

2358
01:42:55,460 --> 01:42:56,460
But it's going to happen anyway.

2359
01:42:56,460 --> 01:42:58,940
But I'm saying like block Andromeda, if that's the case.

2360
01:42:58,940 --> 01:42:59,940
Block Zelda.

2361
01:42:59,940 --> 01:43:01,900
Well, but that's EA and Nintendo.

2362
01:43:01,900 --> 01:43:02,900
That's not Atlus.

2363
01:43:02,900 --> 01:43:07,060
Yeah, but I mean, if that's the premise for why they're going to block you, those stories,

2364
01:43:07,060 --> 01:43:08,600
we want to spoil the story.

2365
01:43:08,600 --> 01:43:13,900
It's like, it takes 100 hours, give or take, you know, to beat.

2366
01:43:13,900 --> 01:43:16,180
It'll be the end of the year at the least.

2367
01:43:16,180 --> 01:43:19,460
So I mean, before really, what are you ruining?

2368
01:43:19,460 --> 01:43:23,300
But I mean, if it's one thing, if they want to block the cut scenes or the big story moments

2369
01:43:23,300 --> 01:43:28,220
or things like that, but I mean, like, let us stream the battle sequences and things

2370
01:43:28,220 --> 01:43:33,580
like that, at least, you know, the actual game elements, a little weird, but I just

2371
01:43:33,580 --> 01:43:35,660
kind of think it's going to end up being useless.

2372
01:43:35,660 --> 01:43:38,300
Okay, so the PlayStation can't do it natively.

2373
01:43:38,320 --> 01:43:42,000
Well, people have capture cards in their computer.

2374
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:43,000
They're going to get around it.

2375
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:44,000
Yep.

2376
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:45,000
So that's that.

2377
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:48,180
This game will, game will be streamed, actually, it's probably going to, it's going to make

2378
01:43:48,180 --> 01:43:51,200
more people want to stream it because they're going to feel like they have the exclusive

2379
01:43:51,200 --> 01:43:52,200
on it.

2380
01:43:52,200 --> 01:43:53,200
Now that this news is out there.

2381
01:43:53,200 --> 01:43:54,560
You just made this a hotter property.

2382
01:43:54,560 --> 01:43:55,560
Yep.

2383
01:43:55,560 --> 01:43:56,560
You told us we can't.

2384
01:43:56,560 --> 01:43:57,560
We will.

2385
01:43:57,560 --> 01:43:58,560
I know the internet.

2386
01:43:58,560 --> 01:44:02,840
I know the internet overuses this fucking term, but it's Streisand effect.

2387
01:44:02,840 --> 01:44:04,440
It's true, man.

2388
01:44:04,440 --> 01:44:07,760
That like most overused thing on the internet, but anyway, all right.

2389
01:44:08,300 --> 01:44:15,280
To register participation for this week's episode of orange lounge radio at vognetwork.com,

2390
01:44:15,280 --> 01:44:20,120
use the passphrase poison, dark Sakura, what do you got for us?

2391
01:44:20,120 --> 01:44:23,800
Well, some stuff about Oculus ish.

2392
01:44:23,800 --> 01:44:29,000
The co-founder Palmer lucky is leaving Facebook.

2393
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:34,320
He had his last day already.

2394
01:44:34,320 --> 01:44:38,860
There's no real notice as to why or not.

2395
01:44:38,860 --> 01:44:48,340
However, it was revealed that he was a supporter of 45 because that name is not worth mentioning

2396
01:44:48,340 --> 01:44:51,660
on the show.

2397
01:44:51,660 --> 01:44:56,140
And he also created these memes that attacked Hillary Clinton.

2398
01:44:56,140 --> 01:44:57,140
Yeah.

2399
01:44:57,140 --> 01:45:00,300
And from what, you know, again, I want to watch the politics and everything, but my,

2400
01:45:00,300 --> 01:45:02,220
my understanding is it was those memes.

2401
01:45:02,220 --> 01:45:07,000
And they, I mean, it's, you know, people feel however they feel politically, but it

2402
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:10,600
was the memes and the involvement and all that stuff that people were really taking

2403
01:45:10,600 --> 01:45:11,600
issue with it.

2404
01:45:11,600 --> 01:45:13,180
It was like, it wasn't just the politics.

2405
01:45:13,180 --> 01:45:16,680
It was the heavy involvement in what was kind of, it was a big smear campaign.

2406
01:45:16,680 --> 01:45:20,520
It wasn't pizza gate, but it was, it was a smear campaign.

2407
01:45:20,520 --> 01:45:21,520
That's what it was.

2408
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:22,520
Plain and simple.

2409
01:45:22,520 --> 01:45:27,560
So anyway, and so, um, Facebook's, uh, statement about it is just that they, uh, wish him well

2410
01:45:27,560 --> 01:45:32,200
and thought his innovative spirit helped kickstart the modern VR revolution and build an internet

2411
01:45:32,200 --> 01:45:33,180
industry.

2412
01:45:33,180 --> 01:45:36,540
Um, but we've been hiding him in the basement for the past six months until his contract

2413
01:45:36,540 --> 01:45:37,540
ran out.

2414
01:45:37,540 --> 01:45:38,540
Anyway.

2415
01:45:38,540 --> 01:45:39,540
Cause that seems obvious.

2416
01:45:39,540 --> 01:45:40,540
What's been happening here.

2417
01:45:40,540 --> 01:45:43,340
Where, where, where the fuck has he been?

2418
01:45:43,340 --> 01:45:44,340
Yeah.

2419
01:45:44,340 --> 01:45:46,720
In, in a, they kept him in the cellar.

2420
01:45:46,720 --> 01:45:52,780
They kept him in the naughty room, clearly Christian gray was like, come here in my room

2421
01:45:52,780 --> 01:45:54,780
of secrets.

2422
01:45:54,780 --> 01:45:59,340
Oh, let's not give that any attention.

2423
01:45:59,340 --> 01:46:00,340
I couldn't help myself.

2424
01:46:00,340 --> 01:46:02,200
Oh, that's so disgusting.

2425
01:46:02,200 --> 01:46:06,320
Bobby Black Wolf also points out, you know, besides the, besides the political stuff,

2426
01:46:06,320 --> 01:46:12,080
he said he also violated an NDA and caused Facebook to lose a $500 million lawsuits.

2427
01:46:12,080 --> 01:46:14,440
That was kind of a big deal.

2428
01:46:14,440 --> 01:46:16,000
That's just a little thing.

2429
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:17,000
Yeah.

2430
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:18,000
An incident.

2431
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:19,000
What was sort of a thing?

2432
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:22,320
A performance improvement plan was put in his file.

2433
01:46:22,320 --> 01:46:27,400
AKA the punishment basement.

2434
01:46:27,400 --> 01:46:28,400
He was pipped.

2435
01:46:28,660 --> 01:46:31,620
And Black Wolf wants to clarify, he didn't create the memes.

2436
01:46:31,620 --> 01:46:33,340
He gave the money to the people who made the meme.

2437
01:46:33,340 --> 01:46:34,340
Sorry.

2438
01:46:34,340 --> 01:46:35,340
I thought I had made that clear.

2439
01:46:35,340 --> 01:46:38,820
Well, he's still responsible for their inception.

2440
01:46:38,820 --> 01:46:45,880
So he, he, he gave them the, the, the markers, I guess you could say, anyway, anyway, anyway,

2441
01:46:45,880 --> 01:46:46,880
what else was there?

2442
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:47,880
That's it.

2443
01:46:47,880 --> 01:46:49,880
No, I thought that was, oh, I thought,

2444
01:46:49,880 --> 01:46:50,880
It's your turn.

2445
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:51,880
Is it?

2446
01:46:51,880 --> 01:46:52,880
It's your turn.

2447
01:46:52,880 --> 01:46:53,880
All right, fine.

2448
01:46:53,880 --> 01:46:57,300
We can talk about destiny too, because yeah, no, you're right.

2449
01:46:57,300 --> 01:46:59,960
Destiny 2 finally got confirmed this week.

2450
01:46:59,960 --> 01:47:00,960
Yay.

2451
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:02,640
You know, it was already kind of leaked last week.

2452
01:47:02,640 --> 01:47:06,840
I think there were some posters that were around out there.

2453
01:47:06,840 --> 01:47:12,760
But anyway, there's a destiny 2 is being confirmed and there's some actual artwork for the game

2454
01:47:12,760 --> 01:47:15,560
that's now out there as well as a trailer and so forth.

2455
01:47:15,560 --> 01:47:19,640
So a lot of folks that are getting hyped for destiny 2.

2456
01:47:19,640 --> 01:47:26,120
Also you will not again be able to carry over the exact same characters.

2457
01:47:26,140 --> 01:47:31,700
But the other big news about destiny 2, you are going to get to play this on PC.

2458
01:47:31,700 --> 01:47:35,740
Destiny 2 will be out for PC, which means it's keyboard and mouse time.

2459
01:47:35,740 --> 01:47:40,260
So that's going to be pretty exciting because for first person shooters, you know, it's

2460
01:47:40,260 --> 01:47:43,500
funny because I think if I were to go back 10 years on this show, there was a point where

2461
01:47:43,500 --> 01:47:45,620
I was like, oh, controllers are still really good.

2462
01:47:45,620 --> 01:47:49,460
But I think just something has evolved over the years and like keyboard and mouse, I like,

2463
01:47:49,460 --> 01:47:51,180
that's the only way I could play shooters.

2464
01:47:51,180 --> 01:47:56,020
Like well, I play Overwatch on PS4, but I'm better at it on PC.

2465
01:47:56,160 --> 01:47:59,620
Of course, so is everybody else, but you know.

2466
01:47:59,620 --> 01:48:05,460
I found that the pistol works just like a sniper rifle if you put the shot on the scope

2467
01:48:05,460 --> 01:48:06,460
on it.

2468
01:48:06,460 --> 01:48:07,960
So that's how I've been playing through the whole thing of Andromeda.

2469
01:48:07,960 --> 01:48:08,960
Oh, over Andromeda.

2470
01:48:08,960 --> 01:48:09,960
Yeah.

2471
01:48:09,960 --> 01:48:10,960
Yeah.

2472
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:12,880
It's been especially good to have that fine control on a mouse.

2473
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:17,000
Andromeda multiplayer is hard with the controller for me because I can't get headshots.

2474
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:18,280
It's just, it's hard.

2475
01:48:18,280 --> 01:48:23,560
I have to play like people that can do pew pew fire lasers and things that like space

2476
01:48:23,560 --> 01:48:24,980
magic all the way.

2477
01:48:24,980 --> 01:48:25,980
Space magic.

2478
01:48:26,040 --> 01:48:29,320
So on PC, I'll be able to be a little more accurate.

2479
01:48:29,320 --> 01:48:35,840
So I'm, I have to say, even I myself, I'm interested when it comes to PC.

2480
01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:40,720
I want to hear a little more about what the expansions are going to look like for destiny

2481
01:48:40,720 --> 01:48:44,320
because that destiny too, because that's where I got a little turned off on the first game

2482
01:48:44,320 --> 01:48:47,820
is that then it was like every few months, it's like, you have to have this expansion.

2483
01:48:47,820 --> 01:48:49,080
You have to have this expansion.

2484
01:48:49,080 --> 01:48:52,960
And now there's this other thing and it's like, I kind of, I kind of fell off the wagon

2485
01:48:52,980 --> 01:48:59,060
at some point and didn't really fucking feel like getting back on, you know, and the, the,

2486
01:48:59,060 --> 01:49:02,940
there wasn't really, I feel like the way they were trying to sell it too was weird.

2487
01:49:02,940 --> 01:49:08,860
Like, well, we're not going to sell just a catch up pack, but we'll sell a destiny plus

2488
01:49:08,860 --> 01:49:12,060
this is like, they want to resell me stuff I already bought.

2489
01:49:12,060 --> 01:49:17,780
And I'm like, no, it was one of the, it was one of the poorest executions when it came

2490
01:49:17,780 --> 01:49:18,860
to the downloaded content.

2491
01:49:18,860 --> 01:49:22,460
Cause I barely had, as I, I loved the first destiny.

2492
01:49:22,460 --> 01:49:25,880
I really, you know, the, the just the basic of it then right.

2493
01:49:25,880 --> 01:49:27,560
You know, I'm taking King.

2494
01:49:27,560 --> 01:49:32,480
So then I got to taking King cause I heard it was a massive improvement over, um, the,

2495
01:49:32,480 --> 01:49:35,360
the initial destiny and I'm like, okay, great.

2496
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:40,040
So, you know, I got out on a deal, I sold my other destiny game and we knew everything

2497
01:49:40,040 --> 01:49:41,040
was great.

2498
01:49:41,040 --> 01:49:45,560
And just to only find out what six months later, if that rise of iron and I'm like,

2499
01:49:45,560 --> 01:49:48,680
you know, I'm like, okay, how much is that going to cost?

2500
01:49:48,680 --> 01:49:52,980
And then $30 just for the excess said whole.

2501
01:49:52,980 --> 01:49:59,780
So I start cursing in Spanish in my head and I'm like, but I just, I just spent 40 on right

2502
01:49:59,780 --> 01:50:03,060
on, on taking King destiny and taking King.

2503
01:50:03,060 --> 01:50:08,220
And you know, and now I need rise of iron and which I heard was terrible, um, with the,

2504
01:50:08,220 --> 01:50:13,080
with a few exceptions, but you know, as a developer, you know, if you're a developer

2505
01:50:13,080 --> 01:50:17,100
out there, indie AAA, cut the shit with that already.

2506
01:50:17,100 --> 01:50:18,100
Stop.

2507
01:50:18,100 --> 01:50:21,600
You, you, you, you know, cause now they've announced destiny too.

2508
01:50:21,600 --> 01:50:26,280
And now, you know, this whole hundred dollar pre-order thing, you know, to get both doc

2509
01:50:26,280 --> 01:50:31,400
to get, you know, pre-ordered the downloaded packs, you know, the DLC for that as well.

2510
01:50:31,400 --> 01:50:36,520
And you know, you really want to create this fault line between your cut, you know, in

2511
01:50:36,520 --> 01:50:38,040
your customers.

2512
01:50:38,040 --> 01:50:39,680
That's going to be the way to do it.

2513
01:50:39,680 --> 01:50:45,880
And it just, just off, cause I remember meeting a few people who made that game and they expressed

2514
01:50:45,880 --> 01:50:51,380
just, just, just acidic disdain for those business decisions behind.

2515
01:50:51,380 --> 01:50:56,560
There was also, remember when the game first came out, there were all these rumblings about

2516
01:50:56,560 --> 01:50:59,820
they fucking re hit the reset button on that game.

2517
01:50:59,820 --> 01:51:03,980
Like two years ago, it was, it's found at the farm has he 15 had a very similar path

2518
01:51:03,980 --> 01:51:04,980
of fantasy.

2519
01:51:04,980 --> 01:51:07,920
Is that destiny was supposed to be something like completely different.

2520
01:51:07,920 --> 01:51:10,940
And then they hit the reset button and then it's like, we have to fucking get a game out

2521
01:51:10,940 --> 01:51:11,940
and it's happening now.

2522
01:51:11,940 --> 01:51:14,080
And you could even feel it when you're playing the game, you're like, there's this whole

2523
01:51:14,080 --> 01:51:15,080
rich story.

2524
01:51:15,080 --> 01:51:18,000
And then all of a sudden the story just kind of just stops for the last half of the game.

2525
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,500
And then that's it, but up, up, up, up.

2526
01:51:20,500 --> 01:51:24,240
That's like, what the fuck was that?

2527
01:51:24,240 --> 01:51:26,920
And that's one of my other biggest pet peeves with that.

2528
01:51:26,920 --> 01:51:32,880
Don't don't, don't, don't sell me this massively expansive game, you know, where, you know,

2529
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:37,140
you're going to have all these unique story experiences, you know, buzzword after buzzword

2530
01:51:37,140 --> 01:51:41,520
after buzzword only for me to find out that, Oh, in order to find out more about who you

2531
01:51:41,520 --> 01:51:47,460
just killed and who's with you now, you know, here's a card, which you can't look at until

2532
01:51:47,460 --> 01:51:52,720
you go on our website, F off because like, I'm here playing on console, you know, and

2533
01:51:52,720 --> 01:51:54,600
I was saying like, you didn't even make it for PC.

2534
01:51:54,600 --> 01:51:58,320
And you want to tell me to go online to look at a stupid car so I can find out who I killed

2535
01:51:58,320 --> 01:52:00,760
and why get out of here with that nonsense.

2536
01:52:00,760 --> 01:52:03,600
So I'm good.

2537
01:52:03,600 --> 01:52:06,760
I I'm interested in destiny two on PC.

2538
01:52:06,760 --> 01:52:10,000
If it's clear that they're going to take a different path with some of the way they've

2539
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:14,680
done the DLC and stuff, but I'm not exactly going to hold my breath on that.

2540
01:52:14,680 --> 01:52:15,680
So we'll see.

2541
01:52:15,680 --> 01:52:16,680
I'm not.

2542
01:52:16,680 --> 01:52:17,680
We'll see.

2543
01:52:17,680 --> 01:52:18,680
All right.

2544
01:52:18,680 --> 01:52:19,680
Moving right along.

2545
01:52:19,680 --> 01:52:20,680
Dark Sakura.

2546
01:52:20,680 --> 01:52:24,000
Well, I have a couple of stories.

2547
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:25,880
One of them is about mad cats.

2548
01:52:25,880 --> 01:52:31,720
Bobby already talked about it, so I'm not going to go too much into detail, but, um,

2549
01:52:31,720 --> 01:52:37,880
mad cats filed for chapter seven bankruptcy and as of March 30th, they started, uh, liquidating.

2550
01:52:37,880 --> 01:52:44,160
So they're basically going to pay off all their lenders ASAP, um, chapter seven.

2551
01:52:44,160 --> 01:52:47,000
The difference between that and chapter 11 is I'm sure we've heard of both in the business

2552
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:56,480
world is that, um, chapter seven, uh, would make you, uh, liquidate and basically vacate

2553
01:52:56,480 --> 01:52:58,520
board of directors and officers.

2554
01:52:58,520 --> 01:53:00,440
It's the death of the company.

2555
01:53:00,440 --> 01:53:02,080
Chapter 11 usually allows for restructuring.

2556
01:53:02,080 --> 01:53:03,080
Yeah.

2557
01:53:03,080 --> 01:53:04,840
Chapter 11 is like Radio Shack right now.

2558
01:53:04,840 --> 01:53:05,840
Right.

2559
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:11,680
Uh, what's the other, it was not yet Sears, but, but in the coming days it's happening.

2560
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:12,680
Yup.

2561
01:53:12,680 --> 01:53:18,920
It's a sad, mad cats, as we know, we're co-publishers for some of the rock band games.

2562
01:53:18,920 --> 01:53:22,240
Um, they also made many, many a cheap controller.

2563
01:53:22,240 --> 01:53:25,320
I still blame Hori for their death cause Hori makes better controllers.

2564
01:53:25,320 --> 01:53:28,080
Um, they do actually.

2565
01:53:28,080 --> 01:53:33,000
And I mean in 2016 their CEO resigned, they laid off 37% of their employees.

2566
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:36,040
So none of this should really be a surprise.

2567
01:53:36,040 --> 01:53:40,480
Their stock's been shit basically for a while now.

2568
01:53:40,480 --> 01:53:44,440
So I'm sure that anyone who watches financial markets saw this coming.

2569
01:53:44,440 --> 01:53:49,800
So the other news, which is also shitty news.

2570
01:53:49,800 --> 01:53:59,560
It was stated that as of March 31st, um, a couple of people at Squenix left, Square Enix,

2571
01:53:59,560 --> 01:54:05,520
and that was Yoshinori Yamagishi and Isamu Kamikokurio.

2572
01:54:05,520 --> 01:54:08,040
I'm going to say that Kamikokurio.

2573
01:54:08,040 --> 01:54:11,160
So they have both left the company.

2574
01:54:11,160 --> 01:54:12,680
I was such a big fan too.

2575
01:54:12,680 --> 01:54:13,680
What did they do?

2576
01:54:13,680 --> 01:54:15,680
Yamagishi produced Star Ocean and Valkyrie Profile.

2577
01:54:15,680 --> 01:54:16,680
Oh shit.

2578
01:54:16,680 --> 01:54:17,680
Okay.

2579
01:54:17,680 --> 01:54:18,680
Wow.

2580
01:54:18,680 --> 01:54:19,680
Yeah.

2581
01:54:19,680 --> 01:54:20,680
That is a big deal.

2582
01:54:20,680 --> 01:54:21,680
And then, um, I'm going to say this again.

2583
01:54:21,680 --> 01:54:31,400
Kamikokurio, um, gave a Final Fantasy 13 trilogy, Final Fantasy 15, and the third birthday.

2584
01:54:31,400 --> 01:54:37,440
So both of them resigned so that they can move on to new projects.

2585
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:38,500
What did he do on 15?

2586
01:54:38,500 --> 01:54:39,720
He wasn't the producer of 15.

2587
01:54:39,720 --> 01:54:40,720
That was somebody that was...

2588
01:54:40,720 --> 01:54:42,200
He was art director.

2589
01:54:42,200 --> 01:54:44,720
Oh, interesting.

2590
01:54:44,720 --> 01:54:49,900
I guess that may be a, just a situation of he had another job that he wanted to take

2591
01:54:49,900 --> 01:54:51,840
somewhere else or what have you.

2592
01:54:51,840 --> 01:54:56,200
Probably not a, cause when you, when, if I hear about departures related to 15, I kind

2593
01:54:56,200 --> 01:55:01,060
of go, I raise an eyebrow a little bit like, oh, but that, but speaking of fucking games

2594
01:55:01,060 --> 01:55:04,540
I need to play, did you know the whole Gladio thing came out this week?

2595
01:55:04,540 --> 01:55:06,020
I haven't even got a chance to touch that yet.

2596
01:55:06,020 --> 01:55:11,660
I have a feeling that they're all doing this sort of Ayn Rand-esque Atlas Shrugged thing

2597
01:55:11,660 --> 01:55:17,980
where all of the best developers go move to their own island and then just do menial work.

2598
01:55:17,980 --> 01:55:23,460
Okay, and by the way, Atlas Shrugged was a crappy book, but it has become my example

2599
01:55:23,460 --> 01:55:27,300
for people bringing themselves out of the limelight and leaving their jobs.

2600
01:55:27,300 --> 01:55:32,020
I'm really curious to hear who's going to get put on Final Fantasy 16, cause you know

2601
01:55:32,020 --> 01:55:33,020
it's coming.

2602
01:55:33,020 --> 01:55:34,020
You?

2603
01:55:34,020 --> 01:55:35,020
They're going to have me do it.

2604
01:55:35,020 --> 01:55:36,020
Calamity Jamie presents.

2605
01:55:36,020 --> 01:55:42,500
I'm just going to be like, that character needs more straps on his shorts and one leg

2606
01:55:42,500 --> 01:55:47,020
should be longer than the other and there need to be more buckles on the shirt.

2607
01:55:47,020 --> 01:55:50,440
So he needs to look very, very pretty.

2608
01:55:50,440 --> 01:55:53,780
Also Eris will be back so I can kill her again.

2609
01:55:53,780 --> 01:55:58,900
This guy needs a bigger fro cause I'm thinking of what's his face from 13.

2610
01:55:58,900 --> 01:55:59,900
Sazh.

2611
01:55:59,900 --> 01:56:00,900
That had the bird.

2612
01:56:00,900 --> 01:56:01,900
Yeah.

2613
01:56:01,900 --> 01:56:04,340
And this one needs a bird cage in his fro.

2614
01:56:04,340 --> 01:56:10,940
Like kind of like a pre-French Revolution-esque wig that had all of that stuff in there.

2615
01:56:10,940 --> 01:56:11,940
Yes.

2616
01:56:11,940 --> 01:56:12,940
Yes.

2617
01:56:12,940 --> 01:56:13,940
This guy needs to be gay.

2618
01:56:14,940 --> 01:56:16,940
This is okay.

2619
01:56:16,940 --> 01:56:17,940
Okay.

2620
01:56:17,940 --> 01:56:23,940
That's me as a game designer.

2621
01:56:23,940 --> 01:56:27,140
I'd be a good character designer.

2622
01:56:27,140 --> 01:56:33,780
There are rumors and this could just be fanwank, but there's some rumors that Naoki Yoshida

2623
01:56:33,780 --> 01:56:38,820
could be the one that ends up doing 16 and it's his reward for basically saving the fucking

2624
01:56:38,820 --> 01:56:45,220
franchise because Naoki Yoshida is the one that did Final Fantasy 14 A Realm Reborn.

2625
01:56:45,220 --> 01:56:51,020
So he's the one that took 1.0 and then made the new 2.0 and basically saved the entire

2626
01:56:51,020 --> 01:56:52,700
fucking day.

2627
01:56:52,700 --> 01:56:56,140
So there's rumors that he's going to, I mean, they're just rumors.

2628
01:56:56,140 --> 01:56:58,940
There's rumors that he's going to get to do a single player Final Fantasy game.

2629
01:56:58,940 --> 01:57:03,900
And I, that would be, I would be huge and I would be really fucking excited if that's

2630
01:57:03,900 --> 01:57:04,900
the case.

2631
01:57:04,900 --> 01:57:08,780
I mean, I would hope that 14 gets left in good hands while he has time to go do that.

2632
01:57:08,780 --> 01:57:11,940
But, um, I would be really fucking excited about that if that happened.

2633
01:57:11,940 --> 01:57:14,500
Oh, and yes, Reginator, one character will have more strap-ons.

2634
01:57:14,500 --> 01:57:16,300
Oh God.

2635
01:57:16,300 --> 01:57:17,300
Moving on.

2636
01:57:17,300 --> 01:57:22,180
Speaking, oh, speaking of Final Fantasy 14, gosh, it wasn't supposed to be a segue, but

2637
01:57:22,180 --> 01:57:23,180
it worked out.

2638
01:57:23,180 --> 01:57:26,260
Final Fantasy 14 has expanded the free trial program.

2639
01:57:26,260 --> 01:57:30,960
So, uh, you can now, if you've never played Final Fantasy 14 before, you can now play

2640
01:57:30,960 --> 01:57:36,340
up to level 35 as opposed to level 20, you can play up to level 35 with no time restriction

2641
01:57:36,340 --> 01:57:37,340
now.

2642
01:57:37,340 --> 01:57:38,340
So you're not limited to 14 days.

2643
01:57:38,900 --> 01:57:40,220
You can play as long as you want.

2644
01:57:40,220 --> 01:57:43,740
However, you do not get to join free companies.

2645
01:57:43,740 --> 01:57:46,140
You can join parties and link shells, but not free companies.

2646
01:57:46,140 --> 01:57:48,420
Um, so yeah, you can check that out.

2647
01:57:48,420 --> 01:57:52,100
That is all of course, to try to get more pre-orders in for Stormblood, Stormblood will

2648
01:57:52,100 --> 01:57:54,100
be coming out over the summer.

2649
01:57:54,100 --> 01:57:56,140
Those free companies ain't free.

2650
01:57:56,140 --> 01:58:01,220
Um, but what's also interesting, the move that 14 is making is that, um, once Stormblood

2651
01:58:01,220 --> 01:58:05,280
comes out, they are not going to sell the Heavensward expansion any longer.

2652
01:58:05,280 --> 01:58:07,540
It will just be looped right into the base game.

2653
01:58:08,140 --> 01:58:11,420
This took Blizzard some time to do with World of Warcraft.

2654
01:58:11,420 --> 01:58:13,780
Although to be fair, I believe they do it now.

2655
01:58:13,780 --> 01:58:17,500
I believe there's Legion and there's everything up to Legion.

2656
01:58:17,500 --> 01:58:21,340
So, um, but for a while you kind of had to buy like two or three expansions to get current.

2657
01:58:21,340 --> 01:58:25,060
But, um, yeah, you won't have to do that with Final Fantasy 14.

2658
01:58:25,060 --> 01:58:26,060
So that's pretty cool.

2659
01:58:26,060 --> 01:58:29,420
Uh, and they're not going to like, they're not going to suddenly charge you more money

2660
01:58:29,420 --> 01:58:32,260
or anything like it's just going to be Heavensward will just be included in the cost of the base

2661
01:58:32,260 --> 01:58:33,260
game.

2662
01:58:33,260 --> 01:58:34,260
It's just all right there.

2663
01:58:34,260 --> 01:58:35,260
So that's pretty cool.

2664
01:58:35,260 --> 01:58:36,260
Not bad.

2665
01:58:36,260 --> 01:58:37,260
Not bad.

2666
01:58:37,980 --> 01:58:42,420
The new series is coming to Netflix and yes, this actually is coming to North America,

2667
01:58:42,420 --> 01:58:45,020
but it's, um, supposedly something that's starting in Japan.

2668
01:58:45,020 --> 01:58:48,980
Uh, it's called Final Fantasy, Daddy of Light.

2669
01:58:48,980 --> 01:58:55,500
Now here's the thing, because we can make a lot of jokes about Daddy of Light, um, no,

2670
01:58:55,500 --> 01:58:57,980
I think it's just, I think it's just a translation thing.

2671
01:58:57,980 --> 01:59:01,660
I don't think, don't, don't take the name too literally you guys too late.

2672
01:59:01,660 --> 01:59:02,660
So here's the thing.

2673
01:59:02,660 --> 01:59:08,420
It actually is inspired by a blog that was kept by a father and son where they were actually

2674
01:59:08,420 --> 01:59:13,220
playing Final Fantasy 14 together, but it helped their own relationship out in that

2675
01:59:13,220 --> 01:59:14,580
they were kind of getting to bond.

2676
01:59:14,580 --> 01:59:17,780
So it was like they played this game, but they were bonding through the game.

2677
01:59:17,780 --> 01:59:22,260
And so it was helping them in real life function as father and son a little more.

2678
01:59:22,260 --> 01:59:23,420
So I think it's an interesting story.

2679
01:59:23,420 --> 01:59:29,240
So it's not directly about Final Fantasy 14, but Final Fantasy 14 plays like a key role

2680
01:59:29,240 --> 01:59:31,220
in the whole storytelling things.

2681
01:59:31,220 --> 01:59:32,220
That's kind of neat.

2682
01:59:32,220 --> 01:59:36,620
Um, so yeah, you can, uh, there is a trailer out there if you want to check that out.

2683
01:59:36,620 --> 01:59:43,900
Uh, yeah, Netflix Japan will get this, uh, April 20th, Netflix Stateside will get it

2684
01:59:43,900 --> 01:59:45,700
this fall.

2685
01:59:45,700 --> 01:59:47,020
I definitely am interested.

2686
01:59:47,020 --> 01:59:48,020
Yeah.

2687
01:59:48,020 --> 01:59:49,020
I'd like to check this out too.

2688
01:59:49,020 --> 01:59:55,100
You may not know, but Netflix does translate a lot of their shows in for other countries.

2689
01:59:55,100 --> 01:59:58,460
So the fact that it's happening this way too, it's kind of cool.

2690
01:59:58,460 --> 01:59:59,460
Yeah.

2691
01:59:59,460 --> 02:00:04,180
Netflix Japan's game is, although actually in Japan, MBS and TBS are getting this in

2692
02:00:04,180 --> 02:00:05,180
Japan as well.

2693
02:00:05,180 --> 02:00:08,380
It's not only a Netflix thing, so pretty neat.

2694
02:00:08,380 --> 02:00:12,100
Anyway, one more thing for you guys, then we'll get to the classic game of the week.

2695
02:00:12,100 --> 02:00:15,260
Let's talk about Call of Duty Infinite Warfare.

2696
02:00:15,260 --> 02:00:20,580
Uh, there is a new pack available this week, uh, which you can actually buy this online.

2697
02:00:20,580 --> 02:00:27,700
You can buy now a multiplayer voiceover pack featuring Method Man.

2698
02:00:27,700 --> 02:00:28,700
That's right.

2699
02:00:28,700 --> 02:00:34,540
The rapper, producer, and actor dials up the intensity, updating you on killstreaks, enemy

2700
02:00:34,540 --> 02:00:39,700
activity, and adding some extra flavor to every multiplayer firefight.

2701
02:00:39,700 --> 02:00:43,740
And so you can actually check out what, uh, oops, there's actually like a YouTube where

2702
02:00:43,740 --> 02:00:45,100
you can check out some of this.

2703
02:00:45,100 --> 02:00:46,100
Yeah, you heard that.

2704
02:00:46,100 --> 02:00:48,100
Thor in position for their submission.

2705
02:00:48,100 --> 02:00:51,100
The atomizer strike, waiting for your word, homie.

2706
02:00:51,100 --> 02:00:55,500
Hey, yo, my G, you got a drone package at your discretion, that means whenever you want

2707
02:00:55,500 --> 02:00:56,500
to use it.

2708
02:00:56,500 --> 02:00:57,500
Gun game.

2709
02:00:57,500 --> 02:01:02,860
Okay, so if you want Method Man barking in your ear at every corner, you can do that.

2710
02:01:02,860 --> 02:01:09,380
Um, the other, uh, pack you can check out is a UK Special Forces voiceover pack, uh,

2711
02:01:09,380 --> 02:01:13,340
which is Craig Fairbrass as Ghost from Modern Warfare 2.

2712
02:01:13,340 --> 02:01:14,340
Let's go to work.

2713
02:01:14,340 --> 02:01:17,340
Care package loaded up and waiting for your mark.

2714
02:01:17,340 --> 02:01:18,340
Nice.

2715
02:01:18,340 --> 02:01:19,340
Remote uplink successful.

2716
02:01:19,340 --> 02:01:23,540
Well, that went pan-shaped, didn't it?

2717
02:01:23,540 --> 02:01:30,540
That I would like to, I just want to offer my services to Activision for a Rob Roberts

2718
02:01:30,540 --> 02:01:32,880
expansion pack for Call of Duty.

2719
02:01:32,880 --> 02:01:36,900
And I think if you guys want this to happen, um, you could actually tweet at Activision

2720
02:01:36,900 --> 02:01:42,460
and let them know you would actually pay $2 for a Rob Roberts, uh, voice pack for Call

2721
02:01:42,460 --> 02:01:44,700
of Duty Infinite Warfare.

2722
02:01:44,700 --> 02:01:45,700
Let me give you a little preview.

2723
02:01:45,700 --> 02:01:46,700
You ready?

2724
02:01:46,700 --> 02:01:47,700
Thank you.

2725
02:01:47,700 --> 02:01:50,700
I was just gonna say, what the hell would you say?

2726
02:01:50,860 --> 02:01:55,860
Don't you know that bitch is shooting at you?

2727
02:01:55,860 --> 02:01:58,860
Get the hell out of here!

2728
02:01:58,860 --> 02:02:05,060
Aim for the head, aim for the head.

2729
02:02:05,060 --> 02:02:07,700
We dropped you some shit, use it!

2730
02:02:07,700 --> 02:02:10,700
When you want.

2731
02:02:10,700 --> 02:02:16,260
Oh my God.

2732
02:02:16,820 --> 02:02:20,820
Let's see, uh, JD says, $2 sold and I don't even play shooters.

2733
02:02:20,820 --> 02:02:24,460
Kaijuto says, I'd pay five bucks for that.

2734
02:02:24,460 --> 02:02:26,820
Act F says, I'd buy the game for that.

2735
02:02:26,820 --> 02:02:29,620
Tiger Claw says, Rob's saying, that's gross.

2736
02:02:29,620 --> 02:02:34,220
Now that would be my mom, then she could be a whole nother pack of that.

2737
02:02:34,220 --> 02:02:43,460
Oh my God, that's gross, did you just, ah, did you, you threw the grenade, that is gross.

2738
02:02:43,660 --> 02:02:47,660
I should get my mother in it, doing the angry Spanish translation pack.

2739
02:02:47,660 --> 02:02:50,260
Oh, now that I'd buy, getting cursed at in Spanish?

2740
02:02:50,260 --> 02:02:51,260
Oh my God.

2741
02:02:51,260 --> 02:02:52,260
Mira!

2742
02:02:52,260 --> 02:02:53,260
Get the wussies!

2743
02:02:53,260 --> 02:02:56,260
Oh yeah, oh please.

2744
02:02:56,260 --> 02:02:59,460
I'm just thinking about what my mom would be like.

2745
02:02:59,460 --> 02:03:12,460
But if it's featuring the true Spanish household parent, then shouldn't the chancla be a weapon?

2746
02:03:12,460 --> 02:03:16,260
We've just alienated the entire listening crowd, but it does not matter because I know

2747
02:03:16,260 --> 02:03:18,060
what he meant.

2748
02:03:18,060 --> 02:03:21,060
I know how to fucking pay attention when my friends talk about the childhood.

2749
02:03:21,060 --> 02:03:25,260
I didn't know what that was until I moved out here too, but I guarantee you in the south,

2750
02:03:25,260 --> 02:03:28,460
the equivalent would be, pick your switch.

2751
02:03:28,460 --> 02:03:32,060
It'd be that belt coming off.

2752
02:03:32,060 --> 02:03:39,020
No, I didn't know about it until I saw Victoria beating her then boyfriend with the chancla,

2753
02:03:39,020 --> 02:03:41,580
and it was actually saying like, do you want to get the chancla?

2754
02:03:41,580 --> 02:03:42,580
Do you want to get it?

2755
02:03:42,580 --> 02:03:43,740
And I was like, the fuck?

2756
02:03:43,740 --> 02:03:45,780
And she explained to me the whole, the whole thing.

2757
02:03:45,780 --> 02:03:46,780
So.

2758
02:03:46,780 --> 02:03:47,780
Oh, that's great.

2759
02:03:47,780 --> 02:03:48,780
That's great.

2760
02:03:48,780 --> 02:03:53,900
The chancla as a DLC weapon, holy shit.

2761
02:03:53,900 --> 02:03:56,900
That's incredible.

2762
02:03:56,900 --> 02:03:57,900
All right.

2763
02:03:57,900 --> 02:04:02,900
And act deft, by the way, who is our listener in Mexico is just eating this shit up in chat

2764
02:04:02,900 --> 02:04:05,860
right now, by the way, just so you know.

2765
02:04:05,860 --> 02:04:06,980
What's up act deaf?

2766
02:04:06,980 --> 02:04:09,140
I almost, act deaf says fear the chancla.

2767
02:04:09,140 --> 02:04:13,780
I almost bought my friend a shirt, the same friend, like a shirt that actually had the,

2768
02:04:13,780 --> 02:04:17,020
and for those that don't know, it's, it's, we call it, this is where you usually hear

2769
02:04:17,020 --> 02:04:22,780
them called thongs because like the flip flop thongs, but when I hear thong, I think of

2770
02:04:22,780 --> 02:04:23,780
butt floss.

2771
02:04:23,780 --> 02:04:30,300
So, but the, the, um, you know, the, the flippy flop shoes, but if you didn't know, you could

2772
02:04:30,300 --> 02:04:33,220
actually beat somebody with those and it hurts a lot.

2773
02:04:33,220 --> 02:04:35,340
So this is wack.

2774
02:04:35,340 --> 02:04:36,340
So yeah, exactly.

2775
02:04:36,540 --> 02:04:40,340
It's the same thing, like getting hit with a belt too, except the belt flutter.

2776
02:04:40,340 --> 02:04:42,180
Just consensual, please.

2777
02:04:42,180 --> 02:04:43,180
If you're going to get into that.

2778
02:04:43,180 --> 02:04:44,180
All right.

2779
02:04:44,180 --> 02:04:47,060
Don't be a bad kid.

2780
02:04:47,060 --> 02:04:48,060
Anyhow.

2781
02:04:48,060 --> 02:04:49,060
Where were we?

2782
02:04:49,060 --> 02:04:50,060
Oh yes.

2783
02:04:50,060 --> 02:04:51,060
Method man for call of duty, infinite warfare.

2784
02:04:51,060 --> 02:04:52,060
Start tweeting.

2785
02:04:52,060 --> 02:04:55,500
Why can't we do our own voice packs for these games?

2786
02:04:55,500 --> 02:04:59,960
Why not in the, remember if you, if you were not aware of this, there is an OLR expansion

2787
02:04:59,960 --> 02:05:02,380
pack for typing of the dead on steam.

2788
02:05:02,380 --> 02:05:03,380
We're actually in the shop.

2789
02:05:03,380 --> 02:05:04,380
Yeah.

2790
02:05:04,380 --> 02:05:05,380
It was something we did for our 600th episode.

2791
02:05:05,420 --> 02:05:06,420
Yeah.

2792
02:05:06,420 --> 02:05:08,020
There's like an OLR DLC thing.

2793
02:05:08,020 --> 02:05:09,020
It's free.

2794
02:05:09,020 --> 02:05:13,020
Cause it's all through the workshop and so you can download and it's all like, like fucking

2795
02:05:13,020 --> 02:05:15,460
years old inside jokes from this show.

2796
02:05:15,460 --> 02:05:19,140
Like like Cylon, occupied Caprica and jokes that aren't even funny anymore.

2797
02:05:19,140 --> 02:05:25,260
Like that you can type in, uh, into the, as the, the, but so Iraqi suicide babies isn't

2798
02:05:25,260 --> 02:05:26,260
on there.

2799
02:05:26,260 --> 02:05:32,340
I think it is, which is again, before Tumblr reports us, it just goes back to the match

2800
02:05:32,340 --> 02:05:34,580
game from long, long, long, long, long time ago.

2801
02:05:34,580 --> 02:05:38,260
So anyway, super pale, better be one.

2802
02:05:38,260 --> 02:05:39,680
All right.

2803
02:05:39,680 --> 02:05:40,680
Can I do a game, Ron?

2804
02:05:40,680 --> 02:05:41,680
Yes.

2805
02:05:41,680 --> 02:05:46,620
Let's get to the classic game of the week before a method man was out of diapers.

2806
02:05:46,620 --> 02:05:47,620
Actually.

2807
02:05:47,620 --> 02:05:53,540
Uh, we, uh, we take a trip back to a classic time when a video games were a little bit

2808
02:05:53,540 --> 02:05:56,460
different and there was no voice expansion packs for games.

2809
02:05:56,460 --> 02:06:01,060
If you didn't like the voices in the game too bad, you could, you, you would do what

2810
02:06:01,060 --> 02:06:06,660
everybody on Twitch does now a day and just recite back the words that were on the screen

2811
02:06:06,660 --> 02:06:08,540
in your own voices.

2812
02:06:08,540 --> 02:06:12,500
That's what, that's what people on Twitch do when they played.

2813
02:06:12,500 --> 02:06:13,500
That's right.

2814
02:06:13,500 --> 02:06:14,500
Read without reading aloud.

2815
02:06:14,500 --> 02:06:15,500
All right.

2816
02:06:15,500 --> 02:06:16,500
Here it is.

2817
02:06:16,500 --> 02:06:17,700
The classic game of the week.

2818
02:06:17,700 --> 02:06:18,700
Dark soccer.

2819
02:06:18,700 --> 02:06:19,700
What'd you pick for us?

2820
02:06:19,700 --> 02:06:23,420
Well, with all this persona five coming out and everyone losing their shit about it, I

2821
02:06:23,420 --> 02:06:30,500
decided to give people a hint into what even led to persona and it was an RPG.

2822
02:06:30,500 --> 02:06:38,640
Back on the Super Famicom called Shin Megami Tensei If, which is in the Shin Megami, it's

2823
02:06:38,640 --> 02:06:45,780
in the Megami Tensei series, but this is the first RPG of its type in the series that led

2824
02:06:45,780 --> 02:06:47,860
to the persona series.

2825
02:06:47,860 --> 02:06:52,500
So this game came out in 1994 for the Super Famicom, which was over here at the Super

2826
02:06:52,500 --> 02:06:57,780
Nintendo and it is of course a spinoff of the Shin Megami Tensei series.

2827
02:06:57,780 --> 02:06:59,580
It's been ported to mobile devices.

2828
02:06:59,580 --> 02:07:04,220
There's a PlayStation port, there's a port on windows, and there is a digital version

2829
02:07:04,220 --> 02:07:06,020
for the virtual console.

2830
02:07:06,020 --> 02:07:12,900
Um, basically it follows a student at, uh, Karakazaka high school after their school

2831
02:07:12,900 --> 02:07:20,560
gets sucked into a realm of demons by a vengeful student's demon summoning spell gone wrong.

2832
02:07:20,560 --> 02:07:26,260
And so, um, it has a really, it focuses on like a smaller environment.

2833
02:07:26,260 --> 02:07:31,920
So within the school in its areas and it actually was really decently received and

2834
02:07:31,920 --> 02:07:39,260
of course it had print adaptations, it had a prequel to it, a mobile prequel, and the

2835
02:07:39,260 --> 02:07:45,700
high school setting basically is what led to the spinoff persona series.

2836
02:07:45,700 --> 02:07:48,620
So know your roots.

2837
02:07:48,620 --> 02:07:58,780
So basically you will, um, take the role of a protagonist, um, it's an unnamed male student

2838
02:07:58,780 --> 02:08:04,700
or you can play a female student named Tamaki Echida, um, that's, uh, in the later series.

2839
02:08:04,700 --> 02:08:11,320
Um, you basically have to explore the school while it's all demon infested and these different

2840
02:08:11,320 --> 02:08:14,120
towers that are based on the seven deadly sins.

2841
02:08:14,120 --> 02:08:21,020
And then, um, you have this little wrist mounted device called comp and you fight demons in

2842
02:08:21,020 --> 02:08:22,600
the turn based battle system.

2843
02:08:22,600 --> 02:08:26,380
You have physical and magical attacks, healing attacks, status ailment.

2844
02:08:26,380 --> 02:08:27,380
It's an RPG.

2845
02:08:27,380 --> 02:08:34,220
I mean, really, but, um, you can also recruit demons in it and bring them into your party.

2846
02:08:34,220 --> 02:08:42,360
You also can get other human companions, uh, and then when your player or your other human

2847
02:08:42,360 --> 02:08:47,620
dies, they get a guardian spirit who can revive them at the last day point and teach

2848
02:08:47,620 --> 02:08:49,740
them new skills and stuff like that.

2849
02:08:49,740 --> 02:08:55,300
So the game, I mean, and the big reason I'm bringing it up is because we now are on our

2850
02:08:55,300 --> 02:09:00,260
fifth installment of the persona series, all coming from Shin Megami Tensei, which I've

2851
02:09:00,260 --> 02:09:05,700
done, um, as a previous classic game, but this one here, I think that this one is the

2852
02:09:05,700 --> 02:09:06,960
one to pay attention to.

2853
02:09:06,960 --> 02:09:11,820
When it came out, it actually was said to have really dated graphics for its time.

2854
02:09:12,280 --> 02:09:13,360
I mean, this is 1994.

2855
02:09:13,360 --> 02:09:20,400
I thought it was okay, but it does kind of look like it's not the best quality wise,

2856
02:09:20,400 --> 02:09:28,040
but the game itself was, uh, so decently received and really opened the door to, um, to those

2857
02:09:28,040 --> 02:09:29,680
future games.

2858
02:09:29,680 --> 02:09:35,080
So, um, the other thing about it too is that it's working title is called Shin Megami Tensei

2859
02:09:35,080 --> 02:09:36,080
X.

2860
02:09:36,340 --> 02:09:42,080
Um, it was where they created that partner system where you could have, um, you know,

2861
02:09:42,080 --> 02:09:45,660
basically creating that with multiple different characters in it.

2862
02:09:45,660 --> 02:09:49,220
And then, um, they had a lot more that they wanted to do for it.

2863
02:09:49,220 --> 02:09:52,700
So of course, a lot of the stuff that was left on the cutting room floor made it into

2864
02:09:52,700 --> 02:09:54,220
future games.

2865
02:09:54,220 --> 02:09:58,940
Um, and some of the music in the game actually had lyrics written for it.

2866
02:09:58,940 --> 02:10:01,980
Um, but you don't hear the song in the game.

2867
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:05,240
You only hear, like, a line of it in the game.

2868
02:10:05,240 --> 02:10:12,800
Um, and then it really was supposed to bring in the theme of reincarnation as it's been,

2869
02:10:12,800 --> 02:10:15,840
it was supposed to be something that was part of the Shin Megami Tensei series, but didn't

2870
02:10:15,840 --> 02:10:22,600
have much representation, um, so that you could keep enjoying the game after you died

2871
02:10:22,600 --> 02:10:23,600
in battle.

2872
02:10:23,600 --> 02:10:26,160
And you also had lifeboats for people who die in battle.

2873
02:10:26,160 --> 02:10:27,160
It's kind of interesting.

2874
02:10:27,160 --> 02:10:31,200
The other thing that's cool is if you are a Japanese baseball fan, um, three of the

2875
02:10:31,220 --> 02:10:38,820
characters in the games were named after pitchers for the, um, uh, Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters.

2876
02:10:38,820 --> 02:10:44,460
Um, so, which is actually, like, one of the three baseball teams I know about over there.

2877
02:10:44,460 --> 02:10:49,060
There's like them, the Bay Stars, and the Yakult Swallows, which I think is also funny

2878
02:10:49,060 --> 02:10:52,300
that they're called the Swallows because you drink Yakult.

2879
02:10:52,300 --> 02:10:53,300
Go fig.

2880
02:10:53,300 --> 02:11:00,200
Anyway, um, there was, uh, one of the characters, Akira, his transformation was based off of

2881
02:11:00,200 --> 02:11:01,200
Devilman.

2882
02:11:01,200 --> 02:11:03,440
If anyone's ever seen that.

2883
02:11:03,440 --> 02:11:08,300
It was, um, by the guy who did Cutie Honey.

2884
02:11:08,300 --> 02:11:14,460
It was a dude who gets basically turned into a demon, so, um, Gonagai, that was his name.

2885
02:11:14,460 --> 02:11:20,860
Um, and you know, another character was, uh, based off of a character from Black Jack there.

2886
02:11:20,860 --> 02:11:27,700
You know, so there's lots of influences from just general anime and pop culture and sports

2887
02:11:27,700 --> 02:11:30,640
history all thrown into the game.

2888
02:11:30,640 --> 02:11:37,600
So, um, it came out on October 28th, 1994, and had a re-release on December 26th, 2002

2889
02:11:37,600 --> 02:11:38,600
for PlayStation.

2890
02:11:38,600 --> 02:11:45,320
Um, I almost liked the PlayStation version, but I wanted the SNES music, so.

2891
02:11:45,320 --> 02:11:50,360
The music they did for the PlayStation one is actually pretty good, so.

2892
02:11:50,360 --> 02:11:55,320
Um, there are, of course, like I said, there's ports on it, of it, for Virtual Console for

2893
02:11:55,320 --> 02:11:56,880
Wii and Wii U.

2894
02:11:56,880 --> 02:11:59,200
Um, I think Japan only, of course.

2895
02:11:59,200 --> 02:12:04,020
There was a Microsoft Windows for the iRevo PC in 2006, and then there's an Android and

2896
02:12:04,020 --> 02:12:06,580
iOS version that came out in 2013.

2897
02:12:06,580 --> 02:12:11,660
Um, and that is also the first mobile version of the game.

2898
02:12:11,660 --> 02:12:18,140
And then there came another game on April 22nd, 2004 called Shin Megami Tensei Ith Hazama's

2899
02:12:18,140 --> 02:12:19,140
Chapter.

2900
02:12:19,140 --> 02:12:26,200
Um, and that was for the FOMA 900i mobile phones, and it's a prologue to this game.

2901
02:12:26,200 --> 02:12:30,100
So it basically is whatever the character Hazama did right before the incident went

2902
02:12:30,100 --> 02:12:31,100
down.

2903
02:12:31,100 --> 02:12:35,780
And they offered a limited edition ROM cartridge- Oh, sorry.

2904
02:12:35,780 --> 02:12:39,740
They wanted to do a limited edition ROM cartridge of the game, but their budget did not let

2905
02:12:39,740 --> 02:12:40,980
it happen.

2906
02:12:40,980 --> 02:12:46,420
So basically after this, like I said, there were many, many other, um, iterations of the

2907
02:12:46,420 --> 02:12:47,420
story that came out.

2908
02:12:47,420 --> 02:12:53,260
There was the manga, which was, um, Shin Megami Tensei Ith School of the Demon Messenger.

2909
02:12:53,260 --> 02:12:58,960
Um, uh, there actually got translated into French.

2910
02:12:58,960 --> 02:13:03,200
Uh, there was another manga that was Shin Megami Tensei Kan.

2911
02:13:03,200 --> 02:13:08,240
And then there was, uh, Shin Megami Tensei Ith Gen of Makai.

2912
02:13:08,240 --> 02:13:16,680
Um, so basically a lot of, you know, the big thing is that the settings for the game, the,

2913
02:13:16,680 --> 02:13:21,320
the high school setting and some of the mechanics that were introduced in this game are what

2914
02:13:21,320 --> 02:13:24,160
led to Persona.

2915
02:13:24,160 --> 02:13:29,440
And so this right here is your Persona progenitor.

2916
02:13:29,440 --> 02:13:35,440
And if they hadn't branched out and made this spinoff, there'd probably be no Persona.

2917
02:13:35,440 --> 02:13:36,440
And that's your classic game.

2918
02:13:36,440 --> 02:13:37,440
All right.

2919
02:13:37,440 --> 02:13:41,220
I'm sure a lot of Persona fans though, probably, probably check this out in an emulator at

2920
02:13:41,220 --> 02:13:43,260
some point just to see, you know, what it's all about.

2921
02:13:43,260 --> 02:13:44,600
I will point this out.

2922
02:13:44,600 --> 02:13:51,080
Apparently accessories and outfits from this game have been featured in, uh, Shin Megami

2923
02:13:51,080 --> 02:13:56,600
Tensei Imagine, and it will be available as downloadable content for Shin Megami Tensei

2924
02:13:56,600 --> 02:13:57,600
Persona 5.

2925
02:13:57,600 --> 02:13:58,600
Nice.

2926
02:13:58,600 --> 02:13:59,600
So.

2927
02:13:59,600 --> 02:14:00,600
All right.

2928
02:14:00,600 --> 02:14:05,600
Shin Megami Tensei Ith, the classic game of the week, a little bit, a little bit thematic

2929
02:14:05,600 --> 02:14:06,600
there.

2930
02:14:06,600 --> 02:14:07,600
Uh, we're going to take a quick break though.

2931
02:14:07,600 --> 02:14:09,000
We got more Orange Lounge Radio to come.

2932
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:10,000
We're only halfway there.

2933
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:11,000
Are you ready?

2934
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:12,000
No, I'm just kidding.

2935
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:13,880
We're going to, we're going to speed up part B a little bit, I think, so we can get through

2936
02:14:13,880 --> 02:14:16,840
the show at a decent hour tonight, but we are going to get to your calls as well at

2937
02:14:16,840 --> 02:14:18,520
Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

2938
02:14:18,520 --> 02:14:20,920
You guys are gonna hang out a little longer with us here?

2939
02:14:20,920 --> 02:14:24,320
Gabrielle studio a little longer with us, we'll, we'll dish a little more about, uh,

2940
02:14:24,320 --> 02:14:27,280
the upcoming event and maybe what else is in store for IGG.

2941
02:14:27,280 --> 02:14:29,760
I want to, I want to pick your brain on what else we might have to look for.

2942
02:14:29,760 --> 02:14:32,960
I know you probably can't see much past next week right now, but if you want to throw us

2943
02:14:32,960 --> 02:14:36,280
anything, what, what else we have to look forward to, we'll talk about that when we

2944
02:14:36,280 --> 02:14:39,840
come back from a break, uh, here at Orange Lounge Radio.

2945
02:14:39,840 --> 02:14:40,840
Don't go anywhere.

2946
02:14:40,840 --> 02:14:47,840
We'll be right back.

2947
02:14:47,840 --> 02:14:53,640
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live tonight, episode number 682 of our show

2948
02:14:53,640 --> 02:14:57,280
for this April the 2nd of 2017.

2949
02:14:57,280 --> 02:15:01,400
Rob Robertson studio with you with Dark Sakura, not Loki tonight.

2950
02:15:01,400 --> 02:15:05,600
He's off for the night, but with us in studio, of course, Gabe and Bree from the Sacramento

2951
02:15:05,600 --> 02:15:09,960
chapter of the IGDA, that is International Game Developers Association.

2952
02:15:09,960 --> 02:15:10,960
Right?

2953
02:15:10,960 --> 02:15:11,960
Did I get it right?

2954
02:15:11,960 --> 02:15:12,960
Yes, sir.

2955
02:15:12,960 --> 02:15:13,960
All right.

2956
02:15:13,960 --> 02:15:16,840
And of course the indie arcade event is coming up this Saturday.

2957
02:15:16,840 --> 02:15:18,080
And when do doors open?

2958
02:15:18,080 --> 02:15:19,480
10 also as well.

2959
02:15:19,480 --> 02:15:20,480
Yes.

2960
02:15:20,480 --> 02:15:25,200
So this Saturday doors open at 10 o'clock, um, online ticket sales end Monday night at

2961
02:15:25,200 --> 02:15:26,200
midnight.

2962
02:15:26,200 --> 02:15:27,840
So save $5, get them online.

2963
02:15:27,840 --> 02:15:31,080
If you're a local here in Northern California, it's only $10 right now.

2964
02:15:31,080 --> 02:15:33,160
So JD get your ticket if you haven't already got it.

2965
02:15:33,160 --> 02:15:36,760
If you're a student listening, college, high school, whatever the case may be, it's only

2966
02:15:36,760 --> 02:15:39,720
$5 for you and kids under 12 are free.

2967
02:15:39,720 --> 02:15:41,960
Oh wow.

2968
02:15:41,960 --> 02:15:45,320
You're going to, I hope you don't get the, the Duggar family showing up with like, you

2969
02:15:45,320 --> 02:15:46,320
know, 20 kids.

2970
02:15:46,320 --> 02:15:49,880
Plus their grand babies.

2971
02:15:49,880 --> 02:15:51,360
I think they live, they live far, far away.

2972
02:15:51,360 --> 02:15:52,360
So you should be fine.

2973
02:15:52,360 --> 02:15:53,360
Yeah.

2974
02:15:53,360 --> 02:15:54,520
Video games are probably against their religion anyway.

2975
02:15:54,520 --> 02:15:56,080
So all right.

2976
02:15:56,080 --> 02:15:57,080
Yeah.

2977
02:15:57,080 --> 02:16:01,040
Um, so in addition to Sac Indie Arcade, you know, we've got developers coming from all

2978
02:16:01,040 --> 02:16:02,040
over the country.

2979
02:16:02,040 --> 02:16:05,160
We even have some people coming in from Puerto Rico, which is weird.

2980
02:16:05,160 --> 02:16:06,160
Yeah.

2981
02:16:06,160 --> 02:16:07,160
That's great.

2982
02:16:07,160 --> 02:16:08,160
Singapore.

2983
02:16:08,160 --> 02:16:12,440
Um, so it's going to be a great time, whether you're a casual gamer, hardcore gamer, young

2984
02:16:12,440 --> 02:16:14,520
gamer, old gamer, we've got something for everyone.

2985
02:16:14,520 --> 02:16:17,600
Of course, OLR is going to be in the house as well.

2986
02:16:17,600 --> 02:16:23,280
The most important thing, our VIPs, we got to make sure you guys are taken care of.

2987
02:16:23,280 --> 02:16:29,000
And um, one of our offshoots of IGDA Sacramento square one clubs is actually getting ready

2988
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:30,640
to open here in Sacramento.

2989
02:16:30,640 --> 02:16:36,220
They, they are a coworking space focused on growing the video game development industry

2990
02:16:36,220 --> 02:16:38,280
here in Sacramento.

2991
02:16:38,280 --> 02:16:42,780
And um, so they sponsored our progressive game jam for the 2016 2017 season.

2992
02:16:42,780 --> 02:16:44,820
We're going to have a special little section for them.

2993
02:16:44,820 --> 02:16:49,180
If anyone's familiar with the game jams, usually it's kind of like a hackathon that takes place

2994
02:16:49,180 --> 02:16:50,660
over a weekend.

2995
02:16:50,660 --> 02:16:54,300
Our game jam has taken place over the course of nine months, so you'll get a chance to

2996
02:16:54,300 --> 02:16:58,420
play demos of games developed in a nine month period.

2997
02:16:58,420 --> 02:17:00,620
Can you tell us a little more about like this?

2998
02:17:00,620 --> 02:17:04,260
Because this shared space thing seems to be this growing trend I see in the tech industry

2999
02:17:04,260 --> 02:17:08,340
because I notice, um, like, uh, when, when you guys invited me, which thanks again, by

3000
02:17:08,340 --> 02:17:13,500
the way, to, to host the T cubed event that with those guys, uh, we, we talked a little

3001
02:17:13,500 --> 02:17:14,500
bit about the success they've had.

3002
02:17:14,500 --> 02:17:18,260
And if you guys don't know the T cube thing, they're, they're not a video game per se.

3003
02:17:18,260 --> 02:17:20,220
They're more one of those like tangible games.

3004
02:17:20,220 --> 02:17:23,700
It's an actual cube that it's, it's, I get the easiest way I can say is tic tac toe on

3005
02:17:23,700 --> 02:17:27,020
a cube, but it's more, it's more complex than that, but you just, you've got to trust me

3006
02:17:27,020 --> 02:17:28,020
on it.

3007
02:17:28,020 --> 02:17:30,700
Um, come play it at any arcade cause I'm sure they're going to be there.

3008
02:17:30,700 --> 02:17:35,740
Um, but that was at that hacker lab, which is more of like a, like a, you know, kind

3009
02:17:35,740 --> 02:17:39,060
of like a computer development space, but they also have, they have like, cause I know,

3010
02:17:39,060 --> 02:17:42,920
um, the gentleman from T cube to talk about, he'd actually crafted some of those cubes

3011
02:17:42,920 --> 02:17:44,020
there at hacker labs.

3012
02:17:44,020 --> 02:17:47,220
They actually have industrial, like that type of technology and stuff too.

3013
02:17:47,220 --> 02:17:48,220
Right.

3014
02:17:48,220 --> 02:17:52,540
So, so this space, this square, square one, square one clubs, I can't help but think of

3015
02:17:52,540 --> 02:17:53,820
the TV show, which is awesome.

3016
02:17:53,820 --> 02:17:57,460
By the way, I don't know if you remember growing up square one.

3017
02:17:57,460 --> 02:17:58,460
Yeah.

3018
02:17:58,460 --> 02:17:59,460
Yeah.

3019
02:17:59,460 --> 02:18:00,460
Thank you.

3020
02:18:00,460 --> 02:18:01,460
Okay.

3021
02:18:01,460 --> 02:18:06,540
I didn't even have to think, Oh, that's, that's, square one needs to play in homeroom.

3022
02:18:06,540 --> 02:18:08,860
I know now, now you're not, okay, okay.

3023
02:18:08,860 --> 02:18:13,420
I'm going to work on that, but tell me a little more about what like a collaborative space

3024
02:18:13,420 --> 02:18:15,340
like means.

3025
02:18:15,340 --> 02:18:21,100
So collaborative spaces in general really invite the community, people from different

3026
02:18:21,100 --> 02:18:26,340
um, whatchamacallit, uh, disciplines to come and work together.

3027
02:18:26,340 --> 02:18:31,220
You can either work in an office or work in the general area and it's kind of like being

3028
02:18:31,220 --> 02:18:32,760
in a coffee shop, but not.

3029
02:18:32,760 --> 02:18:38,180
So your membership provides access to internet printers, you know, beverages that may be

3030
02:18:38,180 --> 02:18:39,180
in the area.

3031
02:18:39,180 --> 02:18:44,480
I think what's really going to define square one clubs as opposed to the other spaces in,

3032
02:18:44,480 --> 02:18:48,100
in Sacramento is that, um, we plan to have a studio.

3033
02:18:48,100 --> 02:18:52,180
So if there's anybody who would like to broadcast from there, there'll be able to come and use

3034
02:18:52,180 --> 02:18:53,180
that facility.

3035
02:18:53,180 --> 02:18:56,340
Um, it's going to be focused around video games.

3036
02:18:56,340 --> 02:18:58,380
Why don't you just roll out the orange carpet?

3037
02:18:58,380 --> 02:19:00,820
I think we're going to have to come on and crash your facility.

3038
02:19:00,820 --> 02:19:01,820
Yes.

3039
02:19:01,820 --> 02:19:05,900
We invite Twitch streamers, podcasters, um, anyone who wants to come and check that out,

3040
02:19:05,900 --> 02:19:09,900
voiceover talent who may want to record something for a call of duty.

3041
02:19:09,900 --> 02:19:10,900
Yes.

3042
02:19:10,900 --> 02:19:11,900
For that DLC.

3043
02:19:11,900 --> 02:19:12,900
Reach out to Marissa.

3044
02:19:12,900 --> 02:19:13,900
Yes.

3045
02:19:13,900 --> 02:19:14,900
Oh my gosh.

3046
02:19:14,900 --> 02:19:19,060
Marissa, our, our pal and just the legit stuff.

3047
02:19:19,060 --> 02:19:22,160
It's going to be a very unique space and of course we're going to welcome other types

3048
02:19:22,160 --> 02:19:28,060
of software developers and such, but um, the Sacramento game development community is finally

3049
02:19:28,060 --> 02:19:29,380
going to have a place to call home.

3050
02:19:29,380 --> 02:19:34,340
We've been bouncing around from coworking space to coworking space and we invite everybody

3051
02:19:34,340 --> 02:19:37,300
to come in once doors open and you guys will definitely be the first to know.

3052
02:19:37,300 --> 02:19:40,660
I want to, I totally, are you allowed to disclose where it is yet or is that still secret?

3053
02:19:40,660 --> 02:19:43,820
It's going to be located in East Sacramento.

3054
02:19:43,820 --> 02:19:45,380
Like what part?

3055
02:19:45,380 --> 02:19:46,380
I'm just curious.

3056
02:19:46,380 --> 02:19:47,380
I'm curious.

3057
02:19:47,380 --> 02:19:48,940
Like really close to your studio.

3058
02:19:48,940 --> 02:19:49,940
Really?

3059
02:19:49,940 --> 02:19:50,940
Really.

3060
02:19:50,940 --> 02:19:53,700
Is it, is it the space that save point was going to go into?

3061
02:19:53,700 --> 02:19:54,700
No.

3062
02:19:54,700 --> 02:19:55,700
Okay.

3063
02:19:55,700 --> 02:19:56,700
All right.

3064
02:19:57,340 --> 02:19:59,780
Cause I know that that was a contested space for a little bit.

3065
02:19:59,780 --> 02:20:00,780
So, okay.

3066
02:20:00,780 --> 02:20:01,780
All right.

3067
02:20:01,780 --> 02:20:02,780
Oh, I'm excited.

3068
02:20:02,780 --> 02:20:03,780
I'm excited.

3069
02:20:03,780 --> 02:20:04,780
Yay.

3070
02:20:04,780 --> 02:20:05,780
Okay.

3071
02:20:05,780 --> 02:20:08,060
Uh, but I just want to point out, Bree, I do love the name, but I'm going to play this

3072
02:20:08,060 --> 02:20:10,900
for you and now it ain't ever leaving your head.

3073
02:20:10,900 --> 02:20:11,900
Okay.

3074
02:20:11,900 --> 02:20:14,700
And this is whenever you walk through the doors of your shared space.

3075
02:20:14,700 --> 02:20:16,700
Oh man.

3076
02:20:27,700 --> 02:20:29,700
It's so nineties.

3077
02:20:29,700 --> 02:20:31,700
I know, right?

3078
02:20:31,700 --> 02:20:34,700
Oh, this was high school.

3079
02:20:34,700 --> 02:20:36,700
It was like, no, Bree, you don't understand.

3080
02:20:36,700 --> 02:20:41,700
It was like sketch comedy about math.

3081
02:20:41,700 --> 02:20:47,300
I don't, I don't think there is, I don't think there is a nerdier thing in existence than

3082
02:20:47,300 --> 02:20:48,340
square one television.

3083
02:20:48,340 --> 02:20:49,340
There really is not.

3084
02:20:49,340 --> 02:20:56,620
I mean, they, they had, it was, it was sketch comedy and it was all math jokes.

3085
02:20:56,620 --> 02:20:59,380
Which me being a number cruncher, I should appreciate something.

3086
02:20:59,380 --> 02:21:00,380
Yeah.

3087
02:21:00,380 --> 02:21:03,660
You need, I don't know if PBS like fucking sells this stuff on DVD to raise money.

3088
02:21:03,660 --> 02:21:08,220
Cause if you know, 45 tries to gut, they're going to, they're going to have to go, go

3089
02:21:08,220 --> 02:21:11,340
deep into the archives to figure out how to keep the blights on over there.

3090
02:21:11,340 --> 02:21:13,660
So you might be able to get square one on Blu-ray.

3091
02:21:13,660 --> 02:21:17,420
So I encourage you to get on that and catch up on math net because they did this whole

3092
02:21:17,420 --> 02:21:22,700
parody of that cop show drag net, but it was math net and they use math to solve crimes.

3093
02:21:22,700 --> 02:21:23,900
I shit you not.

3094
02:21:23,900 --> 02:21:26,860
It was like, no, I'm sad.

3095
02:21:26,860 --> 02:21:34,580
I fucking with you when I was 10 years old, that was like the highlight of my Friday was

3096
02:21:34,580 --> 02:21:38,100
that math net was going to come to a fucking conclusion that Friday.

3097
02:21:38,100 --> 02:21:42,700
And we would find out who fucking stole the baseball or whatever the crime was they were

3098
02:21:42,700 --> 02:21:50,660
trying to solve that night anyway, dark to see a points out.

3099
02:21:50,660 --> 02:21:58,180
Also math, man, the Pac-Man clone, but with math problems, I remember that.

3100
02:21:58,180 --> 02:22:00,060
Oh my heavens.

3101
02:22:00,060 --> 02:22:01,060
Okie dokie.

3102
02:22:01,060 --> 02:22:02,060
Okay.

3103
02:22:02,060 --> 02:22:03,060
Um, so let's see.

3104
02:22:03,060 --> 02:22:04,060
Oh gosh.

3105
02:22:04,060 --> 02:22:05,060
Anything else quickly?

3106
02:22:05,060 --> 02:22:07,380
I know, I know these spaces, this shared space is going to be awesome.

3107
02:22:07,380 --> 02:22:10,820
I'm so like just the networking is going to be amazing there.

3108
02:22:10,820 --> 02:22:15,260
Um, uh, we, we have to figure out like as some type of, I'm just going to like totally

3109
02:22:15,260 --> 02:22:16,260
invite ourselves.

3110
02:22:16,260 --> 02:22:17,260
Okay.

3111
02:22:17,260 --> 02:22:18,720
Ready as some type of like inaugural event.

3112
02:22:18,720 --> 02:22:25,760
I think us and the, the, the game bang and whoever, whoever else, it sounds like I'm

3113
02:22:25,760 --> 02:22:26,760
making fun.

3114
02:22:26,760 --> 02:22:27,760
I'm totally not.

3115
02:22:27,760 --> 02:22:28,760
I love those guys.

3116
02:22:28,760 --> 02:22:29,760
No, no, it's their name.

3117
02:22:29,760 --> 02:22:34,140
Their studio, their studio is fucking off the hook to like, I thought we were crazy

3118
02:22:34,140 --> 02:22:38,320
in our house, but like that guy, they, they, they did, they did some work.

3119
02:22:38,320 --> 02:22:40,480
Um, but what was I going to say?

3120
02:22:40,480 --> 02:22:44,960
Uh, um, and whoever, whatever other Sacramento podcast I'm not thinking of right now need

3121
02:22:44,960 --> 02:22:48,400
to all come do like a super show to like kick that place off.

3122
02:22:48,400 --> 02:22:49,600
I think that would be a fun thing to do.

3123
02:22:49,600 --> 02:22:50,600
That's a great idea.

3124
02:22:50,600 --> 02:22:55,320
Can I just give some props though to our Sacramento game mer community as a whole?

3125
02:22:55,320 --> 02:22:57,400
Because last week was huge.

3126
02:22:57,400 --> 02:23:01,120
Sac town magazine published two articles, one about square one, one about second year

3127
02:23:01,120 --> 02:23:06,760
arcade, um, energy, the e-sports team co-owned by one of the Sacramento Kings.

3128
02:23:06,760 --> 02:23:11,920
They had a halftime show with gamers playing games on the big screen and everything.

3129
02:23:11,920 --> 02:23:17,040
I mean collectively everyone getting together to make something happen, like we're getting

3130
02:23:17,040 --> 02:23:20,900
attention here to our area, to our neck of the woods, and I think everyone should be

3131
02:23:20,900 --> 02:23:21,900
so proud.

3132
02:23:21,900 --> 02:23:26,680
Yeah, no, I mean this is, I, and again, I feel like, like we've, we've kind of like

3133
02:23:26,680 --> 02:23:31,200
literally watched this grow from you guys being here two years ago promoting for what

3134
02:23:31,200 --> 02:23:35,240
was for us the first event, uh, into this now it's like, Oh my God, what's this going

3135
02:23:35,240 --> 02:23:36,240
to look like in 2020?

3136
02:23:36,240 --> 02:23:37,240
What's going on?

3137
02:23:37,240 --> 02:23:40,740
And of course, probably Bree is starting to get a heart increased heart rate thinking

3138
02:23:40,740 --> 02:23:46,800
about three years down the line, but all right, uh, let's see.

3139
02:23:46,800 --> 02:23:47,800
Yeah.

3140
02:23:47,800 --> 02:23:49,760
Brad from pop culture says you obviously haven't seen our studio.

3141
02:23:49,760 --> 02:23:51,400
No, I mean, I've seen, I've seen pictures.

3142
02:23:51,400 --> 02:23:53,680
Some of you, some of y'all are really dedicated to your craft.

3143
02:23:53,680 --> 02:23:54,680
Not that we aren't.

3144
02:23:54,680 --> 02:23:58,240
I'm just saying it's just like, I'm really impressed when I went over cause I did, I

3145
02:23:58,240 --> 02:23:59,240
did their show.

3146
02:23:59,240 --> 02:24:00,240
It was a while ago now.

3147
02:24:00,240 --> 02:24:01,240
It was probably about a good six months ago.

3148
02:24:01,240 --> 02:24:02,320
It was right around the time they were here.

3149
02:24:02,320 --> 02:24:04,600
I did their show and I remember walking in their room.

3150
02:24:04,600 --> 02:24:06,840
Have you, have you been over to their studio?

3151
02:24:06,840 --> 02:24:09,240
It's I'm like, wow, you went full conversion.

3152
02:24:09,240 --> 02:24:10,680
You, you committed here.

3153
02:24:10,680 --> 02:24:14,680
Like in our place, it's like, it's still kind of half a living room.

3154
02:24:14,680 --> 02:24:19,920
Like if I ever had a grandma over or something, I could like put draperies on things and things

3155
02:24:19,920 --> 02:24:20,920
would be hidden.

3156
02:24:20,920 --> 02:24:25,600
Like, so it wouldn't be so obvious that fucking nerds are here, but like that was, that was

3157
02:24:25,600 --> 02:24:28,240
full on commit like in their, in their space.

3158
02:24:28,240 --> 02:24:29,480
So props to them.

3159
02:24:29,480 --> 02:24:30,480
All right.

3160
02:24:30,480 --> 02:24:32,200
Anyhow, uh, we want to move on.

3161
02:24:32,200 --> 02:24:36,260
We got to get to, um, some release dates, talk about, uh, what's coming up in stores

3162
02:24:36,260 --> 02:24:39,480
this week and we're going to get to our mailbag as well.

3163
02:24:39,480 --> 02:24:41,940
So dark soccer, what's coming up in stores this week?

3164
02:24:41,940 --> 02:24:48,220
On the seventh, we have, um, in the U S we have, um, the Alchemist and the mysterious

3165
02:24:48,220 --> 02:24:56,060
journey on PC, PS4, PS Vita, logo worlds for windows, PS, you know, I'm looking at March,

3166
02:24:56,060 --> 02:24:57,060
Rob.

3167
02:24:57,060 --> 02:24:58,060
I'm sorry.

3168
02:24:58,060 --> 02:25:00,240
Oh, it's April.

3169
02:25:00,240 --> 02:25:01,240
That's okay.

3170
02:25:01,240 --> 02:25:04,340
And of course the one minute I look the other way to go look at something else.

3171
02:25:04,340 --> 02:25:05,340
Okay.

3172
02:25:05,340 --> 02:25:11,800
Um, on the fourth, drawn to death, prop of the rapper remastered persona five, Lego city

3173
02:25:11,800 --> 02:25:17,560
undercover on the fifth paradigm and the seven bullet storm full clip edition.

3174
02:25:17,560 --> 02:25:22,820
Ooh, Lego city undercover was spectacular.

3175
02:25:22,820 --> 02:25:25,160
So love that game on Wii U.

3176
02:25:25,160 --> 02:25:29,820
And now that I have to completely reevaluate all of my life choices, let me go back and

3177
02:25:29,820 --> 02:25:30,820
double check.

3178
02:25:30,820 --> 02:25:35,800
Um, the UK and on April 4th we have enter the Gungeon and on the seventh bullet storm

3179
02:25:35,800 --> 02:25:38,520
full clip edition.

3180
02:25:38,520 --> 02:25:40,760
You're just now getting entered to the Gungeon over in the UK.

3181
02:25:40,760 --> 02:25:41,760
That's a fun game.

3182
02:25:41,760 --> 02:25:42,760
So it's a rerelease.

3183
02:25:42,760 --> 02:25:44,440
Oh, it's like a remastered one.

3184
02:25:44,440 --> 02:25:50,000
They just cause, um, it was also on the American releases as I just said, sorry about that.

3185
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:51,000
I hear you.

3186
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:52,960
Well, let's go to Japan right now.

3187
02:25:52,960 --> 02:25:53,960
Get on a plane.

3188
02:25:53,960 --> 02:25:55,800
Um, BRB over in Japan.

3189
02:25:55,800 --> 02:25:56,800
Now this is interesting.

3190
02:25:56,800 --> 02:26:01,200
There's not a really a huge game release that I see any way on the PlayStation four this

3191
02:26:01,200 --> 02:26:02,200
week.

3192
02:26:02,200 --> 02:26:07,480
Um, but they are getting an actual kingdom hearts, 15th anniversary PlayStation four.

3193
02:26:07,480 --> 02:26:11,160
So like you can actually get the system and it's decked out and all the little symbols

3194
02:26:11,160 --> 02:26:14,280
doesn't like have a giant Sora or anything, but it's got all the little symbols and all

3195
02:26:14,280 --> 02:26:15,280
that stuff on it.

3196
02:26:15,280 --> 02:26:20,160
So, um, that's, uh, that's a really nice looking piece of technology.

3197
02:26:20,160 --> 02:26:22,720
Uh, Vita doesn't really have anything this week either.

3198
02:26:22,720 --> 02:26:24,640
I think it's kind of a slower week over in Japan.

3199
02:26:24,640 --> 02:26:29,960
We don't really, um, we have some type of a cover on the Nintendo switch, but I don't

3200
02:26:29,960 --> 02:26:31,980
really see a lot of game releases this week.

3201
02:26:31,980 --> 02:26:34,280
It seems to be just a slower week over in Japan.

3202
02:26:34,280 --> 02:26:39,800
Uh, there's one isolated release on the three DS, kawaii pet to cut us.

3203
02:26:39,800 --> 02:26:46,640
So one neon and mini, mini animal, which it's all, it's not just kitties.

3204
02:26:46,640 --> 02:26:48,640
I mean, there's definitely a neon in there.

3205
02:26:48,640 --> 02:26:49,640
I did it.

3206
02:26:49,640 --> 02:26:50,640
Well, there's definitely a neon right there.

3207
02:26:50,640 --> 02:26:51,640
Front and center.

3208
02:26:51,640 --> 02:26:53,400
It's something like cute animals, something.

3209
02:26:53,400 --> 02:26:54,400
It's cute.

3210
02:26:54,400 --> 02:26:55,600
Oh God, this is so fucking adorable.

3211
02:26:55,600 --> 02:26:56,600
I can't.

3212
02:26:56,600 --> 02:27:00,120
It's like Nintendog, cats, chinchilla.

3213
02:27:00,120 --> 02:27:05,100
That is a bunny, a chinchilla squirrel and an otter.

3214
02:27:05,100 --> 02:27:06,600
There's a hedgie up there.

3215
02:27:06,600 --> 02:27:09,860
So fucking cute.

3216
02:27:09,860 --> 02:27:13,640
So that clearly they cleared the release calendar for two weeks cause everybody's going to be

3217
02:27:13,640 --> 02:27:14,640
playing that.

3218
02:27:14,640 --> 02:27:15,640
All right.

3219
02:27:15,640 --> 02:27:16,640
So that's it for release dates.

3220
02:27:16,640 --> 02:27:17,840
How about the mailbag?

3221
02:27:17,840 --> 02:27:21,080
We're going to get to our mailbag and uh, just so you guys know, we did cut out rapid

3222
02:27:21,080 --> 02:27:22,080
fire news tonight.

3223
02:27:22,080 --> 02:27:26,480
We are trying to end at a decent hour tonight and our first half was a little more than

3224
02:27:26,480 --> 02:27:27,480
half.

3225
02:27:27,480 --> 02:27:29,880
So we are cutting a few corners here tonight just to make sure we wrap up the show in a

3226
02:27:29,880 --> 02:27:32,800
timely manner because some of us have to work tomorrow.

3227
02:27:32,800 --> 02:27:35,960
So we're going to get to the uh, mailbag this week.

3228
02:27:35,960 --> 02:27:41,840
Uh, you guys send us emails, participate at orange lounge radio.com is the place where

3229
02:27:41,840 --> 02:27:42,840
you can send us emails.

3230
02:27:42,840 --> 02:27:43,840
Holy balls.

3231
02:27:43,840 --> 02:27:45,240
Do we get a really long email?

3232
02:27:45,240 --> 02:27:46,240
Yeah.

3233
02:27:46,240 --> 02:27:47,240
No.

3234
02:27:47,240 --> 02:27:48,240
Is it just one though?

3235
02:27:48,240 --> 02:27:49,240
No, you have two others.

3236
02:27:49,240 --> 02:27:50,240
Okay.

3237
02:27:50,240 --> 02:27:52,560
Salutations from across the pond.

3238
02:27:52,560 --> 02:27:53,920
I might've read this last week.

3239
02:27:53,920 --> 02:27:54,920
Check the date.

3240
02:27:54,920 --> 02:27:55,920
Okay.

3241
02:27:55,920 --> 02:27:56,920
The 27th.

3242
02:27:56,920 --> 02:27:57,920
Is it James Nighthawks?

3243
02:27:57,920 --> 02:27:58,920
Yeah, it is.

3244
02:27:58,960 --> 02:27:59,960
Yeah.

3245
02:27:59,960 --> 02:28:00,960
I don't know how.

3246
02:28:00,960 --> 02:28:02,960
Did you also read AZHPs?

3247
02:28:02,960 --> 02:28:03,960
No.

3248
02:28:03,960 --> 02:28:04,960
Fine.

3249
02:28:04,960 --> 02:28:05,960
Okay.

3250
02:28:05,960 --> 02:28:08,960
Hey, oh, well, this one's long too.

3251
02:28:08,960 --> 02:28:09,960
Hey, O.L.R.

3252
02:28:09,960 --> 02:28:10,960
AZHP here.

3253
02:28:10,960 --> 02:28:13,880
I'm currently listening to last week's podcast.

3254
02:28:13,880 --> 02:28:16,600
We all, where you all talk about Mass Effect Andromeda.

3255
02:28:16,600 --> 02:28:17,600
Guess what?

3256
02:28:17,600 --> 02:28:18,780
We did it this week too.

3257
02:28:18,780 --> 02:28:22,560
And notice that Rob describes Andromeda as being a game that could have been a 10 out

3258
02:28:22,560 --> 02:28:27,520
of 10, whereas Zelda can is considered by that to be many, if not for the glaring technical

3259
02:28:27,520 --> 02:28:28,560
issues.

3260
02:28:28,560 --> 02:28:32,680
I feel that Andromeda is a good game that leans too heavily on previous Mass Effect

3261
02:28:32,680 --> 02:28:36,640
games for structure and set up to be a true 10 out of 10 masterpiece.

3262
02:28:36,640 --> 02:28:40,380
Rob's story about the transgender character blurting out, I'm transgender.

3263
02:28:40,380 --> 02:28:45,220
And Loki saying, I think they were just trying to check a box sums up my feeling about the

3264
02:28:45,220 --> 02:28:46,220
game.

3265
02:28:46,220 --> 02:28:50,380
It feels like a paint by numbers game across the board.

3266
02:28:50,380 --> 02:28:54,620
I'm only a few hours in, but the Pathfinder concept seems like they attempted to fast

3267
02:28:54,620 --> 02:28:57,640
forward the human specter concept from the first game.

3268
02:28:57,640 --> 02:29:01,680
It's immediately obvious who your future squad mates will be and what their loyalty missions

3269
02:29:01,680 --> 02:29:02,680
will be.

3270
02:29:02,680 --> 02:29:03,680
Not really.

3271
02:29:03,680 --> 02:29:04,680
One per colony ship.

3272
02:29:04,680 --> 02:29:09,280
And a lot of writers dialogue options make me feel like I made the wrong choice after

3273
02:29:09,280 --> 02:29:14,320
picking it because he sounds so snide and just reiterates I'm the Pathfinder.

3274
02:29:14,320 --> 02:29:18,540
And we got this instead of being a closer to a reflection of what I, the player, wanted

3275
02:29:18,540 --> 02:29:21,340
to choose as it was in the previous games with Shepard.

3276
02:29:21,340 --> 02:29:25,960
For the record, Lady Rider doesn't sound like that.

3277
02:29:25,960 --> 02:29:28,200
She sounds sincere.

3278
02:29:28,200 --> 02:29:32,540
I don't think that more time with the game would have made it a 10 out of 10.

3279
02:29:32,540 --> 02:29:36,960
It would have just made it the same 7 to 8 out of 10 game without animation bugs and

3280
02:29:36,960 --> 02:29:41,200
scripting errors, which at the very least are entertaining to see.

3281
02:29:41,200 --> 02:29:46,000
In a world where this was the first Mass Effect game, this game would have been an amazing

3282
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:47,680
achievement even 10 out of 10.

3283
02:29:47,680 --> 02:29:51,760
But coming off of the first three, and for me personally having loved those games, to

3284
02:29:51,760 --> 02:29:55,800
have this be the long awaited sequel just falls a little flat to me.

3285
02:29:55,800 --> 02:30:03,360
Finally, and sorry for the length of the email, now you say it, Rob noted that he hopes

3286
02:30:03,360 --> 02:30:06,680
that the poor reception to the unfinished nature of the game would not stop a sequel

3287
02:30:06,680 --> 02:30:07,680
to the game.

3288
02:30:07,680 --> 02:30:12,420
EA has noted in interviews that they think of Andromeda as a standalone game with no

3289
02:30:12,420 --> 02:30:13,920
planned sequel.

3290
02:30:13,920 --> 02:30:19,360
I can't find a direct source on this aside from Jeff Girtzman, who has been covering

3291
02:30:19,360 --> 02:30:23,080
video games for the last 21 years and who I consider a reliable source in the game's

3292
02:30:23,080 --> 02:30:24,080
press.

3293
02:30:24,080 --> 02:30:27,960
I just want to say to that real quick, I understand that PR put that out there, that doesn't mean

3294
02:30:27,960 --> 02:30:28,960
I believe it.

3295
02:30:28,960 --> 02:30:32,920
Like, I'm really going to believe that they're going to let the Mass Effect cache egg go.

3296
02:30:32,920 --> 02:30:33,920
Come on.

3297
02:30:33,920 --> 02:30:37,120
Mentioning that he heard this from a press contact.

3298
02:30:37,120 --> 02:30:41,060
This of course does not preclude the sequel from being greenlit, but my guess is that

3299
02:30:41,060 --> 02:30:45,240
not having plans to make this into another trilogy along with a tepid response from critics

3300
02:30:45,240 --> 02:30:48,360
and players would push them in the direction of not making one.

3301
02:30:48,360 --> 02:30:51,880
Sorry again for the long email, just wanted to add my voice to the show and see what you

3302
02:30:51,880 --> 02:30:52,880
all think.

3303
02:30:52,880 --> 02:30:54,000
Yours truly is HP.

3304
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:55,000
I'm curious.

3305
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:56,160
I welcome the opinion.

3306
02:30:56,160 --> 02:31:00,120
And honestly, what's interesting about it is AZHP sounds like he's in a place somewhat

3307
02:31:00,120 --> 02:31:02,080
similar to where I was at a week ago.

3308
02:31:02,080 --> 02:31:08,060
So I'm curious, how much time did AZHP spend with the game since writing that email and

3309
02:31:08,060 --> 02:31:10,040
have the opinions changed at all?

3310
02:31:10,040 --> 02:31:14,360
Because the more time I spend with the game, my impression does get more favorable, I think

3311
02:31:14,360 --> 02:31:16,640
is important to put out there.

3312
02:31:16,640 --> 02:31:18,560
Not that that's going to be the same for everybody.

3313
02:31:18,560 --> 02:31:21,240
And certainly, you know, it's the show where every gamer has a voice and there are going

3314
02:31:21,240 --> 02:31:24,700
to be some people that feel that Mass Effect gets no stronger than a seven or eight.

3315
02:31:24,700 --> 02:31:26,320
And that's that's fine.

3316
02:31:26,320 --> 02:31:30,160
You know, and even even if I was saying last week, and this is probably still the case,

3317
02:31:30,160 --> 02:31:33,560
although I think at the end of the day, I'm going to enjoy Andromeda and I probably would

3318
02:31:33,560 --> 02:31:36,880
say Mass Effect Andromeda is probably going to be better than one.

3319
02:31:36,880 --> 02:31:37,880
Not sure.

3320
02:31:37,880 --> 02:31:40,960
I mean, again, I have to beat it to really know, but I'm not sure it's going to outpace

3321
02:31:40,960 --> 02:31:41,960
two or three.

3322
02:31:41,960 --> 02:31:44,680
I still think when all is said and done, two and three are going to be better games for

3323
02:31:44,680 --> 02:31:45,680
me.

3324
02:31:45,680 --> 02:31:50,760
But like, I don't have the flaming hate boner that Twitter seems to have for this game in

3325
02:31:50,760 --> 02:31:51,880
some regards.

3326
02:31:51,880 --> 02:31:56,080
That's the only thing that's like concerning me a little bit is that there's a lot of hater

3327
02:31:56,080 --> 02:31:57,080
aid out.

3328
02:31:57,080 --> 02:31:59,240
My biggest hate was the character creation.

3329
02:31:59,240 --> 02:32:00,240
I mean, really.

3330
02:32:00,240 --> 02:32:05,880
But like, I even sent like a positive tweet to BioWare saying that I really loved the

3331
02:32:05,880 --> 02:32:12,120
rendering of fabric textures in the game, because with my new graphics card, I can see

3332
02:32:12,120 --> 02:32:15,160
the leather looks like fucking leather.

3333
02:32:15,160 --> 02:32:18,880
The vinyl looks like vinyl canvas looks like canvas.

3334
02:32:18,880 --> 02:32:22,660
And to me, a lot of times you can find a rendered game.

3335
02:32:22,660 --> 02:32:26,320
It takes a lot of work to render texture that well.

3336
02:32:26,320 --> 02:32:28,000
And so I was super impressed with that.

3337
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:29,720
I mean, graphically, it's an amazing game.

3338
02:32:29,720 --> 02:32:32,600
I do want to make sure we point out at some point, too, because I don't think it's come

3339
02:32:32,600 --> 02:32:33,680
up on the show yet.

3340
02:32:33,680 --> 02:32:37,580
But BioWare has said they're going to be releasing some details.

3341
02:32:37,580 --> 02:32:39,320
I think it was April 4th.

3342
02:32:39,320 --> 02:32:41,040
So like Tuesday, I think it was.

3343
02:32:41,040 --> 02:32:45,040
They're going to be releasing additional details about what the future of Andromeda will look

3344
02:32:45,040 --> 02:32:46,040
like.

3345
02:32:46,040 --> 02:32:50,520
A big part of it is addressing some of the concerns that have come out on Twitter.

3346
02:32:50,520 --> 02:32:53,440
So like how the Turians are going to eat.

3347
02:32:53,440 --> 02:32:54,440
I don't.

3348
02:32:54,440 --> 02:32:55,440
We don't know.

3349
02:32:55,440 --> 02:32:56,720
Like, we don't know what they're going to address.

3350
02:32:56,720 --> 02:32:59,280
Could it be a DLC announcement?

3351
02:32:59,280 --> 02:33:00,560
Could it be a free patch announcement?

3352
02:33:00,560 --> 02:33:05,040
Are they going to do something like they did with the extended cut for three?

3353
02:33:05,040 --> 02:33:06,040
I don't know.

3354
02:33:06,040 --> 02:33:12,080
So so we won't know till the next show to put out a deluxe upgrade for those of us who

3355
02:33:12,080 --> 02:33:14,120
are strong armed into buying the regular version.

3356
02:33:14,120 --> 02:33:15,120
OK.

3357
02:33:15,200 --> 02:33:16,200
That would be nice.

3358
02:33:16,200 --> 02:33:17,520
So the last email.

3359
02:33:17,520 --> 02:33:20,120
It's called Shane.

3360
02:33:20,120 --> 02:33:21,480
Hello, O.L.R.

3361
02:33:21,480 --> 02:33:26,120
Given recent gaming and movie releases, I feel like we're missing someone's input.

3362
02:33:26,120 --> 02:33:29,360
Any chance Shane will chime in on the show tonight with his thoughts on Andromeda Power

3363
02:33:29,360 --> 02:33:34,440
Rangers or the switch in Breath of the Wild and answer no unless he calls.

3364
02:33:34,440 --> 02:33:38,600
I know this seems a bit of an odd request, but I miss the sassy molassie.

3365
02:33:38,600 --> 02:33:40,920
Sincerely, Ospher.

3366
02:33:40,920 --> 02:33:43,480
Shane, call.

3367
02:33:43,480 --> 02:33:44,480
Please.

3368
02:33:45,680 --> 02:33:46,920
And that's it.

3369
02:33:48,080 --> 02:33:49,720
Dun dun dun.

3370
02:33:52,760 --> 02:33:57,440
Phil Time, Phil Tech, I'm actually texting Shane right now, but I believe they are taping

3371
02:33:57,440 --> 02:33:58,600
Ranger pride right now.

3372
02:33:58,600 --> 02:33:59,600
Well, what's he doing that for?

3373
02:33:59,600 --> 02:34:00,720
Well, here's some stuff.

3374
02:34:00,720 --> 02:34:07,280
Speaking of Zelda, there are apparently going to be a patch for Breath of the Wild.

3375
02:34:07,280 --> 02:34:10,600
Just a little update, but it's supposed to just make it more pleasant.

3376
02:34:10,600 --> 02:34:12,400
Like, what the fuck does that mean?

3377
02:34:12,600 --> 02:34:14,880
Not really anything perceptible.

3378
02:34:14,880 --> 02:34:20,560
And of course, the prop of the rapper soundtrack got released in Japan.

3379
02:34:20,560 --> 02:34:24,480
If some people who are in Japan right now, oh, wait, they're not in Japan anymore.

3380
02:34:24,480 --> 02:34:25,480
Never mind.

3381
02:34:26,680 --> 02:34:30,480
Yes, Spike, Spike is left and Christy is now on her way over here, so.

3382
02:34:30,480 --> 02:34:33,200
She's already over here.

3383
02:34:33,200 --> 02:34:35,520
So I was checking with Shane.

3384
02:34:35,520 --> 02:34:44,160
Well, I could go ahead and also speak of another thing.

3385
02:34:44,160 --> 02:34:49,800
That there's going to be free DLC for Super Bomberman R and that M2 is handling the Seiken

3386
02:34:49,800 --> 02:34:54,840
Densetsu port, so that's also good too, right?

3387
02:34:54,840 --> 02:35:00,080
Yeah, actually, that is great because those other ports they did were good.

3388
02:35:00,080 --> 02:35:06,640
I still want to know if they're going to re-translate Seiken Densetsu 3.

3389
02:35:06,640 --> 02:35:08,520
Did you hear about this, by the way, Jamie?

3390
02:35:08,520 --> 02:35:10,720
Seiken Densetsu collection on the Switch.

3391
02:35:10,720 --> 02:35:14,880
So it's one, two, and three, but it's only confirmed for Japan right now.

3392
02:35:14,880 --> 02:35:17,680
Well, it'd be nice if we got it over here.

3393
02:35:17,680 --> 02:35:20,160
I really like Seiken 3.

3394
02:35:20,160 --> 02:35:22,560
Of course, I also like Secret of Mana.

3395
02:35:22,560 --> 02:35:25,040
The later games were not so much.

3396
02:35:25,040 --> 02:35:30,480
Well, if you would like, I can also move on to one other story.

3397
02:35:30,480 --> 02:35:33,960
Yes, and just so you know, Shane is signing on Skype right now.

3398
02:35:33,960 --> 02:35:35,760
I guess they're done with Ranger Pride.

3399
02:35:35,760 --> 02:35:40,120
Just so you know, Captain Spike was in Japan, so they have not got to talk about the Power

3400
02:35:40,120 --> 02:35:44,280
Rangers movie yet, which is kind of a big fucking deal, the fact that there's a Power

3401
02:35:44,280 --> 02:35:45,280
Ranger.

3402
02:35:45,280 --> 02:35:46,280
Did you see the Power Rangers movie yet?

3403
02:35:46,280 --> 02:35:47,280
I want to.

3404
02:35:47,280 --> 02:35:48,280
It's not bad.

3405
02:35:48,280 --> 02:35:49,280
It's not bad.

3406
02:35:49,280 --> 02:35:50,280
Okay.

3407
02:35:50,280 --> 02:35:51,800
I'm starting to agree more with the people that are saying it should have just been a

3408
02:35:51,800 --> 02:35:53,360
CW TV show.

3409
02:35:53,960 --> 02:35:59,120
No, like for real, some of the CW TV shows are actually like, I really want to check

3410
02:35:59,120 --> 02:36:00,120
out Riverdale.

3411
02:36:00,120 --> 02:36:08,600
CW gave us Supernatural, which I stopped watching in season nine, and they're on season 11.

3412
02:36:08,600 --> 02:36:10,280
My God.

3413
02:36:10,280 --> 02:36:13,680
Can you make sure you have that email up from the person that was questioning?

3414
02:36:13,680 --> 02:36:14,680
I closed the email already.

3415
02:36:14,680 --> 02:36:16,320
Can you bring it back up real quick?

3416
02:36:16,320 --> 02:36:17,320
Sure.

3417
02:36:17,320 --> 02:36:18,320
Please?

3418
02:36:18,320 --> 02:36:23,120
Okay, because I'm going to get Shane on the line here on the show.

3419
02:36:23,880 --> 02:36:26,880
If I could.

3420
02:36:26,880 --> 02:36:28,560
All live radio, but you know what?

3421
02:36:28,560 --> 02:36:29,560
You won it.

3422
02:36:29,560 --> 02:36:30,560
You got it.

3423
02:36:30,560 --> 02:36:31,960
We're willing to give you what you need.

3424
02:36:31,960 --> 02:36:32,960
Hi, Shane.

3425
02:36:32,960 --> 02:36:33,960
You there?

3426
02:36:33,960 --> 02:36:34,960
Yeah.

3427
02:36:34,960 --> 02:36:35,960
How you doing?

3428
02:36:35,960 --> 02:36:36,960
Fine.

3429
02:36:36,960 --> 02:36:37,960
I'm just laying in bed.

3430
02:36:37,960 --> 02:36:39,960
Oh, I'm sorry to wake you.

3431
02:36:39,960 --> 02:36:41,080
I wasn't asleep.

3432
02:36:41,080 --> 02:36:45,920
I was typing up my thoughts on Mass Effect.

3433
02:36:45,920 --> 02:36:48,360
I bet you have a lot of thoughts on Mass Effect, actually.

3434
02:36:48,360 --> 02:36:50,680
Are you going to do an article for VOG?

3435
02:36:50,680 --> 02:36:53,000
You asked me or told me I should.

3436
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:54,000
I don't know.

3437
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:57,000
I'm just typing random things about it right now.

3438
02:36:57,000 --> 02:36:58,000
It's no pressure.

3439
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:01,480
Okay, so we have an email this week in our mailbag, Shane, that you needed to hear.

3440
02:37:01,480 --> 02:37:02,920
So is Jamie ready to go with that?

3441
02:37:02,920 --> 02:37:03,920
Real quick.

3442
02:37:03,920 --> 02:37:04,920
Okay, here we go.

3443
02:37:04,920 --> 02:37:07,760
Given recent gaming and movie releases, I feel that we are missing someone's input.

3444
02:37:07,760 --> 02:37:11,040
Any chance Shane will chime in on the show tonight with his thoughts on Andromeda Power

3445
02:37:11,040 --> 02:37:13,000
Rangers or the Switch in Breath of Wild?

3446
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:17,120
I know this seems a bit of an odd request, but I miss the sassy molassie, and that comes

3447
02:37:17,120 --> 02:37:18,120
from Ospher.

3448
02:37:18,120 --> 02:37:19,120
All right.

3449
02:37:19,120 --> 02:37:24,160
This is not sassy or molasses or whatever that was.

3450
02:37:24,160 --> 02:37:25,160
Maybe a little molasses.

3451
02:37:25,160 --> 02:37:26,160
Maybe a little bit.

3452
02:37:26,160 --> 02:37:27,160
All right.

3453
02:37:27,160 --> 02:37:30,960
So we actually are having a request for your take on this.

3454
02:37:30,960 --> 02:37:34,440
Now let me start with Power Rangers, because I'm sure you're going to talk about this on

3455
02:37:34,440 --> 02:37:35,440
Ranger Pride.

3456
02:37:35,440 --> 02:37:40,260
So I don't want to ruin this discussion too much, but give us the quick high-level take

3457
02:37:40,260 --> 02:37:42,080
on Power Rangers.

3458
02:37:42,080 --> 02:37:43,080
Hold on.

3459
02:37:43,080 --> 02:37:46,280
You have to keep stalling for time, because I'm switching to my headphones.

3460
02:37:46,280 --> 02:37:47,600
Oh, okay.

3461
02:37:47,600 --> 02:37:48,600
Well, I...

3462
02:37:48,600 --> 02:37:54,400
Rob, let's go to the movie theaters that have the cushy seats.

3463
02:37:54,400 --> 02:37:55,720
Actually Shane took me to those theaters.

3464
02:37:55,720 --> 02:37:56,720
They're really nice.

3465
02:37:56,720 --> 02:37:59,320
Well, I need to go and have someone watch that movie with me, because Dancer's Fuck

3466
02:37:59,320 --> 02:38:00,320
will go.

3467
02:38:00,320 --> 02:38:01,320
I will take you to see...

3468
02:38:01,320 --> 02:38:02,320
God, am I really going to see that again?

3469
02:38:02,320 --> 02:38:03,320
I want to go see...

3470
02:38:03,320 --> 02:38:04,320
Have Shane take you.

3471
02:38:04,320 --> 02:38:05,320
He'll go for the seventh time.

3472
02:38:05,320 --> 02:38:06,920
Shane, will you go see Power Rangers with me?

3473
02:38:06,920 --> 02:38:07,920
For a fifth time?

3474
02:38:07,920 --> 02:38:08,920
Of course I would.

3475
02:38:08,920 --> 02:38:09,920
Awesome.

3476
02:38:09,920 --> 02:38:12,240
And then you can take me to see Beauty and the Beast, because nobody will go with me

3477
02:38:12,240 --> 02:38:13,240
to see Beauty and the Beast.

3478
02:38:13,240 --> 02:38:14,240
Oh, I will go with you.

3479
02:38:14,240 --> 02:38:15,240
Thank you.

3480
02:38:15,240 --> 02:38:16,240
But I also need someone to go to see Logan with me.

3481
02:38:16,240 --> 02:38:17,240
I'm sorry.

3482
02:38:17,880 --> 02:38:18,880
Will you go see Beauty and the Beast, a date movie, Dark Sakura?

3483
02:38:18,880 --> 02:38:22,120
Well, it's not like we haven't had friend dates before.

3484
02:38:22,120 --> 02:38:23,120
Thank you.

3485
02:38:23,120 --> 02:38:25,720
Because Shane wouldn't go, because he said it's something I had to take Alan to.

3486
02:38:25,720 --> 02:38:27,480
That is exactly what I said.

3487
02:38:27,480 --> 02:38:28,480
That is correct.

3488
02:38:28,480 --> 02:38:30,440
I will be your platonic date.

3489
02:38:30,440 --> 02:38:31,440
Thank you.

3490
02:38:31,440 --> 02:38:35,520
See, you can recognize that you can just be friends and go, and it's fine.

3491
02:38:35,520 --> 02:38:36,520
Anyway.

3492
02:38:36,520 --> 02:38:39,760
So, Shane, Power Rangers, what's your quick take?

3493
02:38:39,760 --> 02:38:40,760
And then we'll make people listen to you.

3494
02:38:40,760 --> 02:38:43,640
Well, I've seen it four times already, and I just made plans to see it at fifth.

3495
02:38:43,640 --> 02:38:47,440
I don't really know if much else needs to be said.

3496
02:38:47,440 --> 02:38:50,400
All right, fair enough.

3497
02:38:50,400 --> 02:38:52,360
So stay tuned to Ranger Pride for the rest.

3498
02:38:52,360 --> 02:38:53,360
Okay.

3499
02:38:53,360 --> 02:38:55,800
Switch and Breath of the Wild.

3500
02:38:55,800 --> 02:38:57,400
I love my Switch.

3501
02:38:57,400 --> 02:39:02,680
Breath of the Wild is probably my favorite Zelda game, since I already beat it.

3502
02:39:02,680 --> 02:39:04,880
I didn't get everything in it.

3503
02:39:04,880 --> 02:39:07,560
But it's a really good game.

3504
02:39:07,560 --> 02:39:11,400
But the more I reflect on it, even though I still say it's my favorite Zelda game, the

3505
02:39:11,400 --> 02:39:18,080
more I realize that it feels like there's two hours of content in the entire game, and

3506
02:39:18,080 --> 02:39:19,080
that's really it.

3507
02:39:19,080 --> 02:39:22,080
But I played it for 60.

3508
02:39:22,080 --> 02:39:23,080
Interesting you put it that way.

3509
02:39:23,080 --> 02:39:29,080
Is that just because a big chunk of the game is just finding stuff and exploring, but the

3510
02:39:29,080 --> 02:39:31,720
game might lend itself really well to speedrunning?

3511
02:39:31,720 --> 02:39:33,280
Well, I think it does.

3512
02:39:33,280 --> 02:39:36,600
I think people are under an hour and beating it now.

3513
02:39:36,600 --> 02:39:39,480
And I think it's because it's all open world now.

3514
02:39:39,480 --> 02:39:43,920
You have kind of less of a path that you have to take.

3515
02:39:43,920 --> 02:39:50,440
And the stuff in between story points can be as long or as short as you really want

3516
02:39:50,440 --> 02:39:51,480
it to be.

3517
02:39:51,480 --> 02:39:54,680
For the record, the speedrun world record is at 45 minutes.

3518
02:39:54,680 --> 02:39:55,680
Yeah.

3519
02:39:55,680 --> 02:39:56,680
Naked.

3520
02:39:56,680 --> 02:39:57,680
So...

3521
02:39:57,680 --> 02:39:58,680
What?

3522
02:39:58,680 --> 02:39:59,680
Naked?

3523
02:39:59,680 --> 02:40:00,680
Like the speedrunner was naked?

3524
02:40:00,680 --> 02:40:01,680
The character.

3525
02:40:01,680 --> 02:40:03,680
He's running around in his shorts.

3526
02:40:03,680 --> 02:40:06,200
And yeah, because you really wouldn't be collecting any items, really.

3527
02:40:06,200 --> 02:40:07,200
I would think.

3528
02:40:07,200 --> 02:40:08,200
Yeah.

3529
02:40:08,240 --> 02:40:13,120
You get all of the first few shrines and then you can run on right to the castle.

3530
02:40:13,120 --> 02:40:16,760
I was like, what kind of speedrunning marathons are they doing these days?

3531
02:40:16,760 --> 02:40:17,760
Alright.

3532
02:40:17,760 --> 02:40:20,160
So, but you like the Switch overall system too?

3533
02:40:20,160 --> 02:40:22,160
Oh yeah, the Switch is fantastic.

3534
02:40:22,160 --> 02:40:24,920
I am so glad I have one.

3535
02:40:24,920 --> 02:40:31,320
And I think it's Nintendo's right step in the right direction for the first time in

3536
02:40:31,320 --> 02:40:32,320
a long time.

3537
02:40:32,320 --> 02:40:33,320
In terms of the consoles.

3538
02:40:33,320 --> 02:40:36,040
Can you try to give us the why?

3539
02:40:36,040 --> 02:40:37,680
Why?

3540
02:40:37,680 --> 02:40:41,200
Because it plays to both of their fanbases.

3541
02:40:41,200 --> 02:40:46,800
I'm more of a handheld person, so I can lay in bed and play my console game just laying

3542
02:40:46,800 --> 02:40:47,800
down in bed.

3543
02:40:47,800 --> 02:40:48,880
Or I can take it with me.

3544
02:40:48,880 --> 02:40:53,320
Whereas other people I know still only really use it as a TV device.

3545
02:40:53,320 --> 02:40:55,240
And so we get to do both things.

3546
02:40:55,240 --> 02:41:00,220
And now, for me, what's really cool, and I tried this out when they were doing it during

3547
02:41:00,220 --> 02:41:06,840
the test fire, is that you can, you know, for Splatoon 2.

3548
02:41:06,840 --> 02:41:13,880
I have the capability of making my phone a personal hotspot so I can make that a wireless

3549
02:41:13,880 --> 02:41:18,400
go-to for my Switch if I was on the go and play Splatoon online with people.

3550
02:41:18,400 --> 02:41:20,120
Yeah, that's gonna be awesome.

3551
02:41:20,120 --> 02:41:23,340
I'm looking forward to the, I know you don't do this stuff as much, but the convention

3552
02:41:23,340 --> 02:41:27,000
type stuff where there's gonna be like several people all with their Switches and we can

3553
02:41:27,000 --> 02:41:31,000
all kind of play a game of like Mario Kart or Splatoon or something.

3554
02:41:31,000 --> 02:41:32,000
Yeah.

3555
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:33,760
Or Fast RMX, which is really good.

3556
02:41:33,760 --> 02:41:35,380
Or Bomberman, which is really good.

3557
02:41:35,380 --> 02:41:39,020
I heard they patched that, so I gotta try that again post-patch now.

3558
02:41:39,020 --> 02:41:40,820
And there's free DLC coming out.

3559
02:41:40,820 --> 02:41:42,140
Yeah, I heard about that.

3560
02:41:42,140 --> 02:41:47,460
I don't know, like somebody must have taken over Konami or something because Konami's

3561
02:41:47,460 --> 02:41:50,140
doing some weird stuff.

3562
02:41:50,140 --> 02:41:53,580
It's almost like they're on the shade button.

3563
02:41:53,580 --> 02:41:56,780
I accidentally closed that tab, all right, that was all right.

3564
02:41:56,780 --> 02:41:59,900
Okay, so now, all right, everybody get your chairs and your air mattresses.

3565
02:41:59,900 --> 02:42:00,900
Here we go.

3566
02:42:00,900 --> 02:42:03,180
Mass Effect Andromeda.

3567
02:42:03,180 --> 02:42:04,500
Is amazing.

3568
02:42:04,500 --> 02:42:10,020
And if I can be, you know, just a little bit critical for a second, like all the critics

3569
02:42:10,020 --> 02:42:14,860
that gave it low scores need to go fuck themselves because it's so good.

3570
02:42:14,860 --> 02:42:17,180
Okay, hold on, hold on.

3571
02:42:17,180 --> 02:42:18,180
I want you guys to...

3572
02:42:18,180 --> 02:42:20,380
You really shouldn't have shut that shade button down.

3573
02:42:20,380 --> 02:42:21,580
No, hold on, hold on, hold on.

3574
02:42:21,580 --> 02:42:23,660
You guys need to understand something.

3575
02:42:23,660 --> 02:42:25,500
Shane doesn't swear, like ever.

3576
02:42:25,500 --> 02:42:29,580
Unless I'm playing Overwatch or Splatoon or games.

3577
02:42:29,580 --> 02:42:30,580
Curse it, Splatoon.

3578
02:42:30,580 --> 02:42:31,580
No, here's the thing.

3579
02:42:31,580 --> 02:42:33,820
Like I'll be like, Shane, it's my birthday.

3580
02:42:33,820 --> 02:42:35,260
Just give me a good hearty fuck you.

3581
02:42:35,260 --> 02:42:36,900
And he'll be like, no, I don't swear.

3582
02:42:36,900 --> 02:42:37,900
I don't do that.

3583
02:42:37,900 --> 02:42:41,740
Do you see that Shane just very casually dropped the F bomb there.

3584
02:42:41,740 --> 02:42:42,740
So he made it.

3585
02:42:42,740 --> 02:42:45,540
And now I have it on tape.

3586
02:42:45,540 --> 02:42:46,540
That's the best part of this.

3587
02:42:46,540 --> 02:42:47,540
That's what you can use.

3588
02:42:47,540 --> 02:42:51,140
You can use that for the voice pack for Call of Duty.

3589
02:42:51,140 --> 02:42:53,860
Yes, exactly, exactly.

3590
02:42:53,860 --> 02:42:54,860
So okay.

3591
02:42:54,860 --> 02:42:55,860
Wow.

3592
02:42:55,860 --> 02:42:59,580
So I just want to say when Shane tells somebody to go fuck themselves, he means it.

3593
02:42:59,580 --> 02:43:02,900
So you are not happy with the critics here.

3594
02:43:03,540 --> 02:43:06,480
I don't understand like at all.

3595
02:43:06,480 --> 02:43:13,140
It feels like now that I'm done with the game for now, it feels like Mass Effect 1 where

3596
02:43:13,140 --> 02:43:18,540
the game starts off slow, but you know, most Bioware starting stories do.

3597
02:43:18,540 --> 02:43:21,500
And then it ramps up incredibly.

3598
02:43:21,500 --> 02:43:26,220
And by the end, like every 10 minutes, my mind was being blown left and right.

3599
02:43:26,220 --> 02:43:27,700
I was like, oh my God, this is so good.

3600
02:43:27,700 --> 02:43:29,140
I don't want it to end.

3601
02:43:29,140 --> 02:43:36,820
And I legit got sad when it was over as like, I need DLC now I need my plans for I need

3602
02:43:36,820 --> 02:43:39,820
to hear about the plans for Andromeda 2.

3603
02:43:39,820 --> 02:43:41,300
Like I can't do this.

3604
02:43:41,300 --> 02:43:45,420
I just spent 75 hours on this game because that's what my total time said.

3605
02:43:45,420 --> 02:43:51,100
With 96% complete, I'm like, I just need more like now.

3606
02:43:51,100 --> 02:43:56,420
Do you think the ramp up or the I guess because the game has a bit of a slower ramp up I guess

3607
02:43:56,420 --> 02:44:01,020
and the fact that EA did that, I don't think it did like, I think that's wrong too.

3608
02:44:01,020 --> 02:44:05,720
I don't think it has a slow ramp up like compared to other EA games.

3609
02:44:05,720 --> 02:44:10,360
When Mass Effect, you go play Mass Effect 1 right now and you tell me besides the fact

3610
02:44:10,360 --> 02:44:15,180
that you're shooting guns in the first 10 minutes of the game, basically how quick that

3611
02:44:15,180 --> 02:44:19,740
ramp up was, it wasn't at all.

3612
02:44:19,740 --> 02:44:23,860
Well you do meet the antagonist on the first planet and you get a squad member shot in

3613
02:44:23,860 --> 02:44:27,660
the first five minutes that you think is going to be with you the whole game.

3614
02:44:27,660 --> 02:44:28,660
I mean, you do.

3615
02:44:28,660 --> 02:44:29,660
I don't remember.

3616
02:44:29,660 --> 02:44:31,100
They look like fodder to me.

3617
02:44:31,100 --> 02:44:32,100
Yeah, well, whatever.

3618
02:44:32,100 --> 02:44:33,100
All right, whatever.

3619
02:44:33,100 --> 02:44:34,100
All right.

3620
02:44:34,100 --> 02:44:35,100
Um, let's see.

3621
02:44:35,100 --> 02:44:36,100
What else I want to ask you about Mass Effect.

3622
02:44:36,100 --> 02:44:38,580
I mean, we already spent a lot of time talking about tonight, so I don't want to spend too

3623
02:44:38,580 --> 02:44:39,580
much time.

3624
02:44:39,580 --> 02:44:45,140
Oh, I know we Gabe and I were mentioning before, um, that whole sequence in the vault, uh, in

3625
02:44:45,140 --> 02:44:48,640
the very, very first vault, and I'm trying to try to say a little spoiler free, but there's

3626
02:44:48,640 --> 02:44:50,780
an escape sequence in that first vault.

3627
02:44:50,780 --> 02:44:51,780
Right.

3628
02:44:51,780 --> 02:44:55,420
And I just thought that that was the moment when the game really started to like pick

3629
02:44:55,420 --> 02:44:56,420
up the pace.

3630
02:44:56,420 --> 02:44:59,940
And that was just, that was just like a graphically stunning that whole vault and everything was

3631
02:44:59,940 --> 02:45:00,940
really stunning scene.

3632
02:45:00,940 --> 02:45:04,140
And then the kind of like the way they did that scene and the pressure that's on you

3633
02:45:04,140 --> 02:45:05,140
in that scene.

3634
02:45:05,140 --> 02:45:07,420
Um, it was like really, really good.

3635
02:45:07,420 --> 02:45:11,140
And I guess that's the point where the demo cut off, right?

3636
02:45:11,140 --> 02:45:16,380
That's before the demo or sorry, that's after the demo cut off the demo cuts off right before

3637
02:45:16,380 --> 02:45:17,540
you actually enter the vault.

3638
02:45:17,540 --> 02:45:21,300
See, that's why I thought that demo did the game of disservice too, because I don't, you

3639
02:45:21,340 --> 02:45:24,740
don't think there was a shift kind of when that whole sequence started?

3640
02:45:24,740 --> 02:45:32,220
No, cause I really, until you get all your squad mates and kind of establish what's going

3641
02:45:32,220 --> 02:45:38,060
on in this galaxy, I feel like that's all ramp up to me.

3642
02:45:38,060 --> 02:45:43,040
And so that, that, that probably takes a good 20, 30 hours if you're doing side quests and

3643
02:45:43,040 --> 02:45:44,580
stuff like that.

3644
02:45:44,580 --> 02:45:48,700
And so, yeah, I just, I don't understand.

3645
02:45:48,700 --> 02:45:50,520
It's my favorite game of the year already.

3646
02:45:50,520 --> 02:45:57,120
When I beat resident evil sevens, finally something did so Zelda wasn't number one already.

3647
02:45:57,120 --> 02:46:00,600
Like when I beat Zelda, I already put it under resident evil cause like resident evil seven

3648
02:46:00,600 --> 02:46:02,680
was way better than Zelda.

3649
02:46:02,680 --> 02:46:09,560
So no, now Mass Effect is taking the top honors and I don't see anything taking that away.

3650
02:46:09,560 --> 02:46:13,360
Um, quickly, we've talked about Mass Effect a lot tonight, so I want to move on.

3651
02:46:13,360 --> 02:46:14,680
That's all I like to talk about.

3652
02:46:14,680 --> 02:46:15,680
I know, I know.

3653
02:46:15,680 --> 02:46:16,960
I'll give you one more thing.

3654
02:46:16,960 --> 02:46:19,000
The multiplayer, nobody's talking about multiplayer.

3655
02:46:19,000 --> 02:46:20,000
Do you have any quick takes on multiplayer?

3656
02:46:20,600 --> 02:46:27,680
It's like multiplayer from three except you can jump around and it leads to some pretty

3657
02:46:27,680 --> 02:46:30,480
hilarious situations.

3658
02:46:30,480 --> 02:46:35,000
Like when you're, there's one time I was playing and this guy died, but he was on the other

3659
02:46:35,000 --> 02:46:39,920
side of the map and my roommate was watching me play and the way I got to him, I was just

3660
02:46:39,920 --> 02:46:43,840
like, cause I'm a vanguard and if you don't know what that is, I don't care.

3661
02:46:43,840 --> 02:46:49,200
But I was charging across the map to an enemy and then once I hit the enemy, my focus wasn't

3662
02:46:49,200 --> 02:46:50,200
on the enemy.

3663
02:46:50,200 --> 02:46:51,200
It was just to get me over there.

3664
02:46:51,200 --> 02:46:56,160
And then I jumped and I dashed to the side like sideways and then I charged another enemy

3665
02:46:56,160 --> 02:46:59,640
that was directly in front of me and then I just dashed without jumping to the other

3666
02:46:59,640 --> 02:47:05,400
side and I got to the, to the squad mate and my roommate was like, wow, that looked very

3667
02:47:05,400 --> 02:47:06,400
like planned.

3668
02:47:06,400 --> 02:47:11,040
I was like, well, I knew what I had to do, but yeah, it looked very fluid and like kind

3669
02:47:11,040 --> 02:47:12,200
of cinematic almost.

3670
02:47:12,200 --> 02:47:13,800
It was really neat.

3671
02:47:13,800 --> 02:47:19,280
And the difficulty versus Mass Effect 3 for multiplayer, I think is no joke.

3672
02:47:19,280 --> 02:47:25,880
Like I think this is a much harder multiplayer, whatever you want to call it, like just much

3673
02:47:25,880 --> 02:47:29,560
harder than what Mass Effect 3 was even on bronze difficulty.

3674
02:47:29,560 --> 02:47:31,040
All right.

3675
02:47:31,040 --> 02:47:35,600
Any other games you want to quickly give a shout out to while you're here?

3676
02:47:35,600 --> 02:47:38,040
With the Switch, I finally got to play Shovel Knight.

3677
02:47:38,040 --> 02:47:42,560
I had not touched, I've never played Shovel Knight until then and I think it's an amazing

3678
02:47:42,560 --> 02:47:47,360
game and if it had come out this year, I probably would put it on my top list as well, but I

3679
02:47:47,360 --> 02:47:50,320
can't because it came out like three years ago or whatever.

3680
02:47:50,320 --> 02:47:53,960
You could retroactively change your list from 2014 or whatever.

3681
02:47:53,960 --> 02:47:54,960
Nope.

3682
02:47:54,960 --> 02:47:55,960
Nope.

3683
02:47:55,960 --> 02:47:56,960
That's cheating.

3684
02:47:56,960 --> 02:47:57,960
Okay.

3685
02:47:57,960 --> 02:47:58,960
All right.

3686
02:47:58,960 --> 02:47:59,960
Fair enough.

3687
02:47:59,960 --> 02:48:01,440
Everybody, if you want to hear more of Shane's opinions on things like the Power Rangers

3688
02:48:01,440 --> 02:48:04,280
movie, check out Ranger Pride available.

3689
02:48:04,280 --> 02:48:08,520
VOG Network.com has the latest episodes and of course they also air here Wednesdays and

3690
02:48:08,520 --> 02:48:09,520
Fridays.

3691
02:48:10,480 --> 02:48:13,480
Because Gabe and Brie are here tonight promoting the indie arcade event, is there any chance

3692
02:48:13,480 --> 02:48:16,080
you're going to come out on Saturday and maybe say hi?

3693
02:48:16,080 --> 02:48:17,360
I don't know.

3694
02:48:17,360 --> 02:48:21,200
I feel like I might have something that day, like sleeping.

3695
02:48:21,200 --> 02:48:22,200
Boo.

3696
02:48:22,200 --> 02:48:23,200
Boo.

3697
02:48:23,200 --> 02:48:24,200
I know I'm terrible.

3698
02:48:24,200 --> 02:48:25,200
Yell at him.

3699
02:48:25,200 --> 02:48:26,200
No.

3700
02:48:26,200 --> 02:48:27,200
All right.

3701
02:48:27,200 --> 02:48:30,240
Or you know what, I might start my next playthrough of Mass Effect now that I have to chart out

3702
02:48:30,240 --> 02:48:33,560
how to get 100% and all the choices I want to make.

3703
02:48:33,560 --> 02:48:34,560
All right.

3704
02:48:34,560 --> 02:48:35,560
We didn't want you there anyway.

3705
02:48:35,560 --> 02:48:36,560
All right.

3706
02:48:36,560 --> 02:48:37,560
I didn't want you there.

3707
02:48:37,560 --> 02:48:38,560
All right.

3708
02:48:38,600 --> 02:48:39,600
All right.

3709
02:48:39,600 --> 02:48:40,600
Shane, take care.

3710
02:48:40,600 --> 02:48:41,600
Bye.

3711
02:48:41,600 --> 02:48:42,600
Bye.

3712
02:48:42,600 --> 02:48:43,600
All right.

3713
02:48:43,600 --> 02:48:44,600
We'll go ahead and open up the Skype line.

3714
02:48:44,600 --> 02:48:47,320
I think it's probably a good segue for us to take some more calls.

3715
02:48:47,320 --> 02:48:49,000
So we'll try to fit in a couple more calls here.

3716
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:51,400
Orange Lounge, are you okay over there, Brie?

3717
02:48:51,400 --> 02:48:52,560
Don't take him seriously.

3718
02:48:52,560 --> 02:48:53,560
He's just a...

3719
02:48:53,560 --> 02:48:54,560
Yeah.

3720
02:48:54,560 --> 02:48:55,560
All right.

3721
02:48:55,560 --> 02:48:56,560
Orange Lounge Radio.

3722
02:48:56,560 --> 02:49:01,120
All one word on Skype if you want to give us a call or 1-877-GAME-OLR if you want to

3723
02:49:01,120 --> 02:49:03,440
do it the old fashioned way.

3724
02:49:03,440 --> 02:49:04,680
And of course, Gabe and Brie are here as well.

3725
02:49:04,680 --> 02:49:08,040
If you have any questions about game development, tonight is a great night for those types of

3726
02:49:08,040 --> 02:49:09,040
fans.

3727
02:49:09,040 --> 02:49:11,920
I do want to give a couple of quick shout outs here before we jump right into the phone

3728
02:49:11,920 --> 02:49:14,520
lines with some news.

3729
02:49:14,520 --> 02:49:18,080
Speaking of game development, how many y'all out there using Unity?

3730
02:49:18,080 --> 02:49:19,080
Use Unity for yourself?

3731
02:49:19,080 --> 02:49:20,600
I am, as a matter of fact.

3732
02:49:20,600 --> 02:49:21,600
You hear about this?

3733
02:49:21,600 --> 02:49:28,180
5.6 Unity is going to be bringing native Nintendo Switch support into Unity.

3734
02:49:28,180 --> 02:49:31,240
So obviously, Nintendo Switch is a new opportunity for folks.

3735
02:49:31,240 --> 02:49:32,240
There's already...

3736
02:49:32,240 --> 02:49:34,640
Now, Unity can already support Nintendo Switch.

3737
02:49:34,640 --> 02:49:37,060
Super Bomberman, Snipperclips.

3738
02:49:37,060 --> 02:49:42,540
Those were already on Unity, but there's going to be more support, or native support

3739
02:49:42,540 --> 02:49:45,480
I guess, for Nintendo Switch available with Unity.

3740
02:49:45,480 --> 02:49:49,140
These other games were created on an older version of Unity, which was not native, but

3741
02:49:49,140 --> 02:49:51,300
that's just going to make it easier.

3742
02:49:51,300 --> 02:49:52,300
Very much.

3743
02:49:52,300 --> 02:49:54,300
So that's going to be awesome.

3744
02:49:54,300 --> 02:49:56,020
All right.

3745
02:49:56,020 --> 02:49:57,020
Let's see.

3746
02:49:57,020 --> 02:50:00,660
That is what's happening with Unity, 5.6.

3747
02:50:00,660 --> 02:50:01,700
Let's go to the phones.

3748
02:50:01,700 --> 02:50:03,100
It's lighting up right now.

3749
02:50:03,100 --> 02:50:04,100
Let's take a call.

3750
02:50:04,100 --> 02:50:05,100
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

3751
02:50:05,100 --> 02:50:06,100
Who's this?

3752
02:50:06,140 --> 02:50:07,140
Hi, this is Reed.

3753
02:50:07,140 --> 02:50:09,620
Sorry, got a little feedback there.

3754
02:50:09,620 --> 02:50:10,620
This is Reed Junior.

3755
02:50:10,620 --> 02:50:11,620
Hey, buddy.

3756
02:50:11,620 --> 02:50:12,620
What's on your mind tonight?

3757
02:50:12,620 --> 02:50:13,620
Not much.

3758
02:50:13,620 --> 02:50:18,220
I'll try to make this short and sweet, because your show is already running as long as it

3759
02:50:18,220 --> 02:50:19,220
is.

3760
02:50:19,220 --> 02:50:20,220
Well, you know.

3761
02:50:20,220 --> 02:50:27,300
Yeah, actually, I was going to call in about some sales that I've noticed that I think

3762
02:50:27,300 --> 02:50:31,100
a lot of your listeners may like to know about.

3763
02:50:31,100 --> 02:50:32,100
Wait.

3764
02:50:32,100 --> 02:50:33,100
I got to ask you.

3765
02:50:33,100 --> 02:50:34,100
Wait, wait, wait.

3766
02:50:34,100 --> 02:50:35,700
Because you're all up on all this stuff.

3767
02:50:35,700 --> 02:50:36,860
Here's the one I really want to know about.

3768
02:50:36,860 --> 02:50:43,540
I heard something that GOG.com was taking old CD serial keys, and you could put them

3769
02:50:43,540 --> 02:50:44,540
in GOG.com.

3770
02:50:44,540 --> 02:50:46,900
Is that true, or is that an April Fool's joke?

3771
02:50:46,900 --> 02:50:50,340
Yes and no.

3772
02:50:50,340 --> 02:50:54,840
There's a very limited selection of games that you can do that with.

3773
02:50:54,840 --> 02:50:58,700
I can't remember all that is included.

3774
02:50:58,700 --> 02:51:06,580
I think at least one or two of the old stalker games you can do that with.

3775
02:51:06,580 --> 02:51:10,460
But like I say, it's very, very limited.

3776
02:51:10,460 --> 02:51:14,120
That's better than a sale, because that's getting to use something I already own from

3777
02:51:14,120 --> 02:51:16,220
like ten years ago.

3778
02:51:16,220 --> 02:51:17,220
That's awesome.

3779
02:51:17,220 --> 02:51:19,500
I just want to make sure I was out there.

3780
02:51:19,500 --> 02:51:26,980
What's even better is that I think your show is mentioned before some time ago, but last

3781
02:51:26,980 --> 02:51:33,380
year they introduced a service called GOG Connect, where you tie your Steam account

3782
02:51:33,380 --> 02:51:40,780
to your GOG account, and every so often if they can work out deals with the publisher,

3783
02:51:40,780 --> 02:51:46,340
if you've got such and such game on Steam, you get the GOG version for free.

3784
02:51:46,340 --> 02:51:51,020
Yeah, I had that happen with something I own, so that was pretty cool.

3785
02:51:51,020 --> 02:51:59,540
But even that they haven't done a whole lot lately, it kind of comes and goes in spurts.

3786
02:51:59,540 --> 02:52:04,900
You'll more likely see something happen with that right around the time they have the major

3787
02:52:04,900 --> 02:52:07,220
seasonal sales.

3788
02:52:07,220 --> 02:52:09,060
I steered you off course a little bit.

3789
02:52:09,060 --> 02:52:12,260
What sale did you want to talk about tonight?

3790
02:52:12,260 --> 02:52:17,780
Unfortunately these sales that I'm about to mention are probably going to be expiring

3791
02:52:17,780 --> 02:52:18,780
on Monday.

3792
02:52:18,780 --> 02:52:21,660
Well god damn it, Rage Nator, what am I going to do with that?

3793
02:52:21,660 --> 02:52:28,020
Well, unfortunately those that catch the show on the podcast, sorry guys.

3794
02:52:28,020 --> 02:52:29,300
Let's hear about everything you missed.

3795
02:52:29,300 --> 02:52:33,900
Let's hear about all these great deals that you fucking missed because you're not here

3796
02:52:33,900 --> 02:52:34,900
live.

3797
02:52:34,900 --> 02:52:48,740
Yeah, but they had sales on some of the adventure games, like the best series, they had sales

3798
02:52:48,740 --> 02:52:58,580
and in fact I picked up like the original missed Riven, the sequel and missed five over

3799
02:52:58,580 --> 02:53:06,020
the past year or two, right off the bat right there, they, hang on I'm going to have to

3800
02:53:06,020 --> 02:53:11,500
look at my account real quick to tell you exactly everything that is or has been on

3801
02:53:11,500 --> 02:53:12,500
sale.

3802
02:53:12,500 --> 02:53:24,140
In fact, they had the Deponia games on sale, the Broken Sword series on sale, Back to the

3803
02:53:24,140 --> 02:53:27,540
Future Walking Dead games were on sale.

3804
02:53:27,540 --> 02:53:28,540
Oh there you go.

3805
02:53:28,540 --> 02:53:33,780
I bet Bree would be, if Bree liked the Wolf Among Us and those other Telltale games just

3806
02:53:33,780 --> 02:53:37,020
a matter of time before he gets sucked into all the rest of them too, Telltale's got a

3807
02:53:37,020 --> 02:53:38,020
pretty good formula.

3808
02:53:38,020 --> 02:53:46,100
Walking the Wolf Among Us was one of the games that's on sale and even LucasArts games like

3809
02:53:46,100 --> 02:53:53,220
Day of the Tentacle, yes, in fact I picked that up so, I mean.

3810
02:53:53,220 --> 02:53:57,220
Here's the thing, if you're like, well gee this doesn't do me any good because it's already

3811
02:53:57,220 --> 02:54:01,500
Monday and I'm listening on the podcast feed, here's what you all need to do, you all got

3812
02:54:01,500 --> 02:54:05,980
smart phones, whether you got Android, whether you got iPhone, whether you have a Microsoft

3813
02:54:05,980 --> 02:54:12,660
phone I guess, they all have calendars, so you need to set yourself a reminder like every

3814
02:54:12,660 --> 02:54:16,820
Sunday morning or something, like if Sunday morning for you is at one in the afternoon

3815
02:54:16,820 --> 02:54:24,460
then fine, set yourself a reminder, check Steam Store, check GOG, check whatever stores

3816
02:54:24,460 --> 02:54:27,940
you shop on, you gotta set yourself a little reminder because otherwise you're gonna miss

3817
02:54:27,940 --> 02:54:28,940
shit.

3818
02:54:28,940 --> 02:54:29,940
Because all the good deals are on the weekend.

3819
02:54:29,940 --> 02:54:36,340
Yeah, I was gonna say, yes, I realize that a lot of people out there have the jobs to

3820
02:54:36,340 --> 02:54:44,660
go to, plus they have to worry about family obligations, etc., etc., etc., therefore

3821
02:54:44,660 --> 02:54:50,300
you can't spend as much time on the computer as I do.

3822
02:54:50,300 --> 02:54:58,180
That being said, if at all possible, do pretty much like what you suggested, like pick up

3823
02:54:58,180 --> 02:55:09,900
a date and time during the week, let's say for example, Saturday at noon, check the storefronts

3824
02:55:09,900 --> 02:55:22,860
on both services, then of course, one thing I tend to follow for information on free giveaways

3825
02:55:22,860 --> 02:55:33,060
is this one site, it's kind of a news aggregate for free giveaways, it's called EpicBundle.com,

3826
02:55:33,060 --> 02:55:45,460
in fact, I even follow them on Facebook and they'll let me know, origins giveaway, need

3827
02:55:45,460 --> 02:55:52,820
for speed for free, here's a link to it, you can grab that, or no, Steam's giving away

3828
02:55:52,860 --> 02:55:58,100
the walking dead for free, you can grab that here.

3829
02:55:58,100 --> 02:56:02,860
So I love this, comments in chat over at live.foggenetware.com, actdef says, Ragenator just needs to work

3830
02:56:02,860 --> 02:56:08,420
for CheapAssGamer at this point, Hitstun says, I watch the slick deals front page RSS feed,

3831
02:56:08,420 --> 02:56:09,780
but that's not just for games.

3832
02:56:09,780 --> 02:56:15,380
And these are both good tips, get a Twitter account if you don't already have one, and

3833
02:56:15,380 --> 02:56:19,420
follow some of these, like CheapAssGamer, that's their bread and butter is following

3834
02:56:19,420 --> 02:56:23,820
this type of stuff, and there's other well-known Twitter people out there that like to tweet

3835
02:56:23,820 --> 02:56:28,660
about the sales and so forth, so get a Twitter account, that's a good way to stay on top

3836
02:56:28,660 --> 02:56:35,780
of this stuff too, just don't follow creepos, but you can follow us at OLR, you can follow

3837
02:56:35,780 --> 02:56:40,540
me, my personal account, at Skye, S-K-I-E, I really want to get at Rob Roberts, but a

3838
02:56:40,540 --> 02:56:43,740
fucking spammer has that right now, so if y'all can report him, I'd appreciate that,

3839
02:56:43,740 --> 02:56:48,860
you can follow DarkSakura as well, you can follow Nascent Games, and Bree, you're on

3840
02:56:48,860 --> 02:56:52,700
Twitter as well, right, is that a personal or a business, can I give that out here?

3841
02:56:52,700 --> 02:56:53,700
I'm all out there.

3842
02:56:53,700 --> 02:56:55,700
You're all out there, Bree, A-E-A.

3843
02:56:55,700 --> 02:56:56,700
Yes.

3844
02:56:56,700 --> 02:56:57,700
There it is.

3845
02:56:57,700 --> 02:56:58,700
And follow Sack Indie Arcade.

3846
02:56:58,700 --> 02:56:59,700
Yes!

3847
02:56:59,700 --> 02:57:04,420
You guys, it's really easy, because you guys are really good at like retweeting all your

3848
02:57:04,420 --> 02:57:07,100
stuff, so like once you follow one, you'll get all the others.

3849
02:57:07,100 --> 02:57:08,100
Yes.

3850
02:57:08,100 --> 02:57:09,100
Yeah, so it's very easy, very easy.

3851
02:57:09,100 --> 02:57:12,060
All right, Rage Nator, I gotta let you go, so we can get more calls.

3852
02:57:12,060 --> 02:57:14,140
Sure, have a nice night.

3853
02:57:14,140 --> 02:57:15,140
You too, take care, buddy.

3854
02:57:15,140 --> 02:57:16,140
Yep, you too.

3855
02:57:16,140 --> 02:57:17,140
Bye.

3856
02:57:17,140 --> 02:57:20,620
All right, everybody in chat room giving out their Twitter handles there.

3857
02:57:20,620 --> 02:57:25,780
All right, let's see if we, we can probably squeeze in one more call, Orange Launch Radio,

3858
02:57:25,780 --> 02:57:29,580
all one word on Skype, or 1-877-GAME-OLR.

3859
02:57:29,580 --> 02:57:34,540
I wanted to make sure we talked about some movies here before we end the show tonight.

3860
02:57:34,540 --> 02:57:37,980
For one, I know, well it's Bummer, Loki's not here, because I know he's looking forward

3861
02:57:37,980 --> 02:57:42,620
to this, but the Ready Player One film is gonna be coming out in 2018, the new release

3862
02:57:42,620 --> 02:57:46,560
date is March 30th, 2018, for Ready Player One.

3863
02:57:46,560 --> 02:57:51,180
That is a pushback, it was originally going to be this Christmas, December 15th, in time

3864
02:57:51,180 --> 02:57:56,780
for the Christmas season, however, if it had not moved, it would have been going up against

3865
02:57:56,780 --> 02:57:58,320
Episode 8.

3866
02:57:58,320 --> 02:58:05,040
Yeah, so, by the way, Warcraft movie did the same thing, it had to retreat into March because

3867
02:58:05,040 --> 02:58:06,040
of Episode 7.

3868
02:58:06,040 --> 02:58:10,540
It should have kept retreating, but anyway, well, yeah, it didn't, it didn't, it worked

3869
02:58:10,540 --> 02:58:11,540
so well.

3870
02:58:11,540 --> 02:58:12,540
I liked it.

3871
02:58:12,540 --> 02:58:14,520
Yeah, there were, honestly, I didn't hate the Warcraft movie, I really didn't.

3872
02:58:14,520 --> 02:58:17,280
I was expecting to really dislike it, but I was like, it actually really wasn't that

3873
02:58:17,280 --> 02:58:18,280
bad.

3874
02:58:18,280 --> 02:58:20,640
I just, I think they just marketed it wrong.

3875
02:58:20,640 --> 02:58:22,280
I don't know how it's definitely what they did.

3876
02:58:22,280 --> 02:58:24,320
I think they just really marketed it wrong.

3877
02:58:24,320 --> 02:58:30,520
But anyway, Ready Player One will hopefully do well in 2018, on March 30th.

3878
02:58:30,520 --> 02:58:35,780
Last call for calls at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word, on Skype.

3879
02:58:35,780 --> 02:58:41,160
But the other big movie, and I know y'all are excited for this, Wreck-It Ralph 2 has

3880
02:58:41,160 --> 02:58:48,080
its official subtitle, it's called Wreck-It Ralph 2, Ralph Breaks the Internet, Starting

3881
02:58:48,080 --> 02:58:49,080
with Twitter.

3882
02:58:49,080 --> 02:58:53,360
No, I'm sorry, I threw that in there myself, but we're just kind of hoping that's where

3883
02:58:53,360 --> 02:58:54,360
he'll start.

3884
02:58:54,360 --> 02:58:57,360
No, I just, I loved, there's a lot of great stuff under, there's a lot of stuff I really

3885
02:58:57,360 --> 02:59:00,260
love on Twitter, and people I've really come to know and appreciate on Twitter, but there's

3886
02:59:00,260 --> 02:59:02,240
a lot of fuckheads on Twitter too.

3887
02:59:02,240 --> 02:59:03,240
Yes.

3888
02:59:03,240 --> 02:59:06,320
So, it's just, I hope Wreck-It Ralph comes out and is like, I'm gonna wreck it, and takes

3889
02:59:06,320 --> 02:59:12,200
all those egg icons and just, or the Mr. Creeper, Ms. Creeper icons.

3890
02:59:12,200 --> 02:59:15,120
He takes the egg icons, put them in a blender, and has a protein shake.

3891
02:59:15,120 --> 02:59:16,120
That's right.

3892
02:59:16,120 --> 02:59:17,120
That's right.

3893
02:59:17,120 --> 02:59:18,120
So, there you go.

3894
02:59:18,120 --> 02:59:21,760
Maybe that'll hit, it's Fix It Felix will fix Twitter.

3895
02:59:21,760 --> 02:59:25,840
If you know, I, what was the tweet I wrote earlier this week, because y'all know I get

3896
02:59:25,840 --> 02:59:31,600
sassy on Twitter sometimes, there was a tweet I wrote that said something like, congratulations

3897
02:59:31,600 --> 02:59:37,620
Twitter on removing the at replies so that, you know, now you have more characters.

3898
02:59:37,620 --> 02:59:40,720
Could you next work on removing cyberbullying and abuse?

3899
02:59:40,720 --> 02:59:41,720
I saw that.

3900
02:59:41,720 --> 02:59:42,720
That was, that was glorious.

3901
02:59:42,720 --> 02:59:46,880
Honestly, I feel like every, I feel like that's a recycled joke, that like I used that exact

3902
02:59:46,880 --> 02:59:49,760
same joke the last feature, Twitter, unveiled.

3903
02:59:49,760 --> 02:59:54,920
It's like, so how long until we get, anyway.

3904
02:59:54,920 --> 02:59:55,920
Let's see.

3905
02:59:55,920 --> 02:59:59,180
In chat, they're also talking about movies in chat, Tigerclaw says, anyone see Ghost

3906
02:59:59,180 --> 03:00:00,520
in the Shell this weekend?

3907
03:00:00,520 --> 03:00:03,620
I thought it was good, but it didn't do well at the box office.

3908
03:00:03,620 --> 03:00:08,120
Number three with 19 million, Beauty and the Beast at number two with 47 million.

3909
03:00:08,120 --> 03:00:10,040
Do you know what movie was number one?

3910
03:00:10,040 --> 03:00:12,700
And I'm sorry, this movie looked awful.

3911
03:00:12,700 --> 03:00:16,360
The boss, not the Power Rangers, that movie was good.

3912
03:00:16,360 --> 03:00:17,360
The Boss Baby.

3913
03:00:17,360 --> 03:00:18,360
Seriously?

3914
03:00:18,360 --> 03:00:23,540
And fucking talking baby movies, it's all those families and shit.

3915
03:00:23,540 --> 03:00:24,720
Did you see Get Out?

3916
03:00:24,720 --> 03:00:26,120
No, I really want to.

3917
03:00:26,120 --> 03:00:27,360
It was so good.

3918
03:00:27,360 --> 03:00:28,360
I would see that again.

3919
03:00:28,360 --> 03:00:31,240
Even though I know exactly what's going to happen now?

3920
03:00:31,240 --> 03:00:32,960
We need to go on movie dates like every night this week.

3921
03:00:32,960 --> 03:00:33,960
Double feature.

3922
03:00:33,960 --> 03:00:34,960
We're going to see Power Rangers.

3923
03:00:34,960 --> 03:00:36,920
We're going to say, you can't theater hop at the new theaters.

3924
03:00:36,920 --> 03:00:37,920
Did you know that?

3925
03:00:37,920 --> 03:00:38,920
It's impossible to theater hop.

3926
03:00:38,920 --> 03:00:43,360
Because I actually overheard them saying, they were talking to some kids that they ejected

3927
03:00:43,360 --> 03:00:46,540
and they said, we have sensors in the seats and we sell them by the seats.

3928
03:00:46,540 --> 03:00:49,920
And so if a seat is being sat in that we didn't sell, we know.

3929
03:00:49,920 --> 03:00:50,920
And I was like-

3930
03:00:50,920 --> 03:00:51,920
That's right, because you picked the seats.

3931
03:00:51,920 --> 03:00:52,920
You picked the seats when you were by the tickets.

3932
03:00:52,920 --> 03:00:55,880
They fucking solved the problem with theater hopping.

3933
03:00:55,880 --> 03:00:56,880
Those smart assholes.

3934
03:00:56,880 --> 03:00:57,880
Unless you sit in the aisle.

3935
03:00:58,400 --> 03:01:00,400
I guess we're still on the ground.

3936
03:01:00,400 --> 03:01:01,400
Hell no.

3937
03:01:01,400 --> 03:01:02,400
We won't go.

3938
03:01:02,400 --> 03:01:03,400
All right.

3939
03:01:03,400 --> 03:01:04,400
Anyway.

3940
03:01:04,400 --> 03:01:05,400
See, I don't know about that.

3941
03:01:05,400 --> 03:01:08,840
Because when Monet and I went to see Get Out, there were these people that were totally

3942
03:01:08,840 --> 03:01:10,960
sitting in the wrong seats and no one ejected them.

3943
03:01:10,960 --> 03:01:11,960
Oh, interesting.

3944
03:01:11,960 --> 03:01:12,960
So.

3945
03:01:12,960 --> 03:01:13,960
Maybe.

3946
03:01:13,960 --> 03:01:14,960
Because they weren't kids.

3947
03:01:14,960 --> 03:01:15,960
Anyway.

3948
03:01:15,960 --> 03:01:16,960
All right.

3949
03:01:16,960 --> 03:01:17,960
Nobody else is calling in on Skype line.

3950
03:01:17,960 --> 03:01:18,960
So I guess that's going to do it.

3951
03:01:18,960 --> 03:01:21,520
I guess, you know, WrestleMania and people went to bed, whatever.

3952
03:01:21,520 --> 03:01:22,520
But you can always email us.

3953
03:01:22,520 --> 03:01:25,080
Participate at OrangeLoungeTradio.com.

3954
03:01:25,080 --> 03:01:27,480
You can also, well, it is after midnight on the East Coast.

3955
03:01:28,080 --> 03:01:31,760
You can also send us a tweet at OLR.

3956
03:01:31,760 --> 03:01:35,680
So we do read them to ourselves even if we don't always read them on air.

3957
03:01:35,680 --> 03:01:37,660
Because there's just a lot of other stuff.

3958
03:01:37,660 --> 03:01:39,240
So I always get lost on Twitter.

3959
03:01:39,240 --> 03:01:40,320
But I do read everything.

3960
03:01:40,320 --> 03:01:41,760
I'll heart your tweets.

3961
03:01:41,760 --> 03:01:42,840
I do.

3962
03:01:42,840 --> 03:01:44,640
So I like hearting tweets.

3963
03:01:44,640 --> 03:01:46,160
I read it and I liked it.

3964
03:01:46,160 --> 03:01:47,160
Thank you very much.

3965
03:01:47,160 --> 03:01:48,160
All right.

3966
03:01:48,160 --> 03:01:49,160
Ah.

3967
03:01:49,160 --> 03:01:50,160
We've got to wrap up tonight.

3968
03:01:50,160 --> 03:01:51,160
Gabe.

3969
03:01:51,160 --> 03:01:52,160
Bree.

3970
03:01:52,160 --> 03:01:53,160
Thank you guys so much for being here.

3971
03:01:53,160 --> 03:01:54,160
It's always fun to have you guys here.

3972
03:01:54,160 --> 03:01:55,160
You guys are so much fun.

3973
03:01:55,160 --> 03:01:56,160
Thank you.

3974
03:01:56,160 --> 03:01:57,160
Thank you guys.

3975
03:01:57,840 --> 03:01:58,840
I'm so grateful for this.

3976
03:01:58,840 --> 03:01:59,840
I'm so looking forward to Saturday.

3977
03:01:59,840 --> 03:02:02,120
I know you guys are working your little tushies off.

3978
03:02:02,120 --> 03:02:06,080
And I know things are going to go wrong and it's going to feel like the end of the world.

3979
03:02:06,080 --> 03:02:07,400
But you know what?

3980
03:02:07,400 --> 03:02:09,120
You guys are doing such a great thing for Sacramento.

3981
03:02:09,120 --> 03:02:11,680
Remember, nobody's going to notice the little shit.

3982
03:02:11,680 --> 03:02:15,680
Somebody's not going to show, you know, something weird is going to happen, but don't worry

3983
03:02:15,680 --> 03:02:16,680
about it.

3984
03:02:16,680 --> 03:02:17,680
It's going to be OK.

3985
03:02:17,680 --> 03:02:18,680
That's right.

3986
03:02:18,680 --> 03:02:22,360
Do them yoga exercises Saturday morning.

3987
03:02:22,360 --> 03:02:23,360
Let it out.

3988
03:02:23,360 --> 03:02:24,360
Shake it off.

3989
03:02:24,360 --> 03:02:26,120
Let it go.

3990
03:02:26,120 --> 03:02:27,120
Let it go.

3991
03:02:28,080 --> 03:02:30,080
Or the Taylor Swift song.

3992
03:02:30,080 --> 03:02:31,080
Shake it off.

3993
03:02:31,080 --> 03:02:32,080
Shake it off.

3994
03:02:32,080 --> 03:02:33,080
All right.

3995
03:02:33,080 --> 03:02:35,000
But you guys are going to have a fantastic event Saturday.

3996
03:02:35,000 --> 03:02:37,280
I'm so looking forward to it.

3997
03:02:37,280 --> 03:02:38,760
And then we can start talking about 2018.

3998
03:02:38,760 --> 03:02:39,760
Hell yeah.

3999
03:02:39,760 --> 03:02:40,760
Yes, sir.

4000
03:02:40,760 --> 03:02:41,760
All right.

4001
03:02:41,760 --> 03:02:47,480
So, Bree, one more one more plug, anything you want to plug, any place we should follow

4002
03:02:47,480 --> 03:02:48,760
you all that good stuff.

4003
03:02:48,760 --> 03:02:54,040
Sacramento Indie Arcade is coming on Saturday, April 8th from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.

4004
03:02:54,080 --> 03:02:57,400
The updates are still available online, indiearcade.org.

4005
03:02:57,400 --> 03:02:59,240
You can get all the information.

4006
03:02:59,240 --> 03:03:00,600
Follow us on our social media.

4007
03:03:00,600 --> 03:03:04,760
We're updating that like every hour.

4008
03:03:04,760 --> 03:03:06,120
And we welcome everybody.

4009
03:03:06,120 --> 03:03:07,640
It's a safe space for all.

4010
03:03:07,640 --> 03:03:10,840
So, you know, come out, hang with us, party with us.

4011
03:03:10,840 --> 03:03:12,760
It's going to be a great time.

4012
03:03:12,760 --> 03:03:15,160
There's even speaking of party with us, there's an after party, too.

4013
03:03:15,160 --> 03:03:19,240
We didn't talk about that tonight, but there's an after party and it's going to get lit in

4014
03:03:19,240 --> 03:03:24,760
South Sac because the after party, I don't know how y'all plan this, the after party

4015
03:03:24,760 --> 03:03:28,680
is next door to Rocky Horror, which I'm hosting.

4016
03:03:28,680 --> 03:03:31,520
So yeah, I got to somehow do both.

4017
03:03:31,520 --> 03:03:34,600
I'm going to be in both places at the same time.

4018
03:03:34,600 --> 03:03:37,320
We recommend the after party for the 18 and up.

4019
03:03:37,320 --> 03:03:43,240
Well, yes, this place also serves alcohol and Shane, maybe they're saying the F word

4020
03:03:43,240 --> 03:03:44,240
at people.

4021
03:03:44,240 --> 03:03:45,240
Bring it, Shane.

4022
03:03:45,240 --> 03:03:46,240
Yeah.

4023
03:03:46,240 --> 03:03:47,240
Love it.

4024
03:03:47,240 --> 03:03:48,240
All right.

4025
03:03:48,240 --> 03:03:49,240
Looking forward to it.

4026
03:03:49,240 --> 03:03:50,880
Best of luck with the event and everything.

4027
03:03:50,880 --> 03:03:51,880
I'm so excited.

4028
03:03:51,880 --> 03:03:52,880
Thank you.

4029
03:03:52,880 --> 03:03:55,040
Gabe, any plugs you'd like to give?

4030
03:03:55,040 --> 03:03:56,040
No, no.

4031
03:03:56,040 --> 03:03:57,040
Yeah.

4032
03:03:57,040 --> 03:04:00,360
I mean, the main thing is primarily, as Brianna said, you know, in the arcade coming up that,

4033
03:04:00,360 --> 03:04:05,680
you know, the Saturday, you know, ticket prices will be $10 for the rest of the week.

4034
03:04:05,680 --> 03:04:09,240
He goes up on the day of, so it goes up to 15.

4035
03:04:09,240 --> 03:04:10,240
Don't procrastinate.

4036
03:04:10,240 --> 03:04:11,240
Yeah, do not procrastinate.

4037
03:04:11,240 --> 03:04:15,040
Sacramento, you're so addicted to complacency.

4038
03:04:15,040 --> 03:04:16,040
Stop it.

4039
03:04:16,040 --> 03:04:17,040
So be sure to come through.

4040
03:04:17,040 --> 03:04:18,040
Yeah.

4041
03:04:18,040 --> 03:04:19,040
Get your tickets early.

4042
03:04:19,040 --> 03:04:24,520
If you lived here long enough and you followed the Kings at all, you know, you're always

4043
03:04:24,520 --> 03:04:28,360
going to get fucked in the last quarter.

4044
03:04:28,360 --> 03:04:32,240
That is so, that is the greatest thing I have heard this entire weekend.

4045
03:04:32,240 --> 03:04:36,160
So do not wait until the last quarter because you're going to get beat.

4046
03:04:36,160 --> 03:04:37,160
Yeah.

4047
03:04:37,160 --> 03:04:38,160
Or fouled out.

4048
03:04:38,160 --> 03:04:39,160
Anyways.

4049
03:04:39,160 --> 03:04:40,160
So yeah.

4050
03:04:40,160 --> 03:04:42,280
So yeah, definitely come through, you know, definitely come through for that.

4051
03:04:42,280 --> 03:04:47,960
It's going to be another very inspirational event, very memorable event.

4052
03:04:47,960 --> 03:04:48,960
Yeah.

4053
03:04:48,960 --> 03:04:53,500
And then, you know, with the, with joking earlier about Crumple, Crumple will be out

4054
03:04:53,500 --> 03:04:54,760
this month.

4055
03:04:54,760 --> 03:04:56,560
Crossing Fingers this month.

4056
03:04:56,560 --> 03:05:00,020
I've had to push it back a little bit just because, you know, again, it's just one other

4057
03:05:00,020 --> 03:05:04,520
guy and myself and, and I'm working on Kinship and I'm working on my, you know, other stuff.

4058
03:05:04,520 --> 03:05:07,560
If you don't make it, you can always just say April Fools.

4059
03:05:07,560 --> 03:05:08,560
Right.

4060
03:05:08,560 --> 03:05:09,560
Next year.

4061
03:05:09,560 --> 03:05:10,560
Yeah.

4062
03:05:10,560 --> 03:05:11,560
But yeah.

4063
03:05:11,840 --> 03:05:14,840
It's going to be another club.

4064
03:05:14,840 --> 03:05:15,840
Yeah.

4065
03:05:15,840 --> 03:05:19,840
So, um, but yeah, if you, if you're following me on Twitter, uh, check out my Twitter page

4066
03:05:19,840 --> 03:05:24,280
and you'll be able to see on the pinch tweet how to pre-order Crumple again, it's just

4067
03:05:24,280 --> 03:05:29,920
$1 for the pre-order $2 when it comes out, uh, episode two is already in the works.

4068
03:05:29,920 --> 03:05:34,600
So, um, yeah, there's going to be, there's a lot of stuff happening this year.

4069
03:05:34,600 --> 03:05:35,960
So yeah, it's going to be good.

4070
03:05:35,960 --> 03:05:38,440
So thank you guys so much for everything.

4071
03:05:38,440 --> 03:05:39,440
Thank you.

4072
03:05:39,440 --> 03:05:40,440
Thank you.

4073
03:05:40,480 --> 03:05:42,000
We'll be back again before the next event.

4074
03:05:42,000 --> 03:05:45,520
There's always some reason to have our pals on the show here, another event coming up

4075
03:05:45,520 --> 03:05:46,520
or something like that.

4076
03:05:46,520 --> 03:05:49,120
So, uh, keep in touch XOXO hearts.

4077
03:05:49,120 --> 03:05:50,120
All right.

4078
03:05:50,120 --> 03:05:51,120
All right.

4079
03:05:51,120 --> 03:05:52,120
We'll see you soon.

4080
03:05:52,120 --> 03:05:53,120
We'll see you Saturday.

4081
03:05:53,120 --> 03:05:55,920
We'll be broadcasting live, but please come up to the black box and say hi on air at some

4082
03:05:55,920 --> 03:05:56,920
point.

4083
03:05:56,920 --> 03:05:57,920
Of course.

4084
03:05:57,920 --> 03:05:58,920
Of course.

4085
03:05:58,920 --> 03:06:02,320
Um, real quick before we officially sign off, I want to say, of course, as always, uh, thank

4086
03:06:02,320 --> 03:06:03,960
you very much for checking out our show.

4087
03:06:03,960 --> 03:06:07,960
Uh, we appreciate if you could help us spread the word, tell a friend or five or 20 about

4088
03:06:07,960 --> 03:06:11,840
the show, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but, uh, without the voices

4089
03:06:11,840 --> 03:06:12,920
here, we can't hear them.

4090
03:06:12,920 --> 03:06:16,360
Uh, we don't, uh, we don't really put ads in the show.

4091
03:06:16,360 --> 03:06:18,120
We don't really make a lot of money off doing this stuff.

4092
03:06:18,120 --> 03:06:19,360
We just do it for the fun of it.

4093
03:06:19,360 --> 03:06:23,420
Uh, that also means we don't have a big multimillion dollar website backing us up or anything like

4094
03:06:23,420 --> 03:06:24,420
that.

4095
03:06:24,420 --> 03:06:26,200
Um, so, you know, we, we need, we need help.

4096
03:06:26,200 --> 03:06:27,200
We need word of mouth.

4097
03:06:27,200 --> 03:06:32,160
So, uh, a nice five star review on a place like iTunes or Google podcasts or wherever

4098
03:06:32,160 --> 03:06:36,920
it is that you found this show, that stuff all goes a very long way as well.

4099
03:06:36,920 --> 03:06:43,480
I look to my left ever and always calamity, Jamie and her final thought tonight resist.

4100
03:06:43,480 --> 03:06:48,400
And my final thought tonight is peeps.

4101
03:06:48,400 --> 03:06:49,400
Goodnight everybody.

4102
03:06:49,400 --> 03:06:52,000
We will see you in seven days.

4103
03:06:52,000 --> 03:06:53,880
Thank you so much girl.

4104
03:06:53,880 --> 03:06:57,640
Um, why that's it?

4105
03:06:57,640 --> 03:06:58,640
We're done.

4106
03:06:58,640 --> 03:06:59,640
We're out of here.

4107
03:06:59,640 --> 03:07:00,640
Well, actually, no, we won't see you.

4108
03:07:00,640 --> 03:07:01,640
We won't see you in seven days.

4109
03:07:01,640 --> 03:07:08,200
Six days at the second, the arcade event, and then we'll see you, uh, like eight days

4110
03:07:08,200 --> 03:07:09,200
after that.

4111
03:07:09,200 --> 03:07:10,200
Cause we won't be here live next Sunday.

4112
03:07:10,200 --> 03:07:14,200
So everybody have a good week off, uh, support Bobby, who I think will still be alive that

4113
03:07:14,200 --> 03:07:18,840
night and all those indie podcasts and hardworking individuals out there.

4114
03:07:18,840 --> 03:07:19,840
Have a great night, everybody.

4115
03:07:19,840 --> 03:07:20,840
Bye.

4116
03:07:20,840 --> 03:07:23,840
You've been listening to orange lounge radio.

4117
03:07:23,840 --> 03:07:30,440
Orange lounge radio is a production of OLR studios to join us for a live show.
