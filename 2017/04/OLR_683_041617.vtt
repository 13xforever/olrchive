Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:28.000
Tonight, we're back from SAK Indie Arcade and have an interview with Lead Money Games, creators of Lil' Tanks, a side-scrolling shmup available now for all Steam platforms. This, along with as much gaming news as we can possibly fit, and it all starts right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:29.000 --> 00:32.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:52.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 683 for this April the 16th of 2017. Happy Easter to you if you celebrate it. Happy all the candy is on sale tomorrow day if you don't.

00:52.000 --> 01:07.000
My name is Rob Roberts. Here in Studio N7 in Sacramento, California, not with my co-hosts tonight, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. She sadly was not able to make it tonight. She had a little bit of last minute conflict that arose that she is currently de-conflicting.

01:07.000 --> 01:13.000
But we will hear from her a little later in the show. Joining us though in studio, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
Hello.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
Hi Loki, how are you?

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
Good.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
I'm glad.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
Filling up.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
Your meal tonight, your meal of breadsticks, Carbolicious.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
Yes.

01:23.000 --> 01:28.000
He has risen, the yeast has risen and created your breadsticks. Yes. I see how it goes.

01:28.000 --> 01:35.000
So, okay, I noticed on Facebook that you got a new toy this past week that you talked about on the show before.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
Yes.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
So you got a 3D printer.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
Yes.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
What have you printed with it?

01:39.000 --> 01:45.000
I haven't printed anything with it because I haven't finished building it yet. So it's a 3D printer kit. So actually I'm putting it together.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
Is that like an IKEA thing? You have to build it all yourself?

01:48.000 --> 02:00.000
Sort of. If IKEA didn't have like full instructions and you had to go buy internet videos that also make mistakes and don't bother to edit their videos to fix the mistakes until afterwards like get four videos into it.

02:00.000 --> 02:07.000
Oh, you know, we really should have done that back in like step two. You know, that fun stuff.

02:08.000 --> 02:15.000
So, yeah, it's been fun. I pretty much have it assembled now. The only thing I'm working on, well, I'm starting to wire it up.

02:15.000 --> 02:23.000
So I was tinning some wires before I left and hooking up the PCB and everything. But, yeah, it's been a lot of fun.

02:23.000 --> 02:31.000
A lot of slow progress because like, was it one day I spent four hours trying to square the frame because it was wobbling.

02:31.000 --> 02:36.000
Well, good luck and I will be very curious to know what you do end up printing first on that thing.

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
Well, I have purple and orange ABS that I purchased specifically.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
Oh, you got the VOG colors or the OLR colors?

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
Exactly.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
Clearly you can make a keychain or something.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
Make something.

02:46.000 --> 02:54.000
Alright, make something, dammit. Alright, we're going to get to a lot. There's been quite a bit that's been going on in gaming this week. I know we weren't here last week.

02:54.000 --> 03:01.000
I hope you all had fun joining us at the SAC Indie Arcade event, which we had done on Saturday, which is why we ended up taking Sunday off.

03:01.000 --> 03:08.000
We had a lot of fun with the event. A big, big thank you again to Sacramento IGDA for having us yet again this year.

03:08.000 --> 03:20.000
Another series of amazing speakers. They were all really good. I really love the patent and trademark talk, which I just be, I'm going to be transparent with you guys.

03:20.000 --> 03:26.000
That's right when we had the power failure. So I'm really sad we might lose that talk because it was really good.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
But everybody, there was a lot of great talks.

03:28.000 --> 03:36.000
I was going to say, stop being chats. There's so much to make a 3D printer, printable 3D printer. Well, to be honest, most 3D printers are 3D printable.

03:36.000 --> 03:47.000
You can print most of the parts to it and then the rest is all open source of like, so Maker Rail, stepper motors, and you can buy, you can pretty much build your own printer from parts you buy online.

03:47.000 --> 03:54.000
Well, I also see in chat over at live.vognetwork.com because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

03:54.000 --> 04:02.000
6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackall show, I see SSU100Matt says, Travis Donovan has a 3D printer and has printed some Mass Effect stuff.

04:02.000 --> 04:08.000
Well, Travis Donovan would call this 3D printer printing 3D printers, recursive printing!

04:08.000 --> 04:14.000
For those of you that ever listened to Understation Live, for the rest of you that haven't, that was an extremely inside joke. I apologize.

04:14.000 --> 04:22.000
Anyway, Tigerclaw in chat says, Loki could also print his own cosplay costume. You could. You could print your own Tingle outfit or whatever it is.

04:22.000 --> 04:29.000
I don't think Tingle has anything that's not spandex, so I don't think that would work. Can't print spandex on them.

04:29.000 --> 04:44.000
You can't print spandex! Take it back! It's useless. Alright. We have some guests here in the studio this week with us, joining us here, and I'm really happy to have these guys here tonight, especially because I know it's a holiday, so thank you guys so much for being here tonight.

04:44.000 --> 04:56.000
I want to introduce to you guys two of the guys, or I guess really, it's just the two of you with Lead Money Games, right? We have Andrew and Tony joining us tonight from Lead Money Games. Welcome to the show, you guys.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
Hi, how's it going?

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
Hi, good!

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Thanks for having us.

04:59.000 --> 05:06.000
Yeah, no problem. Thanks for being here. So, you guys have just released your first game on Steam called Lil' Tanks. Congratulations!

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
Thanks.

05:07.000 --> 05:14.000
How does it feel knowing that it's out there now? It's like out in the world, your game. Is it a relief?

05:14.000 --> 05:28.000
Yeah, it is. I mean, it's just, we always thought that, you know, one day we'd get there, and now that one day actually happened, yeah, it feels pretty good. Like, we actually accomplished what we set out to do, so we're really happy.

05:28.000 --> 05:39.000
Yeah, it's really hard to believe that it's actually happened, and we're still actually working on the game for little patches and stuff like that, but it's been so long, and it's still weird to say that it's been launched.

05:39.000 --> 05:53.000
So, when does the work start on Lil' Tanks 2? No, I'm kidding. Don't answer. All right, let's rewind a bit. I want to go back to the very beginning. So, you guys, this is the first game you guys have done independently, right?

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
Correct.

05:54.000 --> 06:00.000
So, where did this idea come from? Like, we're going to make a game. How was Lil' Tanks born?

06:00.000 --> 06:12.000
I think a lot of us, we're all working in the visual effects industry and all like to play games ourselves and just thought about different things we could do where we would have some creative control.

06:12.000 --> 06:28.000
And a lot of the work we do, you know, we get notes to make the shot look like this or make it look like this, and with our own project, we could make it look however we wanted to and really give us the freedom that a lot of our work in that particular industry didn't really provide.

06:28.000 --> 06:35.000
So, that combined with the idea that we just love gaming, it just put two and two together.

06:35.000 --> 06:46.000
I hear you loud and clear on that because part of the reason OLR exists is because in college I was thinking at one point I was going to be a radio DJ, but then did you know that you have to say this and you have to do it this way?

06:46.000 --> 06:53.000
And you have to do, there's so many lines you have to color in and that's just not who I am. And it sounds like maybe not who you guys are either.

06:53.000 --> 07:00.000
So, tell us a little bit about the game Lil' Tanks. Like, what is it? How would you describe it to somebody who's never played it?

07:00.000 --> 07:08.000
I would say it's like a side-scrolling shoot-em-up. So, you're a little tank and you drive around and destroy aliens.

07:08.000 --> 07:13.000
And with this game though, I don't know about Tony, but I'm terrible at shoot-em-ups and bullet hell games.

07:13.000 --> 07:23.000
So, we wanted to make something where if you were terrible at this game, as long as you kept playing it, then you would get better by the tank leveling up.

07:23.000 --> 07:31.000
So, there's like some RPG elements in it where every single enemy you kill gives you a little bit of experience and every bit of experience helps you level up.

07:31.000 --> 07:39.000
And when you level up, you get permanent upgrades to your tank. So, it makes it a lot easier to beat the level you're on and it's actually possible to beat this entire game.

07:39.000 --> 07:46.000
It just takes time and a little bit of grinding sometimes, but it's definitely possible to beat the game even if you're terrible.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
Yeah, that was one thing you guys were kind enough to let me check out the game a couple of weeks ago.

07:49.000 --> 07:55.000
And that was one thing I noticed right off the bat that kind of separated it for me from other bullet hell types of games.

07:55.000 --> 07:59.000
Well, for one, it runs the wrong way. The wrong way. I'm using my quote-y fingers.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
I mean, I guess there's game side-scrolling.

08:01.000 --> 08:09.000
There is. I'm thinking, what's that Neo Geo game that's heavy metal? Is that it? Am I thinking of? Somebody in chat knows.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
Metal Slug?

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
Is it? Nah, maybe Metal Slug. I don't know.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
That's a little bit different. No, they have side-scroller shmups.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
But most times when you think of bullet hell, you think of the vertical ones, right?

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
Oh, yeah.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
Yeah, so this one runs horizontal, so it's a little different.

08:20.000 --> 08:25.000
But one of the first things I noticed, I like that twist that you put on it, is that you have that progression in it.

08:25.000 --> 08:35.000
So you feel like you're accomplishing something and it's like, oh, maybe this will allow me to get past that point I was stuck at previously now that I have XYZ type of power-ups.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
Yeah, yeah.

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
So where did that, where did that, was it just kind of like this is what I would want in a game?

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
Or how did you, how did you get to that feature?

08:42.000 --> 08:47.000
I think just making the game straight out like a shoot-em-up was just too difficult.

08:47.000 --> 08:55.000
And I think I really love like role-playing games. I played a lot of like World of Warcraft, a lot of Final Fantasy when I was growing up.

08:55.000 --> 09:03.000
And I just love role-playing games and I wanted to make something, or we wanted to make something that would incorporate that into like a shoot-em-up, trying to make something different.

09:03.000 --> 09:08.000
And I think it just randomly kind of worked and we tried it and it was fun and we just went with it.

09:08.000 --> 09:13.000
Yeah. And I think in addition to that, it just, it seemed like it made perfect sense.

09:13.000 --> 09:23.000
Even other just like traditional shooters will have introduced things where you can get different weapons or just give you more room to customize.

09:23.000 --> 09:27.000
And so it just seemed like it was a natural fit for it.

09:27.000 --> 09:31.000
I see some folks in chat are actually asking where the game is. They want to check this game out.

09:31.000 --> 09:35.000
So let's tell them where to find it. It's on Steam right now, right? You can search for Lil' Tanks.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
Steam is the only place right now you can get it? Are you on any other stores?

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
Yeah, we're trying to get it on other stores right now, but we're having a little bit of difficulty.

09:41.000 --> 09:49.000
But if you just search for the game on Steam, it's L-I-L space T-A-N-K-S, just Lil' Tanks. It'll pop right up.

09:49.000 --> 09:53.000
Awesome. And then there's also a website, liltanksgame.com. Did I get that right?

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
Yeah.

09:54.000 --> 10:00.000
All right. You can also go there and check it out. You got the Twitter, you got Twitter, Facebook, all that stuff that a game studio has got to have for the game.

10:00.000 --> 10:06.000
I understand what you're saying. So I want to talk a little more about what you kind of went through to make this game.

10:06.000 --> 10:14.000
So you guys were visual effects guys. So did you ever program a game before? Was this like how you were going to kind of learn to do it?

10:14.000 --> 10:19.000
Or how did you make that transition from visual effects to gaming programmer?

10:19.000 --> 10:24.000
Me personally, I did not have too much programming background.

10:24.000 --> 10:34.000
I mean, we had done, I had done some basic scripting working in visual effects, but as far as writing an entire program from scratch, that wasn't something I had really done.

10:34.000 --> 10:47.000
But a lot of the resources available to learn this kind of thing. And because it was going to be our own project, I had a lot more motivation to learn it than I might have in another circumstance.

10:47.000 --> 10:59.000
So for me, I always wanted to make video games when I was younger, but I went to Santa Rosa Junior College and tried to take some programming classes and quickly learned that I could not understand it.

10:59.000 --> 11:05.000
I couldn't get it and it was too difficult. So I actually went to art school instead of pursuing that career.

11:05.000 --> 11:11.000
And then we ended up working together at DreamWorks and we used to always talk about video games and stuff.

11:11.000 --> 11:20.000
But at DreamWorks, it was cool because you could do the work several ways. There's a way to do the work that's quickly done.

11:20.000 --> 11:28.000
And then there's a way to do the work where you can go outside of the normal means and you can write Python scripts and have stuff automated.

11:28.000 --> 11:35.000
And I always took the hard route because I hated, I didn't hate the job, but it was a lot of the stuff.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
We always push ourselves to do better.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
Yeah, exactly.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
Now, you weren't responsible for the minions, were you?

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
No, no, no.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
Oh, thank God. All right.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
Illumination.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
Oh, good. I'm glad I'm fixing that.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
DreamWorks is just a publisher.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
Okay. All right.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
No, no.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
My gosh. All right.

11:50.000 --> 11:54.000
So I learned a lot of Python on the job, which is really cool at DreamWorks.

11:54.000 --> 12:02.000
They actually give you classes on whatever you want to take, even though it doesn't quite relate to your profession or your department.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
So I always would do that kind of stuff.

12:04.000 --> 12:10.000
And then when we decided to make games, we had no experience making any type of game.

12:10.000 --> 12:17.000
But I kind of knew the language of Python and it kind of transferred over to the engine we use, which is called GameMaker.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
And it kind of was second nature.

12:19.000 --> 12:24.000
And then we just watched millions of tutorials and got it to work.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
That's outstanding.

12:26.000 --> 12:31.000
I mean, congrats, you guys, that your first game is of a quality where you can be selling it on Steam.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
And, you know, that's amazing.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
Like, you know, like he can't finish a damn game.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
I tried. I tried.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
And, you know, I see them with kids.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
I always pick.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
I believe this one does have kids.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
I have two kids and Tony has one kid.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
I try again.

12:48.000 --> 12:52.000
They were not as annoying as my kids.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
But no, no, to me, I always give him shit.

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
But to be fair, like I tried to, you know, we had some we had the guys.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
What was the YouTube things that they made cooking with unity?

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
That was it, right?

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
Yeah.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
We had them on the show and I felt very empowered.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
I was like, fuck yeah, I'm going to do this.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
I'm going to learn how to do unity and I'm going to make my game.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
I have my concept for my game.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
Like I totally knew my game was going to still do that.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
I know.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
And then I sat down and I tried to do it.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
I'm like, this is too hard.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
I'm serious.

13:13.000 --> 13:18.000
I can give you a tutorial that I know like Braxies is one I follow on YouTube quite a bit.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
And he's got a really short one.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
It's a really polished looking game and it's short.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
All right.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
So you should do that.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
Try to do it.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
That's what we need to do.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
Honest to God.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
When I was doing together.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
How about that?

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
We do.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
Let's do something together.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
That's sweet.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
Cause then that'll motivate us.

13:34.000 --> 13:38.000
We're going to brogram.

13:38.000 --> 13:43.000
We're going to brogram a game together.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
I think I just.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
Hashtag.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
This is where it pops up in the corner of our reality show.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
Hashtag brogram.

13:48.000 --> 13:52.000
Which Bobby says, now Rob will never finish a game too.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
Well, I, I already hadn't.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
So, but you know what?

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
I've been doing this podcast for 15 fucking years.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
So you know what?

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
At least, at least I've done something, something.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
All right.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
I love that.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
Here's the thing.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
I don't, I don't know how old you guys are.

14:06.000 --> 14:10.000
Probably not as old as me, but when I was younger, I was learning a Commodore 64 basic,

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
right?

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
It was like the language back in the day.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
I love my Commodore 64.

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
And what you could do is you could type programs from the back of magazines.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
Right?

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
And so part of the way I would kind of learn about it is that you type program for the

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
back of the magazine.

14:21.000 --> 14:25.000
Do you like change one little thing and like, Oh, I'm going to make this a yellow color

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
instead of a blue color.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
And it's like, yeah, I did that.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
So that was kind of part of the way I learned.

14:29.000 --> 14:33.000
So I think if I could take the same approach with something like unity or, or whatever

14:33.000 --> 14:38.000
it is we decide to use in our programming event, then, um, then yeah, we can, I can,

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
I could probably learn a lot easier, so we'll see.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
Anyway, sorry.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
I didn't mean to make it about us, but that happens here.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
I apologize.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
But congrats.

14:45.000 --> 14:50.000
I mean, again, that's awesome that like, you guys were like, we want to make a game.

14:50.000 --> 14:54.000
We have this idea and you, you learned how to program through all the videos and, and,

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
and, and came out with something that, you know, I've played and I can tell people is,

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
is a quality product.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
It's not like, well, thanks.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
You know, something, I don't know.

15:02.000 --> 15:06.000
It's, it's not like a rush thing or something that seems like short sizes.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
It's not, it's not a piece of shit.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
Yeah.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
It's not a piece of shit.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
It's not, I mean, that's, that's the easiest way to put it.

15:10.000 --> 15:15.000
Uh, considering a lot of stuff goes through, there's a lot of shit on steam.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
I don't know if you've looked.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
Yeah.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
Oh yeah.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
All right.

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
It's nice to not be in that category, but I mean, you guys have your, your cut scenes

15:22.000 --> 15:26.000
that you're doing, your, your game itself, this progression system that, you know, didn't

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
exist in games before.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
That's, that's just fucking impressive.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
Congrats.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
You know, I'm sure there's some people out there, not everybody's going to love your

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
game and there's always going to be haters out there, but you know, props to you guys

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
for accomplishing what you've done.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
So yeah.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
Um, let me, uh, let me ask this.

15:41.000 --> 15:46.000
I want to ask about, uh, how long did it take to make this game through this process?

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
So you kind of had to learn this.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
We weren't really doing it full time.

15:50.000 --> 15:56.000
Um, at first, cause we were trying to get like jobs and not, you know, do full time,

15:56.000 --> 16:00.000
uh, game development, but, uh, it's been on and off about two years.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
Um, probably the last year has been full time.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
Right.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
Tony, do you think?

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
Yeah.

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
Just about, but it's about a two years work and then, um, we just finally released.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
So, yeah.

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
So you guys actually went and I noticed you're actually wearing a shirt here.

16:13.000 --> 16:17.000
Uh, Tony's wearing a shirt that says little tanks funded by Kickstarter.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
So you guys actually ran a Kickstarter campaign for this.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
Yeah, we did.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
Yeah.

16:22.000 --> 16:26.000
And you, you were successful with your Kickstarter campaign for your brand new game of your brand

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
new studio.

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
Do you, do you guys know how rare that is to succeed?

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
I mean, congratulations.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
Thank you.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
A big time with that.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
Uh, I don't mean to keep like talking you guys up, but I'm impressed.

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
The more that I hear about what went into this, I'm just like, wow, you guys really

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
like beat the odds to do this.

16:41.000 --> 16:46.000
So the Kickstarter campaign, um, why, why did you have to go to Kickstarter?

16:46.000 --> 16:52.000
So, uh, we're both artists, but we're not like the high level, um, artists that are

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
required to make like cinematics.

16:54.000 --> 16:59.000
So what we really want to do is we wanted to, um, get some money so we could hire like

16:59.000 --> 17:03.000
a cinematic artists and make us some, some screens so we can use them in the game.

17:03.000 --> 17:07.000
Um, cause we knew that we could probably make something, but it wouldn't be to that high

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
level quality that we really wanted.

17:09.000 --> 17:13.000
So we had to go to Kickstarter to see if we could make it happen.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
Yeah.

17:14.000 --> 17:19.000
It kind of came from that and we wanted to, uh, being at this, it was our first kind of

17:19.000 --> 17:25.000
step out into the world of game development, have some help with the marketing, kind of

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
getting the word out there.

17:26.000 --> 17:30.000
And it wasn't really an effort to fund the entire game.

17:30.000 --> 17:34.000
Just kind of like, like the final stretch, like this would help us the game.

17:34.000 --> 17:38.000
We're happy with where it's at, but what we really, where we really want to get it to,

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
we need a little bit of help.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
And so, okay.

17:40.000 --> 17:44.000
And that's why I, and I looked at your, your goal for the Kickstarter was probably only

17:44.000 --> 17:48.000
around like what, $5,000, which for a game developments relatively low.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
Yeah.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
So, okay.

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
So I mean, I think that's, that's definitely a part of the reason I'm sure you guys are

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
successful is that, you know, since you already kind of had your product, it was just kind

17:56.000 --> 18:00.000
of like, I need that last 10% push and the final polish on it.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
Yeah.

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
I think that probably helped a lot where you were in this position where we didn't really

18:04.000 --> 18:08.000
need like full funding for the game and we didn't want to, you know, ask for that.

18:08.000 --> 18:12.000
We just wanted a little bit of help to get exactly what we wanted.

18:12.000 --> 18:17.000
And we were lucky we put it solo and we weren't greedy about it because we weren't trying

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
to become rich off our Kickstarter.

18:19.000 --> 18:23.000
We knew our game wasn't huge like that, but we need a little bit of help and it really

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
helps out.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
No, congratulations.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
Yeah.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
We just wanted to set a realistic goal.

18:27.000 --> 18:32.000
And we know people when you're, when you're buying the game, even now when it's fully

18:32.000 --> 18:36.000
released, you know, you're taking a little bit of a chance and when you're buying a game

18:36.000 --> 18:41.000
that doesn't even fully exist yet, you know, you're really kind of like putting a little

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
bit of trust in us, even if, you know, throwing us a few dollars.

18:43.000 --> 18:47.000
But it was important that we deliver what we are promising.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
Yeah.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
Yeah.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
Yeah.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
Well, again, congratulations.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
I mean, you guys made your Kickstarter.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
You got your game out there.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
That's, that's a great story.

18:54.000 --> 18:58.000
And now that'll help that when you decide to do game number two, which I hope, you know,

18:58.000 --> 19:01.000
you guys are thinking about someday, I know you want to see your little tanks with patches

19:01.000 --> 19:05.000
to, to be fully realized and so forth, but you know, someday you guys will probably

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
want to do a second game and now you'll have that on your resume and that's something you

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
can take to the population out there as well.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
So awesome.

19:13.000 --> 19:18.000
So what would you say was like the biggest thing you guys learned from this whole experience

19:18.000 --> 19:22.000
since you were new to game development at the time and you've gone, you've put this

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
out on Steam, you know, there might be people out there who are thinking of making their

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
own game someday.

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
Maybe someday Loki will actually finish Time to Car or whatever he wants to work on.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
I'm not working on that anymore.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
I'm sorry, the canceled project.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
It's time to cancel.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
Shelved.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
Shelved.

19:34.000 --> 19:39.000
So, uh, what would you say was like the, the, uh, a big lesson, one big lesson you would,

19:39.000 --> 19:42.000
you would tell other people you learned through this?

19:42.000 --> 19:47.000
Uh, one thing I could think of was just to try to plan every possible thing that you

19:47.000 --> 19:53.000
can, because I don't know how far we were into developing the game when we, you know,

19:53.000 --> 19:57.000
we need, when we realized we need to introduce just a pause feature and the way we're able

19:58.000 --> 20:04.000
to implement it, we had to go back and edit every single, you know, thing we had done

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
so far.

20:05.000 --> 20:09.000
So just trying to think out everything you're going to need to do in advance as much as

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
possible.

20:10.000 --> 20:14.000
I think, uh, for me it was, uh, originally the game was supposed to be a mobile game

20:14.000 --> 20:18.000
and we wanted to make something really short and like test the waters.

20:18.000 --> 20:21.000
I was saying, Oh Tony, I could totally make this game in like six months.

20:21.000 --> 20:25.000
We'll sell it, make some money and then we'll see how the game industry works and then we'll

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
make a really big game.

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
So originally this game was supposed to be like super small and quick, but it just took

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
over our lives and it ended up taking two years.

20:32.000 --> 20:37.000
So my advice would be like, let's say if you are going to make a game, um, try to plan

20:37.000 --> 20:41.000
small, but at the same time make something you really, really want to make because it

20:41.000 --> 20:45.000
will take up a big chunk of your life just to make this game.

20:45.000 --> 20:50.000
So don't try to make something that you kind of like, make something you really love because

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
it's, it's always going to take a ton of time.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
Yeah, I think that's really solid advice.

20:54.000 --> 20:58.000
If you guys have questions for lead money games, you can ask those in chat over at

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
live.vognetwork.com.

21:00.000 --> 21:04.000
Uh, we are in the chat of course, uh, live here on this Sunday evening.

21:04.000 --> 21:08.000
Uh, so if you have any questions for the guys here behind little tanks, lead money games,

21:08.000 --> 21:11.000
uh, ask away in our chat and we'll get some of those out here.

21:11.000 --> 21:15.000
Let's talk about actually, cause we, we mentioned before the show, um, I was mispronouncing

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
the name of your studio.

21:16.000 --> 21:20.000
I had called it lead money games and I guess because I think tanks, I think metal, I think

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
lead, right?

21:21.000 --> 21:25.000
But I guess it's actually lead money games, which first off, can we give props to voiceover

21:25.000 --> 21:30.000
guy, Jason, by the way, who actually got the first time when you told me it was lead money

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
games.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
I was like, Oh shit.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
And I went and listened to this week's intro and I was like, wow, Jason got it.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
He got it.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
I didn't get it.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
He got it.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
So where's the name come from?

21:38.000 --> 21:43.000
So, uh, when we worked at dreamworks, uh, Tony and I were both, uh, lead artists and,

21:43.000 --> 21:49.000
uh, as a lead artist in our department, we, um, took on a ton of responsibilities and,

21:49.000 --> 21:52.000
uh, way more than the average artists would do.

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
And, uh, we were in charge of a lot of shots and approving shots.

21:55.000 --> 22:00.000
And then, um, at the end of the day, we made the same amount of money as everyone else.

22:00.000 --> 22:05.000
Um, so we always would joke around and say, Hey, um, Tony, you're going to buy a house

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
with all that lead money you just made.

22:07.000 --> 22:10.000
And we would joke about it all the time.

22:10.000 --> 22:13.000
And, uh, I think Tony was the one who came up with the name.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
He's like, Oh, let's call our company lead money games.

22:15.000 --> 22:21.000
And at one point we saw a website, um, uh, domain, it was lead money games, that cash

22:21.000 --> 22:24.000
you tried to get, but it was too expensive or something.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
Okay.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
I seriously love that story.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
I won't fuck that name up again after hearing that.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
That's a great story behind that.

22:30.000 --> 22:34.000
So, um, tell us a little bit about some of the things you might be working on for the

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
games future.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
I understand you may not want to give away all your secrets, but what do people have

22:37.000 --> 22:41.000
to look forward to, um, that, you know, cause we, I bet we have some people that might be

22:41.000 --> 22:44.000
listening that already follow you guys and heard you were going to be on here tonight.

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
What are some of the things they might have to look forward to in future patches?

22:47.000 --> 22:52.000
Um, well, besides just like, we're going to try to tweak, uh, a few little things, gameplay

22:52.000 --> 22:55.000
wise, just to try and balance things out.

22:55.000 --> 23:01.000
But, uh, the, the main thing we're working on right now is going to be the addition of,

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
uh, two more stages.

23:03.000 --> 23:08.000
Um, one of the tiers on our Kickstarter was that you're able to design a stage from scratch.

23:08.000 --> 23:13.000
You know, you select the location, enemies design, the boss, so on, so forth.

23:13.000 --> 23:18.000
And so, uh, we're working with, uh, the, the couple of people that backed us at that tier

23:18.000 --> 23:23.000
right now, and those are going to be made available, uh, as a patch, it's going to be

23:23.000 --> 23:26.000
free content, not extra money or anything like that.

23:26.000 --> 23:29.000
It's just going to be added right onto the game.

23:29.000 --> 23:34.000
Um, after that, maybe add a little bit more weapon variety, but we're still kind of playing

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
with ideas, but for sure, the two stages.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
Yeah.

23:37.000 --> 23:41.000
Like, uh, those one thing, like, um, we got some from some reviews are saying like the

23:41.000 --> 23:42.800
last level is kind of a bummer.

23:42.800 --> 23:45.400
The boss is super hard and it's difficult to get to that boss.

23:45.400 --> 23:47.800
And then when you get there, it's difficult to beat the boss.

23:47.800 --> 23:48.800
Maybe they need to get good.

23:48.800 --> 23:49.800
Yeah.

23:49.800 --> 23:50.800
That's what I think.

23:50.800 --> 23:51.800
That's what Tony said.

23:51.800 --> 23:56.800
But, uh, but actually we're going to try to make that stage more fun by check.

23:56.800 --> 23:57.800
Talk about it.

23:57.800 --> 23:58.800
Okay.

23:58.800 --> 24:02.800
So we're, uh, our idea is we're going to have, um, so the last stage, instead of just driving

24:02.800 --> 24:07.680
up to the boss and find the boss, we're introducing, uh, three new mini bosses, but we're going

24:07.680 --> 24:10.260
to have them just one pop on randomly.

24:10.260 --> 24:14.500
So it's randomly selected, uh, to start the level and then, uh, it's going to be just

24:14.500 --> 24:16.260
like more fun than difficult.

24:16.260 --> 24:20.420
And once you beat that enemy, uh, and once you'd be that boss, you'll get a ton of experience.

24:20.420 --> 24:23.860
So instead of grinding out the fifth level over and over again, or six level over and

24:23.860 --> 24:29.180
over again, instead, um, you could just play, uh, that the final level and it'll be different

24:29.180 --> 24:33.620
almost every time you play and then, um, get that needed experience that to cap out.

24:33.620 --> 24:37.080
So you have a better chance of, you know, defeating that last boss.

24:37.080 --> 24:38.460
So hopefully it'll make it more fun that way.

24:38.460 --> 24:39.460
Well, thank you.

24:39.460 --> 24:41.180
I feel like we just got an exclusive there.

24:41.180 --> 24:42.180
Awesome.

24:42.180 --> 24:43.180
Awesome.

24:43.180 --> 24:44.180
All right.

24:44.180 --> 24:45.180
exclusive on OLR.

24:45.180 --> 24:46.180
Awesome.

24:46.180 --> 24:47.180
Uh, well, good, good luck with that.

24:47.180 --> 24:49.940
That sounds, uh, I like that concept, like maybe the three little mini bosses that could

24:49.940 --> 24:50.940
be randomized a little bit.

24:50.940 --> 24:51.940
Okay.

24:51.940 --> 24:52.940
That'd be cool.

24:52.940 --> 24:55.740
Um, do you ever, this is something I've heard from some indie developers that is always

24:55.740 --> 24:59.280
like a phenomenon, uh, especially when they put their first game out there in this day

24:59.280 --> 25:03.180
and age that we live in, in 2017, maybe you have, or haven't experienced this yet.

25:03.180 --> 25:05.420
Have you seen anybody live streaming your game?

25:05.420 --> 25:09.900
Have you seen any of that feedback directly or YouTube or any of that stuff?

25:09.900 --> 25:15.460
We have, um, luckily, uh, early on we found someone, uh, named high site and he does a

25:15.460 --> 25:20.180
bunch of, uh, indie reviews where he plays the game for the first time on Twitch and

25:20.180 --> 25:25.020
he streams it and he gives like live feedback and a bunch of people give feedback.

25:25.020 --> 25:30.260
And um, we did that and it made us sweat like crazy and realize what we were doing wrong.

25:30.260 --> 25:32.100
You know, it was great feedback at the start there.

25:32.100 --> 25:33.100
Yeah.

25:33.100 --> 25:34.100
But not too many people live streaming.

25:34.100 --> 25:35.100
I don't think.

25:35.780 --> 25:36.780
Yeah.

25:36.780 --> 25:39.820
I mean, at that stage we were still, uh, fairly early on in development, but we got a lot

25:39.820 --> 25:45.660
of helpful feedback and then, uh, once we've released, we've seen a handful of people kind

25:45.660 --> 25:51.280
of do like a let's play type of deal where they'll play for 20, 30 minutes and so far

25:51.280 --> 25:54.920
seems to be mostly positive feedback, a lot of laughs, which is good.

25:54.920 --> 26:00.040
So, um, what do you, what do you think now that this is like out there in the world?

26:00.040 --> 26:03.360
Again, I know, I know there's still more coming with little tanks, but as you've kind of made

26:03.400 --> 26:07.960
that transition from, you know, we were doing this visual artist thing to gaming was, uh,

26:07.960 --> 26:11.840
or the game development was kind of a hobby to, well, now it's taken up a lot more of

26:11.840 --> 26:12.840
my time.

26:12.840 --> 26:13.840
Yeah.

26:13.840 --> 26:14.840
Is, is this it now?

26:14.840 --> 26:15.840
Is this going to be the career path for you guys?

26:15.840 --> 26:17.360
Or do you plan to make more games?

26:17.360 --> 26:20.720
Is this, is this the first of many from lead money?

26:20.720 --> 26:21.720
We're actually both.

26:21.720 --> 26:26.620
Um, so our idea is we're both kind of prototyping different games and then which we're going

26:26.620 --> 26:30.100
to test them out and see which one we really like and then start developing that one.

26:30.100 --> 26:31.260
So this isn't the end.

26:31.260 --> 26:34.460
This is just the first game and we want to keep doing this forever because we love it

26:34.460 --> 26:35.460
so much.

26:35.460 --> 26:41.100
And it's like we finally found the thing that we love to do and we can actually do it together,

26:41.100 --> 26:42.100
which is great.

26:42.100 --> 26:43.100
Yeah.

26:43.100 --> 26:44.100
We get to keep working.

26:44.100 --> 26:47.300
You know, we worked together for several years, went to school together and stuff.

26:47.300 --> 26:49.660
So, uh, we go way back.

26:49.660 --> 26:52.980
It's fun to work with a, with a friend and we can work from home.

26:52.980 --> 26:58.740
You know, as Andrew and Andrew has a couple of kids and I'd have a six month old at home.

26:58.740 --> 27:03.360
So I'm able to spend a lot of time with my family and get to work on something I love.

27:03.360 --> 27:05.220
So yeah, I hope this is the first of many.

27:05.220 --> 27:06.220
Yeah.

27:06.220 --> 27:07.220
All right.

27:07.220 --> 27:08.220
That's a great story.

27:08.220 --> 27:09.220
So let's, let's plug the game one more time.

27:09.220 --> 27:10.540
Make sure everybody knows where to get it.

27:10.540 --> 27:12.500
Little tanks available on steam, right?

27:12.500 --> 27:13.500
Yes.

27:13.500 --> 27:14.500
Where else?

27:14.500 --> 27:15.500
What else should we know?

27:15.500 --> 27:16.500
Uh, any other plugs we've got to get out?

27:16.500 --> 27:20.780
Uh, yeah, it's on, uh, windows, Mac and Linux.

27:20.780 --> 27:24.340
Uh, super fun.

27:24.340 --> 27:25.340
Best game ever.

27:25.340 --> 27:26.340
Good, good, good.

27:27.060 --> 27:28.060
Good.

27:28.060 --> 27:29.060
Good.

27:29.060 --> 27:30.060
You have to keep selling it that way.

27:30.060 --> 27:31.060
It's the best game you'll ever play.

27:31.060 --> 27:32.060
You'll never want to play another game again.

27:32.060 --> 27:33.060
True story.

27:33.060 --> 27:37.460
Um, any, I, I would be a terrible video game radio host if I didn't prod this question.

27:37.460 --> 27:41.900
Any plans to do consoles, something outside of PC?

27:41.900 --> 27:45.860
So right now, um, we're both pretty poor and, um, takes money to do stuff like that.

27:45.860 --> 27:50.720
But if the game does take off and, um, people seem to like it, we would love to do it.

27:50.720 --> 27:54.580
I would love to see, um, little tanks on every console if I could.

27:54.580 --> 27:59.620
Um, but it all takes time and development and money, of course, but, um, if it does,

27:59.620 --> 28:00.620
we would love to do it.

28:00.620 --> 28:01.620
Yeah.

28:01.620 --> 28:02.620
Yeah.

28:02.620 --> 28:03.620
Get on the switch.

28:03.620 --> 28:04.620
That's the hot shit right now.

28:04.620 --> 28:05.620
Yeah.

28:05.620 --> 28:06.620
It could be console and portable and all that stuff.

28:06.620 --> 28:07.620
Yeah.

28:07.620 --> 28:08.620
Yeah.

28:08.620 --> 28:09.980
Let me ask this because we're going to transition into talking about news and the types of video

28:09.980 --> 28:11.540
games that we've been playing this week.

28:11.540 --> 28:15.020
Um, what, what, what's like, I like to ask a lot of people to come to the studio.

28:15.020 --> 28:19.340
This question, what is what you, you would think if you could only pick one, just one,

28:19.340 --> 28:23.620
your favorite video game of all time or your most influential video game of all time, and

28:23.620 --> 28:27.820
you can only pick one if you, if you start on a second one, I'm turning it off one game.

28:27.820 --> 28:32.460
I know exactly which one I'm kind of embarrassed to say though, um, don't be embarrassed because

28:32.460 --> 28:33.460
I was an addict.

28:33.460 --> 28:37.060
I told you the show started for DDR, so you have nothing to be embarrassed about.

28:37.060 --> 28:40.860
Well, I think I would, I would get into World of Warcraft and destroy my life again.

28:40.860 --> 28:45.140
There's, there's nothing, ah, no, it's World of War, there's definitely World of Warcraft

28:45.140 --> 28:46.140
for me.

28:46.140 --> 28:50.780
So, so I know these guys, thanks to, uh, Captain Matt from Starboard Power Compling knows you

28:50.780 --> 28:51.780
guys.

28:51.780 --> 28:54.540
I don't know if he told you he, him and I used to co-host a show here on the network

28:54.540 --> 28:57.180
called Horde House, which was about World of Warcraft.

28:57.180 --> 28:58.180
Yeah.

28:58.180 --> 29:01.380
So you can take that back and uh, yeah, it was called Horde House.

29:01.380 --> 29:02.380
Oh, Horde House.

29:02.380 --> 29:03.380
Yeah.

29:03.380 --> 29:04.380
That, that was the joke.

29:04.380 --> 29:05.380
Wink.

29:05.380 --> 29:06.380
Yeah.

29:06.380 --> 29:07.380
It was called Horde House.

29:07.380 --> 29:10.220
It was very, if you want to hear like what a dirty son of a bitch that guy is, go listen

29:10.220 --> 29:11.660
to, go listen to old episodes.

29:11.660 --> 29:12.660
It's not on anymore.

29:12.660 --> 29:13.660
Sadly.

29:13.660 --> 29:16.180
We all stopped playing, but um, yeah, that's good.

29:16.180 --> 29:17.180
That's good that we stopped playing.

29:17.180 --> 29:18.180
Yeah.

29:18.180 --> 29:19.180
It's so addicting.

29:19.180 --> 29:20.180
You got it.

29:20.180 --> 29:21.180
You got to get it, get out of there and live the rest of your life.

29:21.580 --> 29:25.740
Well, dark soccer is still playing, but everything in moderation, you know, like, you know, I

29:25.740 --> 29:30.500
played Final Fantasy 14, which probably just as bad, but I don't do, I don't do any of

29:30.500 --> 29:31.980
the raiding stuff anymore.

29:31.980 --> 29:33.900
I think that's once you can kind of separate yourself from that.

29:33.900 --> 29:38.740
You should get into a new MMO, like, uh, the Elder Scrolls Online or something like that.

29:38.740 --> 29:39.740
I tried.

29:39.740 --> 29:40.740
Cause that just paid it.

29:40.740 --> 29:41.740
I couldn't get into Elder Scrolls Online.

29:41.740 --> 29:42.740
I couldn't either.

29:42.740 --> 29:43.740
I tried.

29:43.740 --> 29:44.740
I tried.

29:44.740 --> 29:45.740
I just, but you know what?

29:45.740 --> 29:49.980
I tried when it first came out on PlayStation four as the Guild Wars model where it's, you

29:49.980 --> 29:50.980
don't have a monthly fee.

29:50.980 --> 29:51.980
It still is that.

29:51.980 --> 29:52.980
Yeah.

29:52.980 --> 29:53.980
Yeah.

29:53.980 --> 29:54.980
I know.

29:54.980 --> 29:55.980
I know.

29:55.980 --> 29:56.980
But when I first, it was just buggy and all that.

29:56.980 --> 29:57.980
So a lot of that's probably fixed now.

29:57.980 --> 29:58.980
So I probably do owe it a second shot, but you know, I don't know.

29:58.980 --> 29:59.980
I don't know.

29:59.980 --> 30:00.980
We'll see.

30:00.980 --> 30:01.980
Now I play Pokemon Go.

30:01.980 --> 30:02.980
At least that gets me outside.

30:02.980 --> 30:03.980
So, all right.

30:03.980 --> 30:04.980
So World of Warcraft.

30:04.980 --> 30:05.980
What about, what about for you?

30:05.980 --> 30:10.580
Uh, for me has to be a Mario 64.

30:10.580 --> 30:13.980
So Mario, Mario, uh, the platformer, not the cart.

30:13.980 --> 30:14.980
Yeah.

30:14.980 --> 30:15.980
Yeah.

30:15.980 --> 30:16.980
Okay.

30:16.980 --> 30:17.980
Platformer.

30:17.980 --> 30:18.980
I just, I still remember the day I got it.

30:18.980 --> 30:19.980
Uh, I just, I just love it.

30:19.980 --> 30:20.980
Uh, yeah.

30:20.980 --> 30:25.480
I like watching the speed runs of that stuff where people just blow through the game like

30:25.480 --> 30:28.980
minimal stars and do all these crazy tricks.

30:28.980 --> 30:31.980
Maybe, maybe some of these days we'll see people speed running your game or something.

30:31.980 --> 30:34.980
Cause you know, you do have the, you can build on it, but I'm sure you can go from start

30:34.980 --> 30:36.980
to finish or just the basics if you're good enough.

30:36.980 --> 30:37.980
Right.

30:37.980 --> 30:38.980
Uh, maybe.

30:38.980 --> 30:39.980
Yeah.

30:39.980 --> 30:40.980
Yeah.

30:40.980 --> 30:41.980
Yeah.

30:41.980 --> 30:42.980
Yeah.

30:42.980 --> 30:43.980
Yeah.

30:43.980 --> 30:44.980
Yeah.

30:44.980 --> 30:45.980
Yeah.

30:45.980 --> 30:46.980
Yeah.

30:46.980 --> 30:47.980
Yeah.

30:47.980 --> 30:48.980
Maybe.

30:48.980 --> 30:49.980
Maybe.

30:49.980 --> 30:50.980
Yeah.

30:50.980 --> 30:51.980
Can you beat your own game?

30:51.980 --> 30:52.980
Yes.

30:52.980 --> 30:53.980
Okay.

30:53.980 --> 30:57.500
I have to, I have to ask because you know, there's people, I bet if I brought on the

30:57.500 --> 31:00.700
developers of dark souls, they may not, I may get some nose out of that.

31:00.700 --> 31:01.700
We'll see.

31:01.700 --> 31:02.700
All right.

31:02.700 --> 31:03.700
Uh, let's see.

31:03.700 --> 31:04.700
You can beat your own game.

31:04.700 --> 31:05.820
It's not done yet.

31:05.820 --> 31:08.300
Some well wishes in our chat room over at live.vog.org.com.

31:08.300 --> 31:10.060
Fantas says game is lit.

31:10.060 --> 31:12.740
Uh, act F says the best of luck to these guys.

31:12.740 --> 31:14.420
The game, it does look fun.

31:14.420 --> 31:16.320
So a Robert M says it looks interesting.

31:16.320 --> 31:18.400
So I think there's a lot of people checking that out right now.

31:18.400 --> 31:21.280
So hopefully, uh, hopefully, uh, some more people will check it out.

31:21.280 --> 31:22.800
Thanks to you guys coming here tonight.

31:22.800 --> 31:23.800
Great.

31:23.800 --> 31:26.600
Uh, we're going to move on and talk a little bit about, um, what's going on in gaming news

31:26.600 --> 31:32.520
and our gaming weeks and so forth, but please as gaming fans, stick around and give us your

31:32.520 --> 31:34.520
input on what's going on with the gaming news.

31:34.520 --> 31:35.520
Okay.

31:35.520 --> 31:36.520
All right.

31:36.520 --> 31:37.520
Awesome.

31:37.520 --> 31:39.400
So let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we've been playing

31:39.400 --> 31:40.400
this week.

31:40.400 --> 31:42.280
So you guys may not know this, but we like to go around every week.

31:42.280 --> 31:45.740
We just talk about a game or two that we've been playing this week and what we're into

31:45.740 --> 31:46.740
with it.

31:46.740 --> 31:49.220
So Loki's going to start in a game or two is pretty much going to be what it is.

31:49.220 --> 31:51.800
Cause like I said, it's building a 3d printer most of the week.

31:51.800 --> 31:58.140
So, um, I still playing Skyrim still like, God, I didn't know how many hundred of our

31:58.140 --> 32:01.860
heart, how many hours a minute, Oh, it's over a hundred.

32:01.860 --> 32:05.380
And so I'm actually running into new quest lines that I've never played before because

32:05.380 --> 32:10.120
I've finished most of the mainland remains storyline stuff.

32:10.120 --> 32:13.240
So now I'm just kind of hitting up all those other quests like, Oh, I didn't even know

32:13.240 --> 32:14.240
that one was there.

32:14.240 --> 32:15.440
And that's kind of cool.

32:15.440 --> 32:20.020
So just still playing through that and then, um, occasionally playing Pokemon go just mainly

32:20.020 --> 32:23.000
just to do the, you know, daily stuff.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
That's it.

32:24.000 --> 32:25.240
Well, they have that double XP thing.

32:25.240 --> 32:26.240
Yeah.

32:26.240 --> 32:29.840
I evolved, you know, all my stuff that had been saving up and that's about it.

32:29.840 --> 32:31.760
I mean, I don't know.

32:31.760 --> 32:36.820
I, they say that you get better stuff out of the eggs, but like I have these five kilometer

32:36.820 --> 32:37.820
eggs have been hatching.

32:37.820 --> 32:38.820
It's all common nonsense.

32:38.820 --> 32:41.600
Like, Oh, goody bullshit that can just get anywhere.

32:41.600 --> 32:43.880
It's the two K eggs that have all the better stuff.

32:43.880 --> 32:44.880
Right?

32:45.320 --> 32:48.040
But I was already in the middle of, you know, five K when I was doing it.

32:48.040 --> 32:54.640
And even still though, like, yeah, I still haven't gotten any of the like baby, um, series

32:54.640 --> 32:55.640
two stuff.

32:55.640 --> 32:58.960
Oh, like the Clefas and I haven't gotten any of those ever.

32:58.960 --> 32:59.960
Wow.

32:59.960 --> 33:00.960
Yeah.

33:00.960 --> 33:03.720
I think though, actually I just hatched a toga P out of a two K during this event.

33:03.720 --> 33:04.720
So they're there.

33:04.720 --> 33:05.720
Well, I'll do that.

33:05.720 --> 33:08.040
I still have a 10 K that I'm working on right now.

33:08.040 --> 33:09.040
So, okay.

33:09.040 --> 33:10.040
I don't know.

33:10.040 --> 33:13.200
You see this sunburn that I have that is from playing Pokemon go yesterday.

33:13.200 --> 33:14.200
Actually we went out.

33:14.520 --> 33:18.100
And my friend who doesn't really play a lot of video games was super into Pokemon go was

33:18.100 --> 33:21.920
like, let's go up to Cameron park because they have the Lake up there because that's

33:21.920 --> 33:23.920
the place where they might have a dratini.

33:23.920 --> 33:27.560
Although of course none showed up yesterday, but there was, yeah, there's a shit ton of

33:27.560 --> 33:28.560
magic harps though.

33:28.560 --> 33:31.680
So it was like, you know, it was like, it was kind of like going to pier 39, but like

33:31.680 --> 33:34.520
not as much like, so, you know, I don't know.

33:34.520 --> 33:38.480
So I walked around like three laps there and I got the sunburn and so forth, but I got

33:38.480 --> 33:43.520
to tell you this, I am really blown away by the people that are playing Pokemon go because

33:43.520 --> 33:46.940
the only people that were at the Lake yesterday were all Pokemon go players.

33:46.940 --> 33:50.200
And it was either like, it was the family, they had their kids and they were on the phone.

33:50.200 --> 33:51.640
You'd see like the couple that's together.

33:51.640 --> 33:52.640
They're on their phones.

33:52.640 --> 33:56.200
I saw like older people are super getting into Pokemon go.

33:56.200 --> 34:01.520
I saw these two old late little old ladies were walking around and it was like, Oh, Martha,

34:01.520 --> 34:03.120
did you see the pine go over there?

34:03.120 --> 34:04.120
And they were talking about Pokemon.

34:04.120 --> 34:08.880
I was like, what the, this is, this is awesome that like grandma's playing Pokemon go.

34:08.880 --> 34:12.920
Like I remember when older ladies hated video games and they were the work of the devil.

34:12.920 --> 34:17.280
So this is, this is I'm stereotyping broadly, obviously, but this is just such like a neat

34:17.280 --> 34:20.280
change is that like, everybody's really getting into this game.

34:20.280 --> 34:24.580
I saw, I saw a Vietnam vet, he was, he was decorated with his jacket or these Vietnam

34:24.580 --> 34:26.860
vet there with his, I assume wife.

34:26.860 --> 34:29.080
And they were there playing the game, sitting on a bench.

34:29.080 --> 34:33.720
And the, the stock was like, you know, honestly that like, I've totally gotten out of Ingress,

34:33.720 --> 34:38.980
um, you know, occasionally I'll check to see if my, you know, MEFGs are full and they'll

34:38.980 --> 34:39.980
empty that stuff out.

34:39.980 --> 34:47.740
But like, I've totally gotten out of Ingress and, um, I mean, I casually play Pokemon go.

34:47.740 --> 34:50.860
It's just kind of something that just kill time, I guess.

34:50.860 --> 34:53.060
Um, I don't know.

34:53.060 --> 34:54.620
It was just, it was just something to do.

34:54.620 --> 34:55.940
I didn't really have any plans yesterday.

34:55.940 --> 34:59.180
It was nice that I'd be able to go outside and all that stuff.

34:59.180 --> 35:01.940
Ingress stressed me out too much is what it was.

35:01.940 --> 35:04.180
The PVP element is, can be rough.

35:04.180 --> 35:08.460
Pokemon is not, I mean, they, there's the gyms, but you don't, the gyms are so useless.

35:08.460 --> 35:09.460
It's pointless.

35:09.940 --> 35:10.940
I don't do that anymore.

35:10.940 --> 35:12.620
It's, there's just no point to them.

35:12.620 --> 35:13.620
Yeah.

35:13.620 --> 35:14.620
You can ignore them if you want completely.

35:14.620 --> 35:15.620
So.

35:15.620 --> 35:16.620
All right.

35:16.620 --> 35:19.220
Uh, well let me talk about my gaming week as well.

35:19.220 --> 35:23.060
So obviously I talked a little bit about Pokemon go, although I, I want to, uh, note in our

35:23.060 --> 35:28.180
chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, actdeftinchat makes the good old Pokemon go is dead, but

35:28.180 --> 35:31.020
in quotes he's, he's being sarcastic, lol no.

35:31.020 --> 35:32.060
Um, yeah.

35:32.060 --> 35:35.380
You know, every time I see one of those Pokemon go is dead articles, I'm like, just because

35:35.380 --> 35:38.200
you're not playing it doesn't mean other people aren't playing it.

35:38.200 --> 35:42.880
And what's happening that I'm seeing now is that it's not really the same gamers that

35:42.880 --> 35:46.360
were playing it at first that are playing it now.

35:46.360 --> 35:51.000
And it's, it's a very different set of gamers, at least from what I observed at the lake

35:51.000 --> 35:52.000
yesterday.

35:52.000 --> 35:55.120
You know, it is like a totally different demographic.

35:55.120 --> 35:59.260
And I think that's awesome that, you know, more people are playing games because of something

35:59.260 --> 36:00.260
like Pokemon go.

36:00.260 --> 36:03.380
That's just a different type of game that gets you out in the real world doing different

36:03.380 --> 36:04.380
stuff.

36:04.380 --> 36:05.380
Yeah.

36:05.380 --> 36:07.800
And Bobby Blackpool says, yes, it does mean that if I'm not playing it, it's dead.

36:07.800 --> 36:12.600
Swear to God, the next time I see an article on one of those websites, I'm coming for him.

36:12.600 --> 36:13.600
Listen up Forbes.

36:13.600 --> 36:18.200
It's just, it's not as prevalent as when, you know, first came out, everyone just gathered

36:18.200 --> 36:21.120
around the park and it's like, holy crap, what are all these people doing out there?

36:21.120 --> 36:22.120
Now it's just died down.

36:22.120 --> 36:23.120
But it's still a thing.

36:23.120 --> 36:24.120
I mean, yeah.

36:24.120 --> 36:28.500
Cameron Park Lake would have been swarmed a couple months ago when that game was new.

36:28.500 --> 36:33.080
Now it was just like, oh, there's a, there's a handful of people here, but that's still

36:33.080 --> 36:34.260
better than nothing.

36:34.260 --> 36:37.040
That's more people, Cameron Park Lake than they would normally get.

36:37.280 --> 36:40.440
Especially when they charge, well, they were charging yesterday cause I think they forecasted

36:40.440 --> 36:44.120
rain yesterday, but when they usually charge people to get in there, that goes, that money

36:44.120 --> 36:46.280
goes back into the local economy.

36:46.280 --> 36:48.560
Like that's an awesome thing.

36:48.560 --> 36:49.560
I think.

36:49.560 --> 36:50.560
I don't know.

36:50.560 --> 36:51.560
But anyway, haters gonna hate.

36:51.560 --> 36:52.900
Uh, other games I've played.

36:52.900 --> 36:56.840
So I'm embarrassed to say this, but I can't, I can't stop fucking playing Clicker Heroes

36:56.840 --> 36:57.840
on PlayStation four.

36:57.840 --> 36:59.360
Oh, that was the other game I played.

36:59.360 --> 37:00.360
Yes.

37:00.360 --> 37:01.360
I did play a little bit of Clicker Heroes.

37:01.360 --> 37:03.080
I have seen you on there quite a bit.

37:03.080 --> 37:04.080
I'm embarrassed.

37:04.080 --> 37:05.080
Well, cause I leave it.

37:05.120 --> 37:06.120
Okay.

37:06.120 --> 37:08.960
Just because you see me on Clicker Hills on PS4, it doesn't mean I'm sitting there clicking.

37:08.960 --> 37:13.080
I leave it running while I'm like doing stuff around the house or even in the back office

37:13.080 --> 37:14.080
on my computer.

37:14.080 --> 37:16.400
And then I'll go in, upgrade some heroes and go back.

37:16.400 --> 37:19.840
Like it is literally the game that just kind of runs in the background all day.

37:19.840 --> 37:20.840
Yeah.

37:20.840 --> 37:24.060
So, but I'm even embarrassed that I play it that much, but what can I say?

37:24.060 --> 37:25.060
It's something that I've been doing.

37:25.060 --> 37:26.060
All right.

37:26.060 --> 37:27.060
How about some other games?

37:27.060 --> 37:30.680
I've been playing Overwatch a little bit again because there's a new event going on in Overwatch

37:30.680 --> 37:33.040
called Overwatch Uprising.

37:33.040 --> 37:37.640
And the awesome thing about it is that they brought in another PvE event, which is what

37:37.640 --> 37:38.980
they did for Halloween.

37:38.980 --> 37:40.360
They did the Junkenstein's Revenge.

37:40.360 --> 37:41.960
They have something very similar to that.

37:41.960 --> 37:45.440
And I can't even remember the name of the mode now, but they have two versions of it.

37:45.440 --> 37:50.200
And one of them, you're limited to the quote unquote older Overwatch characters.

37:50.200 --> 37:58.000
So it's like Reinhardt, Mercy, Tracer, and Torbjorn are in this.

37:58.000 --> 38:02.560
And they're like, it's kind of like a prequel to where Overwatch comes from basically.

38:02.600 --> 38:04.640
And you're playing through this PvE mode.

38:04.640 --> 38:09.360
So you could do it with that setup or they did it so you can just do any hero you want

38:09.360 --> 38:10.860
in another version of it.

38:10.860 --> 38:13.960
And so they're encouraging people to play it with loot boxes and so forth.

38:13.960 --> 38:17.760
And the more I play it, I'm like, this is more fun right now for me than playing the

38:17.760 --> 38:21.460
game itself, because I don't get stressed out because more PvE.

38:21.460 --> 38:25.800
It feels like what I enjoy about Mass Effect multiplayer online is that it's more collaborative,

38:25.800 --> 38:27.520
that whole Horde mode stuff.

38:27.520 --> 38:29.680
Like it's a mode like that in Overwatch.

38:29.680 --> 38:33.920
The only place I could be critical of it is that it's kind of the same mode over and

38:33.920 --> 38:34.920
over again.

38:34.920 --> 38:38.920
So if you want to get your nine loot boxes for the week by doing this mode, it's going

38:38.920 --> 38:41.800
to get a little stale because you're kind of doing the same thing over and over.

38:41.800 --> 38:46.240
But I really hope if Blizzard is looking at where do we go from here with Overwatch, with

38:46.240 --> 38:52.160
an Overwatch 2.0 or an Overwatch Next or whatever, I really hope they flesh out more PvE modes

38:52.160 --> 38:54.420
because they're a hell of a lot of fun.

38:54.420 --> 38:58.760
And I think if there could be more diversity in it, that would be the game for me.

38:58.760 --> 39:00.000
And I'd probably play it even more.

39:00.000 --> 39:03.520
Well, that reminds me almost like they just have the trailer for Star Wars Battlefront

39:03.520 --> 39:04.520
2 this week.

39:04.520 --> 39:08.840
So yeah, Battlefront 1, I mean, I liked Battlefront.

39:08.840 --> 39:13.900
I just didn't want to play that because it's all online multiplayer and I would love a

39:13.900 --> 39:15.220
single player campaign.

39:15.220 --> 39:20.200
Now they showed like the single player campaign story trailer for it and I was like, I'm totally

39:20.200 --> 39:23.680
on board for that because that looks really interesting.

39:23.680 --> 39:27.920
And I mean that I'll probably pick up that game versus not having a single player campaign

39:27.920 --> 39:30.020
and not picking it up, you know, the first game.

39:30.020 --> 39:33.360
And then the fact they talked about they're not doing a season pass this time either.

39:33.360 --> 39:35.360
That's bold from EA.

39:35.360 --> 39:39.040
Yeah, loot box or some bullshit.

39:39.040 --> 39:40.240
This is EA we're talking about.

39:40.240 --> 39:43.280
I'm not gonna, all of a sudden they saw the light and decided, oh, we're not gonna be

39:43.280 --> 39:45.160
dicks this time.

39:45.160 --> 39:48.080
I think we have a story coming up on that later, so we'll save it for that.

39:48.080 --> 39:49.080
Just a couple more here.

39:49.080 --> 39:52.160
Drawn to Death, I checked out on PlayStation 4.

39:52.160 --> 39:54.280
That's on PlayStation Plus right now, so it's out for free.

39:54.280 --> 39:56.080
What a foul-mouthed little game.

39:56.080 --> 39:57.520
What a foul-mouthed little game.

39:57.840 --> 40:01.200
The whole time I was playing it, I was like, Loki would love this.

40:01.200 --> 40:04.880
Just in the tutorial, there's a little thing that's like, press this to use your gun.

40:04.880 --> 40:07.160
And it goes, now shoot me in the fucking mouth.

40:07.160 --> 40:09.400
And I was like, what a nasty little game.

40:09.400 --> 40:12.640
And it taunts you the whole time you're playing it and all this stuff.

40:12.640 --> 40:15.600
Well, it's supposed to be in some kid's notebook or something like that.

40:15.600 --> 40:17.880
It's like they let Twitter create a game.

40:17.880 --> 40:18.880
But it's fun.

40:18.880 --> 40:19.880
It's fun.

40:19.880 --> 40:22.740
And then lastly, but certainly not leastly, the other game I've been playing a little

40:22.740 --> 40:24.200
bit of this week.

40:24.200 --> 40:29.520
For the third time I've purchased this game, no, it's not Mass Effect, Bayonetta came out

40:29.520 --> 40:30.520
on PC.

40:30.520 --> 40:31.520
Yes.

40:31.520 --> 40:34.460
Bayonetta is so awesome.

40:34.460 --> 40:36.240
And yeah, they released it on Steam.

40:36.240 --> 40:38.940
That whole countdown clock from a couple weeks ago ran up.

40:38.940 --> 40:41.620
And of course, that's the big PC release of Bayonetta.

40:41.620 --> 40:45.920
And so now you can run it in 4K, even though my monitor doesn't really do that.

40:45.920 --> 40:50.960
But I mean, it looks great just even in the, what, 19, 20, 1080 or whatever your monitor

40:50.960 --> 40:51.960
does by default.

40:51.960 --> 40:56.500
It looks very crisp, very great frame rate I'm getting on my computer.

40:56.500 --> 41:00.220
The one thing I noticed that I was a little like, eh, is that the audio syncing is off

41:00.220 --> 41:01.220
in some parts.

41:01.220 --> 41:05.920
And probably this enhanced graphics is probably not letting itself well to that and it's probably

41:05.920 --> 41:07.800
throwing some of it off.

41:07.800 --> 41:09.480
But the game itself runs great.

41:09.480 --> 41:12.880
And it's just fun to be playing that game again, even if it is seven years old.

41:12.880 --> 41:17.780
But I hope it does well so that they'll either release Bayonetta 2 on PC, although we all

41:17.780 --> 41:21.560
know Nintendo had a hand in that, so you can't really, you know, as much as the fans

41:21.560 --> 41:23.980
want that to happen, it probably just won't.

41:23.980 --> 41:27.620
But what would be even better is a Bayonetta 3 gets announced.

41:27.620 --> 41:29.720
That would be the best.

41:29.720 --> 41:32.700
So here's hoping that that does well on PC.

41:32.700 --> 41:35.300
If you've never played Bayonetta before, now's the time.

41:35.300 --> 41:36.300
It's only what?

41:36.300 --> 41:37.300
I think it's only 20 bucks.

41:37.300 --> 41:38.300
20 bucks, yeah.

41:38.300 --> 41:39.300
Right now.

41:39.300 --> 41:40.300
Yeah.

41:40.300 --> 41:41.300
So there it is.

41:41.300 --> 41:42.300
All right.

41:42.300 --> 41:43.300
Let's see.

41:43.300 --> 41:44.300
Let's check it.

41:44.300 --> 41:45.300
Let's check it with our guests and your gaming ways.

41:45.300 --> 41:46.300
What types of video games have you been playing this week?

41:46.820 --> 41:49.580
I imagine you've probably been busy with your own game, but has there been anything else

41:49.580 --> 41:51.580
you've been playing, Andrew?

41:51.580 --> 41:52.580
No.

41:52.580 --> 41:53.580
Seriously, no.

41:53.580 --> 41:57.500
I don't have time to do much except for work on the game and test the game over and over

41:57.500 --> 41:58.500
and over again.

41:58.500 --> 42:01.780
So I'm really looking forward to the next one, but I haven't really had time to play

42:01.780 --> 42:02.780
games.

42:02.780 --> 42:03.780
That's fair.

42:03.780 --> 42:04.780
You guys did just release the game.

42:04.780 --> 42:10.780
But how long do you think that will go on for before you finally are like, okay, done.

42:10.780 --> 42:12.120
And I'm just going to let it go.

42:12.120 --> 42:17.660
For me, I think maybe two months, maybe two or three months, because we have so much to

42:17.660 --> 42:18.660
work on.

42:18.660 --> 42:23.800
But after that, I think we'll have time to just take a little break, play games and start

42:23.800 --> 42:25.440
thinking about the next thing.

42:25.440 --> 42:29.840
I just want to point out Blizzard patched Diablo II 11 years after the fact.

42:29.840 --> 42:30.840
So don't do that.

42:30.840 --> 42:31.840
Don't do that.

42:31.840 --> 42:32.840
All right.

42:32.840 --> 42:34.720
Tony, what about you?

42:34.720 --> 42:35.720
Similar story.

42:35.720 --> 42:39.360
I didn't have too much time, but I had to make a little bit of time with Yooka-Laylee.

42:39.360 --> 42:41.360
Oh, yeah.

42:41.600 --> 42:43.320
I backed that one on Kickstarter.

42:43.320 --> 42:45.120
It's the first game I ever backed on there.

42:45.120 --> 42:51.240
It finally came out and I only played it for about an hour, but it feels like it's delivered

42:51.240 --> 42:52.640
what it was out to do.

42:52.640 --> 42:56.620
You know, just kind of like a banjo style 64 platformer in it.

42:56.620 --> 42:59.200
Super colorful, super fun.

42:59.200 --> 43:01.960
I'm really looking forward to getting into the rest of it.

43:01.960 --> 43:02.960
Awesome.

43:02.960 --> 43:08.680
Yeah, I've heard the reviews on Yooka-Laylee are kind of mixed, but the people that are

43:08.680 --> 43:11.420
like actually playing it are really enjoying it.

43:11.420 --> 43:14.900
So it's like one of those things where it seems like it's for the fans and maybe reviewers

43:14.900 --> 43:15.900
don't get it.

43:15.900 --> 43:16.900
There's a lot of movies like that.

43:16.900 --> 43:20.800
Well, yeah, I think some of the gripes who are just like maybe because it's borrowing

43:20.800 --> 43:25.520
so much from that genre of games that some of the downfalls of those genre of games,

43:25.520 --> 43:28.160
they're not really tweaking the fix it or improve it.

43:28.160 --> 43:30.600
So I don't know.

43:30.600 --> 43:32.520
I think that's, I think you're right.

43:32.520 --> 43:37.040
It's that they, it's, it plays a lot like a 64 game for better or worse, you know?

43:37.040 --> 43:38.040
Yeah.

43:38.400 --> 43:39.400
I don't know.

43:39.400 --> 43:40.400
Whatever.

43:40.400 --> 43:41.400
People like it.

43:41.400 --> 43:46.240
So at least it's not Mighty No. 9, so there's that going for it.

43:46.240 --> 43:48.960
All right.

43:48.960 --> 43:52.120
Let's get into, we need to get into some gaming news already here.

43:52.120 --> 43:55.520
We've been talking a lot about our gaming weeks and of course a little tanks here, but

43:55.520 --> 43:58.560
I know there's been a lot of stuff that's happened in gaming this week, so let's get

43:58.560 --> 43:59.560
into it.

43:59.560 --> 44:01.880
First, of course, the quick plugs for our social media.

44:01.880 --> 44:06.920
We are on Twitter, twitter.com slash O L R and Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge

44:06.920 --> 44:07.920
radio.

44:07.920 --> 44:10.200
Meanwhile, Loki wants you to start us off.

44:10.200 --> 44:11.200
All right.

44:11.200 --> 44:15.840
So they finally announced the specs of Project Scorpio.

44:15.840 --> 44:20.880
So they're going to talk more about it during E3, but already it's looking like it's more

44:20.880 --> 44:24.080
powerful than the PlayStation 4 Pro.

44:24.080 --> 44:28.800
And they're doing some really interesting things with the whole architecture of it.

44:28.800 --> 44:34.240
So what's kind of unique to it from what I've seen is that they're building in some

44:34.240 --> 44:38.360
of the DirectX 12 calls and everything into the actual hardware.

44:38.360 --> 44:41.640
So it's all running hardware based instead of actually software.

44:41.640 --> 44:46.480
So they're able to improve performance using that as well as the fact that, you know, the

44:46.480 --> 44:51.880
clock speeds higher, it's got more RAM, it's got more, you know, a powerful, more powerful

44:51.880 --> 44:52.880
GPU.

44:52.880 --> 44:57.260
Pretty much everything is outspecking the PlayStation 4 Pro.

44:57.300 --> 45:04.140
And then they also kind of invited, what was it, they invited Digital Foundry to come take

45:04.140 --> 45:08.700
a look at it because they do a lot of those comparison videos between different systems

45:08.700 --> 45:09.700
and stuff.

45:09.700 --> 45:16.860
And so he was shown, Richard Ledbetter was shown, I guess, for some motorsports running

45:16.860 --> 45:27.640
a native 4K and then it was running at 60 frames per second in 4K with not even topping

45:27.640 --> 45:33.180
out the full hardware, it was basically about 75 to 80 percent of the processing power of

45:33.180 --> 45:34.180
that system.

45:34.180 --> 45:35.860
And that's pretty amazing.

45:35.860 --> 45:40.540
Just that ability to be able to push that kind of power.

45:40.540 --> 45:45.260
I mean, I'm interested to see what, I think that might actually sell me on it.

45:45.260 --> 45:48.860
I mean, it just sounds like it's going to be that much better performance wise.

45:48.860 --> 45:53.380
I'm having a hard time understanding, and I know this sounds like hypocritical because

45:53.380 --> 45:56.660
I own a PlayStation 4 Pro, but I actually, here's the thing, I actually kind of regret

45:56.660 --> 45:57.660
that purchase in retrospect.

45:57.660 --> 46:00.500
I don't think I should have bought the Pro.

46:00.500 --> 46:03.780
But if I had a 4K television, I'd probably get more out of it.

46:03.780 --> 46:08.380
But without it, I'm not getting any, I'm getting the most minor of frame rate increases.

46:08.380 --> 46:13.300
So I mean, honestly, what's the big deal about the Scorpio and the specs?

46:13.300 --> 46:16.140
If I have a high-end gaming PC, does it matter?

46:16.140 --> 46:17.140
Well, it matters.

46:17.140 --> 46:21.940
Well, I think from what I've seen, gaming PCs, in order to hit 60 frames per second

46:21.940 --> 46:28.060
in 4K, you're going to need a really powerful system to do that, like cutting edge everything.

46:28.060 --> 46:34.180
And even then, a lot of games aren't going to run natively in 60 frames per second.

46:34.180 --> 46:37.040
And the reason for that also, you're going to still have the advantage because these

46:37.040 --> 46:43.140
are custom chips that have that DirectX architecture built into them instead of it running as software

46:43.140 --> 46:44.140
in the system.

46:44.140 --> 46:45.580
And so it's a lot faster in that way.

46:45.580 --> 46:49.100
I guess it's weird to me, and I can't separate, this is what's weird to me, is because they

46:49.100 --> 46:52.380
keep insisting that Scorpio is not a new ecosystem.

46:52.380 --> 46:53.380
It's not the Xbox Two.

46:53.380 --> 46:54.380
No, it's not.

46:54.380 --> 46:55.380
It's going to play everything from Xbox One.

46:55.380 --> 46:58.120
But in my mind, I'm kind of like, well, that doesn't make any sense.

46:58.120 --> 47:03.000
Because if I have the Xbox One that already plays it, do I need this fancy pants thing?

47:03.000 --> 47:04.620
If it doesn't have its own exclusive games.

47:04.620 --> 47:07.380
I think they're just saying that right now.

47:07.380 --> 47:11.540
But I think it's going to be backwards compatible, like the 360 is backwards compatible for a

47:11.540 --> 47:13.600
lot of the games.

47:13.600 --> 47:15.720
This is just going to be more so.

47:15.720 --> 47:19.140
But if they want to develop a game that's going to take more advantage of that, they

47:19.140 --> 47:21.060
can do that.

47:21.060 --> 47:22.060
So we'll see.

47:22.060 --> 47:23.420
I mean, they're going to show it off at E3.

47:23.420 --> 47:25.820
I'd be very curious about the price.

47:25.820 --> 47:29.700
Yeah, that'd be interesting to see as well.

47:29.700 --> 47:37.740
And they're saying also with that, that different, I guess, Xbox One titles, they're just going

47:37.740 --> 47:38.820
to be able to benefit from it.

47:38.820 --> 47:42.820
Just because the fact that there's not really, you don't even really need to tweak your games

47:42.820 --> 47:45.140
for it to benefit from the system.

47:45.140 --> 47:50.200
It's just more efficient altogether.

47:50.200 --> 47:53.820
How long do you think before we have Scorpio exclusive games or whatever?

47:53.820 --> 47:54.820
They obviously...

47:54.820 --> 47:58.500
Oh, I don't think it's going to be that long, but it's hard to say.

47:58.500 --> 47:59.820
It's all about the adoption rate.

47:59.820 --> 48:02.860
So if you get a lot of people buying the system, they may be able to go that route.

48:02.860 --> 48:06.660
But I don't think they're going to do that until there's enough people on board with

48:06.660 --> 48:07.800
that.

48:07.800 --> 48:10.980
But it's also going to be the whole PlayStation Pro thing.

48:10.980 --> 48:14.980
Because when the Pro first came out, not a lot of the games looked that much better on

48:14.980 --> 48:15.980
it.

48:15.980 --> 48:18.060
And even still, I don't think a lot of them looked that great.

48:18.060 --> 48:23.020
Granted, now that they have that one patch that kind of helps boost those games that

48:23.020 --> 48:28.360
don't really have PlayStation 4 Pro features built into them, they kind of give them higher

48:28.360 --> 48:29.360
frame rates and stuff.

48:29.360 --> 48:33.840
It'll be interesting to see what this does out of the box for Xbox One games, just to

48:33.840 --> 48:39.980
see if there's that vast improvement, or how they're going to import higher resolution

48:39.980 --> 48:41.800
textures into these games and stuff.

48:41.800 --> 48:45.440
Because I would think if you have an older Forza motorsports game, that's going to be

48:45.440 --> 48:50.320
one hell of a download to download 4K textures for everything.

48:50.320 --> 48:51.320
So there's that.

48:51.320 --> 48:54.360
Granted, it has a terabyte hard drive.

48:54.360 --> 48:56.520
Phantasm Chat says, Scorpio looks interesting.

48:56.520 --> 48:58.000
You guys going to E3?

48:58.000 --> 48:59.440
No, Loki and I aren't.

48:59.440 --> 49:00.440
Do you guys do that stuff?

49:00.440 --> 49:02.200
Do you guys go to E3 and all that?

49:02.200 --> 49:04.480
No, we haven't.

49:04.480 --> 49:06.560
Have you shown little tanks at any Expos?

49:06.560 --> 49:11.040
I know you guys weren't at the SAC Indie Arcade, but any other Expos you guys do or planned

49:11.040 --> 49:12.220
us to the game off at?

49:12.220 --> 49:15.280
I think we want to try to submit to, was it Indie Arcade?

49:15.280 --> 49:16.280
Indiecade, I think.

49:16.280 --> 49:17.280
Oh, Indiecade.

49:17.280 --> 49:18.280
Okay.

49:18.280 --> 49:19.280
Yeah.

49:19.280 --> 49:20.280
But nothing yet.

49:20.280 --> 49:21.280
Yeah, not yet.

49:21.280 --> 49:22.280
Gotcha.

49:22.280 --> 49:23.280
All right.

49:23.280 --> 49:24.280
Okay.

49:24.280 --> 49:27.320
Well, no, sadly we're not going to E3, but I'm assuming we'll hear more about the console.

49:27.920 --> 49:32.440
I think we'll hear more about it sitting on our couch, so we will be at the actual convention

49:32.440 --> 49:33.440
itself.

49:33.440 --> 49:37.640
But anyway, before we get to the next story, which I want to get into, somebody insisted

49:37.640 --> 49:41.240
that they call into the show because of the guests that we have on tonight.

49:41.240 --> 49:44.120
The person that actually put us all in touch with each other.

49:44.120 --> 49:45.120
Hello, call.

49:45.120 --> 49:46.120
Are you there?

49:46.120 --> 49:47.120
Yes.

49:47.120 --> 49:48.120
Is this Hoarthouse?

49:48.120 --> 49:49.120
No, no.

49:49.120 --> 49:53.200
Hoarthouse is dead and gone and in the cemetery somewhere.

49:53.200 --> 49:55.400
Shane fell asleep on the grave somewhere.

49:55.400 --> 50:00.400
I have been sitting at my computer for three years waiting for you to call to do the next

50:00.400 --> 50:03.240
recording of Hoarthouse.

50:03.240 --> 50:04.240
How was your week?

50:04.240 --> 50:07.920
I've been sitting here doing nothing and just have jerking off and nothing until now.

50:07.920 --> 50:09.360
So this is not Hoarthouse?

50:09.360 --> 50:11.160
How was your week in WoW, Grandpa?

50:11.160 --> 50:12.800
Oh, my week in WoW?

50:12.800 --> 50:16.560
What type of Blizzard rage can I do this week?

50:16.560 --> 50:17.560
I uninstall.

50:17.560 --> 50:19.880
I can go on for hours, but it's not a Blizzard show, as you would say.

50:19.880 --> 50:21.200
All right, all right.

50:21.200 --> 50:25.640
So you're the one that introduced us to Lead Money Games, not Lead Money Games, but introduced

50:25.640 --> 50:28.040
us to the developers behind Lil' Tanks.

50:28.040 --> 50:29.640
So you wanted to call in and say hello tonight?

50:29.640 --> 50:30.640
Well, I did.

50:30.640 --> 50:31.640
Yeah, I did.

50:31.640 --> 50:34.080
I know you're in the middle of gaming news and I appreciate it.

50:34.080 --> 50:39.400
I just got back from Easter stuff and wanted to sneak into listening to the show and say

50:39.400 --> 50:40.400
a few words, but yes.

50:40.400 --> 50:41.400
Anything for you, pumpkin.

50:41.400 --> 50:42.400
Oh, thanks, Boo.

50:42.400 --> 50:43.400
No, I've known...

50:43.400 --> 50:49.240
Unfortunately, I'm not too familiar with his gaming design partner, but I've known Andrew

50:49.240 --> 50:55.440
for over 15 years, and everything from call center craziness to his military service to

50:55.440 --> 50:56.440
his creative side.

50:56.440 --> 51:02.840
And I was very excited to see his indie game pop up and back in on Kickstarter back in

51:02.840 --> 51:05.000
the day, and for all your listeners...

51:05.000 --> 51:06.560
You've known Matt longer than me?

51:06.560 --> 51:07.560
Yeah.

51:07.560 --> 51:08.560
You poor bastard.

51:08.560 --> 51:09.560
Yeah.

51:09.560 --> 51:15.040
The very first time I met Andrew was during call center training.

51:15.040 --> 51:18.920
I got sat with him to listen to a few calls, make sure that I was going to run away screaming

51:18.920 --> 51:24.400
and when the supervisor's walking me up to him like, damn, that guy is hot, which was

51:24.400 --> 51:25.400
a great intro.

51:25.400 --> 51:26.400
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

51:26.400 --> 51:27.400
I'm married, buddy.

51:27.400 --> 51:28.400
Well, now, you weren't then.

51:28.400 --> 51:29.400
Back off.

51:29.400 --> 51:30.400
You weren't then.

51:30.400 --> 51:34.280
And the very first call I listened to, he takes a call and he's going through the routine

51:34.280 --> 51:38.320
and this customer's calling and he's like, yeah, my stove caught on fire.

51:38.320 --> 51:39.560
It caught my entire kitchen on fire.

51:39.560 --> 51:42.880
And the whole time, Andrew's going, okay, sir, absolutely, I'll create a work order

51:42.880 --> 51:43.880
for that.

51:43.880 --> 51:44.880
Not a problem.

51:44.880 --> 51:47.140
I'm thinking, what the fuck am I getting myself into?

51:47.140 --> 51:50.300
And 10 years later in that industry, I'm still going.

51:50.300 --> 51:51.300
But I wanted to-

51:51.300 --> 51:53.500
Yeah, so little tanks available now on Steam.

51:53.500 --> 51:54.500
Right.

51:54.500 --> 51:59.940
Well, and the best part is I was able to back the game, of course, because I fully support

51:59.940 --> 52:02.400
it and I love it and all that.

52:02.400 --> 52:10.220
But one of my rewards as his team of developers who's forwarded the game is to design an enemy,

52:10.220 --> 52:11.900
a boss.

52:11.900 --> 52:12.900
Not a boss, man.

52:12.900 --> 52:13.900
Just an enemy.

52:13.900 --> 52:15.900
Or enemy or whatever.

52:15.900 --> 52:16.900
Close enough.

52:16.900 --> 52:21.220
The reason why they call it a boss is because Rob does everything big because he's in charge

52:21.220 --> 52:22.520
of everything.

52:22.520 --> 52:28.060
And so I've decided when the time's ready and we're ready to sit down for that chat,

52:28.060 --> 52:30.740
I'm going to call that enemy Sky.

52:30.740 --> 52:35.840
And I don't know whether we can do something like aerial where he drops bombs on things

52:35.840 --> 52:41.840
or drops nukes on things or just create a really annoyingly sounding tank or an enemy

52:41.840 --> 52:43.780
that doesn't end until you kill it.

52:43.820 --> 52:47.500
Basically, both those types of subscriptions are Rob.

52:47.500 --> 52:53.620
So I backed this game with the intent, Rob, to design an enemy named after you.

52:53.620 --> 52:55.180
This guy has my Twitter handle.

52:55.180 --> 52:56.180
Oh, I see.

52:56.180 --> 52:58.340
That's why I started rolling my eyes the minute he started talking.

52:58.340 --> 53:00.620
I think that's actually the second idea he's giving me.

53:00.620 --> 53:06.060
The first idea he said he wanted a penis that flew around and shot ectoplasm out of it.

53:06.060 --> 53:08.060
This is a family-friendly game!

53:08.060 --> 53:09.060
No, Matt.

53:09.060 --> 53:10.060
Can't do it.

53:10.060 --> 53:11.060
Sorry, buddy.

53:11.060 --> 53:12.060
Exploding unicorns, perhaps?

53:12.420 --> 53:14.420
What about on Game Pride Weekend in San Francisco?

53:14.420 --> 53:16.420
Can we have a DLC for that?

53:16.420 --> 53:17.420
Calm it down.

53:17.420 --> 53:18.420
Calm it down.

53:18.420 --> 53:20.420
You can be an 11 on Horde House.

53:20.420 --> 53:22.420
I need you a 7 or an 8 here.

53:22.420 --> 53:23.420
All right.

53:23.420 --> 53:28.420
But anyway, I wanted to congratulate the Lead Money Games team and hopefully you have a

53:28.420 --> 53:30.420
great show and interview tonight.

53:30.420 --> 53:33.420
And if you're listening, of course, please go to Steam, download the game, support them,

53:33.420 --> 53:38.420
and in the next little bit hopefully you'll see the enemy Sky raining bombs down on your

53:38.420 --> 53:40.420
parade in the near future.

53:40.780 --> 53:47.780
So you're legit going to use your money to make me a monster in a video game?

53:47.780 --> 53:53.780
There is no end to my willingness and my desire and scope of trolling you, Rob.

53:53.780 --> 53:54.780
Fuck you.

53:54.780 --> 53:55.780
Anyway, there it is.

53:55.780 --> 53:56.780
I hung up on him.

53:56.780 --> 53:57.780
All right.

53:57.780 --> 54:00.780
Sorry, I was too good.

54:00.780 --> 54:03.780
We love Grandpa Matt.

54:03.780 --> 54:05.780
Hopefully he hears that part there.

54:06.140 --> 54:11.140
Thanks, Grandpa, for spending your hard-earned money to potentially, if it passes quality

54:11.140 --> 54:18.140
assurance, immortalize me in a video game as some annoying little son of a bitch that

54:18.140 --> 54:20.140
everybody will want to shoot in the face.

54:20.140 --> 54:21.140
That's great.

54:21.140 --> 54:22.140
That's great.

54:22.140 --> 54:23.140
I'm happy to hear that.

54:23.140 --> 54:24.140
Happy to hear that.

54:24.140 --> 54:25.140
All right.

54:25.140 --> 54:28.140
He's in chat screaming now that a bitch hung up on me.

54:28.140 --> 54:29.140
But there you go.

54:29.140 --> 54:31.140
There you go, folks in chat.

54:31.500 --> 54:34.500
SHO 100 Matt says, Grandpa needs to be on more often.

54:34.500 --> 54:36.500
JD says this.

54:36.500 --> 54:37.500
Let's see.

54:37.500 --> 54:39.500
SHO 100 Matt says, we will miss you, Grandpa.

54:39.500 --> 54:41.500
Act Def says, Grandpa has his priorities straight.

54:41.500 --> 54:43.500
Don't encourage him.

54:43.500 --> 54:45.500
Don't encourage him.

54:45.500 --> 54:46.500
All right.

54:46.500 --> 54:52.500
Even if I have to take a hit there, I'm happy that it was all to help make the game happen

54:52.500 --> 54:53.500
in the end.

54:53.500 --> 54:54.500
So there you go.

54:54.500 --> 54:55.500
Thanks.

54:55.500 --> 54:56.500
All right.

54:56.500 --> 54:59.500
Let's move on with some more gaming news now that our show has been blessed with Matt's

54:59.500 --> 55:00.500
presence.

55:00.500 --> 55:01.500
Let's talk about this.

55:01.500 --> 55:03.500
This is something everybody's talking about this week.

55:03.500 --> 55:05.500
And that's the NES Classic Edition.

55:05.500 --> 55:11.500
The NES Classic Edition has had the plug pulled on it somewhat shockingly.

55:11.500 --> 55:16.500
Of course, the NES Classic Edition was the kind of must-have Christmas gift this year.

55:16.500 --> 55:20.500
It was so must-have that it was selling out instantly at stores everywhere.

55:20.500 --> 55:22.500
Scalpers are selling it up for...

55:22.500 --> 55:23.500
Oh, yeah.

55:23.500 --> 55:24.500
It's only up to $300 now.

55:24.500 --> 55:28.500
Oh, I'm sure this news just put the prices through the roof even more so.

55:28.500 --> 55:29.500
So here's the deal.

55:29.500 --> 55:31.500
Here's the official quote from Nintendo.

55:31.500 --> 55:35.500
Throughout April, NOA territories will receive the last shipments of Nintendo Entertainment

55:35.500 --> 55:38.500
System NES Classic Edition systems for this year.

55:38.500 --> 55:42.500
We encourage anyone interested in obtaining the system to check with retail outlets regarding

55:42.500 --> 55:43.500
availability.

55:43.500 --> 55:46.500
We understand that it has been difficult for many consumers to find a system.

55:46.500 --> 55:47.500
And for that, we apologize.

55:47.500 --> 55:51.500
We have paid close attention to consumer feedback, and we greatly appreciate the incredible level

55:51.500 --> 55:53.500
of consumer interest and support for this product.

55:53.500 --> 55:57.500
So in other words, Nintendo is trying to say this was the plan all along.

55:57.500 --> 56:01.500
Was that this thing was never supposed to be this popular.

56:01.500 --> 56:04.500
So we're ending it because it's supposed to not be popular.

56:04.500 --> 56:09.500
If I were a shareholder, I would be livid right now.

56:09.500 --> 56:16.500
Especially since Mario Run did not meet the same expectation levels Nintendo was hoping for.

56:16.500 --> 56:18.500
I realize the Switch is doing very well.

56:18.500 --> 56:19.500
We'll get into that later.

56:19.500 --> 56:26.500
But still, I mean, I know I'm usually one to counter Loki and come to Nintendo's defense here on the show.

56:26.500 --> 56:28.500
I'm not saving y'all this week.

56:28.500 --> 56:29.500
Nintendo deserves it.

56:29.500 --> 56:31.500
I don't I don't I don't get this.

56:31.500 --> 56:32.500
I don't think it was.

56:32.500 --> 56:34.500
I don't think it would be that expensive.

56:34.500 --> 56:35.500
The manufacturer either.

56:35.500 --> 56:39.500
I would think that they have a pretty high margin built in that thing.

56:39.500 --> 56:41.500
I just I don't get it.

56:41.500 --> 56:46.500
I think it's stupid and have the PR thing come out and say, oh, we we appreciate your feedback.

56:46.500 --> 56:49.500
It's just like, yeah, we heard you, but whatever.

56:49.500 --> 56:50.500
We don't fucking care.

56:50.500 --> 56:52.500
We'll do whatever we want.

56:52.500 --> 56:58.500
And this is just going to make it worse when they have another like, say, let's say an SNES mini comes out.

56:58.500 --> 57:05.500
It's going to be fucking impossible to get one because scalpers are like, dude, I made three hundred dollars on that sixty dollar system.

57:05.500 --> 57:07.500
I'm buying the shit out of that.

57:07.500 --> 57:09.500
And it'll be it's just going to get worse.

57:09.500 --> 57:11.500
And I think that's kind of what they want.

57:11.500 --> 57:19.500
They want people to be just like just mad crazy about buying their stuff so that you like amiibos or something like that.

57:19.500 --> 57:25.500
Oh, we'll just get people to think they're going to be rare and then they're going to try to flip them.

57:25.500 --> 57:27.500
I don't know. It's just it's stupid.

57:27.500 --> 57:29.500
They don't make any sense.

57:29.500 --> 57:33.500
Act deft and chat over at live dot vog network dot com says, yeah, not even us.

57:33.500 --> 57:35.500
Nintendo fans can apologize this.

57:35.500 --> 57:36.500
Let's see.

57:36.500 --> 57:39.500
Dark Tetsuya says, I heard people speculating Nintendo was pissed.

57:39.500 --> 57:42.500
People were hacking these things, installing other ROMs on there too bad.

57:42.500 --> 57:44.500
That was that was me on Twitter, actually.

57:44.500 --> 57:46.500
What was probably one of those people.

57:46.500 --> 57:48.500
I really think that's what this boils down to.

57:48.500 --> 57:57.500
I really, really think the reason why Nintendo pulled the plug on this and this is what makes it frustrating is I feel like Nintendo is like blatantly lying on this.

57:57.500 --> 57:59.500
I really do.

57:59.500 --> 58:07.500
You know, I understand they can't come out and say, well, due to hacking and exploiting, which is very easy to do on this system, I understand they can't.

58:07.500 --> 58:09.500
You can't tell me that they didn't have manufacturing problems.

58:09.500 --> 58:14.500
They can't figure out how to manufacture the system in quantities that can meet the demand.

58:14.500 --> 58:17.500
That is nonsense.

58:17.500 --> 58:23.500
I think and I know there's a lot of rumors out there that say, oh, well, they're pulling this in favor of doing a 2.0.

58:23.500 --> 58:24.500
No, no, no, no, no, no.

58:24.500 --> 58:28.500
You don't pull this off shelves six months before you release the 2.0.

58:28.500 --> 58:31.500
Go to the Apple playbook to see how that looks.

58:31.500 --> 58:33.500
And not even six months since it's been released.

58:33.500 --> 58:39.500
They will happily sell you an iPhone 6 full price the day before they release iPhone 7.

58:39.500 --> 58:41.500
That's not a read on Apple.

58:41.500 --> 58:42.500
Every tech company does this.

58:42.500 --> 58:47.500
So Nintendo should have been selling those NES Classics right up until they're ready to debut the NES Classic 2.

58:47.500 --> 58:50.500
I fully believe there will be an NES Classic 2.

58:50.500 --> 58:53.500
It'll have more games to sweeten the pot, but it's going to be online.

58:53.500 --> 58:57.500
It's going to be online because, A, they'll want to be able to sell you more games.

58:57.500 --> 59:00.500
Because everybody was sitting here going, why didn't they do that the first time?

59:00.500 --> 59:02.500
So, A, it's to sell you more games.

59:02.500 --> 59:06.500
Yes, I realize this could be counterproductive with the Switch Virtual Console.

59:06.500 --> 59:07.500
But who cares?

59:07.500 --> 59:11.500
If people are willing to spend the money and buy it, Nintendo's happily going to sell it to you twice.

59:11.500 --> 59:14.500
Look at the 3DS and the Wii U. They'll sell it to you twice.

59:14.500 --> 59:16.500
I don't have a problem with the Virtual Console stuff being on there.

59:16.500 --> 59:20.500
I just think the price points that they have the Virtual Console games for are way too high.

59:20.500 --> 59:22.500
Well, there's many people out there that'll still pay them.

59:22.500 --> 59:26.500
Exactly, and that's why they're going to do this bullshit because people keep buying this crap.

59:26.500 --> 59:27.500
But here's the thing.

59:27.500 --> 59:31.500
It's not only that it's going to be online to sell you the games, but more importantly,

59:31.500 --> 59:35.500
so that they can upgrade the firmware on a regular basis to stay on top of the hackers.

59:35.500 --> 59:37.500
I see you rolling your eyes already, Loki.

59:37.500 --> 59:38.500
No, they're never going to sell.

59:38.500 --> 59:40.500
It's based off a Linux PC.

59:40.500 --> 59:43.500
It's a Linux system on a chip.

59:43.500 --> 59:46.500
There's no way you're going to be able to patch.

59:46.500 --> 59:49.500
There's no amount of patching you can do to this thing.

59:49.500 --> 59:51.500
They are going to eliminate people.

59:51.500 --> 59:54.500
They're never going to stop it, but they're going to make it a lot harder than it is now.

59:54.500 --> 59:55.500
Fine, I'll give you that.

59:55.500 --> 59:56.500
Alright.

59:56.500 --> 59:57.500
What do you guys think?

59:57.500 --> 01:00:01.500
Have you been following this NES Classic or anything?

01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:02.500
You guys had interest in it?

01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:05.500
Yeah, I really wanted one when they first came out, but it was really difficult.

01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:06.500
Yeah, I still don't have one.

01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:08.500
It looks like it's never going to happen.

01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:09.500
Yeah, well good news. You're never getting one.

01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:11.500
But neither am I, so hey, we're on the same boat.

01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:12.500
We're on the same boat.

01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:17.500
But why do you think Nintendo would pull the plug on something so successful?

01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:19.500
It doesn't make much sense to me.

01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:25.500
I don't really, but it seems like a lot of things Nintendo does doesn't really make a lot of sense,

01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:30.500
but they find a way to make things a success, so I don't know.

01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:32.500
I'm not sure what they're doing.

01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:35.500
Same thing, when they came out, I was interested in getting one.

01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:41.500
I mean, I still have a working NES at home now, so I guess it wasn't a necessity, but it seemed like a cool idea,

01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:43.500
so I don't get it.

01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:50.500
But I refuse to pay hundreds on top of whatever the initial thing is. I won't do it.

01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:53.500
Well, here's an interesting little side note, by the way.

01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:56.500
You may or may not know, there's also a Famicom mini.

01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:58.500
That's what they were selling over in Japan.

01:00:58.500 --> 01:01:01.500
Obviously, Nintendo was the family computer or Famicom over there.

01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:06.500
Here's the interesting thing. Nintendo also suspended production of the Famicom,

01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:08.500
so if you thought you were going to get around it with one of these, sorry.

01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:11.500
And the games that are in it are different, too.

01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:14.500
I think like 10 of the games are different, 20 are the same.

01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:20.500
But anyway, they're ending production in Japan as well, but they're saying temporary right now.

01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:23.500
They're not saying forever.

01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:29.500
So that, to me, though, is what really is leaving the door open for a version 2.0.

01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:35.500
I think they're saying temporary in Japan because to be replaced with 2.0 later in the year,

01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:39.500
whatever they end up calling the next version of the NES Classic.

01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:43.500
I think that's just a given. We'll see.

01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:46.500
Let's see. Over in chat, over at live.vognetwork.com,

01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:48.500
Dart Tetsuya in chat says,

01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:52.500
I wonder if the Classic 2 would be modeled after the newer NES.

01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:55.500
And Brad from Pod Culture says the top loader, that would be hilarious.

01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:59.500
Actually, that's a pretty clever thing that Nintendo could do,

01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:03.500
is put out a top loader Classic NES that's their version 2.0.

01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:05.500
I actually think that's a cute idea.

01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:09.500
Or, here's my other cute idea, put the whole thing inside of Rob the Robot.

01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:11.500
Hmm? Wouldn't that be cute?

01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:14.500
Yeah, they could do something like that. We'll see. Anyway.

01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:17.500
Or how about you just manufacture more units of the system you already have?

01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:19.500
Yeah, right. That could be.

01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:23.500
Maybe they're realigning those resources to make more switches?

01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:28.500
Logically, that doesn't make sense to me, but I guess I should throw that out there.

01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:32.500
They're not manufacturing. I mean, how many did they actually sell of this,

01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:36.500
is what I'd be interested to find out, because they didn't manufacture that much.

01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:39.500
It may be a few hundred thousand units, if that.

01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:42.500
I don't even think it was probably that.

01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:46.500
I don't see that many being sold.

01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:50.500
And you can't tell me that, oh, well, they would be making switches,

01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:53.500
but they have to make these stupid NES classic minis. Come on.

01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:59.500
I mean, it's so hardware-wise, it's so minimal versus what's in a Switch.

01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:02.500
I don't even think you can compare them.

01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:06.500
All right, well, let's move on. Some more fun Nintendo news, right, Logie?

01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:08.500
Yes, because this is where their priority is.

01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:11.500
Their priority is selling you fucking amiibos, and that's what they're going to be doing.

01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:15.500
So they announced during their stupid Nintendo Direct that, hey, guess what?

01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:18.500
More amiibos for that game that came out over a year ago.

01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:21.500
Super Smash Brothers for 3DS and Wii U.

01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:30.500
They're going to be coming out with the cloud, Bayonetta, and some chick from Fire Emblem, Corrin.

01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:37.500
But, hey, in typical Nintendo fashion, you know you want those.

01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:40.500
Guess what? There's going to be some exclusive versions.

01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:44.500
And guess what? We teamed up with the best fucking retailer on the face of the earth.

01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:47.500
GameStop. Oh, baby GameStop.

01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:50.500
That's right. If you want to get...

01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:53.500
I swear to God, if the Bayonetta thing is exclusive to GameStop, I'm going to lose my shit.

01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:59.500
If you want to get a special cloud with a Cloud Player 2, they said, or a Twilight Princess Link,

01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:03.500
those are both GameStop exclusive. You cannot pick them up anywhere else.

01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:10.500
And then, what else? Oh, I should mention also they're announcing that they had other, like, Skyward Sword stuff.

01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:16.500
So Amazon is going to be, I guess, pre-ordering stuff as well.

01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:20.500
I want to say they have, like, who else are going to be exclusive here?

01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:25.500
But yeah, they basically have alternate versions of the different characters.

01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:31.500
Alright, this I will counterpoint you on, though, is because I still think the amiibos make neat little figures,

01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:33.500
and I want the Bayonetta ones for sure.

01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:37.500
The Corrin ones, I'm not as tied to that series, so I'm going to give or take on that.

01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:41.500
Cloud would be cool, but I'm not going to fight people at GameStop for the alternative.

01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:43.500
So it's kind of one of those, if I find one, cool.

01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:46.500
But the Bayonetta ones, I will fight people for, so bring it.

01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:51.500
However, I don't appreciate that you call that Nintendo Direct stupid,

01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:56.500
because they announced that they're localizing Coldsept in that little Nintendo Direct.

01:04:56.500 --> 01:05:00.500
It was a blink-and-you-miss-it type of thing, but if you've never played Coldsept before, that's awesome.

01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:05.500
An awesome little game, a little hybrid of, like, Monopoly meets Magic the Gathering.

01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:08.500
So yeah, that Nintendo Direct was not stupid, Loki. You take it back.

01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:12.500
Skyward Sword Link and Corrin Player 2 version, which is stupid.

01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:17.500
Those are both Amazon exclusives, so if you want to get those, you better order those on Amazon.

01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:21.500
But yeah, I mean, what they had, were they announcing, was it...

01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:27.500
Didn't they have, like, more Wii? Oh, that's right, that's right.

01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:30.500
They announced that fucking Rayman was coming to the Switch,

01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:34.500
because that launch game from the Wii U, or was it even the Wii?

01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:37.500
I can't remember at this point. I think it was the Wii U.

01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:41.500
That really needs to be on the Switch. That's the system seller right there.

01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:43.500
Not to say it's a bad game, but dude, that game is old.

01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:49.500
Yeah, I mean, it's cool that I guess they're probably trying to add some new coats of paint on it to make it a little more attractive.

01:05:49.500 --> 01:05:50.500
No, they really aren't.

01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:53.500
It's portable now? That's...

01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:55.500
It was portable on the Vita.

01:05:55.500 --> 01:05:58.500
Oh, I didn't even know it was on the Vita. Oh, Sony's still making the Vita?

01:05:58.500 --> 01:06:02.500
Yeah, they are. Some companies know who they are.

01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:03.500
Who's in Japan.

01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:08.500
ActDeftInChat says, Rayman Legends is good, though. Really good. And nobody owns a Vita, Loki.

01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:10.500
They do in Japan.

01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:12.500
I have a PlayStation TV that's somewhere.

01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:15.500
Do you see the thick layer of dust on my Vita, by the way?

01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:17.500
It's in the other room, but it's...

01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:18.500
Several Vitas that you own?

01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:20.500
Yeah, that's right. I have two.

01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:25.500
But the other one is more for collector purposes, because it's a Final Fantasy XIV Vita, and it's pretty sweet.

01:06:25.500 --> 01:06:26.500
Just saying.

01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:28.500
Well, your attach rate's fantastic, then, for Vita's system.

01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:29.500
I know, right?

01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:32.500
Well, the other one's from Japan, so it doesn't really count, because they actually sell Vitas in Japan.

01:06:32.500 --> 01:06:37.500
Yeah, well, the one in the US doesn't really count, because they disavow all knowledge of the Vita.

01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:44.500
Alright. Moving on. Let's talk about Splatoon 2. Splatoon 2 is actually dated now for release.

01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:48.500
They talked about that in the Nintendo Direct, and Splatoon 2 looks awesome. I don't care what Loki says.

01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:51.500
July 21st is the big day for Splatoon 2.

01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:55.500
They actually were showing a little bit more on the Nintendo Direct of this.

01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:57.500
They were showing a new game mode called Salmon Run.

01:06:57.500 --> 01:07:03.500
It's a co-op mode, that's pretty cool, for players against enemy creatures that spread pollution.

01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:10.500
So, yet again, another example of that horde mode, a la Mass Effect, a la what I was just talking about with Overwatch.

01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:11.500
Gears of War.

01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:14.500
Gears of War, obviously, making its way into Splatoon as well.

01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:18.500
That sounds really exciting, actually. I'm really into the co-op stuff.

01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:26.500
So, I think more and more developers are finding out that people really enjoy the co-op multiplayer when they can't get into the competitive multiplayer.

01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:32.500
The other thing I forgot to mention, they have new colored Joy-Cons, so you can get a neon yellow one.

01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:37.500
If you really want neon yellow controllers, just remember they're $80. Thanks, Nintendo.

01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:43.500
And I think that is to celebrate ARMS, which they also showed off in the Nintendo Direct, and they dated that.

01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:52.500
June 16th is the date for ARMS, and they were showing how, you know, with the characters you can kind of, you actually sub in and out the different ARMS, so there's all these different combinations.

01:07:52.500 --> 01:07:53.500
It's neat.

01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:59.500
I gotta be honest, I'm not feeling this the way a lot of my Nintendo fan friends are. I'm not feeling it.

01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:03.500
They're really pushing to make it esports. It's not esports. I'm sorry.

01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:15.500
Well, we'll see. I mean, I don't know. That's for the internet to decide. I'm not feeling this based off the trailers and all that, but I feel like, okay, Rob, you need to give it a chance and play it, but I'll need to play it at somebody else's house.

01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:16.500
But it's four player now.

01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:21.500
That part's cool, too. You know, again, leave it to Nintendo to bring the party modes in.

01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:29.500
I know we joked earlier about porting little tanks to the Switch, and obviously that's a money thing, but do you guys actually own Nintendo Switch? Have you played on that at all?

01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:30.500
No, no, I wish.

01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:38.500
I don't own it. I played it a handful of times. Just played Zelda and then, what's it, the Isaac Rebirth.

01:08:38.500 --> 01:08:39.500
Yeah, Binding of Isaac, yeah.

01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:47.500
Yeah, pretty fun. I mean, I think right now, for me, I would need to see a few more games before I'd go out and get it, but it looks cool.

01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:56.500
Yeah, I'd have to check out Arms. I'm remaining open to the idea, but I'm just like, right now, I'm not feeling it.

01:08:56.500 --> 01:09:04.500
Just a quick recommendation. Please, my God, don't make that thing be the mascot. The announcer with the hand.

01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:05.500
Oh, the little announcer. We'll say Bill.

01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:08.500
That was fucking annoying. Please get rid of that thing.

01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:09.500
I think that's a thing your kids would like.

01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:13.500
No, they do like annoying things, but my God, that's annoying.

01:09:14.500 --> 01:09:21.500
Dude, there is some weird shit on fucking YouTube. Like, my kids watch, well, my youngest one, he watches the YouTube Kids app.

01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:31.500
That is, that goes down some deep rabbit holes of like, what the fuck kind of content are people making out there?

01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:44.500
It's just full of like, those lucky eggs and just all sorts of licensing ripoffs and just nursery rhyme music mashed together and some orgy of what the fuck is that?

01:09:44.500 --> 01:09:52.500
And like, I asked him, I'm like, what the hell is going on right there? Like, what are you watching?

01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:56.500
I worry more about that kind of crap than the actual Minecraft.

01:09:56.500 --> 01:10:00.500
Okay, but I'm sure my mom looked at me watching You Can't Do That on television.

01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:01.500
No.

01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:02.500
When I was younger and was like, what the fuck?

01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:11.500
No, this is content specifically targeted towards kids. And because they know that people like, it's because people like watching unboxing videos.

01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:16.500
And because people like watching unboxing videos, they have these stupid lucky eggs, which are basically things you can buy in the store.

01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:22.500
Like, you can, and they're random and you open it up and they're like, oh, crap, I got Elsa or some shit.

01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:25.500
And people fucking watch hours of that shit.

01:10:26.500 --> 01:10:31.500
What the hell? You are not the only person to tell me that this week. The kids love unboxing videos on YouTube.

01:10:31.500 --> 01:10:40.500
And it's even worse than that because this thing was a simulated lucky egg. It was a fucking, all of it was goddamn animated, like with Spider-Man and fucking Elsa and shit.

01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:47.500
I'm like, none of this makes any goddamn sense. Why is this a thing? Like, what is going on here?

01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:57.500
And then like people talking like, like grown ass adults fucking playing with like toys, like the little kids, like, dude, I know you're a fucking adult.

01:10:57.500 --> 01:11:02.500
I can see your hands. Those are fucking adult hands. You are not a kid playing the toy. This is creepy now.

01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:08.500
It's like, what the fuck is going on? Oh, look at this. I'm going to open this egg. Oh, look, it's blue. It's like, oh my God.

01:11:08.500 --> 01:11:14.500
Okay, but is this just the full realization of your old? Because again, when we were younger, our parents didn't understand.

01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:25.500
It's creepy shit. You think this is bad. Okay, you go and act this. These are kind of spinoffs of this whole genre of people dressing up in really shitty costumes like Spider-Man and Elsa.

01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:33.500
There's a whole bunch of Spider-Man Elsa videos out there where people run around, do weird, like almost borderline pornographic, weird, like innuendo shit.

01:11:33.500 --> 01:11:35.500
Rule 37. Rule 37.

01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:44.500
It's just it's it's a deep, dark hole that that goes into.

01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:50.500
Yes, I get the pun.

01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:53.500
All right, let's move on with another story, Loki.

01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:55.500
All right.

01:11:56.500 --> 01:12:02.500
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Andreati with VoGnetwork.com, use the passphrase STEP.

01:12:02.500 --> 01:12:04.500
So speaking of games coming to the switch.

01:12:04.500 --> 01:12:10.500
Oh, sorry. Rule 34, not 37. Whatever. You know what Rule 37 is? See Rule 34. There it is.

01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:13.500
I've thought Rule 34 is more porn. This is just kind of weird shit.

01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:16.500
Well, okay, but you took it to a pointy place there.

01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:23.500
It wasn't porn. It's innuendo. It's not porn because it's YouTube. I mean, you can't put porn on YouTube.

01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:33.500
Anyways, so apparently there's, according to Epic, there's over 20 Japanese Unreal Engine games coming to the switch that are in development.

01:12:33.500 --> 01:12:42.500
So, yeah, that's pretty awesome. In the course, we don't know which games those are because they didn't mention any fucking titles, but there's at least 20 of them and they're coming to Japan.

01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:48.500
Well, but at least it shows that, yes, people are interested in developing for the switch. It's it's this is not going to be a repeat.

01:12:48.500 --> 01:12:52.500
Right. I don't think it's going to. I think there's tons of people developing games for the switch.

01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:55.500
It's just where are the games? Because they're not out yet.

01:12:55.500 --> 01:13:00.500
And they probably should wait until more of them are ready to be released before releasing the system.

01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:03.500
Well, but the system's doing really well.

01:13:03.500 --> 01:13:07.500
Well, you know what? You know, people will buy a fucking Apple iPhone if it's red.

01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:12.500
So, I mean, I don't have a really high expectation for people.

01:13:12.500 --> 01:13:16.500
First off, you can shut up because I'm actually thinking about getting the red iPhone.

01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:20.500
But because because. No, no, no. Don't you fucking judge me. I'm not finished.

01:13:20.500 --> 01:13:28.500
Because my other iPhone, like the battery is just like, like it drains so fast and just like I just I have an older phone.

01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:31.500
I need to get a newer phone. So I'm like, well, the seven red is the newest thing out there.

01:13:31.500 --> 01:13:36.500
Maybe I'll just get that. I'm really trying to hold off and wait for the eight. I'm really trying to hold off.

01:13:36.500 --> 01:13:40.500
But it's like I got to go till October. I don't know if I can do it.

01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:46.500
And then all these when there is a hot shit new iPhone that's out there on the market, all these phone companies are going to get rid of their unlimited plans.

01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:48.500
Just wait.

01:13:48.500 --> 01:13:52.500
Well, yeah, I mean, I'm looking to upgrade my phone, but everything is out right now.

01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:56.500
It's like, well, this is you know, I can get an S8 because I have an S6 right now.

01:13:56.500 --> 01:14:01.500
And it's like, well, it's sort of better.

01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:03.500
Yeah, actually, I think Alan's looking at getting one of those.

01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:10.500
It's like I just like, eh, I don't really care. I want something that's actually like interesting to buy.

01:14:10.500 --> 01:14:12.500
And none of them are that.

01:14:12.500 --> 01:14:19.500
All right. Well, as much of a hater as Nintendo or as Loki's trying to be on Nintendo, I only hate because I love.

01:14:19.500 --> 01:14:23.500
I know. I know. We've talked about this before. Anyway, here's the thing.

01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:32.500
The Switch is Nintendo's fastest selling console that is confirmed, of course, by Nintendo, that it's their fastest selling console at VAR.

01:14:32.500 --> 01:14:38.500
It has sold over nine hundred and six thousand units since it's come out.

01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:42.500
Even with so many systems that are out there and available, the shipments are not meeting demand.

01:14:42.500 --> 01:14:44.500
Nintendo has acknowledged that.

01:14:44.500 --> 01:14:51.500
They have also said that on April 27th, they will give an update on this because they have to do the fiscal year earnings release.

01:14:51.500 --> 01:14:55.500
But if you were thinking the Switch was going to stall or anything, that's not happening.

01:14:55.500 --> 01:15:01.500
And I think that's probably encouraging more developers to go for the Switch because, yes, that install base is there.

01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:09.500
And I think that the see that's the thing is I think the reason it's sold so well is because I don't think they're actually they are meeting that demand a little bit better than they are.

01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:16.500
Say, you know, the Wii or the Wii U or even when there's more of them on shelves to sell, they sell more.

01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:22.500
Many could have sold, you know, almost a million copies if or, you know, they put out a million copies of it.

01:15:22.500 --> 01:15:28.500
But I mean, I've actually I actually went to Wal-Mart the other day and they have like four systems sitting there.

01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:38.500
I thought about it and then I was like, then I looked at the games that are on the shelf and it literally is like half a shelf, one shelf, half of a shelf dedicated to the Switch.

01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:41.500
I'm like, oh, yeah, that's right. There's no games on the system. I'm not going to buy it.

01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:44.500
I need to get a 3D printer instead.

01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:47.500
It's much cheaper than that too.

01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:51.500
I'll print my own Switch.

01:15:51.500 --> 01:15:54.500
I don't need your fucking system. I'll make my own.

01:15:54.500 --> 01:15:56.500
And it'll play all the games.

01:15:56.500 --> 01:16:00.500
It'll be a horrible amalgamation of like the PlayStation 4.

01:16:00.500 --> 01:16:05.500
It'll look like one of those like Chinese knockoff systems like the V.

01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:09.500
That's fine. I have a Chinese knockoff printer, so it's all good.

01:16:09.500 --> 01:16:10.500
Is it really?

01:16:10.500 --> 01:16:13.500
It's open source. Most of the printers come from China.

01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:21.500
OK. All right. One more story for you guys, then we're going to get Dark Soccer on the phone here to do the classic system of the week.

01:16:21.500 --> 01:16:23.500
All right. So this is kind of cool to throw back here.

01:16:23.500 --> 01:16:38.500
But yes, they are. I guess the former members of the Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium, or MECC, are looking to develop a new piece of educational software.

01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:44.500
Now, you may not know who the MECC is, but you probably do know what the Oregon Trail is.

01:16:44.500 --> 01:16:47.500
So they're coming back to make a new game.

01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:54.500
And I guess they're planning on raising half a million dollars in funding to go towards that.

01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:56.500
I wonder what they're going to make their game.

01:16:56.500 --> 01:16:59.500
Number Munchers Extreme. Let's pray.

01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:01.500
Because that was also MECC.

01:17:01.500 --> 01:17:08.500
All those games you played, at least I did in grade school, MECC did all that stuff.

01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:10.500
Was that like Math Blasters? Was that one of them?

01:17:10.500 --> 01:17:12.500
I don't know if MECC did Math Blasters, actually.

01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:15.500
So what they're developing, actually, a little bit more information on this.

01:17:15.500 --> 01:17:21.500
So what they're developing is a thing called, it's Real Experiences at Life.

01:17:21.500 --> 01:17:25.500
So R-E-at-L is Real Experiences at Life.

01:17:25.500 --> 01:17:32.500
And it focuses, I guess they're saying, on STEM studies, including forensics, vehicle traffic flow, and invasive species.

01:17:32.500 --> 01:17:35.500
That sounds a little bit more detailed than the Oregon Trail.

01:17:35.500 --> 01:17:39.500
You're going to die of something a lot more complicated than dysentery in this game.

01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:41.500
An evolved species has murdered you.

01:17:41.500 --> 01:17:48.500
But yeah, they're saying it's going to be like a web portal, various ways of study, including streaming, classroom elements, and stuff like that.

01:17:48.500 --> 01:17:54.500
So it sounds more like an educational system versus forging the river.

01:17:54.500 --> 01:17:58.500
Bring back the traggles or get the fuck out, MECC.

01:17:58.500 --> 01:18:03.500
Are the traggles going to be your little mascot for this thing? Otherwise, no one car.

01:18:03.500 --> 01:18:06.500
They should do like the Oregon Trail, but just in modern times.

01:18:06.500 --> 01:18:08.500
Without zombies, because that's already been done.

01:18:08.500 --> 01:18:13.500
Let's see, sj100matt in chat says, Odell Lake, like Odell Lake.

01:18:13.500 --> 01:18:14.500
Let's see.

01:18:14.500 --> 01:18:16.500
Oh yeah, Odell Lake. I forgot all about that.

01:18:16.500 --> 01:18:19.500
Dungeon Buster suggests you have died from a brain parasite.

01:18:19.500 --> 01:18:24.500
And Dark Tetsuya does confirm the blaster games were someone else, at least according to Wikipedia.

01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:27.500
Well, you know, Wikipedia knows everything, right? So there it is.

01:18:27.500 --> 01:18:32.500
But it very well could have been an MECC game. I don't even know who made those games.

01:18:32.500 --> 01:18:38.500
Anyway, speaking of classic games, we are going to get our lovely Jamie Summers,

01:18:38.500 --> 01:18:42.500
Dark Soccer, here on the line right now to walk us through her regular segment

01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:45.500
called the Classic System of the Week.

01:18:45.500 --> 01:18:46.500
Greetings.

01:18:46.500 --> 01:18:47.500
Hi, how are you?

01:18:47.500 --> 01:18:49.500
I'm alright.

01:18:49.500 --> 01:18:51.500
Sorry you couldn't be here.

01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:54.500
I was just going to say sorry you couldn't be here tonight.

01:18:54.500 --> 01:18:56.500
Hi, can you hear me okay?

01:18:56.500 --> 01:18:58.500
Yeah, it's fine now.

01:18:58.500 --> 01:18:59.500
The joys of live radio, what can I say?

01:18:59.500 --> 01:19:03.500
Sorry you couldn't be here in studio tonight. I hope everything's okay. Back at home.

01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:04.500
Yeah.

01:19:04.500 --> 01:19:05.500
Alright.

01:19:05.500 --> 01:19:09.500
Yes. Everything's okay. It's just...

01:19:09.500 --> 01:19:15.500
Well, you're missing a conversation where we're talking with the creators of Lil' Tanks

01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:20.500
and you could have been talking about blowing shit up with tanks this week, but, you know, I understand.

01:19:20.500 --> 01:19:22.500
Things happen.

01:19:22.500 --> 01:19:23.500
Tanks are awesome.

01:19:23.500 --> 01:19:24.500
They are awesome.

01:19:24.500 --> 01:19:26.500
Alright, you know what else is awesome is that every week here on the show,

01:19:26.500 --> 01:19:32.500
DarkSakura takes us on a trip down memory lane with a segment we call the Classic Game of the Week,

01:19:32.500 --> 01:19:35.500
but new and improved in the year 2017.

01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:40.500
Once a month, she likes to say, you know what, the games just aren't enough.

01:19:40.500 --> 01:19:44.500
You need to bow down at this Classic System of the Week.

01:19:44.500 --> 01:19:48.500
DarkSakura, what is the Classic System of the Month?

01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:52.500
The Classic System is the MSX.

01:19:52.500 --> 01:19:54.500
Good choice.

01:19:55.500 --> 01:20:02.500
Basically, the MSX, it was first released in 1983 by Microsoft.

01:20:02.500 --> 01:20:16.500
It was marketed initially in Japan by the director of, sorry, the vice president of Microsoft Japan at the time, Kazuhiko Nishii.

01:20:16.500 --> 01:20:21.500
It was basically meant to just help improve, you know, home computing at the time.

01:20:21.500 --> 01:20:24.500
It really was popular in Japan.

01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:31.500
It did spread across some other countries, but there were very few that were sold in the US,

01:20:31.500 --> 01:20:38.500
and this pretty much was the gaming system to have, well, apart from just being a computer,

01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:41.500
before the Nintendo came out, or the Famicom,

01:20:41.500 --> 01:20:49.500
and it is where a lot of series actually began their life, like the Metal Gear series for one thing.

01:20:49.500 --> 01:20:53.500
It was really well supported by Konami and Hudson.

01:20:53.500 --> 01:20:58.500
So, people don't really know exactly what MSX stands for.

01:20:58.500 --> 01:21:04.500
A lot of people think that it's standard for Microsoft Extended, which was the operating system that came with it.

01:21:04.500 --> 01:21:11.500
It was Microsoft Extended Basic, and there were some that said machines with software exchangeability,

01:21:11.500 --> 01:21:14.500
or that it was even named after the MS Metal.

01:21:14.500 --> 01:21:21.500
So, most of the computers in the early 80s were manufactured in Japan.

01:21:21.500 --> 01:21:29.500
There was the NEC PC-6001 and the PC-8000 series, Fujitsu's FM series,

01:21:29.500 --> 01:21:37.500
which I had mentioned when talking about the Marty, and Hitachi did them.

01:21:37.500 --> 01:21:39.500
They were all over the place.

01:21:39.500 --> 01:21:45.500
And then we also had Panasonic, Canon, Casio, Yamaha, Sanyo were ones all trying to get in it.

01:21:45.500 --> 01:21:52.500
So, basically the MSX was an attempt to make a single industry standard for home computers.

01:21:52.500 --> 01:22:01.500
Kind of like how VHS was standard for video, even though Sony really wanted the Betamax to be the thing.

01:22:01.500 --> 01:22:07.500
So, a lot of different electronic manufacturers really helped promote the MSX.

01:22:07.500 --> 01:22:11.500
They had Philips, Spectre Video, Goldstar behind them.

01:22:11.500 --> 01:22:22.500
And the big thing too is that it really was, it had a few things that really took it above some of the other systems.

01:22:22.500 --> 01:22:25.500
It really was made from off-the-shelf parts.

01:22:25.500 --> 01:22:32.500
The CPU was a 3.58 MHz Zilog Z80.

01:22:32.500 --> 01:22:42.500
It had the Texas Instruments graphics chip, 16K of VRAM, which back then, that was pretty awesome.

01:22:42.500 --> 01:22:53.500
And then there were just so many things that made it supposed to be more affordable and easier to access a computer.

01:22:53.500 --> 01:22:59.500
They basically, instead of the big crazy competition that we were having over here,

01:22:59.500 --> 01:23:07.500
like what was going on between the Commodore items and, you know, we had Coleco in the game and a few other things at the time,

01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:11.500
it basically didn't really have much of a rival there.

01:23:11.500 --> 01:23:17.500
There were different manufacturers of the MSX computer.

01:23:17.500 --> 01:23:23.500
Yamaha had been one, Canon did their own.

01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:28.500
So, it was fairly easy to adopt it and have games that would work on it.

01:23:28.500 --> 01:23:32.500
So, I'm going to skip past a little bit more of the technical side of it.

01:23:32.500 --> 01:23:36.500
There were other iterations of the MSX computer that came out over time.

01:23:36.500 --> 01:23:49.500
They had, the MSX-1 actually had a joystick port, or you could use the arrow keys and spacebar for controlling games.

01:23:49.500 --> 01:23:51.500
There were things like that.

01:23:52.500 --> 01:24:05.500
As far as the other versions that came out, there was the MSX in 83, the MSX-2 in 85, MSX-2 Plus in 88, and the MSX Turbo R in 90.

01:24:05.500 --> 01:24:11.500
After a while though, there were some revivals as well.

01:24:11.500 --> 01:24:23.500
In 2001, Nishi, the original promoter of the system, brought about this MSX revival around an emulator called the MSX Player.

01:24:23.500 --> 01:24:32.500
And it is the only official MSX emulator that's out there right now that is maintained by the MSX Association.

01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:35.500
There were a few other ones out there.

01:24:35.500 --> 01:24:41.500
It did have releases in other countries, so there's a European version of it.

01:24:41.500 --> 01:24:47.500
I think it was supposed to have been big, like in some of the South American countries as well.

01:24:47.500 --> 01:24:52.500
And then, in 2001, there was another revival.

01:24:52.500 --> 01:25:02.500
There's an MSX kit called GreatBit, G-R-8-B-I-T, that was a DIY computer, and it was licensed by MSX.

01:25:02.500 --> 01:25:09.500
It's like a $500 kit, and you can put together a working MSX-2 compatible computer.

01:25:09.500 --> 01:25:15.500
Except that it doesn't have chassis power supply, floppy disks, all the rest of it.

01:25:15.500 --> 01:25:19.500
Maybe Loki could print one with his new 3D printer.

01:25:19.500 --> 01:25:23.500
Maybe Loki could print one with his new 3D printer.

01:25:23.500 --> 01:25:29.500
Possibly, possibly. Really what you're buying is the processing parts of it.

01:25:29.500 --> 01:25:33.500
At least we could have an MSX in the US, because that's the thing that always blew my mind,

01:25:33.500 --> 01:25:37.500
is why we never really had it here like we had the other stuff. But anyway, I digress.

01:25:37.500 --> 01:25:42.500
They tried. It just didn't catch on. They had to deal with Commodore.

01:25:42.500 --> 01:25:49.500
But there also is another MSX, I don't know that it's official,

01:25:49.500 --> 01:25:55.500
but there were some people in a Korean forum who made a...

01:25:55.500 --> 01:26:07.500
It's called the Mini IQ 3000 QT, that's basically a version of the IQ 2000,

01:26:07.500 --> 01:26:10.500
which was the MSX-2 made in Japan by Daewoo.

01:26:10.500 --> 01:26:16.500
It had some different goodies in it, but I don't think that it's actually officially licensed.

01:26:16.500 --> 01:26:24.500
So, moving on into what we have to think for having come out originally on the MSX is...

01:26:24.500 --> 01:26:28.500
I'm just going to go over quite a few series.

01:26:28.500 --> 01:26:34.500
We had the ones that originated on MSX were Alastin Xanax,

01:26:35.500 --> 01:26:37.500
Bomberan,

01:26:37.500 --> 01:26:39.500
Penguin Adventure,

01:26:39.500 --> 01:26:40.500

01:26:40.500 --> 01:26:41.500
Metal Gear,

01:26:41.500 --> 01:26:42.500
Herodias,

01:26:42.500 --> 01:26:43.500
and Puyo Puyo,

01:26:43.500 --> 01:26:46.500
which you know me, I love my Puyo Puyo.

01:26:46.500 --> 01:26:53.500
Others that had some version of them on the MSX,

01:26:53.500 --> 01:26:58.500
a few of them being unique to the system for the version that they got,

01:26:58.500 --> 01:27:01.500
there was Castlevania came out as Vampire Killer,

01:27:01.500 --> 01:27:05.500
we had Contra, Dragon Quest, Dragon Slayer, Final Fantasy,

01:27:05.500 --> 01:27:07.500
Gradius,

01:27:07.500 --> 01:27:08.500
R-Type,

01:27:08.500 --> 01:27:09.500
Wizardry,

01:27:09.500 --> 01:27:10.500
Zack,

01:27:10.500 --> 01:27:11.500
Xavius,

01:27:11.500 --> 01:27:13.500
and Ys.

01:27:13.500 --> 01:27:18.500
So, and like I said, there were a lot of companies that manufactured it.

01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:21.500
Just the original MSX, to go over the list,

01:27:21.500 --> 01:27:23.500
there was Spectrum Video,

01:27:23.500 --> 01:27:24.500
Phillips,

01:27:24.500 --> 01:27:25.500

Yamaha,

01:27:35.500 --> 01:27:36.500
JDC,

01:27:36.500 --> 01:27:37.500
Yashica,

01:27:37.500 --> 01:27:38.500
Kyocera,

01:27:38.500 --> 01:27:39.500
Gold Star,

01:27:39.500 --> 01:27:40.500
Samsung,

01:27:40.500 --> 01:27:41.500
Daewoo,

01:27:41.500 --> 01:27:42.500

01:27:42.500 --> 01:27:43.500
Sharp,

01:27:43.500 --> 01:27:44.500
and Palette.

01:27:44.500 --> 01:27:47.500
Quite a few less for the MSX too.

01:27:47.500 --> 01:27:51.500
So, but there you go, that's the MSX.

01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:55.500
All right, there it is, your classic system of the week,

01:27:55.500 --> 01:27:57.500
the MSX.

01:27:57.500 --> 01:28:00.500
It's one of those systems where it's like, sadly,

01:28:00.500 --> 01:28:02.500
we just didn't really get to experience it here.

01:28:02.500 --> 01:28:05.500
I mean, I guess they tried it, didn't catch on or whatever,

01:28:05.500 --> 01:28:07.500
but yeah, it's one of those things where it's like,

01:28:07.500 --> 01:28:10.500
there's a lot of things worth looking at on this system.

01:28:10.500 --> 01:28:13.500
You know, especially like the actual sequel to Metal Gear,

01:28:13.500 --> 01:28:16.500
not the one we got on the NES here, was an MSX game.

01:28:16.500 --> 01:28:20.500
And I guess they did end up redoing that in one of those collections

01:28:20.500 --> 01:28:21.500
on PS2 or PS3.

01:28:21.500 --> 01:28:23.500
I don't even remember now, right?

01:28:23.500 --> 01:28:25.500
Well, yeah, they have.

01:28:25.500 --> 01:28:28.500
And you know what else came out on MSX?

01:28:28.500 --> 01:28:29.500
Hm?

01:28:29.500 --> 01:28:30.500
Gartic.

01:28:30.500 --> 01:28:32.500
That's right.

01:28:32.500 --> 01:28:33.500
That's right.

01:28:33.500 --> 01:28:34.500
And that's the whole reason.

01:28:34.500 --> 01:28:37.500
You know what else that came out on?

01:28:37.500 --> 01:28:38.500
What?

01:28:38.500 --> 01:28:43.500
It came out on iOS.

01:28:43.500 --> 01:28:45.500
What came out on iOS?

01:28:45.500 --> 01:28:46.500
Gartic.

01:28:46.500 --> 01:28:48.500
It's on iOS?

01:28:48.500 --> 01:28:49.500
Yep.

01:28:49.500 --> 01:28:50.500
Oh, I had no idea.

01:28:50.500 --> 01:28:51.500
I needed to check that out.

01:28:51.500 --> 01:28:54.500
That's awesome.

01:28:54.500 --> 01:28:57.500
At least the dream of the Guardian Legend is still alive somewhere.

01:28:57.500 --> 01:28:58.500
That's for sure.

01:28:58.500 --> 01:29:01.500
Dartitzy is confirming that the MSX Metal Gear was in.

01:29:01.500 --> 01:29:03.500
Metal Gear Solid 3 Subs...

01:29:03.500 --> 01:29:04.500
Subs...

01:29:04.500 --> 01:29:06.500
I can never say that word.

01:29:06.500 --> 01:29:08.500
The deluxe package that was on the PS2.

01:29:08.500 --> 01:29:10.500
Yeah, I thought it went a ways back there.

01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:12.500
So there you have it.

01:29:12.500 --> 01:29:13.500
All right.

01:29:13.500 --> 01:29:14.500
Yeah.

01:29:14.500 --> 01:29:16.500
Well, Dark Sakura, anything else you want to say to the listeners

01:29:16.500 --> 01:29:18.500
before we head out to break tonight?

01:29:18.500 --> 01:29:19.500
Resist.

01:29:19.500 --> 01:29:20.500
All right.

01:29:20.500 --> 01:29:21.500
Have a good one, Dark Sakura.

01:29:21.500 --> 01:29:22.500
Thank you for being here.

01:29:22.500 --> 01:29:23.500
I'll try.

01:29:23.500 --> 01:29:24.500
Bye-bye.

01:29:24.500 --> 01:29:25.500
Bye.

01:29:25.500 --> 01:29:26.500
All right.

01:29:26.500 --> 01:29:27.500
There it is.

01:29:27.500 --> 01:29:29.500
Your classic system of the month.

01:29:29.500 --> 01:29:31.500
We are about to head out to a break here.

01:29:31.500 --> 01:29:34.500
But before we do that, I understand our guests here in studio

01:29:34.500 --> 01:29:35.500
are going to head out.

01:29:35.500 --> 01:29:37.500
But we want to thank you guys for being here.

01:29:37.500 --> 01:29:40.500
Again, the game is Little Tanks from Lead Money Games.

01:29:40.500 --> 01:29:42.500
And congrats again on the release.

01:29:42.500 --> 01:29:46.500
And best of luck with the coming weeks and months of patches

01:29:46.500 --> 01:29:48.500
and whatever you guys choose to do next.

01:29:48.500 --> 01:29:49.500
Yeah.

01:29:49.500 --> 01:29:50.500
Thanks a lot for having us.

01:29:50.500 --> 01:29:51.500
Thank you so much.

01:29:51.500 --> 01:29:52.500
No problem.

01:29:52.500 --> 01:29:53.500
Good luck.

01:29:53.500 --> 01:29:55.500
I hope it helps get the word out a little bit there.

01:29:55.500 --> 01:29:57.500
Definitely take your game out there to different shows, expos.

01:29:57.500 --> 01:29:59.500
I think it's one of those things where more people get their hands on it.

01:29:59.500 --> 01:30:01.500
You know, they'll be able to, you know,

01:30:01.500 --> 01:30:03.500
oh, yeah, I got to download that game when I get home on Steam.

01:30:03.500 --> 01:30:05.500
So good luck with the IndieCade submission and all that stuff.

01:30:05.500 --> 01:30:06.500
Thanks.

01:30:06.500 --> 01:30:07.500
You're welcome.

01:30:07.500 --> 01:30:08.500
All right.

01:30:08.500 --> 01:30:09.500
Thanks for being here, especially live.

01:30:09.500 --> 01:30:10.500
A lot of people don't come here live.

01:30:10.500 --> 01:30:12.500
And I know you came in from the Bay Area on a holiday nonetheless.

01:30:12.500 --> 01:30:13.500
So we really appreciate it.

01:30:13.500 --> 01:30:14.500
Yeah.

01:30:14.500 --> 01:30:15.500
All right.

01:30:15.500 --> 01:30:19.500
We're going to go to a quick break, though, here at the Voice Geeks Network.

01:30:19.500 --> 01:30:22.500
When we come back, there is plenty more of a show to come,

01:30:22.500 --> 01:30:24.500
including some more information on Minecraft,

01:30:24.500 --> 01:30:26.500
Skype releasing on the Xbox One,

01:30:26.500 --> 01:30:31.500
and some interesting regulations in Germany for live streamers.

01:30:31.500 --> 01:30:32.500
Yeah, check that out.

01:30:32.500 --> 01:30:36.500
Will we return with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this?

01:30:36.500 --> 01:30:42.500
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:30:42.500 --> 01:30:44.500
Live tonight, episode number 683.

01:30:44.500 --> 01:30:48.500
For this April the 16th of 2017, the second half of our show,

01:30:48.500 --> 01:30:50.500
live at vognetwork.com.

01:30:50.500 --> 01:30:52.500
Just Loki and I left in the studio.

01:30:52.500 --> 01:30:55.500
Our pals from Lead Money Games have taken off, heading back home.

01:30:55.500 --> 01:30:57.500
We learned all about their game, Lil' Tanks,

01:30:57.500 --> 01:30:59.500
which you can listen back to if you're just joining us tonight.

01:30:59.500 --> 01:31:01.500
You can hear that on the podcast feed,

01:31:01.500 --> 01:31:03.500
which should be on our YouTube channel.

01:31:03.500 --> 01:31:05.500
Did you buy it during the show? Oh, good.

01:31:05.500 --> 01:31:06.500
It does look interesting.

01:31:06.500 --> 01:31:09.500
I like the idea of the whole kind of RPG elements in an arcade game.

01:31:09.500 --> 01:31:10.500
I think that's pretty cool.

01:31:10.500 --> 01:31:11.500
Yeah, yeah, I like that.

01:31:11.500 --> 01:31:13.500
I'm about to steal ideas.

01:31:13.500 --> 01:31:15.500
You mean be inspired by it?

01:31:15.500 --> 01:31:16.500
Inspired, yes, right.

01:31:16.500 --> 01:31:17.500
Not steal.

01:31:17.500 --> 01:31:19.500
There's no stealing in games.

01:31:19.500 --> 01:31:20.500
Not really.

01:31:20.500 --> 01:31:23.500
And Loki is trying to convince me to make this programming thing happen.

01:31:23.500 --> 01:31:26.500
I was trying to throw some ideas out there during the break.

01:31:26.500 --> 01:31:27.500
I stole it.

01:31:27.500 --> 01:31:28.500
We can do it.

01:31:28.500 --> 01:31:29.500
We can do it.

01:31:29.500 --> 01:31:30.500
We can do it.

01:31:30.500 --> 01:31:32.500
I was trying to throw some ideas out there during the break.

01:31:32.500 --> 01:31:33.500
I stole it.

01:31:33.500 --> 01:31:34.500
We could do that.

01:31:34.500 --> 01:31:35.500
I mean, that's fine.

01:31:35.500 --> 01:31:38.500
I guess the idea I had exists somewhere, so I don't want to.

01:31:38.500 --> 01:31:39.500
I'm sure every game exists.

01:31:39.500 --> 01:31:40.500
Does it?

01:31:40.500 --> 01:31:42.500
Let's just rip off a 2,600 game.

01:31:42.500 --> 01:31:46.500
Let's just take a 2,600 game and make it porn, and that'll be the game.

01:31:46.500 --> 01:31:48.500
2,600 game and make it porn?

01:31:48.500 --> 01:31:51.500
Yeah, take a 2,600 game and make it porn.

01:31:51.500 --> 01:31:52.500
Oh.

01:31:52.500 --> 01:31:55.500
Everybody loves porn or ultra-violent.

01:31:55.500 --> 01:31:56.500
I like ultra-violent.

01:31:56.500 --> 01:31:58.500
Okay, we can do ultra-violent.

01:31:58.500 --> 01:31:59.500
What's an ultra-friendly?

01:31:59.500 --> 01:32:00.500
Combat.

01:32:00.500 --> 01:32:01.500
Everybody's played combat.

01:32:01.500 --> 01:32:02.500
There you go.

01:32:02.500 --> 01:32:03.500
We'll make an ultra-violent combat game.

01:32:03.500 --> 01:32:05.500
We're going to make combat, but it's ultra-violent.

01:32:05.500 --> 01:32:07.500
I like it.

01:32:07.500 --> 01:32:12.500
When the little tanks shoot each other, when one tank explodes, it sets on fire.

01:32:12.500 --> 01:32:13.500
People start screaming.

01:32:13.500 --> 01:32:14.500
It'll be awesome.

01:32:14.500 --> 01:32:15.500
Right, Loki?

01:32:15.500 --> 01:32:16.500
All right.

01:32:16.500 --> 01:32:17.500
Let's do it.

01:32:17.500 --> 01:32:19.500
I'll start working on mocking something up.

01:32:19.500 --> 01:32:20.500
All right.

01:32:20.500 --> 01:32:21.500
Sounds good.

01:32:21.500 --> 01:32:24.500
Look, I'm with JD in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:32:24.500 --> 01:32:25.500
Usually, I would agree.

01:32:25.500 --> 01:32:26.500
Porn is better than ultra-violent.

01:32:27.500 --> 01:32:30.500
You guys know I hate shit like the Saw movies and all that stuff.

01:32:30.500 --> 01:32:32.500
But it's hard making a porn combat game.

01:32:32.500 --> 01:32:34.500
It's hard making a porn combat game.

01:32:34.500 --> 01:32:37.500
We could do that, and that might be inappropriate, but yeah.

01:32:37.500 --> 01:32:40.500
When ultra-violence is over the top, then it's funny.

01:32:40.500 --> 01:32:43.500
When it's like the itchy and scratchy show, I can deal with that.

01:32:43.500 --> 01:32:45.500
That's what I mean when I say ultra-violent.

01:32:45.500 --> 01:32:48.500
Or the Happy Tree Friends, which apparently is on Netflix now.

01:32:48.500 --> 01:32:49.500
Did you know that?

01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:50.500
No, I did not.

01:32:50.500 --> 01:32:52.500
I was looking through Netflix the other night, and there it is.

01:32:52.500 --> 01:32:54.500
I'm like, that shit is like 10 years old.

01:32:54.500 --> 01:32:56.500
I saw that Sausage Fest was on Netflix.

01:32:56.500 --> 01:32:57.500
Yes.

01:32:57.500 --> 01:32:59.500
So I noticed that.

01:32:59.500 --> 01:33:06.500
And also, was it, it was a, I forget the, I got the subtitle too.

01:33:06.500 --> 01:33:08.500
I can't remember what the beginning is.

01:33:08.500 --> 01:33:11.500
It's, I think it's like Kimbo and the Two Strings or something like that.

01:33:11.500 --> 01:33:12.500
It was really good.

01:33:12.500 --> 01:33:13.500
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:33:13.500 --> 01:33:17.500
JD in chat says genital jousting did a pretty good porn combat game.

01:33:17.500 --> 01:33:20.500
Yeah, it was kind of stupid looking though.

01:33:20.500 --> 01:33:23.500
But yes, it does, it is quite graphic.

01:33:23.500 --> 01:33:26.500
I don't know how you make genital jousting look elegant, but all right.

01:33:26.500 --> 01:33:27.500
Anyway.

01:33:27.500 --> 01:33:32.500
Because they basically had penises, but the penises had asses on them as well.

01:33:32.500 --> 01:33:37.500
I don't remember the point of the game, but I just know that you're supposed to stick your penis into another penis's ass.

01:33:37.500 --> 01:33:39.500
Well, that happens sometimes.

01:33:39.500 --> 01:33:41.500
Which is weird.

01:33:41.500 --> 01:33:43.500
Moving on.

01:33:43.500 --> 01:33:47.500
Let's get into some rapid fire news, Loki.

01:33:47.500 --> 01:33:49.500
Yes, so.

01:33:50.500 --> 01:33:51.500
This is kind of cool.

01:33:51.500 --> 01:33:54.500
Race the Sun is a game that's been out for a while now.

01:33:54.500 --> 01:33:57.500
And they're going to be adding PlayStation VR support.

01:33:57.500 --> 01:33:59.500
A new mode and some other stuff.

01:33:59.500 --> 01:34:01.500
And it's all going to be a free update.

01:34:01.500 --> 01:34:03.500
And it's coming out in a couple days.

01:34:03.500 --> 01:34:07.500
April 18th, it's going to be adding the PlayStation VR headset mode.

01:34:07.500 --> 01:34:08.500
Relaxing.

01:34:08.500 --> 01:34:11.500
There's a new game mode called Sunrise.

01:34:11.500 --> 01:34:17.500
And I guess with that one, there's no high score or progressive.

01:34:17.500 --> 01:34:21.500
I guess there's no high score to chase or progressive difficulty.

01:34:21.500 --> 01:34:23.500
So you just keep going?

01:34:23.500 --> 01:34:26.500
I mean, I don't really know what the point is then.

01:34:26.500 --> 01:34:27.500
I don't know. We'll see.

01:34:27.500 --> 01:34:28.500
But yeah.

01:34:28.500 --> 01:34:33.500
I like Race the Sun and like VR, so it sounds good.

01:34:33.500 --> 01:34:37.500
Now this, of course, when I saw this, I immediately thought of Rob.

01:34:37.500 --> 01:34:43.500
There's this new game mode being added to Grand Theft Auto Online called Land Grab.

01:34:43.500 --> 01:34:45.500
Now it doesn't sound that interesting.

01:34:45.500 --> 01:34:53.500
However, it basically involves four teams fighting in neon colored cyberspace for territory.

01:34:53.500 --> 01:34:55.500
So it's basically Tron.

01:34:55.500 --> 01:35:02.500
And I guess there's a whole double XP thing that they're doing right now.

01:35:02.500 --> 01:35:10.500
You're going to earn double cash and RP rewards between now and April 24th.

01:35:11.500 --> 01:35:16.500
So I really do need to go back to play Grand Theft Auto 5 and online.

01:35:16.500 --> 01:35:18.500
I've been off of that for a while.

01:35:18.500 --> 01:35:21.500
Didn't Saints Row kind of try to do the online Tron thing already?

01:35:21.500 --> 01:35:24.500
They did. They really...

01:35:24.500 --> 01:35:30.500
I mean, they didn't three for a little section and that was alright and it was silly.

01:35:30.500 --> 01:35:37.500
And then they went full bore into fucking four and it was just too much.

01:35:37.500 --> 01:35:40.500
I still need to play the Goat Simulator sci-fi expansion.

01:35:40.500 --> 01:35:42.500
Yeah, that looks funny.

01:35:42.500 --> 01:35:52.500
I mean, Saints Row 4, I really dog on this.

01:35:52.500 --> 01:35:59.500
Saints Row 4, if you've played Saints Row 3 enough, you realize how much of a reskin that game just is.

01:35:59.500 --> 01:36:03.500
It's just the same shit all over again.

01:36:03.500 --> 01:36:09.500
And whereas Saints Row 1 and 2, the different side missions, things they did that were ridiculous,

01:36:09.500 --> 01:36:13.500
but they kind of had a little bit of a story that made it seem like it was more of like,

01:36:13.500 --> 01:36:19.500
okay, this is why I'm this. It's silly doing the insurance fraud, but I'm getting money because this guy said,

01:36:19.500 --> 01:36:23.500
oh yeah, I need some more clients and go make me money this way.

01:36:23.500 --> 01:36:25.500
And that was cool.

01:36:25.500 --> 01:36:32.500
But in Saints Row 3 and 4, it was just like, this is just a side mission, do it.

01:36:32.500 --> 01:36:38.500
Well, at least instead of doing like Saints Row 5, they're going this direction with the agents of mayhem

01:36:38.500 --> 01:36:43.500
and kind of trying something new. So maybe this will be a good kind of palate cleanser for, you know, volition.

01:36:43.500 --> 01:36:49.500
I'm very disappointed. I do want a new Saints Row game. Just not like this. Not like this.

01:36:49.500 --> 01:36:55.500
All right. Moving on to some other rapid fire news. Nintendo is doing some online maintenance.

01:36:55.500 --> 01:37:00.500
That's right. They need to bring the servers down so they can launch their new online program.

01:37:00.500 --> 01:37:04.500
Just kidding. I made that up. We don't know when they're ever going to launch their online program,

01:37:04.500 --> 01:37:09.500
but the reality is the servers are coming down. So, you know, if you're playing games on the Switch,

01:37:09.500 --> 01:37:14.500
which you could be playing fast RMX or Bomberman or something on the Switch,

01:37:14.500 --> 01:37:21.500
the servers will be coming down on Monday, April 17th for two hours at 5 p.m. Pacific,

01:37:21.500 --> 01:37:26.500
which is so weird that it's right in the middle of the freaking day. But to be fair, it is midnight Greenwich time.

01:37:26.500 --> 01:37:31.500
So, you know, that's I guess you're going to piss off some time zone one way or another.

01:37:31.500 --> 01:37:36.500
I was speaking of pissing people off in Nintendo. We were talking earlier about the NES classic production stuff

01:37:36.500 --> 01:37:43.500
and how they're also ending the Famicom one as well. Yeah. They're not ending that permanently.

01:37:43.500 --> 01:37:50.500
You know, I know we said temporary. Yes. So that kind of brings back the whole, you know, that they're revising the thing.

01:37:50.500 --> 01:37:55.500
I'm sure. I'm sure. Yeah, no, no. I'd mentioned that they had only said temporary and that that's leaving the door open more

01:37:55.500 --> 01:38:04.500
to a 2.0. I'm sure. We'll see. Time will tell. Anyway, moving on to Wednesday, April 19th is the second offline.

01:38:04.500 --> 01:38:11.500
That is all of it. All the services will be coming offline for an hour and 45 minutes at 645 p.m.

01:38:11.500 --> 01:38:17.500
Hour time Pacific time. That's 945 on the East Coast or 145 in the morning in GMT.

01:38:17.500 --> 01:38:22.500
So that's online play and rankings and all that on the 3DS, the Wii U and the Switch.

01:38:22.500 --> 01:38:27.500
That is so they can pull the plug permanently on the Wii U. Just kidding. I made that up, too.

01:38:27.500 --> 01:38:32.500
I need to stop making up news. Sorry, guys. I just they don't ever say why they're doing this besides maintenance.

01:38:32.500 --> 01:38:40.500
But maintenance isn't that exciting, is it? Well, as we mentioned earlier in the show, Star Wars Battlefront 2 has been officially unveiled.

01:38:40.500 --> 01:38:44.500
They are doing the big Star Wars Fan Expo in Orlando right now or just wrapped up today.

01:38:44.500 --> 01:38:49.500
I had some friends that went. I'm a little hatefully jealous of that. Did you watch the new trailer, by the way?

01:38:49.500 --> 01:38:56.500
I know the whole Internet's talking about it, which really I mean, it was cool and all, but it didn't really show shit.

01:38:56.500 --> 01:39:00.500
Good. I'm glad that's what a teaser is supposed to do, I suppose, is just tease a little bit.

01:39:00.500 --> 01:39:05.500
I don't want them to give away all the endings because people are going to analyze that shit.

01:39:05.500 --> 01:39:10.500
That's how they get the four hour YouTube analysis about the 30 second teaser about.

01:39:10.500 --> 01:39:16.500
Well, since we saw this in one screenshot, it must mean that so we saw Poe Dameron with BB-8.

01:39:16.500 --> 01:39:20.500
So this must mean it's just, you know, stop, stop, stop overanalyzing.

01:39:20.500 --> 01:39:24.500
Yeah, after I watched that, then I watched the new Transformers trailer and I'm like, what the fuck happened to that series?

01:39:24.500 --> 01:39:28.500
Like, I don't even know what the hell's going on now. Who knows?

01:39:28.500 --> 01:39:34.500
All right. Anyway, so also, of course, we have Star Wars Battlefront 2, as we were mentioning earlier in the show.

01:39:34.500 --> 01:39:38.500
They did show a video, so there's a trailer out there you guys can watch if you haven't seen it yet.

01:39:38.500 --> 01:39:44.500
But it also shows the campaign mode. You're going to get to play as a member of an Imperial Special Forces unit.

01:39:44.500 --> 01:39:47.500
DICE, Motive, Criterion are all working on this game.

01:39:47.500 --> 01:39:53.500
You're going to get to play as heroes from the upcoming The Last Jedi film if you actually preorder.

01:39:53.500 --> 01:39:58.500
There's not a lot of extra information besides that just now.

01:39:58.500 --> 01:40:02.500
It will be released later this year. PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:40:02.500 --> 01:40:07.500
So PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 have been cut out of the picture.

01:40:07.500 --> 01:40:10.500
Although actually, I don't think that those systems had Battlefront 1, did they?

01:40:10.500 --> 01:40:12.500
I don't think they did. I can't remember.

01:40:12.500 --> 01:40:15.500
But I mean, of course, it makes sense that we've moved on from those systems now.

01:40:15.500 --> 01:40:17.500
So it's PC, PS4 and Xbox One.

01:40:17.500 --> 01:40:22.500
But it's going to be nice that we're going to have a single-player mode in this will be really nice, for one.

01:40:22.500 --> 01:40:30.500
And then also the fact they've come out and said that there's not going to be any season pass for this, which is nice as well.

01:40:30.500 --> 01:40:31.500
Allegedly.

01:40:31.500 --> 01:40:35.500
Allegedly. That doesn't mean they won't do DLC, but they're not going to do any season pass.

01:40:35.500 --> 01:40:38.500
We'll see. I'll be curious to see what develops with that.

01:40:38.500 --> 01:40:41.500
I'm sure we will hear more about it at E3.

01:40:41.500 --> 01:40:47.500
So, in the meantime, let's move on to what is coming out in stores this week, Loki.

01:40:47.500 --> 01:40:55.500
Alright, so this week we've got Full Throttle Remastered on PC, PlayStation 4 and the Vita.

01:40:55.500 --> 01:41:02.500
Guardians of the Galaxy, the Telltale series, episode 1, Tangled Up in Blue is going to be making its way out.

01:41:02.500 --> 01:41:07.500
PC, Mac, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, iOS and Android.

01:41:07.500 --> 01:41:12.500
The Disney Afternoon Collection on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:41:12.500 --> 01:41:15.500
The Silver Case on PlayStation 4.

01:41:15.500 --> 01:41:23.500
Wonder Boy, the Dragon's Trap on the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:41:23.500 --> 01:41:30.500
And finally, Micro Machines World Series on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:41:30.500 --> 01:41:33.500
Man, it's been a while since we had a Micro Machines game.

01:41:33.500 --> 01:41:37.500
Yeah, it has been a little while. So, cool.

01:41:37.500 --> 01:41:42.500
Let's travel to Japan real quick and then hopefully you can do the UK dates as well, Loki, since Dark Soccer is not here.

01:41:42.500 --> 01:41:46.500
Going to Japan real quick on the PlayStation 4.

01:41:46.500 --> 01:41:52.500
Let's see, coming out on the...what is the day here? I think the release day...

01:41:52.500 --> 01:41:56.500
I don't know, there's a lot this week, actually. I think the 20th is the day they get in their games.

01:41:56.500 --> 01:42:00.500
Yeah, looks like we get Dark Souls 3, the Fire Fades edition.

01:42:00.500 --> 01:42:04.500
That must be the DLC all-in-one type of thing that's coming out there.

01:42:04.500 --> 01:42:09.500
There's a vertical stand coming out if you need one of those to hold your PlayStation 4 upright.

01:42:09.500 --> 01:42:13.500
There's also Parappa the Rappa is getting its physical release in Japan.

01:42:13.500 --> 01:42:15.500
I remember that was the thing that's happening.

01:42:15.500 --> 01:42:17.500
So that is all happening on the 20th.

01:42:17.500 --> 01:42:26.500
The Vita is welcoming Dungeon Travelers 2 to Yamiochi no Otomo to Hajimari no Shou in regular and premium edition.

01:42:26.500 --> 01:42:30.500
And then One Piece Burning Blood gets a price reduction this week on the Vita.

01:42:30.500 --> 01:42:35.500
I see on the Switch this week, there actually is a new game on the Switch this week.

01:42:35.500 --> 01:42:39.500
Mina de Wai Wai Spelunker is out this week.

01:42:39.500 --> 01:42:45.500
It looks like it is one of those Spelunky kind of games, but it looks like it's multiplayer with that.

01:42:45.500 --> 01:42:51.500
So this is not something I've heard about getting a US release, but I know it's so easy to do the worldwide releases now.

01:42:51.500 --> 01:42:56.500
So I imagine it's just a matter of time before we get that over here as well.

01:42:56.500 --> 01:43:00.500
Then I think the 3DS does still have some stuff coming out this week.

01:43:00.500 --> 01:43:04.500
Oh yes, a new Fire Emblem game on the 3DS, so that'll be a big deal.

01:43:04.500 --> 01:43:10.500
Fire Emblem Echoes Mojitori no Iyou comes out in regular and limited edition.

01:43:10.500 --> 01:43:15.500
There are new Fire Emblem figures for Amiibo coming out to celebrate that as well.

01:43:15.500 --> 01:43:21.500
But if Fire Emblem isn't your thing, you could check out Pro Yaku Famista Climax comes out this week.

01:43:21.500 --> 01:43:25.500
That, of course, being a baseball game from Bandai Damko.

01:43:25.500 --> 01:43:28.500
So that's it for your Japanese releases. How about the UK, Loki?

01:43:28.500 --> 01:43:33.500
The UK, we have the Disney Afternoon Collection on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

01:43:33.500 --> 01:43:37.500
Voodoo Vince Remastered on Xbox One and PC.

01:43:37.500 --> 01:43:44.500
Siberia 3, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PC, the Nintendo Switch, and Mac.

01:43:44.500 --> 01:43:48.500
And finally, everything on PC.

01:43:48.500 --> 01:43:50.500
Everything is out.

01:43:50.500 --> 01:43:51.500
Everything is out.

01:43:51.500 --> 01:43:52.500
Everything you've always been waiting for.

01:43:52.500 --> 01:43:55.500
It's all coming out at once. Everything.

01:43:55.500 --> 01:43:57.500
Let's go to the mailbag!

01:44:03.500 --> 01:44:05.500
Every week, you guys email us.

01:44:05.500 --> 01:44:11.500
Participate at orangeloungeradio.com, and we read some of our favorite emails here on the show.

01:44:11.500 --> 01:44:15.500
We're going to start off this week with an email from Rettertainment, who starts off,

01:44:15.500 --> 01:44:17.500
Hello, LR.

01:44:17.500 --> 01:44:24.500
After getting a taste of Bree from the Sacramento IGDA's thoughts regarding the inclusion of sexuality in Mass Effect,

01:44:24.500 --> 01:44:27.500
I started ruminating about the subject myself.

01:44:27.500 --> 01:44:31.500
Yes, this includes more than just me frequently watching the scenes in Mass Effect on YouTube.

01:44:31.500 --> 01:44:37.500
This involved deep thought about the very nature of how depictions of sexuality fit into the media form that is video games.

01:44:37.500 --> 01:44:40.500
To that end, I've come up with the following perspective.

01:44:40.500 --> 01:44:46.500
Why do people like watching shows like Desperate Housewives, Hotel Babylon, and many American soap operas?

01:44:46.500 --> 01:44:51.500
Those shows are trashy in the sense that shows like that tease the audience with sexual content,

01:44:51.500 --> 01:44:57.500
occasionally indulging the audience in that content, while also being generally a form of lighthearted escapism.

01:44:57.500 --> 01:45:00.500
Why do people adore the music of Kylie Minogue? She's trashy.

01:45:00.500 --> 01:45:06.500
Hey, watch it, Rettertainment. She's a goddess. You better watch your step.

01:45:06.500 --> 01:45:11.500
Anyway, why do you have to diss? Of all the artists in the world, why Kylie? What did Kylie Minogue do to you?

01:45:11.500 --> 01:45:15.500
Anyway, sorry, back to the email from Rettertainment.

01:45:15.500 --> 01:45:23.500
Yeah, JD in chat was like, whoa, you just offended like every gay in the world.

01:45:24.500 --> 01:45:31.500
You better step off our queen, Rettertainment. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. All right, look, moving on, continuing on.

01:45:31.500 --> 01:45:40.500
She is, look, part of the reason why Kylie Minogue is awesome is that there is like a little bit of, actually there's a lot of camp to Kylie Minogue that's a lot of fun.

01:45:40.500 --> 01:45:45.500
Anyway, ActDeaf says, I thought Gaga was the queen.

01:45:45.500 --> 01:45:53.500
See, that's kind of like, like Gaga's like kind of like the mainstream thing, but like Kylie Minogue's kind of still that one that like, oh, not everybody's into her.

01:45:53.500 --> 01:45:59.500
You know, same thing with Carly Rae Jepsen, like you're more underground if you're a Carly Rae Jepsen stan than a Gaga.

01:45:59.500 --> 01:46:08.500
Everybody fucking likes Lady Gaga, but Carly Rae Jepsen? Have you heard the word of the gospel called emotion? Side B and Side A?

01:46:08.500 --> 01:46:13.500
Anyway, why do people like Fifty Shades of Grey? It is trashy.

01:46:13.500 --> 01:46:21.500
Okay, now that I'll agree with. Why do people like most reality programming? I have no goddamn motherfucking idea. Sorry, slipped for a moment there. It is trashy.

01:46:21.500 --> 01:46:30.500
Should we see many of the depictions of sexuality and video games in the same light? Is the sex in Grand Theft Auto trashy? Is the sex in The Witcher trashy?

01:46:30.500 --> 01:46:34.500
Does the St. Rose series revel in being trashy? Yes, yes, and goddamn it, yes.

01:46:34.500 --> 01:46:43.500
Should we see the sexuality depicted in Mass Effect as trashy escapism with no real attachment to reality in our society as we know it?

01:46:43.500 --> 01:46:55.500
Sure, the people at BioWare are trying to sell these games as a great example of storytelling, but if they admitted to Mass Effect being a sort of trashy escapism, the right wing media would be more on their asses than they are for their depiction of alien asses.

01:46:56.500 --> 01:47:01.500
Now for another deep question. Which product do you think will be made available to the public first?

01:47:01.500 --> 01:47:04.500
A. The game Loki is working on.

01:47:04.500 --> 01:47:08.500
B. Crumple, the game Gabe from the Sacramento IGDA is working on.

01:47:08.500 --> 01:47:17.500
C. It was in a coffee shop. The book I have that is currently available for pre-order on ink shares. Cheap plug. Well done, Retertainment, well done.

01:47:17.500 --> 01:47:31.500
I would go with option B due to option B being exponentially more popular than option C, as well as option B having something option A doesn't have whose value is hard to quantify. A name. Stay black, Retertainment.

01:47:31.500 --> 01:47:36.500
This message was brought to you by Apricot Heffenweizen. It is like fruit that gets you drunk.

01:47:36.500 --> 01:47:46.500
So, which game will come out first? I agree, Crumple is going to come out first because I really, really think Gabe is like close on that. I think they're just tying up a few loose ends and that's going to be out.

01:47:46.500 --> 01:47:55.500
So, but why would you, if your book isn't done, why did you throw that in there? So the question is, what's going to be done first, Crumple or your book?

01:47:55.500 --> 01:48:01.500
I think you should, I think you should push and get that book done. Maybe you can beat Gabe. Maybe it will be option C. We'll see.

01:48:01.500 --> 01:48:09.500
But if you trash Kylie Minogue in that book, I swear to God, I'm going to write a one star review. No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. But don't trash Kylie Minogue, she's awesome.

01:48:09.500 --> 01:48:20.500
Alright, moving on. One more email this week from Unsigned here and I'm not sure if I want to read the actual email address, so I'm just going to say it's Unsigned.

01:48:20.500 --> 01:48:31.500
Oh, it says Love, Sam. So this email is from Sam. Hello, OLR crew. I might love the show. The answer to your question is yes. The Scorpio will be $600, but that's okay.

01:48:31.500 --> 01:48:42.500
There will also be a $400 SKU with a small hard drive and no Blu-ray. Problem solved. Love, Sam and Rob and Dark Sakura and Loki. Those are very strange emails. Is that insider info?

01:48:42.500 --> 01:48:53.500
I'm not going to strip a Blu-ray from the system. That makes sense. No, I mean, I understand there's a licensing fee that goes with that and everything, but you're not going to knock $200 off the price by just making it not play movies.

01:48:53.500 --> 01:48:57.500
It is a 4K Blu-ray in the Scorpio.

01:48:57.500 --> 01:49:12.500
Yeah, I don't know. I mean, hey, I'm going to file this email away in the whole, like, check back in this email after E3 and then if it comes out that there's something to this, I'll email the guy back going, what else do you know? I'll just file this away.

01:49:12.500 --> 01:49:22.500
Otherwise, well, okay, let's humor it for just half a second here. Could there be more than one version of Project Scorpio?

01:49:22.500 --> 01:49:33.500
I don't think that they would do that. I mean, there could be, but if they do do multiple SKUs, they'll be different hard drive sizes, but they have a one terabyte versions. What's spec debt right now?

01:49:33.500 --> 01:49:40.500
I don't know if they would really, I don't know. I don't think they would do that.

01:49:40.500 --> 01:49:44.500
I don't think so either because I mean, Scorpio is going to be a hard sell.

01:49:44.500 --> 01:49:46.500
Or if they do like colors or bundles or something like that.

01:49:46.500 --> 01:49:50.500
Scorpio, I still think Scorpio is a hard sell as it is. I'm not getting this.

01:49:50.500 --> 01:50:01.500
It is because 4K televisions, I mean, they're out there, but it's not like, I don't know, it's not, people aren't really feeling compulsive by that yet.

01:50:01.500 --> 01:50:08.500
It's not like HD was where like all of a sudden all these different providers are offering, you know, 4K services.

01:50:08.500 --> 01:50:19.500
I don't think, like as far as like, I have Comcast right now, which I don't even really use TV through them and may drop the TV, but I was looking at it and I'm like, I don't even know what 4K offerings they have.

01:50:19.500 --> 01:50:22.500
I know Netflix, I think has 4K.

01:50:22.500 --> 01:50:24.500
They do. It's limited, but they do.

01:50:24.500 --> 01:50:30.500
But I don't know who offers it. So why would I upgrade unless I'm really buying a lot of those 4K Blu-rays?

01:50:30.500 --> 01:50:42.500
I don't know if I'd really want it. And here's the thing too, like I used to have a surround sound system in my house, but it's so loud that like we don't use it anymore because I mean, it would wake up the kids if we were watching a movie with that.

01:50:42.500 --> 01:50:50.500
I mean, it's cool, but like I would think if you want to upgrade your TV to 4K and stuff to really enjoy that, you'd want to have the sound and everything.

01:50:50.500 --> 01:51:00.500
And I don't know, it's just, when they come down in price more, I'll pick one up, but I think right now there's not a whole lot of content on 4K for me.

01:51:00.500 --> 01:51:02.500
It's just like it was with 3D TVs.

01:51:02.500 --> 01:51:09.500
Yeah, over in chat over at live.voggenetware.com, Bob Coffee says there's like no 4K broadcast content.

01:51:09.500 --> 01:51:11.500
Netflix and other streaming services offer that.

01:51:11.500 --> 01:51:18.500
But that reminds me, now that you say 3D TVs, I forgot all about that update to the PlayStation VR. I totally need to watch Tron Legacy now.

01:51:18.500 --> 01:51:19.500
Oh yeah, you do.

01:51:19.500 --> 01:51:20.500
I totally need to do it.

01:51:20.500 --> 01:51:22.500
I have The Lion King in 3D if you want to watch that.

01:51:22.500 --> 01:51:24.500
Fuck The Lion King, I don't give a shit about that.

01:51:24.500 --> 01:51:27.500
What about the kids? Oh wait, kids shouldn't do the 3D, I forget.

01:51:27.500 --> 01:51:33.500
Ah, I've never let warning labels stop me from having them do that. They love that kind of shit.

01:51:33.500 --> 01:51:34.500
It builds character.

01:51:35.500 --> 01:51:41.500
Alright, thank you for the emails, you guys. Participate at orangeloungeradio.com if you want to send us an email in the future.

01:51:41.500 --> 01:51:47.500
In the meantime, we have more news before we get to the Skype line over at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

01:51:47.500 --> 01:51:55.500
Let's talk about Minecraft, like my son likes to do all the time, except now he's talking mostly about Super Mario Run, which is also irritating after a while.

01:51:56.500 --> 01:51:59.500
But, it's just the quantity of it.

01:51:59.500 --> 01:52:09.500
So, Microsoft is opening a brand new Minecraft online store selling both the user and Microsoft created content.

01:52:09.500 --> 01:52:13.500
So, you know, mods and things, they're going to be selling those now.

01:52:13.500 --> 01:52:18.500
Whereas, you know, on the PC version, which is still out there, you can get that stuff for free.

01:52:18.500 --> 01:52:31.500
Whatever. So, they're doing that on the Pocket and Windows 10 versions of the game, which mine is still fucked up and I can't download it again because my Microsoft account is all sorts of screwy.

01:52:31.500 --> 01:52:32.500
That's annoying.

01:52:32.500 --> 01:52:40.500
But, they're going to be allowing you to transfer your purchases back and forth between your multiple Microsoft accounts because it's going to be tied to your Xbox Live account.

01:52:40.500 --> 01:52:45.500
So, I don't know if this is going to come into the Xbox One version or anything like that, but that would be kind of cool.

01:52:46.500 --> 01:52:53.500
I don't know really what they're offering, if it's just going to be like mods, because they have a whole mod system that you can do.

01:52:53.500 --> 01:52:54.500
And I think this is optional stuff.

01:52:54.500 --> 01:52:58.500
I think it's said straight up, not mods, but more like the cosmetic stuff.

01:52:58.500 --> 01:53:06.500
But, that's still very interesting because I seem to recall a time when they were going to try to sell this stuff for Oblivion, remember that, in Steam.

01:53:06.500 --> 01:53:13.500
But, the community pushed back big time where Steam and Bethesda had to be like, whoa, guys, I'm just kidding, we're not really going to do that.

01:53:13.500 --> 01:53:17.500
But, I think that's why mods aren't included. It's only like cosmetics.

01:53:17.500 --> 01:53:22.500
Yeah, Microsoft's store plays by it's own set of rules. It's shitty rules.

01:53:22.500 --> 01:53:34.500
So, if I'm understanding this right, and maybe you're not, if I'm understanding this right, then we could do a, hypothetically, we could do an OLR skin pack, or a VOG network skin pack, or something, and sell it on the marketplace to make a little bit of money.

01:53:34.500 --> 01:53:40.500
Potentially, yes, but I don't know what the details would be with setting that up.

01:53:40.500 --> 01:53:42.500
But, maybe you could.

01:53:42.500 --> 01:53:45.500
I think this may also include like, you know, structures.

01:53:45.500 --> 01:53:48.500
I'm not saying we're going to do that, I'm just saying, hypothetically, could we?

01:53:48.500 --> 01:53:50.500
So, maybe like structures, like maps and stuff like that.

01:53:50.500 --> 01:53:51.500
Interesting.

01:53:51.500 --> 01:53:53.500
But, yeah, it's something that they're offering.

01:53:53.500 --> 01:54:00.500
And, of course, you know, they mentioned during the whole conference that Minecraft is coming to Nintendo Switch.

01:54:00.500 --> 01:54:02.500
What exclusive features do you get on the Switch?

01:54:02.500 --> 01:54:06.500
Jack shit. It's basically like the Wii U version of Minecraft.

01:54:06.500 --> 01:54:11.500
But, hey, it looks nice. It's portable. I mean, they already have portable Minecraft, but it's portable.

01:54:11.500 --> 01:54:16.500
Even the fact that this is portable and console, and it's all in one, that's a pretty big selling point for it.

01:54:16.500 --> 01:54:22.500
And, some of us skipped it on Wii U, because we just kind of figured something like this might happen someday.

01:54:22.500 --> 01:54:24.500
So, I skipped the Wii U version anyway.

01:54:24.500 --> 01:54:26.500
I think it was just kind of like overpriced at the time.

01:54:26.500 --> 01:54:28.500
It's really the same shit.

01:54:28.500 --> 01:54:33.500
I already own, look, I own Minecraft on PS4, Xbox 360, PC.

01:54:33.500 --> 01:54:36.500
So, it's like, yet again, here's one of those games I bought multiple times.

01:54:36.500 --> 01:54:40.500
So, I wasn't really persuaded to buy a fourth time on the Wii U.

01:54:40.500 --> 01:54:42.500
A fourth time on the Switch? Maybe.

01:54:42.500 --> 01:54:47.500
I liked, again, the whole fact that I could pick this up, take it to a friend's house,

01:54:47.500 --> 01:54:49.500
and we could play Minecraft together on the different Switches.

01:54:49.500 --> 01:54:55.500
Like, that is more interesting to me than anything the other versions have done.

01:54:55.500 --> 01:54:56.500
If that makes sense.

01:54:56.500 --> 01:54:57.500
Yeah.

01:54:57.500 --> 01:54:58.500
Alright.

01:54:58.500 --> 01:55:00.500
Let's see. Moving on.

01:55:00.500 --> 01:55:07.500
Speaking of Microsoft, something that is coming out for the Xbox One is a new version of Skype.

01:55:07.500 --> 01:55:09.500
Skype was already on the Xbox One.

01:55:09.500 --> 01:55:14.500
I remember when that system first came out, we got a couple phone calls to our own Skype line on the Xbox One.

01:55:14.500 --> 01:55:17.500
I remember the camera used to follow you around, too, which is kind of cool.

01:55:17.500 --> 01:55:19.500
The only thing the Kinect camera was good for.

01:55:19.500 --> 01:55:22.500
It was a pretty cool feature to all said and done.

01:55:22.500 --> 01:55:25.500
So, apparently, Kinect is going to have a new version of Skype.

01:55:25.500 --> 01:55:27.500
And yes, they are still saying Kinect.

01:55:27.500 --> 01:55:32.500
So, this is something new where, ooh, some usefulness out of Kinect that we haven't had for a year.

01:55:32.500 --> 01:55:36.500
If you still have it because all those new systems don't sell it with Kinect and...

01:55:36.500 --> 01:55:39.500
And you can't just hook up any old camera to this thing either.

01:55:39.500 --> 01:55:44.500
I wish Microsoft would just break down that barrier and let you hook up any camera to it.

01:55:44.500 --> 01:55:45.500
I mean, it would just be...

01:55:45.500 --> 01:55:47.500
I even think I have a Microsoft camera.

01:55:47.500 --> 01:55:48.500
It's just not a Kinect.

01:55:48.500 --> 01:55:50.500
But I think my webcam is a Microsoft webcam.

01:55:50.500 --> 01:55:52.500
Get over with Kinect. They're not using it anymore.

01:55:52.500 --> 01:55:58.500
Anyway, the new edition is based on Universal Windows version that's on the other platforms.

01:55:58.500 --> 01:56:00.500
But, of course, this is more for your living room.

01:56:00.500 --> 01:56:03.500
So, there is snap picture and picture chatting now.

01:56:03.500 --> 01:56:04.500
It's gone.

01:56:04.500 --> 01:56:09.500
So, that is no longer there, but the whole thing has a new look, controller shortcuts,

01:56:09.500 --> 01:56:14.500
manual zoom control to go with the automatic zoom, I guess, that follows you around and so forth.

01:56:14.500 --> 01:56:19.500
So, yeah, you can check that out if you actually have an Xbox One with Kinect.

01:56:19.500 --> 01:56:21.500
But, I mean, that'll be cool.

01:56:21.500 --> 01:56:24.500
I liked it when we got phone calls for the show from Xbox One.

01:56:24.500 --> 01:56:25.500
Yeah, that's cool.

01:56:25.500 --> 01:56:26.500
It's always cool.

01:56:26.500 --> 01:56:32.500
I mean, it's nice to see that extra functionality on systems, whether it's something I would use or not.

01:56:33.500 --> 01:56:37.500
I don't know if this is going to prove itself to be super popular, but...

01:56:37.500 --> 01:56:40.500
I don't think so with the limited amount of people that have Kinect.

01:56:40.500 --> 01:56:42.500
Well, here's the interesting thing, okay?

01:56:42.500 --> 01:56:46.500
The Xbox 360, remember when they put out the crappy little webcam for the 360?

01:56:46.500 --> 01:56:48.500
Yeah, I remember that. I still have one.

01:56:48.500 --> 01:56:51.500
Right. Well, you could do video calls on that.

01:56:51.500 --> 01:56:55.500
That was before the Wii U. That was before the Xbox One.

01:56:55.500 --> 01:56:59.500
On the Xbox 360 and that webcam thing, you could actually make a call to another Xbox 360.

01:56:59.500 --> 01:57:04.500
And I remember, I think this was during a time when Shane was living in Kansas,

01:57:04.500 --> 01:57:08.500
and I want to say we had a party at the house, and we had that.

01:57:08.500 --> 01:57:12.500
And we called him so we could all say hi, even though he couldn't be there at the party,

01:57:12.500 --> 01:57:16.500
but we could all, like, you know, kind of do the across long distance thing, which was neat.

01:57:16.500 --> 01:57:19.500
That was like, ooh, the future, video calling, the Jetsons, that whole thing.

01:57:19.500 --> 01:57:24.500
So, I mean, it's just interesting that that technology kind of, that's been around a while,

01:57:24.500 --> 01:57:33.500
but I guess, you know, now they're just trying to unify it all under Skype is the same on Windows 10 versus a tablet versus Xbox One.

01:57:33.500 --> 01:57:39.500
I mean, I get that they're pushing Skype as an alternative to actual calls and all that.

01:57:39.500 --> 01:57:41.500
So, neat.

01:57:41.500 --> 01:57:42.500
Yeah.

01:57:42.500 --> 01:57:44.500
All right. Moving on. Loki.

01:57:44.500 --> 01:57:50.500
So, this is kind of cool. They're working on creating a refund system for the Microsoft platform.

01:57:50.500 --> 01:57:52.500
So, the Xbox One and Windows 10.

01:57:52.500 --> 01:57:58.500
It sounds like that they're kind of building it similar to what they have on the Steam store.

01:57:58.500 --> 01:58:11.500
So, it would basically be some sort of program where you'd be able to request a refund if you have under, like, so much time playing the game or whatever.

01:58:11.500 --> 01:58:19.500
So, to request a refund, you'd go to your account on Microsoft.com, you'd sign in, and you'd select your payment and billing.

01:58:19.500 --> 01:58:22.500
And then from there, you would collect a button that says request a refund.

01:58:22.500 --> 01:58:29.500
And, of course, it said, you know, they're not available yet, but you'd be able to do that for, like, you know, DLC season.

01:58:29.500 --> 01:58:33.500
Are they saying, like, some things like DLC season passes, game add-ons might not be eligible.

01:58:33.500 --> 01:58:39.500
But games, they're saying that, you know, maybe depending on the amount of time that you played or something like that.

01:58:39.500 --> 01:58:43.500
So, that's kind of neat, I guess, if you buy something you really don't like.

01:58:43.500 --> 01:58:47.500
And they're saying less than two hours or if you've owned it for less than two weeks.

01:58:47.500 --> 01:58:52.500
So, this is going to be controversial in the development community as it was on Steam.

01:58:52.500 --> 01:58:58.500
Yeah, I think so, especially, like, when you're talking about games that just come out, like, that are just fucking broken.

01:58:58.500 --> 01:59:02.500
And you know what? Good. I think it should be that way, because you know what?

01:59:02.500 --> 01:59:09.500
If you release a product, you can't tell me that you, the developers of the game, don't know the, you know, the situation.

01:59:09.500 --> 01:59:17.500
And let's not blame the developers themselves, the publishers. The publishers know what, you know, where the level of quality is on that product.

01:59:17.500 --> 01:59:20.500
And they're just pushing it out because they're going to make a quick buck.

01:59:20.500 --> 01:59:26.500
So, you know what? That's fine. I really think they should have more of these restrictions in place.

01:59:26.500 --> 01:59:33.500
What are they going to do about the, and I'm using my quotey fingers, walking simulator games where some of them are only a less than two hour experience?

01:59:33.500 --> 01:59:40.500
Things like Firewatch or, you know, maybe that was more like four hours, but still, you know, there's a lot gone home.

01:59:40.500 --> 01:59:43.500
Fuck, you could be gone home in ten minutes if you know what you're doing.

01:59:43.500 --> 01:59:45.500
You know, a lot of those games are shorter.

01:59:45.500 --> 01:59:50.500
But I think for those, though, that's going to be a very unlikely scenario.

01:59:50.500 --> 01:59:57.500
I mean, yeah, there may be issues where it's like that, but I don't think there's a lot of that content necessarily out on those platforms.

01:59:57.500 --> 02:00:00.500
I mean, they've got, some of them, there are like...

02:00:00.500 --> 02:00:07.500
Hopefully, the publishers can limit it if it, like, get a waiver or limit it somehow if it's justified.

02:00:07.500 --> 02:00:13.500
You know what I mean? Like, if the game's length is short or the amount of the game is a certain amount or something,

02:00:13.500 --> 02:00:18.500
then maybe the policy could be altered to be fifteen minutes before a refund or something. You know what I mean?

02:00:18.500 --> 02:00:23.500
Like, I just, I would hate to see, because, you know, I like these kind of games.

02:00:23.500 --> 02:00:27.500
And Dark Soccer, I know she's not here tonight, but I know what, because she was texting me all about it this week.

02:00:27.500 --> 02:00:31.500
I know one game she got super into this week, she suddenly started Dear Esther on a whim,

02:00:31.500 --> 02:00:36.500
which was the game that was before Everybody's Gone to the Rapture from that, what's the name of that company?

02:00:36.500 --> 02:00:42.500
The Chinese Room, I think is the name of it, that that company made beforehand, and she was like super into it.

02:00:42.500 --> 02:00:48.500
So, like, I really like those walking sims, and I hate that name, but that's what they call them.

02:00:48.500 --> 02:00:53.500
But those types of games, I'm really into them, because they have such good fucking stories, usually.

02:00:53.500 --> 02:01:00.500
And I like the fact that they're kind of quick, you know? It's like writing a movie, but you're the movie!

02:01:00.500 --> 02:01:05.500
So, I just, I hope there's space for the short game in this.

02:01:05.500 --> 02:01:10.500
I mean, couldn't you even beat a Telltale Episode 1 in a couple of hours?

02:01:10.500 --> 02:01:14.500
I want to say Walking Dead Episode 1 did not take me that long.

02:01:14.500 --> 02:01:17.500
You could beat those games pretty quickly, too.

02:01:17.500 --> 02:01:18.500
We'll see.

02:01:18.500 --> 02:01:23.500
Yeah, but they would depend on how they do this. A lot of those Walking the Telltale games, they release the first episode for free,

02:01:23.500 --> 02:01:30.500
and then everything else you have to pay for, so they could say, oh, all the other levels are DLC, and that's restricted from it.

02:01:30.500 --> 02:01:35.500
Oh, and I think that's actually how they do it. I think, like, King's Quest, that's exactly how they did it.

02:01:35.500 --> 02:01:41.500
You had the base game, but then everything else is DLC that adds the, like, King's Quest Episode 2 and all the other stuff.

02:01:41.500 --> 02:01:46.500
Hmm, okay. That might be a way they do it. Well, anyway, I just, look, don't get me wrong.

02:01:46.500 --> 02:01:50.500
I think this policy at the end of the day is a good thing because of what you said.

02:01:50.500 --> 02:01:57.500
It forces the publisher to put out a game that isn't going to be crappy right at their release date that they can, like, patch out later on.

02:01:57.500 --> 02:02:02.500
But, I don't want to see it hurt the very creative, shorter games.

02:02:02.500 --> 02:02:04.500
So, I just want to see a balance, that's all.

02:02:04.500 --> 02:02:10.500
I just don't know if there's a lot of those, even, like, the walking sim games that they have in, on those platforms.

02:02:10.500 --> 02:02:13.500
I want to say they're probably more than two hours in length.

02:02:13.500 --> 02:02:18.500
So, you know, I would think that you would want, for your money, something a little bit longer than two hours.

02:02:18.500 --> 02:02:23.500
I would be surprised if there's any games like that that are under two hours on that platform.

02:02:23.500 --> 02:02:31.500
But, I mean, if you're really intent on just buying it and, you know, speed running through it,

02:02:31.500 --> 02:02:33.500
I mean, that's kind of ridiculous to do that.

02:02:33.500 --> 02:02:37.500
But, I just don't think that's going to be a very likely scenario that's going to happen all the time.

02:02:37.500 --> 02:02:40.500
I mean, that takes a lot of forethought.

02:02:40.500 --> 02:02:42.500
And, I mean, there's just a certain type of people that would do that.

02:02:42.500 --> 02:02:46.500
I just, I don't think everyone's going to go do that.

02:02:46.500 --> 02:02:51.500
I mean, I think the Steam thing is kind of accepted as the norm now.

02:02:51.500 --> 02:02:56.500
So, you know, it'll hopefully work out alright on Xbox.

02:02:56.500 --> 02:02:59.500
Again, I think at the end of the day it will be a good thing.

02:02:59.500 --> 02:03:03.500
I just, you know, different games sometimes take different measurements with it, that's all.

02:03:03.500 --> 02:03:04.500
Yeah.

02:03:04.500 --> 02:03:06.500
Alright, well, let's move on and talk about…

02:03:06.500 --> 02:03:08.500
Oh, and then of course, you know, to kind of add on to that,

02:03:08.500 --> 02:03:12.500
Microsoft also said that they have the right to block users should they be found abusing the refund program.

02:03:12.500 --> 02:03:13.500
Oh, okay.

02:03:13.500 --> 02:03:19.500
So, if you do find people that are doing, burning through games in two hours and then, you know,

02:03:19.500 --> 02:03:21.500
refunding them that they're going to block you.

02:03:21.500 --> 02:03:22.500
Alright.

02:03:22.500 --> 02:03:28.500
Well, let's talk about Germany for a little bit because there's some interesting legal maneuvers going on in Germany right now.

02:03:28.500 --> 02:03:35.500
So, there's a German broadcast authority which I'm assuming would be similar to how we have the FCC here in the States.

02:03:35.500 --> 02:03:38.500
Should I embarrass myself trying to pronounce this?

02:03:38.500 --> 02:03:42.500
Landesmedienstalt is the name.

02:03:42.500 --> 02:03:44.500
I totally butchered that, I'm sorry.

02:03:44.500 --> 02:03:49.500
Sorry to any Germans or people that speak German listening to this show, but I butchered Japanese, bad enough.

02:03:49.500 --> 02:03:51.500
So, now I butcher German.

02:03:51.500 --> 02:03:56.500
Anyway, apparently this broadcast authority in Germany has said that YouTubers and Twitch streamers

02:03:56.500 --> 02:04:02.500
need to get a broadcasting license because they're considered broadcast by the law.

02:04:02.500 --> 02:04:05.500
This is coming from a YouTuber, Pete Smit.

02:04:05.500 --> 02:04:07.500
I don't know if I'm saying that right, sorry.

02:04:07.500 --> 02:04:13.500
He did a little video, it is in German, but he had to apply for a license by April 30th if he wants to keep uploading videos.

02:04:13.500 --> 02:04:21.500
Now, broadcast licenses can cost between 1,000 and 10,000 euros depending on the size of the audience as well as, you know, other things.

02:04:22.500 --> 02:04:30.500
I guess officials are aware that the rules are outdated, but they do, I guess, encompass broadcasts, but they were designed for TV and radio.

02:04:30.500 --> 02:04:39.500
So, it sounds like most things when it comes to, you know, broadcast, when it comes to, we talked about patents before and some of that.

02:04:39.500 --> 02:04:44.500
Some of this shit needs to be badly updated for how fast our technology is taking off.

02:04:44.500 --> 02:04:49.500
You know, we have that problem when it comes to the patents and all that stuff in the States as well.

02:04:49.500 --> 02:04:55.500
But anyway, so apparently he's gonna have to apply for this. I just...

02:04:55.500 --> 02:04:58.500
I don't think, why would he just be maybe going after this guy?

02:04:58.500 --> 02:05:05.500
But YouTube isn't based in Germany. YouTube is based in San Francisco.

02:05:05.500 --> 02:05:09.500
Are they saying broadcast and the fact that he's like doing live streams or something like that?

02:05:09.500 --> 02:05:12.500
Because that would be the only thing I see is broadcast, I mean, but...

02:05:12.500 --> 02:05:17.500
Well, I think the reality is this guy is probably a PewDiePie-ish figure in Germany.

02:05:17.500 --> 02:05:21.500
He's probably making a lot of money off his videos and the government wants money.

02:05:21.500 --> 02:05:24.500
But wouldn't they be able to tax his income?

02:05:24.500 --> 02:05:27.500
Like, because if that's what would happen here in the States, if I made a million...

02:05:27.500 --> 02:05:28.500
That just seems really stupid.

02:05:28.500 --> 02:05:39.500
If I made a million dollars off YouTube videos, although I gotta say, Bobby's Tesla thing that he put on the VOG Network channel, still getting tons of views.

02:05:39.500 --> 02:05:44.500
So, I mean, we might actually get a check from YouTube thanks to that video.

02:05:44.500 --> 02:05:52.500
I mean, it won't be a lot, but it's enough to like pay for the stream for three months instead of me having to pay for it or pay for the website instead of Bobby having to pay for it.

02:05:52.500 --> 02:05:54.500
But anyway, I digress.

02:05:54.500 --> 02:06:04.500
So assuming, you know, if we were to make over 400 or something like that dollars, I don't know what the threshold is, we'd have to claim that as income.

02:06:04.500 --> 02:06:07.500
And so then there'd be an income tax on that. So the government would make their money there.

02:06:07.500 --> 02:06:08.500
Yeah.

02:06:08.500 --> 02:06:14.500
So does Germany not have an income tax? I have to plead ignorance here. I don't know enough about it.

02:06:14.500 --> 02:06:20.500
Or is that not enough? Germany wants this money too. I don't know.

02:06:20.500 --> 02:06:30.500
Anyway, TV stations with licenses in Germany also have to go by other guidelines, such as adult content, which has swearing and violence, because we all know they show titties in Germany.

02:06:30.500 --> 02:06:32.500
So that is one thing that they have up on us.

02:06:32.500 --> 02:06:33.500
Praise Germany.

02:06:33.500 --> 02:06:37.500
They will show titties on the telly, but only after 10 o'clock.

02:06:37.500 --> 02:06:40.500
But how are you going to police the whole damn internet, Germany?

02:06:40.500 --> 02:07:00.500
I just, I think instead of going after this guy, they should probably stick to the whole, we know the laws are outdated, and maybe look at it from a perspective of, okay, if you want to tax this guy who's making money, then look into it in that regard, like what we would have to do here with an income tax.

02:07:00.500 --> 02:07:07.500
Again, as I said, we are lucky and throwing confetti if we ever get a check from YouTube for one of our videos.

02:07:07.500 --> 02:07:10.500
So this is not something I know a lot about, to be honest.

02:07:10.500 --> 02:07:17.500
So I'd be very curious if we do have any overseas listeners, any perspective you guys might have from your own company on this.

02:07:17.500 --> 02:07:23.500
I'm not seeing our chat room light up on this particular topic, but I don't know of any Germans that regularly listen to this show.

02:07:23.500 --> 02:07:25.500
So we'll see.

02:07:25.500 --> 02:07:28.500
Let's see, go into chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

02:07:29.500 --> 02:07:32.500
Dungeon Buster says, it should be enough for hamburgers.

02:07:32.500 --> 02:07:34.500
Tesla hamburgers for everyone.

02:07:34.500 --> 02:07:40.500
Yes, the Tesla video might have made enough money to buy a pre-Dragon Con dinner.

02:07:40.500 --> 02:07:42.500
Bobby and I have a tradition of a pre-Dragon Con dinner.

02:07:42.500 --> 02:07:45.500
Perhaps this can fund the Dragon Con dinner this year.

02:07:45.500 --> 02:07:48.500
Thank you guys for your views on that.

02:07:49.500 --> 02:07:53.500
All right, anyway, moving on.

02:07:53.500 --> 02:07:58.500
Oh, by the way, and if you're not subscribed to the YouTube VOG Network channel, go do it.

02:07:58.500 --> 02:08:00.500
It's VOG Network over on YouTube.

02:08:00.500 --> 02:08:07.500
It's not just the Tesla stuff, although Bobby did a great job with that, but you can actually see Shane from Ranger Pride.

02:08:07.500 --> 02:08:13.500
I never get him on camera, and we're actually reviewing the Mass Effect ride over at California Great America.

02:08:14.500 --> 02:08:19.500
Maybe there'll be some more projects in the future. I don't know, podcasting takes a lot of time as it is.

02:08:19.500 --> 02:08:22.500
All right, but that's VOG Network over on YouTube.

02:08:22.500 --> 02:08:28.500
Moving on, Loki, one more story here before we get to the calls at Orange Laundry Day on Skype.

02:08:28.500 --> 02:08:36.500
So there's a brand new mod that they've done for Sonic the Hedgehog 2, and this you get to play Yoshi.

02:08:36.500 --> 02:08:39.500
So Yoshi in Sonic the Hedgehog 2.

02:08:39.500 --> 02:08:50.500
They're saying that Yoshi has all of kind of Yoshi's abilities, except now instead of Baby Mario, it's Baby Sonic riding on his back.

02:08:50.500 --> 02:08:55.500
And you can actually eat the enemies and turn them into eggs and all that fun stuff.

02:08:55.500 --> 02:08:56.500
So it's pretty awesome.

02:08:56.500 --> 02:09:02.500
And they even have a little title screen and all that fun stuff.

02:09:03.500 --> 02:09:05.500
So this is just a ROM hack?

02:09:05.500 --> 02:09:06.500
Yeah.

02:09:07.500 --> 02:09:09.500
That does look pretty good.

02:09:11.500 --> 02:09:14.500
Is this one of those things that you can download on Steam?

02:09:14.500 --> 02:09:15.500
Because you know how...

02:09:15.500 --> 02:09:20.500
Yeah, I remember that. I don't know. I don't know if you can download it on Steam or not.

02:09:23.500 --> 02:09:25.500
But yeah, I don't know. We'll check it out.

02:09:25.500 --> 02:09:33.500
I think the guy who made it, Shiryu, he is like a Patreon that I think he releases his stuff on.

02:09:33.500 --> 02:09:34.500
Interesting.

02:09:35.500 --> 02:09:36.500
Looks pretty cool.

02:09:36.500 --> 02:09:38.500
I think we must be missing out not being on that Patreon thing.

02:09:38.500 --> 02:09:41.500
People will give you money for doing stuff on a regular basis?

02:09:41.500 --> 02:09:42.500
Yeah, apparently.

02:09:42.500 --> 02:09:43.500
We didn't get the memo on that.

02:09:43.500 --> 02:09:44.500
Alright, anyway.

02:09:45.500 --> 02:09:48.500
People will be giving money for this if they want to check this out.

02:09:48.500 --> 02:09:58.500
ESL, which is an eSports league network, is going to be bringing its live competitive gaming channel called eSports TV to the PlayStation Vue.

02:09:58.500 --> 02:10:03.500
Now PlayStation Vue is the cable-ish system that is built into the PlayStation.

02:10:03.500 --> 02:10:12.500
So ESL's new channel is going to broaden competitive gaming's appeal by giving gamers access to 24-7 eSports content in the US.

02:10:12.500 --> 02:10:15.500
It's already a thing in Europe. It launched in Europe last May.

02:10:15.500 --> 02:10:20.500
Apparently 5 million households in the Europe territories have this, so that's pretty cool.

02:10:20.500 --> 02:10:27.500
However, if you want to get this on PlayStation Vue in the States, you have to have a PlayStation Vue Elite subscription.

02:10:27.500 --> 02:10:29.500
That's $54.99 a month.

02:10:29.500 --> 02:10:30.500
So...

02:10:30.500 --> 02:10:32.500
Fuck that.

02:10:32.500 --> 02:10:36.500
Now, keep in mind, that doesn't mean you're paying all that much for one channel.

02:10:36.500 --> 02:10:37.500
No.

02:10:37.500 --> 02:10:39.500
It just means it's part of that extended package.

02:10:39.500 --> 02:10:40.500
So fuck that.

02:10:40.500 --> 02:10:43.500
Yeah, I don't know, guys. That's a lot of money.

02:10:43.500 --> 02:10:51.500
But, you know, it's still kind of neat that eSports is kind of weaving its way into the traditional model.

02:10:51.500 --> 02:10:57.500
But at the same time, we just had a conversation about how the traditional model for TV and all this stuff is completely changing.

02:10:57.500 --> 02:11:04.500
So I really think, you know, and I'm sure these guys already have a huge presence on Twitch and YouTube and all that stuff,

02:11:04.500 --> 02:11:06.500
but I feel like these guys are going to get even more.

02:11:06.500 --> 02:11:13.500
I mean, 5 million, you know, households in Europe is cool, but I bet they have way more viewers online.

02:11:13.500 --> 02:11:14.500
They do.

02:11:14.500 --> 02:11:15.500
Yeah.

02:11:15.500 --> 02:11:26.500
But anyway, I guess there's some weird validation that eSports gets by being in some of the same places that football and basketball and all that is.

02:11:26.500 --> 02:11:30.500
Don't get me wrong. I was a PlayStation View subscriber for a while. The problem...

02:11:30.500 --> 02:11:31.500
I didn't know that.

02:11:31.500 --> 02:11:37.500
The problem is, though, they dropped some of their major channels. They lost the rights to them.

02:11:37.500 --> 02:11:39.500
So, like, I didn't want to say, like, Comedy Central was one of those.

02:11:39.500 --> 02:11:42.500
And that's really all I watched on there. I'm like, fuck that.

02:11:42.500 --> 02:11:48.500
I'm leaving because this is the one channel that I watched on PlayStation View and now it's gone.

02:11:48.500 --> 02:11:51.500
I'm not sticking around for the nonsense you have on here.

02:11:51.500 --> 02:11:52.500
Yeah.

02:11:52.500 --> 02:11:53.500
So, I mean...

02:11:53.500 --> 02:11:57.500
As long as they have the H1 so I can watch Drag Race. It's the only thing I watch anymore.

02:11:57.500 --> 02:12:00.500
It was all right. It's just, there's other options out there now.

02:12:00.500 --> 02:12:07.500
I mean, what, YouTube has their YouTube TV coming out and they've got, you know, one of the other ones.

02:12:07.500 --> 02:12:11.500
I know PlayStation View. There's the whole...

02:12:11.500 --> 02:12:13.500
God, I can't remember the other one.

02:12:13.500 --> 02:12:15.500
The other one through...

02:12:15.500 --> 02:12:18.500
Not Sling.

02:12:18.500 --> 02:12:22.500
It was through Dish. I don't remember. Maybe it was Sling. I don't remember.

02:12:23.500 --> 02:12:27.500
They've got different, they have tons of different ways you can watch, or just even through your cable company.

02:12:27.500 --> 02:12:29.500
William Murderface in chat confirms it's Sling.

02:12:29.500 --> 02:12:30.500
Yeah.

02:12:30.500 --> 02:12:37.500
So, I mean, I've got 50 bucks towards Sling because I bought that stupid, you know, Android TV thing, which is fantastic.

02:12:37.500 --> 02:12:43.500
I love that thing, but I haven't really bothered to go on to Sling yet, but that might be something I'd do.

02:12:43.500 --> 02:12:47.500
But yeah, I'm not going to, like, I wouldn't subscribe to the higher tier one because honestly,

02:12:47.500 --> 02:12:51.500
I was looking at what they had, you know, versus the basic tier and the higher tier in View.

02:12:51.500 --> 02:12:55.500
It's really not worth it. And this definitely wouldn't sweeten the pot.

02:12:55.500 --> 02:12:59.500
We're going to go ahead and open up the Skype line over at Orange Lounge Radio.

02:12:59.500 --> 02:13:02.500
All one word on Skype. If you want to give us a call about anything we've talked about tonight,

02:13:02.500 --> 02:13:05.500
or maybe something we haven't talked about tonight, you can give us a call.

02:13:05.500 --> 02:13:08.500
Orange Lounge Radio, again, all one word on Skype.

02:13:08.500 --> 02:13:12.500
Wyland in chat points out, I think CW has H1Z1 coming up.

02:13:12.500 --> 02:13:15.500
Yeah, I remember a story on this show about the CW.

02:13:15.500 --> 02:13:16.500
Yeah.

02:13:16.500 --> 02:13:20.500
Home of all those DC shows, and they don't even have Top Model anymore.

02:13:20.500 --> 02:13:25.500
What else does CW have besides all the DC comics and Riverdale?

02:13:25.500 --> 02:13:29.500
There's not a lot there, right? So, I mean, I guess they have to fill the programming time with something.

02:13:29.500 --> 02:13:32.500
Oh, they have, that's where Whose Line Is It Anyway is still.

02:13:32.500 --> 02:13:33.500
Oh, cool.

02:13:33.500 --> 02:13:35.500
They do have that. They do have that, right? That's still going, right?

02:13:35.500 --> 02:13:40.500
Ayesha Tyler just does it now, right? So, I think that's all on CW, so.

02:13:40.500 --> 02:13:45.500
JD points out CW has Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, and that show is amazing.

02:13:45.500 --> 02:13:52.500
That show, we watched it on Netflix, that show is fucking hilarious. Like, it's a brilliant show.

02:13:52.500 --> 02:13:57.500
Everybody's telling me I need to watch 13 Reasons Why on Netflix, but apparently it's super fucking depressing.

02:13:57.500 --> 02:14:03.500
I would watch Crazy Ex-Girlfriend. They break out in the musical numbers in every episode, and it's hilarious.

02:14:03.500 --> 02:14:09.500
I mean, it's actually very well written. It's a show that my wife watches in, but it is very entertaining.

02:14:09.500 --> 02:14:11.500
The comedy writing is just really good in it.

02:14:11.500 --> 02:14:15.500
Alright, we'll dish on Netflix and TV for a bit, but if you want to steer us back to video games,

02:14:15.500 --> 02:14:17.500
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

02:14:17.500 --> 02:14:21.500
I started watching a show, you guys are going to tease me, but I don't give a fuck.

02:14:21.500 --> 02:14:27.500
I got turned onto this because they never shut up about it on the RuPaul podcast that he does with Michelle Visage,

02:14:27.500 --> 02:14:32.500
and it's a show called Schitt's Creek, which I guess is big in Canada, but they...

02:14:32.500 --> 02:14:34.500
Yeah, we watched that too, yeah.

02:14:34.500 --> 02:14:39.500
They show it on TV Guide Channel here, I think, but it's more of, well, it's Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara,

02:14:39.500 --> 02:14:41.500
so it's the SCTV people, right?

02:14:41.500 --> 02:14:42.500
It's pretty funny, actually.

02:14:42.500 --> 02:14:44.500
Yeah, that show was fucking funny!

02:14:44.500 --> 02:14:47.500
Yeah, so that was something I got into on Netflix recently.

02:14:47.500 --> 02:14:50.500
I forget the premise, I mean, I sort of remember the premise, it's like something happens...

02:14:50.500 --> 02:14:57.500
It's the richest to rags show that's been done a million times before, but it's being done with Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara.

02:14:57.500 --> 02:15:04.500
Yeah, apparently they were super rich, and as a joke, they bought a town, and it was Schitt's Creek, I guess,

02:15:04.500 --> 02:15:11.500
and so they just, as a joke, they ended up having to move there because they lost their money from some sort of tax thing.

02:15:11.500 --> 02:15:19.500
Yes, that is the premise of the show, but again, it's funny because Catherine O'Hara, she's so fucking funny in everything I see her in,

02:15:19.500 --> 02:15:26.500
and it's also, you know what, it's not just SCTV, but those guys are always in the Christopher Guest movies,

02:15:26.500 --> 02:15:31.500
like Waiting for Guffman, what was the one about the dog show? Best in Show?

02:15:31.500 --> 02:15:32.500
Best in Show, yeah.

02:15:33.500 --> 02:15:38.500
His movies go back to Spinal Tap, but I don't think these other guys started showing up until later on,

02:15:38.500 --> 02:15:45.500
and again, those movies are really, really fucking funny. I think there's actually a new one on Netflix I never watched.

02:15:45.500 --> 02:15:51.500
There's one called Mascots or something, it's about like football mascots or something that's out there.

02:15:51.500 --> 02:15:54.500
I think I need to watch that still, but that stuff is all really funny.

02:15:55.500 --> 02:15:58.500
Looking at some TV recommendations and chat.

02:15:58.500 --> 02:16:03.500
All right, sure, you guys want to talk TV? Why not? Nobody's calling in tonight. I guess it is a holiday.

02:16:03.500 --> 02:16:08.500
William Ritterface in chat says, The Magicians is great. I saw that, I saw that in the list.

02:16:09.500 --> 02:16:16.500
Come on, Noel Gus says, Oh, you should watch Class on BBC America. It's a young adult spinoff of Doctor Who,

02:16:16.500 --> 02:16:22.500
but it has a really well done gay couple arc. I already binged the series online because it already aired in the UK.

02:16:22.500 --> 02:16:25.500
That's cool. Doctor Who isn't on Netflix anymore, did you know that?

02:16:25.500 --> 02:16:26.500
No, I didn't necessarily.

02:16:26.500 --> 02:16:31.500
I didn't realize they took that off. Netflix is always getting rid of shit that I want to see,

02:16:31.500 --> 02:16:37.500
but then random shit that I was like, Oh, I didn't know this was on Netflix shows up like Finding Dory.

02:16:37.500 --> 02:16:40.500
I was like Gremlins. Gremlins, yeah, showed up.

02:16:40.500 --> 02:16:41.500
Yeah, Finding Dory.

02:16:41.500 --> 02:16:43.500
Star Trek's back. All the Star Trek's are back.

02:16:43.500 --> 02:16:49.500
They get all the new Disney stuff, so like you'll see all the new Disney movies, like Moana will probably be on there pretty soon.

02:16:49.500 --> 02:16:50.500
That's good.

02:16:51.500 --> 02:16:56.500
Well, I'm sure they'll be the next thing that my kids binge, but like, yeah, they have all sorts of weird stuff,

02:16:56.500 --> 02:17:01.500
but then like sometimes something they have doesn't make any sense, like Kung Fu Panda and Kung Fu Panda 3.

02:17:01.500 --> 02:17:07.500
It's like, where's Kung Fu Panda 2? Sorry, there's no Kung Fu Panda 2 for you, but you can get one or three.

02:17:07.500 --> 02:17:11.500
It's like two doesn't exist. It's like, I want to watch two.

02:17:12.500 --> 02:17:15.500
Was that, was that where I started binge watching?

02:17:15.500 --> 02:17:20.500
Because I'm looking in chat over Act F says Rob Roberts blamed BBC for that.

02:17:20.500 --> 02:17:26.500
Was Netflix where I started binge watching the Crystal Maze or was that just a YouTube?

02:17:26.500 --> 02:17:30.500
Maybe that was a YouTube hole I fell down, not maybe it was a crystal maze.

02:17:30.500 --> 02:17:31.500
Okay, it was like this game show.

02:17:31.500 --> 02:17:35.500
So our listeners overseas are going to fucking know what I'm talking about, but it was never here.

02:17:35.500 --> 02:17:37.500
But what can I compare it to?

02:17:37.500 --> 02:17:42.500
Like, okay, it was like a, it was like kind of, I think it was like a kids-ish game show that would,

02:17:42.500 --> 02:17:44.500
I don't think it was just our kids, I think it was like 20-somethings.

02:17:44.500 --> 02:17:51.500
But it's like they actually went through this, like the studio was set up as like an actual maze

02:17:51.500 --> 02:17:55.500
where like some of it would be a jungle and they would have to solve puzzles in all these rooms

02:17:55.500 --> 02:17:59.500
and the puzzles that they solve gives them time in the chamber at the end

02:17:59.500 --> 02:18:02.500
where they have to grab as many gold tickets as they can.

02:18:02.500 --> 02:18:06.500
And like, so it's like akin to, I'm trying to think, maybe like Legends of the Hidden Temple or something

02:18:06.500 --> 02:18:08.500
I thought we did have that show here.

02:18:08.500 --> 02:18:10.500
No, we didn't. We didn't.

02:18:10.500 --> 02:18:15.500
And it was hosted by Richard O'Brien, which was like the other thing he did besides Rock Your Picture Show

02:18:15.500 --> 02:18:17.500
was he was the host of that show.

02:18:17.500 --> 02:18:23.500
And so I don't know how the fuck I felt, no, one of my friends that lives over in Britain

02:18:23.500 --> 02:18:25.500
is obsessed with it and told me to watch it one night.

02:18:25.500 --> 02:18:30.500
And so I did, I thought I found it on Netflix, maybe it was YouTube, and I just found out it well

02:18:30.500 --> 02:18:34.500
and I started watching these episodes and I was like, I would have been obsessed with this fucking show

02:18:34.500 --> 02:18:36.500
if it was around when I was a kid, but we didn't have it here.

02:18:36.500 --> 02:18:40.500
I mean, but we had like, I think, yeah, like Legends of the Hidden Temple is probably the closest thing we had to it.

02:18:40.500 --> 02:18:42.500
And Fun House.

02:18:42.500 --> 02:18:45.500
Maybe Fun House, but like, Fun House was that super sloppy shit.

02:18:45.500 --> 02:18:48.500
And that wasn't like, Crystal Maze wasn't really that.

02:18:48.500 --> 02:18:54.500
So, that's not dignified. This is a British television show, lowkey.

02:18:54.500 --> 02:18:57.500
Anyway, let's see, going to our chat over it.

02:18:57.500 --> 02:19:01.500
Oh, the other one I watched too, Samurai Gourmet, have you seen that one?

02:19:01.500 --> 02:19:07.500
I think that's what it's called. It's like, it's a Japanese show about this guy who retired, he's like, retired.

02:19:07.500 --> 02:19:15.500
And he goes around eating food at these different Japanese locations and fantasizing about his life if he was a samurai and stuff.

02:19:15.500 --> 02:19:20.500
It's kind of, it's interesting, it's different, but very relaxing.

02:19:20.500 --> 02:19:23.500
Rama in chat says, Samurai Gourmet is so good.

02:19:23.500 --> 02:19:27.500
Tigerclaw in chat says, Legends of the Hidden Temple was made into a movie for Nickelodeon.

02:19:27.500 --> 02:19:29.500
Yeah, I heard about that.

02:19:30.500 --> 02:19:34.500
Didn't they do another one of their 90's shows as a movie, too?

02:19:34.500 --> 02:19:35.500
Like, I feel like...

02:19:35.500 --> 02:19:38.500
Yeah, they did. Well, they have the whole Invader Zim.

02:19:38.500 --> 02:19:40.500
Are you Afraid of the Dark? Is that the one that they did?

02:19:40.500 --> 02:19:45.500
They did a movie for that a long time ago, but Invader Zim, they just announced that they're bringing that back as a movie.

02:19:45.500 --> 02:19:48.500
Which I'm like, God dammit, why can't it be a series?

02:19:48.500 --> 02:19:52.500
But John and Vasquez is on there, so I'm like, fuck yes, I'm down.

02:19:53.500 --> 02:19:56.500
And then they did the whole, what was it?

02:19:56.500 --> 02:19:59.500
Rocko's Modern Life, I think, had a movie that they did.

02:19:59.500 --> 02:20:01.500
When's Doug the movie?

02:20:01.500 --> 02:20:06.500
Probably not too far away. I mean, I don't know.

02:20:06.500 --> 02:20:09.500
I just have to say this, since we're talking about old shows.

02:20:09.500 --> 02:20:12.500
This is my last call for phone calls. If nobody calls in, then nobody calls in.

02:20:12.500 --> 02:20:14.500
Orange Lounge Radio, all onward on Skype.

02:20:14.500 --> 02:20:20.500
I was going to say with the TV shows, we're like only two weeks away from Twin Peaks Season 3.

02:20:20.500 --> 02:20:23.500
And like, oh my God, it's finally here.

02:20:23.500 --> 02:20:30.500
Like after all this waiting, 25 plus years later, Twin Peaks Season 3 is coming.

02:20:30.500 --> 02:20:35.500
I don't think they're calling it that, they're just calling it Twin Peaks or whatever, but it's Twin Peaks Season 3.

02:20:35.500 --> 02:20:38.500
I'm so fucking pumped for that.

02:20:38.500 --> 02:20:41.500
I don't even have showtime though, so I guess I'll have to...

02:20:41.500 --> 02:20:44.500
Isn't it like a bonus option on Hulu or something?

02:20:44.500 --> 02:20:46.500
I'm going to have to figure out how I'm going to watch that online.

02:20:46.500 --> 02:20:48.500
So, anyway.

02:20:48.500 --> 02:20:51.500
Loki, any last minute stories with video games?

02:20:51.500 --> 02:20:54.500
Yeah, so there's a couple things.

02:20:54.500 --> 02:21:00.500
First off, I know we don't really give a shit, but Konami is doing another patiche slot for Castlevania.

02:21:00.500 --> 02:21:07.500
So, let me give a shout out real quick to our buddies over at GameBui.org,

02:21:07.500 --> 02:21:12.500
because they just did a live show yesterday in celebration of I think five years of doing their show.

02:21:12.500 --> 02:21:14.500
Yeah, believe it or not.

02:21:14.500 --> 02:21:16.500
Makes me feel old.

02:21:16.500 --> 02:21:18.500
But yeah, they did a live show yesterday.

02:21:18.500 --> 02:21:23.500
But I listened to their last broadcast show where Spike was talking about his trip that he took to Japan.

02:21:23.500 --> 02:21:25.500
And if you guys haven't heard it, it's definitely worth checking out.

02:21:25.500 --> 02:21:27.500
Again, it's over at GameBui.org.

02:21:27.500 --> 02:21:30.500
And Spike was talking about his trip to Japan, and he was talking about how,

02:21:30.500 --> 02:21:34.500
as much as we kind of laugh about the pachiko slot thing here,

02:21:34.500 --> 02:21:40.500
in Japan, you see those things a lot more places.

02:21:40.500 --> 02:21:45.500
So the fact that a company kind of pours its resources into that makes a lot more sense.

02:21:45.500 --> 02:21:48.500
We laugh at it, because here it's a fucking novelty.

02:21:48.500 --> 02:21:51.500
You don't even really see legit pachinko machines anywhere here.

02:21:51.500 --> 02:21:55.500
It's just, you know, maybe you'll see something inspired by it, Dave and Busters.

02:21:55.500 --> 02:21:59.500
But anyway, we do have a phone call coming in here at the last minute.

02:21:59.500 --> 02:22:01.500
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

02:22:01.500 --> 02:22:02.500
Hey, this is Akdeaf.

02:22:02.500 --> 02:22:05.500
Hey, Akdeaf. Wait until the last minute. That's all right. What's on your mind, buddy?

02:22:05.500 --> 02:22:09.500
Yeah, sorry, I got kind of distracted by what you were talking about, but yeah.

02:22:09.500 --> 02:22:11.500
Fair enough.

02:22:11.500 --> 02:22:16.500
Well, anyways, Kirby's 25th anniversary.

02:22:16.500 --> 02:22:19.500
Oh, that's right! That was all part of the Nintendo Direct!

02:22:19.500 --> 02:22:23.500
How could we forget to shout that out, Akdeaf? I'm glad you're here to remind us.

02:22:23.500 --> 02:22:25.500
What were your thoughts on all that?

02:22:25.500 --> 02:22:32.500
Well, it's pretty amazing. At least from what we saw in the Direct,

02:22:32.500 --> 02:22:38.500
we were getting three games, three Kirby games this year, so that's pretty awesome.

02:22:38.500 --> 02:22:43.500
I'm still kind of surprised, though, that they're making so many big games for the 3DS.

02:22:43.500 --> 02:22:46.500
I really thought that system was going to be on its way out the door,

02:22:46.500 --> 02:22:50.500
but I guess maybe I was trying to eulogize it too fast.

02:22:50.500 --> 02:22:53.500
It seems like there's still at least another year's worth of games coming out on the 3DS.

02:22:53.500 --> 02:22:58.500
I mean, not just the cold-step thing, but that's just localizing a game that came out like a year ago in Japan.

02:22:58.500 --> 02:23:02.500
But, you know, obviously this Kirby thing, one of those that I know they were showing was on the 3DS.

02:23:02.500 --> 02:23:08.500
The 2D Pikmin game or whatever they were showing to us, it seems like there's still some pretty big titles over there on 3DS.

02:23:08.500 --> 02:23:10.500
But, yay, Kirby!

02:23:10.500 --> 02:23:20.500
Yeah, I was actually surprised that Kirby wasn't getting a Switch game and is getting a new multiplayer game on the 3DS.

02:23:20.500 --> 02:23:27.500
Well, wait. You know, Kirby's probably focusing on 3DS for now because Mario's going to get the push this holiday.

02:23:27.500 --> 02:23:31.500
But don't rule anything out for next year or the year after.

02:23:31.500 --> 02:23:37.500
Yeah, most probably we'll see a Kirby Switch game sooner rather than later.

02:23:37.500 --> 02:23:46.500
But, yeah, like you were saying, the 3DS is getting a lot of games and it's really surprising that it's still getting a lot of love.

02:23:46.500 --> 02:23:49.500
Not only from Nintendo, but from other companies too.

02:23:49.500 --> 02:23:55.500
In some ways it's almost a little frustrating because I kind of just want them all to move to Switch.

02:23:55.500 --> 02:24:04.500
But, look, the guys that were here earlier talked about for their game that they were making, the Little Tanks game, that it took them two years to do that.

02:24:04.500 --> 02:24:08.500
And that's pretty custom for any game that's out there being developed.

02:24:08.500 --> 02:24:10.500
Shit, some of them take up to five years to develop.

02:24:10.500 --> 02:24:20.500
Realistically, sometimes you start developing a game on 3DS and it's like, we're still going to release on this platform because we've been developing for it.

02:24:20.500 --> 02:24:23.500
We didn't know the Switch was going to take off as fast as it did. This was our target.

02:24:23.500 --> 02:24:32.500
I actually felt bad because one of the guys that was doing a talk at the Sac Indie Arcade that we were doing on Saturday, last Saturday, he just had his game release on Wii U.

02:24:32.500 --> 02:24:39.500
And I couldn't help but think, oh, but are people still checking their Wii Us and all that stuff?

02:24:39.500 --> 02:24:42.500
I would want to talk to that guy more about that.

02:24:42.500 --> 02:24:50.500
But I'm sure, in his mind, when they started developing that game, they didn't know that the Wii U was going to fucking just croak once the Switch came out.

02:24:50.500 --> 02:24:56.500
Even Nintendo just croaked because there's still a lot of people that own Wii Us that probably aren't jumping on board.

02:24:56.500 --> 02:25:03.500
But here's the thing. Here's the telltale sign for me. Nintendo didn't say a goddamn thing in that direct about Wii U.

02:25:03.500 --> 02:25:09.500
And I didn't expect them to. But they were still talking about 3DS. They didn't say a goddamn thing about Wii U.

02:25:09.500 --> 02:25:13.500
So Wii U is as good as gone, as far as Nintendo's concerned.

02:25:13.500 --> 02:25:17.500
Zelda was the swung song. That's it.

02:25:18.500 --> 02:25:25.500
Considering Nintendo isn't producing any more Wii U, so yeah. That's something to consider too.

02:25:25.500 --> 02:25:31.500
JD does bring up a good point in our chat that's worth mentioning though. 400K bought Zelda for the Wii U.

02:25:31.500 --> 02:25:34.500
So those people are still going to be actively using their Wii U because they bought Zelda.

02:25:34.500 --> 02:25:37.500
So maybe things aren't as bad as they are in my head.

02:25:37.500 --> 02:25:42.500
Because in my head I'm thinking, oh, well all these fucking people are upgrading to the Switch.

02:25:42.500 --> 02:25:49.500
But even our own Dark Sakura, her and Dan didn't do that. They've been enjoying Zelda on the Wii U. Shit, so has Loki.

02:25:49.500 --> 02:25:53.500
So I guess maybe perspective warps things sometimes, I suppose.

02:25:54.500 --> 02:26:08.500
Yeah, most probably because even though the Switch isn't that terribly hard to get to buy, many people don't have probably the money to make the upgrade.

02:26:08.500 --> 02:26:09.500
That's true.

02:26:09.500 --> 02:26:16.500
So yeah, I also know a lot of people that got the Wii U version because they couldn't afford the Switch, so yeah.

02:26:16.500 --> 02:26:32.500
Did you guys hear though there's already rumors, internet rumors, but I've got to mention there's already rumors that Nintendo is planning a Switch Mini for kids basically because the Switch as it is is kind of a bulky handheld.

02:26:32.500 --> 02:26:37.500
I mean, I could see that. I don't know if a kid would walk around with one of those things.

02:26:37.500 --> 02:26:47.500
So that they're eyeing doing a Switch Mini, but that this Mini, this is where the rumor kind of starts to lose me a little bit is that this Mini would have additional technology inside it basically.

02:26:47.500 --> 02:26:58.500
And this is where I start to kind of go, hmm, I don't know if I see, I mean, true, they did it with the new 3DS, but this fast? This fast?

02:26:58.500 --> 02:26:59.500
Yeah, I don't know.

02:27:00.500 --> 02:27:05.500
I would be a little disappointed, and I don't want that. If they're going to put better technology in it, don't make it smaller.

02:27:05.500 --> 02:27:12.500
How are you going to make a Switch Mini when the controllers are the same height as the screen without reducing the size of the screen?

02:27:12.500 --> 02:27:16.500
I guess unless you increase, you make the bezel bigger, but what's the point then?

02:27:16.500 --> 02:27:24.500
Yeah, I don't know. So again, it's just a rumor, so don't go crazy with it, but you know, it did kind of have me thinking like, wow, would Nintendo really do something like that?

02:27:24.500 --> 02:27:33.500
But I just don't think, even if they did, I really just couldn't see it happening this year. I really feel like holiday, they're going to pour everything they have into moving as many Switches as possible.

02:27:33.500 --> 02:27:42.500
But at this, maybe at this point, they're already a success. I think maybe even Nintendo wasn't prepared to have sold as many Switches as they have.

02:27:42.500 --> 02:27:46.500
It seems like they always underestimate themselves. I don't know. I don't know.

02:27:46.500 --> 02:27:49.500
Alright, well Act F, we're going to let you go, but thanks for the call. It was great.

02:27:49.500 --> 02:27:51.500
Hey, thanks for having me.

02:27:51.500 --> 02:27:54.500
No problem, and I hope those Kirby games come out soon, and they're great.

02:27:54.500 --> 02:28:00.500
Well, there's already one available, so yeah. I've been playing that.

02:28:00.500 --> 02:28:04.500
Did they stealth release that? Like, they just released it right after the Direct? I didn't miss that.

02:28:04.500 --> 02:28:12.500
Yeah, because, this is going to be quick. Two of the games they announced, there were mini games on Planet Robobot.

02:28:12.500 --> 02:28:15.500
So they pretty much expanded on those.

02:28:15.500 --> 02:28:18.500
Got it, got it. I thought for some reason they were separate.

02:28:18.500 --> 02:28:22.500
Yeah, Team Kirby Deluxe Clash is free to play.

02:28:22.500 --> 02:28:29.500
And there is microtransactions and all that, but you don't have to pay anything if you don't want to.

02:28:29.500 --> 02:28:32.500
And you can enjoy the game pretty much completely.

02:28:32.500 --> 02:28:33.500
Okay, cool.

02:28:33.500 --> 02:28:34.500
It's pretty cool.

02:28:34.500 --> 02:28:36.500
Well, thanks for the heads up.

02:28:36.500 --> 02:28:38.500
I'll talk about that another time.

02:28:38.500 --> 02:28:41.500
I like free, so I'll check that out on 3DS. Thanks for the heads up.

02:28:43.500 --> 02:28:44.500
Well, see you.

02:28:44.500 --> 02:28:45.500
Alright, take care buddy.

02:28:46.500 --> 02:28:50.500
Alright, I guess that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight because nobody else was calling in.

02:28:50.500 --> 02:28:51.500
So we're going to close that down.

02:28:51.500 --> 02:28:53.500
But if you do think of something after the fact, you can always email us.

02:28:53.500 --> 02:28:57.500
Participate at OrangeLoungeTrader.com is the place to send us an email.

02:28:57.500 --> 02:29:00.500
Loki, any other last minute stories for us tonight?

02:29:00.500 --> 02:29:03.500
Yeah, so there's a couple of funny things.

02:29:03.500 --> 02:29:14.500
So first one is actually Nintendo is offering bounties now for hackers to find exploits in the 3DS and the Switch.

02:29:14.500 --> 02:29:19.500
And they're willing to pay, I guess, upwards from $100,000 to $20,000.

02:29:19.500 --> 02:29:24.500
And I guess three hackers have already kind of contributed towards this.

02:29:24.500 --> 02:29:26.500
So they have that right now.

02:29:26.500 --> 02:29:31.500
Is this how they're going to combat the hacker things when it comes to the classic NES version 2?

02:29:31.500 --> 02:29:35.500
I guess. I mean, I don't know.

02:29:35.500 --> 02:29:40.500
And then, of course, there's this kind of funny thing.

02:29:40.500 --> 02:29:47.500
So there's this guy that was a fan of the Touhou Shmup series.

02:29:47.500 --> 02:29:57.500
So he developed, as kind of a fun little project, a ransomware malware that basically would force you to...

02:29:57.500 --> 02:30:00.500
He called it, was it Ransomware?

02:30:00.500 --> 02:30:05.500
Because it was based off of the Touhou games and ransomware.

02:30:05.500 --> 02:30:20.500
And so what it would force you to do is it would lock you access to your files unless you were able to play through unidentified fantastic object on lunatic difficulty and score 200 million points.

02:30:20.500 --> 02:30:27.500
Which basically even the guy who made this malware thing can't do.

02:30:27.500 --> 02:30:28.500
It's not nice.

02:30:28.500 --> 02:30:34.500
But he uploaded it because it was kind of a funny... He wasn't trying to infect computers.

02:30:34.500 --> 02:30:37.500
It was just like, hey, look at this silly project because I love this game.

02:30:37.500 --> 02:30:39.500
Of course, some people already infected their computers with it.

02:30:39.500 --> 02:30:44.500
And so he actually released a patch to unlock your computer.

02:30:44.500 --> 02:30:45.500
Okay. All right.

02:30:45.500 --> 02:30:52.500
But ransomware is definitely kind of a high-fatal malware.

02:30:53.500 --> 02:31:00.500
But I made it for a joke and just laughing with people who like Touhou project series.

02:31:00.500 --> 02:31:01.500
All right.

02:31:01.500 --> 02:31:02.500
All right.

02:31:02.500 --> 02:31:06.500
Well, I think that's going to bring us to the end of another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:31:06.500 --> 02:31:08.500
But thank you guys for joining us this week.

02:31:08.500 --> 02:31:13.500
Thanks to our pals from Lead Money Games who came here this week to talk about Lil' Tanks.

02:31:13.500 --> 02:31:15.500
Hope you all check that out on Steam.

02:31:15.500 --> 02:31:20.500
Next week on the show, actually, we're going to have another guest with us.

02:31:20.500 --> 02:31:21.500
I like this.

02:31:21.500 --> 02:31:23.500
All of a sudden, we're getting these indie developers here on the show.

02:31:23.500 --> 02:31:24.500
So this is cool.

02:31:24.500 --> 02:31:28.500
This one will be by Skype, though, because he's on the other coast.

02:31:28.500 --> 02:31:35.500
But we're going to be joined by Zircon, who is behind Tangledeep, which is a game that is just...

02:31:35.500 --> 02:31:38.500
I think they're just wrapping up their Kickstarter in the next couple of days.

02:31:38.500 --> 02:31:40.500
He's also a fucking amazing musician.

02:31:40.500 --> 02:31:42.500
Yeah. So he's going to be here on the show.

02:31:42.500 --> 02:31:43.500
So that'll be awesome.

02:31:43.500 --> 02:31:44.500
That's pretty awesome.

02:31:44.500 --> 02:31:45.500
So we can talk about Tangledeep.

02:31:45.500 --> 02:31:47.500
And, Loki, we'll talk about the music as well.

02:31:47.500 --> 02:31:49.500
Yes. I knew he was working on the game.

02:31:49.500 --> 02:31:50.500
That's pretty awesome.

02:31:50.500 --> 02:31:52.500
Yeah. He is a fucking amazing artist.

02:31:52.500 --> 02:31:54.500
Well, you can fanboy next week, then, a little bit.

02:31:54.500 --> 02:31:58.500
In fact, just to mention, one of his songs, actually...

02:31:58.500 --> 02:32:01.500
Well, probably, I'm sure a few of his songs have made it into Cage Match.

02:32:01.500 --> 02:32:02.500
He did that.

02:32:02.500 --> 02:32:05.500
It was a Final Fantasy remix that I put in.

02:32:05.500 --> 02:32:09.500
That was a Zircon thing that he did on Cage Match one time.

02:32:09.500 --> 02:32:10.500
Wow. Okay. That's cool.

02:32:10.500 --> 02:32:14.500
But, yeah, he used to do a lot of stuff on OC Remix, so it'll be cool.

02:32:14.500 --> 02:32:16.500
All right. Well, I'm looking forward to that.

02:32:16.500 --> 02:32:18.500
So that will be next week on the show.

02:32:18.500 --> 02:32:21.500
So we'll tweet more about that as we come up on the next OLR.

02:32:21.500 --> 02:32:22.500
Very awesome.

02:32:22.500 --> 02:32:26.500
Unfortunately, since we had the guys from Little Tanks here this week,

02:32:26.500 --> 02:32:29.500
I couldn't get him on this week when his Kickstarter is still going.

02:32:29.500 --> 02:32:31.500
So I want to make sure it gets a shout-out now.

02:32:31.500 --> 02:32:34.500
If you want to check this out, go check that out.

02:32:34.500 --> 02:32:36.500
Again, that game is called Tangledeep.

02:32:36.500 --> 02:32:42.500
You can check that out over at the Twitter, it's Tangledeep Game.

02:32:42.500 --> 02:32:46.500
And I'm sure you can find all the links to the Kickstarter and all that stuff.

02:32:46.500 --> 02:32:48.500
Because I think there's just a couple more days left on that.

02:32:48.500 --> 02:32:51.500
So by the time he's here on the show, that will be all wrapped up.

02:32:51.500 --> 02:32:53.500
But we can at least ask questions about how it went

02:32:53.500 --> 02:32:56.500
and, you know, any lessons he learned from that and all that stuff.

02:32:56.500 --> 02:32:58.500
Well, he's done a Kickstarter project back some of his

02:32:58.500 --> 02:33:00.500
because he had some albums that came out.

02:33:00.500 --> 02:33:02.500
But never a game, right? This is his first game.

02:33:02.500 --> 02:33:03.500
This is his first game, yeah.

02:33:03.500 --> 02:33:05.500
That's what I thought. All right, awesome.

02:33:05.500 --> 02:33:07.500
So that is next week on the show.

02:33:07.500 --> 02:33:11.500
But, meanwhile, hopefully, Dar Sakura will be back here next week.

02:33:11.500 --> 02:33:12.500
And, Loki, you should be here too.

02:33:12.500 --> 02:33:15.500
The gang will be all here for our next episode.

02:33:15.500 --> 02:33:17.500
As always, at the end of an episode of Orange Laundry at O,

02:33:17.500 --> 02:33:20.500
I'd like to tell you guys to please help us spread the word,

02:33:20.500 --> 02:33:21.500
tell a friend or five about the show,

02:33:21.500 --> 02:33:23.500
because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

02:33:23.500 --> 02:33:26.500
But if the voices aren't out there, we can't air them.

02:33:26.500 --> 02:33:31.500
So we really appreciate all the folks that help bring their friends

02:33:31.500 --> 02:33:33.500
and even their enemies to the show.

02:33:33.500 --> 02:33:35.500
If you are having a problem with the word-of-mouth stuff,

02:33:35.500 --> 02:33:37.500
you can always leave a five-star review.

02:33:37.500 --> 02:33:41.500
Trust me, guys, a five-star review on a place like iTunes goes a long frickin' way.

02:33:41.500 --> 02:33:44.500
If you're not an iTunes person, then wherever you found this podcast,

02:33:44.500 --> 02:33:50.500
like the Google Store or wherever this show may have found its way to your inbox,

02:33:50.500 --> 02:33:53.500
please leave us a nice review. It would help an awful lot.

02:33:53.500 --> 02:33:56.500
That is going to do it, though, for the show this week,

02:33:56.500 --> 02:33:59.500
but we can't wrap it up until we get to everybody's final thought.

02:33:59.500 --> 02:34:02.500
And, Loki, I'll start with you tonight. Your final thought.

02:34:02.500 --> 02:34:07.500
I'm going to hopefully finish my 3D printer either, I'm guessing, probably tomorrow,

02:34:07.500 --> 02:34:13.500
because I still have a bit to do and debugging and all that fun stuff.

02:34:13.500 --> 02:34:16.500
So hopefully we'll get something printed this week,

02:34:16.500 --> 02:34:20.500
and then we'll have to talk about the bro-programming.

02:34:20.500 --> 02:34:22.500
Yes, we will. Yes, we will.

02:34:22.500 --> 02:34:26.500
And who knows? Maybe Jamie will end up getting involved in that,

02:34:26.500 --> 02:34:28.500
because girls can be bros, too. There's nothing wrong with that.

02:34:28.500 --> 02:34:31.500
So maybe Jamie will get in on the bro-programming stuff, too.

02:34:31.500 --> 02:34:32.500
So we'll see.

02:34:32.500 --> 02:34:36.500
But anyway, my final thought this week is candy.

02:34:36.500 --> 02:34:40.500
Thank you to Alan for bringing me candy for tonight's show,

02:34:40.500 --> 02:34:42.500
because it's all raining and depressing outside,

02:34:42.500 --> 02:34:44.500
so I was like, I want candy. That'll make me feel better.

02:34:44.500 --> 02:34:47.500
And he brought me some of my favorites, Mike and Ike's, for the show.

02:34:47.500 --> 02:34:49.500
So shout-out to Mike and Ike's for being delicious,

02:34:49.500 --> 02:34:53.500
and shout-out to all the candy sales that'll be happening tomorrow,

02:34:53.500 --> 02:34:57.500
and less shout-out to the fact that they will be making me fluffier.

02:34:57.500 --> 02:34:59.500
But in the meantime, we'll see you in seven days

02:34:59.500 --> 02:35:01.500
for an all-new episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:35:01.500 --> 02:35:03.500
Until then, buh-bye.

02:35:03.500 --> 02:35:06.500
