00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Tonight, we're back from SAK Indie Arcade and have an interview with Lead Money Games, creators of Lil' Tanks, a side-scrolling shmup available now for all Steam platforms. This, along with as much gaming news as we can possibly fit, and it all starts right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 683 for this April the 16th of 2017. Happy Easter to you if you celebrate it. Happy all the candy is on sale tomorrow day if you don't.

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:07,000
My name is Rob Roberts. Here in Studio N7 in Sacramento, California, not with my co-hosts tonight, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. She sadly was not able to make it tonight. She had a little bit of last minute conflict that arose that she is currently de-conflicting.

7
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
But we will hear from her a little later in the show. Joining us though in studio, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

8
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Hello.

9
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Hi Loki, how are you?

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Good.

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm glad.

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Filling up.

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Your meal tonight, your meal of breadsticks, Carbolicious.

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Yes.

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
He has risen, the yeast has risen and created your breadsticks. Yes. I see how it goes.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So, okay, I noticed on Facebook that you got a new toy this past week that you talked about on the show before.

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Yes.

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So you got a 3D printer.

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Yes.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
What have you printed with it?

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I haven't printed anything with it because I haven't finished building it yet. So it's a 3D printer kit. So actually I'm putting it together.

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Is that like an IKEA thing? You have to build it all yourself?

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Sort of. If IKEA didn't have like full instructions and you had to go buy internet videos that also make mistakes and don't bother to edit their videos to fix the mistakes until afterwards like get four videos into it.

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Oh, you know, we really should have done that back in like step two. You know, that fun stuff.

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So, yeah, it's been fun. I pretty much have it assembled now. The only thing I'm working on, well, I'm starting to wire it up.

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:23,000
So I was tinning some wires before I left and hooking up the PCB and everything. But, yeah, it's been a lot of fun.

27
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:31,000
A lot of slow progress because like, was it one day I spent four hours trying to square the frame because it was wobbling.

28
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Well, good luck and I will be very curious to know what you do end up printing first on that thing.

29
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Well, I have purple and orange ABS that I purchased specifically.

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Oh, you got the VOG colors or the OLR colors?

31
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Exactly.

32
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Clearly you can make a keychain or something.

33
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Make something.

34
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Alright, make something, dammit. Alright, we're going to get to a lot. There's been quite a bit that's been going on in gaming this week. I know we weren't here last week.

35
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I hope you all had fun joining us at the SAC Indie Arcade event, which we had done on Saturday, which is why we ended up taking Sunday off.

36
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:08,000
We had a lot of fun with the event. A big, big thank you again to Sacramento IGDA for having us yet again this year.

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Another series of amazing speakers. They were all really good. I really love the patent and trademark talk, which I just be, I'm going to be transparent with you guys.

38
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,000
That's right when we had the power failure. So I'm really sad we might lose that talk because it was really good.

39
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
But everybody, there was a lot of great talks.

40
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I was going to say, stop being chats. There's so much to make a 3D printer, printable 3D printer. Well, to be honest, most 3D printers are 3D printable.

41
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You can print most of the parts to it and then the rest is all open source of like, so Maker Rail, stepper motors, and you can buy, you can pretty much build your own printer from parts you buy online.

42
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Well, I also see in chat over at live.vognetwork.com because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

43
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:02,000
6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackall show, I see SSU100Matt says, Travis Donovan has a 3D printer and has printed some Mass Effect stuff.

44
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Well, Travis Donovan would call this 3D printer printing 3D printers, recursive printing!

45
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
For those of you that ever listened to Understation Live, for the rest of you that haven't, that was an extremely inside joke. I apologize.

46
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Anyway, Tigerclaw in chat says, Loki could also print his own cosplay costume. You could. You could print your own Tingle outfit or whatever it is.

47
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I don't think Tingle has anything that's not spandex, so I don't think that would work. Can't print spandex on them.

48
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You can't print spandex! Take it back! It's useless. Alright. We have some guests here in the studio this week with us, joining us here, and I'm really happy to have these guys here tonight, especially because I know it's a holiday, so thank you guys so much for being here tonight.

49
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I want to introduce to you guys two of the guys, or I guess really, it's just the two of you with Lead Money Games, right? We have Andrew and Tony joining us tonight from Lead Money Games. Welcome to the show, you guys.

50
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Hi, how's it going?

51
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Hi, good!

52
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Thanks for having us.

53
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Yeah, no problem. Thanks for being here. So, you guys have just released your first game on Steam called Lil' Tanks. Congratulations!

54
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Thanks.

55
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:14,000
How does it feel knowing that it's out there now? It's like out in the world, your game. Is it a relief?

56
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Yeah, it is. I mean, it's just, we always thought that, you know, one day we'd get there, and now that one day actually happened, yeah, it feels pretty good. Like, we actually accomplished what we set out to do, so we're really happy.

57
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Yeah, it's really hard to believe that it's actually happened, and we're still actually working on the game for little patches and stuff like that, but it's been so long, and it's still weird to say that it's been launched.

58
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:53,000
So, when does the work start on Lil' Tanks 2? No, I'm kidding. Don't answer. All right, let's rewind a bit. I want to go back to the very beginning. So, you guys, this is the first game you guys have done independently, right?

59
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Correct.

60
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
So, where did this idea come from? Like, we're going to make a game. How was Lil' Tanks born?

61
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I think a lot of us, we're all working in the visual effects industry and all like to play games ourselves and just thought about different things we could do where we would have some creative control.

62
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And a lot of the work we do, you know, we get notes to make the shot look like this or make it look like this, and with our own project, we could make it look however we wanted to and really give us the freedom that a lot of our work in that particular industry didn't really provide.

63
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:35,000
So, that combined with the idea that we just love gaming, it just put two and two together.

64
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I hear you loud and clear on that because part of the reason OLR exists is because in college I was thinking at one point I was going to be a radio DJ, but then did you know that you have to say this and you have to do it this way?

65
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:53,000
And you have to do, there's so many lines you have to color in and that's just not who I am. And it sounds like maybe not who you guys are either.

66
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So, tell us a little bit about the game Lil' Tanks. Like, what is it? How would you describe it to somebody who's never played it?

67
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I would say it's like a side-scrolling shoot-em-up. So, you're a little tank and you drive around and destroy aliens.

68
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
And with this game though, I don't know about Tony, but I'm terrible at shoot-em-ups and bullet hell games.

69
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:23,000
So, we wanted to make something where if you were terrible at this game, as long as you kept playing it, then you would get better by the tank leveling up.

70
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:31,000
So, there's like some RPG elements in it where every single enemy you kill gives you a little bit of experience and every bit of experience helps you level up.

71
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:39,000
And when you level up, you get permanent upgrades to your tank. So, it makes it a lot easier to beat the level you're on and it's actually possible to beat this entire game.

72
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It just takes time and a little bit of grinding sometimes, but it's definitely possible to beat the game even if you're terrible.

73
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Yeah, that was one thing you guys were kind enough to let me check out the game a couple of weeks ago.

74
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And that was one thing I noticed right off the bat that kind of separated it for me from other bullet hell types of games.

75
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Well, for one, it runs the wrong way. The wrong way. I'm using my quote-y fingers.

76
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I mean, I guess there's game side-scrolling.

77
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:09,000
There is. I'm thinking, what's that Neo Geo game that's heavy metal? Is that it? Am I thinking of? Somebody in chat knows.

78
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Metal Slug?

79
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Is it? Nah, maybe Metal Slug. I don't know.

80
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
That's a little bit different. No, they have side-scroller shmups.

81
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
But most times when you think of bullet hell, you think of the vertical ones, right?

82
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Oh, yeah.

83
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Yeah, so this one runs horizontal, so it's a little different.

84
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
But one of the first things I noticed, I like that twist that you put on it, is that you have that progression in it.

85
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:35,000
So you feel like you're accomplishing something and it's like, oh, maybe this will allow me to get past that point I was stuck at previously now that I have XYZ type of power-ups.

86
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Yeah, yeah.

87
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
So where did that, where did that, was it just kind of like this is what I would want in a game?

88
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Or how did you, how did you get to that feature?

89
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I think just making the game straight out like a shoot-em-up was just too difficult.

90
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And I think I really love like role-playing games. I played a lot of like World of Warcraft, a lot of Final Fantasy when I was growing up.

91
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And I just love role-playing games and I wanted to make something, or we wanted to make something that would incorporate that into like a shoot-em-up, trying to make something different.

92
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And I think it just randomly kind of worked and we tried it and it was fun and we just went with it.

93
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Yeah. And I think in addition to that, it just, it seemed like it made perfect sense.

94
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Even other just like traditional shooters will have introduced things where you can get different weapons or just give you more room to customize.

95
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
And so it just seemed like it was a natural fit for it.

96
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I see some folks in chat are actually asking where the game is. They want to check this game out.

97
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
So let's tell them where to find it. It's on Steam right now, right? You can search for Lil' Tanks.

98
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Steam is the only place right now you can get it? Are you on any other stores?

99
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Yeah, we're trying to get it on other stores right now, but we're having a little bit of difficulty.

100
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:49,000
But if you just search for the game on Steam, it's L-I-L space T-A-N-K-S, just Lil' Tanks. It'll pop right up.

101
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Awesome. And then there's also a website, liltanksgame.com. Did I get that right?

102
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Yeah.

103
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,000
All right. You can also go there and check it out. You got the Twitter, you got Twitter, Facebook, all that stuff that a game studio has got to have for the game.

104
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I understand what you're saying. So I want to talk a little more about what you kind of went through to make this game.

105
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:14,000
So you guys were visual effects guys. So did you ever program a game before? Was this like how you were going to kind of learn to do it?

106
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Or how did you make that transition from visual effects to gaming programmer?

107
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Me personally, I did not have too much programming background.

108
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I mean, we had done, I had done some basic scripting working in visual effects, but as far as writing an entire program from scratch, that wasn't something I had really done.

109
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:47,000
But a lot of the resources available to learn this kind of thing. And because it was going to be our own project, I had a lot more motivation to learn it than I might have in another circumstance.

110
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:59,000
So for me, I always wanted to make video games when I was younger, but I went to Santa Rosa Junior College and tried to take some programming classes and quickly learned that I could not understand it.

111
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I couldn't get it and it was too difficult. So I actually went to art school instead of pursuing that career.

112
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:11,000
And then we ended up working together at DreamWorks and we used to always talk about video games and stuff.

113
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:20,000
But at DreamWorks, it was cool because you could do the work several ways. There's a way to do the work that's quickly done.

114
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:28,000
And then there's a way to do the work where you can go outside of the normal means and you can write Python scripts and have stuff automated.

115
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:35,000
And I always took the hard route because I hated, I didn't hate the job, but it was a lot of the stuff.

116
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
We always push ourselves to do better.

117
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Yeah, exactly.

118
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Now, you weren't responsible for the minions, were you?

119
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
No, no, no.

120
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Oh, thank God. All right.

121
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Illumination.

122
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Oh, good. I'm glad I'm fixing that.

123
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
DreamWorks is just a publisher.

124
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Okay. All right.

125
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
No, no.

126
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
My gosh. All right.

127
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
So I learned a lot of Python on the job, which is really cool at DreamWorks.

128
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:02,000
They actually give you classes on whatever you want to take, even though it doesn't quite relate to your profession or your department.

129
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
So I always would do that kind of stuff.

130
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,000
And then when we decided to make games, we had no experience making any type of game.

131
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:17,000
But I kind of knew the language of Python and it kind of transferred over to the engine we use, which is called GameMaker.

132
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
And it kind of was second nature.

133
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
And then we just watched millions of tutorials and got it to work.

134
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
That's outstanding.

135
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I mean, congrats, you guys, that your first game is of a quality where you can be selling it on Steam.

136
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
And, you know, that's amazing.

137
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Like, you know, like he can't finish a damn game.

138
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I tried. I tried.

139
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
And, you know, I see them with kids.

140
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I always pick.

141
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I believe this one does have kids.

142
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I have two kids and Tony has one kid.

143
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I try again.

144
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
They were not as annoying as my kids.

145
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
But no, no, to me, I always give him shit.

146
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
But to be fair, like I tried to, you know, we had some we had the guys.

147
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
What was the YouTube things that they made cooking with unity?

148
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
That was it, right?

149
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Yeah.

150
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
We had them on the show and I felt very empowered.

151
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I was like, fuck yeah, I'm going to do this.

152
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I'm going to learn how to do unity and I'm going to make my game.

153
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I have my concept for my game.

154
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Like I totally knew my game was going to still do that.

155
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I know.

156
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
And then I sat down and I tried to do it.

157
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I'm like, this is too hard.

158
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I'm serious.

159
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I can give you a tutorial that I know like Braxies is one I follow on YouTube quite a bit.

160
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
And he's got a really short one.

161
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It's a really polished looking game and it's short.

162
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
All right.

163
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
So you should do that.

164
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Try to do it.

165
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
That's what we need to do.

166
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Honest to God.

167
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
When I was doing together.

168
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
How about that?

169
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
We do.

170
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Let's do something together.

171
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
That's sweet.

172
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Cause then that'll motivate us.

173
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
We're going to brogram.

174
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
We're going to brogram a game together.

175
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I think I just.

176
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Hashtag.

177
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
This is where it pops up in the corner of our reality show.

178
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Hashtag brogram.

179
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Which Bobby says, now Rob will never finish a game too.

180
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Well, I, I already hadn't.

181
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
So, but you know what?

182
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I've been doing this podcast for 15 fucking years.

183
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
So you know what?

184
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
At least, at least I've done something, something.

185
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
All right.

186
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I love that.

187
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Here's the thing.

188
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I don't, I don't know how old you guys are.

189
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Probably not as old as me, but when I was younger, I was learning a Commodore 64 basic,

190
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
right?

191
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It was like the language back in the day.

192
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I love my Commodore 64.

193
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
And what you could do is you could type programs from the back of magazines.

194
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Right?

195
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
And so part of the way I would kind of learn about it is that you type program for the

196
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
back of the magazine.

197
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Do you like change one little thing and like, Oh, I'm going to make this a yellow color

198
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
instead of a blue color.

199
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
And it's like, yeah, I did that.

200
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
So that was kind of part of the way I learned.

201
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
So I think if I could take the same approach with something like unity or, or whatever

202
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
it is we decide to use in our programming event, then, um, then yeah, we can, I can,

203
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I could probably learn a lot easier, so we'll see.

204
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Anyway, sorry.

205
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I didn't mean to make it about us, but that happens here.

206
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I apologize.

207
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
But congrats.

208
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I mean, again, that's awesome that like, you guys were like, we want to make a game.

209
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
We have this idea and you, you learned how to program through all the videos and, and,

210
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
and, and came out with something that, you know, I've played and I can tell people is,

211
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
is a quality product.

212
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
It's not like, well, thanks.

213
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
You know, something, I don't know.

214
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
It's, it's not like a rush thing or something that seems like short sizes.

215
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
It's not, it's not a piece of shit.

216
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Yeah.

217
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
It's not a piece of shit.

218
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
It's not, I mean, that's, that's the easiest way to put it.

219
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Uh, considering a lot of stuff goes through, there's a lot of shit on steam.

220
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I don't know if you've looked.

221
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Yeah.

222
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Oh yeah.

223
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
All right.

224
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
It's nice to not be in that category, but I mean, you guys have your, your cut scenes

225
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
that you're doing, your, your game itself, this progression system that, you know, didn't

226
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
exist in games before.

227
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
That's, that's just fucking impressive.

228
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Congrats.

229
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
You know, I'm sure there's some people out there, not everybody's going to love your

230
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
game and there's always going to be haters out there, but you know, props to you guys

231
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
for accomplishing what you've done.

232
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
So yeah.

233
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Um, let me, uh, let me ask this.

234
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I want to ask about, uh, how long did it take to make this game through this process?

235
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
So you kind of had to learn this.

236
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
We weren't really doing it full time.

237
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Um, at first, cause we were trying to get like jobs and not, you know, do full time,

238
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
uh, game development, but, uh, it's been on and off about two years.

239
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Um, probably the last year has been full time.

240
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Right.

241
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Tony, do you think?

242
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Yeah.

243
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Just about, but it's about a two years work and then, um, we just finally released.

244
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
So, yeah.

245
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
So you guys actually went and I noticed you're actually wearing a shirt here.

246
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Uh, Tony's wearing a shirt that says little tanks funded by Kickstarter.

247
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
So you guys actually ran a Kickstarter campaign for this.

248
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Yeah, we did.

249
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Yeah.

250
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
And you, you were successful with your Kickstarter campaign for your brand new game of your brand

251
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
new studio.

252
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Do you, do you guys know how rare that is to succeed?

253
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I mean, congratulations.

254
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Thank you.

255
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
A big time with that.

256
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Uh, I don't mean to keep like talking you guys up, but I'm impressed.

257
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
The more that I hear about what went into this, I'm just like, wow, you guys really

258
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
like beat the odds to do this.

259
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,000
So the Kickstarter campaign, um, why, why did you have to go to Kickstarter?

260
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:52,000
So, uh, we're both artists, but we're not like the high level, um, artists that are

261
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
required to make like cinematics.

262
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
So what we really want to do is we wanted to, um, get some money so we could hire like

263
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
a cinematic artists and make us some, some screens so we can use them in the game.

264
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Um, cause we knew that we could probably make something, but it wouldn't be to that high

265
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
level quality that we really wanted.

266
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
So we had to go to Kickstarter to see if we could make it happen.

267
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Yeah.

268
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
It kind of came from that and we wanted to, uh, being at this, it was our first kind of

269
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:25,000
step out into the world of game development, have some help with the marketing, kind of

270
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
getting the word out there.

271
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
And it wasn't really an effort to fund the entire game.

272
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Just kind of like, like the final stretch, like this would help us the game.

273
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
We're happy with where it's at, but what we really, where we really want to get it to,

274
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
we need a little bit of help.

275
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
And so, okay.

276
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
And that's why I, and I looked at your, your goal for the Kickstarter was probably only

277
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
around like what, $5,000, which for a game developments relatively low.

278
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Yeah.

279
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
So, okay.

280
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
So I mean, I think that's, that's definitely a part of the reason I'm sure you guys are

281
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
successful is that, you know, since you already kind of had your product, it was just kind

282
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
of like, I need that last 10% push and the final polish on it.

283
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Yeah.

284
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I think that probably helped a lot where you were in this position where we didn't really

285
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
need like full funding for the game and we didn't want to, you know, ask for that.

286
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
We just wanted a little bit of help to get exactly what we wanted.

287
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
And we were lucky we put it solo and we weren't greedy about it because we weren't trying

288
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
to become rich off our Kickstarter.

289
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
We knew our game wasn't huge like that, but we need a little bit of help and it really

290
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
helps out.

291
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
No, congratulations.

292
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Yeah.

293
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
We just wanted to set a realistic goal.

294
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,000
And we know people when you're, when you're buying the game, even now when it's fully

295
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
released, you know, you're taking a little bit of a chance and when you're buying a game

296
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
that doesn't even fully exist yet, you know, you're really kind of like putting a little

297
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
bit of trust in us, even if, you know, throwing us a few dollars.

298
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
But it was important that we deliver what we are promising.

299
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Yeah.

300
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Yeah.

301
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Yeah.

302
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Well, again, congratulations.

303
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I mean, you guys made your Kickstarter.

304
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
You got your game out there.

305
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
That's, that's a great story.

306
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
And now that'll help that when you decide to do game number two, which I hope, you know,

307
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
you guys are thinking about someday, I know you want to see your little tanks with patches

308
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
to, to be fully realized and so forth, but you know, someday you guys will probably

309
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
want to do a second game and now you'll have that on your resume and that's something you

310
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
can take to the population out there as well.

311
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
So awesome.

312
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
So what would you say was like the biggest thing you guys learned from this whole experience

313
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
since you were new to game development at the time and you've gone, you've put this

314
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
out on Steam, you know, there might be people out there who are thinking of making their

315
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
own game someday.

316
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Maybe someday Loki will actually finish Time to Car or whatever he wants to work on.

317
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I'm not working on that anymore.

318
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I'm sorry, the canceled project.

319
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
It's time to cancel.

320
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Shelved.

321
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Shelved.

322
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
So, uh, what would you say was like the, the, uh, a big lesson, one big lesson you would,

323
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
you would tell other people you learned through this?

324
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Uh, one thing I could think of was just to try to plan every possible thing that you

325
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:53,000
can, because I don't know how far we were into developing the game when we, you know,

326
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
we need, when we realized we need to introduce just a pause feature and the way we're able

327
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:04,000
to implement it, we had to go back and edit every single, you know, thing we had done

328
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
so far.

329
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
So just trying to think out everything you're going to need to do in advance as much as

330
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
possible.

331
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I think, uh, for me it was, uh, originally the game was supposed to be a mobile game

332
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
and we wanted to make something really short and like test the waters.

333
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I was saying, Oh Tony, I could totally make this game in like six months.

334
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
We'll sell it, make some money and then we'll see how the game industry works and then we'll

335
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
make a really big game.

336
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
So originally this game was supposed to be like super small and quick, but it just took

337
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
over our lives and it ended up taking two years.

338
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
So my advice would be like, let's say if you are going to make a game, um, try to plan

339
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
small, but at the same time make something you really, really want to make because it

340
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
will take up a big chunk of your life just to make this game.

341
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000
So don't try to make something that you kind of like, make something you really love because

342
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
it's, it's always going to take a ton of time.

343
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Yeah, I think that's really solid advice.

344
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
If you guys have questions for lead money games, you can ask those in chat over at

345
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
live.vognetwork.com.

346
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Uh, we are in the chat of course, uh, live here on this Sunday evening.

347
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Uh, so if you have any questions for the guys here behind little tanks, lead money games,

348
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
uh, ask away in our chat and we'll get some of those out here.

349
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Let's talk about actually, cause we, we mentioned before the show, um, I was mispronouncing

350
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
the name of your studio.

351
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I had called it lead money games and I guess because I think tanks, I think metal, I think

352
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
lead, right?

353
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
But I guess it's actually lead money games, which first off, can we give props to voiceover

354
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,000
guy, Jason, by the way, who actually got the first time when you told me it was lead money

355
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
games.

356
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I was like, Oh shit.

357
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
And I went and listened to this week's intro and I was like, wow, Jason got it.

358
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
He got it.

359
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I didn't get it.

360
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
He got it.

361
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
So where's the name come from?

362
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,000
So, uh, when we worked at dreamworks, uh, Tony and I were both, uh, lead artists and,

363
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:49,000
uh, as a lead artist in our department, we, um, took on a ton of responsibilities and,

364
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
uh, way more than the average artists would do.

365
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
And, uh, we were in charge of a lot of shots and approving shots.

366
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,000
And then, um, at the end of the day, we made the same amount of money as everyone else.

367
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Um, so we always would joke around and say, Hey, um, Tony, you're going to buy a house

368
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
with all that lead money you just made.

369
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
And we would joke about it all the time.

370
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
And, uh, I think Tony was the one who came up with the name.

371
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
He's like, Oh, let's call our company lead money games.

372
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:21,000
And at one point we saw a website, um, uh, domain, it was lead money games, that cash

373
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
you tried to get, but it was too expensive or something.

374
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Okay.

375
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I seriously love that story.

376
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I won't fuck that name up again after hearing that.

377
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
That's a great story behind that.

378
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
So, um, tell us a little bit about some of the things you might be working on for the

379
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
games future.

380
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I understand you may not want to give away all your secrets, but what do people have

381
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
to look forward to, um, that, you know, cause we, I bet we have some people that might be

382
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
listening that already follow you guys and heard you were going to be on here tonight.

383
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
What are some of the things they might have to look forward to in future patches?

384
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Um, well, besides just like, we're going to try to tweak, uh, a few little things, gameplay

385
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
wise, just to try and balance things out.

386
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:01,000
But, uh, the, the main thing we're working on right now is going to be the addition of,

387
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
uh, two more stages.

388
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Um, one of the tiers on our Kickstarter was that you're able to design a stage from scratch.

389
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,000
You know, you select the location, enemies design, the boss, so on, so forth.

390
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,000
And so, uh, we're working with, uh, the, the couple of people that backed us at that tier

391
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,000
right now, and those are going to be made available, uh, as a patch, it's going to be

392
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
free content, not extra money or anything like that.

393
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
It's just going to be added right onto the game.

394
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Um, after that, maybe add a little bit more weapon variety, but we're still kind of playing

395
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
with ideas, but for sure, the two stages.

396
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Yeah.

397
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Like, uh, those one thing, like, um, we got some from some reviews are saying like the

398
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,800
last level is kind of a bummer.

399
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,400
The boss is super hard and it's difficult to get to that boss.

400
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,800
And then when you get there, it's difficult to beat the boss.

401
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,800
Maybe they need to get good.

402
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,800
Yeah.

403
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,800
That's what I think.

404
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,800
That's what Tony said.

405
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:56,800
But, uh, but actually we're going to try to make that stage more fun by check.

406
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,800
Talk about it.

407
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,800
Okay.

408
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:02,800
So we're, uh, our idea is we're going to have, um, so the last stage, instead of just driving

409
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:07,680
up to the boss and find the boss, we're introducing, uh, three new mini bosses, but we're going

410
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,260
to have them just one pop on randomly.

411
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:14,500
So it's randomly selected, uh, to start the level and then, uh, it's going to be just

412
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,260
like more fun than difficult.

413
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:20,420
And once you beat that enemy, uh, and once you'd be that boss, you'll get a ton of experience.

414
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:23,860
So instead of grinding out the fifth level over and over again, or six level over and

415
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:29,180
over again, instead, um, you could just play, uh, that the final level and it'll be different

416
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:33,620
almost every time you play and then, um, get that needed experience that to cap out.

417
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:37,080
So you have a better chance of, you know, defeating that last boss.

418
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,460
So hopefully it'll make it more fun that way.

419
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,460
Well, thank you.

420
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:41,180
I feel like we just got an exclusive there.

421
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,180
Awesome.

422
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,180
Awesome.

423
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,180
All right.

424
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,180
exclusive on OLR.

425
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,180
Awesome.

426
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,180
Uh, well, good, good luck with that.

427
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:49,940
That sounds, uh, I like that concept, like maybe the three little mini bosses that could

428
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:50,940
be randomized a little bit.

429
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:51,940
Okay.

430
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:52,940
That'd be cool.

431
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:55,740
Um, do you ever, this is something I've heard from some indie developers that is always

432
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:59,280
like a phenomenon, uh, especially when they put their first game out there in this day

433
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:03,180
and age that we live in, in 2017, maybe you have, or haven't experienced this yet.

434
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:05,420
Have you seen anybody live streaming your game?

435
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:09,900
Have you seen any of that feedback directly or YouTube or any of that stuff?

436
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:15,460
We have, um, luckily, uh, early on we found someone, uh, named high site and he does a

437
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:20,180
bunch of, uh, indie reviews where he plays the game for the first time on Twitch and

438
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:25,020
he streams it and he gives like live feedback and a bunch of people give feedback.

439
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:30,260
And um, we did that and it made us sweat like crazy and realize what we were doing wrong.

440
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:32,100
You know, it was great feedback at the start there.

441
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,100
Yeah.

442
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,100
But not too many people live streaming.

443
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,100
I don't think.

444
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:36,780
Yeah.

445
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:39,820
I mean, at that stage we were still, uh, fairly early on in development, but we got a lot

446
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:45,660
of helpful feedback and then, uh, once we've released, we've seen a handful of people kind

447
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:51,280
of do like a let's play type of deal where they'll play for 20, 30 minutes and so far

448
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:54,920
seems to be mostly positive feedback, a lot of laughs, which is good.

449
00:25:54,920 --> 00:26:00,040
So, um, what do you, what do you think now that this is like out there in the world?

450
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:03,360
Again, I know, I know there's still more coming with little tanks, but as you've kind of made

451
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:07,960
that transition from, you know, we were doing this visual artist thing to gaming was, uh,

452
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:11,840
or the game development was kind of a hobby to, well, now it's taken up a lot more of

453
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,840
my time.

454
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,840
Yeah.

455
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,840
Is, is this it now?

456
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,840
Is this going to be the career path for you guys?

457
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,360
Or do you plan to make more games?

458
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,720
Is this, is this the first of many from lead money?

459
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,720
We're actually both.

460
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:26,620
Um, so our idea is we're both kind of prototyping different games and then which we're going

461
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:30,100
to test them out and see which one we really like and then start developing that one.

462
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,260
So this isn't the end.

463
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:34,460
This is just the first game and we want to keep doing this forever because we love it

464
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,460
so much.

465
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:41,100
And it's like we finally found the thing that we love to do and we can actually do it together,

466
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,100
which is great.

467
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,100
Yeah.

468
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,100
We get to keep working.

469
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:47,300
You know, we worked together for several years, went to school together and stuff.

470
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,660
So, uh, we go way back.

471
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:52,980
It's fun to work with a, with a friend and we can work from home.

472
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:58,740
You know, as Andrew and Andrew has a couple of kids and I'd have a six month old at home.

473
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:03,360
So I'm able to spend a lot of time with my family and get to work on something I love.

474
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,220
So yeah, I hope this is the first of many.

475
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,220
Yeah.

476
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,220
All right.

477
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,220
That's a great story.

478
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,220
So let's, let's plug the game one more time.

479
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,540
Make sure everybody knows where to get it.

480
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:12,500
Little tanks available on steam, right?

481
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,500
Yes.

482
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,500
Where else?

483
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,500
What else should we know?

484
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,500
Uh, any other plugs we've got to get out?

485
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:20,780
Uh, yeah, it's on, uh, windows, Mac and Linux.

486
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:24,340
Uh, super fun.

487
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:25,340
Best game ever.

488
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:26,340
Good, good, good.

489
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,060
Good.

490
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:29,060
Good.

491
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,060
You have to keep selling it that way.

492
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,060
It's the best game you'll ever play.

493
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,060
You'll never want to play another game again.

494
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,060
True story.

495
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:37,460
Um, any, I, I would be a terrible video game radio host if I didn't prod this question.

496
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:41,900
Any plans to do consoles, something outside of PC?

497
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:45,860
So right now, um, we're both pretty poor and, um, takes money to do stuff like that.

498
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:50,720
But if the game does take off and, um, people seem to like it, we would love to do it.

499
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,580
I would love to see, um, little tanks on every console if I could.

500
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:59,620
Um, but it all takes time and development and money, of course, but, um, if it does,

501
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:00,620
we would love to do it.

502
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:01,620
Yeah.

503
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,620
Yeah.

504
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:03,620
Get on the switch.

505
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:04,620
That's the hot shit right now.

506
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:05,620
Yeah.

507
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:06,620
It could be console and portable and all that stuff.

508
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:07,620
Yeah.

509
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:08,620
Yeah.

510
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:09,980
Let me ask this because we're going to transition into talking about news and the types of video

511
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,540
games that we've been playing this week.

512
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:15,020
Um, what, what, what's like, I like to ask a lot of people to come to the studio.

513
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:19,340
This question, what is what you, you would think if you could only pick one, just one,

514
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:23,620
your favorite video game of all time or your most influential video game of all time, and

515
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:27,820
you can only pick one if you, if you start on a second one, I'm turning it off one game.

516
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:32,460
I know exactly which one I'm kind of embarrassed to say though, um, don't be embarrassed because

517
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,460
I was an addict.

518
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:37,060
I told you the show started for DDR, so you have nothing to be embarrassed about.

519
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:40,860
Well, I think I would, I would get into World of Warcraft and destroy my life again.

520
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:45,140
There's, there's nothing, ah, no, it's World of War, there's definitely World of Warcraft

521
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,140
for me.

522
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:50,780
So, so I know these guys, thanks to, uh, Captain Matt from Starboard Power Compling knows you

523
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:51,780
guys.

524
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:54,540
I don't know if he told you he, him and I used to co-host a show here on the network

525
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:57,180
called Horde House, which was about World of Warcraft.

526
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,180
Yeah.

527
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:01,380
So you can take that back and uh, yeah, it was called Horde House.

528
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,380
Oh, Horde House.

529
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,380
Yeah.

530
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,380
That, that was the joke.

531
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,380
Wink.

532
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,380
Yeah.

533
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,380
It was called Horde House.

534
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:10,220
It was very, if you want to hear like what a dirty son of a bitch that guy is, go listen

535
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,660
to, go listen to old episodes.

536
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:12,660
It's not on anymore.

537
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,660
Sadly.

538
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:16,180
We all stopped playing, but um, yeah, that's good.

539
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,180
That's good that we stopped playing.

540
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,180
Yeah.

541
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,180
It's so addicting.

542
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,180
You got it.

543
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,180
You got to get it, get out of there and live the rest of your life.

544
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:25,740
Well, dark soccer is still playing, but everything in moderation, you know, like, you know, I

545
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:30,500
played Final Fantasy 14, which probably just as bad, but I don't do, I don't do any of

546
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,980
the raiding stuff anymore.

547
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,900
I think that's once you can kind of separate yourself from that.

548
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:38,740
You should get into a new MMO, like, uh, the Elder Scrolls Online or something like that.

549
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:39,740
I tried.

550
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:40,740
Cause that just paid it.

551
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,740
I couldn't get into Elder Scrolls Online.

552
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:42,740
I couldn't either.

553
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:43,740
I tried.

554
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,740
I tried.

555
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:45,740
I just, but you know what?

556
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:49,980
I tried when it first came out on PlayStation four as the Guild Wars model where it's, you

557
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:50,980
don't have a monthly fee.

558
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:51,980
It still is that.

559
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:52,980
Yeah.

560
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:53,980
Yeah.

561
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:54,980
I know.

562
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:55,980
I know.

563
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:56,980
But when I first, it was just buggy and all that.

564
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:57,980
So a lot of that's probably fixed now.

565
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:58,980
So I probably do owe it a second shot, but you know, I don't know.

566
00:29:58,980 --> 00:29:59,980
I don't know.

567
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:00,980
We'll see.

568
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:01,980
Now I play Pokemon Go.

569
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:02,980
At least that gets me outside.

570
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:03,980
So, all right.

571
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:04,980
So World of Warcraft.

572
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:05,980
What about, what about for you?

573
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:10,580
Uh, for me has to be a Mario 64.

574
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:13,980
So Mario, Mario, uh, the platformer, not the cart.

575
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:14,980
Yeah.

576
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:15,980
Yeah.

577
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:16,980
Okay.

578
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:17,980
Platformer.

579
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:18,980
I just, I still remember the day I got it.

580
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:19,980
Uh, I just, I just love it.

581
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:20,980
Uh, yeah.

582
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:25,480
I like watching the speed runs of that stuff where people just blow through the game like

583
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:28,980
minimal stars and do all these crazy tricks.

584
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:31,980
Maybe, maybe some of these days we'll see people speed running your game or something.

585
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:34,980
Cause you know, you do have the, you can build on it, but I'm sure you can go from start

586
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,980
to finish or just the basics if you're good enough.

587
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:37,980
Right.

588
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:38,980
Uh, maybe.

589
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:39,980
Yeah.

590
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:40,980
Yeah.

591
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:41,980
Yeah.

592
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:42,980
Yeah.

593
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:43,980
Yeah.

594
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:44,980
Yeah.

595
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:45,980
Yeah.

596
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:46,980
Yeah.

597
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:47,980
Yeah.

598
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:48,980
Maybe.

599
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:49,980
Maybe.

600
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:50,980
Yeah.

601
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:51,980
Can you beat your own game?

602
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:52,980
Yes.

603
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:53,980
Okay.

604
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:57,500
I have to, I have to ask because you know, there's people, I bet if I brought on the

605
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:00,700
developers of dark souls, they may not, I may get some nose out of that.

606
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,700
We'll see.

607
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:02,700
All right.

608
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,700
Uh, let's see.

609
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,700
You can beat your own game.

610
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,820
It's not done yet.

611
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:08,300
Some well wishes in our chat room over at live.vog.org.com.

612
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,060
Fantas says game is lit.

613
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:12,740
Uh, act F says the best of luck to these guys.

614
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,420
The game, it does look fun.

615
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:16,320
So a Robert M says it looks interesting.

616
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,400
So I think there's a lot of people checking that out right now.

617
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,280
So hopefully, uh, hopefully, uh, some more people will check it out.

618
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,800
Thanks to you guys coming here tonight.

619
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,800
Great.

620
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,600
Uh, we're going to move on and talk a little bit about, um, what's going on in gaming news

621
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:32,520
and our gaming weeks and so forth, but please as gaming fans, stick around and give us your

622
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,520
input on what's going on with the gaming news.

623
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,520
Okay.

624
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,520
All right.

625
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,520
Awesome.

626
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,400
So let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we've been playing

627
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,400
this week.

628
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,280
So you guys may not know this, but we like to go around every week.

629
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:45,740
We just talk about a game or two that we've been playing this week and what we're into

630
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:46,740
with it.

631
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:49,220
So Loki's going to start in a game or two is pretty much going to be what it is.

632
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:51,800
Cause like I said, it's building a 3d printer most of the week.

633
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:58,140
So, um, I still playing Skyrim still like, God, I didn't know how many hundred of our

634
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:01,860
heart, how many hours a minute, Oh, it's over a hundred.

635
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:05,380
And so I'm actually running into new quest lines that I've never played before because

636
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:10,120
I've finished most of the mainland remains storyline stuff.

637
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:13,240
So now I'm just kind of hitting up all those other quests like, Oh, I didn't even know

638
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,240
that one was there.

639
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,440
And that's kind of cool.

640
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:20,020
So just still playing through that and then, um, occasionally playing Pokemon go just mainly

641
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:23,000
just to do the, you know, daily stuff.

642
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
That's it.

643
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,240
Well, they have that double XP thing.

644
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,240
Yeah.

645
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,840
I evolved, you know, all my stuff that had been saving up and that's about it.

646
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,760
I mean, I don't know.

647
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:36,820
I, they say that you get better stuff out of the eggs, but like I have these five kilometer

648
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:37,820
eggs have been hatching.

649
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:38,820
It's all common nonsense.

650
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:41,600
Like, Oh, goody bullshit that can just get anywhere.

651
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,880
It's the two K eggs that have all the better stuff.

652
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,880
Right?

653
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:48,040
But I was already in the middle of, you know, five K when I was doing it.

654
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:54,640
And even still though, like, yeah, I still haven't gotten any of the like baby, um, series

655
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,640
two stuff.

656
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,960
Oh, like the Clefas and I haven't gotten any of those ever.

657
00:32:58,960 --> 00:32:59,960
Wow.

658
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:00,960
Yeah.

659
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,720
I think though, actually I just hatched a toga P out of a two K during this event.

660
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,720
So they're there.

661
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,720
Well, I'll do that.

662
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,040
I still have a 10 K that I'm working on right now.

663
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,040
So, okay.

664
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,040
I don't know.

665
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:13,200
You see this sunburn that I have that is from playing Pokemon go yesterday.

666
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,200
Actually we went out.

667
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:18,100
And my friend who doesn't really play a lot of video games was super into Pokemon go was

668
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:21,920
like, let's go up to Cameron park because they have the Lake up there because that's

669
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,920
the place where they might have a dratini.

670
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:27,560
Although of course none showed up yesterday, but there was, yeah, there's a shit ton of

671
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,560
magic harps though.

672
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:31,680
So it was like, you know, it was like, it was kind of like going to pier 39, but like

673
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:34,520
not as much like, so, you know, I don't know.

674
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:38,480
So I walked around like three laps there and I got the sunburn and so forth, but I got

675
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:43,520
to tell you this, I am really blown away by the people that are playing Pokemon go because

676
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:46,940
the only people that were at the Lake yesterday were all Pokemon go players.

677
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:50,200
And it was either like, it was the family, they had their kids and they were on the phone.

678
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,640
You'd see like the couple that's together.

679
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,640
They're on their phones.

680
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,200
I saw like older people are super getting into Pokemon go.

681
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:01,520
I saw these two old late little old ladies were walking around and it was like, Oh, Martha,

682
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,120
did you see the pine go over there?

683
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,120
And they were talking about Pokemon.

684
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:08,880
I was like, what the, this is, this is awesome that like grandma's playing Pokemon go.

685
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:12,920
Like I remember when older ladies hated video games and they were the work of the devil.

686
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:17,280
So this is, this is I'm stereotyping broadly, obviously, but this is just such like a neat

687
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,280
change is that like, everybody's really getting into this game.

688
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:24,580
I saw, I saw a Vietnam vet, he was, he was decorated with his jacket or these Vietnam

689
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:26,860
vet there with his, I assume wife.

690
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:29,080
And they were there playing the game, sitting on a bench.

691
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:33,720
And the, the stock was like, you know, honestly that like, I've totally gotten out of Ingress,

692
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:38,980
um, you know, occasionally I'll check to see if my, you know, MEFGs are full and they'll

693
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:39,980
empty that stuff out.

694
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:47,740
But like, I've totally gotten out of Ingress and, um, I mean, I casually play Pokemon go.

695
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:50,860
It's just kind of something that just kill time, I guess.

696
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:53,060
Um, I don't know.

697
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,620
It was just, it was just something to do.

698
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:55,940
I didn't really have any plans yesterday.

699
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:59,180
It was nice that I'd be able to go outside and all that stuff.

700
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,940
Ingress stressed me out too much is what it was.

701
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:04,180
The PVP element is, can be rough.

702
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:08,460
Pokemon is not, I mean, they, there's the gyms, but you don't, the gyms are so useless.

703
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,460
It's pointless.

704
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:10,940
I don't do that anymore.

705
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,620
It's, there's just no point to them.

706
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:13,620
Yeah.

707
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,620
You can ignore them if you want completely.

708
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:15,620
So.

709
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:16,620
All right.

710
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:19,220
Uh, well let me talk about my gaming week as well.

711
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:23,060
So obviously I talked a little bit about Pokemon go, although I, I want to, uh, note in our

712
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:28,180
chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, actdeftinchat makes the good old Pokemon go is dead, but

713
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:31,020
in quotes he's, he's being sarcastic, lol no.

714
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:32,060
Um, yeah.

715
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:35,380
You know, every time I see one of those Pokemon go is dead articles, I'm like, just because

716
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:38,200
you're not playing it doesn't mean other people aren't playing it.

717
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:42,880
And what's happening that I'm seeing now is that it's not really the same gamers that

718
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,360
were playing it at first that are playing it now.

719
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:51,000
And it's, it's a very different set of gamers, at least from what I observed at the lake

720
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
yesterday.

721
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,120
You know, it is like a totally different demographic.

722
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:59,260
And I think that's awesome that, you know, more people are playing games because of something

723
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,260
like Pokemon go.

724
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:03,380
That's just a different type of game that gets you out in the real world doing different

725
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,380
stuff.

726
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,380
Yeah.

727
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:07,800
And Bobby Blackpool says, yes, it does mean that if I'm not playing it, it's dead.

728
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:12,600
Swear to God, the next time I see an article on one of those websites, I'm coming for him.

729
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,600
Listen up Forbes.

730
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:18,200
It's just, it's not as prevalent as when, you know, first came out, everyone just gathered

731
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:21,120
around the park and it's like, holy crap, what are all these people doing out there?

732
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,120
Now it's just died down.

733
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,120
But it's still a thing.

734
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,120
I mean, yeah.

735
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:28,500
Cameron Park Lake would have been swarmed a couple months ago when that game was new.

736
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:33,080
Now it was just like, oh, there's a, there's a handful of people here, but that's still

737
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,260
better than nothing.

738
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:37,040
That's more people, Cameron Park Lake than they would normally get.

739
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,440
Especially when they charge, well, they were charging yesterday cause I think they forecasted

740
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:44,120
rain yesterday, but when they usually charge people to get in there, that goes, that money

741
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,280
goes back into the local economy.

742
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,560
Like that's an awesome thing.

743
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,560
I think.

744
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,560
I don't know.

745
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,560
But anyway, haters gonna hate.

746
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,900
Uh, other games I've played.

747
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:56,840
So I'm embarrassed to say this, but I can't, I can't stop fucking playing Clicker Heroes

748
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,840
on PlayStation four.

749
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,360
Oh, that was the other game I played.

750
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,360
Yes.

751
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,360
I did play a little bit of Clicker Heroes.

752
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,080
I have seen you on there quite a bit.

753
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,080
I'm embarrassed.

754
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,080
Well, cause I leave it.

755
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,120
Okay.

756
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,960
Just because you see me on Clicker Hills on PS4, it doesn't mean I'm sitting there clicking.

757
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:13,080
I leave it running while I'm like doing stuff around the house or even in the back office

758
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,080
on my computer.

759
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,400
And then I'll go in, upgrade some heroes and go back.

760
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,840
Like it is literally the game that just kind of runs in the background all day.

761
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,840
Yeah.

762
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:24,060
So, but I'm even embarrassed that I play it that much, but what can I say?

763
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,060
It's something that I've been doing.

764
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:26,060
All right.

765
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,060
How about some other games?

766
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:30,680
I've been playing Overwatch a little bit again because there's a new event going on in Overwatch

767
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:33,040
called Overwatch Uprising.

768
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:37,640
And the awesome thing about it is that they brought in another PvE event, which is what

769
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,980
they did for Halloween.

770
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,360
They did the Junkenstein's Revenge.

771
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,960
They have something very similar to that.

772
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:45,440
And I can't even remember the name of the mode now, but they have two versions of it.

773
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:50,200
And one of them, you're limited to the quote unquote older Overwatch characters.

774
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:58,000
So it's like Reinhardt, Mercy, Tracer, and Torbjorn are in this.

775
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,560
And they're like, it's kind of like a prequel to where Overwatch comes from basically.

776
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,640
And you're playing through this PvE mode.

777
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:09,360
So you could do it with that setup or they did it so you can just do any hero you want

778
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,860
in another version of it.

779
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:13,960
And so they're encouraging people to play it with loot boxes and so forth.

780
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:17,760
And the more I play it, I'm like, this is more fun right now for me than playing the

781
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,460
game itself, because I don't get stressed out because more PvE.

782
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:25,800
It feels like what I enjoy about Mass Effect multiplayer online is that it's more collaborative,

783
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,520
that whole Horde mode stuff.

784
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,680
Like it's a mode like that in Overwatch.

785
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:33,920
The only place I could be critical of it is that it's kind of the same mode over and

786
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,920
over again.

787
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:38,920
So if you want to get your nine loot boxes for the week by doing this mode, it's going

788
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:41,800
to get a little stale because you're kind of doing the same thing over and over.

789
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:46,240
But I really hope if Blizzard is looking at where do we go from here with Overwatch, with

790
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:52,160
an Overwatch 2.0 or an Overwatch Next or whatever, I really hope they flesh out more PvE modes

791
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,420
because they're a hell of a lot of fun.

792
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:58,760
And I think if there could be more diversity in it, that would be the game for me.

793
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,000
And I'd probably play it even more.

794
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,520
Well, that reminds me almost like they just have the trailer for Star Wars Battlefront

795
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,520
2 this week.

796
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:08,840
So yeah, Battlefront 1, I mean, I liked Battlefront.

797
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:13,900
I just didn't want to play that because it's all online multiplayer and I would love a

798
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,220
single player campaign.

799
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:20,200
Now they showed like the single player campaign story trailer for it and I was like, I'm totally

800
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:23,680
on board for that because that looks really interesting.

801
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:27,920
And I mean that I'll probably pick up that game versus not having a single player campaign

802
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,020
and not picking it up, you know, the first game.

803
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:33,360
And then the fact they talked about they're not doing a season pass this time either.

804
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,360
That's bold from EA.

805
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:39,040
Yeah, loot box or some bullshit.

806
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,240
This is EA we're talking about.

807
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:43,280
I'm not gonna, all of a sudden they saw the light and decided, oh, we're not gonna be

808
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,160
dicks this time.

809
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:48,080
I think we have a story coming up on that later, so we'll save it for that.

810
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,080
Just a couple more here.

811
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:52,160
Drawn to Death, I checked out on PlayStation 4.

812
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,280
That's on PlayStation Plus right now, so it's out for free.

813
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,080
What a foul-mouthed little game.

814
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,520
What a foul-mouthed little game.

815
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:01,200
The whole time I was playing it, I was like, Loki would love this.

816
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,880
Just in the tutorial, there's a little thing that's like, press this to use your gun.

817
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,160
And it goes, now shoot me in the fucking mouth.

818
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,400
And I was like, what a nasty little game.

819
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,640
And it taunts you the whole time you're playing it and all this stuff.

820
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:15,600
Well, it's supposed to be in some kid's notebook or something like that.

821
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,880
It's like they let Twitter create a game.

822
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,880
But it's fun.

823
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,880
It's fun.

824
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:22,740
And then lastly, but certainly not leastly, the other game I've been playing a little

825
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,200
bit of this week.

826
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:29,520
For the third time I've purchased this game, no, it's not Mass Effect, Bayonetta came out

827
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,520
on PC.

828
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,520
Yes.

829
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:34,460
Bayonetta is so awesome.

830
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:36,240
And yeah, they released it on Steam.

831
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,940
That whole countdown clock from a couple weeks ago ran up.

832
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:41,620
And of course, that's the big PC release of Bayonetta.

833
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:45,920
And so now you can run it in 4K, even though my monitor doesn't really do that.

834
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:50,960
But I mean, it looks great just even in the, what, 19, 20, 1080 or whatever your monitor

835
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:51,960
does by default.

836
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:56,500
It looks very crisp, very great frame rate I'm getting on my computer.

837
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:00,220
The one thing I noticed that I was a little like, eh, is that the audio syncing is off

838
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:01,220
in some parts.

839
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:05,920
And probably this enhanced graphics is probably not letting itself well to that and it's probably

840
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,800
throwing some of it off.

841
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,480
But the game itself runs great.

842
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:12,880
And it's just fun to be playing that game again, even if it is seven years old.

843
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:17,780
But I hope it does well so that they'll either release Bayonetta 2 on PC, although we all

844
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:21,560
know Nintendo had a hand in that, so you can't really, you know, as much as the fans

845
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,980
want that to happen, it probably just won't.

846
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:27,620
But what would be even better is a Bayonetta 3 gets announced.

847
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:29,720
That would be the best.

848
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:32,700
So here's hoping that that does well on PC.

849
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:35,300
If you've never played Bayonetta before, now's the time.

850
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,300
It's only what?

851
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:37,300
I think it's only 20 bucks.

852
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,300
20 bucks, yeah.

853
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,300
Right now.

854
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,300
Yeah.

855
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,300
So there it is.

856
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:42,300
All right.

857
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,300
Let's see.

858
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,300
Let's check it.

859
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:45,300
Let's check it with our guests and your gaming ways.

860
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,300
What types of video games have you been playing this week?

861
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:49,580
I imagine you've probably been busy with your own game, but has there been anything else

862
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:51,580
you've been playing, Andrew?

863
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:52,580
No.

864
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:53,580
Seriously, no.

865
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:57,500
I don't have time to do much except for work on the game and test the game over and over

866
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,500
and over again.

867
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:01,780
So I'm really looking forward to the next one, but I haven't really had time to play

868
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:02,780
games.

869
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:03,780
That's fair.

870
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:04,780
You guys did just release the game.

871
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:10,780
But how long do you think that will go on for before you finally are like, okay, done.

872
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:12,120
And I'm just going to let it go.

873
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:17,660
For me, I think maybe two months, maybe two or three months, because we have so much to

874
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:18,660
work on.

875
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:23,800
But after that, I think we'll have time to just take a little break, play games and start

876
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,440
thinking about the next thing.

877
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:29,840
I just want to point out Blizzard patched Diablo II 11 years after the fact.

878
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:30,840
So don't do that.

879
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,840
Don't do that.

880
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,840
All right.

881
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,720
Tony, what about you?

882
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:35,720
Similar story.

883
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:39,360
I didn't have too much time, but I had to make a little bit of time with Yooka-Laylee.

884
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,360
Oh, yeah.

885
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,320
I backed that one on Kickstarter.

886
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,120
It's the first game I ever backed on there.

887
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:51,240
It finally came out and I only played it for about an hour, but it feels like it's delivered

888
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,640
what it was out to do.

889
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:56,620
You know, just kind of like a banjo style 64 platformer in it.

890
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:59,200
Super colorful, super fun.

891
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,960
I'm really looking forward to getting into the rest of it.

892
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:02,960
Awesome.

893
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:08,680
Yeah, I've heard the reviews on Yooka-Laylee are kind of mixed, but the people that are

894
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:11,420
like actually playing it are really enjoying it.

895
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:14,900
So it's like one of those things where it seems like it's for the fans and maybe reviewers

896
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:15,900
don't get it.

897
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:16,900
There's a lot of movies like that.

898
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:20,800
Well, yeah, I think some of the gripes who are just like maybe because it's borrowing

899
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:25,520
so much from that genre of games that some of the downfalls of those genre of games,

900
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,160
they're not really tweaking the fix it or improve it.

901
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,600
So I don't know.

902
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,520
I think that's, I think you're right.

903
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:37,040
It's that they, it's, it plays a lot like a 64 game for better or worse, you know?

904
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,040
Yeah.

905
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,400
I don't know.

906
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:40,400
Whatever.

907
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,400
People like it.

908
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:46,240
So at least it's not Mighty No. 9, so there's that going for it.

909
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,960
All right.

910
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,120
Let's get into, we need to get into some gaming news already here.

911
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:55,520
We've been talking a lot about our gaming weeks and of course a little tanks here, but

912
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:58,560
I know there's been a lot of stuff that's happened in gaming this week, so let's get

913
00:43:58,560 --> 00:43:59,560
into it.

914
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,880
First, of course, the quick plugs for our social media.

915
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:06,920
We are on Twitter, twitter.com slash O L R and Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge

916
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:07,920
radio.

917
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:10,200
Meanwhile, Loki wants you to start us off.

918
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,200
All right.

919
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:15,840
So they finally announced the specs of Project Scorpio.

920
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:20,880
So they're going to talk more about it during E3, but already it's looking like it's more

921
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,080
powerful than the PlayStation 4 Pro.

922
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:28,800
And they're doing some really interesting things with the whole architecture of it.

923
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:34,240
So what's kind of unique to it from what I've seen is that they're building in some

924
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:38,360
of the DirectX 12 calls and everything into the actual hardware.

925
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:41,640
So it's all running hardware based instead of actually software.

926
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:46,480
So they're able to improve performance using that as well as the fact that, you know, the

927
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:51,880
clock speeds higher, it's got more RAM, it's got more, you know, a powerful, more powerful

928
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:52,880
GPU.

929
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:57,260
Pretty much everything is outspecking the PlayStation 4 Pro.

930
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:04,140
And then they also kind of invited, what was it, they invited Digital Foundry to come take

931
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:08,700
a look at it because they do a lot of those comparison videos between different systems

932
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:09,700
and stuff.

933
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:16,860
And so he was shown, Richard Ledbetter was shown, I guess, for some motorsports running

934
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:27,640
a native 4K and then it was running at 60 frames per second in 4K with not even topping

935
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:33,180
out the full hardware, it was basically about 75 to 80 percent of the processing power of

936
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:34,180
that system.

937
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:35,860
And that's pretty amazing.

938
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:40,540
Just that ability to be able to push that kind of power.

939
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:45,260
I mean, I'm interested to see what, I think that might actually sell me on it.

940
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:48,860
I mean, it just sounds like it's going to be that much better performance wise.

941
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:53,380
I'm having a hard time understanding, and I know this sounds like hypocritical because

942
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:56,660
I own a PlayStation 4 Pro, but I actually, here's the thing, I actually kind of regret

943
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:57,660
that purchase in retrospect.

944
00:45:57,660 --> 00:46:00,500
I don't think I should have bought the Pro.

945
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:03,780
But if I had a 4K television, I'd probably get more out of it.

946
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:08,380
But without it, I'm not getting any, I'm getting the most minor of frame rate increases.

947
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:13,300
So I mean, honestly, what's the big deal about the Scorpio and the specs?

948
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:16,140
If I have a high-end gaming PC, does it matter?

949
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:17,140
Well, it matters.

950
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:21,940
Well, I think from what I've seen, gaming PCs, in order to hit 60 frames per second

951
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:28,060
in 4K, you're going to need a really powerful system to do that, like cutting edge everything.

952
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:34,180
And even then, a lot of games aren't going to run natively in 60 frames per second.

953
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:37,040
And the reason for that also, you're going to still have the advantage because these

954
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:43,140
are custom chips that have that DirectX architecture built into them instead of it running as software

955
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:44,140
in the system.

956
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:45,580
And so it's a lot faster in that way.

957
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:49,100
I guess it's weird to me, and I can't separate, this is what's weird to me, is because they

958
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:52,380
keep insisting that Scorpio is not a new ecosystem.

959
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:53,380
It's not the Xbox Two.

960
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:54,380
No, it's not.

961
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:55,380
It's going to play everything from Xbox One.

962
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:58,120
But in my mind, I'm kind of like, well, that doesn't make any sense.

963
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:03,000
Because if I have the Xbox One that already plays it, do I need this fancy pants thing?

964
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,620
If it doesn't have its own exclusive games.

965
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:07,380
I think they're just saying that right now.

966
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:11,540
But I think it's going to be backwards compatible, like the 360 is backwards compatible for a

967
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:13,600
lot of the games.

968
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,720
This is just going to be more so.

969
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:19,140
But if they want to develop a game that's going to take more advantage of that, they

970
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:21,060
can do that.

971
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:22,060
So we'll see.

972
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:23,420
I mean, they're going to show it off at E3.

973
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:25,820
I'd be very curious about the price.

974
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:29,700
Yeah, that'd be interesting to see as well.

975
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:37,740
And they're saying also with that, that different, I guess, Xbox One titles, they're just going

976
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:38,820
to be able to benefit from it.

977
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:42,820
Just because the fact that there's not really, you don't even really need to tweak your games

978
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:45,140
for it to benefit from the system.

979
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:50,200
It's just more efficient altogether.

980
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:53,820
How long do you think before we have Scorpio exclusive games or whatever?

981
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:54,820
They obviously...

982
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:58,500
Oh, I don't think it's going to be that long, but it's hard to say.

983
00:47:58,500 --> 00:47:59,820
It's all about the adoption rate.

984
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:02,860
So if you get a lot of people buying the system, they may be able to go that route.

985
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:06,660
But I don't think they're going to do that until there's enough people on board with

986
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:07,800
that.

987
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:10,980
But it's also going to be the whole PlayStation Pro thing.

988
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:14,980
Because when the Pro first came out, not a lot of the games looked that much better on

989
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:15,980
it.

990
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:18,060
And even still, I don't think a lot of them looked that great.

991
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:23,020
Granted, now that they have that one patch that kind of helps boost those games that

992
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:28,360
don't really have PlayStation 4 Pro features built into them, they kind of give them higher

993
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:29,360
frame rates and stuff.

994
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:33,840
It'll be interesting to see what this does out of the box for Xbox One games, just to

995
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:39,980
see if there's that vast improvement, or how they're going to import higher resolution

996
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:41,800
textures into these games and stuff.

997
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:45,440
Because I would think if you have an older Forza motorsports game, that's going to be

998
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:50,320
one hell of a download to download 4K textures for everything.

999
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:51,320
So there's that.

1000
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:54,360
Granted, it has a terabyte hard drive.

1001
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:56,520
Phantasm Chat says, Scorpio looks interesting.

1002
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:58,000
You guys going to E3?

1003
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,440
No, Loki and I aren't.

1004
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:00,440
Do you guys do that stuff?

1005
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,200
Do you guys go to E3 and all that?

1006
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:04,480
No, we haven't.

1007
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,560
Have you shown little tanks at any Expos?

1008
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:11,040
I know you guys weren't at the SAC Indie Arcade, but any other Expos you guys do or planned

1009
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,220
us to the game off at?

1010
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:15,280
I think we want to try to submit to, was it Indie Arcade?

1011
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,280
Indiecade, I think.

1012
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:17,280
Oh, Indiecade.

1013
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,280
Okay.

1014
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:19,280
Yeah.

1015
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,280
But nothing yet.

1016
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:21,280
Yeah, not yet.

1017
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:22,280
Gotcha.

1018
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:23,280
All right.

1019
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:24,280
Okay.

1020
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:27,320
Well, no, sadly we're not going to E3, but I'm assuming we'll hear more about the console.

1021
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:32,440
I think we'll hear more about it sitting on our couch, so we will be at the actual convention

1022
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:33,440
itself.

1023
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:37,640
But anyway, before we get to the next story, which I want to get into, somebody insisted

1024
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:41,240
that they call into the show because of the guests that we have on tonight.

1025
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:44,120
The person that actually put us all in touch with each other.

1026
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:45,120
Hello, call.

1027
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:46,120
Are you there?

1028
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:47,120
Yes.

1029
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:48,120
Is this Hoarthouse?

1030
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:49,120
No, no.

1031
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:53,200
Hoarthouse is dead and gone and in the cemetery somewhere.

1032
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,400
Shane fell asleep on the grave somewhere.

1033
00:49:55,400 --> 00:50:00,400
I have been sitting at my computer for three years waiting for you to call to do the next

1034
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,240
recording of Hoarthouse.

1035
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:04,240
How was your week?

1036
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:07,920
I've been sitting here doing nothing and just have jerking off and nothing until now.

1037
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,360
So this is not Hoarthouse?

1038
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:11,160
How was your week in WoW, Grandpa?

1039
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:12,800
Oh, my week in WoW?

1040
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:16,560
What type of Blizzard rage can I do this week?

1041
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:17,560
I uninstall.

1042
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:19,880
I can go on for hours, but it's not a Blizzard show, as you would say.

1043
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:21,200
All right, all right.

1044
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:25,640
So you're the one that introduced us to Lead Money Games, not Lead Money Games, but introduced

1045
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:28,040
us to the developers behind Lil' Tanks.

1046
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:29,640
So you wanted to call in and say hello tonight?

1047
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:30,640
Well, I did.

1048
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:31,640
Yeah, I did.

1049
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:34,080
I know you're in the middle of gaming news and I appreciate it.

1050
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:39,400
I just got back from Easter stuff and wanted to sneak into listening to the show and say

1051
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:40,400
a few words, but yes.

1052
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,400
Anything for you, pumpkin.

1053
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:42,400
Oh, thanks, Boo.

1054
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:43,400
No, I've known...

1055
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:49,240
Unfortunately, I'm not too familiar with his gaming design partner, but I've known Andrew

1056
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:55,440
for over 15 years, and everything from call center craziness to his military service to

1057
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:56,440
his creative side.

1058
00:50:56,440 --> 00:51:02,840
And I was very excited to see his indie game pop up and back in on Kickstarter back in

1059
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:05,000
the day, and for all your listeners...

1060
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,560
You've known Matt longer than me?

1061
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:07,560
Yeah.

1062
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:08,560
You poor bastard.

1063
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:09,560
Yeah.

1064
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:15,040
The very first time I met Andrew was during call center training.

1065
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:18,920
I got sat with him to listen to a few calls, make sure that I was going to run away screaming

1066
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:24,400
and when the supervisor's walking me up to him like, damn, that guy is hot, which was

1067
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:25,400
a great intro.

1068
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:26,400
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1069
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:27,400
I'm married, buddy.

1070
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:28,400
Well, now, you weren't then.

1071
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:29,400
Back off.

1072
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:30,400
You weren't then.

1073
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:34,280
And the very first call I listened to, he takes a call and he's going through the routine

1074
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:38,320
and this customer's calling and he's like, yeah, my stove caught on fire.

1075
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:39,560
It caught my entire kitchen on fire.

1076
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:42,880
And the whole time, Andrew's going, okay, sir, absolutely, I'll create a work order

1077
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:43,880
for that.

1078
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:44,880
Not a problem.

1079
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:47,140
I'm thinking, what the fuck am I getting myself into?

1080
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:50,300
And 10 years later in that industry, I'm still going.

1081
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:51,300
But I wanted to-

1082
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:53,500
Yeah, so little tanks available now on Steam.

1083
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:54,500
Right.

1084
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:59,940
Well, and the best part is I was able to back the game, of course, because I fully support

1085
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:02,400
it and I love it and all that.

1086
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:10,220
But one of my rewards as his team of developers who's forwarded the game is to design an enemy,

1087
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:11,900
a boss.

1088
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:12,900
Not a boss, man.

1089
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:13,900
Just an enemy.

1090
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:15,900
Or enemy or whatever.

1091
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:16,900
Close enough.

1092
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:21,220
The reason why they call it a boss is because Rob does everything big because he's in charge

1093
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:22,520
of everything.

1094
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:28,060
And so I've decided when the time's ready and we're ready to sit down for that chat,

1095
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:30,740
I'm going to call that enemy Sky.

1096
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:35,840
And I don't know whether we can do something like aerial where he drops bombs on things

1097
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:41,840
or drops nukes on things or just create a really annoyingly sounding tank or an enemy

1098
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:43,780
that doesn't end until you kill it.

1099
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:47,500
Basically, both those types of subscriptions are Rob.

1100
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:53,620
So I backed this game with the intent, Rob, to design an enemy named after you.

1101
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:55,180
This guy has my Twitter handle.

1102
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:56,180
Oh, I see.

1103
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:58,340
That's why I started rolling my eyes the minute he started talking.

1104
00:52:58,340 --> 00:53:00,620
I think that's actually the second idea he's giving me.

1105
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:06,060
The first idea he said he wanted a penis that flew around and shot ectoplasm out of it.

1106
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:08,060
This is a family-friendly game!

1107
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:09,060
No, Matt.

1108
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:10,060
Can't do it.

1109
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:11,060
Sorry, buddy.

1110
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:12,060
Exploding unicorns, perhaps?

1111
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:14,420
What about on Game Pride Weekend in San Francisco?

1112
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:16,420
Can we have a DLC for that?

1113
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:17,420
Calm it down.

1114
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:18,420
Calm it down.

1115
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:20,420
You can be an 11 on Horde House.

1116
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:22,420
I need you a 7 or an 8 here.

1117
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:23,420
All right.

1118
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:28,420
But anyway, I wanted to congratulate the Lead Money Games team and hopefully you have a

1119
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:30,420
great show and interview tonight.

1120
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:33,420
And if you're listening, of course, please go to Steam, download the game, support them,

1121
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:38,420
and in the next little bit hopefully you'll see the enemy Sky raining bombs down on your

1122
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:40,420
parade in the near future.

1123
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:47,780
So you're legit going to use your money to make me a monster in a video game?

1124
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:53,780
There is no end to my willingness and my desire and scope of trolling you, Rob.

1125
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:54,780
Fuck you.

1126
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:55,780
Anyway, there it is.

1127
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:56,780
I hung up on him.

1128
00:53:56,780 --> 00:53:57,780
All right.

1129
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:00,780
Sorry, I was too good.

1130
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:03,780
We love Grandpa Matt.

1131
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:05,780
Hopefully he hears that part there.

1132
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:11,140
Thanks, Grandpa, for spending your hard-earned money to potentially, if it passes quality

1133
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:18,140
assurance, immortalize me in a video game as some annoying little son of a bitch that

1134
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:20,140
everybody will want to shoot in the face.

1135
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:21,140
That's great.

1136
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:22,140
That's great.

1137
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:23,140
I'm happy to hear that.

1138
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:24,140
Happy to hear that.

1139
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:25,140
All right.

1140
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:28,140
He's in chat screaming now that a bitch hung up on me.

1141
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:29,140
But there you go.

1142
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:31,140
There you go, folks in chat.

1143
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:34,500
SHO 100 Matt says, Grandpa needs to be on more often.

1144
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:36,500
JD says this.

1145
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:37,500
Let's see.

1146
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:39,500
SHO 100 Matt says, we will miss you, Grandpa.

1147
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:41,500
Act Def says, Grandpa has his priorities straight.

1148
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:43,500
Don't encourage him.

1149
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:45,500
Don't encourage him.

1150
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:46,500
All right.

1151
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:52,500
Even if I have to take a hit there, I'm happy that it was all to help make the game happen

1152
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:53,500
in the end.

1153
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:54,500
So there you go.

1154
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:55,500
Thanks.

1155
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:56,500
All right.

1156
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:59,500
Let's move on with some more gaming news now that our show has been blessed with Matt's

1157
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:00,500
presence.

1158
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:01,500
Let's talk about this.

1159
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:03,500
This is something everybody's talking about this week.

1160
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:05,500
And that's the NES Classic Edition.

1161
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:11,500
The NES Classic Edition has had the plug pulled on it somewhat shockingly.

1162
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:16,500
Of course, the NES Classic Edition was the kind of must-have Christmas gift this year.

1163
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:20,500
It was so must-have that it was selling out instantly at stores everywhere.

1164
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:22,500
Scalpers are selling it up for...

1165
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:23,500
Oh, yeah.

1166
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:24,500
It's only up to $300 now.

1167
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:28,500
Oh, I'm sure this news just put the prices through the roof even more so.

1168
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:29,500
So here's the deal.

1169
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:31,500
Here's the official quote from Nintendo.

1170
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:35,500
Throughout April, NOA territories will receive the last shipments of Nintendo Entertainment

1171
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:38,500
System NES Classic Edition systems for this year.

1172
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:42,500
We encourage anyone interested in obtaining the system to check with retail outlets regarding

1173
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:43,500
availability.

1174
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:46,500
We understand that it has been difficult for many consumers to find a system.

1175
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:47,500
And for that, we apologize.

1176
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:51,500
We have paid close attention to consumer feedback, and we greatly appreciate the incredible level

1177
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:53,500
of consumer interest and support for this product.

1178
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:57,500
So in other words, Nintendo is trying to say this was the plan all along.

1179
00:55:57,500 --> 00:56:01,500
Was that this thing was never supposed to be this popular.

1180
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:04,500
So we're ending it because it's supposed to not be popular.

1181
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:09,500
If I were a shareholder, I would be livid right now.

1182
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:16,500
Especially since Mario Run did not meet the same expectation levels Nintendo was hoping for.

1183
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:18,500
I realize the Switch is doing very well.

1184
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:19,500
We'll get into that later.

1185
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:26,500
But still, I mean, I know I'm usually one to counter Loki and come to Nintendo's defense here on the show.

1186
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:28,500
I'm not saving y'all this week.

1187
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:29,500
Nintendo deserves it.

1188
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:31,500
I don't I don't I don't get this.

1189
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:32,500
I don't think it was.

1190
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:34,500
I don't think it would be that expensive.

1191
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:35,500
The manufacturer either.

1192
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:39,500
I would think that they have a pretty high margin built in that thing.

1193
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:41,500
I just I don't get it.

1194
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:46,500
I think it's stupid and have the PR thing come out and say, oh, we we appreciate your feedback.

1195
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:49,500
It's just like, yeah, we heard you, but whatever.

1196
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:50,500
We don't fucking care.

1197
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:52,500
We'll do whatever we want.

1198
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:58,500
And this is just going to make it worse when they have another like, say, let's say an SNES mini comes out.

1199
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:05,500
It's going to be fucking impossible to get one because scalpers are like, dude, I made three hundred dollars on that sixty dollar system.

1200
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:07,500
I'm buying the shit out of that.

1201
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:09,500
And it'll be it's just going to get worse.

1202
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:11,500
And I think that's kind of what they want.

1203
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:19,500
They want people to be just like just mad crazy about buying their stuff so that you like amiibos or something like that.

1204
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:25,500
Oh, we'll just get people to think they're going to be rare and then they're going to try to flip them.

1205
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:27,500
I don't know. It's just it's stupid.

1206
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:29,500
They don't make any sense.

1207
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:33,500
Act deft and chat over at live dot vog network dot com says, yeah, not even us.

1208
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:35,500
Nintendo fans can apologize this.

1209
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:36,500
Let's see.

1210
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:39,500
Dark Tetsuya says, I heard people speculating Nintendo was pissed.

1211
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:42,500
People were hacking these things, installing other ROMs on there too bad.

1212
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:44,500
That was that was me on Twitter, actually.

1213
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:46,500
What was probably one of those people.

1214
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:48,500
I really think that's what this boils down to.

1215
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:57,500
I really, really think the reason why Nintendo pulled the plug on this and this is what makes it frustrating is I feel like Nintendo is like blatantly lying on this.

1216
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:59,500
I really do.

1217
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:07,500
You know, I understand they can't come out and say, well, due to hacking and exploiting, which is very easy to do on this system, I understand they can't.

1218
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:09,500
You can't tell me that they didn't have manufacturing problems.

1219
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:14,500
They can't figure out how to manufacture the system in quantities that can meet the demand.

1220
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:17,500
That is nonsense.

1221
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:23,500
I think and I know there's a lot of rumors out there that say, oh, well, they're pulling this in favor of doing a 2.0.

1222
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:24,500
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1223
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:28,500
You don't pull this off shelves six months before you release the 2.0.

1224
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:31,500
Go to the Apple playbook to see how that looks.

1225
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:33,500
And not even six months since it's been released.

1226
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:39,500
They will happily sell you an iPhone 6 full price the day before they release iPhone 7.

1227
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:41,500
That's not a read on Apple.

1228
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:42,500
Every tech company does this.

1229
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:47,500
So Nintendo should have been selling those NES Classics right up until they're ready to debut the NES Classic 2.

1230
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:50,500
I fully believe there will be an NES Classic 2.

1231
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:53,500
It'll have more games to sweeten the pot, but it's going to be online.

1232
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:57,500
It's going to be online because, A, they'll want to be able to sell you more games.

1233
00:58:57,500 --> 00:59:00,500
Because everybody was sitting here going, why didn't they do that the first time?

1234
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:02,500
So, A, it's to sell you more games.

1235
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:06,500
Yes, I realize this could be counterproductive with the Switch Virtual Console.

1236
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:07,500
But who cares?

1237
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:11,500
If people are willing to spend the money and buy it, Nintendo's happily going to sell it to you twice.

1238
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:14,500
Look at the 3DS and the Wii U. They'll sell it to you twice.

1239
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:16,500
I don't have a problem with the Virtual Console stuff being on there.

1240
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:20,500
I just think the price points that they have the Virtual Console games for are way too high.

1241
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:22,500
Well, there's many people out there that'll still pay them.

1242
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:26,500
Exactly, and that's why they're going to do this bullshit because people keep buying this crap.

1243
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:27,500
But here's the thing.

1244
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:31,500
It's not only that it's going to be online to sell you the games, but more importantly,

1245
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:35,500
so that they can upgrade the firmware on a regular basis to stay on top of the hackers.

1246
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:37,500
I see you rolling your eyes already, Loki.

1247
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:38,500
No, they're never going to sell.

1248
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:40,500
It's based off a Linux PC.

1249
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:43,500
It's a Linux system on a chip.

1250
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:46,500
There's no way you're going to be able to patch.

1251
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:49,500
There's no amount of patching you can do to this thing.

1252
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:51,500
They are going to eliminate people.

1253
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:54,500
They're never going to stop it, but they're going to make it a lot harder than it is now.

1254
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:55,500
Fine, I'll give you that.

1255
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:56,500
Alright.

1256
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:57,500
What do you guys think?

1257
00:59:57,500 --> 01:00:01,500
Have you been following this NES Classic or anything?

1258
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:02,500
You guys had interest in it?

1259
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:05,500
Yeah, I really wanted one when they first came out, but it was really difficult.

1260
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:06,500
Yeah, I still don't have one.

1261
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:08,500
It looks like it's never going to happen.

1262
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:09,500
Yeah, well good news. You're never getting one.

1263
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:11,500
But neither am I, so hey, we're on the same boat.

1264
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:12,500
We're on the same boat.

1265
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:17,500
But why do you think Nintendo would pull the plug on something so successful?

1266
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:19,500
It doesn't make much sense to me.

1267
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:25,500
I don't really, but it seems like a lot of things Nintendo does doesn't really make a lot of sense,

1268
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:30,500
but they find a way to make things a success, so I don't know.

1269
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:32,500
I'm not sure what they're doing.

1270
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:35,500
Same thing, when they came out, I was interested in getting one.

1271
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:41,500
I mean, I still have a working NES at home now, so I guess it wasn't a necessity, but it seemed like a cool idea,

1272
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:43,500
so I don't get it.

1273
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:50,500
But I refuse to pay hundreds on top of whatever the initial thing is. I won't do it.

1274
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:53,500
Well, here's an interesting little side note, by the way.

1275
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:56,500
You may or may not know, there's also a Famicom mini.

1276
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:58,500
That's what they were selling over in Japan.

1277
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:01,500
Obviously, Nintendo was the family computer or Famicom over there.

1278
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:06,500
Here's the interesting thing. Nintendo also suspended production of the Famicom,

1279
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:08,500
so if you thought you were going to get around it with one of these, sorry.

1280
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:11,500
And the games that are in it are different, too.

1281
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:14,500
I think like 10 of the games are different, 20 are the same.

1282
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:20,500
But anyway, they're ending production in Japan as well, but they're saying temporary right now.

1283
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:23,500
They're not saying forever.

1284
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:29,500
So that, to me, though, is what really is leaving the door open for a version 2.0.

1285
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:35,500
I think they're saying temporary in Japan because to be replaced with 2.0 later in the year,

1286
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:39,500
whatever they end up calling the next version of the NES Classic.

1287
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:43,500
I think that's just a given. We'll see.

1288
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:46,500
Let's see. Over in chat, over at live.vognetwork.com,

1289
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:48,500
Dart Tetsuya in chat says,

1290
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:52,500
I wonder if the Classic 2 would be modeled after the newer NES.

1291
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:55,500
And Brad from Pod Culture says the top loader, that would be hilarious.

1292
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:59,500
Actually, that's a pretty clever thing that Nintendo could do,

1293
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:03,500
is put out a top loader Classic NES that's their version 2.0.

1294
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:05,500
I actually think that's a cute idea.

1295
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:09,500
Or, here's my other cute idea, put the whole thing inside of Rob the Robot.

1296
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:11,500
Hmm? Wouldn't that be cute?

1297
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:14,500
Yeah, they could do something like that. We'll see. Anyway.

1298
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:17,500
Or how about you just manufacture more units of the system you already have?

1299
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:19,500
Yeah, right. That could be.

1300
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:23,500
Maybe they're realigning those resources to make more switches?

1301
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:28,500
Logically, that doesn't make sense to me, but I guess I should throw that out there.

1302
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:32,500
They're not manufacturing. I mean, how many did they actually sell of this,

1303
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:36,500
is what I'd be interested to find out, because they didn't manufacture that much.

1304
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:39,500
It may be a few hundred thousand units, if that.

1305
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:42,500
I don't even think it was probably that.

1306
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:46,500
I don't see that many being sold.

1307
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:50,500
And you can't tell me that, oh, well, they would be making switches,

1308
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:53,500
but they have to make these stupid NES classic minis. Come on.

1309
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:59,500
I mean, it's so hardware-wise, it's so minimal versus what's in a Switch.

1310
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:02,500
I don't even think you can compare them.

1311
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:06,500
All right, well, let's move on. Some more fun Nintendo news, right, Logie?

1312
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:08,500
Yes, because this is where their priority is.

1313
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:11,500
Their priority is selling you fucking amiibos, and that's what they're going to be doing.

1314
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:15,500
So they announced during their stupid Nintendo Direct that, hey, guess what?

1315
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:18,500
More amiibos for that game that came out over a year ago.

1316
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:21,500
Super Smash Brothers for 3DS and Wii U.

1317
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:30,500
They're going to be coming out with the cloud, Bayonetta, and some chick from Fire Emblem, Corrin.

1318
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:37,500
But, hey, in typical Nintendo fashion, you know you want those.

1319
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:40,500
Guess what? There's going to be some exclusive versions.

1320
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:44,500
And guess what? We teamed up with the best fucking retailer on the face of the earth.

1321
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:47,500
GameStop. Oh, baby GameStop.

1322
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:50,500
That's right. If you want to get...

1323
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:53,500
I swear to God, if the Bayonetta thing is exclusive to GameStop, I'm going to lose my shit.

1324
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:59,500
If you want to get a special cloud with a Cloud Player 2, they said, or a Twilight Princess Link,

1325
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:03,500
those are both GameStop exclusive. You cannot pick them up anywhere else.

1326
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:10,500
And then, what else? Oh, I should mention also they're announcing that they had other, like, Skyward Sword stuff.

1327
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:16,500
So Amazon is going to be, I guess, pre-ordering stuff as well.

1328
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:20,500
I want to say they have, like, who else are going to be exclusive here?

1329
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:25,500
But yeah, they basically have alternate versions of the different characters.

1330
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:31,500
Alright, this I will counterpoint you on, though, is because I still think the amiibos make neat little figures,

1331
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:33,500
and I want the Bayonetta ones for sure.

1332
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:37,500
The Corrin ones, I'm not as tied to that series, so I'm going to give or take on that.

1333
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:41,500
Cloud would be cool, but I'm not going to fight people at GameStop for the alternative.

1334
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:43,500
So it's kind of one of those, if I find one, cool.

1335
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:46,500
But the Bayonetta ones, I will fight people for, so bring it.

1336
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:51,500
However, I don't appreciate that you call that Nintendo Direct stupid,

1337
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:56,500
because they announced that they're localizing Coldsept in that little Nintendo Direct.

1338
01:04:56,500 --> 01:05:00,500
It was a blink-and-you-miss-it type of thing, but if you've never played Coldsept before, that's awesome.

1339
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:05,500
An awesome little game, a little hybrid of, like, Monopoly meets Magic the Gathering.

1340
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:08,500
So yeah, that Nintendo Direct was not stupid, Loki. You take it back.

1341
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:12,500
Skyward Sword Link and Corrin Player 2 version, which is stupid.

1342
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:17,500
Those are both Amazon exclusives, so if you want to get those, you better order those on Amazon.

1343
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:21,500
But yeah, I mean, what they had, were they announcing, was it...

1344
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:27,500
Didn't they have, like, more Wii? Oh, that's right, that's right.

1345
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:30,500
They announced that fucking Rayman was coming to the Switch,

1346
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:34,500
because that launch game from the Wii U, or was it even the Wii?

1347
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:37,500
I can't remember at this point. I think it was the Wii U.

1348
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:41,500
That really needs to be on the Switch. That's the system seller right there.

1349
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:43,500
Not to say it's a bad game, but dude, that game is old.

1350
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:49,500
Yeah, I mean, it's cool that I guess they're probably trying to add some new coats of paint on it to make it a little more attractive.

1351
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:50,500
No, they really aren't.

1352
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:53,500
It's portable now? That's...

1353
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:55,500
It was portable on the Vita.

1354
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:58,500
Oh, I didn't even know it was on the Vita. Oh, Sony's still making the Vita?

1355
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:02,500
Yeah, they are. Some companies know who they are.

1356
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:03,500
Who's in Japan.

1357
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:08,500
ActDeftInChat says, Rayman Legends is good, though. Really good. And nobody owns a Vita, Loki.

1358
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:10,500
They do in Japan.

1359
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:12,500
I have a PlayStation TV that's somewhere.

1360
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:15,500
Do you see the thick layer of dust on my Vita, by the way?

1361
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:17,500
It's in the other room, but it's...

1362
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:18,500
Several Vitas that you own?

1363
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:20,500
Yeah, that's right. I have two.

1364
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:25,500
But the other one is more for collector purposes, because it's a Final Fantasy XIV Vita, and it's pretty sweet.

1365
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:26,500
Just saying.

1366
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:28,500
Well, your attach rate's fantastic, then, for Vita's system.

1367
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:29,500
I know, right?

1368
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:32,500
Well, the other one's from Japan, so it doesn't really count, because they actually sell Vitas in Japan.

1369
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:37,500
Yeah, well, the one in the US doesn't really count, because they disavow all knowledge of the Vita.

1370
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:44,500
Alright. Moving on. Let's talk about Splatoon 2. Splatoon 2 is actually dated now for release.

1371
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:48,500
They talked about that in the Nintendo Direct, and Splatoon 2 looks awesome. I don't care what Loki says.

1372
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:51,500
July 21st is the big day for Splatoon 2.

1373
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:55,500
They actually were showing a little bit more on the Nintendo Direct of this.

1374
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:57,500
They were showing a new game mode called Salmon Run.

1375
01:06:57,500 --> 01:07:03,500
It's a co-op mode, that's pretty cool, for players against enemy creatures that spread pollution.

1376
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:10,500
So, yet again, another example of that horde mode, a la Mass Effect, a la what I was just talking about with Overwatch.

1377
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:11,500
Gears of War.

1378
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:14,500
Gears of War, obviously, making its way into Splatoon as well.

1379
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:18,500
That sounds really exciting, actually. I'm really into the co-op stuff.

1380
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:26,500
So, I think more and more developers are finding out that people really enjoy the co-op multiplayer when they can't get into the competitive multiplayer.

1381
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:32,500
The other thing I forgot to mention, they have new colored Joy-Cons, so you can get a neon yellow one.

1382
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:37,500
If you really want neon yellow controllers, just remember they're $80. Thanks, Nintendo.

1383
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:43,500
And I think that is to celebrate ARMS, which they also showed off in the Nintendo Direct, and they dated that.

1384
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:52,500
June 16th is the date for ARMS, and they were showing how, you know, with the characters you can kind of, you actually sub in and out the different ARMS, so there's all these different combinations.

1385
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:53,500
It's neat.

1386
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:59,500
I gotta be honest, I'm not feeling this the way a lot of my Nintendo fan friends are. I'm not feeling it.

1387
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:03,500
They're really pushing to make it esports. It's not esports. I'm sorry.

1388
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:15,500
Well, we'll see. I mean, I don't know. That's for the internet to decide. I'm not feeling this based off the trailers and all that, but I feel like, okay, Rob, you need to give it a chance and play it, but I'll need to play it at somebody else's house.

1389
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:16,500
But it's four player now.

1390
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:21,500
That part's cool, too. You know, again, leave it to Nintendo to bring the party modes in.

1391
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:29,500
I know we joked earlier about porting little tanks to the Switch, and obviously that's a money thing, but do you guys actually own Nintendo Switch? Have you played on that at all?

1392
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:30,500
No, no, I wish.

1393
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:38,500
I don't own it. I played it a handful of times. Just played Zelda and then, what's it, the Isaac Rebirth.

1394
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:39,500
Yeah, Binding of Isaac, yeah.

1395
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:47,500
Yeah, pretty fun. I mean, I think right now, for me, I would need to see a few more games before I'd go out and get it, but it looks cool.

1396
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:56,500
Yeah, I'd have to check out Arms. I'm remaining open to the idea, but I'm just like, right now, I'm not feeling it.

1397
01:08:56,500 --> 01:09:04,500
Just a quick recommendation. Please, my God, don't make that thing be the mascot. The announcer with the hand.

1398
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:05,500
Oh, the little announcer. We'll say Bill.

1399
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:08,500
That was fucking annoying. Please get rid of that thing.

1400
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:09,500
I think that's a thing your kids would like.

1401
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:13,500
No, they do like annoying things, but my God, that's annoying.

1402
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:21,500
Dude, there is some weird shit on fucking YouTube. Like, my kids watch, well, my youngest one, he watches the YouTube Kids app.

1403
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:31,500
That is, that goes down some deep rabbit holes of like, what the fuck kind of content are people making out there?

1404
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:44,500
It's just full of like, those lucky eggs and just all sorts of licensing ripoffs and just nursery rhyme music mashed together and some orgy of what the fuck is that?

1405
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:52,500
And like, I asked him, I'm like, what the hell is going on right there? Like, what are you watching?

1406
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:56,500
I worry more about that kind of crap than the actual Minecraft.

1407
01:09:56,500 --> 01:10:00,500
Okay, but I'm sure my mom looked at me watching You Can't Do That on television.

1408
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:01,500
No.

1409
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:02,500
When I was younger and was like, what the fuck?

1410
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:11,500
No, this is content specifically targeted towards kids. And because they know that people like, it's because people like watching unboxing videos.

1411
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:16,500
And because people like watching unboxing videos, they have these stupid lucky eggs, which are basically things you can buy in the store.

1412
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:22,500
Like, you can, and they're random and you open it up and they're like, oh, crap, I got Elsa or some shit.

1413
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:25,500
And people fucking watch hours of that shit.

1414
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:31,500
What the hell? You are not the only person to tell me that this week. The kids love unboxing videos on YouTube.

1415
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:40,500
And it's even worse than that because this thing was a simulated lucky egg. It was a fucking, all of it was goddamn animated, like with Spider-Man and fucking Elsa and shit.

1416
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:47,500
I'm like, none of this makes any goddamn sense. Why is this a thing? Like, what is going on here?

1417
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:57,500
And then like people talking like, like grown ass adults fucking playing with like toys, like the little kids, like, dude, I know you're a fucking adult.

1418
01:10:57,500 --> 01:11:02,500
I can see your hands. Those are fucking adult hands. You are not a kid playing the toy. This is creepy now.

1419
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:08,500
It's like, what the fuck is going on? Oh, look at this. I'm going to open this egg. Oh, look, it's blue. It's like, oh my God.

1420
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:14,500
Okay, but is this just the full realization of your old? Because again, when we were younger, our parents didn't understand.

1421
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:25,500
It's creepy shit. You think this is bad. Okay, you go and act this. These are kind of spinoffs of this whole genre of people dressing up in really shitty costumes like Spider-Man and Elsa.

1422
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:33,500
There's a whole bunch of Spider-Man Elsa videos out there where people run around, do weird, like almost borderline pornographic, weird, like innuendo shit.

1423
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:35,500
Rule 37. Rule 37.

1424
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:44,500
It's just it's it's a deep, dark hole that that goes into.

1425
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:50,500
Yes, I get the pun.

1426
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:53,500
All right, let's move on with another story, Loki.

1427
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:55,500
All right.

1428
01:11:56,500 --> 01:12:02,500
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Andreati with VoGnetwork.com, use the passphrase STEP.

1429
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:04,500
So speaking of games coming to the switch.

1430
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:10,500
Oh, sorry. Rule 34, not 37. Whatever. You know what Rule 37 is? See Rule 34. There it is.

1431
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:13,500
I've thought Rule 34 is more porn. This is just kind of weird shit.

1432
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:16,500
Well, okay, but you took it to a pointy place there.

1433
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:23,500
It wasn't porn. It's innuendo. It's not porn because it's YouTube. I mean, you can't put porn on YouTube.

1434
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:33,500
Anyways, so apparently there's, according to Epic, there's over 20 Japanese Unreal Engine games coming to the switch that are in development.

1435
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:42,500
So, yeah, that's pretty awesome. In the course, we don't know which games those are because they didn't mention any fucking titles, but there's at least 20 of them and they're coming to Japan.

1436
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:48,500
Well, but at least it shows that, yes, people are interested in developing for the switch. It's it's this is not going to be a repeat.

1437
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:52,500
Right. I don't think it's going to. I think there's tons of people developing games for the switch.

1438
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:55,500
It's just where are the games? Because they're not out yet.

1439
01:12:55,500 --> 01:13:00,500
And they probably should wait until more of them are ready to be released before releasing the system.

1440
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:03,500
Well, but the system's doing really well.

1441
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:07,500
Well, you know what? You know, people will buy a fucking Apple iPhone if it's red.

1442
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:12,500
So, I mean, I don't have a really high expectation for people.

1443
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:16,500
First off, you can shut up because I'm actually thinking about getting the red iPhone.

1444
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:20,500
But because because. No, no, no. Don't you fucking judge me. I'm not finished.

1445
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:28,500
Because my other iPhone, like the battery is just like, like it drains so fast and just like I just I have an older phone.

1446
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:31,500
I need to get a newer phone. So I'm like, well, the seven red is the newest thing out there.

1447
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:36,500
Maybe I'll just get that. I'm really trying to hold off and wait for the eight. I'm really trying to hold off.

1448
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:40,500
But it's like I got to go till October. I don't know if I can do it.

1449
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:46,500
And then all these when there is a hot shit new iPhone that's out there on the market, all these phone companies are going to get rid of their unlimited plans.

1450
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:48,500
Just wait.

1451
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:52,500
Well, yeah, I mean, I'm looking to upgrade my phone, but everything is out right now.

1452
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:56,500
It's like, well, this is you know, I can get an S8 because I have an S6 right now.

1453
01:13:56,500 --> 01:14:01,500
And it's like, well, it's sort of better.

1454
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:03,500
Yeah, actually, I think Alan's looking at getting one of those.

1455
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:10,500
It's like I just like, eh, I don't really care. I want something that's actually like interesting to buy.

1456
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:12,500
And none of them are that.

1457
01:14:12,500 --> 01:14:19,500
All right. Well, as much of a hater as Nintendo or as Loki's trying to be on Nintendo, I only hate because I love.

1458
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:23,500
I know. I know. We've talked about this before. Anyway, here's the thing.

1459
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:32,500
The Switch is Nintendo's fastest selling console that is confirmed, of course, by Nintendo, that it's their fastest selling console at VAR.

1460
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:38,500
It has sold over nine hundred and six thousand units since it's come out.

1461
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:42,500
Even with so many systems that are out there and available, the shipments are not meeting demand.

1462
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:44,500
Nintendo has acknowledged that.

1463
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:51,500
They have also said that on April 27th, they will give an update on this because they have to do the fiscal year earnings release.

1464
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:55,500
But if you were thinking the Switch was going to stall or anything, that's not happening.

1465
01:14:55,500 --> 01:15:01,500
And I think that's probably encouraging more developers to go for the Switch because, yes, that install base is there.

1466
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:09,500
And I think that the see that's the thing is I think the reason it's sold so well is because I don't think they're actually they are meeting that demand a little bit better than they are.

1467
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:16,500
Say, you know, the Wii or the Wii U or even when there's more of them on shelves to sell, they sell more.

1468
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:22,500
Many could have sold, you know, almost a million copies if or, you know, they put out a million copies of it.

1469
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:28,500
But I mean, I've actually I actually went to Wal-Mart the other day and they have like four systems sitting there.

1470
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:38,500
I thought about it and then I was like, then I looked at the games that are on the shelf and it literally is like half a shelf, one shelf, half of a shelf dedicated to the Switch.

1471
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:41,500
I'm like, oh, yeah, that's right. There's no games on the system. I'm not going to buy it.

1472
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:44,500
I need to get a 3D printer instead.

1473
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:47,500
It's much cheaper than that too.

1474
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:51,500
I'll print my own Switch.

1475
01:15:51,500 --> 01:15:54,500
I don't need your fucking system. I'll make my own.

1476
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:56,500
And it'll play all the games.

1477
01:15:56,500 --> 01:16:00,500
It'll be a horrible amalgamation of like the PlayStation 4.

1478
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:05,500
It'll look like one of those like Chinese knockoff systems like the V.

1479
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:09,500
That's fine. I have a Chinese knockoff printer, so it's all good.

1480
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:10,500
Is it really?

1481
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:13,500
It's open source. Most of the printers come from China.

1482
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:21,500
OK. All right. One more story for you guys, then we're going to get Dark Soccer on the phone here to do the classic system of the week.

1483
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:23,500
All right. So this is kind of cool to throw back here.

1484
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:38,500
But yes, they are. I guess the former members of the Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium, or MECC, are looking to develop a new piece of educational software.

1485
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:44,500
Now, you may not know who the MECC is, but you probably do know what the Oregon Trail is.

1486
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:47,500
So they're coming back to make a new game.

1487
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:54,500
And I guess they're planning on raising half a million dollars in funding to go towards that.

1488
01:16:54,500 --> 01:16:56,500
I wonder what they're going to make their game.

1489
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:59,500
Number Munchers Extreme. Let's pray.

1490
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:01,500
Because that was also MECC.

1491
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:08,500
All those games you played, at least I did in grade school, MECC did all that stuff.

1492
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:10,500
Was that like Math Blasters? Was that one of them?

1493
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:12,500
I don't know if MECC did Math Blasters, actually.

1494
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:15,500
So what they're developing, actually, a little bit more information on this.

1495
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:21,500
So what they're developing is a thing called, it's Real Experiences at Life.

1496
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:25,500
So R-E-at-L is Real Experiences at Life.

1497
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:32,500
And it focuses, I guess they're saying, on STEM studies, including forensics, vehicle traffic flow, and invasive species.

1498
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:35,500
That sounds a little bit more detailed than the Oregon Trail.

1499
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:39,500
You're going to die of something a lot more complicated than dysentery in this game.

1500
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:41,500
An evolved species has murdered you.

1501
01:17:41,500 --> 01:17:48,500
But yeah, they're saying it's going to be like a web portal, various ways of study, including streaming, classroom elements, and stuff like that.

1502
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:54,500
So it sounds more like an educational system versus forging the river.

1503
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:58,500
Bring back the traggles or get the fuck out, MECC.

1504
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:03,500
Are the traggles going to be your little mascot for this thing? Otherwise, no one car.

1505
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:06,500
They should do like the Oregon Trail, but just in modern times.

1506
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:08,500
Without zombies, because that's already been done.

1507
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:13,500
Let's see, sj100matt in chat says, Odell Lake, like Odell Lake.

1508
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:14,500
Let's see.

1509
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:16,500
Oh yeah, Odell Lake. I forgot all about that.

1510
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:19,500
Dungeon Buster suggests you have died from a brain parasite.

1511
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:24,500
And Dark Tetsuya does confirm the blaster games were someone else, at least according to Wikipedia.

1512
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:27,500
Well, you know, Wikipedia knows everything, right? So there it is.

1513
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:32,500
But it very well could have been an MECC game. I don't even know who made those games.

1514
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:38,500
Anyway, speaking of classic games, we are going to get our lovely Jamie Summers,

1515
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:42,500
Dark Soccer, here on the line right now to walk us through her regular segment

1516
01:18:42,500 --> 01:18:45,500
called the Classic System of the Week.

1517
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:46,500
Greetings.

1518
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:47,500
Hi, how are you?

1519
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:49,500
I'm alright.

1520
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:51,500
Sorry you couldn't be here.

1521
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:54,500
I was just going to say sorry you couldn't be here tonight.

1522
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:56,500
Hi, can you hear me okay?

1523
01:18:56,500 --> 01:18:58,500
Yeah, it's fine now.

1524
01:18:58,500 --> 01:18:59,500
The joys of live radio, what can I say?

1525
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:03,500
Sorry you couldn't be here in studio tonight. I hope everything's okay. Back at home.

1526
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:04,500
Yeah.

1527
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:05,500
Alright.

1528
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:09,500
Yes. Everything's okay. It's just...

1529
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:15,500
Well, you're missing a conversation where we're talking with the creators of Lil' Tanks

1530
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:20,500
and you could have been talking about blowing shit up with tanks this week, but, you know, I understand.

1531
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:22,500
Things happen.

1532
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:23,500
Tanks are awesome.

1533
01:19:23,500 --> 01:19:24,500
They are awesome.

1534
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:26,500
Alright, you know what else is awesome is that every week here on the show,

1535
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:32,500
DarkSakura takes us on a trip down memory lane with a segment we call the Classic Game of the Week,

1536
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:35,500
but new and improved in the year 2017.

1537
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:40,500
Once a month, she likes to say, you know what, the games just aren't enough.

1538
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:44,500
You need to bow down at this Classic System of the Week.

1539
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:48,500
DarkSakura, what is the Classic System of the Month?

1540
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:52,500
The Classic System is the MSX.

1541
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:54,500
Good choice.

1542
01:19:55,500 --> 01:20:02,500
Basically, the MSX, it was first released in 1983 by Microsoft.

1543
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:16,500
It was marketed initially in Japan by the director of, sorry, the vice president of Microsoft Japan at the time, Kazuhiko Nishii.

1544
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:21,500
It was basically meant to just help improve, you know, home computing at the time.

1545
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:24,500
It really was popular in Japan.

1546
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:31,500
It did spread across some other countries, but there were very few that were sold in the US,

1547
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:38,500
and this pretty much was the gaming system to have, well, apart from just being a computer,

1548
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:41,500
before the Nintendo came out, or the Famicom,

1549
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:49,500
and it is where a lot of series actually began their life, like the Metal Gear series for one thing.

1550
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:53,500
It was really well supported by Konami and Hudson.

1551
01:20:53,500 --> 01:20:58,500
So, people don't really know exactly what MSX stands for.

1552
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:04,500
A lot of people think that it's standard for Microsoft Extended, which was the operating system that came with it.

1553
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:11,500
It was Microsoft Extended Basic, and there were some that said machines with software exchangeability,

1554
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:14,500
or that it was even named after the MS Metal.

1555
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:21,500
So, most of the computers in the early 80s were manufactured in Japan.

1556
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:29,500
There was the NEC PC-6001 and the PC-8000 series, Fujitsu's FM series,

1557
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:37,500
which I had mentioned when talking about the Marty, and Hitachi did them.

1558
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:39,500
They were all over the place.

1559
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:45,500
And then we also had Panasonic, Canon, Casio, Yamaha, Sanyo were ones all trying to get in it.

1560
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:52,500
So, basically the MSX was an attempt to make a single industry standard for home computers.

1561
01:21:52,500 --> 01:22:01,500
Kind of like how VHS was standard for video, even though Sony really wanted the Betamax to be the thing.

1562
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:07,500
So, a lot of different electronic manufacturers really helped promote the MSX.

1563
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:11,500
They had Philips, Spectre Video, Goldstar behind them.

1564
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:22,500
And the big thing too is that it really was, it had a few things that really took it above some of the other systems.

1565
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:25,500
It really was made from off-the-shelf parts.

1566
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:32,500
The CPU was a 3.58 MHz Zilog Z80.

1567
01:22:32,500 --> 01:22:42,500
It had the Texas Instruments graphics chip, 16K of VRAM, which back then, that was pretty awesome.

1568
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:53,500
And then there were just so many things that made it supposed to be more affordable and easier to access a computer.

1569
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:59,500
They basically, instead of the big crazy competition that we were having over here,

1570
01:22:59,500 --> 01:23:07,500
like what was going on between the Commodore items and, you know, we had Coleco in the game and a few other things at the time,

1571
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:11,500
it basically didn't really have much of a rival there.

1572
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:17,500
There were different manufacturers of the MSX computer.

1573
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:23,500
Yamaha had been one, Canon did their own.

1574
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:28,500
So, it was fairly easy to adopt it and have games that would work on it.

1575
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:32,500
So, I'm going to skip past a little bit more of the technical side of it.

1576
01:23:32,500 --> 01:23:36,500
There were other iterations of the MSX computer that came out over time.

1577
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:49,500
They had, the MSX-1 actually had a joystick port, or you could use the arrow keys and spacebar for controlling games.

1578
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:51,500
There were things like that.

1579
01:23:52,500 --> 01:24:05,500
As far as the other versions that came out, there was the MSX in 83, the MSX-2 in 85, MSX-2 Plus in 88, and the MSX Turbo R in 90.

1580
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:11,500
After a while though, there were some revivals as well.

1581
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:23,500
In 2001, Nishi, the original promoter of the system, brought about this MSX revival around an emulator called the MSX Player.

1582
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:32,500
And it is the only official MSX emulator that's out there right now that is maintained by the MSX Association.

1583
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:35,500
There were a few other ones out there.

1584
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:41,500
It did have releases in other countries, so there's a European version of it.

1585
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:47,500
I think it was supposed to have been big, like in some of the South American countries as well.

1586
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:52,500
And then, in 2001, there was another revival.

1587
01:24:52,500 --> 01:25:02,500
There's an MSX kit called GreatBit, G-R-8-B-I-T, that was a DIY computer, and it was licensed by MSX.

1588
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:09,500
It's like a $500 kit, and you can put together a working MSX-2 compatible computer.

1589
01:25:09,500 --> 01:25:15,500
Except that it doesn't have chassis power supply, floppy disks, all the rest of it.

1590
01:25:15,500 --> 01:25:19,500
Maybe Loki could print one with his new 3D printer.

1591
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:23,500
Maybe Loki could print one with his new 3D printer.

1592
01:25:23,500 --> 01:25:29,500
Possibly, possibly. Really what you're buying is the processing parts of it.

1593
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:33,500
At least we could have an MSX in the US, because that's the thing that always blew my mind,

1594
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:37,500
is why we never really had it here like we had the other stuff. But anyway, I digress.

1595
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:42,500
They tried. It just didn't catch on. They had to deal with Commodore.

1596
01:25:42,500 --> 01:25:49,500
But there also is another MSX, I don't know that it's official,

1597
01:25:49,500 --> 01:25:55,500
but there were some people in a Korean forum who made a...

1598
01:25:55,500 --> 01:26:07,500
It's called the Mini IQ 3000 QT, that's basically a version of the IQ 2000,

1599
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:10,500
which was the MSX-2 made in Japan by Daewoo.

1600
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:16,500
It had some different goodies in it, but I don't think that it's actually officially licensed.

1601
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:24,500
So, moving on into what we have to think for having come out originally on the MSX is...

1602
01:26:24,500 --> 01:26:28,500
I'm just going to go over quite a few series.

1603
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:34,500
We had the ones that originated on MSX were Alastin Xanax,

1604
01:26:35,500 --> 01:26:37,500
Bomberan,

1605
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:39,500

1606
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:40,500

1607
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:41,500
Metal Gear,

1608
01:26:41,500 --> 01:26:42,500
Herodias,

1609
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:43,500
and Puyo Puyo,

1610
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:46,500
which you know me, I love my Puyo Puyo.

1611
01:26:46,500 --> 01:26:53,500
Others that had some version of them on the MSX,

1612
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:58,500
a few of them being unique to the system for the version that they got,

1613
01:26:58,500 --> 01:27:01,500
there was Castlevania came out as Vampire Killer,

1614
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:05,500
we had Contra, Dragon Quest, Dragon Slayer, Final Fantasy,

1615
01:27:05,500 --> 01:27:07,500
Gradius,

1616
01:27:07,500 --> 01:27:08,500

1617
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:09,500

1618
01:27:09,500 --> 01:27:10,500

Xavius,

1620
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:13,500
and Ys.

1621
01:27:13,500 --> 01:27:18,500
So, and like I said, there were a lot of companies that manufactured it.

1622
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:21,500
Just the original MSX, to go over the list,

1623
01:27:21,500 --> 01:27:23,500
there was Spectrum Video,

1624
01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:24,500

1625
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:25,500

1632
01:27:31,500 --> 01:27:32,500
Casio,

1633
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:33,500
Pioneer,

1634
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:34,500
Fujiki General,

1635
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:35,500
Yamaha,

1636
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:36,500
JDC,

1637
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:37,500

Sharp,

1644
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:44,500
and Palette.

1645
01:27:44,500 --> 01:27:47,500
Quite a few less for the MSX too.

1646
01:27:47,500 --> 01:27:51,500
So, but there you go, that's the MSX.

1647
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:55,500
All right, there it is, your classic system of the week,

1648
01:27:55,500 --> 01:27:57,500
the MSX.

1649
01:27:57,500 --> 01:28:00,500
It's one of those systems where it's like, sadly,

1650
01:28:00,500 --> 01:28:02,500
we just didn't really get to experience it here.

1651
01:28:02,500 --> 01:28:05,500
I mean, I guess they tried it, didn't catch on or whatever,

1652
01:28:05,500 --> 01:28:07,500
but yeah, it's one of those things where it's like,

1653
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:10,500
there's a lot of things worth looking at on this system.

1654
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:13,500
You know, especially like the actual sequel to Metal Gear,

1655
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:16,500
not the one we got on the NES here, was an MSX game.

1656
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:20,500
And I guess they did end up redoing that in one of those collections

1657
01:28:20,500 --> 01:28:21,500
on PS2 or PS3.

1658
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:23,500
I don't even remember now, right?

1659
01:28:23,500 --> 01:28:25,500
Well, yeah, they have.

1660
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:28,500
And you know what else came out on MSX?

1661
01:28:28,500 --> 01:28:29,500
Hm?

1662
01:28:29,500 --> 01:28:30,500
Gartic.

1663
01:28:30,500 --> 01:28:32,500
That's right.

1664
01:28:32,500 --> 01:28:33,500
That's right.

1665
01:28:33,500 --> 01:28:34,500
And that's the whole reason.

1666
01:28:34,500 --> 01:28:37,500
You know what else that came out on?

1667
01:28:37,500 --> 01:28:38,500
What?

1668
01:28:38,500 --> 01:28:43,500
It came out on iOS.

1669
01:28:43,500 --> 01:28:45,500
What came out on iOS?

1670
01:28:45,500 --> 01:28:46,500
Gartic.

1671
01:28:46,500 --> 01:28:48,500
It's on iOS?

1672
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:49,500
Yep.

1673
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:50,500
Oh, I had no idea.

1674
01:28:50,500 --> 01:28:51,500
I needed to check that out.

1675
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:54,500
That's awesome.

1676
01:28:54,500 --> 01:28:57,500
At least the dream of the Guardian Legend is still alive somewhere.

1677
01:28:57,500 --> 01:28:58,500
That's for sure.

1678
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:01,500
Dartitzy is confirming that the MSX Metal Gear was in.

1679
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:03,500
Metal Gear Solid 3 Subs...

1680
01:29:03,500 --> 01:29:04,500
Subs...

1681
01:29:04,500 --> 01:29:06,500
I can never say that word.

1682
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:08,500
The deluxe package that was on the PS2.

1683
01:29:08,500 --> 01:29:10,500
Yeah, I thought it went a ways back there.

1684
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:12,500
So there you have it.

1685
01:29:12,500 --> 01:29:13,500
All right.

1686
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:14,500
Yeah.

1687
01:29:14,500 --> 01:29:16,500
Well, Dark Sakura, anything else you want to say to the listeners

1688
01:29:16,500 --> 01:29:18,500
before we head out to break tonight?

1689
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:19,500
Resist.

1690
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:20,500
All right.

1691
01:29:20,500 --> 01:29:21,500
Have a good one, Dark Sakura.

1692
01:29:21,500 --> 01:29:22,500
Thank you for being here.

1693
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:23,500
I'll try.

1694
01:29:23,500 --> 01:29:24,500
Bye-bye.

1695
01:29:24,500 --> 01:29:25,500
Bye.

1696
01:29:25,500 --> 01:29:26,500
All right.

1697
01:29:26,500 --> 01:29:27,500
There it is.

1698
01:29:27,500 --> 01:29:29,500
Your classic system of the month.

1699
01:29:29,500 --> 01:29:31,500
We are about to head out to a break here.

1700
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:34,500
But before we do that, I understand our guests here in studio

1701
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:35,500
are going to head out.

1702
01:29:35,500 --> 01:29:37,500
But we want to thank you guys for being here.

1703
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:40,500
Again, the game is Little Tanks from Lead Money Games.

1704
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:42,500
And congrats again on the release.

1705
01:29:42,500 --> 01:29:46,500
And best of luck with the coming weeks and months of patches

1706
01:29:46,500 --> 01:29:48,500
and whatever you guys choose to do next.

1707
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:49,500
Yeah.

1708
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:50,500
Thanks a lot for having us.

1709
01:29:50,500 --> 01:29:51,500
Thank you so much.

1710
01:29:51,500 --> 01:29:52,500
No problem.

1711
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:53,500
Good luck.

1712
01:29:53,500 --> 01:29:55,500
I hope it helps get the word out a little bit there.

1713
01:29:55,500 --> 01:29:57,500
Definitely take your game out there to different shows, expos.

1714
01:29:57,500 --> 01:29:59,500
I think it's one of those things where more people get their hands on it.

1715
01:29:59,500 --> 01:30:01,500
You know, they'll be able to, you know,

1716
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:03,500
oh, yeah, I got to download that game when I get home on Steam.

1717
01:30:03,500 --> 01:30:05,500
So good luck with the IndieCade submission and all that stuff.

1718
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:06,500
Thanks.

1719
01:30:06,500 --> 01:30:07,500
You're welcome.

1720
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:08,500
All right.

1721
01:30:08,500 --> 01:30:09,500
Thanks for being here, especially live.

1722
01:30:09,500 --> 01:30:10,500
A lot of people don't come here live.

1723
01:30:10,500 --> 01:30:12,500
And I know you came in from the Bay Area on a holiday nonetheless.

1724
01:30:12,500 --> 01:30:13,500
So we really appreciate it.

1725
01:30:13,500 --> 01:30:14,500
Yeah.

1726
01:30:14,500 --> 01:30:15,500
All right.

1727
01:30:15,500 --> 01:30:19,500
We're going to go to a quick break, though, here at the Voice Geeks Network.

1728
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:22,500
When we come back, there is plenty more of a show to come,

1729
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:24,500
including some more information on Minecraft,

1730
01:30:24,500 --> 01:30:26,500
Skype releasing on the Xbox One,

1731
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:31,500
and some interesting regulations in Germany for live streamers.

1732
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:32,500
Yeah, check that out.

1733
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:36,500
Will we return with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this?

1734
01:30:36,500 --> 01:30:42,500
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

1735
01:30:42,500 --> 01:30:44,500
Live tonight, episode number 683.

1736
01:30:44,500 --> 01:30:48,500
For this April the 16th of 2017, the second half of our show,

1737
01:30:48,500 --> 01:30:50,500
live at vognetwork.com.

1738
01:30:50,500 --> 01:30:52,500
Just Loki and I left in the studio.

1739
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:55,500
Our pals from Lead Money Games have taken off, heading back home.

1740
01:30:55,500 --> 01:30:57,500
We learned all about their game, Lil' Tanks,

1741
01:30:57,500 --> 01:30:59,500
which you can listen back to if you're just joining us tonight.

1742
01:30:59,500 --> 01:31:01,500
You can hear that on the podcast feed,

1743
01:31:01,500 --> 01:31:03,500
which should be on our YouTube channel.

1744
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:05,500
Did you buy it during the show? Oh, good.

1745
01:31:05,500 --> 01:31:06,500
It does look interesting.

1746
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:09,500
I like the idea of the whole kind of RPG elements in an arcade game.

1747
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:10,500
I think that's pretty cool.

1748
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:11,500
Yeah, yeah, I like that.

1749
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:13,500
I'm about to steal ideas.

1750
01:31:13,500 --> 01:31:15,500
You mean be inspired by it?

1751
01:31:15,500 --> 01:31:16,500
Inspired, yes, right.

1752
01:31:16,500 --> 01:31:17,500
Not steal.

1753
01:31:17,500 --> 01:31:19,500
There's no stealing in games.

1754
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:20,500
Not really.

1755
01:31:20,500 --> 01:31:23,500
And Loki is trying to convince me to make this programming thing happen.

1756
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:26,500
I was trying to throw some ideas out there during the break.

1757
01:31:26,500 --> 01:31:27,500
I stole it.

1758
01:31:27,500 --> 01:31:28,500
We can do it.

1759
01:31:28,500 --> 01:31:29,500
We can do it.

1760
01:31:29,500 --> 01:31:30,500
We can do it.

1761
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:32,500
I was trying to throw some ideas out there during the break.

1762
01:31:32,500 --> 01:31:33,500
I stole it.

1763
01:31:33,500 --> 01:31:34,500
We could do that.

1764
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:35,500
I mean, that's fine.

1765
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:38,500
I guess the idea I had exists somewhere, so I don't want to.

1766
01:31:38,500 --> 01:31:39,500
I'm sure every game exists.

1767
01:31:39,500 --> 01:31:40,500
Does it?

1768
01:31:40,500 --> 01:31:42,500
Let's just rip off a 2,600 game.

1769
01:31:42,500 --> 01:31:46,500
Let's just take a 2,600 game and make it porn, and that'll be the game.

1770
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:48,500
2,600 game and make it porn?

1771
01:31:48,500 --> 01:31:51,500
Yeah, take a 2,600 game and make it porn.

1772
01:31:51,500 --> 01:31:52,500
Oh.

1773
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:55,500
Everybody loves porn or ultra-violent.

1774
01:31:55,500 --> 01:31:56,500
I like ultra-violent.

1775
01:31:56,500 --> 01:31:58,500
Okay, we can do ultra-violent.

1776
01:31:58,500 --> 01:31:59,500
What's an ultra-friendly?

1777
01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:00,500
Combat.

1778
01:32:00,500 --> 01:32:01,500
Everybody's played combat.

1779
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:02,500
There you go.

1780
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:03,500
We'll make an ultra-violent combat game.

1781
01:32:03,500 --> 01:32:05,500
We're going to make combat, but it's ultra-violent.

1782
01:32:05,500 --> 01:32:07,500
I like it.

1783
01:32:07,500 --> 01:32:12,500
When the little tanks shoot each other, when one tank explodes, it sets on fire.

1784
01:32:12,500 --> 01:32:13,500
People start screaming.

1785
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:14,500
It'll be awesome.

1786
01:32:14,500 --> 01:32:15,500
Right, Loki?

1787
01:32:15,500 --> 01:32:16,500
All right.

1788
01:32:16,500 --> 01:32:17,500
Let's do it.

1789
01:32:17,500 --> 01:32:19,500
I'll start working on mocking something up.

1790
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:20,500
All right.

1791
01:32:20,500 --> 01:32:21,500
Sounds good.

1792
01:32:21,500 --> 01:32:24,500
Look, I'm with JD in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

1793
01:32:24,500 --> 01:32:25,500
Usually, I would agree.

1794
01:32:25,500 --> 01:32:26,500
Porn is better than ultra-violent.

1795
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:30,500
You guys know I hate shit like the Saw movies and all that stuff.

1796
01:32:30,500 --> 01:32:32,500
But it's hard making a porn combat game.

1797
01:32:32,500 --> 01:32:34,500
It's hard making a porn combat game.

1798
01:32:34,500 --> 01:32:37,500
We could do that, and that might be inappropriate, but yeah.

1799
01:32:37,500 --> 01:32:40,500
When ultra-violence is over the top, then it's funny.

1800
01:32:40,500 --> 01:32:43,500
When it's like the itchy and scratchy show, I can deal with that.

1801
01:32:43,500 --> 01:32:45,500
That's what I mean when I say ultra-violent.

1802
01:32:45,500 --> 01:32:48,500
Or the Happy Tree Friends, which apparently is on Netflix now.

1803
01:32:48,500 --> 01:32:49,500
Did you know that?

1804
01:32:49,500 --> 01:32:50,500
No, I did not.

1805
01:32:50,500 --> 01:32:52,500
I was looking through Netflix the other night, and there it is.

1806
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:54,500
I'm like, that shit is like 10 years old.

1807
01:32:54,500 --> 01:32:56,500
I saw that Sausage Fest was on Netflix.

1808
01:32:56,500 --> 01:32:57,500
Yes.

1809
01:32:57,500 --> 01:32:59,500
So I noticed that.

1810
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:06,500
And also, was it, it was a, I forget the, I got the subtitle too.

1811
01:33:06,500 --> 01:33:08,500
I can't remember what the beginning is.

1812
01:33:08,500 --> 01:33:11,500
It's, I think it's like Kimbo and the Two Strings or something like that.

1813
01:33:11,500 --> 01:33:12,500
It was really good.

1814
01:33:12,500 --> 01:33:13,500
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1815
01:33:13,500 --> 01:33:17,500
JD in chat says genital jousting did a pretty good porn combat game.

1816
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:20,500
Yeah, it was kind of stupid looking though.

1817
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:23,500
But yes, it does, it is quite graphic.

1818
01:33:23,500 --> 01:33:26,500
I don't know how you make genital jousting look elegant, but all right.

1819
01:33:26,500 --> 01:33:27,500
Anyway.

1820
01:33:27,500 --> 01:33:32,500
Because they basically had penises, but the penises had asses on them as well.

1821
01:33:32,500 --> 01:33:37,500
I don't remember the point of the game, but I just know that you're supposed to stick your penis into another penis's ass.

1822
01:33:37,500 --> 01:33:39,500
Well, that happens sometimes.

1823
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:41,500
Which is weird.

1824
01:33:41,500 --> 01:33:43,500
Moving on.

1825
01:33:43,500 --> 01:33:47,500
Let's get into some rapid fire news, Loki.

1826
01:33:47,500 --> 01:33:49,500
Yes, so.

1827
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:51,500
This is kind of cool.

1828
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:54,500
Race the Sun is a game that's been out for a while now.

1829
01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:57,500
And they're going to be adding PlayStation VR support.

1830
01:33:57,500 --> 01:33:59,500
A new mode and some other stuff.

1831
01:33:59,500 --> 01:34:01,500
And it's all going to be a free update.

1832
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:03,500
And it's coming out in a couple days.

1833
01:34:03,500 --> 01:34:07,500
April 18th, it's going to be adding the PlayStation VR headset mode.

1834
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:08,500
Relaxing.

1835
01:34:08,500 --> 01:34:11,500
There's a new game mode called Sunrise.

1836
01:34:11,500 --> 01:34:17,500
And I guess with that one, there's no high score or progressive.

1837
01:34:17,500 --> 01:34:21,500
I guess there's no high score to chase or progressive difficulty.

1838
01:34:21,500 --> 01:34:23,500
So you just keep going?

1839
01:34:23,500 --> 01:34:26,500
I mean, I don't really know what the point is then.

1840
01:34:26,500 --> 01:34:27,500
I don't know. We'll see.

1841
01:34:27,500 --> 01:34:28,500
But yeah.

1842
01:34:28,500 --> 01:34:33,500
I like Race the Sun and like VR, so it sounds good.

1843
01:34:33,500 --> 01:34:37,500
Now this, of course, when I saw this, I immediately thought of Rob.

1844
01:34:37,500 --> 01:34:43,500
There's this new game mode being added to Grand Theft Auto Online called Land Grab.

1845
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:45,500
Now it doesn't sound that interesting.

1846
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:53,500
However, it basically involves four teams fighting in neon colored cyberspace for territory.

1847
01:34:53,500 --> 01:34:55,500
So it's basically Tron.

1848
01:34:55,500 --> 01:35:02,500
And I guess there's a whole double XP thing that they're doing right now.

1849
01:35:02,500 --> 01:35:10,500
You're going to earn double cash and RP rewards between now and April 24th.

1850
01:35:11,500 --> 01:35:16,500
So I really do need to go back to play Grand Theft Auto 5 and online.

1851
01:35:16,500 --> 01:35:18,500
I've been off of that for a while.

1852
01:35:18,500 --> 01:35:21,500
Didn't Saints Row kind of try to do the online Tron thing already?

1853
01:35:21,500 --> 01:35:24,500
They did. They really...

1854
01:35:24,500 --> 01:35:30,500
I mean, they didn't three for a little section and that was alright and it was silly.

1855
01:35:30,500 --> 01:35:37,500
And then they went full bore into fucking four and it was just too much.

1856
01:35:37,500 --> 01:35:40,500
I still need to play the Goat Simulator sci-fi expansion.

1857
01:35:40,500 --> 01:35:42,500
Yeah, that looks funny.

1858
01:35:42,500 --> 01:35:52,500
I mean, Saints Row 4, I really dog on this.

1859
01:35:52,500 --> 01:35:59,500
Saints Row 4, if you've played Saints Row 3 enough, you realize how much of a reskin that game just is.

1860
01:35:59,500 --> 01:36:03,500
It's just the same shit all over again.

1861
01:36:03,500 --> 01:36:09,500
And whereas Saints Row 1 and 2, the different side missions, things they did that were ridiculous,

1862
01:36:09,500 --> 01:36:13,500
but they kind of had a little bit of a story that made it seem like it was more of like,

1863
01:36:13,500 --> 01:36:19,500
okay, this is why I'm this. It's silly doing the insurance fraud, but I'm getting money because this guy said,

1864
01:36:19,500 --> 01:36:23,500
oh yeah, I need some more clients and go make me money this way.

1865
01:36:23,500 --> 01:36:25,500
And that was cool.

1866
01:36:25,500 --> 01:36:32,500
But in Saints Row 3 and 4, it was just like, this is just a side mission, do it.

1867
01:36:32,500 --> 01:36:38,500
Well, at least instead of doing like Saints Row 5, they're going this direction with the agents of mayhem

1868
01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:43,500
and kind of trying something new. So maybe this will be a good kind of palate cleanser for, you know, volition.

1869
01:36:43,500 --> 01:36:49,500
I'm very disappointed. I do want a new Saints Row game. Just not like this. Not like this.

1870
01:36:49,500 --> 01:36:55,500
All right. Moving on to some other rapid fire news. Nintendo is doing some online maintenance.

1871
01:36:55,500 --> 01:37:00,500
That's right. They need to bring the servers down so they can launch their new online program.

1872
01:37:00,500 --> 01:37:04,500
Just kidding. I made that up. We don't know when they're ever going to launch their online program,

1873
01:37:04,500 --> 01:37:09,500
but the reality is the servers are coming down. So, you know, if you're playing games on the Switch,

1874
01:37:09,500 --> 01:37:14,500
which you could be playing fast RMX or Bomberman or something on the Switch,

1875
01:37:14,500 --> 01:37:21,500
the servers will be coming down on Monday, April 17th for two hours at 5 p.m. Pacific,

1876
01:37:21,500 --> 01:37:26,500
which is so weird that it's right in the middle of the freaking day. But to be fair, it is midnight Greenwich time.

1877
01:37:26,500 --> 01:37:31,500
So, you know, that's I guess you're going to piss off some time zone one way or another.

1878
01:37:31,500 --> 01:37:36,500
I was speaking of pissing people off in Nintendo. We were talking earlier about the NES classic production stuff

1879
01:37:36,500 --> 01:37:43,500
and how they're also ending the Famicom one as well. Yeah. They're not ending that permanently.

1880
01:37:43,500 --> 01:37:50,500
You know, I know we said temporary. Yes. So that kind of brings back the whole, you know, that they're revising the thing.

1881
01:37:50,500 --> 01:37:55,500
I'm sure. I'm sure. Yeah, no, no. I'd mentioned that they had only said temporary and that that's leaving the door open more

1882
01:37:55,500 --> 01:38:04,500
to a 2.0. I'm sure. We'll see. Time will tell. Anyway, moving on to Wednesday, April 19th is the second offline.

1883
01:38:04,500 --> 01:38:11,500
That is all of it. All the services will be coming offline for an hour and 45 minutes at 645 p.m.

1884
01:38:11,500 --> 01:38:17,500
Hour time Pacific time. That's 945 on the East Coast or 145 in the morning in GMT.

1885
01:38:17,500 --> 01:38:22,500
So that's online play and rankings and all that on the 3DS, the Wii U and the Switch.

1886
01:38:22,500 --> 01:38:27,500
That is so they can pull the plug permanently on the Wii U. Just kidding. I made that up, too.

1887
01:38:27,500 --> 01:38:32,500
I need to stop making up news. Sorry, guys. I just they don't ever say why they're doing this besides maintenance.

1888
01:38:32,500 --> 01:38:40,500
But maintenance isn't that exciting, is it? Well, as we mentioned earlier in the show, Star Wars Battlefront 2 has been officially unveiled.

1889
01:38:40,500 --> 01:38:44,500
They are doing the big Star Wars Fan Expo in Orlando right now or just wrapped up today.

1890
01:38:44,500 --> 01:38:49,500
I had some friends that went. I'm a little hatefully jealous of that. Did you watch the new trailer, by the way?

1891
01:38:49,500 --> 01:38:56,500
I know the whole Internet's talking about it, which really I mean, it was cool and all, but it didn't really show shit.

1892
01:38:56,500 --> 01:39:00,500
Good. I'm glad that's what a teaser is supposed to do, I suppose, is just tease a little bit.

1893
01:39:00,500 --> 01:39:05,500
I don't want them to give away all the endings because people are going to analyze that shit.

1894
01:39:05,500 --> 01:39:10,500
That's how they get the four hour YouTube analysis about the 30 second teaser about.

1895
01:39:10,500 --> 01:39:16,500
Well, since we saw this in one screenshot, it must mean that so we saw Poe Dameron with BB-8.

1896
01:39:16,500 --> 01:39:20,500
So this must mean it's just, you know, stop, stop, stop overanalyzing.

1897
01:39:20,500 --> 01:39:24,500
Yeah, after I watched that, then I watched the new Transformers trailer and I'm like, what the fuck happened to that series?

1898
01:39:24,500 --> 01:39:28,500
Like, I don't even know what the hell's going on now. Who knows?

1899
01:39:28,500 --> 01:39:34,500
All right. Anyway, so also, of course, we have Star Wars Battlefront 2, as we were mentioning earlier in the show.

1900
01:39:34,500 --> 01:39:38,500
They did show a video, so there's a trailer out there you guys can watch if you haven't seen it yet.

1901
01:39:38,500 --> 01:39:44,500
But it also shows the campaign mode. You're going to get to play as a member of an Imperial Special Forces unit.

1902
01:39:44,500 --> 01:39:47,500
DICE, Motive, Criterion are all working on this game.

1903
01:39:47,500 --> 01:39:53,500
You're going to get to play as heroes from the upcoming The Last Jedi film if you actually preorder.

1904
01:39:53,500 --> 01:39:58,500
There's not a lot of extra information besides that just now.

1905
01:39:58,500 --> 01:40:02,500
It will be released later this year. PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1906
01:40:02,500 --> 01:40:07,500
So PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 have been cut out of the picture.

1907
01:40:07,500 --> 01:40:10,500
Although actually, I don't think that those systems had Battlefront 1, did they?

1908
01:40:10,500 --> 01:40:12,500
I don't think they did. I can't remember.

1909
01:40:12,500 --> 01:40:15,500
But I mean, of course, it makes sense that we've moved on from those systems now.

1910
01:40:15,500 --> 01:40:17,500
So it's PC, PS4 and Xbox One.

1911
01:40:17,500 --> 01:40:22,500
But it's going to be nice that we're going to have a single-player mode in this will be really nice, for one.

1912
01:40:22,500 --> 01:40:30,500
And then also the fact they've come out and said that there's not going to be any season pass for this, which is nice as well.

1913
01:40:30,500 --> 01:40:31,500
Allegedly.

1914
01:40:31,500 --> 01:40:35,500
Allegedly. That doesn't mean they won't do DLC, but they're not going to do any season pass.

1915
01:40:35,500 --> 01:40:38,500
We'll see. I'll be curious to see what develops with that.

1916
01:40:38,500 --> 01:40:41,500
I'm sure we will hear more about it at E3.

1917
01:40:41,500 --> 01:40:47,500
So, in the meantime, let's move on to what is coming out in stores this week, Loki.

1918
01:40:47,500 --> 01:40:55,500
Alright, so this week we've got Full Throttle Remastered on PC, PlayStation 4 and the Vita.

1919
01:40:55,500 --> 01:41:02,500
Guardians of the Galaxy, the Telltale series, episode 1, Tangled Up in Blue is going to be making its way out.

1920
01:41:02,500 --> 01:41:07,500
PC, Mac, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, iOS and Android.

1921
01:41:07,500 --> 01:41:12,500
The Disney Afternoon Collection on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1922
01:41:12,500 --> 01:41:15,500
The Silver Case on PlayStation 4.

1923
01:41:15,500 --> 01:41:23,500
Wonder Boy, the Dragon's Trap on the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1924
01:41:23,500 --> 01:41:30,500
And finally, Micro Machines World Series on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1925
01:41:30,500 --> 01:41:33,500
Man, it's been a while since we had a Micro Machines game.

1926
01:41:33,500 --> 01:41:37,500
Yeah, it has been a little while. So, cool.

1927
01:41:37,500 --> 01:41:42,500
Let's travel to Japan real quick and then hopefully you can do the UK dates as well, Loki, since Dark Soccer is not here.

1928
01:41:42,500 --> 01:41:46,500
Going to Japan real quick on the PlayStation 4.

1929
01:41:46,500 --> 01:41:52,500
Let's see, coming out on the...what is the day here? I think the release day...

1930
01:41:52,500 --> 01:41:56,500
I don't know, there's a lot this week, actually. I think the 20th is the day they get in their games.

1931
01:41:56,500 --> 01:42:00,500
Yeah, looks like we get Dark Souls 3, the Fire Fades edition.

1932
01:42:00,500 --> 01:42:04,500
That must be the DLC all-in-one type of thing that's coming out there.

1933
01:42:04,500 --> 01:42:09,500
There's a vertical stand coming out if you need one of those to hold your PlayStation 4 upright.

1934
01:42:09,500 --> 01:42:13,500
There's also Parappa the Rappa is getting its physical release in Japan.

1935
01:42:13,500 --> 01:42:15,500
I remember that was the thing that's happening.

1936
01:42:15,500 --> 01:42:17,500
So that is all happening on the 20th.

1937
01:42:17,500 --> 01:42:26,500
The Vita is welcoming Dungeon Travelers 2 to Yamiochi no Otomo to Hajimari no Shou in regular and premium edition.

1938
01:42:26,500 --> 01:42:30,500
And then One Piece Burning Blood gets a price reduction this week on the Vita.

1939
01:42:30,500 --> 01:42:35,500
I see on the Switch this week, there actually is a new game on the Switch this week.

1940
01:42:35,500 --> 01:42:39,500
Mina de Wai Wai Spelunker is out this week.

1941
01:42:39,500 --> 01:42:45,500
It looks like it is one of those Spelunky kind of games, but it looks like it's multiplayer with that.

1942
01:42:45,500 --> 01:42:51,500
So this is not something I've heard about getting a US release, but I know it's so easy to do the worldwide releases now.

1943
01:42:51,500 --> 01:42:56,500
So I imagine it's just a matter of time before we get that over here as well.

1944
01:42:56,500 --> 01:43:00,500
Then I think the 3DS does still have some stuff coming out this week.

1945
01:43:00,500 --> 01:43:04,500
Oh yes, a new Fire Emblem game on the 3DS, so that'll be a big deal.

1946
01:43:04,500 --> 01:43:10,500
Fire Emblem Echoes Mojitori no Iyou comes out in regular and limited edition.

1947
01:43:10,500 --> 01:43:15,500
There are new Fire Emblem figures for Amiibo coming out to celebrate that as well.

1948
01:43:15,500 --> 01:43:21,500
But if Fire Emblem isn't your thing, you could check out Pro Yaku Famista Climax comes out this week.

1949
01:43:21,500 --> 01:43:25,500
That, of course, being a baseball game from Bandai Damko.

1950
01:43:25,500 --> 01:43:28,500
So that's it for your Japanese releases. How about the UK, Loki?

1951
01:43:28,500 --> 01:43:33,500
The UK, we have the Disney Afternoon Collection on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

1952
01:43:33,500 --> 01:43:37,500
Voodoo Vince Remastered on Xbox One and PC.

1953
01:43:37,500 --> 01:43:44,500
Siberia 3, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PC, the Nintendo Switch, and Mac.

1954
01:43:44,500 --> 01:43:48,500
And finally, everything on PC.

1955
01:43:48,500 --> 01:43:50,500
Everything is out.

1956
01:43:50,500 --> 01:43:51,500
Everything is out.

1957
01:43:51,500 --> 01:43:52,500
Everything you've always been waiting for.

1958
01:43:52,500 --> 01:43:55,500
It's all coming out at once. Everything.

1959
01:43:55,500 --> 01:43:57,500
Let's go to the mailbag!

1960
01:44:03,500 --> 01:44:05,500
Every week, you guys email us.

1961
01:44:05,500 --> 01:44:11,500
Participate at orangeloungeradio.com, and we read some of our favorite emails here on the show.

1962
01:44:11,500 --> 01:44:15,500
We're going to start off this week with an email from Rettertainment, who starts off,

1963
01:44:15,500 --> 01:44:17,500
Hello, LR.

1964
01:44:17,500 --> 01:44:24,500
After getting a taste of Bree from the Sacramento IGDA's thoughts regarding the inclusion of sexuality in Mass Effect,

1965
01:44:24,500 --> 01:44:27,500
I started ruminating about the subject myself.

1966
01:44:27,500 --> 01:44:31,500
Yes, this includes more than just me frequently watching the scenes in Mass Effect on YouTube.

1967
01:44:31,500 --> 01:44:37,500
This involved deep thought about the very nature of how depictions of sexuality fit into the media form that is video games.

1968
01:44:37,500 --> 01:44:40,500
To that end, I've come up with the following perspective.

1969
01:44:40,500 --> 01:44:46,500
Why do people like watching shows like Desperate Housewives, Hotel Babylon, and many American soap operas?

1970
01:44:46,500 --> 01:44:51,500
Those shows are trashy in the sense that shows like that tease the audience with sexual content,

1971
01:44:51,500 --> 01:44:57,500
occasionally indulging the audience in that content, while also being generally a form of lighthearted escapism.

1972
01:44:57,500 --> 01:45:00,500
Why do people adore the music of Kylie Minogue? She's trashy.

1973
01:45:00,500 --> 01:45:06,500
Hey, watch it, Rettertainment. She's a goddess. You better watch your step.

1974
01:45:06,500 --> 01:45:11,500
Anyway, why do you have to diss? Of all the artists in the world, why Kylie? What did Kylie Minogue do to you?

1975
01:45:11,500 --> 01:45:15,500
Anyway, sorry, back to the email from Rettertainment.

1976
01:45:15,500 --> 01:45:23,500
Yeah, JD in chat was like, whoa, you just offended like every gay in the world.

1977
01:45:24,500 --> 01:45:31,500
You better step off our queen, Rettertainment. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. All right, look, moving on, continuing on.

1978
01:45:31,500 --> 01:45:40,500
She is, look, part of the reason why Kylie Minogue is awesome is that there is like a little bit of, actually there's a lot of camp to Kylie Minogue that's a lot of fun.

1979
01:45:40,500 --> 01:45:45,500
Anyway, ActDeaf says, I thought Gaga was the queen.

1980
01:45:45,500 --> 01:45:53,500
See, that's kind of like, like Gaga's like kind of like the mainstream thing, but like Kylie Minogue's kind of still that one that like, oh, not everybody's into her.

1981
01:45:53,500 --> 01:45:59,500
You know, same thing with Carly Rae Jepsen, like you're more underground if you're a Carly Rae Jepsen stan than a Gaga.

1982
01:45:59,500 --> 01:46:08,500
Everybody fucking likes Lady Gaga, but Carly Rae Jepsen? Have you heard the word of the gospel called emotion? Side B and Side A?

1983
01:46:08,500 --> 01:46:13,500
Anyway, why do people like Fifty Shades of Grey? It is trashy.

1984
01:46:13,500 --> 01:46:21,500
Okay, now that I'll agree with. Why do people like most reality programming? I have no goddamn motherfucking idea. Sorry, slipped for a moment there. It is trashy.

1985
01:46:21,500 --> 01:46:30,500
Should we see many of the depictions of sexuality and video games in the same light? Is the sex in Grand Theft Auto trashy? Is the sex in The Witcher trashy?

1986
01:46:30,500 --> 01:46:34,500
Does the St. Rose series revel in being trashy? Yes, yes, and goddamn it, yes.

1987
01:46:34,500 --> 01:46:43,500
Should we see the sexuality depicted in Mass Effect as trashy escapism with no real attachment to reality in our society as we know it?

1988
01:46:43,500 --> 01:46:55,500
Sure, the people at BioWare are trying to sell these games as a great example of storytelling, but if they admitted to Mass Effect being a sort of trashy escapism, the right wing media would be more on their asses than they are for their depiction of alien asses.

1989
01:46:56,500 --> 01:47:01,500
Now for another deep question. Which product do you think will be made available to the public first?

1990
01:47:01,500 --> 01:47:04,500
A. The game Loki is working on.

1991
01:47:04,500 --> 01:47:08,500
B. Crumple, the game Gabe from the Sacramento IGDA is working on.

1992
01:47:08,500 --> 01:47:17,500
C. It was in a coffee shop. The book I have that is currently available for pre-order on ink shares. Cheap plug. Well done, Retertainment, well done.

1993
01:47:17,500 --> 01:47:31,500
I would go with option B due to option B being exponentially more popular than option C, as well as option B having something option A doesn't have whose value is hard to quantify. A name. Stay black, Retertainment.

1994
01:47:31,500 --> 01:47:36,500
This message was brought to you by Apricot Heffenweizen. It is like fruit that gets you drunk.

1995
01:47:36,500 --> 01:47:46,500
So, which game will come out first? I agree, Crumple is going to come out first because I really, really think Gabe is like close on that. I think they're just tying up a few loose ends and that's going to be out.

1996
01:47:46,500 --> 01:47:55,500
So, but why would you, if your book isn't done, why did you throw that in there? So the question is, what's going to be done first, Crumple or your book?

1997
01:47:55,500 --> 01:48:01,500
I think you should, I think you should push and get that book done. Maybe you can beat Gabe. Maybe it will be option C. We'll see.

1998
01:48:01,500 --> 01:48:09,500
But if you trash Kylie Minogue in that book, I swear to God, I'm going to write a one star review. No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. But don't trash Kylie Minogue, she's awesome.

1999
01:48:09,500 --> 01:48:20,500
Alright, moving on. One more email this week from Unsigned here and I'm not sure if I want to read the actual email address, so I'm just going to say it's Unsigned.

2000
01:48:20,500 --> 01:48:31,500
Oh, it says Love, Sam. So this email is from Sam. Hello, OLR crew. I might love the show. The answer to your question is yes. The Scorpio will be $600, but that's okay.

2001
01:48:31,500 --> 01:48:42,500
There will also be a $400 SKU with a small hard drive and no Blu-ray. Problem solved. Love, Sam and Rob and Dark Sakura and Loki. Those are very strange emails. Is that insider info?

2002
01:48:42,500 --> 01:48:53,500
I'm not going to strip a Blu-ray from the system. That makes sense. No, I mean, I understand there's a licensing fee that goes with that and everything, but you're not going to knock $200 off the price by just making it not play movies.

2003
01:48:53,500 --> 01:48:57,500
It is a 4K Blu-ray in the Scorpio.

2004
01:48:57,500 --> 01:49:12,500
Yeah, I don't know. I mean, hey, I'm going to file this email away in the whole, like, check back in this email after E3 and then if it comes out that there's something to this, I'll email the guy back going, what else do you know? I'll just file this away.

2005
01:49:12,500 --> 01:49:22,500
Otherwise, well, okay, let's humor it for just half a second here. Could there be more than one version of Project Scorpio?

2006
01:49:22,500 --> 01:49:33,500
I don't think that they would do that. I mean, there could be, but if they do do multiple SKUs, they'll be different hard drive sizes, but they have a one terabyte versions. What's spec debt right now?

2007
01:49:33,500 --> 01:49:40,500
I don't know if they would really, I don't know. I don't think they would do that.

2008
01:49:40,500 --> 01:49:44,500
I don't think so either because I mean, Scorpio is going to be a hard sell.

2009
01:49:44,500 --> 01:49:46,500
Or if they do like colors or bundles or something like that.

2010
01:49:46,500 --> 01:49:50,500
Scorpio, I still think Scorpio is a hard sell as it is. I'm not getting this.

2011
01:49:50,500 --> 01:50:01,500
It is because 4K televisions, I mean, they're out there, but it's not like, I don't know, it's not, people aren't really feeling compulsive by that yet.

2012
01:50:01,500 --> 01:50:08,500
It's not like HD was where like all of a sudden all these different providers are offering, you know, 4K services.

2013
01:50:08,500 --> 01:50:19,500
I don't think, like as far as like, I have Comcast right now, which I don't even really use TV through them and may drop the TV, but I was looking at it and I'm like, I don't even know what 4K offerings they have.

2014
01:50:19,500 --> 01:50:22,500
I know Netflix, I think has 4K.

2015
01:50:22,500 --> 01:50:24,500
They do. It's limited, but they do.

2016
01:50:24,500 --> 01:50:30,500
But I don't know who offers it. So why would I upgrade unless I'm really buying a lot of those 4K Blu-rays?

2017
01:50:30,500 --> 01:50:42,500
I don't know if I'd really want it. And here's the thing too, like I used to have a surround sound system in my house, but it's so loud that like we don't use it anymore because I mean, it would wake up the kids if we were watching a movie with that.

2018
01:50:42,500 --> 01:50:50,500
I mean, it's cool, but like I would think if you want to upgrade your TV to 4K and stuff to really enjoy that, you'd want to have the sound and everything.

2019
01:50:50,500 --> 01:51:00,500
And I don't know, it's just, when they come down in price more, I'll pick one up, but I think right now there's not a whole lot of content on 4K for me.

2020
01:51:00,500 --> 01:51:02,500
It's just like it was with 3D TVs.

2021
01:51:02,500 --> 01:51:09,500
Yeah, over in chat over at live.voggenetware.com, Bob Coffee says there's like no 4K broadcast content.

2022
01:51:09,500 --> 01:51:11,500
Netflix and other streaming services offer that.

2023
01:51:11,500 --> 01:51:18,500
But that reminds me, now that you say 3D TVs, I forgot all about that update to the PlayStation VR. I totally need to watch Tron Legacy now.

2024
01:51:18,500 --> 01:51:19,500
Oh yeah, you do.

2025
01:51:19,500 --> 01:51:20,500
I totally need to do it.

2026
01:51:20,500 --> 01:51:22,500
I have The Lion King in 3D if you want to watch that.

2027
01:51:22,500 --> 01:51:24,500
Fuck The Lion King, I don't give a shit about that.

2028
01:51:24,500 --> 01:51:27,500
What about the kids? Oh wait, kids shouldn't do the 3D, I forget.

2029
01:51:27,500 --> 01:51:33,500
Ah, I've never let warning labels stop me from having them do that. They love that kind of shit.

2030
01:51:33,500 --> 01:51:34,500
It builds character.

2031
01:51:35,500 --> 01:51:41,500
Alright, thank you for the emails, you guys. Participate at orangeloungeradio.com if you want to send us an email in the future.

2032
01:51:41,500 --> 01:51:47,500
In the meantime, we have more news before we get to the Skype line over at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

2033
01:51:47,500 --> 01:51:55,500
Let's talk about Minecraft, like my son likes to do all the time, except now he's talking mostly about Super Mario Run, which is also irritating after a while.

2034
01:51:56,500 --> 01:51:59,500
But, it's just the quantity of it.

2035
01:51:59,500 --> 01:52:09,500
So, Microsoft is opening a brand new Minecraft online store selling both the user and Microsoft created content.

2036
01:52:09,500 --> 01:52:13,500
So, you know, mods and things, they're going to be selling those now.

2037
01:52:13,500 --> 01:52:18,500
Whereas, you know, on the PC version, which is still out there, you can get that stuff for free.

2038
01:52:18,500 --> 01:52:31,500
Whatever. So, they're doing that on the Pocket and Windows 10 versions of the game, which mine is still fucked up and I can't download it again because my Microsoft account is all sorts of screwy.

2039
01:52:31,500 --> 01:52:32,500
That's annoying.

2040
01:52:32,500 --> 01:52:40,500
But, they're going to be allowing you to transfer your purchases back and forth between your multiple Microsoft accounts because it's going to be tied to your Xbox Live account.

2041
01:52:40,500 --> 01:52:45,500
So, I don't know if this is going to come into the Xbox One version or anything like that, but that would be kind of cool.

2042
01:52:46,500 --> 01:52:53,500
I don't know really what they're offering, if it's just going to be like mods, because they have a whole mod system that you can do.

2043
01:52:53,500 --> 01:52:54,500
And I think this is optional stuff.

2044
01:52:54,500 --> 01:52:58,500
I think it's said straight up, not mods, but more like the cosmetic stuff.

2045
01:52:58,500 --> 01:53:06,500
But, that's still very interesting because I seem to recall a time when they were going to try to sell this stuff for Oblivion, remember that, in Steam.

2046
01:53:06,500 --> 01:53:13,500
But, the community pushed back big time where Steam and Bethesda had to be like, whoa, guys, I'm just kidding, we're not really going to do that.

2047
01:53:13,500 --> 01:53:17,500
But, I think that's why mods aren't included. It's only like cosmetics.

2048
01:53:17,500 --> 01:53:22,500
Yeah, Microsoft's store plays by it's own set of rules. It's shitty rules.

2049
01:53:22,500 --> 01:53:34,500
So, if I'm understanding this right, and maybe you're not, if I'm understanding this right, then we could do a, hypothetically, we could do an OLR skin pack, or a VOG network skin pack, or something, and sell it on the marketplace to make a little bit of money.

2050
01:53:34,500 --> 01:53:40,500
Potentially, yes, but I don't know what the details would be with setting that up.

2051
01:53:40,500 --> 01:53:42,500
But, maybe you could.

2052
01:53:42,500 --> 01:53:45,500
I think this may also include like, you know, structures.

2053
01:53:45,500 --> 01:53:48,500
I'm not saying we're going to do that, I'm just saying, hypothetically, could we?

2054
01:53:48,500 --> 01:53:50,500
So, maybe like structures, like maps and stuff like that.

2055
01:53:50,500 --> 01:53:51,500
Interesting.

2056
01:53:51,500 --> 01:53:53,500
But, yeah, it's something that they're offering.

2057
01:53:53,500 --> 01:54:00,500
And, of course, you know, they mentioned during the whole conference that Minecraft is coming to Nintendo Switch.

2058
01:54:00,500 --> 01:54:02,500
What exclusive features do you get on the Switch?

2059
01:54:02,500 --> 01:54:06,500
Jack shit. It's basically like the Wii U version of Minecraft.

2060
01:54:06,500 --> 01:54:11,500
But, hey, it looks nice. It's portable. I mean, they already have portable Minecraft, but it's portable.

2061
01:54:11,500 --> 01:54:16,500
Even the fact that this is portable and console, and it's all in one, that's a pretty big selling point for it.

2062
01:54:16,500 --> 01:54:22,500
And, some of us skipped it on Wii U, because we just kind of figured something like this might happen someday.

2063
01:54:22,500 --> 01:54:24,500
So, I skipped the Wii U version anyway.

2064
01:54:24,500 --> 01:54:26,500
I think it was just kind of like overpriced at the time.

2065
01:54:26,500 --> 01:54:28,500
It's really the same shit.

2066
01:54:28,500 --> 01:54:33,500
I already own, look, I own Minecraft on PS4, Xbox 360, PC.

2067
01:54:33,500 --> 01:54:36,500
So, it's like, yet again, here's one of those games I bought multiple times.

2068
01:54:36,500 --> 01:54:40,500
So, I wasn't really persuaded to buy a fourth time on the Wii U.

2069
01:54:40,500 --> 01:54:42,500
A fourth time on the Switch? Maybe.

2070
01:54:42,500 --> 01:54:47,500
I liked, again, the whole fact that I could pick this up, take it to a friend's house,

2071
01:54:47,500 --> 01:54:49,500
and we could play Minecraft together on the different Switches.

2072
01:54:49,500 --> 01:54:55,500
Like, that is more interesting to me than anything the other versions have done.

2073
01:54:55,500 --> 01:54:56,500
If that makes sense.

2074
01:54:56,500 --> 01:54:57,500
Yeah.

2075
01:54:57,500 --> 01:54:58,500
Alright.

2076
01:54:58,500 --> 01:55:00,500
Let's see. Moving on.

2077
01:55:00,500 --> 01:55:07,500
Speaking of Microsoft, something that is coming out for the Xbox One is a new version of Skype.

2078
01:55:07,500 --> 01:55:09,500
Skype was already on the Xbox One.

2079
01:55:09,500 --> 01:55:14,500
I remember when that system first came out, we got a couple phone calls to our own Skype line on the Xbox One.

2080
01:55:14,500 --> 01:55:17,500
I remember the camera used to follow you around, too, which is kind of cool.

2081
01:55:17,500 --> 01:55:19,500
The only thing the Kinect camera was good for.

2082
01:55:19,500 --> 01:55:22,500
It was a pretty cool feature to all said and done.

2083
01:55:22,500 --> 01:55:25,500
So, apparently, Kinect is going to have a new version of Skype.

2084
01:55:25,500 --> 01:55:27,500
And yes, they are still saying Kinect.

2085
01:55:27,500 --> 01:55:32,500
So, this is something new where, ooh, some usefulness out of Kinect that we haven't had for a year.

2086
01:55:32,500 --> 01:55:36,500
If you still have it because all those new systems don't sell it with Kinect and...

2087
01:55:36,500 --> 01:55:39,500
And you can't just hook up any old camera to this thing either.

2088
01:55:39,500 --> 01:55:44,500
I wish Microsoft would just break down that barrier and let you hook up any camera to it.

2089
01:55:44,500 --> 01:55:45,500
I mean, it would just be...

2090
01:55:45,500 --> 01:55:47,500
I even think I have a Microsoft camera.

2091
01:55:47,500 --> 01:55:48,500
It's just not a Kinect.

2092
01:55:48,500 --> 01:55:50,500
But I think my webcam is a Microsoft webcam.

2093
01:55:50,500 --> 01:55:52,500
Get over with Kinect. They're not using it anymore.

2094
01:55:52,500 --> 01:55:58,500
Anyway, the new edition is based on Universal Windows version that's on the other platforms.

2095
01:55:58,500 --> 01:56:00,500
But, of course, this is more for your living room.

2096
01:56:00,500 --> 01:56:03,500
So, there is snap picture and picture chatting now.

2097
01:56:03,500 --> 01:56:04,500
It's gone.

2098
01:56:04,500 --> 01:56:09,500
So, that is no longer there, but the whole thing has a new look, controller shortcuts,

2099
01:56:09,500 --> 01:56:14,500
manual zoom control to go with the automatic zoom, I guess, that follows you around and so forth.

2100
01:56:14,500 --> 01:56:19,500
So, yeah, you can check that out if you actually have an Xbox One with Kinect.

2101
01:56:19,500 --> 01:56:21,500
But, I mean, that'll be cool.

2102
01:56:21,500 --> 01:56:24,500
I liked it when we got phone calls for the show from Xbox One.

2103
01:56:24,500 --> 01:56:25,500
Yeah, that's cool.

2104
01:56:25,500 --> 01:56:26,500
It's always cool.

2105
01:56:26,500 --> 01:56:32,500
I mean, it's nice to see that extra functionality on systems, whether it's something I would use or not.

2106
01:56:33,500 --> 01:56:37,500
I don't know if this is going to prove itself to be super popular, but...

2107
01:56:37,500 --> 01:56:40,500
I don't think so with the limited amount of people that have Kinect.

2108
01:56:40,500 --> 01:56:42,500
Well, here's the interesting thing, okay?

2109
01:56:42,500 --> 01:56:46,500
The Xbox 360, remember when they put out the crappy little webcam for the 360?

2110
01:56:46,500 --> 01:56:48,500
Yeah, I remember that. I still have one.

2111
01:56:48,500 --> 01:56:51,500
Right. Well, you could do video calls on that.

2112
01:56:51,500 --> 01:56:55,500
That was before the Wii U. That was before the Xbox One.

2113
01:56:55,500 --> 01:56:59,500
On the Xbox 360 and that webcam thing, you could actually make a call to another Xbox 360.

2114
01:56:59,500 --> 01:57:04,500
And I remember, I think this was during a time when Shane was living in Kansas,

2115
01:57:04,500 --> 01:57:08,500
and I want to say we had a party at the house, and we had that.

2116
01:57:08,500 --> 01:57:12,500
And we called him so we could all say hi, even though he couldn't be there at the party,

2117
01:57:12,500 --> 01:57:16,500
but we could all, like, you know, kind of do the across long distance thing, which was neat.

2118
01:57:16,500 --> 01:57:19,500
That was like, ooh, the future, video calling, the Jetsons, that whole thing.

2119
01:57:19,500 --> 01:57:24,500
So, I mean, it's just interesting that that technology kind of, that's been around a while,

2120
01:57:24,500 --> 01:57:33,500
but I guess, you know, now they're just trying to unify it all under Skype is the same on Windows 10 versus a tablet versus Xbox One.

2121
01:57:33,500 --> 01:57:39,500
I mean, I get that they're pushing Skype as an alternative to actual calls and all that.

2122
01:57:39,500 --> 01:57:41,500
So, neat.

2123
01:57:41,500 --> 01:57:42,500
Yeah.

2124
01:57:42,500 --> 01:57:44,500
All right. Moving on. Loki.

2125
01:57:44,500 --> 01:57:50,500
So, this is kind of cool. They're working on creating a refund system for the Microsoft platform.

2126
01:57:50,500 --> 01:57:52,500
So, the Xbox One and Windows 10.

2127
01:57:52,500 --> 01:57:58,500
It sounds like that they're kind of building it similar to what they have on the Steam store.

2128
01:57:58,500 --> 01:58:11,500
So, it would basically be some sort of program where you'd be able to request a refund if you have under, like, so much time playing the game or whatever.

2129
01:58:11,500 --> 01:58:19,500
So, to request a refund, you'd go to your account on Microsoft.com, you'd sign in, and you'd select your payment and billing.

2130
01:58:19,500 --> 01:58:22,500
And then from there, you would collect a button that says request a refund.

2131
01:58:22,500 --> 01:58:29,500
And, of course, it said, you know, they're not available yet, but you'd be able to do that for, like, you know, DLC season.

2132
01:58:29,500 --> 01:58:33,500
Are they saying, like, some things like DLC season passes, game add-ons might not be eligible.

2133
01:58:33,500 --> 01:58:39,500
But games, they're saying that, you know, maybe depending on the amount of time that you played or something like that.

2134
01:58:39,500 --> 01:58:43,500
So, that's kind of neat, I guess, if you buy something you really don't like.

2135
01:58:43,500 --> 01:58:47,500
And they're saying less than two hours or if you've owned it for less than two weeks.

2136
01:58:47,500 --> 01:58:52,500
So, this is going to be controversial in the development community as it was on Steam.

2137
01:58:52,500 --> 01:58:58,500
Yeah, I think so, especially, like, when you're talking about games that just come out, like, that are just fucking broken.

2138
01:58:58,500 --> 01:59:02,500
And you know what? Good. I think it should be that way, because you know what?

2139
01:59:02,500 --> 01:59:09,500
If you release a product, you can't tell me that you, the developers of the game, don't know the, you know, the situation.

2140
01:59:09,500 --> 01:59:17,500
And let's not blame the developers themselves, the publishers. The publishers know what, you know, where the level of quality is on that product.

2141
01:59:17,500 --> 01:59:20,500
And they're just pushing it out because they're going to make a quick buck.

2142
01:59:20,500 --> 01:59:26,500
So, you know what? That's fine. I really think they should have more of these restrictions in place.

2143
01:59:26,500 --> 01:59:33,500
What are they going to do about the, and I'm using my quotey fingers, walking simulator games where some of them are only a less than two hour experience?

2144
01:59:33,500 --> 01:59:40,500
Things like Firewatch or, you know, maybe that was more like four hours, but still, you know, there's a lot gone home.

2145
01:59:40,500 --> 01:59:43,500
Fuck, you could be gone home in ten minutes if you know what you're doing.

2146
01:59:43,500 --> 01:59:45,500
You know, a lot of those games are shorter.

2147
01:59:45,500 --> 01:59:50,500
But I think for those, though, that's going to be a very unlikely scenario.

2148
01:59:50,500 --> 01:59:57,500
I mean, yeah, there may be issues where it's like that, but I don't think there's a lot of that content necessarily out on those platforms.

2149
01:59:57,500 --> 02:00:00,500
I mean, they've got, some of them, there are like...

2150
02:00:00,500 --> 02:00:07,500
Hopefully, the publishers can limit it if it, like, get a waiver or limit it somehow if it's justified.

2151
02:00:07,500 --> 02:00:13,500
You know what I mean? Like, if the game's length is short or the amount of the game is a certain amount or something,

2152
02:00:13,500 --> 02:00:18,500
then maybe the policy could be altered to be fifteen minutes before a refund or something. You know what I mean?

2153
02:00:18,500 --> 02:00:23,500
Like, I just, I would hate to see, because, you know, I like these kind of games.

2154
02:00:23,500 --> 02:00:27,500
And Dark Soccer, I know she's not here tonight, but I know what, because she was texting me all about it this week.

2155
02:00:27,500 --> 02:00:31,500
I know one game she got super into this week, she suddenly started Dear Esther on a whim,

2156
02:00:31,500 --> 02:00:36,500
which was the game that was before Everybody's Gone to the Rapture from that, what's the name of that company?

2157
02:00:36,500 --> 02:00:42,500
The Chinese Room, I think is the name of it, that that company made beforehand, and she was like super into it.

2158
02:00:42,500 --> 02:00:48,500
So, like, I really like those walking sims, and I hate that name, but that's what they call them.

2159
02:00:48,500 --> 02:00:53,500
But those types of games, I'm really into them, because they have such good fucking stories, usually.

2160
02:00:53,500 --> 02:01:00,500
And I like the fact that they're kind of quick, you know? It's like writing a movie, but you're the movie!

2161
02:01:00,500 --> 02:01:05,500
So, I just, I hope there's space for the short game in this.

2162
02:01:05,500 --> 02:01:10,500
I mean, couldn't you even beat a Telltale Episode 1 in a couple of hours?

2163
02:01:10,500 --> 02:01:14,500
I want to say Walking Dead Episode 1 did not take me that long.

2164
02:01:14,500 --> 02:01:17,500
You could beat those games pretty quickly, too.

2165
02:01:17,500 --> 02:01:18,500
We'll see.

2166
02:01:18,500 --> 02:01:23,500
Yeah, but they would depend on how they do this. A lot of those Walking the Telltale games, they release the first episode for free,

2167
02:01:23,500 --> 02:01:30,500
and then everything else you have to pay for, so they could say, oh, all the other levels are DLC, and that's restricted from it.

2168
02:01:30,500 --> 02:01:35,500
Oh, and I think that's actually how they do it. I think, like, King's Quest, that's exactly how they did it.

2169
02:01:35,500 --> 02:01:41,500
You had the base game, but then everything else is DLC that adds the, like, King's Quest Episode 2 and all the other stuff.

2170
02:01:41,500 --> 02:01:46,500
Hmm, okay. That might be a way they do it. Well, anyway, I just, look, don't get me wrong.

2171
02:01:46,500 --> 02:01:50,500
I think this policy at the end of the day is a good thing because of what you said.

2172
02:01:50,500 --> 02:01:57,500
It forces the publisher to put out a game that isn't going to be crappy right at their release date that they can, like, patch out later on.

2173
02:01:57,500 --> 02:02:02,500
But, I don't want to see it hurt the very creative, shorter games.

2174
02:02:02,500 --> 02:02:04,500
So, I just want to see a balance, that's all.

2175
02:02:04,500 --> 02:02:10,500
I just don't know if there's a lot of those, even, like, the walking sim games that they have in, on those platforms.

2176
02:02:10,500 --> 02:02:13,500
I want to say they're probably more than two hours in length.

2177
02:02:13,500 --> 02:02:18,500
So, you know, I would think that you would want, for your money, something a little bit longer than two hours.

2178
02:02:18,500 --> 02:02:23,500
I would be surprised if there's any games like that that are under two hours on that platform.

2179
02:02:23,500 --> 02:02:31,500
But, I mean, if you're really intent on just buying it and, you know, speed running through it,

2180
02:02:31,500 --> 02:02:33,500
I mean, that's kind of ridiculous to do that.

2181
02:02:33,500 --> 02:02:37,500
But, I just don't think that's going to be a very likely scenario that's going to happen all the time.

2182
02:02:37,500 --> 02:02:40,500
I mean, that takes a lot of forethought.

2183
02:02:40,500 --> 02:02:42,500
And, I mean, there's just a certain type of people that would do that.

2184
02:02:42,500 --> 02:02:46,500
I just, I don't think everyone's going to go do that.

2185
02:02:46,500 --> 02:02:51,500
I mean, I think the Steam thing is kind of accepted as the norm now.

2186
02:02:51,500 --> 02:02:56,500
So, you know, it'll hopefully work out alright on Xbox.

2187
02:02:56,500 --> 02:02:59,500
Again, I think at the end of the day it will be a good thing.

2188
02:02:59,500 --> 02:03:03,500
I just, you know, different games sometimes take different measurements with it, that's all.

2189
02:03:03,500 --> 02:03:04,500
Yeah.

2190
02:03:04,500 --> 02:03:06,500
Alright, well, let's move on and talk about…

2191
02:03:06,500 --> 02:03:08,500
Oh, and then of course, you know, to kind of add on to that,

2192
02:03:08,500 --> 02:03:12,500
Microsoft also said that they have the right to block users should they be found abusing the refund program.

2193
02:03:12,500 --> 02:03:13,500
Oh, okay.

2194
02:03:13,500 --> 02:03:19,500
So, if you do find people that are doing, burning through games in two hours and then, you know,

2195
02:03:19,500 --> 02:03:21,500
refunding them that they're going to block you.

2196
02:03:21,500 --> 02:03:22,500
Alright.

2197
02:03:22,500 --> 02:03:28,500
Well, let's talk about Germany for a little bit because there's some interesting legal maneuvers going on in Germany right now.

2198
02:03:28,500 --> 02:03:35,500
So, there's a German broadcast authority which I'm assuming would be similar to how we have the FCC here in the States.

2199
02:03:35,500 --> 02:03:38,500
Should I embarrass myself trying to pronounce this?

2200
02:03:38,500 --> 02:03:42,500
Landesmedienstalt is the name.

2201
02:03:42,500 --> 02:03:44,500
I totally butchered that, I'm sorry.

2202
02:03:44,500 --> 02:03:49,500
Sorry to any Germans or people that speak German listening to this show, but I butchered Japanese, bad enough.

2203
02:03:49,500 --> 02:03:51,500
So, now I butcher German.

2204
02:03:51,500 --> 02:03:56,500
Anyway, apparently this broadcast authority in Germany has said that YouTubers and Twitch streamers

2205
02:03:56,500 --> 02:04:02,500
need to get a broadcasting license because they're considered broadcast by the law.

2206
02:04:02,500 --> 02:04:05,500
This is coming from a YouTuber, Pete Smit.

2207
02:04:05,500 --> 02:04:07,500
I don't know if I'm saying that right, sorry.

2208
02:04:07,500 --> 02:04:13,500
He did a little video, it is in German, but he had to apply for a license by April 30th if he wants to keep uploading videos.

2209
02:04:13,500 --> 02:04:21,500
Now, broadcast licenses can cost between 1,000 and 10,000 euros depending on the size of the audience as well as, you know, other things.

2210
02:04:22,500 --> 02:04:30,500
I guess officials are aware that the rules are outdated, but they do, I guess, encompass broadcasts, but they were designed for TV and radio.

2211
02:04:30,500 --> 02:04:39,500
So, it sounds like most things when it comes to, you know, broadcast, when it comes to, we talked about patents before and some of that.

2212
02:04:39,500 --> 02:04:44,500
Some of this shit needs to be badly updated for how fast our technology is taking off.

2213
02:04:44,500 --> 02:04:49,500
You know, we have that problem when it comes to the patents and all that stuff in the States as well.

2214
02:04:49,500 --> 02:04:55,500
But anyway, so apparently he's gonna have to apply for this. I just...

2215
02:04:55,500 --> 02:04:58,500
I don't think, why would he just be maybe going after this guy?

2216
02:04:58,500 --> 02:05:05,500
But YouTube isn't based in Germany. YouTube is based in San Francisco.

2217
02:05:05,500 --> 02:05:09,500
Are they saying broadcast and the fact that he's like doing live streams or something like that?

2218
02:05:09,500 --> 02:05:12,500
Because that would be the only thing I see is broadcast, I mean, but...

2219
02:05:12,500 --> 02:05:17,500
Well, I think the reality is this guy is probably a PewDiePie-ish figure in Germany.

2220
02:05:17,500 --> 02:05:21,500
He's probably making a lot of money off his videos and the government wants money.

2221
02:05:21,500 --> 02:05:24,500
But wouldn't they be able to tax his income?

2222
02:05:24,500 --> 02:05:27,500
Like, because if that's what would happen here in the States, if I made a million...

2223
02:05:27,500 --> 02:05:28,500
That just seems really stupid.

2224
02:05:28,500 --> 02:05:39,500
If I made a million dollars off YouTube videos, although I gotta say, Bobby's Tesla thing that he put on the VOG Network channel, still getting tons of views.

2225
02:05:39,500 --> 02:05:44,500
So, I mean, we might actually get a check from YouTube thanks to that video.

2226
02:05:44,500 --> 02:05:52,500
I mean, it won't be a lot, but it's enough to like pay for the stream for three months instead of me having to pay for it or pay for the website instead of Bobby having to pay for it.

2227
02:05:52,500 --> 02:05:54,500
But anyway, I digress.

2228
02:05:54,500 --> 02:06:04,500
So assuming, you know, if we were to make over 400 or something like that dollars, I don't know what the threshold is, we'd have to claim that as income.

2229
02:06:04,500 --> 02:06:07,500
And so then there'd be an income tax on that. So the government would make their money there.

2230
02:06:07,500 --> 02:06:08,500
Yeah.

2231
02:06:08,500 --> 02:06:14,500
So does Germany not have an income tax? I have to plead ignorance here. I don't know enough about it.

2232
02:06:14,500 --> 02:06:20,500
Or is that not enough? Germany wants this money too. I don't know.

2233
02:06:20,500 --> 02:06:30,500
Anyway, TV stations with licenses in Germany also have to go by other guidelines, such as adult content, which has swearing and violence, because we all know they show titties in Germany.

2234
02:06:30,500 --> 02:06:32,500
So that is one thing that they have up on us.

2235
02:06:32,500 --> 02:06:33,500
Praise Germany.

2236
02:06:33,500 --> 02:06:37,500
They will show titties on the telly, but only after 10 o'clock.

2237
02:06:37,500 --> 02:06:40,500
But how are you going to police the whole damn internet, Germany?

2238
02:06:40,500 --> 02:07:00,500
I just, I think instead of going after this guy, they should probably stick to the whole, we know the laws are outdated, and maybe look at it from a perspective of, okay, if you want to tax this guy who's making money, then look into it in that regard, like what we would have to do here with an income tax.

2239
02:07:00,500 --> 02:07:07,500
Again, as I said, we are lucky and throwing confetti if we ever get a check from YouTube for one of our videos.

2240
02:07:07,500 --> 02:07:10,500
So this is not something I know a lot about, to be honest.

2241
02:07:10,500 --> 02:07:17,500
So I'd be very curious if we do have any overseas listeners, any perspective you guys might have from your own company on this.

2242
02:07:17,500 --> 02:07:23,500
I'm not seeing our chat room light up on this particular topic, but I don't know of any Germans that regularly listen to this show.

2243
02:07:23,500 --> 02:07:25,500
So we'll see.

2244
02:07:25,500 --> 02:07:28,500
Let's see, go into chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

2245
02:07:29,500 --> 02:07:32,500
Dungeon Buster says, it should be enough for hamburgers.

2246
02:07:32,500 --> 02:07:34,500
Tesla hamburgers for everyone.

2247
02:07:34,500 --> 02:07:40,500
Yes, the Tesla video might have made enough money to buy a pre-Dragon Con dinner.

2248
02:07:40,500 --> 02:07:42,500
Bobby and I have a tradition of a pre-Dragon Con dinner.

2249
02:07:42,500 --> 02:07:45,500
Perhaps this can fund the Dragon Con dinner this year.

2250
02:07:45,500 --> 02:07:48,500
Thank you guys for your views on that.

2251
02:07:49,500 --> 02:07:53,500
All right, anyway, moving on.

2252
02:07:53,500 --> 02:07:58,500
Oh, by the way, and if you're not subscribed to the YouTube VOG Network channel, go do it.

2253
02:07:58,500 --> 02:08:00,500
It's VOG Network over on YouTube.

2254
02:08:00,500 --> 02:08:07,500
It's not just the Tesla stuff, although Bobby did a great job with that, but you can actually see Shane from Ranger Pride.

2255
02:08:07,500 --> 02:08:13,500
I never get him on camera, and we're actually reviewing the Mass Effect ride over at California Great America.

2256
02:08:14,500 --> 02:08:19,500
Maybe there'll be some more projects in the future. I don't know, podcasting takes a lot of time as it is.

2257
02:08:19,500 --> 02:08:22,500
All right, but that's VOG Network over on YouTube.

2258
02:08:22,500 --> 02:08:28,500
Moving on, Loki, one more story here before we get to the calls at Orange Laundry Day on Skype.

2259
02:08:28,500 --> 02:08:36,500
So there's a brand new mod that they've done for Sonic the Hedgehog 2, and this you get to play Yoshi.

2260
02:08:36,500 --> 02:08:39,500
So Yoshi in Sonic the Hedgehog 2.

2261
02:08:39,500 --> 02:08:50,500
They're saying that Yoshi has all of kind of Yoshi's abilities, except now instead of Baby Mario, it's Baby Sonic riding on his back.

2262
02:08:50,500 --> 02:08:55,500
And you can actually eat the enemies and turn them into eggs and all that fun stuff.

2263
02:08:55,500 --> 02:08:56,500
So it's pretty awesome.

2264
02:08:56,500 --> 02:09:02,500
And they even have a little title screen and all that fun stuff.

2265
02:09:03,500 --> 02:09:05,500
So this is just a ROM hack?

2266
02:09:05,500 --> 02:09:06,500
Yeah.

2267
02:09:07,500 --> 02:09:09,500
That does look pretty good.

2268
02:09:11,500 --> 02:09:14,500
Is this one of those things that you can download on Steam?

2269
02:09:14,500 --> 02:09:15,500
Because you know how...

2270
02:09:15,500 --> 02:09:20,500
Yeah, I remember that. I don't know. I don't know if you can download it on Steam or not.

2271
02:09:23,500 --> 02:09:25,500
But yeah, I don't know. We'll check it out.

2272
02:09:25,500 --> 02:09:33,500
I think the guy who made it, Shiryu, he is like a Patreon that I think he releases his stuff on.

2273
02:09:33,500 --> 02:09:34,500
Interesting.

2274
02:09:35,500 --> 02:09:36,500
Looks pretty cool.

2275
02:09:36,500 --> 02:09:38,500
I think we must be missing out not being on that Patreon thing.

2276
02:09:38,500 --> 02:09:41,500
People will give you money for doing stuff on a regular basis?

2277
02:09:41,500 --> 02:09:42,500
Yeah, apparently.

2278
02:09:42,500 --> 02:09:43,500
We didn't get the memo on that.

2279
02:09:43,500 --> 02:09:44,500
Alright, anyway.

2280
02:09:45,500 --> 02:09:48,500
People will be giving money for this if they want to check this out.

2281
02:09:48,500 --> 02:09:58,500
ESL, which is an eSports league network, is going to be bringing its live competitive gaming channel called eSports TV to the PlayStation Vue.

2282
02:09:58,500 --> 02:10:03,500
Now PlayStation Vue is the cable-ish system that is built into the PlayStation.

2283
02:10:03,500 --> 02:10:12,500
So ESL's new channel is going to broaden competitive gaming's appeal by giving gamers access to 24-7 eSports content in the US.

2284
02:10:12,500 --> 02:10:15,500
It's already a thing in Europe. It launched in Europe last May.

2285
02:10:15,500 --> 02:10:20,500
Apparently 5 million households in the Europe territories have this, so that's pretty cool.

2286
02:10:20,500 --> 02:10:27,500
However, if you want to get this on PlayStation Vue in the States, you have to have a PlayStation Vue Elite subscription.

2287
02:10:27,500 --> 02:10:29,500
That's $54.99 a month.

2288
02:10:29,500 --> 02:10:30,500
So...

2289
02:10:30,500 --> 02:10:32,500
Fuck that.

2290
02:10:32,500 --> 02:10:36,500
Now, keep in mind, that doesn't mean you're paying all that much for one channel.

2291
02:10:36,500 --> 02:10:37,500
No.

2292
02:10:37,500 --> 02:10:39,500
It just means it's part of that extended package.

2293
02:10:39,500 --> 02:10:40,500
So fuck that.

2294
02:10:40,500 --> 02:10:43,500
Yeah, I don't know, guys. That's a lot of money.

2295
02:10:43,500 --> 02:10:51,500
But, you know, it's still kind of neat that eSports is kind of weaving its way into the traditional model.

2296
02:10:51,500 --> 02:10:57,500
But at the same time, we just had a conversation about how the traditional model for TV and all this stuff is completely changing.

2297
02:10:57,500 --> 02:11:04,500
So I really think, you know, and I'm sure these guys already have a huge presence on Twitch and YouTube and all that stuff,

2298
02:11:04,500 --> 02:11:06,500
but I feel like these guys are going to get even more.

2299
02:11:06,500 --> 02:11:13,500
I mean, 5 million, you know, households in Europe is cool, but I bet they have way more viewers online.

2300
02:11:13,500 --> 02:11:14,500
They do.

2301
02:11:14,500 --> 02:11:15,500
Yeah.

2302
02:11:15,500 --> 02:11:26,500
But anyway, I guess there's some weird validation that eSports gets by being in some of the same places that football and basketball and all that is.

2303
02:11:26,500 --> 02:11:30,500
Don't get me wrong. I was a PlayStation View subscriber for a while. The problem...

2304
02:11:30,500 --> 02:11:31,500
I didn't know that.

2305
02:11:31,500 --> 02:11:37,500
The problem is, though, they dropped some of their major channels. They lost the rights to them.

2306
02:11:37,500 --> 02:11:39,500
So, like, I didn't want to say, like, Comedy Central was one of those.

2307
02:11:39,500 --> 02:11:42,500
And that's really all I watched on there. I'm like, fuck that.

2308
02:11:42,500 --> 02:11:48,500
I'm leaving because this is the one channel that I watched on PlayStation View and now it's gone.

2309
02:11:48,500 --> 02:11:51,500
I'm not sticking around for the nonsense you have on here.

2310
02:11:51,500 --> 02:11:52,500
Yeah.

2311
02:11:52,500 --> 02:11:53,500
So, I mean...

2312
02:11:53,500 --> 02:11:57,500
As long as they have the H1 so I can watch Drag Race. It's the only thing I watch anymore.

2313
02:11:57,500 --> 02:12:00,500
It was all right. It's just, there's other options out there now.

2314
02:12:00,500 --> 02:12:07,500
I mean, what, YouTube has their YouTube TV coming out and they've got, you know, one of the other ones.

2315
02:12:07,500 --> 02:12:11,500
I know PlayStation View. There's the whole...

2316
02:12:11,500 --> 02:12:13,500
God, I can't remember the other one.

2317
02:12:13,500 --> 02:12:15,500
The other one through...

2318
02:12:15,500 --> 02:12:18,500
Not Sling.

2319
02:12:18,500 --> 02:12:22,500
It was through Dish. I don't remember. Maybe it was Sling. I don't remember.

2320
02:12:23,500 --> 02:12:27,500
They've got different, they have tons of different ways you can watch, or just even through your cable company.

2321
02:12:27,500 --> 02:12:29,500
William Murderface in chat confirms it's Sling.

2322
02:12:29,500 --> 02:12:30,500
Yeah.

2323
02:12:30,500 --> 02:12:37,500
So, I mean, I've got 50 bucks towards Sling because I bought that stupid, you know, Android TV thing, which is fantastic.

2324
02:12:37,500 --> 02:12:43,500
I love that thing, but I haven't really bothered to go on to Sling yet, but that might be something I'd do.

2325
02:12:43,500 --> 02:12:47,500
But yeah, I'm not going to, like, I wouldn't subscribe to the higher tier one because honestly,

2326
02:12:47,500 --> 02:12:51,500
I was looking at what they had, you know, versus the basic tier and the higher tier in View.

2327
02:12:51,500 --> 02:12:55,500
It's really not worth it. And this definitely wouldn't sweeten the pot.

2328
02:12:55,500 --> 02:12:59,500
We're going to go ahead and open up the Skype line over at Orange Lounge Radio.

2329
02:12:59,500 --> 02:13:02,500
All one word on Skype. If you want to give us a call about anything we've talked about tonight,

2330
02:13:02,500 --> 02:13:05,500
or maybe something we haven't talked about tonight, you can give us a call.

2331
02:13:05,500 --> 02:13:08,500
Orange Lounge Radio, again, all one word on Skype.

2332
02:13:08,500 --> 02:13:12,500
Wyland in chat points out, I think CW has H1Z1 coming up.

2333
02:13:12,500 --> 02:13:15,500
Yeah, I remember a story on this show about the CW.

2334
02:13:15,500 --> 02:13:16,500
Yeah.

2335
02:13:16,500 --> 02:13:20,500
Home of all those DC shows, and they don't even have Top Model anymore.

2336
02:13:20,500 --> 02:13:25,500
What else does CW have besides all the DC comics and Riverdale?

2337
02:13:25,500 --> 02:13:29,500
There's not a lot there, right? So, I mean, I guess they have to fill the programming time with something.

2338
02:13:29,500 --> 02:13:32,500
Oh, they have, that's where Whose Line Is It Anyway is still.

2339
02:13:32,500 --> 02:13:33,500
Oh, cool.

2340
02:13:33,500 --> 02:13:35,500
They do have that. They do have that, right? That's still going, right?

2341
02:13:35,500 --> 02:13:40,500
Ayesha Tyler just does it now, right? So, I think that's all on CW, so.

2342
02:13:40,500 --> 02:13:45,500
JD points out CW has Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, and that show is amazing.

2343
02:13:45,500 --> 02:13:52,500
That show, we watched it on Netflix, that show is fucking hilarious. Like, it's a brilliant show.

2344
02:13:52,500 --> 02:13:57,500
Everybody's telling me I need to watch 13 Reasons Why on Netflix, but apparently it's super fucking depressing.

2345
02:13:57,500 --> 02:14:03,500
I would watch Crazy Ex-Girlfriend. They break out in the musical numbers in every episode, and it's hilarious.

2346
02:14:03,500 --> 02:14:09,500
I mean, it's actually very well written. It's a show that my wife watches in, but it is very entertaining.

2347
02:14:09,500 --> 02:14:11,500
The comedy writing is just really good in it.

2348
02:14:11,500 --> 02:14:15,500
Alright, we'll dish on Netflix and TV for a bit, but if you want to steer us back to video games,

2349
02:14:15,500 --> 02:14:17,500
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

2350
02:14:17,500 --> 02:14:21,500
I started watching a show, you guys are going to tease me, but I don't give a fuck.

2351
02:14:21,500 --> 02:14:27,500
I got turned onto this because they never shut up about it on the RuPaul podcast that he does with Michelle Visage,

2352
02:14:27,500 --> 02:14:32,500
and it's a show called Schitt's Creek, which I guess is big in Canada, but they...

2353
02:14:32,500 --> 02:14:34,500
Yeah, we watched that too, yeah.

2354
02:14:34,500 --> 02:14:39,500
They show it on TV Guide Channel here, I think, but it's more of, well, it's Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara,

2355
02:14:39,500 --> 02:14:41,500
so it's the SCTV people, right?

2356
02:14:41,500 --> 02:14:42,500
It's pretty funny, actually.

2357
02:14:42,500 --> 02:14:44,500
Yeah, that show was fucking funny!

2358
02:14:44,500 --> 02:14:47,500
Yeah, so that was something I got into on Netflix recently.

2359
02:14:47,500 --> 02:14:50,500
I forget the premise, I mean, I sort of remember the premise, it's like something happens...

2360
02:14:50,500 --> 02:14:57,500
It's the richest to rags show that's been done a million times before, but it's being done with Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara.

2361
02:14:57,500 --> 02:15:04,500
Yeah, apparently they were super rich, and as a joke, they bought a town, and it was Schitt's Creek, I guess,

2362
02:15:04,500 --> 02:15:11,500
and so they just, as a joke, they ended up having to move there because they lost their money from some sort of tax thing.

2363
02:15:11,500 --> 02:15:19,500
Yes, that is the premise of the show, but again, it's funny because Catherine O'Hara, she's so fucking funny in everything I see her in,

2364
02:15:19,500 --> 02:15:26,500
and it's also, you know what, it's not just SCTV, but those guys are always in the Christopher Guest movies,

2365
02:15:26,500 --> 02:15:31,500
like Waiting for Guffman, what was the one about the dog show? Best in Show?

2366
02:15:31,500 --> 02:15:32,500
Best in Show, yeah.

2367
02:15:33,500 --> 02:15:38,500
His movies go back to Spinal Tap, but I don't think these other guys started showing up until later on,

2368
02:15:38,500 --> 02:15:45,500
and again, those movies are really, really fucking funny. I think there's actually a new one on Netflix I never watched.

2369
02:15:45,500 --> 02:15:51,500
There's one called Mascots or something, it's about like football mascots or something that's out there.

2370
02:15:51,500 --> 02:15:54,500
I think I need to watch that still, but that stuff is all really funny.

2371
02:15:55,500 --> 02:15:58,500
Looking at some TV recommendations and chat.

2372
02:15:58,500 --> 02:16:03,500
All right, sure, you guys want to talk TV? Why not? Nobody's calling in tonight. I guess it is a holiday.

2373
02:16:03,500 --> 02:16:08,500
William Ritterface in chat says, The Magicians is great. I saw that, I saw that in the list.

2374
02:16:09,500 --> 02:16:16,500
Come on, Noel Gus says, Oh, you should watch Class on BBC America. It's a young adult spinoff of Doctor Who,

2375
02:16:16,500 --> 02:16:22,500
but it has a really well done gay couple arc. I already binged the series online because it already aired in the UK.

2376
02:16:22,500 --> 02:16:25,500
That's cool. Doctor Who isn't on Netflix anymore, did you know that?

2377
02:16:25,500 --> 02:16:26,500
No, I didn't necessarily.

2378
02:16:26,500 --> 02:16:31,500
I didn't realize they took that off. Netflix is always getting rid of shit that I want to see,

2379
02:16:31,500 --> 02:16:37,500
but then random shit that I was like, Oh, I didn't know this was on Netflix shows up like Finding Dory.

2380
02:16:37,500 --> 02:16:40,500
I was like Gremlins. Gremlins, yeah, showed up.

2381
02:16:40,500 --> 02:16:41,500
Yeah, Finding Dory.

2382
02:16:41,500 --> 02:16:43,500
Star Trek's back. All the Star Trek's are back.

2383
02:16:43,500 --> 02:16:49,500
They get all the new Disney stuff, so like you'll see all the new Disney movies, like Moana will probably be on there pretty soon.

2384
02:16:49,500 --> 02:16:50,500
That's good.

2385
02:16:51,500 --> 02:16:56,500
Well, I'm sure they'll be the next thing that my kids binge, but like, yeah, they have all sorts of weird stuff,

2386
02:16:56,500 --> 02:17:01,500
but then like sometimes something they have doesn't make any sense, like Kung Fu Panda and Kung Fu Panda 3.

2387
02:17:01,500 --> 02:17:07,500
It's like, where's Kung Fu Panda 2? Sorry, there's no Kung Fu Panda 2 for you, but you can get one or three.

2388
02:17:07,500 --> 02:17:11,500
It's like two doesn't exist. It's like, I want to watch two.

2389
02:17:12,500 --> 02:17:15,500
Was that, was that where I started binge watching?

2390
02:17:15,500 --> 02:17:20,500
Because I'm looking in chat over Act F says Rob Roberts blamed BBC for that.

2391
02:17:20,500 --> 02:17:26,500
Was Netflix where I started binge watching the Crystal Maze or was that just a YouTube?

2392
02:17:26,500 --> 02:17:30,500
Maybe that was a YouTube hole I fell down, not maybe it was a crystal maze.

2393
02:17:30,500 --> 02:17:31,500
Okay, it was like this game show.

2394
02:17:31,500 --> 02:17:35,500
So our listeners overseas are going to fucking know what I'm talking about, but it was never here.

2395
02:17:35,500 --> 02:17:37,500
But what can I compare it to?

2396
02:17:37,500 --> 02:17:42,500
Like, okay, it was like a, it was like kind of, I think it was like a kids-ish game show that would,

2397
02:17:42,500 --> 02:17:44,500
I don't think it was just our kids, I think it was like 20-somethings.

2398
02:17:44,500 --> 02:17:51,500
But it's like they actually went through this, like the studio was set up as like an actual maze

2399
02:17:51,500 --> 02:17:55,500
where like some of it would be a jungle and they would have to solve puzzles in all these rooms

2400
02:17:55,500 --> 02:17:59,500
and the puzzles that they solve gives them time in the chamber at the end

2401
02:17:59,500 --> 02:18:02,500
where they have to grab as many gold tickets as they can.

2402
02:18:02,500 --> 02:18:06,500
And like, so it's like akin to, I'm trying to think, maybe like Legends of the Hidden Temple or something

2403
02:18:06,500 --> 02:18:08,500
I thought we did have that show here.

2404
02:18:08,500 --> 02:18:10,500
No, we didn't. We didn't.

2405
02:18:10,500 --> 02:18:15,500
And it was hosted by Richard O'Brien, which was like the other thing he did besides Rock Your Picture Show

2406
02:18:15,500 --> 02:18:17,500
was he was the host of that show.

2407
02:18:17,500 --> 02:18:23,500
And so I don't know how the fuck I felt, no, one of my friends that lives over in Britain

2408
02:18:23,500 --> 02:18:25,500
is obsessed with it and told me to watch it one night.

2409
02:18:25,500 --> 02:18:30,500
And so I did, I thought I found it on Netflix, maybe it was YouTube, and I just found out it well

2410
02:18:30,500 --> 02:18:34,500
and I started watching these episodes and I was like, I would have been obsessed with this fucking show

2411
02:18:34,500 --> 02:18:36,500
if it was around when I was a kid, but we didn't have it here.

2412
02:18:36,500 --> 02:18:40,500
I mean, but we had like, I think, yeah, like Legends of the Hidden Temple is probably the closest thing we had to it.

2413
02:18:40,500 --> 02:18:42,500
And Fun House.

2414
02:18:42,500 --> 02:18:45,500
Maybe Fun House, but like, Fun House was that super sloppy shit.

2415
02:18:45,500 --> 02:18:48,500
And that wasn't like, Crystal Maze wasn't really that.

2416
02:18:48,500 --> 02:18:54,500
So, that's not dignified. This is a British television show, lowkey.

2417
02:18:54,500 --> 02:18:57,500
Anyway, let's see, going to our chat over it.

2418
02:18:57,500 --> 02:19:01,500
Oh, the other one I watched too, Samurai Gourmet, have you seen that one?

2419
02:19:01,500 --> 02:19:07,500
I think that's what it's called. It's like, it's a Japanese show about this guy who retired, he's like, retired.

2420
02:19:07,500 --> 02:19:15,500
And he goes around eating food at these different Japanese locations and fantasizing about his life if he was a samurai and stuff.

2421
02:19:15,500 --> 02:19:20,500
It's kind of, it's interesting, it's different, but very relaxing.

2422
02:19:20,500 --> 02:19:23,500
Rama in chat says, Samurai Gourmet is so good.

2423
02:19:23,500 --> 02:19:27,500
Tigerclaw in chat says, Legends of the Hidden Temple was made into a movie for Nickelodeon.

2424
02:19:27,500 --> 02:19:29,500
Yeah, I heard about that.

2425
02:19:30,500 --> 02:19:34,500
Didn't they do another one of their 90's shows as a movie, too?

2426
02:19:34,500 --> 02:19:35,500
Like, I feel like...

2427
02:19:35,500 --> 02:19:38,500
Yeah, they did. Well, they have the whole Invader Zim.

2428
02:19:38,500 --> 02:19:40,500
Are you Afraid of the Dark? Is that the one that they did?

2429
02:19:40,500 --> 02:19:45,500
They did a movie for that a long time ago, but Invader Zim, they just announced that they're bringing that back as a movie.

2430
02:19:45,500 --> 02:19:48,500
Which I'm like, God dammit, why can't it be a series?

2431
02:19:48,500 --> 02:19:52,500
But John and Vasquez is on there, so I'm like, fuck yes, I'm down.

2432
02:19:53,500 --> 02:19:56,500
And then they did the whole, what was it?

2433
02:19:56,500 --> 02:19:59,500
Rocko's Modern Life, I think, had a movie that they did.

2434
02:19:59,500 --> 02:20:01,500
When's Doug the movie?

2435
02:20:01,500 --> 02:20:06,500
Probably not too far away. I mean, I don't know.

2436
02:20:06,500 --> 02:20:09,500
I just have to say this, since we're talking about old shows.

2437
02:20:09,500 --> 02:20:12,500
This is my last call for phone calls. If nobody calls in, then nobody calls in.

2438
02:20:12,500 --> 02:20:14,500
Orange Lounge Radio, all onward on Skype.

2439
02:20:14,500 --> 02:20:20,500
I was going to say with the TV shows, we're like only two weeks away from Twin Peaks Season 3.

2440
02:20:20,500 --> 02:20:23,500
And like, oh my God, it's finally here.

2441
02:20:23,500 --> 02:20:30,500
Like after all this waiting, 25 plus years later, Twin Peaks Season 3 is coming.

2442
02:20:30,500 --> 02:20:35,500
I don't think they're calling it that, they're just calling it Twin Peaks or whatever, but it's Twin Peaks Season 3.

2443
02:20:35,500 --> 02:20:38,500
I'm so fucking pumped for that.

2444
02:20:38,500 --> 02:20:41,500
I don't even have showtime though, so I guess I'll have to...

2445
02:20:41,500 --> 02:20:44,500
Isn't it like a bonus option on Hulu or something?

2446
02:20:44,500 --> 02:20:46,500
I'm going to have to figure out how I'm going to watch that online.

2447
02:20:46,500 --> 02:20:48,500
So, anyway.

2448
02:20:48,500 --> 02:20:51,500
Loki, any last minute stories with video games?

2449
02:20:51,500 --> 02:20:54,500
Yeah, so there's a couple things.

2450
02:20:54,500 --> 02:21:00,500
First off, I know we don't really give a shit, but Konami is doing another patiche slot for Castlevania.

2451
02:21:00,500 --> 02:21:07,500
So, let me give a shout out real quick to our buddies over at GameBui.org,

2452
02:21:07,500 --> 02:21:12,500
because they just did a live show yesterday in celebration of I think five years of doing their show.

2453
02:21:12,500 --> 02:21:14,500
Yeah, believe it or not.

2454
02:21:14,500 --> 02:21:16,500
Makes me feel old.

2455
02:21:16,500 --> 02:21:18,500
But yeah, they did a live show yesterday.

2456
02:21:18,500 --> 02:21:23,500
But I listened to their last broadcast show where Spike was talking about his trip that he took to Japan.

2457
02:21:23,500 --> 02:21:25,500
And if you guys haven't heard it, it's definitely worth checking out.

2458
02:21:25,500 --> 02:21:27,500
Again, it's over at GameBui.org.

2459
02:21:27,500 --> 02:21:30,500
And Spike was talking about his trip to Japan, and he was talking about how,

2460
02:21:30,500 --> 02:21:34,500
as much as we kind of laugh about the pachiko slot thing here,

2461
02:21:34,500 --> 02:21:40,500
in Japan, you see those things a lot more places.

2462
02:21:40,500 --> 02:21:45,500
So the fact that a company kind of pours its resources into that makes a lot more sense.

2463
02:21:45,500 --> 02:21:48,500
We laugh at it, because here it's a fucking novelty.

2464
02:21:48,500 --> 02:21:51,500
You don't even really see legit pachinko machines anywhere here.

2465
02:21:51,500 --> 02:21:55,500
It's just, you know, maybe you'll see something inspired by it, Dave and Busters.

2466
02:21:55,500 --> 02:21:59,500
But anyway, we do have a phone call coming in here at the last minute.

2467
02:21:59,500 --> 02:22:01,500
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

2468
02:22:01,500 --> 02:22:02,500
Hey, this is Akdeaf.

2469
02:22:02,500 --> 02:22:05,500
Hey, Akdeaf. Wait until the last minute. That's all right. What's on your mind, buddy?

2470
02:22:05,500 --> 02:22:09,500
Yeah, sorry, I got kind of distracted by what you were talking about, but yeah.

2471
02:22:09,500 --> 02:22:11,500
Fair enough.

2472
02:22:11,500 --> 02:22:16,500
Well, anyways, Kirby's 25th anniversary.

2473
02:22:16,500 --> 02:22:19,500
Oh, that's right! That was all part of the Nintendo Direct!

2474
02:22:19,500 --> 02:22:23,500
How could we forget to shout that out, Akdeaf? I'm glad you're here to remind us.

2475
02:22:23,500 --> 02:22:25,500
What were your thoughts on all that?

2476
02:22:25,500 --> 02:22:32,500
Well, it's pretty amazing. At least from what we saw in the Direct,

2477
02:22:32,500 --> 02:22:38,500
we were getting three games, three Kirby games this year, so that's pretty awesome.

2478
02:22:38,500 --> 02:22:43,500
I'm still kind of surprised, though, that they're making so many big games for the 3DS.

2479
02:22:43,500 --> 02:22:46,500
I really thought that system was going to be on its way out the door,

2480
02:22:46,500 --> 02:22:50,500
but I guess maybe I was trying to eulogize it too fast.

2481
02:22:50,500 --> 02:22:53,500
It seems like there's still at least another year's worth of games coming out on the 3DS.

2482
02:22:53,500 --> 02:22:58,500
I mean, not just the cold-step thing, but that's just localizing a game that came out like a year ago in Japan.

2483
02:22:58,500 --> 02:23:02,500
But, you know, obviously this Kirby thing, one of those that I know they were showing was on the 3DS.

2484
02:23:02,500 --> 02:23:08,500
The 2D Pikmin game or whatever they were showing to us, it seems like there's still some pretty big titles over there on 3DS.

2485
02:23:08,500 --> 02:23:10,500
But, yay, Kirby!

2486
02:23:10,500 --> 02:23:20,500
Yeah, I was actually surprised that Kirby wasn't getting a Switch game and is getting a new multiplayer game on the 3DS.

2487
02:23:20,500 --> 02:23:27,500
Well, wait. You know, Kirby's probably focusing on 3DS for now because Mario's going to get the push this holiday.

2488
02:23:27,500 --> 02:23:31,500
But don't rule anything out for next year or the year after.

2489
02:23:31,500 --> 02:23:37,500
Yeah, most probably we'll see a Kirby Switch game sooner rather than later.

2490
02:23:37,500 --> 02:23:46,500
But, yeah, like you were saying, the 3DS is getting a lot of games and it's really surprising that it's still getting a lot of love.

2491
02:23:46,500 --> 02:23:49,500
Not only from Nintendo, but from other companies too.

2492
02:23:49,500 --> 02:23:55,500
In some ways it's almost a little frustrating because I kind of just want them all to move to Switch.

2493
02:23:55,500 --> 02:24:04,500
But, look, the guys that were here earlier talked about for their game that they were making, the Little Tanks game, that it took them two years to do that.

2494
02:24:04,500 --> 02:24:08,500
And that's pretty custom for any game that's out there being developed.

2495
02:24:08,500 --> 02:24:10,500
Shit, some of them take up to five years to develop.

2496
02:24:10,500 --> 02:24:20,500
Realistically, sometimes you start developing a game on 3DS and it's like, we're still going to release on this platform because we've been developing for it.

2497
02:24:20,500 --> 02:24:23,500
We didn't know the Switch was going to take off as fast as it did. This was our target.

2498
02:24:23,500 --> 02:24:32,500
I actually felt bad because one of the guys that was doing a talk at the Sac Indie Arcade that we were doing on Saturday, last Saturday, he just had his game release on Wii U.

2499
02:24:32,500 --> 02:24:39,500
And I couldn't help but think, oh, but are people still checking their Wii Us and all that stuff?

2500
02:24:39,500 --> 02:24:42,500
I would want to talk to that guy more about that.

2501
02:24:42,500 --> 02:24:50,500
But I'm sure, in his mind, when they started developing that game, they didn't know that the Wii U was going to fucking just croak once the Switch came out.

2502
02:24:50,500 --> 02:24:56,500
Even Nintendo just croaked because there's still a lot of people that own Wii Us that probably aren't jumping on board.

2503
02:24:56,500 --> 02:25:03,500
But here's the thing. Here's the telltale sign for me. Nintendo didn't say a goddamn thing in that direct about Wii U.

2504
02:25:03,500 --> 02:25:09,500
And I didn't expect them to. But they were still talking about 3DS. They didn't say a goddamn thing about Wii U.

2505
02:25:09,500 --> 02:25:13,500
So Wii U is as good as gone, as far as Nintendo's concerned.

2506
02:25:13,500 --> 02:25:17,500
Zelda was the swung song. That's it.

2507
02:25:18,500 --> 02:25:25,500
Considering Nintendo isn't producing any more Wii U, so yeah. That's something to consider too.

2508
02:25:25,500 --> 02:25:31,500
JD does bring up a good point in our chat that's worth mentioning though. 400K bought Zelda for the Wii U.

2509
02:25:31,500 --> 02:25:34,500
So those people are still going to be actively using their Wii U because they bought Zelda.

2510
02:25:34,500 --> 02:25:37,500
So maybe things aren't as bad as they are in my head.

2511
02:25:37,500 --> 02:25:42,500
Because in my head I'm thinking, oh, well all these fucking people are upgrading to the Switch.

2512
02:25:42,500 --> 02:25:49,500
But even our own Dark Sakura, her and Dan didn't do that. They've been enjoying Zelda on the Wii U. Shit, so has Loki.

2513
02:25:49,500 --> 02:25:53,500
So I guess maybe perspective warps things sometimes, I suppose.

2514
02:25:54,500 --> 02:26:08,500
Yeah, most probably because even though the Switch isn't that terribly hard to get to buy, many people don't have probably the money to make the upgrade.

2515
02:26:08,500 --> 02:26:09,500
That's true.

2516
02:26:09,500 --> 02:26:16,500
So yeah, I also know a lot of people that got the Wii U version because they couldn't afford the Switch, so yeah.

2517
02:26:16,500 --> 02:26:32,500
Did you guys hear though there's already rumors, internet rumors, but I've got to mention there's already rumors that Nintendo is planning a Switch Mini for kids basically because the Switch as it is is kind of a bulky handheld.

2518
02:26:32,500 --> 02:26:37,500
I mean, I could see that. I don't know if a kid would walk around with one of those things.

2519
02:26:37,500 --> 02:26:47,500
So that they're eyeing doing a Switch Mini, but that this Mini, this is where the rumor kind of starts to lose me a little bit is that this Mini would have additional technology inside it basically.

2520
02:26:47,500 --> 02:26:58,500
And this is where I start to kind of go, hmm, I don't know if I see, I mean, true, they did it with the new 3DS, but this fast? This fast?

2521
02:26:58,500 --> 02:26:59,500
Yeah, I don't know.

2522
02:27:00,500 --> 02:27:05,500
I would be a little disappointed, and I don't want that. If they're going to put better technology in it, don't make it smaller.

2523
02:27:05,500 --> 02:27:12,500
How are you going to make a Switch Mini when the controllers are the same height as the screen without reducing the size of the screen?

2524
02:27:12,500 --> 02:27:16,500
I guess unless you increase, you make the bezel bigger, but what's the point then?

2525
02:27:16,500 --> 02:27:24,500
Yeah, I don't know. So again, it's just a rumor, so don't go crazy with it, but you know, it did kind of have me thinking like, wow, would Nintendo really do something like that?

2526
02:27:24,500 --> 02:27:33,500
But I just don't think, even if they did, I really just couldn't see it happening this year. I really feel like holiday, they're going to pour everything they have into moving as many Switches as possible.

2527
02:27:33,500 --> 02:27:42,500
But at this, maybe at this point, they're already a success. I think maybe even Nintendo wasn't prepared to have sold as many Switches as they have.

2528
02:27:42,500 --> 02:27:46,500
It seems like they always underestimate themselves. I don't know. I don't know.

2529
02:27:46,500 --> 02:27:49,500
Alright, well Act F, we're going to let you go, but thanks for the call. It was great.

2530
02:27:49,500 --> 02:27:51,500
Hey, thanks for having me.

2531
02:27:51,500 --> 02:27:54,500
No problem, and I hope those Kirby games come out soon, and they're great.

2532
02:27:54,500 --> 02:28:00,500
Well, there's already one available, so yeah. I've been playing that.

2533
02:28:00,500 --> 02:28:04,500
Did they stealth release that? Like, they just released it right after the Direct? I didn't miss that.

2534
02:28:04,500 --> 02:28:12,500
Yeah, because, this is going to be quick. Two of the games they announced, there were mini games on Planet Robobot.

2535
02:28:12,500 --> 02:28:15,500
So they pretty much expanded on those.

2536
02:28:15,500 --> 02:28:18,500
Got it, got it. I thought for some reason they were separate.

2537
02:28:18,500 --> 02:28:22,500
Yeah, Team Kirby Deluxe Clash is free to play.

2538
02:28:22,500 --> 02:28:29,500
And there is microtransactions and all that, but you don't have to pay anything if you don't want to.

2539
02:28:29,500 --> 02:28:32,500
And you can enjoy the game pretty much completely.

2540
02:28:32,500 --> 02:28:33,500
Okay, cool.

2541
02:28:33,500 --> 02:28:34,500
It's pretty cool.

2542
02:28:34,500 --> 02:28:36,500
Well, thanks for the heads up.

2543
02:28:36,500 --> 02:28:38,500
I'll talk about that another time.

2544
02:28:38,500 --> 02:28:41,500
I like free, so I'll check that out on 3DS. Thanks for the heads up.

2545
02:28:43,500 --> 02:28:44,500
Well, see you.

2546
02:28:44,500 --> 02:28:45,500
Alright, take care buddy.

2547
02:28:46,500 --> 02:28:50,500
Alright, I guess that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight because nobody else was calling in.

2548
02:28:50,500 --> 02:28:51,500
So we're going to close that down.

2549
02:28:51,500 --> 02:28:53,500
But if you do think of something after the fact, you can always email us.

2550
02:28:53,500 --> 02:28:57,500
Participate at OrangeLoungeTrader.com is the place to send us an email.

2551
02:28:57,500 --> 02:29:00,500
Loki, any other last minute stories for us tonight?

2552
02:29:00,500 --> 02:29:03,500
Yeah, so there's a couple of funny things.

2553
02:29:03,500 --> 02:29:14,500
So first one is actually Nintendo is offering bounties now for hackers to find exploits in the 3DS and the Switch.

2554
02:29:14,500 --> 02:29:19,500
And they're willing to pay, I guess, upwards from $100,000 to $20,000.

2555
02:29:19,500 --> 02:29:24,500
And I guess three hackers have already kind of contributed towards this.

2556
02:29:24,500 --> 02:29:26,500
So they have that right now.

2557
02:29:26,500 --> 02:29:31,500
Is this how they're going to combat the hacker things when it comes to the classic NES version 2?

2558
02:29:31,500 --> 02:29:35,500
I guess. I mean, I don't know.

2559
02:29:35,500 --> 02:29:40,500
And then, of course, there's this kind of funny thing.

2560
02:29:40,500 --> 02:29:47,500
So there's this guy that was a fan of the Touhou Shmup series.

2561
02:29:47,500 --> 02:29:57,500
So he developed, as kind of a fun little project, a ransomware malware that basically would force you to...

2562
02:29:57,500 --> 02:30:00,500
He called it, was it Ransomware?

2563
02:30:00,500 --> 02:30:05,500
Because it was based off of the Touhou games and ransomware.

2564
02:30:05,500 --> 02:30:20,500
And so what it would force you to do is it would lock you access to your files unless you were able to play through unidentified fantastic object on lunatic difficulty and score 200 million points.

2565
02:30:20,500 --> 02:30:27,500
Which basically even the guy who made this malware thing can't do.

2566
02:30:27,500 --> 02:30:28,500
It's not nice.

2567
02:30:28,500 --> 02:30:34,500
But he uploaded it because it was kind of a funny... He wasn't trying to infect computers.

2568
02:30:34,500 --> 02:30:37,500
It was just like, hey, look at this silly project because I love this game.

2569
02:30:37,500 --> 02:30:39,500
Of course, some people already infected their computers with it.

2570
02:30:39,500 --> 02:30:44,500
And so he actually released a patch to unlock your computer.

2571
02:30:44,500 --> 02:30:45,500
Okay. All right.

2572
02:30:45,500 --> 02:30:52,500
But ransomware is definitely kind of a high-fatal malware.

2573
02:30:53,500 --> 02:31:00,500
But I made it for a joke and just laughing with people who like Touhou project series.

2574
02:31:00,500 --> 02:31:01,500
All right.

2575
02:31:01,500 --> 02:31:02,500
All right.

2576
02:31:02,500 --> 02:31:06,500
Well, I think that's going to bring us to the end of another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

2577
02:31:06,500 --> 02:31:08,500
But thank you guys for joining us this week.

2578
02:31:08,500 --> 02:31:13,500
Thanks to our pals from Lead Money Games who came here this week to talk about Lil' Tanks.

2579
02:31:13,500 --> 02:31:15,500
Hope you all check that out on Steam.

2580
02:31:15,500 --> 02:31:20,500
Next week on the show, actually, we're going to have another guest with us.

2581
02:31:20,500 --> 02:31:21,500
I like this.

2582
02:31:21,500 --> 02:31:23,500
All of a sudden, we're getting these indie developers here on the show.

2583
02:31:23,500 --> 02:31:24,500
So this is cool.

2584
02:31:24,500 --> 02:31:28,500
This one will be by Skype, though, because he's on the other coast.

2585
02:31:28,500 --> 02:31:35,500
But we're going to be joined by Zircon, who is behind Tangledeep, which is a game that is just...

2586
02:31:35,500 --> 02:31:38,500
I think they're just wrapping up their Kickstarter in the next couple of days.

2587
02:31:38,500 --> 02:31:40,500
He's also a fucking amazing musician.

2588
02:31:40,500 --> 02:31:42,500
Yeah. So he's going to be here on the show.

2589
02:31:42,500 --> 02:31:43,500
So that'll be awesome.

2590
02:31:43,500 --> 02:31:44,500
That's pretty awesome.

2591
02:31:44,500 --> 02:31:45,500
So we can talk about Tangledeep.

2592
02:31:45,500 --> 02:31:47,500
And, Loki, we'll talk about the music as well.

2593
02:31:47,500 --> 02:31:49,500
Yes. I knew he was working on the game.

2594
02:31:49,500 --> 02:31:50,500
That's pretty awesome.

2595
02:31:50,500 --> 02:31:52,500
Yeah. He is a fucking amazing artist.

2596
02:31:52,500 --> 02:31:54,500
Well, you can fanboy next week, then, a little bit.

2597
02:31:54,500 --> 02:31:58,500
In fact, just to mention, one of his songs, actually...

2598
02:31:58,500 --> 02:32:01,500
Well, probably, I'm sure a few of his songs have made it into Cage Match.

2599
02:32:01,500 --> 02:32:02,500
He did that.

2600
02:32:02,500 --> 02:32:05,500
It was a Final Fantasy remix that I put in.

2601
02:32:05,500 --> 02:32:09,500
That was a Zircon thing that he did on Cage Match one time.

2602
02:32:09,500 --> 02:32:10,500
Wow. Okay. That's cool.

2603
02:32:10,500 --> 02:32:14,500
But, yeah, he used to do a lot of stuff on OC Remix, so it'll be cool.

2604
02:32:14,500 --> 02:32:16,500
All right. Well, I'm looking forward to that.

2605
02:32:16,500 --> 02:32:18,500
So that will be next week on the show.

2606
02:32:18,500 --> 02:32:21,500
So we'll tweet more about that as we come up on the next OLR.

2607
02:32:21,500 --> 02:32:22,500
Very awesome.

2608
02:32:22,500 --> 02:32:26,500
Unfortunately, since we had the guys from Little Tanks here this week,

2609
02:32:26,500 --> 02:32:29,500
I couldn't get him on this week when his Kickstarter is still going.

2610
02:32:29,500 --> 02:32:31,500
So I want to make sure it gets a shout-out now.

2611
02:32:31,500 --> 02:32:34,500
If you want to check this out, go check that out.

2612
02:32:34,500 --> 02:32:36,500
Again, that game is called Tangledeep.

2613
02:32:36,500 --> 02:32:42,500
You can check that out over at the Twitter, it's Tangledeep Game.

2614
02:32:42,500 --> 02:32:46,500
And I'm sure you can find all the links to the Kickstarter and all that stuff.

2615
02:32:46,500 --> 02:32:48,500
Because I think there's just a couple more days left on that.

2616
02:32:48,500 --> 02:32:51,500
So by the time he's here on the show, that will be all wrapped up.

2617
02:32:51,500 --> 02:32:53,500
But we can at least ask questions about how it went

2618
02:32:53,500 --> 02:32:56,500
and, you know, any lessons he learned from that and all that stuff.

2619
02:32:56,500 --> 02:32:58,500
Well, he's done a Kickstarter project back some of his

2620
02:32:58,500 --> 02:33:00,500
because he had some albums that came out.

2621
02:33:00,500 --> 02:33:02,500
But never a game, right? This is his first game.

2622
02:33:02,500 --> 02:33:03,500
This is his first game, yeah.

2623
02:33:03,500 --> 02:33:05,500
That's what I thought. All right, awesome.

2624
02:33:05,500 --> 02:33:07,500
So that is next week on the show.

2625
02:33:07,500 --> 02:33:11,500
But, meanwhile, hopefully, Dar Sakura will be back here next week.

2626
02:33:11,500 --> 02:33:12,500
And, Loki, you should be here too.

2627
02:33:12,500 --> 02:33:15,500
The gang will be all here for our next episode.

2628
02:33:15,500 --> 02:33:17,500
As always, at the end of an episode of Orange Laundry at O,

2629
02:33:17,500 --> 02:33:20,500
I'd like to tell you guys to please help us spread the word,

2630
02:33:20,500 --> 02:33:21,500
tell a friend or five about the show,

2631
02:33:21,500 --> 02:33:23,500
because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

2632
02:33:23,500 --> 02:33:26,500
But if the voices aren't out there, we can't air them.

2633
02:33:26,500 --> 02:33:31,500
So we really appreciate all the folks that help bring their friends

2634
02:33:31,500 --> 02:33:33,500
and even their enemies to the show.

2635
02:33:33,500 --> 02:33:35,500
If you are having a problem with the word-of-mouth stuff,

2636
02:33:35,500 --> 02:33:37,500
you can always leave a five-star review.

2637
02:33:37,500 --> 02:33:41,500
Trust me, guys, a five-star review on a place like iTunes goes a long frickin' way.

2638
02:33:41,500 --> 02:33:44,500
If you're not an iTunes person, then wherever you found this podcast,

2639
02:33:44,500 --> 02:33:50,500
like the Google Store or wherever this show may have found its way to your inbox,

2640
02:33:50,500 --> 02:33:53,500
please leave us a nice review. It would help an awful lot.

2641
02:33:53,500 --> 02:33:56,500
That is going to do it, though, for the show this week,

2642
02:33:56,500 --> 02:33:59,500
but we can't wrap it up until we get to everybody's final thought.

2643
02:33:59,500 --> 02:34:02,500
And, Loki, I'll start with you tonight. Your final thought.

2644
02:34:02,500 --> 02:34:07,500
I'm going to hopefully finish my 3D printer either, I'm guessing, probably tomorrow,

2645
02:34:07,500 --> 02:34:13,500
because I still have a bit to do and debugging and all that fun stuff.

2646
02:34:13,500 --> 02:34:16,500
So hopefully we'll get something printed this week,

2647
02:34:16,500 --> 02:34:20,500
and then we'll have to talk about the bro-programming.

2648
02:34:20,500 --> 02:34:22,500
Yes, we will. Yes, we will.

2649
02:34:22,500 --> 02:34:26,500
And who knows? Maybe Jamie will end up getting involved in that,

2650
02:34:26,500 --> 02:34:28,500
because girls can be bros, too. There's nothing wrong with that.

2651
02:34:28,500 --> 02:34:31,500
So maybe Jamie will get in on the bro-programming stuff, too.

2652
02:34:31,500 --> 02:34:32,500
So we'll see.

2653
02:34:32,500 --> 02:34:36,500
But anyway, my final thought this week is candy.

2654
02:34:36,500 --> 02:34:40,500
Thank you to Alan for bringing me candy for tonight's show,

2655
02:34:40,500 --> 02:34:42,500
because it's all raining and depressing outside,

2656
02:34:42,500 --> 02:34:44,500
so I was like, I want candy. That'll make me feel better.

2657
02:34:44,500 --> 02:34:47,500
And he brought me some of my favorites, Mike and Ike's, for the show.

2658
02:34:47,500 --> 02:34:49,500
So shout-out to Mike and Ike's for being delicious,

2659
02:34:49,500 --> 02:34:53,500
and shout-out to all the candy sales that'll be happening tomorrow,

2660
02:34:53,500 --> 02:34:57,500
and less shout-out to the fact that they will be making me fluffier.

2661
02:34:57,500 --> 02:34:59,500
But in the meantime, we'll see you in seven days

2662
02:34:59,500 --> 02:35:01,500
for an all-new episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

2663
02:35:01,500 --> 02:35:03,500
Until then, buh-bye.

2664
02:35:03,500 --> 02:35:06,500
