7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	28000	Tonight, we're back from SAK Indie Arcade and have an interview with Lead Money Games, creators of Lil' Tanks, a side-scrolling shmup available now for all Steam platforms. This, along with as much gaming news as we can possibly fit, and it all starts right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
29000	32000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	52000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 683 for this April the 16th of 2017. Happy Easter to you if you celebrate it. Happy all the candy is on sale tomorrow day if you don't.
52000	67000	My name is Rob Roberts. Here in Studio N7 in Sacramento, California, not with my co-hosts tonight, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. She sadly was not able to make it tonight. She had a little bit of last minute conflict that arose that she is currently de-conflicting.
67000	73000	But we will hear from her a little later in the show. Joining us though in studio, say hello to Techmaster Loki.
73000	74000	Hello.
74000	75000	Hi Loki, how are you?
75000	76000	Good.
76000	77000	I'm glad.
77000	78000	Filling up.
79000	82000	Your meal tonight, your meal of breadsticks, Carbolicious.
82000	83000	Yes.
83000	88000	He has risen, the yeast has risen and created your breadsticks. Yes. I see how it goes.
88000	95000	So, okay, I noticed on Facebook that you got a new toy this past week that you talked about on the show before.
95000	96000	Yes.
96000	97000	So you got a 3D printer.
97000	98000	Yes.
98000	99000	What have you printed with it?
99000	105000	I haven't printed anything with it because I haven't finished building it yet. So it's a 3D printer kit. So actually I'm putting it together.
105000	108000	Is that like an IKEA thing? You have to build it all yourself?
108000	120000	Sort of. If IKEA didn't have like full instructions and you had to go buy internet videos that also make mistakes and don't bother to edit their videos to fix the mistakes until afterwards like get four videos into it.
120000	127000	Oh, you know, we really should have done that back in like step two. You know, that fun stuff.
128000	135000	So, yeah, it's been fun. I pretty much have it assembled now. The only thing I'm working on, well, I'm starting to wire it up.
135000	143000	So I was tinning some wires before I left and hooking up the PCB and everything. But, yeah, it's been a lot of fun.
143000	151000	A lot of slow progress because like, was it one day I spent four hours trying to square the frame because it was wobbling.
151000	156000	Well, good luck and I will be very curious to know what you do end up printing first on that thing.
156000	160000	Well, I have purple and orange ABS that I purchased specifically.
160000	162000	Oh, you got the VOG colors or the OLR colors?
162000	163000	Exactly.
163000	165000	Clearly you can make a keychain or something.
165000	166000	Make something.
166000	174000	Alright, make something, dammit. Alright, we're going to get to a lot. There's been quite a bit that's been going on in gaming this week. I know we weren't here last week.
174000	181000	I hope you all had fun joining us at the SAC Indie Arcade event, which we had done on Saturday, which is why we ended up taking Sunday off.
181000	188000	We had a lot of fun with the event. A big, big thank you again to Sacramento IGDA for having us yet again this year.
188000	200000	Another series of amazing speakers. They were all really good. I really love the patent and trademark talk, which I just be, I'm going to be transparent with you guys.
200000	206000	That's right when we had the power failure. So I'm really sad we might lose that talk because it was really good.
206000	208000	But everybody, there was a lot of great talks.
208000	216000	I was going to say, stop being chats. There's so much to make a 3D printer, printable 3D printer. Well, to be honest, most 3D printers are 3D printable.
216000	227000	You can print most of the parts to it and then the rest is all open source of like, so Maker Rail, stepper motors, and you can buy, you can pretty much build your own printer from parts you buy online.
227000	234000	Well, I also see in chat over at live.vognetwork.com because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.
234000	242000	6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackall show, I see SSU100Matt says, Travis Donovan has a 3D printer and has printed some Mass Effect stuff.
242000	248000	Well, Travis Donovan would call this 3D printer printing 3D printers, recursive printing!
248000	254000	For those of you that ever listened to Understation Live, for the rest of you that haven't, that was an extremely inside joke. I apologize.
254000	262000	Anyway, Tigerclaw in chat says, Loki could also print his own cosplay costume. You could. You could print your own Tingle outfit or whatever it is.
262000	269000	I don't think Tingle has anything that's not spandex, so I don't think that would work. Can't print spandex on them.
269000	284000	You can't print spandex! Take it back! It's useless. Alright. We have some guests here in the studio this week with us, joining us here, and I'm really happy to have these guys here tonight, especially because I know it's a holiday, so thank you guys so much for being here tonight.
284000	296000	I want to introduce to you guys two of the guys, or I guess really, it's just the two of you with Lead Money Games, right? We have Andrew and Tony joining us tonight from Lead Money Games. Welcome to the show, you guys.
296000	297000	Hi, how's it going?
297000	298000	Hi, good!
298000	299000	Thanks for having us.
299000	306000	Yeah, no problem. Thanks for being here. So, you guys have just released your first game on Steam called Lil' Tanks. Congratulations!
306000	307000	Thanks.
307000	314000	How does it feel knowing that it's out there now? It's like out in the world, your game. Is it a relief?
314000	328000	Yeah, it is. I mean, it's just, we always thought that, you know, one day we'd get there, and now that one day actually happened, yeah, it feels pretty good. Like, we actually accomplished what we set out to do, so we're really happy.
328000	339000	Yeah, it's really hard to believe that it's actually happened, and we're still actually working on the game for little patches and stuff like that, but it's been so long, and it's still weird to say that it's been launched.
339000	353000	So, when does the work start on Lil' Tanks 2? No, I'm kidding. Don't answer. All right, let's rewind a bit. I want to go back to the very beginning. So, you guys, this is the first game you guys have done independently, right?
353000	354000	Correct.
354000	360000	So, where did this idea come from? Like, we're going to make a game. How was Lil' Tanks born?
360000	372000	I think a lot of us, we're all working in the visual effects industry and all like to play games ourselves and just thought about different things we could do where we would have some creative control.
372000	388000	And a lot of the work we do, you know, we get notes to make the shot look like this or make it look like this, and with our own project, we could make it look however we wanted to and really give us the freedom that a lot of our work in that particular industry didn't really provide.
388000	395000	So, that combined with the idea that we just love gaming, it just put two and two together.
395000	406000	I hear you loud and clear on that because part of the reason OLR exists is because in college I was thinking at one point I was going to be a radio DJ, but then did you know that you have to say this and you have to do it this way?
406000	413000	And you have to do, there's so many lines you have to color in and that's just not who I am. And it sounds like maybe not who you guys are either.
413000	420000	So, tell us a little bit about the game Lil' Tanks. Like, what is it? How would you describe it to somebody who's never played it?
420000	428000	I would say it's like a side-scrolling shoot-em-up. So, you're a little tank and you drive around and destroy aliens.
428000	433000	And with this game though, I don't know about Tony, but I'm terrible at shoot-em-ups and bullet hell games.
433000	443000	So, we wanted to make something where if you were terrible at this game, as long as you kept playing it, then you would get better by the tank leveling up.
443000	451000	So, there's like some RPG elements in it where every single enemy you kill gives you a little bit of experience and every bit of experience helps you level up.
451000	459000	And when you level up, you get permanent upgrades to your tank. So, it makes it a lot easier to beat the level you're on and it's actually possible to beat this entire game.
459000	466000	It just takes time and a little bit of grinding sometimes, but it's definitely possible to beat the game even if you're terrible.
466000	469000	Yeah, that was one thing you guys were kind enough to let me check out the game a couple of weeks ago.
469000	475000	And that was one thing I noticed right off the bat that kind of separated it for me from other bullet hell types of games.
475000	479000	Well, for one, it runs the wrong way. The wrong way. I'm using my quote-y fingers.
479000	481000	I mean, I guess there's game side-scrolling.
481000	489000	There is. I'm thinking, what's that Neo Geo game that's heavy metal? Is that it? Am I thinking of? Somebody in chat knows.
489000	490000	Metal Slug?
490000	491000	Is it? Nah, maybe Metal Slug. I don't know.
491000	494000	That's a little bit different. No, they have side-scroller shmups.
494000	497000	But most times when you think of bullet hell, you think of the vertical ones, right?
497000	498000	Oh, yeah.
498000	500000	Yeah, so this one runs horizontal, so it's a little different.
500000	505000	But one of the first things I noticed, I like that twist that you put on it, is that you have that progression in it.
505000	515000	So you feel like you're accomplishing something and it's like, oh, maybe this will allow me to get past that point I was stuck at previously now that I have XYZ type of power-ups.
515000	516000	Yeah, yeah.
516000	520000	So where did that, where did that, was it just kind of like this is what I would want in a game?
520000	522000	Or how did you, how did you get to that feature?
522000	527000	I think just making the game straight out like a shoot-em-up was just too difficult.
527000	535000	And I think I really love like role-playing games. I played a lot of like World of Warcraft, a lot of Final Fantasy when I was growing up.
535000	543000	And I just love role-playing games and I wanted to make something, or we wanted to make something that would incorporate that into like a shoot-em-up, trying to make something different.
543000	548000	And I think it just randomly kind of worked and we tried it and it was fun and we just went with it.
548000	553000	Yeah. And I think in addition to that, it just, it seemed like it made perfect sense.
553000	563000	Even other just like traditional shooters will have introduced things where you can get different weapons or just give you more room to customize.
563000	567000	And so it just seemed like it was a natural fit for it.
567000	571000	I see some folks in chat are actually asking where the game is. They want to check this game out.
571000	575000	So let's tell them where to find it. It's on Steam right now, right? You can search for Lil' Tanks.
575000	578000	Steam is the only place right now you can get it? Are you on any other stores?
578000	581000	Yeah, we're trying to get it on other stores right now, but we're having a little bit of difficulty.
581000	589000	But if you just search for the game on Steam, it's L-I-L space T-A-N-K-S, just Lil' Tanks. It'll pop right up.
589000	593000	Awesome. And then there's also a website, liltanksgame.com. Did I get that right?
593000	594000	Yeah.
594000	600000	All right. You can also go there and check it out. You got the Twitter, you got Twitter, Facebook, all that stuff that a game studio has got to have for the game.
600000	606000	I understand what you're saying. So I want to talk a little more about what you kind of went through to make this game.
606000	614000	So you guys were visual effects guys. So did you ever program a game before? Was this like how you were going to kind of learn to do it?
614000	619000	Or how did you make that transition from visual effects to gaming programmer?
619000	624000	Me personally, I did not have too much programming background.
624000	634000	I mean, we had done, I had done some basic scripting working in visual effects, but as far as writing an entire program from scratch, that wasn't something I had really done.
634000	647000	But a lot of the resources available to learn this kind of thing. And because it was going to be our own project, I had a lot more motivation to learn it than I might have in another circumstance.
647000	659000	So for me, I always wanted to make video games when I was younger, but I went to Santa Rosa Junior College and tried to take some programming classes and quickly learned that I could not understand it.
659000	665000	I couldn't get it and it was too difficult. So I actually went to art school instead of pursuing that career.
665000	671000	And then we ended up working together at DreamWorks and we used to always talk about video games and stuff.
671000	680000	But at DreamWorks, it was cool because you could do the work several ways. There's a way to do the work that's quickly done.
680000	688000	And then there's a way to do the work where you can go outside of the normal means and you can write Python scripts and have stuff automated.
688000	695000	And I always took the hard route because I hated, I didn't hate the job, but it was a lot of the stuff.
695000	697000	We always push ourselves to do better.
697000	698000	Yeah, exactly.
698000	701000	Now, you weren't responsible for the minions, were you?
701000	702000	No, no, no.
702000	703000	Oh, thank God. All right.
703000	704000	Illumination.
704000	706000	Oh, good. I'm glad I'm fixing that.
706000	707000	DreamWorks is just a publisher.
707000	708000	Okay. All right.
708000	709000	No, no.
709000	710000	My gosh. All right.
710000	714000	So I learned a lot of Python on the job, which is really cool at DreamWorks.
714000	722000	They actually give you classes on whatever you want to take, even though it doesn't quite relate to your profession or your department.
722000	724000	So I always would do that kind of stuff.
724000	730000	And then when we decided to make games, we had no experience making any type of game.
730000	737000	But I kind of knew the language of Python and it kind of transferred over to the engine we use, which is called GameMaker.
737000	739000	And it kind of was second nature.
739000	744000	And then we just watched millions of tutorials and got it to work.
744000	746000	That's outstanding.
746000	751000	I mean, congrats, you guys, that your first game is of a quality where you can be selling it on Steam.
751000	753000	And, you know, that's amazing.
753000	755000	Like, you know, like he can't finish a damn game.
755000	757000	I tried. I tried.
757000	759000	And, you know, I see them with kids.
759000	760000	I always pick.
760000	762000	I believe this one does have kids.
762000	765000	I have two kids and Tony has one kid.
765000	768000	I try again.
768000	772000	They were not as annoying as my kids.
772000	774000	But no, no, to me, I always give him shit.
774000	777000	But to be fair, like I tried to, you know, we had some we had the guys.
777000	779000	What was the YouTube things that they made cooking with unity?
779000	780000	That was it, right?
780000	781000	Yeah.
781000	782000	We had them on the show and I felt very empowered.
782000	783000	I was like, fuck yeah, I'm going to do this.
783000	785000	I'm going to learn how to do unity and I'm going to make my game.
785000	786000	I have my concept for my game.
786000	788000	Like I totally knew my game was going to still do that.
788000	789000	I know.
789000	790000	And then I sat down and I tried to do it.
790000	792000	I'm like, this is too hard.
792000	793000	I'm serious.
793000	798000	I can give you a tutorial that I know like Braxies is one I follow on YouTube quite a bit.
798000	800000	And he's got a really short one.
800000	803000	It's a really polished looking game and it's short.
803000	804000	All right.
804000	805000	So you should do that.
805000	806000	Try to do it.
806000	807000	That's what we need to do.
807000	808000	Honest to God.
808000	809000	When I was doing together.
809000	810000	How about that?
810000	811000	We do.
811000	812000	Let's do something together.
812000	813000	That's sweet.
813000	814000	Cause then that'll motivate us.
814000	818000	We're going to brogram.
818000	823000	We're going to brogram a game together.
823000	824000	I think I just.
824000	825000	Hashtag.
825000	827000	This is where it pops up in the corner of our reality show.
827000	828000	Hashtag brogram.
828000	832000	Which Bobby says, now Rob will never finish a game too.
832000	834000	Well, I, I already hadn't.
834000	836000	So, but you know what?
836000	838000	I've been doing this podcast for 15 fucking years.
838000	839000	So you know what?
839000	842000	At least, at least I've done something, something.
842000	843000	All right.
843000	844000	I love that.
844000	845000	Here's the thing.
845000	846000	I don't, I don't know how old you guys are.
846000	850000	Probably not as old as me, but when I was younger, I was learning a Commodore 64 basic,
850000	851000	right?
851000	852000	It was like the language back in the day.
852000	854000	I love my Commodore 64.
854000	857000	And what you could do is you could type programs from the back of magazines.
857000	858000	Right?
858000	860000	And so part of the way I would kind of learn about it is that you type program for the
860000	861000	back of the magazine.
861000	865000	Do you like change one little thing and like, Oh, I'm going to make this a yellow color
865000	866000	instead of a blue color.
866000	867000	And it's like, yeah, I did that.
867000	869000	So that was kind of part of the way I learned.
869000	873000	So I think if I could take the same approach with something like unity or, or whatever
873000	878000	it is we decide to use in our programming event, then, um, then yeah, we can, I can,
878000	880000	I could probably learn a lot easier, so we'll see.
880000	881000	Anyway, sorry.
881000	883000	I didn't mean to make it about us, but that happens here.
883000	884000	I apologize.
884000	885000	But congrats.
885000	890000	I mean, again, that's awesome that like, you guys were like, we want to make a game.
890000	894000	We have this idea and you, you learned how to program through all the videos and, and,
894000	897000	and, and came out with something that, you know, I've played and I can tell people is,
897000	898000	is a quality product.
898000	900000	It's not like, well, thanks.
900000	902000	You know, something, I don't know.
902000	906000	It's, it's not like a rush thing or something that seems like short sizes.
906000	907000	It's not, it's not a piece of shit.
907000	908000	Yeah.
908000	909000	It's not a piece of shit.
909000	910000	It's not, I mean, that's, that's the easiest way to put it.
910000	915000	Uh, considering a lot of stuff goes through, there's a lot of shit on steam.
915000	916000	I don't know if you've looked.
916000	917000	Yeah.
917000	918000	Oh yeah.
918000	919000	All right.
919000	922000	It's nice to not be in that category, but I mean, you guys have your, your cut scenes
922000	926000	that you're doing, your, your game itself, this progression system that, you know, didn't
926000	927000	exist in games before.
927000	929000	That's, that's just fucking impressive.
929000	930000	Congrats.
930000	933000	You know, I'm sure there's some people out there, not everybody's going to love your
933000	936000	game and there's always going to be haters out there, but you know, props to you guys
936000	938000	for accomplishing what you've done.
938000	939000	So yeah.
939000	941000	Um, let me, uh, let me ask this.
941000	946000	I want to ask about, uh, how long did it take to make this game through this process?
946000	947000	So you kind of had to learn this.
948000	950000	We weren't really doing it full time.
950000	956000	Um, at first, cause we were trying to get like jobs and not, you know, do full time,
956000	960000	uh, game development, but, uh, it's been on and off about two years.
960000	962000	Um, probably the last year has been full time.
962000	963000	Right.
963000	964000	Tony, do you think?
964000	965000	Yeah.
965000	968000	Just about, but it's about a two years work and then, um, we just finally released.
968000	970000	So, yeah.
970000	973000	So you guys actually went and I noticed you're actually wearing a shirt here.
973000	977000	Uh, Tony's wearing a shirt that says little tanks funded by Kickstarter.
977000	980000	So you guys actually ran a Kickstarter campaign for this.
980000	981000	Yeah, we did.
981000	982000	Yeah.
982000	986000	And you, you were successful with your Kickstarter campaign for your brand new game of your brand
986000	987000	new studio.
987000	990000	Do you, do you guys know how rare that is to succeed?
990000	992000	I mean, congratulations.
992000	993000	Thank you.
993000	994000	A big time with that.
994000	996000	Uh, I don't mean to keep like talking you guys up, but I'm impressed.
996000	999000	The more that I hear about what went into this, I'm just like, wow, you guys really
999000	1001000	like beat the odds to do this.
1001000	1006000	So the Kickstarter campaign, um, why, why did you have to go to Kickstarter?
1006000	1012000	So, uh, we're both artists, but we're not like the high level, um, artists that are
1012000	1014000	required to make like cinematics.
1014000	1019000	So what we really want to do is we wanted to, um, get some money so we could hire like
1019000	1023000	a cinematic artists and make us some, some screens so we can use them in the game.
1023000	1027000	Um, cause we knew that we could probably make something, but it wouldn't be to that high
1027000	1029000	level quality that we really wanted.
1029000	1033000	So we had to go to Kickstarter to see if we could make it happen.
1033000	1034000	Yeah.
1034000	1039000	It kind of came from that and we wanted to, uh, being at this, it was our first kind of
1039000	1045000	step out into the world of game development, have some help with the marketing, kind of
1045000	1046000	getting the word out there.
1046000	1050000	And it wasn't really an effort to fund the entire game.
1050000	1054000	Just kind of like, like the final stretch, like this would help us the game.
1054000	1058000	We're happy with where it's at, but what we really, where we really want to get it to,
1058000	1059000	we need a little bit of help.
1059000	1060000	And so, okay.
1060000	1064000	And that's why I, and I looked at your, your goal for the Kickstarter was probably only
1064000	1068000	around like what, $5,000, which for a game developments relatively low.
1068000	1069000	Yeah.
1069000	1070000	So, okay.
1070000	1073000	So I mean, I think that's, that's definitely a part of the reason I'm sure you guys are
1073000	1076000	successful is that, you know, since you already kind of had your product, it was just kind
1076000	1080000	of like, I need that last 10% push and the final polish on it.
1080000	1081000	Yeah.
1081000	1084000	I think that probably helped a lot where you were in this position where we didn't really
1084000	1088000	need like full funding for the game and we didn't want to, you know, ask for that.
1088000	1092000	We just wanted a little bit of help to get exactly what we wanted.
1092000	1097000	And we were lucky we put it solo and we weren't greedy about it because we weren't trying
1097000	1099000	to become rich off our Kickstarter.
1099000	1103000	We knew our game wasn't huge like that, but we need a little bit of help and it really
1103000	1104000	helps out.
1104000	1105000	No, congratulations.
1105000	1106000	Yeah.
1106000	1107000	We just wanted to set a realistic goal.
1107000	1112000	And we know people when you're, when you're buying the game, even now when it's fully
1112000	1116000	released, you know, you're taking a little bit of a chance and when you're buying a game
1116000	1121000	that doesn't even fully exist yet, you know, you're really kind of like putting a little
1121000	1123000	bit of trust in us, even if, you know, throwing us a few dollars.
1123000	1127000	But it was important that we deliver what we are promising.
1127000	1128000	Yeah.
1128000	1129000	Yeah.
1129000	1130000	Yeah.
1130000	1131000	Well, again, congratulations.
1131000	1132000	I mean, you guys made your Kickstarter.
1132000	1133000	You got your game out there.
1133000	1134000	That's, that's a great story.
1134000	1138000	And now that'll help that when you decide to do game number two, which I hope, you know,
1138000	1141000	you guys are thinking about someday, I know you want to see your little tanks with patches
1141000	1145000	to, to be fully realized and so forth, but you know, someday you guys will probably
1145000	1148000	want to do a second game and now you'll have that on your resume and that's something you
1148000	1151000	can take to the population out there as well.
1151000	1153000	So awesome.
1153000	1158000	So what would you say was like the biggest thing you guys learned from this whole experience
1158000	1162000	since you were new to game development at the time and you've gone, you've put this
1162000	1165000	out on Steam, you know, there might be people out there who are thinking of making their
1165000	1166000	own game someday.
1166000	1169000	Maybe someday Loki will actually finish Time to Car or whatever he wants to work on.
1169000	1170000	I'm not working on that anymore.
1170000	1171000	I'm sorry, the canceled project.
1171000	1172000	It's time to cancel.
1172000	1173000	Shelved.
1173000	1174000	Shelved.
1174000	1179000	So, uh, what would you say was like the, the, uh, a big lesson, one big lesson you would,
1179000	1182000	you would tell other people you learned through this?
1182000	1187000	Uh, one thing I could think of was just to try to plan every possible thing that you
1187000	1193000	can, because I don't know how far we were into developing the game when we, you know,
1193000	1197000	we need, when we realized we need to introduce just a pause feature and the way we're able
1198000	1204000	to implement it, we had to go back and edit every single, you know, thing we had done
1204000	1205000	so far.
1205000	1209000	So just trying to think out everything you're going to need to do in advance as much as
1209000	1210000	possible.
1210000	1214000	I think, uh, for me it was, uh, originally the game was supposed to be a mobile game
1214000	1218000	and we wanted to make something really short and like test the waters.
1218000	1221000	I was saying, Oh Tony, I could totally make this game in like six months.
1221000	1225000	We'll sell it, make some money and then we'll see how the game industry works and then we'll
1225000	1226000	make a really big game.
1226000	1229000	So originally this game was supposed to be like super small and quick, but it just took
1229000	1232000	over our lives and it ended up taking two years.
1232000	1237000	So my advice would be like, let's say if you are going to make a game, um, try to plan
1237000	1241000	small, but at the same time make something you really, really want to make because it
1241000	1245000	will take up a big chunk of your life just to make this game.
1245000	1250000	So don't try to make something that you kind of like, make something you really love because
1250000	1252000	it's, it's always going to take a ton of time.
1252000	1254000	Yeah, I think that's really solid advice.
1254000	1258000	If you guys have questions for lead money games, you can ask those in chat over at
1258000	1260000	live.vognetwork.com.
1260000	1264000	Uh, we are in the chat of course, uh, live here on this Sunday evening.
1264000	1268000	Uh, so if you have any questions for the guys here behind little tanks, lead money games,
1268000	1271000	uh, ask away in our chat and we'll get some of those out here.
1271000	1275000	Let's talk about actually, cause we, we mentioned before the show, um, I was mispronouncing
1275000	1276000	the name of your studio.
1276000	1280000	I had called it lead money games and I guess because I think tanks, I think metal, I think
1280000	1281000	lead, right?
1281000	1285000	But I guess it's actually lead money games, which first off, can we give props to voiceover
1285000	1290000	guy, Jason, by the way, who actually got the first time when you told me it was lead money
1290000	1291000	games.
1291000	1292000	I was like, Oh shit.
1292000	1294000	And I went and listened to this week's intro and I was like, wow, Jason got it.
1294000	1295000	He got it.
1295000	1296000	I didn't get it.
1296000	1297000	He got it.
1297000	1298000	So where's the name come from?
1298000	1303000	So, uh, when we worked at dreamworks, uh, Tony and I were both, uh, lead artists and,
1303000	1309000	uh, as a lead artist in our department, we, um, took on a ton of responsibilities and,
1309000	1312000	uh, way more than the average artists would do.
1312000	1315000	And, uh, we were in charge of a lot of shots and approving shots.
1315000	1320000	And then, um, at the end of the day, we made the same amount of money as everyone else.
1320000	1325000	Um, so we always would joke around and say, Hey, um, Tony, you're going to buy a house
1325000	1327000	with all that lead money you just made.
1327000	1330000	And we would joke about it all the time.
1330000	1333000	And, uh, I think Tony was the one who came up with the name.
1333000	1335000	He's like, Oh, let's call our company lead money games.
1335000	1341000	And at one point we saw a website, um, uh, domain, it was lead money games, that cash
1341000	1344000	you tried to get, but it was too expensive or something.
1344000	1345000	Okay.
1345000	1346000	I seriously love that story.
1346000	1348000	I won't fuck that name up again after hearing that.
1348000	1350000	That's a great story behind that.
1350000	1354000	So, um, tell us a little bit about some of the things you might be working on for the
1354000	1355000	games future.
1355000	1357000	I understand you may not want to give away all your secrets, but what do people have
1357000	1361000	to look forward to, um, that, you know, cause we, I bet we have some people that might be
1361000	1364000	listening that already follow you guys and heard you were going to be on here tonight.
1364000	1367000	What are some of the things they might have to look forward to in future patches?
1367000	1372000	Um, well, besides just like, we're going to try to tweak, uh, a few little things, gameplay
1372000	1375000	wise, just to try and balance things out.
1375000	1381000	But, uh, the, the main thing we're working on right now is going to be the addition of,
1381000	1383000	uh, two more stages.
1383000	1388000	Um, one of the tiers on our Kickstarter was that you're able to design a stage from scratch.
1388000	1393000	You know, you select the location, enemies design, the boss, so on, so forth.
1393000	1398000	And so, uh, we're working with, uh, the, the couple of people that backed us at that tier
1398000	1403000	right now, and those are going to be made available, uh, as a patch, it's going to be
1403000	1406000	free content, not extra money or anything like that.
1406000	1409000	It's just going to be added right onto the game.
1409000	1414000	Um, after that, maybe add a little bit more weapon variety, but we're still kind of playing
1414000	1416000	with ideas, but for sure, the two stages.
1416000	1417000	Yeah.
1417000	1421000	Like, uh, those one thing, like, um, we got some from some reviews are saying like the
1421000	1422800	last level is kind of a bummer.
1422800	1425400	The boss is super hard and it's difficult to get to that boss.
1425400	1427800	And then when you get there, it's difficult to beat the boss.
1427800	1428800	Maybe they need to get good.
1428800	1429800	Yeah.
1429800	1430800	That's what I think.
1430800	1431800	That's what Tony said.
1431800	1436800	But, uh, but actually we're going to try to make that stage more fun by check.
1436800	1437800	Talk about it.
1437800	1438800	Okay.
1438800	1442800	So we're, uh, our idea is we're going to have, um, so the last stage, instead of just driving
1442800	1447680	up to the boss and find the boss, we're introducing, uh, three new mini bosses, but we're going
1447680	1450260	to have them just one pop on randomly.
1450260	1454500	So it's randomly selected, uh, to start the level and then, uh, it's going to be just
1454500	1456260	like more fun than difficult.
1456260	1460420	And once you beat that enemy, uh, and once you'd be that boss, you'll get a ton of experience.
1460420	1463860	So instead of grinding out the fifth level over and over again, or six level over and
1463860	1469180	over again, instead, um, you could just play, uh, that the final level and it'll be different
1469180	1473620	almost every time you play and then, um, get that needed experience that to cap out.
1473620	1477080	So you have a better chance of, you know, defeating that last boss.
1477080	1478460	So hopefully it'll make it more fun that way.
1478460	1479460	Well, thank you.
1479460	1481180	I feel like we just got an exclusive there.
1481180	1482180	Awesome.
1482180	1483180	Awesome.
1483180	1484180	All right.
1484180	1485180	exclusive on OLR.
1485180	1486180	Awesome.
1486180	1487180	Uh, well, good, good luck with that.
1487180	1489940	That sounds, uh, I like that concept, like maybe the three little mini bosses that could
1489940	1490940	be randomized a little bit.
1490940	1491940	Okay.
1491940	1492940	That'd be cool.
1492940	1495740	Um, do you ever, this is something I've heard from some indie developers that is always
1495740	1499280	like a phenomenon, uh, especially when they put their first game out there in this day
1499280	1503180	and age that we live in, in 2017, maybe you have, or haven't experienced this yet.
1503180	1505420	Have you seen anybody live streaming your game?
1505420	1509900	Have you seen any of that feedback directly or YouTube or any of that stuff?
1509900	1515460	We have, um, luckily, uh, early on we found someone, uh, named high site and he does a
1515460	1520180	bunch of, uh, indie reviews where he plays the game for the first time on Twitch and
1520180	1525020	he streams it and he gives like live feedback and a bunch of people give feedback.
1525020	1530260	And um, we did that and it made us sweat like crazy and realize what we were doing wrong.
1530260	1532100	You know, it was great feedback at the start there.
1532100	1533100	Yeah.
1533100	1534100	But not too many people live streaming.
1534100	1535100	I don't think.
1535780	1536780	Yeah.
1536780	1539820	I mean, at that stage we were still, uh, fairly early on in development, but we got a lot
1539820	1545660	of helpful feedback and then, uh, once we've released, we've seen a handful of people kind
1545660	1551280	of do like a let's play type of deal where they'll play for 20, 30 minutes and so far
1551280	1554920	seems to be mostly positive feedback, a lot of laughs, which is good.
1554920	1560040	So, um, what do you, what do you think now that this is like out there in the world?
1560040	1563360	Again, I know, I know there's still more coming with little tanks, but as you've kind of made
1563400	1567960	that transition from, you know, we were doing this visual artist thing to gaming was, uh,
1567960	1571840	or the game development was kind of a hobby to, well, now it's taken up a lot more of
1571840	1572840	my time.
1572840	1573840	Yeah.
1573840	1574840	Is, is this it now?
1574840	1575840	Is this going to be the career path for you guys?
1575840	1577360	Or do you plan to make more games?
1577360	1580720	Is this, is this the first of many from lead money?
1580720	1581720	We're actually both.
1581720	1586620	Um, so our idea is we're both kind of prototyping different games and then which we're going
1586620	1590100	to test them out and see which one we really like and then start developing that one.
1590100	1591260	So this isn't the end.
1591260	1594460	This is just the first game and we want to keep doing this forever because we love it
1594460	1595460	so much.
1595460	1601100	And it's like we finally found the thing that we love to do and we can actually do it together,
1601100	1602100	which is great.
1602100	1603100	Yeah.
1603100	1604100	We get to keep working.
1604100	1607300	You know, we worked together for several years, went to school together and stuff.
1607300	1609660	So, uh, we go way back.
1609660	1612980	It's fun to work with a, with a friend and we can work from home.
1612980	1618740	You know, as Andrew and Andrew has a couple of kids and I'd have a six month old at home.
1618740	1623360	So I'm able to spend a lot of time with my family and get to work on something I love.
1623360	1625220	So yeah, I hope this is the first of many.
1625220	1626220	Yeah.
1626220	1627220	All right.
1627220	1628220	That's a great story.
1628220	1629220	So let's, let's plug the game one more time.
1629220	1630540	Make sure everybody knows where to get it.
1630540	1632500	Little tanks available on steam, right?
1632500	1633500	Yes.
1633500	1634500	Where else?
1634500	1635500	What else should we know?
1635500	1636500	Uh, any other plugs we've got to get out?
1636500	1640780	Uh, yeah, it's on, uh, windows, Mac and Linux.
1640780	1644340	Uh, super fun.
1644340	1645340	Best game ever.
1645340	1646340	Good, good, good.
1647060	1648060	Good.
1648060	1649060	Good.
1649060	1650060	You have to keep selling it that way.
1650060	1651060	It's the best game you'll ever play.
1651060	1652060	You'll never want to play another game again.
1652060	1653060	True story.
1653060	1657460	Um, any, I, I would be a terrible video game radio host if I didn't prod this question.
1657460	1661900	Any plans to do consoles, something outside of PC?
1661900	1665860	So right now, um, we're both pretty poor and, um, takes money to do stuff like that.
1665860	1670720	But if the game does take off and, um, people seem to like it, we would love to do it.
1670720	1674580	I would love to see, um, little tanks on every console if I could.
1674580	1679620	Um, but it all takes time and development and money, of course, but, um, if it does,
1679620	1680620	we would love to do it.
1680620	1681620	Yeah.
1681620	1682620	Yeah.
1682620	1683620	Get on the switch.
1683620	1684620	That's the hot shit right now.
1684620	1685620	Yeah.
1685620	1686620	It could be console and portable and all that stuff.
1686620	1687620	Yeah.
1687620	1688620	Yeah.
1688620	1689980	Let me ask this because we're going to transition into talking about news and the types of video
1689980	1691540	games that we've been playing this week.
1691540	1695020	Um, what, what, what's like, I like to ask a lot of people to come to the studio.
1695020	1699340	This question, what is what you, you would think if you could only pick one, just one,
1699340	1703620	your favorite video game of all time or your most influential video game of all time, and
1703620	1707820	you can only pick one if you, if you start on a second one, I'm turning it off one game.
1707820	1712460	I know exactly which one I'm kind of embarrassed to say though, um, don't be embarrassed because
1712460	1713460	I was an addict.
1713460	1717060	I told you the show started for DDR, so you have nothing to be embarrassed about.
1717060	1720860	Well, I think I would, I would get into World of Warcraft and destroy my life again.
1720860	1725140	There's, there's nothing, ah, no, it's World of War, there's definitely World of Warcraft
1725140	1726140	for me.
1726140	1730780	So, so I know these guys, thanks to, uh, Captain Matt from Starboard Power Compling knows you
1730780	1731780	guys.
1731780	1734540	I don't know if he told you he, him and I used to co-host a show here on the network
1734540	1737180	called Horde House, which was about World of Warcraft.
1737180	1738180	Yeah.
1738180	1741380	So you can take that back and uh, yeah, it was called Horde House.
1741380	1742380	Oh, Horde House.
1742380	1743380	Yeah.
1743380	1744380	That, that was the joke.
1744380	1745380	Wink.
1745380	1746380	Yeah.
1746380	1747380	It was called Horde House.
1747380	1750220	It was very, if you want to hear like what a dirty son of a bitch that guy is, go listen
1750220	1751660	to, go listen to old episodes.
1751660	1752660	It's not on anymore.
1752660	1753660	Sadly.
1753660	1756180	We all stopped playing, but um, yeah, that's good.
1756180	1757180	That's good that we stopped playing.
1757180	1758180	Yeah.
1758180	1759180	It's so addicting.
1759180	1760180	You got it.
1760180	1761180	You got to get it, get out of there and live the rest of your life.
1761580	1765740	Well, dark soccer is still playing, but everything in moderation, you know, like, you know, I
1765740	1770500	played Final Fantasy 14, which probably just as bad, but I don't do, I don't do any of
1770500	1771980	the raiding stuff anymore.
1771980	1773900	I think that's once you can kind of separate yourself from that.
1773900	1778740	You should get into a new MMO, like, uh, the Elder Scrolls Online or something like that.
1778740	1779740	I tried.
1779740	1780740	Cause that just paid it.
1780740	1781740	I couldn't get into Elder Scrolls Online.
1781740	1782740	I couldn't either.
1782740	1783740	I tried.
1783740	1784740	I tried.
1784740	1785740	I just, but you know what?
1785740	1789980	I tried when it first came out on PlayStation four as the Guild Wars model where it's, you
1789980	1790980	don't have a monthly fee.
1790980	1791980	It still is that.
1791980	1792980	Yeah.
1792980	1793980	Yeah.
1793980	1794980	I know.
1794980	1795980	I know.
1795980	1796980	But when I first, it was just buggy and all that.
1796980	1797980	So a lot of that's probably fixed now.
1797980	1798980	So I probably do owe it a second shot, but you know, I don't know.
1798980	1799980	I don't know.
1799980	1800980	We'll see.
1800980	1801980	Now I play Pokemon Go.
1801980	1802980	At least that gets me outside.
1802980	1803980	So, all right.
1803980	1804980	So World of Warcraft.
1804980	1805980	What about, what about for you?
1805980	1810580	Uh, for me has to be a Mario 64.
1810580	1813980	So Mario, Mario, uh, the platformer, not the cart.
1813980	1814980	Yeah.
1814980	1815980	Yeah.
1815980	1816980	Okay.
1816980	1817980	Platformer.
1817980	1818980	I just, I still remember the day I got it.
1818980	1819980	Uh, I just, I just love it.
1819980	1820980	Uh, yeah.
1820980	1825480	I like watching the speed runs of that stuff where people just blow through the game like
1825480	1828980	minimal stars and do all these crazy tricks.
1828980	1831980	Maybe, maybe some of these days we'll see people speed running your game or something.
1831980	1834980	Cause you know, you do have the, you can build on it, but I'm sure you can go from start
1834980	1836980	to finish or just the basics if you're good enough.
1836980	1837980	Right.
1837980	1838980	Uh, maybe.
1838980	1839980	Yeah.
1839980	1840980	Yeah.
1840980	1841980	Yeah.
1841980	1842980	Yeah.
1842980	1843980	Yeah.
1843980	1844980	Yeah.
1844980	1845980	Yeah.
1845980	1846980	Yeah.
1846980	1847980	Yeah.
1847980	1848980	Maybe.
1848980	1849980	Maybe.
1849980	1850980	Yeah.
1850980	1851980	Can you beat your own game?
1851980	1852980	Yes.
1852980	1853980	Okay.
1853980	1857500	I have to, I have to ask because you know, there's people, I bet if I brought on the
1857500	1860700	developers of dark souls, they may not, I may get some nose out of that.
1860700	1861700	We'll see.
1861700	1862700	All right.
1862700	1863700	Uh, let's see.
1863700	1864700	You can beat your own game.
1864700	1865820	It's not done yet.
1865820	1868300	Some well wishes in our chat room over at live.vog.org.com.
1868300	1870060	Fantas says game is lit.
1870060	1872740	Uh, act F says the best of luck to these guys.
1872740	1874420	The game, it does look fun.
1874420	1876320	So a Robert M says it looks interesting.
1876320	1878400	So I think there's a lot of people checking that out right now.
1878400	1881280	So hopefully, uh, hopefully, uh, some more people will check it out.
1881280	1882800	Thanks to you guys coming here tonight.
1882800	1883800	Great.
1883800	1886600	Uh, we're going to move on and talk a little bit about, um, what's going on in gaming news
1886600	1892520	and our gaming weeks and so forth, but please as gaming fans, stick around and give us your
1892520	1894520	input on what's going on with the gaming news.
1894520	1895520	Okay.
1895520	1896520	All right.
1896520	1897520	Awesome.
1897520	1899400	So let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we've been playing
1899400	1900400	this week.
1900400	1902280	So you guys may not know this, but we like to go around every week.
1902280	1905740	We just talk about a game or two that we've been playing this week and what we're into
1905740	1906740	with it.
1906740	1909220	So Loki's going to start in a game or two is pretty much going to be what it is.
1909220	1911800	Cause like I said, it's building a 3d printer most of the week.
1911800	1918140	So, um, I still playing Skyrim still like, God, I didn't know how many hundred of our
1918140	1921860	heart, how many hours a minute, Oh, it's over a hundred.
1921860	1925380	And so I'm actually running into new quest lines that I've never played before because
1925380	1930120	I've finished most of the mainland remains storyline stuff.
1930120	1933240	So now I'm just kind of hitting up all those other quests like, Oh, I didn't even know
1933240	1934240	that one was there.
1934240	1935440	And that's kind of cool.
1935440	1940020	So just still playing through that and then, um, occasionally playing Pokemon go just mainly
1940020	1943000	just to do the, you know, daily stuff.
1943000	1944000	That's it.
1944000	1945240	Well, they have that double XP thing.
1945240	1946240	Yeah.
1946240	1949840	I evolved, you know, all my stuff that had been saving up and that's about it.
1949840	1951760	I mean, I don't know.
1951760	1956820	I, they say that you get better stuff out of the eggs, but like I have these five kilometer
1956820	1957820	eggs have been hatching.
1957820	1958820	It's all common nonsense.
1958820	1961600	Like, Oh, goody bullshit that can just get anywhere.
1961600	1963880	It's the two K eggs that have all the better stuff.
1963880	1964880	Right?
1965320	1968040	But I was already in the middle of, you know, five K when I was doing it.
1968040	1974640	And even still though, like, yeah, I still haven't gotten any of the like baby, um, series
1974640	1975640	two stuff.
1975640	1978960	Oh, like the Clefas and I haven't gotten any of those ever.
1978960	1979960	Wow.
1979960	1980960	Yeah.
1980960	1983720	I think though, actually I just hatched a toga P out of a two K during this event.
1983720	1984720	So they're there.
1984720	1985720	Well, I'll do that.
1985720	1988040	I still have a 10 K that I'm working on right now.
1988040	1989040	So, okay.
1989040	1990040	I don't know.
1990040	1993200	You see this sunburn that I have that is from playing Pokemon go yesterday.
1993200	1994200	Actually we went out.
1994520	1998100	And my friend who doesn't really play a lot of video games was super into Pokemon go was
1998100	2001920	like, let's go up to Cameron park because they have the Lake up there because that's
2001920	2003920	the place where they might have a dratini.
2003920	2007560	Although of course none showed up yesterday, but there was, yeah, there's a shit ton of
2007560	2008560	magic harps though.
2008560	2011680	So it was like, you know, it was like, it was kind of like going to pier 39, but like
2011680	2014520	not as much like, so, you know, I don't know.
2014520	2018480	So I walked around like three laps there and I got the sunburn and so forth, but I got
2018480	2023520	to tell you this, I am really blown away by the people that are playing Pokemon go because
2023520	2026940	the only people that were at the Lake yesterday were all Pokemon go players.
2026940	2030200	And it was either like, it was the family, they had their kids and they were on the phone.
2030200	2031640	You'd see like the couple that's together.
2031640	2032640	They're on their phones.
2032640	2036200	I saw like older people are super getting into Pokemon go.
2036200	2041520	I saw these two old late little old ladies were walking around and it was like, Oh, Martha,
2041520	2043120	did you see the pine go over there?
2043120	2044120	And they were talking about Pokemon.
2044120	2048880	I was like, what the, this is, this is awesome that like grandma's playing Pokemon go.
2048880	2052920	Like I remember when older ladies hated video games and they were the work of the devil.
2052920	2057280	So this is, this is I'm stereotyping broadly, obviously, but this is just such like a neat
2057280	2060280	change is that like, everybody's really getting into this game.
2060280	2064580	I saw, I saw a Vietnam vet, he was, he was decorated with his jacket or these Vietnam
2064580	2066860	vet there with his, I assume wife.
2066860	2069080	And they were there playing the game, sitting on a bench.
2069080	2073720	And the, the stock was like, you know, honestly that like, I've totally gotten out of Ingress,
2073720	2078980	um, you know, occasionally I'll check to see if my, you know, MEFGs are full and they'll
2078980	2079980	empty that stuff out.
2079980	2087740	But like, I've totally gotten out of Ingress and, um, I mean, I casually play Pokemon go.
2087740	2090860	It's just kind of something that just kill time, I guess.
2090860	2093060	Um, I don't know.
2093060	2094620	It was just, it was just something to do.
2094620	2095940	I didn't really have any plans yesterday.
2095940	2099180	It was nice that I'd be able to go outside and all that stuff.
2099180	2101940	Ingress stressed me out too much is what it was.
2101940	2104180	The PVP element is, can be rough.
2104180	2108460	Pokemon is not, I mean, they, there's the gyms, but you don't, the gyms are so useless.
2108460	2109460	It's pointless.
2109940	2110940	I don't do that anymore.
2110940	2112620	It's, there's just no point to them.
2112620	2113620	Yeah.
2113620	2114620	You can ignore them if you want completely.
2114620	2115620	So.
2115620	2116620	All right.
2116620	2119220	Uh, well let me talk about my gaming week as well.
2119220	2123060	So obviously I talked a little bit about Pokemon go, although I, I want to, uh, note in our
2123060	2128180	chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, actdeftinchat makes the good old Pokemon go is dead, but
2128180	2131020	in quotes he's, he's being sarcastic, lol no.
2131020	2132060	Um, yeah.
2132060	2135380	You know, every time I see one of those Pokemon go is dead articles, I'm like, just because
2135380	2138200	you're not playing it doesn't mean other people aren't playing it.
2138200	2142880	And what's happening that I'm seeing now is that it's not really the same gamers that
2142880	2146360	were playing it at first that are playing it now.
2146360	2151000	And it's, it's a very different set of gamers, at least from what I observed at the lake
2151000	2152000	yesterday.
2152000	2155120	You know, it is like a totally different demographic.
2155120	2159260	And I think that's awesome that, you know, more people are playing games because of something
2159260	2160260	like Pokemon go.
2160260	2163380	That's just a different type of game that gets you out in the real world doing different
2163380	2164380	stuff.
2164380	2165380	Yeah.
2165380	2167800	And Bobby Blackpool says, yes, it does mean that if I'm not playing it, it's dead.
2167800	2172600	Swear to God, the next time I see an article on one of those websites, I'm coming for him.
2172600	2173600	Listen up Forbes.
2173600	2178200	It's just, it's not as prevalent as when, you know, first came out, everyone just gathered
2178200	2181120	around the park and it's like, holy crap, what are all these people doing out there?
2181120	2182120	Now it's just died down.
2182120	2183120	But it's still a thing.
2183120	2184120	I mean, yeah.
2184120	2188500	Cameron Park Lake would have been swarmed a couple months ago when that game was new.
2188500	2193080	Now it was just like, oh, there's a, there's a handful of people here, but that's still
2193080	2194260	better than nothing.
2194260	2197040	That's more people, Cameron Park Lake than they would normally get.
2197280	2200440	Especially when they charge, well, they were charging yesterday cause I think they forecasted
2200440	2204120	rain yesterday, but when they usually charge people to get in there, that goes, that money
2204120	2206280	goes back into the local economy.
2206280	2208560	Like that's an awesome thing.
2208560	2209560	I think.
2209560	2210560	I don't know.
2210560	2211560	But anyway, haters gonna hate.
2211560	2212900	Uh, other games I've played.
2212900	2216840	So I'm embarrassed to say this, but I can't, I can't stop fucking playing Clicker Heroes
2216840	2217840	on PlayStation four.
2217840	2219360	Oh, that was the other game I played.
2219360	2220360	Yes.
2220360	2221360	I did play a little bit of Clicker Heroes.
2221360	2223080	I have seen you on there quite a bit.
2223080	2224080	I'm embarrassed.
2224080	2225080	Well, cause I leave it.
2225120	2226120	Okay.
2226120	2228960	Just because you see me on Clicker Hills on PS4, it doesn't mean I'm sitting there clicking.
2228960	2233080	I leave it running while I'm like doing stuff around the house or even in the back office
2233080	2234080	on my computer.
2234080	2236400	And then I'll go in, upgrade some heroes and go back.
2236400	2239840	Like it is literally the game that just kind of runs in the background all day.
2239840	2240840	Yeah.
2240840	2244060	So, but I'm even embarrassed that I play it that much, but what can I say?
2244060	2245060	It's something that I've been doing.
2245060	2246060	All right.
2246060	2247060	How about some other games?
2247060	2250680	I've been playing Overwatch a little bit again because there's a new event going on in Overwatch
2250680	2253040	called Overwatch Uprising.
2253040	2257640	And the awesome thing about it is that they brought in another PvE event, which is what
2257640	2258980	they did for Halloween.
2258980	2260360	They did the Junkenstein's Revenge.
2260360	2261960	They have something very similar to that.
2261960	2265440	And I can't even remember the name of the mode now, but they have two versions of it.
2265440	2270200	And one of them, you're limited to the quote unquote older Overwatch characters.
2270200	2278000	So it's like Reinhardt, Mercy, Tracer, and Torbjorn are in this.
2278000	2282560	And they're like, it's kind of like a prequel to where Overwatch comes from basically.
2282600	2284640	And you're playing through this PvE mode.
2284640	2289360	So you could do it with that setup or they did it so you can just do any hero you want
2289360	2290860	in another version of it.
2290860	2293960	And so they're encouraging people to play it with loot boxes and so forth.
2293960	2297760	And the more I play it, I'm like, this is more fun right now for me than playing the
2297760	2301460	game itself, because I don't get stressed out because more PvE.
2301460	2305800	It feels like what I enjoy about Mass Effect multiplayer online is that it's more collaborative,
2305800	2307520	that whole Horde mode stuff.
2307520	2309680	Like it's a mode like that in Overwatch.
2309680	2313920	The only place I could be critical of it is that it's kind of the same mode over and
2313920	2314920	over again.
2314920	2318920	So if you want to get your nine loot boxes for the week by doing this mode, it's going
2318920	2321800	to get a little stale because you're kind of doing the same thing over and over.
2321800	2326240	But I really hope if Blizzard is looking at where do we go from here with Overwatch, with
2326240	2332160	an Overwatch 2.0 or an Overwatch Next or whatever, I really hope they flesh out more PvE modes
2332160	2334420	because they're a hell of a lot of fun.
2334420	2338760	And I think if there could be more diversity in it, that would be the game for me.
2338760	2340000	And I'd probably play it even more.
2340000	2343520	Well, that reminds me almost like they just have the trailer for Star Wars Battlefront
2343520	2344520	2 this week.
2344520	2348840	So yeah, Battlefront 1, I mean, I liked Battlefront.
2348840	2353900	I just didn't want to play that because it's all online multiplayer and I would love a
2353900	2355220	single player campaign.
2355220	2360200	Now they showed like the single player campaign story trailer for it and I was like, I'm totally
2360200	2363680	on board for that because that looks really interesting.
2363680	2367920	And I mean that I'll probably pick up that game versus not having a single player campaign
2367920	2370020	and not picking it up, you know, the first game.
2370020	2373360	And then the fact they talked about they're not doing a season pass this time either.
2373360	2375360	That's bold from EA.
2375360	2379040	Yeah, loot box or some bullshit.
2379040	2380240	This is EA we're talking about.
2380240	2383280	I'm not gonna, all of a sudden they saw the light and decided, oh, we're not gonna be
2383280	2385160	dicks this time.
2385160	2388080	I think we have a story coming up on that later, so we'll save it for that.
2388080	2389080	Just a couple more here.
2389080	2392160	Drawn to Death, I checked out on PlayStation 4.
2392160	2394280	That's on PlayStation Plus right now, so it's out for free.
2394280	2396080	What a foul-mouthed little game.
2396080	2397520	What a foul-mouthed little game.
2397840	2401200	The whole time I was playing it, I was like, Loki would love this.
2401200	2404880	Just in the tutorial, there's a little thing that's like, press this to use your gun.
2404880	2407160	And it goes, now shoot me in the fucking mouth.
2407160	2409400	And I was like, what a nasty little game.
2409400	2412640	And it taunts you the whole time you're playing it and all this stuff.
2412640	2415600	Well, it's supposed to be in some kid's notebook or something like that.
2415600	2417880	It's like they let Twitter create a game.
2417880	2418880	But it's fun.
2418880	2419880	It's fun.
2419880	2422740	And then lastly, but certainly not leastly, the other game I've been playing a little
2422740	2424200	bit of this week.
2424200	2429520	For the third time I've purchased this game, no, it's not Mass Effect, Bayonetta came out
2429520	2430520	on PC.
2430520	2431520	Yes.
2431520	2434460	Bayonetta is so awesome.
2434460	2436240	And yeah, they released it on Steam.
2436240	2438940	That whole countdown clock from a couple weeks ago ran up.
2438940	2441620	And of course, that's the big PC release of Bayonetta.
2441620	2445920	And so now you can run it in 4K, even though my monitor doesn't really do that.
2445920	2450960	But I mean, it looks great just even in the, what, 19, 20, 1080 or whatever your monitor
2450960	2451960	does by default.
2451960	2456500	It looks very crisp, very great frame rate I'm getting on my computer.
2456500	2460220	The one thing I noticed that I was a little like, eh, is that the audio syncing is off
2460220	2461220	in some parts.
2461220	2465920	And probably this enhanced graphics is probably not letting itself well to that and it's probably
2465920	2467800	throwing some of it off.
2467800	2469480	But the game itself runs great.
2469480	2472880	And it's just fun to be playing that game again, even if it is seven years old.
2472880	2477780	But I hope it does well so that they'll either release Bayonetta 2 on PC, although we all
2477780	2481560	know Nintendo had a hand in that, so you can't really, you know, as much as the fans
2481560	2483980	want that to happen, it probably just won't.
2483980	2487620	But what would be even better is a Bayonetta 3 gets announced.
2487620	2489720	That would be the best.
2489720	2492700	So here's hoping that that does well on PC.
2492700	2495300	If you've never played Bayonetta before, now's the time.
2495300	2496300	It's only what?
2496300	2497300	I think it's only 20 bucks.
2497300	2498300	20 bucks, yeah.
2498300	2499300	Right now.
2499300	2500300	Yeah.
2500300	2501300	So there it is.
2501300	2502300	All right.
2502300	2503300	Let's see.
2503300	2504300	Let's check it.
2504300	2505300	Let's check it with our guests and your gaming ways.
2505300	2506300	What types of video games have you been playing this week?
2506820	2509580	I imagine you've probably been busy with your own game, but has there been anything else
2509580	2511580	you've been playing, Andrew?
2511580	2512580	No.
2512580	2513580	Seriously, no.
2513580	2517500	I don't have time to do much except for work on the game and test the game over and over
2517500	2518500	and over again.
2518500	2521780	So I'm really looking forward to the next one, but I haven't really had time to play
2521780	2522780	games.
2522780	2523780	That's fair.
2523780	2524780	You guys did just release the game.
2524780	2530780	But how long do you think that will go on for before you finally are like, okay, done.
2530780	2532120	And I'm just going to let it go.
2532120	2537660	For me, I think maybe two months, maybe two or three months, because we have so much to
2537660	2538660	work on.
2538660	2543800	But after that, I think we'll have time to just take a little break, play games and start
2543800	2545440	thinking about the next thing.
2545440	2549840	I just want to point out Blizzard patched Diablo II 11 years after the fact.
2549840	2550840	So don't do that.
2550840	2551840	Don't do that.
2551840	2552840	All right.
2552840	2554720	Tony, what about you?
2554720	2555720	Similar story.
2555720	2559360	I didn't have too much time, but I had to make a little bit of time with Yooka-Laylee.
2559360	2561360	Oh, yeah.
2561600	2563320	I backed that one on Kickstarter.
2563320	2565120	It's the first game I ever backed on there.
2565120	2571240	It finally came out and I only played it for about an hour, but it feels like it's delivered
2571240	2572640	what it was out to do.
2572640	2576620	You know, just kind of like a banjo style 64 platformer in it.
2576620	2579200	Super colorful, super fun.
2579200	2581960	I'm really looking forward to getting into the rest of it.
2581960	2582960	Awesome.
2582960	2588680	Yeah, I've heard the reviews on Yooka-Laylee are kind of mixed, but the people that are
2588680	2591420	like actually playing it are really enjoying it.
2591420	2594900	So it's like one of those things where it seems like it's for the fans and maybe reviewers
2594900	2595900	don't get it.
2595900	2596900	There's a lot of movies like that.
2596900	2600800	Well, yeah, I think some of the gripes who are just like maybe because it's borrowing
2600800	2605520	so much from that genre of games that some of the downfalls of those genre of games,
2605520	2608160	they're not really tweaking the fix it or improve it.
2608160	2610600	So I don't know.
2610600	2612520	I think that's, I think you're right.
2612520	2617040	It's that they, it's, it plays a lot like a 64 game for better or worse, you know?
2617040	2618040	Yeah.
2618400	2619400	I don't know.
2619400	2620400	Whatever.
2620400	2621400	People like it.
2621400	2626240	So at least it's not Mighty No. 9, so there's that going for it.
2626240	2628960	All right.
2628960	2632120	Let's get into, we need to get into some gaming news already here.
2632120	2635520	We've been talking a lot about our gaming weeks and of course a little tanks here, but
2635520	2638560	I know there's been a lot of stuff that's happened in gaming this week, so let's get
2638560	2639560	into it.
2639560	2641880	First, of course, the quick plugs for our social media.
2641880	2646920	We are on Twitter, twitter.com slash O L R and Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge
2646920	2647920	radio.
2647920	2650200	Meanwhile, Loki wants you to start us off.
2650200	2651200	All right.
2651200	2655840	So they finally announced the specs of Project Scorpio.
2655840	2660880	So they're going to talk more about it during E3, but already it's looking like it's more
2660880	2664080	powerful than the PlayStation 4 Pro.
2664080	2668800	And they're doing some really interesting things with the whole architecture of it.
2668800	2674240	So what's kind of unique to it from what I've seen is that they're building in some
2674240	2678360	of the DirectX 12 calls and everything into the actual hardware.
2678360	2681640	So it's all running hardware based instead of actually software.
2681640	2686480	So they're able to improve performance using that as well as the fact that, you know, the
2686480	2691880	clock speeds higher, it's got more RAM, it's got more, you know, a powerful, more powerful
2691880	2692880	GPU.
2692880	2697260	Pretty much everything is outspecking the PlayStation 4 Pro.
2697300	2704140	And then they also kind of invited, what was it, they invited Digital Foundry to come take
2704140	2708700	a look at it because they do a lot of those comparison videos between different systems
2708700	2709700	and stuff.
2709700	2716860	And so he was shown, Richard Ledbetter was shown, I guess, for some motorsports running
2716860	2727640	a native 4K and then it was running at 60 frames per second in 4K with not even topping
2727640	2733180	out the full hardware, it was basically about 75 to 80 percent of the processing power of
2733180	2734180	that system.
2734180	2735860	And that's pretty amazing.
2735860	2740540	Just that ability to be able to push that kind of power.
2740540	2745260	I mean, I'm interested to see what, I think that might actually sell me on it.
2745260	2748860	I mean, it just sounds like it's going to be that much better performance wise.
2748860	2753380	I'm having a hard time understanding, and I know this sounds like hypocritical because
2753380	2756660	I own a PlayStation 4 Pro, but I actually, here's the thing, I actually kind of regret
2756660	2757660	that purchase in retrospect.
2757660	2760500	I don't think I should have bought the Pro.
2760500	2763780	But if I had a 4K television, I'd probably get more out of it.
2763780	2768380	But without it, I'm not getting any, I'm getting the most minor of frame rate increases.
2768380	2773300	So I mean, honestly, what's the big deal about the Scorpio and the specs?
2773300	2776140	If I have a high-end gaming PC, does it matter?
2776140	2777140	Well, it matters.
2777140	2781940	Well, I think from what I've seen, gaming PCs, in order to hit 60 frames per second
2781940	2788060	in 4K, you're going to need a really powerful system to do that, like cutting edge everything.
2788060	2794180	And even then, a lot of games aren't going to run natively in 60 frames per second.
2794180	2797040	And the reason for that also, you're going to still have the advantage because these
2797040	2803140	are custom chips that have that DirectX architecture built into them instead of it running as software
2803140	2804140	in the system.
2804140	2805580	And so it's a lot faster in that way.
2805580	2809100	I guess it's weird to me, and I can't separate, this is what's weird to me, is because they
2809100	2812380	keep insisting that Scorpio is not a new ecosystem.
2812380	2813380	It's not the Xbox Two.
2813380	2814380	No, it's not.
2814380	2815380	It's going to play everything from Xbox One.
2815380	2818120	But in my mind, I'm kind of like, well, that doesn't make any sense.
2818120	2823000	Because if I have the Xbox One that already plays it, do I need this fancy pants thing?
2823000	2824620	If it doesn't have its own exclusive games.
2824620	2827380	I think they're just saying that right now.
2827380	2831540	But I think it's going to be backwards compatible, like the 360 is backwards compatible for a
2831540	2833600	lot of the games.
2833600	2835720	This is just going to be more so.
2835720	2839140	But if they want to develop a game that's going to take more advantage of that, they
2839140	2841060	can do that.
2841060	2842060	So we'll see.
2842060	2843420	I mean, they're going to show it off at E3.
2843420	2845820	I'd be very curious about the price.
2845820	2849700	Yeah, that'd be interesting to see as well.
2849700	2857740	And they're saying also with that, that different, I guess, Xbox One titles, they're just going
2857740	2858820	to be able to benefit from it.
2858820	2862820	Just because the fact that there's not really, you don't even really need to tweak your games
2862820	2865140	for it to benefit from the system.
2865140	2870200	It's just more efficient altogether.
2870200	2873820	How long do you think before we have Scorpio exclusive games or whatever?
2873820	2874820	They obviously...
2874820	2878500	Oh, I don't think it's going to be that long, but it's hard to say.
2878500	2879820	It's all about the adoption rate.
2879820	2882860	So if you get a lot of people buying the system, they may be able to go that route.
2882860	2886660	But I don't think they're going to do that until there's enough people on board with
2886660	2887800	that.
2887800	2890980	But it's also going to be the whole PlayStation Pro thing.
2890980	2894980	Because when the Pro first came out, not a lot of the games looked that much better on
2894980	2895980	it.
2895980	2898060	And even still, I don't think a lot of them looked that great.
2898060	2903020	Granted, now that they have that one patch that kind of helps boost those games that
2903020	2908360	don't really have PlayStation 4 Pro features built into them, they kind of give them higher
2908360	2909360	frame rates and stuff.
2909360	2913840	It'll be interesting to see what this does out of the box for Xbox One games, just to
2913840	2919980	see if there's that vast improvement, or how they're going to import higher resolution
2919980	2921800	textures into these games and stuff.
2921800	2925440	Because I would think if you have an older Forza motorsports game, that's going to be
2925440	2930320	one hell of a download to download 4K textures for everything.
2930320	2931320	So there's that.
2931320	2934360	Granted, it has a terabyte hard drive.
2934360	2936520	Phantasm Chat says, Scorpio looks interesting.
2936520	2938000	You guys going to E3?
2938000	2939440	No, Loki and I aren't.
2939440	2940440	Do you guys do that stuff?
2940440	2942200	Do you guys go to E3 and all that?
2942200	2944480	No, we haven't.
2944480	2946560	Have you shown little tanks at any Expos?
2946560	2951040	I know you guys weren't at the SAC Indie Arcade, but any other Expos you guys do or planned
2951040	2952220	us to the game off at?
2952220	2955280	I think we want to try to submit to, was it Indie Arcade?
2955280	2956280	Indiecade, I think.
2956280	2957280	Oh, Indiecade.
2957280	2958280	Okay.
2958280	2959280	Yeah.
2959280	2960280	But nothing yet.
2960280	2961280	Yeah, not yet.
2961280	2962280	Gotcha.
2962280	2963280	All right.
2963280	2964280	Okay.
2964280	2967320	Well, no, sadly we're not going to E3, but I'm assuming we'll hear more about the console.
2967920	2972440	I think we'll hear more about it sitting on our couch, so we will be at the actual convention
2972440	2973440	itself.
2973440	2977640	But anyway, before we get to the next story, which I want to get into, somebody insisted
2977640	2981240	that they call into the show because of the guests that we have on tonight.
2981240	2984120	The person that actually put us all in touch with each other.
2984120	2985120	Hello, call.
2985120	2986120	Are you there?
2986120	2987120	Yes.
2987120	2988120	Is this Hoarthouse?
2988120	2989120	No, no.
2989120	2993200	Hoarthouse is dead and gone and in the cemetery somewhere.
2993200	2995400	Shane fell asleep on the grave somewhere.
2995400	3000400	I have been sitting at my computer for three years waiting for you to call to do the next
3000400	3003240	recording of Hoarthouse.
3003240	3004240	How was your week?
3004240	3007920	I've been sitting here doing nothing and just have jerking off and nothing until now.
3007920	3009360	So this is not Hoarthouse?
3009360	3011160	How was your week in WoW, Grandpa?
3011160	3012800	Oh, my week in WoW?
3012800	3016560	What type of Blizzard rage can I do this week?
3016560	3017560	I uninstall.
3017560	3019880	I can go on for hours, but it's not a Blizzard show, as you would say.
3019880	3021200	All right, all right.
3021200	3025640	So you're the one that introduced us to Lead Money Games, not Lead Money Games, but introduced
3025640	3028040	us to the developers behind Lil' Tanks.
3028040	3029640	So you wanted to call in and say hello tonight?
3029640	3030640	Well, I did.
3030640	3031640	Yeah, I did.
3031640	3034080	I know you're in the middle of gaming news and I appreciate it.
3034080	3039400	I just got back from Easter stuff and wanted to sneak into listening to the show and say
3039400	3040400	a few words, but yes.
3040400	3041400	Anything for you, pumpkin.
3041400	3042400	Oh, thanks, Boo.
3042400	3043400	No, I've known...
3043400	3049240	Unfortunately, I'm not too familiar with his gaming design partner, but I've known Andrew
3049240	3055440	for over 15 years, and everything from call center craziness to his military service to
3055440	3056440	his creative side.
3056440	3062840	And I was very excited to see his indie game pop up and back in on Kickstarter back in
3062840	3065000	the day, and for all your listeners...
3065000	3066560	You've known Matt longer than me?
3066560	3067560	Yeah.
3067560	3068560	You poor bastard.
3068560	3069560	Yeah.
3069560	3075040	The very first time I met Andrew was during call center training.
3075040	3078920	I got sat with him to listen to a few calls, make sure that I was going to run away screaming
3078920	3084400	and when the supervisor's walking me up to him like, damn, that guy is hot, which was
3084400	3085400	a great intro.
3085400	3086400	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
3086400	3087400	I'm married, buddy.
3087400	3088400	Well, now, you weren't then.
3088400	3089400	Back off.
3089400	3090400	You weren't then.
3090400	3094280	And the very first call I listened to, he takes a call and he's going through the routine
3094280	3098320	and this customer's calling and he's like, yeah, my stove caught on fire.
3098320	3099560	It caught my entire kitchen on fire.
3099560	3102880	And the whole time, Andrew's going, okay, sir, absolutely, I'll create a work order
3102880	3103880	for that.
3103880	3104880	Not a problem.
3104880	3107140	I'm thinking, what the fuck am I getting myself into?
3107140	3110300	And 10 years later in that industry, I'm still going.
3110300	3111300	But I wanted to-
3111300	3113500	Yeah, so little tanks available now on Steam.
3113500	3114500	Right.
3114500	3119940	Well, and the best part is I was able to back the game, of course, because I fully support
3119940	3122400	it and I love it and all that.
3122400	3130220	But one of my rewards as his team of developers who's forwarded the game is to design an enemy,
3130220	3131900	a boss.
3131900	3132900	Not a boss, man.
3132900	3133900	Just an enemy.
3133900	3135900	Or enemy or whatever.
3135900	3136900	Close enough.
3136900	3141220	The reason why they call it a boss is because Rob does everything big because he's in charge
3141220	3142520	of everything.
3142520	3148060	And so I've decided when the time's ready and we're ready to sit down for that chat,
3148060	3150740	I'm going to call that enemy Sky.
3150740	3155840	And I don't know whether we can do something like aerial where he drops bombs on things
3155840	3161840	or drops nukes on things or just create a really annoyingly sounding tank or an enemy
3161840	3163780	that doesn't end until you kill it.
3163820	3167500	Basically, both those types of subscriptions are Rob.
3167500	3173620	So I backed this game with the intent, Rob, to design an enemy named after you.
3173620	3175180	This guy has my Twitter handle.
3175180	3176180	Oh, I see.
3176180	3178340	That's why I started rolling my eyes the minute he started talking.
3178340	3180620	I think that's actually the second idea he's giving me.
3180620	3186060	The first idea he said he wanted a penis that flew around and shot ectoplasm out of it.
3186060	3188060	This is a family-friendly game!
3188060	3189060	No, Matt.
3189060	3190060	Can't do it.
3190060	3191060	Sorry, buddy.
3191060	3192060	Exploding unicorns, perhaps?
3192420	3194420	What about on Game Pride Weekend in San Francisco?
3194420	3196420	Can we have a DLC for that?
3196420	3197420	Calm it down.
3197420	3198420	Calm it down.
3198420	3200420	You can be an 11 on Horde House.
3200420	3202420	I need you a 7 or an 8 here.
3202420	3203420	All right.
3203420	3208420	But anyway, I wanted to congratulate the Lead Money Games team and hopefully you have a
3208420	3210420	great show and interview tonight.
3210420	3213420	And if you're listening, of course, please go to Steam, download the game, support them,
3213420	3218420	and in the next little bit hopefully you'll see the enemy Sky raining bombs down on your
3218420	3220420	parade in the near future.
3220780	3227780	So you're legit going to use your money to make me a monster in a video game?
3227780	3233780	There is no end to my willingness and my desire and scope of trolling you, Rob.
3233780	3234780	Fuck you.
3234780	3235780	Anyway, there it is.
3235780	3236780	I hung up on him.
3236780	3237780	All right.
3237780	3240780	Sorry, I was too good.
3240780	3243780	We love Grandpa Matt.
3243780	3245780	Hopefully he hears that part there.
3246140	3251140	Thanks, Grandpa, for spending your hard-earned money to potentially, if it passes quality
3251140	3258140	assurance, immortalize me in a video game as some annoying little son of a bitch that
3258140	3260140	everybody will want to shoot in the face.
3260140	3261140	That's great.
3261140	3262140	That's great.
3262140	3263140	I'm happy to hear that.
3263140	3264140	Happy to hear that.
3264140	3265140	All right.
3265140	3268140	He's in chat screaming now that a bitch hung up on me.
3268140	3269140	But there you go.
3269140	3271140	There you go, folks in chat.
3271500	3274500	SHO 100 Matt says, Grandpa needs to be on more often.
3274500	3276500	JD says this.
3276500	3277500	Let's see.
3277500	3279500	SHO 100 Matt says, we will miss you, Grandpa.
3279500	3281500	Act Def says, Grandpa has his priorities straight.
3281500	3283500	Don't encourage him.
3283500	3285500	Don't encourage him.
3285500	3286500	All right.
3286500	3292500	Even if I have to take a hit there, I'm happy that it was all to help make the game happen
3292500	3293500	in the end.
3293500	3294500	So there you go.
3294500	3295500	Thanks.
3295500	3296500	All right.
3296500	3299500	Let's move on with some more gaming news now that our show has been blessed with Matt's
3299500	3300500	presence.
3300500	3301500	Let's talk about this.
3301500	3303500	This is something everybody's talking about this week.
3303500	3305500	And that's the NES Classic Edition.
3305500	3311500	The NES Classic Edition has had the plug pulled on it somewhat shockingly.
3311500	3316500	Of course, the NES Classic Edition was the kind of must-have Christmas gift this year.
3316500	3320500	It was so must-have that it was selling out instantly at stores everywhere.
3320500	3322500	Scalpers are selling it up for...
3322500	3323500	Oh, yeah.
3323500	3324500	It's only up to $300 now.
3324500	3328500	Oh, I'm sure this news just put the prices through the roof even more so.
3328500	3329500	So here's the deal.
3329500	3331500	Here's the official quote from Nintendo.
3331500	3335500	Throughout April, NOA territories will receive the last shipments of Nintendo Entertainment
3335500	3338500	System NES Classic Edition systems for this year.
3338500	3342500	We encourage anyone interested in obtaining the system to check with retail outlets regarding
3342500	3343500	availability.
3343500	3346500	We understand that it has been difficult for many consumers to find a system.
3346500	3347500	And for that, we apologize.
3347500	3351500	We have paid close attention to consumer feedback, and we greatly appreciate the incredible level
3351500	3353500	of consumer interest and support for this product.
3353500	3357500	So in other words, Nintendo is trying to say this was the plan all along.
3357500	3361500	Was that this thing was never supposed to be this popular.
3361500	3364500	So we're ending it because it's supposed to not be popular.
3364500	3369500	If I were a shareholder, I would be livid right now.
3369500	3376500	Especially since Mario Run did not meet the same expectation levels Nintendo was hoping for.
3376500	3378500	I realize the Switch is doing very well.
3378500	3379500	We'll get into that later.
3379500	3386500	But still, I mean, I know I'm usually one to counter Loki and come to Nintendo's defense here on the show.
3386500	3388500	I'm not saving y'all this week.
3388500	3389500	Nintendo deserves it.
3389500	3391500	I don't I don't I don't get this.
3391500	3392500	I don't think it was.
3392500	3394500	I don't think it would be that expensive.
3394500	3395500	The manufacturer either.
3395500	3399500	I would think that they have a pretty high margin built in that thing.
3399500	3401500	I just I don't get it.
3401500	3406500	I think it's stupid and have the PR thing come out and say, oh, we we appreciate your feedback.
3406500	3409500	It's just like, yeah, we heard you, but whatever.
3409500	3410500	We don't fucking care.
3410500	3412500	We'll do whatever we want.
3412500	3418500	And this is just going to make it worse when they have another like, say, let's say an SNES mini comes out.
3418500	3425500	It's going to be fucking impossible to get one because scalpers are like, dude, I made three hundred dollars on that sixty dollar system.
3425500	3427500	I'm buying the shit out of that.
3427500	3429500	And it'll be it's just going to get worse.
3429500	3431500	And I think that's kind of what they want.
3431500	3439500	They want people to be just like just mad crazy about buying their stuff so that you like amiibos or something like that.
3439500	3445500	Oh, we'll just get people to think they're going to be rare and then they're going to try to flip them.
3445500	3447500	I don't know. It's just it's stupid.
3447500	3449500	They don't make any sense.
3449500	3453500	Act deft and chat over at live dot vog network dot com says, yeah, not even us.
3453500	3455500	Nintendo fans can apologize this.
3455500	3456500	Let's see.
3456500	3459500	Dark Tetsuya says, I heard people speculating Nintendo was pissed.
3459500	3462500	People were hacking these things, installing other ROMs on there too bad.
3462500	3464500	That was that was me on Twitter, actually.
3464500	3466500	What was probably one of those people.
3466500	3468500	I really think that's what this boils down to.
3468500	3477500	I really, really think the reason why Nintendo pulled the plug on this and this is what makes it frustrating is I feel like Nintendo is like blatantly lying on this.
3477500	3479500	I really do.
3479500	3487500	You know, I understand they can't come out and say, well, due to hacking and exploiting, which is very easy to do on this system, I understand they can't.
3487500	3489500	You can't tell me that they didn't have manufacturing problems.
3489500	3494500	They can't figure out how to manufacture the system in quantities that can meet the demand.
3494500	3497500	That is nonsense.
3497500	3503500	I think and I know there's a lot of rumors out there that say, oh, well, they're pulling this in favor of doing a 2.0.
3503500	3504500	No, no, no, no, no, no.
3504500	3508500	You don't pull this off shelves six months before you release the 2.0.
3508500	3511500	Go to the Apple playbook to see how that looks.
3511500	3513500	And not even six months since it's been released.
3513500	3519500	They will happily sell you an iPhone 6 full price the day before they release iPhone 7.
3519500	3521500	That's not a read on Apple.
3521500	3522500	Every tech company does this.
3522500	3527500	So Nintendo should have been selling those NES Classics right up until they're ready to debut the NES Classic 2.
3527500	3530500	I fully believe there will be an NES Classic 2.
3530500	3533500	It'll have more games to sweeten the pot, but it's going to be online.
3533500	3537500	It's going to be online because, A, they'll want to be able to sell you more games.
3537500	3540500	Because everybody was sitting here going, why didn't they do that the first time?
3540500	3542500	So, A, it's to sell you more games.
3542500	3546500	Yes, I realize this could be counterproductive with the Switch Virtual Console.
3546500	3547500	But who cares?
3547500	3551500	If people are willing to spend the money and buy it, Nintendo's happily going to sell it to you twice.
3551500	3554500	Look at the 3DS and the Wii U. They'll sell it to you twice.
3554500	3556500	I don't have a problem with the Virtual Console stuff being on there.
3556500	3560500	I just think the price points that they have the Virtual Console games for are way too high.
3560500	3562500	Well, there's many people out there that'll still pay them.
3562500	3566500	Exactly, and that's why they're going to do this bullshit because people keep buying this crap.
3566500	3567500	But here's the thing.
3567500	3571500	It's not only that it's going to be online to sell you the games, but more importantly,
3571500	3575500	so that they can upgrade the firmware on a regular basis to stay on top of the hackers.
3575500	3577500	I see you rolling your eyes already, Loki.
3577500	3578500	No, they're never going to sell.
3578500	3580500	It's based off a Linux PC.
3580500	3583500	It's a Linux system on a chip.
3583500	3586500	There's no way you're going to be able to patch.
3586500	3589500	There's no amount of patching you can do to this thing.
3589500	3591500	They are going to eliminate people.
3591500	3594500	They're never going to stop it, but they're going to make it a lot harder than it is now.
3594500	3595500	Fine, I'll give you that.
3595500	3596500	Alright.
3596500	3597500	What do you guys think?
3597500	3601500	Have you been following this NES Classic or anything?
3601500	3602500	You guys had interest in it?
3602500	3605500	Yeah, I really wanted one when they first came out, but it was really difficult.
3605500	3606500	Yeah, I still don't have one.
3606500	3608500	It looks like it's never going to happen.
3608500	3609500	Yeah, well good news. You're never getting one.
3609500	3611500	But neither am I, so hey, we're on the same boat.
3611500	3612500	We're on the same boat.
3612500	3617500	But why do you think Nintendo would pull the plug on something so successful?
3617500	3619500	It doesn't make much sense to me.
3619500	3625500	I don't really, but it seems like a lot of things Nintendo does doesn't really make a lot of sense,
3625500	3630500	but they find a way to make things a success, so I don't know.
3630500	3632500	I'm not sure what they're doing.
3632500	3635500	Same thing, when they came out, I was interested in getting one.
3635500	3641500	I mean, I still have a working NES at home now, so I guess it wasn't a necessity, but it seemed like a cool idea,
3641500	3643500	so I don't get it.
3643500	3650500	But I refuse to pay hundreds on top of whatever the initial thing is. I won't do it.
3650500	3653500	Well, here's an interesting little side note, by the way.
3653500	3656500	You may or may not know, there's also a Famicom mini.
3656500	3658500	That's what they were selling over in Japan.
3658500	3661500	Obviously, Nintendo was the family computer or Famicom over there.
3661500	3666500	Here's the interesting thing. Nintendo also suspended production of the Famicom,
3666500	3668500	so if you thought you were going to get around it with one of these, sorry.
3668500	3671500	And the games that are in it are different, too.
3671500	3674500	I think like 10 of the games are different, 20 are the same.
3674500	3680500	But anyway, they're ending production in Japan as well, but they're saying temporary right now.
3680500	3683500	They're not saying forever.
3683500	3689500	So that, to me, though, is what really is leaving the door open for a version 2.0.
3689500	3695500	I think they're saying temporary in Japan because to be replaced with 2.0 later in the year,
3695500	3699500	whatever they end up calling the next version of the NES Classic.
3699500	3703500	I think that's just a given. We'll see.
3703500	3706500	Let's see. Over in chat, over at live.vognetwork.com,
3706500	3708500	Dart Tetsuya in chat says,
3708500	3712500	I wonder if the Classic 2 would be modeled after the newer NES.
3712500	3715500	And Brad from Pod Culture says the top loader, that would be hilarious.
3716500	3719500	Actually, that's a pretty clever thing that Nintendo could do,
3719500	3723500	is put out a top loader Classic NES that's their version 2.0.
3723500	3725500	I actually think that's a cute idea.
3725500	3729500	Or, here's my other cute idea, put the whole thing inside of Rob the Robot.
3729500	3731500	Hmm? Wouldn't that be cute?
3731500	3734500	Yeah, they could do something like that. We'll see. Anyway.
3734500	3737500	Or how about you just manufacture more units of the system you already have?
3737500	3739500	Yeah, right. That could be.
3739500	3743500	Maybe they're realigning those resources to make more switches?
3744500	3748500	Logically, that doesn't make sense to me, but I guess I should throw that out there.
3748500	3752500	They're not manufacturing. I mean, how many did they actually sell of this,
3752500	3756500	is what I'd be interested to find out, because they didn't manufacture that much.
3756500	3759500	It may be a few hundred thousand units, if that.
3759500	3762500	I don't even think it was probably that.
3764500	3766500	I don't see that many being sold.
3766500	3770500	And you can't tell me that, oh, well, they would be making switches,
3770500	3773500	but they have to make these stupid NES classic minis. Come on.
3773500	3779500	I mean, it's so hardware-wise, it's so minimal versus what's in a Switch.
3779500	3782500	I don't even think you can compare them.
3782500	3786500	All right, well, let's move on. Some more fun Nintendo news, right, Logie?
3786500	3788500	Yes, because this is where their priority is.
3788500	3791500	Their priority is selling you fucking amiibos, and that's what they're going to be doing.
3791500	3795500	So they announced during their stupid Nintendo Direct that, hey, guess what?
3795500	3798500	More amiibos for that game that came out over a year ago.
3798500	3801500	Super Smash Brothers for 3DS and Wii U.
3801500	3810500	They're going to be coming out with the cloud, Bayonetta, and some chick from Fire Emblem, Corrin.
3810500	3817500	But, hey, in typical Nintendo fashion, you know you want those.
3817500	3820500	Guess what? There's going to be some exclusive versions.
3820500	3824500	And guess what? We teamed up with the best fucking retailer on the face of the earth.
3824500	3827500	GameStop. Oh, baby GameStop.
3828500	3830500	That's right. If you want to get...
3830500	3833500	I swear to God, if the Bayonetta thing is exclusive to GameStop, I'm going to lose my shit.
3833500	3839500	If you want to get a special cloud with a Cloud Player 2, they said, or a Twilight Princess Link,
3839500	3843500	those are both GameStop exclusive. You cannot pick them up anywhere else.
3843500	3850500	And then, what else? Oh, I should mention also they're announcing that they had other, like, Skyward Sword stuff.
3850500	3856500	So Amazon is going to be, I guess, pre-ordering stuff as well.
3856500	3860500	I want to say they have, like, who else are going to be exclusive here?
3862500	3865500	But yeah, they basically have alternate versions of the different characters.
3865500	3871500	Alright, this I will counterpoint you on, though, is because I still think the amiibos make neat little figures,
3871500	3873500	and I want the Bayonetta ones for sure.
3873500	3877500	The Corrin ones, I'm not as tied to that series, so I'm going to give or take on that.
3877500	3881500	Cloud would be cool, but I'm not going to fight people at GameStop for the alternative.
3881500	3883500	So it's kind of one of those, if I find one, cool.
3883500	3886500	But the Bayonetta ones, I will fight people for, so bring it.
3886500	3891500	However, I don't appreciate that you call that Nintendo Direct stupid,
3891500	3896500	because they announced that they're localizing Coldsept in that little Nintendo Direct.
3896500	3900500	It was a blink-and-you-miss-it type of thing, but if you've never played Coldsept before, that's awesome.
3900500	3905500	An awesome little game, a little hybrid of, like, Monopoly meets Magic the Gathering.
3905500	3908500	So yeah, that Nintendo Direct was not stupid, Loki. You take it back.
3908500	3912500	Skyward Sword Link and Corrin Player 2 version, which is stupid.
3912500	3917500	Those are both Amazon exclusives, so if you want to get those, you better order those on Amazon.
3917500	3921500	But yeah, I mean, what they had, were they announcing, was it...
3923500	3927500	Didn't they have, like, more Wii? Oh, that's right, that's right.
3927500	3930500	They announced that fucking Rayman was coming to the Switch,
3930500	3934500	because that launch game from the Wii U, or was it even the Wii?
3934500	3937500	I can't remember at this point. I think it was the Wii U.
3937500	3941500	That really needs to be on the Switch. That's the system seller right there.
3941500	3943500	Not to say it's a bad game, but dude, that game is old.
3943500	3949500	Yeah, I mean, it's cool that I guess they're probably trying to add some new coats of paint on it to make it a little more attractive.
3949500	3950500	No, they really aren't.
3950500	3953500	It's portable now? That's...
3953500	3955500	It was portable on the Vita.
3955500	3958500	Oh, I didn't even know it was on the Vita. Oh, Sony's still making the Vita?
3958500	3962500	Yeah, they are. Some companies know who they are.
3962500	3963500	Who's in Japan.
3963500	3968500	ActDeftInChat says, Rayman Legends is good, though. Really good. And nobody owns a Vita, Loki.
3968500	3970500	They do in Japan.
3970500	3972500	I have a PlayStation TV that's somewhere.
3972500	3975500	Do you see the thick layer of dust on my Vita, by the way?
3975500	3977500	It's in the other room, but it's...
3977500	3978500	Several Vitas that you own?
3978500	3980500	Yeah, that's right. I have two.
3980500	3985500	But the other one is more for collector purposes, because it's a Final Fantasy XIV Vita, and it's pretty sweet.
3985500	3986500	Just saying.
3986500	3988500	Well, your attach rate's fantastic, then, for Vita's system.
3988500	3989500	I know, right?
3989500	3992500	Well, the other one's from Japan, so it doesn't really count, because they actually sell Vitas in Japan.
3992500	3997500	Yeah, well, the one in the US doesn't really count, because they disavow all knowledge of the Vita.
3997500	4004500	Alright. Moving on. Let's talk about Splatoon 2. Splatoon 2 is actually dated now for release.
4004500	4008500	They talked about that in the Nintendo Direct, and Splatoon 2 looks awesome. I don't care what Loki says.
4008500	4011500	July 21st is the big day for Splatoon 2.
4011500	4015500	They actually were showing a little bit more on the Nintendo Direct of this.
4015500	4017500	They were showing a new game mode called Salmon Run.
4017500	4023500	It's a co-op mode, that's pretty cool, for players against enemy creatures that spread pollution.
4023500	4030500	So, yet again, another example of that horde mode, a la Mass Effect, a la what I was just talking about with Overwatch.
4030500	4031500	Gears of War.
4031500	4034500	Gears of War, obviously, making its way into Splatoon as well.
4034500	4038500	That sounds really exciting, actually. I'm really into the co-op stuff.
4038500	4046500	So, I think more and more developers are finding out that people really enjoy the co-op multiplayer when they can't get into the competitive multiplayer.
4046500	4052500	The other thing I forgot to mention, they have new colored Joy-Cons, so you can get a neon yellow one.
4052500	4057500	If you really want neon yellow controllers, just remember they're $80. Thanks, Nintendo.
4057500	4063500	And I think that is to celebrate ARMS, which they also showed off in the Nintendo Direct, and they dated that.
4063500	4072500	June 16th is the date for ARMS, and they were showing how, you know, with the characters you can kind of, you actually sub in and out the different ARMS, so there's all these different combinations.
4072500	4073500	It's neat.
4073500	4079500	I gotta be honest, I'm not feeling this the way a lot of my Nintendo fan friends are. I'm not feeling it.
4079500	4083500	They're really pushing to make it esports. It's not esports. I'm sorry.
4083500	4095500	Well, we'll see. I mean, I don't know. That's for the internet to decide. I'm not feeling this based off the trailers and all that, but I feel like, okay, Rob, you need to give it a chance and play it, but I'll need to play it at somebody else's house.
4095500	4096500	But it's four player now.
4096500	4101500	That part's cool, too. You know, again, leave it to Nintendo to bring the party modes in.
4102500	4109500	I know we joked earlier about porting little tanks to the Switch, and obviously that's a money thing, but do you guys actually own Nintendo Switch? Have you played on that at all?
4109500	4110500	No, no, I wish.
4110500	4118500	I don't own it. I played it a handful of times. Just played Zelda and then, what's it, the Isaac Rebirth.
4118500	4119500	Yeah, Binding of Isaac, yeah.
4119500	4127500	Yeah, pretty fun. I mean, I think right now, for me, I would need to see a few more games before I'd go out and get it, but it looks cool.
4128500	4136500	Yeah, I'd have to check out Arms. I'm remaining open to the idea, but I'm just like, right now, I'm not feeling it.
4136500	4144500	Just a quick recommendation. Please, my God, don't make that thing be the mascot. The announcer with the hand.
4144500	4145500	Oh, the little announcer. We'll say Bill.
4145500	4148500	That was fucking annoying. Please get rid of that thing.
4148500	4149500	I think that's a thing your kids would like.
4149500	4153500	No, they do like annoying things, but my God, that's annoying.
4154500	4161500	Dude, there is some weird shit on fucking YouTube. Like, my kids watch, well, my youngest one, he watches the YouTube Kids app.
4161500	4171500	That is, that goes down some deep rabbit holes of like, what the fuck kind of content are people making out there?
4171500	4184500	It's just full of like, those lucky eggs and just all sorts of licensing ripoffs and just nursery rhyme music mashed together and some orgy of what the fuck is that?
4184500	4192500	And like, I asked him, I'm like, what the hell is going on right there? Like, what are you watching?
4192500	4196500	I worry more about that kind of crap than the actual Minecraft.
4196500	4200500	Okay, but I'm sure my mom looked at me watching You Can't Do That on television.
4200500	4201500	No.
4201500	4202500	When I was younger and was like, what the fuck?
4202500	4211500	No, this is content specifically targeted towards kids. And because they know that people like, it's because people like watching unboxing videos.
4211500	4216500	And because people like watching unboxing videos, they have these stupid lucky eggs, which are basically things you can buy in the store.
4216500	4222500	Like, you can, and they're random and you open it up and they're like, oh, crap, I got Elsa or some shit.
4222500	4225500	And people fucking watch hours of that shit.
4226500	4231500	What the hell? You are not the only person to tell me that this week. The kids love unboxing videos on YouTube.
4231500	4240500	And it's even worse than that because this thing was a simulated lucky egg. It was a fucking, all of it was goddamn animated, like with Spider-Man and fucking Elsa and shit.
4240500	4247500	I'm like, none of this makes any goddamn sense. Why is this a thing? Like, what is going on here?
4248500	4257500	And then like people talking like, like grown ass adults fucking playing with like toys, like the little kids, like, dude, I know you're a fucking adult.
4257500	4262500	I can see your hands. Those are fucking adult hands. You are not a kid playing the toy. This is creepy now.
4262500	4268500	It's like, what the fuck is going on? Oh, look at this. I'm going to open this egg. Oh, look, it's blue. It's like, oh my God.
4268500	4274500	Okay, but is this just the full realization of your old? Because again, when we were younger, our parents didn't understand.
4274500	4285500	It's creepy shit. You think this is bad. Okay, you go and act this. These are kind of spinoffs of this whole genre of people dressing up in really shitty costumes like Spider-Man and Elsa.
4285500	4293500	There's a whole bunch of Spider-Man Elsa videos out there where people run around, do weird, like almost borderline pornographic, weird, like innuendo shit.
4293500	4295500	Rule 37. Rule 37.
4295500	4304500	It's just it's it's a deep, dark hole that that goes into.
4304500	4310500	Yes, I get the pun.
4310500	4313500	All right, let's move on with another story, Loki.
4313500	4315500	All right.
4316500	4322500	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Andreati with VoGnetwork.com, use the passphrase STEP.
4322500	4324500	So speaking of games coming to the switch.
4324500	4330500	Oh, sorry. Rule 34, not 37. Whatever. You know what Rule 37 is? See Rule 34. There it is.
4330500	4333500	I've thought Rule 34 is more porn. This is just kind of weird shit.
4333500	4336500	Well, okay, but you took it to a pointy place there.
4336500	4343500	It wasn't porn. It's innuendo. It's not porn because it's YouTube. I mean, you can't put porn on YouTube.
4343500	4353500	Anyways, so apparently there's, according to Epic, there's over 20 Japanese Unreal Engine games coming to the switch that are in development.
4353500	4362500	So, yeah, that's pretty awesome. In the course, we don't know which games those are because they didn't mention any fucking titles, but there's at least 20 of them and they're coming to Japan.
4362500	4368500	Well, but at least it shows that, yes, people are interested in developing for the switch. It's it's this is not going to be a repeat.
4368500	4372500	Right. I don't think it's going to. I think there's tons of people developing games for the switch.
4372500	4375500	It's just where are the games? Because they're not out yet.
4375500	4380500	And they probably should wait until more of them are ready to be released before releasing the system.
4380500	4383500	Well, but the system's doing really well.
4383500	4387500	Well, you know what? You know, people will buy a fucking Apple iPhone if it's red.
4387500	4392500	So, I mean, I don't have a really high expectation for people.
4392500	4396500	First off, you can shut up because I'm actually thinking about getting the red iPhone.
4397500	4400500	But because because. No, no, no. Don't you fucking judge me. I'm not finished.
4400500	4408500	Because my other iPhone, like the battery is just like, like it drains so fast and just like I just I have an older phone.
4408500	4411500	I need to get a newer phone. So I'm like, well, the seven red is the newest thing out there.
4411500	4416500	Maybe I'll just get that. I'm really trying to hold off and wait for the eight. I'm really trying to hold off.
4416500	4420500	But it's like I got to go till October. I don't know if I can do it.
4420500	4426500	And then all these when there is a hot shit new iPhone that's out there on the market, all these phone companies are going to get rid of their unlimited plans.
4426500	4428500	Just wait.
4428500	4432500	Well, yeah, I mean, I'm looking to upgrade my phone, but everything is out right now.
4432500	4436500	It's like, well, this is you know, I can get an S8 because I have an S6 right now.
4436500	4441500	And it's like, well, it's sort of better.
4441500	4443500	Yeah, actually, I think Alan's looking at getting one of those.
4443500	4450500	It's like I just like, eh, I don't really care. I want something that's actually like interesting to buy.
4450500	4452500	And none of them are that.
4452500	4459500	All right. Well, as much of a hater as Nintendo or as Loki's trying to be on Nintendo, I only hate because I love.
4459500	4463500	I know. I know. We've talked about this before. Anyway, here's the thing.
4463500	4472500	The Switch is Nintendo's fastest selling console that is confirmed, of course, by Nintendo, that it's their fastest selling console at VAR.
4472500	4478500	It has sold over nine hundred and six thousand units since it's come out.
4478500	4482500	Even with so many systems that are out there and available, the shipments are not meeting demand.
4482500	4484500	Nintendo has acknowledged that.
4484500	4491500	They have also said that on April 27th, they will give an update on this because they have to do the fiscal year earnings release.
4491500	4495500	But if you were thinking the Switch was going to stall or anything, that's not happening.
4495500	4501500	And I think that's probably encouraging more developers to go for the Switch because, yes, that install base is there.
4501500	4509500	And I think that the see that's the thing is I think the reason it's sold so well is because I don't think they're actually they are meeting that demand a little bit better than they are.
4509500	4516500	Say, you know, the Wii or the Wii U or even when there's more of them on shelves to sell, they sell more.
4516500	4522500	Many could have sold, you know, almost a million copies if or, you know, they put out a million copies of it.
4522500	4528500	But I mean, I've actually I actually went to Wal-Mart the other day and they have like four systems sitting there.
4528500	4538500	I thought about it and then I was like, then I looked at the games that are on the shelf and it literally is like half a shelf, one shelf, half of a shelf dedicated to the Switch.
4538500	4541500	I'm like, oh, yeah, that's right. There's no games on the system. I'm not going to buy it.
4541500	4544500	I need to get a 3D printer instead.
4544500	4547500	It's much cheaper than that too.
4547500	4551500	I'll print my own Switch.
4551500	4554500	I don't need your fucking system. I'll make my own.
4554500	4556500	And it'll play all the games.
4556500	4560500	It'll be a horrible amalgamation of like the PlayStation 4.
4560500	4565500	It'll look like one of those like Chinese knockoff systems like the V.
4565500	4569500	That's fine. I have a Chinese knockoff printer, so it's all good.
4569500	4570500	Is it really?
4570500	4573500	It's open source. Most of the printers come from China.
4573500	4581500	OK. All right. One more story for you guys, then we're going to get Dark Soccer on the phone here to do the classic system of the week.
4581500	4583500	All right. So this is kind of cool to throw back here.
4583500	4598500	But yes, they are. I guess the former members of the Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium, or MECC, are looking to develop a new piece of educational software.
4598500	4604500	Now, you may not know who the MECC is, but you probably do know what the Oregon Trail is.
4604500	4607500	So they're coming back to make a new game.
4608500	4614500	And I guess they're planning on raising half a million dollars in funding to go towards that.
4614500	4616500	I wonder what they're going to make their game.
4616500	4619500	Number Munchers Extreme. Let's pray.
4619500	4621500	Because that was also MECC.
4621500	4628500	All those games you played, at least I did in grade school, MECC did all that stuff.
4628500	4630500	Was that like Math Blasters? Was that one of them?
4630500	4632500	I don't know if MECC did Math Blasters, actually.
4632500	4635500	So what they're developing, actually, a little bit more information on this.
4635500	4641500	So what they're developing is a thing called, it's Real Experiences at Life.
4641500	4645500	So R-E-at-L is Real Experiences at Life.
4645500	4652500	And it focuses, I guess they're saying, on STEM studies, including forensics, vehicle traffic flow, and invasive species.
4652500	4655500	That sounds a little bit more detailed than the Oregon Trail.
4655500	4659500	You're going to die of something a lot more complicated than dysentery in this game.
4659500	4661500	An evolved species has murdered you.
4661500	4668500	But yeah, they're saying it's going to be like a web portal, various ways of study, including streaming, classroom elements, and stuff like that.
4668500	4674500	So it sounds more like an educational system versus forging the river.
4674500	4678500	Bring back the traggles or get the fuck out, MECC.
4678500	4683500	Are the traggles going to be your little mascot for this thing? Otherwise, no one car.
4683500	4686500	They should do like the Oregon Trail, but just in modern times.
4686500	4688500	Without zombies, because that's already been done.
4688500	4693500	Let's see, sj100matt in chat says, Odell Lake, like Odell Lake.
4693500	4694500	Let's see.
4694500	4696500	Oh yeah, Odell Lake. I forgot all about that.
4696500	4699500	Dungeon Buster suggests you have died from a brain parasite.
4699500	4704500	And Dark Tetsuya does confirm the blaster games were someone else, at least according to Wikipedia.
4704500	4707500	Well, you know, Wikipedia knows everything, right? So there it is.
4707500	4712500	But it very well could have been an MECC game. I don't even know who made those games.
4712500	4718500	Anyway, speaking of classic games, we are going to get our lovely Jamie Summers,
4718500	4722500	Dark Soccer, here on the line right now to walk us through her regular segment
4722500	4725500	called the Classic System of the Week.
4725500	4726500	Greetings.
4726500	4727500	Hi, how are you?
4727500	4729500	I'm alright.
4729500	4731500	Sorry you couldn't be here.
4731500	4734500	I was just going to say sorry you couldn't be here tonight.
4734500	4736500	Hi, can you hear me okay?
4736500	4738500	Yeah, it's fine now.
4738500	4739500	The joys of live radio, what can I say?
4739500	4743500	Sorry you couldn't be here in studio tonight. I hope everything's okay. Back at home.
4743500	4744500	Yeah.
4744500	4745500	Alright.
4745500	4749500	Yes. Everything's okay. It's just...
4749500	4755500	Well, you're missing a conversation where we're talking with the creators of Lil' Tanks
4755500	4760500	and you could have been talking about blowing shit up with tanks this week, but, you know, I understand.
4760500	4762500	Things happen.
4762500	4763500	Tanks are awesome.
4763500	4764500	They are awesome.
4764500	4766500	Alright, you know what else is awesome is that every week here on the show,
4766500	4772500	DarkSakura takes us on a trip down memory lane with a segment we call the Classic Game of the Week,
4772500	4775500	but new and improved in the year 2017.
4775500	4780500	Once a month, she likes to say, you know what, the games just aren't enough.
4780500	4784500	You need to bow down at this Classic System of the Week.
4784500	4788500	DarkSakura, what is the Classic System of the Month?
4788500	4792500	The Classic System is the MSX.
4792500	4794500	Good choice.
4795500	4802500	Basically, the MSX, it was first released in 1983 by Microsoft.
4802500	4816500	It was marketed initially in Japan by the director of, sorry, the vice president of Microsoft Japan at the time, Kazuhiko Nishii.
4816500	4821500	It was basically meant to just help improve, you know, home computing at the time.
4821500	4824500	It really was popular in Japan.
4824500	4831500	It did spread across some other countries, but there were very few that were sold in the US,
4831500	4838500	and this pretty much was the gaming system to have, well, apart from just being a computer,
4838500	4841500	before the Nintendo came out, or the Famicom,
4841500	4849500	and it is where a lot of series actually began their life, like the Metal Gear series for one thing.
4849500	4853500	It was really well supported by Konami and Hudson.
4853500	4858500	So, people don't really know exactly what MSX stands for.
4858500	4864500	A lot of people think that it's standard for Microsoft Extended, which was the operating system that came with it.
4864500	4871500	It was Microsoft Extended Basic, and there were some that said machines with software exchangeability,
4871500	4874500	or that it was even named after the MS Metal.
4874500	4881500	So, most of the computers in the early 80s were manufactured in Japan.
4881500	4889500	There was the NEC PC-6001 and the PC-8000 series, Fujitsu's FM series,
4889500	4897500	which I had mentioned when talking about the Marty, and Hitachi did them.
4897500	4899500	They were all over the place.
4899500	4905500	And then we also had Panasonic, Canon, Casio, Yamaha, Sanyo were ones all trying to get in it.
4905500	4912500	So, basically the MSX was an attempt to make a single industry standard for home computers.
4912500	4921500	Kind of like how VHS was standard for video, even though Sony really wanted the Betamax to be the thing.
4921500	4927500	So, a lot of different electronic manufacturers really helped promote the MSX.
4927500	4931500	They had Philips, Spectre Video, Goldstar behind them.
4931500	4942500	And the big thing too is that it really was, it had a few things that really took it above some of the other systems.
4942500	4945500	It really was made from off-the-shelf parts.
4945500	4952500	The CPU was a 3.58 MHz Zilog Z80.
4952500	4962500	It had the Texas Instruments graphics chip, 16K of VRAM, which back then, that was pretty awesome.
4962500	4973500	And then there were just so many things that made it supposed to be more affordable and easier to access a computer.
4973500	4979500	They basically, instead of the big crazy competition that we were having over here,
4979500	4987500	like what was going on between the Commodore items and, you know, we had Coleco in the game and a few other things at the time,
4987500	4991500	it basically didn't really have much of a rival there.
4991500	4997500	There were different manufacturers of the MSX computer.
4997500	5003500	Yamaha had been one, Canon did their own.
5003500	5008500	So, it was fairly easy to adopt it and have games that would work on it.
5008500	5012500	So, I'm going to skip past a little bit more of the technical side of it.
5012500	5016500	There were other iterations of the MSX computer that came out over time.
5016500	5029500	They had, the MSX-1 actually had a joystick port, or you could use the arrow keys and spacebar for controlling games.
5029500	5031500	There were things like that.
5032500	5045500	As far as the other versions that came out, there was the MSX in 83, the MSX-2 in 85, MSX-2 Plus in 88, and the MSX Turbo R in 90.
5045500	5051500	After a while though, there were some revivals as well.
5051500	5063500	In 2001, Nishi, the original promoter of the system, brought about this MSX revival around an emulator called the MSX Player.
5063500	5072500	And it is the only official MSX emulator that's out there right now that is maintained by the MSX Association.
5072500	5075500	There were a few other ones out there.
5075500	5081500	It did have releases in other countries, so there's a European version of it.
5081500	5087500	I think it was supposed to have been big, like in some of the South American countries as well.
5087500	5092500	And then, in 2001, there was another revival.
5092500	5102500	There's an MSX kit called GreatBit, G-R-8-B-I-T, that was a DIY computer, and it was licensed by MSX.
5102500	5109500	It's like a $500 kit, and you can put together a working MSX-2 compatible computer.
5109500	5115500	Except that it doesn't have chassis power supply, floppy disks, all the rest of it.
5115500	5119500	Maybe Loki could print one with his new 3D printer.
5119500	5123500	Maybe Loki could print one with his new 3D printer.
5123500	5129500	Possibly, possibly. Really what you're buying is the processing parts of it.
5129500	5133500	At least we could have an MSX in the US, because that's the thing that always blew my mind,
5133500	5137500	is why we never really had it here like we had the other stuff. But anyway, I digress.
5137500	5142500	They tried. It just didn't catch on. They had to deal with Commodore.
5142500	5149500	But there also is another MSX, I don't know that it's official,
5149500	5155500	but there were some people in a Korean forum who made a...
5155500	5167500	It's called the Mini IQ 3000 QT, that's basically a version of the IQ 2000,
5167500	5170500	which was the MSX-2 made in Japan by Daewoo.
5170500	5176500	It had some different goodies in it, but I don't think that it's actually officially licensed.
5176500	5184500	So, moving on into what we have to think for having come out originally on the MSX is...
5184500	5188500	I'm just going to go over quite a few series.
5188500	5194500	We had the ones that originated on MSX were Alastin Xanax,
5195500	5197500	Bomberan,
5197500	5199500	Penguin Adventure,
5199500	5200500	Edgarland,
5200500	5201500	Metal Gear,
5201500	5202500	Herodias,
5202500	5203500	and Puyo Puyo,
5203500	5206500	which you know me, I love my Puyo Puyo.
5206500	5213500	Others that had some version of them on the MSX,
5213500	5218500	a few of them being unique to the system for the version that they got,
5218500	5221500	there was Castlevania came out as Vampire Killer,
5221500	5225500	we had Contra, Dragon Quest, Dragon Slayer, Final Fantasy,
5225500	5227500	Gradius,
5227500	5228500	R-Type,
5228500	5229500	Wizardry,
5229500	5230500	Zack,
5230500	5231500	Xavius,
5231500	5233500	and Ys.
5233500	5238500	So, and like I said, there were a lot of companies that manufactured it.
5238500	5241500	Just the original MSX, to go over the list,
5241500	5243500	there was Spectrum Video,
5243500	5244500	Phillips,
5244500	5245500	Alamea,
5245500	5246500	Sony,
5246500	5247500	Sanyo,
5247500	5248500	Toshiba,
5248500	5249500	Hitachi,
5249500	5250500	National Panasonic,
5250500	5251500	Canon,
5251500	5252500	Casio,
5252500	5253500	Pioneer,
5253500	5254500	Fujiki General,
5254500	5255500	Yamaha,
5255500	5256500	JDC,
5256500	5257500	Yashica,
5257500	5258500	Kyocera,
5258500	5259500	Gold Star,
5259500	5260500	Samsung,
5260500	5261500	Daewoo,
5261500	5262500	Gradianite,
5262500	5263500	Sharp,
5263500	5264500	and Palette.
5264500	5267500	Quite a few less for the MSX too.
5267500	5271500	So, but there you go, that's the MSX.
5271500	5275500	All right, there it is, your classic system of the week,
5275500	5277500	the MSX.
5277500	5280500	It's one of those systems where it's like, sadly,
5280500	5282500	we just didn't really get to experience it here.
5282500	5285500	I mean, I guess they tried it, didn't catch on or whatever,
5285500	5287500	but yeah, it's one of those things where it's like,
5287500	5290500	there's a lot of things worth looking at on this system.
5290500	5293500	You know, especially like the actual sequel to Metal Gear,
5293500	5296500	not the one we got on the NES here, was an MSX game.
5296500	5300500	And I guess they did end up redoing that in one of those collections
5300500	5301500	on PS2 or PS3.
5301500	5303500	I don't even remember now, right?
5303500	5305500	Well, yeah, they have.
5305500	5308500	And you know what else came out on MSX?
5308500	5309500	Hm?
5309500	5310500	Gartic.
5310500	5312500	That's right.
5312500	5313500	That's right.
5313500	5314500	And that's the whole reason.
5314500	5317500	You know what else that came out on?
5317500	5318500	What?
5318500	5323500	It came out on iOS.
5323500	5325500	What came out on iOS?
5325500	5326500	Gartic.
5326500	5328500	It's on iOS?
5328500	5329500	Yep.
5329500	5330500	Oh, I had no idea.
5330500	5331500	I needed to check that out.
5331500	5334500	That's awesome.
5334500	5337500	At least the dream of the Guardian Legend is still alive somewhere.
5337500	5338500	That's for sure.
5338500	5341500	Dartitzy is confirming that the MSX Metal Gear was in.
5341500	5343500	Metal Gear Solid 3 Subs...
5343500	5344500	Subs...
5344500	5346500	I can never say that word.
5346500	5348500	The deluxe package that was on the PS2.
5348500	5350500	Yeah, I thought it went a ways back there.
5350500	5352500	So there you have it.
5352500	5353500	All right.
5353500	5354500	Yeah.
5354500	5356500	Well, Dark Sakura, anything else you want to say to the listeners
5356500	5358500	before we head out to break tonight?
5358500	5359500	Resist.
5359500	5360500	All right.
5360500	5361500	Have a good one, Dark Sakura.
5361500	5362500	Thank you for being here.
5362500	5363500	I'll try.
5363500	5364500	Bye-bye.
5364500	5365500	Bye.
5365500	5366500	All right.
5366500	5367500	There it is.
5367500	5369500	Your classic system of the month.
5369500	5371500	We are about to head out to a break here.
5371500	5374500	But before we do that, I understand our guests here in studio
5374500	5375500	are going to head out.
5375500	5377500	But we want to thank you guys for being here.
5377500	5380500	Again, the game is Little Tanks from Lead Money Games.
5380500	5382500	And congrats again on the release.
5382500	5386500	And best of luck with the coming weeks and months of patches
5386500	5388500	and whatever you guys choose to do next.
5388500	5389500	Yeah.
5389500	5390500	Thanks a lot for having us.
5390500	5391500	Thank you so much.
5391500	5392500	No problem.
5392500	5393500	Good luck.
5393500	5395500	I hope it helps get the word out a little bit there.
5395500	5397500	Definitely take your game out there to different shows, expos.
5397500	5399500	I think it's one of those things where more people get their hands on it.
5399500	5401500	You know, they'll be able to, you know,
5401500	5403500	oh, yeah, I got to download that game when I get home on Steam.
5403500	5405500	So good luck with the IndieCade submission and all that stuff.
5405500	5406500	Thanks.
5406500	5407500	You're welcome.
5407500	5408500	All right.
5408500	5409500	Thanks for being here, especially live.
5409500	5410500	A lot of people don't come here live.
5410500	5412500	And I know you came in from the Bay Area on a holiday nonetheless.
5412500	5413500	So we really appreciate it.
5413500	5414500	Yeah.
5414500	5415500	All right.
5415500	5419500	We're going to go to a quick break, though, here at the Voice Geeks Network.
5419500	5422500	When we come back, there is plenty more of a show to come,
5422500	5424500	including some more information on Minecraft,
5424500	5426500	Skype releasing on the Xbox One,
5426500	5431500	and some interesting regulations in Germany for live streamers.
5431500	5432500	Yeah, check that out.
5432500	5436500	Will we return with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this?
5436500	5442500	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
5442500	5444500	Live tonight, episode number 683.
5444500	5448500	For this April the 16th of 2017, the second half of our show,
5448500	5450500	live at vognetwork.com.
5450500	5452500	Just Loki and I left in the studio.
5452500	5455500	Our pals from Lead Money Games have taken off, heading back home.
5455500	5457500	We learned all about their game, Lil' Tanks,
5457500	5459500	which you can listen back to if you're just joining us tonight.
5459500	5461500	You can hear that on the podcast feed,
5461500	5463500	which should be on our YouTube channel.
5463500	5465500	Did you buy it during the show? Oh, good.
5465500	5466500	It does look interesting.
5466500	5469500	I like the idea of the whole kind of RPG elements in an arcade game.
5469500	5470500	I think that's pretty cool.
5470500	5471500	Yeah, yeah, I like that.
5471500	5473500	I'm about to steal ideas.
5473500	5475500	You mean be inspired by it?
5475500	5476500	Inspired, yes, right.
5476500	5477500	Not steal.
5477500	5479500	There's no stealing in games.
5479500	5480500	Not really.
5480500	5483500	And Loki is trying to convince me to make this programming thing happen.
5483500	5486500	I was trying to throw some ideas out there during the break.
5486500	5487500	I stole it.
5487500	5488500	We can do it.
5488500	5489500	We can do it.
5489500	5490500	We can do it.
5490500	5492500	I was trying to throw some ideas out there during the break.
5492500	5493500	I stole it.
5493500	5494500	We could do that.
5494500	5495500	I mean, that's fine.
5495500	5498500	I guess the idea I had exists somewhere, so I don't want to.
5498500	5499500	I'm sure every game exists.
5499500	5500500	Does it?
5500500	5502500	Let's just rip off a 2,600 game.
5502500	5506500	Let's just take a 2,600 game and make it porn, and that'll be the game.
5506500	5508500	2,600 game and make it porn?
5508500	5511500	Yeah, take a 2,600 game and make it porn.
5511500	5512500	Oh.
5512500	5515500	Everybody loves porn or ultra-violent.
5515500	5516500	I like ultra-violent.
5516500	5518500	Okay, we can do ultra-violent.
5518500	5519500	What's an ultra-friendly?
5519500	5520500	Combat.
5520500	5521500	Everybody's played combat.
5521500	5522500	There you go.
5522500	5523500	We'll make an ultra-violent combat game.
5523500	5525500	We're going to make combat, but it's ultra-violent.
5525500	5527500	I like it.
5527500	5532500	When the little tanks shoot each other, when one tank explodes, it sets on fire.
5532500	5533500	People start screaming.
5533500	5534500	It'll be awesome.
5534500	5535500	Right, Loki?
5535500	5536500	All right.
5536500	5537500	Let's do it.
5537500	5539500	I'll start working on mocking something up.
5539500	5540500	All right.
5540500	5541500	Sounds good.
5541500	5544500	Look, I'm with JD in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
5544500	5545500	Usually, I would agree.
5545500	5546500	Porn is better than ultra-violent.
5547500	5550500	You guys know I hate shit like the Saw movies and all that stuff.
5550500	5552500	But it's hard making a porn combat game.
5552500	5554500	It's hard making a porn combat game.
5554500	5557500	We could do that, and that might be inappropriate, but yeah.
5557500	5560500	When ultra-violence is over the top, then it's funny.
5560500	5563500	When it's like the itchy and scratchy show, I can deal with that.
5563500	5565500	That's what I mean when I say ultra-violent.
5565500	5568500	Or the Happy Tree Friends, which apparently is on Netflix now.
5568500	5569500	Did you know that?
5569500	5570500	No, I did not.
5570500	5572500	I was looking through Netflix the other night, and there it is.
5572500	5574500	I'm like, that shit is like 10 years old.
5574500	5576500	I saw that Sausage Fest was on Netflix.
5576500	5577500	Yes.
5577500	5579500	So I noticed that.
5579500	5586500	And also, was it, it was a, I forget the, I got the subtitle too.
5586500	5588500	I can't remember what the beginning is.
5588500	5591500	It's, I think it's like Kimbo and the Two Strings or something like that.
5591500	5592500	It was really good.
5592500	5593500	Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
5593500	5597500	JD in chat says genital jousting did a pretty good porn combat game.
5597500	5600500	Yeah, it was kind of stupid looking though.
5600500	5603500	But yes, it does, it is quite graphic.
5603500	5606500	I don't know how you make genital jousting look elegant, but all right.
5606500	5607500	Anyway.
5607500	5612500	Because they basically had penises, but the penises had asses on them as well.
5612500	5617500	I don't remember the point of the game, but I just know that you're supposed to stick your penis into another penis's ass.
5617500	5619500	Well, that happens sometimes.
5619500	5621500	Which is weird.
5621500	5623500	Moving on.
5623500	5627500	Let's get into some rapid fire news, Loki.
5627500	5629500	Yes, so.
5630500	5631500	This is kind of cool.
5631500	5634500	Race the Sun is a game that's been out for a while now.
5634500	5637500	And they're going to be adding PlayStation VR support.
5637500	5639500	A new mode and some other stuff.
5639500	5641500	And it's all going to be a free update.
5641500	5643500	And it's coming out in a couple days.
5643500	5647500	April 18th, it's going to be adding the PlayStation VR headset mode.
5647500	5648500	Relaxing.
5648500	5651500	There's a new game mode called Sunrise.
5651500	5657500	And I guess with that one, there's no high score or progressive.
5657500	5661500	I guess there's no high score to chase or progressive difficulty.
5661500	5663500	So you just keep going?
5663500	5666500	I mean, I don't really know what the point is then.
5666500	5667500	I don't know. We'll see.
5667500	5668500	But yeah.
5668500	5673500	I like Race the Sun and like VR, so it sounds good.
5673500	5677500	Now this, of course, when I saw this, I immediately thought of Rob.
5677500	5683500	There's this new game mode being added to Grand Theft Auto Online called Land Grab.
5683500	5685500	Now it doesn't sound that interesting.
5685500	5693500	However, it basically involves four teams fighting in neon colored cyberspace for territory.
5693500	5695500	So it's basically Tron.
5695500	5702500	And I guess there's a whole double XP thing that they're doing right now.
5702500	5710500	You're going to earn double cash and RP rewards between now and April 24th.
5711500	5716500	So I really do need to go back to play Grand Theft Auto 5 and online.
5716500	5718500	I've been off of that for a while.
5718500	5721500	Didn't Saints Row kind of try to do the online Tron thing already?
5721500	5724500	They did. They really...
5724500	5730500	I mean, they didn't three for a little section and that was alright and it was silly.
5730500	5737500	And then they went full bore into fucking four and it was just too much.
5737500	5740500	I still need to play the Goat Simulator sci-fi expansion.
5740500	5742500	Yeah, that looks funny.
5742500	5752500	I mean, Saints Row 4, I really dog on this.
5752500	5759500	Saints Row 4, if you've played Saints Row 3 enough, you realize how much of a reskin that game just is.
5759500	5763500	It's just the same shit all over again.
5763500	5769500	And whereas Saints Row 1 and 2, the different side missions, things they did that were ridiculous,
5769500	5773500	but they kind of had a little bit of a story that made it seem like it was more of like,
5773500	5779500	okay, this is why I'm this. It's silly doing the insurance fraud, but I'm getting money because this guy said,
5779500	5783500	oh yeah, I need some more clients and go make me money this way.
5783500	5785500	And that was cool.
5785500	5792500	But in Saints Row 3 and 4, it was just like, this is just a side mission, do it.
5792500	5798500	Well, at least instead of doing like Saints Row 5, they're going this direction with the agents of mayhem
5798500	5803500	and kind of trying something new. So maybe this will be a good kind of palate cleanser for, you know, volition.
5803500	5809500	I'm very disappointed. I do want a new Saints Row game. Just not like this. Not like this.
5809500	5815500	All right. Moving on to some other rapid fire news. Nintendo is doing some online maintenance.
5815500	5820500	That's right. They need to bring the servers down so they can launch their new online program.
5820500	5824500	Just kidding. I made that up. We don't know when they're ever going to launch their online program,
5824500	5829500	but the reality is the servers are coming down. So, you know, if you're playing games on the Switch,
5829500	5834500	which you could be playing fast RMX or Bomberman or something on the Switch,
5834500	5841500	the servers will be coming down on Monday, April 17th for two hours at 5 p.m. Pacific,
5841500	5846500	which is so weird that it's right in the middle of the freaking day. But to be fair, it is midnight Greenwich time.
5846500	5851500	So, you know, that's I guess you're going to piss off some time zone one way or another.
5851500	5856500	I was speaking of pissing people off in Nintendo. We were talking earlier about the NES classic production stuff
5856500	5863500	and how they're also ending the Famicom one as well. Yeah. They're not ending that permanently.
5863500	5870500	You know, I know we said temporary. Yes. So that kind of brings back the whole, you know, that they're revising the thing.
5870500	5875500	I'm sure. I'm sure. Yeah, no, no. I'd mentioned that they had only said temporary and that that's leaving the door open more
5875500	5884500	to a 2.0. I'm sure. We'll see. Time will tell. Anyway, moving on to Wednesday, April 19th is the second offline.
5884500	5891500	That is all of it. All the services will be coming offline for an hour and 45 minutes at 645 p.m.
5891500	5897500	Hour time Pacific time. That's 945 on the East Coast or 145 in the morning in GMT.
5897500	5902500	So that's online play and rankings and all that on the 3DS, the Wii U and the Switch.
5902500	5907500	That is so they can pull the plug permanently on the Wii U. Just kidding. I made that up, too.
5907500	5912500	I need to stop making up news. Sorry, guys. I just they don't ever say why they're doing this besides maintenance.
5912500	5920500	But maintenance isn't that exciting, is it? Well, as we mentioned earlier in the show, Star Wars Battlefront 2 has been officially unveiled.
5920500	5924500	They are doing the big Star Wars Fan Expo in Orlando right now or just wrapped up today.
5924500	5929500	I had some friends that went. I'm a little hatefully jealous of that. Did you watch the new trailer, by the way?
5929500	5936500	I know the whole Internet's talking about it, which really I mean, it was cool and all, but it didn't really show shit.
5936500	5940500	Good. I'm glad that's what a teaser is supposed to do, I suppose, is just tease a little bit.
5940500	5945500	I don't want them to give away all the endings because people are going to analyze that shit.
5945500	5950500	That's how they get the four hour YouTube analysis about the 30 second teaser about.
5950500	5956500	Well, since we saw this in one screenshot, it must mean that so we saw Poe Dameron with BB-8.
5956500	5960500	So this must mean it's just, you know, stop, stop, stop overanalyzing.
5960500	5964500	Yeah, after I watched that, then I watched the new Transformers trailer and I'm like, what the fuck happened to that series?
5964500	5968500	Like, I don't even know what the hell's going on now. Who knows?
5968500	5974500	All right. Anyway, so also, of course, we have Star Wars Battlefront 2, as we were mentioning earlier in the show.
5974500	5978500	They did show a video, so there's a trailer out there you guys can watch if you haven't seen it yet.
5978500	5984500	But it also shows the campaign mode. You're going to get to play as a member of an Imperial Special Forces unit.
5984500	5987500	DICE, Motive, Criterion are all working on this game.
5987500	5993500	You're going to get to play as heroes from the upcoming The Last Jedi film if you actually preorder.
5993500	5998500	There's not a lot of extra information besides that just now.
5998500	6002500	It will be released later this year. PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6002500	6007500	So PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 have been cut out of the picture.
6007500	6010500	Although actually, I don't think that those systems had Battlefront 1, did they?
6010500	6012500	I don't think they did. I can't remember.
6012500	6015500	But I mean, of course, it makes sense that we've moved on from those systems now.
6015500	6017500	So it's PC, PS4 and Xbox One.
6017500	6022500	But it's going to be nice that we're going to have a single-player mode in this will be really nice, for one.
6022500	6030500	And then also the fact they've come out and said that there's not going to be any season pass for this, which is nice as well.
6030500	6031500	Allegedly.
6031500	6035500	Allegedly. That doesn't mean they won't do DLC, but they're not going to do any season pass.
6035500	6038500	We'll see. I'll be curious to see what develops with that.
6038500	6041500	I'm sure we will hear more about it at E3.
6041500	6047500	So, in the meantime, let's move on to what is coming out in stores this week, Loki.
6047500	6055500	Alright, so this week we've got Full Throttle Remastered on PC, PlayStation 4 and the Vita.
6055500	6062500	Guardians of the Galaxy, the Telltale series, episode 1, Tangled Up in Blue is going to be making its way out.
6062500	6067500	PC, Mac, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, iOS and Android.
6067500	6072500	The Disney Afternoon Collection on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6072500	6075500	The Silver Case on PlayStation 4.
6075500	6083500	Wonder Boy, the Dragon's Trap on the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6083500	6090500	And finally, Micro Machines World Series on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6090500	6093500	Man, it's been a while since we had a Micro Machines game.
6093500	6097500	Yeah, it has been a little while. So, cool.
6097500	6102500	Let's travel to Japan real quick and then hopefully you can do the UK dates as well, Loki, since Dark Soccer is not here.
6102500	6106500	Going to Japan real quick on the PlayStation 4.
6106500	6112500	Let's see, coming out on the...what is the day here? I think the release day...
6112500	6116500	I don't know, there's a lot this week, actually. I think the 20th is the day they get in their games.
6116500	6120500	Yeah, looks like we get Dark Souls 3, the Fire Fades edition.
6120500	6124500	That must be the DLC all-in-one type of thing that's coming out there.
6124500	6129500	There's a vertical stand coming out if you need one of those to hold your PlayStation 4 upright.
6129500	6133500	There's also Parappa the Rappa is getting its physical release in Japan.
6133500	6135500	I remember that was the thing that's happening.
6135500	6137500	So that is all happening on the 20th.
6137500	6146500	The Vita is welcoming Dungeon Travelers 2 to Yamiochi no Otomo to Hajimari no Shou in regular and premium edition.
6146500	6150500	And then One Piece Burning Blood gets a price reduction this week on the Vita.
6150500	6155500	I see on the Switch this week, there actually is a new game on the Switch this week.
6155500	6159500	Mina de Wai Wai Spelunker is out this week.
6159500	6165500	It looks like it is one of those Spelunky kind of games, but it looks like it's multiplayer with that.
6165500	6171500	So this is not something I've heard about getting a US release, but I know it's so easy to do the worldwide releases now.
6171500	6176500	So I imagine it's just a matter of time before we get that over here as well.
6176500	6180500	Then I think the 3DS does still have some stuff coming out this week.
6180500	6184500	Oh yes, a new Fire Emblem game on the 3DS, so that'll be a big deal.
6184500	6190500	Fire Emblem Echoes Mojitori no Iyou comes out in regular and limited edition.
6190500	6195500	There are new Fire Emblem figures for Amiibo coming out to celebrate that as well.
6195500	6201500	But if Fire Emblem isn't your thing, you could check out Pro Yaku Famista Climax comes out this week.
6201500	6205500	That, of course, being a baseball game from Bandai Damko.
6205500	6208500	So that's it for your Japanese releases. How about the UK, Loki?
6208500	6213500	The UK, we have the Disney Afternoon Collection on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.
6213500	6217500	Voodoo Vince Remastered on Xbox One and PC.
6217500	6224500	Siberia 3, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PC, the Nintendo Switch, and Mac.
6224500	6228500	And finally, everything on PC.
6228500	6230500	Everything is out.
6230500	6231500	Everything is out.
6231500	6232500	Everything you've always been waiting for.
6232500	6235500	It's all coming out at once. Everything.
6235500	6237500	Let's go to the mailbag!
6243500	6245500	Every week, you guys email us.
6245500	6251500	Participate at orangeloungeradio.com, and we read some of our favorite emails here on the show.
6251500	6255500	We're going to start off this week with an email from Rettertainment, who starts off,
6255500	6257500	Hello, LR.
6257500	6264500	After getting a taste of Bree from the Sacramento IGDA's thoughts regarding the inclusion of sexuality in Mass Effect,
6264500	6267500	I started ruminating about the subject myself.
6267500	6271500	Yes, this includes more than just me frequently watching the scenes in Mass Effect on YouTube.
6271500	6277500	This involved deep thought about the very nature of how depictions of sexuality fit into the media form that is video games.
6277500	6280500	To that end, I've come up with the following perspective.
6280500	6286500	Why do people like watching shows like Desperate Housewives, Hotel Babylon, and many American soap operas?
6286500	6291500	Those shows are trashy in the sense that shows like that tease the audience with sexual content,
6291500	6297500	occasionally indulging the audience in that content, while also being generally a form of lighthearted escapism.
6297500	6300500	Why do people adore the music of Kylie Minogue? She's trashy.
6300500	6306500	Hey, watch it, Rettertainment. She's a goddess. You better watch your step.
6306500	6311500	Anyway, why do you have to diss? Of all the artists in the world, why Kylie? What did Kylie Minogue do to you?
6311500	6315500	Anyway, sorry, back to the email from Rettertainment.
6315500	6323500	Yeah, JD in chat was like, whoa, you just offended like every gay in the world.
6324500	6331500	You better step off our queen, Rettertainment. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. All right, look, moving on, continuing on.
6331500	6340500	She is, look, part of the reason why Kylie Minogue is awesome is that there is like a little bit of, actually there's a lot of camp to Kylie Minogue that's a lot of fun.
6340500	6345500	Anyway, ActDeaf says, I thought Gaga was the queen.
6345500	6353500	See, that's kind of like, like Gaga's like kind of like the mainstream thing, but like Kylie Minogue's kind of still that one that like, oh, not everybody's into her.
6353500	6359500	You know, same thing with Carly Rae Jepsen, like you're more underground if you're a Carly Rae Jepsen stan than a Gaga.
6359500	6368500	Everybody fucking likes Lady Gaga, but Carly Rae Jepsen? Have you heard the word of the gospel called emotion? Side B and Side A?
6368500	6373500	Anyway, why do people like Fifty Shades of Grey? It is trashy.
6373500	6381500	Okay, now that I'll agree with. Why do people like most reality programming? I have no goddamn motherfucking idea. Sorry, slipped for a moment there. It is trashy.
6381500	6390500	Should we see many of the depictions of sexuality and video games in the same light? Is the sex in Grand Theft Auto trashy? Is the sex in The Witcher trashy?
6390500	6394500	Does the St. Rose series revel in being trashy? Yes, yes, and goddamn it, yes.
6394500	6403500	Should we see the sexuality depicted in Mass Effect as trashy escapism with no real attachment to reality in our society as we know it?
6403500	6415500	Sure, the people at BioWare are trying to sell these games as a great example of storytelling, but if they admitted to Mass Effect being a sort of trashy escapism, the right wing media would be more on their asses than they are for their depiction of alien asses.
6416500	6421500	Now for another deep question. Which product do you think will be made available to the public first?
6421500	6424500	A. The game Loki is working on.
6424500	6428500	B. Crumple, the game Gabe from the Sacramento IGDA is working on.
6428500	6437500	C. It was in a coffee shop. The book I have that is currently available for pre-order on ink shares. Cheap plug. Well done, Retertainment, well done.
6437500	6451500	I would go with option B due to option B being exponentially more popular than option C, as well as option B having something option A doesn't have whose value is hard to quantify. A name. Stay black, Retertainment.
6451500	6456500	This message was brought to you by Apricot Heffenweizen. It is like fruit that gets you drunk.
6456500	6466500	So, which game will come out first? I agree, Crumple is going to come out first because I really, really think Gabe is like close on that. I think they're just tying up a few loose ends and that's going to be out.
6466500	6475500	So, but why would you, if your book isn't done, why did you throw that in there? So the question is, what's going to be done first, Crumple or your book?
6475500	6481500	I think you should, I think you should push and get that book done. Maybe you can beat Gabe. Maybe it will be option C. We'll see.
6481500	6489500	But if you trash Kylie Minogue in that book, I swear to God, I'm going to write a one star review. No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. But don't trash Kylie Minogue, she's awesome.
6489500	6500500	Alright, moving on. One more email this week from Unsigned here and I'm not sure if I want to read the actual email address, so I'm just going to say it's Unsigned.
6500500	6511500	Oh, it says Love, Sam. So this email is from Sam. Hello, OLR crew. I might love the show. The answer to your question is yes. The Scorpio will be $600, but that's okay.
6511500	6522500	There will also be a $400 SKU with a small hard drive and no Blu-ray. Problem solved. Love, Sam and Rob and Dark Sakura and Loki. Those are very strange emails. Is that insider info?
6522500	6533500	I'm not going to strip a Blu-ray from the system. That makes sense. No, I mean, I understand there's a licensing fee that goes with that and everything, but you're not going to knock $200 off the price by just making it not play movies.
6533500	6537500	It is a 4K Blu-ray in the Scorpio.
6537500	6552500	Yeah, I don't know. I mean, hey, I'm going to file this email away in the whole, like, check back in this email after E3 and then if it comes out that there's something to this, I'll email the guy back going, what else do you know? I'll just file this away.
6552500	6562500	Otherwise, well, okay, let's humor it for just half a second here. Could there be more than one version of Project Scorpio?
6562500	6573500	I don't think that they would do that. I mean, there could be, but if they do do multiple SKUs, they'll be different hard drive sizes, but they have a one terabyte versions. What's spec debt right now?
6573500	6580500	I don't know if they would really, I don't know. I don't think they would do that.
6580500	6584500	I don't think so either because I mean, Scorpio is going to be a hard sell.
6584500	6586500	Or if they do like colors or bundles or something like that.
6586500	6590500	Scorpio, I still think Scorpio is a hard sell as it is. I'm not getting this.
6590500	6601500	It is because 4K televisions, I mean, they're out there, but it's not like, I don't know, it's not, people aren't really feeling compulsive by that yet.
6601500	6608500	It's not like HD was where like all of a sudden all these different providers are offering, you know, 4K services.
6608500	6619500	I don't think, like as far as like, I have Comcast right now, which I don't even really use TV through them and may drop the TV, but I was looking at it and I'm like, I don't even know what 4K offerings they have.
6619500	6622500	I know Netflix, I think has 4K.
6622500	6624500	They do. It's limited, but they do.
6624500	6630500	But I don't know who offers it. So why would I upgrade unless I'm really buying a lot of those 4K Blu-rays?
6630500	6642500	I don't know if I'd really want it. And here's the thing too, like I used to have a surround sound system in my house, but it's so loud that like we don't use it anymore because I mean, it would wake up the kids if we were watching a movie with that.
6642500	6650500	I mean, it's cool, but like I would think if you want to upgrade your TV to 4K and stuff to really enjoy that, you'd want to have the sound and everything.
6650500	6660500	And I don't know, it's just, when they come down in price more, I'll pick one up, but I think right now there's not a whole lot of content on 4K for me.
6660500	6662500	It's just like it was with 3D TVs.
6662500	6669500	Yeah, over in chat over at live.voggenetware.com, Bob Coffee says there's like no 4K broadcast content.
6669500	6671500	Netflix and other streaming services offer that.
6671500	6678500	But that reminds me, now that you say 3D TVs, I forgot all about that update to the PlayStation VR. I totally need to watch Tron Legacy now.
6678500	6679500	Oh yeah, you do.
6679500	6680500	I totally need to do it.
6680500	6682500	I have The Lion King in 3D if you want to watch that.
6682500	6684500	Fuck The Lion King, I don't give a shit about that.
6684500	6687500	What about the kids? Oh wait, kids shouldn't do the 3D, I forget.
6687500	6693500	Ah, I've never let warning labels stop me from having them do that. They love that kind of shit.
6693500	6694500	It builds character.
6695500	6701500	Alright, thank you for the emails, you guys. Participate at orangeloungeradio.com if you want to send us an email in the future.
6701500	6707500	In the meantime, we have more news before we get to the Skype line over at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
6707500	6715500	Let's talk about Minecraft, like my son likes to do all the time, except now he's talking mostly about Super Mario Run, which is also irritating after a while.
6716500	6719500	But, it's just the quantity of it.
6719500	6729500	So, Microsoft is opening a brand new Minecraft online store selling both the user and Microsoft created content.
6729500	6733500	So, you know, mods and things, they're going to be selling those now.
6733500	6738500	Whereas, you know, on the PC version, which is still out there, you can get that stuff for free.
6738500	6751500	Whatever. So, they're doing that on the Pocket and Windows 10 versions of the game, which mine is still fucked up and I can't download it again because my Microsoft account is all sorts of screwy.
6751500	6752500	That's annoying.
6752500	6760500	But, they're going to be allowing you to transfer your purchases back and forth between your multiple Microsoft accounts because it's going to be tied to your Xbox Live account.
6760500	6765500	So, I don't know if this is going to come into the Xbox One version or anything like that, but that would be kind of cool.
6766500	6773500	I don't know really what they're offering, if it's just going to be like mods, because they have a whole mod system that you can do.
6773500	6774500	And I think this is optional stuff.
6774500	6778500	I think it's said straight up, not mods, but more like the cosmetic stuff.
6778500	6786500	But, that's still very interesting because I seem to recall a time when they were going to try to sell this stuff for Oblivion, remember that, in Steam.
6786500	6793500	But, the community pushed back big time where Steam and Bethesda had to be like, whoa, guys, I'm just kidding, we're not really going to do that.
6793500	6797500	But, I think that's why mods aren't included. It's only like cosmetics.
6797500	6802500	Yeah, Microsoft's store plays by it's own set of rules. It's shitty rules.
6802500	6814500	So, if I'm understanding this right, and maybe you're not, if I'm understanding this right, then we could do a, hypothetically, we could do an OLR skin pack, or a VOG network skin pack, or something, and sell it on the marketplace to make a little bit of money.
6814500	6820500	Potentially, yes, but I don't know what the details would be with setting that up.
6820500	6822500	But, maybe you could.
6822500	6825500	I think this may also include like, you know, structures.
6825500	6828500	I'm not saying we're going to do that, I'm just saying, hypothetically, could we?
6828500	6830500	So, maybe like structures, like maps and stuff like that.
6830500	6831500	Interesting.
6831500	6833500	But, yeah, it's something that they're offering.
6833500	6840500	And, of course, you know, they mentioned during the whole conference that Minecraft is coming to Nintendo Switch.
6840500	6842500	What exclusive features do you get on the Switch?
6842500	6846500	Jack shit. It's basically like the Wii U version of Minecraft.
6846500	6851500	But, hey, it looks nice. It's portable. I mean, they already have portable Minecraft, but it's portable.
6851500	6856500	Even the fact that this is portable and console, and it's all in one, that's a pretty big selling point for it.
6856500	6862500	And, some of us skipped it on Wii U, because we just kind of figured something like this might happen someday.
6862500	6864500	So, I skipped the Wii U version anyway.
6864500	6866500	I think it was just kind of like overpriced at the time.
6866500	6868500	It's really the same shit.
6868500	6873500	I already own, look, I own Minecraft on PS4, Xbox 360, PC.
6873500	6876500	So, it's like, yet again, here's one of those games I bought multiple times.
6876500	6880500	So, I wasn't really persuaded to buy a fourth time on the Wii U.
6880500	6882500	A fourth time on the Switch? Maybe.
6882500	6887500	I liked, again, the whole fact that I could pick this up, take it to a friend's house,
6887500	6889500	and we could play Minecraft together on the different Switches.
6889500	6895500	Like, that is more interesting to me than anything the other versions have done.
6895500	6896500	If that makes sense.
6896500	6897500	Yeah.
6897500	6898500	Alright.
6898500	6900500	Let's see. Moving on.
6900500	6907500	Speaking of Microsoft, something that is coming out for the Xbox One is a new version of Skype.
6907500	6909500	Skype was already on the Xbox One.
6909500	6914500	I remember when that system first came out, we got a couple phone calls to our own Skype line on the Xbox One.
6914500	6917500	I remember the camera used to follow you around, too, which is kind of cool.
6917500	6919500	The only thing the Kinect camera was good for.
6919500	6922500	It was a pretty cool feature to all said and done.
6922500	6925500	So, apparently, Kinect is going to have a new version of Skype.
6925500	6927500	And yes, they are still saying Kinect.
6927500	6932500	So, this is something new where, ooh, some usefulness out of Kinect that we haven't had for a year.
6932500	6936500	If you still have it because all those new systems don't sell it with Kinect and...
6936500	6939500	And you can't just hook up any old camera to this thing either.
6939500	6944500	I wish Microsoft would just break down that barrier and let you hook up any camera to it.
6944500	6945500	I mean, it would just be...
6945500	6947500	I even think I have a Microsoft camera.
6947500	6948500	It's just not a Kinect.
6948500	6950500	But I think my webcam is a Microsoft webcam.
6950500	6952500	Get over with Kinect. They're not using it anymore.
6952500	6958500	Anyway, the new edition is based on Universal Windows version that's on the other platforms.
6958500	6960500	But, of course, this is more for your living room.
6960500	6963500	So, there is snap picture and picture chatting now.
6963500	6964500	It's gone.
6964500	6969500	So, that is no longer there, but the whole thing has a new look, controller shortcuts,
6969500	6974500	manual zoom control to go with the automatic zoom, I guess, that follows you around and so forth.
6974500	6979500	So, yeah, you can check that out if you actually have an Xbox One with Kinect.
6979500	6981500	But, I mean, that'll be cool.
6981500	6984500	I liked it when we got phone calls for the show from Xbox One.
6984500	6985500	Yeah, that's cool.
6985500	6986500	It's always cool.
6986500	6992500	I mean, it's nice to see that extra functionality on systems, whether it's something I would use or not.
6993500	6997500	I don't know if this is going to prove itself to be super popular, but...
6997500	7000500	I don't think so with the limited amount of people that have Kinect.
7000500	7002500	Well, here's the interesting thing, okay?
7002500	7006500	The Xbox 360, remember when they put out the crappy little webcam for the 360?
7006500	7008500	Yeah, I remember that. I still have one.
7008500	7011500	Right. Well, you could do video calls on that.
7011500	7015500	That was before the Wii U. That was before the Xbox One.
7015500	7019500	On the Xbox 360 and that webcam thing, you could actually make a call to another Xbox 360.
7019500	7024500	And I remember, I think this was during a time when Shane was living in Kansas,
7024500	7028500	and I want to say we had a party at the house, and we had that.
7028500	7032500	And we called him so we could all say hi, even though he couldn't be there at the party,
7032500	7036500	but we could all, like, you know, kind of do the across long distance thing, which was neat.
7036500	7039500	That was like, ooh, the future, video calling, the Jetsons, that whole thing.
7039500	7044500	So, I mean, it's just interesting that that technology kind of, that's been around a while,
7044500	7053500	but I guess, you know, now they're just trying to unify it all under Skype is the same on Windows 10 versus a tablet versus Xbox One.
7053500	7059500	I mean, I get that they're pushing Skype as an alternative to actual calls and all that.
7059500	7061500	So, neat.
7061500	7062500	Yeah.
7062500	7064500	All right. Moving on. Loki.
7064500	7070500	So, this is kind of cool. They're working on creating a refund system for the Microsoft platform.
7070500	7072500	So, the Xbox One and Windows 10.
7072500	7078500	It sounds like that they're kind of building it similar to what they have on the Steam store.
7078500	7091500	So, it would basically be some sort of program where you'd be able to request a refund if you have under, like, so much time playing the game or whatever.
7091500	7099500	So, to request a refund, you'd go to your account on Microsoft.com, you'd sign in, and you'd select your payment and billing.
7099500	7102500	And then from there, you would collect a button that says request a refund.
7102500	7109500	And, of course, it said, you know, they're not available yet, but you'd be able to do that for, like, you know, DLC season.
7109500	7113500	Are they saying, like, some things like DLC season passes, game add-ons might not be eligible.
7113500	7119500	But games, they're saying that, you know, maybe depending on the amount of time that you played or something like that.
7119500	7123500	So, that's kind of neat, I guess, if you buy something you really don't like.
7123500	7127500	And they're saying less than two hours or if you've owned it for less than two weeks.
7127500	7132500	So, this is going to be controversial in the development community as it was on Steam.
7132500	7138500	Yeah, I think so, especially, like, when you're talking about games that just come out, like, that are just fucking broken.
7138500	7142500	And you know what? Good. I think it should be that way, because you know what?
7142500	7149500	If you release a product, you can't tell me that you, the developers of the game, don't know the, you know, the situation.
7149500	7157500	And let's not blame the developers themselves, the publishers. The publishers know what, you know, where the level of quality is on that product.
7157500	7160500	And they're just pushing it out because they're going to make a quick buck.
7160500	7166500	So, you know what? That's fine. I really think they should have more of these restrictions in place.
7166500	7173500	What are they going to do about the, and I'm using my quotey fingers, walking simulator games where some of them are only a less than two hour experience?
7173500	7180500	Things like Firewatch or, you know, maybe that was more like four hours, but still, you know, there's a lot gone home.
7180500	7183500	Fuck, you could be gone home in ten minutes if you know what you're doing.
7183500	7185500	You know, a lot of those games are shorter.
7185500	7190500	But I think for those, though, that's going to be a very unlikely scenario.
7190500	7197500	I mean, yeah, there may be issues where it's like that, but I don't think there's a lot of that content necessarily out on those platforms.
7197500	7200500	I mean, they've got, some of them, there are like...
7200500	7207500	Hopefully, the publishers can limit it if it, like, get a waiver or limit it somehow if it's justified.
7207500	7213500	You know what I mean? Like, if the game's length is short or the amount of the game is a certain amount or something,
7213500	7218500	then maybe the policy could be altered to be fifteen minutes before a refund or something. You know what I mean?
7218500	7223500	Like, I just, I would hate to see, because, you know, I like these kind of games.
7223500	7227500	And Dark Soccer, I know she's not here tonight, but I know what, because she was texting me all about it this week.
7227500	7231500	I know one game she got super into this week, she suddenly started Dear Esther on a whim,
7231500	7236500	which was the game that was before Everybody's Gone to the Rapture from that, what's the name of that company?
7236500	7242500	The Chinese Room, I think is the name of it, that that company made beforehand, and she was like super into it.
7242500	7248500	So, like, I really like those walking sims, and I hate that name, but that's what they call them.
7248500	7253500	But those types of games, I'm really into them, because they have such good fucking stories, usually.
7253500	7260500	And I like the fact that they're kind of quick, you know? It's like writing a movie, but you're the movie!
7260500	7265500	So, I just, I hope there's space for the short game in this.
7265500	7270500	I mean, couldn't you even beat a Telltale Episode 1 in a couple of hours?
7270500	7274500	I want to say Walking Dead Episode 1 did not take me that long.
7274500	7277500	You could beat those games pretty quickly, too.
7277500	7278500	We'll see.
7278500	7283500	Yeah, but they would depend on how they do this. A lot of those Walking the Telltale games, they release the first episode for free,
7283500	7290500	and then everything else you have to pay for, so they could say, oh, all the other levels are DLC, and that's restricted from it.
7290500	7295500	Oh, and I think that's actually how they do it. I think, like, King's Quest, that's exactly how they did it.
7295500	7301500	You had the base game, but then everything else is DLC that adds the, like, King's Quest Episode 2 and all the other stuff.
7301500	7306500	Hmm, okay. That might be a way they do it. Well, anyway, I just, look, don't get me wrong.
7306500	7310500	I think this policy at the end of the day is a good thing because of what you said.
7310500	7317500	It forces the publisher to put out a game that isn't going to be crappy right at their release date that they can, like, patch out later on.
7317500	7322500	But, I don't want to see it hurt the very creative, shorter games.
7322500	7324500	So, I just want to see a balance, that's all.
7324500	7330500	I just don't know if there's a lot of those, even, like, the walking sim games that they have in, on those platforms.
7330500	7333500	I want to say they're probably more than two hours in length.
7333500	7338500	So, you know, I would think that you would want, for your money, something a little bit longer than two hours.
7338500	7343500	I would be surprised if there's any games like that that are under two hours on that platform.
7343500	7351500	But, I mean, if you're really intent on just buying it and, you know, speed running through it,
7351500	7353500	I mean, that's kind of ridiculous to do that.
7353500	7357500	But, I just don't think that's going to be a very likely scenario that's going to happen all the time.
7357500	7360500	I mean, that takes a lot of forethought.
7360500	7362500	And, I mean, there's just a certain type of people that would do that.
7362500	7366500	I just, I don't think everyone's going to go do that.
7366500	7371500	I mean, I think the Steam thing is kind of accepted as the norm now.
7371500	7376500	So, you know, it'll hopefully work out alright on Xbox.
7376500	7379500	Again, I think at the end of the day it will be a good thing.
7379500	7383500	I just, you know, different games sometimes take different measurements with it, that's all.
7383500	7384500	Yeah.
7384500	7386500	Alright, well, let's move on and talk about…
7386500	7388500	Oh, and then of course, you know, to kind of add on to that,
7388500	7392500	Microsoft also said that they have the right to block users should they be found abusing the refund program.
7392500	7393500	Oh, okay.
7393500	7399500	So, if you do find people that are doing, burning through games in two hours and then, you know,
7399500	7401500	refunding them that they're going to block you.
7401500	7402500	Alright.
7402500	7408500	Well, let's talk about Germany for a little bit because there's some interesting legal maneuvers going on in Germany right now.
7408500	7415500	So, there's a German broadcast authority which I'm assuming would be similar to how we have the FCC here in the States.
7415500	7418500	Should I embarrass myself trying to pronounce this?
7418500	7422500	Landesmedienstalt is the name.
7422500	7424500	I totally butchered that, I'm sorry.
7424500	7429500	Sorry to any Germans or people that speak German listening to this show, but I butchered Japanese, bad enough.
7429500	7431500	So, now I butcher German.
7431500	7436500	Anyway, apparently this broadcast authority in Germany has said that YouTubers and Twitch streamers
7436500	7442500	need to get a broadcasting license because they're considered broadcast by the law.
7442500	7445500	This is coming from a YouTuber, Pete Smit.
7445500	7447500	I don't know if I'm saying that right, sorry.
7447500	7453500	He did a little video, it is in German, but he had to apply for a license by April 30th if he wants to keep uploading videos.
7453500	7461500	Now, broadcast licenses can cost between 1,000 and 10,000 euros depending on the size of the audience as well as, you know, other things.
7462500	7470500	I guess officials are aware that the rules are outdated, but they do, I guess, encompass broadcasts, but they were designed for TV and radio.
7470500	7479500	So, it sounds like most things when it comes to, you know, broadcast, when it comes to, we talked about patents before and some of that.
7479500	7484500	Some of this shit needs to be badly updated for how fast our technology is taking off.
7484500	7489500	You know, we have that problem when it comes to the patents and all that stuff in the States as well.
7489500	7495500	But anyway, so apparently he's gonna have to apply for this. I just...
7495500	7498500	I don't think, why would he just be maybe going after this guy?
7498500	7505500	But YouTube isn't based in Germany. YouTube is based in San Francisco.
7505500	7509500	Are they saying broadcast and the fact that he's like doing live streams or something like that?
7509500	7512500	Because that would be the only thing I see is broadcast, I mean, but...
7512500	7517500	Well, I think the reality is this guy is probably a PewDiePie-ish figure in Germany.
7517500	7521500	He's probably making a lot of money off his videos and the government wants money.
7521500	7524500	But wouldn't they be able to tax his income?
7524500	7527500	Like, because if that's what would happen here in the States, if I made a million...
7527500	7528500	That just seems really stupid.
7528500	7539500	If I made a million dollars off YouTube videos, although I gotta say, Bobby's Tesla thing that he put on the VOG Network channel, still getting tons of views.
7539500	7544500	So, I mean, we might actually get a check from YouTube thanks to that video.
7544500	7552500	I mean, it won't be a lot, but it's enough to like pay for the stream for three months instead of me having to pay for it or pay for the website instead of Bobby having to pay for it.
7552500	7554500	But anyway, I digress.
7554500	7564500	So assuming, you know, if we were to make over 400 or something like that dollars, I don't know what the threshold is, we'd have to claim that as income.
7564500	7567500	And so then there'd be an income tax on that. So the government would make their money there.
7567500	7568500	Yeah.
7568500	7574500	So does Germany not have an income tax? I have to plead ignorance here. I don't know enough about it.
7574500	7580500	Or is that not enough? Germany wants this money too. I don't know.
7580500	7590500	Anyway, TV stations with licenses in Germany also have to go by other guidelines, such as adult content, which has swearing and violence, because we all know they show titties in Germany.
7590500	7592500	So that is one thing that they have up on us.
7592500	7593500	Praise Germany.
7593500	7597500	They will show titties on the telly, but only after 10 o'clock.
7597500	7600500	But how are you going to police the whole damn internet, Germany?
7600500	7620500	I just, I think instead of going after this guy, they should probably stick to the whole, we know the laws are outdated, and maybe look at it from a perspective of, okay, if you want to tax this guy who's making money, then look into it in that regard, like what we would have to do here with an income tax.
7620500	7627500	Again, as I said, we are lucky and throwing confetti if we ever get a check from YouTube for one of our videos.
7627500	7630500	So this is not something I know a lot about, to be honest.
7630500	7637500	So I'd be very curious if we do have any overseas listeners, any perspective you guys might have from your own company on this.
7637500	7643500	I'm not seeing our chat room light up on this particular topic, but I don't know of any Germans that regularly listen to this show.
7643500	7645500	So we'll see.
7645500	7648500	Let's see, go into chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
7649500	7652500	Dungeon Buster says, it should be enough for hamburgers.
7652500	7654500	Tesla hamburgers for everyone.
7654500	7660500	Yes, the Tesla video might have made enough money to buy a pre-Dragon Con dinner.
7660500	7662500	Bobby and I have a tradition of a pre-Dragon Con dinner.
7662500	7665500	Perhaps this can fund the Dragon Con dinner this year.
7665500	7668500	Thank you guys for your views on that.
7669500	7673500	All right, anyway, moving on.
7673500	7678500	Oh, by the way, and if you're not subscribed to the YouTube VOG Network channel, go do it.
7678500	7680500	It's VOG Network over on YouTube.
7680500	7687500	It's not just the Tesla stuff, although Bobby did a great job with that, but you can actually see Shane from Ranger Pride.
7687500	7693500	I never get him on camera, and we're actually reviewing the Mass Effect ride over at California Great America.
7694500	7699500	Maybe there'll be some more projects in the future. I don't know, podcasting takes a lot of time as it is.
7699500	7702500	All right, but that's VOG Network over on YouTube.
7702500	7708500	Moving on, Loki, one more story here before we get to the calls at Orange Laundry Day on Skype.
7708500	7716500	So there's a brand new mod that they've done for Sonic the Hedgehog 2, and this you get to play Yoshi.
7716500	7719500	So Yoshi in Sonic the Hedgehog 2.
7719500	7730500	They're saying that Yoshi has all of kind of Yoshi's abilities, except now instead of Baby Mario, it's Baby Sonic riding on his back.
7730500	7735500	And you can actually eat the enemies and turn them into eggs and all that fun stuff.
7735500	7736500	So it's pretty awesome.
7736500	7742500	And they even have a little title screen and all that fun stuff.
7743500	7745500	So this is just a ROM hack?
7745500	7746500	Yeah.
7747500	7749500	That does look pretty good.
7751500	7754500	Is this one of those things that you can download on Steam?
7754500	7755500	Because you know how...
7755500	7760500	Yeah, I remember that. I don't know. I don't know if you can download it on Steam or not.
7763500	7765500	But yeah, I don't know. We'll check it out.
7765500	7773500	I think the guy who made it, Shiryu, he is like a Patreon that I think he releases his stuff on.
7773500	7774500	Interesting.
7775500	7776500	Looks pretty cool.
7776500	7778500	I think we must be missing out not being on that Patreon thing.
7778500	7781500	People will give you money for doing stuff on a regular basis?
7781500	7782500	Yeah, apparently.
7782500	7783500	We didn't get the memo on that.
7783500	7784500	Alright, anyway.
7785500	7788500	People will be giving money for this if they want to check this out.
7788500	7798500	ESL, which is an eSports league network, is going to be bringing its live competitive gaming channel called eSports TV to the PlayStation Vue.
7798500	7803500	Now PlayStation Vue is the cable-ish system that is built into the PlayStation.
7803500	7812500	So ESL's new channel is going to broaden competitive gaming's appeal by giving gamers access to 24-7 eSports content in the US.
7812500	7815500	It's already a thing in Europe. It launched in Europe last May.
7815500	7820500	Apparently 5 million households in the Europe territories have this, so that's pretty cool.
7820500	7827500	However, if you want to get this on PlayStation Vue in the States, you have to have a PlayStation Vue Elite subscription.
7827500	7829500	That's $54.99 a month.
7829500	7830500	So...
7830500	7832500	Fuck that.
7832500	7836500	Now, keep in mind, that doesn't mean you're paying all that much for one channel.
7836500	7837500	No.
7837500	7839500	It just means it's part of that extended package.
7839500	7840500	So fuck that.
7840500	7843500	Yeah, I don't know, guys. That's a lot of money.
7843500	7851500	But, you know, it's still kind of neat that eSports is kind of weaving its way into the traditional model.
7851500	7857500	But at the same time, we just had a conversation about how the traditional model for TV and all this stuff is completely changing.
7857500	7864500	So I really think, you know, and I'm sure these guys already have a huge presence on Twitch and YouTube and all that stuff,
7864500	7866500	but I feel like these guys are going to get even more.
7866500	7873500	I mean, 5 million, you know, households in Europe is cool, but I bet they have way more viewers online.
7873500	7874500	They do.
7874500	7875500	Yeah.
7875500	7886500	But anyway, I guess there's some weird validation that eSports gets by being in some of the same places that football and basketball and all that is.
7886500	7890500	Don't get me wrong. I was a PlayStation View subscriber for a while. The problem...
7890500	7891500	I didn't know that.
7891500	7897500	The problem is, though, they dropped some of their major channels. They lost the rights to them.
7897500	7899500	So, like, I didn't want to say, like, Comedy Central was one of those.
7899500	7902500	And that's really all I watched on there. I'm like, fuck that.
7902500	7908500	I'm leaving because this is the one channel that I watched on PlayStation View and now it's gone.
7908500	7911500	I'm not sticking around for the nonsense you have on here.
7911500	7912500	Yeah.
7912500	7913500	So, I mean...
7913500	7917500	As long as they have the H1 so I can watch Drag Race. It's the only thing I watch anymore.
7917500	7920500	It was all right. It's just, there's other options out there now.
7920500	7927500	I mean, what, YouTube has their YouTube TV coming out and they've got, you know, one of the other ones.
7927500	7931500	I know PlayStation View. There's the whole...
7931500	7933500	God, I can't remember the other one.
7933500	7935500	The other one through...
7935500	7938500	Not Sling.
7938500	7942500	It was through Dish. I don't remember. Maybe it was Sling. I don't remember.
7943500	7947500	They've got different, they have tons of different ways you can watch, or just even through your cable company.
7947500	7949500	William Murderface in chat confirms it's Sling.
7949500	7950500	Yeah.
7950500	7957500	So, I mean, I've got 50 bucks towards Sling because I bought that stupid, you know, Android TV thing, which is fantastic.
7957500	7963500	I love that thing, but I haven't really bothered to go on to Sling yet, but that might be something I'd do.
7963500	7967500	But yeah, I'm not going to, like, I wouldn't subscribe to the higher tier one because honestly,
7967500	7971500	I was looking at what they had, you know, versus the basic tier and the higher tier in View.
7971500	7975500	It's really not worth it. And this definitely wouldn't sweeten the pot.
7975500	7979500	We're going to go ahead and open up the Skype line over at Orange Lounge Radio.
7979500	7982500	All one word on Skype. If you want to give us a call about anything we've talked about tonight,
7982500	7985500	or maybe something we haven't talked about tonight, you can give us a call.
7985500	7988500	Orange Lounge Radio, again, all one word on Skype.
7988500	7992500	Wyland in chat points out, I think CW has H1Z1 coming up.
7992500	7995500	Yeah, I remember a story on this show about the CW.
7995500	7996500	Yeah.
7996500	8000500	Home of all those DC shows, and they don't even have Top Model anymore.
8000500	8005500	What else does CW have besides all the DC comics and Riverdale?
8005500	8009500	There's not a lot there, right? So, I mean, I guess they have to fill the programming time with something.
8009500	8012500	Oh, they have, that's where Whose Line Is It Anyway is still.
8012500	8013500	Oh, cool.
8013500	8015500	They do have that. They do have that, right? That's still going, right?
8015500	8020500	Ayesha Tyler just does it now, right? So, I think that's all on CW, so.
8020500	8025500	JD points out CW has Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, and that show is amazing.
8025500	8032500	That show, we watched it on Netflix, that show is fucking hilarious. Like, it's a brilliant show.
8032500	8037500	Everybody's telling me I need to watch 13 Reasons Why on Netflix, but apparently it's super fucking depressing.
8037500	8043500	I would watch Crazy Ex-Girlfriend. They break out in the musical numbers in every episode, and it's hilarious.
8043500	8049500	I mean, it's actually very well written. It's a show that my wife watches in, but it is very entertaining.
8049500	8051500	The comedy writing is just really good in it.
8051500	8055500	Alright, we'll dish on Netflix and TV for a bit, but if you want to steer us back to video games,
8055500	8057500	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
8057500	8061500	I started watching a show, you guys are going to tease me, but I don't give a fuck.
8061500	8067500	I got turned onto this because they never shut up about it on the RuPaul podcast that he does with Michelle Visage,
8067500	8072500	and it's a show called Schitt's Creek, which I guess is big in Canada, but they...
8072500	8074500	Yeah, we watched that too, yeah.
8074500	8079500	They show it on TV Guide Channel here, I think, but it's more of, well, it's Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara,
8079500	8081500	so it's the SCTV people, right?
8081500	8082500	It's pretty funny, actually.
8082500	8084500	Yeah, that show was fucking funny!
8084500	8087500	Yeah, so that was something I got into on Netflix recently.
8087500	8090500	I forget the premise, I mean, I sort of remember the premise, it's like something happens...
8090500	8097500	It's the richest to rags show that's been done a million times before, but it's being done with Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara.
8097500	8104500	Yeah, apparently they were super rich, and as a joke, they bought a town, and it was Schitt's Creek, I guess,
8104500	8111500	and so they just, as a joke, they ended up having to move there because they lost their money from some sort of tax thing.
8111500	8119500	Yes, that is the premise of the show, but again, it's funny because Catherine O'Hara, she's so fucking funny in everything I see her in,
8119500	8126500	and it's also, you know what, it's not just SCTV, but those guys are always in the Christopher Guest movies,
8126500	8131500	like Waiting for Guffman, what was the one about the dog show? Best in Show?
8131500	8132500	Best in Show, yeah.
8133500	8138500	His movies go back to Spinal Tap, but I don't think these other guys started showing up until later on,
8138500	8145500	and again, those movies are really, really fucking funny. I think there's actually a new one on Netflix I never watched.
8145500	8151500	There's one called Mascots or something, it's about like football mascots or something that's out there.
8151500	8154500	I think I need to watch that still, but that stuff is all really funny.
8155500	8158500	Looking at some TV recommendations and chat.
8158500	8163500	All right, sure, you guys want to talk TV? Why not? Nobody's calling in tonight. I guess it is a holiday.
8163500	8168500	William Ritterface in chat says, The Magicians is great. I saw that, I saw that in the list.
8169500	8176500	Come on, Noel Gus says, Oh, you should watch Class on BBC America. It's a young adult spinoff of Doctor Who,
8176500	8182500	but it has a really well done gay couple arc. I already binged the series online because it already aired in the UK.
8182500	8185500	That's cool. Doctor Who isn't on Netflix anymore, did you know that?
8185500	8186500	No, I didn't necessarily.
8186500	8191500	I didn't realize they took that off. Netflix is always getting rid of shit that I want to see,
8191500	8197500	but then random shit that I was like, Oh, I didn't know this was on Netflix shows up like Finding Dory.
8197500	8200500	I was like Gremlins. Gremlins, yeah, showed up.
8200500	8201500	Yeah, Finding Dory.
8201500	8203500	Star Trek's back. All the Star Trek's are back.
8203500	8209500	They get all the new Disney stuff, so like you'll see all the new Disney movies, like Moana will probably be on there pretty soon.
8209500	8210500	That's good.
8211500	8216500	Well, I'm sure they'll be the next thing that my kids binge, but like, yeah, they have all sorts of weird stuff,
8216500	8221500	but then like sometimes something they have doesn't make any sense, like Kung Fu Panda and Kung Fu Panda 3.
8221500	8227500	It's like, where's Kung Fu Panda 2? Sorry, there's no Kung Fu Panda 2 for you, but you can get one or three.
8227500	8231500	It's like two doesn't exist. It's like, I want to watch two.
8232500	8235500	Was that, was that where I started binge watching?
8235500	8240500	Because I'm looking in chat over Act F says Rob Roberts blamed BBC for that.
8240500	8246500	Was Netflix where I started binge watching the Crystal Maze or was that just a YouTube?
8246500	8250500	Maybe that was a YouTube hole I fell down, not maybe it was a crystal maze.
8250500	8251500	Okay, it was like this game show.
8251500	8255500	So our listeners overseas are going to fucking know what I'm talking about, but it was never here.
8255500	8257500	But what can I compare it to?
8257500	8262500	Like, okay, it was like a, it was like kind of, I think it was like a kids-ish game show that would,
8262500	8264500	I don't think it was just our kids, I think it was like 20-somethings.
8264500	8271500	But it's like they actually went through this, like the studio was set up as like an actual maze
8271500	8275500	where like some of it would be a jungle and they would have to solve puzzles in all these rooms
8275500	8279500	and the puzzles that they solve gives them time in the chamber at the end
8279500	8282500	where they have to grab as many gold tickets as they can.
8282500	8286500	And like, so it's like akin to, I'm trying to think, maybe like Legends of the Hidden Temple or something
8286500	8288500	I thought we did have that show here.
8288500	8290500	No, we didn't. We didn't.
8290500	8295500	And it was hosted by Richard O'Brien, which was like the other thing he did besides Rock Your Picture Show
8295500	8297500	was he was the host of that show.
8297500	8303500	And so I don't know how the fuck I felt, no, one of my friends that lives over in Britain
8303500	8305500	is obsessed with it and told me to watch it one night.
8305500	8310500	And so I did, I thought I found it on Netflix, maybe it was YouTube, and I just found out it well
8310500	8314500	and I started watching these episodes and I was like, I would have been obsessed with this fucking show
8314500	8316500	if it was around when I was a kid, but we didn't have it here.
8316500	8320500	I mean, but we had like, I think, yeah, like Legends of the Hidden Temple is probably the closest thing we had to it.
8320500	8322500	And Fun House.
8322500	8325500	Maybe Fun House, but like, Fun House was that super sloppy shit.
8325500	8328500	And that wasn't like, Crystal Maze wasn't really that.
8328500	8334500	So, that's not dignified. This is a British television show, lowkey.
8334500	8337500	Anyway, let's see, going to our chat over it.
8337500	8341500	Oh, the other one I watched too, Samurai Gourmet, have you seen that one?
8341500	8347500	I think that's what it's called. It's like, it's a Japanese show about this guy who retired, he's like, retired.
8347500	8355500	And he goes around eating food at these different Japanese locations and fantasizing about his life if he was a samurai and stuff.
8355500	8360500	It's kind of, it's interesting, it's different, but very relaxing.
8360500	8363500	Rama in chat says, Samurai Gourmet is so good.
8363500	8367500	Tigerclaw in chat says, Legends of the Hidden Temple was made into a movie for Nickelodeon.
8367500	8369500	Yeah, I heard about that.
8370500	8374500	Didn't they do another one of their 90's shows as a movie, too?
8374500	8375500	Like, I feel like...
8375500	8378500	Yeah, they did. Well, they have the whole Invader Zim.
8378500	8380500	Are you Afraid of the Dark? Is that the one that they did?
8380500	8385500	They did a movie for that a long time ago, but Invader Zim, they just announced that they're bringing that back as a movie.
8385500	8388500	Which I'm like, God dammit, why can't it be a series?
8388500	8392500	But John and Vasquez is on there, so I'm like, fuck yes, I'm down.
8393500	8396500	And then they did the whole, what was it?
8396500	8399500	Rocko's Modern Life, I think, had a movie that they did.
8399500	8401500	When's Doug the movie?
8401500	8406500	Probably not too far away. I mean, I don't know.
8406500	8409500	I just have to say this, since we're talking about old shows.
8409500	8412500	This is my last call for phone calls. If nobody calls in, then nobody calls in.
8412500	8414500	Orange Lounge Radio, all onward on Skype.
8414500	8420500	I was going to say with the TV shows, we're like only two weeks away from Twin Peaks Season 3.
8420500	8423500	And like, oh my God, it's finally here.
8423500	8430500	Like after all this waiting, 25 plus years later, Twin Peaks Season 3 is coming.
8430500	8435500	I don't think they're calling it that, they're just calling it Twin Peaks or whatever, but it's Twin Peaks Season 3.
8435500	8438500	I'm so fucking pumped for that.
8438500	8441500	I don't even have showtime though, so I guess I'll have to...
8441500	8444500	Isn't it like a bonus option on Hulu or something?
8444500	8446500	I'm going to have to figure out how I'm going to watch that online.
8446500	8448500	So, anyway.
8448500	8451500	Loki, any last minute stories with video games?
8451500	8454500	Yeah, so there's a couple things.
8454500	8460500	First off, I know we don't really give a shit, but Konami is doing another patiche slot for Castlevania.
8460500	8467500	So, let me give a shout out real quick to our buddies over at GameBui.org,
8467500	8472500	because they just did a live show yesterday in celebration of I think five years of doing their show.
8472500	8474500	Yeah, believe it or not.
8474500	8476500	Makes me feel old.
8476500	8478500	But yeah, they did a live show yesterday.
8478500	8483500	But I listened to their last broadcast show where Spike was talking about his trip that he took to Japan.
8483500	8485500	And if you guys haven't heard it, it's definitely worth checking out.
8485500	8487500	Again, it's over at GameBui.org.
8487500	8490500	And Spike was talking about his trip to Japan, and he was talking about how,
8490500	8494500	as much as we kind of laugh about the pachiko slot thing here,
8494500	8500500	in Japan, you see those things a lot more places.
8500500	8505500	So the fact that a company kind of pours its resources into that makes a lot more sense.
8505500	8508500	We laugh at it, because here it's a fucking novelty.
8508500	8511500	You don't even really see legit pachinko machines anywhere here.
8511500	8515500	It's just, you know, maybe you'll see something inspired by it, Dave and Busters.
8515500	8519500	But anyway, we do have a phone call coming in here at the last minute.
8519500	8521500	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
8521500	8522500	Hey, this is Akdeaf.
8522500	8525500	Hey, Akdeaf. Wait until the last minute. That's all right. What's on your mind, buddy?
8525500	8529500	Yeah, sorry, I got kind of distracted by what you were talking about, but yeah.
8529500	8531500	Fair enough.
8531500	8536500	Well, anyways, Kirby's 25th anniversary.
8536500	8539500	Oh, that's right! That was all part of the Nintendo Direct!
8539500	8543500	How could we forget to shout that out, Akdeaf? I'm glad you're here to remind us.
8543500	8545500	What were your thoughts on all that?
8545500	8552500	Well, it's pretty amazing. At least from what we saw in the Direct,
8552500	8558500	we were getting three games, three Kirby games this year, so that's pretty awesome.
8558500	8563500	I'm still kind of surprised, though, that they're making so many big games for the 3DS.
8563500	8566500	I really thought that system was going to be on its way out the door,
8566500	8570500	but I guess maybe I was trying to eulogize it too fast.
8570500	8573500	It seems like there's still at least another year's worth of games coming out on the 3DS.
8573500	8578500	I mean, not just the cold-step thing, but that's just localizing a game that came out like a year ago in Japan.
8578500	8582500	But, you know, obviously this Kirby thing, one of those that I know they were showing was on the 3DS.
8582500	8588500	The 2D Pikmin game or whatever they were showing to us, it seems like there's still some pretty big titles over there on 3DS.
8588500	8590500	But, yay, Kirby!
8590500	8600500	Yeah, I was actually surprised that Kirby wasn't getting a Switch game and is getting a new multiplayer game on the 3DS.
8600500	8607500	Well, wait. You know, Kirby's probably focusing on 3DS for now because Mario's going to get the push this holiday.
8607500	8611500	But don't rule anything out for next year or the year after.
8611500	8617500	Yeah, most probably we'll see a Kirby Switch game sooner rather than later.
8617500	8626500	But, yeah, like you were saying, the 3DS is getting a lot of games and it's really surprising that it's still getting a lot of love.
8626500	8629500	Not only from Nintendo, but from other companies too.
8629500	8635500	In some ways it's almost a little frustrating because I kind of just want them all to move to Switch.
8635500	8644500	But, look, the guys that were here earlier talked about for their game that they were making, the Little Tanks game, that it took them two years to do that.
8644500	8648500	And that's pretty custom for any game that's out there being developed.
8648500	8650500	Shit, some of them take up to five years to develop.
8650500	8660500	Realistically, sometimes you start developing a game on 3DS and it's like, we're still going to release on this platform because we've been developing for it.
8660500	8663500	We didn't know the Switch was going to take off as fast as it did. This was our target.
8663500	8672500	I actually felt bad because one of the guys that was doing a talk at the Sac Indie Arcade that we were doing on Saturday, last Saturday, he just had his game release on Wii U.
8672500	8679500	And I couldn't help but think, oh, but are people still checking their Wii Us and all that stuff?
8679500	8682500	I would want to talk to that guy more about that.
8682500	8690500	But I'm sure, in his mind, when they started developing that game, they didn't know that the Wii U was going to fucking just croak once the Switch came out.
8690500	8696500	Even Nintendo just croaked because there's still a lot of people that own Wii Us that probably aren't jumping on board.
8696500	8703500	But here's the thing. Here's the telltale sign for me. Nintendo didn't say a goddamn thing in that direct about Wii U.
8703500	8709500	And I didn't expect them to. But they were still talking about 3DS. They didn't say a goddamn thing about Wii U.
8709500	8713500	So Wii U is as good as gone, as far as Nintendo's concerned.
8713500	8717500	Zelda was the swung song. That's it.
8718500	8725500	Considering Nintendo isn't producing any more Wii U, so yeah. That's something to consider too.
8725500	8731500	JD does bring up a good point in our chat that's worth mentioning though. 400K bought Zelda for the Wii U.
8731500	8734500	So those people are still going to be actively using their Wii U because they bought Zelda.
8734500	8737500	So maybe things aren't as bad as they are in my head.
8737500	8742500	Because in my head I'm thinking, oh, well all these fucking people are upgrading to the Switch.
8742500	8749500	But even our own Dark Sakura, her and Dan didn't do that. They've been enjoying Zelda on the Wii U. Shit, so has Loki.
8749500	8753500	So I guess maybe perspective warps things sometimes, I suppose.
8754500	8768500	Yeah, most probably because even though the Switch isn't that terribly hard to get to buy, many people don't have probably the money to make the upgrade.
8768500	8769500	That's true.
8769500	8776500	So yeah, I also know a lot of people that got the Wii U version because they couldn't afford the Switch, so yeah.
8776500	8792500	Did you guys hear though there's already rumors, internet rumors, but I've got to mention there's already rumors that Nintendo is planning a Switch Mini for kids basically because the Switch as it is is kind of a bulky handheld.
8792500	8797500	I mean, I could see that. I don't know if a kid would walk around with one of those things.
8797500	8807500	So that they're eyeing doing a Switch Mini, but that this Mini, this is where the rumor kind of starts to lose me a little bit is that this Mini would have additional technology inside it basically.
8807500	8818500	And this is where I start to kind of go, hmm, I don't know if I see, I mean, true, they did it with the new 3DS, but this fast? This fast?
8818500	8819500	Yeah, I don't know.
8820500	8825500	I would be a little disappointed, and I don't want that. If they're going to put better technology in it, don't make it smaller.
8825500	8832500	How are you going to make a Switch Mini when the controllers are the same height as the screen without reducing the size of the screen?
8832500	8836500	I guess unless you increase, you make the bezel bigger, but what's the point then?
8836500	8844500	Yeah, I don't know. So again, it's just a rumor, so don't go crazy with it, but you know, it did kind of have me thinking like, wow, would Nintendo really do something like that?
8844500	8853500	But I just don't think, even if they did, I really just couldn't see it happening this year. I really feel like holiday, they're going to pour everything they have into moving as many Switches as possible.
8853500	8862500	But at this, maybe at this point, they're already a success. I think maybe even Nintendo wasn't prepared to have sold as many Switches as they have.
8862500	8866500	It seems like they always underestimate themselves. I don't know. I don't know.
8866500	8869500	Alright, well Act F, we're going to let you go, but thanks for the call. It was great.
8869500	8871500	Hey, thanks for having me.
8871500	8874500	No problem, and I hope those Kirby games come out soon, and they're great.
8874500	8880500	Well, there's already one available, so yeah. I've been playing that.
8880500	8884500	Did they stealth release that? Like, they just released it right after the Direct? I didn't miss that.
8884500	8892500	Yeah, because, this is going to be quick. Two of the games they announced, there were mini games on Planet Robobot.
8892500	8895500	So they pretty much expanded on those.
8895500	8898500	Got it, got it. I thought for some reason they were separate.
8898500	8902500	Yeah, Team Kirby Deluxe Clash is free to play.
8902500	8909500	And there is microtransactions and all that, but you don't have to pay anything if you don't want to.
8909500	8912500	And you can enjoy the game pretty much completely.
8912500	8913500	Okay, cool.
8913500	8914500	It's pretty cool.
8914500	8916500	Well, thanks for the heads up.
8916500	8918500	I'll talk about that another time.
8918500	8921500	I like free, so I'll check that out on 3DS. Thanks for the heads up.
8923500	8924500	Well, see you.
8924500	8925500	Alright, take care buddy.
8926500	8930500	Alright, I guess that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight because nobody else was calling in.
8930500	8931500	So we're going to close that down.
8931500	8933500	But if you do think of something after the fact, you can always email us.
8933500	8937500	Participate at OrangeLoungeTrader.com is the place to send us an email.
8937500	8940500	Loki, any other last minute stories for us tonight?
8940500	8943500	Yeah, so there's a couple of funny things.
8943500	8954500	So first one is actually Nintendo is offering bounties now for hackers to find exploits in the 3DS and the Switch.
8954500	8959500	And they're willing to pay, I guess, upwards from $100,000 to $20,000.
8959500	8964500	And I guess three hackers have already kind of contributed towards this.
8964500	8966500	So they have that right now.
8966500	8971500	Is this how they're going to combat the hacker things when it comes to the classic NES version 2?
8971500	8975500	I guess. I mean, I don't know.
8975500	8980500	And then, of course, there's this kind of funny thing.
8980500	8987500	So there's this guy that was a fan of the Touhou Shmup series.
8987500	8997500	So he developed, as kind of a fun little project, a ransomware malware that basically would force you to...
8997500	9000500	He called it, was it Ransomware?
9000500	9005500	Because it was based off of the Touhou games and ransomware.
9005500	9020500	And so what it would force you to do is it would lock you access to your files unless you were able to play through unidentified fantastic object on lunatic difficulty and score 200 million points.
9020500	9027500	Which basically even the guy who made this malware thing can't do.
9027500	9028500	It's not nice.
9028500	9034500	But he uploaded it because it was kind of a funny... He wasn't trying to infect computers.
9034500	9037500	It was just like, hey, look at this silly project because I love this game.
9037500	9039500	Of course, some people already infected their computers with it.
9039500	9044500	And so he actually released a patch to unlock your computer.
9044500	9045500	Okay. All right.
9045500	9052500	But ransomware is definitely kind of a high-fatal malware.
9053500	9060500	But I made it for a joke and just laughing with people who like Touhou project series.
9060500	9061500	All right.
9061500	9062500	All right.
9062500	9066500	Well, I think that's going to bring us to the end of another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
9066500	9068500	But thank you guys for joining us this week.
9068500	9073500	Thanks to our pals from Lead Money Games who came here this week to talk about Lil' Tanks.
9073500	9075500	Hope you all check that out on Steam.
9075500	9080500	Next week on the show, actually, we're going to have another guest with us.
9080500	9081500	I like this.
9081500	9083500	All of a sudden, we're getting these indie developers here on the show.
9083500	9084500	So this is cool.
9084500	9088500	This one will be by Skype, though, because he's on the other coast.
9088500	9095500	But we're going to be joined by Zircon, who is behind Tangledeep, which is a game that is just...
9095500	9098500	I think they're just wrapping up their Kickstarter in the next couple of days.
9098500	9100500	He's also a fucking amazing musician.
9100500	9102500	Yeah. So he's going to be here on the show.
9102500	9103500	So that'll be awesome.
9103500	9104500	That's pretty awesome.
9104500	9105500	So we can talk about Tangledeep.
9105500	9107500	And, Loki, we'll talk about the music as well.
9107500	9109500	Yes. I knew he was working on the game.
9109500	9110500	That's pretty awesome.
9110500	9112500	Yeah. He is a fucking amazing artist.
9112500	9114500	Well, you can fanboy next week, then, a little bit.
9114500	9118500	In fact, just to mention, one of his songs, actually...
9118500	9121500	Well, probably, I'm sure a few of his songs have made it into Cage Match.
9121500	9122500	He did that.
9122500	9125500	It was a Final Fantasy remix that I put in.
9125500	9129500	That was a Zircon thing that he did on Cage Match one time.
9129500	9130500	Wow. Okay. That's cool.
9130500	9134500	But, yeah, he used to do a lot of stuff on OC Remix, so it'll be cool.
9134500	9136500	All right. Well, I'm looking forward to that.
9136500	9138500	So that will be next week on the show.
9138500	9141500	So we'll tweet more about that as we come up on the next OLR.
9141500	9142500	Very awesome.
9142500	9146500	Unfortunately, since we had the guys from Little Tanks here this week,
9146500	9149500	I couldn't get him on this week when his Kickstarter is still going.
9149500	9151500	So I want to make sure it gets a shout-out now.
9151500	9154500	If you want to check this out, go check that out.
9154500	9156500	Again, that game is called Tangledeep.
9156500	9162500	You can check that out over at the Twitter, it's Tangledeep Game.
9162500	9166500	And I'm sure you can find all the links to the Kickstarter and all that stuff.
9166500	9168500	Because I think there's just a couple more days left on that.
9168500	9171500	So by the time he's here on the show, that will be all wrapped up.
9171500	9173500	But we can at least ask questions about how it went
9173500	9176500	and, you know, any lessons he learned from that and all that stuff.
9176500	9178500	Well, he's done a Kickstarter project back some of his
9178500	9180500	because he had some albums that came out.
9180500	9182500	But never a game, right? This is his first game.
9182500	9183500	This is his first game, yeah.
9183500	9185500	That's what I thought. All right, awesome.
9185500	9187500	So that is next week on the show.
9187500	9191500	But, meanwhile, hopefully, Dar Sakura will be back here next week.
9191500	9192500	And, Loki, you should be here too.
9192500	9195500	The gang will be all here for our next episode.
9195500	9197500	As always, at the end of an episode of Orange Laundry at O,
9197500	9200500	I'd like to tell you guys to please help us spread the word,
9200500	9201500	tell a friend or five about the show,
9201500	9203500	because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
9203500	9206500	But if the voices aren't out there, we can't air them.
9206500	9211500	So we really appreciate all the folks that help bring their friends
9211500	9213500	and even their enemies to the show.
9213500	9215500	If you are having a problem with the word-of-mouth stuff,
9215500	9217500	you can always leave a five-star review.
9217500	9221500	Trust me, guys, a five-star review on a place like iTunes goes a long frickin' way.
9221500	9224500	If you're not an iTunes person, then wherever you found this podcast,
9224500	9230500	like the Google Store or wherever this show may have found its way to your inbox,
9230500	9233500	please leave us a nice review. It would help an awful lot.
9233500	9236500	That is going to do it, though, for the show this week,
9236500	9239500	but we can't wrap it up until we get to everybody's final thought.
9239500	9242500	And, Loki, I'll start with you tonight. Your final thought.
9242500	9247500	I'm going to hopefully finish my 3D printer either, I'm guessing, probably tomorrow,
9247500	9253500	because I still have a bit to do and debugging and all that fun stuff.
9253500	9256500	So hopefully we'll get something printed this week,
9256500	9260500	and then we'll have to talk about the bro-programming.
9260500	9262500	Yes, we will. Yes, we will.
9262500	9266500	And who knows? Maybe Jamie will end up getting involved in that,
9266500	9268500	because girls can be bros, too. There's nothing wrong with that.
9268500	9271500	So maybe Jamie will get in on the bro-programming stuff, too.
9271500	9272500	So we'll see.
9272500	9276500	But anyway, my final thought this week is candy.
9276500	9280500	Thank you to Alan for bringing me candy for tonight's show,
9280500	9282500	because it's all raining and depressing outside,
9282500	9284500	so I was like, I want candy. That'll make me feel better.
9284500	9287500	And he brought me some of my favorites, Mike and Ike's, for the show.
9287500	9289500	So shout-out to Mike and Ike's for being delicious,
9289500	9293500	and shout-out to all the candy sales that'll be happening tomorrow,
9293500	9297500	and less shout-out to the fact that they will be making me fluffier.
9297500	9299500	But in the meantime, we'll see you in seven days
9299500	9301500	for an all-new episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
9301500	9303500	Until then, buh-bye.
