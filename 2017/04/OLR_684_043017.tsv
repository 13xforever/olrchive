7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	22000	This week, Ravel with the girls of Night Trap. They're horror in suspense by revisiting Sega's most realistic, horrifying, and controversial titles of the FMB generation.
22000	27000	This is just one grip of tonight's show, and there's plenty more to come right now in the show where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36000	45000	It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode number 684 for this April the 30th of 2017.
45000	50000	And a big thank you to being back this week. Sorry guys, we missed last week unexpectedly.
50000	54000	I hate canceling shows at the last minute the day of, but I got really sick.
54000	58000	In fact, you might still hear it in my sinuses a little bit. Black being sick is awful.
58000	65000	But my name is Rob Roberts, and I'm here joining you with my co-hosts here in Studio N7 in Sacramento, California.
65000	73000	Over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle, say hello first off to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
73000	74000	Hi!
74000	79000	Hi! Happy birthday, a little belated. Since we missed last week, we missed your birthday show.
79000	80000	I'm old. Where's my presents?
80000	88000	I feel bad for that. Your presents is being the gifted with our presents. No, Alan and I owe you a fancy schmancy dinner.
88000	90000	Don't worry about it. I'm just being a bad.
90000	91000	We want to. It'll be fine.
91000	92000	Okay, fine.
92000	97000	But how'd you celebrate No Show last week? Did you get to catch up on some games? Did you beat Andromeda yet?
97000	99000	Oh, I beat Andromeda before that.
99000	100000	Congrats.
100000	104000	I'm doing another playthrough right now. I'm trying 100%.
104000	105000	Of course.
105000	108000	Except I had to go back and catch up on the WoW content, because I went flying.
108000	110000	Oh, yeah. They had a patch at some point recently.
110000	111000	A big patch.
111000	112000	Yeah, yeah.
112000	117000	I mean, like, it's pretty big lore stuff if you've been a lore fiend.
117000	118000	Sure.
118000	120000	But I'll talk about that and how what was I playing.
120000	121000	Sounds good.
121000	129000	Um, but, uh, it, uh, I didn't really do much. I just stayed at home in my pajamas.
129000	131000	That's all right. I needed to rest too. It happens sometimes.
131000	136000	Well, my work schedule has split days off, so I don't really feel like I get any real rest.
137000	142000	And so I needed the break today. I slept until two. It was great.
142000	143000	Rockstar.
143000	147000	But for my birthday, I decided I wanted a fairy garden.
147000	149000	A fairy garden?
149000	150000	A fairy garden.
150000	151000	Like Navi the fairy in Zelda?
151000	152000	No, it's-
152000	153000	Hey, listen.
153000	162000	It's basically a thing where you just make like a little in a like kind of like a maybe a foot diameter pot.
162000	169000	And you make just like a little fairy house with a yard and trees made of succulents and stupid shit like that.
169000	170000	I've never heard. All right.
170000	173000	And next thing you know, you have growing frog fractions three in the bottom.
173000	176000	Well, hello, Techmaster Loki. How are you?
176000	177000	I'm fine.
177000	183000	She's, I know all I heard was that she's growing pot, but there was something else about that about fairies and stuff, but that's, that's all right.
183000	184000	How are you, Techmaster Loki?
184000	185000	I'm fine.
185000	186000	Did you have a good week off unexpectedly last week?
186000	190000	Yeah, I went and saw The Fate of the Furious.
190000	191000	Oh, how was that?
191000	197000	It was just a totally random movie to pick because I haven't watched, I've literally only watched the first two Fast and the Furious movies.
197000	201000	And so like I'm totally out of the Fast and the Furious universe as far as it's concerned.
201000	204000	It's actually pretty good. I was very surprised.
204000	207000	I thought like, geez, by like was it the eighth movie now?
207000	209000	It can't be that good.
209000	210000	It's pretty entertaining.
210000	219000	I mean, let's just, it's not an intelligent movie, but it was good for what it would expected it to be a good popcorn movie.
219000	220000	And I enjoyed it.
220000	221000	I was very surprised.
221000	225000	I rarely get to the movies anymore, but I mentioned a few weeks ago, I saw Power Rangers.
225000	230000	It was kind of random for me, but I mean, you know, considering a really good friend of mine was obsessed.
230000	234000	I wanted to see Ghost in the Shell, but apparently I waited too long for that.
234000	238000	So that's a lot of, they had like one showing at 10 o'clock at night that day.
238000	240000	I was like, it flopped pretty bad.
240000	242000	I know, but I still want to see it.
242000	244000	Oh, hi, Alan. How are you?
244000	246000	Everybody's being horrible tonight at waiting for their introductions.
246000	247000	Hi, Alan. How are you?
247000	248000	Hello.
248000	249000	Hi, you're going to join us here for a little bit at the beginning.
249000	250000	Yes.
250000	251000	There's a reason I'll get to that in a minute.
251000	254000	The Ghost in the Shell actually was like a big smash in Japan.
254000	255000	Oh, was it?
255000	256000	Oh, yeah.
256000	257000	Interesting.
257000	260000	Well, look, we can talk about movies, but it is a show about video games.
260000	263000	In fact, we have some new faces tonight and I'm sure that's thanks to our guest.
263000	266000	Yes, Zircon is going to be joining us in about 20 minutes or so.
266000	268000	It is a three hour show if you guys didn't know.
268000	271000	So he'll be joining us for a little bit to talk a little bit about Tangledeep.
271000	274000	And of course, we'll ask about some of his other projects.
274000	278000	And of course, you guys can ask your questions because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific time.
278000	281000	Nine o'clock Eastern at the Voice of Geeks Network.
281000	284000	vognetwork.com right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
284000	285000	So hello.
285000	287000	I know we have some new faces in chat tonight.
287000	288000	This is your first time at OLR.
288000	289000	Hello.
289000	290000	Welcome.
290000	291000	Thanks for being here.
291000	299000	Believe it or not, this show has been on the air since the year 2002 when we started as three friends all playing, get this, Dance Dance Revolution.
299000	306000	And even though we got a little old and our body parts gave out, so we don't play as much DDR anymore, we still talk about video games because that was the thing you do.
306000	312000	You go play DDR, then you go meet at the diner across the street, have some mozzarella sticks because that's the healthy thing to eat after you play DDR, right?
312000	313000	And then talk smack.
313000	316000	But it's fine because back then we were burning enough calories where it didn't matter.
316000	319000	I was never skinnier in my life than those years during DDR.
319000	320000	Exactly.
320000	322000	So I'll always be thankful for that and the fact that it gave us this show.
322000	326000	So yeah, this show might almost be as long as Zircon's music career.
326000	330000	I've got to figure, I'm not sure what year he started with the Overclock Remix stuff.
330000	331000	I got to ask about that.
331000	334000	But I remember in the early days of OLR, you were a fan.
334000	342000	You brought a lot of the Overclock Remix stuff to OLR, Loki, so when you heard he was coming on tonight, you were excited. I'm excited.
342000	350000	Well, I had backed his last, I don't know if his last Kickstarter, but one of his Kickstars, I have a couple albums from his.
350000	353000	I've bought a few of his albums, I don't know. I've listened to a lot of it.
353000	359000	Well, let's go to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com where I see William Murderface saying,
359000	365000	Does anyone play DDR that much anymore? I mean, I feel like it's going through a little bit of a renaissance right now.
365000	368000	Like, there was a few years where it was like deader than a doornail.
368000	374000	But then I think because of round one, Dave & Buster's, some of these other, well, I don't think it ever died in Japan.
374000	377000	But over, maybe it dipped.
377000	379000	But like, you know, I think it's kind of like has a renaissance now.
379000	382000	Like I definitely see like more people are into it than it seemed were into it.
382000	384000	Oh, I don't know, maybe five years ago or so.
384000	389000	So anyway, I do want to shift gears here a little bit because Alan is joining us here at the top of the show.
389000	392000	And what I was going to say for the whole DDR thing. Yes.
392000	399000	Yeah. Well, for me, you know, the spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised.
399000	406000	Wow. All right. Look, Alan is joining us here at the top of the show because you went on an interesting shopping adventure this week.
406000	411000	And I want to I want to talk a little bit about this because it is about it's a shopping story, but it's about video games.
411000	415000	Right, Alan? Yes. OK, what happened? What did you do? You woke up early Monday morning.
415000	427000	So the previous weekend and maybe the week leading up to it, a cheap ass gamer and a bunch of other sites like Polygon and Kotaku ran a story that said the Best Buy was getting.
427000	436000	Factually, they were getting some Nintendo classic consoles on Monday, which would have been the 22nd.
436000	440000	I have no concept of time, whatever Monday was.
440000	448000	So, of course, as we all know, the whole lifespan of this product has been sort of a shit show. Supply issues.
448000	455000	It's been hacked. There's no interface on it for them to update the firmware on it. There's no storefront on it, which was mistake number one.
455000	460000	And I guess the manufacturing costs have gone up. So Nintendo is just like washing their hands of it.
460000	465000	So it's become a collector's item because it's only been around for like, what, November? Four months.
466000	473000	So I was like, all right, I will go to Best Buy early in the morning to see if I can get one of these suckers.
473000	481000	So I get there. For those that don't know, Alan is my husband. So Alan was like, even though in the beginning I was like, I don't want one.
481000	486000	I don't need one. These are ridiculous. The minute now it's like, oh, well, if you don't get one now, you're never getting one.
486000	489000	Then I was like, maybe I should get one.
489000	497000	There's a dozen better ways to play NES ROMs than a Nintendo classic that don't involve the short ass cable and this, that, and the other.
497000	500000	So it was more about the game of getting one.
500000	503000	Now it's a thing. Now it's a thing. Yes.
503000	509000	It's like the parents on some Mad Max shit in the parking lot at Toys R Us trying to get a Tickle Me Elmo.
509000	513000	Their kid doesn't even like Elmo. They just want to be able to say that they're the parent that got one.
513000	514000	They're the mom of the year.
514000	520000	They're like, I got tooth marks on my elbow from where I clocked some bitch, but I got my Tickle Me Elmo.
520000	521000	Did you clock a bitch, Alan?
521000	527000	No, I did not. So I show up. I get up kind of, I wanted to get there at 8am. I was not about to camp overnight.
527000	537000	This isn't a console launch. So I get there at around 830. You were sick. So I was trying to surprise you with a...
537000	540000	That's true. I missed last week's show and I was still sick on Monday morning. I had to call out of work.
540000	542000	So I was like, this will make you feel better.
542000	543000	Yes.
543000	551000	So I got up early for me because I work evenings and nights. Get there around 830. I'm roughly the 30th person in line.
551000	557000	Like 30 or 31. And I see as I'm pulling up that there's obviously a line of people, 30 people.
557000	564000	And I was like, I guess I'll hang out and see how many they get because I thought they were going to get like three.
564000	573000	So I get there at 830. People are kind of, it's not that cold. People are talking in line at around...
573000	578000	Was everybody in line talking about reminiscing about Nintendo and their fondness for classic NES systems?
578000	583000	Some of them and some of them were sharing consoles like, oh, I blasted this for the PS3.
583000	590000	Okay. See, I thought that, okay, I got that because I thought the honest joke was going to be, I don't know, I'm here to buy one, sell it on eBay. What's a Nintendo?
590000	592000	Well, I'm getting to that.
592000	595000	Oh, sorry. Excuse me. I'll just have a seat over here.
595000	604000	No. So the people that were in the part of the line that I was in was social and everyone was buried into their phones. It was kind of cold, whatever.
604000	617000	So this one guy pulls up a customer is like, I just came from the Natomas one because the management, the Natomas Best Buy because the manager did the call, the vouchers earlier and they got seven.
617000	632000	So already I'm the 31st person in line and I'm hearing Natomas, this is like at 915, got seven. Best Buy opens at 10. So the guy drove from Natomas to here to see if we would get more because it's the Arden Best Buy is like the Best Buy in Sacramento.
632000	633000	Right.
633000	637000	I mean, Sacramento is kind of lame, but we're sort of a metropolitan area.
637000	643000	We're the capital of the biggest state. We have a basketball team. They're terrible, but we have a team.
643000	653000	So finally it's like quarter to 10. And finally the manager comes out with a little helper and a security guard. He's like, all right, I've got these vouchers here.
653000	659000	They are going to be first come first serve. I'm going to start here by the door, front of the line. We have 24.
659000	669000	24 Nest Classics. So being person number 31, I'm already shit out of luck. Okay, so that's really where the story should end.
669000	685000	But as soon as the manager handed out those 24 slips, the first five people in line who clearly had camped out, like they had lawn chairs and stuff, so they were in it to win it, immediately started to hustle their vouchers.
685000	689000	As soon as the manager was out of earshot and was trying to flip the voucher.
689000	690000	On the Best Buy premises.
690000	695000	On the Best Buy premises, right in front of the store. And I was like, what happened to the good old date?
695000	704000	Well, like if they just bought their shit and then tried to flip it on Craigslist or on eBay, that's their business because they bought the product.
704000	709000	But I had a problem with the fact that one, they were doing it right as soon as the manager had left.
709000	717000	And it's like, you still have to buy the thing. And they're trying to sell this paper. I couldn't tell if this guy was joking, but one guy was like, for the low, low price of $300.
717000	720000	And it's like, this thing costs 80 bucks.
720000	721000	Like go to 60.
721000	728000	60. So they were basically going up and down like, don't leave. I got here if you want to buy it.
728000	733000	So I'm like, all right. So the first five consoles are basically like a wash.
734000	739000	And again, in a weird way, it's like, do I respect the hustle of them?
739000	744000	Because I mean, Nintendo created this fucking problem and they're just trying to make a buck off of it.
744000	750000	I mean, Best Buy, of course, I'll get to this in a minute, does have some responsibility.
750000	754000	But it was just, it was lame. And I did see one dude finally.
755000	763000	So let me, I'm skipping ahead. So when people in line were like, nah, dude, like we missed, like, we're not, we're not buying the voucher from you.
763000	772000	They then started to approach people coming up for like five minutes to the store saying, hey, are you here for the next Nest Classic? Because who shows up at $9.59?
772000	777000	So they were going to respect the line for their hustle as they were moving down the line.
778000	783000	But as customers who had not waited in line were like, are you here for the Nest Classic? Yeah.
783000	785000	Well, here's this piece of paper and you already missed your chances.
785000	792000	So they were basically trying to do their sales pitch to people that had not waited in line and had no idea what was going on,
792000	796000	which is kind of weird to have to like run through this gauntlet of dudes just to get into the store.
796000	802000	I mean, to get there right when they opened, maybe they didn't want a Nest Classic, but these people said they did.
802000	805000	And they immediately got their sales pitch. So, lame.
805000	807000	Finally, you saw them sell one.
807000	813000	Yes, I did see one dude hand a bunch of 20s to a guy. I don't know if it was 80 bucks or 160. I don't know.
813000	818000	I just saw, I saw wallet open and a piece of paper exchange hands. So I'm like, okay, well, there's a sucker right there.
818000	821000	Let me move things forward here a little bit because we do have an interview coming up tonight.
821000	827000	But do we, did, did anybody complain to Best Buy about the fact that these guys are hustling on the premises?
827000	834000	So, I went, I went to the car, updated you, updated Twitter, was like, but by this point,
834000	841000	everyone from person number 25 onwards had pretty much left because it was the 24 people that got the vouchers.
841000	848000	And I was like, you know what? I wonder if these people trying to sell their shit, maybe they'll wash out.
848000	853000	Maybe they won't find anyone. Maybe they'll leave. Maybe their credit, maybe someone's credit card will get declined.
854000	860000	So I'm going to stick it out and just wait for the damn doors to open, which at this point was only like 15 more minutes, 10 more minutes.
860000	868000	I'm going to get in line and see what happens. So doors open, we all rush in and there's this mom who got there like five minutes to 10.
868000	872000	And I sort of, she was like, are you thinking about buying one of the papers? I'm like, I don't have cash on me.
872000	879000	And even if I did, I'm not, I'm not supporting their BS. So we are all in line.
879000	889000	I'm sort of waiting to hear if someone is going to flake out. And the manager comes up and says, these vouchers are good until one in the afternoon.
889000	896000	So if you leave the property, the owner of that piece of paper can buy the product through 1 p.m.
896000	903000	If 1 p.m. comes and goes and all of those 24 vouchers are not accounted for, then they will do first come first serve to the people there.
903000	910000	And I was like, well, so now those, because three or four of those five guys that were trying to do the hustle had left.
910000	915000	Why until one o'clock? What is, what is the pro consumer reason?
915000	917000	It's three hours. I don't know.
917000	919000	That you would let people wait until one o'clock.
919000	925000	Why would you wait there to get a voucher that you're really, this is the vouchers that go buy something and then come back?
925000	928000	Oh, I'm sorry. I'm not ready to buy this yet. Then why are you in fucking line?
928000	934000	I mean, okay. I understand maybe if you have to run and use the ATM or something like you got there.
934000	936000	Okay. We'll give you until 11 then.
936000	940000	Exactly. Give them an hour or say, you know, fine. Now that you're here.
940000	942000	They have an ATM in the goddamn store.
942000	947000	Everybody uses cards these days anyway, but fine. If somebody has a big need like that, then fine.
947000	954000	If you come back in 30 minutes, we'll hold this for you while you work out your banking issues.
954000	957000	You know, fine. But that just encourages people to turn around and resell it.
957000	961000	And that's the part of your story that really like irks me the most.
961000	963000	Why does Best Buy have that?
963000	966000	The mom that I sort of made friends with was like, okay, so you're the manager.
966000	974000	So I want to know what you're going to do about the people that are scalping the vouchers on your property.
974000	978000	And the guy was like, people were reselling them? Yes, you would have seen that if you stuck around.
978000	983000	Well, I mean, our protocol is for any release like this is we hand out the vouchers.
983000	989000	What people do with those vouchers is their business. If they're scalping them, that's unfortunate.
989000	997000	But that is not okay. And it's like, all right, if they had one or two security guards at the front door that were like, okay, whatever you're doing, you're not doing it here.
997000	1003000	Go to Toys R Us. Go to Burger King. Go to the way you're putting it.
1003000	1006000	That says to me Best Buy supports the scalping culture, period. Yeah.
1006000	1009000	And part of this problem is being created is because of Best Buy.
1009000	1017000	It's like out of sight, out of mind. If you want to do your shady shit at the other end of the parking lot where it's not Best Buy property, then whatever.
1017000	1023000	But they just weren't there. They didn't care. So finally, we're like, so they left.
1023000	1027000	You're saying it that it was unfortunate, but you have no control over scalping.
1027000	1031000	What about the people that left? What's going to happen?
1031000	1035000	He's like, well, if you're here waiting to see if someone's going to wash out on their sale, those vouchers are good until 1 p.m.
1035000	1039000	So if you're here just to see if people can't get one, you have to come back at once.
1039000	1043000	So at that point, I was like, okay, so now I'm just wasting my time. So then I left for real.
1043000	1049000	So let me read some comments in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
1049000	1053000	William Murderface says, what, do they need to find a Bitcoin ATM or some shit?
1053000	1057000	S2100 Matt says, what a shit show. Sounds like they made this up as they went along.
1057000	1063000	Dungeon Buster says, I feel less guilty visiting one and then ordering what I want from Amazon.
1063000	1069000	Let's see. Dungeon Buster says, you can make a few Raspberry Pi versions for 300. Just saying.
1069000	1073000	Yeah, but you know, sometimes it's just about the game of getting one.
1073000	1079000	And being person 31 out of 24, I already knew that that game was over for me.
1079000	1086000	But it was watching the resulting shit show of how Best Buy didn't care about the scalpers and then also gave them a three hour window to do their hustle.
1086000	1088000	And that's part of the reason why I wanted Alan to tell this story.
1088000	1093000	Because we're hearing a lot of speak from Nintendo this week about the whole, oh, there's limited resources.
1093000	1099000	What's the line they've been given this week on why they've sold two million of them, but they're not doing any more because what?
1099000	1105000	We're only one company. We're only one company. We don't have unlimited resources. Resources are limited.
1105000	1110000	This is only supposed to be a holiday thing. Blah, blah. Jamie's making a motion with her hands.
1110000	1115000	Like, yeah, this is just like it's a lot of speak and it sucks to hear things like this.
1115000	1121000	And look, at the end of the day, oh, well, we didn't get one. It's not about that.
1121000	1126000	I don't care that we didn't get one and all that. If I really wanted one bad enough, I should have started fighting for one in the beginning.
1126000	1135000	I accept that. But what sucks about this whole thing, what I think really needs to be examined is why is Best Buy's policies basically allowing scalping to happen?
1135000	1141000	And why are these? I mean, I can also understand that, you know, retailers don't give a fuck or whatever.
1141000	1143000	They still get the money at the end of the day, blah, blah, blah.
1144000	1152000	But I still think, you know, especially as one of our chatters put it, in this day and age where it's so easy where you can just turn your back on the retailer then and go to Amazon.
1152000	1159000	Don't you want a retailer that's going to fight for the consumer a little bit, so to speak? Like, I don't know. Doesn't that little bit of faith go a long way?
1159000	1167000	They just had to have the security guard who was taller than me, and I'm 6'4", hang out front and be like, what are you guys doing? Don't do that here.
1167000	1178000	And just kind of make it a little harder to scalp. And just the fact, again, if they had bought their shit and then flipped it in the parking lot on Craigslist, on eBay, whatever, they bought the product.
1178000	1190000	If they want to resell it to some sucker for 400 bucks, fine. But the fact that it was for a piece of paper where you still have to buy the actual product after you paid them for their extortion BS.
1191000	1194000	Let me read a few more comments here. Brad from Pod Culture says,
1194000	1200000	Flipping one is one thing. The fuckers that show like 10 in a damn eBay auction pic are the real bastards.
1200000	1206000	Come on, Cupid Boy says, At the end of the day, Alan is still a great guy for trying to do something nice for his man. I agree.
1206000	1216000	If I had gotten up at like, if I was there by 7am or 730, but again, I shouldn't have to go to a place at 7am for a retro console.
1216000	1218000	Those five guys should have been an issue.
1218000	1227000	Bobby Blackwolf says, My Best Buy screwed me out of a pro controller because they wouldn't let me jump out of the pre-order line to get it and let someone who didn't pre-order behind me in line go to the register first.
1227000	1231000	So they have some issues with their launch process. They also did vouchers for Switch.
1231000	1237000	Picratos, hope I'm saying that right, in our chatroom says, Nintendo is trolling at this point.
1237000	1241000	Well, okay, quickly, because again, we've got Zircon coming.
1241000	1248000	Here's the quote. So the quote is, Even with the extraordinary level of performance, we understand that people are frustrated about not being able to find the system.
1248000	1256000	And for that, we really do apologize. But from our perspective, it's important to recognize where our future is and the key areas that we need to drive.
1256000	1264000	We've got a lot going on right now. We don't have unlimited resources. That is some, that is a fucking line of bullshit right there.
1265000	1273000	Let me quickly ask this, because there's been a lot of increased rabble rabble on the internet this week about the Super NES Mini.
1273000	1279000	You know, first, that was the fanfic. Oh, the logical follow up to the NES Mini is the Super NES Mini. That's what Nintendo is really going to do.
1279000	1285000	And I don't, like Eurogamer has a tip or something, and they've been, you know, they're just spot on with Nintendo stuff.
1286000	1294000	But essentially, there's a lot more rabble rabble, where there's smoke, there's fire, et cetera, about Super Nintendo Mini is a thing happening this holiday.
1294000	1301000	And there's a part of me that's like, fuck them, I don't care. You know what? Here's what I think about your fucking NES Mini.
1301000	1306000	I bought a fucking Raspberry Pi yesterday, so fuck you and your stupid Mini.
1306000	1310000	You know what? Virtual console on Switch would be fine too, but...
1310000	1316000	We told a friend to hold one for us, and we got one from our friend. At GameStop.
1316000	1323000	See, here's the thing though. Yes, but you have to, even that's a little, I don't want to say it's shady, but it's, you have to know somebody.
1323000	1326000	If you have a hookup, then that's, that applies to everything.
1326000	1329000	And we wanted it for ourselves, not to sell.
1329000	1336000	It shouldn't be like fucking alcohol in the 1920s. Like, you have to know the secret password to say at the front where they let you in the brothel in the back.
1336000	1338000	There's no one poisoning the machines.
1338000	1343000	Like, it shouldn't be like that. I just, I don't understand.
1343000	1349000	I mean, I'm sure we got at least one amiibo back when they were sort of fresh, ma'am, and relatively rare. They didn't have the third reprinting.
1349000	1355000	We got some of the more coveted amiibos through a hookup. I mean, that's just how that works if you know someone.
1355000	1361000	And please, don't give me this bullshit that, oh, I'm sorry, we're just, we don't have unlimited resources.
1361000	1369000	Then how is it that other companies that manufacture, probably in the same countries as you, do not have these supply problems?
1369000	1373000	Why is it that you're the only fucking company that consistently has supply problems?
1373000	1378000	It's not because you don't have unlimited resources. It's because you're fucking incompetent.
1378000	1381000	I was, I'm going to try to wrap up on this, and then I want to move on.
1381000	1387000	But I, one thing I would like to see Nintendo do, I'm going to try to keep this constructive and happy and da da da da da.
1388000	1395000	I would like to, in light of this story that we're hearing about how easy it is for scalpers to take advantage of what these retail channels are doing,
1395000	1400000	I would like Nintendo, if they are going to do a Super Nintendo Mini, which is going to be, now that I really want,
1400000	1405000	because the Super Nintendo is like my favorite system, as I think many of you probably feel the same way.
1405000	1411000	I want to know, what is Nintendo going to do to hold retailers accountable for this scalping market?
1411000	1418000	Look, I understand you can't prevent scalping 100%. Like, that's just, capitalism is-
1418000	1420000	People are always going to try and get one over.
1420000	1423000	Exactly. But what steps are you going to take to make it a lot fucking harder?
1423000	1429000	Because what Alan is talking about was too easy. That's, that's the long and the short of it.
1429000	1434000	Anyway, let's see, go into chat for a few more comments here over at live.vognetwork.com.
1434000	1441000	SC Mike says, all these limited resources do is just support pirating the ROMs and emulators, honestly.
1441000	1445000	Yeah, we still don't have Virtual Console, which I would have thought could have been like their-
1445000	1448000	They could have gone, oh, well, you know, we don't have any more NES Classic Minis.
1448000	1452000	But guess what? We're going to release on the Switch for $29.99.
1452000	1458000	We're going to have a NES Classic bundle that will turn your Switch into an NES Classic.
1458000	1462000	And we're going to release a controller that will work with the Switch wirelessly.
1462000	1464000	Would that have been the most difficult thing in the world to do?
1464000	1473000	But it's okay, you know, when they launch their online service, they'll have your free monthly rental of a game that, you know, Game ROM that you get for free or something like that.
1473000	1474000	And you'll love it.
1474000	1478000	Okay, we're going to shift gears here because we are very excited here at Orange Lawn Radio to welcome-
1478000	1480000	By the way, Alan, thank you very much for sitting in.
1480000	1481000	Bye, show.
1481000	1482000	I know you guys-
1482000	1483000	Went back to the office.
1483000	1484000	Got other stuff to do like work.
1484000	1485000	Thank you for trying. I really appreciate it.
1485000	1486000	Okay.
1486000	1487000	You're welcome.
1487000	1491000	As I was saying, we're very, very honored tonight to have a special guest joining us on the show.
1491000	1496000	Has had a very, very long musical career through organizations like Overclocked Remix.
1496000	1505000	And now is moving on into game development with developing and planning on releasing Tangle Deep a little later this year.
1505000	1509000	We're going to get Zircon on the line and he'll be joining us here.
1509000	1510000	And I believe we have him on the line.
1510000	1512000	Hey, Zircon, you there?
1512000	1513000	I am.
1513000	1515000	Hey, welcome to Orange Lawn Radio.
1515000	1516000	Hey, thank you for having me.
1516000	1517000	Hey, no problem.
1517000	1518000	Well, I should start.
1518000	1520000	First off, I have to say thank you very much.
1520000	1525000	You guys may not know this, but behind the scenes, Zircon was actually scheduled to be here last week.
1525000	1527000	And we had to reschedule because I got sick.
1527000	1529000	So I really want to thank you up front for your flexibility.
1529000	1530000	So-
1530000	1532000	Oh, no problem at all, man.
1532000	1533000	Good guy.
1533000	1534000	Good guy, Zircon.
1534000	1538000	How long have you been doing Video Gate?
1538000	1539000	We were talking about this at the opening of the show.
1539000	1542000	You may not know this, but OLR has been around since 2002.
1542000	1544000	We've been doing this show in different forms.
1544000	1546000	And I was like, Zircon may still have beat us.
1546000	1548000	How long have you been working in video games?
1548000	1550000	No, you beat me.
1550000	1551000	You definitely beat me there.
1551000	1560000	I started my first foray into remixing game music in 2003.
1560000	1563000	Now, of course, that was as a rank amateur.
1563000	1566000	So no professional stuff.
1566000	1574000	I think my first paid thing was 2004, and I got paid $15 for writing a song.
1574000	1577000	What was the game it was for?
1577000	1585000	Captain Genia on Shell Island, which you can actually find Let's Plays of that on YouTube with like 50 views, but nonetheless.
1585000	1587000	Hey, that's awesome.
1587000	1592000	If you guys have questions for Zircon, you can always check out our chat room over at live.vognetware.com.
1592000	1596000	We will be asking some of those questions that you guys ask in our chat room too as Zirconists are going through this.
1596000	1602000	So I want to congratulate you. Your Kickstarter, Tangledeep, smashed the goal that you had set.
1602000	1608000	How does it feel to now have the Kickstarter in your rearview mirror at this point?
1608000	1611000	Man, it's blowing my mind.
1611000	1619000	It feels amazing that so many people are excited for the game and are as passionate for it as I am.
1619000	1628000	It's just even more motivation to see people play the game and the backers being excited about it and sending me their ideas is just incredible.
1628000	1633000	And I should say, disclosure, I backed it, so just throwing that out there.
1633000	1635000	Thank you for that.
1635000	1638000	No worries, but I just don't want people going, oh ethics.
1638000	1648000	So anyway, for those that may not have heard of Tangledeep, why don't you give us the little elevator pitch. What is it?
1648000	1660000	Alright, I condensed this very short. Imagine if Squaresoft made a Final Fantasy themed dungeon crawler for the Super Nintendo and that is Tangledeep.
1660000	1662000	I like it.
1662000	1671000	That's the very short version. It's a PC and Mac game. I'm still working on it. It's in development now so it's not out.
1671000	1678000	But yeah, it's a dungeon crawler very much inspired by a lot of my favorite games from the Super Nintendo like Secret of Mana.
1678000	1684000	And art style wise, you definitely see shades of Chrono Trigger in there and games like that.
1684000	1688000	But it's mixed with that sort of roguelike turn-based gameplay.
1688000	1697000	So if you play stuff like Dungeons of Dreadmoor or Crypt of the Necrodancer minus the rhythmic part, you start to get a pretty good idea of what Tangledeep is like.
1697000	1709000	I'm actually really glad you brought up Crypt of the Necrodancer yourself because I wasn't sure if it would have been like, is this going to be offensive if I say when I watched the trailer I totally got a Crypt of the Necrodancer vibe off of it but like a different style of game?
1709000	1722000	No, that game is incredible and I actually had the opportunity. I worked on it a little bit on the music side of things. I mixed the metal version of the soundtrack.
1722000	1729000	So I had a little bit of a hand in it and so I'm a little biased but it really is an incredible game.
1729000	1739000	Now what I thought was interesting about your Kickstarter and what I see as a trend a little bit in 2017, at least I say that because we just had some guys here on our last episode two weeks ago.
1739000	1749000	They made a game called Little Tanks and they did a very similar Kickstarter where they had already kind of done their game and this was what you were doing is that you were doing this game no matter what.
1749000	1759000	Like you've already poured yourself into this game. You're going to make this game happen but you were going to Kickstarter to ask for money to basically put a layer of polish on it. Would that be the way to describe it?
1759000	1760000	Yeah, definitely.
1760000	1770000	So and not only did you make what you asked for but you made twice as much which is allowing you, you're going to have these guest contributors now like several guest musicians, right?
1770000	1777000	And some more fluid art, right? What do we have to look forward to for all this money that's been raised on Kickstarter?
1778000	1793000	So one of the main things that I wanted to do going in was, of course even though I write music myself, I was saying, gee, wouldn't it be awesome if I could actually get as guest composers people that I grew up listening to when I was playing games.
1793000	1802000	So one of the composers was Hiroki Kikuda who is Secret of Mana and Seiken Densetsu 3 are the notable ones from that Super Nintendo period.
1802000	1815000	So he's going to be on board. And then as the Kickstarter was going on and we hit the goal and I was like, oh, I need some stretch goals now because I didn't think it was going to exceed the goal and certainly not that quickly.
1815000	1825000	So Grant Kirkhope who composed many of the rare soundtracks like GoldenEye and Donkey Kong 64 and he's been active ever since.
1826000	1834000	But those two are going to be contributing as composers and there's some other people that I can't announce it yet but that are going to be coming on board.
1834000	1847000	But on the art side, the animations, like you said, put another layer of just fluidity like running animations for all the characters because it's a surprising amount of work when you're doing all this hand-drawn sprite stuff.
1847000	1858000	And the big difference between an 8-bit style game like NES and a 16-bit one, there's just way more colors, there's more sprite resolution.
1858000	1866000	So like the one area of the game, for example, might be 1600 by 900 pixels or something like that which doesn't sound like a lot.
1866000	1876000	That's like one screen, right? On an average size monitor. But then when you think every single one of those pixels is being drawn by hand, it's a huge amount of work.
1876000	1880000	So that's what that money is going to do. It's more polished for the game, like you said.
1880000	1884000	Awesome. Well, congratulations again. Obviously, there's a lot of enthusiasm for it.
1884000	1893000	And if people want to check out the game, you just released your last public build today, right? So people can actually check this out in progress, right?
1893000	1899000	Yeah, absolutely. So the game that all the backers are playing right now, it's the same one that anybody can play even if you didn't back it.
1900000	1906000	If you go to tangledeep.com, there are links on there. And actually, the Kickstarter updates have generally been public.
1906000	1910000	So you can also grab it from the Kickstarter page if you just search for Tangledeep.
1910000	1918000	But yeah, going forward from here, I feel like we've now hit a little over 50% what I consider to be complete on the game.
1918000	1926000	So a lot of the gameplay is there. A lot of the art is there. But at this point on, I feel like it's now starting to get to the point where
1926000	1934000	I want to think about getting it on Steam Early Access so that people that do want to keep following it, but maybe they missed the Kickstarter,
1934000	1940000	but they kind of wanted to wait and see. So that was the big thing with the Kickstarter in general.
1940000	1951000	The reason why I wanted to go on there when I already had a year of work was I think a lot of people, rightfully, feel like they've been burned on Kickstarter projects before.
1951000	1957000	I'm sure a lot of people have backed things that maybe didn't turn out the way they wanted.
1957000	1965000	I definitely don't want to name any specific names, but there have been even high-profile projects that have just not panned out the way people wanted.
1965000	1973000	So I figured I want to really show good faith, and not only here's the playable thing, but I'm going to keep updating it even after the Kickstarter ends
1973000	1979000	so people really get a sense of what this game is about and what it's like to play.
1979000	1987000	Even watching your pitch video, it seemed very clear to me that you knew a lot of what makes people nervous about Kickstarters,
1987000	1994000	and you kind of let your resume be out there and all that. I personally think you kind of hit all the right points where Kickstarter should be in 2017
1994000	1999000	as to why I should give you my money, and I think that speaks to probably why you did so well.
1999000	2009000	Oh, thank you. I definitely want to deliver on everything. I feel like the best way to show, you could have a million credits,
2009000	2016000	but if you just come up with either nothing at all, which has happened before on Kickstarter, stuff just doesn't come out,
2016000	2023000	or if you come up with something bad that hurts everybody's faith in the whole platform. So have something to show. I think that's just super important.
2024000	2030000	Let me take a big step back here and ask you a little bit about, you're very well known for the music that you've done,
2030000	2034000	and you haven't just done OC Remix, even though we've talked a lot about that.
2034000	2038000	Obviously that was a big part of your beginnings, but you went on to actually make music.
2038000	2043000	I know you've done some work with Video Games Live and some of the Kickstarters they've done.
2043000	2047000	I know Soulcalibur V, you've worked with that, and you've worked with some big games.
2047000	2056000	Why now, from making music to making the game, what made you decide, I want to go for something even bigger when it comes to the game?
2056000	2058000	I want to do the game.
2058000	2068000	Man, I've always wanted to do this. What it boils down to, I've always been sort of a tech-minded guy, I guess.
2068000	2078000	Like a lot of gamers, honestly. I got a Game Boy and I loved it, I got a Super Nintendo and I love that.
2078000	2085000	And for as long as I can remember, I was always interested in what it would be like to create my own game.
2085000	2090000	And I never had the tools or the know-how to do it. I didn't apply myself to that, I guess.
2090000	2095000	It was more fun for me to just write it down on paper, that kind of thing.
2095000	2102000	And I dabbled in some kind of simple script-based stuff, so back in the day we had IRC, if anybody remembers that.
2102000	2107000	Our chat room is actually still powered by IRC, basically.
2107000	2109000	Oh, excellent.
2109000	2112000	Some things haven't changed since 2002.
2112000	2118000	Yeah, OC Remix Discord only, I think that was 2016.
2118000	2125000	Yeah, everybody's telling us to change to Slack or Discord at this point, and I'm like, but I like the old one, it's not broken.
2125000	2134000	Yeah, that was our point of view, exactly. But ever since those days, I always wanted to create something.
2134000	2143000	And I have my parents, I think one of the things that sort of pushed me was that my parents recently, last year, sold the house that I grew up in.
2143000	2152000	They gave me a lot of my stuff that it kind of accumulated, that it held onto, and I just had hundreds and hundreds of papers of all these game ideas and everything.
2152000	2161000	And I just thought, you know what, I'm almost 30, I'm 29 right now, I want to just take these steps, I want to do this thing that I've always wanted to do.
2161000	2173000	And just looking back, I could physically see, age seven, I'm actually looking in the corner of my eye, I have a book, it's titled Thinking Up and Drawing Monsters by Andrea Versa.
2173000	2181000	So it's this little school project I did, I guess, but I've always wanted to do this, so I threw myself into it.
2181000	2187000	I'm hung up on something for a minute. You're only 29, and you started this a year after we started doing OLR.
2187000	2191000	You were 16 when you had your first paid gig for music.
2191000	2203000	Yeah, technically yes, and I remember my mom said I couldn't sign the contract, so she signed it for me. It was $15 per track for four tracks.
2203000	2204000	Oh my gosh.
2204000	2208000	Yeah, I'm getting that $60, I can buy three quarters of Chrono Trigger.
2209000	2219000	No, that's amazing though, that's awesome. I was doing public access TV around that same age, and it led to this, so I still don't get a dime for this, but that's alright.
2219000	2233000	I want to ask a little bit about how you got empowered a little bit more as a programmer, because I notice on your website you give tips for people that are interested in getting into music, and I love that.
2233000	2242000	One thing that I really love that has come up on this show a lot in the past year is that if you want to make a game, there's so many tools out there for people to go and do that.
2242000	2246000	Just a month ago we were talking about the indie arcade event here.
2246000	2249000	I tried to do it before you have a family, because they really put a damper on everything.
2249000	2254000	There's a running gag where Loki has an unfinished game here if you want to wear it.
2254000	2262000	Anyway, so you really put together a guide about, hey, if you want to get into doing music, here's some ideas, here's some software, and all that good stuff.
2262000	2268000	But what did you do, what helped you cross over into programming?
2269000	2278000	So what I'll say is that, first of all, I'll feel 100% more confident about answering anything like this once it's done.
2278000	2286000	Even though I have a playable thing, I know I've done some things, but I'll try to answer it anyway.
2287000	2297000	One of the big things, and this is maybe just my personality, but I read a lot about getting into game development.
2297000	2301000	And a lot of people were like, alright, well you've got to start out and you've got to make a simple game.
2301000	2305000	Make Pong, make Space Invaders, make Pac-Man or something like that.
2305000	2311000	And I kept reading it and I just thought to myself, man, I don't want to do that. I just want to make the game that I want to make.
2311000	2313000	I don't want to skip everything.
2313000	2316000	Sorry, go ahead.
2316000	2325000	No, it's just like the thought of having to kind of build up into it was just not appealing to me.
2325000	2331000	And it was the same thing with music. Once I started making music on the computer, it was like, I want to make a Phantasy Star IV remix.
2331000	2335000	I'm just going to do it. It was awful, but I just did it.
2335000	2341000	And so I had sort of a concept in mind when I started out.
2341000	2348000	And everything that I applied myself to in terms of learning, I'm using Unity, which is of course very popular.
2348000	2351000	It's probably like a third of games at least use Unity.
2351000	2361000	I kind of focused on learning Unity within the framework of the specific game I wanted to make.
2361000	2365000	Which is probably not the right way to do it necessarily.
2365000	2369000	But it's extremely satisfying. It's very motivating.
2369000	2374000	So I would say, okay, I know I want to have sprites, so how do I draw a sprite on the screen?
2374000	2381000	Okay, got that. How do I make something that the player can click on pop up on the screen?
2381000	2385000	Because it's a role-playing game, so you need to have menus and stuff. Okay, got that. Next.
2385000	2392000	So if I were kind of taking the approach of, I need to learn everything about programming and Unity from the start,
2392000	2398000	then I'd be learning all this stuff that I wouldn't necessarily apply to this project.
2398000	2401000	Because again, I'm not saying it's necessarily the right way to do it.
2401000	2408000	But taking that piece-by-piece approach and then just iterating over and over like, okay, here's the game, here's a sprite,
2408000	2413000	and now I can move it around. And now there's a monster, and now I can attack the monster, and now the monster moves around too.
2413000	2421000	So doing it step-by-step kept me motivated, and I would just go online, look at a tutorial or something for the next feature that I wanted to do.
2421000	2427000	And then also having people that I could talk to that had Unity experience.
2427000	2430000	And there are some great Discord chats for that.
2430000	2438000	And I have to thank also, there's a friend of mine, Jim Shepherd, who I wrote music for several of his games now.
2438000	2443000	And he's just a master programmer. He's got a long history of AAA experience.
2443000	2447000	And so to be able to talk to him too was a big help anytime I hit a wall.
2447000	2452000	Which of course I would, because I didn't do it in the right order.
2452000	2456000	Well, I've heard, and I'm sorry, I was kind of interrupting you a minute ago, but I was having a laugh,
2456000	2462000	because I've heard the whole, you have to make Pac-Man, you have to make Pong thing as well.
2462000	2464000	And I think that's probably how you have to do it for most people.
2464000	2467000	But I think at the end of the day, you have to do what works for you.
2467000	2470000	And I think even probably Loki would agree to this, which is why I'm laughing,
2470000	2473000	because he almost said the exact same thing on the show not that long ago,
2473000	2477000	is that I can't just do Pac-Man. I have to do what I want to do.
2477000	2482000	Because it's boring. And it's not that it's necessary to finish something,
2482000	2488000	but I was even trying to teach myself the rest of C-Sharp outside of Unity,
2488000	2491000	because I kind of taught myself a little bit of C-Sharp for Unity,
2491000	2493000	but I was like, I wonder how different it is outside of Unity.
2493000	2496000	It's so boring. I just don't want to do it.
2497000	2504000	Exactly. I mean, it's different, I think, if you were doing it in a structured environment,
2504000	2509000	like you're taking a class. I never took any classes in game development or anything like that.
2509000	2512000	When you're teaching yourself, there's so much out there.
2512000	2516000	I just feel like if you're going to devote your nights and weekends,
2516000	2519000	which is what I was doing for a long time with Tangledeep,
2519000	2522000	whatever just little bit of free time I had,
2522000	2528000	I want to show something for it. I don't want to just spend my weekend on this,
2528000	2531000	and then like, hey, I think I didn't want to make.
2531000	2534000	That's just the lowest amount of motivation you could have.
2534000	2538000	Well, I understand your hesitation to talk about all the programming stuff
2538000	2542000	when the game isn't out yet, but look, you've got something out there,
2542000	2546000	and I don't think you're going to jinx yourself at all.
2546000	2553000	I think people will be very happy with the finished product, so congratulations on what you've self-taught
2553000	2559000	and otherwise learned through other people networking with other people you've worked with before.
2559000	2563000	I want to ask you about this before I get to some of our chatter questions
2563000	2567000	because we are, again, taking questions in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
2567000	2570000	Yeah, one of the backers is actually chiming in our chat room right now.
2570000	2574000	Strixel says, backer chiming in that Tangledeep as is is very good and fun.
2574000	2576000	So there's a little reaffirmation for you.
2576000	2577000	Oh, thank you. Thank you.
2577000	2580000	But what I wanted to point out, because I thought this was really cool,
2580000	2583000	is that with the soundtracks and with the music,
2583000	2588000	since that was the bread and butter before game programming,
2588000	2591000	you're going a two-soundtrack approach with this thing,
2591000	2593000	and you can actually check out on SoundCloud.
2593000	2598000	You've got modern, regular orchestral soundtracks,
2598000	2601000	but then you have Super Nintendo-style soundtracks.
2601000	2607000	It's the same soundtrack, but then you kind of redid it in a Super Nintendo music-making program, right?
2607000	2610000	Yeah, so I don't know if my wife is listening to this right now.
2610000	2612000	She might be. She's in the other room right now,
2612000	2616000	so she can probably hear my side of the conversation if she's not actually tuned in.
2616000	2621000	So that's her idea, basically.
2621000	2628000	I want to say that because my initial thought was I just wanted to do it Super Nintendo-style.
2628000	2634000	That was actually because I have such nostalgia for those games,
2634000	2639000	and that's a product of my age and what I grew up playing.
2639000	2642000	But she was kind of listening to what I wrote and saying,
2642000	2646000	she doesn't have the Super Nintendo nostalgia. They had a Genesis.
2646000	2650000	And so she was thinking, I don't have any connection to these sounds.
2650000	2653000	And a lot of other people don't. Anybody younger, they're not going to have the same connection.
2653000	2657000	She was like, you should take this, and you should make it into a modern soundtrack.
2657000	2661000	And at first I was like, oh, I don't know. It's going to be more work.
2661000	2666000	But then when I actually tried it and took the main dungeon theme and I started doing it,
2666000	2674000	and I started adding some live parts in too, I was like, wow, actually, this really is a good idea.
2674000	2677000	So I really have to thank her for that suggestion.
2677000	2683000	And yeah, I'm going to do it for the whole soundtrack with the order of starting with the Super Nintendo stuff
2683000	2687000	and doing it authentically like that, and it's all general MIDI.
2687000	2693000	No fancy samples or anything like that. And then taking it and blowing it up into the modern production.
2693000	2695000	So that's the workflow.
2695000	2699000	Well, Jill is listening. She's in chat, so we were able to give her a big blow there.
2699000	2704000	But that's a neat story because I would have assumed for some reason,
2704000	2707000	I mean, again, I would have assumed it went the other way around,
2707000	2712000	that the modern was first and then it kind of was deconstructed to Super Nintendo.
2712000	2715000	But that's really interesting that it actually is the other way. That's really cool.
2715000	2719000	So let me get to some of our, I know we're getting to our time here,
2719000	2722000	but I want to get to a few listener questions over at live.vognetwork.com.
2722000	2726000	Let me get to this question. I love this question from SSG100Matt who asks,
2726000	2732000	do you plan to come back and or perform at MAGFest?
2732000	2739000	I definitely am going to be at MAGFest. I've been going for, I don't know, like seven years now.
2739000	2744000	And I don't normally do any kind of live performance stuff. It's usually not my thing.
2744000	2750000	But Ocean's Andrew, OA, who is a remixer on OCR and Judge,
2750000	2754000	and he's Overclock University is part of that as well.
2754000	2758000	And also he happens to be the environmental and UI artist for Tanglebeef.
2758000	2761000	So it's like a lot of connections to him.
2761000	2765000	He has roped me into some sort of DJ set at MAGFest.
2765000	2768000	So I don't know exactly what I'm going to be doing for that,
2768000	2773000	but I will have a DJ set ready and I'll be doing something.
2773000	2778000	I will be sure to check it out. You know, I actually, thanks to some of our listeners here at OLR,
2778000	2782000	I got tuned on to go into MAGFest. I went for my second year this last January.
2782000	2786000	I had a blast. Like it's just a great call. I flew from California to go.
2786000	2789000	Like I know we're getting our own version, but it's not going to be the same.
2789000	2793000	Like I shouldn't say that. I really shouldn't say it, but it's not going to be the same as the DC one.
2793000	2796000	You know, that's an amazing convention. I'm really...
2796000	2799000	Yeah, I can't recommend it enough. It's so cool.
2799000	2802000	Yeah, and hopefully the West Coast one does get a lot of the same vibe.
2802000	2807000	I definitely will go and check it out for sure, but there's something about the Prime site.
2807000	2814000	Anyway, I want to go to another chat comment from Strixel here at live.vognetwork.com who says,
2814000	2817000	What drew you to roguelikes?
2817000	2820000	Oh, that's a great question.
2820000	2832000	So, Roguelikes, that's been a genre favorite of mine for a long time,
2832000	2836000	because ever since Castle of the Winds on PC,
2836000	2842000	and I was just thinking about that because Jim Shepherd, Dungeon Man,
2842000	2845000	who I just mentioned, that was an inspiration for him as well,
2845000	2848000	like the Castle of the Winds, and that's been around for a long, long time.
2849000	2855000	And I've always liked that genre because I guess I'm the kind of person
2855000	2862000	that will tend to memorize and kind of play a little more the optimal way if I can.
2862000	2866000	So in other words, if I play the same level a million times,
2866000	2870000	go for the fastest route, go for the best build, I kind of just gravitate towards that.
2870000	2875000	And roguelikes really make it much harder to do that because everything is procedurally generated,
2875000	2878000	it's adding that extra layer of challenge, and it's always engaging
2878000	2881000	because you can't just rely on memory every time,
2881000	2885000	because so much of it is randomly generated.
2885000	2890000	So that is the big thing that drew me into it ever since the days of Castle of the Winds,
2890000	2894000	which I think you can play for free now, actually, and it's still a good game.
2894000	2897000	It definitely doesn't look too good, but it's still a great game.
2897000	2900000	Yeah, I remember the original actual Rogue.
2900000	2903000	I think it was a cartridge, maybe a disc on my Commodore 64.
2903000	2907000	We had the actual game Rogue. I think Epyx published it for a time there.
2907000	2912000	And if you guys out there, if you've never played the original old-school Rogue,
2912000	2914000	it's still worth a look.
2914000	2918000	You might kind of be turned off by the fact that it's just like ASCII art,
2918000	2923000	there's no real graphics, but you see where that comes from,
2923000	2926000	where all these other games have been birthed because of this classic.
2926000	2928000	It's really something.
2928000	2933000	Anyway, Zircon, I really want to thank you for taking the time out to be on our show this week.
2933000	2936000	I want to wish you the best of luck with Tangledeep and its release,
2936000	2940000	which is targeted for December this year, right?
2940000	2944000	Yeah, and I do not intend on missing that.
2944000	2947000	I'm working very hard to make sure that we hit that.
2947000	2949000	Everything is kind of scoped and planned around it,
2949000	2952000	and I went out of my way to make sure that with Kickstarter,
2952000	2954000	I was so tempted to say things like,
2954000	2958000	I'm going to do a world map, and I'm going to do ten new features,
2958000	2963000	but I've got to stick to the scope that I have in mind
2963000	2966000	so that it does not go over time, and we get it out this year.
2966000	2970000	Well, yeah, you even had your little project plan out there
2970000	2972000	for everybody to look at on the Kickstarter.
2972000	2974000	I did. We'll see how badly I missed it.
2974000	2976000	Oh, stop, stop. I'm sure we'll be fine.
2976000	2979000	If people want to follow the progress, I know Twitter is a good spot.
2979000	2984000	The game is at Tangledeepgame, is the Twitter that they can follow.
2984000	2987000	Your personal Twitter, should I give that out, too, for following?
2987000	2989000	Yeah, absolutely, yeah, at zirconst.
2989000	2993000	Awesome. Any other websites or things we need to plug while you're here?
2993000	2999000	If you go to tangledeep.com, I forget if I don't have the link,
2999000	3002000	I'll have it up there tonight, but we actually have a Discord chat,
3002000	3005000	which is cool. It's a general chat about the game.
3005000	3007000	I post builds and stuff.
3007000	3010000	Sometimes I stream game development on Twitch,
3010000	3014000	and there's also a place where you can report bugs or talk about balance.
3014000	3017000	It's pretty active, actually, and Strix is in there.
3017000	3021000	Yeah, it's cool. If that link is not on the site, it will be soon.
3021000	3023000	All right, awesome.
3023000	3025000	Again, Zircon, I want to thank you for being on the show,
3025000	3028000	and I'll be looking forward to Tangledeep this December,
3028000	3031000	and I'll be looking forward to MAGFest 2018 as well.
3031000	3034000	All right, sounds good, and thank you for having me.
3034000	3036000	Hey, no problem. You take care.
3036000	3038000	All right, bye-bye.
3038000	3041000	All right, that is Zircon from the game Tangledeep,
3041000	3044000	but also the long career of music making
3044000	3047000	that goes all the way back to OC Remix
3047000	3051000	and moving on to commercial releases like Soulcalibur V.
3051000	3054000	I mean, the man's just done a lot when it comes to video game music,
3054000	3058000	and now getting on the other end of the rest of the game development.
3058000	3060000	I know he has some help, too.
3060000	3062000	I didn't give him a chance to...
3062000	3064000	Well, he shouted out one of his art guys,
3064000	3066000	two other people he's working with, to make that game happen,
3066000	3068000	and wishing them much, much success,
3068000	3071000	and you guys will have to keep an eye on that
3071000	3073000	and check out that game when it releases.
3073000	3075000	All right, well, speaking of checking out games,
3075000	3078000	we like to... Again, this is a three-hour show, y'all.
3078000	3080000	We still got some news to get into for the week.
3080000	3082000	I want to get into, of course, though, a little bit about
3082000	3084000	how are the games that you've been playing this week,
3084000	3087000	as a little bit of a frame of the reference here at the top of the show.
3087000	3089000	Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?
3089000	3091000	It was moderately eventful.
3091000	3093000	I've been playing...
3093000	3098000	I beat, during the last two weeks, I beat Mass Effect Andromeda,
3098000	3104000	and I am on my second play-through, aiming for 100% play-through on that one.
3104000	3108000	I went back to World of Warcraft since the new patch for Legion came out,
3108000	3114000	and I've been a little disappointed with how few world quests there have been,
3114000	3124000	because I'm really trying to get the Revered for my faction so that I can fly.
3124000	3130000	And so I'll finish the quest in an hour, and I'm like, okay, where's more?
3130000	3132000	But there's one thing I can't do, because it's a solo fight
3132000	3137000	that's clearly something that should have been done for five people, so whatever.
3138000	3144000	Other than that, Miitomo, Pokemon Go,
3144000	3147000	although I haven't been able to do a lot of walking with it since...
3147000	3149000	I'm supposed to be wearing a boot.
3149000	3150000	Das Boot.
3150000	3152000	A walking boot. It's called Das Boot.
3152000	3156000	I told Dan the other day that I could probably smite my enemies with that boot.
3156000	3160000	Fantas in our chat wants to know, is Mass Effect Andromeda worth 100%ing?
3160000	3165000	Yeah, I think it is, because I missed quite a few things on my first play-through
3165000	3167000	that I kind of wish I had gone back and gotten.
3167000	3171000	There's actually even a few quests that I think you can't go back and do
3171000	3173000	if you've missed them the first time around.
3173000	3177000	I had the thing forum on my journal, but I couldn't find the points to do it.
3177000	3179000	It just wasn't showing up on the map.
3179000	3181000	And maybe they'll patch that again.
3181000	3186000	The last patch actually did quite a bit, at least for the aesthetics of the game.
3186000	3189000	There's some people who still walk kind of funny,
3189000	3192000	but for the most part, it's been pretty good.
3192000	3195000	I've hit a weird wall with Mass Effect Andromeda.
3195000	3199000	I didn't beat it, and I don't want to say I'm uninspired,
3199000	3203000	but I've just been allowing myself to get distracted with other games,
3203000	3205000	and I'm like, I'll come back to Andromeda.
3205000	3208000	It sounds like they have a few more things I kind of want to work on,
3208000	3210000	so I'm not really in a rush to beat it.
3210000	3212000	My only thing is I want to avoid spoilers,
3212000	3215000	but I know you're good enough you're not going to spoil it.
3215000	3217000	Shane knows I'll kick his ass if he spoils it.
3217000	3222000	Otherwise, I'm kind of like, I'll take my time,
3222000	3225000	and I'll get around to beating it eventually when it's kind of all patched up.
3225000	3228000	But I feel like I might have painted myself into a corner a little bit
3228000	3230000	because I'm not getting any of the loyalty missions,
3230000	3233000	and I'm understanding I'm kind of close to the end of the game.
3233000	3238000	Make sure that you select the journals for the characters,
3238000	3242000	and it'll give you what you're waiting on or what to do next.
3242000	3246000	That really, really helped me because there's a lot of them
3246000	3253000	that require a certain event to happen before the next string of the loyalty mission.
3253000	3261000	And I did all the loyalty missions before doing the Archon ship mission.
3261000	3265000	And it'll actually say Archon ship mission, so it's not a spoiler.
3265000	3269000	But I did them all before that because I thought that was the big thing,
3269000	3271000	and it wasn't the big thing.
3271000	3273000	But you can get them done pretty quickly.
3273000	3277000	Okay. Okay. I think I've actually done the Archon ship
3277000	3280000	and still don't have them unlocked, so that's the thing that's concerning me.
3280000	3282000	Were Salarians involved?
3282000	3286000	Yes. Yes, they were. Yes, they were. Okay.
3286000	3288000	So then you still have time to do them.
3288000	3291000	Interesting. Okay. I'll go back at some point,
3291000	3292000	but I'll talk about my gaming week in a minute here.
3292000	3294000	I've just been distracted with other stuff, and it's like,
3294000	3296000	Mass Effect Andromeda will be there tomorrow.
3296000	3299000	I don't have to rush to beat it in a week.
3299000	3301000	I've got bedding. Oh, sorry.
3301000	3303000	Am I putting you to sleep with my Mass Effect?
3303000	3307000	No, I'm on allergy meds because of all the pollen and shit that's kicked in.
3307000	3315000	But I will say this, that it's a lot easier now to make a decent-looking character.
3315000	3318000	I know why they did all the presets.
3318000	3322000	I mean, I'm pretty sure it's because it affects the way that, you know,
3322000	3326000	Daddy Rider looks, but still.
3326000	3327000	Okay. Yeah.
3327000	3329000	Well, if that's it for your gaming week, let me go to Loki.
3329000	3331000	How was your gaming week?
3331000	3333000	Well, I played a few different things.
3333000	3336000	I played a little bit more Skyrim. Not that much.
3336000	3339000	I finished the quest line I was on, so that's done.
3339000	3344000	And then I played a little bit more of Thimbleweed Park, which is fun.
3344000	3348000	It's like that old LucasArts adventure game style type of game,
3348000	3351000	because it's done by the people that did that.
3351000	3356000	And I'm enjoying it, so that's pretty fun.
3356000	3360000	And then I got sucked into another idol clicker game.
3360000	3362000	Oh, Jesus.
3362000	3364000	This one, I don't know, it's somewhat entertaining.
3364000	3366000	It's pretty relaxing.
3366000	3371000	It's Office Space Idol Profits or something like that.
3371000	3374000	Obviously, it's a license from the movie, and the whole thing is-
3374000	3376000	Oh, it's legit. Oh.
3376000	3379000	Yeah, the whole thing is based off of just planting your virus
3379000	3384000	in all the different floors in the building and you extracting pennies.
3384000	3386000	You know I finally broke up with clicker heroes on PS4.
3386000	3389000	Like, I'm done. And you know what did it?
3389000	3395000	I spent 80 hero souls on accident by hitting the wrong damn button on the screen.
3395000	3398000	And I was like, fuck this, I'm out.
3398000	3400000	That's finally what shut it down for me.
3400000	3402000	Yeah, I never really got into it.
3402000	3405000	You can't undo stuff like that. That pissed me off.
3405000	3409000	Yeah, I tried it a little bit and I was just like, eh, I'm not really into this.
3409000	3412000	But, yeah, so I've been playing that a little bit.
3412000	3414000	And then, of course, Pokémon Go, just the daily stuff.
3414000	3416000	I hit 26 the other day.
3416000	3417000	Congrats.
3417000	3421000	Just playing, you know, five minutes here, five minutes there.
3421000	3424000	I mean, I don't know. Not that gung ho into it.
3424000	3429000	But I'm not playing Ingress, so, you know, it's something.
3429000	3433000	And what else? Oh, I did pick up Everything,
3433000	3437000	which is some weird, like, artsy game that has really bad animation for their animals.
3437000	3439000	And I thought that was funny. And only because of that.
3439000	3443000	And I actually did try to play, there was another game called Epic Battle Simulator
3443000	3446000	that does not run on my computer at all.
3446000	3450000	I tried to play it and it's just like, my computer's like, what the fuck are you trying to do with me here?
3450000	3453000	I can't run this shit. I'm too old.
3453000	3456000	So, I was going to play that, though, because that's funny.
3458000	3462000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,
3462000	3464000	use the passphrase, meet.
3464000	3466000	Alright, is that it for gaming week?
3466000	3467000	That's it.
3467000	3470000	Well, then I will talk about my gaming week here briefly.
3470000	3474000	So, yeah, like I said, I haven't been playing as much Mass Effect Andromeda.
3474000	3477000	Still been playing, of course, Final Fantasy XIV.
3477000	3480000	Here's the other game I randomly, and I mean randomly, just got back into,
3480000	3484000	and that is playing Diablo III, but specifically on PlayStation 4.
3484000	3488000	Do you guys remember, like, two and a half years ago, I think it was, I said,
3488000	3490000	I'm going to platinum this damn game.
3490000	3494000	And then, of course, because Rob can't ever, like, I have the worst gamer ADD in the world,
3494000	3497000	I can't ever stick with one game, I never got around to platinuming it.
3497000	3502000	Well, okay, I haven't platinumed it yet, but I'm really, I have two trophies left to go.
3502000	3507000	So, I actually, I got my hardcore character to 70, and I picked up some other trophies that I needed.
3507000	3513000	The last ones I have to get are, get all six classes to level 70, which sounds hard,
3513000	3518000	but once you get the experience gem from running greater rifts, and level it to 25,
3518000	3523000	it's actually, like, my Crusader, I leveled to level 51 in, like, a night, so it's, like, super easy.
3523000	3526000	Like, and when I say a night, I mean, like, an hour and a half.
3526000	3531000	So, that part's going to be easy. The 500 bounties is the part that's going to kill me,
3531000	3535000	because I'm only up to, like, 240 right now, maybe, so that's, like, not even half.
3535000	3538000	So, I just have to do bounties, bounties, and more bounties.
3538000	3543000	But it looks like it's in reach, and so I actually will finally platinum this damn game, knock on wood,
3543000	3546000	if I don't get distracted by something shiny in the next couple weeks.
3546000	3549000	I will finally platinum this damn game about three years after I said I would.
3549000	3551000	So, there you go.
3551000	3555000	One of the games I checked out this week, I checked out Puyo Puyo Tetris,
3555000	3558000	which is now on the Nintendo Switch, and that's where I checked this game out.
3558000	3562000	I know it's been out on PS4 and some other places for a while,
3562000	3565000	and I was a little slower to get around to it, plus I wanted to, you know, I liked the whole,
3565000	3570000	it's on the TV, no, now I can play it in bed, or wherever my Switch is.
3570000	3577000	So, yeah, I mean, the story is, like, it's kind of nonexistent, it's just, it's anime trash.
3577000	3582000	And I don't, I'm not calling all anime trash, I'm saying this specifically is anime trash.
3582000	3585000	But that's fine, like, sometimes you live for a bad movie,
3585000	3589000	and I think some people are getting their memes and stuff off of this game,
3589000	3591000	and that's fine, there's a lot of silly stuff.
3591000	3596000	But when it comes down to it, there's a very competent just, like, base Tetris mode that you can play,
3596000	3599000	or a base Puyo Puyo mode that you can play,
3599000	3602000	and it's like you get both those games in one package and it's cool.
3602000	3606000	And yes, they did some interesting little things where they actually have a mode
3606000	3609000	that involves Tetris blocks and Puyo Puyo at the same time,
3609000	3612000	and it's like the blocks push through the Puyos,
3612000	3617000	so you can kind of, like, you can cause a delay trick where the Puyos will come back.
3617000	3619000	So it's like you're playing both games at the same time.
3619000	3622000	It's complicated, but it's kind of fun.
3622000	3627000	So I like that it's different, but that you can also just play Tetris or Puyo Puyo if you want.
3627000	3633000	When I got it for PlayStation 4, Dan and I would, I would pick the Puyo side, he would pick the Tetris side.
3633000	3637000	Yeah, and you can do that, and you can still send each other lines and trash.
3637000	3643000	It was really fun. I mean, he was, we were pretty on equal footing because I'm really,
3643000	3647000	I mean, I used to be really good at Puyo Puyo, I'm out of practice, but it's a fun game.
3647000	3652000	You know, I just was really surprised that they took so long to bring it out in the US.
3652000	3655000	It's been out, like, three years already, to my recollection.
3655000	3658000	Well, they don't do Puyo games very often here.
3658000	3660000	We got quite a few of them.
3660000	3665000	I know they did Kirby's Avalanche and all that stuff back in the day, but I mean, Puyo Puyo games as Puyo Puyo.
3665000	3672000	We had Puyo Pop, which was Puyo Puyo, and we had, um, there were a couple of other Puyo Puyo games that came out over here.
3672000	3674000	It just feels like we don't get as many as they do over there, but anyway.
3674000	3677000	We even got the little Puyolin, the little handheld LCD toy.
3677000	3681000	They're probably, they're probably, it's probably more prevalent now than it was 10 years ago.
3681000	3688000	But anyway, I had a similar thing. I was playing actually online against a friend of mine who can kind of murder people at Tetris.
3688000	3694000	I was not ready for him getting, like, seven Tetrises in a row. I shit you not, like, he can do that.
3694000	3696000	And I was like, oh god.
3696000	3703000	But when I was playing Puyo, and he was playing Tetris, he can't, he doesn't, he's still learning Puyo, so he can't set up the chains in Puyo.
3703000	3708000	Whereas I know enough to actually set up very basic two and three chains in Puyo.
3708000	3711000	So we had a match that went on a little while.
3711000	3716000	Still, he killed me because I, you just can't compete with somebody that can get Tetris after Tetris after Tetris.
3716000	3720000	But it was still fun. And the online mode actually worked, so there's that.
3720000	3726000	I've also been playing Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, which just came out on the Switch a couple days ago.
3726000	3730000	Since it just came out a couple days ago, excuse me, I'm still getting over the cold.
3730000	3735000	Since it just came out a couple days ago, I haven't had the chance to spend a lot of time with it.
3735000	3740000	But I will just say this, it does look gorgeous on the Switch's, like, built-in screen.
3740000	3746000	Like, that little HD screen with the Switch is just, like, it's so bright and vibrant and pops.
3746000	3748000	Like, it's really cool.
3748000	3751000	And I'm really looking forward to meeting up with some other people who have it,
3751000	3754000	so we can all kind of play Mario Kart in the wireless mode.
3754000	3756000	So, that'll be fun.
3756000	3761000	I'm hoping to also play a little bit after tonight's show, which, to follow up this comment in chat,
3761000	3763000	come on, CupidBoy in chat says,
3763000	3765000	Rob Roberts, why don't you Twitch much?
3766000	3771000	For one, I kind of have to, like, when I do a Twitch, I don't want to just play the game.
3771000	3774000	I want to be lively and talk about it and talk with people.
3774000	3778000	And sometimes you kind of have to, you know, that takes a little bit of extrovertedness,
3778000	3783000	and sometimes I just want to not have that for a night, so I don't always want to stream.
3783000	3787000	But also, this is the other big reason, I really wanted to do some more streaming this past week,
3787000	3789000	but then I got sick.
3789000	3792000	So, I've been sick for, like, the past, like, I'm not even kidding, week and a half.
3792000	3797000	Like, it's just now finally leaving, so that's been a big stopper for that, too.
3797000	3803000	But I will be doing Mario Kart 8 tonight after the show at twitch.tv slash Rob Roberts,
3803000	3804000	so you can follow me over there.
3804000	3808000	I will be doing that tonight as an OLR post-show, so there's that.
3808000	3810000	I guess that's really everything I wanted to talk about this week.
3810000	3813000	I feel like there was one more game I wanted to mention,
3813000	3816000	but I guess if I think of it later, I'll mention it later.
3816000	3819000	But those have been the games I've been taking up most of my time.
3819000	3822000	So, some quick housekeeping.
3822000	3829000	There will be no show on June 25th, I think is the date.
3829000	3831000	I'm trying to remember what Sunday is near there.
3831000	3833000	I'm actually going to be out of town.
3833000	3838000	I realize I'm well aware that falls right around the anniversary of Orange Lounge Radio.
3838000	3845000	We will be celebrating 15 years of Orange Lounge Radio on June 18th will be the big show.
3845000	3848000	And the reward for 15 years of Orange Lounge Radio?
3848000	3851000	A week off without being sick.
3851000	3853000	A week off for vacation purposes.
3853000	3855000	That will be the big reward.
3855000	3858000	I'm going to be going to Chicago to visit some friends and taking Alan out there,
3858000	3860000	so I'll be having a good time.
3860000	3863000	And hopefully Dark Soccer and Loki will have some fun around here.
3863000	3864000	But that's still a couple months off.
3864000	3868000	That's our next planned show off June 18th.
3868000	3872000	Excuse me, June 25th, because June 18th will be such a big show.
3872000	3874000	15 years of OLR, if you can believe it.
3874000	3876000	I need to get a pretty dress.
3876000	3877000	A key senior address?
3877000	3880000	Why not? I'll go to the thrift store and get something out of the 80s.
3880000	3884000	Should we? Do I want to commit ourselves to this?
3884000	3887000	Alright, fuck it. I'm just going to put it out there. We'll do it live.
3887000	3895000	Do we want to bring back a video camera for June 18th and do the show on Twitch as a special little here we are?
3895000	3896000	Maybe.
3896000	3898000	Oh, that's some progress out of Dark Soccer.
3898000	3899000	I'll stay off camera.
3899000	3900000	Alright.
3900000	3902000	You can look at my dress.
3902000	3904000	You need to go full on nunnery.
3904000	3907000	No, because I'm not a novice yet.
3907000	3909000	Okay, I guess you can. Alright.
3909000	3912000	Yeah, I can only manifest when I am with my big sister.
3912000	3914000	I see. Alright. Well, maybe.
3914000	3920000	And for those who don't know, I am a postulant as a sister of Perpetual Indulgence.
3920000	3921000	So, look it up.
3921000	3923000	Clap, clap, clap.
3923000	3928000	Okay, well, aside from that, you could do full on BioQueen drag, though, if you wanted, right?
3928000	3929000	That's not against the rules.
3929000	3932000	You know what? I will channel Valentina.
3932000	3934000	You can beat your face for the gods.
3934000	3938000	For the record. You saw the last episode, right?
3938000	3939000	Yes.
3939000	3942000	I loved her lack of outfit. Just saying.
3942000	3943000	It was brilliant.
3943000	3944000	That was inspired.
3944000	3949000	You will have to come on reading is fundamental to talk about that, but we got to get back to video games.
3949000	3950000	Valentina.
3950000	3955000	Alright, let's talk about video games. We got to get into gaming news this week. Loki, start us off.
3955000	3965000	Well, Nintendo announced, because they don't have unlimited resources, that they're going to put out yet another system that no one asked for.
3965000	3971000	So, Nintendo announced that they're going to be releasing a 2DS XL system for $149.99.
3971000	3974000	It's going to be available on July 28th.
3974000	3981000	Unlike the original 2DS, it's in a clamshell form factor, so it's like an actual DS.
3981000	3985000	Just not 3D.
3985000	3989000	But it's got all the new 3DS hardware inside.
3989000	3996000	The 2DS thing doesn't actually really bug me because a lot of games are kind of forgoing that these days anyway.
3996000	4001000	Like, you know, Pokemon Sun and Moon is probably the biggest 3DS game still right now.
4001000	4005000	And only one small portion of that game uses 3D at all.
4005000	4012000	It's the whole, I don't even remember what they call the mode, but it's the Pokemon Snap ripoff that they put into Sun and Moon.
4012000	4015000	You can actually use 3D there, and that's really the only thing that uses it.
4015000	4021000	But it's a new 3DS, but in 2D.
4021000	4024000	But it's that whole, the word new.
4024000	4032000	So it will play all those new exclusives like Super Nintendo games and Xenoblade.
4032000	4035000	And there might be one other I'm not thinking of.
4035000	4039000	So I have to admit, there's a part of me that's just kind of like, eh?
4039000	4051000	Again, my good old 3DS Triforce edition, I love my gold 3DS, 3DS XL from several years ago is working fine, and I see no need to replace it.
4051000	4054000	And there is nothing here that is screaming to me.
4054000	4058000	I mean, I like the fact that they ripped off the colors of the dress.
4058000	4062000	You remember the infamous dress that's black and blue, or is it gold and white?
4062000	4064000	I can't tell what color.
4064000	4068000	Well, this one is black and turquoise specifically.
4068000	4070000	There is a gold and white one as well.
4070000	4073000	So the two SKUs are the two colors of that infamous dress.
4073000	4074000	I don't know if you got that.
4074000	4075000	I did not.
4075000	4076000	But I'm like, wow.
4076000	4078000	Is that only in Japan that they're doing that?
4078000	4081000	Because they said there's only one color option here, and that's just the black and turquoise.
4081000	4083000	Oh, then maybe it is Japan that's doing it.
4083000	4087000	Well, Japan's getting a frickin' metal slime one as well that looks awesome.
4087000	4088000	I don't know if you saw that.
4088000	4090000	That one looks awesome.
4090000	4094000	I'm not sure what this is for?
4094000	4101000	Because, again, if it's a budget thing, I get that, but there's a $99 2DS still on the market.
4101000	4102000	$79, actually.
4102000	4106000	Okay, it doesn't fold up and go in your pocket, okay.
4106000	4113000	But still, I'm like, if you're going for a budget option, usually those sorts of things, you know, you're not going to pay what now?
4113000	4116000	It's $50 less, so if you're basically...
4116000	4125000	I don't understand the point of that because it's like you basically said, okay, listen, we're not putting out 3D in our games,
4125000	4128000	but here's a system that doesn't do the 3D for $50 less.
4128000	4133000	They're almost like competing against themselves.
4134000	4136000	Why does none of this make any sense?
4136000	4141000	I know they're still kind of pushing this too, especially after watching the last Nintendo Direct.
4141000	4144000	They still, you know, they have these Kirby things.
4144000	4148000	They have the Pikmin thing, Cold Sept, which I can't hang on. I love that series.
4148000	4150000	You know, they are still trying...
4150000	4155000	But there's also a part of me that's like, just go full tilt boogie on Switch right now.
4155000	4156000	Don't get me wrong.
4156000	4162000	Pikmin's a fun game, but how many games in the Pikmin series have we had and how many F-Zero games have we had recently?
4163000	4165000	I mean, or Metroid games?
4165000	4170000	I love my 3DS. I'm just not convinced this is...
4170000	4175000	You know, again, I was not convinced ever to upgrade to the new 3DS.
4175000	4182000	This, taking the 3D out and making it a little cheaper is still not convincing me to get rid of the 3DS I have.
4182000	4188000	Like, I don't have a 3DS or a new 3DS. I mean, this looks cool. I'm not buying one.
4188000	4195000	Yeah, I was gonna say, if you don't have a 3DS at all whatsoever in any form,
4195000	4201000	there is a huge library of games you're missing out on that you, you know, it's time to just get one and...
4201000	4203000	I don't think so, Ian. Here's why.
4203000	4207000	Because they have a portable system as well called the Nintendo Switch,
4207000	4214000	and I'm very hesitant with Nintendo's track record to trust anything is gonna last forever.
4214000	4219000	So, that's why I'm not jumping on board with this brand new system that they're coming out with,
4219000	4223000	because who the fuck knows when this whole shit was gonna get discontinued?
4223000	4229000	I mean, I'm not, at this point, like I haven't jumped into the 3DS, I'm probably not going to.
4229000	4234000	I mean, that's it. If there was something that I was gonna, you know, it would be worth it,
4234000	4236000	and then I would have done it a long time ago.
4236000	4241000	But, you know what, there's people out there I see on Twitter and stuff that are all excited about this system
4241000	4245000	and loving the colors, they're gonna pick it up, so you know, more power to you, good, you know,
4245000	4247000	I hope you have fun with it, hope it's worth it for you.
4247000	4249000	What if some people pick up everything Nintendo puts out?
4249000	4254000	Yeah, I'm just kind of like, but if you already have a 3DS, especially if you have a new 3DS already,
4254000	4261000	it's like, what is this, you're gonna get this for the colors, and I don't know, I don't get it as much,
4261000	4268000	but it's your money, you buy what you want, you go on with yourself, it's fine, but I will be passing.
4268000	4274000	Unless, you know what, maybe Nintendo at E3 is gonna come out and say, listen up fuckers,
4274000	4280000	the 2DS, that's exactly how Reggie's gonna phrase it, listen up fuckers, 2DS ain't dead,
4280000	4285000	because guess what, we got a new 2D Metroid game coming out on the 2DS this year.
4285000	4290000	I'm gonna be like, really pissed on one hand, but at the same hand I'm gonna be like,
4290000	4295000	ah, you sons of bitches, here's my money, take it, take it, here's more money, take it,
4295000	4300000	take it, what, a special Samus 3DS, fine, take that too, here's my money, enjoy it.
4300000	4301000	Right.
4301000	4302000	That's all it's gonna take.
4302000	4309000	Well, you know what, I stand corrected that there was a Metroid game that got released,
4309000	4314000	how could I forget that there was a Metroid game, oh maybe because it doesn't fucking look like Metroid at all.
4314000	4315000	We don't count.
4315000	4316000	Stupid Federation Force, I mean.
4316000	4318000	We don't count that, that didn't happen.
4318000	4319000	That's a pretty good imagination.
4319000	4323000	Garbage, absolute garbage, I don't trust them one bit.
4324000	4325000	Alright, hey.
4325000	4330000	Hey, we got a new F-Zero game, it's called F-Zero, fuck you, we're not giving you a good game.
4330000	4336000	It's slow ass cars, they're snails now, Super Snails, it's F-Zero, it's fucking snails racing.
4336000	4346000	Like it or not, and I'm in the not camp, I do believe Mario Kart is Nintendo's all-in racer at this point.
4347000	4353000	Especially with all the other Nintendo properties they're bringing in, I feel like a new F-Zero game just ain't happening.
4353000	4359000	I would love to be proven wrong more than anything in the world, but I'm done getting my hopes up.
4359000	4365000	Alright, well here's a game that I think would make me very excited for a 2DS or a 3DS if it happened over there,
4365000	4371000	although I'd rather see it on Switch, but it's something you could actually play on PC right now, at least until they take it down.
4371000	4379000	This is a user on itch.io named Winter Drake, who has done a game called Breath of the Ness.
4379000	4386000	That's right, it's the Zelda game, Breath of the Wild, but as a 2D adventure. Does that sound familiar?
4386000	4392000	Yeah, that's right, because game developers conference this year, Nintendo had a panel and the developers behind Zelda
4392000	4397000	were talking about how they originally developed Breath of the Wild in a 2D format with some of the features,
4397000	4404000	like dynamic weather, destructible objects, some of the things that actually ended up in the game when it hit its 3D form.
4404000	4411000	So of course, somebody stepped up to the challenge and said, I wonder what this would look like as a real game.
4411000	4419000	So they made this game. There's a trailer that you're able to look at where you can actually topple trees on enemies,
4419000	4426000	lure them into dangerous spikes and so on. It has a lot of the elements from Breath of the Wild but in the more 2D format.
4426000	4433000	So you can check that out again on itch.io, but tomorrow is Monday, that's probably when the lawyers are back in
4433000	4439000	and the cease and desist will be headed over to this person. The demo is free, you don't have to pay for it.
4439000	4443000	Nintendo is probably going to end up shutting it down though, so get it while you can.
4443000	4448000	But you know what they say, once it's on the internet, it's forever on the internet.
4448000	4455000	So yeah, that might be worth a look, because I'm sure if you're interested in this, you've already bought Breath of the Wild,
4455000	4460000	the regular version. If you haven't, you're missing the hell out, because it's one of the...
4460000	4461000	I need to play that some more.
4461000	4464000	It's a fantastic... I need to finish it, really.
4464000	4467000	They picked up some new Wii U games this week from my kid.
4467000	4468000	Oh yeah?
4468000	4478000	I picked up Super Mario 3D World and Pokken Tournament, because he's bitching that he doesn't have enough games to play.
4478000	4484000	Oh, and guess what? The wonders of doing a live show, this is coming through in the chat room right now.
4484000	4488000	This looks like this just broke a few hours ago.
4488000	4493000	Let's see, here it is. There was a tweet that says, from Winter Drake,
4493000	4499000	I'm no longer legally able to distribute Breath of the NES, but any donations you made will be spent working on the game.
4499000	4504000	The game isn't dead, I just won't be using the Zelda characters, it will live on.
4504000	4508000	That's right, it was ordered, taken down by Nintendo.
4508000	4510000	I'm so shocked.
4510000	4515000	Shock and awe, but there it is. The tweets are up there.
4515000	4520000	Oh, the Cease and Desist letter is even posted there for your perusal.
4520000	4526000	If you want to release something like this to the internet, release it as a goddamn torrent on a torrent site,
4526000	4529000	because what the fuck are they going to do there?
4529000	4533000	Well, it's an interesting thing, because there's a part of me that says,
4533000	4540000	he should have just from the beginning used the non-Zelda sprites that he's going to obviously change this into now.
4540000	4546000	He's just going to change all the sprites so that it's a completely different looking type of game, but it's still the same idea.
4546000	4551000	But at the same time, if he had done that in the very beginning, he wouldn't have gotten all this press.
4551000	4558000	So, I don't know, there's no easy answer here, there just isn't.
4559000	4562000	Alright, let's move on with some other gaming news.
4562000	4564000	Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?
4564000	4569000	I think it is aptly titled in the article as ludicrous.
4569000	4571000	You remember Shaq-Fu?
4571000	4572000	Who doesn't?
4572000	4577000	Remember that Indiegogo about Shaq-Fu, a legendary born?
4577000	4580000	I don't, but everything's got a Kickstarter.
4580000	4583000	It was there, it barely made its goal.
4584000	4592000	Well, it has been announced, of course, in 2015 for PS4, Xbox One, PC, and Wii U.
4592000	4596000	And now it's going to be coming to Switch.
4596000	4601000	Although there's commentary that it might have been cancelled for Wii U just to come on the Switch instead.
4601000	4605000	It's being developed by Saber Interactive.
4605000	4612000	And they said, not just are they getting Shaq-Fu, but they're getting another Motocross title.
4612000	4616000	And another cooperative shooter, so who knows.
4616000	4621000	But why can't they just let Shaq-Fu not exist?
4621000	4625000	Well, Jamie, what if it is actually pretty good?
4625000	4629000	Sorry, I couldn't even make it through without laughing. I couldn't do it.
4630000	4632000	Well...
4634000	4636000	But it might, Jamie, it might.
4638000	4639000	Or it might not.
4640000	4644000	If someone else owns it, I'll play it.
4644000	4649000	Dartitsuyen Chat says, I could see that happening. I think that would be neat to play on Switch.
4649000	4653000	Well, this new game is supposed to be a beat-em-up as opposed to a one-on-one fighter.
4653000	4654000	Well, that will fix everything.
4654000	4657000	I'll reserve judgment for a trailer.
4657000	4660000	I suppose that's the appropriate steps to take.
4660000	4666000	We shouldn't judge the game until we see, you know, at least a trailer, if not the game itself.
4666000	4670000	But it's Shaq-Fu. It's hard not to have some reservations about the game.
4670000	4671000	You know what I'm saying?
4671000	4672000	No reservations.
4672000	4674000	All right. Loki, what's up next?
4674000	4678000	So apparently there's some more information.
4678000	4684000	Nintendo Life had spoken with some indie devs about kind of what their relationship is with Nintendo right now.
4684000	4692000	Kind of in the past they've had different issues, you know, be that curation or just even assistance in getting their products onto their marketplaces.
4692000	4699000	Well, apparently now, coming from some of the independent developers, they're saying that that relationship hasn't really gotten any better and maybe even a little bit worse.
4699000	4710000	Saying that one developer who's been described as like a top-rated eShop, had top-rated eShop releases, basically says that, you know, where in the past he had been pretty chummy with Nintendo.
4710000	4713000	They had like, you know, dinner meetings and stuff like that.
4713000	4718000	Now it was like they, the way they're treating them is basically this is just a transaction.
4718000	4722000	There's no helping them getting their product onto the store anymore.
4722000	4729000	It was more of just like, okay, you submit us your game and we'll see, maybe we'll get it on the store for you or something.
4729000	4733000	Just kind of some complaints that it's not really more personal.
4733000	4738000	Also, you know, the fact that they're not really enforcing some of their policies.
4738000	4744000	So, you know, there's some people that have been like actually shut out of the service.
4745000	4748000	So basically they're very inconsistent about their policies.
4748000	4752000	You know, there's games that they look at that, you know, 20% complete.
4752000	4760000	And they're saying that, you know, they're being allowed to, you know, have permission to release on the store when they're done.
4760000	4763000	When they have no idea what the game is going to even look like.
4763000	4769000	Or, I don't know, it just, it seems like it's a lot harder to publish onto that platform now.
4769000	4775000	This is weird for me to hear, though, because there's also other chatter where it sounds like Nintendo has been easier than ever.
4775000	4781000	But it sounds like maybe if you're one of the companies in the circle or whatever, Nintendo's easier to work with than ever.
4781000	4785000	But if you're outside of it, it might be a little harder. That's the impression I'm getting.
4785000	4787000	Well, yeah, like, you know, they were saying that, you know, for example, you know...
4787000	4790000	Would you get all of this in the rumors and category?
4790000	4795000	It could, it's obviously people that have had problems with it and I don't think anyone's really seen it.
4795000	4796000	Oh yeah, it's been fantastic.
4796000	4797000	It's like reading a Yelp review.
4797000	4803000	Exactly. Well, like they're saying, you know, getting a Wii U dev kit took about a week worth of work, which is basically nothing.
4803000	4807000	While it was impossible to get our hands on a Switch, we had to go to a publisher for it.
4807000	4814000	And the only other complaint about, was it, under communication professionalism is there, and no doubt about it.
4814000	4819000	But hardware access was way more painful than it needed to be, especially compared to the Xbox One.
4819000	4823000	Outside of that, everything else makes sense and it's in line with industry standards.
4823000	4832000	So, I mean, is it really, like, were the Switch allocations that bad that they couldn't get dev kits out to people?
4832000	4834000	That's kind of stupid if you ask me.
4834000	4839000	It's like, well, shit, can't get the hardware to develop a game for our system.
4839000	4844000	Because, let's be honest, it's really those indie games are fucking floating your shit right now, so...
4844000	4848000	I mean, come on. That's kind of pathetic.
4849000	4858000	Well, if it's true, but, I mean, I think there's probably also, because of the success of the Switch, and let's not, you know, hold back, the Switch has been extraordinarily successful.
4858000	4862000	We got the numbers from Nintendo this week. They're selling very, very well.
4862000	4867000	You know, there's probably a ton of indie developers that all of a sudden want to get on this thing.
4867000	4870000	And maybe it's because of some of the good words that have been out there.
4870000	4875000	I think there's probably a lot of indie developers that are working on Wii U titles and all of a sudden it's like, oh, Wii U is pretty much gone.
4875000	4876000	Yeah, right.
4876000	4878000	Well, shit, I better report this over this way.
4878000	4881000	Until they announce it E3, Wii U U.
4881000	4885000	Because why not? They just released a 2DS XL. Why not do a Wii U U?
4885000	4887000	It's like a Wii U, but without the gamepad.
4887000	4889000	Would that be a Wii W?
4889000	4893000	I was just going to say a Wii W. God damn it, Jamie, beat me to the joke.
4893000	4896000	Well, we are pensters.
4896000	4899000	Yeah, what can you do? Alright, so...
4899000	4902000	Or it could be just a Wii U, like, Wii U.
4902000	4903000	Wii U 2.
4903000	4905000	Wii U.
4906000	4908000	I like Wii W.
4908000	4912000	Alright, anyway, let's get to another. We've had a lot of Nintendo stories.
4912000	4917000	I want to talk about this game, which is headed, I think, for the PlayStation 4.
4917000	4920000	And for the PC is where this game is headed.
4920000	4926000	Yeah, PC and PlayStation 4 in May is a spiritual successor to Burnout.
4926000	4928000	And I was wondering... What?
4928000	4929000	I said yes.
4929000	4932000	I know, because I've kind of been wondering what's happened to the Burnout series.
4932000	4934000	We haven't had one of these games in a while.
4934000	4940000	In Tyrian, they were working on a game. It was supposed to be some extreme sports thing that got cancelled.
4940000	4944000	And then I think that they were working on the Need for Speed games,
4944000	4948000	which had kind of sort of been going the Burnout route, but they're not quite Burnout.
4948000	4949000	Yeah, they're not quite.
4949000	4951000	So, that's as far as I've heard.
4951000	4955000	Well, there's a company now out there called Three Fields Entertainment,
4955000	4958000	and it's made up of former Burnout franchise developers.
4958000	4962000	They're going to be releasing a vehicular destruction game called Danger Zone.
4962000	4966000	Please tell me they licensed... Was it Kenny Loggins that did that song?
4966000	4967000	Yes.
4967000	4969000	Please tell me they licensed that song to use in this...
4969000	4972000	Because otherwise, how can you fucking do a game called Danger Zone and not actually...
4972000	4974000	With cars crashing and not have the...
4974000	4977000	Flying to the danger zone...
4977000	4980000	It's got to be in the trailer. It's got to be in the trailer too.
4980000	4982000	I don't know if I can support it if it doesn't.
4982000	4986000	Well, anyway, this game takes place in a crash testing facility,
4986000	4992000	and you will be surviving a variety of crash testing scenarios while trying to get bonus pickups.
4992000	4996000	The studio in its press release said you can shunt vehicles into oncoming traffic,
4996000	4998000	take down trailers to shed their payloads,
4998000	5002000	and use your explosive Smash Breaker to move your vehicle around.
5002000	5004000	The more explosions you cause, the bigger your score.
5004000	5008000	Smash Breaker? Let's just completely rip off fucking Burnout Smash Mode.
5008000	5013000	This sounds like they released a game on Xbox Arcade.
5013000	5018000	Yeah, it's a party. It was Burnout Party or something like that.
5018000	5019000	Yeah.
5019000	5024000	Yeah, because that's based off of Burnout's Crash Mode that they had.
5024000	5028000	But, I mean, they're literally ripping that off, which is...
5028000	5031000	I guess it's okay, because it was fun, but...
5031000	5034000	I mean, they're calling it literally the same thing.
5034000	5035000	Yeah, it's just really funny.
5035000	5039000	Anyway, this studio, they did already release a game called Dangerous Golf,
5039000	5041000	but Danger Zone is coming out in May.
5041000	5044000	Get this price, though. $12.99.
5044000	5047000	Dangerous Golf is funny, too, because Dangerous Golf is basically...
5047000	5052000	It's playing golf in a house, but it's like Burnout Crash Mode
5052000	5055000	if you were to play golf in a house, if that makes sense.
5055000	5058000	So, like, you're hitting a golf ball and try to break stuff in a house
5058000	5061000	and your golf ball can explode and all sorts of ridiculous stuff
5061000	5064000	because it's basically Burnout as a golf ball.
5064000	5067000	The sad thing is, though, it doesn't sound like it has the actual racing parts.
5067000	5069000	Like, that was... It sounds like that's missing.
5069000	5070000	Yeah, that is unfortunate.
5070000	5072000	Too bad. But for $12.99, okay.
5072000	5074000	Like, because if the racing had been there, then it would probably be a security game.
5074000	5076000	Just EA, come on, bring back fucking Burnout.
5076000	5078000	No one gives a shit about Need for Speed anymore.
5078000	5082000	Just give Need for Speed a year off and fucking put out Burnout Paradise 2
5082000	5084000	or whatever the fuck you're going to put out.
5084000	5088000	Anyway, some good comments in chat regarding the whole Kenny Loggins thing.
5088000	5091000	JD suggesting Archer should also be there.
5091000	5092000	Kenny Loggins and Archer.
5092000	5095000	And Dark Tetsuya saying, if Rock Band can get them both,
5095000	5097000	maybe these guys could license him for a cameo.
5097000	5100000	Anything is possible, folks. Anything is possible.
5100000	5105000	Anyhow, we need to get to the classic game of the week.
5105000	5110000	That's not her music. Wrong music.
5110000	5112000	How about that one?
5112000	5113000	Sure.
5113000	5115000	Emails are in part B. How about this one instead?
5115000	5117000	Every week, Dar Sakura steps into the gaming vault
5117000	5122000	and finds a game that she thinks, hey, listen, hey, listen.
5122000	5124000	Oh, wait, no, that's her fairy garden.
5124000	5127000	My fairy garden is Navi-free, thank you.
5127000	5130000	She steps into the gaming vault, finds a game that she thinks, hey,
5130000	5134000	you kids should be checking this game out this week.
5134000	5136000	Dar Sakura, what did you pick for the classic game of the week?
5136000	5138000	I picked Burnout.
5138000	5140000	How ironic.
5140000	5141000	Mm-hmm.
5141000	5143000	And we didn't even compare notes.
5143000	5144000	No, we didn't.
5144000	5145000	We sure didn't.
5145000	5148000	I actually picked Burnout because Dan was watching Roadkill Garage
5148000	5151000	and so I went to see if I had interest in metal, which I have,
5151000	5154000	so I picked Burnout instead.
5154000	5157000	Well, it's a good choice. It's a timely choice.
5157000	5167000	So Burnout was released in 2001 and it came out on PlayStation 2 initially.
5167000	5172000	It later got GameCube and Xbox versions a year later in 2002,
5172000	5175000	but it still meets my criteria.
5175000	5180000	It was noted for crashing.
5180000	5182000	You're supposed to crash on purpose.
5182000	5185000	So you have Championship mode, which is the main mode of the game,
5185000	5188000	and you've got different races in that mode,
5188000	5190000	and you compete against other cars,
5190000	5194000	and it gets harder and harder and harder because it's a race.
5194000	5196000	And then you have a face-off challenge after each of those
5196000	5200000	where you can unlock a new car if you win.
5200000	5202000	You've got sprinting. You've got all this other one.
5202000	5205000	You have all kinds of different cars in it too
5205000	5210000	that are generic, unbranded cars as far as I remember.
5210000	5214000	But the big thing about this game is the crashes,
5214000	5223000	and it has led to pretty crazy versions of later games that have...
5223000	5226000	Although, did it kind of move away from the whole crash thing?
5226000	5229000	There's an E version, I think.
5229000	5230000	No.
5230000	5231000	No?
5231000	5233000	That's Burnout. Of course it didn't.
5233000	5236000	Well, no, there was another one that it's got...
5236000	5241000	I'm thinking of the iOS version because it's all nothing but crashes.
5241000	5243000	Yeah, I was going to say, you might be thinking of the thing we were thinking of a minute ago,
5243000	5245000	the whole party spin-off thing that they had.
5245000	5246000	Yeah.
5246000	5249000	But the whole thing is that you're supposed to rack up
5249000	5254000	as much property damage as you can with one crash.
5254000	5259000	And the crash mechanics got more and more and more and more ridiculous.
5259000	5262000	But there's not really much to say about it.
5262000	5266000	It's a racing game with crashes, and exploding things is pretty damn cool.
5266000	5268000	Well, it wasn't just about crashing, because Burnout was about
5268000	5271000	you get nitrous, or boost, I guess.
5271000	5274000	Your boost meter goes up by driving dangerously.
5274000	5277000	So that could be crashing into opponent cars,
5277000	5282000	or driving into uncommon traffic, or cutting cars off really close.
5282000	5284000	It's basically reckless drive for the game.
5284000	5285000	That type of stuff.
5285000	5288000	So that was the main racing part of the game, of course.
5288000	5291000	And then there's crash mode, which is awesome, and you can crash into things.
5291000	5294000	I mean, how many people played this game for the races?
5294000	5296000	I did. I played for both.
5296000	5297000	Okay, five people.
5297000	5300000	Racing is fun, but fire is funner.
5300000	5303000	Well, you kind of have to play it for both the unlocked cars.
5303000	5304000	That's true.
5304000	5307000	I want that to be on the tombstone of Orange Lounge Radio
5307000	5309000	when this inevitably ends someday.
5309000	5310000	Fire is funner.
5310000	5312000	Fire is funner.
5312000	5315000	But the thing that people mostly know about this game
5315000	5320000	is the explosions, crashing, and semi-trucks, and being a reckless driver.
5320000	5325000	Like, you can race for only so long, and then you have to create an accident on purpose.
5325000	5326000	You just have to.
5326000	5329000	I tried to do the same thing in Mario Kart, but it's not the same.
5329000	5333000	I remember Dan trying to play through this, and trying on purpose not to crash.
5333000	5337000	And then he'd crash, and it would take five hours to finish the crash.
5337000	5340000	And he'd be like, damn it, I was trying to get that car.
5340000	5343000	Man, if Criterion can make a Mario Kart game,
5343000	5346000	that would be awesome.
5346000	5348000	Call it Mario Crash.
5348000	5351000	I know this is never going to happen, and I know it was a different company.
5351000	5353000	It was bizarre, but what about Blur?
5353000	5356000	Like, that game got shafted really bad.
5356000	5357000	It's too bad.
5357000	5358000	It's too bad. Blur was...
5358000	5360000	But Activision tends to do that.
5360000	5361000	Anyway, sorry.
5361000	5363000	I know that's not Burnout, but I have to bring it up.
5363000	5365000	Burnout, I'm done.
5365000	5367000	She's burnt out on Burnout.
5367000	5368000	Yep.
5368000	5371000	All right, there it is, your classic game of the week, a very timely choice.
5371000	5375000	Burnout, the original from 2001,
5375000	5378000	available on pretty much all the systems of the PS2 era.
5378000	5381000	That would mean the GameCube and the Xbox as well.
5381000	5382000	Check it out.
5382000	5384000	All right, we're going to take a quick break,
5384000	5387000	but when we come back, there is plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come.
5387000	5392000	We'll be talking about a controversial video game from the past coming back.
5392000	5394000	I think you all know what's coming up with this one.
5394000	5396000	And then Dark Sakura's going to give us a little bit of a history lesson.
5396000	5398000	We have all that and plenty more to look forward to
5398000	5403000	when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
5411000	5414000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
5414000	5419000	Live tonight, episode number 684 of our show already in progress.
5419000	5422000	If you're just joining us, you missed a fun part A.
5422000	5425000	We had Zircon joining us to talk about Tangledeep
5425000	5428000	as well as some of his other work with music and so forth.
5428000	5430000	And then we had an interesting story from Alan,
5430000	5434000	who was actually on site trying to get a classic NES,
5434000	5439000	but alas, he was beat out by scalpers who were not shy about their scalping.
5439000	5440000	And they suck.
5440000	5443000	Yeah, if you missed that part of the show, you can check it out on our podcast feed.
5443000	5446000	If you're already checking out the show on the podcast feed, hello,
5446000	5448000	and thanks for joining us.
5448000	5451000	As I say at the end of every show, we do appreciate a nice review,
5451000	5454000	a five-star review on iTunes or Google Play,
5454000	5456000	wherever it is that you found this podcast.
5456000	5459000	Those ratings and such go an awful long way to help us spread the word
5459000	5461000	about Orange Lounge Radio.
5461000	5463000	Let's get back into some more gaming talk.
5463000	5465000	We have some rapid-fire news to get to.
5465000	5466000	Start with Loki.
5466000	5469000	Yes, you may remember that Bayonetta was just released out on Steam,
5469000	5472000	which is kind of a surprise, and everyone's thinking,
5472000	5473000	oh, hey, cool.
5473000	5474000	Bayonetta 2.
5474000	5481000	Bayonetta 2, or maybe another new game will be coming out soon.
5482000	5486000	So one of Platinum's games that people are really hoping to see next
5486000	5489000	would be, of course, Vanquish,
5489000	5492000	and there's maybe a little bit of a tease regarding that as well.
5492000	5496000	Apparently there was a small update done to Bayonetta, the Steam version,
5496000	5501000	adding a Vanquish avatar to the game's extras folder.
5501000	5502000	Hmm.
5502000	5505000	So that was kind of a little interesting.
5505000	5507000	Could that be hinting that Vanquish would be the next title
5507000	5509000	that's going to be coming to Steam?
5509000	5511000	I guess we'll just have to wait and find out,
5511000	5513000	because they haven't said anything.
5513000	5515000	So, I don't know.
5515000	5518000	And then, of course, for PlayStation Plus for May,
5518000	5520000	we're going to be getting a handful of titles,
5520000	5525000	including on PlayStation 4, Tales from the Borderlands and Abzu.
5525000	5527000	Those are going to be both on PlayStation 4.
5527000	5532000	Port Royale 3, Pirates and Merchants, and Blood Knights on PS3.
5532000	5537000	And finally, on the Vita, Laser Disco Defenders and Typewriters.
5538000	5540000	Those are also crossed by on PlayStation 4.
5540000	5542000	So they'll be coming in May.
5542000	5544000	Just to piggyback on that a little bit,
5544000	5546000	don't forget it's the 30th today if you're listening live,
5546000	5549000	so this is your last chance to grab some of the Xbox One stuff.
5549000	5552000	I think Walking Dead Season 2 is one of the things today is the last chance to get.
5552000	5557000	And then tomorrow, it's Gianna's Sister's Twisted Dreams.
5557000	5561000	And I want to say Star Wars Force Unleashed 2?
5561000	5564000	It's a Star Wars game of some sort, is also.
5564000	5566000	Somebody in chat knows, but that's what's Xbox One.
5566000	5572000	And you have until May 2nd to get a few more days for April as well.
5572000	5574000	For PlayStation games.
5574000	5577000	Yeah, but May 2nd is when they're going to be going up for May.
5577000	5582000	Yeah, Microsoft's always kind of a hard stop on the 1st and the 15th and all that stuff,
5582000	5587000	but PlayStation tends to kind of cycle out whatever Tuesday is close to the 1st of the month,
5587000	5588000	is when they tend to do it.
5588000	5590000	Although for E3, they might push back.
5590000	5595000	I remember last June, the June games didn't show up until around E3 time.
5595000	5599000	Well, speaking of E3 time, we're only like six weeks away, believe it or not.
5599000	5600000	That's hard to believe.
5600000	5602000	From the big public E3, which is going to be interesting.
5602000	5604000	I should take some days off for the...
5604000	5606000	Oh, I can't afford to at this point.
5606000	5609000	Well, I think it's like a day off, because it's really only one day.
5609000	5611000	It's really that first day when all the news hits, right?
5611000	5613000	I have all the conferences.
5613000	5615000	Or I could just watch conferences at my desk.
5615000	5618000	Sadly, I can't do that this year.
5618000	5621000	I'm going to have to just kind of play the catch-up game and so forth.
5621000	5623000	I would love to do live reactions and so forth.
5623000	5626000	Or nightly shows, kind of breaking it down or something.
5626000	5628000	I just don't know if I'll be able to do that this year.
5628000	5635000	But I know one of the things we're going to have to deal with is Bethesda's E3 event.
5635000	5640000	This is all the week before our big anniversary show, right?
5640000	5644000	Sunday, June 11th is the E3 Bethesda conference.
5644000	5645000	It's right in the middle of OLR.
5645000	5648000	So I'll have to kind of work around that as we have for the past couple of years.
5648000	5651000	Well, Bethesda has actually sent out their official invites this week.
5651000	5653000	And they kind of did an amusement park theme with this.
5653000	5659000	But what's interesting about this amusement park theme is that if you look at the little postcards they sent out,
5659000	5663000	they see some things that are portrayed here in this amusement park.
5663000	5666000	Such as there's definitely a Fallout 4 section.
5666000	5669000	You can definitely see a Quake Champions.
5669000	5672000	There's definitely a Doom thing back in there.
5672000	5675000	Kind of an Elder Scrolls representative area as well.
5675000	5681000	But there are two areas that show under construction.
5681000	5688000	So it seems like Bethesda may unveil two new games at their show this year.
5688000	5690000	Don't expect Elder Scrolls VI.
5690000	5696000	Apparently it has already been commented on previously that Elder Scrolls VI is way too early in development.
5696000	5698000	It is a long ways off. Don't expect that.
5698000	5705000	But there is some murmurs and things out there that one of the games could be Evil Within 2.
5705000	5708000	Yeah, I was going to say one of those, that's probably Elder Scrolls Online.
5708000	5710000	Because I don't think they have...
5710000	5713000	No, Elder Scrolls Online is represented in the little thing.
5713000	5715000	That game is already out in the event.
5715000	5717000	The top one there was Elder Scrolls Online.
5717000	5718000	Yeah.
5718000	5719000	They have the volcano there.
5719000	5720000	Yeah, so no.
5720000	5722000	I mean there could be a...
5722000	5724000	Well, they just did the Morrowind expansion, right?
5724000	5726000	Right, that's what that would be though.
5726000	5727000	They have the volcano from that.
5727000	5728000	Gotcha.
5728000	5730000	And then of course Doom.
5730000	5732000	And then it looks like Quake.
5732000	5735000	I'm guessing that is...
5735000	5737000	What the hell is that game?
5737000	5740000	Wolfenstein is the other thought that people are thinking.
5740000	5742000	It could be a Wolfenstein 2 is what they're going to use.
5742000	5743000	Well, I don't know what the...
5743000	5744000	Oh, that's Prey.
5744000	5748000	So Prey and then Dishonored is the other one.
5748000	5750000	Yeah, Prey and Dishonored are represented there too.
5750000	5751000	And Fallout.
5751000	5755000	So very likely that it could be Evil Within 2 and Wolfenstein 2.
5755000	5756000	But who knows?
5756000	5757000	Anything's possible.
5757000	5762000	So you'll have to stay tuned for E3 to find out because maybe they have a new, new thing to do.
5762000	5768000	One other thing I want to mention before we go over to Dark Sakura and that is the Mega Man Legacy Collection 2.
5768000	5772000	Although nothing has been officially announced, apparently a Korean ratings board,
5772000	5774000	which has leaked a few other games in the past,
5774000	5778000	has leaked some information regarding the Mega Man Legacy Collection 2,
5778000	5783000	which would include Mega Man 7, 8, 9, and 10.
5783000	5786000	No word on any of the X series or anything else.
5786000	5792000	It's just the 7, 8, 9, and 10 to complete off what started with 1 through 6 when that was released.
5792000	5795000	Gosh, that was about a year and a half ago at this point that that came out.
5795000	5803000	So this is only confirmed through the ratings board through PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.
5803000	5806000	That means we have not heard a confirmation on the 3DS yet,
5806000	5810000	which I seem to recall the original Mega Man Collection was on the 3DS.
5810000	5816000	And certainly nothing on the Nintendo Switch, which I don't know if you guys know,
5816000	5820000	but that Disney Afternoon Collection actually just came out this past week.
5820000	5824000	That's the one that has the original DuckTales, DuckTales 2, Chip and Dale.
5824000	5829000	You know, it has like a bunch of the Tailspin, you know, a bunch of those Disney games from the NES era.
5829000	5835000	I passed on it, which I was surprised that I did, but I'm holding out for a Switch version.
5835000	5838000	I truly believe Switch is the console that thing ought to be on.
5838000	5846000	I might be waiting a while, especially if Capcom's first big release is going to be that Street Fighter 2 thing they're charging, what, 30, 40 bucks for.
5846000	5848000	Yeah, that looks like crap.
5848000	5854000	I'm not too excited about that, but I'm going to hope that these collections make their way to Switch at some point,
5854000	5858000	because I really, especially with the Disney Afternoon Collection, that's where that thing belongs.
5858000	5859000	It's a little silly.
5859000	5864000	Is Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite coming to Switch?
5864000	5866000	Good question. I don't think we know.
5866000	5869000	I don't think we know. Right now, no.
5869000	5874000	But, you know, again, Nintendo just announced these very powerful sales figures,
5874000	5877000	so now third parties have probably got to be giving Nintendo another look.
5877000	5879000	They might have wrote it off after the Wii U.
5879000	5882000	I think there's going to be now people that might go back and look at Nintendo.
5882000	5884000	We might have an interesting E3.
5884000	5887000	We might see some things announced for Switch that we weren't expecting.
5887000	5894000	I mean, we haven't had third parties really playing along strongly with Wii U in a while.
5894000	5896000	Or Nintendo, really, in a while.
5896000	5901000	I mean, 3DS, yes, here and there, but Wii U tended to be the focus of the E3 presentations.
5901000	5907000	So I'll be very curious to see how much third parties kind of take over Nintendo's E3 with some of their announcements.
5907000	5909000	We'll see. We'll see.
5909000	5911000	We've got a good six weeks to go or so.
5911000	5914000	Anyway, moving on. Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?
5914000	5915000	Stuff.
5915000	5918000	Guess what? There was an MMO I used to play a while back.
5918000	5920000	And it was called Star Trek Online.
5920000	5921000	Oh yeah, they're still going.
5921000	5925000	It is still going. They're on episode 13 now.
5925000	5929000	And it looks like this one is called Escalation.
5929000	5935000	And they're actually doing a balance update for Space Combat.
5935000	5938000	Ground Combat got its update last season.
5938000	5949000	And then they're also bringing in new escort vessels and doing some touches on Star Trek Nemesis.
5949000	5951000	So we'll see what happens with that.
5951000	5955000	I don't know if it's enough to make me want to play again, but it's pretty interesting.
5955000	5958000	And then last, Gundam Versus is coming out in the US.
5958000	5962000	It's going to be out on PS4 by Bandai.
5962000	5966000	And it is a multiplayer fighting game that's based on the Mobile Suit Gundam universe.
5966000	5972000	So, we're getting Gundam games. That's cool. So, enjoy.
5972000	5976000	I will. I will enjoy.
5976000	5977000	Are you enjoy?
5977000	5984000	Yes. Alright, let's travel around and check out some games that are coming out a little sooner, as in stores, this week.
5984000	5990000	And what can be described as probably the weirdest spinoff of the Mass Effect series.
5990000	5993000	The Caligula Effect is going to be coming out on Vita this week.
5994000	5996000	A Vita game in the US?
5996000	6000000	In the US, I know. They happen sometimes.
6000000	6006000	The Legend of Heroes Trails in the Sky III is coming out on PC.
6006000	6010000	Prey is coming out on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
6010000	6011000	Is that demo out?
6011000	6013000	It is out, yes.
6013000	6015000	Yeah, I heard people talking about that on the Twitters.
6016000	6023000	And then World to the West on PC, Mac, and Linux, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Wii U.
6023000	6026000	Wii U getting the game. That's it.
6026000	6030000	Alright, well heading on over to Japan.
6030000	6033000	There really isn't anything to speak of on the PlayStation 4 this week.
6033000	6037000	Things are pretty dry over there, so nothing really for me to plug.
6037000	6040000	And honestly, it's kind of the same story on the PlayStation Vita as well.
6040000	6043000	The next release is on May 11th over there.
6043000	6046000	I'm thinking it's kind of a slow week in Japan.
6046000	6048000	Because the Switch doesn't have anything.
6048000	6051000	But again, the physical releases are still very slow in Japan.
6051000	6054000	And there's actually nothing on the 3DS either.
6054000	6057000	However, I believe it's Golden Week in Japan right now.
6057000	6060000	And that could probably explain their lack of releases.
6060000	6064000	In fact, I just was looking up here.
6064000	6066000	I think it's right at the end of April, right?
6066000	6069000	Yeah, April 29th was Emperor's Birthday.
6069000	6070000	May 5th is Children's Day.
6070000	6073000	So we're right in the midst of Golden Week.
6073000	6076000	So this is why there's really no releases in Japan right now.
6076000	6079000	So you're going to have to wait a little while.
6079000	6082000	Loki. I'm sorry. Dark Soccer. How about the UK?
6082000	6089000	On May 4th, there's Space Plan for Android and iOS and PC.
6089000	6094000	And then on the 5th, Prey for PC, Xbox One, PlayStation 4.
6094000	6097000	World to the West on the major systems as well.
6097000	6099000	And that's pretty it.
6099000	6102000	So a little bit of a slower week in releases, except for Prey.
6102000	6104000	That's kind of a big deal.
6104000	6107000	I still remember Prey on the Xbox 360, the original one.
6107000	6109000	But this new one's completely different.
6109000	6111000	Nothing to do with the original Prey, right?
6111000	6114000	Just two games that have the same name that happen to be first-person shooters.
6114000	6116000	I'm curious about it.
6116000	6119000	Let's go to the mailbag.
6119000	6121000	I think it's time to hear from you guys.
6121000	6123000	We have a couple weeks' worth of emails to catch up on.
6123000	6125000	But not too many.
6125000	6127000	You guys send us emails every week.
6128000	6135000	DarkSoccer dives in the mailbag and finds her favorite emails to read right now.
6135000	6139000	Now, I may be going a slight bit out of order on some of these emails.
6139000	6141000	But I will go ahead and start.
6141000	6145000	One of these is from Sam.
6145000	6148000	Hello, OLR Crew. I love the show.
6148000	6150000	Which console are you all going to buy?
6150000	6154000	The $400 Scorpio or the feature-packed $600 Scorpio Elite.
6154000	6156000	Thank you, Sam.
6156000	6158000	We don't have confirmation on any of those right now.
6158000	6160000	And I don't think we'll know until E3.
6160000	6162000	But I do think there were some rumblings this past week about something.
6162000	6165000	Like, a SKU had come out or something.
6165000	6167000	Or, I don't know, some more details.
6167000	6170000	Like, we know how many teraflops are in it and all this stuff, right?
6170000	6174000	Well, they've already shown off the hardware too.
6174000	6181000	Like, was it Digital Trends? No, it was one of the Eurogamer and stuff.
6181000	6183000	They were looking at it.
6183000	6185000	But I remember there were some rumors out there about there being two versions of it.
6185000	6187000	Which I don't see how they are.
6187000	6189000	I don't think we know anything yet.
6189000	6191000	Yeah, I mean, we really don't know until E3.
6191000	6196000	And I'm going to be honest, when it comes to Scorpio, like, at this current time,
6196000	6199000	and if anyone from Microsoft who makes these things happens to be listening,
6199000	6201000	here's what's important about E3.
6201000	6204000	If you want me to put the money down to pre-order a Scorpio,
6204000	6207000	you really need to convince me, as an Xbox One owner,
6207000	6211000	and as a pretty beefy computer running Windows 10 user,
6211000	6213000	why do I need Scorpio?
6213000	6217000	Because right now, it doesn't seem like there's a reason for me to own it.
6217000	6221000	Like, anything I want, I could play on Xbox One,
6221000	6224000	or I could play on my Windows 10 machine.
6224000	6226000	Granted, there's some things that I prefer on Xbox One.
6226000	6228000	Just hopefully you're not playing in game mode,
6228000	6232000	because I saw a video today regarding Windows 10 game mode
6232000	6234000	that apparently looks like it sucks.
6234000	6238000	Really? I heard it's best used on older machines.
6238000	6240000	You get better frame rate on older machines.
6240000	6242000	But I haven't really, I don't need it.
6242000	6244000	The games run fine for me.
6244000	6246000	What I follow is Alliance Tech Tips,
6246000	6249000	and they do a bunch of different videos regarding hardware benchmarking and stuff,
6249000	6253000	and they test three different SKUs, kind of like low-end, mid-tier,
6253000	6257000	and high-end PCs with three different games, including Gears of War 4.
6257000	6261000	And with game mode on, it actually cuts some of the frame rates in half,
6261000	6264000	like the 99% frame rate that they received.
6264000	6265000	Interesting.
6265000	6268000	Yeah, so there's a lot more frame rate dips, I guess, with that.
6268000	6270000	No, I don't even worry about game mode.
6270000	6272000	I haven't played with it, because I don't need to.
6272000	6274000	I get great frame rates from Final Fantasy XIV.
6274000	6277000	I get shitty frame rates with my laptop, so I'm all for that.
6277000	6282000	But right now, I need to see what games would get me on board with it.
6282000	6288000	I mean, like Forza Horizon 3, but Crackdown, hopefully this year, because...
6288000	6289000	Finally.
6289000	6293000	Finally? There's no confirmation yet that it's coming out this year yet.
6293000	6295000	Have we heard anything about it? Nope.
6295000	6298000	No, but we know Scalebound's not happening now, so...
6298000	6300000	I mean, I don't know.
6300000	6303000	Microsoft's going to be a real weird wild card at E3.
6303000	6307000	We kind of know what to expect from Nintendo, I would say, going into E3.
6307000	6308000	Nothing.
6308000	6312000	No, it's not nothing, but it's the big games that are going to sell the Switch this holiday,
6312000	6314000	including Mario Odyssey will be one of them.
6314000	6317000	There's probably going to be a second AAA game, too.
6317000	6324000	Can we get the pitchforks and torches out if they start, like, fucking announcing the Super Nintendo mini thing?
6324000	6326000	Can we start a mob?
6326000	6330000	If they do not address supply concerns, yes.
6330000	6332000	This is Nintendo. Of course they're not going to address supply concerns.
6332000	6334000	If they don't, then yes, we can get out the pitchforks.
6334000	6335000	Yeah!
6336000	6341000	But if they do, which they might, they might have a roundabout way of doing it.
6341000	6343000	They'll use boardroom speakers.
6343000	6350000	Somehow, we don't have unlimited resources, but we managed to get more resources.
6350000	6354000	Exclusive pre-orders available to my Nintendo members starting today.
6354000	6356000	Bam. Cut out scalpers immediately.
6356000	6359000	They're made out of completely different plastic.
6359000	6361000	Different polymers, you know.
6361000	6363000	And much, much harder to hack.
6363000	6366000	Anyway, Microsoft's going to be a very interesting wildcard for E3,
6366000	6369000	whereas yes, we know what to expect. We know the Scorpio is coming,
6369000	6372000	but what is going to substantiate the purchase of a Scorpio?
6372000	6374000	That's what we don't know.
6374000	6379000	So, my big roundabout answer to this very short email is
6379000	6383000	that has to be answered until we can talk further about Scorpio.
6383000	6387000	And that is, what's the compelling reason for me to get one?
6387000	6390000	Because right now, beefier tech isn't doing it.
6390000	6393000	I really feel burned by that from PlayStation 4 Pro.
6393000	6395000	So, I'm not making that mistake again.
6395000	6398000	Anyway, next email, DarkSakura, please.
6398000	6402000	I will go ahead and read the next short one, which is much earlier.
6402000	6406000	Dear Retertainment, Kylie Minogue is a flawless goddess.
6406000	6409000	Please take those blasphemous statements of her being trashy elsewhere.
6409000	6412000	With love, Oscar. P.S. Get out of my way.
6412000	6414000	That's a song lyric from Kylie Minogue.
6414000	6415000	I know.
6415000	6417000	Well, I was hoping you'd sing it. No, I'm just kidding.
6417000	6418000	No.
6418000	6421000	I don't think you were here the last show, DarkSakura,
6421000	6424000	but Retertainment unfortunately made a fleet.
6424000	6426000	He was trying to refer to Kylie Minogue as campy,
6426000	6428000	but I think he used the word trashy,
6428000	6431000	and I may have read the right act live on air.
6431000	6433000	I know he just made it.
6433000	6434000	Kylie is a flawless goddess.
6434000	6438000	Kylie is a flawless goddess, but I think he made an innocent mistake.
6438000	6439000	She is campy.
6439000	6441000	He made a mistake.
6441000	6443000	No, wasn't she cammy?
6443000	6445000	I mean, fuck off.
6445000	6447000	I think we're getting to...
6447000	6451000	Do you know the whole reason that I saw that movie was to see her as cammy?
6451000	6454000	Oh, you know my, like, 12-year-old gay ass was like,
6454000	6455000	Kylie Minogue!
6455000	6456000	Right?
6456000	6457000	No.
6457000	6458000	She made a good cammy.
6458000	6459000	Yeah, she was...
6459000	6460000	And a good cammy.
6460000	6463000	Raul Julia made that movie, really, in her.
6463000	6464000	Sad it was his last film.
6464000	6466000	It is really sad it was his last film.
6466000	6468000	But you know I saw it twice in the theater.
6468000	6469000	I always saw it once.
6469000	6470000	Anyway, moving on.
6470000	6471000	Okay.
6471000	6472000	Hello, LR.
6472000	6475000	Last week's show you mentioned the discontinuation of the Nests classic mini.
6475000	6480000	I absolutely agree with you guys that the fact that this discontinuation, along with a super limited supply,
6480000	6484000	were absolute jerk moves and that Nintendo deserves whatever crap they're given for them.
6484000	6489000	But purely from a business standpoint, I believe that Nintendo got exactly what they wanted out of the Nests classic mini.
6489000	6496000	Now please understand that this is my personal speculation regarding the twisted, possibly deluded point of view of the Japanese corporation.
6496000	6499000	This is widely regarded as marching to the beat of their own drum and no one else's.
6499000	6503000	But Nintendo Switch is still four months out and no details have been released.
6503000	6509000	The 3DS is old, nobody's talking about Wii U anymore, no significant Nintendo products are on anyone's Christmas list.
6509000	6511000	Hi, it's May.
6511000	6519000	This is something that will get people talking about Nintendo again, generate new interest in the brand to please the investors,
6519000	6522000	and hopefully make folks hungrier for the Switch next year.
6522000	6526000	Do we want to sell 20 million of these?
6526000	6527000	Absolutely not.
6527000	6532000	We would rather sell these games for $5 a pop as downloads on our dedicated consoles.
6532000	6535000	But will this help us put up some holiday numbers?
6535000	6537000	These look really good.
6537000	6542000	So now we're hearing rumors about a possible SNES classic mini for the holiday season next year.
6542000	6545000	Nintendo is always claiming that they're listening to customer feedback.
6545000	6548000	What does that mean for the new mini?
6548000	6559000	Probably that it will now say limited edition on the box to make sure we know from the outset that this is a special item made specifically for scalpers.
6559000	6566000	No other significant changes will be made, especially in terms of quality, quantity manufactured, mark my words.
6566000	6570000	Oh man, I hope I'm really wrong. I would love to get my hands on one of those things.
6570000	6573000	Pretending to place a pre-order right now, Aaron Yyr.
6573000	6575000	It's not the same market.
6575000	6581000	The people that, like, if they're saying, oh well, you know, if you want to play your classic games, you can play it on the virtual console.
6582000	6590000	The people that would have bought the NES mini aren't necessarily people that are even going to buy a Switch or Wii U or 3DS or whatever.
6590000	6592000	You're selling to a completely new market.
6592000	6596000	And they were making money off those because there's not enough in the hardware itself.
6596000	6601000	There was, component wise, there wasn't that much to it.
6601000	6604000	It was just a chip running Linux.
6604000	6606000	That's it.
6606000	6609000	I mean, it doesn't make any sense.
6609000	6614000	If I was an investor, I'd be furious because it's money on the table that they're throwing away.
6614000	6620000	And yeah, the only thing that it really did for me is just enrage me as a consumer of Nintendo products.
6620000	6625000	It's just, this is the bullshit that they claim that they've gotten all this supply chain shit fixed.
6625000	6629000	And here's another fucking example of no, they don't know what the fuck they're doing.
6629000	6638000	I agree with you, Loki, on the sense that as a publicly traded company in Japan, I would be furious if I was an investor if they're leaving this on the table as well.
6638000	6642000	And especially when the reasons, I mean, do the investors know something we don't?
6642000	6644000	Like the real reason why they're walking away from this? I don't know.
6644000	6649000	But I can talk about this stuff and get huffy about it until I'm pink in the face.
6649000	6656000	But the reality is Nintendo, we're at the point where Nintendo just fucking does no wrong.
6656000	6660000	We can sit here and go, what a bunch of fucking morons.
6660000	6663000	But time and time again, Switch sells 2 million.
6663000	6666000	They have all this freaking positive press out there.
6666000	6668000	So you know what? I'm done trying to speculate.
6668000	6671000	Because it's got Apple appeal. It's got Apple appeal.
6671000	6674000	It doesn't matter what Apple will do, people will fucking buy the price.
6674000	6676000	Nintendo, doesn't matter what they're going to do.
6676000	6679000	We're beyond that at this point.
6679000	6682000	I think we're away from those comparisons.
6682000	6690000	Because it's to a religious fanatic state that they've got so much hope that Nintendo's going to do the right thing.
6690000	6694000	Please show me some examples of how they're actually going to follow through this.
6694000	6697000	Because right now this system is only a couple months old.
6697000	6699000	We don't know what they're going to do.
6699000	6704000	The Mario game that they're promising for fourth quarter, who knows if that's coming out in fourth quarter?
6704000	6706000	It's a promise right now. We don't know shit.
6706000	6713000	The thing with Apple though, they have never walked away from a product at the height of its popularity that I can recall.
6713000	6717000	Exactly. They will sell that shit until it's just not moving off shelves.
6717000	6719000	That's where we're beyond this now.
6720000	6722000	Exactly. They get supply chain.
6722000	6729000	But Nintendo, which is weird because I'm assuming that they manufacture in China because everybody fucking manufactures in China.
6729000	6737000	How did they find the one part of China that can't fucking manufacture a tiny plastic box with a chip inside of it?
6737000	6745000	I don't know anymore. I'm going to wait until E3 to see what fucking the circus brings to town next.
6745000	6751000	That's all I can do at this point with Nintendo anymore. I'm going to wait until the circus comes to town for E3.
6751000	6754000	Do you agree Dark Soccer? Are you going to wait for the circus?
6754000	6755000	Nah.
6755000	6757000	Alright. Is that it for our emails tonight?
6757000	6758000	Yes.
6758000	6761000	Alright. Then we will move on to some more news.
6761000	6766000	But if you want to email us for a future week, participate at orangelaungeradio.com.
6766000	6772000	We will be opening up the Skype line for your calls at Orange Lounge Radio a little later on in the show.
6772000	6775000	But first, we do have some more news to get to. Loki.
6775000	6780000	Did you know it's been 25 years since Night Trap was released?
6780000	6786000	I know that because they're releasing a Night Trap 25th anniversary edition that's going to be coming to PlayStation 4.
6786000	6791000	Way to make me feel old, Loki, as all these fucking anniversary stories do.
6791000	6795000	Like when Mario Brothers turned 30 and Zelda turned 30, I was like,
6795000	6797000	Oh, what's that say about you, Rob Roberts?
6797000	6802000	But, yeah, I mean, cool that Night Trap is 25, I guess.
6802000	6809000	Now, I'm not sure if this is the same Night Trap remaster that was a Kickstarter, a really shitty Kickstarter.
6809000	6813000	This may be a whole different thing since it's actually going to be releasing in spring.
6813000	6815000	But it is coming. Soon.
6815000	6818000	And that's all we know about it. We don't know anything other than it's Night Trap.
6818000	6820000	I guess that's all you really need to know.
6820000	6822000	For most people, that's what they need to know.
6822000	6828000	I guess it's cool that it's getting a physical release on PlayStation 4, but I'm going to be that bitch for a minute.
6828000	6830000	Why? Why?
6830000	6832000	This game is not that good.
6832000	6834000	It's not that good a game.
6834000	6836000	You had this as the classic game of the week like a month ago.
6836000	6840000	We just recently were talking about Night Trap on this show.
6840000	6844000	Excuse me. Night Trap is not that good of a game.
6844000	6849000	You know, the thing that Night Trap did for us is that it gave us the ESRB.
6849000	6852000	Now, granted, Mortal Kombat helped with that, too.
6852000	6857000	But Night Trap was that game that Joe Lieberman had the copy of at the congressional hearings and so forth.
6857000	6859000	So the game industry created the ESRB.
6859000	6864000	Because why? Because there's women in it that are wearing tight shirts?
6864000	6866000	Is that why you think of the children?
6866000	6872000	Well, maybe Jamie remembers this a little better, but I seem to remember some of the depictions of the killing of the girls with the real problem.
6872000	6875000	And by today's standards, it's really tame.
6875000	6881000	Well, isn't that... It's funny you bring that up because I heard that this game is rated T for Teen now.
6881000	6883000	It's not even M game anymore.
6883000	6888000	But the version that I have is the pre-edited version.
6888000	6890000	Oh, so maybe there's some edits in here that are making...
6890000	6892000	There were edits.
6892000	6899000	Because after the advent of the ESRB, there was a re-release of it that was toned down some.
6899000	6902000	I guess Dungeon Buster in chat has a good point.
6902000	6905000	Why does Mad Dog McCree keep getting re-releases?
6905000	6907000	I don't know. Because it's probably a cheap license is what it is.
6907000	6909000	Fucking somebody's buying it, I guess.
6909000	6915000	The company Screaming Villains, who's actually developing the sequel though, or sequel remaster, I guess.
6915000	6919000	They have their website, which doesn't really have anything on there except for the trailer.
6919000	6923000	But it also does have a free copy of the Night Trap theme song.
6923000	6928000	Or a remaster of the theme song if you want to play that until it comes out.
6928000	6930000	So check it out.
6931000	6935000	Alright, well hooray for those of you guys that are super into Night Trap.
6935000	6938000	A question from chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
6938000	6940000	SSJ100Matt says,
6940000	6944000	Rob, was Sleepaway Camp good when it came out? I think it's just a cult classic.
6944000	6947000	Let's be clear, that movie was never good.
6947000	6951000	So yes, it's just a cult classic.
6951000	6954000	But are you trying to compare Night Trap to Sleepaway Camp?
6954000	6957000	I don't know if those two things can be compared.
6957000	6959000	I would totally play a Sleepaway Camp game though.
6959000	6963000	Again, if you've never seen Sleepaway Camp, you owe it to yourself.
6963000	6969000	Do not fucking read about it. Do not spoil the ending to Sleepaway Camp.
6969000	6973000	The ending is like such the cherry on top of...
6973000	6976000	Well, and by today's standards, it's problematic.
6976000	6982000	But remember, put your 1983 hat on and go watch Sleepaway Camp.
6982000	6985000	It's such a silly, stupid movie, but it is.
6985000	6990000	The ending though, it's just so ridiculous that it just made it...
6990000	6992000	I remember watching that for the first time.
6992000	6997000	And we were just uncontrollably laughing at the end.
6997000	6999000	Just like the last scene with the music and everything.
6999000	7001000	We were just like...
7001000	7003000	It was just so ridiculous.
7003000	7005000	It's more random than anything.
7005000	7007000	It is random.
7007000	7009000	It's very random.
7009000	7012000	Anyway, JD in chat says,
7012000	7014000	I don't have a 1983 cap.
7014000	7016000	Well, knit one.
7016000	7018000	Dark Soccer.
7018000	7020000	You know what? I know Dark Soccer's twist this year
7020000	7023000	is she does once a month the classic system of the week.
7023000	7025000	But I'm thinking next year, for 2018,
7025000	7028000	you might need to do the classic movie of the week,
7028000	7030000	of the month or something.
7030000	7032000	The first movie is Xanadu.
7032000	7034000	Xanadu.
7034000	7036000	Classic 80s movie.
7036000	7038000	That was 1980 as well.
7038000	7040000	If you were smart in the way you planned it out,
7040000	7043000	you could still say Xanadu ties into video games
7043000	7045000	because there's DDR,
7045000	7047000	there's the Don Bluth animation sequences,
7047000	7051000	which those games were a huge part of arcades in the early 80s, right?
7051000	7053000	Dragon's Lair, Space Ace.
7053000	7055000	So there's ways...
7055000	7058000	And where did you play a lot of video games in the early 80s?
7058000	7060000	At the roller rink, right?
7060000	7062000	Mostly Frogger.
7062000	7065000	I still can't play Frogger if I'm not wearing roller skates.
7065000	7067000	True.
7067000	7069000	Try playing Spy Hunter with roller skates
7069000	7071000	because you have the acceleration pedal.
7071000	7073000	Oh my god.
7073000	7075000	But anyway, my thought is,
7075000	7077000	I think we need to do like a movie
7077000	7080000	and you're going to tangentially relate these movies to video games somehow.
7080000	7082000	You could do it.
7082000	7084000	I guess.
7084000	7086000	This movie came out in 1983,
7086000	7088000	which is also the year that Blink came out.
7088000	7090000	There. Tie-in.
7090000	7092000	And Kevin Bacon. The end.
7092000	7095000	I just committed all of us to a 16th year of Orange Lounge Radio.
7095000	7098000	Look at that. Check that out in 2018.
7098000	7100000	Girl, you can do the segment.
7100000	7102000	Alright.
7102000	7104000	Is that a challenge? Alright.
7104000	7106000	Maybe a... Bitch, it might be.
7106000	7108000	Well, okay, wait.
7108000	7110000	Not to get too tangential, but we're running a little
7110000	7112000	early tonight, so I can do a few tangent.
7112000	7114000	Tangent us? Never.
7114000	7116000	What if, and what would the listeners think about this,
7116000	7118000	what if it was like a
7118000	7120000	YouTube spin-off
7120000	7122000	of OLR to do like a classic
7122000	7124000	movie of the... Do I gotta...
7124000	7126000	Yes.
7126000	7128000	YouTube's where it's at now.
7128000	7130000	Okay, but
7130000	7132000	we have to have like snarky videos and bad animation.
7132000	7134000	We can, we can probably have all of that.
7134000	7136000	Okay. We could do a classic movie of the...
7136000	7138000	I could actually just finally sit down and learn iMovie.
7138000	7140000	There you go. Now we're talking.
7140000	7142000	Okay, there you go.
7142000	7144000	See, some of the folks in chat are
7144000	7146000	SHO 100 Matt says yes, Dr. C says sure.
7146000	7148000	JD says, actually Rob
7148000	7150000	talking about movies would be a super interesting segment
7150000	7152000	since he knows his cult movies. Well, thank you.
7152000	7154000	Yeah, I know a thing or two about cult movies.
7154000	7156000	Maybe that should just be our thing.
7156000	7158000	Like, this is what we remember about these shitty
7158000	7160000	movies.
7160000	7162000	Do I want to talk about this on air?
7162000	7164000	Dot, dot, dot. Okay. Do it.
7164000	7166000	Do it. So,
7166000	7168000	y'all know I am involved with Rocky Horror Picture
7168000	7170000	Show here in Sacramento, right? No.
7170000	7172000	You guys know about that. And
7172000	7174000	the guy who puts it on has a whole
7174000	7176000	organization of events that he does, and one of the
7176000	7178000	things that he does is a thing called Sinister Creature Con.
7178000	7180000	So, last year,
7180000	7182000	or no, two years ago, excuse me, at Sinister Creature Con,
7182000	7184000	he let me moderate the panel.
7184000	7186000	It's one of the highlights of my life, really, that had
7186000	7188000	Patricia Quinn, Nell Campbell, and
7188000	7190000	Barry Bostwick, who played Magenta, Columbia, and Brad
7190000	7192000	in the movie. I got to do that panel, so it was really cool.
7192000	7194000	Like, me and these, like, three legit
7194000	7196000	movie stars, like, on the panel. It was awesome.
7196000	7198000	And she was Magenta on stage.
7198000	7200000	She was, and she was Columbia on stage.
7200000	7202000	So,
7202000	7204000	guess who one of his
7204000	7206000	big lands is
7206000	7208000	for this October's
7208000	7210000	Sinister Creature Con in Sacramento. Tim Curry.
7210000	7212000	No, God, I wish. It has nothing to do
7212000	7214000	with Rocky Horror, but everything to do with cult movies.
7214000	7216000	And video games, there's a reason I'm bringing this
7216000	7218000	up on OLR. What's his face from The Last
7218000	7220000	Starfighter? No.
7220000	7222000	Uwe Boll is going to be there.
7222000	7224000	Oh my God.
7224000	7226000	So, I'm thinking
7226000	7228000	about, do I need to phone in a favor and
7228000	7230000	ask to do that panel?
7230000	7232000	Like, do I want to do that
7232000	7234000	panel? Do I not want to do that panel? He's out of the movie
7234000	7236000	industry now for you. He is. He's doing
7236000	7238000	something else now.
7238000	7240000	He is. Is it like a restaurant?
7240000	7242000	I think he's doing something.
7242000	7244000	How many explosions are in his restaurant?
7244000	7246000	The reason why I bring that up is that if we do
7246000	7248000	this whole YouTube thing,
7248000	7250000	maybe, maybe we could get some
7250000	7252000	interviews and talk to some of these cult people.
7252000	7254000	So, that could be a something,
7254000	7256000	something thing that comes up anyway.
7256000	7258000	S.G.O. 100 Matt says, bring on a
7258000	7260000	special guest like Travis. If I can get him out of the
7260000	7262000	retirement home, sure, I'd love to have him on.
7262000	7264000	Let's see,
7264000	7266000	William Renovay says, there should be a whole episode
7266000	7268000	of Rocky Horror. I could probably fill a
7268000	7270000	whole episode of Rocky Horror. So,
7270000	7272000	there you go. We'll see.
7272000	7274000	Anyway, I probably should have blurted that out on air
7274000	7276000	because that's still all under development, but it is
7276000	7278000	something I'm trying to,
7278000	7280000	I'm trying to
7280000	7282000	be a part of later this year.
7282000	7284000	Because I think it would be fun
7284000	7286000	if nothing else. Right, Loki?
7286000	7288000	It would be fun. I've already interviewed
7288000	7290000	Uwe Boll once. For what?
7290000	7292000	It was for Tunnel Rats. It was a
7292000	7294000	movie that he's, it was
7294000	7296000	kind of the reverse. He was making a movie that they're
7296000	7298000	going to be making a game off of. So, we did a phone interview
7298000	7300000	with him at my previous job.
7300000	7302000	He's alright. I don't know.
7302000	7304000	We didn't learn too much from, I mean,
7304000	7306000	Despite his reputation,
7306000	7308000	I bet he's actually a pretty normal person.
7308000	7310000	He's just a person.
7310000	7312000	I mean, whatever. He exploited,
7312000	7314000	he exploited German tax laws to make
7314000	7316000	movies and make money. Just like Adam Sandler
7316000	7318000	exploits whatever
7318000	7320000	to, you know, make movies with his
7320000	7322000	friends so his friends get a constant
7322000	7324000	check and he can go vacation with them.
7324000	7326000	Didn't they say those movies are like the most
7326000	7328000	watched thing on Netflix right now? Yeah, they make a ton of money
7328000	7330000	and they, like, stealthily get onto Netflix
7330000	7332000	and it's funny, but... Who's fucking
7332000	7334000	watching it? Knock it off. Ford people.
7334000	7336000	They're, you know what, I mean,
7336000	7338000	honestly, though, like... More power to them, I guess.
7338000	7340000	It's seriously, like, look at this guy.
7340000	7342000	I mean, he's supported his friends,
7342000	7344000	like, his best friends. I mean, if, if I
7344000	7346000	could get paid, in fact, we had talked
7346000	7348000	about this, like, a long time ago, like, with,
7348000	7350000	you know, Eric and stuff, like, if we
7350000	7352000	get paid, lots of money to make really
7352000	7354000	shitty movies and just dumb movies that we
7354000	7356000	find funny
7356000	7358000	and just do that with our friends and get to go vacation
7358000	7360000	places and buy cars for ourselves,
7360000	7362000	fuck yeah, why wouldn't
7362000	7364000	I do that? I would totally do that. So,
7364000	7366000	Loki, I don't know if you've heard, but there's a website
7366000	7368000	out there called YouTube
7368000	7370000	and you can make
7370000	7372000	dumb shit and put it on YouTube and
7372000	7374000	you put these ads in front of it
7374000	7376000	and you make money. Yeah, but I haven't heard
7376000	7378000	that they have, they don't put ads in front of
7378000	7380000	controversial stuff now.
7380000	7382000	Remember, YouTube's become quite, quite
7382000	7384000	the shit right now. That's, like, legit,
7384000	7386000	like, fucking hate speech stuff. I don't
7386000	7388000	think your movies would... No, it's everything
7388000	7390000	because, you know, YouTube is
7390000	7392000	run by a high, trained professional
7392000	7394000	team of computer
7394000	7396000	animated bots that don't actually, you know,
7396000	7398000	have any sort of soul, they just basically go
7398000	7400000	out there and go, yeah, I think this is this, but
7400000	7402000	we're, we're gonna, hopefully that's correct.
7402000	7404000	The LGBT community had a huge problem
7404000	7406000	with the whole, like, a bunch of LGBT,
7406000	7408000	like, coming out videos or being labeled restricted
7408000	7410000	as adult content and it, like,
7410000	7412000	they're actually not, it's not, they're
7412000	7414000	not talking about anything adult. They're
7414000	7416000	talking about experiences that
7416000	7418000	sometimes help other people and so forth.
7418000	7420000	Advertisers, they don't like that.
7420000	7422000	Anyway, alright.
7422000	7424000	Alright, we've gone down too many tangents.
7424000	7426000	It's time to pull the train back into the
7426000	7428000	station and talk about, hey, something else
7428000	7430000	that you might be streaming on YouTube or
7430000	7432000	on Twitch or one of those. Persona 5,
7432000	7434000	remember, there was some, there were some
7434000	7436000	pretty strict guidelines that came out for Persona 5.
7436000	7438000	Well, shock and... Unenforceable guidelines.
7438000	7440000	Shock and awe. Atlas
7440000	7442000	has revised those guidelines.
7442000	7444000	That's right. The guidelines
7444000	7446000	have been, let's see,
7446000	7448000	changed a little bit. The new
7448000	7450000	guideline is that you can do video up to
7450000	7452000	the in-game date of
7452000	7454000	11-19. That's
7454000	7456000	before the game gears up for the final act.
7456000	7458000	Now, they also,
7458000	7460000	as a part of this, I'm gonna read this verbatim here,
7460000	7462000	we also want to apologize to those of you
7462000	7464000	who saw the previous guidelines blog post
7464000	7466000	as threatening. We wanted to be transparent
7466000	7468000	about what we do, and the reason we
7468000	7470000	released the guidelines was to give streamers the
7470000	7472000	right information up front. It was never
7472000	7474000	our intention to threaten people with copyright
7474000	7476000	strikes, but we clearly chose the wrong
7476000	7478000	tone for how to communicate this.
7478000	7480000	Because you said you threatened them with a copyright
7480000	7482000	strike. Yeah. Because you literally
7482000	7484000	did that. It wasn't the tone, it was
7484000	7486000	you literally came out and said, if you do this,
7486000	7488000	we're gonna strike your channel. Now, the
7488000	7490000	interesting thing is, they haven't said they're not
7490000	7492000	gonna do that, but at the same time, have we
7492000	7494000	heard of anybody actually getting copyright strikes
7494000	7496000	from this? Because, I have a friend
7496000	7498000	who put his entire playthrough of the game
7498000	7500000	on YouTube in like 53 segments or something
7500000	7502000	like that, haven't heard if there's been any
7502000	7504000	problems yet. I mean, granted, he's not a
7504000	7506000	huge streamer, so,
7506000	7508000	but still. I get it, you don't want your
7508000	7510000	game story ruined, but
7510000	7512000	you have no control over that.
7512000	7514000	You don't. You can't.
7514000	7516000	You can't say it's okay to put part of the
7516000	7518000	game on there. I don't think it's even
7518000	7520000	enforceable the way you can do that. Especially
7520000	7522000	if they're commenting over it and there's like actual
7522000	7524000	transformative work being done
7524000	7526000	to it, you can't do it.
7526000	7528000	I do think, I
7528000	7530000	realize this is a complicated issue, it's not
7530000	7532000	easily gonna be solved. I do think
7532000	7534000	there should be revenue sharing
7534000	7536000	available. I do think that
7536000	7538000	Atlus should be able to share
7538000	7540000	in what, especially,
7540000	7542000	especially when there is no
7542000	7544000	commentary or nothing else going on, Atlus
7544000	7546000	does deserve it. When there's
7546000	7548000	commentary and stuff, I do believe
7548000	7550000	Atlus, as they've made the game, they should
7550000	7552000	be entitled to some of the revenue,
7552000	7554000	but I don't think they should get to dictate
7554000	7556000	oh, you do this, but not that.
7556000	7558000	They already get some of the revenue when I purchase
7558000	7560000	their fucking game. No, seriously,
7560000	7562000	they're not entitled to any of that, and you know
7562000	7564000	why? Because Nintendo does this shit.
7564000	7566000	Nintendo
7566000	7568000	monetizes every single
7568000	7570000	video out there, unless
7570000	7572000	you just, you know,
7572000	7574000	join up in their
7574000	7576000	special club where they get most of the
7576000	7578000	profits anyways. That's still a thing?
7578000	7580000	That's still a thing. Oh, I didn't know. So, I mean,
7580000	7582000	I'm sorry, we've already seen how back ass
7582000	7584000	words that shit is. I do not want more companies
7584000	7586000	jumping on board with that.
7586000	7588000	Alright, we need to get on to some more stories. We
7588000	7590000	will be taking your calls at Orange Lounge
7590000	7592000	Radio on Skype in a little while, but first,
7592000	7594000	Dark Sakura,
7594000	7596000	with something a little different. Yes.
7596000	7598000	Well, um, this
7598000	7600000	has been, uh, you know,
7600000	7602000	Call of Duty isn't necessarily, like, my
7602000	7604000	favorite ever game,
7604000	7606000	but they're doing a World War
7606000	7608000	2 campaign that,
7608000	7610000	um, has a multiplayer mode that lets you
7610000	7612000	play as, uh, female combatants.
7612000	7614000	And, um,
7614000	7616000	it's funny, because
7616000	7618000	I've seen some people
7618000	7620000	get kind of fussy about it, like, they'll
7620000	7622000	like, we were actually commenting on
7622000	7624000	before the show, there'll be people who
7624000	7626000	are cool with having, you know,
7626000	7628000	Nazi zombies, but
7628000	7630000	get all fussy about women
7630000	7632000	in combat. But even
7632000	7634000	back then, I mean, now the
7634000	7636000	US was definitely a lot more stuffy about
7636000	7638000	it, but, um, there were
7638000	7640000	women combatants in World War
7640000	7642000	2. There were, uh,
7642000	7644000	in fact, a very famous, uh, group
7644000	7646000	of, uh, Russian snipers,
7646000	7648000	um, who,
7648000	7650000	uh, were, uh,
7650000	7652000	actually had some of the highest
7652000	7654000	kill counts of any of, uh,
7654000	7656000	of the combatants. There, uh,
7656000	7658000	were also, uh, people in the
7658000	7660000	Air Force. There are plenty of
7660000	7662000	American women were, uh, also involved
7662000	7664000	in, uh,
7664000	7666000	uh, aircraft, in, um,
7666000	7668000	transport. A good number
7668000	7670000	of Canadian, too. We had,
7670000	7672000	um, medical, uh, sorry, transport vehicle
7672000	7674000	drivers, um, and not
7674000	7676000	just in, you know,
7676000	7678000	working in, like, you know,
7678000	7680000	canteens or as a cook
7680000	7682000	or as a, you know, clerk, but,
7682000	7684000	uh, women who,
7684000	7686000	uh, were
7686000	7688000	very, very important to the whole,
7688000	7690000	uh, war effort
7690000	7692000	in World War 2, just all over the world.
7692000	7694000	So, um,
7694000	7696000	I think it's not too far-fetched
7696000	7698000	to have, um,
7698000	7700000	female
7700000	7702000	combatants in a World War
7702000	7704000	2 era game, so.
7704000	7706000	Why not? Sure. I mean, I think this is,
7706000	7708000	you know, as much as we've made
7708000	7710000	a lot of strides in the past ten years
7710000	7712000	to try to bring more
7712000	7714000	representation in games,
7714000	7716000	I mean, Call of Duty definitely
7716000	7718000	has that label as a brotastic
7718000	7720000	type of video game,
7720000	7722000	so I think that's really cool that
7722000	7724000	they're bringing in, you know, a way
7724000	7726000	for more women to get into Call of Duty by
7726000	7728000	playing something that can represent themselves a little more.
7728000	7730000	Did you know that even Queen Elizabeth II
7730000	7732000	was, um, uh, enlisted
7732000	7734000	in 1945? That doesn't surprise
7734000	7736000	me, considering her family is kinda
7736000	7738000	always, like, I know, like, William and
7738000	7740000	and Harry were in the military
7740000	7742000	and all that, so, you know, that family kinda has a
7742000	7744000	military history to them, so. And see,
7744000	7746000	what I would like to see is if
7746000	7748000	they were gonna do, like, a World War 2 era
7748000	7750000	game, I would wanna do something
7750000	7752000	where someone fights as, like, a resistance member.
7752000	7754000	You would be very proud of our chatters
7754000	7756000	right now, by the way, because, like, they are saying things
7756000	7758000	like, Justice, you're about to say them, Lady JJ
7758000	7760000	just pointed out the Queen Elizabeth II thing,
7760000	7762000	uh, S.G.O. and Hunter Matt
7762000	7764000	talked about the Russian snipers thing,
7764000	7766000	and so it's, it's funny that, like, they're
7766000	7768000	naming stuff right, you'd be very proud of her. Hey, Lady
7768000	7770000	JJ, I'm glad you can make it in.
7770000	7772000	You'd be very proud of our listeners tonight.
7772000	7774000	But, um, I mean,
7774000	7776000	and even, there were, uh,
7776000	7778000	of course, I learned a lot more, you know,
7778000	7780000	studying, uh, the effects of
7780000	7782000	the Holocaust, there was, um,
7782000	7784000	a Jewish resistance leader named Hannah
7784000	7786000	Senesch, who, um,
7786000	7788000	uh, she
7788000	7790000	airdropped several times into Germany
7790000	7792000	to spread, uh, propaganda
7792000	7794000	and to help the resistance
7794000	7796000	and ended up being tortured and murdered
7796000	7798000	by the Nazis. You know, plenty
7798000	7800000	of, of women who, you know,
7800000	7802000	I know there's a lot of women involved, it's about
7802000	7804000	planes, like, usually, like, the flights and the planes
7804000	7806000	stuff, like, a lot of women got involved in that.
7806000	7808000	Or even, um, performers, there were plenty
7808000	7810000	of performers who would, you know, pass
7810000	7812000	notes and, and get information
7812000	7814000	from people, but the whole
7814000	7816000	thing is, is that, don't just
7816000	7818000	look at a historical war
7818000	7820000	through a patriarchal lens.
7820000	7822000	I mean, and I'm not meaning to use,
7822000	7824000	like, buzz feminist words, you know,
7824000	7826000	whatever. It's truly
7826000	7828000	clouded by
7828000	7830000	a lot of male-centric discussion.
7830000	7832000	Don't discount that women played their part
7832000	7834000	in war, or that we still
7834000	7836000	play a part in war. What is it, like, six years ago,
7836000	7838000	um, the Air Force passed, uh,
7838000	7840000	uh, their first female sniper
7840000	7842000	through their Sniper Academy.
7842000	7844000	Um, it's
7844000	7846000	just, don't discount it, you know.
7846000	7848000	If you say, oh, well, so
7848000	7850000	and so was never in the war, there were
7850000	7852000	women who fought in
7852000	7854000	the American Civil War, on both sides,
7854000	7856000	who would,
7856000	7858000	in some cases, quite literally, cross-dressed
7858000	7860000	to be in the army, or be in
7860000	7862000	whichever militia. It's been going
7862000	7864000	on for years. There's even, like, French
7864000	7866000	nobles who, um,
7866000	7868000	were absolutely famous
7868000	7870000	for, uh, women who
7870000	7872000	adopted men's dress. Well, and Mulan.
7872000	7874000	I couldn't, I'm sorry, I couldn't help it.
7874000	7876000	I'm sorry. Well, even, even
7876000	7878000	Joan of Arc. Yeah, sure, of course. She
7878000	7880000	was burned, not just for, you know,
7880000	7882000	being, uh, in resistance
7882000	7884000	to, uh, England's armies, but
7884000	7886000	she was actually more burned
7886000	7888000	as a heretic for refusing to wear women's clothing.
7888000	7890000	Because she was female.
7890000	7892000	So, I'm just saying,
7892000	7894000	if you have an argument about
7894000	7896000	a game because of some preconceived notion,
7896000	7898000	actually take some time and study the fucking history.
7898000	7900000	The end.
7900000	7902000	Okay. This week on
7902000	7904000	Jamie Takes On Video Games.
7904000	7906000	I'm a, I'm a big history
7906000	7908000	nerd, too. I do not disagree
7908000	7910000	with what you're saying, and I think it's really cool that
7910000	7912000	the video games are, like, reflecting, you know,
7912000	7914000	the more diversities of, of, of
7914000	7916000	how World War II affected
7916000	7918000	everybody. You know what I mean?
7918000	7920000	Exactly. I mean, it was a world
7920000	7922000	war for a reason. And, you know,
7922000	7924000	history is kind of repeating itself, so
7924000	7926000	keep your eyes open.
7926000	7928000	Alright.
7928000	7930000	Uh, let's move on. Uh, just a few more
7930000	7932000	stories for you guys, and then the Skype line. But first,
7932000	7934000	If I may say. Oh, yeah. SSG100 Matt
7934000	7936000	said, thankfully, our listener group doesn't think that way.
7936000	7938000	And, yes, bless you all.
7938000	7940000	I love you all.
7940000	7942000	Doesn't think in the terms of.
7942000	7944000	There might be somebody new to the show who might
7944000	7946000	be like, oh, I didn't think about it that way before.
7946000	7948000	Well, then, good. I hope to open
7948000	7950000	some eyes. Exactly. That's all, that's
7950000	7952000	all it is. Just think, think a little different.
7952000	7954000	Bend over and take it.
7954000	7956000	I'm kidding. Jamie.
7956000	7958000	Oh, come on. You know it's me. Alright.
7958000	7960000	Moving on. A few more stories for you guys.
7960000	7962000	Loki. So, um,
7962000	7964000	not too long ago, um,
7964000	7966000	GTA V, you know,
7966000	7968000	this whole, um, stunt
7968000	7970000	racing and stuff
7970000	7972000	that they kind of added to the game that
7972000	7974000	really, I thought, made the racing really
7974000	7976000	better, you know, with all these loops and
7976000	7978000	ramps and crazy shit.
7978000	7980000	So, it's only appropriate that Forza
7980000	7982000	Horizon 3 has Hot Wheel DLC
7982000	7984000	coming with all the fucking loops and
7984000	7986000	shit they would find in the orange
7986000	7988000	track to bear. And it looks
7988000	7990000	fantastic. I mean, it
7990000	7992000	just looks seriously
7992000	7994000	cool from the trailer that I saw.
7994000	7996000	You like this kind of over-the-top
7996000	7998000	shit though. I know, I'm all
7998000	8000000	on board for this too. Yeah, it looks great.
8000000	8002000	I mean, the game, I mean, itself was
8002000	8004000	pretty good, but now it's... You know what it
8004000	8006000	reminds me of? Hard Drivin'.
8006000	8008000	You remember that game? Yeah, right.
8008000	8010000	I used to take a nap in that.
8010000	8012000	It was a giant cabinet, right?
8012000	8014000	And it was like the, the early
8014000	8016000	days of, and I'm using my quotey fingers,
8016000	8018000	virtual reality type games. Yeah, like
8018000	8020000	was it Test Drive 3?
8020000	8022000	Polygons, yeah. But like,
8022000	8024000	Hard Drivin' was like that first game where you had like
8024000	8026000	the ramp and you had like a loop
8026000	8028000	and all this crazy shit. And now
8028000	8030000	it's like, oh, that, it's like
8030000	8032000	making that on hardware
8032000	8034000	in 2017. Pretty cool.
8034000	8036000	It looks cool though. Seriously, it's gonna be 20 bucks.
8036000	8038000	The expansion by itself
8038000	8040000	is $20. Or if you bought the
8040000	8042000	games expansion pass, which
8042000	8044000	is $35, you get that for free as
8044000	8046000	well. It's coming out May
8046000	8048000	9th on
8048000	8050000	Xbox One. I'm assuming PC since
8050000	8052000	it's a Windows 10 game. Yes.
8052000	8054000	But yeah, definitely check that out.
8054000	8056000	It looks really cool.
8056000	8058000	Alright, well one more story
8058000	8060000	for you guys before we open up the Skype line and
8060000	8062000	that has to do with, hey
8062000	8064000	guess what? Sometimes people
8064000	8066000	online who, you know, when they do, we
8066000	8068000	hear about these websites getting
8068000	8070000	hit with DDoS attacks and stuff,
8070000	8072000	we're wondering, when are some of these people gonna
8072000	8074000	go to jail for breaking the
8074000	8076000	law? And guess what?
8076000	8078000	Somebody's finally going to jail for
8078000	8080000	some of this shit. So it
8080000	8082000	was the Central Criminal Court of England
8082000	8084000	in Wales who found
8084000	8086000	20 year old Adam Mudd
8086000	8088000	guilty of creating a
8088000	8090000	malware program that did
8090000	8092000	distributed denial of service or DDoS
8092000	8094000	attacks on computer network.
8094000	8096000	Apparently it has caused 1.7
8096000	8098000	million cyber attacks since
8098000	8100000	2013. The malware
8100000	8102000	was sold under a pseudonym and
8102000	8104000	apparently made $400,000 from
8104000	8106000	112,000 registered
8106000	8108000	users. Let's see, apparently
8108000	8110000	there's gaming companies that have been
8110000	8112000	attacked like Xbox Live,
8112000	8114000	Minecraft, and the MMORPG
8114000	8116000	RuneScape. The
8116000	8118000	DDoS would overload the company's networks
8118000	8120000	with too much data and that would interrupt the
8120000	8122000	connection to the internet and then they're
8122000	8124000	unable to process the user request. And I think we
8124000	8126000	all remember when Xbox Live and I think PlayStation
8126000	8128000	Network got shut, I'm not saying that
8128000	8130000	that is the same program that shut these
8130000	8132000	things down, but we all
8132000	8134000	remember when that happened on, like on
8134000	8136000	Christmas, right? Didn't PlayStation Network go down
8136000	8138000	on Christmas? It was really fucking rude,
8138000	8140000	whatever it was they did. So, there we go.
8140000	8142000	The judge
8142000	8144000	wanted to make this sentence a
8144000	8146000	strong deterrent to future
8146000	8148000	cyber criminals and sentence Mudd
8148000	8150000	to two years of jail and that will
8150000	8152000	be served in a young offenders institution
8152000	8154000	because I guess 20 is still a young offender
8154000	8156000	over there. Whereas
8156000	8158000	here, that would, you'd be
8158000	8160000	in, you'd be in, you'd be in
8160000	8162000	regular, you'd be in prison
8162000	8164000	Orange is the new black style.
8164000	8166000	No juvie hall over 18
8166000	8168000	so, but I guess it's a little
8168000	8170000	different over there, so.
8170000	8172000	There you go, somebody finally going to jail for DDoSing
8172000	8174000	so, there you go.
8174000	8176000	Alright, wasn't that a prediction
8176000	8178000	on a, not this year, probably last year,
8178000	8180000	but I think I said one of them would get the death penalty.
8180000	8182000	I think that was 2016. I think that's a bit much.
8182000	8184000	Just chop off their fingers.
8184000	8186000	I still could have gotten a half point.
8186000	8188000	Alright, hey
8188000	8190000	guess what guys, Skype line is open.
8190000	8192000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype
8192000	8194000	and if you want to do it the old fashioned way, 1-877-GAME-OLR
8194000	8196000	and guess what, our phone
8196000	8198000	is ringing, but we will catch up with
8198000	8200000	Loki on some last minute stories in a moment.
8200000	8202000	But first, hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
8202000	8204000	Hey, what's going on, it's Ranma.
8204000	8206000	Hey Ranma, how you doing?
8206000	8208000	Pretty good, I just got in from another convention
8208000	8210000	about a good hour and a half ago.
8210000	8212000	I know, I saw the picture, you were hanging out
8212000	8214000	with your posse from Anime Jam
8214000	8216000	Session and I saw John from Critical Myth in those pictures
8216000	8218000	so, you guys had a good
8218000	8220000	good old time, hello hello, and I hope you had fun.
8220000	8222000	It was so much fun
8222000	8224000	that I would say this, next
8224000	8226000	year, y'all gotta come out for this
8226000	8228000	convention, that's how much fun, how much
8228000	8230000	how great it is. Which con is it?
8230000	8232000	Zenkai Con, it's right in Lancaster
8232000	8234000	County. I've heard of that before.
8234000	8236000	But you know,
8236000	8238000	realistically, I don't know if it
8238000	8240000	would be in the budget for me to do another East Coast
8240000	8242000	con, I'd have to choose between that
8242000	8244000	and Magfest and, well,
8244000	8246000	hate to break it to you buddy, but, you know
8246000	8248000	Magfest's gonna win that one. You're coming with me to
8248000	8250000	DragCon next year anyway.
8250000	8252000	That's true.
8252000	8254000	It sucks, when I switched jobs
8254000	8256000	I lost 10 days of work
8256000	8258000	off a year, I went from 25 days off to
8258000	8260000	15, so it's like I really have to pick and choose my
8260000	8262000	cons now.
8262000	8264000	Well, we could always do this.
8264000	8266000	You could always do Magfest, you could
8266000	8268000	crash at Michael John's place until
8268000	8270000	the con, you just work remotely.
8270000	8272000	If I wasn't a corporate
8272000	8274000	trainer who needed to be in a classroom all day
8274000	8276000	I would consider that.
8276000	8278000	Video technology my friend!
8278000	8280000	I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what, when I'm a
8280000	8282000	famous YouTuber,
8282000	8284000	I'll go to all the cons.
8284000	8286000	When I can quit my job and be a famous YouTuber.
8286000	8288000	Sounds like a plan.
8288000	8290000	Sounds like a plan my friend.
8290000	8292000	Well no, I'm really glad you had a good time at the con though.
8292000	8294000	Was there any type of gaming stuff at the con, or was it mostly
8294000	8296000	anime?
8296000	8298000	It was a mix of everything, and what I'm starting to
8298000	8300000	see now, Bemani is
8300000	8302000	coming back.
8302000	8304000	I don't know if you were here at the beginning of the show,
8304000	8306000	but somebody made a comment at the beginning of the show,
8306000	8308000	and I kind of mentioned that I kind of felt
8308000	8310000	DDR was going through a renaissance,
8310000	8312000	but I really should have clarified that saying
8312000	8314000	Bemani is going through a renaissance, because
8314000	8316000	definitely things like Ubeat
8316000	8318000	is like at conventions, there's always a
8318000	8320000	fucking line to play Ubeat, whether it's
8320000	8322000	Dragon Con or Magfest or wherever I'm at
8322000	8324000	that has those machines, and then
8324000	8326000	SoundVoltex is doing very well it seems as well,
8326000	8328000	so it really isn't
8328000	8330000	just DDR, but that's just kind of
8330000	8332000	the grandpa of those games.
8332000	8334000	True, true, true.
8334000	8336000	So, but those games
8336000	8338000	having a great presence at Zenkai Con
8338000	8340000	it sounds like?
8340000	8342000	A small presence because the gaming room
8342000	8344000	wasn't that big, but what I'm seeing in general
8344000	8346000	over the last year and a half,
8346000	8348000	big or small,
8348000	8350000	the dance rhythm games are coming back pretty strong.
8350000	8352000	Oh, that's great.
8352000	8354000	I know
8354000	8356000	speaking of all the dance game stuff,
8356000	8358000	you guys probably know Kyle Ward
8358000	8360000	who was on this show, oh god
8360000	8362000	it was probably a couple years ago at this point, but
8362000	8364000	you know, at the time we were talking about some of the
8364000	8366000	stuff he's been doing with the cell phone games, well now
8366000	8368000	I'm seeing a lot of activity now with his
8368000	8370000	what did they end up calling the machine?
8370000	8372000	It's like Step Maniacs, right?
8372000	8374000	That's the name of it. It's like Step Mania
8374000	8376000	but with an X. So, like, and it seems
8376000	8378000	like this is, you know, a lot of people are
8378000	8380000	really, really anticipating this game,
8380000	8382000	this Step Maniacs game, and
8382000	8384000	you know, I remember playing it at Magfest
8384000	8386000	and it really looks like it's coming together, and I love the idea
8386000	8388000	of the main screen being a touch screen.
8388000	8390000	And then there's not just that,
8390000	8392000	but fucking, did you, I didn't even know this was out
8392000	8394000	on iPhones now,
8394000	8396000	but Neon FM
8396000	8398000	is fucking out on hand-helds
8398000	8400000	and it syncs up with
8400000	8402000	the arcade versions.
8402000	8404000	I didn't know that was a thing now.
8404000	8406000	I remember talking about
8406000	8408000	Neon FM fucking like 2005,
8408000	8410000	like in the early days of OLR.
8410000	8412000	This is crazy.
8412000	8414000	But in a good way.
8414000	8416000	Sure enough.
8416000	8418000	Rob, you want to know something?
8418000	8420000	That's not why I called in.
8420000	8422000	Oh, that's alright. Well, why did you call in?
8422000	8424000	I wanted to talk to you about
8424000	8426000	your thoughts. I heard what you
8426000	8428000	had to say about Project Scorpio,
8428000	8430000	and you know what? I hear what
8430000	8432000	you're saying. I get it.
8432000	8434000	It's like
8434000	8436000	when you have a basic PC to do
8436000	8438000	stuff, and then
8438000	8440000	you got the basic PC to do stuff, play games,
8440000	8442000	do all this stuff, and you're happy. You got
8442000	8444000	the Uber PC that does everything
8444000	8446000	and much, much more.
8446000	8448000	The PS4 Pro, Project Scorpio,
8448000	8450000	I don't want to
8450000	8452000	use the word lazy,
8452000	8454000	but I'm going to use the word lazy.
8454000	8456000	It's a lazy way
8456000	8458000	of getting a high-end
8458000	8460000	gaming PC
8460000	8462000	or gaming console.
8462000	8464000	It's like
8464000	8466000	I just think these two
8466000	8468000	consoles are a way to fight back at the
8468000	8470000	quote-unquote master race of PC
8470000	8472000	gaming.
8472000	8474000	I sort of get that.
8474000	8476000	I think it's for people who
8476000	8478000	don't necessarily have an Uber-end PC,
8478000	8480000	but again, I'm not
8480000	8482000	saying that like, oh, I'm not getting
8482000	8484000	one, and my mind's made up. I'm
8484000	8486000	waiting to hear that out of E3, but
8486000	8488000	that's really what I'm saying is that
8488000	8490000	Microsoft needs to convince me at
8490000	8492000	E3, or if not me, if
8492000	8494000	what you're saying is really the
8494000	8496000	case where it's like, no, this system is not for me. It's for
8496000	8498000	these other people. Okay, then really, what is that
8498000	8500000	compelling case why people
8500000	8502000	need to spend the extra money on this
8502000	8504000	system?
8504000	8506000	What are the games going to be like?
8506000	8508000	What's Scorpio going to lend itself to with that?
8508000	8510000	What are those experiences going to be
8510000	8512000	that makes it a little worth it?
8512000	8514000	Because in some regards, I think Sony
8514000	8516000	has kind of peed in the pool
8516000	8518000	a little bit, because I don't
8518000	8520000	think the PlayStation 4 Pro
8520000	8522000	has really pushed things
8522000	8524000	forward immensely
8524000	8526000	in that regard, and now that's kind of what's
8526000	8528000	stuck in our heads, and I realize
8528000	8530000	Microsoft had nothing to do with that,
8530000	8532000	but I can't help but feel like
8532000	8534000	PlayStation has kind of
8534000	8536000	already kind of screwed it
8536000	8538000	up, if that makes sense?
8538000	8540000	It does. I kind of see it this way.
8540000	8542000	I mean, look at the specs between both consoles.
8542000	8544000	I mean, I kind of feel
8544000	8546000	that Sony is kind of banking
8546000	8548000	on the name PlayStation
8548000	8550000	to push the Pro, whereas
8550000	8552000	not everybody knows the Microsoft
8552000	8554000	brand per se. They know it, but it's like
8554000	8556000	gaming, nine times out of ten, especially
8556000	8558000	in the circles I roll with, more people
8558000	8560000	are more apt to go towards the PS4
8560000	8562000	because of the games, even though
8562000	8564000	the Xbox has the hardware
8564000	8566000	processing power. Now,
8566000	8568000	with Scorpio comes out, if the
8568000	8570000	price is right, and they can get
8570000	8572000	these companies behind
8572000	8574000	them with all these amazing games,
8574000	8576000	then we're going to be good. Now,
8576000	8578000	if they start doing exclusive
8578000	8580000	PS4 Pro and Scorpio
8580000	8582000	games, that's where we're going to
8582000	8584000	have a problem. But they need
8584000	8586000	to keep it at, keep the game
8586000	8588000	optimized for PS4
8588000	8590000	so that way you can play it on either
8590000	8592000	or. You can see the power
8592000	8594000	and graphical difference between both of those consoles
8594000	8596000	as if they're the Xbox One.
8596000	8598000	And I will say this now, and I'm not
8598000	8600000	saying this as an Xbox
8600000	8602000	fanboy, but you
8602000	8604000	get that one game
8604000	8606000	for both
8606000	8608000	consoles. And you
8608000	8610000	optimize it for their Pro systems.
8610000	8612000	I hate to break it to you, but it's
8612000	8614000	going on Scorpio, it's going to
8614000	8616000	blow it out of the water compared to the PS4
8616000	8618000	only because of the hardware that's
8618000	8620000	underneath it. Well, I have to ask this
8620000	8622000	because you made me think about something I've been
8622000	8624000	reading a lot about today. And again,
8624000	8626000	it's in the rumor camp very
8626000	8628000	firmly, but there's rumors
8628000	8630000	out there that PlayStation 5
8630000	8632000	is going to be 2018,
8632000	8634000	which seems
8634000	8636000	really early, but then
8636000	8638000	the way this kind of broke it down
8638000	8640000	is that there were six years
8640000	8642000	between PS1 and 2, six years
8642000	8644000	between 2 and 3, seven years
8644000	8646000	between 3 and 4,
8646000	8648000	but three needed time to
8648000	8650000	kind of catch on,
8650000	8652000	right? Three needed the extra year to catch up.
8652000	8654000	And then
8654000	8656000	this will be five years
8656000	8658000	if it comes out in 2018.
8658000	8660000	So it's not that far
8660000	8662000	off, but I can't help but feel
8662000	8664000	like that seems fast. I still think it's
8664000	8666000	pretty early into the consoles.
8666000	8668000	Well, let me tell you.
8668000	8670000	If they do announce
8670000	8672000	a PS5 between now
8672000	8674000	and December 2018,
8674000	8676000	I'll say it.
8676000	8678000	Sony's lost. They're playing a catch-up
8678000	8680000	game. They're starting to realize
8680000	8682000	we may have fucked up with the 4,
8682000	8684000	so we gotta catch up.
8684000	8686000	There is no reason to release a newer
8686000	8688000	console at that time.
8688000	8690000	You know? The most
8690000	8692000	they could probably do is up the processor
8692000	8694000	and up the graphics chip.
8694000	8696000	And at that point,
8696000	8698000	the games will probably look still wanting
8698000	8700000	to say. I'm not sure I
8700000	8702000	totally agree with you on that,
8702000	8704000	because Sony is
8704000	8706000	still selling very well. I don't think
8706000	8708000	there's really an oh shit moment, but I think
8708000	8710000	if there's anything oh shit in this,
8710000	8712000	it's that, oh,
8712000	8714000	Microsoft is gonna whip out the
8714000	8716000	teraflops with Scorpio,
8716000	8718000	so we need to put out PlayStation
8718000	8720000	5 to basically match Scorpio.
8720000	8722000	And if they do that, what
8722000	8724000	was the point of the PS4 Pro in the
8724000	8726000	first place?
8726000	8728000	And that's where I agree
8728000	8730000	with you. Yeah. In that case,
8730000	8732000	if that's what they're going to do, the original
8732000	8734000	PS4 is gonna get phased out, and they're
8734000	8736000	gonna relabel the Pro as the 4.
8736000	8738000	Remember, I mean,
8738000	8740000	if you look at what Sony has done with
8740000	8742000	their hardware, I mean, it
8742000	8744000	wouldn't surprise me if they do this.
8746000	8748000	I mean, we'll see. Again,
8748000	8750000	it's a little tinfoil
8750000	8752000	to fetish this PlayStation 5 stuff.
8752000	8754000	I still feel like there's a long life left
8754000	8756000	for PlayStation 4, especially if
8756000	8758000	5 is backwards compatible
8758000	8760000	with PlayStation 4, and that's the other way
8760000	8762000	I could see them doing it, is if
8762000	8764000	4 is 100% backwards compatible
8764000	8766000	with 5, so 5 is
8766000	8768000	really the Pro Pro,
8768000	8770000	the Pro Plus. What's
8770000	8772000	gonna end up happening is the Pro is gonna be a wash.
8772000	8774000	Or, what Rahm is saying is that
8774000	8776000	Pro is now the 4, and
8776000	8778000	that just kind of will happen
8778000	8780000	quietly. But,
8780000	8782000	the only real advantages are the 4K
8782000	8784000	things that, again, I think are really
8784000	8786000	subtle, but anyway,
8786000	8788000	I think we're getting ahead of ourselves.
8788000	8790000	I mean, we're trying to forecast 2018,
8790000	8792000	and we haven't even hit 2017's
8792000	8794000	E3 yet to really
8794000	8796000	truly know what Scorpio is.
8796000	8798000	Yeah, and
8798000	8800000	speaking of E3, yeah, go on.
8800000	8802000	No, go ahead.
8802000	8804000	I was gonna say, speaking of E3 2017,
8804000	8806000	is it wrong of me
8806000	8808000	to be smirky at some of my
8808000	8810000	friends who are excited about going to E3
8810000	8812000	for the very first time?
8812000	8814000	Eh, don't shit on their parade.
8814000	8816000	I don't say it, I just keep it to myself
8816000	8818000	because I know people who are going to
8818000	8820000	a con I'm going to, and then they're flying
8820000	8822000	out for E3, and I'm just like,
8822000	8824000	well, I guess
8824000	8826000	you'll have to discover how it really
8826000	8828000	is, you know? Because I just go back from
8828000	8830000	O-L-R
8830000	8832000	and we all tell me about E3, and I'm
8832000	8834000	just like, you know what?
8834000	8836000	There's no reason for me to go.
8836000	8838000	To be fair, the ESA
8838000	8840000	knows they've opened it up to the public
8840000	8842000	essentially this year. I think the show
8842000	8844000	will look different from the same
8844000	8846000	show that Dark Soccer, myself, and Loki
8846000	8848000	have attended in the past, and for
8848000	8850000	those reasons, those people may have
8850000	8852000	a very different experience than what
8852000	8854000	our experience has been with E3.
8854000	8856000	Only time will tell.
8856000	8858000	True, true that.
8858000	8860000	Alright, well,
8860000	8862000	Rama, I'm gonna let you go to try to squeeze in another call or two,
8862000	8864000	and we're gonna wrap up, but thanks so much for your call, buddy. I appreciate it.
8864000	8866000	Ain't no problem, dude. Alright, later.
8866000	8868000	Later. Alright,
8868000	8870000	Orange Launch Radio, all one word on Skype,
8870000	8872000	if you want to give us a call. Meanwhile,
8872000	8874000	Loki, did you have any last minute stories you want to get out there?
8874000	8876000	Or Dark Soccer, if you have anything. Yeah, I was gonna mention that
8876000	8878000	the PlayStation 4 has hit
8878000	8880000	60 million units sold.
8880000	8882000	That was 20
8882000	8884000	million of which were last year.
8884000	8886000	Also, the PlayStation 3 is
8886000	8888000	closing in on 80 million
8888000	8890000	sold. That means
8890000	8892000	4 is probably gonna sell more in its lifeline
8892000	8894000	than the 3 did. Yeah.
8894000	8896000	When all is said and done, because keep in mind,
8896000	8898000	even if they do announce the PlayStation
8898000	8900000	5 in 2018, that's still another
8900000	8902000	like, two
8902000	8904000	years of PS4 sales,
8904000	8906000	and it's still, they're still, still, still
8906000	8908000	sell 4's as a quote-unquote
8908000	8910000	budget con, I can't believe I'm talking this far ahead,
8910000	8912000	but this is what happens, they'll still sell the 4's
8912000	8914000	as a quote-unquote budget console for a good
8914000	8916000	first two years of the 5's life.
8916000	8918000	Yeah, so it'll be nice when PlayStation
8918000	8920000	5 comes out and my fucking PlayStation
8920000	8922000	VR doesn't work with it.
8922000	8924000	Well, hold on, hold on.
8924000	8926000	We don't know anything about that yet.
8926000	8928000	Alright, last chance to get in you guys, Orange
8928000	8930000	Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype
8930000	8932000	if you want to call it. It had a nice run all one of
8932000	8934000	two years, one or two years, not
8934000	8936000	even this point. Will's
8936000	8938000	E3, E3's coming, you don't know
8938000	8940000	what they're gonna announce. We never got that Final Fantasy
8940000	8942000	XV experience yet on VR.
8942000	8944000	It feels like there's things coming. Still haven't finished
8944000	8946000	that game either. I need to do the
8946000	8948000	Radio DLC, I still haven't got around to it.
8948000	8950000	And I still haven't played the result either.
8950000	8952000	Time to get
8952000	8954000	caught up. Alright.
8954000	8956000	Anything other, any other last minute stories
8956000	8958000	you want to mention, Logie? That's it.
8958000	8960000	I have an announcement.
8960000	8962000	Yes? I want pie.
8962000	8964000	Oh, that's a great announcement, thank you Dark Slacker.
8964000	8966000	That's a great announcement. I think that I should have
8966000	8968000	pie. If pie is what you want,
8968000	8970000	pie is what you should get. You should get a pie shake.
8970000	8972000	There's a
8972000	8974000	cafe near my work that makes pie
8974000	8976000	shakes. Pie shakes. That's what they do, they
8976000	8978000	blend up a piece of pie, make it as a shake.
8978000	8980000	Does my pie shake bring all the boys
8980000	8982000	to the... No, they need to get out of my yard
8982000	8984000	unless they're gonna do the yard work.
8984000	8986000	Alright.
8986000	8988000	Well, it's being quiet on our phone lines, so I guess
8988000	8990000	that is going to be it. So we're gonna
8990000	8992000	shut it down on the Skype line.
8992000	8994000	If you want to send
8994000	8996000	us your thoughts after the show, participate
8996000	8998000	at orangelandrader.com or you can always
8998000	9000000	tweet us as well, twitter.com
9000000	9002000	slash o-l-r. But that is gonna wrap us
9002000	9004000	up for another night here at Orange Lounge Radio.
9004000	9006000	But we couldn't say good night
9006000	9008000	until I plug quickly
9008000	9010000	nice reviews on iTunes
9010000	9012000	just like I did earlier, so I'll make it quick.
9012000	9014000	A nice five star review goes a long way.
9014000	9016000	You know, if you liked what you heard here at OLR,
9016000	9018000	we don't take your money for doing the show.
9018000	9020000	Just help us spread the word. Word of mouth is a great thing.
9020000	9022000	We had some new people tuning in tonight
9022000	9024000	thanks to our interview. So thanks to Zircon
9024000	9026000	for being here, first and foremost.
9026000	9028000	And thanks to those of you guys that stopped and checked out
9028000	9030000	OLR, thanks to that. Or just because
9030000	9032000	maybe when you saw the tweets at OC
9032000	9034000	Remix or something, you were like, that show's still fucking
9034000	9036000	on and you checked us out.
9036000	9038000	Once
9038000	9040000	every other month or so, I get a tweet that's
9040000	9042000	like, you guys are still going.
9042000	9044000	Yeah, yeah, we're here. So anyway,
9044000	9046000	thank you, whether it's your first show or your
9046000	9048000	600th show, we appreciate it all the
9048000	9050000	same. Thanks for being here.
9050000	9052000	We gotta go around and get everybody's final
9052000	9054000	thought for the night. I'll
9054000	9056000	start and I'll just say
9056000	9058000	I am ready to be 100% done with
9058000	9060000	this sickness because although I do feel a lot better,
9060000	9062000	certainly better than I did last Sunday,
9062000	9064000	I would still say I'm only like 96%.
9064000	9066000	I want to be 100% over this
9066000	9068000	damn cold. Done.
9068000	9070000	And I don't like the pills I take because they make my head feel like
9070000	9072000	it's on fire.
9072000	9074000	I don't like feeling like I'm on fire.
9074000	9076000	DarkSocker, your final thought for the night.
9076000	9078000	I hate allergies. Hate,
9078000	9080000	hate, hate, hate.
9080000	9082000	With every fiber of
9082000	9084000	my being.
9084000	9086000	But, on the
9086000	9088000	plus side.
9088000	9090000	No, there's no plus side to it.
9090000	9092000	I hate it.
9092000	9094000	Alright, and last but not least,
9094000	9096000	Loki, your final thought. My final
9096000	9098000	thought is that
9098000	9100000	I was gonna 3D print something
9100000	9102000	larger, like
9102000	9104000	they have this switch holder thing that you can get.
9104000	9106000	You can plug in the two switch halves into it.
9106000	9108000	That's a little bit different. I was gonna print that for you,
9108000	9110000	but it didn't want to slice it today,
9110000	9112000	so I couldn't even
9112000	9114000	try to print it. Is that printer working well for you though?
9114000	9116000	It's working okay.
9116000	9118000	I've already broken
9118000	9120000	the hotbed on it because I tore
9120000	9122000	up a piece of the cover that was on there,
9122000	9124000	so I need to put something else on it right now.
9124000	9126000	I've taped over it, but
9126000	9128000	I was in the process of
9128000	9130000	putting a part cooling fan
9130000	9132000	on there, so I finally printed the shroud for it,
9132000	9134000	so I just have to wire that up and then
9134000	9136000	get the auto-leveling
9136000	9138000	working. I have to reflash
9138000	9140000	the firmware and stuff.
9140000	9142000	I just haven't gotten around to it
9142000	9144000	because I had been playing with that printer for about
9144000	9146000	four of the five days
9146000	9148000	during the week, and I was like, okay, I've got to take a break from it.
9148000	9150000	When are you going to 3D print me?
9150000	9152000	I want Rob Roberts action figures.
9152000	9154000	I'd have to get a 3D model of you to do that.
9154000	9156000	Alright. Awesome.
9156000	9158000	And then, I mean,
9158000	9160000	then we can do it. Mini me.
9160000	9162000	I think they have phone apps
9162000	9164000	that sort of do 3D models
9164000	9166000	with multiple stuff, so
9166000	9168000	we can try. Awesome.
9168000	9170000	We're gonna clone me on a 3D printer.
9170000	9172000	That'd be awesome.
9172000	9174000	Alright.
9174000	9176000	Anyway, that's gonna do it for another episode
9176000	9178000	of Orange Lounge Radio. Thank you guys so much for tuning in.
9178000	9180000	We will be back next week to do it
9180000	9182000	all over again. Until
9182000	9184000	then, have a great week and happy gaming. Bye.
