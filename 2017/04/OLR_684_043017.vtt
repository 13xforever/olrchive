Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:22.000
This week, Ravel with the girls of Night Trap. They're horror in suspense by revisiting Sega's most realistic, horrifying, and controversial titles of the FMB generation.

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
This is just one grip of tonight's show, and there's plenty more to come right now in the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.000 --> 00:45.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode number 684 for this April the 30th of 2017.

00:45.000 --> 00:50.000
And a big thank you to being back this week. Sorry guys, we missed last week unexpectedly.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
I hate canceling shows at the last minute the day of, but I got really sick.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
In fact, you might still hear it in my sinuses a little bit. Black being sick is awful.

00:58.000 --> 01:05.000
But my name is Rob Roberts, and I'm here joining you with my co-hosts here in Studio N7 in Sacramento, California.

01:05.000 --> 01:13.000
Over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle, say hello first off to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
Hi!

01:14.000 --> 01:19.000
Hi! Happy birthday, a little belated. Since we missed last week, we missed your birthday show.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
I'm old. Where's my presents?

01:20.000 --> 01:28.000
I feel bad for that. Your presents is being the gifted with our presents. No, Alan and I owe you a fancy schmancy dinner.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
Don't worry about it. I'm just being a bad.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
We want to. It'll be fine.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
Okay, fine.

01:32.000 --> 01:37.000
But how'd you celebrate No Show last week? Did you get to catch up on some games? Did you beat Andromeda yet?

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
Oh, I beat Andromeda before that.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
Congrats.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
I'm doing another playthrough right now. I'm trying 100%.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
Of course.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
Except I had to go back and catch up on the WoW content, because I went flying.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
Oh, yeah. They had a patch at some point recently.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
A big patch.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:52.000 --> 01:57.000
I mean, like, it's pretty big lore stuff if you've been a lore fiend.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
Sure.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
But I'll talk about that and how what was I playing.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
Sounds good.

02:01.000 --> 02:09.000
Um, but, uh, it, uh, I didn't really do much. I just stayed at home in my pajamas.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
That's all right. I needed to rest too. It happens sometimes.

02:11.000 --> 02:16.000
Well, my work schedule has split days off, so I don't really feel like I get any real rest.

02:17.000 --> 02:22.000
And so I needed the break today. I slept until two. It was great.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Rockstar.

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
But for my birthday, I decided I wanted a fairy garden.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
A fairy garden?

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
A fairy garden.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
Like Navi the fairy in Zelda?

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
No, it's-

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
Hey, listen.

02:33.000 --> 02:42.000
It's basically a thing where you just make like a little in a like kind of like a maybe a foot diameter pot.

02:42.000 --> 02:49.000
And you make just like a little fairy house with a yard and trees made of succulents and stupid shit like that.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
I've never heard. All right.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
And next thing you know, you have growing frog fractions three in the bottom.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
Well, hello, Techmaster Loki. How are you?

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
I'm fine.

02:57.000 --> 03:03.000
She's, I know all I heard was that she's growing pot, but there was something else about that about fairies and stuff, but that's, that's all right.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
How are you, Techmaster Loki?

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
I'm fine.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
Did you have a good week off unexpectedly last week?

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
Yeah, I went and saw The Fate of the Furious.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
Oh, how was that?

03:11.000 --> 03:17.000
It was just a totally random movie to pick because I haven't watched, I've literally only watched the first two Fast and the Furious movies.

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
And so like I'm totally out of the Fast and the Furious universe as far as it's concerned.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
It's actually pretty good. I was very surprised.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
I thought like, geez, by like was it the eighth movie now?

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
It can't be that good.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
It's pretty entertaining.

03:30.000 --> 03:39.000
I mean, let's just, it's not an intelligent movie, but it was good for what it would expected it to be a good popcorn movie.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
And I enjoyed it.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
I was very surprised.

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
I rarely get to the movies anymore, but I mentioned a few weeks ago, I saw Power Rangers.

03:45.000 --> 03:50.000
It was kind of random for me, but I mean, you know, considering a really good friend of mine was obsessed.

03:50.000 --> 03:54.000
I wanted to see Ghost in the Shell, but apparently I waited too long for that.

03:54.000 --> 03:58.000
So that's a lot of, they had like one showing at 10 o'clock at night that day.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
I was like, it flopped pretty bad.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
I know, but I still want to see it.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
Oh, hi, Alan. How are you?

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
Everybody's being horrible tonight at waiting for their introductions.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
Hi, Alan. How are you?

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
Hello.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
Hi, you're going to join us here for a little bit at the beginning.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
Yes.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
There's a reason I'll get to that in a minute.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
The Ghost in the Shell actually was like a big smash in Japan.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
Oh, was it?

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
Oh, yeah.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
Interesting.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
Well, look, we can talk about movies, but it is a show about video games.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
In fact, we have some new faces tonight and I'm sure that's thanks to our guest.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
Yes, Zircon is going to be joining us in about 20 minutes or so.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
It is a three hour show if you guys didn't know.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
So he'll be joining us for a little bit to talk a little bit about Tangledeep.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
And of course, we'll ask about some of his other projects.

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
And of course, you guys can ask your questions because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific time.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
Nine o'clock Eastern at the Voice of Geeks Network.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
vognetwork.com right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
So hello.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
I know we have some new faces in chat tonight.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
This is your first time at OLR.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
Hello.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
Welcome.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
Thanks for being here.

04:51.000 --> 04:59.000
Believe it or not, this show has been on the air since the year 2002 when we started as three friends all playing, get this, Dance Dance Revolution.

04:59.000 --> 05:06.000
And even though we got a little old and our body parts gave out, so we don't play as much DDR anymore, we still talk about video games because that was the thing you do.

05:06.000 --> 05:12.000
You go play DDR, then you go meet at the diner across the street, have some mozzarella sticks because that's the healthy thing to eat after you play DDR, right?

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
And then talk smack.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
But it's fine because back then we were burning enough calories where it didn't matter.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
I was never skinnier in my life than those years during DDR.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
Exactly.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
So I'll always be thankful for that and the fact that it gave us this show.

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
So yeah, this show might almost be as long as Zircon's music career.

05:26.000 --> 05:30.000
I've got to figure, I'm not sure what year he started with the Overclock Remix stuff.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
I got to ask about that.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
But I remember in the early days of OLR, you were a fan.

05:34.000 --> 05:42.000
You brought a lot of the Overclock Remix stuff to OLR, Loki, so when you heard he was coming on tonight, you were excited. I'm excited.

05:42.000 --> 05:50.000
Well, I had backed his last, I don't know if his last Kickstarter, but one of his Kickstars, I have a couple albums from his.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
I've bought a few of his albums, I don't know. I've listened to a lot of it.

05:53.000 --> 05:59.000
Well, let's go to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com where I see William Murderface saying,

05:59.000 --> 06:05.000
Does anyone play DDR that much anymore? I mean, I feel like it's going through a little bit of a renaissance right now.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
Like, there was a few years where it was like deader than a doornail.

06:08.000 --> 06:14.000
But then I think because of round one, Dave & Buster's, some of these other, well, I don't think it ever died in Japan.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
But over, maybe it dipped.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
But like, you know, I think it's kind of like has a renaissance now.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
Like I definitely see like more people are into it than it seemed were into it.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
Oh, I don't know, maybe five years ago or so.

06:24.000 --> 06:29.000
So anyway, I do want to shift gears here a little bit because Alan is joining us here at the top of the show.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
And what I was going to say for the whole DDR thing. Yes.

06:32.000 --> 06:39.000
Yeah. Well, for me, you know, the spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised.

06:39.000 --> 06:46.000
Wow. All right. Look, Alan is joining us here at the top of the show because you went on an interesting shopping adventure this week.

06:46.000 --> 06:51.000
And I want to I want to talk a little bit about this because it is about it's a shopping story, but it's about video games.

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
Right, Alan? Yes. OK, what happened? What did you do? You woke up early Monday morning.

06:55.000 --> 07:07.000
So the previous weekend and maybe the week leading up to it, a cheap ass gamer and a bunch of other sites like Polygon and Kotaku ran a story that said the Best Buy was getting.

07:07.000 --> 07:16.000
Factually, they were getting some Nintendo classic consoles on Monday, which would have been the 22nd.

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
I have no concept of time, whatever Monday was.

07:20.000 --> 07:28.000
So, of course, as we all know, the whole lifespan of this product has been sort of a shit show. Supply issues.

07:28.000 --> 07:35.000
It's been hacked. There's no interface on it for them to update the firmware on it. There's no storefront on it, which was mistake number one.

07:35.000 --> 07:40.000
And I guess the manufacturing costs have gone up. So Nintendo is just like washing their hands of it.

07:40.000 --> 07:45.000
So it's become a collector's item because it's only been around for like, what, November? Four months.

07:46.000 --> 07:53.000
So I was like, all right, I will go to Best Buy early in the morning to see if I can get one of these suckers.

07:53.000 --> 08:01.000
So I get there. For those that don't know, Alan is my husband. So Alan was like, even though in the beginning I was like, I don't want one.

08:01.000 --> 08:06.000
I don't need one. These are ridiculous. The minute now it's like, oh, well, if you don't get one now, you're never getting one.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
Then I was like, maybe I should get one.

08:09.000 --> 08:17.000
There's a dozen better ways to play NES ROMs than a Nintendo classic that don't involve the short ass cable and this, that, and the other.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
So it was more about the game of getting one.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
Now it's a thing. Now it's a thing. Yes.

08:23.000 --> 08:29.000
It's like the parents on some Mad Max shit in the parking lot at Toys R Us trying to get a Tickle Me Elmo.

08:29.000 --> 08:33.000
Their kid doesn't even like Elmo. They just want to be able to say that they're the parent that got one.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
They're the mom of the year.

08:34.000 --> 08:40.000
They're like, I got tooth marks on my elbow from where I clocked some bitch, but I got my Tickle Me Elmo.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
Did you clock a bitch, Alan?

08:41.000 --> 08:47.000
No, I did not. So I show up. I get up kind of, I wanted to get there at 8am. I was not about to camp overnight.

08:47.000 --> 08:57.000
This isn't a console launch. So I get there at around 830. You were sick. So I was trying to surprise you with a...

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
That's true. I missed last week's show and I was still sick on Monday morning. I had to call out of work.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
So I was like, this will make you feel better.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
Yes.

09:03.000 --> 09:11.000
So I got up early for me because I work evenings and nights. Get there around 830. I'm roughly the 30th person in line.

09:11.000 --> 09:17.000
Like 30 or 31. And I see as I'm pulling up that there's obviously a line of people, 30 people.

09:17.000 --> 09:24.000
And I was like, I guess I'll hang out and see how many they get because I thought they were going to get like three.

09:24.000 --> 09:33.000
So I get there at 830. People are kind of, it's not that cold. People are talking in line at around...

09:33.000 --> 09:38.000
Was everybody in line talking about reminiscing about Nintendo and their fondness for classic NES systems?

09:38.000 --> 09:43.000
Some of them and some of them were sharing consoles like, oh, I blasted this for the PS3.

09:43.000 --> 09:50.000
Okay. See, I thought that, okay, I got that because I thought the honest joke was going to be, I don't know, I'm here to buy one, sell it on eBay. What's a Nintendo?

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Well, I'm getting to that.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
Oh, sorry. Excuse me. I'll just have a seat over here.

09:55.000 --> 10:04.000
No. So the people that were in the part of the line that I was in was social and everyone was buried into their phones. It was kind of cold, whatever.

10:04.000 --> 10:17.000
So this one guy pulls up a customer is like, I just came from the Natomas one because the management, the Natomas Best Buy because the manager did the call, the vouchers earlier and they got seven.

10:17.000 --> 10:32.000
So already I'm the 31st person in line and I'm hearing Natomas, this is like at 915, got seven. Best Buy opens at 10. So the guy drove from Natomas to here to see if we would get more because it's the Arden Best Buy is like the Best Buy in Sacramento.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
Right.

10:33.000 --> 10:37.000
I mean, Sacramento is kind of lame, but we're sort of a metropolitan area.

10:37.000 --> 10:43.000
We're the capital of the biggest state. We have a basketball team. They're terrible, but we have a team.

10:43.000 --> 10:53.000
So finally it's like quarter to 10. And finally the manager comes out with a little helper and a security guard. He's like, all right, I've got these vouchers here.

10:53.000 --> 10:59.000
They are going to be first come first serve. I'm going to start here by the door, front of the line. We have 24.

10:59.000 --> 11:09.000
24 Nest Classics. So being person number 31, I'm already shit out of luck. Okay, so that's really where the story should end.

11:09.000 --> 11:25.000
But as soon as the manager handed out those 24 slips, the first five people in line who clearly had camped out, like they had lawn chairs and stuff, so they were in it to win it, immediately started to hustle their vouchers.

11:25.000 --> 11:29.000
As soon as the manager was out of earshot and was trying to flip the voucher.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
On the Best Buy premises.

11:30.000 --> 11:35.000
On the Best Buy premises, right in front of the store. And I was like, what happened to the good old date?

11:35.000 --> 11:44.000
Well, like if they just bought their shit and then tried to flip it on Craigslist or on eBay, that's their business because they bought the product.

11:44.000 --> 11:49.000
But I had a problem with the fact that one, they were doing it right as soon as the manager had left.

11:49.000 --> 11:57.000
And it's like, you still have to buy the thing. And they're trying to sell this paper. I couldn't tell if this guy was joking, but one guy was like, for the low, low price of $300.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
And it's like, this thing costs 80 bucks.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
Like go to 60.

12:01.000 --> 12:08.000
60. So they were basically going up and down like, don't leave. I got here if you want to buy it.

12:08.000 --> 12:13.000
So I'm like, all right. So the first five consoles are basically like a wash.

12:14.000 --> 12:19.000
And again, in a weird way, it's like, do I respect the hustle of them?

12:19.000 --> 12:24.000
Because I mean, Nintendo created this fucking problem and they're just trying to make a buck off of it.

12:24.000 --> 12:30.000
I mean, Best Buy, of course, I'll get to this in a minute, does have some responsibility.

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
But it was just, it was lame. And I did see one dude finally.

12:35.000 --> 12:43.000
So let me, I'm skipping ahead. So when people in line were like, nah, dude, like we missed, like, we're not, we're not buying the voucher from you.

12:43.000 --> 12:52.000
They then started to approach people coming up for like five minutes to the store saying, hey, are you here for the next Nest Classic? Because who shows up at $9.59?

12:52.000 --> 12:57.000
So they were going to respect the line for their hustle as they were moving down the line.

12:58.000 --> 13:03.000
But as customers who had not waited in line were like, are you here for the Nest Classic? Yeah.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
Well, here's this piece of paper and you already missed your chances.

13:05.000 --> 13:12.000
So they were basically trying to do their sales pitch to people that had not waited in line and had no idea what was going on,

13:12.000 --> 13:16.000
which is kind of weird to have to like run through this gauntlet of dudes just to get into the store.

13:16.000 --> 13:22.000
I mean, to get there right when they opened, maybe they didn't want a Nest Classic, but these people said they did.

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
And they immediately got their sales pitch. So, lame.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
Finally, you saw them sell one.

13:27.000 --> 13:33.000
Yes, I did see one dude hand a bunch of 20s to a guy. I don't know if it was 80 bucks or 160. I don't know.

13:33.000 --> 13:38.000
I just saw, I saw wallet open and a piece of paper exchange hands. So I'm like, okay, well, there's a sucker right there.

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
Let me move things forward here a little bit because we do have an interview coming up tonight.

13:41.000 --> 13:47.000
But do we, did, did anybody complain to Best Buy about the fact that these guys are hustling on the premises?

13:47.000 --> 13:54.000
So, I went, I went to the car, updated you, updated Twitter, was like, but by this point,

13:54.000 --> 14:01.000
everyone from person number 25 onwards had pretty much left because it was the 24 people that got the vouchers.

14:01.000 --> 14:08.000
And I was like, you know what? I wonder if these people trying to sell their shit, maybe they'll wash out.

14:08.000 --> 14:13.000
Maybe they won't find anyone. Maybe they'll leave. Maybe their credit, maybe someone's credit card will get declined.

14:14.000 --> 14:20.000
So I'm going to stick it out and just wait for the damn doors to open, which at this point was only like 15 more minutes, 10 more minutes.

14:20.000 --> 14:28.000
I'm going to get in line and see what happens. So doors open, we all rush in and there's this mom who got there like five minutes to 10.

14:28.000 --> 14:32.000
And I sort of, she was like, are you thinking about buying one of the papers? I'm like, I don't have cash on me.

14:32.000 --> 14:39.000
And even if I did, I'm not, I'm not supporting their BS. So we are all in line.

14:39.000 --> 14:49.000
I'm sort of waiting to hear if someone is going to flake out. And the manager comes up and says, these vouchers are good until one in the afternoon.

14:49.000 --> 14:56.000
So if you leave the property, the owner of that piece of paper can buy the product through 1 p.m.

14:56.000 --> 15:03.000
If 1 p.m. comes and goes and all of those 24 vouchers are not accounted for, then they will do first come first serve to the people there.

15:03.000 --> 15:10.000
And I was like, well, so now those, because three or four of those five guys that were trying to do the hustle had left.

15:10.000 --> 15:15.000
Why until one o'clock? What is, what is the pro consumer reason?

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
It's three hours. I don't know.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
That you would let people wait until one o'clock.

15:19.000 --> 15:25.000
Why would you wait there to get a voucher that you're really, this is the vouchers that go buy something and then come back?

15:25.000 --> 15:28.000
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm not ready to buy this yet. Then why are you in fucking line?

15:28.000 --> 15:34.000
I mean, okay. I understand maybe if you have to run and use the ATM or something like you got there.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
Okay. We'll give you until 11 then.

15:36.000 --> 15:40.000
Exactly. Give them an hour or say, you know, fine. Now that you're here.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
They have an ATM in the goddamn store.

15:42.000 --> 15:47.000
Everybody uses cards these days anyway, but fine. If somebody has a big need like that, then fine.

15:47.000 --> 15:54.000
If you come back in 30 minutes, we'll hold this for you while you work out your banking issues.

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
You know, fine. But that just encourages people to turn around and resell it.

15:57.000 --> 16:01.000
And that's the part of your story that really like irks me the most.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
Why does Best Buy have that?

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
The mom that I sort of made friends with was like, okay, so you're the manager.

16:06.000 --> 16:14.000
So I want to know what you're going to do about the people that are scalping the vouchers on your property.

16:14.000 --> 16:18.000
And the guy was like, people were reselling them? Yes, you would have seen that if you stuck around.

16:18.000 --> 16:23.000
Well, I mean, our protocol is for any release like this is we hand out the vouchers.

16:23.000 --> 16:29.000
What people do with those vouchers is their business. If they're scalping them, that's unfortunate.

16:29.000 --> 16:37.000
But that is not okay. And it's like, all right, if they had one or two security guards at the front door that were like, okay, whatever you're doing, you're not doing it here.

16:37.000 --> 16:43.000
Go to Toys R Us. Go to Burger King. Go to the way you're putting it.

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
That says to me Best Buy supports the scalping culture, period. Yeah.

16:46.000 --> 16:49.000
And part of this problem is being created is because of Best Buy.

16:49.000 --> 16:57.000
It's like out of sight, out of mind. If you want to do your shady shit at the other end of the parking lot where it's not Best Buy property, then whatever.

16:57.000 --> 17:03.000
But they just weren't there. They didn't care. So finally, we're like, so they left.

17:03.000 --> 17:07.000
You're saying it that it was unfortunate, but you have no control over scalping.

17:07.000 --> 17:11.000
What about the people that left? What's going to happen?

17:11.000 --> 17:15.000
He's like, well, if you're here waiting to see if someone's going to wash out on their sale, those vouchers are good until 1 p.m.

17:15.000 --> 17:19.000
So if you're here just to see if people can't get one, you have to come back at once.

17:19.000 --> 17:23.000
So at that point, I was like, okay, so now I'm just wasting my time. So then I left for real.

17:23.000 --> 17:29.000
So let me read some comments in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

17:29.000 --> 17:33.000
William Murderface says, what, do they need to find a Bitcoin ATM or some shit?

17:33.000 --> 17:37.000
S2100 Matt says, what a shit show. Sounds like they made this up as they went along.

17:37.000 --> 17:43.000
Dungeon Buster says, I feel less guilty visiting one and then ordering what I want from Amazon.

17:43.000 --> 17:49.000
Let's see. Dungeon Buster says, you can make a few Raspberry Pi versions for 300. Just saying.

17:49.000 --> 17:53.000
Yeah, but you know, sometimes it's just about the game of getting one.

17:53.000 --> 17:59.000
And being person 31 out of 24, I already knew that that game was over for me.

17:59.000 --> 18:06.000
But it was watching the resulting shit show of how Best Buy didn't care about the scalpers and then also gave them a three hour window to do their hustle.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
And that's part of the reason why I wanted Alan to tell this story.

18:08.000 --> 18:13.000
Because we're hearing a lot of speak from Nintendo this week about the whole, oh, there's limited resources.

18:13.000 --> 18:19.000
What's the line they've been given this week on why they've sold two million of them, but they're not doing any more because what?

18:19.000 --> 18:25.000
We're only one company. We're only one company. We don't have unlimited resources. Resources are limited.

18:25.000 --> 18:30.000
This is only supposed to be a holiday thing. Blah, blah. Jamie's making a motion with her hands.

18:30.000 --> 18:35.000
Like, yeah, this is just like it's a lot of speak and it sucks to hear things like this.

18:35.000 --> 18:41.000
And look, at the end of the day, oh, well, we didn't get one. It's not about that.

18:41.000 --> 18:46.000
I don't care that we didn't get one and all that. If I really wanted one bad enough, I should have started fighting for one in the beginning.

18:46.000 --> 18:55.000
I accept that. But what sucks about this whole thing, what I think really needs to be examined is why is Best Buy's policies basically allowing scalping to happen?

18:55.000 --> 19:01.000
And why are these? I mean, I can also understand that, you know, retailers don't give a fuck or whatever.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
They still get the money at the end of the day, blah, blah, blah.

19:04.000 --> 19:12.000
But I still think, you know, especially as one of our chatters put it, in this day and age where it's so easy where you can just turn your back on the retailer then and go to Amazon.

19:12.000 --> 19:19.000
Don't you want a retailer that's going to fight for the consumer a little bit, so to speak? Like, I don't know. Doesn't that little bit of faith go a long way?

19:19.000 --> 19:27.000
They just had to have the security guard who was taller than me, and I'm 6'4", hang out front and be like, what are you guys doing? Don't do that here.

19:27.000 --> 19:38.000
And just kind of make it a little harder to scalp. And just the fact, again, if they had bought their shit and then flipped it in the parking lot on Craigslist, on eBay, whatever, they bought the product.

19:38.000 --> 19:50.000
If they want to resell it to some sucker for 400 bucks, fine. But the fact that it was for a piece of paper where you still have to buy the actual product after you paid them for their extortion BS.

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
Let me read a few more comments here. Brad from Pod Culture says,

19:54.000 --> 20:00.000
Flipping one is one thing. The fuckers that show like 10 in a damn eBay auction pic are the real bastards.

20:00.000 --> 20:06.000
Come on, Cupid Boy says, At the end of the day, Alan is still a great guy for trying to do something nice for his man. I agree.

20:06.000 --> 20:16.000
If I had gotten up at like, if I was there by 7am or 730, but again, I shouldn't have to go to a place at 7am for a retro console.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
Those five guys should have been an issue.

20:18.000 --> 20:27.000
Bobby Blackwolf says, My Best Buy screwed me out of a pro controller because they wouldn't let me jump out of the pre-order line to get it and let someone who didn't pre-order behind me in line go to the register first.

20:27.000 --> 20:31.000
So they have some issues with their launch process. They also did vouchers for Switch.

20:31.000 --> 20:37.000
Picratos, hope I'm saying that right, in our chatroom says, Nintendo is trolling at this point.

20:37.000 --> 20:41.000
Well, okay, quickly, because again, we've got Zircon coming.

20:41.000 --> 20:48.000
Here's the quote. So the quote is, Even with the extraordinary level of performance, we understand that people are frustrated about not being able to find the system.

20:48.000 --> 20:56.000
And for that, we really do apologize. But from our perspective, it's important to recognize where our future is and the key areas that we need to drive.

20:56.000 --> 21:04.000
We've got a lot going on right now. We don't have unlimited resources. That is some, that is a fucking line of bullshit right there.

21:05.000 --> 21:13.000
Let me quickly ask this, because there's been a lot of increased rabble rabble on the internet this week about the Super NES Mini.

21:13.000 --> 21:19.000
You know, first, that was the fanfic. Oh, the logical follow up to the NES Mini is the Super NES Mini. That's what Nintendo is really going to do.

21:19.000 --> 21:25.000
And I don't, like Eurogamer has a tip or something, and they've been, you know, they're just spot on with Nintendo stuff.

21:26.000 --> 21:34.000
But essentially, there's a lot more rabble rabble, where there's smoke, there's fire, et cetera, about Super Nintendo Mini is a thing happening this holiday.

21:34.000 --> 21:41.000
And there's a part of me that's like, fuck them, I don't care. You know what? Here's what I think about your fucking NES Mini.

21:41.000 --> 21:46.000
I bought a fucking Raspberry Pi yesterday, so fuck you and your stupid Mini.

21:46.000 --> 21:50.000
You know what? Virtual console on Switch would be fine too, but...

21:50.000 --> 21:56.000
We told a friend to hold one for us, and we got one from our friend. At GameStop.

21:56.000 --> 22:03.000
See, here's the thing though. Yes, but you have to, even that's a little, I don't want to say it's shady, but it's, you have to know somebody.

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
If you have a hookup, then that's, that applies to everything.

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
And we wanted it for ourselves, not to sell.

22:09.000 --> 22:16.000
It shouldn't be like fucking alcohol in the 1920s. Like, you have to know the secret password to say at the front where they let you in the brothel in the back.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
There's no one poisoning the machines.

22:18.000 --> 22:23.000
Like, it shouldn't be like that. I just, I don't understand.

22:23.000 --> 22:29.000
I mean, I'm sure we got at least one amiibo back when they were sort of fresh, ma'am, and relatively rare. They didn't have the third reprinting.

22:29.000 --> 22:35.000
We got some of the more coveted amiibos through a hookup. I mean, that's just how that works if you know someone.

22:35.000 --> 22:41.000
And please, don't give me this bullshit that, oh, I'm sorry, we're just, we don't have unlimited resources.

22:41.000 --> 22:49.000
Then how is it that other companies that manufacture, probably in the same countries as you, do not have these supply problems?

22:49.000 --> 22:53.000
Why is it that you're the only fucking company that consistently has supply problems?

22:53.000 --> 22:58.000
It's not because you don't have unlimited resources. It's because you're fucking incompetent.

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
I was, I'm going to try to wrap up on this, and then I want to move on.

23:01.000 --> 23:07.000
But I, one thing I would like to see Nintendo do, I'm going to try to keep this constructive and happy and da da da da da.

23:08.000 --> 23:15.000
I would like to, in light of this story that we're hearing about how easy it is for scalpers to take advantage of what these retail channels are doing,

23:15.000 --> 23:20.000
I would like Nintendo, if they are going to do a Super Nintendo Mini, which is going to be, now that I really want,

23:20.000 --> 23:25.000
because the Super Nintendo is like my favorite system, as I think many of you probably feel the same way.

23:25.000 --> 23:31.000
I want to know, what is Nintendo going to do to hold retailers accountable for this scalping market?

23:31.000 --> 23:38.000
Look, I understand you can't prevent scalping 100%. Like, that's just, capitalism is-

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
People are always going to try and get one over.

23:40.000 --> 23:43.000
Exactly. But what steps are you going to take to make it a lot fucking harder?

23:43.000 --> 23:49.000
Because what Alan is talking about was too easy. That's, that's the long and the short of it.

23:49.000 --> 23:54.000
Anyway, let's see, go into chat for a few more comments here over at live.vognetwork.com.

23:54.000 --> 24:01.000
SC Mike says, all these limited resources do is just support pirating the ROMs and emulators, honestly.

24:01.000 --> 24:05.000
Yeah, we still don't have Virtual Console, which I would have thought could have been like their-

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
They could have gone, oh, well, you know, we don't have any more NES Classic Minis.

24:08.000 --> 24:12.000
But guess what? We're going to release on the Switch for $29.99.

24:12.000 --> 24:18.000
We're going to have a NES Classic bundle that will turn your Switch into an NES Classic.

24:18.000 --> 24:22.000
And we're going to release a controller that will work with the Switch wirelessly.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
Would that have been the most difficult thing in the world to do?

24:24.000 --> 24:33.000
But it's okay, you know, when they launch their online service, they'll have your free monthly rental of a game that, you know, Game ROM that you get for free or something like that.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
And you'll love it.

24:34.000 --> 24:38.000
Okay, we're going to shift gears here because we are very excited here at Orange Lawn Radio to welcome-

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
By the way, Alan, thank you very much for sitting in.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
Bye, show.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
I know you guys-

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
Went back to the office.

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
Got other stuff to do like work.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
Thank you for trying. I really appreciate it.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
Okay.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
You're welcome.

24:47.000 --> 24:51.000
As I was saying, we're very, very honored tonight to have a special guest joining us on the show.

24:51.000 --> 24:56.000
Has had a very, very long musical career through organizations like Overclocked Remix.

24:56.000 --> 25:05.000
And now is moving on into game development with developing and planning on releasing Tangle Deep a little later this year.

25:05.000 --> 25:09.000
We're going to get Zircon on the line and he'll be joining us here.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
And I believe we have him on the line.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
Hey, Zircon, you there?

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
I am.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
Hey, welcome to Orange Lawn Radio.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
Hey, thank you for having me.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
Hey, no problem.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
Well, I should start.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
First off, I have to say thank you very much.

25:20.000 --> 25:25.000
You guys may not know this, but behind the scenes, Zircon was actually scheduled to be here last week.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
And we had to reschedule because I got sick.

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
So I really want to thank you up front for your flexibility.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
So-

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
Oh, no problem at all, man.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
Good guy.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
Good guy, Zircon.

25:34.000 --> 25:38.000
How long have you been doing Video Gate?

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
We were talking about this at the opening of the show.

25:39.000 --> 25:42.000
You may not know this, but OLR has been around since 2002.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
We've been doing this show in different forms.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
And I was like, Zircon may still have beat us.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
How long have you been working in video games?

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
No, you beat me.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
You definitely beat me there.

25:51.000 --> 26:00.000
I started my first foray into remixing game music in 2003.

26:00.000 --> 26:03.000
Now, of course, that was as a rank amateur.

26:03.000 --> 26:06.000
So no professional stuff.

26:06.000 --> 26:14.000
I think my first paid thing was 2004, and I got paid $15 for writing a song.

26:14.000 --> 26:17.000
What was the game it was for?

26:17.000 --> 26:25.000
Captain Genia on Shell Island, which you can actually find Let's Plays of that on YouTube with like 50 views, but nonetheless.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
Hey, that's awesome.

26:27.000 --> 26:32.000
If you guys have questions for Zircon, you can always check out our chat room over at live.vognetware.com.

26:32.000 --> 26:36.000
We will be asking some of those questions that you guys ask in our chat room too as Zirconists are going through this.

26:36.000 --> 26:42.000
So I want to congratulate you. Your Kickstarter, Tangledeep, smashed the goal that you had set.

26:42.000 --> 26:48.000
How does it feel to now have the Kickstarter in your rearview mirror at this point?

26:48.000 --> 26:51.000
Man, it's blowing my mind.

26:51.000 --> 26:59.000
It feels amazing that so many people are excited for the game and are as passionate for it as I am.

26:59.000 --> 27:08.000
It's just even more motivation to see people play the game and the backers being excited about it and sending me their ideas is just incredible.

27:08.000 --> 27:13.000
And I should say, disclosure, I backed it, so just throwing that out there.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
Thank you for that.

27:15.000 --> 27:18.000
No worries, but I just don't want people going, oh ethics.

27:18.000 --> 27:28.000
So anyway, for those that may not have heard of Tangledeep, why don't you give us the little elevator pitch. What is it?

27:28.000 --> 27:40.000
Alright, I condensed this very short. Imagine if Squaresoft made a Final Fantasy themed dungeon crawler for the Super Nintendo and that is Tangledeep.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
I like it.

27:42.000 --> 27:51.000
That's the very short version. It's a PC and Mac game. I'm still working on it. It's in development now so it's not out.

27:51.000 --> 27:58.000
But yeah, it's a dungeon crawler very much inspired by a lot of my favorite games from the Super Nintendo like Secret of Mana.

27:58.000 --> 28:04.000
And art style wise, you definitely see shades of Chrono Trigger in there and games like that.

28:04.000 --> 28:08.000
But it's mixed with that sort of roguelike turn-based gameplay.

28:08.000 --> 28:17.000
So if you play stuff like Dungeons of Dreadmoor or Crypt of the Necrodancer minus the rhythmic part, you start to get a pretty good idea of what Tangledeep is like.

28:17.000 --> 28:29.000
I'm actually really glad you brought up Crypt of the Necrodancer yourself because I wasn't sure if it would have been like, is this going to be offensive if I say when I watched the trailer I totally got a Crypt of the Necrodancer vibe off of it but like a different style of game?

28:29.000 --> 28:42.000
No, that game is incredible and I actually had the opportunity. I worked on it a little bit on the music side of things. I mixed the metal version of the soundtrack.

28:42.000 --> 28:49.000
So I had a little bit of a hand in it and so I'm a little biased but it really is an incredible game.

28:49.000 --> 28:59.000
Now what I thought was interesting about your Kickstarter and what I see as a trend a little bit in 2017, at least I say that because we just had some guys here on our last episode two weeks ago.

28:59.000 --> 29:09.000
They made a game called Little Tanks and they did a very similar Kickstarter where they had already kind of done their game and this was what you were doing is that you were doing this game no matter what.

29:09.000 --> 29:19.000
Like you've already poured yourself into this game. You're going to make this game happen but you were going to Kickstarter to ask for money to basically put a layer of polish on it. Would that be the way to describe it?

29:19.000 --> 29:20.000
Yeah, definitely.

29:20.000 --> 29:30.000
So and not only did you make what you asked for but you made twice as much which is allowing you, you're going to have these guest contributors now like several guest musicians, right?

29:30.000 --> 29:37.000
And some more fluid art, right? What do we have to look forward to for all this money that's been raised on Kickstarter?

29:38.000 --> 29:53.000
So one of the main things that I wanted to do going in was, of course even though I write music myself, I was saying, gee, wouldn't it be awesome if I could actually get as guest composers people that I grew up listening to when I was playing games.

29:53.000 --> 30:02.000
So one of the composers was Hiroki Kikuda who is Secret of Mana and Seiken Densetsu 3 are the notable ones from that Super Nintendo period.

30:02.000 --> 30:15.000
So he's going to be on board. And then as the Kickstarter was going on and we hit the goal and I was like, oh, I need some stretch goals now because I didn't think it was going to exceed the goal and certainly not that quickly.

30:15.000 --> 30:25.000
So Grant Kirkhope who composed many of the rare soundtracks like GoldenEye and Donkey Kong 64 and he's been active ever since.

30:26.000 --> 30:34.000
But those two are going to be contributing as composers and there's some other people that I can't announce it yet but that are going to be coming on board.

30:34.000 --> 30:47.000
But on the art side, the animations, like you said, put another layer of just fluidity like running animations for all the characters because it's a surprising amount of work when you're doing all this hand-drawn sprite stuff.

30:47.000 --> 30:58.000
And the big difference between an 8-bit style game like NES and a 16-bit one, there's just way more colors, there's more sprite resolution.

30:58.000 --> 31:06.000
So like the one area of the game, for example, might be 1600 by 900 pixels or something like that which doesn't sound like a lot.

31:06.000 --> 31:16.000
That's like one screen, right? On an average size monitor. But then when you think every single one of those pixels is being drawn by hand, it's a huge amount of work.

31:16.000 --> 31:20.000
So that's what that money is going to do. It's more polished for the game, like you said.

31:20.000 --> 31:24.000
Awesome. Well, congratulations again. Obviously, there's a lot of enthusiasm for it.

31:24.000 --> 31:33.000
And if people want to check out the game, you just released your last public build today, right? So people can actually check this out in progress, right?

31:33.000 --> 31:39.000
Yeah, absolutely. So the game that all the backers are playing right now, it's the same one that anybody can play even if you didn't back it.

31:40.000 --> 31:46.000
If you go to tangledeep.com, there are links on there. And actually, the Kickstarter updates have generally been public.

31:46.000 --> 31:50.000
So you can also grab it from the Kickstarter page if you just search for Tangledeep.

31:50.000 --> 31:58.000
But yeah, going forward from here, I feel like we've now hit a little over 50% what I consider to be complete on the game.

31:58.000 --> 32:06.000
So a lot of the gameplay is there. A lot of the art is there. But at this point on, I feel like it's now starting to get to the point where

32:06.000 --> 32:14.000
I want to think about getting it on Steam Early Access so that people that do want to keep following it, but maybe they missed the Kickstarter,

32:14.000 --> 32:20.000
but they kind of wanted to wait and see. So that was the big thing with the Kickstarter in general.

32:20.000 --> 32:31.000
The reason why I wanted to go on there when I already had a year of work was I think a lot of people, rightfully, feel like they've been burned on Kickstarter projects before.

32:31.000 --> 32:37.000
I'm sure a lot of people have backed things that maybe didn't turn out the way they wanted.

32:37.000 --> 32:45.000
I definitely don't want to name any specific names, but there have been even high-profile projects that have just not panned out the way people wanted.

32:45.000 --> 32:53.000
So I figured I want to really show good faith, and not only here's the playable thing, but I'm going to keep updating it even after the Kickstarter ends

32:53.000 --> 32:59.000
so people really get a sense of what this game is about and what it's like to play.

32:59.000 --> 33:07.000
Even watching your pitch video, it seemed very clear to me that you knew a lot of what makes people nervous about Kickstarters,

33:07.000 --> 33:14.000
and you kind of let your resume be out there and all that. I personally think you kind of hit all the right points where Kickstarter should be in 2017

33:14.000 --> 33:19.000
as to why I should give you my money, and I think that speaks to probably why you did so well.

33:19.000 --> 33:29.000
Oh, thank you. I definitely want to deliver on everything. I feel like the best way to show, you could have a million credits,

33:29.000 --> 33:36.000
but if you just come up with either nothing at all, which has happened before on Kickstarter, stuff just doesn't come out,

33:36.000 --> 33:43.000
or if you come up with something bad that hurts everybody's faith in the whole platform. So have something to show. I think that's just super important.

33:44.000 --> 33:50.000
Let me take a big step back here and ask you a little bit about, you're very well known for the music that you've done,

33:50.000 --> 33:54.000
and you haven't just done OC Remix, even though we've talked a lot about that.

33:54.000 --> 33:58.000
Obviously that was a big part of your beginnings, but you went on to actually make music.

33:58.000 --> 34:03.000
I know you've done some work with Video Games Live and some of the Kickstarters they've done.

34:03.000 --> 34:07.000
I know Soulcalibur V, you've worked with that, and you've worked with some big games.

34:07.000 --> 34:16.000
Why now, from making music to making the game, what made you decide, I want to go for something even bigger when it comes to the game?

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
I want to do the game.

34:18.000 --> 34:28.000
Man, I've always wanted to do this. What it boils down to, I've always been sort of a tech-minded guy, I guess.

34:28.000 --> 34:38.000
Like a lot of gamers, honestly. I got a Game Boy and I loved it, I got a Super Nintendo and I love that.

34:38.000 --> 34:45.000
And for as long as I can remember, I was always interested in what it would be like to create my own game.

34:45.000 --> 34:50.000
And I never had the tools or the know-how to do it. I didn't apply myself to that, I guess.

34:50.000 --> 34:55.000
It was more fun for me to just write it down on paper, that kind of thing.

34:55.000 --> 35:02.000
And I dabbled in some kind of simple script-based stuff, so back in the day we had IRC, if anybody remembers that.

35:02.000 --> 35:07.000
Our chat room is actually still powered by IRC, basically.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
Oh, excellent.

35:09.000 --> 35:12.000
Some things haven't changed since 2002.

35:12.000 --> 35:18.000
Yeah, OC Remix Discord only, I think that was 2016.

35:18.000 --> 35:25.000
Yeah, everybody's telling us to change to Slack or Discord at this point, and I'm like, but I like the old one, it's not broken.

35:25.000 --> 35:34.000
Yeah, that was our point of view, exactly. But ever since those days, I always wanted to create something.

35:34.000 --> 35:43.000
And I have my parents, I think one of the things that sort of pushed me was that my parents recently, last year, sold the house that I grew up in.

35:43.000 --> 35:52.000
They gave me a lot of my stuff that it kind of accumulated, that it held onto, and I just had hundreds and hundreds of papers of all these game ideas and everything.

35:52.000 --> 36:01.000
And I just thought, you know what, I'm almost 30, I'm 29 right now, I want to just take these steps, I want to do this thing that I've always wanted to do.

36:01.000 --> 36:13.000
And just looking back, I could physically see, age seven, I'm actually looking in the corner of my eye, I have a book, it's titled Thinking Up and Drawing Monsters by Andrea Versa.

36:13.000 --> 36:21.000
So it's this little school project I did, I guess, but I've always wanted to do this, so I threw myself into it.

36:21.000 --> 36:27.000
I'm hung up on something for a minute. You're only 29, and you started this a year after we started doing OLR.

36:27.000 --> 36:31.000
You were 16 when you had your first paid gig for music.

36:31.000 --> 36:43.000
Yeah, technically yes, and I remember my mom said I couldn't sign the contract, so she signed it for me. It was $15 per track for four tracks.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.000
Oh my gosh.

36:44.000 --> 36:48.000
Yeah, I'm getting that $60, I can buy three quarters of Chrono Trigger.

36:49.000 --> 36:59.000
No, that's amazing though, that's awesome. I was doing public access TV around that same age, and it led to this, so I still don't get a dime for this, but that's alright.

36:59.000 --> 37:13.000
I want to ask a little bit about how you got empowered a little bit more as a programmer, because I notice on your website you give tips for people that are interested in getting into music, and I love that.

37:13.000 --> 37:22.000
One thing that I really love that has come up on this show a lot in the past year is that if you want to make a game, there's so many tools out there for people to go and do that.

37:22.000 --> 37:26.000
Just a month ago we were talking about the indie arcade event here.

37:26.000 --> 37:29.000
I tried to do it before you have a family, because they really put a damper on everything.

37:29.000 --> 37:34.000
There's a running gag where Loki has an unfinished game here if you want to wear it.

37:34.000 --> 37:42.000
Anyway, so you really put together a guide about, hey, if you want to get into doing music, here's some ideas, here's some software, and all that good stuff.

37:42.000 --> 37:48.000
But what did you do, what helped you cross over into programming?

37:49.000 --> 37:58.000
So what I'll say is that, first of all, I'll feel 100% more confident about answering anything like this once it's done.

37:58.000 --> 38:06.000
Even though I have a playable thing, I know I've done some things, but I'll try to answer it anyway.

38:07.000 --> 38:17.000
One of the big things, and this is maybe just my personality, but I read a lot about getting into game development.

38:17.000 --> 38:21.000
And a lot of people were like, alright, well you've got to start out and you've got to make a simple game.

38:21.000 --> 38:25.000
Make Pong, make Space Invaders, make Pac-Man or something like that.

38:25.000 --> 38:31.000
And I kept reading it and I just thought to myself, man, I don't want to do that. I just want to make the game that I want to make.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
I don't want to skip everything.

38:33.000 --> 38:36.000
Sorry, go ahead.

38:36.000 --> 38:45.000
No, it's just like the thought of having to kind of build up into it was just not appealing to me.

38:45.000 --> 38:51.000
And it was the same thing with music. Once I started making music on the computer, it was like, I want to make a Phantasy Star IV remix.

38:51.000 --> 38:55.000
I'm just going to do it. It was awful, but I just did it.

38:55.000 --> 39:01.000
And so I had sort of a concept in mind when I started out.

39:01.000 --> 39:08.000
And everything that I applied myself to in terms of learning, I'm using Unity, which is of course very popular.

39:08.000 --> 39:11.000
It's probably like a third of games at least use Unity.

39:11.000 --> 39:21.000
I kind of focused on learning Unity within the framework of the specific game I wanted to make.

39:21.000 --> 39:25.000
Which is probably not the right way to do it necessarily.

39:25.000 --> 39:29.000
But it's extremely satisfying. It's very motivating.

39:29.000 --> 39:34.000
So I would say, okay, I know I want to have sprites, so how do I draw a sprite on the screen?

39:34.000 --> 39:41.000
Okay, got that. How do I make something that the player can click on pop up on the screen?

39:41.000 --> 39:45.000
Because it's a role-playing game, so you need to have menus and stuff. Okay, got that. Next.

39:45.000 --> 39:52.000
So if I were kind of taking the approach of, I need to learn everything about programming and Unity from the start,

39:52.000 --> 39:58.000
then I'd be learning all this stuff that I wouldn't necessarily apply to this project.

39:58.000 --> 40:01.000
Because again, I'm not saying it's necessarily the right way to do it.

40:01.000 --> 40:08.000
But taking that piece-by-piece approach and then just iterating over and over like, okay, here's the game, here's a sprite,

40:08.000 --> 40:13.000
and now I can move it around. And now there's a monster, and now I can attack the monster, and now the monster moves around too.

40:13.000 --> 40:21.000
So doing it step-by-step kept me motivated, and I would just go online, look at a tutorial or something for the next feature that I wanted to do.

40:21.000 --> 40:27.000
And then also having people that I could talk to that had Unity experience.

40:27.000 --> 40:30.000
And there are some great Discord chats for that.

40:30.000 --> 40:38.000
And I have to thank also, there's a friend of mine, Jim Shepherd, who I wrote music for several of his games now.

40:38.000 --> 40:43.000
And he's just a master programmer. He's got a long history of AAA experience.

40:43.000 --> 40:47.000
And so to be able to talk to him too was a big help anytime I hit a wall.

40:47.000 --> 40:52.000
Which of course I would, because I didn't do it in the right order.

40:52.000 --> 40:56.000
Well, I've heard, and I'm sorry, I was kind of interrupting you a minute ago, but I was having a laugh,

40:56.000 --> 41:02.000
because I've heard the whole, you have to make Pac-Man, you have to make Pong thing as well.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
And I think that's probably how you have to do it for most people.

41:04.000 --> 41:07.000
But I think at the end of the day, you have to do what works for you.

41:07.000 --> 41:10.000
And I think even probably Loki would agree to this, which is why I'm laughing,

41:10.000 --> 41:13.000
because he almost said the exact same thing on the show not that long ago,

41:13.000 --> 41:17.000
is that I can't just do Pac-Man. I have to do what I want to do.

41:17.000 --> 41:22.000
Because it's boring. And it's not that it's necessary to finish something,

41:22.000 --> 41:28.000
but I was even trying to teach myself the rest of C-Sharp outside of Unity,

41:28.000 --> 41:31.000
because I kind of taught myself a little bit of C-Sharp for Unity,

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
but I was like, I wonder how different it is outside of Unity.

41:33.000 --> 41:36.000
It's so boring. I just don't want to do it.

41:37.000 --> 41:44.000
Exactly. I mean, it's different, I think, if you were doing it in a structured environment,

41:44.000 --> 41:49.000
like you're taking a class. I never took any classes in game development or anything like that.

41:49.000 --> 41:52.000
When you're teaching yourself, there's so much out there.

41:52.000 --> 41:56.000
I just feel like if you're going to devote your nights and weekends,

41:56.000 --> 41:59.000
which is what I was doing for a long time with Tangledeep,

41:59.000 --> 42:02.000
whatever just little bit of free time I had,

42:02.000 --> 42:08.000
I want to show something for it. I don't want to just spend my weekend on this,

42:08.000 --> 42:11.000
and then like, hey, I think I didn't want to make.

42:11.000 --> 42:14.000
That's just the lowest amount of motivation you could have.

42:14.000 --> 42:18.000
Well, I understand your hesitation to talk about all the programming stuff

42:18.000 --> 42:22.000
when the game isn't out yet, but look, you've got something out there,

42:22.000 --> 42:26.000
and I don't think you're going to jinx yourself at all.

42:26.000 --> 42:33.000
I think people will be very happy with the finished product, so congratulations on what you've self-taught

42:33.000 --> 42:39.000
and otherwise learned through other people networking with other people you've worked with before.

42:39.000 --> 42:43.000
I want to ask you about this before I get to some of our chatter questions

42:43.000 --> 42:47.000
because we are, again, taking questions in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

42:47.000 --> 42:50.000
Yeah, one of the backers is actually chiming in our chat room right now.

42:50.000 --> 42:54.000
Strixel says, backer chiming in that Tangledeep as is is very good and fun.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
So there's a little reaffirmation for you.

42:56.000 --> 42:57.000
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

42:57.000 --> 43:00.000
But what I wanted to point out, because I thought this was really cool,

43:00.000 --> 43:03.000
is that with the soundtracks and with the music,

43:03.000 --> 43:08.000
since that was the bread and butter before game programming,

43:08.000 --> 43:11.000
you're going a two-soundtrack approach with this thing,

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
and you can actually check out on SoundCloud.

43:13.000 --> 43:18.000
You've got modern, regular orchestral soundtracks,

43:18.000 --> 43:21.000
but then you have Super Nintendo-style soundtracks.

43:21.000 --> 43:27.000
It's the same soundtrack, but then you kind of redid it in a Super Nintendo music-making program, right?

43:27.000 --> 43:30.000
Yeah, so I don't know if my wife is listening to this right now.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
She might be. She's in the other room right now,

43:32.000 --> 43:36.000
so she can probably hear my side of the conversation if she's not actually tuned in.

43:36.000 --> 43:41.000
So that's her idea, basically.

43:41.000 --> 43:48.000
I want to say that because my initial thought was I just wanted to do it Super Nintendo-style.

43:48.000 --> 43:54.000
That was actually because I have such nostalgia for those games,

43:54.000 --> 43:59.000
and that's a product of my age and what I grew up playing.

43:59.000 --> 44:02.000
But she was kind of listening to what I wrote and saying,

44:02.000 --> 44:06.000
she doesn't have the Super Nintendo nostalgia. They had a Genesis.

44:06.000 --> 44:10.000
And so she was thinking, I don't have any connection to these sounds.

44:10.000 --> 44:13.000
And a lot of other people don't. Anybody younger, they're not going to have the same connection.

44:13.000 --> 44:17.000
She was like, you should take this, and you should make it into a modern soundtrack.

44:17.000 --> 44:21.000
And at first I was like, oh, I don't know. It's going to be more work.

44:21.000 --> 44:26.000
But then when I actually tried it and took the main dungeon theme and I started doing it,

44:26.000 --> 44:34.000
and I started adding some live parts in too, I was like, wow, actually, this really is a good idea.

44:34.000 --> 44:37.000
So I really have to thank her for that suggestion.

44:37.000 --> 44:43.000
And yeah, I'm going to do it for the whole soundtrack with the order of starting with the Super Nintendo stuff

44:43.000 --> 44:47.000
and doing it authentically like that, and it's all general MIDI.

44:47.000 --> 44:53.000
No fancy samples or anything like that. And then taking it and blowing it up into the modern production.

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
So that's the workflow.

44:55.000 --> 44:59.000
Well, Jill is listening. She's in chat, so we were able to give her a big blow there.

44:59.000 --> 45:04.000
But that's a neat story because I would have assumed for some reason,

45:04.000 --> 45:07.000
I mean, again, I would have assumed it went the other way around,

45:07.000 --> 45:12.000
that the modern was first and then it kind of was deconstructed to Super Nintendo.

45:12.000 --> 45:15.000
But that's really interesting that it actually is the other way. That's really cool.

45:15.000 --> 45:19.000
So let me get to some of our, I know we're getting to our time here,

45:19.000 --> 45:22.000
but I want to get to a few listener questions over at live.vognetwork.com.

45:22.000 --> 45:26.000
Let me get to this question. I love this question from SSG100Matt who asks,

45:26.000 --> 45:32.000
do you plan to come back and or perform at MAGFest?

45:32.000 --> 45:39.000
I definitely am going to be at MAGFest. I've been going for, I don't know, like seven years now.

45:39.000 --> 45:44.000
And I don't normally do any kind of live performance stuff. It's usually not my thing.

45:44.000 --> 45:50.000
But Ocean's Andrew, OA, who is a remixer on OCR and Judge,

45:50.000 --> 45:54.000
and he's Overclock University is part of that as well.

45:54.000 --> 45:58.000
And also he happens to be the environmental and UI artist for Tanglebeef.

45:58.000 --> 46:01.000
So it's like a lot of connections to him.

46:01.000 --> 46:05.000
He has roped me into some sort of DJ set at MAGFest.

46:05.000 --> 46:08.000
So I don't know exactly what I'm going to be doing for that,

46:08.000 --> 46:13.000
but I will have a DJ set ready and I'll be doing something.

46:13.000 --> 46:18.000
I will be sure to check it out. You know, I actually, thanks to some of our listeners here at OLR,

46:18.000 --> 46:22.000
I got tuned on to go into MAGFest. I went for my second year this last January.

46:22.000 --> 46:26.000
I had a blast. Like it's just a great call. I flew from California to go.

46:26.000 --> 46:29.000
Like I know we're getting our own version, but it's not going to be the same.

46:29.000 --> 46:33.000
Like I shouldn't say that. I really shouldn't say it, but it's not going to be the same as the DC one.

46:33.000 --> 46:36.000
You know, that's an amazing convention. I'm really...

46:36.000 --> 46:39.000
Yeah, I can't recommend it enough. It's so cool.

46:39.000 --> 46:42.000
Yeah, and hopefully the West Coast one does get a lot of the same vibe.

46:42.000 --> 46:47.000
I definitely will go and check it out for sure, but there's something about the Prime site.

46:47.000 --> 46:54.000
Anyway, I want to go to another chat comment from Strixel here at live.vognetwork.com who says,

46:54.000 --> 46:57.000
What drew you to roguelikes?

46:57.000 --> 47:00.000
Oh, that's a great question.

47:00.000 --> 47:12.000
So, Roguelikes, that's been a genre favorite of mine for a long time,

47:12.000 --> 47:16.000
because ever since Castle of the Winds on PC,

47:16.000 --> 47:22.000
and I was just thinking about that because Jim Shepherd, Dungeon Man,

47:22.000 --> 47:25.000
who I just mentioned, that was an inspiration for him as well,

47:25.000 --> 47:28.000
like the Castle of the Winds, and that's been around for a long, long time.

47:29.000 --> 47:35.000
And I've always liked that genre because I guess I'm the kind of person

47:35.000 --> 47:42.000
that will tend to memorize and kind of play a little more the optimal way if I can.

47:42.000 --> 47:46.000
So in other words, if I play the same level a million times,

47:46.000 --> 47:50.000
go for the fastest route, go for the best build, I kind of just gravitate towards that.

47:50.000 --> 47:55.000
And roguelikes really make it much harder to do that because everything is procedurally generated,

47:55.000 --> 47:58.000
it's adding that extra layer of challenge, and it's always engaging

47:58.000 --> 48:01.000
because you can't just rely on memory every time,

48:01.000 --> 48:05.000
because so much of it is randomly generated.

48:05.000 --> 48:10.000
So that is the big thing that drew me into it ever since the days of Castle of the Winds,

48:10.000 --> 48:14.000
which I think you can play for free now, actually, and it's still a good game.

48:14.000 --> 48:17.000
It definitely doesn't look too good, but it's still a great game.

48:17.000 --> 48:20.000
Yeah, I remember the original actual Rogue.

48:20.000 --> 48:23.000
I think it was a cartridge, maybe a disc on my Commodore 64.

48:23.000 --> 48:27.000
We had the actual game Rogue. I think Epyx published it for a time there.

48:27.000 --> 48:32.000
And if you guys out there, if you've never played the original old-school Rogue,

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
it's still worth a look.

48:34.000 --> 48:38.000
You might kind of be turned off by the fact that it's just like ASCII art,

48:38.000 --> 48:43.000
there's no real graphics, but you see where that comes from,

48:43.000 --> 48:46.000
where all these other games have been birthed because of this classic.

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
It's really something.

48:48.000 --> 48:53.000
Anyway, Zircon, I really want to thank you for taking the time out to be on our show this week.

48:53.000 --> 48:56.000
I want to wish you the best of luck with Tangledeep and its release,

48:56.000 --> 49:00.000
which is targeted for December this year, right?

49:00.000 --> 49:04.000
Yeah, and I do not intend on missing that.

49:04.000 --> 49:07.000
I'm working very hard to make sure that we hit that.

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
Everything is kind of scoped and planned around it,

49:09.000 --> 49:12.000
and I went out of my way to make sure that with Kickstarter,

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
I was so tempted to say things like,

49:14.000 --> 49:18.000
I'm going to do a world map, and I'm going to do ten new features,

49:18.000 --> 49:23.000
but I've got to stick to the scope that I have in mind

49:23.000 --> 49:26.000
so that it does not go over time, and we get it out this year.

49:26.000 --> 49:30.000
Well, yeah, you even had your little project plan out there

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
for everybody to look at on the Kickstarter.

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
I did. We'll see how badly I missed it.

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
Oh, stop, stop. I'm sure we'll be fine.

49:36.000 --> 49:39.000
If people want to follow the progress, I know Twitter is a good spot.

49:39.000 --> 49:44.000
The game is at Tangledeepgame, is the Twitter that they can follow.

49:44.000 --> 49:47.000
Your personal Twitter, should I give that out, too, for following?

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
Yeah, absolutely, yeah, at zirconst.

49:49.000 --> 49:53.000
Awesome. Any other websites or things we need to plug while you're here?

49:53.000 --> 49:59.000
If you go to tangledeep.com, I forget if I don't have the link,

49:59.000 --> 50:02.000
I'll have it up there tonight, but we actually have a Discord chat,

50:02.000 --> 50:05.000
which is cool. It's a general chat about the game.

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
I post builds and stuff.

50:07.000 --> 50:10.000
Sometimes I stream game development on Twitch,

50:10.000 --> 50:14.000
and there's also a place where you can report bugs or talk about balance.

50:14.000 --> 50:17.000
It's pretty active, actually, and Strix is in there.

50:17.000 --> 50:21.000
Yeah, it's cool. If that link is not on the site, it will be soon.

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
All right, awesome.

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
Again, Zircon, I want to thank you for being on the show,

50:25.000 --> 50:28.000
and I'll be looking forward to Tangledeep this December,

50:28.000 --> 50:31.000
and I'll be looking forward to MAGFest 2018 as well.

50:31.000 --> 50:34.000
All right, sounds good, and thank you for having me.

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
Hey, no problem. You take care.

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
All right, bye-bye.

50:38.000 --> 50:41.000
All right, that is Zircon from the game Tangledeep,

50:41.000 --> 50:44.000
but also the long career of music making

50:44.000 --> 50:47.000
that goes all the way back to OC Remix

50:47.000 --> 50:51.000
and moving on to commercial releases like Soulcalibur V.

50:51.000 --> 50:54.000
I mean, the man's just done a lot when it comes to video game music,

50:54.000 --> 50:58.000
and now getting on the other end of the rest of the game development.

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
I know he has some help, too.

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
I didn't give him a chance to...

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
Well, he shouted out one of his art guys,

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
two other people he's working with, to make that game happen,

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
and wishing them much, much success,

51:08.000 --> 51:11.000
and you guys will have to keep an eye on that

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
and check out that game when it releases.

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
All right, well, speaking of checking out games,

51:15.000 --> 51:18.000
we like to... Again, this is a three-hour show, y'all.

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
We still got some news to get into for the week.

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
I want to get into, of course, though, a little bit about

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
how are the games that you've been playing this week,

51:24.000 --> 51:27.000
as a little bit of a frame of the reference here at the top of the show.

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
It was moderately eventful.

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
I've been playing...

51:33.000 --> 51:38.000
I beat, during the last two weeks, I beat Mass Effect Andromeda,

51:38.000 --> 51:44.000
and I am on my second play-through, aiming for 100% play-through on that one.

51:44.000 --> 51:48.000
I went back to World of Warcraft since the new patch for Legion came out,

51:48.000 --> 51:54.000
and I've been a little disappointed with how few world quests there have been,

51:54.000 --> 52:04.000
because I'm really trying to get the Revered for my faction so that I can fly.

52:04.000 --> 52:10.000
And so I'll finish the quest in an hour, and I'm like, okay, where's more?

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
But there's one thing I can't do, because it's a solo fight

52:12.000 --> 52:17.000
that's clearly something that should have been done for five people, so whatever.

52:18.000 --> 52:24.000
Other than that, Miitomo, Pokemon Go,

52:24.000 --> 52:27.000
although I haven't been able to do a lot of walking with it since...

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
I'm supposed to be wearing a boot.

52:29.000 --> 52:30.000
Das Boot.

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
A walking boot. It's called Das Boot.

52:32.000 --> 52:36.000
I told Dan the other day that I could probably smite my enemies with that boot.

52:36.000 --> 52:40.000
Fantas in our chat wants to know, is Mass Effect Andromeda worth 100%ing?

52:40.000 --> 52:45.000
Yeah, I think it is, because I missed quite a few things on my first play-through

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
that I kind of wish I had gone back and gotten.

52:47.000 --> 52:51.000
There's actually even a few quests that I think you can't go back and do

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
if you've missed them the first time around.

52:53.000 --> 52:57.000
I had the thing forum on my journal, but I couldn't find the points to do it.

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
It just wasn't showing up on the map.

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
And maybe they'll patch that again.

53:01.000 --> 53:06.000
The last patch actually did quite a bit, at least for the aesthetics of the game.

53:06.000 --> 53:09.000
There's some people who still walk kind of funny,

53:09.000 --> 53:12.000
but for the most part, it's been pretty good.

53:12.000 --> 53:15.000
I've hit a weird wall with Mass Effect Andromeda.

53:15.000 --> 53:19.000
I didn't beat it, and I don't want to say I'm uninspired,

53:19.000 --> 53:23.000
but I've just been allowing myself to get distracted with other games,

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
and I'm like, I'll come back to Andromeda.

53:25.000 --> 53:28.000
It sounds like they have a few more things I kind of want to work on,

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
so I'm not really in a rush to beat it.

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
My only thing is I want to avoid spoilers,

53:32.000 --> 53:35.000
but I know you're good enough you're not going to spoil it.

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
Shane knows I'll kick his ass if he spoils it.

53:37.000 --> 53:42.000
Otherwise, I'm kind of like, I'll take my time,

53:42.000 --> 53:45.000
and I'll get around to beating it eventually when it's kind of all patched up.

53:45.000 --> 53:48.000
But I feel like I might have painted myself into a corner a little bit

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
because I'm not getting any of the loyalty missions,

53:50.000 --> 53:53.000
and I'm understanding I'm kind of close to the end of the game.

53:53.000 --> 53:58.000
Make sure that you select the journals for the characters,

53:58.000 --> 54:02.000
and it'll give you what you're waiting on or what to do next.

54:02.000 --> 54:06.000
That really, really helped me because there's a lot of them

54:06.000 --> 54:13.000
that require a certain event to happen before the next string of the loyalty mission.

54:13.000 --> 54:21.000
And I did all the loyalty missions before doing the Archon ship mission.

54:21.000 --> 54:25.000
And it'll actually say Archon ship mission, so it's not a spoiler.

54:25.000 --> 54:29.000
But I did them all before that because I thought that was the big thing,

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
and it wasn't the big thing.

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
But you can get them done pretty quickly.

54:33.000 --> 54:37.000
Okay. Okay. I think I've actually done the Archon ship

54:37.000 --> 54:40.000
and still don't have them unlocked, so that's the thing that's concerning me.

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
Were Salarians involved?

54:42.000 --> 54:46.000
Yes. Yes, they were. Yes, they were. Okay.

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
So then you still have time to do them.

54:48.000 --> 54:51.000
Interesting. Okay. I'll go back at some point,

54:51.000 --> 54:52.000
but I'll talk about my gaming week in a minute here.

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
I've just been distracted with other stuff, and it's like,

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
Mass Effect Andromeda will be there tomorrow.

54:56.000 --> 54:59.000
I don't have to rush to beat it in a week.

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
I've got bedding. Oh, sorry.

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
Am I putting you to sleep with my Mass Effect?

55:03.000 --> 55:07.000
No, I'm on allergy meds because of all the pollen and shit that's kicked in.

55:07.000 --> 55:15.000
But I will say this, that it's a lot easier now to make a decent-looking character.

55:15.000 --> 55:18.000
I know why they did all the presets.

55:18.000 --> 55:22.000
I mean, I'm pretty sure it's because it affects the way that, you know,

55:22.000 --> 55:26.000
Daddy Rider looks, but still.

55:26.000 --> 55:27.000
Okay. Yeah.

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
Well, if that's it for your gaming week, let me go to Loki.

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
How was your gaming week?

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
Well, I played a few different things.

55:33.000 --> 55:36.000
I played a little bit more Skyrim. Not that much.

55:36.000 --> 55:39.000
I finished the quest line I was on, so that's done.

55:39.000 --> 55:44.000
And then I played a little bit more of Thimbleweed Park, which is fun.

55:44.000 --> 55:48.000
It's like that old LucasArts adventure game style type of game,

55:48.000 --> 55:51.000
because it's done by the people that did that.

55:51.000 --> 55:56.000
And I'm enjoying it, so that's pretty fun.

55:56.000 --> 56:00.000
And then I got sucked into another idol clicker game.

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
Oh, Jesus.

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
This one, I don't know, it's somewhat entertaining.

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
It's pretty relaxing.

56:06.000 --> 56:11.000
It's Office Space Idol Profits or something like that.

56:11.000 --> 56:14.000
Obviously, it's a license from the movie, and the whole thing is-

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
Oh, it's legit. Oh.

56:16.000 --> 56:19.000
Yeah, the whole thing is based off of just planting your virus

56:19.000 --> 56:24.000
in all the different floors in the building and you extracting pennies.

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
You know I finally broke up with clicker heroes on PS4.

56:26.000 --> 56:29.000
Like, I'm done. And you know what did it?

56:29.000 --> 56:35.000
I spent 80 hero souls on accident by hitting the wrong damn button on the screen.

56:35.000 --> 56:38.000
And I was like, fuck this, I'm out.

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
That's finally what shut it down for me.

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
Yeah, I never really got into it.

56:42.000 --> 56:45.000
You can't undo stuff like that. That pissed me off.

56:45.000 --> 56:49.000
Yeah, I tried it a little bit and I was just like, eh, I'm not really into this.

56:49.000 --> 56:52.000
But, yeah, so I've been playing that a little bit.

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
And then, of course, Pokémon Go, just the daily stuff.

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
I hit 26 the other day.

56:56.000 --> 56:57.000
Congrats.

56:57.000 --> 57:01.000
Just playing, you know, five minutes here, five minutes there.

57:01.000 --> 57:04.000
I mean, I don't know. Not that gung ho into it.

57:04.000 --> 57:09.000
But I'm not playing Ingress, so, you know, it's something.

57:09.000 --> 57:13.000
And what else? Oh, I did pick up Everything,

57:13.000 --> 57:17.000
which is some weird, like, artsy game that has really bad animation for their animals.

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
And I thought that was funny. And only because of that.

57:19.000 --> 57:23.000
And I actually did try to play, there was another game called Epic Battle Simulator

57:23.000 --> 57:26.000
that does not run on my computer at all.

57:26.000 --> 57:30.000
I tried to play it and it's just like, my computer's like, what the fuck are you trying to do with me here?

57:30.000 --> 57:33.000
I can't run this shit. I'm too old.

57:33.000 --> 57:36.000
So, I was going to play that, though, because that's funny.

57:38.000 --> 57:42.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
use the passphrase, meet.

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
Alright, is that it for gaming week?

57:46.000 --> 57:47.000
That's it.

57:47.000 --> 57:50.000
Well, then I will talk about my gaming week here briefly.

57:50.000 --> 57:54.000
So, yeah, like I said, I haven't been playing as much Mass Effect Andromeda.

57:54.000 --> 57:57.000
Still been playing, of course, Final Fantasy XIV.

57:57.000 --> 58:00.000
Here's the other game I randomly, and I mean randomly, just got back into,

58:00.000 --> 58:04.000
and that is playing Diablo III, but specifically on PlayStation 4.

58:04.000 --> 58:08.000
Do you guys remember, like, two and a half years ago, I think it was, I said,

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
I'm going to platinum this damn game.

58:10.000 --> 58:14.000
And then, of course, because Rob can't ever, like, I have the worst gamer ADD in the world,

58:14.000 --> 58:17.000
I can't ever stick with one game, I never got around to platinuming it.

58:17.000 --> 58:22.000
Well, okay, I haven't platinumed it yet, but I'm really, I have two trophies left to go.

58:22.000 --> 58:27.000
So, I actually, I got my hardcore character to 70, and I picked up some other trophies that I needed.

58:27.000 --> 58:33.000
The last ones I have to get are, get all six classes to level 70, which sounds hard,

58:33.000 --> 58:38.000
but once you get the experience gem from running greater rifts, and level it to 25,

58:38.000 --> 58:43.000
it's actually, like, my Crusader, I leveled to level 51 in, like, a night, so it's, like, super easy.

58:43.000 --> 58:46.000
Like, and when I say a night, I mean, like, an hour and a half.

58:46.000 --> 58:51.000
So, that part's going to be easy. The 500 bounties is the part that's going to kill me,

58:51.000 --> 58:55.000
because I'm only up to, like, 240 right now, maybe, so that's, like, not even half.

58:55.000 --> 58:58.000
So, I just have to do bounties, bounties, and more bounties.

58:58.000 --> 59:03.000
But it looks like it's in reach, and so I actually will finally platinum this damn game, knock on wood,

59:03.000 --> 59:06.000
if I don't get distracted by something shiny in the next couple weeks.

59:06.000 --> 59:09.000
I will finally platinum this damn game about three years after I said I would.

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
So, there you go.

59:11.000 --> 59:15.000
One of the games I checked out this week, I checked out Puyo Puyo Tetris,

59:15.000 --> 59:18.000
which is now on the Nintendo Switch, and that's where I checked this game out.

59:18.000 --> 59:22.000
I know it's been out on PS4 and some other places for a while,

59:22.000 --> 59:25.000
and I was a little slower to get around to it, plus I wanted to, you know, I liked the whole,

59:25.000 --> 59:30.000
it's on the TV, no, now I can play it in bed, or wherever my Switch is.

59:30.000 --> 59:37.000
So, yeah, I mean, the story is, like, it's kind of nonexistent, it's just, it's anime trash.

59:37.000 --> 59:42.000
And I don't, I'm not calling all anime trash, I'm saying this specifically is anime trash.

59:42.000 --> 59:45.000
But that's fine, like, sometimes you live for a bad movie,

59:45.000 --> 59:49.000
and I think some people are getting their memes and stuff off of this game,

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
and that's fine, there's a lot of silly stuff.

59:51.000 --> 59:56.000
But when it comes down to it, there's a very competent just, like, base Tetris mode that you can play,

59:56.000 --> 59:59.000
or a base Puyo Puyo mode that you can play,

59:59.000 --> 01:00:02.000
and it's like you get both those games in one package and it's cool.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:06.000
And yes, they did some interesting little things where they actually have a mode

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:09.000
that involves Tetris blocks and Puyo Puyo at the same time,

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:12.000
and it's like the blocks push through the Puyos,

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:17.000
so you can kind of, like, you can cause a delay trick where the Puyos will come back.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
So it's like you're playing both games at the same time.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:22.000
It's complicated, but it's kind of fun.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:27.000
So I like that it's different, but that you can also just play Tetris or Puyo Puyo if you want.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:33.000
When I got it for PlayStation 4, Dan and I would, I would pick the Puyo side, he would pick the Tetris side.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Yeah, and you can do that, and you can still send each other lines and trash.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:43.000
It was really fun. I mean, he was, we were pretty on equal footing because I'm really,

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:47.000
I mean, I used to be really good at Puyo Puyo, I'm out of practice, but it's a fun game.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:52.000
You know, I just was really surprised that they took so long to bring it out in the US.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.000
It's been out, like, three years already, to my recollection.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Well, they don't do Puyo games very often here.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
We got quite a few of them.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:05.000
I know they did Kirby's Avalanche and all that stuff back in the day, but I mean, Puyo Puyo games as Puyo Puyo.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:12.000
We had Puyo Pop, which was Puyo Puyo, and we had, um, there were a couple of other Puyo Puyo games that came out over here.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
It just feels like we don't get as many as they do over there, but anyway.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:17.000
We even got the little Puyolin, the little handheld LCD toy.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:21.000
They're probably, they're probably, it's probably more prevalent now than it was 10 years ago.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:28.000
But anyway, I had a similar thing. I was playing actually online against a friend of mine who can kind of murder people at Tetris.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:34.000
I was not ready for him getting, like, seven Tetrises in a row. I shit you not, like, he can do that.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
And I was like, oh god.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:43.000
But when I was playing Puyo, and he was playing Tetris, he can't, he doesn't, he's still learning Puyo, so he can't set up the chains in Puyo.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Whereas I know enough to actually set up very basic two and three chains in Puyo.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:51.000
So we had a match that went on a little while.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Still, he killed me because I, you just can't compete with somebody that can get Tetris after Tetris after Tetris.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:00.000
But it was still fun. And the online mode actually worked, so there's that.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:06.000
I've also been playing Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, which just came out on the Switch a couple days ago.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Since it just came out a couple days ago, excuse me, I'm still getting over the cold.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Since it just came out a couple days ago, I haven't had the chance to spend a lot of time with it.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:20.000
But I will just say this, it does look gorgeous on the Switch's, like, built-in screen.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Like, that little HD screen with the Switch is just, like, it's so bright and vibrant and pops.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Like, it's really cool.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.000
And I'm really looking forward to meeting up with some other people who have it,

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:34.000
so we can all kind of play Mario Kart in the wireless mode.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
So, that'll be fun.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:41.000
I'm hoping to also play a little bit after tonight's show, which, to follow up this comment in chat,

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
come on, CupidBoy in chat says,

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Rob Roberts, why don't you Twitch much?

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:51.000
For one, I kind of have to, like, when I do a Twitch, I don't want to just play the game.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.000
I want to be lively and talk about it and talk with people.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:58.000
And sometimes you kind of have to, you know, that takes a little bit of extrovertedness,

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:03.000
and sometimes I just want to not have that for a night, so I don't always want to stream.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:07.000
But also, this is the other big reason, I really wanted to do some more streaming this past week,

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
but then I got sick.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:12.000
So, I've been sick for, like, the past, like, I'm not even kidding, week and a half.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Like, it's just now finally leaving, so that's been a big stopper for that, too.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:23.000
But I will be doing Mario Kart 8 tonight after the show at twitch.tv slash Rob Roberts,

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.000
so you can follow me over there.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:28.000
I will be doing that tonight as an OLR post-show, so there's that.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
I guess that's really everything I wanted to talk about this week.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:33.000
I feel like there was one more game I wanted to mention,

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.000
but I guess if I think of it later, I'll mention it later.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:39.000
But those have been the games I've been taking up most of my time.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:42.000
So, some quick housekeeping.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:49.000
There will be no show on June 25th, I think is the date.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
I'm trying to remember what Sunday is near there.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
I'm actually going to be out of town.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:58.000
I realize I'm well aware that falls right around the anniversary of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:05.000
We will be celebrating 15 years of Orange Lounge Radio on June 18th will be the big show.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:08.000
And the reward for 15 years of Orange Lounge Radio?

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.000
A week off without being sick.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
A week off for vacation purposes.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
That will be the big reward.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:18.000
I'm going to be going to Chicago to visit some friends and taking Alan out there,

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
so I'll be having a good time.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.000
And hopefully Dark Soccer and Loki will have some fun around here.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:24.000
But that's still a couple months off.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:28.000
That's our next planned show off June 18th.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Excuse me, June 25th, because June 18th will be such a big show.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
15 years of OLR, if you can believe it.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
I need to get a pretty dress.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.000
A key senior address?

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Why not? I'll go to the thrift store and get something out of the 80s.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:44.000
Should we? Do I want to commit ourselves to this?

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Alright, fuck it. I'm just going to put it out there. We'll do it live.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Do we want to bring back a video camera for June 18th and do the show on Twitch as a special little here we are?

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Maybe.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Oh, that's some progress out of Dark Soccer.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:59.000
I'll stay off camera.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Alright.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
You can look at my dress.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
You need to go full on nunnery.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:07.000
No, because I'm not a novice yet.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Okay, I guess you can. Alright.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Yeah, I can only manifest when I am with my big sister.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
I see. Alright. Well, maybe.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:20.000
And for those who don't know, I am a postulant as a sister of Perpetual Indulgence.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.000
So, look it up.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Clap, clap, clap.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Okay, well, aside from that, you could do full on BioQueen drag, though, if you wanted, right?

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.000
That's not against the rules.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:32.000
You know what? I will channel Valentina.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
You can beat your face for the gods.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:38.000
For the record. You saw the last episode, right?

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Yes.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:42.000
I loved her lack of outfit. Just saying.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:43.000
It was brilliant.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:44.000
That was inspired.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:49.000
You will have to come on reading is fundamental to talk about that, but we got to get back to video games.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.000
Valentina.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:55.000
Alright, let's talk about video games. We got to get into gaming news this week. Loki, start us off.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:06:05.000
Well, Nintendo announced, because they don't have unlimited resources, that they're going to put out yet another system that no one asked for.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:11.000
So, Nintendo announced that they're going to be releasing a 2DS XL system for $149.99.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:14.000
It's going to be available on July 28th.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Unlike the original 2DS, it's in a clamshell form factor, so it's like an actual DS.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Just not 3D.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:29.000
But it's got all the new 3DS hardware inside.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:36.000
The 2DS thing doesn't actually really bug me because a lot of games are kind of forgoing that these days anyway.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Like, you know, Pokemon Sun and Moon is probably the biggest 3DS game still right now.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:45.000
And only one small portion of that game uses 3D at all.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:52.000
It's the whole, I don't even remember what they call the mode, but it's the Pokemon Snap ripoff that they put into Sun and Moon.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:55.000
You can actually use 3D there, and that's really the only thing that uses it.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:01.000
But it's a new 3DS, but in 2D.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:04.000
But it's that whole, the word new.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:12.000
So it will play all those new exclusives like Super Nintendo games and Xenoblade.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:15.000
And there might be one other I'm not thinking of.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:19.000
So I have to admit, there's a part of me that's just kind of like, eh?

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Again, my good old 3DS Triforce edition, I love my gold 3DS, 3DS XL from several years ago is working fine, and I see no need to replace it.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:34.000
And there is nothing here that is screaming to me.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:38.000
I mean, I like the fact that they ripped off the colors of the dress.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:42.000
You remember the infamous dress that's black and blue, or is it gold and white?

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
I can't tell what color.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:48.000
Well, this one is black and turquoise specifically.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
There is a gold and white one as well.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.000
So the two SKUs are the two colors of that infamous dress.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:54.000
I don't know if you got that.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:55.000
I did not.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:56.000
But I'm like, wow.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Is that only in Japan that they're doing that?

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:01.000
Because they said there's only one color option here, and that's just the black and turquoise.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Oh, then maybe it is Japan that's doing it.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:07.000
Well, Japan's getting a frickin' metal slime one as well that looks awesome.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.000
I don't know if you saw that.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
That one looks awesome.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:14.000
I'm not sure what this is for?

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Because, again, if it's a budget thing, I get that, but there's a $99 2DS still on the market.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:22.000
$79, actually.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:26.000
Okay, it doesn't fold up and go in your pocket, okay.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:33.000
But still, I'm like, if you're going for a budget option, usually those sorts of things, you know, you're not going to pay what now?

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:36.000
It's $50 less, so if you're basically...

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:45.000
I don't understand the point of that because it's like you basically said, okay, listen, we're not putting out 3D in our games,

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:48.000
but here's a system that doesn't do the 3D for $50 less.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:53.000
They're almost like competing against themselves.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Why does none of this make any sense?

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:01.000
I know they're still kind of pushing this too, especially after watching the last Nintendo Direct.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:04.000
They still, you know, they have these Kirby things.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:08.000
They have the Pikmin thing, Cold Sept, which I can't hang on. I love that series.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
You know, they are still trying...

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:15.000
But there's also a part of me that's like, just go full tilt boogie on Switch right now.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.000
Don't get me wrong.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Pikmin's a fun game, but how many games in the Pikmin series have we had and how many F-Zero games have we had recently?

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
I mean, or Metroid games?

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:30.000
I love my 3DS. I'm just not convinced this is...

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:35.000
You know, again, I was not convinced ever to upgrade to the new 3DS.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:42.000
This, taking the 3D out and making it a little cheaper is still not convincing me to get rid of the 3DS I have.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:48.000
Like, I don't have a 3DS or a new 3DS. I mean, this looks cool. I'm not buying one.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Yeah, I was gonna say, if you don't have a 3DS at all whatsoever in any form,

01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:01.000
there is a huge library of games you're missing out on that you, you know, it's time to just get one and...

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
I don't think so, Ian. Here's why.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Because they have a portable system as well called the Nintendo Switch,

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:14.000
and I'm very hesitant with Nintendo's track record to trust anything is gonna last forever.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:19.000
So, that's why I'm not jumping on board with this brand new system that they're coming out with,

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:23.000
because who the fuck knows when this whole shit was gonna get discontinued?

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:29.000
I mean, I'm not, at this point, like I haven't jumped into the 3DS, I'm probably not going to.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:34.000
I mean, that's it. If there was something that I was gonna, you know, it would be worth it,

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
and then I would have done it a long time ago.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:41.000
But, you know what, there's people out there I see on Twitter and stuff that are all excited about this system

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:45.000
and loving the colors, they're gonna pick it up, so you know, more power to you, good, you know,

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
I hope you have fun with it, hope it's worth it for you.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
What if some people pick up everything Nintendo puts out?

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Yeah, I'm just kind of like, but if you already have a 3DS, especially if you have a new 3DS already,

01:10:54.000 --> 01:11:01.000
it's like, what is this, you're gonna get this for the colors, and I don't know, I don't get it as much,

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:08.000
but it's your money, you buy what you want, you go on with yourself, it's fine, but I will be passing.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:14.000
Unless, you know what, maybe Nintendo at E3 is gonna come out and say, listen up fuckers,

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:20.000
the 2DS, that's exactly how Reggie's gonna phrase it, listen up fuckers, 2DS ain't dead,

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:25.000
because guess what, we got a new 2D Metroid game coming out on the 2DS this year.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:30.000
I'm gonna be like, really pissed on one hand, but at the same hand I'm gonna be like,

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:35.000
ah, you sons of bitches, here's my money, take it, take it, here's more money, take it,

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:40.000
take it, what, a special Samus 3DS, fine, take that too, here's my money, enjoy it.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.000
Right.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:42.000
That's all it's gonna take.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:49.000
Well, you know what, I stand corrected that there was a Metroid game that got released,

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:54.000
how could I forget that there was a Metroid game, oh maybe because it doesn't fucking look like Metroid at all.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.000
We don't count.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:56.000
Stupid Federation Force, I mean.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
We don't count that, that didn't happen.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:11:59.000
That's a pretty good imagination.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:03.000
Garbage, absolute garbage, I don't trust them one bit.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:05.000
Alright, hey.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:10.000
Hey, we got a new F-Zero game, it's called F-Zero, fuck you, we're not giving you a good game.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:16.000
It's slow ass cars, they're snails now, Super Snails, it's F-Zero, it's fucking snails racing.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:26.000
Like it or not, and I'm in the not camp, I do believe Mario Kart is Nintendo's all-in racer at this point.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:33.000
Especially with all the other Nintendo properties they're bringing in, I feel like a new F-Zero game just ain't happening.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:39.000
I would love to be proven wrong more than anything in the world, but I'm done getting my hopes up.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:45.000
Alright, well here's a game that I think would make me very excited for a 2DS or a 3DS if it happened over there,

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:51.000
although I'd rather see it on Switch, but it's something you could actually play on PC right now, at least until they take it down.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:59.000
This is a user on itch.io named Winter Drake, who has done a game called Breath of the Ness.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:06.000
That's right, it's the Zelda game, Breath of the Wild, but as a 2D adventure. Does that sound familiar?

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:12.000
Yeah, that's right, because game developers conference this year, Nintendo had a panel and the developers behind Zelda

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:17.000
were talking about how they originally developed Breath of the Wild in a 2D format with some of the features,

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:24.000
like dynamic weather, destructible objects, some of the things that actually ended up in the game when it hit its 3D form.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:31.000
So of course, somebody stepped up to the challenge and said, I wonder what this would look like as a real game.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:39.000
So they made this game. There's a trailer that you're able to look at where you can actually topple trees on enemies,

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:46.000
lure them into dangerous spikes and so on. It has a lot of the elements from Breath of the Wild but in the more 2D format.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:53.000
So you can check that out again on itch.io, but tomorrow is Monday, that's probably when the lawyers are back in

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:59.000
and the cease and desist will be headed over to this person. The demo is free, you don't have to pay for it.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:03.000
Nintendo is probably going to end up shutting it down though, so get it while you can.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:08.000
But you know what they say, once it's on the internet, it's forever on the internet.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:15.000
So yeah, that might be worth a look, because I'm sure if you're interested in this, you've already bought Breath of the Wild,

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:20.000
the regular version. If you haven't, you're missing the hell out, because it's one of the...

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:21.000
I need to play that some more.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:24.000
It's a fantastic... I need to finish it, really.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:27.000
They picked up some new Wii U games this week from my kid.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:28.000
Oh yeah?

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:38.000
I picked up Super Mario 3D World and Pokken Tournament, because he's bitching that he doesn't have enough games to play.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:44.000
Oh, and guess what? The wonders of doing a live show, this is coming through in the chat room right now.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:48.000
This looks like this just broke a few hours ago.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:53.000
Let's see, here it is. There was a tweet that says, from Winter Drake,

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:59.000
I'm no longer legally able to distribute Breath of the NES, but any donations you made will be spent working on the game.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:04.000
The game isn't dead, I just won't be using the Zelda characters, it will live on.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:08.000
That's right, it was ordered, taken down by Nintendo.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
I'm so shocked.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:15.000
Shock and awe, but there it is. The tweets are up there.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:20.000
Oh, the Cease and Desist letter is even posted there for your perusal.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:26.000
If you want to release something like this to the internet, release it as a goddamn torrent on a torrent site,

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:29.000
because what the fuck are they going to do there?

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:33.000
Well, it's an interesting thing, because there's a part of me that says,

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:40.000
he should have just from the beginning used the non-Zelda sprites that he's going to obviously change this into now.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:46.000
He's just going to change all the sprites so that it's a completely different looking type of game, but it's still the same idea.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:51.000
But at the same time, if he had done that in the very beginning, he wouldn't have gotten all this press.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:58.000
So, I don't know, there's no easy answer here, there just isn't.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:02.000
Alright, let's move on with some other gaming news.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:09.000
I think it is aptly titled in the article as ludicrous.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
You remember Shaq-Fu?

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:12.000
Who doesn't?

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:17.000
Remember that Indiegogo about Shaq-Fu, a legendary born?

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:20.000
I don't, but everything's got a Kickstarter.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:23.000
It was there, it barely made its goal.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Well, it has been announced, of course, in 2015 for PS4, Xbox One, PC, and Wii U.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:36.000
And now it's going to be coming to Switch.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:41.000
Although there's commentary that it might have been cancelled for Wii U just to come on the Switch instead.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:45.000
It's being developed by Saber Interactive.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:52.000
And they said, not just are they getting Shaq-Fu, but they're getting another Motocross title.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:56.000
And another cooperative shooter, so who knows.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:01.000
But why can't they just let Shaq-Fu not exist?

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:05.000
Well, Jamie, what if it is actually pretty good?

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:09.000
Sorry, I couldn't even make it through without laughing. I couldn't do it.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
Well...

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
But it might, Jamie, it might.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:19.000
Or it might not.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:24.000
If someone else owns it, I'll play it.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:29.000
Dartitsuyen Chat says, I could see that happening. I think that would be neat to play on Switch.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:33.000
Well, this new game is supposed to be a beat-em-up as opposed to a one-on-one fighter.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:34.000
Well, that will fix everything.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:37.000
I'll reserve judgment for a trailer.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:40.000
I suppose that's the appropriate steps to take.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:46.000
We shouldn't judge the game until we see, you know, at least a trailer, if not the game itself.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:50.000
But it's Shaq-Fu. It's hard not to have some reservations about the game.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:51.000
You know what I'm saying?

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:52.000
No reservations.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
All right. Loki, what's up next?

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:58.000
So apparently there's some more information.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:04.000
Nintendo Life had spoken with some indie devs about kind of what their relationship is with Nintendo right now.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:12.000
Kind of in the past they've had different issues, you know, be that curation or just even assistance in getting their products onto their marketplaces.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:19.000
Well, apparently now, coming from some of the independent developers, they're saying that that relationship hasn't really gotten any better and maybe even a little bit worse.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:30.000
Saying that one developer who's been described as like a top-rated eShop, had top-rated eShop releases, basically says that, you know, where in the past he had been pretty chummy with Nintendo.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:33.000
They had like, you know, dinner meetings and stuff like that.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:38.000
Now it was like they, the way they're treating them is basically this is just a transaction.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:42.000
There's no helping them getting their product onto the store anymore.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:49.000
It was more of just like, okay, you submit us your game and we'll see, maybe we'll get it on the store for you or something.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:53.000
Just kind of some complaints that it's not really more personal.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:58.000
Also, you know, the fact that they're not really enforcing some of their policies.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:04.000
So, you know, there's some people that have been like actually shut out of the service.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:08.000
So basically they're very inconsistent about their policies.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:12.000
You know, there's games that they look at that, you know, 20% complete.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:20.000
And they're saying that, you know, they're being allowed to, you know, have permission to release on the store when they're done.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:23.000
When they have no idea what the game is going to even look like.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:29.000
Or, I don't know, it just, it seems like it's a lot harder to publish onto that platform now.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:35.000
This is weird for me to hear, though, because there's also other chatter where it sounds like Nintendo has been easier than ever.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:41.000
But it sounds like maybe if you're one of the companies in the circle or whatever, Nintendo's easier to work with than ever.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:45.000
But if you're outside of it, it might be a little harder. That's the impression I'm getting.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
Well, yeah, like, you know, they were saying that, you know, for example, you know...

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:50.000
Would you get all of this in the rumors and category?

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:55.000
It could, it's obviously people that have had problems with it and I don't think anyone's really seen it.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:56.000
Oh yeah, it's been fantastic.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:57.000
It's like reading a Yelp review.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:03.000
Exactly. Well, like they're saying, you know, getting a Wii U dev kit took about a week worth of work, which is basically nothing.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:07.000
While it was impossible to get our hands on a Switch, we had to go to a publisher for it.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:14.000
And the only other complaint about, was it, under communication professionalism is there, and no doubt about it.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:19.000
But hardware access was way more painful than it needed to be, especially compared to the Xbox One.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:23.000
Outside of that, everything else makes sense and it's in line with industry standards.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:32.000
So, I mean, is it really, like, were the Switch allocations that bad that they couldn't get dev kits out to people?

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
That's kind of stupid if you ask me.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:39.000
It's like, well, shit, can't get the hardware to develop a game for our system.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:44.000
Because, let's be honest, it's really those indie games are fucking floating your shit right now, so...

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:48.000
I mean, come on. That's kind of pathetic.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:58.000
Well, if it's true, but, I mean, I think there's probably also, because of the success of the Switch, and let's not, you know, hold back, the Switch has been extraordinarily successful.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:02.000
We got the numbers from Nintendo this week. They're selling very, very well.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:07.000
You know, there's probably a ton of indie developers that all of a sudden want to get on this thing.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:10.000
And maybe it's because of some of the good words that have been out there.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:15.000
I think there's probably a lot of indie developers that are working on Wii U titles and all of a sudden it's like, oh, Wii U is pretty much gone.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:16.000
Yeah, right.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
Well, shit, I better report this over this way.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:21.000
Until they announce it E3, Wii U U.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:25.000
Because why not? They just released a 2DS XL. Why not do a Wii U U?

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
It's like a Wii U, but without the gamepad.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
Would that be a Wii W?

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:33.000
I was just going to say a Wii W. God damn it, Jamie, beat me to the joke.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:36.000
Well, we are pensters.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:39.000
Yeah, what can you do? Alright, so...

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:42.000
Or it could be just a Wii U, like, Wii U.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:43.000
Wii U 2.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
Wii U.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
I like Wii W.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:52.000
Alright, anyway, let's get to another. We've had a lot of Nintendo stories.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:57.000
I want to talk about this game, which is headed, I think, for the PlayStation 4.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:00.000
And for the PC is where this game is headed.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:06.000
Yeah, PC and PlayStation 4 in May is a spiritual successor to Burnout.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
And I was wondering... What?

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:09.000
I said yes.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:12.000
I know, because I've kind of been wondering what's happened to the Burnout series.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
We haven't had one of these games in a while.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:20.000
In Tyrian, they were working on a game. It was supposed to be some extreme sports thing that got cancelled.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:24.000
And then I think that they were working on the Need for Speed games,

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:28.000
which had kind of sort of been going the Burnout route, but they're not quite Burnout.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:29.000
Yeah, they're not quite.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
So, that's as far as I've heard.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:35.000
Well, there's a company now out there called Three Fields Entertainment,

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:38.000
and it's made up of former Burnout franchise developers.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:42.000
They're going to be releasing a vehicular destruction game called Danger Zone.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:46.000
Please tell me they licensed... Was it Kenny Loggins that did that song?

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:47.000
Yes.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
Please tell me they licensed that song to use in this...

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:52.000
Because otherwise, how can you fucking do a game called Danger Zone and not actually...

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
With cars crashing and not have the...

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:57.000
Flying to the danger zone...

01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:00.000
It's got to be in the trailer. It's got to be in the trailer too.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
I don't know if I can support it if it doesn't.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:06.000
Well, anyway, this game takes place in a crash testing facility,

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:12.000
and you will be surviving a variety of crash testing scenarios while trying to get bonus pickups.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:16.000
The studio in its press release said you can shunt vehicles into oncoming traffic,

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
take down trailers to shed their payloads,

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:22.000
and use your explosive Smash Breaker to move your vehicle around.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
The more explosions you cause, the bigger your score.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:28.000
Smash Breaker? Let's just completely rip off fucking Burnout Smash Mode.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:33.000
This sounds like they released a game on Xbox Arcade.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:38.000
Yeah, it's a party. It was Burnout Party or something like that.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:39.000
Yeah.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:44.000
Yeah, because that's based off of Burnout's Crash Mode that they had.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:48.000
But, I mean, they're literally ripping that off, which is...

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:51.000
I guess it's okay, because it was fun, but...

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:54.000
I mean, they're calling it literally the same thing.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:55.000
Yeah, it's just really funny.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:59.000
Anyway, this studio, they did already release a game called Dangerous Golf,

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
but Danger Zone is coming out in May.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:04.000
Get this price, though. $12.99.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:07.000
Dangerous Golf is funny, too, because Dangerous Golf is basically...

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:12.000
It's playing golf in a house, but it's like Burnout Crash Mode

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:15.000
if you were to play golf in a house, if that makes sense.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:18.000
So, like, you're hitting a golf ball and try to break stuff in a house

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:21.000
and your golf ball can explode and all sorts of ridiculous stuff

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:24.000
because it's basically Burnout as a golf ball.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:27.000
The sad thing is, though, it doesn't sound like it has the actual racing parts.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
Like, that was... It sounds like that's missing.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:30.000
Yeah, that is unfortunate.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
Too bad. But for $12.99, okay.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
Like, because if the racing had been there, then it would probably be a security game.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
Just EA, come on, bring back fucking Burnout.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
No one gives a shit about Need for Speed anymore.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:42.000
Just give Need for Speed a year off and fucking put out Burnout Paradise 2

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
or whatever the fuck you're going to put out.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:48.000
Anyway, some good comments in chat regarding the whole Kenny Loggins thing.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:51.000
JD suggesting Archer should also be there.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:52.000
Kenny Loggins and Archer.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:55.000
And Dark Tetsuya saying, if Rock Band can get them both,

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
maybe these guys could license him for a cameo.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:00.000
Anything is possible, folks. Anything is possible.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:05.000
Anyhow, we need to get to the classic game of the week.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:10.000
That's not her music. Wrong music.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
How about that one?

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:13.000
Sure.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
Emails are in part B. How about this one instead?

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
Every week, Dar Sakura steps into the gaming vault

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:22.000
and finds a game that she thinks, hey, listen, hey, listen.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
Oh, wait, no, that's her fairy garden.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:27.000
My fairy garden is Navi-free, thank you.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:30.000
She steps into the gaming vault, finds a game that she thinks, hey,

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:34.000
you kids should be checking this game out this week.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
Dar Sakura, what did you pick for the classic game of the week?

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
I picked Burnout.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
How ironic.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:41.000
Mm-hmm.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
And we didn't even compare notes.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:44.000
No, we didn't.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:45.000
We sure didn't.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:48.000
I actually picked Burnout because Dan was watching Roadkill Garage

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:51.000
and so I went to see if I had interest in metal, which I have,

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:54.000
so I picked Burnout instead.

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:57.000
Well, it's a good choice. It's a timely choice.

01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:07.000
So Burnout was released in 2001 and it came out on PlayStation 2 initially.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:12.000
It later got GameCube and Xbox versions a year later in 2002,

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:15.000
but it still meets my criteria.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:20.000
It was noted for crashing.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
You're supposed to crash on purpose.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:25.000
So you have Championship mode, which is the main mode of the game,

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:28.000
and you've got different races in that mode,

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
and you compete against other cars,

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:34.000
and it gets harder and harder and harder because it's a race.

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
And then you have a face-off challenge after each of those

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:40.000
where you can unlock a new car if you win.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
You've got sprinting. You've got all this other one.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:45.000
You have all kinds of different cars in it too

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:50.000
that are generic, unbranded cars as far as I remember.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:54.000
But the big thing about this game is the crashes,

01:26:54.000 --> 01:27:03.000
and it has led to pretty crazy versions of later games that have...

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:06.000
Although, did it kind of move away from the whole crash thing?

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:09.000
There's an E version, I think.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:10.000
No.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:11.000
No?

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
That's Burnout. Of course it didn't.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:16.000
Well, no, there was another one that it's got...

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:21.000
I'm thinking of the iOS version because it's all nothing but crashes.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
Yeah, I was going to say, you might be thinking of the thing we were thinking of a minute ago,

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
the whole party spin-off thing that they had.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:26.000
Yeah.

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:29.000
But the whole thing is that you're supposed to rack up

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:34.000
as much property damage as you can with one crash.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:39.000
And the crash mechanics got more and more and more and more ridiculous.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:42.000
But there's not really much to say about it.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:46.000
It's a racing game with crashes, and exploding things is pretty damn cool.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
Well, it wasn't just about crashing, because Burnout was about

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:51.000
you get nitrous, or boost, I guess.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:54.000
Your boost meter goes up by driving dangerously.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:57.000
So that could be crashing into opponent cars,

01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:02.000
or driving into uncommon traffic, or cutting cars off really close.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
It's basically reckless drive for the game.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:05.000
That type of stuff.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:08.000
So that was the main racing part of the game, of course.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:11.000
And then there's crash mode, which is awesome, and you can crash into things.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:14.000
I mean, how many people played this game for the races?

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
I did. I played for both.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:17.000
Okay, five people.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:20.000
Racing is fun, but fire is funner.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:23.000
Well, you kind of have to play it for both the unlocked cars.

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:24.000
That's true.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:27.000
I want that to be on the tombstone of Orange Lounge Radio

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
when this inevitably ends someday.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:30.000
Fire is funner.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
Fire is funner.

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:35.000
But the thing that people mostly know about this game

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:40.000
is the explosions, crashing, and semi-trucks, and being a reckless driver.

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:45.000
Like, you can race for only so long, and then you have to create an accident on purpose.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:46.000
You just have to.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:49.000
I tried to do the same thing in Mario Kart, but it's not the same.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:53.000
I remember Dan trying to play through this, and trying on purpose not to crash.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:57.000
And then he'd crash, and it would take five hours to finish the crash.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:00.000
And he'd be like, damn it, I was trying to get that car.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:03.000
Man, if Criterion can make a Mario Kart game,

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:06.000
that would be awesome.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
Call it Mario Crash.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:11.000
I know this is never going to happen, and I know it was a different company.

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
It was bizarre, but what about Blur?

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:16.000
Like, that game got shafted really bad.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:17.000
It's too bad.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:18.000
It's too bad. Blur was...

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
But Activision tends to do that.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:21.000
Anyway, sorry.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
I know that's not Burnout, but I have to bring it up.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
Burnout, I'm done.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
She's burnt out on Burnout.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:28.000
Yep.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:31.000
All right, there it is, your classic game of the week, a very timely choice.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:35.000
Burnout, the original from 2001,

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:38.000
available on pretty much all the systems of the PS2 era.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:41.000
That would mean the GameCube and the Xbox as well.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:42.000
Check it out.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
All right, we're going to take a quick break,

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:47.000
but when we come back, there is plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:52.000
We'll be talking about a controversial video game from the past coming back.

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
I think you all know what's coming up with this one.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
And then Dark Sakura's going to give us a little bit of a history lesson.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
We have all that and plenty more to look forward to

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:03.000
when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:14.000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:19.000
Live tonight, episode number 684 of our show already in progress.

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:22.000
If you're just joining us, you missed a fun part A.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:25.000
We had Zircon joining us to talk about Tangledeep

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:28.000
as well as some of his other work with music and so forth.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
And then we had an interesting story from Alan,

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:34.000
who was actually on site trying to get a classic NES,

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:39.000
but alas, he was beat out by scalpers who were not shy about their scalping.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:40.000
And they suck.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:43.000
Yeah, if you missed that part of the show, you can check it out on our podcast feed.

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:46.000
If you're already checking out the show on the podcast feed, hello,

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
and thanks for joining us.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:51.000
As I say at the end of every show, we do appreciate a nice review,

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:54.000
a five-star review on iTunes or Google Play,

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
wherever it is that you found this podcast.

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:59.000
Those ratings and such go an awful long way to help us spread the word

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
about Orange Lounge Radio.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
Let's get back into some more gaming talk.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
We have some rapid-fire news to get to.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:06.000
Start with Loki.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:09.000
Yes, you may remember that Bayonetta was just released out on Steam,

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:12.000
which is kind of a surprise, and everyone's thinking,

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:13.000
oh, hey, cool.

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:14.000
Bayonetta 2.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:21.000
Bayonetta 2, or maybe another new game will be coming out soon.

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:26.000
So one of Platinum's games that people are really hoping to see next

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:29.000
would be, of course, Vanquish,

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:32.000
and there's maybe a little bit of a tease regarding that as well.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:36.000
Apparently there was a small update done to Bayonetta, the Steam version,

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:41.000
adding a Vanquish avatar to the game's extras folder.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:42.000
Hmm.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:45.000
So that was kind of a little interesting.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
Could that be hinting that Vanquish would be the next title

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
that's going to be coming to Steam?

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
I guess we'll just have to wait and find out,

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
because they haven't said anything.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
So, I don't know.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:58.000
And then, of course, for PlayStation Plus for May,

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
we're going to be getting a handful of titles,

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:05.000
including on PlayStation 4, Tales from the Borderlands and Abzu.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
Those are going to be both on PlayStation 4.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:12.000
Port Royale 3, Pirates and Merchants, and Blood Knights on PS3.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:17.000
And finally, on the Vita, Laser Disco Defenders and Typewriters.

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
Those are also crossed by on PlayStation 4.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
So they'll be coming in May.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
Just to piggyback on that a little bit,

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
don't forget it's the 30th today if you're listening live,

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:29.000
so this is your last chance to grab some of the Xbox One stuff.

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:32.000
I think Walking Dead Season 2 is one of the things today is the last chance to get.

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:37.000
And then tomorrow, it's Gianna's Sister's Twisted Dreams.

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:41.000
And I want to say Star Wars Force Unleashed 2?

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:44.000
It's a Star Wars game of some sort, is also.

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
Somebody in chat knows, but that's what's Xbox One.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:52.000
And you have until May 2nd to get a few more days for April as well.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
For PlayStation games.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:57.000
Yeah, but May 2nd is when they're going to be going up for May.

01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:02.000
Yeah, Microsoft's always kind of a hard stop on the 1st and the 15th and all that stuff,

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:07.000
but PlayStation tends to kind of cycle out whatever Tuesday is close to the 1st of the month,

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:08.000
is when they tend to do it.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
Although for E3, they might push back.

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:15.000
I remember last June, the June games didn't show up until around E3 time.

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:19.000
Well, speaking of E3 time, we're only like six weeks away, believe it or not.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:20.000
That's hard to believe.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
From the big public E3, which is going to be interesting.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
I should take some days off for the...

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
Oh, I can't afford to at this point.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:29.000
Well, I think it's like a day off, because it's really only one day.

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
It's really that first day when all the news hits, right?

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
I have all the conferences.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
Or I could just watch conferences at my desk.

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:38.000
Sadly, I can't do that this year.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:41.000
I'm going to have to just kind of play the catch-up game and so forth.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
I would love to do live reactions and so forth.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:46.000
Or nightly shows, kind of breaking it down or something.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
I just don't know if I'll be able to do that this year.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:55.000
But I know one of the things we're going to have to deal with is Bethesda's E3 event.

01:33:55.000 --> 01:34:00.000
This is all the week before our big anniversary show, right?

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:04.000
Sunday, June 11th is the E3 Bethesda conference.

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:05.000
It's right in the middle of OLR.

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:08.000
So I'll have to kind of work around that as we have for the past couple of years.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:11.000
Well, Bethesda has actually sent out their official invites this week.

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
And they kind of did an amusement park theme with this.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:19.000
But what's interesting about this amusement park theme is that if you look at the little postcards they sent out,

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:23.000
they see some things that are portrayed here in this amusement park.

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:26.000
Such as there's definitely a Fallout 4 section.

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:29.000
You can definitely see a Quake Champions.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:32.000
There's definitely a Doom thing back in there.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:35.000
Kind of an Elder Scrolls representative area as well.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:41.000
But there are two areas that show under construction.

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:48.000
So it seems like Bethesda may unveil two new games at their show this year.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
Don't expect Elder Scrolls VI.

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:56.000
Apparently it has already been commented on previously that Elder Scrolls VI is way too early in development.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
It is a long ways off. Don't expect that.

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:05.000
But there is some murmurs and things out there that one of the games could be Evil Within 2.

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:08.000
Yeah, I was going to say one of those, that's probably Elder Scrolls Online.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
Because I don't think they have...

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:13.000
No, Elder Scrolls Online is represented in the little thing.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
That game is already out in the event.

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
The top one there was Elder Scrolls Online.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:18.000
Yeah.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:19.000
They have the volcano there.

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:20.000
Yeah, so no.

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
I mean there could be a...

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
Well, they just did the Morrowind expansion, right?

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
Right, that's what that would be though.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:27.000
They have the volcano from that.

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:28.000
Gotcha.

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
And then of course Doom.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
And then it looks like Quake.

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:35.000
I'm guessing that is...

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
What the hell is that game?

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:40.000
Wolfenstein is the other thought that people are thinking.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
It could be a Wolfenstein 2 is what they're going to use.

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:43.000
Well, I don't know what the...

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:44.000
Oh, that's Prey.

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:48.000
So Prey and then Dishonored is the other one.

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
Yeah, Prey and Dishonored are represented there too.

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:51.000
And Fallout.

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:55.000
So very likely that it could be Evil Within 2 and Wolfenstein 2.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:56.000
But who knows?

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:57.000
Anything's possible.

01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:02.000
So you'll have to stay tuned for E3 to find out because maybe they have a new, new thing to do.

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:08.000
One other thing I want to mention before we go over to Dark Sakura and that is the Mega Man Legacy Collection 2.

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:12.000
Although nothing has been officially announced, apparently a Korean ratings board,

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
which has leaked a few other games in the past,

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:18.000
has leaked some information regarding the Mega Man Legacy Collection 2,

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:23.000
which would include Mega Man 7, 8, 9, and 10.

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:26.000
No word on any of the X series or anything else.

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:32.000
It's just the 7, 8, 9, and 10 to complete off what started with 1 through 6 when that was released.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:35.000
Gosh, that was about a year and a half ago at this point that that came out.

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:43.000
So this is only confirmed through the ratings board through PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:46.000
That means we have not heard a confirmation on the 3DS yet,

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:50.000
which I seem to recall the original Mega Man Collection was on the 3DS.

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:56.000
And certainly nothing on the Nintendo Switch, which I don't know if you guys know,

01:36:56.000 --> 01:37:00.000
but that Disney Afternoon Collection actually just came out this past week.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:04.000
That's the one that has the original DuckTales, DuckTales 2, Chip and Dale.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:09.000
You know, it has like a bunch of the Tailspin, you know, a bunch of those Disney games from the NES era.

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:15.000
I passed on it, which I was surprised that I did, but I'm holding out for a Switch version.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:18.000
I truly believe Switch is the console that thing ought to be on.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:26.000
I might be waiting a while, especially if Capcom's first big release is going to be that Street Fighter 2 thing they're charging, what, 30, 40 bucks for.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
Yeah, that looks like crap.

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:34.000
I'm not too excited about that, but I'm going to hope that these collections make their way to Switch at some point,

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:38.000
because I really, especially with the Disney Afternoon Collection, that's where that thing belongs.

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:39.000
It's a little silly.

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:44.000
Is Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite coming to Switch?

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
Good question. I don't think we know.

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:49.000
I don't think we know. Right now, no.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:54.000
But, you know, again, Nintendo just announced these very powerful sales figures,

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:57.000
so now third parties have probably got to be giving Nintendo another look.

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
They might have wrote it off after the Wii U.

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:02.000
I think there's going to be now people that might go back and look at Nintendo.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
We might have an interesting E3.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:07.000
We might see some things announced for Switch that we weren't expecting.

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:14.000
I mean, we haven't had third parties really playing along strongly with Wii U in a while.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
Or Nintendo, really, in a while.

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:21.000
I mean, 3DS, yes, here and there, but Wii U tended to be the focus of the E3 presentations.

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:27.000
So I'll be very curious to see how much third parties kind of take over Nintendo's E3 with some of their announcements.

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
We'll see. We'll see.

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
We've got a good six weeks to go or so.

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:34.000
Anyway, moving on. Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:35.000
Stuff.

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:38.000
Guess what? There was an MMO I used to play a while back.

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
And it was called Star Trek Online.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:41.000
Oh yeah, they're still going.

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:45.000
It is still going. They're on episode 13 now.

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:49.000
And it looks like this one is called Escalation.

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:55.000
And they're actually doing a balance update for Space Combat.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:58.000
Ground Combat got its update last season.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:09.000
And then they're also bringing in new escort vessels and doing some touches on Star Trek Nemesis.

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
So we'll see what happens with that.

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:15.000
I don't know if it's enough to make me want to play again, but it's pretty interesting.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:18.000
And then last, Gundam Versus is coming out in the US.

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:22.000
It's going to be out on PS4 by Bandai.

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:26.000
And it is a multiplayer fighting game that's based on the Mobile Suit Gundam universe.

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:32.000
So, we're getting Gundam games. That's cool. So, enjoy.

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:36.000
I will. I will enjoy.

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:37.000
Are you enjoy?

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:44.000
Yes. Alright, let's travel around and check out some games that are coming out a little sooner, as in stores, this week.

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:50.000
And what can be described as probably the weirdest spinoff of the Mass Effect series.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:53.000
The Caligula Effect is going to be coming out on Vita this week.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
A Vita game in the US?

01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:00.000
In the US, I know. They happen sometimes.

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:06.000
The Legend of Heroes Trails in the Sky III is coming out on PC.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:10.000
Prey is coming out on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:11.000
Is that demo out?

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
It is out, yes.

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
Yeah, I heard people talking about that on the Twitters.

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:23.000
And then World to the West on PC, Mac, and Linux, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Wii U.

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:26.000
Wii U getting the game. That's it.

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:30.000
Alright, well heading on over to Japan.

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:33.000
There really isn't anything to speak of on the PlayStation 4 this week.

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:37.000
Things are pretty dry over there, so nothing really for me to plug.

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:40.000
And honestly, it's kind of the same story on the PlayStation Vita as well.

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:43.000
The next release is on May 11th over there.

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:46.000
I'm thinking it's kind of a slow week in Japan.

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
Because the Switch doesn't have anything.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:51.000
But again, the physical releases are still very slow in Japan.

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:54.000
And there's actually nothing on the 3DS either.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:57.000
However, I believe it's Golden Week in Japan right now.

01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:00.000
And that could probably explain their lack of releases.

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:04.000
In fact, I just was looking up here.

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
I think it's right at the end of April, right?

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:09.000
Yeah, April 29th was Emperor's Birthday.

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:10.000
May 5th is Children's Day.

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:13.000
So we're right in the midst of Golden Week.

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:16.000
So this is why there's really no releases in Japan right now.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:19.000
So you're going to have to wait a little while.

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:22.000
Loki. I'm sorry. Dark Soccer. How about the UK?

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:29.000
On May 4th, there's Space Plan for Android and iOS and PC.

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:34.000
And then on the 5th, Prey for PC, Xbox One, PlayStation 4.

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:37.000
World to the West on the major systems as well.

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
And that's pretty it.

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:42.000
So a little bit of a slower week in releases, except for Prey.

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
That's kind of a big deal.

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:47.000
I still remember Prey on the Xbox 360, the original one.

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
But this new one's completely different.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
Nothing to do with the original Prey, right?

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:54.000
Just two games that have the same name that happen to be first-person shooters.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
I'm curious about it.

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:59.000
Let's go to the mailbag.

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
I think it's time to hear from you guys.

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
We have a couple weeks' worth of emails to catch up on.

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
But not too many.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
You guys send us emails every week.

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:15.000
DarkSoccer dives in the mailbag and finds her favorite emails to read right now.

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:19.000
Now, I may be going a slight bit out of order on some of these emails.

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
But I will go ahead and start.

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:25.000
One of these is from Sam.

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:28.000
Hello, OLR Crew. I love the show.

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
Which console are you all going to buy?

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:34.000
The $400 Scorpio or the feature-packed $600 Scorpio Elite.

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
Thank you, Sam.

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
We don't have confirmation on any of those right now.

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
And I don't think we'll know until E3.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
But I do think there were some rumblings this past week about something.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:45.000
Like, a SKU had come out or something.

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
Or, I don't know, some more details.

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:50.000
Like, we know how many teraflops are in it and all this stuff, right?

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:54.000
Well, they've already shown off the hardware too.

01:42:54.000 --> 01:43:01.000
Like, was it Digital Trends? No, it was one of the Eurogamer and stuff.

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
They were looking at it.

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
But I remember there were some rumors out there about there being two versions of it.

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
Which I don't see how they are.

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
I don't think we know anything yet.

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
Yeah, I mean, we really don't know until E3.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:16.000
And I'm going to be honest, when it comes to Scorpio, like, at this current time,

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:19.000
and if anyone from Microsoft who makes these things happens to be listening,

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
here's what's important about E3.

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:24.000
If you want me to put the money down to pre-order a Scorpio,

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:27.000
you really need to convince me, as an Xbox One owner,

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:31.000
and as a pretty beefy computer running Windows 10 user,

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
why do I need Scorpio?

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:37.000
Because right now, it doesn't seem like there's a reason for me to own it.

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:41.000
Like, anything I want, I could play on Xbox One,

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:44.000
or I could play on my Windows 10 machine.

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
Granted, there's some things that I prefer on Xbox One.

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
Just hopefully you're not playing in game mode,

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:52.000
because I saw a video today regarding Windows 10 game mode

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
that apparently looks like it sucks.

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:58.000
Really? I heard it's best used on older machines.

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
You get better frame rate on older machines.

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
But I haven't really, I don't need it.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
The games run fine for me.

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
What I follow is Alliance Tech Tips,

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:09.000
and they do a bunch of different videos regarding hardware benchmarking and stuff,

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:13.000
and they test three different SKUs, kind of like low-end, mid-tier,

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:17.000
and high-end PCs with three different games, including Gears of War 4.

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:21.000
And with game mode on, it actually cuts some of the frame rates in half,

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:24.000
like the 99% frame rate that they received.

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:25.000
Interesting.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:28.000
Yeah, so there's a lot more frame rate dips, I guess, with that.

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
No, I don't even worry about game mode.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
I haven't played with it, because I don't need to.

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
I get great frame rates from Final Fantasy XIV.

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:37.000
I get shitty frame rates with my laptop, so I'm all for that.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:42.000
But right now, I need to see what games would get me on board with it.

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:48.000
I mean, like Forza Horizon 3, but Crackdown, hopefully this year, because...

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:49.000
Finally.

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:53.000
Finally? There's no confirmation yet that it's coming out this year yet.

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
Have we heard anything about it? Nope.

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:58.000
No, but we know Scalebound's not happening now, so...

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
I mean, I don't know.

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:03.000
Microsoft's going to be a real weird wild card at E3.

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:07.000
We kind of know what to expect from Nintendo, I would say, going into E3.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:08.000
Nothing.

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:12.000
No, it's not nothing, but it's the big games that are going to sell the Switch this holiday,

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
including Mario Odyssey will be one of them.

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:17.000
There's probably going to be a second AAA game, too.

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:24.000
Can we get the pitchforks and torches out if they start, like, fucking announcing the Super Nintendo mini thing?

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
Can we start a mob?

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:30.000
If they do not address supply concerns, yes.

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
This is Nintendo. Of course they're not going to address supply concerns.

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
If they don't, then yes, we can get out the pitchforks.

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:35.000
Yeah!

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:41.000
But if they do, which they might, they might have a roundabout way of doing it.

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
They'll use boardroom speakers.

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:50.000
Somehow, we don't have unlimited resources, but we managed to get more resources.

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:54.000
Exclusive pre-orders available to my Nintendo members starting today.

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
Bam. Cut out scalpers immediately.

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:59.000
They're made out of completely different plastic.

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
Different polymers, you know.

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
And much, much harder to hack.

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:06.000
Anyway, Microsoft's going to be a very interesting wildcard for E3,

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:09.000
whereas yes, we know what to expect. We know the Scorpio is coming,

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:12.000
but what is going to substantiate the purchase of a Scorpio?

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
That's what we don't know.

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:19.000
So, my big roundabout answer to this very short email is

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:23.000
that has to be answered until we can talk further about Scorpio.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:27.000
And that is, what's the compelling reason for me to get one?

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:30.000
Because right now, beefier tech isn't doing it.

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:33.000
I really feel burned by that from PlayStation 4 Pro.

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
So, I'm not making that mistake again.

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:38.000
Anyway, next email, DarkSakura, please.

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:42.000
I will go ahead and read the next short one, which is much earlier.

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:46.000
Dear Retertainment, Kylie Minogue is a flawless goddess.

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:49.000
Please take those blasphemous statements of her being trashy elsewhere.

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:52.000
With love, Oscar. P.S. Get out of my way.

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
That's a song lyric from Kylie Minogue.

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:55.000
I know.

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
Well, I was hoping you'd sing it. No, I'm just kidding.

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:58.000
No.

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:01.000
I don't think you were here the last show, DarkSakura,

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:04.000
but Retertainment unfortunately made a fleet.

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
He was trying to refer to Kylie Minogue as campy,

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
but I think he used the word trashy,

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:11.000
and I may have read the right act live on air.

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
I know he just made it.

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:14.000
Kylie is a flawless goddess.

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:18.000
Kylie is a flawless goddess, but I think he made an innocent mistake.

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:19.000
She is campy.

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
He made a mistake.

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
No, wasn't she cammy?

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
I mean, fuck off.

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
I think we're getting to...

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:31.000
Do you know the whole reason that I saw that movie was to see her as cammy?

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:34.000
Oh, you know my, like, 12-year-old gay ass was like,

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:35.000
Kylie Minogue!

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:36.000
Right?

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:37.000
No.

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:38.000
She made a good cammy.

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:39.000
Yeah, she was...

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:40.000
And a good cammy.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:43.000
Raul Julia made that movie, really, in her.

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:44.000
Sad it was his last film.

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
It is really sad it was his last film.

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
But you know I saw it twice in the theater.

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:49.000
I always saw it once.

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:50.000
Anyway, moving on.

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:51.000
Okay.

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:52.000
Hello, LR.

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:55.000
Last week's show you mentioned the discontinuation of the Nests classic mini.

01:47:55.000 --> 01:48:00.000
I absolutely agree with you guys that the fact that this discontinuation, along with a super limited supply,

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:04.000
were absolute jerk moves and that Nintendo deserves whatever crap they're given for them.

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:09.000
But purely from a business standpoint, I believe that Nintendo got exactly what they wanted out of the Nests classic mini.

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:16.000
Now please understand that this is my personal speculation regarding the twisted, possibly deluded point of view of the Japanese corporation.

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:19.000
This is widely regarded as marching to the beat of their own drum and no one else's.

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:23.000
But Nintendo Switch is still four months out and no details have been released.

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:29.000
The 3DS is old, nobody's talking about Wii U anymore, no significant Nintendo products are on anyone's Christmas list.

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
Hi, it's May.

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:39.000
This is something that will get people talking about Nintendo again, generate new interest in the brand to please the investors,

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:42.000
and hopefully make folks hungrier for the Switch next year.

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:46.000
Do we want to sell 20 million of these?

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:47.000
Absolutely not.

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:52.000
We would rather sell these games for $5 a pop as downloads on our dedicated consoles.

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:55.000
But will this help us put up some holiday numbers?

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
These look really good.

01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:02.000
So now we're hearing rumors about a possible SNES classic mini for the holiday season next year.

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:05.000
Nintendo is always claiming that they're listening to customer feedback.

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:08.000
What does that mean for the new mini?

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:19.000
Probably that it will now say limited edition on the box to make sure we know from the outset that this is a special item made specifically for scalpers.

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:26.000
No other significant changes will be made, especially in terms of quality, quantity manufactured, mark my words.

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:30.000
Oh man, I hope I'm really wrong. I would love to get my hands on one of those things.

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:33.000
Pretending to place a pre-order right now, Aaron Yyr.

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
It's not the same market.

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:41.000
The people that, like, if they're saying, oh well, you know, if you want to play your classic games, you can play it on the virtual console.

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:50.000
The people that would have bought the NES mini aren't necessarily people that are even going to buy a Switch or Wii U or 3DS or whatever.

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
You're selling to a completely new market.

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:56.000
And they were making money off those because there's not enough in the hardware itself.

01:49:56.000 --> 01:50:01.000
There was, component wise, there wasn't that much to it.

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:04.000
It was just a chip running Linux.

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
That's it.

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:09.000
I mean, it doesn't make any sense.

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:14.000
If I was an investor, I'd be furious because it's money on the table that they're throwing away.

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:20.000
And yeah, the only thing that it really did for me is just enrage me as a consumer of Nintendo products.

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:25.000
It's just, this is the bullshit that they claim that they've gotten all this supply chain shit fixed.

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:29.000
And here's another fucking example of no, they don't know what the fuck they're doing.

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:38.000
I agree with you, Loki, on the sense that as a publicly traded company in Japan, I would be furious if I was an investor if they're leaving this on the table as well.

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:42.000
And especially when the reasons, I mean, do the investors know something we don't?

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
Like the real reason why they're walking away from this? I don't know.

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:49.000
But I can talk about this stuff and get huffy about it until I'm pink in the face.

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:56.000
But the reality is Nintendo, we're at the point where Nintendo just fucking does no wrong.

01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:00.000
We can sit here and go, what a bunch of fucking morons.

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:03.000
But time and time again, Switch sells 2 million.

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:06.000
They have all this freaking positive press out there.

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
So you know what? I'm done trying to speculate.

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:11.000
Because it's got Apple appeal. It's got Apple appeal.

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:14.000
It doesn't matter what Apple will do, people will fucking buy the price.

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
Nintendo, doesn't matter what they're going to do.

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:19.000
We're beyond that at this point.

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:22.000
I think we're away from those comparisons.

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:30.000
Because it's to a religious fanatic state that they've got so much hope that Nintendo's going to do the right thing.

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:34.000
Please show me some examples of how they're actually going to follow through this.

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:37.000
Because right now this system is only a couple months old.

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
We don't know what they're going to do.

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:44.000
The Mario game that they're promising for fourth quarter, who knows if that's coming out in fourth quarter?

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
It's a promise right now. We don't know shit.

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:53.000
The thing with Apple though, they have never walked away from a product at the height of its popularity that I can recall.

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:57.000
Exactly. They will sell that shit until it's just not moving off shelves.

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
That's where we're beyond this now.

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
Exactly. They get supply chain.

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:09.000
But Nintendo, which is weird because I'm assuming that they manufacture in China because everybody fucking manufactures in China.

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:17.000
How did they find the one part of China that can't fucking manufacture a tiny plastic box with a chip inside of it?

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:25.000
I don't know anymore. I'm going to wait until E3 to see what fucking the circus brings to town next.

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:31.000
That's all I can do at this point with Nintendo anymore. I'm going to wait until the circus comes to town for E3.

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:34.000
Do you agree Dark Soccer? Are you going to wait for the circus?

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:35.000
Nah.

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
Alright. Is that it for our emails tonight?

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:38.000
Yes.

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:41.000
Alright. Then we will move on to some more news.

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:46.000
But if you want to email us for a future week, participate at orangelaungeradio.com.

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:52.000
We will be opening up the Skype line for your calls at Orange Lounge Radio a little later on in the show.

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:55.000
But first, we do have some more news to get to. Loki.

01:52:55.000 --> 01:53:00.000
Did you know it's been 25 years since Night Trap was released?

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:06.000
I know that because they're releasing a Night Trap 25th anniversary edition that's going to be coming to PlayStation 4.

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:11.000
Way to make me feel old, Loki, as all these fucking anniversary stories do.

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:15.000
Like when Mario Brothers turned 30 and Zelda turned 30, I was like,

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000
Oh, what's that say about you, Rob Roberts?

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:22.000
But, yeah, I mean, cool that Night Trap is 25, I guess.

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:29.000
Now, I'm not sure if this is the same Night Trap remaster that was a Kickstarter, a really shitty Kickstarter.

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:33.000
This may be a whole different thing since it's actually going to be releasing in spring.

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
But it is coming. Soon.

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:38.000
And that's all we know about it. We don't know anything other than it's Night Trap.

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
I guess that's all you really need to know.

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
For most people, that's what they need to know.

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:48.000
I guess it's cool that it's getting a physical release on PlayStation 4, but I'm going to be that bitch for a minute.

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000
Why? Why?

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
This game is not that good.

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
It's not that good a game.

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
You had this as the classic game of the week like a month ago.

01:53:56.000 --> 01:54:00.000
We just recently were talking about Night Trap on this show.

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:04.000
Excuse me. Night Trap is not that good of a game.

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:09.000
You know, the thing that Night Trap did for us is that it gave us the ESRB.

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:12.000
Now, granted, Mortal Kombat helped with that, too.

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:17.000
But Night Trap was that game that Joe Lieberman had the copy of at the congressional hearings and so forth.

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
So the game industry created the ESRB.

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:24.000
Because why? Because there's women in it that are wearing tight shirts?

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000
Is that why you think of the children?

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:32.000
Well, maybe Jamie remembers this a little better, but I seem to remember some of the depictions of the killing of the girls with the real problem.

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:35.000
And by today's standards, it's really tame.

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:41.000
Well, isn't that... It's funny you bring that up because I heard that this game is rated T for Teen now.

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000
It's not even M game anymore.

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:48.000
But the version that I have is the pre-edited version.

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
Oh, so maybe there's some edits in here that are making...

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
There were edits.

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:59.000
Because after the advent of the ESRB, there was a re-release of it that was toned down some.

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:02.000
I guess Dungeon Buster in chat has a good point.

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:05.000
Why does Mad Dog McCree keep getting re-releases?

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000
I don't know. Because it's probably a cheap license is what it is.

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000
Fucking somebody's buying it, I guess.

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:15.000
The company Screaming Villains, who's actually developing the sequel though, or sequel remaster, I guess.

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:19.000
They have their website, which doesn't really have anything on there except for the trailer.

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:23.000
But it also does have a free copy of the Night Trap theme song.

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:28.000
Or a remaster of the theme song if you want to play that until it comes out.

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
So check it out.

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:35.000
Alright, well hooray for those of you guys that are super into Night Trap.

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:38.000
A question from chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
SSJ100Matt says,

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:44.000
Rob, was Sleepaway Camp good when it came out? I think it's just a cult classic.

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:47.000
Let's be clear, that movie was never good.

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:51.000
So yes, it's just a cult classic.

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:54.000
But are you trying to compare Night Trap to Sleepaway Camp?

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:57.000
I don't know if those two things can be compared.

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000
I would totally play a Sleepaway Camp game though.

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:03.000
Again, if you've never seen Sleepaway Camp, you owe it to yourself.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:09.000
Do not fucking read about it. Do not spoil the ending to Sleepaway Camp.

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:13.000
The ending is like such the cherry on top of...

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:16.000
Well, and by today's standards, it's problematic.

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:22.000
But remember, put your 1983 hat on and go watch Sleepaway Camp.

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:25.000
It's such a silly, stupid movie, but it is.

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:30.000
The ending though, it's just so ridiculous that it just made it...

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000
I remember watching that for the first time.

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:37.000
And we were just uncontrollably laughing at the end.

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000
Just like the last scene with the music and everything.

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000
We were just like...

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000
It was just so ridiculous.

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000
It's more random than anything.

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000
It is random.

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000
It's very random.

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:52.000
Anyway, JD in chat says,

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
I don't have a 1983 cap.

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000
Well, knit one.

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000
Dark Soccer.

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
You know what? I know Dark Soccer's twist this year

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:03.000
is she does once a month the classic system of the week.

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000
But I'm thinking next year, for 2018,

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:08.000
you might need to do the classic movie of the week,

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.000
of the month or something.

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.000
The first movie is Xanadu.

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
Xanadu.

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000
Classic 80s movie.

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
That was 1980 as well.

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
If you were smart in the way you planned it out,

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:23.000
you could still say Xanadu ties into video games

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000
because there's DDR,

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
there's the Don Bluth animation sequences,

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:31.000
which those games were a huge part of arcades in the early 80s, right?

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000
Dragon's Lair, Space Ace.

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000
So there's ways...

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:38.000
And where did you play a lot of video games in the early 80s?

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000
At the roller rink, right?

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
Mostly Frogger.

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:45.000
I still can't play Frogger if I'm not wearing roller skates.

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000
True.

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
Try playing Spy Hunter with roller skates

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000
because you have the acceleration pedal.

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.000
Oh my god.

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000
But anyway, my thought is,

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.000
I think we need to do like a movie

01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:00.000
and you're going to tangentially relate these movies to video games somehow.

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000
You could do it.

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000
I guess.

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
This movie came out in 1983,

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
which is also the year that Blink came out.

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
There. Tie-in.

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
And Kevin Bacon. The end.

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:15.000
I just committed all of us to a 16th year of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:18.000
Look at that. Check that out in 2018.

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
Girl, you can do the segment.

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
Alright.

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
Is that a challenge? Alright.

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000
Maybe a... Bitch, it might be.

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
Well, okay, wait.

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000
Not to get too tangential, but we're running a little

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000
early tonight, so I can do a few tangent.

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000
Tangent us? Never.

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000
What if, and what would the listeners think about this,

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.000
what if it was like a

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000
YouTube spin-off

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000
of OLR to do like a classic

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000
movie of the... Do I gotta...

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000
Yes.

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000
YouTube's where it's at now.

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000
Okay, but

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000
we have to have like snarky videos and bad animation.

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000
We can, we can probably have all of that.

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000
Okay. We could do a classic movie of the...

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
I could actually just finally sit down and learn iMovie.

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000
There you go. Now we're talking.

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.000
Okay, there you go.

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
See, some of the folks in chat are

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
SHO 100 Matt says yes, Dr. C says sure.

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
JD says, actually Rob

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
talking about movies would be a super interesting segment

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
since he knows his cult movies. Well, thank you.

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
Yeah, I know a thing or two about cult movies.

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
Maybe that should just be our thing.

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
Like, this is what we remember about these shitty

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000
movies.

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
Do I want to talk about this on air?

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000
Dot, dot, dot. Okay. Do it.

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000
Do it. So,

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
y'all know I am involved with Rocky Horror Picture

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
Show here in Sacramento, right? No.

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000
You guys know about that. And

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000
the guy who puts it on has a whole

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
organization of events that he does, and one of the

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000
things that he does is a thing called Sinister Creature Con.

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
So, last year,

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000
or no, two years ago, excuse me, at Sinister Creature Con,

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000
he let me moderate the panel.

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
It's one of the highlights of my life, really, that had

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
Patricia Quinn, Nell Campbell, and

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000
Barry Bostwick, who played Magenta, Columbia, and Brad

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
in the movie. I got to do that panel, so it was really cool.

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
Like, me and these, like, three legit

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000
movie stars, like, on the panel. It was awesome.

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000
And she was Magenta on stage.

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.000
She was, and she was Columbia on stage.

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
So,

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000
guess who one of his

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.000
big lands is

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000
for this October's

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000
Sinister Creature Con in Sacramento. Tim Curry.

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.000
No, God, I wish. It has nothing to do

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
with Rocky Horror, but everything to do with cult movies.

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.000
And video games, there's a reason I'm bringing this

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.000
up on OLR. What's his face from The Last

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000
Starfighter? No.

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
Uwe Boll is going to be there.

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
Oh my God.

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000
So, I'm thinking

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000
about, do I need to phone in a favor and

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
ask to do that panel?

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
Like, do I want to do that

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000
panel? Do I not want to do that panel? He's out of the movie

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.000
industry now for you. He is. He's doing

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000
something else now.

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.000
He is. Is it like a restaurant?

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000
I think he's doing something.

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000
How many explosions are in his restaurant?

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000
The reason why I bring that up is that if we do

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000
this whole YouTube thing,

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000
maybe, maybe we could get some

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000
interviews and talk to some of these cult people.

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000
So, that could be a something,

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000
something thing that comes up anyway.

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000
S.G.O. 100 Matt says, bring on a

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000
special guest like Travis. If I can get him out of the

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
retirement home, sure, I'd love to have him on.

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
Let's see,

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000
William Renovay says, there should be a whole episode

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000
of Rocky Horror. I could probably fill a

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000
whole episode of Rocky Horror. So,

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.000
there you go. We'll see.

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000
Anyway, I probably should have blurted that out on air

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.000
because that's still all under development, but it is

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
something I'm trying to,

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000
I'm trying to

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000
be a part of later this year.

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000
Because I think it would be fun

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
if nothing else. Right, Loki?

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000
It would be fun. I've already interviewed

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000
Uwe Boll once. For what?

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.000
It was for Tunnel Rats. It was a

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
movie that he's, it was

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000
kind of the reverse. He was making a movie that they're

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000
going to be making a game off of. So, we did a phone interview

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000
with him at my previous job.

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.000
He's alright. I don't know.

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000
We didn't learn too much from, I mean,

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000
Despite his reputation,

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000
I bet he's actually a pretty normal person.

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000
He's just a person.

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:52.000
I mean, whatever. He exploited,

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.000
he exploited German tax laws to make

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:56.000
movies and make money. Just like Adam Sandler

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.000
exploits whatever

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000
to, you know, make movies with his

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000
friends so his friends get a constant

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.000
check and he can go vacation with them.

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:06.000
Didn't they say those movies are like the most

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000
watched thing on Netflix right now? Yeah, they make a ton of money

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.000
and they, like, stealthily get onto Netflix

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.000
and it's funny, but... Who's fucking

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000
watching it? Knock it off. Ford people.

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.000
They're, you know what, I mean,

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000
honestly, though, like... More power to them, I guess.

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000
It's seriously, like, look at this guy.

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.000
I mean, he's supported his friends,

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000
like, his best friends. I mean, if, if I

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000
could get paid, in fact, we had talked

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000
about this, like, a long time ago, like, with,

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000
you know, Eric and stuff, like, if we

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.000
get paid, lots of money to make really

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000
shitty movies and just dumb movies that we

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000
find funny

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000
and just do that with our friends and get to go vacation

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
places and buy cars for ourselves,

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000
fuck yeah, why wouldn't

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.000
I do that? I would totally do that. So,

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000
Loki, I don't know if you've heard, but there's a website

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.000
out there called YouTube

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.000
and you can make

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000
dumb shit and put it on YouTube and

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.000
you put these ads in front of it

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000
and you make money. Yeah, but I haven't heard

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000
that they have, they don't put ads in front of

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000
controversial stuff now.

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000
Remember, YouTube's become quite, quite

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.000
the shit right now. That's, like, legit,

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000
like, fucking hate speech stuff. I don't

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000
think your movies would... No, it's everything

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000
because, you know, YouTube is

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000
run by a high, trained professional

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.000
team of computer

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.000
animated bots that don't actually, you know,

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000
have any sort of soul, they just basically go

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000
out there and go, yeah, I think this is this, but

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.000
we're, we're gonna, hopefully that's correct.

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000
The LGBT community had a huge problem

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000
with the whole, like, a bunch of LGBT,

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.000
like, coming out videos or being labeled restricted

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.000
as adult content and it, like,

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000
they're actually not, it's not, they're

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.000
not talking about anything adult. They're

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.000
talking about experiences that

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000
sometimes help other people and so forth.

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000
Advertisers, they don't like that.

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000
Anyway, alright.

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000
Alright, we've gone down too many tangents.

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
It's time to pull the train back into the

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000
station and talk about, hey, something else

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000
that you might be streaming on YouTube or

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.000
on Twitch or one of those. Persona 5,

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:54.000
remember, there was some, there were some

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000
pretty strict guidelines that came out for Persona 5.

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000
Well, shock and... Unenforceable guidelines.

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.000
Shock and awe. Atlas

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000
has revised those guidelines.

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000
That's right. The guidelines

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000
have been, let's see,

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.000
changed a little bit. The new

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.000
guideline is that you can do video up to

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000
the in-game date of

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000
11-19. That's

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000
before the game gears up for the final act.

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.000
Now, they also,

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000
as a part of this, I'm gonna read this verbatim here,

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000
we also want to apologize to those of you

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
who saw the previous guidelines blog post

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000
as threatening. We wanted to be transparent

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.000
about what we do, and the reason we

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000
released the guidelines was to give streamers the

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.000
right information up front. It was never

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000
our intention to threaten people with copyright

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.000
strikes, but we clearly chose the wrong

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000
tone for how to communicate this.

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000
Because you said you threatened them with a copyright

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000
strike. Yeah. Because you literally

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.000
did that. It wasn't the tone, it was

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000
you literally came out and said, if you do this,

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:48.000
we're gonna strike your channel. Now, the

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.000
interesting thing is, they haven't said they're not

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.000
gonna do that, but at the same time, have we

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000
heard of anybody actually getting copyright strikes

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000
from this? Because, I have a friend

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000
who put his entire playthrough of the game

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000
on YouTube in like 53 segments or something

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000
like that, haven't heard if there's been any

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.000
problems yet. I mean, granted, he's not a

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.000
huge streamer, so,

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:08.000
but still. I get it, you don't want your

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.000
game story ruined, but

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.000
you have no control over that.

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.000
You don't. You can't.

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000
You can't say it's okay to put part of the

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000
game on there. I don't think it's even

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.000
enforceable the way you can do that. Especially

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:22.000
if they're commenting over it and there's like actual

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.000
transformative work being done

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.000
to it, you can't do it.

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.000
I do think, I

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000
realize this is a complicated issue, it's not

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000
easily gonna be solved. I do think

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.000
there should be revenue sharing

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:36.000
available. I do think that

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000
Atlus should be able to share

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000
in what, especially,

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:42.000
especially when there is no

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.000
commentary or nothing else going on, Atlus

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000
does deserve it. When there's

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.000
commentary and stuff, I do believe

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000
Atlus, as they've made the game, they should

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.000
be entitled to some of the revenue,

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.000
but I don't think they should get to dictate

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.000
oh, you do this, but not that.

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:58.000
They already get some of the revenue when I purchase

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000
their fucking game. No, seriously,

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000
they're not entitled to any of that, and you know

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.000
why? Because Nintendo does this shit.

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.000
Nintendo

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
monetizes every single

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:10.000
video out there, unless

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000
you just, you know,

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.000
join up in their

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000
special club where they get most of the

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
profits anyways. That's still a thing?

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000
That's still a thing. Oh, I didn't know. So, I mean,

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
I'm sorry, we've already seen how back ass

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000
words that shit is. I do not want more companies

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.000
jumping on board with that.

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.000
Alright, we need to get on to some more stories. We

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000
will be taking your calls at Orange Lounge

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.000
Radio on Skype in a little while, but first,

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:34.000
Dark Sakura,

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.000
with something a little different. Yes.

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.000
Well, um, this

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.000
has been, uh, you know,

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.000
Call of Duty isn't necessarily, like, my

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000
favorite ever game,

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.000
but they're doing a World War

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:48.000
2 campaign that,

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.000
um, has a multiplayer mode that lets you

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:52.000
play as, uh, female combatants.

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:54.000
And, um,

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.000
it's funny, because

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:58.000
I've seen some people

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:00.000
get kind of fussy about it, like, they'll

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:02.000
like, we were actually commenting on

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.000
before the show, there'll be people who

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:06.000
are cool with having, you know,

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:08.000
Nazi zombies, but

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:10.000
get all fussy about women

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:12.000
in combat. But even

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:14.000
back then, I mean, now the

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:16.000
US was definitely a lot more stuffy about

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.000
it, but, um, there were

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000
women combatants in World War

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.000
2. There were, uh,

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000
in fact, a very famous, uh, group

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000
of, uh, Russian snipers,

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:28.000
um, who,

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:30.000
uh, were, uh,

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.000
actually had some of the highest

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.000
kill counts of any of, uh,

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:36.000
of the combatants. There, uh,

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.000
were also, uh, people in the

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.000
Air Force. There are plenty of

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.000
American women were, uh, also involved

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:44.000
in, uh,

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.000
uh, aircraft, in, um,

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:48.000
transport. A good number

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:50.000
of Canadian, too. We had,

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:52.000
um, medical, uh, sorry, transport vehicle

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.000
drivers, um, and not

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:56.000
just in, you know,

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:58.000
working in, like, you know,

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:00.000
canteens or as a cook

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:02.000
or as a, you know, clerk, but,

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.000
uh, women who,

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.000
uh, were

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000
very, very important to the whole,

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.000
uh, war effort

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.000
in World War 2, just all over the world.

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.000
So, um,

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:16.000
I think it's not too far-fetched

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.000
to have, um,

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.000
female

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.000
combatants in a World War

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:24.000
2 era game, so.

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000
Why not? Sure. I mean, I think this is,

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:28.000
you know, as much as we've made

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:30.000
a lot of strides in the past ten years

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.000
to try to bring more

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:34.000
representation in games,

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:36.000
I mean, Call of Duty definitely

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:38.000
has that label as a brotastic

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:40.000
type of video game,

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.000
so I think that's really cool that

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000
they're bringing in, you know, a way

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:46.000
for more women to get into Call of Duty by

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:48.000
playing something that can represent themselves a little more.

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:50.000
Did you know that even Queen Elizabeth II

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:52.000
was, um, uh, enlisted

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:54.000
in 1945? That doesn't surprise

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.000
me, considering her family is kinda

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:58.000
always, like, I know, like, William and

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:00.000
and Harry were in the military

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:02.000
and all that, so, you know, that family kinda has a

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.000
military history to them, so. And see,

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.000
what I would like to see is if

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.000
they were gonna do, like, a World War 2 era

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.000
game, I would wanna do something

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.000
where someone fights as, like, a resistance member.

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000
You would be very proud of our chatters

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:16.000
right now, by the way, because, like, they are saying things

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.000
like, Justice, you're about to say them, Lady JJ

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.000
just pointed out the Queen Elizabeth II thing,

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:22.000
uh, S.G.O. and Hunter Matt

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.000
talked about the Russian snipers thing,

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000
and so it's, it's funny that, like, they're

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:28.000
naming stuff right, you'd be very proud of her. Hey, Lady

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:30.000
JJ, I'm glad you can make it in.

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.000
You'd be very proud of our listeners tonight.

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:34.000
But, um, I mean,

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.000
and even, there were, uh,

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.000
of course, I learned a lot more, you know,

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:40.000
studying, uh, the effects of

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.000
the Holocaust, there was, um,

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:44.000
a Jewish resistance leader named Hannah

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:46.000
Senesch, who, um,

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.000
uh, she

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.000
airdropped several times into Germany

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.000
to spread, uh, propaganda

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.000
and to help the resistance

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:56.000
and ended up being tortured and murdered

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:58.000
by the Nazis. You know, plenty

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:00.000
of, of women who, you know,

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.000
I know there's a lot of women involved, it's about

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.000
planes, like, usually, like, the flights and the planes

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.000
stuff, like, a lot of women got involved in that.

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000
Or even, um, performers, there were plenty

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.000
of performers who would, you know, pass

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:12.000
notes and, and get information

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:14.000
from people, but the whole

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.000
thing is, is that, don't just

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.000
look at a historical war

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000
through a patriarchal lens.

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:22.000
I mean, and I'm not meaning to use,

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:24.000
like, buzz feminist words, you know,

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:26.000
whatever. It's truly

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:28.000
clouded by

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.000
a lot of male-centric discussion.

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.000
Don't discount that women played their part

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:34.000
in war, or that we still

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:36.000
play a part in war. What is it, like, six years ago,

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:38.000
um, the Air Force passed, uh,

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.000
uh, their first female sniper

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.000
through their Sniper Academy.

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.000
Um, it's

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.000
just, don't discount it, you know.

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000
If you say, oh, well, so

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:50.000
and so was never in the war, there were

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.000
women who fought in

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.000
the American Civil War, on both sides,

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:56.000
who would,

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
in some cases, quite literally, cross-dressed

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000
to be in the army, or be in

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000
whichever militia. It's been going

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000
on for years. There's even, like, French

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.000
nobles who, um,

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.000
were absolutely famous

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.000
for, uh, women who

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:12.000
adopted men's dress. Well, and Mulan.

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:14.000
I couldn't, I'm sorry, I couldn't help it.

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000
I'm sorry. Well, even, even

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000
Joan of Arc. Yeah, sure, of course. She

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.000
was burned, not just for, you know,

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000
being, uh, in resistance

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.000
to, uh, England's armies, but

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000
she was actually more burned

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:28.000
as a heretic for refusing to wear women's clothing.

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.000
Because she was female.

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000
So, I'm just saying,

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.000
if you have an argument about

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.000
a game because of some preconceived notion,

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000
actually take some time and study the fucking history.

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.000
The end.

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:42.000
Okay. This week on

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.000
Jamie Takes On Video Games.

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:46.000
I'm a, I'm a big history

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:48.000
nerd, too. I do not disagree

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:50.000
with what you're saying, and I think it's really cool that

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:52.000
the video games are, like, reflecting, you know,

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.000
the more diversities of, of, of

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.000
how World War II affected

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:58.000
everybody. You know what I mean?

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:00.000
Exactly. I mean, it was a world

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.000
war for a reason. And, you know,

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:04.000
history is kind of repeating itself, so

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.000
keep your eyes open.

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.000
Alright.

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.000
Uh, let's move on. Uh, just a few more

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.000
stories for you guys, and then the Skype line. But first,

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.000
If I may say. Oh, yeah. SSG100 Matt

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.000
said, thankfully, our listener group doesn't think that way.

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:18.000
And, yes, bless you all.

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:20.000
I love you all.

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.000
Doesn't think in the terms of.

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.000
There might be somebody new to the show who might

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.000
be like, oh, I didn't think about it that way before.

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:28.000
Well, then, good. I hope to open

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:30.000
some eyes. Exactly. That's all, that's

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.000
all it is. Just think, think a little different.

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:34.000
Bend over and take it.

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:36.000
I'm kidding. Jamie.

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:38.000
Oh, come on. You know it's me. Alright.

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:40.000
Moving on. A few more stories for you guys.

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000
Loki. So, um,

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000
not too long ago, um,

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:46.000
GTA V, you know,

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:48.000
this whole, um, stunt

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.000
racing and stuff

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:52.000
that they kind of added to the game that

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:54.000
really, I thought, made the racing really

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:56.000
better, you know, with all these loops and

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000
ramps and crazy shit.

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.000
So, it's only appropriate that Forza

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.000
Horizon 3 has Hot Wheel DLC

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000
coming with all the fucking loops and

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.000
shit they would find in the orange

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000
track to bear. And it looks

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000
fantastic. I mean, it

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000
just looks seriously

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000
cool from the trailer that I saw.

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000
You like this kind of over-the-top

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.000
shit though. I know, I'm all

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.000
on board for this too. Yeah, it looks great.

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000
I mean, the game, I mean, itself was

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000
pretty good, but now it's... You know what it

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.000
reminds me of? Hard Drivin'.

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.000
You remember that game? Yeah, right.

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.000
I used to take a nap in that.

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:32.000
It was a giant cabinet, right?

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.000
And it was like the, the early

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.000
days of, and I'm using my quotey fingers,

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.000
virtual reality type games. Yeah, like

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.000
was it Test Drive 3?

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.000
Polygons, yeah. But like,

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:44.000
Hard Drivin' was like that first game where you had like

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.000
the ramp and you had like a loop

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:48.000
and all this crazy shit. And now

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:50.000
it's like, oh, that, it's like

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:52.000
making that on hardware

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000
in 2017. Pretty cool.

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.000
It looks cool though. Seriously, it's gonna be 20 bucks.

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000
The expansion by itself

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.000
is $20. Or if you bought the

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000
games expansion pass, which

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:04.000
is $35, you get that for free as

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:06.000
well. It's coming out May

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000
9th on

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000
Xbox One. I'm assuming PC since

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.000
it's a Windows 10 game. Yes.

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000
But yeah, definitely check that out.

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.000
It looks really cool.

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000
Alright, well one more story

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
for you guys before we open up the Skype line and

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
that has to do with, hey

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.000
guess what? Sometimes people

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000
online who, you know, when they do, we

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
hear about these websites getting

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000
hit with DDoS attacks and stuff,

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.000
we're wondering, when are some of these people gonna

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.000
go to jail for breaking the

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:36.000
law? And guess what?

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.000
Somebody's finally going to jail for

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000
some of this shit. So it

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.000
was the Central Criminal Court of England

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000
in Wales who found

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.000
20 year old Adam Mudd

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.000
guilty of creating a

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:50.000
malware program that did

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.000
distributed denial of service or DDoS

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.000
attacks on computer network.

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000
Apparently it has caused 1.7

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.000
million cyber attacks since

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.000
2013. The malware

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.000
was sold under a pseudonym and

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.000
apparently made $400,000 from

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000
112,000 registered

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000
users. Let's see, apparently

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.000
there's gaming companies that have been

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.000
attacked like Xbox Live,

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000
Minecraft, and the MMORPG

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000
RuneScape. The

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.000
DDoS would overload the company's networks

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000
with too much data and that would interrupt the

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.000
connection to the internet and then they're

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000
unable to process the user request. And I think we

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000
all remember when Xbox Live and I think PlayStation

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000
Network got shut, I'm not saying that

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.000
that is the same program that shut these

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.000
things down, but we all

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.000
remember when that happened on, like on

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000
Christmas, right? Didn't PlayStation Network go down

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000
on Christmas? It was really fucking rude,

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000
whatever it was they did. So, there we go.

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000
The judge

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000
wanted to make this sentence a

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
strong deterrent to future

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000
cyber criminals and sentence Mudd

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.000
to two years of jail and that will

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000
be served in a young offenders institution

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000
because I guess 20 is still a young offender

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.000
over there. Whereas

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.000
here, that would, you'd be

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.000
in, you'd be in, you'd be in

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:02.000
regular, you'd be in prison

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:04.000
Orange is the new black style.

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:06.000
No juvie hall over 18

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:08.000
so, but I guess it's a little

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:10.000
different over there, so.

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:12.000
There you go, somebody finally going to jail for DDoSing

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000
so, there you go.

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.000
Alright, wasn't that a prediction

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:18.000
on a, not this year, probably last year,

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:20.000
but I think I said one of them would get the death penalty.

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.000
I think that was 2016. I think that's a bit much.

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:24.000
Just chop off their fingers.

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000
I still could have gotten a half point.

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.000
Alright, hey

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.000
guess what guys, Skype line is open.

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:32.000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:34.000
and if you want to do it the old fashioned way, 1-877-GAME-OLR

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000
and guess what, our phone

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:38.000
is ringing, but we will catch up with

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000
Loki on some last minute stories in a moment.

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000
But first, hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:44.000
Hey, what's going on, it's Ranma.

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:46.000
Hey Ranma, how you doing?

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:48.000
Pretty good, I just got in from another convention

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.000
about a good hour and a half ago.

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
I know, I saw the picture, you were hanging out

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.000
with your posse from Anime Jam

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:56.000
Session and I saw John from Critical Myth in those pictures

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:58.000
so, you guys had a good

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.000
good old time, hello hello, and I hope you had fun.

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000
It was so much fun

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000
that I would say this, next

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.000
year, y'all gotta come out for this

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:08.000
convention, that's how much fun, how much

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.000
how great it is. Which con is it?

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:12.000
Zenkai Con, it's right in Lancaster

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000
County. I've heard of that before.

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.000
But you know,

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000
realistically, I don't know if it

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.000
would be in the budget for me to do another East Coast

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:22.000
con, I'd have to choose between that

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.000
and Magfest and, well,

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000
hate to break it to you buddy, but, you know

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.000
Magfest's gonna win that one. You're coming with me to

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.000
DragCon next year anyway.

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000
That's true.

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000
It sucks, when I switched jobs

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000
I lost 10 days of work

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.000
off a year, I went from 25 days off to

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000
15, so it's like I really have to pick and choose my

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000
cons now.

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:44.000
Well, we could always do this.

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.000
You could always do Magfest, you could

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000
crash at Michael John's place until

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:50.000
the con, you just work remotely.

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:52.000
If I wasn't a corporate

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:54.000
trainer who needed to be in a classroom all day

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.000
I would consider that.

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:58.000
Video technology my friend!

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:00.000
I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what, when I'm a

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:02.000
famous YouTuber,

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000
I'll go to all the cons.

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.000
When I can quit my job and be a famous YouTuber.

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:08.000
Sounds like a plan.

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:10.000
Sounds like a plan my friend.

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:12.000
Well no, I'm really glad you had a good time at the con though.

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:14.000
Was there any type of gaming stuff at the con, or was it mostly

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.000
anime?

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:18.000
It was a mix of everything, and what I'm starting to

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.000
see now, Bemani is

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:22.000
coming back.

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:24.000
I don't know if you were here at the beginning of the show,

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:26.000
but somebody made a comment at the beginning of the show,

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:28.000
and I kind of mentioned that I kind of felt

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.000
DDR was going through a renaissance,

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:32.000
but I really should have clarified that saying

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:34.000
Bemani is going through a renaissance, because

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:36.000
definitely things like Ubeat

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:38.000
is like at conventions, there's always a

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:40.000
fucking line to play Ubeat, whether it's

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.000
Dragon Con or Magfest or wherever I'm at

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:44.000
that has those machines, and then

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:46.000
SoundVoltex is doing very well it seems as well,

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:48.000
so it really isn't

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:50.000
just DDR, but that's just kind of

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:52.000
the grandpa of those games.

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:54.000
True, true, true.

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:56.000
So, but those games

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000
having a great presence at Zenkai Con

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:00.000
it sounds like?

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.000
A small presence because the gaming room

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000
wasn't that big, but what I'm seeing in general

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.000
over the last year and a half,

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:08.000
big or small,

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:10.000
the dance rhythm games are coming back pretty strong.

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:12.000
Oh, that's great.

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:14.000
I know

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:16.000
speaking of all the dance game stuff,

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:18.000
you guys probably know Kyle Ward

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:20.000
who was on this show, oh god

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:22.000
it was probably a couple years ago at this point, but

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:24.000
you know, at the time we were talking about some of the

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:26.000
stuff he's been doing with the cell phone games, well now

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:28.000
I'm seeing a lot of activity now with his

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:30.000
what did they end up calling the machine?

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:32.000
It's like Step Maniacs, right?

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:34.000
That's the name of it. It's like Step Mania

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.000
but with an X. So, like, and it seems

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.000
like this is, you know, a lot of people are

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:40.000
really, really anticipating this game,

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:42.000
this Step Maniacs game, and

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:44.000
you know, I remember playing it at Magfest

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:46.000
and it really looks like it's coming together, and I love the idea

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.000
of the main screen being a touch screen.

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:50.000
And then there's not just that,

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:52.000
but fucking, did you, I didn't even know this was out

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:54.000
on iPhones now,

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:56.000
but Neon FM

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:58.000
is fucking out on hand-helds

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.000
and it syncs up with

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:02.000
the arcade versions.

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:04.000
I didn't know that was a thing now.

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.000
I remember talking about

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:08.000
Neon FM fucking like 2005,

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:10.000
like in the early days of OLR.

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.000
This is crazy.

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.000
But in a good way.

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:16.000
Sure enough.

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:18.000
Rob, you want to know something?

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:20.000
That's not why I called in.

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:22.000
Oh, that's alright. Well, why did you call in?

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:24.000
I wanted to talk to you about

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.000
your thoughts. I heard what you

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:28.000
had to say about Project Scorpio,

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:30.000
and you know what? I hear what

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:32.000
you're saying. I get it.

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.000
It's like

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
when you have a basic PC to do

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000
stuff, and then

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:40.000
you got the basic PC to do stuff, play games,

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:42.000
do all this stuff, and you're happy. You got

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.000
the Uber PC that does everything

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:46.000
and much, much more.

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.000
The PS4 Pro, Project Scorpio,

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:50.000
I don't want to

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:52.000
use the word lazy,

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.000
but I'm going to use the word lazy.

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:56.000
It's a lazy way

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:58.000
of getting a high-end

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:00.000
gaming PC

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:02.000
or gaming console.

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:04.000
It's like

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:06.000
I just think these two

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:08.000
consoles are a way to fight back at the

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:10.000
quote-unquote master race of PC

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:12.000
gaming.

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:14.000
I sort of get that.

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:16.000
I think it's for people who

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:18.000
don't necessarily have an Uber-end PC,

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:20.000
but again, I'm not

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:22.000
saying that like, oh, I'm not getting

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:24.000
one, and my mind's made up. I'm

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:26.000
waiting to hear that out of E3, but

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:28.000
that's really what I'm saying is that

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:30.000
Microsoft needs to convince me at

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:32.000
E3, or if not me, if

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.000
what you're saying is really the

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:36.000
case where it's like, no, this system is not for me. It's for

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:38.000
these other people. Okay, then really, what is that

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.000
compelling case why people

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:42.000
need to spend the extra money on this

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:44.000
system?

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:46.000
What are the games going to be like?

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:48.000
What's Scorpio going to lend itself to with that?

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:50.000
What are those experiences going to be

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:52.000
that makes it a little worth it?

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:54.000
Because in some regards, I think Sony

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:56.000
has kind of peed in the pool

02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:58.000
a little bit, because I don't

02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:00.000
think the PlayStation 4 Pro

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:02.000
has really pushed things

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:04.000
forward immensely

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:06.000
in that regard, and now that's kind of what's

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:08.000
stuck in our heads, and I realize

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:10.000
Microsoft had nothing to do with that,

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:12.000
but I can't help but feel like

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:14.000
PlayStation has kind of

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:16.000
already kind of screwed it

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:18.000
up, if that makes sense?

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:20.000
It does. I kind of see it this way.

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:22.000
I mean, look at the specs between both consoles.

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:24.000
I mean, I kind of feel

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:26.000
that Sony is kind of banking

02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:28.000
on the name PlayStation

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:30.000
to push the Pro, whereas

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:32.000
not everybody knows the Microsoft

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:34.000
brand per se. They know it, but it's like

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:36.000
gaming, nine times out of ten, especially

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:38.000
in the circles I roll with, more people

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:40.000
are more apt to go towards the PS4

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:42.000
because of the games, even though

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:44.000
the Xbox has the hardware

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:46.000
processing power. Now,

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:48.000
with Scorpio comes out, if the

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:50.000
price is right, and they can get

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:52.000
these companies behind

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:54.000
them with all these amazing games,

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:56.000
then we're going to be good. Now,

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:58.000
if they start doing exclusive

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:00.000
PS4 Pro and Scorpio

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:02.000
games, that's where we're going to

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:04.000
have a problem. But they need

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:06.000
to keep it at, keep the game

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:08.000
optimized for PS4

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:10.000
so that way you can play it on either

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:12.000
or. You can see the power

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:14.000
and graphical difference between both of those consoles

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:16.000
as if they're the Xbox One.

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:18.000
And I will say this now, and I'm not

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:20.000
saying this as an Xbox

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:22.000
fanboy, but you

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:24.000
get that one game

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:26.000
for both

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:28.000
consoles. And you

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:30.000
optimize it for their Pro systems.

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:32.000
I hate to break it to you, but it's

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000
going on Scorpio, it's going to

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:36.000
blow it out of the water compared to the PS4

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:38.000
only because of the hardware that's

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:40.000
underneath it. Well, I have to ask this

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:42.000
because you made me think about something I've been

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:44.000
reading a lot about today. And again,

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:46.000
it's in the rumor camp very

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:48.000
firmly, but there's rumors

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:50.000
out there that PlayStation 5

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:52.000
is going to be 2018,

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:54.000
which seems

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:56.000
really early, but then

02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:58.000
the way this kind of broke it down

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:00.000
is that there were six years

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:02.000
between PS1 and 2, six years

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:04.000
between 2 and 3, seven years

02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:06.000
between 3 and 4,

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:08.000
but three needed time to

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:10.000
kind of catch on,

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:12.000
right? Three needed the extra year to catch up.

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:14.000
And then

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:16.000
this will be five years

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:18.000
if it comes out in 2018.

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:20.000
So it's not that far

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:22.000
off, but I can't help but feel

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:24.000
like that seems fast. I still think it's

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:26.000
pretty early into the consoles.

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:28.000
Well, let me tell you.

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:30.000
If they do announce

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:32.000
a PS5 between now

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:34.000
and December 2018,

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:36.000
I'll say it.

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.000
Sony's lost. They're playing a catch-up

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:40.000
game. They're starting to realize

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:42.000
we may have fucked up with the 4,

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:44.000
so we gotta catch up.

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:46.000
There is no reason to release a newer

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:48.000
console at that time.

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:50.000
You know? The most

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:52.000
they could probably do is up the processor

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:54.000
and up the graphics chip.

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:56.000
And at that point,

02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:58.000
the games will probably look still wanting

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:00.000
to say. I'm not sure I

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:02.000
totally agree with you on that,

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:04.000
because Sony is

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:06.000
still selling very well. I don't think

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:08.000
there's really an oh shit moment, but I think

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:10.000
if there's anything oh shit in this,

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:12.000
it's that, oh,

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:14.000
Microsoft is gonna whip out the

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:16.000
teraflops with Scorpio,

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:18.000
so we need to put out PlayStation

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:20.000
5 to basically match Scorpio.

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:22.000
And if they do that, what

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:24.000
was the point of the PS4 Pro in the

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:26.000
first place?

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:28.000
And that's where I agree

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:30.000
with you. Yeah. In that case,

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:32.000
if that's what they're going to do, the original

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:34.000
PS4 is gonna get phased out, and they're

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:36.000
gonna relabel the Pro as the 4.

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:38.000
Remember, I mean,

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:40.000
if you look at what Sony has done with

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:42.000
their hardware, I mean, it

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:44.000
wouldn't surprise me if they do this.

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:48.000
I mean, we'll see. Again,

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:50.000
it's a little tinfoil

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:52.000
to fetish this PlayStation 5 stuff.

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:54.000
I still feel like there's a long life left

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:56.000
for PlayStation 4, especially if

02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:58.000
5 is backwards compatible

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:00.000
with PlayStation 4, and that's the other way

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:02.000
I could see them doing it, is if

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:04.000
4 is 100% backwards compatible

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:06.000
with 5, so 5 is

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:08.000
really the Pro Pro,

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:10.000
the Pro Plus. What's

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:12.000
gonna end up happening is the Pro is gonna be a wash.

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:14.000
Or, what Rahm is saying is that

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:16.000
Pro is now the 4, and

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:18.000
that just kind of will happen

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:20.000
quietly. But,

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:22.000
the only real advantages are the 4K

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:24.000
things that, again, I think are really

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:26.000
subtle, but anyway,

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:28.000
I think we're getting ahead of ourselves.

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:30.000
I mean, we're trying to forecast 2018,

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:32.000
and we haven't even hit 2017's

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:34.000
E3 yet to really

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:36.000
truly know what Scorpio is.

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:38.000
Yeah, and

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:40.000
speaking of E3, yeah, go on.

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:42.000
No, go ahead.

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:44.000
I was gonna say, speaking of E3 2017,

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:46.000
is it wrong of me

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:48.000
to be smirky at some of my

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:50.000
friends who are excited about going to E3

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:52.000
for the very first time?

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:54.000
Eh, don't shit on their parade.

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:56.000
I don't say it, I just keep it to myself

02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:58.000
because I know people who are going to

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:00.000
a con I'm going to, and then they're flying

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:02.000
out for E3, and I'm just like,

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:04.000
well, I guess

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:06.000
you'll have to discover how it really

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:08.000
is, you know? Because I just go back from

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:10.000
O-L-R

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:12.000
and we all tell me about E3, and I'm

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:14.000
just like, you know what?

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:16.000
There's no reason for me to go.

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:18.000
To be fair, the ESA

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:20.000
knows they've opened it up to the public

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:22.000
essentially this year. I think the show

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:24.000
will look different from the same

02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:26.000
show that Dark Soccer, myself, and Loki

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:28.000
have attended in the past, and for

02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:30.000
those reasons, those people may have

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:32.000
a very different experience than what

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:34.000
our experience has been with E3.

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:36.000
Only time will tell.

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:38.000
True, true that.

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:40.000
Alright, well,

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:42.000
Rama, I'm gonna let you go to try to squeeze in another call or two,

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:44.000
and we're gonna wrap up, but thanks so much for your call, buddy. I appreciate it.

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:46.000
Ain't no problem, dude. Alright, later.

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:48.000
Later. Alright,

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:50.000
Orange Launch Radio, all one word on Skype,

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:52.000
if you want to give us a call. Meanwhile,

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:54.000
Loki, did you have any last minute stories you want to get out there?

02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:56.000
Or Dark Soccer, if you have anything. Yeah, I was gonna mention that

02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:58.000
the PlayStation 4 has hit

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:00.000
60 million units sold.

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:02.000
That was 20

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:04.000
million of which were last year.

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:06.000
Also, the PlayStation 3 is

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:08.000
closing in on 80 million

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:10.000
sold. That means

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:12.000
4 is probably gonna sell more in its lifeline

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:14.000
than the 3 did. Yeah.

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:16.000
When all is said and done, because keep in mind,

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:18.000
even if they do announce the PlayStation

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:20.000
5 in 2018, that's still another

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:22.000
like, two

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:24.000
years of PS4 sales,

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:26.000
and it's still, they're still, still, still

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:28.000
sell 4's as a quote-unquote

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:30.000
budget con, I can't believe I'm talking this far ahead,

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:32.000
but this is what happens, they'll still sell the 4's

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:34.000
as a quote-unquote budget console for a good

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:36.000
first two years of the 5's life.

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:38.000
Yeah, so it'll be nice when PlayStation

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:40.000
5 comes out and my fucking PlayStation

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:42.000
VR doesn't work with it.

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:44.000
Well, hold on, hold on.

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:46.000
We don't know anything about that yet.

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:48.000
Alright, last chance to get in you guys, Orange

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:50.000
Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:52.000
if you want to call it. It had a nice run all one of

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:54.000
two years, one or two years, not

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:56.000
even this point. Will's

02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:58.000
E3, E3's coming, you don't know

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:00.000
what they're gonna announce. We never got that Final Fantasy

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:02.000
XV experience yet on VR.

02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:04.000
It feels like there's things coming. Still haven't finished

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:06.000
that game either. I need to do the

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:08.000
Radio DLC, I still haven't got around to it.

02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:10.000
And I still haven't played the result either.

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:12.000
Time to get

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:14.000
caught up. Alright.

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:16.000
Anything other, any other last minute stories

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:18.000
you want to mention, Logie? That's it.

02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:20.000
I have an announcement.

02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:22.000
Yes? I want pie.

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:24.000
Oh, that's a great announcement, thank you Dark Slacker.

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:26.000
That's a great announcement. I think that I should have

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:28.000
pie. If pie is what you want,

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:30.000
pie is what you should get. You should get a pie shake.

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:32.000
There's a

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:34.000
cafe near my work that makes pie

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:36.000
shakes. Pie shakes. That's what they do, they

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:38.000
blend up a piece of pie, make it as a shake.

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:40.000
Does my pie shake bring all the boys

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:42.000
to the... No, they need to get out of my yard

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:44.000
unless they're gonna do the yard work.

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:46.000
Alright.

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:48.000
Well, it's being quiet on our phone lines, so I guess

02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:50.000
that is going to be it. So we're gonna

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:52.000
shut it down on the Skype line.

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:54.000
If you want to send

02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:56.000
us your thoughts after the show, participate

02:29:56.000 --> 02:29:58.000
at orangelandrader.com or you can always

02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:00.000
tweet us as well, twitter.com

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:02.000
slash o-l-r. But that is gonna wrap us

02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:04.000
up for another night here at Orange Lounge Radio.

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:06.000
But we couldn't say good night

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:08.000
until I plug quickly

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:10.000
nice reviews on iTunes

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:12.000
just like I did earlier, so I'll make it quick.

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:14.000
A nice five star review goes a long way.

02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:16.000
You know, if you liked what you heard here at OLR,

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:18.000
we don't take your money for doing the show.

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:20.000
Just help us spread the word. Word of mouth is a great thing.

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:22.000
We had some new people tuning in tonight

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:24.000
thanks to our interview. So thanks to Zircon

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:26.000
for being here, first and foremost.

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:28.000
And thanks to those of you guys that stopped and checked out

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:30.000
OLR, thanks to that. Or just because

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:32.000
maybe when you saw the tweets at OC

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:34.000
Remix or something, you were like, that show's still fucking

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:36.000
on and you checked us out.

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:38.000
Once

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:40.000
every other month or so, I get a tweet that's

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:42.000
like, you guys are still going.

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:44.000
Yeah, yeah, we're here. So anyway,

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:46.000
thank you, whether it's your first show or your

02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:48.000
600th show, we appreciate it all the

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:50.000
same. Thanks for being here.

02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:52.000
We gotta go around and get everybody's final

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:54.000
thought for the night. I'll

02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:56.000
start and I'll just say

02:30:56.000 --> 02:30:58.000
I am ready to be 100% done with

02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:00.000
this sickness because although I do feel a lot better,

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:02.000
certainly better than I did last Sunday,

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:04.000
I would still say I'm only like 96%.

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:06.000
I want to be 100% over this

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:08.000
damn cold. Done.

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:10.000
And I don't like the pills I take because they make my head feel like

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:12.000
it's on fire.

02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:14.000
I don't like feeling like I'm on fire.

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:16.000
DarkSocker, your final thought for the night.

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:18.000
I hate allergies. Hate,

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:20.000
hate, hate, hate.

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:22.000
With every fiber of

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:24.000
my being.

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:26.000
But, on the

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:28.000
plus side.

02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:30.000
No, there's no plus side to it.

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:32.000
I hate it.

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:34.000
Alright, and last but not least,

02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:36.000
Loki, your final thought. My final

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:38.000
thought is that

02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:40.000
I was gonna 3D print something

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:42.000
larger, like

02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:44.000
they have this switch holder thing that you can get.

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:46.000
You can plug in the two switch halves into it.

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:48.000
That's a little bit different. I was gonna print that for you,

02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:50.000
but it didn't want to slice it today,

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:52.000
so I couldn't even

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:54.000
try to print it. Is that printer working well for you though?

02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:56.000
It's working okay.

02:31:56.000 --> 02:31:58.000
I've already broken

02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:00.000
the hotbed on it because I tore

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:02.000
up a piece of the cover that was on there,

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:04.000
so I need to put something else on it right now.

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:06.000
I've taped over it, but

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:08.000
I was in the process of

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:10.000
putting a part cooling fan

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:12.000
on there, so I finally printed the shroud for it,

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:14.000
so I just have to wire that up and then

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:16.000
get the auto-leveling

02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:18.000
working. I have to reflash

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:20.000
the firmware and stuff.

02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:22.000
I just haven't gotten around to it

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:24.000
because I had been playing with that printer for about

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:26.000
four of the five days

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:28.000
during the week, and I was like, okay, I've got to take a break from it.

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:30.000
When are you going to 3D print me?

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:32.000
I want Rob Roberts action figures.

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:34.000
I'd have to get a 3D model of you to do that.

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:36.000
Alright. Awesome.

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:38.000
And then, I mean,

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:40.000
then we can do it. Mini me.

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:42.000
I think they have phone apps

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:44.000
that sort of do 3D models

02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:46.000
with multiple stuff, so

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:48.000
we can try. Awesome.

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:50.000
We're gonna clone me on a 3D printer.

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:52.000
That'd be awesome.

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:54.000
Alright.

02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:56.000
Anyway, that's gonna do it for another episode

02:32:56.000 --> 02:32:58.000
of Orange Lounge Radio. Thank you guys so much for tuning in.

02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:00.000
We will be back next week to do it

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:02.000
all over again. Until

02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:04.000
then, have a great week and happy gaming. Bye.

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:32.000
they were all still true.

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:36.000
See you next week.

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:52.000
Thanks for watching.
