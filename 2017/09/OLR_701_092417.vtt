WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
This week Sega does what Nintendo and improves it with an official collaboration between Sonic Forces and Hooters

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
Hopefully this goes better than when they partner with Soap Shoes

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
We have plenty more news from The Week in Gaming and it all starts right now on the show where every gamer has a voice

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio

00:38.000 --> 00:44.000
Live tonight with episode number 701 for this September the 24th of 2017

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me on Twitter at Skie

00:48.000 --> 00:54.000
I am joined in studio every week, each and every week with DarkSakura usually

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
But sadly she's not here tonight, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers is recovering from a cold

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
Some type of sick, I think it was a cold, I'm a bad friend, I don't remember exactly what it is she had

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
I think it was summer flu or something

01:04.000 --> 01:08.000
So whatever it was, it sounded like it was bad so we hope she feels better soon

01:08.000 --> 01:12.000
She said she's feeling better today but she's still kind of like, I don't really want to get you guys sick

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
And you know, doing the show, it does take a little bit of energy and so forth

01:15.000 --> 01:20.000
So DarkSakura just wants to take the night off to get better and we understand that

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
And the voice you just heard there of course joining me here, Techmaster Loki

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Hello, I'm here

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
Hi Loki, how are you?

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
I'm fine

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
Yeah? Not sick, that's good right?

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
I think just allergies but other than that

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
What else is new living here in lovely Sacramento, California where our show is based

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
That would be the capital folks if you've never heard of it

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
Arnold Schwarzenegger once had a job here, it was in the news for that anyway

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
So you're full of breadsticks tonight

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
Yep

01:48.000 --> 01:53.000
Once again, they're quoting 20 minutes and it takes 40 minutes for them to make fucking breadsticks

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
I know it takes 5 minutes to make

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
It's because they're under, well they're going to be under new management

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
They had a sign that said they got sold to another corporation

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
Yeah I was going to say, when was the last time you were there you said I'm not going back there anymore

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
Well I wasn't going to go back there yet and I decided

02:09.000 --> 02:13.000
Because I was going to pick something else to eat

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
And then I was like I can't decide what I want so I was like ok I'll just do breadsticks

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
I'll give them another go

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
And sure enough they fuck it up again

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
It's like, dude you guys come on

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
I can see you guys back there just fucking off

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
You're just like talking and not hurting, there's no hustle

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
Something the listeners should understand is that you're not just being one of those

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
I'd like to speak to your manager individuals but you actually used to work at the same pizza chain

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Yes I used to work

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
That was your minimum wage job

02:41.000 --> 02:46.000
It wasn't at this particular round table but it was another one

02:46.000 --> 02:51.000
I did everything from washing dishes to working the counter to making pizzas

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
To breaking down the oven and cleaning it

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
You did it all

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
To management, I was a shift manager at one time

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
Oh my god guys can you imagine Loki as your boss

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
I yelled a lot yes

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
It was a mutual understanding

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
So we do tape live every Sunday night at the voice of geeks network

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
vognetwork.com

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
It's 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
And speaking of Bobby, he was having a conversation on his show tonight

03:15.000 --> 03:19.000
He was talking about a big topic in gaming tonight which we'll get into a little bit later

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
About the whole deal that's going on with Player Unknown Battlegrounds

03:22.000 --> 03:28.000
Which is a game that obviously I've seen that it's popular on Twitch

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
Only $29.99 apparently

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
And usually when I drop in on streams I'm kind of like, I don't really get it

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
But I've had more and more people especially since we have a Discord server now

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
That's actually been fairly active

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
And if you want to join our Discord server please

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
Over at vognetwork.com slash Discord you can join in

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
More and more people are saying like Rob you should really check this game out

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
Well sadly I didn't do that this week

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
But I did go and I watched some more streamers

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
And I kind of made myself watch a little more of it

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
And I was like okay, I get this game a little more

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
But something that Bobby brought up on his show tonight was the whole tagline that you get for winning

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
The winner winner chicken dinner

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
That's a common saying out there

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
Is that like a regional thing?

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
Do they say that far and wide?

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
Would they know what I mean in Canada

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
If I said that little jingle

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
I don't know, is that worldwide? I don't know

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
But I was thinking in your case Loki

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
Maybe the game should allow you to customize

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
Maybe that could be a micro transaction

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
That you could pick your own dinner

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
And so Loki when you win in PUBG

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
You could get winner winner breadstick dinner

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
I'm fine with chicken, it's more sense

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
We don't need to appeal to a mass audience here

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
What about a winner winner turducken dinner

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
Winner winner bacon dinner

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
I feel like there's a market here

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
That PUBG creators should be listening to

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
No, no

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
Because they already have micro transactions in the game

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
Well as I said we do tape live Sunday nights at the voice geeks network

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
And you guys can chat along with us and participate with our show

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
Because we are the show where every gamer has a voice

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
And we invite you guys to sit down with us every week

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
Over at live.vognetwork.com

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
Where we do have our live chatters going

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
Come on Nolga starts us off tonight saying

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
I can relate Loki

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
I used to work at a Starbucks and I can't stand

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
When baristas don't steam milk

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
The way that they are trained to do it

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
Oh man I went into a Starbucks once with my friend

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
That used to work at one and I swear

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
She was about to have a breakdown

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
Because everything was disorganized in the store

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
Stuff was everywhere and she was like

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
How the fuck are they getting away with this order

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
It usually works to their benefit

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
Because I'm more patient because I understand

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
I've been there I'm not gonna get mad at you

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
Because it's not in your control

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
But dude I mean come on

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
There's a guy like he's like I need a box

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
I just need a small box

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
And the guy that's like cutting you know the pizzas

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
And putting them boxes just staring right at him

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
It's like are you gonna fucking do something

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
Like maybe ask him what he wants

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
Are you gonna say hey there's someone at the counter

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
Maybe someone back here that's fucking around

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
Maybe like go help him

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
I think one of these days you need to put on your old

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
Uniform under what you're wearing

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
Oh I don't have any more

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
Dude those uniforms are fucking

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
Crusted full like nasty ass

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
You know pizza sauce

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
It's just like it

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
No it's not a thing that I would

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
Want to wear again but

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
No those got thrown out a while ago

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
No seriously it's

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
I get it I get it

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
It's like you guys may or may not know

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
I trained for a call center for many many years

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
This was the job that I did

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
And so when I call

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
Like call centers I usually have a lot of patience

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
From people on the line because I know you know what they're

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
Going through and so forth and I never lose

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
My shit with somebody on the phone

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
If even if I'm upset I'm gonna

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
I'm gonna start off by saying like

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
I'm really upset that this is happening

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
I know it's not your fault but is there anything

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
You can do to help me like I always you know kind of

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
Be nice about it like I'm pissed but I'm not pissed

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
At you which trust me those folks

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
Really appreciate

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
But I get it but then when I get like the really

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
Lazy where it's like I totally

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
Know this person is like trying to shoo me off the line

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
Doesn't care does it like I get

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
Really frustrated and I never

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
I never yell I still don't yell I'm not that type

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
I just hang up and call back and get somebody else

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
Right like they were cool like last

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
Time that that happened you know they

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
The manager actually did call me and leave a message

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
Later on and like he was probably

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Gonna like they already caught me that one

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
Time so I was like that's fine

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
You took care of it then I don't need to talk to your

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
Manager to say hey

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
You guys are slow in this particular instance

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
I don't like I don't like to make a fuss

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
There's no point in doing that it's not gonna accomplish anything

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
But some people love to make a fuss and it's always like oh god

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
Oh yeah I know I know

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
So awkward stop making a fuss

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
So many I know the owner

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
And they would come in like they would

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
Fucking like there's one family

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
They claim they knew the owner

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
They did know the owner and we

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
Knew them all like everybody in the store

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
Knew them cause every time they'd come in

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
They would complain about their pizza

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
Doesn't matter what they ordered

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
They would have a complaint about it cause they were trying to get it for free

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Every time

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
So fucking annoying

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
But yes those people do exist

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
Alright we will get to video games

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
I promise but I wanted to read some more comments

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
And chat over at live.voggenetwork.com

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
Let's see

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
Tigerclaw asks why does it always have to be chicken dinner

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
What if you want a steak dinner?

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
That's what I'm saying

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
Like you know a steak dinner that's a reward

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
Like when I get to go to Ruth Chris

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
Like I'm putting on my slacks

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
To go out to the restaurant

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
Like this is fine dining tonight

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
So yeah I'm good for steak dinner

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
Let's see

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
Somebody is oh yeah Dungeon Buster suggested

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
Loki on the next undercover boss

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
And come on Noel Gus says

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
Loki's game needs to be a food service worker

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
VR simulator

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
Well that's kind of I mean I guess they have job simulator

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
But that's kind of that's different

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
It's already been done so well

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
That's a perfect example recent example

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
Of food service worker VR game

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
That's fucking weird because

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
We haven't had a food

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
A weird food service game in a while since like

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
Sneak King but if anyone's

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
Watched videos of the VR

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
KFC

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
Chicken Fry game that is

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
Fucking weird and I need a full game

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
Of that because that's just like crazy

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
That came up on the show a couple weeks ago yeah

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
There's a really fun game that one of my

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
Buddies on Twitch streams and I can't

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
Remember the name of it which is horrible

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
But it's like one of those food service games

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
And you have the ingredients that and people

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
Come up to the table and you have to put it all together

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
And all that stuff and that was you know it kind of reminded

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
Me of that only job simulator where you can just fuck it

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
All up because you know it's a robot

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
It was something that started with an O

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
And it would be not overcooked not that one

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
It's something else had like a four three or four word

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
Title and this was like part two and it was

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
Something new so maybe maybe no

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
It wasn't overcooked unfortunate something else

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
I know that one um yeah anyway

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
Sorry I can't I don't always

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
Remember the name of every single game out there

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
Is that it yes MXC

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Is right it's cook serve delicious that is the name

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
Of it it was cook good job MXC

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
Winner winner steak dinner MXC

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
It's cook serve delicious that's the name of it

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
So yeah that one's uh

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
That one looked fun so that's one you could try

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
Because not only do you have to cook the food

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
But then all of a sudden like instead of a food order coming in

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
It'll come in and go bing the toilet's backed

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
Up you gotta go fix it bing

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
The dumpsters full out back

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
So you have to go and like the part of the keystrokes you do is like

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Stomp the dumpster down

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Like everything so I thought it was funny

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
Or the rat traps have to be

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
Reset or just like other like random shit

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
Comes in in addition to the food and I thought that was

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
Funny so yeah I watched a

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
Buddy of mine playing it on twitch and I was like oh maybe I'll

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
Get this this will be fun so

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
Alright anyhow

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
Guys you don't suggest

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
Overwatch no that's a different game

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
We'll get into that during gaming weeks but

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
First let's get to our kickoff topic tonight

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Believe it or not we're not just going to talk about

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Food service but we want to talk a little bit about

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Tokyo Game Show was this past week

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
Which was mainly

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
A Sony affair I mean

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
Not exclusively obviously you have a lot of

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
Third party developers showing the stuff

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
They're doing for maybe mobile phones

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
And so forth but um

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
With Microsoft you know in

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
Japan not really being a thing and

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Nintendo sitting out Tokyo Game Show

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
It really is Sony's to kind of drive so that's

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Why they did a big press conference which was

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
What it was Tuesday in Japan

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
Right but it was yeah like Tuesday at 6

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Third time but it was Monday at midnight

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
For us yeah and I didn't

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Like this is one of those rare occasions where I have to

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
Really thank Twitter because I

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
Excuse me I totally forgot that this was

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
The thing that was going to be on until

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
Twitter was like hey here's the YouTube stream

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
Stream with the English translation

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
Of the people on stage didn't translate

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
The trailers but it was enough you could understand

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
What was going on so I actually watched

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
I mean I only missed the very very beginning

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
Where I guess they had some type of song or something

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
I totally missed that thing but I saw

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Yeah it was just a sizzle reel

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
Yeah I saw the bulk of it and I was I

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
I liked it dare I say I was more

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
Engaged than I was with E3

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
Because I felt like we saw

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
More like new things

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
As opposed to you know my disappointment

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
With this year's E3 is that it really felt like it was

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
Shorter and it was like it was kind of like an update

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
A thon but you know there were updates

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
In this too don't get me wrong but there were some other things

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
I saw in it where I was like ooh cat butt

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
I want to see how they're going to do that which obviously I'm talking about

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
Nicole Atsume is getting a VR version

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
Which that was kind of out of left field

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
I mean I don't think there were a lot of like huge surprises

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
Well actually no I take that back there were kind of some big surprises

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
Like Zone of the Enders

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
Getting a VR release

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
That's a very interesting direction from Konami

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
Where you have to think

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
At this point that Konami

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
Is well aware of

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
What's going on on the internet

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
Like somebody at this point

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
Has found out that Konami is not popular

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
People are saying fuck you Konami

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
This is brand new information

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
They are not happy with the way we are doing things

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
So I do feel like

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
Konami is kind of like

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
I feel like in a way they might be doing

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
Some soul searching right now

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
What isn't working for us

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Fucking over Hideo Kojima that's not working for us

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
What is working for us

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
Making the old shit new again

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
Right and that's why you see

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
Well I mean it's working in television too

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
Like fucking Will and Grace is back on TV this week

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
But anyway

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
What was I going to say

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
Everything is old is new again

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Final Fantasy 9

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
Nah not just that dammit

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
I lost my train of thought

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
No Zone of the Enders Konami

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
Oh Bomberman the Bomberman thing on Switch

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
That came out not that long ago right

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
And they began supporting that

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
What have they been supporting it with

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
Pyramid Head

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
And now I think they just announced

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
The franchise is delivered again

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
Right but I do feel like Konami

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
Is trying to like tap into like what do we have

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
Left to salvage this relationship

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
And to be fair

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
Their arcade division is still kind of

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
Chugging along like you know

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
U-Beat is still like I see lines for that at

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
Conventions and 2DX is trucking along

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Dance Dance Revolution is school

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
I would like to see another Dance Dance Revolution come home

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
I understand that's not a very profitable thing

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
I would just like to see fucking Beatmania 2DX come home

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
Like yes I know it's a special controller

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
Come on come on

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
Just release something that

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
Is playable on a regular controller

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
Yes I know it'll suck but

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
Release like a special third party

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
Old school controller that will work on

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
PlayStation 4 like

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
Why do you keep robbing me of this because there's so

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
Many songs from what was the last one they did

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
I keep wanting to say Princess but I think it was

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
Empress 2DX Empress all the way through now

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
That's like that's like eight or nine

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
Versions of the game that have never

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
Come home you know anyway

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
But I don't know maybe some people are like

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
Beatmania 2DX is kind of an old

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
It's an old game but yet it's still going in the arcade

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
I mean there's an audience for it somewhere

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
Right I don't know anyway

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
I just I mean people are if they're worried about

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
Like the price points and you know selling that

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
Stuff I mean a lot of times people are buying

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
Like these collector's editions they're like $200

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
And what comes with a shitty statue

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
I mean

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
Fuck I'm sure you can manage to make a controller

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
Cheap or just you know

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
What I know this may not be the popular

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
Idea but it's better than nothing

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
Why not just release Beatmania

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
Online and it comes with

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
Like three songs for free

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
And the whole thing is free just to make the game

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Free and it comes with like

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
The staple Konami songs like

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
20 November and you know like

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
Old Konami shit for free like three

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
Konami originals for free that you just download for free

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
And then just charge for song packs

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
Like mobile phone games do

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
I think there would be a lot of people that would play

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
Like a 2DX Unlimited type of thing

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
And that might even worry I mean

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
I would hope they would release it in the US

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
But I guess if it's region free I don't know

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
I just I feel like that could happen

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
Why not like um

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
DJ Max

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
Is very very very

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
Similar and is

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
Out and I've played it thanks

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
To Shane doing the import thing on his

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
Playstation 4 and it's

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
It's fun I like it and I

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
Can't wait for some of the DLC that they're going to put out

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
Because I really want to play like

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
They have like a Hatsune Miku game that's like that too

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
I thought they had a free one

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
They do it's

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
Hatsune Miku so it's not the falling notes

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
Yeah yeah they do

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
It's like one song that comes with that one

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
It's like two songs one from each pack

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
It's like a I don't remember the exact names

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
It's like Sun and Moon type of thing

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
You can download big I think

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
It's like Future Tone somebody in channel yell it out

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
But I think one of them

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
Is like older songs and one of them is like newer

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
From the arcade songs is kind of how it

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
Yeah Act F says

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
Hatsune Miku Future Tone

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
There you go

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
Dartetsuya in chat says

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
They have that the BeatMania 2DX thing I'm talking about

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
But it's not free that's right I forgot about this

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
He says it's called Infinitas

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
But it doesn't use the song pack model

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
They charge monthly for a Picelli

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
Or whatever okay then

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
It ain't on console so

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
Scrap it and start over

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
My controversial thought

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
Anyway sorry we deviated a little bit

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
We were supposed to be talking about Tokyo Game Show and Sony's press conference

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
And it turned into a whole I wish Konami would do this thing

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
But I think the

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
The moral of the story is

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
I think the Gears are

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Taking at Konami and they realize

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
They're not loved

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
And cherished right now

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
So you're probably going to see them try to do

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
Some weird things over the next couple of years

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
To try to win people's favor back

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
Like that new Metal Gear Solid game

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
I think they will put out a new Silent Hill

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
Even though obviously

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
PT and what we saw there

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
That should have been it I think Konami will put out a new Silent Hill

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
I think they will

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
Hopefully it's before this

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
New Kojima game comes out

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
Because that's going to fucking

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
Destroy whatever they want

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
Well obviously it would be ridiculous to release them the same day

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
But assuming

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
The Hideo Kojima game is a next year

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
Release that would seem

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
It would seem like 2018 is a good time for that to come out

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
Well I'm not surprised

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
I was kind of hoping we'd see a new trailer

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
For that

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
But I guess we'll have to wait until December

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
For Death Stranding

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
That also might be a little played out at the PlayStation events right now

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
We haven't had one

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
There wasn't a trailer at E3

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
So it's been a while since December

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
Was the last time we had a trailer

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
I guess that's true

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
The next thing we see ought to be gameplay

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
And you do mention December

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
Obviously Sony has their big

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
Company event

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
The Sony experience

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
And there's also the video game awards

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
Usually Geoff Keighley is chummy

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
With Kojima

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
Usually they have something there

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
And Nintendo yeah

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
So he usually gets some stuff for that

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Death Stranding starring Mario

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
Mamma Mia

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
This is weird

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
I don't know what's going on here

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
Suddenly I'm shirtless and the world is adoring my titties

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
Anyway let's talk about some other stuff

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
That was in Sony's press conference

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
Now I have to see someone recreate

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
The Death Stranding trailer

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
But CG characters from Mario

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
Replacing the characters

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
I'm pretty sure that had to have been done

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
It's not done yet but that would be hilarious

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
I would love to see that

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
What were some other things we got here

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
We got the Call of Duty World War 2 trailer

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
Ni No Kuni 2 trailer

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
Right up your alley

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
Earth Defense Force

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
I would have been more excited about Earth Defense Force 5

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
If they hadn't already announced that

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
So that was alright

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
Pretty soon

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
The one I was more excited about was the other Earth Defense Force game

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Which was Earth Defense Force Iron Rain

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
Which is a brand new game

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
That's using a different engine

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
By a different developer

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
So I'm very interested in that

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
How do you feel about that whole different developer thing?

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
It was fine

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
The one that they did, Insect Armageddon

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
It was different

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
I liked it, it was alright

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
It got kind of boring after a while

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
The only reason that game was boring

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
Was because it had two levels in it

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
And it was also kind of hard to

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Level up

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
Whereas the other games you kind of get weapons

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
By just grinding the levels

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
Whereas this you had to grind money to buy weapons

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
And that kind of sucked

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
But

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
I'll play it

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
I still haven't played much of Earth Defense

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
I need to go back to Earth Defense Force 4

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
Or 4.1

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
Because I have that and I have the DLC for it

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
I just haven't really played much into it

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
I'll do that this week because I need to go back

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
You know Gabe, our buddy from

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
I almost said Niantic

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
Nascent Games

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
Gave here locally, he loves that series

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
Yeah, we'll have to seriously

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
That was the other thing

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
The co-op

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
In 4.1 they have 4 player co-op

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
But that was the first game that had

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
More than just

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
2 player co-op and same screen

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
So that was kind of fun

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
I hate to backtrack a little bit

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
It's just the two of us tonight

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
And it's going to be a shorter show if I don't do some tangents

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
So I'm reading the comments in chat

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
And they're talking a little bit about Death Stranding

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
And now I'm stuck on this

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
As long as we're talking about this

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
Art, avant-garde, fucking weird ass video game

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
Here's the fucking dream team collaboration

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
I want to see

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
The Guillermo del Toro and Hideo Kojima thing

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
I'm here for that, that's going to be awesome

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
I want to see a game that fucking David Lynch makes

20:48.000 --> 20:52.000
Can you fucking imagine

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
A David Lynch video game

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
Would that be like a David Cage game?

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
You know like the

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
Detroit, was it

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
Oh

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
It's some Detroit, I can't remember

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
Even, no I think

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
I can't remember the name, but the androids or whatever

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
I think it would be even weirder than that

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
Like Heavy Rain

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
Like press X to go to the next level

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
And then you press X, you press the O button

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
You are dead, like it's just weird shit that would happen

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
And then everybody would talk back

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
Fuck you, I pushed X

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
Tigerclaw suggests

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
maybe a Twin Peaks game, I don't know if I would

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
want it to be that direct

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
I feel like, how about a

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
Lost Highway game

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
Because that movie was fucked up

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
So maybe something like that, I don't know

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
We'll see

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
S200mad says I don't think our minds can process

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
a David Lynch game, it would have to be

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
a point and click adventure

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
Raginator suggests David Lynch and David Hader

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
Yes, perfect, perfect

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
All the Davids in a game, anyway

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
I apologize for my tangent

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
It was a thought I had to get out of my system

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
Alright

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
So let's follow that up with

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
Idolmaster, Stella Stage

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
is going to be out at the end of the year, December 31st in Japan

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
How about the big

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
It's out now moment

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
Which was ruined a little bit by a

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
rating that was out there earlier in the day

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
But eh, Final Fantasy 9

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
was the surprise release

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
And here they kind of did

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
Kinda, I was more like Final Fantasy 16

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
should be Final Fantasy 15's engine

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
but a Final Fantasy 9 type story

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
And here's Final Fantasy 9

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
I liked, see that's what I kind of liked about

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
8 a little bit and even 7

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
Well actually probably 6, 7 and 8

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
It was that whole

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
fantasy

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
It's kind of like a technology

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
and a fantasy setting type thing

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
That was one of the things that drew me into 6

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
Oh shit, it's like fucking Final Fantasy

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
Like it's all fantasy saying but then there's mechs

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
and you know, guns

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
and magic and that was kind of cool

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
that mix

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
I'm not feeling so much of the magic and guns and shit

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
modern day but whatever

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
What was the name of that? Was that the uh

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
Was that, that was one of that

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
that thing they showed right? The new Left Alive

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
Was that it? Or is that, no

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
What was that? Left Alive is a, yeah

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
That's the new game that I know has artwork by the guy

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
that did Melior Solid

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
Yoshi Shinkawa, and it's a shooter

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
from Square Enix. I just remember because you know

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
we're talking a lot about like oh it's kind of updates

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
and things but there was some new stuff

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
that they showed at this and that was one of them

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
And they showed a new trailer for

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
Dissidia NT

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
Which now of course, no big surprise

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
They have characters from Final Fantasy 15

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
in it so

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
Noctis I think, yeah

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
A lot of impressive VR stuff too

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
They showed, the VR segment

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
was pretty meaty

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
That was kind of nice to see Sony really

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
I think that's part of why I walked away

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
feeling favorable from what I saw at Tokyo Game Show

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
because I really feel like okay, Sony

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
is really investing in VR

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
It kind of showed in a way

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
It's not a Vita

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
Yeah, yeah, well yeah

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
That's kind of why I'm happy

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
Sony really is planning these other things

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
And I guess it felt maybe more exciting for me

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
than like E3 which is when we found

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
out the Final Fantasy game was fishing

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
They just really needed to bring the hardware price down

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
They did, in Japan

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
I think they did recently here too

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
So it is coming down

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
They need to push it more because I think it would be

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
you know, get more people involved in it

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
Let's see, Arc Park

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
was something that they were showing on VR

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
Gran Turismo Sport which obviously is going to be beautiful

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
The Zone of the Inner's thing we talked about

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
Niko Atsume which I joked about earlier

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
Let's see, Niko Niko

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
which is, you know, it's not really big here

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
but it's a YouTube, Twitch-esque

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
type of thing that they have in Japan

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
A lot of events happen on there

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
I couldn't believe that series is still around

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
A-Train has been around since like the...

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
I hope they release that over here

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
They've done some A-Train games

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
have been out over here

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
Train Sims are way

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
Train Sims are way bigger in Japan

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
I'm surprised Farm Sim hasn't gone

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
VR yet, but that might be something coming

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
Gran Turismo Sport looks cool though

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
Let's see, and

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
which I thought was something interesting

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
they also were pushing a Japan Studio

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
VR music festival and digital

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
theatre where you could be like in a concert

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
in PlayStation VR

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
so PlayStation VR starting

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
to kind of nudge itself a little bit into that

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
life space which

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
you know, not to bring up an old conversation

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
but I will, which is why

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
we speculate Facebook had bought Oculus

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
all that time ago is that maybe it was not just

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
that VR is for gaming, but VR is for life

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
experiences and being able to

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
be right in the middle of an experience

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
so now you see kind of Sony doing that a little bit

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
with PlayStation VR and this is something

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
you know, this is an entry

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
level VR thing for a lot of people

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
and so it's kind of neat that they're selling this

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
kind of different experience, this is in addition to

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
3-ray Blu-rays, they don't really make

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
movies in 360 degree just yet

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
but maybe Sony will have

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
a live show at a Sony theatre

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
and I'm not just talking about concerts, maybe like, I don't know

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
a Cirque du Soleil or a stage play

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
or something that maybe they'll put in VR someday

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
We'll see, could be interesting

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
could be interesting, or what about

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
what about y'all

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
if the next E3

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
Sony does their press conference

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
but you can watch it in VR

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
and like you're there

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
in the actual arena

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
maybe, yeah

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
I'd still rather watch it on screen because it's mostly trailers

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
but yeah

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
I still think doing home on PlayStation VR

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
is something they should do

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
but what would be cool is if in those trailers

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
like VR trailers, it's VR

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
like how they have the 3D trailers at the movies

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
where those trailers are in 3D

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
where some are not in 3D

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
Bobby Blackwolf, speaking of home, is pointing out in chat

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
over at live.fognetwork.com

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
Hey Loki, did you notice that SteamVR Home

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
now allows you to put the

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
trophies you earn in games

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
into your home space? Valve is greater than Sony

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
First off, I didn't realize there was a SteamVR Home

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
and yes, yes

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
they win obviously

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
because they were able to fulfill a promise

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
the only thing I worry about

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
well, I guess you can put select trophies in there

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
because if it's all trophies, there's some of these games nowadays

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
that just kick out trophies like

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
like crazy, so

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
you're just like, ah shit, there's trophies all over me

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
but

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
yeah, it's cool that you can put that stuff in there

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
can you visit other people's homes in there?

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
I mean, is there a point to it? Can you do a clubhouse

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
type of thing in SteamVR because that was

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
always, I felt like, a really missed opportunity

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
within PlayStation Home

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
well actually later on, I remember when we had that

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
listener, and I don't think he listens anymore, we had that guy

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
who set up a really fancy VOG clubhouse

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
and I was like, oh this is pretty cool, but like

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
it would be even cooler if I could

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
inject my own pictures into this

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
or audio, so we could play audio clips

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
from OLR or something in other

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
VOG shows when you're visiting the space

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
like, why

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
and I suppose they're probably worried

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
well, if we let people upload any old pictures

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
there'll just be titties everywhere

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
and if we let people upload audio, it'll be a copyright nightmare

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
but, you know

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
YouTube does it somehow

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
and it works, so it was somewhat

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
barely, anyway

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
yeah, and Bobby Blackwolf says

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
yes, you can visit others, you can start up a

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
SteamVR space and anybody can join it, or you can make your

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
friends only, you can even make a

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
custom SteamVR space, it uses

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
Workshop, so there you go

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
anyway, it's not supposed to be all about

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
Valve right now, it's supposed to be about Sony

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
but, um

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
well it's not my fault if Sony is not supporting

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
certain things that they promised several years ago

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
that they would support, there was an update on

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
Detroit, which looks like an awesome game, I'm excited

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
about that, a Virtual On

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
crossover, which I thought was

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
yeah, that was weird, yeah

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
and then, let's see

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
a new channel called Animax

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
which is going to be on the Playstation 4

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
which is, I guess, anime, all day every day

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
is it anime and skinimax?

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
mixed together? one can hope

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
maybe Animax After Dark, who knows

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
and last but not least, the last big thing

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
they showed for the day was

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
Monster Hunter World, and the big reveal

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
of the release date, January 26th

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
next year, obviously

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
2018, and it is going to be a

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
simultaneous worldwide release

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
so US, Europe, all the other

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
places, getting it the exact same

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
day, there will be a Monster Hunter

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
Playstation 4 Pro released

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
in Japan, that I think comes out a little

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
sooner, I don't think it actually comes out, I think comes out

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
like in the next couple months, so

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
you know, if you're an ultimate Monster Hunter fan

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
you can get something a little bit sooner, so

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
yeah, that was some of the big stuff out of Tokyo Game

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
Show, so that's one of those shows

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
I'd love to go to someday, maybe

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
maybe, maybe

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
alright, I'm fine, I'm a little worried

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
about the fact that, you know, I don't speak a lick of

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
Japanese, but hopefully I'd have a friend or something

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
that could help me out that does speak it

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
and, you know, so I don't get lost

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
okay, so one of the other things I was gonna mention too

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
that they were showing off, I think was that

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
PlayLink stuff, so that was the

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
where you use your cell phones as a controller, basically

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
oh, yeah, yeah, they brought them, so they had

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
a hidden agenda, which is a new game

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
as it did, that was, okay, here's the thing

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
that was at E3, but

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
do you remember how they had like an hour

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
or a half hour, like

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
pre-game before the press conference?

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
hidden agenda was in the pre-game

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
remember one of our big complaints about E3 was that

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
like, all the rad stuff was in the pre-game

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
that's when they announced Undertale was coming to Playstation 4

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
but that was all in the pre-game, so hidden agenda was in

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
that pre-game, but this was

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
its first Japanese unveiling, I guess

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
or confirmation

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
yeah, no, I mean, the game looks really cool

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
and like, it was showing the whole concept where like

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
one person is a traitor on the team, right

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
trying to

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
skim through a lot of that

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
that's okay, hence the name hidden agenda

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
one of the players is trying to screw all the others

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
so it's that, it's betrayal at House on the Hill

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
so it's you don't know Jack!

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
yeah, kind of

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
so, yeah, anyway

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
I enjoyed the Sony press conference and considering that

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
I was ready to just kind of go, oh, it's gonna be

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
you know, it's gonna be a lot of the Japan

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
games and stuff we never get to play here

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
considering I was kind of going into it with that mindset

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
that I wasn't really gonna see anything, I didn't even

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
think I'd end up watching the whole thing, I figured I'd turn it off

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
after 20 minutes, but I watched the whole thing

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
and I was like, oh, this is a really good show

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
good job, Sony

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
I felt better going out of that than I did at E3

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
so, I was happy

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
alright, we'll get into some

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
more stories in just a moment, but first

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
I wanna talk about our gaming weeks

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
and the types of video games that you've been playing

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
this week, DarkSakura not here to share

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
her week with us, but I'm sure it involved

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
lots of Dragon Ball

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
what is the one she's playing

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
online, I can't remember

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
Z2, oh, no, I'll tell you what

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
she's playing is that idle pouring game still

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
she got me fucking playing it too

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
yeah, and joining her guild, it's the

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
Ragnarok clicker game

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
but you don't really click in it

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
but anyway, so that

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
yeah, that's like

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
mine, it's, you know what, I'll say this

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
for one of those clicker games, it's pretty well done

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
although the translation

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
is a little hit and miss, but you can follow it

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
well enough, so you like join guilds?

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
yeah, you can join guilds with other people

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
and yeah, leaderboards and stuff like that

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
so there's a lot of in-depth to it

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
but of course it's all more ways

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
to have more items that you need the special currency

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
to buy, but I haven't spent any real

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
money on it yet, and don't plan to, so we'll see

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
anyway, but that's enough about that

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
how about your gaming week, Logie?

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
so I mainly, well this is funny enough

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
that we talk about idle games, I mainly played

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
the office space idle game, and I've actually

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
finished it, so

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
basically the whole objective of the

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
main game is to get to level 100 where you

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
become the CEO of Inateck, and

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
I've done that, and so

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
now it's just

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
why do I need to play this game anymore?

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
I don't, so

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
I've been playing, like they do these little events

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
and stuff, so you play like

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
almost like a separate game, where they kind of

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
change up the rules a little bit

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
and so I've been doing that to unlock more

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
cards, because you can assign

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
characters to each of your floors

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
and you get different bonuses

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
based on which characters are in the

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
floors, so

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
it's kind of a little bit like

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
I don't know, there's not much clicking with

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
in fact, actually they've really

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
nerfed any of the clicking in the game

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
so it's, you may do that

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
in the beginning, or do

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
that for your daily, trying to get 100

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
critical clicks or whatever

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
but aside from that, you're not

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
really, it's more of just management

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
and just trying to

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
you know, I don't know

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
strategy, and there's a lot of strategy involved

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
with it, so I played that

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
I didn't play

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
a whole ton of console games, it's mainly just

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
played a little bit more of the Lego movie

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
game

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
but I'm probably gonna stop playing that

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
because I finished it already, and I don't really

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
want Grind to get all the extra characters, because I

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
just don't care, but

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
Fair enough. I mean, I kind of wanted the

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
achievements for it, but

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
You don't want to platinum that bad, huh?

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
Well, it's not even on the PlayStation

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
it's on Steam, so I

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
I don't care, it doesn't really matter

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
but, yeah, it was fun

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
I thought about getting the Ninjago game

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
because it came out bad, because the movie just came out

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
but I think I'll just wait for the Lego Marvel

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
2 game that's gonna be coming out in the fall

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
and then of course South Park's in like a couple weeks

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
so, yeah

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
I probably will end up playing that next

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
but yeah, like I said, I need

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
to go back to Earth Defense Force 4.1

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
so I'll probably end up doing that, because

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
I haven't played that in a while

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
I do need to play some more VR, though

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
I need to finish, or actually play

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
Superhot VR

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
because I have that now

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
I've been meaning to try it, but every time I go

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
I don't really want to set it up

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
so, it's just laziness

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
that's preventing me from playing that

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
That's it. Alright

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
My gaming week, I gotta admit

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
not a lot of new stuff this week

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
I did play Super Metroid after the

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
show last week, and

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
I actually did do a follow-up stream

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
so, not everybody probably saw it

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
because it was late at night on Wednesday or Thursday, but I did do a follow-up stream

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
and I got so lost

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
and I was kind of embarrassed, because I'm like

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
for as much as I love this game, it was like, wow

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
I was really running around in circles

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
I was like, I could not fucking remember what I had to do

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
at one point, so

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
I think I need to make it a goal to

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
play through that game once a year

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
to just keep my

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
skills up and remember where

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
everything is and stuff, and not be like

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
is this when I get the ice beam?

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
So anyway, so I did have

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
fun with that, and I've been playing a little bit of

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
Overwatch this week, because they had the

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
free weekend going on, and I just

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
I don't know, I was into it. I actually downloaded it on

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
Xbox One. I've been meaning to try

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
because I think it went free to play

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
was that whole Fortnite

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
do they have the battle royale Fortnite that's

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
out now? That's something I should

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
probably check out, because that's free. Isn't that free on consoles too?

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
I think it does have a

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
free to play version, I think the battle royale thing

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
is in early access, we'll get into that in a little while

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
but it's going to come up in the news later

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
but anyway, yeah

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
free to play is great, but Overwatch

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
not free to play, but they did have a free weekend

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
so I finally downloaded it to my Xbox One

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
so I can say I've played it on

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
every system that it's on now

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
so I've played PlayStation 4, I've played PC

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
I didn't buy it on Xbox One, sorry

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
it's not really cheap enough for me to

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
triple dip on Overwatch, but

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
I just thought it would be fun to download it

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
and I got all my loot boxes from the Twitch Prime

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
thing, they just showed up automatically

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
on Xbox, so that was kind of cool

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
so yeah, there was that

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
that was something I played this week

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
and then I played a lot of Pokemon Go today

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
because of the Equinox event

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
so I played

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
yeah, I played a lot of that

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
and got Stardust and did like

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
four raids today, so

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
busy with that

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
yeah, that's really

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
continuing to do some Heroes of the Storm

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
but otherwise, that's pretty much been my game of the week

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
alright

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
nothing really new this week, sadly

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
going to our chat over at

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
live.vognetwork.com, tigercaw in chat says

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
have you been playing Samus Returns?

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
thank you for bringing that up

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
not enough, I need to play more of it

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
but I just, yeah

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
when I, like the time for me to play

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
DS games is when I'm like lying in bed

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
about ready to go to sleep and maybe I'll play a game

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
before I go to sleep, but lately

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
this week it's just been, I'm gonna lie down and

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
snore

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
so I don't ever really get around to playing the game

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
I need to kind of like force myself to just sit down

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
and spend more time with Samus Returns

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
because I really did enjoy the part of

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
what I played

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
Corkay is in our chat right now saying

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
Fortnite is not free yet

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
they still want you to buy the early access stuff

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
but I think that's in the

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
long term plan

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
I thought the Battle Royale portion was free to play

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
I think it will be, I don't think it is yet

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
alright, let's get into some

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
housekeeping real quick and then we will do

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
some news, housekeeping this week

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
follow us on Twitter, twitter.com

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
slash o-l-r, we're also on Facebook

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
facebook.com slash orange lounge

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
radio

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
I want to mention the Discord too, I think I did earlier

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
in the show but I realized last week on our

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
big 700th episode, I forgot to freaking mention it

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
so we do have a new Discord server

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
check it out at vognetwork.com

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
slash Discord, that's just gonna

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
that just forwards you to the

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
Discord with the invite code because you don't need an invite

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
it's open though, you don't need like a special

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
invitation, this is your special invitation

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
go to vognetwork.com slash Discord and you can join

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
and you get updates on the

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
shows and you can also like submit

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
stories and there's just like some general

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
chat and when we were doing, I was sad

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
because I archived the DragonCon channel today

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
but when we were at DragonCon, you know

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
we were posting pictures and live updates from that

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
so it's been a lot of fun, it's been a good experiment

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
so yeah, check that out

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
and then also some of our

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
streamers are using it for their

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
voice chat, like when I was doing

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
I did an impromptu late night

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
Overwatch stream on Twitch

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
Friday night or Saturday night

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
I don't remember

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
I didn't start the stream until like midnight

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
it was like an Insomniac feed

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
but Flaco was up and so we started playing

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
together and we were having a hilarious time because he was playing

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
on PC because it's the free weekend on PC

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
so he just joined the voice chat

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
on the VoG Discord and we were able to both talk

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
and you know, can be heard on the feed

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
so it was fun!

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
Cool. So there's that.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
Another thing I want to give a plug for

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
real quick is I want to give a shout out to

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
the Pokemon Go podcast

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
because you know

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
Charles, who's one of the hosts over there

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
and I know Joe too

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
Charles and I have been talking

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
for a while about me doing some type of like

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
segment thing on the show

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
so I did a segment this week

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
so you can check that out on their latest episode, episode 62

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
so I did like a little 5 minute segment

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
about, since I have played

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
a lot of Ingress, I kind of

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
still keep tabs on what's going on there

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
and kind of talking about what happening there

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
and how that might relate to Pokemon Go

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
so yeah, it was fun

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
and they were very nice and they played it on the show

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
so check it out, so it's episode 62

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
I think is where that shows up

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
and I'm hoping to do that, if not every week

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
if there's not enough news every week, maybe every other week

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
I have a little segment there that I'll be

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
sending over to those guys

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
so big shout out and thank you to them!

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
Alright, let's move on

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
for some gaming news, Loki!

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
So Steam is changing up

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
how they're doing

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
their review scores

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
basically

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
what's been happening lately

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
with a lot of different games is

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
they've been getting review bombed

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
so for example, when

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
there was the announcement that

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
there was going to be the in-game

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
microtransactions with

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
the new Shadow of War game

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
when there was

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
the whole backlash

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
with the Firewatch devs

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
Campo Santo

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
basically saying that we're going to flag

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
PewDiePie because of his

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
racist comments

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
there was a backlash against that

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
where fans of PewDiePie

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
were going and review

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
bombing Firewatch

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
or

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
NBA 2K 18

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
because of their microtransactions

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
and that kind of stuff

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
basically what this is going to do

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
is it's going to kind of give you a history

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
so they call it a histogram

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
where it kind of shows you

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
where the

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
reviews kind of went down

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
where it's fluctuated

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
so for example, you can see

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
this was tied with this event

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
and so on and so forth

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
so it's still going to show those negative reviews

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
it's just going to kind of give you a bigger picture

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
to see, oh was this because

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
a recent patch has always been negative

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
what's

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
kind of the case with this?

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
do you think it's going to help

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
the review bombing or whatever?

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
no, I don't think it's going to do anything

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
much like anything Steam does

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
it doesn't really help

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
Steam is such a

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
it's such a mess now

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
I think in some ways Steam is a victim of its own success

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
I don't really know how to eloquently

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
more put it than that

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
but I feel like Steam kind of needs to find its focus

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
Steam has kind of been trying to bite off

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
a lot

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
between the whole, they started to build streaming

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
remember how Steam has streaming in it?

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
and with the workshop

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
and the reviews

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
and the curators

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
there's so many elements to Steam

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
I really feel like Steam needs to have a whole

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
what are we

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
going to be first and foremost?

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
are we a store? or are we a social network?

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
I don't know

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
they're working on lots of different changes

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
but I don't know

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
it doesn't seem like a lot of it helps

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
but at the very least

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
the whole Campo Santo thing

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
that's kind of unfair I feel

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
the backlash with that

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
however the shadow of war

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
and the 2K18 stuff

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
sorry

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
maybe if you didn't do dickish things

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
people wouldn't act like dicks to you

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
so I don't feel bad for them

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
but it's fine

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
why doesn't Steam

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
and I realize Steam calls out

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
this is somebody who actually bought the game

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
or has a key or whatever

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
the only way the people who have actually bought the game

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
they really should

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
well because I guess you could

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
theoretically purchase it on our platform

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
or like another

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
non-Steam

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
platform or something

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
but who cares?

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
I know this is going to be controversial but tough titty

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
just only allow the people

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
that bought it on Steam

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
not even the promo keys

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
only the people who bought it on Steam spent money

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
get to write reviews that are weighted

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
let anybody write

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
a review for whatever

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
but only the ones who actually bought it on Steam

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
are weighted

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
and you know what?

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
what would be the problem with that?

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
oh no

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
people are going to review bomb my game

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
by buying the game over and over again

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
and leaving reviews

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
I'm saying don't let the codes either

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
and I fully realize

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
that this is going to screw Kickstarter stuff

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
because a lot of Kickstarter stuff

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
goes through

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
Kickstarter campaigns

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
but you know what?

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
as the old saying goes

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
you can't make an omelet without breaking eggs

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
like the Steam store

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
and the whole review system is kind of screwed up

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
and so

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
I think they just need to make some decisions that may not be popular

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
but I think we'll clean it up

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
a lot

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
this kind of shit happens on iOS and Android

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
and their review sites and everything

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
so it's like

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
grow up, you're a publisher

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
publishing a game

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
fucking grow up and deal with this shit

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
so what?

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
people don't like a decision you make

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
hmm, maybe take that to the bank and figure out

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
oh, maybe we shouldn't do that next time

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
how about that?

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
because even in the case of

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
the Firewatch devs

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
yeah, you know

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
you are well within your right to, I guess

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
copyright strike something

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
however, it's kind of

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
fucked up being that on your website

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
you say, oh, you can go ahead and use our stuff

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
and it's kind of silly to do that

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
for a video that he made

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
a long time ago, it wasn't like

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
he was playing that game and then he dropped the

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
N-bomb, it was a totally

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
different, it's just, it's such a weird

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
that video still generates revenue

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
and so, you know

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
they don't want to be associated with him, you know

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
I think people forget that a lot of these

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
game companies are doing a favor

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
I don't think they would think that they're

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
associated with him, so he played one of their games

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
big deal, you could just say

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
I think, you know, what he said was terrible

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
leave it at that, done

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
no one, you don't have to go

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
any further, you were just an angry person

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
using the system incorrectly

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
because it's not a copyright strike

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
you gave

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
express copyright to these people

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
so

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
I'm sorry, you

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
get upset, that's it

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
I want to move on, but respectfully

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
I disagree because, again, I think

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
a lot, I think this whole

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
streaming situation could be a lot worse

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
when it comes to the copyrights than it is

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
I think a lot, I mean, look at what Nintendo does

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
I think Nintendo's an example of, you know, kind of

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
doing a lot of the worst of it, and a lot

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
of game companies could be doing that, but they're not

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
because I think they do realize, for the most

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
part, there's a lot of great publicity that comes from

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
gaming, but at the same time

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
we have a real fucking

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
big problem in this industry

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
right now with the toxic culture in gaming

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
and that particular

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
streamer is an excellent

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
example of that problem

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
and so for a game company to put their foot

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
down and say, you know what, fuck this

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
we're not going to be associated with this toxic shit

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
no matter if it's

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
you know, dated or whatever

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
the semantics may be

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
I'm okay with them

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
having done that, because

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
I stream video games

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
I kind of think the game developers are

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
doing us a big favor by letting us get away

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
with it, and making the amount of money

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
we do off games, and if someday

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
they come down and say, you know what Rob, you're going to have to

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
share a bigger chunk of

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
your revenue with the game makers, I'll be

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
fine with it, I'm not going to throw a hissy fit

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
as long as it's

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
as long as it is transparent

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
and clear, and the rules

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
are known, and you know

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
if a competitor has different rules then they are

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
known, as long as everything is

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
you know, out there

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
then I'm fine with it

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
you know what though, even if they do that kind of stuff

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
there's plenty of other games out there, there's so many

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
indie developers that would love the exposure

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
yeah, too bad

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
you know, you want to be a dick about it, and you're a big publisher

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
we don't need a player game

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
you don't need the exposure, you've already basically stated that

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
alright, anyway, I want to move on

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
and try to get back to the topic

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
at hand, which was the Steam reviews

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
and let's see, I want to

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
so, what were they saying here in chat

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
over at live.vognetware.com

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
SG100Matt says, can't they in theory

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
buy the game, review it, and request a refund

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
isn't that something that they're doing?

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
well, if they refund it, pull the review

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
but I think if you're going to abuse

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
that, you know, if you're going to

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
abuse that system, then

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
they may

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
revoke your privileges and do that

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
sorry, MXC says, I don't

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
believe you can review a game if it's not in your Steam

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
library, at least I can't do it when trying to

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
review a random, non-owned game

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
so, but I think you can

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
can't you like, add it through another process

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
you can add it into your Steam library through another

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
process or something like that

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
yeah, I don't know if you can still leave reviews

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
for that

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
alright, anyhow, let's move on

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
in the interest of time, let's talk a little bit about

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
the drama that was going on this week between

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
Player Unknown Battlegrounds and

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
Fortnite, with the whole

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
battle royale mode, and

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
I'm sure a lot of you guys are reading the blogs, you've

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
probably heard about this a little bit, but Fortnite

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
obviously is in an early stage of release

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
going to be going to early access

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
and they said, you know, kind of this week

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
they were talking about how they're dropping

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
a battle royale mode in this

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
and I've actually seen people streaming this, this is

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
something you can already play basically

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
well, the folks that

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
were behind Player Unknown Battlegrounds

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
not happy about what Epic

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
did, saying quote, we've also

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
noticed that Epic Games references Player Unknown

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
Battlegrounds in the promotion of Fortnite

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
to their community and in communications with the

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
press, this was never discussed with us

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
and we don't feel it's right

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
and so on and so on, so this

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
kind of caused a conversation on Twitter

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
and some places about the whole like

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
what are these Fortnite, or excuse me

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
what are these Player Unknown Battlegrounds guys doing?

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
Like, they don't necessarily

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
own the entire genre

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
competition is a good thing, blah blah blah

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
this concept was around

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
before you, blah blah blah

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
It's not necessarily that they're saying that they're

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
stealing the battle royale idea

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
what their problem is, is that they

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
licensed the Unreal Engine from

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
Epic Games, and

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
Epic is basically

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
gonna be making

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
their version of this and they're

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
basically relying on Epic

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
for hardware

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
troubleshooting and that type of stuff

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
troubleshooting with their engine

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
and so they're, I think, worried that

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
I don't know, that basically they're

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
either gonna steal ideas or

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
they're gonna make improvements to the engine

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
and not let this company

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
in on those improvements, I don't know

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
it sounded like a whole bunch of worrying about nothing

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
to me, I mean, it sounded like

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
they're just whining because there's another company

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
trying to come in, but like, exactly

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
the thing, it's like, dude

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
Player Unknown Battlegrounds

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
H1Z1, King of the Kill

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
was like a thing way before that

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
Well, I do want to clarify, because part of what you're

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
pulling from there was a clarification

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
that came out, and I think it's important to say

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
there was a follow-up with

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
the dev team with Player Unknown Battlegrounds

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
that follows up this a little bit, that came out a couple days ago

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
there was an interview with PC Gamer

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
where they say, quote, the first thing, and this is

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
actually an interview with, what's the name

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
CH Kim, who

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
is

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
one of the

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
I think one of the developers of the game

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
oh no, there it is, executive producer, thank you

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
that's Blue Holes VP

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
as well, so CH Kim said, quote

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
the first thing I'd like to clarify is that

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
this is not about the battle royale mode itself

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
there were other BR game modes

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
earlier this year that were released, like Last Man Standing

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
or Grand Theft Auto 5's battle royale game mode

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
and we never raised an issue, and I think it's great

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
that there's more competition and everyone

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
should be able to create their own battle royale game mode

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
it's not about the idea itself, it's

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
about epic games, and that

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
wasn't really clear, so that was a very

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
interesting clarification, which yeah, leads into

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
this whole talk about the Unreal Engine

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
and some of these other points that you brought up, so

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
just to be clear, because I feel like social media

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
didn't capture that follow-up

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
as much as they did the original story

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
and even one of the things that

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
Brendan Greene was saying is, he said

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
other companies of course will come out and

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
enter the marketplace, I just hope that they put

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
their own spin on the game mode and not just

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
make a carbon copy, and honestly

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
I feel that

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
Fortnite has, because they have the whole

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
building aspect of it, you can

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
build a base, although

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
I gotta be honest, with this type of

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
gameplay, it's pretty fast paced

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
it seems like, I don't know if I'm gonna be just

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
hunkered down in a base I build and it's like

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
shit, the battlefield got smaller

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
I guess it's cool for like throwing up some

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
cover or something like that, but

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
you're not gonna get too intricate in building a base

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
and stuff. I watched somebody playing a stream of it

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
the Fortnite Battle Royale, and yeah, they were

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
in a house and they kept taking the roof

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
off the house to kind of see if they could see

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
where the snipers were or what have you, and

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
then they would kind of like, they'd take the roof off a different

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
part of the house, they were kind of like rebuilding the house as they were

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
moving, and then finally some guy came

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
up the stairs in the house and killed him

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
because the guy was too preoccupied with

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
trying to find the other people through the roof

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
so yeah, but it was kind of interesting

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
and I was like, well, what I just described

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
that whole taking off the roof, and again

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
I don't think you could do that.

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
Yeah, so there you go

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
that's how it's a little different. You know what's also

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
interesting, Loki, is I can't help but be reminded

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
of, you know, going back in time

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
the old discussion we used to have on the show

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
about DDR vs. In the Groove, right?

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
Remember that whole thing when In the Groove first

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
came out, and you know, in all

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
honesty, you know, when the game first came out

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
I wasn't a big fan of it, because I felt it was

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
very reductive with DDR.

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
Now, much like

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
people's feelings evolve on things

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
and having talked to Kyle over the years

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
and so forth, my views on In the Groove

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
evolved significantly, and I understand

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
why it was important

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
and how it filled the void that Konami was

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
making, basically, by themselves.

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
But anyway, I digress.

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
I feel that if they didn't have the building

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
stuff aspect of Fortnite

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
and it was just, okay, it's in this

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
art style now, but we're basically copying

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
the gameplay, then yeah, I could see

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
them taking issue with it more, because, okay,

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
this is, you're just basically carbon copying

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
this, you just changed the art style now.

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
But they have more

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
gameplay aspects to it, and

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
you know, it kind of goes back

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
to, like, even Street Fighter 2

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
and, like, the old fighting games.

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
People got pissed, or

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
companies got pissed off because, oh, now

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
there's Mortal Kombat, and now there's all these

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
other fighting games that are basically kind of

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
stealing, if you will,

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
the style of the game, but

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
they're all different, but yeah, they're all kind of

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
the same in certain ways as well.

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
Just like this, I mean,

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
there's always been last man standing

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
game types and everything, from, like, Call of Duty

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
to somebody brought up something on the

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
Intellivision, like Armor Battle,

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
so this is not a new thing, and like,

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
let's be honest, I mean, Battle Royale,

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
that whole concept, anyways, that's from a

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
fucking movie. You guys

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
all fucking copied that bullshit, so

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
stop fucking saying, oh, your idea is

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
fucking original. This is not an original

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
idea. It's a well-done implementation.

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
Exactly. So, you know what?

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
Like, Mortal Kombat, the,

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
MortalKombat.X

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
is a well-done fighting game. So, here's what

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
you do, because this is what companies do

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
when there's competition. You make the best

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
fucking product you can, and stop bitching

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
about it. Stop whining that

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
fucking competition's coming, and step

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
up your fucking game and make a better

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
game. That's how you fucking win this.

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
Alright, I want to get to chat. Bobby Blackwolf

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
in chat, trying to kind of explain this in

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
his style, says, the biggest worry is that

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
Epic, who makes Unreal Engine, from which

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
PUBG uses,

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
PUBG, should I just say PUBG? PUBG, yeah.

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
I do want to say PUG, like a little pug, but it's PUBG.

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
PUBG. PUBG. Can't I say PUGBEE?

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
Can't I get it backwards?

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
Alright. Who makes Unreal

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
Engine, which PUBG uses,

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
will start with holding updates they

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
make to the engine from PUBG in order to make

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
Fortnite better. They'll make an update to the

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
engine for Fortnite and not share it with PUBG.

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
Granted, they haven't even

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
spoken to Epic about this. They went

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
straight to the press. And certainly

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
there's an issue with that as well, is

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
taking your case to the court

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
of public opinion. Well, let's be honest

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
here. You're going to make updates to the

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
engine anyway, because I don't believe the engine supports

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
100 player multiplayer. That's probably

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
something that you added in there. That's not something

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
that's stock in there. So you're making

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
updates to the engine too. So

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
yeah, they may make updates to the engine for

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
their game, much like you're

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
doing the same thing, but it's not like

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
they're going to be releasing it letting everybody else

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
have that update and not your company.

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
That's stupid.

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
And so what? So what? They

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
make updates to the engine for their particular

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
game. Wah!

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
Make a better fucking game. I don't understand

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
what the problem is.

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
I think it's inevitable that, you know,

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
a consistently top three

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
games streamed on Twitch is

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
going to bring challengers that won a piece

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
of that pie, just like what

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
League of Legends now has

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
Heroes of the Storm, Smite,

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
you know, things that are very similar in nature, which are

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
all Defense of the Ancients. Yes, I know. But

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
you know, League of Legends is kind of the first one that

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
Twitch was really taking off there. You know, but

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
here's the fascinating thing.

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
All those games,

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
League of Legends, Heroes of the Storm, Smite,

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
they all do very well on Twitch and they all do very

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
well for themselves in different ways.

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
Despite the fact that at its core, they're all

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
lane defense games.

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
It's just, you just make

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
a better game. Just make the best game you

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
can and let the,

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
let everybody decide.

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
And learn from it. Just like

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
learn, don't whine about

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
it, because if you whine about it, it just

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
comes off as fucking weak.

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
People

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
are doing the same thing as we are.

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
Yeah, like anyone who wasn't going to copy your idea,

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
that's how it fucking works. But do you think people

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
like, now that you hear this clarification about

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
it wasn't about the Battle Royale,

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
it was about Epic.

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
Doesn't that make you kind of feel like, okay, maybe

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
people on Twitter were going to,

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
and so forth, were going too far with it?

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
Like with this whole thing, like, but at the

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
same time, if they went to the

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
press and not Epic Games

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
to begin with, then they kind of only

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
set themselves up for this misunderstanding.

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
You know, I get it that they are worried that

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
they're going to make updates to the engine, but you know what?

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
If they don't release an update, you

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
can speculate whatever updates

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
that they're making on their side.

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
You can speculate all day long,

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
but I mean, eventually

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
they're going to release updates to it if it's

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
going to be beneficial for everybody using

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
that product because they want to sell the product.

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
But,

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
to think that

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
they're just going to purposely hold back

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
updates so that your game fails

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
is stupid.

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
You know what? You've done well enough by

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
yourself before that

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
they've released all this stuff. I don't understand

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
what the problem is.

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
Alright, going to Stoppy in our chat over at

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
live.hognetwork.com says, I think Sky's on to something.

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
Player Unknown's ground battles

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
make more sense. There's no combat

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
at sea or in air. See? Pugby.

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
It's not a puppy, it's a

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
pugby. Anyway.

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
You know what? I'll say this at the end of the day.

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
I remain interested

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
in both those games right now.

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
You know, I've watched a little bit of both on Twitch,

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
and I'm kind of interested in both of them.

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
So, I mean, when?

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
Question mark?

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
Alright, anyway.

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
Let's move on to another story for now.

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
Loki. So,

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
unfortunately there are some now

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
apps that aren't working with iOS

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
11. One of those apps

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
being the very popular, time-wasting

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
game Flappy Bird.

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
So, if you

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
update to iOS

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
11, it's not going to work because it's a 32-bit

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
app and not a 64-bit

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
app. And no plans from the

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
creator who walked away from that

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
game so long ago

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
to update it. That's too bad. I mean,

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
if only there were some

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
more Flappy Bird clones on

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
the iOS storefront. I mean,

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
it's too bad that no one's ever made one.

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
So, jeez. You know what? You could really

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
corner the market on this. It's too bad there

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
wasn't one right at vognetwork.com.

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
It's like the whole pub.

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
Which did you hear apparently no longer

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
works in most browsers. Oh, darn.

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
Bobby got into it on his show tonight.

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
I'll let you go listen to that. It's like

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
the whole PUBG situation. Man,

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
that sucks that they're the only game

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
out there and only will be the only game

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
ever. But yeah,

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
that's unfortunate.

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
I guess Android wins in this case. Well,

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
you know, guys, I think I found the trick

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
because right now,

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
right now, in the studio

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
on my phone,

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
I'm playing Flappy Bird

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
right now on my phone. That's right.

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
Oops, I died. On my

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
iOS phone, I'm playing.

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
You know how I did it? I didn't

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
upgrade to iOS 11 and I can still

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
play Flappy Bird. So,

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
if you want to still play that stuff, nobody's really

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
forcing you to upgrade. Now, look. Here's

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
the other thing. It's not really

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
just about Flappy Bird. Although,

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
I'm a little sad he's gonna update it, but you're right.

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
There's tons of clones and games out there that

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
have taken this formula and improved

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
on it. It was planned obsolescence. It's Apple

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
conspiring against Flappy Bird

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
because they're gonna release their own

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
Flappy Bird and it's gonna complete the

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
marketplace and they're gonna

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
Flapple. Flapple Bird.

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
It's not a

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
bird anymore. It's a community.

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
It's a meeting hub. A coffee

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
shop, if you will. Not so much

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
of a bird. It's you, actually.

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
It's you. It's your soul.

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
Yes.

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
Flapple.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
It flaps the soul.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Perfect.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Anyway.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
But no, the real reason is

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
the iOS updates are notorious

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
for always being buggy

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
when they first come out. Like, they drain your battery

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
or something happens. So, I'm sorry. I've learned

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
I didn't upgrade right away.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
And some people will say, you're an idiot, Rob. Well,

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
okay. Cool.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
But my phone still works and I'm playing

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
Flappy Bird and you're not.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
But, also, just case

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
and point, obviously I'm a big Pokemon Go

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
player. I mentioned that earlier in the show with

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
what I was playing today. There's, of course,

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
a huge bug with the Plus, the Bluetooth

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
thing, where there's like a three second

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
delay for people that are on iOS 11 where

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
it doesn't work right. So, I'm like,

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
you know what? For that reason alone,

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
with as much Pokemon Go as I play,

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
I'm not exactly in a hurry to upgrade

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
to the newest iOS on my

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
three-year-old device, the iPhone 6

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Plus. So, anyway.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Well, how will you swipe up

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
to do shit?

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
You just won't be able to.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Oh, no. It won't be as intuitive.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
I won't be able to record my screen

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
because I'm sure that's fucking smooth

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
on the

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
6 Plus. It probably works great

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
on the iPhone 8 and the iPhone 10

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
and all this, but it's just not, you know,

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
and as I said before, look, as much as

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
I'm giving this a little crap here,

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
I fully plan to buy the iPhone 10.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
I'm three years due for an upgrade

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
now. I'm gonna get that iPhone 10

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
and that fancy new screen, but

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
I'll just wait till then

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
for iOS 11. I don't need it now.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
How good Flappy Bird

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
could look on that screen?

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Sadly, the potential will never be realized.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Well, maybe what I'll probably do is that I'll

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
upgrade, you know, I'll get the iPhone 10 and then

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
what happens to my iPhone 6 Plus? It's basically

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
an iPad or an iPod

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
Touch at that point, right? There's no cell service

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
on it anymore. It's Wi-Fi. But I will forever

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
have this device to play

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Flappy Bird on. This phone in my hand

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
will be in a fucking museum someday

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
because I didn't upgrade it to iOS 11.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Marked my words.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
He stood up to Apple and said,

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
fuck you, I'm not updating.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
I will not go to

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
11. Come on, NoelGus

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
in chat talking about my problems with

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Pokemon Go and iOS

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
11 says that's Niantic, though.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Well, yeah, it is, but it's also just a

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
problem of what happens

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
with new OSes. They kind of

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
break some things that developers

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
would want to do. YYR in chat

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
says none of this should come as a surprise

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
for months now. Opening such apps on iOS

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
10 would display a warning. That is true

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
and you can still go in

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
and see

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
you can actually go into

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
I think it was, what is it? I'm looking at my phone right now.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
You go into settings and I think it's like

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
what is it? General

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
and

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
I don't remember what it is

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
from here. Somebody in chat will probably yell it out.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Is it software update? No, because I don't

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
want to update. Oh shit, I don't want to update.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Accessibility, maybe?

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
I don't remember what it is, but there's something you go into

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
and it actually shows you what

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
apps on your phone are not

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
going to upgrade. And what's interesting is that

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
ReRave, another music

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
game, is one of them that will not

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
upgrade, but

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
they put out ReRave Plus some time ago

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
so the old ReRave is kind of

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
done anyway. It's all about ReRave Plus at this

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
point, but I remember that was like the other big one

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
that showed up on the list.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Alright.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
ActDeftInChat speculates

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
that phones without iOS 11 will be

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
valuable like PlayStation 4 with

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
PT. Ooh.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
Good point, good point. Alright.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Didn't they try that though?

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Like people were selling their phones with

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
Flappy Bird when it got removed. I think

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
it was working for some people too.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
It's kind of crazy what people will buy.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Anyway, speaking of

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
things that only crazy people will buy,

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
the original Xbox

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
controller is coming back. The X-Brick

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
controller, that gigantic

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
did you ever have the original Xbox

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
with that gigantic freaking

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
controller? Check

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
it out. Look at a YouTube or something if you've never seen

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
it, but there was a gigantic controller for this

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
and it seems like it might be coming

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
back, sort of. The nickname for this

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
controller, the Duke, apparently

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
one of the original designers has actually

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
been trying to put the Duke back on

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Xbox One and Windows 10.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
Microsoft just gave it

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
the green light from Xbox designer

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
Sheamus Blackley.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
They had the Duke on the 360.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Well now it's coming back for the Xbox One.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
And an appropriate time too because

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
we know that original original Xbox

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
games are going to be playable on Xbox One

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
like Crimson Skies, right? So what

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
better time for this controller to come back. However

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
I do want to state out this will not be a Microsoft

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
product. This will be a peripheral

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
from Hyperkin who puts out

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
a lot of that stuff. Apparently they're now doing

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
that center thing that was like a jewel

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
thing with the Xbox logo. It's not going to be an

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
OLED screen. So that might be kind of neat.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Maybe they'll do some different stuff with that.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
I mean not that there's any like really

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
official second screen support within the

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Xbox because

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
what the hell? I don't even remember

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
the name of it. That app that

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
they had? Is that dead? It's clearly dead.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
I don't even remember the fucking name of it.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Screenplay? Screen?

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Oh my god.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
I can't even remember. That's how dead that thing is.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
But obviously it won't be supported

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
within the controller. But smart glass.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Thank you ActDeft. Winner winner

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Smart glass dinner.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
There it is.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Speaking of dead things.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Microsoft wants to

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
sell you a camera.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
They're testing USB

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
camera support for

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
streaming use on the Xbox One.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Because after all there's been

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
no cameras released for the Xbox

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
One. Ever. Ever.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
I mean Kinect but will

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
not. But Kinect got shoved in a

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
closet and locked. Let's forget

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
that even happened. We'll never be heard from again.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
But yes they're gonna support that so you can

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
do like facecam and stuff like that on

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
you know your game

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
stream. Oh so that thing that we hoped

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
the Xbox One would do when they first

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
removed Kinect a couple years ago.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Right? They're finally gonna

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
maybe do. I saw Kinect for the Xbox 360

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
for 8 bucks at Goodwill the other day.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Wow really? I almost bought it.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
Oh wait for the 360 not for the one.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
Oh ok I was like if that was for Xbox One

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
I might have actually went and bought it for Xbox One.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
8 bucks?

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
I could do without pumpkin spice

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
fraps for a couple days to do that.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Yeah I don't think it was the Xbox One. Oh bummer.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Bummer bummer. Not bad though.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
YYR in chat says

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
Kinect may never be heard from again

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
but it will keep listening.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
I think that was some people's concerns

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
with that device actually.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Alright. And

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
come on Noel Gus pointing out that Apple bought

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
the sensor company that made Kinect.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Hmm. Maybe

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
Apple Kinect.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Anyway moving on

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
to another story. This makes me

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
like really sad actually and that is

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
news that the Chinese

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Room which is a studio

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
in Britain that makes video

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
games such as probably their most

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
well known games are Everybody's Gone to the

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
Rapture and Dear Esther

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
have laid off their staff

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
and they are going dark for a few months.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
The co-founder of the Chinese

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Room Dan Pinchbeck made

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
a big blog post that talks about what's going on

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
saying that this is a temporary closure

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
it is something that's been in the works since earlier

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
in the year. The decision has to do with

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
financial pressures following a

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
health scare. Yikes.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
And so they're pausing things to recharge.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
He put quote to cut a long

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
story short the situation between

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
financial pressures trying to keep the lights

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
on for the employed team the stress

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
of end of development health issues

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
just wasn't a tenable thing anymore.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
It was time to take a break recharge recover

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
and have a good think about the

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
future. Chinese Room still

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
has two games in the works The 13th

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
Interior and Little Orpheus

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
it was assured in

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
the blog post that these titles are still going to

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
release as planned. He will interact

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
with the community through social media but the studio

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
is no longer in full active

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
development. The studio did assist

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
employees in trying to secure positions

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
elsewhere since I guess they'd known

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
for some time.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Trying to end on a happy note

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
Is it the end of the Chinese room? No

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
I don't think so but it's the end of a chapter

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
and we hope you all can be patient with us whilst

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
we figure out what happens next. And that makes

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
me sad because I thought everybody's gone

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
to the rapture was a brilliant game

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
and I understand not everybody's into the

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
walking simulators which you know

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
but I also think the internet has

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
kind of like a lot of mob

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
mentality online has really

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
given the walking simulator type

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
stuff like like it's just it's a well

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
done story at the end of the day

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
everybody's gone to the rapture is a really good story at the end

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
of the day and it's you know you can draw your own

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
conclusions from it you can either get

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
a lot of exposition or very little depending

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
on how you know thorough you are with the exploring

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
and so forth I think the soundtrack

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
is one of the most gorgeous soundtracks in a

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
video game so

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
there's an awful lot I really like about the game

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
so I think it sucks that you know the internet kind of

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
shits on this genre sometimes

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
when there's you know brilliant art

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
that comes out of it like this game and

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
you know I really hope that

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
backlash or whatever you want to call it I really hope

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
that didn't play into

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
what's happening to the studio now

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
it sounds like there may be some other issues

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
such as the health issues and so forth that are a lot more

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
scarier you know that are that are much bigger

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
than a video game and so forth so I get it from that

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
standpoint but hopefully

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
the upcoming releases the 13th

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
interior a little Orpheus

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
hopefully they're good you know

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
you know I'm not gonna be so

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
nice if the games aren't good but I if

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
the games are good which you know I enjoyed their other

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
games so I would hope I'd like these games to if

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
the games are good I hope it brings them the success

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
that they deserve to be able to do more

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
games in the future although it's gonna be weird if

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
they can't really have the same development team you know

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
so or maybe they'll be able to come back I don't know

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
so anyhow

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
little sad about that and the fact that

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
that developer is

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
kind of going through a big change right

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
now all right before we get to the classic

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
game of the week which I will be doing tonight in

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
Dark Sakura's Absence we have one more story from

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
Loki yes and this is kind of hopefully

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
the end of a

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
long stretch of stories we've been talking about

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
so going back to last

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
week we were mentioning that you know

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
first there was an NES emulator

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
that was found randomly within

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
the firmware of the

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
or yeah the

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
firmware of the NES

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Switch or the Switch and

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
they also had the NES game Golf

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
in there as well that was part of the Switch

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
and everyone's just wondering what the hell is this

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
why why is this in here

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
is this like something that's going to be coming out

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
you know are they going to have this

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
release or something well apparently

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
there is a little bit more to the

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
story so they figured it out

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
they figured it out yeah so

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
and almost by accident

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
someone had somehow launched

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Golf actually without any sort

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
of hacks and launched the game and they're

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
like wait how did you do that

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
you know no one believed them at first

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
and then they found all this stuff

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
so what happened was apparently

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
on July 11th

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
which is the

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
anniversary of

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
Awana's death

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
if on July 11th

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
if you make the

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
the little motion

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
the direct to you motion

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
the open hands

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
kind of going forward yeah if you

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
make that motion with the

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
Switch controllers

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
it'll launch the game

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
and it's only on July 11th

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
and it actually has to be on July 11th

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
if it's connected to the internet because it does check

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
you know the time against the internet

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
someone has managed to capture

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
this on video because he had a

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
Switch that wasn't connected to the internet

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
yet and so he set the date to

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
July 11th did the gesture

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
and sure enough it booted up

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
Golf that's awesome that's a really

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
neat truth you know some people were kind of weirded

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
out though by the fact that they did his date of death

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
as a tribute and not

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
like his birthday or you know

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
celebrating a type of other notable release

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
or just any time but

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
you know I think that's also maybe like a culture

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
thing as well like you know maybe it's a little

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
weird in our culture but in other

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
cultures sometimes

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
that's how you celebrate or

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
I think it was I was reading something about it like

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
it's almost like a good luck thing like

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
if you have that inspiration that's in your

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
console that it's actually or you know whatever it is

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
you develop that's actually like a good luck thing

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
but like you know in some cultures what we have like

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
we have holidays to celebrate dead people

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
like that's you know that's what happens so it's

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
it's interesting I wonder

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
if this would have ever been found

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
well I get I mean I get

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
this was the way it was supposed to happen I suppose

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
some guy randomly accidentally

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
gets it on July 11th and posts to a

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
message board nobody believes him

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
but then finally somebody digs in the OS and

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
finds no this guy there's something to it right

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
so I guess next

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
year on July 11th a lot of people are going to be

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
playing golf yeah

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
Dartetsuya in chat says I learned in Japan they

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
called it a Oma Mori a good luck

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
charm yeah Dartetsuya

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
says that's the term they were throwing around over on

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Japanese Twitter so there it is and of course

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
golf Iwata had made

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
golf just like he made yeah

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
I guess no there's a lot of people

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
that refuse to work on that game because they couldn't

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
fit it within the cartridge size but

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
somehow he managed to get the code to fit

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
alright well that's that is

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
that is awesome so I don't have a

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
clever follow up for that leading into our

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
classic game of the week so let's just get to our

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
classic game of the week

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
now every week

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
Dark Soccer dives into the video game vault and finds

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
a game that she thinks hey you little brats

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
you should be playing this game this week

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
but she's not here

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
so I'm taking over tonight because I thought

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
it would be good tonight to do a timely

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
submission perhaps a little bit for the classic

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
game of the week and I don't even know if Loki's

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
ever played this but we'll find out so the classic

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
game of the week nope sorry guys not Halo

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
classic game of the week is something a little timely

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
this week there's a very specific reason

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
why I picked this today

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
so the classic game of the week let's see if we can get

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
some of the voice synthesizer

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
in here to play

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
that's right

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
it is Star Trek

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
the 1982

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
release from Sega in

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
the arcades this is the Star Trek

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
strategic operations

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
simulator and it was

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
an arcade release in 1982 from

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
Sega but it was ported to a variety

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
of systems I know I had played

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
it on the Commodore 64 when I was

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
younger and it was also

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
on I think it was on the

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
Apple as well

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
it was on the Vectrex

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
I think it was on Atari 2600 as well

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
no I don't think it was on the Vectrex it was on the ColecoVision I know

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
that what's interesting about this game

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
it looks like

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
Star Wars which was around

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
the same time but Star Wars was

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
Atari if I remember right

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
these just both happen to be vector based games

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
but the interesting thing that made

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
Star Trek a little bit different is that in

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
the Star Trek arcade game you actually

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
had like a split screen thing

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
going on you had a map in the upper right

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
you had in the upper left like a

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
bar that showed how many photon torpedoes

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
you had and how many like laser beams and all that stuff

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
you had and then you had your actual

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
like view play was on the bottom

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
and so remember this was 1982

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
in the arcades this is a little bit unheard

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
of at the time to basically have like

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
second screen type of stuff that was built

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
into the game or actually tertiary screens

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
in this case

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
so that's kind of what made this game unique

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
I don't think that this game was ever as popular

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
as Star Wars was

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
which was around

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
the same year or the year later but

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
I think it was pretty cool just how like involved

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
this game was so

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
what you did in this game you got multiple views

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
of the play field and of course

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
you have to use and manage your shield energy

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
and photon torpedoes and warp energy

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
you can replenish these by docking with

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
star bases but the Klingons

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
aren't only attacking you

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
they're actually attacking the

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
star base as well so you have to be careful

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
and you can actually kill your star base by friendly

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
fire so you have to be careful

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
this game was actually controlled with a weighted

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
spinner so it wasn't really like a joystick

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
you actually had a little spinner and that's how you use the ship

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
heading control and then you have buttons

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
to do the impulse engines, warp engines

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
phasers and photon

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
torpedoes the warp button

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
was set a little bit away from the other

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
buttons that way you had

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
to actually like you intentionally

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
go and hit it and you wouldn't be hitting it on accident

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
especially if you're in the moment

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
you want to make sure you don't accidentally hit that

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
so there you go and then

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
this was translated on a variety of

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
different systems an early

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
review in the magazine Electronic Games

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
said that this is sure to be a top

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
grocer in the arcades this year if you can

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
squeeze through the crowd around the machine you may

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
never want to leave I

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
don't I mean again I can

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
only go back by my old memory

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
but I don't think this game

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
ended up being as popular in

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
the arcades at the time but I remember

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
it was a game it seemed like a lot of people did have

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
on like home consoles and stuff like

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
obviously we added on Commodore 64

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
it was on Atari 2600, Apple II

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
you know kind of those early

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
YYR

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
and Chad is like freaking out going

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
holy shit I played a Commodore 64 version of this

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
and didn't remember it at all until

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
just now see there you go classic

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
game of the week awakening memories

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
deep inside you even some you may not

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
want since 2002

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
the

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
designer of this game Sam

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
Palihannuk I hope I said that

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
right who did this for Sega

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
which ended up developing and publishing the game

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
and

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
there you go I don't know what else to say about it

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
but obviously I have picked this game

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
tonight because of the fact that

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
I know many people are probably not

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
listening to OLR tonight because they're watching

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
the Star Trek Discovery which is the new

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
TV series is airing tonight

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
which is a little bit controversial

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
because I know it's going on the CBS all

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
access thing and people are like I don't

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
really want to pay for another

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
$10 a month thing

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
but you know despite that controversy

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
I do think it's great that Star Trek

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
you'll just have to do what Game of Thrones fans do

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
and pirate it probably pirate the shit out of it

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
but anyway I just think it's great that Star Trek

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
is coming back to television and of course

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
I'm going to leave the rest of that discussion to our

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
friends at the Starboard Power Coupling

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
podcast we played their commercial last week

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
and they are very excited to be back this week

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
with their discussion on the first

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
maybe first two episodes actually because I believe

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
not you get the first episode on TV

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
but then on CBS all access the first two episodes

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
are going to be there so I think they may discuss both

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
this week on Starboard Power Coupling

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
so look forward to

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
that. Anyway there it is

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
your classic game of the week Star Trek the arcade game

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
from 1982 a strategical

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
operations simulator and I'm being very specific

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
because there's been like 50 Star Trek games

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
so that's the one specifically I'm

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
calling out.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
To register participation for

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
this week's episode of Orange Island Radio at

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
vognetwork.com use the pass phrase

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
Sprout.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat saying the Orville

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
greater than Discovery

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
you know what I haven't seen either one

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
and I don't think you've seen Discovery

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
yet so I think it's a little early to say that

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
but I do think it's

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
interesting that the Orville

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
the reason why people seem to

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
like it is that it has a lot

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
of the essence of what people really like about

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
Star Trek I mean granted it's in a separate universe

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
or what have you but it's interesting

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
because it is on Fox which is over the

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
air and it's kind of doing something that Star Trek

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
Discovery isn't and I just I really

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
hope that decision by CBS doesn't

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
like fuck Star Trek

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
forever because of this decision

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
so I'm kind

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
of hoping because I don't know if you know this

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
but in every other country but the

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
US maybe Canada as well

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
I can't remember what the deal is in Canada but

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
I think every other country besides those two

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
Netflix is going to have the Star Trek show

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
so in every other country you'll be able to watch it

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
on Netflix and

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
so yeah you don't have to worry about getting a separate

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
service because it'll be on the one that most people have

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
so I wonder if this show isn't going to do

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
very very very well in other countries

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
but I guess CBS

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
already made a good like they spent like eight

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
million dollars on this show well six

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
million of it came from the Netflix deal so

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
yeah right anyway

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
alright

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
oh yeah that's right and somebody did explain this

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
to me Bob Blackwell says it airs on cable

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
TV in Canada so they have like

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
a cable TV channel up there I think

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
one of my buddies up there I think was even telling me about this

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
and I just forgot because I don't have a good memory

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
alright

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
and Kaijuto in chat points out I use

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
CBS access for Big Brother it's cool

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
you can watch a lot of crap on it and admittedly

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
yeah I got CBS all

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
access for Big Brother as well and

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
do you know how lit that celebrity version

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
of Big Brother is going to be I mean it's

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
it's Olympics counter programming so it's going to be on

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
the same time when a lot of people are distracted

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
by the Olympics but instead of

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
just trying to air these shows that nobody's going to

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
watch because the Olympics are on CBS is going to try to

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
do you know celebrity Big Brother which stands

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
but that's going to be on it'll

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
be on TV but the live feeds will be on

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
CBS all access and that's going to be nuts

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
because that's celebrities

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
you know in the big well I say

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
celebrities but it's going to be celebrities

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
if rumors are to be believed

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
Tiffany Pollard

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
or New York who's one of my faves

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
I think she'll do fantastic

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
Lance Bass

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
Dog the Bounty Hunter

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
some gal from Mob Wives but again

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
these are rumors and who knows what's

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
going to change before this is really on TV

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
so it'll be interesting but

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
I mean maybe if celebrity Big Brother

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
brings people to CBS all access then

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
people will be like oh shit this is the Star Trek thing too

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
I guess I should watch this but I feel like

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
most of the Star Trek fans will have just pirated

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
it before that that's just the reality

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
I don't know we'll see

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
anyhow we're going to

myself and Loki with you here tonight

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
Dark Soccer is out sick

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
but I hope she feels better a lot soon

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
although I notice over

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
where Dark Soccer usually sits

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
during the show I notice my husband Alan

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
has his ASMR

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
stuff all set up do you know what this is

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
Loki the ASMR have you heard of this?

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
this is something I've just been learning more about

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
recently is it's this whole okay so I guess

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
like there's this um you can find these YouTube

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
videos out there and it's um you know

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
it's people that are talking they're talking

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
very softly into a

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
microphone and uh

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
what the way they talk the way they talk

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
it's supposed to like make chills go

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
down your spine and like

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
but they'll do things like it's not just the talking but then it's like

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
they'll like rub things they'll

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
rub the microphone it's like this I guess

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
supposed to be like and people say it's like a massage

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
for the brain I know I understand I know the

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
feeling but like I don't know

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
well the first video I ever saw was this lady who

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
eats a pickle really slowly and

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
like you know she's

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
and this is like the noise of the pickle

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
is like but like see some people that would

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
drive them nuts that noise

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
because like you know some people don't like to hear other

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
people eat like I have a friend who really hates that

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
but um you know I just I can't help

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
but you know think of that but anyway so

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
so Alan has likes to

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
watch these videos and I guess I guess

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
some people feel it and some people don't so

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
Alan's kind of one of the people that feels it and

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
but now he makes he likes to

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
make the uh slime stuff he sees

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
in some of the videos cause that's

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
I guess gives him that texture type feedback

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
so if you ever wondered what

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
happens to Jamie's spot during the week when

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
she's not here it turns into

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
I keep calling it ass master

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
cause ASMR turns into

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
it's ass mister it's ass mister

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
I like that better it's cause cause people

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
are gonna get a different impression if I say Jamie's

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
share turns into ass master when she's not here

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
but no it's it's ASMR headquarters

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
uh ass mister so there it is

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
so uh going to our chat over

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
at live dot vog network

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
dot com uh active to chat says

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
it's ASMOLR do you know how much

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
money those YouTubes make

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
like if you do like that

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
that lady who makes the pickles that

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
that video probably has millions of hits

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
like she could probably fucking retire

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
off eating pickles on YouTube like it's crazy

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
it's people that play toys yeah

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
play with toys and film it

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
and my son watches the shit out of that crap

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
it's so like oh my gosh it's so

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
and it's a never ending cycle

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
too cause you get your kid to play

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
with toys and then the companies pay

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
you know that

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
or pay you for that and then they also send you free

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
toys to promote it never ends

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
I need to do that Legos

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
I need to do it seriously Legos

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
have been like crack I am a fucking crack

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
addict when it comes to that shit

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
that might be a fun thing to stream is Lego

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
building like stream it on Twitch and then archive

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
it on YouTube they do that

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
sometimes they'll do speed builds and stuff

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
but like yeah but it's not me I'm funny

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
I mean it

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
takes a long time though like the last I put together

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
took 12 hours wow

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
cause it was a big set uh let's see

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
Bobby Blackwolf points out there was a guys on

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
a show episode about people chewing one

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
now you know which one of my friends I was referring to a moment ago

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
alright anyhow people

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
chewing I don't remember guys on a show episode

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
about chewing I don't remember I don't remember

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
I think it was I think it was like the discussion

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
at the top of the show I don't think that was the main topic

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
of the show but I think it came up at some point

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
during the show anyway I missed that show

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
I do really want to bring it back you guys but you know

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
Xverse has just been really busy as have I

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
so I don't want to go

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
too far down this road but I did mention

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
at Dragon Con I was you know finding a lot of inspiration

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
and it's part of the reason why I

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
want to get more motivated to do this segment

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
for you know Pogo Podcast I'm doing

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
but I am

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
considering adding another podcast to the

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
platter I'm in that mode now

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
where I think I have an idea in my

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
head and the little hamster

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
gears are turning so we'll see

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
anyway alright

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
let's move on

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
we're going to get into

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
some more news rapid fire news

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
in fact starting with Loki

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
so here's a mobile game we haven't heard of in a while

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
but Super Mario Run

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
is getting an update that's right

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
they're adding a whole new world

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
don't you dare close

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
your eyes a whole new world

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
I see no right as I said that I was like oh my god

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
he's going to do that and sure

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
enough not disappointed whatsoever

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
have I

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
become predictable after 700 episodes

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
of this show?

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
no I'm just using my

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
wife doing that kind of crap

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
so the new one is going to be

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
they said it's going to

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
have like a remix 10

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
is what it's called so

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
it's

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
basically bite sized sections

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
of the game's current levels with new bonus

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
medals so they have repeatable

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
challenges and they're also adding a new playable

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
character Princess Daisy will become

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
a playable character as well

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
and so also with that you're going to be able to

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
play your own music in the background

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
instead of the game music

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
and when you do

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
that your characters will

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
they'll wear headphones so they have a picture

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
of Mario with headphones on

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
headphone Mario

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
beats by Bowser

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
I like that beats by Bowser

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
and then of course if you haven't jumped into the game yet

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
they're going to be marking it on sale

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
September 29th it's going to be half price

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
so $5 instead of $10

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
so check it out

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
alright and then

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
with the prevalence

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
of Wii U emulators

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
there is

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
a whole ton of shit

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
that they've been doing with the whole

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
Wii emulation or Wii U emulation scene

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
and of course one of the games that's

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
gotten a lot of focus is

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
the whole Breath

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
of the Wild so

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
Breath of the Wild runs fantastic in emulators

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
in fact they've gotten it to run 4K and all sorts

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
of things and now modding has

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
become a part of that so

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
all sorts of mods in there there's a few new character

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
mods including putting

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
CJ or Carl Johnson from

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
Grand Theft Auto San Andreas

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
in the game or Steve from Minecraft

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
and they have

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
a picture with Link wearing Cappy

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
and a mustache

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
as well do they have the mod like

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
they have in Skyrim for like maybe

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
when the red moon happens it's Macho Man

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
starts playing no

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
they don't have that yet but I mean it's

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
it's interesting and then the moon turns into

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
Randy Macho Man Savage oh yeah

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
see all these different mods for the game

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
I want to see some for Mario Kart

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
I wonder if they've got some for that but

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
yeah I haven't played

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
on my emulator in a while

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
but it runs really well in my system

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
so I need to maybe go back

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
and check that out again

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
I'm having a laugh at this conversation in chat

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
YYR in chat says is Headphone Mario wearing

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
anything besides the headphones

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
and Corky follows that up with yes

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
his mustache

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
alright moving on to some other rapid fire

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
stories for the week you know I

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
didn't miss this one you guys from Tokyo Game

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
Show it's not specifically about

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
Sony but I'm very excited to

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
hear about Kunio-kun the world

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
classics collection it's going to come out on

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
and PC it's 11

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
Kunio-kun classics

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
and if you don't know what Kunio-kun is

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
well then let me tell you about the four

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
western games also

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
included as bonus titles that weren't released

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
in Japan that are part of this collection

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
and you'll know real quick what Kunio-kun

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
is Renegade

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
Super Dodgeball

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
River City Ransom and Crash and the

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
Boy Street Challenge that's right it's the

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
little characters from River City Ransom and Super Dodgeball

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
so of course they've had some more games

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
that have been released over in Japan there's

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
like several dodgeball games there's a hockey

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
game a soccer game so anyhow all

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
the games in the Kunio-kun collection will have support

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
for online play as you clear

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
missions in the title you can customize your avatar

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
and your game screen and

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
additional replayability elements as well so

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
that's really exciting especially I'm very excited to hear it's

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
coming out on Switch because

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
then that's something that you can take with you on the go

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
as well and you know these are

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
older games anyway so it's not like you're gonna

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
need the biggest technology to play them

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
so that's very very cool

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
what else could be cool

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
speaking of the Nintendo Switch

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
apparently a Netflix customer

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
service rep so take it

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
with a grain of salt cause it's not like it's you know

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
a director of you know

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
publicity or something a Netflix

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
customer service rep told Go Nintendo

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
or a user at that site anyway

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
that Netflix is locked

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
and loaded for the Nintendo Switch

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
Netflix been trying to get permission

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
from Nintendo to launch the app on the

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
console but no results yet

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
once Nintendo approves it

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
the Netflix Nintendo Switch app will launch

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
and be added to the eShop I honestly

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
but no surprise here I think the only

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
surprise out of this is that somebody

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
at Netflix is saying something about it

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
but you guys customer

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
service sometimes is outsourced

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
to other companies so

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
with all due respect this

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
person may have no

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
additional information that you or I have

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
usually the customer service

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
reps the thing is that those positions you know

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
phones they tend to be very high attrition

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
so people come and go basically you know

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
so you don't always give them the secrets

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
because they're the folks that tend to leave

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
and go somewhere else you know what I mean

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
so they usually find things out

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
the day everybody else finds them out so

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
it's a little weird to me that they

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
would know about this but you know

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
they might know a guy in another department

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
or something you know but regardless

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
it was probably inappropriate of them to say

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
something about this on the outside

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
but at the same time

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
is this really shocking news

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
that Netflix is probably

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
not the holdout about

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
Netflix being on the Switch

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
does that surprise you Loki to hear that

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
Netflix is not the problem with

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
Netflix on the Switch is not Netflix

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
does that surprise you

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
yeah it does? no

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
oh okay I was like

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
surely you're being sarcastic

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
of course I am Loki don't fuck with me tonight

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
I'm not in a good mood alright just kidding

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
uh yeah

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
says I'm sure Netflix

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
on Switch is inevitable

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
says I think it would be more shocking

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
if Netflix didn't have an app

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
ready I'm just curious again

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
I know I've said this a thousand times but I'm

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
very curious about the whole fact like will you

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
really be able to pick it up and take it on the

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
go with you I mean in the house certainly

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
it would still work off wifi but

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
I mean like something like Riverdale

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
which you can download to your device

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
can I pick that up and leave the house

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
and watch it because maybe it's buffered

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
in the background like at a certain point

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
the Switch will tell me like boom

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
the episode's completely downloaded and I can pick it up

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
and take it with me on public

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
transit wherever I want to go

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
oh no we'll see

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
sounds like it's up to Nintendo to tell

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
us that you can download it to the Switch's

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
massive 32 gigabytes of storage

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
well believe it or not those movies

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
are not very big there may be

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
less than a gigabyte so

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
you know you could download a couple things

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
you can't download a lot but you get to have one or two things

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
at a time that's not crazy so

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
anyhow let's go

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
and travel around the world and check out some

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
video games coming out in other countries

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
like the US to start Loki

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
yes and so this is probably a game that

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
Jamie is playing Danganronpa

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
PlayStation 4, Xbox 360 and

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
Xbox One

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
Gundam Versus on PlayStation 4

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
This isn't really counted as a release but because

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
you know the whole Super NES

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
Classic Edition is coming out on Friday

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
they also mention Star Fox 2

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
which I guess technically is being released

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
but that's kind of a stretch

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
That is a little bit of a stretch but I guess

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
I did want to mention though, since you're a fan

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
Cults of

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
Revolt is coming out the following week

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
on 3DS

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
I am excited about that

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
I know they were promoting that a little bit on

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
it has its own little

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
3DS collectible puzzle piece

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
thing and all that

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
too, so that's pretty exciting

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
Alright, let's travel to Japan and check out

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
what is going to be coming out in Japan

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
and let's see, looking at

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
the list for

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
September the 28th

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
we have coming out Fire Emblem Musou

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
is out in Japan, I believe that is on

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
PlayStation 4

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
I'm sorry, that is a new

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
Nintendo 3DS game, sorry my list

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
this week doesn't have it separated by

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
what platform they're on

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
so it's a little more challenging for me

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
so that is on the new 3DS this week

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
also coming out this week we have

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
NAC 2, gets its Japanese release on the

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
28th, there's also

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
Fire Emblem Musou in a premium box

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
so that is something to look forward to as well

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
which is on the Switch as well as the 3DS

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
they have a game called

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
Nora Princess and Stray Cat

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
comes out this week

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
and that is on the PlayStation Vita

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
looks like it might be based off an anime

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
and then also in Japan

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
Fallout 4 gets a new game of the year edition

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
so it's like a price reduction

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
so that is coming out as well

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
that's basically the game and DLC

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
they're releasing over here too

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
that whole thing is out in Japan as well

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
and then of course FIFA 18 will be a big release

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
and that is out on the PlayStation 4 this week

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
let's take a trip over to the UK

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
Loki

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
Alright, so we have Evalkyrie Warzone

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
on PC and PlayStation 4

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
Lightfield on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
Ruiner on PC, Xbox One, PlayStation 4

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
on the Switch

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
we have the original Mario Brothers

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
also a game

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
on PC called

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
Twickles

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
I guess

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
Picross S on the Switch and

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
Blue Reflection on PC

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
Alright, let's go to the mailbag

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
because you guys

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
sometimes you send us emails

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
and all the time

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
we like to read them

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
You can send us an email

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
by emailing us at participate at

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
orangeloungeradio.com

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
Usually DarkSakura is here to read your emails

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
but since she's under the weather tonight

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
I will be filling in those duties in her place

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
Let's start with an email from Martin

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
the Belgian who emails us this week

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
Dearest OLR, congratulations

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
on reaching 700 episodes

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
It is an epic milestone and not

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
many podcasts will ever reach that many episodes

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
It is a testament to how committed

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
you guys are and it is great to see

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
you have built a real sense of community

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
for so many listeners every Sunday night

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
Like gathering with a group of friends

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
around a campfire and sharing stories

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
Perfect. I have been listening to

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
this show for probably close to 10 years

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
at this point and it has definitely become a part

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
of my Monday mornings as I wake up at work

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
and listen to the podcast. Thank you for always

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
being there to provide some Monday morning

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
entertainment. Rob, it was great meeting you

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
in person at DragonCon. Having listened

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
to you guys for so long I was definitely a little

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
nervous and starstruck

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
meeting you and Bobby in person

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
Sorry if I was a bit awkward. Next year we

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
should go and have some shots of Stroopwafel

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
together. Keep up the great show

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
as always. Hugs, Martin the Belgian

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
You didn't strike me as nervous or

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
awkward at all. So

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
I'm actually only regretful

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
I didn't get to spend more time

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
with people but they were kind of

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
for logistical reasons I don't fault

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
them for it at all. They kind of had to shoo us off the stage

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
to prep the next panel

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
Right? So

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
What we really need to do I think one of the best things

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
we ever did was remember the year

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
we went to PAX in Seattle

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
That was 2008. That was the year I was really sick

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
So we went to PAX in Seattle and we were with

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
All Games then

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
Wasn't the All Games broadcast

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
going the whole time? I think

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
Bobby was doing them. Yeah they had this whole

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
side table thing that was in the hallway

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
And other shows that were on the network at the time

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
were coming and going. So that was the whole thing we were doing that year

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
And the reason why I bring it up is that

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
one thing I remember we did is we did like a dinner

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
Somewhere one night where we actually

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
Yeah I remember that. Yeah it sounded like

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
an Asian restaurant. Yeah and we got

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
to meet a bunch of listeners and it was like

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
hey we're going to go to this dinner place

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
Of course then when the check came out it was a nightmare

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
to split but

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
maybe we could find a counter diner place or something

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
we could find a place to go eat at

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
together and say we're going to have the

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
vog dinner at XYZ time

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
during Dragon Con. I think that would be really cool

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
except for the fact that Dragon Con is so fucking crowded

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
to do something like that you probably

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
have to go like a ways away from

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
the main center venue. But I don't know

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
you know my fifth year at Dragon

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
Con I'm learning more tricks about where

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
to eat and that if you walk a certain

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
direction just like two blocks away

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
you're going to find restaurants with no weight

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
whatsoever because like everybody is

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
in that fucking peach tree center or

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
you know wherever so

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
yeah so anyway I bring that up because

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
I think it would be really cool to maybe do something like that

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
in a future year like

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
next year because we already have

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
vog suite booked for 2018

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
so we're coming back

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
next year and hopefully we'll still get to be a part

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
of the podcast track and that will be

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
awesome and you know I say to

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
people that meet us for the first time like

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
realistically like first

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
off there's no need to be starstruck we're gaming

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
fans just like you guys we just started this show

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
so long ago but I'm very honored that

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
people like get excited you know

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
since I also kind of get it like you've been

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
listening to us but you've never met us for maybe

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
10 years that's a very long time so

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
like I get it but you know trust me

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
we're not we

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
don't pay our bills with anything we

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
make from this show so until we're at that level

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
I don't think we're really that famous so

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
we're probably just as starstruck to meet you

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
as you are to meet us for what it's

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
worth but yeah my coworker the other day I like

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
told him about how we had 700 episodes like

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
so you guys making money off of that I'm like

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
no why not

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
you should other podcasts do look at

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
like Joe Rogan's like

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
yes yeah

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
Joe Rogan

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
I don't think it works like that you can't just like

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
just do that

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
okay I'm just gonna make money now

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
maybe you can but like eh

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
sorry

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
I'm laughing cause in chat act

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
deft in chat says winner winner chicken

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
dinner and that's what we can have at DragonCon

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
I love it

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
only if it can be like southern fried

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
chicken there you go alright

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
moving on one more email this week

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
from Sam it's short and sweet

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
but I'm gonna read this anyway from Sam

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
hello OLR crew show 700

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
was very special just because it was

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
a regular show good call

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
do any of you think well first off thank you for

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
that you know like I

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
I somehow sometimes I think that's the best way

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
to do it to just acknowledge the

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
big event and then do what people

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
show up for every week you know I think if we

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
had spent three hours just talking about ourselves

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
or doing a retrospective

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
or something it just wouldn't that's not the show

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
you guys necessarily signed up to hear

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
um retrospectives are good though

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
don't get me wrong but those can be like

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
specials or something like and sometimes

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
we do those too remember we did that marathon show

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
for nine hours that was pretty great alright anyway

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
um so moving

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
on with Sam's email do any of you

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
think Nintendo should have put the

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
NES and SNES classic systems

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
on the Switch to increase

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
sales thank you Sam

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
uh well Sam I think that's kind of a

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
common complaint here at Orange Lounge Radio

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
uh is kind of one of those

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
what are they doing when we see that the NES

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
and the Super Nintendo games they're on the Wii

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
they're on the Wii U but for whatever reason

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
they're not on the Switch um and

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
I think I've said this before on the show and I'm going to say it

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
again is that don't get your hopes

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
up that those NES and SNES classic games

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
are going to show up on the Switch at least

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
not in the same way um

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
we know that Nintendo is working on

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
something with this whole online system that they're

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
doing that you're going to be able to play games

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
uh it sounds like NES games like

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
Balloon Fight I think is one that they've kind of shown

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
that you'll be able to play it across the internet

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
okay basically and that's going to be the new thing

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
the thing we said virtual consoles should have done like

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
ten years ago they're finally going to be bringing

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
into that but that may not

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
be virtual console

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
I think if Nintendo does

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
virtual console for Switch it's going to

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
be Gabe Cube games

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
maybe Wii games if

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
that you know the HD

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
you know the control system kind of works with

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
Wii if they emulate that alright um

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
you'll have that

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
uh but like GameCube games and like

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
the newer Nintendo games I don't think

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
you're going to have the older stuff that is

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
going to be reserved for the online component

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
um which

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
will because you're going to be paying a monthly

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
fee for that uh it may or may not

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
overlap really with the NES and

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
the SNES classics yeah I think

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
we've been sitting here for a while going it would

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
be great if Nintendo just

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
releases a bundle on the Switch that's

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
all these classic games and I think

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
people would be very happy um

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
but Nintendo is gonna

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
Nintendo and sometimes the things

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
that they do don't always make sense to us

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
well at least from what

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
I've been hearing just following the whole

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
SNES classic thing it does sound like

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
that they are getting a lot more systems

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
per location

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
at least everybody that's been posting

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
online they've said you know my

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
GameStop only got nine NES

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
classic editions they're getting 30 of

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
the SNES so and a lot of

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
the other locations like Walmart and Best Buy

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
are getting you know double digit

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
numbers you know significant double

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
digit numbers so okay

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
hopefully that's a good sign

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
so fingers crossed this may be

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
I'm actually gonna try I'm just gonna

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
for the fuck of it I'm just gonna stop by Walmart

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
on that day

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
just to see if it's there just to see

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
and I'm not getting my hopes up or whatever

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
I'm just gonna see is it is curious

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
here's my question is it limited

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
to the places that Nintendo was saying

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
or like would you be able to find

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
it at more independent stores or maybe

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
even other chains like Fries

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
is one that comes to mind because Fries maybe

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
I always forget that Fries has the

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
same fucking games everybody else does Fries

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
maybe I would think like big box

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
stores are gonna probably have it independent chains

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
are usually third rate

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
when it comes to publishers

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
so they're gonna supply the big box

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
stores first actdeft in chat says

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
you'll probably have better luck at Target and you

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
know what I tend to agree you'll probably have

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
better luck at Target you know what

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
I don't know if the Target app still does it but it

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
used to cause that's how I found a Wii U

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
you could go into the Target app and it'll tell you

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
like it's in stock at this store or it's not

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
I may try that

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
just for fun

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
I'm curious I you know

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
if you're gonna go to Walmart I'm gonna tell you

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
exactly which one to go to I don't mean to get too local

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
but do you know how we joke about the Walmart

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
in the middle of nowhere

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
the one over by Anatolia

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
no it's not over there it's over like you gotta

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
go like um okay so

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
oh yeah yeah

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
you go but you go the other way

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
down and there's a Walmart out there where you're like

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
where's the fucking people out here there's no

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
people try that one

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
cause that would be the one I would try

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
that's a little out of my way but

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
yeah I just figured I'd try the one by my house

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
since it's right by my house

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
ooh SSU100Matt with a good point

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
in chat saying doesn't help that this Friday is

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
Yom Kippur oh I didn't

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
realize that but that's right

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
some people are gonna be doing

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
things related to that and they can't necessarily

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
just go out shopping so hmm interesting

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
alright

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
anyway oh YYR points out though it's Friday

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
night into Saturday so I guess maybe

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
you could go out in the morning but you're not gonna

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
be able to maybe hunt all day long so

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
alright anyhow that was it for emails

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
tonight thank you guys for the emails

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
send us more for next week participate

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
at Orangeloungeradio.com

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
if you wanna participate with Mailbag next week

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
we do have some more news for you guys before we get

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
to the Skype line at Orangeloungeradio

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
let's get to Loki with the next story

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
so as we were talking about the whole steam review changes

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
and stuff and how people are review bombing stuff

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
one of the games that came out of course was NBA 2K18

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
there was a huge backlash after

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
their whole virtual currency

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
this is literally what they call it because they

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
couldn't think of anything creative to call it

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
was kind of fuck

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
fake money didn't fly

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
it was kind of fucking up everything because

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
one of the big gripes with this they've been doing

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
virtual currency since 2K13 but one of the big

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
gripes is that the

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
virtual currency this time around they're really

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
whoring that shit so like

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
it would take several games

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
of actually planning to earn that virtual currency

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
to actually level up and that's only if you

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
like got the best stats in the game

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
whereas it could take several

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
hours of grinding

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
on top of that the stuff that you get

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
and unlock the different customizables

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
they're

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
not transferable between

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
your characters and like the haircuts in the game

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
instead of actually unlocking the haircut

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
they'll toggle it on and off and stuff

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
they're going the whole Destiny 2 route

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
and they are

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
consumables so you get your haircut

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
which originally was costing

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
you know I think

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
it was like 500 VC or something

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
like that so it was one game

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
but now they've dropped the price

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
of the actual haircuts down to

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
100 VC

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
oh haircut I'm sorry it was 1500

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
originally so they would give you like

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
I think five or six thousand to begin with

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
and then now they're

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
kind of dropping the prices of all that

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
because people aren't too happy with it

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
and they're looking to see about maybe changing

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
some of the other balancing it still sucks

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
so that they're doing this and don't support it

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
well I guess at least the company's

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
kind of listening to the feedback for better

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
a little bit but like I mean they've been doing it this long

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
they just have to find the right balance

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
between fucking over their

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
consumers and them noticing

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
alright

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
well moving on this week a lot of people's

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
childhoods

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
got a harsh taste of

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
reality this week and I'm sure you all

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
know

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
it's a little quiet and coming through but

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
the Toys R Us song

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
I don't want to grow up I'm a Toys R Us kid

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
well you're going to have to grow up and face the facts

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
that sometimes when you don't pay your bills you go bankrupt

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
so that

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
is what's happening with Toys R Us and it's unfortunate

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
because you know

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
I think a lot of us have fond memories

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
of going to Toys R Us

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
and pulling the tag for a game

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
do you know did I tell you when

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
Shane and I went to Chico because he was

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
hunting for Power Rangers when we drove up to Chico

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
which is like a good 90 minutes two hours away from here

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
we drove up there on a search for some

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
damn Power Rangers toys

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
but we freaked out when we went to the gaming section

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
because we were like oh my god they still have tags

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
here that you pulled to take up to the front

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
what the fuck this is a time capsule

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
there weren't a whole lot of department

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
stores like it wasn't like this

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
this is before like the whole Walmart

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
and Target thing I mean Toys R Us

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
was like the fucking

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
big ass toy store

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
it was a fucking event to go

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
to see Toys R Us

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
now to be clear they just filed for

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
bankruptcy so they're not and Bobby's

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
kind of yelling at us in chat

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
they're not closing all their stores or anything like that

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
not yet anyway but

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
this isn't necessarily a very good sign

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
that they have filed for bankruptcy

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
however what does this

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
have to do with gaming well some of you get your games there

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
but some people were wondering

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
with some of the news about how suppliers

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
were not even letting Toys R Us

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
buy from them unless Toys R Us

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
basically paid cash up front

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
some people were wondering is Toys R

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
Us still going to get the Super Nintendo Mini

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
and the answer is yes

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
there will be a limited supply

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
of the console remember Toys R Us

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
didn't do preorders so there will be a limited

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
supply of the console but Super Nintendo

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
Minis may still be available to purchase

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
excuse me will still be available to purchase

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
if your store got enough

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
from launch day which is September

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
29th

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
stores will open at normal time and have

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
limited inventory of the console

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
so we encourage customers to get in line before

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
doors open on Friday morning for the chance

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
to scoop up this hot item

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
so maybe the one takeaway with this is that

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
some people were maybe thinking

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
Toys R Us was going to be their best bet

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
because they didn't take preorders

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
but it sounds like Toys R Us may just

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
not have a very healthy stock

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
of these so you may be risking it

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
going to Toys R Us so you are going to

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
my honest advice to you is like

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
try to split up and

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
hit like if you are in a household that's

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
more than one person and one is going to

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
be enough for you because most of these places are probably going to limit

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
one per customer but if one is going to be enough for

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
your household you go one store

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
have your partner go to another

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
store you know have

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
a friend that doesn't really

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
care but will help you out go to a third

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
store spread out divide and conquer

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
that might be the best way to do it

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
alright

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
rama in chat over at live.voggenetwork.com

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
points out this isn't the first time Toys R

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
Us has filed for bankruptcy well Toys

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
R Us isn't quite the event that it

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
used to be right it's not

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
do your kids get excited about Toys R Us trips?

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
They like going there every now and then although

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
the one time that

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
we can go to the bookstore

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
or we can go to Toys R Us which one are you going to want to

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
oh I get a bookstore why because we want to

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
play at the train table there like if there's

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
a train table over at

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
which I don't understand either because they have

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
a fucking train table

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
in our house Loki most parents

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
would be thrilled that their kids want to go read books

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
fuck no I want to look at goddamn

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
Legos and there's more Legos

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
there oh this isn't about

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000
them it's about you no it's about my crack addict

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
okay

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
it's not about the kids it's about me

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
needing to sniff the crack okay

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
tell

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
tell them you know what tell them

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
next time they want to go to Barnes and Noble to play

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
with the train set just tell them Barnes and Noble

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
threw it in the trash

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
see what happens

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
no they

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
play at the train table and stuff and I occasionally

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
look at the Legos and I

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
balk at how everything is so expensive but I want

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
it and that's usually

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
alright moving on

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
Loki how about some more gaming news

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
alright so Minecraft is

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
still continuing on their Better Together

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
updates so now it's available now

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
on most of the Legacy devices

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
so right now

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
that update of course the one that

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
allows you to play across multiple

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
devices different platforms

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
they have that drop now on

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
Xbox One, Windows 10, Mobile

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
VR and the Switch version

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
will be coming soon

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
but that's pretty exciting I still have yet to go

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
back in there and actually try it on Windows 10

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
version I'm curious to see how that

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
is

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
yeah I mean

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
great news if everybody wants to play

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
together I think that we have to do that

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
in the realms area so I'm

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000
sorry it also offers the ability

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
to share invites invite links

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
to the realms which is basically their

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
version of like servers

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
which I still think that costs

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
money each month but it's kind of interesting

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000
it'd be interesting to go back to that

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
I remember when we ran a server if it wasn't such a

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
pain in the ass I'd still do it

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
it was just you know even it wasn't that

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
expensive it was like $5 a month but

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
it was just kind of a pain

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000
in the ass to do updates especially when you have mods

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000
in doing updates it's just a pain in the

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
ass to do that but maybe vanilla

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
we could do vanilla I don't know

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
yeah the VOG Minecraft server was

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
a fun thing for a little while

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
but I would maybe be more willing to do

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
this because in this way a lot

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
more people I would think maybe hopefully be able to

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
play because it's on console and you can just go

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
check it out there

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
I bet that would be awesome

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000
also some awesome news from Nintendo

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
catching up with the digital age

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
this is great there is now a

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
new app authenticator for Nintendo

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
so you can actually get two factor

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
authentication on your Nintendo account

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
which you know in this day and age

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000
when we have stolen passwords left

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
and right from break-ins and what have you

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
I shit you not this week I had

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
text messages while I was sleeping

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
on Wednesday or Thursday night

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
my Blizzard account got

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000
like 5 text messages

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
your Blizzard authenticator code is

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
in this code they came in

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
somebody was fucking trying to get into my Blizzard

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000
account and I guess had somehow

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000
figured out my password which isn't this

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000
interesting I use a unique password

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
for Blizzard that I don't use anywhere else

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
so not only

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
do I use a unique password I don't use anywhere

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
else but I also have two factor authentication

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
on and somehow somebody got the Blizzard password

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
I'd really like to know how that happened because

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
I don't have to log into

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000
Blizzard anything anywhere like ever

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
so it's very strange

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
to me that that happened

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000
but anyway for whatever reason I got a bunch

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000
of Blizzard so I went in and changed my password

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000
but thankfully two factor authentication

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000
saved somebody going in there

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
and you know probably trying to get into my WOW

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000
account although joke's on them I cancelled that a while

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
ago so anyway

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
maybe you don't want somebody getting

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
into your Nintendo account and you know

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
buying stuff that they turn around and sell

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
like what was the big thing on Xbox

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
it's the fake money shit

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
like NBA 2K18

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
stuff that's the stuff they get in there

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
and they buy a bunch of it and sell it so anyway

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000
good news Nintendo's

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
catching up to this maybe because of

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
NBA 2K18 who knows but

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
yeah I would definitely recommend

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
you enable the two factor authentication I think

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
that'd be a great idea to enable it you

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000
go to Nintendo's login web

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
portal over at accounts.nintendo.com

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
slash login and then you're gonna

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
check out the sign in and security section

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000
you have to verify your email

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000
address and then you can enable the two factor

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
authentication every

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
new login from your Nintendo account requires

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
authorization from you besides

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
just the login and password via

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000
an app or a code

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
texted to you which is kind of the modern way

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
of how most of these things work so

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
good job Nintendo getting on that TFA

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
before you start charging people

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
for online good job

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000
just a couple more stories for you

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
guys and then it'll be Skype line time

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000
but first Loki alright and then

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
this is a shock to no one

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000
but hey remember that Mario

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000
Super Mario 64 online

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000
game yeah there was no

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
way that wasn't gonna get a copyright

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000
strike and of course that's what happened

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
they've been copyright striking

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000
the crap out of any videos that were posted

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
on there on

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
YouTube at least with it and

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
of course you know apparently

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
the developer of the

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.000
online game has been

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.000
you know basically stating that

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.000
it's gonna take a break from it for a little bit

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000
until after Super Mario

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
Odyssey comes out and they're gonna

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000
hopefully release some updates

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000
after that but

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
yep I'm not surprised

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
that this happened I mean

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000
why not

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
makes sense yeah I don't think a lot

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000
of us are very surprised at this at all

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000
but it's just the videos so far they've been taken down

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000
I don't think they've actually tried to

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000
ah the Patreon's gone too I'm pretty sure

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
well

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000
no cause they're I don't

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000
know if the Patreon's gone yet but

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
I think it was I think that was the big problem

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
see here this is the guy making money off it

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
oh yes okay so they did

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
a strike against the Patreon thing

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
and the YouTube videos were down he hasn't

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
received the cease and desist yet

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000
but it may come to that if he

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000
doesn't stop updating it but

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
it's out there now so there's it's too late

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
honestly the Patreon was

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000
the real problem here I think Nintendo kinda would've

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
done this eventually anyway especially with all the blog

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000
coverage it was getting but the Patreon

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.000
like made it happen faster because

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.000
the fact that the guy was getting money off of it

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
I mean no matter what

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000
you wanna say the reality is

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
Nintendo was gonna say he's making money

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
off of our character and that's a no

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
no you know there's

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
yeah there's only so many ways you can

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000
spin that I mean I thought the mod was

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
great and I wish he could work on the mod

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
but he's gonna have to find other ways to get

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
compensation from people

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000
Nintendo can you please carry forward with this idea

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000
right that would be awesome

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
to see like old games with like a twist

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000
like this I know I kinda love it

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
well like even like they went back

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000
and they redid Excitebike not that long

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
ago where it's like online now

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
you know it's just a little shitty thing but it was

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000
cool for a week

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000
you know so I think it would be neat to

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000
go back to Mario 64 and add some of this stuff

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
into it so

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000
or maybe these games just need to find new

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.000
collaborations such as they did

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000
in our last story tonight with

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000
Sonic Forces

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
that's right at an announcement at Tokyo Game Show

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
2017 there is going to be an official collaboration

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
between Sonic Forces and

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
Hooters

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
that's right but this is Hooters in Japan

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000
I didn't even know Hooters was in Japan

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000
is Hooters in Japan a class year joint or is it

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
what's the difference

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
I've never been to Hooters in Japan

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
maybe the menu items

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000
I don't know hopefully their food doesn't suck

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
has anyone in chat ever been to Hooters

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000
I feel like the okay so here's the thing

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000
we didn't have Hooters in California for the

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000
longest time right

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000
it was like a thing where it was like oh we've heard of this but that's like

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.000
I think they've closed down all the Hooters over here

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000
the only one that I know of that's still running is

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000
the one in Rancho is still open no it's not

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000
it's not yeah it's closed oh shit

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000
maybe they are all closed

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000
it's infidel yeah it's gone

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000
oh shit no that was still open not that long

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000
ago oh maybe they are all gone

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000
I don't know but anyway well I guess they're gone

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000
well here's the thing like you know when they first

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
finally came to California after all this time it was like

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000
oh let's go to Hooters and then I think everybody

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.000
realized oh wow their food sucks

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
the food sucks

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
and you know I was always

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
you know obviously I've made no secret

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
that I'm gay on this show so you know

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
the ladies at Hooters don't really do it for me

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
but I always thought they were really nice and friendly

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
they were very friendly it was a little

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
weird I mean it was just kind of like

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000
hey why are you sitting down at my table to take my order

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
that's a little weird

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000
I always thought it was

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000
I get it that you're trying to be friendly and busty but you know

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
it's just it's weird

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
and it wasn't that we I remember we went to

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000
the one that was

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000
with Annie and Jim actually

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
we hadn't gone and we went there

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000
Flaco Jones and wife yes

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
Flaco Jones and wife so we went there and

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000
I remember I

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000
got a hamburger and the hamburger was kind of

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
crap and then I was like okay well

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
everybody says the wings are good so

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000
I'm gonna try the wings it took an hour to get

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
wings and

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
they were not good I did not

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000
like them but then again to be fair I don't like

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000
buffalo wings but

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.000
they I've tried

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
their wings in different sauces

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000
other hooter locations

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.000
and I've been the three or four different

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000
ones not liking any of them

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000
their food was just no thanks

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.000
wow sure enough

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
so I'm looking I'm looking at the news from the SACB

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.000
on June 9th the Hooters and Rancho Cordova

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.000
closed uh the second

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000
Hooters closing in a year because the one over by

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
Arden Mall closed I'm sorry I know this is a worldwide

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
podcast which you didn't have to this involves

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000
our hooters local news okay but

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000
it involves our hooters and so this is important

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
um so anyway

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
uh this was a decision made by the landlord

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000
as they exercised the right to terminate

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.000
the lease pursuing a different direction

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000
with the property so they

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.000
didn't want to hooters there anymore that's dumb

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000
it was kind of dumb I thought

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000
it was just because that's what happened to Ferrell's

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000
you know that turned into Old Spaghetti Factory recently

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000
cause that place Ferrell's was

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000
always fucking hopping we don't like ice

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000
cream fuck you guys

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000
it's just this kind of clientele

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000
is not good for us

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000
oh my we want hooters there

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000
uh the one in

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
Arden did you know what it's getting turned

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
into I had no idea the one in Arden

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000
a sizzler

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000
hahaha

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000
that's funny

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.000
yeah in April it was announced that the site

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000
would become a sizzler

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.000
hahaha

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
fuck this hooters nonsense

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000
but the SACB does point

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000
out there is one remaining

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000
hooters and it's the one

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
in Natomas the one by the movies in Natomas

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000
how ironic

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000
there it is

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.000
alright now you're all up to speed

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
on the local hooters drama

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000
but good old

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000
dar to see ya in our chat room found us

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000
a hooters of japan menu

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.000
so they have such things like

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000
salads with cob salad

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000
shrimp and spinach salad this is all

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000
the same shit you can get here right there's nothing really

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000
I don't think I see anything that's

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:52.000
out of the norm really

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.000
do they have all these sandwiches and stuff

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:56.000
muscle with garlic butter that sounds

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.000
fancy for seafood so maybe

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000
they have a couple extra items but not really

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000
so sounds kind of very

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.000
similar to what we have here anyway where the fuck

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:06.000
were we oh yeah Sonic the Hedgehog in

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000
hooters hahaha

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.000
they're going to be doing a collaboration

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.000
but the collaboration starts

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000
in the middle of October and further information

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.000
is to come they didn't really say what it's

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000
going to be and if Amy will

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000
be involved but I somehow

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.000
think not what do you think

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000
what do you think the Sonic and hooters collaboration

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000
will be I would say tweets

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000
from the Sonic the Hedgehog account for sure

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000
what

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.000
well the only thing I can think that has

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000
that's in common with hooters

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000
and Sonic the Hedgehog is

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000
the hooters food

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
makes you gotta go fast

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000
so

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.000
I mean that's kind of a

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000
tie in right there

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.000
other than that

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000
I have no idea but you know what

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.000
good night everybody

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000
show's cancelled kids need

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000
more kids need to come to hooters

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000
I guess because it's awkward

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.000
it's such a kids restaurant

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000
it's all about owls everybody loves owls

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000
everybody loves owls Sonic the Hedgehog

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000
is not an owl last time I checked

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000
oh he's getting another friend

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.000
hootie the owl

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000

we wait to see if a call comes in I do have skype

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000
running I have to do the whole ipad

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000
thing again tonight but I think it should work

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000
so anyway meanwhile

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000
I'm going to check in with loki and see if there's any last minute stories

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
I didn't really have anything last minute but did you

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000
get to catch the new trailer for the new

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000
Tomb Raider oh the movie

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.000
yes I did I did watch it and I totally

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:54.000
recognize scenes from the game like the whole thing in the boat that was

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000
the beginning of the game yeah it looked kind of cool except for the

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000
clicking in the background of the trailer

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.000
but I know that was for artistic

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000
effect was it I don't even

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000
really pick that up it's neat

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000
I look better

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.000
better than some of the other Tomb Raider movies

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.000
yeah yeah so yeah no I would go

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000
see it I mean I never seem to get to go to

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000
movies anymore but I would go see it for sure

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000
so anyway we do have a call coming

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.000
in so I'm going to try to pick this up here and

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000
connect on our skype line and we will get

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000
to the telephones

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
uh hello you're on orange lounge radio who's this

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000
uh this is

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.000
yyr hey yyr how you doing

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000
I'm doing okay I guess the

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.000
ipad is working yes the ipad is

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000
where it's a little slower to connect which I don't like

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.000
but it works it gets the job done

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000
ipad therefore I am

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000
uh well

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000
uh actually the main reason why I'm calling

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.000
is because I wanted to

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000
answer your inquiry from last week

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:48.000
which you may or may not actually remember

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.000
um I guess

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.000
I can see the expression on your face

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000
means I should probably remind you

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000
shit I forgot I forgot that we have a

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000
camera now because of this ipad alright

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000
now you

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000
you have nothing to be ashamed of it's a fine

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.000
looking face so um

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.000
anyway

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:08.000
um yes it was

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.000
was mentioning that

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.000
you know I came to this realization about

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.000
the shift keys on a typical

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000
keyboard not being the same size

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000
yes because I was working on the

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.000
interface for super multitasking

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:22.000
and you were wondering why does

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.000
that matter what does this have to do

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.000
with the interface so

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.000
so yeah uh as you

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000
may recall super multitasking is a

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000
game which has you playing

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.000
multiple games at the same time

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:36.000
in various areas of the screen

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000
and now there's nothing I

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000
can do to make this easier but what I

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:42.000
did want to do is give the player

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.000
uh as many tools

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000
as possible to

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.000
make playing it

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000
at least as

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.000
frustration free as possible so that

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.000
they can focus on actually trying to

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.000
multitask so and one

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:58.000
way I do that is by

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000
in each area of the screen where a game can

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000
appear I label what controls

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.000
are used in that area

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.000
for example in that left side

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
slot where you can use the left

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:10.000
stick or the d-pad I have

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000
visual representation of both

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.000
the left stick and the d-pad

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000
you know so just in case you know

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
oh uh there's a game over there what

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000
do I play it with again oh yeah

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
so now here's the thing

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000
this is the first version of this game that allows

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.000
you to use the keyboard as

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.000
well as a controller

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000
but not just that I don't

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.000
just set up a configuration

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:34.000
and force you to use it you can

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.000
define any key configuration

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.000
you want

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.000
good man because accessibility

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.000
very important but I still

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000
wanted to visually represent

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.000
the keys that you have selected

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:48.000
no matter what keys they

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.000
were so I wanted to

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:52.000
visually represent all of the different keys

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:54.000
in the background and

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.000
since some keys are wider than others

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:58.000
if you want to do that properly

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:00.000
well let's just say I measured

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:02.000
all of the key widths on

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.000
a couple of different keyboards

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:06.000
and uh yeah

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:08.000
so

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:10.000
what did you think of the realization

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:12.000
that some shift keys are

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:14.000
larger but some are not

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:16.000
I think it's

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.000
kind of like a metaphor

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000
for life really

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.000
mostly about penis sizes

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000
uh yeah I think

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000
you're just going to have to do your best with

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:28.000
that representation YYR and

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:30.000
it is what it is in that regard and if somebody

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.000
really sends you an email that says you

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.000
did not accurately represent the shift key

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:36.000
on my keyboard then just take that email

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.000
and throw it away

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.000
I'll just say I did the best I could

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.000
I mean I hope that

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:44.000
there are a few people that are like

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.000
wow that is some crazy attention to

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:48.000
detail there so

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:50.000
we know we need to all review bomb

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:52.000
multitasking by saying the

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.000
shift key no it's a positive

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:56.000
it's going to be an uplifting review bomb to say

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:58.000
the shift key was appropriately

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:00.000
represented

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:02.000
well I just believe in equal

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.000
representation for all my keys

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.000
good good for you you're a good man

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000
YYR any hints

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.000
on when we might be playing

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.000
multitasking for ourselves?

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.000
I am feverishly trying to complete

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:16.000
all of the various and sundry

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.000
things on my list some of which

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.000
weren't there a day ago but I just

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.000
keep finding things that I meant to do

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:24.000
anyway but never actually

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000
wrote down so I

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:28.000
originally had said fall

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:30.000
I think fall officially ended three

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.000
two days ago something like

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:34.000
fall just started two days ago

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:36.000
oh no

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:38.000
I meant oh summer oh you're right

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:40.000
yeah summer I had said summer

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.000
so fall just started and I missed

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000
I missed summer so I'm

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:46.000
now saying fall and I hope

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:48.000
I will be able to complete it and release it

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:50.000
during the fall so otherwise

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:52.000
it will be my own fall that's alright

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:54.000
fingers and toes crossed for you that you can

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.000
do it it's you know what you're not the first

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:58.000
developer to ever have to delay a release date

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:00.000
so at least you can you know feel that

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:02.000
and you know insert

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.000
something about a bad game is bad forever

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.000
blah blah blah perfect you

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.000
know what what if you guys what if you'd

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.000
release the game and the shift the shift

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.000
key was not right

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000
shift gate

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:16.000
shift

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.000
gate

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.000
and with that we're going to end this

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:22.000
call but thank you yyr I really appreciate the phone

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.000
call you take care okay

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000
I'm just going to throw in one more thing

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:28.000

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:30.000

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.000
yyr games all

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.000
3000 plus of them so if there was

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:40.000
anything at any point that you were

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.000
interested in picking up do it now

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:44.000
because in five days it will all be

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:46.000
gone the clock is ticking y'all

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.000

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.000
less time so this is

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.000
your last chance to get bungee ferret tossing at

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.000

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:56.000

meh talking about the tomb raider thing we were talking about

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:34.000
before that last call dungeon

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:36.000
buster says the tomb raider trailer was

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:38.000
neat the poster was meh

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.000
there you go

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.000
let's see mxc in chat

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.000
says I have so many xbox live indie

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.000
game titles yeah I had

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000
quite a few too but I haven't

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:50.000
plugged in my xbox 360 in the longest

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.000
time it's sad but there's just

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.000
not a lot I mean with the backwards compatibility now

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:56.000
on xbox one there's very little that

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
I would need the 360 to play and it's

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000
like I've got enough between

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000
xbox or

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000
between the playstation 4 the switch

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.000
xbox one I've got enough so that I'm not

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.000
on 360 so

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.000
they have a game that just hit early access

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:12.000
ballistic ng

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:14.000
which you may not recognize that but it is

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000
a wipe out

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000
type clone that's on

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.000
steam like the racing game yeah and it has

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000
I think I want to say

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.000
market or the steam

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000
I think you can do customized

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:28.000
stuff in there maybe not I don't know

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.000
they have a modding api so that's kind of cool

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000
but you can check it out it's five

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.000
dollars oh that's not bad

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.000
yeah that's a good price all right

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.000
um sorry if you were trying

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.000

slash o l r but I guess for tonight

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.000
we are going to wrap up I know it was a little bit of a shorter

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:28.000
show tonight but we didn't have dark soccer tonight and

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:30.000
well you know it's a little just just not as

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.000
much to say tonight some weeks are just a little slower

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:34.000
than others but uh that's all right we'll be

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:36.000
back again to do it in seven days uh if you liked

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:38.000
what you did hear we did fill a good two hours here

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:40.000
at orange lounge radio tonight so if you did like what

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000
you heard here at orange lounge radio tell a friend

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000
or two about the show help us spread the word

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:46.000
because we are the show where every gamer has a voice

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:48.000
but um you know if the voices aren't here we can't

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.000
really hear them so a nice five star review on a site

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:52.000
like itunes google play or

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:54.000
wherever it is you found this show goes an awful

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:56.000
long way um

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000
I think uh

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.000
we should probably wrap it up with some final thoughts

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.000
loki your final thought tonight

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000
uh my final thought is

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.000
I'm gonna work on more

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000
lego stuff this week actually I've been using a lot

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000
of the digital designer so it's been fun

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000
I've been trying to do a mock of my

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000
house but the problem is it's so

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000
huge um

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.000
it's just like it's gonna take up four base plates

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.000
so that's that's way too big

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000
that's gonna take up like a whole table so

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000
I need I'm trying to shrink it down

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.000
but it's hard to shrink down

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.000
uh floor plan on my house

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.000
alright and uh my final

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:32.000
thought tonight is uh I need to make sure

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.000
I play something new this week I'm enjoying playing

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.000
the same old games like overwatch and

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.000
stuff I need to make sure I play something new this week

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.000
so I will uh I will do that

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.000
so for now though we're gonna wrap

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:44.000
up we'll see you back here in seven days
