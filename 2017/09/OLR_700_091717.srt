00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 700

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
That is 700 of our program for this September the 17th of 2017

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
My name is Rob Roberts here with my co-hosts in Studio N7

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Based out of Sacramento, California here to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Hello hello, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Poop

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
How are you?

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Poop

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Woop? Woot?

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
That's all you have to say after 700 episodes?

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I said poop

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Oh poop?

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Well I guess talking poop emojis are the rage this week so why not?

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Oh my god

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Nah I'm doing okay

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm just looking at wish.com and this site is such a train wreck

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
What is that?

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It's like where you can buy stuff for cheap and you really never know what you're gonna get

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
That sounds awful

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
First off I don't want to give them free advertising but that's

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So wait you just

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Am I hearing this right?

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You give somebody money and you're saying give me a treat and you don't know what treat you're gonna get

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
No no no you pick you can pick the item

35
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Oh okay

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:53,000
But it's like I've gotten like stuff for like very very drag things and cosplay stuff from here so

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I was gonna say I could just imagine where it's like you know I give money and it's like I like Metroid and then they gift me

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Oh you get a copy of Metroid Federation Force

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
No

40
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
No

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
That's not what I meant

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
That's not how it works

43
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Okay good good

44
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Also joining us of course as he does every week say hello to tech master Loki

45
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Hello

46
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Hi Loki how are you?

47
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Fine

48
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Yeah you went to a little show with the kid yesterday right?

49
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Yeah

50
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
One of the kids

51
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Went to this like it's like Disney on Ice for people that like superheroes I guess

52
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
But without the ice and so it's it's like a

53
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Disney on pavement

54
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Sort of

55
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's Marvel Universe Live so I tried to take my son to it a while ago when he was much younger and he was afraid so we took him again

56
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And he sat through it and complained but he enjoyed it he says

57
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I don't know

58
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
He may or may not have been being truthful

59
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
He's a little too old for like he's kind of like you know he knows that they're just people in costumes he's not really like you know

60
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It's like okay I know

61
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
So he was too young before and now he's too old this time like it's really

62
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Well he's very sensitive because like they have explosions and fireworks and stuff

63
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Like you know stage effects you know little fire things and stuff

64
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
This year because I we didn't really watch last the last time it came through but

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
From what I saw online and what like the few five minutes that we were there

66
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It was a lot more like elaborate stunts going on versus this year is very tame

67
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Would it have been more exciting if it was on ice

68
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
No

69
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It would have been weird

70
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
All right

71
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And hello to all of you in our chat room because we do tape live every Sunday night at the voice geeks network vog network dot com six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show six ish Pacific

72
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I think we're getting a start at 615 tonight because Bobby ran a little long but we don't mind because he always has us on at the end of his show so sometimes that's why it goes a little long

73
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
But you guys can chat along with us of course in our chat room at live dot vog network dot com

74
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Where Mega Man X 400 starts us off tonight saying

75
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Grats you old bitches

76
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I can think of no better comment to start off tonight's show

77
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Thank you very much and there's been a lot of kind words on Twitter and places like that

78
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
People saying congratulations on 700 episodes

79
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I wish I could say we have a special great grand thing for you tonight but after 100 200 300 for it look I don't want to sound like that guy but I guess I am a little bit it's kind of like you get to a point where you're like

80
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You know maybe we should just keep doing what works best and what keeps people coming to the show every week so we'll just kind of do our do our normal show

81
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Or we procrastinate too long to plan a thing so fuck it

82
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Yeah that too we got a little old we're a little slower to move now that we're older that's that's just the way it goes sometimes

83
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
But I really do truly want to thank you know those of you guys that do take the time out to listen to this show

84
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Sometimes I see the tweets and emails and chat comments and stuff from people that say this has been a part of my Sunday night for 10 years 15 years you know even five years whatever

85
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And I'm always really humbled that you know people have kind of made this a part of their Sunday nights as we have and I just really can't thank you guys enough

86
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And some of you guys maybe have just recently discovered the show in the past few weeks and I think that's awesome too that you know people are still discovering this and deciding to try it out for a little while

87
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:23,000
So just you know big thanks all around I do want to of course give a couple other thank yous that are that are so important

88
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm always afraid I'm going to miss people when I do these types of things but I know there's a few people that this show just would not be here without

89
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I think I have to give a big big big big thank you and props to Jason or VX JasonXV not only does he do that intro that you hear every week without fail or without me like begging and pleading he just does it because he wants to and all that

90
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:54,000
But I mean a lot of the technical stuff like having a website to handle the traffic that will that large mp3 files generate like Jason's always taking care of us in that regard

91
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:09,000
So I again cannot really I cannot undersell the amount of the amount of stuff that Jason has done for Orange Launch Radio that the show just like would not be here if it wasn't for him so thank you so much for Jason

92
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And of course I would have to give big big thank yous to Mr. Bobby Blackwolf he likes to call himself the opening act to Orange Launch Radio as he has been for many years

93
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:37,000
We like to think of it more as like a dual headliner act sort of thing but big thank you of course to Bobby just has been you know a partner in things like the Voice of Geeks Network and so forth and just very very like minded as to us as to why we're podcasting in the first place and what this whole thing is about so you know I can't really thank him enough

94
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:53,000
And of course my pal Travis who started under Station Live which in some ways this show is a spin off of in some ways so you know I can never say enough thanks to Travis for really really introducing me to the concept that any idiot can do this

95
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Thank you Travis for being that idiot and exposing this to me and I say that with big hearts and thank yous

96
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,000
And yes as Tigerclaw points out in chat Travis is starting a brand new show yes I have heard the rumors I've heard the discussion on that I don't really know anything that you guys don't so I'm excited to hear that Travis is considering coming back to the radio

97
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:24,000
He's apparently considering coming back to Dragon Con so there's a lot I'm very excited about but I will let Travis talk about that when Travis is ready it's not really my place to

98
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:38,000
So there you go that's oh and I should of course I think one more person I have to say thank you that we don't thank enough is I have to say thank you to Midihead who does the intro to this show that you've heard for god a good 500 episodes now at least

99
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Like that little opening riff that you've heard has been a part of this show for a long time

100
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
We don't have anybody else to remake it

101
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Well I mean but there's

102
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
We had somebody and that fell through

103
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It goes a long way to say that like we kind of don't need anybody the only reason we would do it is because then we sit here and realize sometimes you want to repaint the house

104
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I'd take a new intro from Zircon

105
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Well whoever whoever would be willing to do it we'll look at that but rest assured this Midihead intro we've had has worked for 500 episodes and that's great and you know he didn't charge us for it or anything he just did it because he knew that we were big supporters of music based games

106
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Music based games and that he was a part of those at the time if you recognize that name he did some remixes that were in DDRXBox and I think he had a song in Beatmania

107
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:33,000
One of those crossed over to Beatmania 2DX at one point I think my memory is getting a little fuzzy at this point but I think one of his Sana remixes ended up in Beatmania 2DX at one point so there you go

108
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Alright so as promised last week Dark Sakura got us a cake so what kind of oh she's taking a picture because that's what you do to food these days is you take pictures of it so I will try to describe it to you guys because she's actually got candles

109
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
700 candles

110
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
700 candles on this cake I kept telling Dark Sakura it's not our birthday

111
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
We got a butt cake

112
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
It is a butt cake

113
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It's a bunt cake

114
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Actually you need to talk about the cake while I take a picture and put it on the OLR twitter

115
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
And take one before and after the lights are lit

116
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:20,000
So anyway there is a place in Sacramento that I think they're actually all over the place but it's called Everything Bunt Cakes and I like them because they are a good company

117
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:32,000
They support many good charities and are fairly well they don't care who you like to shtup when it comes to making a cake I'll put it that way

118
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Oh yes I forgot we have cake politics in this country but yes I mean it's important

119
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
So let the candle so we can take pictures of that too

120
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Okay I will hold on

121
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So it can be on fire

122
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Well I have to post this on twitter it's very important you have to describe the cake

123
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It is a chocolate bunt cake

124
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Yes

125
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
8 inches

126
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Yes

127
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
And

128
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
And it looks like an asshole

129
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Like that's the other thing that's the other thing you're neglecting to say it looks like an asshole

130
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
It's a butt cake

131
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It is a butt cake

132
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It's a chocolate circle

133
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It's a chocolate butt cake with white frosting on it

134
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:07,000
It's got frosting on the inside and then streams of like frosting tentacles coming out

135
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Frosting tentacles

136
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
From the sphincter of the butt cake

137
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It looks delicious and kind of gross at the same time

138
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:24,000
But I figured it's an occasion and occasions are always the best reason to have cake

139
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Especially delicious semi pricey cake

140
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
So

141
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm lighting candles there is fire in the OLR studio

142
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Rob's extending fire from his grasped hands

143
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
These candles are hard to open

144
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Fire is not very effective on those candles

145
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Oh Rob

146
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Okay can we try not to burn down the house though

147
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Alright everybody get your pictures in

148
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Hold on I gotta go and take

149
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Yeah your turn

150
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Seven almost looks like a one it might be confusing to some people

151
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Okay who's blowing it out

152
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:00,000
This is the worst radio us trying to blow out a cake

153
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Okay here we go

154
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Make a wish

155
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You can listen to us all blow

156
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Make a wish here we go

157
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
One

158
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Two

159
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Five

160
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I blew from over here I'm sure I was doing something

161
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Yay

162
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So see as we promised last episode there is indeed cake

163
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Yes and it's all for us

164
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Alright we'll try to get those pictures posted on the twitter shortly

165
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
But first it is a video game podcast believe it or not

166
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
So we should get into some gaming topics

167
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
There was a lot of Nintendo news this week

168
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Loki did you take a minute to watch the Nintendo direct that happened this week

169
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Yeah I did it was alright

170
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I mean they talked a lot about different things coming out

171
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
There wasn't really a whole lot of surprising stuff except for I think you know the whole minecraft thing coming to 3DS

172
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Say hey by the way minecraft is coming to 3DS and it's out now

173
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Go check it out I mean so that was pretty big

174
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
That little it's out now surprise was cute

175
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I mean that's pretty major and at least digitally they're going to release a physical version not too far away from now

176
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Then they just a lot of announcements of different things in the pipeline

177
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:11,000
So for example they talked about Skyrim and how they have it dated now when it's going to be coming out

178
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:19,000
And then of course they were saying that along with that they're also announcing that Doom is going to get a port to the Switch as well

179
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:28,000
And even Wolfenstein 2 the new colossus will be coming so lots of stuff which is pretty cool

180
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Yeah that's what Bob Coffee in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says the big story is Doom on Switch

181
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
And Dungeon Buster says Wolf 2 coming to the Switch was surprising

182
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
And I would agree I thought those were kind of the biggest headlines from the whole event for me

183
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Is that how Bethesda is really you know supporting the Switch in a big way

184
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
When we haven't had Skyrim go on sale yet

185
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
And I don't know about you guys but I'm not expecting Skyrim to perform super well

186
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:59,000
But maybe maybe I'm underestimating the power of people that only buy Nintendo consoles

187
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:05,000
You know maybe or the fact that sure enough they did put in a little homage to Zelda in it

188
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You know with the amiibo

189
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Did you notice the fine print I might add

190
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Uh oh

191
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
So there is fine print here just in case if you think that you need to purchase certain things

192
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
You know the amiibo stuff that they have for Zelda

193
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Oh they're elsewhere in the game right

194
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Yes

195
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
They said that in the direct they did say that in the direct

196
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
They said it was they would be in dungeons

197
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
So you don't necessarily feel that you have to go purchase those amiibos

198
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
You can still unlock the stuff so I think that's nice that they're doing that

199
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Instead of locking stuff behind a paywall type thing

200
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Um I'm curious to see though how it's gonna run and what it's gonna look like

201
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Cause I feel that with like especially Wolfenstein and stuff

202
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I'm wondering what kind of a downgrade we're gonna get on those

203
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Well some of the folks were looking at Doom and comparing it to Playstation 4

204
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
And saying you don't really notice it

205
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
So that's especially considering you can pick it up and go on portable that's pretty exciting

206
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Yeah so that'd be cool

207
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Lots of lots of 3DS stuff as well

208
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I mean even still we can talk about the Switch as well

209
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
So just kind of some of the stuff

210
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Lots of remakes I've been noticing

211
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
And you know kind of one of the things I was worried about even with the Switch was that

212
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Oh shit there's gonna be a lot of stuff that they're just gonna kind of remaster

213
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
But even that's kind of going along with um

214
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Even with the 3DS and stuff

215
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
So you got like Mario and Luigi Superstar Saga being remade that's coming out October 6

216
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Um you know they're talking a little bit about you know

217
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
They have uh what is it?

218
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Kirby Battle Royale now is a new thing that's gonna be coming to the 3DS

219
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Yep so 3DS is still going

220
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
A new orange 2DS XL

221
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Um there's of course Mario Party they're doing a top 100 best minigames

222
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
And that's coming out on 3DS which

223
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I was like why isn't that on the Switch?

224
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Like that should be a Switch game I would think

225
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Well that's what a lot of people are saying about the new Metroid game

226
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Which I'll you know I'll talk about the new Metroid game a little later

227
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Cause you bet your ass I played that this week

228
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
And um you know I'll get into it during our gaming weeks

229
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
But I know there's been some people I've seen on Twitter that have said

230
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I'm not buying this on the 3DS cause I'm waiting for the Switch version

231
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
And I don't know if there's gonna be a Switch version I gotta say

232
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Like I

233
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
They're gonna at some point gonna get desperate for content

234
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
And you're gonna see a lot of ports of stuff

235
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I mean cause we've already seen that for the Wii U

236
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I don't know I just and I

237
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Look I was as much as anybody else saying

238
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Nintendo needs to just bury the 3DS

239
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
And fully invest in Switch at this point

240
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
But Nintendo clearly does not want to do that

241
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
For whatever the reasons

242
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Just indecisive

243
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Yeah well I don't know if it's just indecisive

244
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
As much as they're like well we still have all these 3DSs that are everywhere

245
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
So we can make software that can still sell to all these

246
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
You know millions of people that have them

247
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
While we still face the hardware challenges with the Switch

248
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
And something else to just think about

249
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
You know that may be coming into play

250
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Is that we do have to remember that

251
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Nintendo exists in more countries than just

252
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
You know the US and Canada

253
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
You know and even Japan

254
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Except Brazil cause that's where the Sega Master System is still alive

255
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Well okay but you say that tongue in cheek

256
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
But in reality

257
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Maybe there's something about the fact that the 3DS

258
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
With as old as that system is

259
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Is much easier to get in other countries

260
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
That aren't usually the ones that get the first wave of games

261
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
No one's saying that they don't have to develop for the 3DS

262
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I'm just saying why wouldn't they develop for both systems

263
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I would think that that would be a title that would

264
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
You know do well on the Switch

265
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I mean

266
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
It probably would but I will say this

267
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
The Metroid you know not to spoil my gaming too bad

268
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
But I'm going to

269
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,000
The Metroid game on 3DS has the best 3D on the system

270
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Period

271
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
That I've seen

272
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
So it's weird because I thought at one point

273
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Nintendo was moving away from 3D

274
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
With these 2DS's and the fact that it was barely in Pokemon Sun and Moon

275
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
3D for the Minecraft works pretty well too

276
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Yeah but the 3D in this new Metroid game

277
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Is pretty fucking mind blowing

278
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Like it's really good

279
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
And it's what makes it work

280
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It's the right amount of 3D

281
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
It's a 2D game

282
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
But it does 3D effects when it needs to

283
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
That work really well

284
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
So there is that

285
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
So and if you put that on the Switch

286
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
You're not going to have the same 3D effects

287
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Of course you can play this Metroid game in 2D mode

288
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
And probably still get as much out of it

289
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
That's not going to you know like if you're like

290
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I don't like 3D or I can't see 3D

291
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I still think you'll get a lot of the Metroid game

292
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
But I mean for those that do enjoy the 3D

293
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Like this game does it very well

294
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
The other thing was for the Switch

295
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Of course they talked a little bit about Xenoblade Chronicles 2

296
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Which will be coming out in December

297
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Snipperclips is getting a new release

298
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
And they're getting new DLC

299
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
So it's kind of like a game of the year edition

300
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
A remaster

301
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Not a remaster but it's like kind of like you know

302
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
The bundle with the DLC thing that's going to be coming out

303
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
So that's something Project Octopath Traveler

304
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Which looks pretty cool

305
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:08,000
It's kind of how I think they should do all the 2D RPGs honestly

306
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
That was another one of those today surprises with the demo

307
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I didn't get to play the demo yet

308
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I'm hearing really positive things about it

309
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I just haven't gotten around to it myself yet sadly

310
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Of course they announced along with the new trailer for Super Mario Odyssey

311
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
That they have a Super Mario Odyssey Switch bundle

312
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
That's going to be coming to Red Joy-Cons

313
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
At the end of October

314
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:37,000
And then they showed off some new worlds for Mario Odyssey

315
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Which looks alright

316
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Dragon Quest Builders was something that's going to be coming to the Switch in the spring

317
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
So lots of stuff kind of announced

318
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
A lot of it thankfully was for this year

319
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
But I don't know

320
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I was hoping for some more new announcements

321
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I know they're going to end with Mario

322
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Well you got to be careful with these directs

323
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Don't ever set your expectations too high

324
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Because you're only going to leave disappointed

325
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I'm sure there were a lot of us that were thinking

326
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Oh this is what they're going to do

327
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I did, I will say this

328
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I was expecting they were going to announce a Bayonetta remaster

329
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
To go with the rumors we were hearing about last week

330
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
With the Playstation 4 and Xbox One and all that

331
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
That didn't happen

332
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
And that was a little disappointing

333
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
But then I have to go

334
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Rob don't set your expectations

335
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Because they're never going to be met

336
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
That's just the way Nintendo works

337
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I think a lot of people

338
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Way too many people were hedging bets on

339
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Smash 4 being announced

340
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Smash for Switch being announced

341
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Now was not the time to do that

342
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Maybe Tokyo Game Show

343
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Although Nintendo doesn't participate in Tokyo Game Show

344
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
That doesn't mean they won't participate in the news cycle

345
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
That comes that same week

346
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
But we'll see

347
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Nintendo announced a system in January

348
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Which was not what people usually do

349
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
So Nintendo clearly marches to the beat of their own drummer

350
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Who may or may not have rhythm

351
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
And it works for them

352
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
So bless their hearts

353
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
But you forgot the biggest thing that came out of the Direct Logie

354
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
You forgot the biggest thing that set Twitter ablaze

355
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Mario's titties

356
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
That was the thing that everybody is talking about on Twitter

357
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Which even, I got to admit

358
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Even I'm looking at this going

359
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
What's the big deal?

360
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
What is the big deal

361
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
About Mario's titties?

362
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
That's the thing, the big deal is

363
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
It wasn't necessarily this

364
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
That was a big deal

365
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Other characters

366
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I think it was from Fire Emblem

367
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Or something else that had some sort of swimsuit

368
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Costume thing

369
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
They had basically

370
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Censored the nipples out of it

371
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Like male nipples

372
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
In the US

373
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
For some reason

374
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I don't know why

375
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I really don't care

376
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
But it's like, why

377
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Why did you do that?

378
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
It's such a weird thing

379
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
People don't like seeing nipples

380
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
But Mario, they're just like

381
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Flipping out

382
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Jamie, did you get a look at Mario's titties?

383
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
For five seconds I was like, okay

384
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Who cares?

385
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Apparently people with no life

386
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Apparently the entire internet

387
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I just

388
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I was just surprised that Mario shaves his chest

389
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
That was the thing that struck me

390
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
As most like, wow, he manscapes

391
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Apparently

392
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Is something that he does, so there you go

393
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Well it would have been very awkward if it was just like

394
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Fucking Ron Jeremy type shit

395
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Well somebody

396
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
There was some tweet floating around where somebody actually

397
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Photoshopped all the chest hair into it

398
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Of course there is

399
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I was like, that looks a little more realistic

400
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
But whatever

401
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
To register participation for this week's episode of

402
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Orange Challenge Radio at vognetwork.com

403
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Use the passphrase, bucket

404
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com

405
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
MegaManX400 says

406
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Mark my words

407
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Smash 4 is coming

408
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
They're waiting to announce their online first

409
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
And Act F says at this point we'll probably see Smash 5

410
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Oh, thank you for reminding me

411
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
That was the other thing that was sorely missing

412
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
From this

413
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Where the fuck is the Virtual Console?

414
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Where the fuck is whatever else we're calling it?

415
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Where the fuck is the online?

416
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
No mention of that whatsoever

417
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I think expecting that to come out

418
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
In 2017, you might as well forget it

419
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I do think at this point

420
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
We will hear about it in January of 2018

421
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I think

422
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Virtual Console is not something

423
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
We're going to hear about this year

424
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Get over it or don't

425
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I mean they had other things they announced

426
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Regarding that stuff, so they have like

427
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
The arcade stuff

428
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
That's sort of like Virtual Console

429
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
But it's not Virtual Console

430
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
It's just arcade versions

431
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I'm with you on that

432
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
That shit's a little weird

433
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
The arcade archive things

434
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I mean, don't get me wrong

435
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I love the original Mario Brothers

436
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I think it's really underrated

437
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
As an arcade classic

438
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Because it's something that's really, really fun

439
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Two player mode

440
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
And remember that game is really old

441
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
The original Mario Brothers is a very, very old game

442
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
You know, the animals that come out of the pipes

443
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
And that was a lot of fun

444
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
With two people, because that was one of the first games

445
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
That I really remember from the back of the day

446
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Where you could really screw your friends

447
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Like playing that game, right?

448
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
They could be running to get a crab

449
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
And you knock the floor to make the crab awake again

450
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
And kill your friend

451
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I remember that game is great

452
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
And I think a really good addition

453
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
As much as we've seen that game

454
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
A lot from Nintendo over the years

455
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Because every time they did a

456
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Super Mario Brothers Advance

457
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Or whatever that series

458
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
That game was included one way or another

459
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
But I think it's a good thing to kind of have on the Switch

460
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
However, where things kind of

461
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Start to get weird with that

462
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Was when they start talking about the whole

463
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Yeah, like Super Mario Brothers versus

464
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Which, okay, for those that don't know

465
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
When they had that Pay Choice 10

466
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Which was like the Nintendo in the arcade

467
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
With games already loaded onto it

468
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
A lot of times

469
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
You would have

470
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Versus Super Mario Brothers

471
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Or Versus Excitebike

472
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I think was one of the other ones

473
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
And basically what it was, it was the same game

474
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
But it was harder

475
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
And I think with Versus Super Mario Brothers

476
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I think, I want to say

477
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
It's more like the second quest

478
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Of Mario Brothers

479
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Where the turtles are all the beetle guys instead

480
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
And I feel like there's

481
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Some things that are removed

482
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
To make some of the jumps harder

483
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
There's just very subtle changes in the game

484
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
On levels 2, I think might have been a thing

485
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Somebody in chat might know the difference

486
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Yeah, it is pretty minor

487
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
All things considered

488
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
So it is weird that that is coming

489
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
When we still don't know about the virtual console

490
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Plans for just regular Super Mario Brothers

491
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
But then there was a lot of other games in that montage

492
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
They talked about Versus Pinball

493
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Versus Clu Clu Land

494
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I'm sorry, but that's really

495
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Offloading the dump truck

496
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Is that them trying to double dip

497
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
On that shit, so it's basically

498
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
They're trying to release this shit now

499
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
It's not exactly the NES stuff

500
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
But you may just buy it because you're tired of waiting

501
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
And then they announce this new paid service

502
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
And then you're like, okay we'll do that too

503
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
And they get you twice

504
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Yes and no

505
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
The double dipping thing wouldn't surprise me at all

506
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
But if it's true

507
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
That you're going to be paying

508
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
For this Nintendo online

509
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
And with it you will get certain games

510
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Like free or whatever

511
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I would imagine that Super Mario Brothers

512
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Will be one of those games

513
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
And so you're not going to have to double dip so to speak

514
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Because one of them you'll pay for with this arcade archives

515
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
The other one will be included

516
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
With your soul

517
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
With Nintendo's online thing

518
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
So that's my thought

519
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
But I don't know

520
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Yeah, I mean

521
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I'll probably buy Mario Brothers

522
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
It depends on the price

523
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
If they want way too much money for it then I won't

524
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
But I'll probably buy the Mario Brothers

525
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
And the Versus Super Mario Brothers

526
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Stuff like Versus Clu Clu Land

527
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
That shit's a stretch

528
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Was it Versus Pinball?

529
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Nintendo Pinball

530
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
There was better

531
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
There was better Pinball on the NES

532
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Than Nintendo Pinball

533
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Nintendo Pinball was an early title

534
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
But it was before Pinbot

535
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
And Roller Ball

536
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
What were the other big Pinball games on Nintendo?

537
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
There's another one I'm trying to think of

538
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Pinball Quest

539
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
That game wasn't actually good

540
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
It was just a good idea

541
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
They just need to seriously at this point

542
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Just mark that shit

543
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I mean they've made their money back

544
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
A ton like

545
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Many dozens

546
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Hundreds of times over already

547
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Just drop that shit

548
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Down to where it's like impulsive

549
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Bundling by that's just like

550
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Oh shit you know that's like 99 cents

551
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
You'd sell like a ton of that shit

552
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Even stuff that's like garbage

553
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Like NES Pinball

554
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Paying 5 fucking dollars for that shit

555
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I bought Balloon Fight for 30 cents on Wii U

556
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Exactly that's a price

557
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
That would be worth it

558
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I would buy it and you know it may not be

559
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Something I'm interested in but I'd buy it because

560
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
It ain't 30 cents

561
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I still have Animal Crossing for GameCube

562
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Exactly that is the fucking Nintendo

563
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I liked where it's like hey

564
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Enjoy our classic games

565
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Hey guess what you purchase that game

566
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
The Game Boy Advance version of this Metroid game

567
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
You can link it up or you know

568
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Game Boy Advance some version of

569
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
You know Metroid or something

570
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
You can hook up your

571
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Game Boy Advance and you can

572
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Play the original Metroid on or something

573
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
That is how you do it

574
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
You've made your money back on those

575
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Stop trying to pretend they're still worth

576
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
5 dollars

577
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
They're fucking old I get it

578
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
People still like them

579
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
But you cannot say that

580
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
This game is still worth 5 fucking dollars

581
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Again

582
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Like after I bought it dozens of times

583
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Alright one other thing

584
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I want to say about the Nintendo Direct

585
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
That I think will be worth 60 dollars

586
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Xenoblade Chronicles 2

587
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I just want to make sure I get that out there

588
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I really enjoyed what I saw from that game

589
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
And I look forward to playing it on the Switch

590
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
That is true

591
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
But their presentation was

592
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Fucking boring

593
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
That was the most boring fucking

594
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Presentation

595
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
I got what I needed out of it

596
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I was fine I don't always need somebody

597
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
That's like super hyped up

598
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
It's just like the explaining like

599
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Just the gameplay

600
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Explaining it

601
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
How would you have explained it Loki?

602
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Show me a fucking trailer done

603
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Not just sit there explaining

604
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Here's some fucking fire and there's robots and bang

605
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Just show an extended trailer

606
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Instead of fucking explaining about

607
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
This system you do this and this system

608
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
This happens and you have these classes

609
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
And blah blah blah

610
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
That's fucking boring

611
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Next month before the holiday but I guess

612
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
What would be the point?

613
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
There's nothing really left to explain

614
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
They've detailed all their holiday releases

615
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
I would have liked little treats here

616
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Mario Odyssey amiibo announcements which they did by the way

617
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Announced more amiibos for that shit

618
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Big surprise

619
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I think they're gonna wait till January to just talk about next year at this point

620
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I think that's probably

621
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Probably it

622
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Alright

623
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Anyway

624
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
That's pretty much all we're gonna say about Nintendo Direct

625
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
What are your gaming weeks?

626
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
The types of video games we have been playing this week

627
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

628
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
What have you been playing this week?

629
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I downloaded Ragnarok

630
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Online for Steam

631
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
I started playing Ragnarok Online again

632
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Did it go free to play?

633
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Wow

634
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Talk about blast from the past

635
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Is anyone moderating the game?

636
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I'm sure there's mods

637
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
They changed the whole

638
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Introductory level

639
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
It kinda is crappy

640
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I might go back and find another free server

641
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
That does the old style RO

642
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I don't know

643
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
But that whole thing started

644
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Because thanks to Tiara

645
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I downloaded this game called

646
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Idle Pouring on my iPhone

647
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Which is basically

648
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
You're just running the whole time

649
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Killing things

650
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Then you level while it's idle

651
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
And then you can do the daily quests and PvP

652
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
It's a fucking clicker game?

653
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
That's the first one that finally drew me in

654
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Good job

655
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Rama in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says

656
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Wasn't Ragnarok Online free to play

657
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
For years on Steam?

658
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
News to me

659
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I didn't even care to look before this

660
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I haven't exactly followed Ragnarok Online

661
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I played RO2 on Steam before I played it

662
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I still have that picture of

663
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Both of our characters

664
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
And you with your little mage with the ribbon in his hair

665
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
That was great

666
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
MXC wants to know the name of this again

667
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Idle Pouring

668
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
P O R I N G

669
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Ideally?

670
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Not like American Idol

671
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
It's pretty fun

672
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
I've been enjoying it

673
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Can we not?

674
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
It is

675
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
And can we not?

676
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I also got Hive Swap

677
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Which is the homestuck game

678
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
That we've been fucking waiting for

679
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
It was really good

680
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
It was pretty short but it's just the first episode

681
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:42,000
And it's all point and click goodness with cutscenes

682
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
And it has everything

683
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
A point and click game fan

684
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Would want plus homestuck

685
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
And

686
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I spent the whole first part

687
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Analyzing every scene

688
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
You can look at the pictures

689
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
In everyone's houses slash their hives

690
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Because trolls live in hives

691
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
And you can

692
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
There's certain

693
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
There's certain

694
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Places that indicate where this fits in continuity

695
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:14,000
And although I did then go back and like completely reread almost the entire homestuck wiki

696
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Just to make sure that I had my head straight as to what universe this was

697
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Because there are many universes

698
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
So

699
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
It was really good

700
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I'm gonna play it again

701
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Alright

702
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
And of course Pokemon Go

703
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Miitomo

704
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
The usual

705
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Blah

706
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Alright then Loki

707
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
How was your gaming week?

708
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I didn't play a whole ton of stuff

709
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
I finished the Lego movie video game

710
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
On PC

711
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Because

712
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I don't know

713
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I like that movie

714
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
The game's alright

715
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
And then now I'm just kind of doing the 100% stuff

716
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
It's just kind of

717
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I don't know it's a mindless game

718
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Just some mobile clicker stuff

719
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I'm kind of getting out of it

720
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
But I did play that this week

721
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
It's still the office space one

722
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I don't know, that's it

723
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I didn't really play any console stuff, thought about it

724
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Just haven't gotten around to it

725
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
I need to play VR

726
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
I purchased a while back

727
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I think she's a while back now

728
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Superhot VR and I do want to try that

729
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Oh I saw that game

730
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
I didn't really play it myself

731
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
But I saw it at Dragon Con because Bobby brought it

732
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
And one of his buddies was playing it

733
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
It looked neat, I like the whole concept of

734
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Things only move when you're actually moving

735
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I thought that was kind of neat

736
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
This is what it would be like to be in the matrix

737
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
What's great about those

738
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
After you do play that

739
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Because you can play it very slowly

740
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
You can play it back at full speed when you're done

741
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Like an instant replay

742
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
So it's like fucking John Woo shit

743
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
You're tossing the guns up in the air

744
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
That's rad, I like that

745
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
What's great though is I've seen some play throughs online

746
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
And there's different scenes

747
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
That kind of teleport you to different areas

748
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
So if you've played it enough and you know where those are

749
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
You can throw your guns to yourself

750
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
In the next area, which is great

751
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
So you'll throw an Uzi into the air

752
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
And you hop to the next scene

753
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
And catch it and then just shoot the guy in the face

754
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
It's just awesome

755
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
All the different options there

756
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
So yeah, I'm gonna

757
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Probably have to check that out

758
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Once again, I'm getting them in the Lego

759
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Stuff they like watching Ninjago

760
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Which I thought when I first saw that

761
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
It looked stupid, but the Ninjago movie

762
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Is coming out and with that they have a game

763
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
So maybe I'll pick that up

764
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
If they have the Lego Marvel 2 then I'll be

765
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Picking up later

766
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
I don't know, it's been Lego

767
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Obsessive in my household

768
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Lately, mainly which is me

769
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Alright, my gaming week

770
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
After last week's show I played

771
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Some Mighty No. 9 live on stream

772
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
So I got out a lot of my thoughts

773
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
During the stream

774
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
I liked it more than I thought I would

775
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
I think in the Mega Man

776
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Wars

777
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Or whatever you want to call it on Steam right now

778
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I think I preferred 20XDX overall

779
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
But I did really like

780
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Mighty No. 9 enough

781
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
It was hard

782
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
The first time I played through I was getting killed a lot

783
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
And I was getting really frustrated

784
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Because I had to go all the way back

785
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
But then when I really was thinking about it

786
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
I was like this was part of what the original

787
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Mega Man games were all about

788
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
You have to memorize patterns

789
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
And even the people that were watching were noticing

790
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
The second time I went through this level

791
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I did way better and I beat it

792
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Because this time I knew exactly what to expect

793
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
And it was completely different that time

794
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
I don't know

795
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
The game lacks a certain polish

796
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I think in a way

797
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
It was fine enough

798
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I can understand where

799
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Fans get a little frustrated

800
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
The internet in general kind of shits on that game

801
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
A little more than it deserves

802
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I suppose the whole Kickstarter element puts it in a unique category

803
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
But it's well enough

804
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
And that game you can catch it on sale

805
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Here and there and everywhere

806
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
So if you find it

807
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
At a price that you're willing to pay for it

808
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Then go for it!

809
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Other games that I played this week

810
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I played

811
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
With my new 3DS

812
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I finally

813
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Was convinced to buy a new 3DS

814
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
And you know what convinced me to finally buy a new 3DS?

815
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
All they had to do

816
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Was to put Samus on it

817
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
That's exactly what they did

818
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
And as soon as they put Samus on it

819
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
I bought it

820
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
So I bought that new 3DS with Samus

821
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
So I had to do a transfer

822
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
And I learned some things doing a transfer

823
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
So I had the Link Between Worlds

824
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
DS before

825
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
So I had a 32GB

826
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
SD memory card in that thing

827
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
But unfortunately it's not as easy

828
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
As putting your 32GB

829
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
SD card into your

830
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
New 3DS

831
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Why? Because the new 3DS

832
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Takes micro

833
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
SD cards

834
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
So I had to buy a 32GB micro

835
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
SD card

836
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Those are like 10 bucks now you can get those dirt cheap

837
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
I got one on Amazon Now

838
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Because I was like I don't want to leave the house

839
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
It's Friday, Amazon Now fucking delivered one here in two hours

840
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Like that

841
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
That's the pinnacle of laziness

842
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
I was like

843
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
I'm not putting pants on god dammit

844
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
That's pretty sweet

845
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
So anyway

846
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
So there was that

847
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
So finally that gets delivered

848
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
I'm like okay well I'll do this transfer

849
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Now yes before I get the emails and the chat comments

850
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
I'm aware you can do a PC transfer

851
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
You can do a PC based transfer

852
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
And in retrospect that is exactly what I should have done

853
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
I should have also ordered an SD

854
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Card reader via USB

855
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Because my computer doesn't have one anymore

856
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
My new one doesn't

857
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
I should have ordered one of those damn card readers

858
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
And did it that way

859
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Because I did it DS to DS

860
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
The transfer, it took

861
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
I started it at 7 PM

862
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Do you know when the transfer finished finally?

863
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
4 AM

864
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Is when the transfer finished

865
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Now in retrospect I would have

866
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Purged, well for one

867
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
I know that 32GB card was not full

868
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Like it's probably not even a quarter full

869
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Do I have a lot of shit on my 3DS?

870
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Yes, but you can fit a lot in 32GB

871
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Of DS software

872
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
In retrospect

873
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
I would have deleted

874
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Every single demo off of my old

875
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
3DS before I started the transfer

876
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Now see since space was never a concern

877
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
I never really deleted the demos

878
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
They were just kind of sitting there

879
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
But I should have got rid of them

880
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
The DS thing warned me that it would take 4 hours

881
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
To do the transfer, it took 9

882
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Okay so it finally finished at 4 AM

883
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
So

884
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
I was a little frustrated by that

885
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
But finally, whatever, it was done

886
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Over

887
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
And then finally I got to sit down and play

888
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Metroid Samus Returns

889
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
On my new Samus 3DS

890
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
And it's great

891
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
I'm so happy Nintendo

892
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Just in time for Loki's birthday

893
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
And to celebrate episode 700 of our program

894
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Decided to release a new Metroid game

895
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
The way Metroid ought to be

896
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
2D

897
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
But with 3D flair in it

898
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
And as I mentioned earlier

899
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
The 3D in this game works very well

900
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
It's not a 3D Metroid

901
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
It's a 2D Metroid

902
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
But the 3D elements work very well

903
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I realized they outsource the development of this game

904
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
To a company in Spain

905
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
And I don't remember the name of it right now

906
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Do you remember the name?

907
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Somebody in chat will yell it out here in a minute

908
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
But they did a good job

909
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
My understanding is that they had some Castlevania titles

910
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Previously that were kind of it

911
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Which goes to show you

912
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
I mean we saw this with Retro Studios

913
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Even before

914
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
I don't know if they were

915
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
I would assume that they were independent from Nintendo

916
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Before they kind of brought on as a second party

917
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
But

918
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Other companies can develop your properties

919
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
For you and do a great job on it

920
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Thank you Act F, Mercury Steam

921
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
That's the name of it

922
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Can we get the people that did Blaster Master Zero

923
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
To do a new Metroid game?

924
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Hello? That would be fucking awesome

925
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I would trust those guys

926
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Yeah well that's who I want

927
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
That's at the top of my wish list for a new Guardian Legend game

928
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Actually it would be those guys, Inti Creates

929
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
I think this is the name of them

930
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
They're at the top of my list for a Guardian Legend

931
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Reimagining right now

932
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
They don't need to do Metroid because Mercury

933
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
This Mercury Steam just did a fucking

934
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Phenomenal job with it so

935
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
They get to make all the Metroids now

936
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
As far as I'm concerned

937
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
And I think with the critical reception this game is getting

938
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
I think it's very likely

939
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
These guys are going to get to make more games

940
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
And maybe those that were hoping this

941
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Would be on the Switch

942
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Maybe you'll get your wish of a

943
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Metroid game by these guys on the Switch

944
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
If you didn't know this game

945
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Metroid Samus Returns, it's a reimagining

946
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Of Metroid Part 2

947
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Or what do they call it, Metroid 2 Return of Samus

948
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Was the Game Boy name

949
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
It takes some of the plot elements

950
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Like the fact that there are 40 Metroids

951
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
On the planet you have to kill

952
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
As you kill more Metroids

953
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
More parts of the planet become accessible

954
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
They've kind of done their own thing with it

955
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Because for one

956
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
That tiny little Game Boy screen

957
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Is now a widescreen

958
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
And so that means, you know, right off the bat

959
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
More stuff is viewable

960
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
So that kind of changes a lot of things right there

961
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Excuse me, and they've done things like

962
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
You can aim the gun up and down

963
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Kind of like in Super Metroid

964
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
You can aim the gun up and down

965
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
But it's free, because the circle pad

966
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
As you hold L, it's free range

967
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
But it actually works really well because

968
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
When you're about to connect with an enemy

969
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
The yellow beam turns red

970
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
So you know when you're lined up correctly

971
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
And then they have this whole melee thing

972
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Where when an enemy is about to attack you

973
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
You can hit the X button

974
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
And you do like a Falcon Punch type of thing

975
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
And you kind of knock it

976
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Yeah, you do like a counter and it knocks the enemy on its ass

977
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
And then your gun immediately targets it

978
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
You don't have to sit there and retarget it

979
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Your gun immediately targets it

980
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
So you can start blasting it

981
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Which is a pretty cool effect when it's done

982
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
I'm not sure how I feel about it

983
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
It is very, it does kind of disrupt

984
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
The usual Metroid flow that I know

985
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
But I'm getting used to it

986
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
It's growing on me the more I play the game

987
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
It was just a little weird to use it in some of those

988
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Early Metroid encounters

989
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
But yeah, I mean

990
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Honestly, that's a very small kind of hesitation

991
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
And what otherwise I think is a pretty

992
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
It's a pretty fantastic Metroid game

993
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Like anybody that was worried

994
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
After Other M and all this stuff

995
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Like, you don't need to worry

996
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
This is a worthy successor to

997
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Metroid Zero Mission

998
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Which would have really been, I guess, the last 2D Metroid game

999
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
If you don't count Other M

1000
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Because Other M was kind of 3D

1001
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Kind of not

1002
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
So if you just kind of throw that one away

1003
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
This is really the next 2D game that they've had

1004
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
And it's great, I recommend it

1005
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
If you're a Metroid fan and you have a 3DS

1006
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
You need to check it out

1007
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
There you go

1008
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Some comments in our chat over at

1009
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
live.vognetwork.com

1010
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Metroid is so fucking good

1011
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Kaijuto says the new 3DS is flawless

1012
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
I will point out, look

1013
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
I was not convinced to upgrade to a new 3DS

1014
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
For the longest time

1015
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
But now that I've done it

1016
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
I do like that head tracking for the 3D an awful lot

1017
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Like it really does work very well

1018
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
And being able to kind of keep the 3D

1019
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Whereas like if you have an old 3DS

1020
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
And you kind of look to the side just a little too much

1021
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Like the 3D completely breaks up

1022
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
It doesn't happen on the new 3DS

1023
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
So that alone is a pretty neat feature

1024
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
I've thrown out my perfectly capable old 3DS

1025
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Paid $200 for a new one for

1026
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Not until they put Samus on it

1027
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Let's see

1028
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Tigerclaw in chat says

1029
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
With Metroid Samus Returns

1030
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Do you think Nintendo will remake

1031
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Super Metroid? I think they should

1032
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
They can make it better

1033
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
How do you perfect perfection

1034
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Tigerclaw? That's my only concern

1035
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Like Metroid 2

1036
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Was a decent Metroid game

1037
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
But I think Metroid 2

1038
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Was kind of always limited by its hardware

1039
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
The old school Game Boy

1040
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
In retrospect

1041
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Was kind of like it wasn't the greatest

1042
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Hardware in the world right

1043
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
It was groundbreaking at the time

1044
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Because it was portable games and it was done well

1045
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
But it wasn't the hardware really limited

1046
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
What you could do on that thing right

1047
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
So I can see why

1048
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
They kind of went back and redid Metroid 2

1049
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Does Super Metroid need a remake?

1050
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
No

1051
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
I think

1052
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
I think we can explore a new Metroid

1053
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Title and that would be just fine

1054
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
But they've changed enough

1055
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
With this that it doesn't feel like a rehash

1056
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Of Metroid 2 but then again

1057
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
I never did get around to playing that AM2R

1058
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
I would be very curious

1059
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
What people who played it Oh god it was so good though

1060
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Now see I would be very curious

1061
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
What your take is on

1062
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
This new Metroid game

1063
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
The AM2R developers have been very kind

1064
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
To it and they want to see it do well

1065
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Which is good

1066
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
That they're not being bitter betties

1067
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
About the cease and desist and all that

1068
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
I'll have to play it

1069
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
I mean I've got the game I just haven't played it yet

1070
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Cool that'll be good

1071
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Let's see going to some other comments in our chat

1072
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Over at live.vognetwork.com

1073
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Let's see Tigerclaw says you perfect

1074
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Perfection by making it look better

1075
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Play better and add a ton of new features

1076
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Like what they did in Samus Returns

1077
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Again

1078
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
I just don't know if it needs it

1079
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
I guess if they want to put a fresh

1080
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Coat of paint on it

1081
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Like if they want to give it the Starcraft

1082
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
HD thing to it

1083
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Where they redo the graphics but they don't

1084
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Fucking touch the game

1085
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Then I might be on board for it

1086
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
But again I don't know

1087
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
I don't know

1088
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
I would have some hesitation

1089
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
I would like to see Mercury Steam just be able to do

1090
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Their own Metroid game now

1091
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Like whatever they want to do with it

1092
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
They've proven themselves with this game

1093
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Let them do whatever they want to do

1094
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Obviously Nintendo can still oversee it

1095
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
And thumbs up or thumbs down whatever they want

1096
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
But that's what I would do

1097
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
In that case

1098
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Anyway I've talked enough about that game

1099
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
But obviously as a long time Metroid fan

1100
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
I've been very excited about that game's release

1101
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
So we're going to get into some gaming news

1102
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
But first some quick announcements

1103
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Again thanks you guys for tuning in for

1104
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
700 episodes whether this is your first episode

1105
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Or your 700th

1106
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Thanks for being a part of our family here Sunday nights

1107
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
At the Boise Geeks Network

1108
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R

1109
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
You can also follow us on Facebook

1110
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio

1111
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
No shows off

1112
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
That I'm aware of in the foreseeable future

1113
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Although I'm looking to maybe

1114
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Do a trip with the long weekend

1115
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Coming up for Veterans Day

1116
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
But something like

1117
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
It's going to be something like L.A. or something

1118
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
It's not going to be something I have to get on a plane for

1119
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
I might go to L.A. that weekend

1120
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Because I have some friends in L.A. I haven't seen in a while

1121
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
That's kind of what I'm leaning towards right now

1122
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Maybe that's what I'll do Veterans Day weekend

1123
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
So I may not be back in time for the show that Sunday

1124
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
But that's not until November

1125
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
So in the meantime though we'll see you every Sunday night

1126
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Let's get into some gaming news

1127
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Loki

1128
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
So this is kind of funny

1129
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Recently

1130
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
It had been discovered that

1131
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
There was a NES

1132
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Emulator inside the Switch firmware

1133
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Which they were calling

1134
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Flog

1135
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
And along with that though

1136
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
They found that there's also a ROM in there as well

1137
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
So golf for the NES

1138
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Is in there

1139
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Which is kind of weird though

1140
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Because they're saying

1141
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
They're not sure if it's an accident

1142
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
They're probably not

1143
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
But they found that the emulator

1144
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
I guess the emulator version

1145
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Works on this Flog emulator

1146
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
And it even has

1147
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Joy-Con controller icons

1148
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
So it's compatible

1149
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
With this emulator

1150
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
There's not really a way to launch the game

1151
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Though via a system menu

1152
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
But it might be something that's in development

1153
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Has anybody tried putting up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, start into their Switch

1154
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
To see if this game pops up

1155
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
No

1156
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Are there Nintendo codes out there?

1157
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Maybe that's the trick

1158
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Maybe there's a button code you have to push and you get this

1159
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Or maybe it's just

1160
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
In there waiting to be unlocked

1161
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
At some point when they unleash other

1162
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Virtual console type games

1163
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
And I think the most exciting thing about this

1164
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Is the fact that they have

1165
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Gone back and they've

1166
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Changed the ROM

1167
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Essentially in a way to

1168
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Account for motion controls

1169
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Well here's the other thing too if you think about it

1170
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
It's pointed out Flog

1171
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
The name of the emulator is Golf Backwards

1172
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
No shit Sherlock

1173
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
So it's just kind of weird though

1174
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
That I don't know

1175
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
I don't know what this is

1176
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Golf is also one of those games

1177
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Where it's in the same bucket as like

1178
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Clu Clu Land and Pinball

1179
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
And some of those things you were talking about earlier

1180
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
I like Clu Clu Land

1181
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
It's one of those games where it's like

1182
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
If Loki gets upset about

1183
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Paying five bucks for Super Mario

1184
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Brothers he really is gonna

1185
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Get upset if Nintendo tries to charge five dollars

1186
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
For golf which I think they actually did on the Wii U

1187
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
But I digress

1188
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Golf is kind of like if Nintendo's gonna give one away

1189
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Golf's a safe one to give away

1190
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Well this is kind of weird too like here's some of the

1191
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
They're talking about the controls so they're saying that

1192
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
You know the controls are the

1193
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
D-pad buttons

1194
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
And the stick however motion

1195
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Control while holding the Z

1196
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
L-R button is also supported

1197
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Instead of using the buttons so they're having

1198
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Motion control being

1199
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Added to NES games

1200
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
But see you know what's

1201
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Exciting about that for me like as

1202
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Hokie as that might be although

1203
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Don't underestimate the power of that shit

1204
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
I mean where as a lot of us like

1205
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
For lack of a better term hardcore gamers

1206
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
It's the power of love again

1207
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Okay look as much as some of us might

1208
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Roll our eyes at it I think there are some people

1209
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
That are gonna think that's really cool

1210
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
That you can go back to the old school games and you can

1211
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Control them a whole new way so don't

1212
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Don't underestimate little shit like that

1213
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
But what is exciting

1214
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
About that for me Loki

1215
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Is that they have gone back

1216
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
And they have edited old games

1217
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
To do new things

1218
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
That's the very exciting part Loki

1219
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
They have edited emulators to do new things

1220
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
So is it possible

1221
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Big question mark

1222
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Is it possible

1223
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
That these

1224
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
The next wave of virtual console

1225
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Will not only have the online support

1226
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
But maybe things like achievements

1227
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Leaderboards

1228
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Things that they've gone back

1229
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
And they've updated these old ROMs to be able to do

1230
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Flog kind of shows

1231
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
That Nintendo is going that

1232
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Direction of more than

1233
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Just a fucking straight up emulation

1234
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Of an old fucking game

1235
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Does that make sense?

1236
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
We'll see

1237
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Yes JD in chat says

1238
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
What was this about not getting your hopes up Rob

1239
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
When it comes to Nintendo? You're right

1240
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
I gotta keep that shit in check but

1241
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Still this is

1242
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
It is a fact that this has been found

1243
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
And that there is more to it

1244
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Than just a straight up emulation

1245
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
So I don't think I'm getting my hopes too far up

1246
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
In making that connection

1247
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Well if they're doing it for flog

1248
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Then maybe they're gonna do it for some other stuff too

1249
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Which by the way I should point out also JD

1250
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
In chat says mmm flogging

1251
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Look

1252
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Folsom Street Fair if I remember right is next weekend

1253
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
But I hope you all have a good one

1254
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
For those that are checking that out

1255
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Let's see

1256
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Although today was the leather walk

1257
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
There's

1258
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
There's events every weekend for something

1259
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
I need a better calendar

1260
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
I attended

1261
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
The election of Mr. Bolt Leather

1262
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
For the year

1263
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
And it was a very nice event

1264
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Good

1265
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Did you get to vote? I played pinball

1266
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Was the audience voted? No they had judges

1267
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
But I played pinball

1268
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Alright

1269
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Rama in chat says you know there's a Folsom

1270
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Street Fair East

1271
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Where do they even do that?

1272
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Is that a P-Town thing?

1273
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Anyway

1274
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Oh it's in New York

1275
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Thank you I've

1276
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Clearly my calendar is not up to date

1277
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
My invite got lost in the mail I suppose

1278
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Alright

1279
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Let's move on from flogging to Final Fantasy

1280
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
And someday maybe those worlds

1281
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Will collide but for now

1282
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
The world

1283
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Soon enough

1284
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Thanks to Final Fantasy 15 modding

1285
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Support

1286
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Ooh Gladio Leather Daddy

1287
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Ooh

1288
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Oh honey

1289
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Please this is Square Enix

1290
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Please be respectful of the characters

1291
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Don't do anything

1292
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Don't make the naughty mods

1293
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
No naughty mods

1294
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
We trust you

1295
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Oh god why do we trust you

1296
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Meanwhile have you seen the hairdresser?

1297
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
I can't

1298
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
I can't fucking wait for

1299
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Mods to be unleashed on Final Fantasy

1300
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
15 it's like

1301
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Dark Sakura

1302
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Look years and years and years

1303
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Of having it always be the women

1304
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Being objectified in these games

1305
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
And in the modding communities

1306
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
And the titties hanging out and all this stuff

1307
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Years and years of that is finally

1308
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Gonna be rectified and caught up with

1309
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
With Final Fantasy 15

1310
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Here I am playing Final Fantasy

1311
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Dongs everywhere

1312
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
I'm fighting a giant dick with a dick

1313
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
In my hand and I'm shaped like a dick

1314
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
It comes from

1315
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
11 with the man harness

1316
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
You know what I mean

1317
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Oh yeah the armor

1318
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Yes Final Fantasy 11

1319
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
And 14 were some of the first games

1320
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
To be like slut

1321
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
The men were just as slutty as the women

1322
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
And what's his face who I hate?

1323
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
I don't know

1324
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
You ate everybody

1325
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
No who had the logo?

1326
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Bobby Blackwolf?

1327
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
No in Final Fantasy 14

1328
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
I was gonna say was it the 11th?

1329
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Hildebrandt

1330
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
The 11th sublegar

1331
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
That's it

1332
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
That's what I was trying to think of the name

1333
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Let's see

1334
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Rama in chat says Rob Roberts starring

1335
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
In Leather Dream Daddy

1336
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Did you see my cosplay for DragonCon?

1337
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Did you just catch that?

1338
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
I got recognized by two people

1339
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
JD in chat says

1340
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Final Fantasy 15 Conan Exiles

1341
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Version, anything's possible

1342
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Anyway all that talk aside

1343
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Here's the thing

1344
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
The Legend of Zelda

1345
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Breath of the Wild has clearly had

1346
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
An influence upon the Final Fantasy

1347
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Team in a quote from

1348
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Director Hajime Tabata the director

1349
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Of Final Fantasy 15 he's talking about

1350
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Zelda saying quote I've heard a lot

1351
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
From the dev team and their reactions to having

1352
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Played Zelda but just from hearing

1353
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
The stories and the feedback you know

1354
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
We can tell that it's a really complete game

1355
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
It's very polished almost a perfect game

1356
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
In that regard and our goals

1357
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Are probably to take that experience

1358
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
That players felt with Breath of the Wild

1359
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
But with our own technology and our own

1360
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Know how we have in our disposal

1361
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
To create a very very high

1362
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Quality game with a strong visual

1363
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Element to it while creating a world

1364
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
That's really immersive and really beautiful

1365
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
That's probably our goals in terms of

1366
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
What we want to be with our next project

1367
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
It was kind of interesting hearing about

1368
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
The influence of you know Zelda

1369
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Breath of the Wild and what it kind of you know did for

1370
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
That series and now we're hearing that other

1371
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Developers are getting influenced by it but man

1372
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
You know I know it's a little early

1373
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
To talk about Final Fantasy 16

1374
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
But my assumption is that

1375
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Is something that has to happen eventually right

1376
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
We have to talk about Final Fantasy 16

1377
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Eventually right

1378
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
If not now then maybe the next E3

1379
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
I mean maybe

1380
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Square is still kind of on the hook to like

1381
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Actually release the Final Fantasy 7

1382
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Remake first before we can really talk about

1383
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
16 but here's my thing is that

1384
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
And I think I've talked about this a little bit

1385
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Before but if you want to talk about like the open world

1386
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Expansiveness Final Fantasy 15

1387
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Kind of did that

1388
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
In parts you know right

1389
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
We all know that one of the chapters

1390
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Can go on forever because you just do

1391
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Side quests after side quests

1392
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Final Fantasy kind of had that 15 to an extent

1393
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Can you imagine

1394
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
A game in Final Fantasy 15's engine

1395
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
But

1396
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
All the characters

1397
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
All the land

1398
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
All the story and all the universe

1399
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Is like Final Fantasy 9

1400
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
But in Final Fantasy 15's engine

1401
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Like how fucking rad would that be

1402
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
And the reason why I specifically call out 9

1403
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Is because 9 was kind of that call back

1404
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
To the classic Final Fantasy era right

1405
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Like you know 7 and 8

1406
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Were kind of the more like

1407
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
There were modern settings they were different

1408
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
8 not as much but it was just very different

1409
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
It didn't look like you know the classic Final Fantasy games

1410
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
But characters like Vivi and stuff

1411
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
In Final Fantasy 9 really kind of gave it

1412
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
That classic Final Fantasy look so imagine

1413
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
That in Final Fantasy 15's engine

1414
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
And then it's like open and immersive

1415
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
And not like

1416
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Necessarily as tunnel visioned as the old

1417
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Final Fantasy games because if you think about it

1418
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
The original Final Fantasy like

1419
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
And a lot of the even later

1420
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Final Fantasy's they're very fucking tunnel visioned

1421
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Aren't they like you know

1422
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
You need the canoe to get to the river

1423
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
And then you need the airship to cross the mountains

1424
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Like it is very

1425
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
It's great it's still a great game but it was

1426
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Kind of you know tunnel vision

1427
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
So I think it would be just awesome to see

1428
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Something like that in like a very

1429
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Open world you know quest

1430
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Type setting like Final Fantasy 15

1431
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Maybe that's part of the reason

1432
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
I like 14 so much

1433
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Because even though it's online

1434
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
It does feel a lot of that

1435
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
It's a really good start in that direction anyway

1436
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Something you want to say with that Logie?

1437
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
I'd rather just remake 6

1438
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
I guess

1439
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
I guess but remakes have to

1440
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
You know go on the back burner at some point

1441
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
They're already remaking 7 whether we like it

1442
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Or not I don't know is

1443
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Dark Sakura before we get to your story

1444
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
With the Final Fantasy 7 remake

1445
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Are you apprehensive

1446
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
About it or are you looking forward to

1447
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Killing Aerith in HD

1448
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Over and over again

1449
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Oh that bitch is dead

1450
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
I'm gonna omni slash her

1451
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
What if they

1452
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
What would you do if in the remake they

1453
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Changed it so that you could bring her back to life

1454
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
That bitch ain't getting my

1455
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
You know resurrection

1456
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Phoenix down not for you

1457
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Phoenix up

1458
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
No I know it's referring

1459
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
To the down on the feathers

1460
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
I know I know

1461
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Phoenix up is still funny

1462
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
That's a good name for a band and rock band

1463
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Phoenix up

1464
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
You don't get Phoenix down

1465
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
You get Reaper down

1466
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Or as Bobby Blackwolf in our chat says

1467
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Phoenix up yours Aerith

1468
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
I just don't like her

1469
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
You don't say

1470
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
After 700 episodes of this show

1471
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
I haven't fucking figured that out

1472
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
She's a man stealing hoe bag

1473
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Dungeon Buster in chat says

1474
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Forget Aerith I want a fantasy star classic

1475
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Revival with the return of Nae

1476
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Actually

1477
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
How about since we didn't get

1478
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Since we didn't get into this with the Nintendo Direct

1479
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Now that you've opened that Pandora's box

1480
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Dungeon Buster

1481
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Here's the thing

1482
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Where the fuck is

1483
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Fantasy Star Online 2 in the US?

1484
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Did you know that during

1485
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Japan's Nintendo Direct

1486
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
This week they got the announcement

1487
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
The Fantasy Star Online 2 cloud

1488
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Or whatever is coming to the Switch

1489
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
So they get Fantasy Star Online on their TV and on the go

1490
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
You know what we've got with Fantasy Star Online?

1491
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Jack shit

1492
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
What is Sega's

1493
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Fucking problem with this game?

1494
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Not wanting to release it in the US

1495
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
What's your damage Sega?

1496
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
What did we do to you?

1497
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Release

1498
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
PSO 2

1499
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
In the US

1500
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
I should re-download that and re-patch it

1501
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
It was fun

1502
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Before y'all get started on

1503
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Yes there's a patch

1504
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
It would be nice to get some

1505
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Fucking official recognition from Sega

1506
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
That there are PSO fans that want

1507
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
To play this game here

1508
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Yes I understand the Switch

1509
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Is region free but that doesn't mean the servers

1510
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Are gonna be region free

1511
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Is having Sega

1512
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Give us a hug

1513
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Too much to ask

1514
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Apparently it is

1515
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Anyway

1516
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
I'm sorry

1517
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
I got disrupted by a chat

1518
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Comment there that got me wound up on a Loki rant

1519
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
How about you Dark Soccer do you have something

1520
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Positive to share with us in the news

1521
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Tonight?

1522
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Positively

1523
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
So we had talked about this a couple of times

1524
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
In the past but

1525
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
This is actually coming from

1526
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
CPN coverage

1527
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Which is pretty

1528
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Sorry CBS

1529
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
CBS coverage I was thinking news and then the end

1530
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Came out

1531
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
But they were having some coverage

1532
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
About more colleges now

1533
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Are rolling out scholarships

1534
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
For varsity video game players

1535
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Several schools now

1536
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
It looks like have their own

1537
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Esports team

1538
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
And I think it was

1539
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
I'm trying to find it in here because it listed

1540
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
What school it was

1541
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
One of the UC's just built an Esports arena

1542
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
UC Irvine

1543
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Did it

1544
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
And that now

1545
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
More and more schools are opening up

1546
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Their own

1547
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Esports teams

1548
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Like multiple teams per school

1549
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
And that actually

1550
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
It has

1551
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
It's almost now

1552
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Surpassed

1553
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Sports like physical sports

1554
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Activity in schools and they're offering

1555
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
More and more scholarships to that

1556
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
So

1557
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
And people are like yeah it

1558
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Rebuilds a sense of community

1559
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
And it's especially good for people who maybe

1560
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Can't get into the physicality of

1561
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
You know like football or

1562
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Baseball or something like that

1563
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
So I think it's pretty neat

1564
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
All those people who made fun of us

1565
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
For being nerds

1566
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Now people are going to college

1567
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
For being nerds

1568
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
You kids today

1569
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
You don't know how easy you have it

1570
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
You get a full scholarship for college

1571
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Because you're good at a video game

1572
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Back in my day that got you canned

1573
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
I would have killed for that

1574
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
What video game would you have gone

1575
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
To college on a scholarship for at our sakura

1576
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
What video game would have gotten you a full

1577
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Scholarship

1578
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Guardian legend at the time

1579
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
No I'm serious I was really good at it

1580
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
It makes me laugh though just imagining

1581
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
The guardian legend is an esport

1582
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
But it deserves it

1583
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Well I mean the era that I was going into college

1584
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Though it was Super Nintendo era

1585
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
When I was first going into school so

1586
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
I think that at that point

1587
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
It would have been like Kirby's

1588
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Avalanche

1589
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
I was really good at Puyo Puyo

1590
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Really good at Puyo Puyo

1591
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Not as good as I was

1592
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Loki what about you

1593
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
You would have gone to college a full scholarship

1594
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
On what game?

1595
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Well if we were talking college it would have been Mario Kart 64

1596
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Maybe

1597
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Damn you because you stole my answer

1598
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Well you sort of stole my answer

1599
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
My answer was going to be Super Mario Kart

1600
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
On the Super Nintendo because in the college dorms

1601
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
The Playstation and the

1602
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
N64 had just come out

1603
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
But college kids couldn't really afford it

1604
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
So I still had the last gen of games

1605
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
So the guys used to come over

1606
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
And we would play Super Mario Kart

1607
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
And it got brutal

1608
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
With that game

1609
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
But I always fucking won

1610
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
I'm not as good now

1611
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
As I used to be

1612
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
I'm sure my recent streams are evidence of that

1613
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
With the new fangled Mario games

1614
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
But there's always that

1615
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Alright but Mario Kart 64

1616
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
For you Loki

1617
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
I guess I don't know

1618
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat was in a similar place

1619
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
I got it in 64

1620
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Pretty early and my dorm was the Mario Kart 64 dorm

1621
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
People came into my room

1622
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Just to play four player battle mode

1623
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Actually it wasn't me

1624
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
That got the Nintendo 64 first

1625
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
It was the guys right upstairs

1626
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
If we're talking like it's not technically a video game

1627
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
But the best game

1628
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Or the game that I was the best at

1629
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
At that time would have been

1630
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Q's are laser tag

1631
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Oh that would have been your scholarship

1632
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Right there with Q's are

1633
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
I've been awesome

1634
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Anyway and I don't know if your

1635
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
I don't know if your college

1636
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Was anything like mine Bobby

1637
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
But those guys upstairs that used to play Mario Kart

1638
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
They used to get so

1639
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Fucking high before they would play Mario Kart

1640
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Like it was

1641
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
That room was just like a giant fucking cloud

1642
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
And then

1643
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Mario Kart 64

1644
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Something about the colors I'm sure

1645
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Now when I was actually in college though

1646
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Totally World Cup Soccer 94 pinball

1647
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Which is why I

1648
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
I own one now

1649
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
The other game that we played in the dorms all the time

1650
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Was since we all had our own phone lines

1651
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
I know I've told this story on OLR

1652
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Since we all had our own phone lines in those little rooms

1653
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
We used to

1654
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
And it was still dial up back then

1655
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
The high speed hadn't hit the dorms yet

1656
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
So we were still doing dial up

1657
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
So we would dial into the college internet

1658
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
And we would play Duke Nukem 3D

1659
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
Over the phones

1660
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
That was my first LAN game

1661
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
On Friday nights we would leave our doors open

1662
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
And we would be playing Duke Nukem 3D

1663
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Over the phone basically

1664
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
It was good times

1665
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Did you ever do the voice macros?

1666
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Where you could hit it and go

1667
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
I came here to kick ass and chew bubble gum

1668
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
And I'm all out of gum

1669
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
My face was your face, your ass

1670
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
What's the difference?

1671
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
I remember all that stuff

1672
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Good times

1673
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Anyhow

1674
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
So let's move on, Loki what do you have for us?

1675
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Maybe another game that kids can go to college on

1676
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Yes it's the new game

1677
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Well it's not so much the game of the week anymore

1678
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
But it's a popular game

1679
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Or one of the popular games

1680
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Player Unknown's Battlegrounds is now the most

1681
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Played game on steam

1682
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Of all time

1683
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
That's right it's hit the record

1684
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Of um

1685
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
1.349

1686
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Million players

1687
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
That's it's peak

1688
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Previous record which of course

1689
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
And Dota 2

1690
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
That was March of last year

1691
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
They were 1.291

1692
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
So not bad

1693
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
And of course also

1694
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Across the 15 million concurrent

1695
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Steam users

1696
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Or steam had just crossed that

1697
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
The other thing of course they're doing with it

1698
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
They're tweaking

1699
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
It is kind of becoming a problem

1700
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
In the game with people idle farming

1701
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
So like in

1702
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Counter Strike Go

1703
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
You can

1704
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Get different items

1705
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
In the game, loot boxes

1706
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Or whatever and you can sell those items on the steam marketplace

1707
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
To make money

1708
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
And so people were just going idle

1709
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
In the game because they would still earn the currency

1710
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
In the game to

1711
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
You know be able to

1712
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Oh no you should get kicked out if you're inactive

1713
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
So now they've got more things

1714
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
In place to basically check to see

1715
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
If they're just sitting there

1716
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
It's going to be harder for people to do that

1717
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
So that is something

1718
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
That they're working on as well

1719
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Stoppy in chat says

1720
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
It's crazy the guy who made the game is the black sheep of his family

1721
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Now he's set for life and taking care of his parents

1722
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Amazing success story

1723
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
No good I mean good for him

1724
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
You know it's hard to hate on somebody who's made a successful game

1725
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Even if I don't really play it

1726
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Well here's my question

1727
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Actually

1728
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
And those of you that are familiar with this game

1729
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
I would think this answer is pretty easy

1730
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
But maybe it's not

1731
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Are you able to just set up a game

1732
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Where it's nobody

1733
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
It's nothing but people you know

1734
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Like you can set up a friends only game

1735
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
It's like 100 people are playing

1736
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Yeah but can I play like a lower version

1737
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Can I play like an 8 player version

1738
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Where it's just people we know

1739
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
I think right now because I'm on a laptop

1740
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
And I don't really have like the keyboard mouse

1741
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Set up like I can't do

1742
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Mouse and keyboard basically

1743
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Because I'm just not used to that

1744
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
I'm used to playing on a controller

1745
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Well Xbox has got you covered

1746
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
For the years up

1747
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
But it's interesting

1748
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Like I was watching there was an article

1749
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Kind of looking at some of the stuff today

1750
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
About people are speed hacking in the game

1751
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
And so running around really fast

1752
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Because they're saying you know right now

1753
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
They're anti cheating systems

1754
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Not perfect but they're showing

1755
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Like one of the guys is like

1756
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
He's a big CSGO player

1757
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
And the guy's like speed hacking just running past him

1758
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
He just takes him out

1759
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
Just knocks him out

1760
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
He's like I'm too good for this shit

1761
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
So that was kind of fun

1762
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
See MXC in chat says you can set up your own team

1763
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
But I think that is still online against a mass of players

1764
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
That's not really good enough for me

1765
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
I would like to have a mode that's kind of more like private

1766
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
So that I could just play with other people

1767
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
Like me and my skill set

1768
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
And other like vlog people

1769
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
And twitter people and stuff like have our own

1770
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
I think a lot of people aren't that great on it

1771
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
I mean I don't think it's a lot of

1772
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
There are some people that are good at it

1773
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
There's a lot of factors that's kind of random too

1774
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Because it depends on where you drop

1775
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Where the center of everything

1776
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
The arena is going to be

1777
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Plus they have new maps now

1778
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
So there's a lot of

1779
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Random factors in there that may affect it

1780
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Alright

1781
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
I think I need to check this game out

1782
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
How much is it? It's not a full 50

1783
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
It's like 40 bucks I think

1784
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
I think I need to check this game out

1785
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
I do

1786
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
I'm apprehensive because first person shooter

1787
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Right yeah it's hard

1788
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Like coming into something like that

1789
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
And even like Overwatch for me

1790
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
It's kind of hard to like

1791
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
You have to really be like doing this constantly

1792
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
To be any good at it

1793
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
But I don't know

1794
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
I guess I'm a filthy casual now

1795
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Let's see going to our chat

1796
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Bobby Blackwell says you're going to find PUBG modes

1797
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
I keep wanting to say

1798
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
PUBG modes

1799
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Even though I'm getting the letters reversed

1800
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
You're going to find PUBG modes

1801
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
In all the AAA games now

1802
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
Fortnite has a PUBG mode already

1803
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
GTA online already has something

1804
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
It'll just be like

1805
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
Horde mode in Gears of War

1806
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
Like every game

1807
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Mass Effect got something like that

1808
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
You know what you'd probably like actually

1809
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
That's kind of similar

1810
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
It's basically Hunger Games

1811
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
The Hunger Game mod is in

1812
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Minecraft

1813
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
It's pretty low

1814
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
You don't have to be a super expert player

1815
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
It's literally

1816
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
Hacking people with pickaxes

1817
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
There's not a whole lot of skill there

1818
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
But that looks a lot of fun

1819
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Every time I've seen people play that

1820
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
I do play Overwatch

1821
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
So it's not like I'm completely apprehensive

1822
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
To first person games

1823
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
The thing I'm really learning about Overwatch

1824
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
As much as I like to play characters

1825
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Like Sombra and Pharah

1826
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Honestly, I just have the best luck

1827
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
When I play Mercy

1828
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
I don't want to say I'm good at Mercy

1829
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
But I'm

1830
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
I play Mercy well enough

1831
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
Where I really feel like I'm pulling my weight

1832
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
As opposed to certain other characters

1833
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
What we really need is

1834
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
We need an actual

1835
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Umm

1836
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
What is it

1837
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
Umm

1838
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
What the fuck

1839
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
The movie that started it all

1840
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Not Hunger Games

1841
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Battle Royale

1842
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
We need an actual Battle Royale game

1843
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
We said that years ago

1844
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
Fuck the Imitators, we need the actual Battle Royale game

1845
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Didn't we have a, Dark Tetsuya

1846
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
Didn't we have a list list

1847
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Years ago

1848
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
That was

1849
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
What movie do we need to make a game out of

1850
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
And tell me

1851
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Battle Royale wasn't in the top 3

1852
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Had to have been

1853
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Had to have been

1854
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Maybe it's on the wiki somewhere

1855
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
Everybody's trying to be Battle Royale

1856
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Battle Royale is just Battle Royale

1857
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
S.H.O. 100 Matt says good thing Overwatch

1858
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
Doesn't have commands like heal please

1859
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Protect please, oh no

1860
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
Oh no S.H.O. 100 Matt

1861
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
It does

1862
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
You can hit I need healing

1863
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Or I need armor

1864
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Look

1865
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
I fucking know you need healing

1866
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
I'm playing a healer

1867
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Sometimes you're fucking hiding behind a wall

1868
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
How am I supposed to fly to you if you're hiding behind the fucking wall

1869
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
And the other thing that pisses me off

1870
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Is when I'm playing Torbjorn

1871
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
I need armor

1872
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
I will fucking throw you

1873
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
All the fucking armors in the world

1874
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
When I have enough scrap

1875
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
But if you want to get mad at somebody

1876
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Get mad at the person that keeps

1877
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Picking it up off the ground when they don't really need it

1878
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
I'll even try to like not

1879
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Throw the armor in front of that person

1880
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
But they still run over and get it

1881
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Unfortunately

1882
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Totally doesn't work in that game

1883
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Dark Tetsuya says

1884
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
Episode 66

1885
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
Movie that most needs a video game

1886
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
Okay, this is the scientific list list

1887
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
Process here on OLR

1888
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
The official answer is from our list list

1889
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Number 3, Kill Bill

1890
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
That was a good choice, that was a very good choice

1891
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Number 2, Clerks

1892
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Can't imagine how that would work

1893
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
I don't know what we were thinking

1894
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
At that time, but it's kind of funny

1895
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
If it's based off the animated series that'd be fun

1896
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
I think the animated series was still kind of

1897
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
New in our minds at that time

1898
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
And then number 1, Battle Royale

1899
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
So sure enough

1900
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
On episode 66, we said they should make

1901
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
A game out of Battle Royale

1902
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
So Pugbee guy needs to pay up

1903
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Hey, I still won the Paper Plate Battle Royale

1904
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Alright

1905
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Let's move on

1906
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
More stories for you guys here on episode number 700

1907
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Let's talk about a new game

1908
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
That's been announced for the Nintendo Switch

1909
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Although, I think this is actually a

1910
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
I want to say it's like a

1911
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Re-updating or something

1912
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Of a Apple TV game

1913
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
And of course the site I'm trying to pull this story from

1914
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Is now not working, so I'm going to do this best for my memory

1915
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
But Super Beat Sports

1916
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Is a harmonics game

1917
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
And they have announced that that is going to be coming out on

1918
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
The Nintendo Switch

1919
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
This game was originally out for the Apple TV

1920
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
But I don't think a ton of people

1921
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
Are gaming on there

1922
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
Some are, but just obviously the Apple TV

1923
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
Is not a gaming device

1924
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
So I think their audience is limited

1925
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
It's kind of cool, they have some pictures of their official site

1926
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
SuperBeatsports.com

1927
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
So you can play these different sports

1928
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
It's harmonics, music, games

1929
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
And now it's going to be on the Switch

1930
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Yeah, they've got like five mini games

1931
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
So based on familiar sports they said like

1932
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Tennis, hockey, golf, and volleyball

1933
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
You play with up to three players

1934
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Or four players I guess

1935
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Motion controls

1936
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
They're saying, you know

1937
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Or non-motion controls

1938
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
I don't know, neat

1939
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Looks like a little Wii Sports

1940
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Type of game

1941
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
As I saw a bit of the game on their live stream

1942
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
It looked neat, yeah, I know they were live streaming

1943
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Some of it earlier this week, so that's pretty cool

1944
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
So, alright

1945
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Alright, well let's move on

1946
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
With some more news, DarkSakura

1947
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
A computer gaming legend, right?

1948
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Oh yes

1949
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?

1950
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
Why are you not playing the music? In my pants

1951
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Not your pants

1952
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
I didn't

1953
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
Unless Carmen also

1954
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Is now you know

1955
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
Anyway

1956
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
I need the music, Rob

1957
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
It has to happen

1958
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
But anyway

1959
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?

1960
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Was

1961
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
An animated series in the past

1962
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
And it was a fun

1963
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Game show

1964
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
And

1965
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
I think

1966
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
Best theme song ever

1967
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Anyway, Netflix

1968
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
This shit didn't exist from

1969
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
I first played Carmen Sandiego on the

1970
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
Apple 2E

1971
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
This is what you babies

1972
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Got into in the 90's

1973
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
No, no, no, Rob

1974
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
It was all about where in time is Carmen

1975
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
Sandiego

1976
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
That was my jam

1977
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
You know me, history nerd

1978
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
As much as I love that theme as well

1979
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
It's all about the chief

1980
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
On the Carmen Sandiego

1981
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
She didn't give no shit

1982
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Anyway

1983
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Netflix has said

1984
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Okay, you missed it, great

1985
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
They've greenlit a new

1986
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Animated series with 20

1987
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
22 minute episodes

1988
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
That are coming out in 2019

1989
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
So

1990
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Apparently

1991
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
Gina Rodriguez is going to be Carmen

1992
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
Sandiego and Finn

1993
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
Wolfhard is going to be

1994
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
Her accomplice named

1995
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Player

1996
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
So even though this has to do with

1997
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
A TV show

1998
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
A cartoon, a Netflix revival

1999
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
Maybe it will cause

2000
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
A revival of the computer games

2001
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Because I think people forget that the game

2002
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Show came from computer games

2003
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
Or maybe updating the computer games

2004
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
That might have more modern

2005
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
References to real countries

2006
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
That exist

2007
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
Kids today need to never be able to fucking find her

2008
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Sorry, Czechoslovakia doesn't exist anymore as a country

2009
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
Oh, good point

2010
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
The USSR doesn't exist

2011
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
As a country

2012
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
The world has changed

2013
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
The world has changed

2014
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
And then

2015
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Carmen is keeping herself alive through

2016
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
Secret rituals

2017
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Involving the blood of every past gumshoe

2018
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
That she's defeated

2019
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
She's now a vampire

2020
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
cannibal

2021
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
That is being produced by

2022
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Houghton Mifflin Harcourt

2023
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Which is a name I haven't seen since I was like

2024
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
In high school

2025
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
Reading my schoolbooks

2026
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
So, yay

2027
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
Yay

2028
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
Now we have to listen to the theme song the whole rest of the show

2029
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
No, because I think there's

2030
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
Copyrights that prevent that from happening

2031
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
Anyway, by the way

2032
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Before we get to our next story, taking a step back

2033
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
Real quick, Bobby Blackwolf decided

2034
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
To jump in and look at the complete

2035
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Listless archive just because he was bored

2036
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
And thinking about that segment

2037
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Are we really boring him that much? I think so

2038
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
This is relevant, this is important

2039
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
Bobby Blackwolf says we did a listless

2040
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
In 2014 that was

2041
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
What are we most looking forward to

2042
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
At E3 2014

2043
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
The number two answer

2044
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
You ready for it? The number two answer that night?

2045
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Fantasy Star Online 2 on the Wii U

2046
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Here we are three years later

2047
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
Let's go home, we're done

2048
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Sega can suck a fuck

2049
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
Yes, I'm gonna use that phrase

2050
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
Because I can't think of anything more appropriate

2051
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Than the anger I'm feeling at Sega

2052
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
Sega, suck a fuck

2053
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
And besides, I think we're owed some reparations

2054
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
For the fucking Sonic the Hedgehog series

2055
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
I mean

2056
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
But they did kind of redeem themselves with Sonic Mania

2057
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
And Sonic Generations was good

2058
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
It's a start

2059
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Are we to forget all the other games that they made?

2060
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Rob, they can eat a sack of dicks

2061
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
Zombie dicks

2062
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
Real zombie dicks

2063
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Pulsating

2064
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
With the occasional, you know, fly attached to it

2065
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
She's

2066
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Flying around the world to steal zombie dicks

2067
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
All the zombie dicks

2068
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Act Deft in chat

2069
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
Act Deft in chat says

2070
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
We need a new list list, how can Sega go

2071
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
And fuck themselves for PSO

2072
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
Moving on

2073
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Just a few more stories than the classic game

2074
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
Of the week

2075
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
Loki

2076
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
So, it was very

2077
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
Exciting to see that Journey

2078
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
I mean, a totally different game

2079
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
Not Journey, but totally Journey

2080
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
Coming to Apple

2081
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
TV, iPad, and iPhones

2082
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
From that game company

2083
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
It's called Sky

2084
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
And it's like if you replace sand

2085
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
With clouds in its journey

2086
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
But it looks good

2087
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
Well, we don't know until we play it

2088
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
It's totally related

2089
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
I would be really interested to try it out

2090
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
On my Apple TV

2091
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
What I played on my Apple TV to date

2092
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
Is Sonic CD

2093
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
With the right soundtrack, Bobby

2094
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
The Japanese one

2095
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
But, um

2096
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
And it's episode 700

2097
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
So you're gonna let her have her moment

2098
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
And not cry tonight

2099
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
Yeah

2100
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
Anyway, so

2101
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
It's creatures that look humanoid

2102
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
But they're like floating

2103
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
And kind of flying

2104
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
And they have things that cause them

2105
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
And there's

2106
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
There's a big thing in the distance

2107
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
It has a beam of light

2108
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
It's fucking Journey

2109
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
But whatever, it looks cool

2110
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
I'll invest in it when it comes out

2111
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
I can't wait to play it on my

2112
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
Apple TV

2113
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
I can't wait to play it on my $1000 iPhone

2114
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
Because yes, the fuck I am buying

2115
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
Across the room, high five

2116
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
Yes, I am fucking buying that iPhone X

2117
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
And you can miss me with that Android shit

2118
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
10

2119
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
I didn't watch the press conference, I just read all that

2120
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
You can miss me with all that Android comparison shit, okay

2121
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
My husband has an Android

2122
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
So I get to see what's going on over there

2123
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
We're a bi-phonal household

2124
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
And that's the way we like it

2125
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
And get that sweet new screen into my hands

2126
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
Oh, girl

2127
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
I was watching that keynote

2128
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
And I'm like, yeah

2129
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
I don't need to pay off

2130
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
My student loan this year

2131
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Thank you, because Act F says buy phones

2132
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
There it is

2133
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
Alright, anyway

2134
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
S2100 Matt says, but that's so much money

2135
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
I don't know if that's said tongue in cheek

2136
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
We so don't care

2137
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
Well, isn't the Note 8 or whatever

2138
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
One of those Android, it's $950

2139
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
Something like that

2140
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
I already put down

2141
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
and priced what it's going to cost me for

2142
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
the 256 gigabyte model

2143
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
No, real talk for a minute

2144
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
And I don't care if you're iPhone or Android

2145
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
I really don't, it's your money

2146
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
Spend it on whatever makes you happy

2147
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
I'm going to let you know

2148
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
Do whatever you want

2149
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
Here's my thing, really, at the end of the day

2150
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
When it comes to my phone

2151
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
I'm at a point where

2152
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
I wouldn't have thought this 15 years ago when OLR first started

2153
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
I was using my shitty little flip phone

2154
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
that had the little tiny

2155
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
little 20 pixel big TV

2156
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
It looked like a Dreamcast VMU

2157
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
on the front that you'd use to take selfies

2158
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
I can maybe play NES problems on this

2159
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
Right?

2160
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
So 15 years ago I would have never thought this about my phone

2161
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
But the reality is, here we are living in this world

2162
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
I use my phone more than anything else

2163
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
Even my desktop PC

2164
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
That's how much I use my phone

2165
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
Especially with, you know, you guys know I do gaming

2166
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
with Pokemon Go and Ingress and all that other stuff too

2167
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
It's not even just that

2168
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
I use my phone everywhere

2169
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
So, honestly, I know

2170
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Yes, a thousand dollars is a lot of money

2171
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
Of course it's a lot of money, but that's why

2172
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
I haven't upgraded my phone in three years

2173
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
So I've been saving money knowing that I'm probably

2174
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
going to have to spend a lot of money to get a new phone

2175
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
And it's like, I probably paid more than that

2176
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
for my computer

2177
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
Which in reality I use less

2178
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
So

2179
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
Anyway

2180
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
Don't let anybody tell you how to spend your money

2181
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
You want to go buy a new Android phone? Go you

2182
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
That's awesome

2183
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
You want to go buy an iPhone SE?

2184
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
Because you don't need any of this new shit

2185
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
You just want a fucking phone? Awesome!

2186
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
Go you, get the phone that works for you

2187
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
But don't tell other people what to do

2188
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
Alright, moving on

2189
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
Let's see, what do we have next?

2190
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
Oh, oh, this is

2191
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
This is not good, but I guess a learning

2192
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
experience for everybody in this situation

2193
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
So Destiny 2, which I

2194
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
really, really want to play Destiny 2

2195
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
But I'm waiting for the PC version

2196
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
Because I just, I want my mouse and

2197
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
keyboard support, so I'm waiting on

2198
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
the PC version, so

2199
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
But I'm hearing a lot of good things from the people

2200
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
that are playing it on Playstation 4 and Xbox One

2201
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
right now, but one of the not so good things

2202
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
I'm hearing about is that

2203
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
Oh, some armor snuck

2204
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
its way into the game that was

2205
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
Oh, it was kind of a reference to

2206
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
white supremacy. Whoops

2207
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
Somebody screwed up on that one

2208
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
So, here's what, and a lot of people

2209
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
wanted to know, how the fuck did this happen?

2210
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
Like, how did this get into the game?

2211
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
And basically, it was one of those things where

2212
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
Bungie wrote this explanation about how

2213
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
they do draw from real world

2214
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
art iconography and other

2215
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
design elements, and what happened is that

2216
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
I guess the original meme

2217
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
kind of came to their attention. You know how sometimes

2218
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
memes get repurposed by

2219
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
other crowds for bad things?

2220
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
Isn't that what kind of happened to the frog?

2221
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
Anyway,

2222
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
Yes, because the frog is actually, it's a

2223
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
children's book. Yeah, okay, so

2224
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
So what happened is that they found, I guess

2225
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
the way I'm reading it from Bungie is

2226
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
they found the meme, but their own

2227
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
internal team did not realize that that had been

2228
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
repurposed into this flag

2229
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
that represented something completely different

2230
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
So, you know, Bungie apologized

2231
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
and basically promised to do better, and they are

2232
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
working to, I guess they did some

2233
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
recent maintenance where they've really kind of

2234
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
they haven't been able to scrub it completely

2235
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
from the game, but they've like

2236
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
they've changed it enough so that you don't

2237
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
really recognize what it was anymore

2238
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
and soon it will be completely

2239
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
scrubbed from the game. That is what they're

2240
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
doing there, so

2241
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
There you go!

2242
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
Dungeonbuster in chat says, wow, I play Destiny 2

2243
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
and I never heard about this. Well, my understanding

2244
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
is that ninjas went in the middle of the night

2245
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
during one of the maintenance periods and

2246
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
got rid of this from the game

2247
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
and that's what happened, so

2248
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
Bungie says, sorry about that, and it

2249
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
won't happen again, but it just, it also goes

2250
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
to show that the internet is a huge place

2251
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
and you gotta be careful sometimes because

2252
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
you know, you may not know that something you're saying

2253
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
Yeah, I mean, it's not like, it's not overt like

2254
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
oh, it's a swastika or something like that

2255
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
Yeah, it wasn't something obvious

2256
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
It looks kind of sporty

2257
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
like, it's like a sports

2258
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
thing, I mean

2259
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
I don't know, like a

2260
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
bike tracksuit type thing

2261
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
But now that we know what it is, it's not okay

2262
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
just to be clear

2263
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
Okay, just to be clear

2264
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
Anyway, let's

2265
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
get to a, go back to a time

2266
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
and a place when games weren't so fucking

2267
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
complicated

2268
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
It's the classic game of the week, and Dark Soccer

2269
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
is gonna step into the gaming vault tonight

2270
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
and pick a game that she says, hey

2271
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
brats

2272
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
you should be checking out this game

2273
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
We've been telling you for a while

2274
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
Now Dark Soccer, you've actually

2275
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
talked about a while, we started classic

2276
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
game of the week in what, episode number 250?

2277
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
Something like that

2278
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
So this would be, if I can math correctly

2279
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
this would be the 450th classic

2280
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
game of the week, give or take

2281
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
Not necessarily because of

2282
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
Marathon show, some one-offs

2283
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
And the classic console

2284
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
Oh, I forgot about the consoles

2285
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
Okay, so give or take the

2286
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
450th classic something something of the

2287
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
week, so the rules

2288
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
of the classic game of the week that

2289
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
was established some time ago is that a game

2290
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
must be 10 years older or more

2291
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
to be the classic game of the week

2292
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
But Dark Soccer, before I

2293
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
unveil tonight's classic game of the week and before

2294
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
somebody in chat says, that

2295
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
game didn't come out till November

2296
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
so it's not 10 years

2297
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
old Well fuck you, it's my segment, my

2298
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
rules

2299
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
So that is the official statement for Dark

2300
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
Soccer, it's my house

2301
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
And if you don't like it

2302
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
And I believe that my intent was that if it

2303
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
came out that year, and it wouldn't be

2304
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
the first time I've done it because I have done something like a month

2305
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
before

2306
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
So precedent has been set

2307
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
So take your opinion, shine

2308
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
it up real nice

2309
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
Turn it sideways and shove it up your candy

2310
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
ass, to quote

2311
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
Sir Rock

2312
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
But look, you don't want to taint this game

2313
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
with, you just know that people are gonna

2314
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
say something to chat about it

2315
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
So what is the classic game of the week?

2316
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
It's Mass Effect, duh

2317
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
Can you believe

2318
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
it's been 10 years though? I can't

2319
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
actually, that's crazy to me

2320
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
Oh, but this theme

2321
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
This theme is so fucking good

2322
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
I know

2323
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
It's sad because I just think about

2324
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
the ending scene, well I won't get ahead

2325
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
of myself, but anyway

2326
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
I always would let this go until Garrosh showed up on

2327
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
the screen and then I would start

2328
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
You can't

2329
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
start until your title screen has been blessed

2330
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
by Garrosh. Garrosh is space husband

2331
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
number two. Fair enough

2332
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
You don't know who space husband number one is

2333
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
in my fandom

2334
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
in my head

2335
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
Your own husband, Dan?

2336
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
Dan's not from space

2337
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
I'm talking about space husband. Technically this planet

2338
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
is in space, therefore he's from space

2339
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
Are you sure he didn't fall from space and hatch out of

2340
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
an egg? No, because he's not orc

2341
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
He's not aging

2342
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
and he doesn't drink orange juice through his finger rub

2343
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
Anyway

2344
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
Mass Effect, yes it did

2345
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
come out in November

2346
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
2007, but fuck it

2347
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
But it was probably gold in September

2348
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
It was in beta

2349
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
The critics had it, sure

2350
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
It was

2351
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
originally released for

2352
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
Xbox 360 in

2353
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
2007, and it

2354
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
of course is the first. It was intended

2355
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
from the start to be

2356
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
a multiple

2357
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
chapter series

2358
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
So we knew there would be more

2359
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
They left it open for more

2360
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
But you assume the role of

2361
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
Commander Shepard, who there's only

2362
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
one Commander Shepard in my heart

2363
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
Sorry Mark Meer, but Jennifer Hale forever

2364
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
Who was modeled first?

2365
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
True story

2366
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
We had FemShep first

2367
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
But basically it was

2368
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
So FemShep existed in September

2369
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
MaleShep did not

2370
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Or something like that

2371
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
Anyway

2372
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
It used the Unreal Engine

2373
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
3 for its groundwork

2374
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
and

2375
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
basically it was just

2376
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
built from the ground up

2377
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
to be an awesome

2378
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
piece of video game

2379
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
gorgeousness

2380
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
And of course now we've got wonderful high res mods

2381
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
and people are still

2382
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
I was talking to

2383
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
Becky the other day and she just finished it again

2384
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
So, good job

2385
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
Anyway you play as

2386
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
Commander Shepard

2387
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
Who you decide everything about

2388
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
her or him

2389
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
That looks like within the reasons of the game

2390
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
And then you bust out the mod manager

2391
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
And you change all of it

2392
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
And then

2393
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
you can take all your different

2394
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
specialties

2395
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
You can do different classes

2396
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
Either biotic or non-biotic

2397
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
And then you travel across the galaxy

2398
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
Chasing a

2399
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
completely, obviously

2400
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
looking

2401
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
messed up

2402
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
looking turian guy

2403
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
Who, I mean

2404
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
How can you look at him and go

2405
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
Oh he's not completely taken over

2406
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
by an

2407
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
inorganic species? No

2408
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
Not with his face looking like

2409
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
that and the circuitry

2410
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
peeking out of his body. No

2411
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
Saren's not evil. Saren's a nice guy

2412
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
He gives presents to small children

2413
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
And, you know, raises

2414
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
money for orphanages, I guess

2415
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Anyway

2416
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
So you take the Normandy

2417
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
all the way across

2418
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
Spending the entire game thinking about how you're gonna

2419
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
fuck that turian

2420
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
Wow

2421
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
No

2422
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
You have your romance options

2423
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
Which were just three people

2424
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
really, if you were

2425
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
a dude you could romance Ashley

2426
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
or Liara

2427
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
And if you were

2428
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
FemShep, you could romance

2429
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
Kaden or Liara

2430
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
Sorry, I'm just picturing in my head

2431
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
DarkSakura having a YouTube channel

2432
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
Hey guys, welcome to my YouTube playthrough

2433
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
of Mass Effect where I'm gonna fuck that

2434
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
turian

2435
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
Well, it's pretty much the theme of my Tumblr

2436
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
Anyway

2437
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
Um

2438
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
You've got more options

2439
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
in later games, thank God

2440
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
Cause, it wasn't

2441
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
very fair, I thought

2442
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
You know, dudes should have been able to

2443
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
strip Kaden

2444
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
Sorry, right from the beginning

2445
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
But no, you had to wait until the third game for that

2446
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
Sorry guys

2447
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
It was worth the payoff though, in the end

2448
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
It was kind of sweet, even though I still think he's too nice

2449
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
Oh my god, Liara

2450
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
in the first game pissed me off so much

2451
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
Because she's like

2452
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
Oh, I'm 106 years old

2453
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
But she's really, that's like

2454
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
being 15

2455
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
in Asari years

2456
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
Oh god, I do not have time

2457
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
for all of my rants

2458
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
Anyway, real time battles, those are fun

2459
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
You have

2460
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
your health bar, you can keep your squad

2461
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
members alive, you also have

2462
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
a morality system

2463
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
that

2464
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
leads you more toward

2465
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
the polite and selfless

2466
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
versus aggressive and hostile

2467
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
Which is now

2468
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
It can be known as

2469
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
Paragon or Renegade

2470
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
Paragon being how to charm people

2471
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
and Renegade being to intimidate them

2472
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
But yes

2473
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
I could go more and more

2474
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
and more and more and more about the game

2475
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
And

2476
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
I wasn't really into it when it first

2477
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
came out, it took me a while

2478
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
Same, same

2479
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
Well, wasn't I also the one that kind of told you

2480
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
you had to play it, give it a second chance

2481
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
I think I even said

2482
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
you'd be into the Tumblr fandom

2483
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
And then I heard Garrus' voice and it was

2484
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
over

2485
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
His voice actor

2486
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
is a very handsome fellow

2487
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
Kind of goofy, but

2488
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
I saw the episode of Buffy he was in and it wasn't

2489
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
a good episode, I'm sorry that such a

2490
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
talented actor had to be in that episode

2491
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
of Buffy, it was not good

2492
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
Anyway

2493
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
I really don't

2494
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
know how much more

2495
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
I can say about it

2496
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
This since had

2497
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
the first game had

2498
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
more DLC, Bring Down the Sky

2499
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
and then

2500
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
what was it, when

2501
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
Pinnacle Station, that one was

2502
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
okay, I didn't care for it

2503
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
because it had like all the

2504
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
deathmatch and capture the flag stuff

2505
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
that I don't think is fun

2506
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
But the

2507
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
game got really

2508
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
great reviews across the board

2509
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
For

2510
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
For the Xbox 360 version

2511
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
when it came out, Metacritic gave it a 91 out

2512
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
of 100, so that's definitely not bad

2513
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
But as far

2514
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
as other

2515
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
things, it won

2516
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
for the year it came out, it won

2517
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
Best RPG for the Spike Video Game

2518
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
Awards, Teambox

2519
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
Game Awards gave it Best Role Playing

2520
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
Game of the Year, Best Story, Best Game of the Year

2521
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
IGN, you know

2522
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
it won across the board

2523
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
on a lot of different

2524
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
best of's

2525
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
And of course now, He Who

2526
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
Shall Not Be Named, right?

2527
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
Honestly enough

2528
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
he kind of ended a controversy about

2529
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
this game

2530
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
Wouldn't necessarily end the controversy, but he

2531
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
he shot something down

2532
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
Basically, there was a neo-conservator

2533
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
blogger named Kevin McCollod

2534
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
Remember that, Rob?

2535
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
No. Anyway, he was

2536
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
you know, going on saying

2537
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
it had virtual

2538
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
orgasmic rape and blah blah blah

2539
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
blah blah, and

2540
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
He Who Shall Not Be Named

2541
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
literally

2542
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
said, this contrived

2543
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
controversy is absolutely ridiculous

2544
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
and it made the other guy shut up

2545
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
The guy who is the enemy of gamers

2546
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
everywhere

2547
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
A certain lawyer named Jack Voldemort, if I remember correctly

2548
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
Told this guy to shut

2549
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
the fuck up, and he shut the fuck up

2550
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
He apologized

2551
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
but said he's still considered the material offensive

2552
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
And it's basically people talking

2553
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
about shit in the game, who never fucking played

2554
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
the game, who were being assholes

2555
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
about it. Anyway

2556
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
So, eventually we have

2557
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
had other releases of

2558
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
this game

2559
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
Of course, I played it on PC

2560
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
which, you know, I also

2561
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
like modding the crap out of my game

2562
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
We had

2563
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
the Xbox 360 release

2564
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
Did it come out on

2565
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
It came out on PS3

2566
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
Um

2567
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
Eventually, you had to wait

2568
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
for the Mass Effect trilogy, I think

2569
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
for it to finally happen, but yeah

2570
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
And then it came out on Wii U

2571
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
Not the original Mass Effect

2572
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
Mass Effect 3 did

2573
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
The original Mass Effect was only on

2574
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
PS3, Xbox 360

2575
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
Xbox One backwards compatibility, and PC

2576
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
Yeah, which I, you know, like I said

2577
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
I played it on PC, modded the fuck out of it

2578
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
So that it has like

2579
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
The textures in my game

2580
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
look better than Mass Effect 3

2581
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
did when it came out, so

2582
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
Those space dicks

2583
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
looked so space dicky

2584
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
That hot Turian dicking in HD

2585
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
No, they didn't give us

2586
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
naked Turians. They had models for it

2587
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
Did you know that? Didn't put it in the game?

2588
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
No, I did not know that

2589
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
They had models for it

2590
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
Anyway, and because of this game

2591
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
I mean, now I've got a blog

2592
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
that is quite literally

2593
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
six people away from hitting 10,000

2594
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
followers. Nerd

2595
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
Fuck, I don't know how that happened

2596
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
I didn't think I was that funny

2597
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says

2598
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
There was this classic Fox News segment where Jeff Keighley

2599
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
was talking about it, Mass Effect

2600
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
And the opposing person admitted she had never even heard

2601
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
of the game until about five minutes before going on the

2602
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
air, and issued an apology

2603
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
after being actually shown the scene in question

2604
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
I do, I remember that controversy

2605
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
Yeah, about what?

2606
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
The sex scenes?

2607
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
Yeah, the sex scenes in the game, basically

2608
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
Casefully done, I'm on some fun

2609
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
It was basically

2610
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
Liara's space butt

2611
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
Oh god

2612
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
And so

2613
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
But I mean

2614
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
Yeah, actually

2615
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
it's even brought up

2616
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
The

2617
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
Anchor's name was Martha McCollum

2618
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
was her name

2619
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
Anyway, anyway

2620
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
It's just an awesome game

2621
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
If you haven't played it, why the fuck not

2622
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
if you've been listening to this show

2623
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
the whole time

2624
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
It's just really good, really fun

2625
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
and really accessible

2626
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
You can still get it on Steam

2627
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
Or, I don't think it actually is on Origin

2628
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
believe it or not

2629
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
Because I bought mine only through Steam

2630
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
I think it is on Origin now

2631
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
Maybe now, but I think it took it a while for Origin

2632
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
to actually update it since it

2633
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
I think they had some license thing with Steam

2634
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
Anyway, anyway

2635
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
And of course, if anyone is interested

2636
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
my Tumblr is

2637
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000

2638
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
ing.tumblr.com

2639
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
You can look at my stupid captions

2640
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
that I've been doing for fuck knows

2641
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
how long

2642
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
And apparently, a few people like it

2643
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
So

2644
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
And if any of my Tumblr followers

2645
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000

And shout out to y'all

Mass Effect is the best game ever

2649
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
Alright, there it is

Mass Effect

2652

2654
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000

We're going to get to the mailbag, we're going to talk about what

2659
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
Reggie had to say about the Super Nintendo Classic

2660
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
this week, and we'll talk

2661
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
a little bit about a parody account that's going away

2662
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
on Twitter

2663
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000

And we have one chance to get it right

2674
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
Welcome back everybody to Orange

2675
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
Lounge Radio live tonight, episode

2676
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
number 700 for

2677
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
this, September the 17th of

2678
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
2017, we've had a fun

2679
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
show, fun show

2680
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
so far tonight when I'm not getting tongue tied

2681
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
where there was even cake and

2682
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
fire, and cakes on fire

2683
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,000
but we made a wish

2684
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
Cake fire, what did you wish

2685
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
for Dark Sakura when you blew out the

2686
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
candles? If I tell you, then it won't come true

2687
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
Well, let's be real, it's not going to come true anyway

2688
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
because this is just a lie

2689
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
that we tell little kids

2690
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
I wished for impeachment

2691
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
Or safe

2692
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
Impeachment of me from the show?

2693
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
No, you're not an official

2694
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
Oh, you're right, that's right

2695
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
I'm a cheer tater

2696
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
Either that or you know

2697
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
anvil, piano, the same thing I

2698
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
want for Pat Robertson

2699
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
Alright, we're going to get back into some more

2700
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
gaming news, but I want to

2701
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
thank you guys again for being here tonight

2702
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
over in chat, over at live.vognetwork.com

2703
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
JD in chat actually says, elect Rob

2704
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
to public office 2018

2705
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
You know I've thought about it, and I know I've said this

2706
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
on the show before, because you guys know I've been with Alan

2707
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
for over seven years, but before I was with Alan

2708
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
a couple years before that

2709
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
and I don't remember if he would have been on this show because

2710
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
OLR was happening, but

2711
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
I actually dated a guy for about a year and a half

2712
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
who was a, well

2713
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
he had run for state assembly, he didn't

2714
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
win, thank god, but

2715
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
he had won, he had run for public office

2716
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
and I think I've said this before, from dating

2717
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
him and the experiences that I went through

2718
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
during that, I learned that

2719
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
any idiot can run for office

2720
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
and I think what you saw happen last

2721
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
year probably just accentuates

2722
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
that point, but any

2723
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
idiot can run for office

2724
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
Did you hear though that Eddie Izzard is running?

2725
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
I did not. In the UK.

2726
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
I did not. For, I think

2727
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
for, not for PM

2728
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
I'll have to look it up again, but still

2729
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
there's a big article I posted

2730
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
about it not too long ago, but Eddie Izzard

2731
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
is running. Well and then don't forget our pal

2732
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
Travis Donovan ran for

2733
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
I think it was mayor of Killeen, where he

2734
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
was, I think, so

2735
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
remember he ran for office, unfortunately he didn't

2736
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
it might have been city council, I forget, sorry, in retrospect

2737
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
I know it was like a very local race

2738
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
but it was cool to hear him go through that and talk

2739
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
about that on his show

2740
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
I've thought about it, but

2741
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
I'm torn because

2742
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
on one hand I'm like

2743
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
okay, with all the footage

2744
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
that's probably out there of me from the

2745
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
Rocky Horror Picture Show and some of the like weird

2746
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
shit I've said on stage, like I don't

2747
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
know if I ever could get elected to public

2748
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
office, or the vast 700

2749
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
episode library of this program

2750
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
somebody will take something out

2751
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
of context and put it out there and

2752
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
try to fuck with me if I were to run for office

2753
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
but then... He's running for

2754
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
parliament by the way. They had to listen to 700 episodes

2755
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
of that show. Yeah, then

2756
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
what great promotion for this show, but

2757
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
then we elected a guy president

2758
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
who said, you know, he was gonna grab

2759
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
what did he say? Grabbing pussies. Grab him by

2760
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
the pussy. Grab him by the pussy and that guy

2761
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
got elected president. So then there's a part of me that's like

2762
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
I guess it doesn't matter if I've said something stupid

2763
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
that gets taken out of context. Well he probably didn't really want to get voted for

2764
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
president, he just ended up becoming

2765
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
president. Anyway, I didn't mean to make this political

2766
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
but the story is really supposed to be that

2767
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
yes, any idiot can run for

2768
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
office and I've considered it

2769
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
I think it would be interesting, I think it would be fun

2770
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
I think I do

2771
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
a good job listening to people and

2772
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
playing mediators sometimes because

2773
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
again, even though people might

2774
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
try to take some of the stuff out of context that I've

2775
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
done with Rocky Horror Picture Show

2776
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
do you know how much fucking drama

2777
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
there is in theater troupes?

2778
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
Do you know how much fucking drama

2779
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
has to be mediated when you're running a fucking

2780
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
theater troupe?

2781
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
And for a while

2782
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
I did mediate that drama. I finally

2783
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
passed that on to somebody else who mediates

2784
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
it now and there's been no shortage

2785
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
of drama but

2786
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
for the years I did it

2787
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
I did mediate a lot of drama and so

2788
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
I think that's a skill that can be used

2789
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
in public office quite frankly

2790
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
so, anyway

2791
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
there it is. Going into chat

2792
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
over at live.vognetwork.com

2793
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
actdeftinchat says are you really worried

2794
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
about people taking you out of context

2795
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
considering the lots of OLR edits there

2796
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
are even done by yourselves

2797
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
Editing is a powerful thing

2798
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
and a powerful tool and I think it would be very easy

2799
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
to take something I've said on this show out of context

2800
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
and somebody could apply it to

2801
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
a totally different thing that wasn't

2802
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
about a video game or something

2803
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
you know, that's just a reality

2804
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
tigercolonchat says California did elect

2805
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
an actor as its governor at one time

2806
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
at two times actually

2807
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
there wasn't just Schwarzenegger

2808
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
one of those actors became president

2809
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
Ronald Reagan was also an actor

2810
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
way back in the day so was governor of California

2811
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
Who's president of the United States?

2812
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
Ronald Reagan, the actor?

2813
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
and there's your Back to the Future reference

2814
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
there it is, yes

2815
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
alright, let's get back

2816
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,000
into some actual video game talk now

2817
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
we do have some games to get to

2818
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
there's politicians out there

2819
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
that play video games, you bet the guy I used to

2820
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
date I think met his new boyfriend

2821
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
husband, whatever, on World of Warcraft

2822
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
so, maybe

2823
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
they're married, I don't know, who cares? Alright, moving on

2824
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
Loki, what do you have for us in games?

2825
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
alright, so

2826
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
this is kind of out of nowhere

2827
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
but Okami HD

2828
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
was announced for Playstation 4

2829
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
Xbox One and PC

2830
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
it's going to be coming out in December

2831
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
it's going to feature 4K support

2832
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
and

2833
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
also widescreen as the original game

2834
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
was just 4x3

2835
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
so they'll be coming out December 12

2836
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
digital and retail for

2837
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
$19.99

2838
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
that's a good price, yeah, looks pretty nice

2839
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
nice

2840
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
the game was kind of artistic anyway

2841
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
so it's

2842
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
maybe the best 4K game, but

2843
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
it'll look nice, I'm sure

2844
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
and then of course, because everyone's

2845
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
up in arms, everybody

2846
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
loves the new look of Mario without a shirt

2847
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
and everything, so

2848
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
now of course, take it

2849
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
to modders

2850
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
see, this is what happens when you trust

2851
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
modders, they're going to remove clothing

2852
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
and so now for

2853
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
Super Smash Brothers

2854
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
on the Wii U, they have a mod

2855
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
where it's shirtless Mario

2856
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
you can play as shirtless Mario

2857
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
of course, of course

2858
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
complete with Mario titty?

2859
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
complete with Mario titties

2860
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
as was meant to be

2861
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
per Nintendo's own direct, clearly

2862
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
alright, well, speaking of things

2863
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
that Nintendo has changed

2864
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
and apparently they have metal shirtless Mario as well

2865
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
metal titties

2866
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
even better, cut right through ya

2867
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
moving on to other news out of Nintendo

2868
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
hey, their Switch app

2869
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
which was, it's kind of a mess

2870
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
y'all, that Switch app was kind of a mess

2871
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
but they're trying to fix some of the issues

2872
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
with it, and one of the big ones

2873
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
was fixed this week, the 1.10

2874
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
update is out for the Nintendo

2875
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
Switch app, and voice chat

2876
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
will now work while in

2877
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
the background, and while other apps

2878
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
are up front and center, you know, just like

2879
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
Skype and Discord and stuff have worked

2880
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
forever, so Nintendo Switch app

2881
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
finally moving into 2017

2882
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
there ya go

2883
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
so, anyway, it hasn't fixed

2884
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
everything, but that was probably one of the biggest

2885
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
problems with it, so congratulations

2886
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
etc.

2887
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
a little less congratulations

2888
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
and more sadness towards the

2889
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
fans of Battleborn

2890
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
and probably hearing that the game is

2891
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
pretty much done at this point, they're not pulling the plug

2892
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
they're not taking the servers offline

2893
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
but after the upcoming fall update

2894
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
according to creative director Randy Varnell

2895
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
the servers will stick

2896
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
around for the foreseeable future, but

2897
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
it's just going to be pretty much a static

2898
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
game at that point, now in the fall update

2899
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
there will be skins, there will be balance patches

2900
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
but this is pretty much it

2901
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
the game is really only about

2902
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
not even a year and a half old, and it's been

2903
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
free to play for three months, what happened

2904
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
to Battleborn? Well, a little game

2905
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
called Overwatch that came out around the same

2906
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
time happened to Battleborn, so

2907
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
Battleborn,

2908
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
yeah, didn't do so great as a result

2909
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
so there it is, Battleborn

2910
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
is no longer going to really

2911
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
be supported after

2912
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
this next patch in the fall, but it'll still

2913
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
be up if you're still playing it

2914
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
moving on, Dark Soccer, what do you have for us in rapid fire

2915
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
news? Oh, just some stuff

2916
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
so a new

2917
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
character is

2918
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
been announced for Dragon Ball

2919
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
Fighter Z, going on with

2920
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
Yamcha and Tenshinhan

2921
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
is going to be an original character

2922
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
Jinzo Ningen 21

2923
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
or

2924
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
Nijuuji

2925
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
she's got glasses

2926
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
wears an interesting outfit

2927
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
and is nowhere in

2928
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
the series except this game

2929
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
but she's going to figure into story mode

2930
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
so, hey

2931
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
I'm pretty excited, I like how she looks

2932
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
she might be cosplay worthy

2933
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
and then in

2934
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
older news, there

2935
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
is

2936
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
Wonder Boy the Dragon's

2937
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
Trap on

2938
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
Nintendo Switch has outsold

2939
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
all the other versions combined

2940
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
so

2941
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
and it's a really good game

2942
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
it is, it's a great remake

2943
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
although I wish that the

2944
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
animal forms had like lady

2945
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
forms to go with Wonder Girl

2946
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
oh, I didn't even realize that that was missing

2947
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
well, Wonder Girl is in there, just

2948
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
no, I know Wonder Girl is there, but yeah

2949
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
but every form is still like the fish man, the mouse man

2950
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
I see, yeah

2951
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
okay, well

2952
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
the lion one's the coolest though because he drags the sword behind him

2953
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
I love the whole you can hit a button

2954
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
and instantly switch between like the Sega Master System

2955
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
well, look, it's not

2956
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
a direct port of the Master System game

2957
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
because it's still on widescreen, no, it's a complete remake

2958
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
yeah, but it looks

2959
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
you wouldn't be able to tell the difference, really

2960
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
you know, unless you are

2961
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
really, really a careful eye, and it has

2962
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
the FM music from the

2963
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
Master System version, nice, which even

2964
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
the cartridge, if you play it through an FM

2965
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
capable one, the US cartridge

2966
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
won't play it, nice

2967
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
so, it's a good way to

2968
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
get some of the stuff that we

2969
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
lost back

2970
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com

2971
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
Orange Right says

2972
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
it's really great to play that on a portable

2973
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
the Switch difference, with a trademark sign

2974
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
around that, I think, I bought

2975
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
Dragon's Trap on the Switch, and yeah

2976
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
I mean, the Switch makes a compelling argument

2977
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
for if it's the exact same game

2978
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
that's being sold on Playstation 4

2979
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
and Xbox One, the Switch makes a compelling argument

2980
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
for, I can pick this up and play on the go, if I buy it here

2981
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
that's why I kind of kicked myself

2982
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
when I got Sonic Mania on Playstation 4

2983
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
I mean, don't get me wrong, you know, it works

2984
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
great on Playstation 4, and the game is still good

2985
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
but I literally forgot it was coming out

2986
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
on Switch, and I wish I'd bought it there

2987
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
so, yeah

2988
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
it'll be interesting to see what

2989
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
Sony and Microsoft, if they choose

2990
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
to do anything in response, well I guess Microsoft

2991
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
kind of has the whole Windows 10 thing

2992
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
so, it'll be interesting to see if Sony brings back the Vita

2993
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
just kidding, I don't think they're going to do that

2994
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
they'll probably just rely on the more power

2995
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
that's in that system, as opposed to the Switch

2996
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
I mean, let's be real, the Switch

2997
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
is not capable of doing a game like

2998
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
Horizon Zero Dawn, so the

2999
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
Playstation 4 does always have that

3000
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
Alright, let's travel around and check out

3001
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
what is coming out in stores this week

3002
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000

Yeah, Pan Capu

3028
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
Okay, I don't know

3029
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
I don't know what that is

3030
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
It's just a thing

3031
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
Steam World Dig 2 on the Switch

3032
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000

And that's it

3050
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
In Japan, it's actually a pretty similar story this week

3051
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
for the Japanese releases

3052
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite

3053
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
also gets its Japanese release this week

3054
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
A couple days later on the 21st

3055
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
is when the releases are coming out in Japan

3056
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
Patapon gets its Playstation 4 release

3057
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
We already had that here in the US

3058
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
Looks like it was a couple weeks later in Japan

3059
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
So the Patapon PS4 releases this week

3060
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,000
And Project Cars 2

3061
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
also getting a Japanese release this week

3062
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
All that on the Playstation 4

3063
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
Over on the Nintendo Switch, just one release

3064
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
this week, but it's a pretty big one

3065
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
It's the Dragon Quest X all-in-one package

3066
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
Speaking of online games

3067
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
I would really like to see

3068
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000
make it released

3069
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
out here, that's one of them

3070
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
But also, actually I believe the Pokken Tournament

3071
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
is also being released in Japan

3072
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
Yes, it is, just a day later

3073
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
That's why I missed it at the first glance

3074
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
But Pokken Tournament does have the same day

3075
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
release as in the US and

3076
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,000
as even Europe as Star Soccer

3077
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,000
I'll get into it in a moment

3078
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,000
Certainly not leastly, on the Nintendo 3DS

3079
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
this week, Pocket Monster

3080
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
Gold and Silver

3081
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
is going to be released on the 3DS

3082
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
Of course, that is Pokemon Gold and Silver

3083
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
There are actually going to be little

3084
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
cards that you can buy in stores

3085
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
to then do on the eShop

3086
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
if you wanted to do it that way for whatever reason

3087
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
That is what you have to look forward to

3088
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
on the 3DS

3089
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
How about the UK Dark Soccer? I may have spoiled

3090
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
one of them, sorry, but that's a worldwide release

3091
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
On the 18th we have Echo for PC

3092
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
and PS4

3093
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
On the 19th, Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite

3094
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
for Xbox One, PlayStation 4

3095
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
and PC

3096
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
On the 22nd, we have Pokemon Gold and Silver

3097
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
Pokken Tournament DX

3098
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
The Lego Ninja Go

3099
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
video game

3100
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
on a bunch of stuff, and there you go

3101
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
Alright, now we're going to

3102
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
get to the mailbag

3103
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,000
Music

3104
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
Music

3105
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
Music

3106
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
Every week you guys email us your favorite

3107
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
stuff over at

3108
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
participate at orangeloungeradio.com

3109
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,000
Sometimes it's feedback for the show

3110
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
Sometimes it's, I don't know

3111
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
a pat on the ass and a job well done

3112
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
Sometimes it's

3113
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
uh, fuck you, you fucking fuck

3114
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
Sometimes it's got cake in the subject

3115
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
line

3116
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
Let's get to tonight's

3117
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
email, Dark Soccer

3118
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
Greetings peoples, this week

3119
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
I had a truly unique experience at work

3120
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
I talked to somebody

3121
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
Lately I've been taking my Nintendo

3122
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
Switch to work with me and playing Mario

3123
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
plus Rabbids

3124
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
One of my fellow employees

3125
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
saw me playing the game and asked me what kind of game I was playing

3126
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
I explained Mario plus Rabbids

3127
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
like this. It's like chess

3128
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,000
You have different kinds of pieces that can move and attack

3129
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,000
in different ways. There's also two sides

3130
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,000
who fight each other using tactics

3131
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,000
and strategy along the way

3132
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
Also there are Rabbids on acid

3133
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
I thought this was a good

3134
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
way to describe Mario plus Rabbids

3135
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
Given how my coworker reacted

3136
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000
he must have thought differently

3137
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
This experience brought up the following

3138
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
question that I'd like your input on

3139
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
What should I, why should I

3140
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,000
continue talking to people? I mean

3141
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000
you all claim to be

3142
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
sentient creatures, but some of you lack the sense

3143
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
lack the sense the demigod

3144
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
gave yeast. Stay drunk

3145
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
or entertainment

3146
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,000
Is that a flying spaghetti

3147
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
monster reference? I'm not sure

3148
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
It might be

3149
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
So why should I

3150
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
continue talking to people? That's the question for us

3151
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,000
this week. Don't

3152
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
If you don't want to talk to people

3153
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,000
don't. Don't do anything you don't

3154
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,000
want to do. I will say this

3155
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
that people who don't talk to other people in an

3156
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,000
office environment tend to

3157
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,000
get the piss

3158
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
end of reviews and

3159
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
you know aren't as well

3160
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
referred to because networking

3161
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
in your office is the way you

3162
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
You might be labeled a bitch if you don't

3163
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
smile. Or just the weird girl

3164
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
who sits in that cube with her headphones

3165
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
Well that was me. I was the weird girl

3166
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
that would sit in the cube with headphones

3167
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
Um

3168
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
But I actually hit my current job

3169
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
I fit right in with everybody else

3170
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,000
So, or you know what?

3171
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
Find a job that has cool people at it

3172
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000
Find a job where you don't have to talk if you don't want to talk

3173
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
Although I think it would be a good idea

3174
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
You do want to like at least talk to yourself

3175
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
in the mirror. Practice with your

3176
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
voice once in a while. Say it with me

3177
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,000
I'm good enough

3178
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,000
I'm smart enough and doggone it

3179
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
if people like me. Of course you should

3180
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,000
Just to make sure you don't like forget how to talk

3181
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:45,000
or that your voice doesn't go out or something like that

3182
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,000
You should still practice. And to be fair

3183
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,000
entertainment

3184
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,000
Some people might be pretty cool if you give them a chance

3185
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,000
and talk to them. So

3186
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
You know. There is a person underneath the suit

3187
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
That's right. Don't do anything you don't want to do

3188
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,000
But at the same time, take a risk

3189
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,000
Sometimes it can work out to your advantage

3190
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:03,000
Say hi to somebody new today

3191
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
And then listen for blackmail

3192
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
Say hi to a stranger

3193
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,000
No. Don't say hi to a stranger

3194
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
Cause they'll just give you a weird look and try to shoot you

3195
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,000
What if they have candy?

3196
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,000
Next email

3197
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
Hello LR. I write tonight

3198
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
not to respond to something on last week's show

3199
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000
Not to plug anything of mine

3200
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
And not to shower you with bad puns

3201
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
Instead the reason for this email

3202
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
Is two fold. First off

3203
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
I want to congratulate you guys on your latest milestone

3204
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
Thank you. Thank you

3205
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,000
700 episodes sounds like a lot

3206
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,000
Because it is. It is

3207
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,000
It represents an enormous amount of work

3208
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000
Literal thousands of hours

3209
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,000
Of headlines, insights, interviews

3210
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:43,000
And discussions. Plus the occasional

3211
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:45,000
Rant and the frequent food tangents

3212
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,000
Ok. Just to

3213
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,000
Math. I don't mean to bring math

3214
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:51,000
Into this. But I'm going to. Cause I know there's at least

3215
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
A couple math nerds out there. Now

3216
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,000
If I take 700 episodes

3217
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,000
And I multiply that by

3218
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,000
3 hours an episode

3219
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,000
Except our earlier ones were

3220
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,000
The earlier episodes were 2 and lately

3221
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:05,000
Our shows have been running like 2 and a half hours

3222
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,000
But

3223
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,000
We had marathon shows

3224
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,000
We did E3 specials that weren't numbered

3225
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,000
Technically we've

3226
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,000
I should be able to count the spinoff shows like courthouse 2

3227
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,000
So we're going to just say to make it easy

3228
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
3 hours. 3 hours an episode

3229
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,000
3 hour trainwrecks

3230
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,000
You could count

3231
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,000
The show you did on OLR where you did

3232
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
Pub of the volume. Thank you

3233
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:29,000
I'd love to bring that back if we had some licensing

3234
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,000
Well. Or look at

3235
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,000
Doing remixes

3236
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,000
Of overclocked or something. I don't know. Who knows

3237
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000
Alright anyway. So that's 2100 hours

3238
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,000
Ok. So I'm going to divide that

3239
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,000
By how many hours in a day

3240
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:43,000
24

3241
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,000
87 and a half

3242
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,000
Straight days of content

3243
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,000
Geez

3244
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,000
So you would

3245
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,000
To marathon this entire show would take

3246
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,000
About 3 months

3247
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,000
Just something to think about there

3248
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,000
For a minute

3249
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,000
You've built a community and kept it quite

3250
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,000
Entertained. As a part of that community

3251
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,000
Allow me to say thanks very much

3252
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
Not only for the massive body of work

3253
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,000
But also for continuing to put

3254
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,000
On this show each and every week

3255
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,000
For our enjoyment. Seriously thank you so much

3256
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,000
We'll keep meeting you at that dinner table

3257
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,000
This is a direct comparison

3258
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:19,000
But if we look at TV

3259
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,000
One of the stats I like to

3260
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:23,000
Point out a while back was

3261
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:25,000
The longest running

3262
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,000
Primetime television show

3263
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,000
The Simpsons

3264
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
618 episodes

3265
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
We've passed The Simpsons now

3266
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
South Park 278

3267
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,000
Gunsmoke 635

3268
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
Lassie

3269
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:41,000
We have more episodes on Lassie

3270
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,000
Fuck that dog

3271
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,000
Alright so moving on

3272
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000
Second I wanted to tell you that in working

3273
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,000
On the UI for super multitasking

3274
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
I discovered something, something

3275
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,000
Unbelievable. A fact that has been in front of my eyes

3276
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:55,000
For years in front of all of our eyes

3277
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:57,000
Actually but I never noticed it. Maybe none

3278
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
Of us did. So here it is

3279
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
The shift key on the right side of the standard PC

3280
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,000
Keyboard is whiter than the shift key

3281
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,000
On the left side of the standard PC keyboard

3282
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:07,000
This seems to apply to every keyboard I

3283
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,000
Have except for keyboards built into Mac laptops

3284
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,000
Where the shift keys are the same size

3285
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,000
He's right

3286
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,000
Like I've never noticed. I'm looking at the key

3287
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:17,000
And here I am looking at my Mac to confirm

3288
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:19,000
That they're the same

3289
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:21,000
Cause I'm on a Macbook Pro 2014

3290
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,000
Ok well the studio computer, I have a little

3291
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:25,000
Microsoft keyboard here that's probably as old as this show

3292
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,000
But sure enough the shift key on the right

3293
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
Is bigger than the one on the left

3294
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,000
Is that the same thing on a PC laptop?

3295
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,000
Yeah my laptop's like that

3296
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,000
Huh

3297
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,000
You know in about a couple

3298
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,000
More years we're gonna have more episodes in the

3299
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:41,000
My life too

3300
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:43,000
If we make it that long

3301
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:45,000
The show could end at any time

3302
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,000
Any time kids

3303
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:49,000
Any time

3304
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:51,000
Well am I the only one who didn't realize

3305
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,000
This up until now? Or is this a shocking

3306
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,000
Revelation for everyone present?

3307
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,000
Chatters! Press 1 if

3308
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,000
Your mind has been blown

3309
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:01,000
And by the way, yes Jamie

3310
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:03,000
I have been double spacing in between sentences

3311
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:05,000
For as long as I can remember

3312
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
I did take a keyboarding class in high school

3313
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:09,000
And I honestly can't remember whether I started doing that

3314
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,000
Before or after

3315
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:13,000
And there you have it! Have a great week everyone

3316
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,000
Erin Yyr

3317
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,000
Yeah it's something that's like

3318
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,000
A very common thing for people

3319
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,000
Who took typing

3320
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:23,000
Or had teachers who

3321
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:25,000
Used for computer classes

3322
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:27,000
Or nuns who would smack you with a ruler

3323
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:29,000
When you didn't do it the way you were supposed to

3324
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:31,000
Whatever. The double spacing is

3325
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
Let's see

3326
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,000
We have two, we have one

3327
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,000
We have a dash

3328
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:39,000
I always knew, I knew always

3329
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:41,000
Says fifth dream

3330
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:43,000
Come on buntiful cakes

3331
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:45,000
Says mind blown

3332
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:47,000
There you go

3333
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,000
What I'm curious about is

3334
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,000
How did that come into

3335
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:53,000
How did you find that out doing multitasking?

3336
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,000
I mean I imagine the shift key does something in your game

3337
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:57,000
But how did that become important

3338
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,000
That the left key was not as big as the right key?

3339
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:01,000
I'm curious now

3340
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:03,000
Well I think that the reason why is that on the standard PC

3341
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:05,000
It's done to line up with the enter key

3342
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,000
Yeah

3343
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,000
Because it's as long as the enter if I'm right

3344
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:11,000
Right you're right, not on mine

3345
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:13,000
Not on mine it is

3346
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:15,000
Well and I was looking at my mac

3347
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:17,000
And those two were the same but my return key

3348
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:19,000
Is the same size as my caps lock

3349
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,000
So the whole thing is fairly symmetrical

3350
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,000
Until you get to the arrow buttons

3351
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:25,000
Doesn't have to do with where your pinky

3352
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:27,000
Or your fourth finger goes when you hit the shift key

3353
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:29,000
Like if it doesn't stick out

3354
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
Far enough on the right side you might not hit it

3355
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:33,000
I don't know but now I need to

3356
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,000
Look at my iMac keyboard

3357
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:37,000
And see if it's set up the same way

3358
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:39,000
Because Mavis Beacon taught me how to type

3359
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,000
Who?

3360
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:43,000
Mavis Beacon

3361
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,000
Like the grandma of internet typing

3362
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
Right whatever

3363
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,000
I learned to type getting into

3364
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
A speed contest with my roommate at the time

3365
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,000
Because

3366
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:55,000
I wanted to be able to keep up with the AOL chat room

3367
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:57,000
Never forget

3368
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:59,000
F F F space J J J J

3369
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:01,000
Space F F F F space

3370
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,000
J J J J

3371
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:05,000
Guess you didn't take typing

3372
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:07,000
I didn't take typing

3373
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,000
Mavis Beacon taught me

3374
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:11,000
I learned on my own time

3375
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:13,000
I didn't formally

3376
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:15,000
Or through any type of instruction

3377
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
Learn to touch type

3378
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,000
I was kind of typing already

3379
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:21,000
But then I was like well maybe I should like learn to type faster

3380
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,000
So I started doing Mavis Beacon

3381
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,000
Teaches typing and I got faster

3382
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,000
Okay

3383
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,000
I learned through AOL

3384
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,000
Because of reasons

3385
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:35,000
And that's it for emails?

3386
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:37,000

Alright but keep it classy

3395
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,000
Doesn't have to be a clean joke but keep it classy

3396
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:57,000
Alright

3397
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
Let's get back into some gaming news. Loki

3398
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:01,000
Alright

3399
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:03,000
So I'll try to be positive

3400
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,000
Because we're talking about Nintendo

3401
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,000
Good luck with that

3402
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,000
We're talking about some classic systems

3403
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,000
Sending prayers

3404
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,000
So Reggie basically said

3405
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:15,000
Hey

3406
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:17,000
We know that the demand

3407
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,000
Is really high on these systems

3408
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:21,000
However I strongly urge you

3409
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:23,000
To overbid on SNES classic system

3410
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:25,000
On any auction sites

3411
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:27,000
You shouldn't have to pay more than

3412
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:29,000
$79.99 he says

3413
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,000
And promising that they're going to have

3414
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:33,000
More systems

3415
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:35,000
Available at launch

3416
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:37,000
That you know

3417
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:39,000
Okay not maybe plentiful

3418
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:41,000
But it will be

3419
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:43,000
Easier to find them

3420
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,000
So

3421
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:47,000
Don't buy from scalpers

3422
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:49,000
Which really is good advice you should buy from scalpers

3423
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:51,000
But kind of unheard of

3424
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,000
That they also announced

3425
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:55,000
That in 2018

3426
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:57,000
They're bringing back the NES classic

3427
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,000
So apparently you know

3428
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:01,000
There is a huge response obviously

3429
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:03,000
The demand is so high for the system

3430
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:05,000
That they decided that they're going to be bringing it back

3431
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,000
Summer of 2018

3432
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:09,000
With brand new shipments

3433
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:11,000
So

3434
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:13,000
Interesting. Wonder if it's going to have different games with it this time

3435
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,000
Probably not

3436
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:17,000
I think the only thing that will

3437
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:19,000
Probably have changed on that system

3438
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:21,000
Is however they hacked into that the first time

3439
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:23,000
Will probably be patched up

3440
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:25,000
And I can't believe nobody else is bringing this up

3441
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,000
At least not that I've read

3442
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,000
Like people are either going the route that you're going

3443
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:31,000
Or like oh maybe it'll be a 2.0 with new games

3444
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:33,000
Which ain't going to happen

3445
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,000
Or it's just the whole

3446
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:37,000
Oh they're finally remaking what they did before

3447
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:39,000
I don't think so

3448
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:41,000
I think there will be a change in that firmware

3449
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:43,000
And it's going to block whatever method they were using

3450
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,000
Now don't get me wrong

3451
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:47,000
I'm not stupid enough to say that

3452
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:49,000
But I'm just

3453
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:51,000
I am saying they're going to block whatever

3454
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:53,000
Has been doing

3455
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:55,000
Whatever is the method now

3456
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,000
A good indicator will be the SNES classic edition

3457
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:59,000
When that comes out to see

3458
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:01,000
What's capable of that

3459
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:03,000
I'm assuming that will be hacked immediately

3460
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,000
I would assume the same would be the NES classic

3461
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:07,000
Honestly I don't know

3462
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:09,000
Like I get it

3463
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:11,000
That people like to do that stuff

3464
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:13,000
But you know what the people like to do that stuff

3465
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:15,000
They probably would still

3466
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:17,000
They're not going to not buy

3467
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:19,000
It's just that they like all their stuff

3468
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:21,000
In one spot

3469
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:23,000
Although they're classic games in one spot

3470
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:25,000
Take the fucking hint

3471
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:27,000
Perhaps release the virtual console

3472
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:29,000
Perhaps you could even make

3473
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:31,000
A virtual console

3474
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:33,000
Since you're dicking around with a virtual console on the Switch

3475
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:35,000
Make a system that's like the NES classic edition

3476
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:37,000
That hey guess what

3477
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:39,000
It looks all retro and shit

3478
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:41,000
And it connects to the internet

3479
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:43,000
It connects the fucking ROMs to it

3480
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:45,000
And make it affordable

3481
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:47,000
Stopy in chat says yes

3482
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:49,000
I too expect a patch to combat hacking

3483
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,000
Original ones will still go for money because of it

3484
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:53,000
Over at live.vognetware.com

3485
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:55,000
It is a little weird that they're suddenly

3486
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:57,000
Coming out and saying they're going to make more of them

3487
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:59,000
But at the same time

3488
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,000
Is it super surprising? Not really

3489
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:03,000
I'd be curious to see how many

3490
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:05,000
Are going to make how readily available they're going to be

3491
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:07,000
And if companies like GameStop or

3492
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:09,000
ThinkGeek lock them behind

3493
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:11,000
Like a paywall to get that shit

3494
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:13,000
I'm also going to say this to Reggie's credit

3495
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:15,000
I know it's very easy to be cynical

3496
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:17,000
About what he's saying and believe me

3497
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,000
There's a large part of me that's very

3498
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:21,000
Cynical as well and I definitely feel

3499
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:23,000
Actions speak louder than words Reggie

3500
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:25,000
So if that's Super Nintendo

3501
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:27,000
If pre-orders are not supposed to be

3502
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,000
The barometer for availability for this thing

3503
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:31,000
Then I hope you're able to prove it

3504
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:33,000
Day one, actions speak louder than words

3505
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:35,000
But at the same time

3506
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:37,000
I'm hopeful that that action

3507
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:39,000
Is coming based on the fact that

3508
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:41,000
He said anything at all

3509
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:43,000
Cause let's be real

3510
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:45,000
He didn't have to say a goddamn thing

3511
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:47,000
So there's a part of me that's thinking

3512
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:49,000
Maybe there is

3513
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:51,000
Hope for people

3514
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,000
That do not yet have a Super Nintendo

3515
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:55,000
Pre-order but still want

3516
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:57,000
To get one of these. I mean that is a pretty

3517
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:59,000
Powerful statement for Reggie

3518
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:01,000
To come out and say, don't buy from

3519
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:03,000
Scalpers, we gotcha

3520
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:05,000
Now again

3521
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:07,000
I wouldn't

3522
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:09,000
I come from a place of pre-order

3523
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:11,000
Privilege with this because

3524
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:13,000
I do have a pre-order, at least right now

3525
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:15,000
I still have my pre-order with Best Buy

3526
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:17,000
But I like to think that even

3527
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:19,000
If I didn't have that pre-order secured right now

3528
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:21,000
I would

3529
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:23,000
Feel a little better about

3530
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:25,000
This but I'd probably still be going right

3531
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:27,000
At 8 AM or whenever the store

3532
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:29,000
Opens the day these things come out

3533
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:31,000
I still don't think they're gonna be that plentiful

3534
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:33,000
But maybe instead

3535
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:35,000
Of stores only getting

3536
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:37,000
24 of them or whatever it was

3537
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:39,000
Last time, I have to ask Allen how many it was when he went

3538
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:41,000
Remember when he camped out at Best Buy and still couldn't get one?

3539
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:43,000
Maybe

3540
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:45,000
Instead of 24 per store

3541
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:47,000
Maybe there will be

3542
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:49,000
72. You know, maybe the number's

3543
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:51,000
Gonna be a lot higher

3544
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:53,000
And something where people that do line up

3545
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:55,000
And bother to wait

3546
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:57,000
Will get one. So we'll see

3547
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:59,000
We'll see

3548
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:01,000
Alright

3549
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:03,000
SHA 100 Mountain Chat says

3550
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:05,000
Rumor is that

3551
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:07,000
Targets are getting 30-90 stocks

3552
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:09,000
Of Super Nintendo Classic

3553
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:11,000
I'll believe it when I see it

3554
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:13,000
Alright, let's move on to

3555
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:15,000
Some more stories

3556
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,000
Including a story about Final Fantasy 14

3557
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:19,000
No, I'm not gonna be

3558
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:21,000
Doing a big commercial for the MMO

3559
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:23,000
But I do think it's kinda neat

3560
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:25,000
That because of the hurricanes that have happened

3561
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:27,000
Recently here in the US, namely of course

3562
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:29,000
Harvey and Irma

3563
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:31,000
Which, you know, obviously those images

3564
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:33,000
Of the things that Harvey did in Houston

3565
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:35,000
And what Irma was doing to the keys

3566
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:37,000
You know, is really horrible what's going on

3567
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:39,000
And we talked about that last week

3568
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:41,000
Well, I don't know if you know this, but in Final Fantasy 14

3569
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:43,000
If you don't log into the game

3570
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:45,000
And go into your house

3571
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:47,000
Every something like 45-90 days

3572
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:49,000
I think it is

3573
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:51,000
I can't remember exactly how many days it is

3574
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:53,000
I wanna say it's as far as 90 days

3575
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:55,000
But it might be as low as 45

3576
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:57,000
But if you don't go into the house regularly

3577
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:59,000
It is demolished and the space

3578
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:01,000
Can be sold off to somebody else

3579
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:03,000
You get all the junk that was in your house

3580
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:05,000
Go to like a refund vendor

3581
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:07,000
Or something that you can still do for 30 days

3582
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:09,000
And you get some of the guild reimbursed

3583
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:11,000
But not all of it, but this system's in place

3584
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:13,000
We'll have to ask Allen about it because

3585
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:15,000
He didn't log into the game for so long, his house got demolished

3586
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:17,000
I was on

3587
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:19,000
When the demolition notice popped up

3588
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:21,000
I'm sure mine is long ago

3589
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:23,000
Well, did you ever buy a house?

3590
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:25,000
No, I just have a guild room

3591
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:27,000
Then you're fine

3592
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:29,000
Those don't go away unless I delete it

3593
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:31,000
Or whoever, no because you went to a different guild

3594
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:33,000
I went to a different guild

3595
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:35,000
Whoever your guild master is, as long as they didn't delete it

3596
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:37,000
Or kick you out of the guild then you still have it

3597
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:39,000
But anyway

3598
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:41,000
My point with all that is that

3599
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:43,000
Final Fantasy XIV and Square Enix

3600
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:45,000
They actually put a stay on that

3601
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:47,000
So right now they did a patch last night

3602
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:49,000
That stopped the clock

3603
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:51,000
Or not last night, it was Thursday night

3604
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:53,000
They did a patch that stops the clock

3605
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:55,000
It's been two weeks

3606
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:57,000
Yeah, two weeks starting on September 15th

3607
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:59,000
So there will be a two week grace period

3608
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:01,000
With no demolitions

3609
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:03,000
So this way people that are without power

3610
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:05,000
Or not able to log into the game for other reasons right now

3611
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:07,000
Will have an additional two weeks

3612
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:09,000
To get to a computer, log in

3613
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:11,000
And be able to keep their game

3614
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:13,000
And keep the house going and all that stuff

3615
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:15,000
I would imagine a lot of people just had

3616
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:17,000
A friend log in on their behalf

3617
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:19,000
But of course that involves giving your password away

3618
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:21,000
Which you're not supposed to do

3619
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:23,000
I'd be lying if I said I haven't done it in a similar scenario

3620
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:25,000
So somebody I really really trust

3621
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:27,000
Alright, there you go

3622
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:29,000
I just think that's kind of neat

3623
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:31,000
That the MMO is changing its rules to accommodate for

3624
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:33,000
The real world scenario

3625
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:35,000
Alright, Stoppy in chat says

3626
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:37,000
More like Final Foreclosure

3627
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:39,000
Am I right? Yes, yes you're right

3628
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:41,000
Alright, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

3629
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:43,000
Stuff

3630
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:45,000
Actually this one is

3631
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:47,000
Another way that video games

3632
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:49,000
Have done good things for people

3633
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:51,000
And actually this comes from

3634
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:53,000
Rome actually

3635
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:55,000
A Serbian father

3636
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:57,000
Who was living in

3637
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:59,000
Italy

3638
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:01,000
Actually had his thirteen year old daughter

3639
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:03,000
Trapped for four years

3640
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:05,000
To sell her

3641
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:07,000
To a buyer in France for

3642
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:09,000
Eighteen thousand dollars

3643
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:11,000
Yeah, good dad there

3644
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:13,000
And she

3645
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:15,000
Actually used

3646
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,000
A video game

3647
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:19,000
To help herself escape

3648
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:21,000
Um

3649
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:23,000
So I'm trying to find exactly

3650
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:25,000
What it was

3651
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:27,000
Um

3652
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:29,000
She was being groomed

3653
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:31,000
To be a child bride

3654
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:33,000
And um

3655
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:35,000
She

3656
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:37,000
Oh, hold on

3657
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:39,000
I'm sorry this is taking me a moment

3658
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:41,000
Anyway

3659
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:43,000
She had

3660
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:45,000
Been in school until she was thirteen

3661
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:47,000
And then she was locked up

3662
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:49,000
But she had

3663
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:51,000
A video game on a

3664
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:53,000
Simless cell phone

3665
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:55,000
That she would play

3666
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:57,000
But one day she got an alert

3667
02:12:57,000 --> 02:12:59,000
That she had

3668
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:01,000
A weak

3669
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:03,000
Password free wifi network

3670
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:05,000
Near her

3671
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:07,000
And so she used the wifi network

3672
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:09,000
On the video game to find

3673
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:11,000
A multiplayer feature on the game

3674
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:13,000
That she used

3675
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:15,000
To help

3676
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:17,000
Call for help

3677
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:19,000
She said that a lot of people ignored her

3678
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:21,000
Until they took it seriously

3679
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:23,000
And she gave the person the information

3680
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:25,000
And then the police were able to track her down

3681
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:27,000
So um

3682
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:29,000
She's under police protection

3683
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:31,000
Her asshole dad is in jail

3684
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:33,000
I hope the guy in France who was trying to buy her

3685
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:35,000
Is in jail

3686
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:37,000
Because that shit is not cool

3687
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:39,000
Yeah

3688
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:41,000
But um she used a video game

3689
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:43,000
It's interesting you know these stories

3690
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:45,000
Sometimes we've heard the dark side about how MMOs

3691
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:47,000
Result in really bad

3692
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:49,000
Situations for people when maybe young

3693
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:51,000
People meet people they met online

3694
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:53,000
On an MMO or something we've heard kind of the bad side of that

3695
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:55,000
So it's nice to hear the good side

3696
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:57,000
Too not that this story is necessarily

3697
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:59,000
Good because we get into this whole

3698
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:01,000
Element of human trafficking which is a really

3699
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:03,000
You know sick thing that's happening in our society

3700
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:05,000
And it's one of those things where it's like

3701
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:07,000
I think a lot of us don't realize that this

3702
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:09,000
Shit happens in the world and it's pretty sick

3703
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:11,000
But the good news is that

3704
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:13,000
This girl was saved

3705
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:15,000
Because of whatever it's curious that they

3706
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:17,000
Don't name the game she was playing

3707
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:19,000
But perhaps it's nothing we would recognize anyway

3708
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:21,000
Since she was in Italy right

3709
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:23,000
So you know it could be a game that was localized

3710
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:25,000
For you know Italian audiences anyway

3711
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:27,000
But it sounds like it was something where you could

3712
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:29,000
Interact with other players so thanks

3713
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:31,000
To the chat in the game you know she

3714
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:33,000
Got rescued she was able to put out that call for help

3715
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:35,000
So that's that's great

3716
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:37,000
And that's great that her dad was too stupid

3717
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:39,000
To think of that that that could be a possibility

3718
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:41,000
Yeah so

3719
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:43,000
Good on her yep

3720
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:45,000
Hope she's able to

3721
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:47,000
Turn life around and have a

3722
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:49,000
Great life in spite of that

3723
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:51,000
Really really really truly her hideous

3724
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:53,000
Experience yeah so

3725
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:55,000
Alright anyway

3726
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:57,000
Let's see going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com

3727
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:59,000
Kind of an interesting

3728
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:01,000
Story again about kind of like the good things

3729
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:03,000
Of gaming and you know kind of piggybacking on

3730
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:05,000
The Final Fantasy story

3731
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:07,000
We had a minute ago as Joe and Hunter Matt says

3732
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:09,000
I remember when Hurricane Sandy hit

3733
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:11,000
New York there was a mall in Connecticut

3734
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:13,000
That had power and offered free

3735
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:15,000
High-speed internet for people who are without power

3736
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:17,000
From the storm I remember seeing a

3737
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:19,000
Dude with his PC rig hooked up in the food

3738
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:21,000
Court of this mall doing his

3739
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:23,000
Wow dailies

3740
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:25,000
Maybe not what was

3741
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:27,000
Intended the Wi-Fi to be used for

3742
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:29,000
But people have their priorities

3743
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:31,000
All over the place actually when I

3744
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:33,000
Was in Alabama a couple years ago

3745
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:35,000
I went to the Dunkin Donuts

3746
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:37,000
And someone was there

3747
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:39,000
Two people were there with a full PC rig

3748
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:41,000
Playing MMOs

3749
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:43,000
You know and in spite of

3750
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:45,000
I'm sure some could make an argument that

3751
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:47,000
The internet traffic maybe shouldn't have

3752
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:49,000
Been taken up by that but at the same token

3753
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:51,000
You know in times

3754
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:53,000
Of crisis like people's mental

3755
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:55,000
Health is a very serious thing and maybe

3756
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:57,000
If this is what this guy kind of had

3757
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:59,000
To do to

3758
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:01,000
Take a mental break from the stress

3759
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:03,000
Of the situation then

3760
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:05,000
Is it really that bad

3761
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:07,000
As long as everybody else's internet was working then

3762
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:09,000
You know so be it right

3763
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:11,000
Anyway let's move on

3764
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:13,000
Just a couple more stories for you guys then we're gonna

3765
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:15,000
Open up the Skype line if any of you want to call in

02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:17,000
And say hello here on episode 700

3767
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:19,000
You'll have that ability shortly at

3768
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:21,000
Orange Lounge Radio all one word on Skype

3769
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:23,000
Please if you've never called the show

Before give Echo123

3771
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:27,000
A call first just to test your connection

3772
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:29,000
Meanwhile Loki

3773
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:31,000
I'm excited to see CEOs step down

3774
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:33,000
From their posts but

3775
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:35,000
I'm gonna have to report

3776
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:37,000
That CEO Kazurai

3777
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:39,000
The parody account on Twitter

3778
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:41,000
Is gonna be retiring

3779
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:43,000
2018

3780
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:45,000
Just uh

3781
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:47,000
The parody account

3782
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:49,000
The parody account yes

3783
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:51,000
It'd be funny if he came back it's like

3784
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:53,000
Somebody else like another CEO

3785
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:55,000
Well did you read the letter from the guy

3786
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:57,000
Who was running it and kind of

3787
02:16:57,000 --> 02:16:59,000
You know I guess the gist I got

3788
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:01,000
From it was that well the joke's running out

3789
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:03,000
And I don't really have the motivation

3790
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:05,000
That I once had yeah it was basically

3791
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:07,000
No here's what he says

3792
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:09,000
For over eight years now

3793
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:11,000
I've been running this Twitter account originally started

3794
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:13,000
Because I wanted to make jokes about video game news

3795
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:15,000
Rumors press conferences but I knew

3796
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:17,000
Nobody in real life would have

3797
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:19,000
Um knew

3798
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:21,000
Nobody in real life that would have gotten them

3799
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:23,000
Um between then and

3800
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:25,000
Now I have somehow

3801
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:27,000
Really managed to gain over

3802
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:29,000
100,000 followers

3803
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:31,000
Uh this has included people in the games media

3804
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:33,000
That I read on a daily basis

3805
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:35,000
People that I have worked with

3806
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:37,000
Some of my favorite games and most importantly

3807
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:39,000
Of all um Shuhei Yoshida

3808
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:41,000
And um you know

3809
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:43,000
Just it's been fun from the very start

3810
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:45,000
Ton of fun but it's been um

3811
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:47,000
You know looks like it's getting hard

3812
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:49,000
You know recently though I've been tweeting a lot less often

3813
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:51,000
Um you know

3814
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:53,000
I still play spend plenty of time playing

3815
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:55,000
I spend a lot less time following video game news

3816
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:57,000
Um basically saying

3817
02:17:57,000 --> 02:17:59,000
Therefore I've decided to

3818
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:01,000
That in 2018 will be the last year of the Twitter account

3819
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:03,000
Um

3820
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:05,000
So he says I want to do an account

3821
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:07,000
For one more for

3822
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:09,000
E3 I also want to give myself

3823
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:11,000
To do a proper ending

3824
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:13,000
For the account I just don't know what it is

3825
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:15,000
Going to be yet and

3826
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:17,000
I'm rubbish at giving things up

3827
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:19,000
So be interesting

3828
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:21,000
He used the word rubbish

3829
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:23,000
Must be overseas

3830
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:25,000
But all joking

3831
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:27,000
Aside and sleuthing on who might be running

3832
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:29,000
It aside

3833
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:31,000
It's interesting that there's such a

3834
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:33,000
Lead time on this you know what I mean

3835
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:35,000
I'm ending it after the next

3836
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:37,000
E3 which is still a good nine months away

3837
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:39,000
So

3838
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:41,000
That would be like me saying Orange Lounge

3839
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:43,000
Radio is going to be done in the

3840
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:45,000
Year 2020

3841
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:47,000
It's just quite a lead time

3842
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:49,000
Yeah it's I don't know

3843
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:51,000
Don't take me serious I don't

3844
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:53,000
This show is going to keep going

3845
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:55,000
Until it doesn't

3846
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:57,000
That's what I pretty much always said

3847
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:59,000
Alright

3848
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:01,000
Anyhow

3849
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:03,000
One more story for you guys before we

3850
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:05,000
Call it a night here and get to your calls

3851
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:07,000
Let's talk about Mario 64

3852
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:09,000
How about a new mod

3853
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:11,000
For Mario 64

3854
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:13,000
Well I don't know if I would call it a mod

3855
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:15,000
It's kind of weird because I don't think they exactly

3856
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:17,000
Modded the cartridge I think what they had to do

3857
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:19,000
They went in here and they actually like

3858
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:21,000
Did a patch for the emulator

3859
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:23,000
I think they like mod the emulator

3860
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:25,000
So instead of just hacking the ROM this tool for

3861
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:27,000
Mario 64 will let you

3862
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:29,000
Go into the virtual

3863
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:31,000
RAM of the emulator and then

3864
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:33,000
It shares information

3865
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:35,000
So that you can play

3866
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:37,000
Super Mario 64 online

3867
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:39,000
That's right up to

3868
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:41,000
24 people playing

3869
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:43,000
Super Mario 64 online

3870
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:45,000
With each other

3871
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:47,000
You can play as other characters too

3872
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:49,000
You can play as Waluigi which I think is very important

3873
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:51,000
To point out

3874
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:53,000
Princess Peach, Rosalina

3875
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:55,000
And what's great is they all play differently

3876
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:57,000
Like Princess Peach has her floaty

3877
02:19:57,000 --> 02:19:59,000
That you would expect right

3878
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:01,000
And Wario's in there and a lot of the other Mario characters

3879
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:03,000
Toad it looked like he ran really fast

3880
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:05,000
And you control each other

3881
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:07,000
What's that?

3882
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:09,000
Oh you control each other too?

3883
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:11,000
You can beat up each other and kill each other

3884
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:13,000
Oh that's awesome

3885
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,000
Well they already did against his first video that he put up

3886
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,000
Kinda yeah like the video got

3887
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:20,000
Taken down for the music

3888
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,000
Because they did use the music from

3889
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
Mario 64 in the trailer at least

3890
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
IGN because I guess IGN

3891
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,000
Doesn't get strikes on their channel because it looks like they

3892
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,000
Reposted it they just reposted the video on their channel

3893
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,000
And it's up it's fine you can see it

3894
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,000
So yeah just do check it out

3895
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
I do know that they had like a

3896
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
Website that's dedicated to their forms

3897
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,000
Or whatever that you should probably check out

3898
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:42,000
Just because I'm assuming that you know all these

3899
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:44,000
He has the links to the downloads

3900
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
In the actual videos

3901
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
But you know if you want to check out the forms

3902
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
It's sm64o.com

3903
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:52,000
And

3904
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,000
You know check out the updates on there

3905
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,000
But yeah I watched some gameplay of it today

3906
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
And it looks fucking hilarious

3907
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:00,000
Just like even watching people like there's

3908
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:02,000
I saw two people doing a

3909
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:04,000
120 star run or whatever

3910
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,000
And like during it

3911
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,000
One of the guys like was sitting there

3912
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:10,000
Doing like an animation or something

3913
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:13,000
And he put them behind it was funny

3914
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:15,000
It's just I don't know it's really cool

3915
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:17,000
You can see each other but it's not entirely

3916
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:19,000
In sync so you'll see like

3917
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:21,000
For example like when you're throwing the bomb king

3918
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:23,000
Or whatever off the mountain you'll see kind

3919
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:25,000
Of Mario spinning around there's like he's holding

3920
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:27,000
Nothing it's just like kind of spinning around

3921
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:29,000
But it's it's neat I don't know

3922
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:31,000
The 24 players at one time that

3923
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:33,000
I want to see some

3924
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:35,000
Awesome games done quick with that

3925
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:37,000
Nobody asked for this

3926
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:39,000
Before we open up the skype line which we're about

3927
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:41,000
To get to here so if you want to give us a call

3928
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:43,000
Orange Lounge Radio all one word

3929
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:44,000
On skype

3930
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:46,000
JD in our chat says regarding

3931
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:48,000
The last story about the

3932
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:50,000
Advanced notice of ending the account

3933
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:52,000
JD says I don't know in some ways

3934
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:54,000
It's kind of nice to give your fans some warning

3935
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:56,000
If it's possible though

3936
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:58,000
You know it may in some cases

3937
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:00,000
It's not always possible you know

3938
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,000
I don't know what will happen with OLR

3939
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:04,000
I don't like to think about ending the show right now

3940
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,000
It's just kind of one of those that's why I say it'll be done

3941
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,000
When it'll be done if we can give notice

3942
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:10,000
I think we will but if we can't

3943
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:11,000
Putting you on notice

3944
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:13,000
Then we're not going to be able to

3945
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:15,000
It just kind of depends on what the situation is you know

3946
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:17,000
I just think but maybe

3947
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:19,000
Do you think maybe there's too much

3948
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:21,000
Notice

3949
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:23,000
Nine months

3950
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:25,000
That's a lot of notice

3951
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:26,000
Just saying

3952
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:27,000
Yeah so anyway

3953
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:29,000
I don't know it's not necessarily a bad thing

3954
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:31,000
I guess didn't Lost

3955
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:33,000
Set their series finale like two

3956
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:35,000
Years in advance because Lost was kind of

3957
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:37,000
Starting to fall up it's own ass a bit

3958
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:39,000
So they the ABC was like

3959
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:41,000
We're going to set the end date now so that you know

3960
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:43,000
When the story needs to be wrapped up

3961
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:45,000
We also know like

3962
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:47,000
Game of Thrones is going to be the end too

3963
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:49,000
Yeah that's true

3964
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:51,000
We've known that for a while but that's Game of Thrones is also

3965
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:53,000
Based on books even though the books aren't done

3966
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:55,000
They've so deviated

3967
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:57,000
Yeah well yeah at this point

3968
02:22:57,000 --> 02:22:59,000
Hasn't George RR Martin kind of told them what's

3969
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:01,000
Supposed to happen in the books not that I guess that it matters

3970
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:03,000
They do deviate from the books but

3971
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:05,000
Not as much as Walking Dead deviates

3972
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:07,000
Though right? Doesn't Walking Dead deviate

3973
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:09,000
A lot more? I don't know

3974
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:11,000
I don't know because I don't care about Walking Dead

3975
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:13,000
Well and those shows are all on Sunday night

3976
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:15,000
Yeah

3977
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:17,000
I mean I was able to watch the entire run

3978
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:19,000
Of Twin Peaks but the whole on demand

3979
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:21,000
Element of that really helped so there was that

3980
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:23,000
Alright

3981
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:25,000
The Skype line is open right now

3982
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:27,000
Over at Orange Lounge Radio

3983
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:29,000
All one word on Skype

3984
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:31,000
If you'd like to give us a call you can do that right now

3985
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:33,000
In the meantime I'm going to check in

3986
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:35,000
While we wait for some calls and see if Loki has any

3987
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:37,000
Last minute stories

3988
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:39,000
Yes apparently there is some modders that are

3989
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:41,000
Making a demake of Half Life 2

3990
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:43,000
In Half Life 1's engine

3991
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:45,000
Called Half Life 2 Classic

3992
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:47,000
And it looks

3993
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:49,000
Old

3994
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:51,000
As Half Life 1 would look

3995
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:53,000
But yeah

3996
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:55,000
So apparently they have

3997
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:57,000
A demo that's available on ModDB

3998
02:23:57,000 --> 02:23:59,000
So go search for Half Life 2 Classic

3999
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:01,000
And you can check out what they've got so far

4000
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:03,000
Which

4001
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:05,000
I don't know

4002
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:07,000
The fans continuing to

4003
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:09,000
Deliver on Half Life when Valve will not

4004
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:11,000
You know

4005
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:13,000
They never asked if

4006
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:15,000
Whether they could it's just whether

4007
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:17,000
They should have

4008
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:19,000
Dungeon Buster in chat pointing out

4009
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:21,000
Regarding TV

4010
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:23,000
The Americans is also ending in a season or two

4011
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:25,000
I don't even know that show

4012
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:27,000
I have to look to Critical Myth reviews

4013
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:29,000
To tell me what's popular on

4014
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:31,000
TV right now because a lot of times I don't know

4015
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:33,000
But I just look at whatever John and his team is writing

4016
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:35,000
About Dungeon Buster in chat

4017
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:37,000
Also says this last season of

4018
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:39,000
Game of Thrones isn't based on any book

4019
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:41,000
Just a general outline

4020
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:43,000
By Martin and then Bob

4021
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:45,000
Coffee caught your reference that I also

4022
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:47,000
Caught with what you just said saying life

4023
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:49,000
Finds a way

4024
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:51,000
Orange Lounge Radio

4025
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:53,000
Again all one word on Skype

4026
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:55,000
If you want to give us a call here on our 700th

4027
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:57,000
Episode not that I'm guilting you

4028
02:24:57,000 --> 02:24:59,000
Into it but

4029
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:01,000
Or is Skype working?

4030
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:03,000
Hopefully somebody in chat if somebody

4031
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:05,000
Is trying to call and is not getting through

4032
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:07,000
Let me know because I know

4033
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:09,000
Bobby was having calls

4034
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:11,000
C Rama says we're not answering

4035
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:13,000
This happened earlier

4036
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:15,000
On another note speaking of Mario 64

4037
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:17,000
So apparently there's another guy

4038
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:19,000
I think the guy that was maybe doing

4039
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:21,000
I don't know if this is the same one that did the editor

4040
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:23,000
Like the Mario thing but he made

4041
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:25,000
Infinite size levels

4042
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:27,000
For Super Mario 64

4043
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:29,000
So he's got like a level that's like

4044
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:31,000
Mario Kart or something that Mario is running in

4045
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:33,000
That's ridiculous

4046
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:35,000
Oh it's in the WooHoo Island is actually where he's running around

4047
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:37,000
Wow that's crazy

4048
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:39,000
All these mods man

4049
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:41,000
So apparently

4050
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:43,000
Some of our listeners

4051
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:45,000
I was worried about this because remember how Bobby tried to call us

4052
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:47,000
At the end of the show and it wouldn't work

4053
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:49,000
But I'm on right now

4054
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:51,000
And I got the little green check mark

4055
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:53,000
Did you close it and open it again?

4056
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:55,000
I'm turning it off and then on again

4057
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:57,000
I have turned it off

4058
02:25:57,000 --> 02:25:59,000
And I've now turned it back on

4059
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:01,000
So we'll see if it'll work

4060
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:03,000
And what we'll do there

4061
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:05,000
We'll give it a minute just to see if anyone gets through

4062
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:07,000
If not shoot

4063
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:09,000
I should have had Plan B

4064
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:11,000
Up and ready to go

4065
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:13,000
But I didn't

4066
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:15,000
But we can always I guess field questions from chat

4067
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:17,000
If we have to do it that way but that's going to frustrate me

4068
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:19,000
Because that's even worse

4069
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:21,000
That's even worse than when Skype wouldn't work at all

4070
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:23,000
At least I could kind of see that

4071
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:25,000
So wait a minute

4072
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:27,000
Did the recent count just go up?

4073
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:31,000
Am I just not seeing the calls

4074
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:33,000
Come through because I see that this person

4075
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:35,000
Has tried to call twice

4076
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:41,000
Do they have a way to turn off notifications or something?

4077
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:43,000
I'm not sure

4078
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:45,000
I'm not sure

4079
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:51,000
It's that wonderful window

4080
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:53,000
I went into tools options

4081
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:55,000
And it's like think think think

4082
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:57,000
I'm trying to go into and this is the beauty of radio

4083
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:59,000
Everybody is that sometimes

4084
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:01,000
Let's see uh yes

4085
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:03,000
I don't want sounds but notification setting

4086
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:05,000
When somebody tries to

4087
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:07,000
Call me

4088
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:09,000
Yes I should see that

4089
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:11,000
Ugh

4090
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:13,000
That's awful

4091
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:17,000
Alright well

4092
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:19,000
On our 700th episode

4093
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:21,000
How appropriate that everything

4094
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:23,000
Shutting down

4095
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:25,000
I'm going to see

4096
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:27,000
If I can quickly put together plan B

4097
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:29,000
Can you guys fill like two minutes?

4098
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:31,000
Sure

4099
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:33,000
Let me sign out of Skype here

4100
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:35,000
While I put together plan B

4101
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:37,000
The joys of live radio

4102
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:39,000
Take it away low key in our soundtrack

4103
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:41,000
Do you have any stories we haven't covered?

4104
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:43,000
No I have not

4105
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:45,000
It's very slow

4106
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:47,000
Well I can see what I can dig up

4107
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:49,000
Umm

4108
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:51,000
I've been building with Legos

4109
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:53,000
While we've been doing this

4110
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:55,000
See because they have wonderful programs

4111
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:57,000
One through Bricklink which is called

4112
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:59,000
Stud.io or Studio

4113
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:01,000
And you can actually build stuff

4114
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:03,000
With digital Legos basically

4115
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:05,000
And what's kind of cool about it though

4116
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:07,000
Is when you're done building it

4117
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:09,000
You can build parts

4118
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:11,000
So I decided as an experiment

4119
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:13,000
Just to kind of learn the editor for this

4120
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:15,000
I'm building my house

4121
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:17,000
And so it's just been

4122
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:19,000
Laying out floor plans

4123
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:21,000
And stuff like that right now until I can

4124
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:23,000
Get something that looks proportionally

4125
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:25,000
Correct

4126
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:27,000
Are you going to put your house in your house?

4127
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:29,000
Yes

4128
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:31,000
Actually my idea

4129
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:33,000
My idea was if I can make

4130
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:35,000
You know some good

4131
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:37,000
Box that I would give them

4132
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:39,000
To my kids as Christmas gifts

4133
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:41,000
Because they would have

4134
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:43,000
Their own set and it would be cool

4135
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:45,000
Cause one of the ones I was going to do

4136
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:47,000
Cause I really like the Lego movie

4137
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:49,000
Stuff where they had kind of the remix sets

4138
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:51,000
So like they have one that's a fire

4139
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:53,000
Truck mech

4140
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:55,000
And so my

4141
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:57,000
Son wanted a garbage truck

4142
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:59,000
Mech and I found a garbage truck

4143
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:01,000
Design that's one of their

4144
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:03,000
Official sets that I thought that could work

4145
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:05,000
Well for that with just a little bit of tweaking

4146
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:07,000
And so I'm

4147
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:09,000
Going to do that eventually but right now

4148
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:11,000
While I'm learning

4149
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:13,000
How to actually use the editor I was going to start with something

4150
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:15,000
Easier like my house

4151
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:17,000
Which would be cool cause I just built

4152
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:19,000
One of the creator sets

4153
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:21,000
The fish

4154
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:23,000
Was the old fish shack or something like that

4155
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:25,000
Fish store

4156
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:27,000
And that was pretty sweet

4157
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:29,000
Kind of gave me a lot of fun ideas

4158
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:31,000
This is all part of the stupid obsession crap that I have now

4159
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:33,000
God damn Legos man

4160
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:35,000
I swear to god

4161
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:37,000
Such a mistake to

4162
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:39,000
Shouldn't have gone to the Lego store

4163
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:41,000
Should not have gone to the Lego store

4164
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:43,000
But now I'm just like

4165
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:45,000
Running low on money because of stupid Legos

4166
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:47,000
I keep looking at that Millennium Falcon

4167
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:49,000
It's so expensive

4168
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:51,000
And not really worth it

4169
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:53,000
I mean it's worth it if you're a fan of

4170
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:55,000
Star Wars I'm not that big of a fan of

4171
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:57,000
Star Wars

4172
02:29:57,000 --> 02:29:59,000
And here's the other problem too with those

4173
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:01,000
A lot of the collector sets like the modular buildings

4174
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:03,000
One they're way overpriced

4175
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:05,000
And two like

4176
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:07,000
For like my kids plan like I wanted

4177
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:09,000
I have the choice between

4178
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:11,000
One of the modular buildings

4179
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:13,000
Or the fish store

4180
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:15,000
One that I got

4181
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:17,000
And I went with the fish store one cause my son wanted a

4182
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:19,000
Diving mask for the mini figs

4183
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:21,000
And they had tons of them in there

4184
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:23,000
And so the only problem with the fish store

4185
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:25,000
Is it's meant as more of a

4186
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:27,000
Display piece

4187
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:29,000
Than being able to play with it

4188
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:31,000
Cause it's too tight to get your hand

4189
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:33,000
In there to actually move the

4190
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:35,000
Figures around or even the moveset

4191
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:37,000
It's just such a cramped thing

4192
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:39,000
And they even designed like the staircase going up to the office

4193
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:41,000
Where a mini fig can't even fit through there

4194
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:43,000
So I wanted to make something

4195
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:45,000
More that they can actually

4196
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:47,000
It's open and they can play with but it looks nice

4197
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:49,000
Okay I have Skype Plan B set up

4198
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:51,000
Alright cool

4199
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:53,000
I'm gonna hope it works

4200
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:55,000
But I don't know until we get a call

4201
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:58,000
So instead of Skype natively running through the computer

4202
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:00,000
What I've done is I went and grabbed my iPad

4203
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:02,000
Which is a new iPad

4204
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:04,000
It looks like it might be working so we're gonna see right now

4205
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:06,000
If this actually works

4206
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:08,000
If I hook it up this way taking the call through my iPad

4207
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:10,000
I'm trying to take this call

4208
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:12,000
And let's see if it works

4209
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:14,000
Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio who's this?

4210
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:16,000
Yay Plan B works

4211
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:18,000
Yay Plan B

4212
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:20,000
Thank God

4213
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:22,000
And we didn't need a prescription

4214
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:24,000
Thank God for Plan B

4215
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:26,000
Hey friend

4216
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:28,000
Oh wait wait are we playing a cam game now?

4217
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:30,000
Are we really doing it?

4218
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:32,000
We're on the iPad

4219
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:34,000
I got video

4220
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:36,000
Hey he can see you too

4221
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:38,000
The official alcoholic temperature

4222
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:40,000
Of Orange Launch Radio and the vlog

4223
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:42,000
Fireball

4224
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:44,000
I think that is

4225
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:46,000
Ewww veto

4226
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:48,000
I think that is part of

4227
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:50,000
That might actually be a Brad reference

4228
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:52,000
Brad from Pod Culture reference

4229
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:54,000
Let me check

4230
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:56,000
I'm gonna check our audio out

4231
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:58,000
When it's running here

4232
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:00,000
Sorry Rama can you tell us a little more

4233
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:02,000
About your drink that you're having there

4234
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,000
Oh

4235
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:08,000
Actually you are not even coming through

4236
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:10,000
The recording at all

4237
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:12,000
So

4238
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:14,000
Our podcasters

4239
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:16,000
Aren't even gonna hear them at all

4240
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:18,000
That's so stupid

4241
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:20,000
Alright let's try this I'm gonna move them over here

4242
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:22,000
Oh

4243
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:24,000
Oh no

4244
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:26,000
I know what it is

4245
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:28,000
I know what it is

4246
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:30,000
Yes it's live radio what can I say

4247
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:32,000
I'm having to go to Plan B

4248
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:34,000
How about now

4249
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:38,000
Now we can't hear them at all

4250
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:42,000
Oh my God this is the worst day ever

4251
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:44,000
No it's a great day

4252
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:46,000
It is a great day

4253
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:48,000
Cause we ate cake

4254
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:50,000
Line L mono

4255
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:52,000
On 910

4256
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:54,000
Now how can we hear them

4257
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:56,000
That is a lovely

4258
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:58,000
Studio you got there going Rob

4259
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:00,000
Yay it worked ok and it's coming through on both channels

4260
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:02,000
Thank God

4261
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:04,000
And I love this shirt as well

4262
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:06,000
Oh well thank you I appreciate that

4263
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:08,000
I didn't even dress to I'm wearing a shirt from

4264
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:10,000
Labyrinth and I didn't dress to be video

4265
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:12,000
Tonight so

4266
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:14,000
I don't think anybody do but you know

4267
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:16,000
We gotta put it on our best face

4268
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:18,000
That's right

4269
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:20,000
And now this shot of

4270
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:22,000
Fireball is to commemorate

4271
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:24,000
700 amazing episodes

4272
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:26,000
Thank you so much my friend

4273
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:28,000
I'll take a shot of

4274
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:30,000
Water or is it water

4275
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:32,000
I'm not

4276
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:34,000
I'm surprised you don't have a bottle of wine there

4277
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:36,000
I'm kinda surprised I don't either

4278
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:38,000
But maybe I think something about

4279
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:40,000
I'm actually gonna be giving you my bottles of

4280
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:42,000
Moscato when I can't drink them anymore

4281
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:44,000
Oh darn free wine what am I gonna do

4282
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:46,000
It's good wine too

4283
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:48,000
No she'll come over and help you drink that

4284
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:50,000
Wine

4285
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:52,000
Well Rama anything else you

4286
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:54,000
Want to say here on episode 700 I appreciate

4287
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:56,000
You beta testing this whole

4288
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:58,000
Plan B setup but

4289
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:00,000
At least we know it works now

4290
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:02,000
In IT a beta test is

4291
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:04,000
Generally the real deal so it's all or nothing

4292
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:06,000
As a

4293
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:08,000
Famous YouTube viral clip once

4294
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:10,000
Said fuck it we'll do it live

4295
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:12,000
There you go and by the way

4296
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:14,000
Metroid returns

02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:16,000
Samus is fucking amazing

4298
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:18,000
That game is awesome and since we

02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:24,000
Of my Samus 3DS

4303
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:28,000
And I love it so

4304
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:30,000
And I have to say I can't

4305
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:32,000
Give GameStop as much shit as I used

4306
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:34,000
To because I got

4307
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:36,000
A collector's edition from their store

4308
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:38,000
On Saturday you can give them as much shit

4309
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:40,000
As you want okay what's the I have to admit

4310
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:42,000
I missed the collector's edition so what is

4311
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:44,000
In the collector's edition that's not in the regular

4312
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:46,000
Edition hold on let me see if I

4313

02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:14,000
And it's a normal

4327
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:16,000
Cover but

4328
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:18,000
Oh that's where the flippy cover

4329
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:20,000
Is huh yep

4330
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:22,000
Reversible so you can make it an original

4331
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:24,000
Gameboy yeah I saw that

4332
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:26,000
And when I

4333
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:28,000
Went looking online just to see if I could

4334
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:30,000
Make sure I could find it it seems in the UK

4335
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:32,000
They got the legacy

4336
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:34,000
Edition which was more stuff I'm like

4337
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:36,000
Fuck yeah I thought I saw something on Twitter

4338
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:38,000
Where like this guy had like a ton

4339
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:40,000
Of that stuff it was like

4340
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:42,000
There was a sculpture

4341
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:44,000
Amiibo it was all this crap

4342
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:46,000
This is awesome art book

4343
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:48,000
Yeah but you know what

4344
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:50,000
From GameStop I got a box

4345
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:52,000
Of Reese's Puff cereal can't top that

4346
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:54,000
Why?

4347
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:56,000
I don't know I have a couple friends that work at

4348
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:58,000
GameStop I guess when you

4349
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:00,000
Picked up your copy of Metroid you got

4350
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:02,000
No no Ramy you don't need to answer that

4351
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:04,000
Why the fuck not Loki

4352
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:06,000
That's weird

4353
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:08,000
Why the fuck not

4354
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:10,000
Because it's weird

4355
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:12,000
No it's not weird

4356
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:14,000
Peanut butter is amazing in all forms and should be encouraged

4357
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:16,000
There's a bottle

4358
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:18,000
There's a thing of Jif right on top of my microwave

4359
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:20,000
Okay crunchy style

4360
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:22,000
Good times good times

4361
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:24,000
Alright my friend I'm gonna let you go to try and squeeze in some more calls since we lost some time here

4362
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:26,000
With the skype segment but

4363
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:28,000
I appreciate you as always hearts

4364
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:30,000
And good luck with everything on anime jam session this week

4365
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:32,000
Oh you got it you take care

4366
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:34,000
Yeah bro and play more Metroid

4367
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:36,000
Duh you don't have to tell me twice

4368
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:38,000
Alright see you my friend

4369
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:40,000
Alright bye

4370
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:42,000
So skype now works if you want to give us a call

4371
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:44,000
At

4372
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:46,000
Orange Lounge Radio all one word on skype

4373
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:48,000
And we figured that out so again it is hooking up

4374
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:50,000
At my ipad

4375
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:52,000
Through my mixing board and what was happening

4376
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:54,000
There earlier is that I had him plugged into

4377
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:56,000
A port where admittedly it was the left channel

4378
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:58,000
Only but that's because only on

4379
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:00,000
Some things will it work on the

4380
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:02,000
Left and the right channel where it's mono

4381
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:04,000
And I fixed all that so

4382
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:06,000
Now they said the only bummer

4383
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:08,000
Is that if you don't actually catch a call

4384
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:10,000
You're gonna hear the ringing noise

4385
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:12,000
I thought I'd picked up a call

4386
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:14,000
But apparently that didn't happen

4387
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:16,000
So if that person wants to call right back

4388
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:18,000
We'll try to get them on

4389
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:20,000
Again it's Orange Lounge Radio all one word on skype

4390
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:22,000
I think the bummer about the ipad

4391
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:24,000
Is it takes a minute to connect

4392
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:26,000
Versus the other one

4393
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:28,000
Takes a minute to come through

4394
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:31,000
Live on our 700th episode

4395
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:33,000
Of Orange Lounge Radio

4396
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:37,000
Whew

4397
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:39,000
So house-ception I only overheard part of that conversation

4398
02:37:39,000 --> 02:37:41,000
You're gonna give it to your kids someday

4399
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:43,000
Well I thought about like it would be cool to like

4400
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:45,000
Design a set

4401
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:47,000
For my kids that's like unique

4402
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:49,000
I like that

4403
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:51,000
That's a good idea alright let's see if maybe this call

4404
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:53,000
Is coming through now I think it is

4405
02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:55,000
Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this

4406
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:57,000
Hi this is Elliot B

4407
02:37:57,000 --> 02:37:59,000
Are you calling all the way from overseas

4408
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:01,000
Or are you still in New York now

4409
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:03,000
No I'm still in New York although it is a bit late here

4410
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:05,000
It's a little bit later but not like crazy later

4411
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:07,000
Well welcome to the show thanks for being here

4412
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:09,000
Yeah hey it's great to see you guys on camera

4413
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:11,000
Thank you

4414
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:13,000
Happy 700th

4415
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:15,000
We weren't supposed to be but things being as they are

4416
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:17,000
That's how it worked

4417
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:19,000
So thank you very much

4418
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:21,000
What's on your mind tonight

4419
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:23,000
It was actually my birthday today

4420
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:25,000
One minute left of it

4421
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:27,000
Happy birthday

4422
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:29,000
It is my good pal

4423
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:31,000
It's his birthday today too

4424
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:33,000
He was one of the hosts of Koopa Club

4425
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:35,000
When that show was still around

4426
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:37,000
So toast to birthdays

4427
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:41,000
What's on your mind tonight

4428
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:43,000
Well so I actually want to talk music games

4429
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:45,000
Please

4430
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:47,000
I managed to find

4431
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:49,000
I was in a second hand game shop

4432
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:51,000
In New York

4433
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:53,000
And found a second hand copy

4434
02:38:53,000 --> 02:38:55,000
For $20

4435
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:57,000
Did it have the controller with it too?

4436
02:38:57,000 --> 02:38:59,000
Right so not only

4437
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:01,000
Did it come with a controller it came with two

4438
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:03,000
Turn tables and a mic

4439
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:05,000
Oh nice

4440
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:07,000
Bexong two turn tables and a microphone

4441
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:09,000
That was like a collector's edition at one point

4442
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:11,000
Wasn't there like a collector's edition you could buy

4443
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:13,000
They had the one that was

4444
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:15,000
The collector's edition

4445
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:17,000
Actually had like a case

4446
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:19,000
That turned into a table

4447
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:21,000
So it had like a fold out thing

4448
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:23,000
To put the actual turn tables on

4449
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:25,000
That is a

4450
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:27,000
DJ Hero 2 is like severely

4451
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:29,000
Underrated as far as music games

4452
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:31,000
Go too because well have you had a chance to play it?

4453
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:33,000
Yeah yeah quite a bit

4454
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:35,000
What do you think? I was playing it this weekend

4455
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:37,000
I really like it I mean it's very very technical

4456
02:39:37,000 --> 02:39:39,000
I was surprised by how

4457
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:41,000
How complex the controls are how many

4458
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:43,000
Buttons and knobs and

4459
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:45,000
Sliders there are

4460
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:47,000
You know there's so many kind of things

4461
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:49,000
I'm used to kind of you know Guitar Hero

4462
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:51,000
Where you're just like you've got five notes

4463
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:53,000
And then maybe the hammer-ons and stuff

4464
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:55,000
And here you've got like you've got a crossfade

4465
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:57,000
And you've got to turn the dial

4466
02:39:57,000 --> 02:39:59,000
And you've got to scratch in different ways

4467
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:01,000
And yeah

4468
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:03,000
Yeah it's very different it's not like Beatmania

4469
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:05,000
2DX which is really easy to compare

4470
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:07,000
To be right there's a lot of other stuff

4471
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:09,000
That goes on but I think

4472
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:11,000
That game is tragically underrated

4473
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:13,000
Really and it just kind of it kind of fell

4474
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:15,000
Out because they oversaturated

4475
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:17,000
What was going on with Guitar Hero

4476
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:19,000
And Band Hero and all that stuff kind of

4477
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:21,000
Kind of oversaturated that market

4478
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:23,000
And it's a real bummer that DJ Hero kind of paid

4479
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:25,000
The price for that because that series is awesome

4480
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:27,000
And I really love the concept of

4481
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:29,000
Mixing the two songs together I think some of the

4482
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:31,000
Remixes that came out of those games are like the best

4483
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:33,000
I don't remember if it was in the game itself

4484
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:35,000
Or it was DLC but there is like a

4485
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:37,000
There's a Mary J. Blige versus

4486
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:39,000
Queen it's

4487
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:41,000
It's all of

4488
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:43,000
Me and Radio Gaga I think

4489
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:45,000
That is such a good mix

4490
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:47,000
It's so good

4491
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:49,000
Like that is like

4492
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:51,000
That song is like one of my favorite things to come out of

4493
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:53,000
A music game ever

4494
02:40:53,000 --> 02:40:55,000
Oh I have to look out for that no I don't think I've unlocked it yet

4495
02:40:55,000 --> 02:40:57,000
Yeah either it might be

4496
02:40:57,000 --> 02:40:59,000
See I feel like it might have been in DLC but

4497
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:01,000
Hopefully the DLC is still out there

4498
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:03,000
Yeah I really like the fact

4499
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:05,000
That it likes to do freestyle and stuff

4500
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:07,000
The improvisational aspects

4501
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:09,000
Like is missing from so many music

4502
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:11,000
Games there's no creation going on

4503
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:13,000
Right and you know it may just be

4504
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:15,000
Like playing samples to a beat

4505
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:17,000
But that bit is so much fun

4506
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:19,000
It's so rewarding

4507
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:21,000
Oh yeah it's great and yeah

4508
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:23,000
The fact that some music games that are done today

4509
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:25,000
Are kind of done a little bit lazier

4510
02:41:25,000 --> 02:41:27,000
Where they're not really key sounded

4511
02:41:27,000 --> 02:41:29,000
And I think with DJ Hero you had those key sounds

4512
02:41:29,000 --> 02:41:31,000
So it's like if you were playing things off beat

4513
02:41:31,000 --> 02:41:33,000
Or you are freestyling the key sounds

4514
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:35,000
Would kind of come out in the game and I think it's

4515
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:37,000
So much more effective than some of these lazier

4516
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:39,000
Music games that don't really

4517
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:41,000
Like you don't notice when you make mistakes if that makes sense

4518
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:43,000
Yeah exactly

4519
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:45,000
Well Elliot I'm very jealous

4520
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:47,000
Of your fine there

4521
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:49,000
Only 20 bucks for that

4522
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:51,000
I'm going to have to keep my eye out at some of the local thrift stores

4523
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:53,000
And see if maybe I can find a version of that

4524
02:41:53,000 --> 02:41:55,000
Of course I don't even

4525
02:41:55,000 --> 02:41:57,000
GameStop has that stuff

4526
02:41:57,000 --> 02:41:59,000
Do they?

4527
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:01,000
I bought DJ Hero 2 because I already had the turntables

4528
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:03,000
I bought a copy for like 2 dollars

4529
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:05,000
I bought mine really cheap too

4530
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:07,000
At a dimple

4531
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:09,000
I wish there was a way to play it on Xbox One

4532
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:11,000
But see there's been too many changes

4533
02:42:11,000 --> 02:42:13,000
With the last gen

4534
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:15,000
Was it on PC?

4535
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:17,000
No well it was wireless

4536
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:19,000
I have a

4537
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:21,000
I had a demo

4538
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:23,000
Controller

4539
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:25,000
So one of my controllers is wireless

4540
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:27,000
One of them is wired

4541
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:29,000
Which they never made a wired controller for that

4542
02:42:29,000 --> 02:42:31,000
But I bought the

4543
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:33,000
Was it the

4544
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:35,000
Demo unit because I got it early

4545
02:42:35,000 --> 02:42:37,000
With 3 songs

4546
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:39,000
Alright well we'll have to keep our eyes peeled

4547
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:41,000
But Elliot it's good to hear from you

4548
02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:43,000
Thanks for calling in on this episode tonight

4549
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:45,000
Yeah congrats, happy anniversary

4550
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:47,000
Isn't anniversary? Happy big number

4551
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:49,000
Happy big number, I think that's a good way to put it

4552
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:51,000
There was cake, happy cake

4553
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:53,000
Indeed, yeah

4554
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:55,000
It was weird cake, I saw it on Twitter

4555
02:42:55,000 --> 02:42:57,000
Awesome, alright you take care my friend, thanks for calling

4556
02:42:57,000 --> 02:42:59,000
Bye, have a good night

4557
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:01,000
Alright, Orange Lounge Radio

4558
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:03,000
All one word on Skype if you want to get through

4559
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:05,000
I could probably squeeze in one more call here

4560
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:07,000
Before we wrap things up for the night

4561
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:09,000
And I think we have one coming in right now

4562
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:11,000
So I'm going to try to take it

4563
02:43:11,000 --> 02:43:13,000
If it will connect, if the video will go through

4564
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:15,000
Of course I'm hitting the button

4565
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:17,000
And the iPad takes a little bit longer than the PC

4566
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:19,000
Does to do this, but when the PC doesn't work

4567
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:21,000
This is what you use, but I think we're finally connected

4568
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:23,000
Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

4569
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:25,000
Hey this is Raginator

4570
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:27,000
Hey Raginator, good to hear from you, what's up my friend?

4571
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:29,000
Not much, well first

4572
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:31,000
Just want to say happy

4573
02:43:31,000 --> 02:43:33,000
700

4574
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:35,000
And with any luck

4575
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:37,000
You guys will make it to at least

4576
02:43:39,000 --> 02:43:41,000
1337

4577
02:43:41,000 --> 02:43:43,000
So we can officially be elite

4578
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:45,000
Yeah, how many, let's see

4579
02:43:45,000 --> 02:43:47,000
If it took us 15 years to get this far

4580
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:49,000
Then it would probably take us about another 15 years

4581
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:51,000
To get that far

4582
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:53,000
So we would be looking at

4583
02:43:53,000 --> 02:43:55,000
First off I would be pushing

4584
02:43:55,000 --> 02:43:57,000
I would be 54 years old

4585
02:43:57,000 --> 02:43:59,000
At that point

4586
02:43:59,000 --> 02:44:01,000
And it would be the year 2032

4587
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:03,000
If I'm not mistaken

4588
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:05,000
And Half Life 3 still won't be out

4589
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:07,000
And Half Life 3 still won't be out

4590
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:09,000
So

4591
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:11,000
Now

4592
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:13,000
I did have a

4593
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:15,000
Question in my

4594
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:17,000
Right now

4595
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:19,000
It's kind of eluding me

4596
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:21,000
While I was trying to conduct

4597
02:44:21,000 --> 02:44:23,000
But

4598
02:44:23,000 --> 02:44:25,000
Now

4599
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:27,000
I know

4600
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:29,000
This is going to be really

4601
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:31,000
I'm making a

4602
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:33,000
Lousy radio

4603
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:35,000
Because I'm doing picture

4604
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:37,000
But I mean

4605
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:39,000
No secret that

4606
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:41,000
I've been having PC

4607
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:43,000
PC problems

4608
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:45,000
Yeah

4609
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:47,000
This is the kind of connector that

4610
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:49,000
My new fan

4611
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:51,000
Found on my computer

4612
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:53,000
It looks like there's a tiny little plug

4613
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:55,000
With three pins on it

4614
02:44:55,000 --> 02:44:57,000
And a big old honking

4615
02:44:57,000 --> 02:44:59,000
Four pins on it

4616
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:01,000
Let's see if I can

4617
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:03,000
Aim it on the inside of my computer

4618
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:05,000
I don't see many places

4619
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:07,000
Where I can plug

4620
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:09,000
This is totally

4621
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:11,000
This is totally a tech support call

4622
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:13,000
Going on right now

4623
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:15,000
Yeah I don't see anything

4624
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:17,000
Right where that fan

4625
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:19,000
Can plug in

4626
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:21,000
Do you?

4627
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:23,000
No because it's too fucking dark

4628
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:25,000
I can't see anything in that picture

4629
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:27,000
They plug in out of the power supply

4630
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:29,000
So if you have a modular power supply

4631
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:31,000
You may be able to do that

4632
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:33,000
Or the other thing you can do too

4633
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:35,000
Is you can buy just at a PC store

4634
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:37,000
Like a splitter

4635
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:39,000
So it will have a splitter that will be able to

4636
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:41,000
You plug it in and you can split it off

4637
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:43,000
To build

4638
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:45,000
You may not have

4639
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:47,000
See on yours

4640
02:45:47,000 --> 02:45:49,000
If you're using a modular supply with like

4641
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:51,000
SATA drives

4642
02:45:51,000 --> 02:45:53,000
You may not have the old molex connectors

4643
02:45:53,000 --> 02:45:55,000
Because they don't use those anymore

4644
02:45:55,000 --> 02:45:57,000
For the SATA drives

4645
02:45:57,000 --> 02:45:59,000
I would check if you still have

4646
02:45:59,000 --> 02:46:01,000
If it is a modular

4647
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:03,000
Power supply

4648
02:46:03,000 --> 02:46:05,000
You may have some cables

4649
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:07,000
For those molex connectors

4650
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:09,000
They should have something or at the very least

4651
02:46:09,000 --> 02:46:11,000
There's

4652
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:13,000
Something you can

4653
02:46:13,000 --> 02:46:15,000
Possibly buy to split it

4654
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:17,000
Or if you really want to you can cut it

4655
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:19,000
And splice it in there

4656
02:46:19,000 --> 02:46:21,000
Hey look you're getting offers from our chat

4657
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:23,000
Rama says if you send the photos

4658
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:25,000
He'll link you to everything you need

4659
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:27,000
Chatters helping chatters

4660
02:46:27,000 --> 02:46:29,000
I love it

4661
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:31,000
Now to try to bring this

4662
02:46:31,000 --> 02:46:33,000
Call back to actual gaming

4663
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:35,000
Not tech support

4664
02:46:35,000 --> 02:46:37,000
Now

4665
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:39,000
Now

4666
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:41,000
One thing

4667
02:46:41,000 --> 02:46:43,000
You may have been noticing

4668
02:46:43,000 --> 02:46:45,000
Is that

4669
02:46:45,000 --> 02:46:47,000
Is the way I've been talking more and more

4670
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:49,000
About

4671
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:51,000
GLG.com and probably

4672
02:46:51,000 --> 02:46:53,000
A little bit less about Steam

4673
02:46:53,000 --> 02:46:55,000
Not to have anything

4674
02:46:55,000 --> 02:46:57,000
Against Steam you know I love

4675
02:46:57,000 --> 02:46:59,000
A lot of you got me started on

4676
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:01,000
Steam

4677
02:47:01,000 --> 02:47:03,000
Is there any

4678
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:05,000
On games on

4679
02:47:05,000 --> 02:47:07,000
GOG that may not

4680
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:09,000
Necessarily be on Steam

4681
02:47:09,000 --> 02:47:11,000
That you would recommend

4682
02:47:11,000 --> 02:47:13,000
That you know either I

4683
02:47:13,000 --> 02:47:15,000
Or

4684
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:17,000
Listeners in general may be

4685
02:47:17,000 --> 02:47:19,000
Overlooking

4686
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:49,000
Good old Civilization game

4687
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:51,000
Especially the original if not some of the sequels

4688
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:53,000
I really wish those would show up on

4689
02:47:53,000 --> 02:47:55,000
Good old games

4690
02:47:55,000 --> 02:47:57,000
I know Colonization showed up

4691
02:47:57,000 --> 02:47:59,000
Which is pretty good

4692
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:01,000
I haven't played that one through GOG myself

4693
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:03,000
But that is

4694
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:05,000
I think they have not only

4695
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:07,000
The actual original

4696
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:09,000
Colonization game from the late 90's

4697
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:11,000
But I think they have the reimagining

4698
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:13,000
They did around Civ IV

4699
02:48:13,000 --> 02:48:15,000
Because Civ IV they did like a

4700
02:48:15,000 --> 02:48:17,000
Colonization but yeah

4701
02:48:17,000 --> 02:48:19,000
Anything with Sid Meier's name in the title I'd recommend

4702
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:21,000
I think Alpha Centauri is on Good old games too

4703
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:23,000
Yeah I'm not

4704
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:25,000
Actually I'm not

4705
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:27,000
Too terribly positive

4706
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:29,000
But I'm

4707
02:48:29,000 --> 02:48:31,000
Just like

4708
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:33,000
64 chance

4709
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:35,000
In favor of at least

4710
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:37,000
Civ III be on

4711
02:48:37,000 --> 02:48:39,000
GOG

4712
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:41,000
You know I'm

4713
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:43,000
Reasonably sure that

4714
02:48:43,000 --> 02:48:45,000
They did have a

4715
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:47,000
Promotion where

4716
02:48:47,000 --> 02:48:49,000
Now you can

4717
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:51,000
Buy it

4718
02:48:51,000 --> 02:48:53,000
Add it

4719
02:48:53,000 --> 02:48:55,000
On the

4720
02:48:55,000 --> 02:48:57,000
Front page

4721
02:48:57,000 --> 02:48:59,000
Yeah

4722
02:48:59,000 --> 02:49:01,000
I'm noticing too some other recommendations

4723
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:03,000
From chat where Dungeon Buster says the gold

4724
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:05,000
Box series from SSI on GOG

4725
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:07,000
Is good but is really hardcore

4726
02:49:07,000 --> 02:49:09,000
CRPG's

4727
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:11,000
There you go

4728
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:13,000
I think again the old

4729
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:15,000
Oh Castles

4730
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:17,000
Is another old game I bought on there because I used to play that game on PC

4731
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:19,000
Like a long time ago I think it was actually Castles 2

4732
02:49:19,000 --> 02:49:21,000
But yeah

4733
02:49:21,000 --> 02:49:23,000
Dip in the archive of old

4734
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:25,000
Shit from the 90's you're gonna find a gold mine

4735
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:27,000
Alright

4736
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:29,000
Well I'm sure

4737
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:31,000
I'm taking up way too much of your time

4738
02:49:31,000 --> 02:49:33,000
There's probably some other people

4739
02:49:33,000 --> 02:49:35,000
That want to call but

4740
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:37,000
Have a nice day and thanks for all the years

4741
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:39,000
That you've been doing the show

4742
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:41,000
Definitely been making my Sunday nights

4743
02:49:41,000 --> 02:49:43,000
You are most welcome

4744
02:49:43,000 --> 02:49:45,000
My friend appreciate the call

4745
02:49:45,000 --> 02:49:47,000
In and good luck with Rama

4746
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:49,000
Solving the tech support issue which now Rama is offering

4747
02:49:49,000 --> 02:49:51,000
To do a live tech support show

4748
02:49:51,000 --> 02:49:53,000
Here at VoG I think it would be great

4749
02:49:53,000 --> 02:49:55,000
I'd love it so alright take care my friend

4750
02:49:55,000 --> 02:49:57,000
Alright have a good one bye

4751
02:49:57,000 --> 02:49:59,000
Actually you know if there's not enough calls for tech

4752
02:49:59,000 --> 02:50:01,000
Support oops if I don't mute it then you guys

4753
02:50:01,000 --> 02:50:03,000
Hear all the Skype noises sorry

4754
02:50:03,000 --> 02:50:05,000
What you're using Skype this is totally

4755
02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:07,000
Unprofessional man

4756
02:50:07,000 --> 02:50:09,000
I don't listen to this show anymore

4757
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:11,000
So yeah I mean you guys

4758
02:50:11,000 --> 02:50:13,000
If they were to do a show like that I think it would be

4759
02:50:13,000 --> 02:50:15,000
Hilarious even if they didn't just do tech support

4760
02:50:15,000 --> 02:50:17,000
Cause you know there's probably not gonna be enough people

4761
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:19,000
Listening really in all realness

4762
02:50:19,000 --> 02:50:21,000
To fix all the tech problems but

4763
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:23,000
They could do you know tech advice

4764
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:25,000
And tech help and

4765
02:50:25,000 --> 02:50:27,000
Life hacks if you will

4766
02:50:27,000 --> 02:50:29,000
Or computer hacks I don't know anyway

4767
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:31,000
So I don't think we're gonna

4768
02:50:31,000 --> 02:50:33,000
Get any other calls so I think I'm gonna go ahead and shut off

4769
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:35,000
The Skype line for now which I guess to do that

4770
02:50:35,000 --> 02:50:37,000
I would just swipe up there it is

4771
02:50:37,000 --> 02:50:39,000
Skype is done alright

4772
02:50:39,000 --> 02:50:41,000
So that's gonna do it for the Skype line tonight

4773
02:50:41,000 --> 02:50:43,000
Thanks for those that called in I'm very sorry

4774
02:50:43,000 --> 02:50:45,000
If you didn't get through especially if it was because of all the

4775
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:47,000
Technical failures we were having early on

4776
02:50:47,000 --> 02:50:49,000
But you live you learn that'll be

4777
02:50:49,000 --> 02:50:51,000
The theme of 700 more episodes

4778
02:50:51,000 --> 02:50:53,000
Hopefully of Orange Lounge

4779
02:50:53,000 --> 02:50:55,000
Radio I don't think we had

4780
02:50:55,000 --> 02:50:57,000
Any other last minute stories right Loki?

4781
02:50:57,000 --> 02:50:59,000
So I think it's about time for us to wrap up hey

4782
02:50:59,000 --> 02:51:01,000
I wanna thank you guys for listening

4783
02:51:01,000 --> 02:51:03,000
To Orange Lounge Radio over these years

4784
02:51:03,000 --> 02:51:05,000
Thank you again so much for

4785
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:07,000
Everything over these last 700 episodes

4786
02:51:07,000 --> 02:51:09,000
And we're gonna keep going right on going with

4787
02:51:09,000 --> 02:51:11,000
Episode 701 next week

4788
02:51:11,000 --> 02:51:13,000
Cause who needs a life?

4789
02:51:13,000 --> 02:51:15,000
And Dark Sakura is missing

4790
02:51:15,000 --> 02:51:17,000
People smacking each other with leather

4791
02:51:17,000 --> 02:51:19,000
To be here next

4792
02:51:19,000 --> 02:51:21,000
Week so y'all better respect that so

4793
02:51:21,000 --> 02:51:23,000
Anyway

4794
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:25,000
Thank you for listening to Orange Lounge Radio

4795
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:27,000
If you enjoyed what you heard here at the show

4796
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:29,000
Please consider telling a friend or five

4797
02:51:29,000 --> 02:51:31,000
About the show help us spread the word

4798
02:51:31,000 --> 02:51:33,000
Because we are the show where every gamer has a voice

4799
02:51:33,000 --> 02:51:35,000
But only if the voices are here

4800
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:37,000
To be participating with the show

4801
02:51:37,000 --> 02:51:39,000
A nice five star review on a place like iTunes

4802
02:51:39,000 --> 02:51:41,000
Or Google Play or wherever you found this show

4803
02:51:41,000 --> 02:51:43,000
Those all go a long long way

4804
02:51:43,000 --> 02:51:45,000
As well

4805
02:51:45,000 --> 02:51:47,000
I wanna say this that if you want to honor

4806
02:51:47,000 --> 02:51:49,000
Our episode 700

4807
02:51:49,000 --> 02:51:51,000
Then everyone take at least

4808
02:51:51,000 --> 02:51:53,000
Seven dollars

4809
02:51:53,000 --> 02:51:55,000
And donate it to your local LGBTQ

4810
02:51:55,000 --> 02:51:57,000
Center

4811
02:51:57,000 --> 02:51:59,000
Do that for us

4812
02:51:59,000 --> 02:52:01,000
Hey I like that idea

4813
02:52:01,000 --> 02:52:03,000
Or buy me booze

4814
02:52:03,000 --> 02:52:05,000
No I'm just kidding

4815
02:52:05,000 --> 02:52:07,000
Dark Sakura's got a way better suggestion

4816
02:52:07,000 --> 02:52:09,000
I'm just gonna give you booze

4817
02:52:09,000 --> 02:52:11,000
Dungeon Buster in chat says thank you for spending your gaming

4818
02:52:11,000 --> 02:52:13,000
Passion and time with us

4819
02:52:13,000 --> 02:52:15,000
Thank you, you're welcome

4820
02:52:15,000 --> 02:52:17,000
Alright let's go right into everybody's final

4821
02:52:17,000 --> 02:52:19,000
Thoughts for tonight and then we'll bring it back

4822
02:52:19,000 --> 02:52:21,000
With episode 701 next week

4823
02:52:21,000 --> 02:52:23,000
I guess I'll go first and my final thought is

4824
02:52:23,000 --> 02:52:25,000
I really need to hang these lights up already

4825
02:52:25,000 --> 02:52:27,000
The Dark Sakura bought me like two months ago

4826
02:52:27,000 --> 02:52:29,000
But I'm really lazy y'all

4827
02:52:29,000 --> 02:52:31,000
I need a complete

4828
02:52:31,000 --> 02:52:33,000
Actually this whole studio needs to be redecorated

4829
02:52:33,000 --> 02:52:35,000
Because seriously we got posters up

4830
02:52:35,000 --> 02:52:37,000
You never did put up the thing that the poster I gave you either

4831
02:52:37,000 --> 02:52:39,000
The scroll

4832
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:41,000
The Mega Man scroll

4833
02:52:41,000 --> 02:52:43,000
Oh yeah I haven't hung anything new up in here

4834
02:52:43,000 --> 02:52:45,000
I've still got a poster for Final Fantasy 11

4835
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:47,000
Online

4836
02:52:47,000 --> 02:52:49,000
What is that? That's a poster for Pop and Music 11

4837
02:52:49,000 --> 02:52:51,000
On the Playstation 2

4838
02:52:51,000 --> 02:52:53,000
But it's autographed

4839
02:52:53,000 --> 02:52:55,000
No it just looks like it is

4840
02:52:55,000 --> 02:52:57,000
I think it's autographed

4841
02:52:57,000 --> 02:52:59,000
The Borderlands one is autographed

4842
02:52:59,000 --> 02:53:01,000
This is Cody got us this Borderlands one

4843
02:53:01,000 --> 02:53:03,000
He met all that team locally

4844
02:53:03,000 --> 02:53:05,000
Anyway let's get around

4845
02:53:05,000 --> 02:53:07,000
And get final thoughts from everybody else

4846
02:53:07,000 --> 02:53:09,000
That was mine so Loki your final thought

4847
02:53:09,000 --> 02:53:11,000
I guess I'm building

4848
02:53:11,000 --> 02:53:13,000
Or playing the Lego thing tonight

4849
02:53:13,000 --> 02:53:15,000
Yay Lego thing tonight

4850
02:53:15,000 --> 02:53:17,000
And lastly

4851
02:53:17,000 --> 02:53:19,000
But not leastly Dark Sakura

4852
02:53:19,000 --> 02:53:21,000
I don't know

4853
02:53:21,000 --> 02:53:23,000
I don't know

4854
02:53:23,000 --> 02:53:25,000
What a perfect note to end on

4855
02:53:25,000 --> 02:53:27,000
We'll see you next time with

4856
02:53:27,000 --> 02:53:29,000
