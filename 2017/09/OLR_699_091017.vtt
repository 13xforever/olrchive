Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:21.000
Tonight, prepare your brains for a huge retcon, one that takes Mario down a notch or two, allowing him to only be able to rely on the skills of his entire gaming history.

00:21.000 --> 00:27.000
Stay tuned for this and the rest of the week's gaming news, hopefully not all as shocking, starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.000 --> 00:45.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight on September the 10th of 2017, episode number 699 of our show.

00:45.000 --> 00:56.000
Here to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with all of you guys out there on the entire internet, all of it, and my co-host here in studio, DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers up first.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
Sup?

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
Hi, how are you?

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
I'm full now.

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
You're full? Full of garbage? I'm just kidding.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
No, you ate my food and it was delicious.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
Yes, yes. DarkSakura cooked a chicken or something. What was-

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
Well, Dan, I made Dan grill it, but I marinated it.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
Oh, you worked together!

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
I made a marinade.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
Aww, it was like a very husband-wife thing to do, cook together.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
Yeah.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Aww.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
Did you enjoy the week off? How was your labor day?

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
Laborious?

01:22.000 --> 01:28.000
No, I was out in 105 degree weather watching Peppermint perform.

01:28.000 --> 01:36.000
Yeah, yes, I missed all that. Well, I mean, the rainbow festival and all that that you were doing sounds like it was awesome, but the heat wave? No thanks.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
I went home pretty sick.

01:37.000 --> 01:45.000
I think it says something pretty strongly that Atlanta was having perfect weather. The humidity wasn't even that bad, or I'm just used to it now after five years of Dragon Con.

01:45.000 --> 01:53.000
The humidity wasn't even that bad. When I was reading all the stuff back home about 115 degrees here in Sacramento, I was like, nope. No thanks.

01:53.000 --> 02:06.000
I went out to work the rainbow festival, and it was nice doing something good for the community, but there were fewer vendors than there were last year. Last year was actually my first year going.

02:06.000 --> 02:24.000
But I have to say, though, Taryn Through You was, of course, the hostess, local queen, who was always amazing to watch. And Mercury Rising performed, who's another local queen, who is also just a really nice person.

02:24.000 --> 02:30.000
And then finally Peppermint came on stage and sang.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
Oh nice.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
Like legit sang, didn't lip sync.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
Okay.

02:34.000 --> 02:47.000
And it was a really good performance, but by the time I was done with it, I was way too hot. And so I couldn't get like cool until I got home under the cold tap.

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
So it was really bad. I got a little hot heat sick.

02:51.000 --> 02:57.000
Yeah, the heat was no joke. I would not have wanted to been out in it if I was here. So I'm kind of really glad I missed it for that reason.

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
Yeah. Well, I also missed him. Say hello to Techmaster Loki. How are you doing?

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
I'm doing fine.

03:02.000 --> 03:09.000
And happy birthday early. Tomorrow is Loki's birthday, for those that are unaware. What, 36?

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
37.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
37?

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
In a row?

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
Oh, there we go. It's this year. Yay. In a row? Thank you, DarkSaga.

03:16.000 --> 03:25.000
Well, happy early birthday to you. And I noticed that the misses kind of went in on a gift for you with you. Obviously, it's your money too.

03:25.000 --> 03:31.000
Yeah. I mean, not to play it down or anything, we were shopping for a car. Anyways, it just happened that we found on this weekend.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
Sure. So you got a new car.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
Yeah, I got a brand new car.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
Nice.

03:36.000 --> 03:41.000
So I had a 2008 fit and I traded in for a 2017 fit.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
There you go.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
And now it's not red, it's white.

03:44.000 --> 03:51.000
Okay. And the next one can be blue because America. Exactly. Even though it's a Japanese car. But I have something. I was going with some sort of-

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
I was going with Mexico, I think.

03:53.000 --> 03:59.000
I was going with some sort of reference there. Great. Well, happy early birthday and glad to hear you got the new car.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
We'll check in with everyone's gaming weeks in just a little bit and get into our kickoff topic.

04:03.000 --> 04:12.000
But first, I want to say hello to our chatters over at live.vognetwork.com because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
Six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

04:16.000 --> 04:27.000
And some folks in chat tonight commenting that the quality of the show seems different, which is weird because I did not make any changes except I uninstalled and reinstalled Skype to get that to work.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
Well, I also have a new microphone.

04:29.000 --> 04:34.000
That's right. Loki does have a new microphone. So that might be worth mentioning because some of you guys were mentioning a couple weeks ago.

04:34.000 --> 04:39.000
I think we found there was a short in the cable or something like that. So Loki may sound different. I would expect that.

04:39.000 --> 04:43.000
But I wouldn't expect the entire quality of the show to be different. That's the weird-

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
God, no. Lower those expectations.

04:46.000 --> 04:53.000
Well, we'll see. Hopefully the podcast sounds the same. Maybe it just has something to do with the live broadcasting or something. Who knows?

04:53.000 --> 04:57.000
I don't know. Maybe it sounds better. I don't know. Anyway.

04:57.000 --> 05:10.000
Hey, if you are discovering Orange Launch Radio because of Dragon Con and the podcast track of the Dragon Con event, I just want to say hi and welcome because the podcast track was awesome in having me on several panels this year.

05:10.000 --> 05:18.000
And I got to do a lot of networking. I had a great time at Dragon Con. This was my fifth year there. And I almost feel like this is the best one yet in many ways.

05:18.000 --> 05:25.000
And a lot of great motivation coming from Dragon Con and the podcast track. I really want to thank Brian Dunaway from Film Sack.

05:25.000 --> 05:31.000
And I want to thank Charles McFall from Pokemon Go Podcast and everyone really involved in the podcast track.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
Because I don't remember all the names and podcasts off the top of my head.

05:34.000 --> 05:43.000
But I want to thank everybody for having me as a guest this year and letting me participate in panels because I'm sure it was very motivating for other people, but it was also very motivating for myself.

05:43.000 --> 05:50.000
And yeah, I just had a great time. So welcome to our little show if it's your first time listening and you found out about it over at Dragon Con.

05:50.000 --> 05:58.000
I'll give you the elevator pitch on Orange Launch Radio real quick. We're on episode 699 tonight. So we've been going for 15 years.

05:59.000 --> 06:05.000
15 years ago, myself, Loki, and DarkSakura, we all met playing a little video game called Dance Dance Revolution.

06:05.000 --> 06:10.000
Yes, where the arrows scroll up the screen and cheesy techno dance music plays all the time. But we loved it.

06:10.000 --> 06:17.000
And there was a whole community around that game and all the music games that Konami was putting out around that time in a series known as Bamani Beat Mania.

06:17.000 --> 06:26.000
So we all got together being fans of that. And we started this little show for that community to monitor the tournaments, to monitor the new releases of these games.

06:26.000 --> 06:32.000
Because, you know, there were six or seven games in the series that were all getting new updates. So we were about music games in the beginning.

06:32.000 --> 06:43.000
But as the Mamani series kind of started to slow down, we had a little lull before Guitar Hero 2 really took off and I think changed the industry kind of back into music games with that and rock band.

06:43.000 --> 06:53.000
We kind of shifted to, it was right around the time podcasting got bigger. So we kind of shifted to a show that's now podcast about all video games.

06:53.000 --> 07:00.000
Because it turns out there's more games we like than just DDR. Right, Dark Sakura? There were other games that you played back then besides just DDR.

07:00.000 --> 07:07.000
Like you would use your dance mat to play Soul Calibur, right? I'm just kidding. I feel like you tried that at one point.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
I did.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
Yes, I knew it.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
But I beat the game with Rod Calibur.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Nice. Okay. See, there you go. There you go.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
It works best with Siegfried.

07:16.000 --> 07:30.000
I remember you were the first one that ever introduced me to, well actually, when I was first getting into DDR, I mean, I always knew that obviously I knew gaming in Japan was a scene and that they had games that we did it and all that.

07:30.000 --> 07:44.000
But it was really because of DDR and meeting people like Dark Sakura that like my eyes really got opened up to how like, oh, what do you mean it's called Bust a Move in Japan and all the songs are different and most of them are actually better.

07:44.000 --> 07:52.000
And what do you mean that there's this whole Castlevania game that I never got to play here in the US and all this other stuff like my eyes really got opened all that.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
So, you know, now here we are 15 years later.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
Welcome to the world of imports.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
Yeah. Right. Right. That was what it is. You taught me how to mod my first PlayStation.

07:59.000 --> 08:04.000
Actually, it wasn't. You didn't really have to teach me much. You were like, here, I have like

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
Here's a paperclip.

08:05.000 --> 08:11.000
No, here is this plug because I have 5000 extras. You put this plug in the back of your PlayStation. Have fun.

08:11.000 --> 08:16.000
Yeah. Yours was the one that you use like the five point switch for.

08:16.000 --> 08:21.000
But it still had the I.O. port in the back, which meant all you have to do is just use the plug.

08:21.000 --> 08:29.000
Yes. We still have a first gen PlayStation that takes like you use a paperclip.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
Yeah. Or a really stiff twist tie.

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
Just hold the button in and then switch your desks.

08:35.000 --> 08:40.000
So, yeah. So we all learn from each other about this great gaming culture.

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
And we invite all you to do it every week because, you know, we used to play DDR.

08:44.000 --> 08:49.000
And after we were done playing DDR, we'd all go to the food place out front of Roseville Golf Land.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
And we'd sit there and have dinner and talk a little smack about our favorite hobbies.

08:52.000 --> 08:56.000
So that's kind of this is the world's biggest diner table is how I envision it.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
And we're just here to talk a little smack about gaming news.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
I don't think we're going to break gaming news here.

09:01.000 --> 09:05.000
I think there's plenty of blogs and Twitter and all that stuff that's going to break the news.

09:05.000 --> 09:10.000
But we're going to we're going to discuss it and try to learn, you know, from each other's perspectives about it.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
So there you go. That's Orange Launch Radio in a nutshell for those that are new.

09:13.000 --> 09:17.000
I probably should have saved that spiel for next week, being that it's 700 next week.

09:17.000 --> 09:21.000
But I can always just refer back. Go listen to last week's episode.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
Talk more about what Orange Launch Radio is.

09:23.000 --> 09:30.000
All right. Anyway, SSU100 Matt in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says you're just missing the mozzarella sticks.

09:30.000 --> 09:35.000
And let me tell you, the mozzarella sticks at this place is it's I think it's a local chain called Brookfield's.

09:35.000 --> 09:39.000
The mozzarella sticks, they're bomb. They're really good. Like some of the best.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
So anyway, just saying, just saying. All right.

09:42.000 --> 09:50.000
Let's get into our kickoff topic tonight, which actually for our kickoff topic tonight, we want to talk about some of the news that we missed while we were out.

09:50.000 --> 09:55.000
So I picked three big headlines from last week leading into Labor Day that I thought we could talk about here at the top of the show.

09:55.000 --> 10:04.000
First off, Nintendo announced last week, well, I don't think they really I guess they did announce it, but it was kind of obviously they don't want to make a big deal of it.

10:04.000 --> 10:13.000
But they did mention that as of November 8th, Nintendo TV, Wii U chat and Miiverse will be discontinued.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
Those services on the Wii U are no longer.

10:16.000 --> 10:25.000
So effectively, the Wii U is being taken out back and shot on November 8th at three o'clock in the afternoon Japan time.

10:25.000 --> 10:31.000
The official Miiverse site, including what you see on the Wii U and the 3DS even, are not going to be there.

10:31.000 --> 10:35.000
However, Super Mario Maker, it says that will still be working.

10:35.000 --> 10:43.000
Details to be announced later, but my assumption is they're going to do a patch that routes things a little differently and kind of removes that Miiverse element.

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
But everything else that associates with Miiverse is going to be closed.

10:47.000 --> 10:52.000
There will be error codes when you try to access Miiverse, but it is gone.

10:52.000 --> 10:59.000
TV, on the other hand, that was, you may not be aware, that already went away in North America.

10:59.000 --> 11:03.000
TV is going to be leaving in Japan as well, where I think it's still been going.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
But obviously Miiverse is kind of the big thing out of that.

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
So folks here in studio, folks in chat, what do you think?

11:10.000 --> 11:15.000
Are you surprised to hear that Miiverse is sending hiccups this fast?

11:15.000 --> 11:25.000
Or is it one of those things where you're like, not really surprised that Nintendo is quickly pulling the plug on a console that is just done, pretty much?

11:25.000 --> 11:30.000
It's just kind of weird that they developed something like this and then didn't carry it over to the Switch.

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
And they have nothing to replace it.

11:33.000 --> 11:41.000
Well, I mean, as far as nothing to replace it, what's interesting about the Switch is that it feels like it's built in to just games natively on the Switch.

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
Like Splatoon 2 kind of worked around it.

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
Like Splatoon 2 has this very Miiverse-esque thing in it.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
Yeah, but it's all separate.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
It is separate.

11:49.000 --> 11:56.000
Miiverse was all kind of one community and now you're splitting everybody off in their own communities, which is kind of dumb.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
But, was it a community worth saving?

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
Like, here's just real talk.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
I mean, there was a lot I did like about Miiverse.

12:05.000 --> 12:09.000
There was, I kind of feel like Nintendo kind of unlocked something a little bit charming with Miiverse.

12:09.000 --> 12:16.000
But, it was kind of slow and clunky, not really fun to browse on the Wii U sometimes.

12:16.000 --> 12:20.000
You know, just kind of had that Nintendo clunk to it when it comes to online.

12:20.000 --> 12:27.000
So, it wasn't something where I was like, oh, I got to wake up and check Miiverse the same way I check Twitter or Facebook.

12:27.000 --> 12:33.000
Like, it didn't really snap the same way, so it didn't encourage me to check Miiverse as often.

12:33.000 --> 12:38.000
But, I mean, then why even carry it forward then in Splatoon 2 then?

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
Why even bother doing something like that if they're like, oh, this is terrible?

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
Because I think, well, okay, that's great.

12:43.000 --> 12:47.000
Oh, it's terrible, but it's not terrible, but it's still terrible.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
That's a good question, but maybe it's something that that team wanted to keep going.

12:50.000 --> 12:57.000
Because I will admit, seeing some of the trends in the pictures and stuff that you get on Splatoon 2 have been kind of charming.

12:57.000 --> 13:01.000
Like, there was the whole trend with all the furry stuff going on.

13:01.000 --> 13:06.000
And then there was all the pro-trans stuff, which I thought was awesome that you were seeing a lot of that in the game.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
And that was kind of, you know, there was about a week of that.

13:08.000 --> 13:13.000
And then people were talking about the whole, I wish blank was real.

13:13.000 --> 13:19.000
You know, like, it feels like Splatoon 2 is kind of like this meme play field for all these things.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
Although, you know, we're talking about rights and stuff, that's not really a meme.

13:22.000 --> 13:28.000
But you know what I mean, like, there's definitely like that topic of the week, be it a serious thing or a meme, that feels like it's going on in Splatoon 2.

13:28.000 --> 13:32.000
And it's a fascinating thing to watch in that community, in my opinion. I don't know.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
But you're right, it's me versus nothing.

13:34.000 --> 13:38.000
But those are the same terrible people that were on Miiverse that are now in Splatoon 2, so.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
But what's it-

13:39.000 --> 13:43.000
It's just like, they want it both ways.

13:43.000 --> 13:49.000
Well, but what's interesting about that is because of the way it's designed in Splatoon 2, the terrible stuff doesn't get elevated.

13:49.000 --> 13:56.000
Because you can only like things, and the things with the most likes tend to get elevated. You can't dislike things.

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
You couldn't dislike things in Miiverse either.

14:00.000 --> 14:07.000
I'm trying to think. No, you couldn't. But I think Splatoon, to be fair, I don't think anything's changed in that regard since Splatoon 1.

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
Splatoon 1 had all its memes that made it, you know, what it was too.

14:10.000 --> 14:16.000
Alright, whatever. It's different. It's still the same. Whatever. It's terrible. Let's put it back in there.

14:16.000 --> 14:20.000
Except don't lean on this game and separate everybody out.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
Because this is what we think the consumer wants.

14:23.000 --> 14:28.000
JD in chat says, you can also report things that are super bad. That's true.

14:28.000 --> 14:32.000
JD also points out, my Nintendo account still gives bonuses for logging into Miiverse.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
Well, I imagine that's going to be changing relatively soon.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
I wonder what it's going to do to me, Tomo.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
That's a- Ooh, that's a great-

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
Because there was just an update.

14:40.000 --> 14:44.000
That's a very good question. But does Mi- Tomo isn't really powered by Miiverse.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
Mi Tomo's a separate thing.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
Does anybody still play that?

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
Yeah, Jamie does.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
Okay, aside from Jamie.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
Tons of people.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
There's dozens of them.

14:52.000 --> 14:57.000
Not as many as in the first week, but I know, like my buddy Jonko says, was trying to get me to check in on it.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
So there's, there's other people that check in on it.

15:00.000 --> 15:08.000
Well, um, at any rate, they just put out an update to go with the, um, I think some of the other Mi options for-

15:08.000 --> 15:12.000
I'll have to look at the, the update history. There was an update just a week ago.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
So.

15:14.000 --> 15:18.000
Uh, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, more people play Mi Tomo than Pokemon Go.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
That's probably not true.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
I can't argue with that logic.

15:21.000 --> 15:25.000
But, but I would bet more people play Mi Tomo than Ingress. That I would bet.

15:25.000 --> 15:29.000
So, you know, you can't say that it's totally an itch thing.

15:29.000 --> 15:33.000
Uh, anyway, let's see. Um, what was the other thing I wanted to say?

15:33.000 --> 15:38.000
Oh, Kaizhudo in chat says, my Mi verse wasn't slow and clunky at all. Maybe your wi fi was janky.

15:38.000 --> 15:43.000
Well, it runs this show okay. So I don't know. It just, it just didn't-

15:43.000 --> 15:48.000
Like, you know how the internet just kind of snaps when you're on your phone, you bring up Facebook and snap, there's your feed.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
Like in Mi verse, it was like-

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
Blum, blum, blum, blum, blum, blum, blum, blum, blum, blum, blum, blum, bling.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
And then like you click into something else?

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
Blum, blum, blum, blum, blum, blum, blum, blum, blum, blum, blum, blum.

15:56.000 --> 16:01.240
It's an invisible hamster right on the wheel. You just don't see the little hamster in my Wii U that powers

16:01.240 --> 16:05.340
It doesn't have enough processing power to render the hamster. Like don't don't get me wrong

16:05.340 --> 16:11.400
I'm not trying to dog on Miiverse like there was some good stuff that came out of it, but it wasn't perfect

16:11.400 --> 16:14.920
You know and there's a lot of Nintendo's online ventures aren't but I mean

16:15.020 --> 16:21.180
But Nintendo did it Nintendo's way and it brought some new things to the table as a result. So I'm

16:22.420 --> 16:24.420
What?

16:24.740 --> 16:27.260
For me it's it's like Nintendo

16:28.580 --> 16:30.900
Throwing darts at a dartboard, you know

16:30.900 --> 16:36.460
They have all these things that are gonna revolutionize something and it doesn't and it just doesn't do anything

16:36.460 --> 16:41.700
Or it's just not as like fantastic as they had talked it up to be like remember the whole

16:42.140 --> 16:47.000
Wasn't the whole face chat thing with the Wii U wasn't that supposed to be like a revolutionary thing?

16:47.000 --> 16:51.920
No that fucking went nowhere because they didn't leave supported. Well you first was that a revolutionary thing

16:51.960 --> 16:56.560
Yeah for a short period of time and it went nowhere that way obviously nowhere enough to carry them

16:56.560 --> 17:00.120
You know it to the next platform. You know what I will give you that

17:00.120 --> 17:05.200
I do feel that Nintendo did kind of put out these features and then really did nothing to

17:06.120 --> 17:12.820
Elevate it I think would be the right word because for example, like you say the the video chat on Wii U was pretty rad

17:13.440 --> 17:16.000
Imagine if that could have been hooked in through 3ds somehow

17:16.000 --> 17:19.620
I mean there's a lot of stuff and this goes back like even further than that

17:19.620 --> 17:23.300
I mean if you talk about like the whole AR support with the 3ds

17:23.760 --> 17:28.300
Fucking did nothing with that and to be fair Sony did fucking nothing with that either with the Vita

17:28.300 --> 17:31.460
So right, I mean there's that it's not unique to Nintendo in that

17:32.180 --> 17:34.180
so it's just I

17:34.260 --> 17:37.820
Don't know like what's the newest thing that they're seeing is like revolutionary?

17:37.820 --> 17:41.340
Okay, the switch being able to take it places and play with people and stuff like that. Mm-hmm

17:41.340 --> 17:44.180
Okay, so how are they gonna fuck that up? I mean, I just got to figure it

17:44.180 --> 17:48.580
Well, but but Loki you're you're assuming that Nintendo fucks everything up and I would say no

17:48.580 --> 17:54.700
They don't because for example the the Wii itself was a gamble and the fact that you know the motion control

17:54.980 --> 17:56.980
But I mean we tennis

17:57.660 --> 18:00.580
Elevated that and sold the shit out of the yeah

18:00.580 --> 18:05.380
They got lucky and they're trying to recapture that magic and they're just not it's not happening

18:05.380 --> 18:07.380
that was that was a dart that connected and

18:07.900 --> 18:12.620
TV on the other hand was a dart that missed but I think Nintendo really I

18:12.980 --> 18:17.620
Think Nintendo missed out on trying to elevate the fact that you could participate in

18:18.100 --> 18:21.020
TV along with shows like American Idol

18:22.540 --> 18:28.380
Yeah, it was pretty cool and you could do it and like you would never know it because Nintendo was really bad at elevating that

18:28.540 --> 18:31.660
So I that that's my criticism of Nintendo

18:31.660 --> 18:35.900
We should do that now like have an app call it watch party and they have different things. Okay Game of Thrones

18:35.980 --> 18:38.020
We're doing Game of Thrones tonight or something like that

18:38.820 --> 18:39.860
Like

18:39.860 --> 18:44.940
Why isn't that a thing? That's such a low-hanging fruit idea. No, I'm with you. I'm with you. I don't know

18:44.940 --> 18:49.340
I am. All right. Anyway, let me look and see if there's any other comments in our chat room over at live

18:50.140 --> 18:52.140
Vogue network comm let's see

18:52.260 --> 18:56.380
Kaiju doing chat says Nintendo made the big mistake and forgot that most gamers over 12 years old or

18:56.700 --> 19:01.460
Antisocial and like to play alone and not communicate. They only communicate when they want to complain about something

19:02.700 --> 19:06.620
But now when I play with friends when I play with strangers, maybe but not when I play with friends

19:06.620 --> 19:07.940
I want to talk a lot when I play the friend

19:07.940 --> 19:09.740
I get it cuz I feel very

19:09.740 --> 19:13.980
Antisocial when I want to play on like is I really I would like to just play friends

19:13.980 --> 19:15.980
Mm-hmm. I don't really like playing with strangers

19:18.100 --> 19:21.540
I'll do it. Like the only time is like if I'm you know, like even

19:22.060 --> 19:23.680
Grand Theft Auto 4 was like a game

19:23.680 --> 19:29.260
I really play heavily in or call of duty or something that play strangers just wasn't as fun as playing with friends

19:29.980 --> 19:31.980
So I feel that

19:32.580 --> 19:39.060
Let's see, I don't remember where this came up from but dungeon buster says more games should bring back the sound test feature

19:39.460 --> 19:42.720
Why not? Yes. Yes, they should they should also have creepy

19:43.620 --> 19:49.820
Hidden messages Allah sonic CD. Yes, or they should have these sounds that you play them in the sound test

19:49.820 --> 19:53.500
You're like that wasn't in the fucking game. What is that? That's like a woman moaning. What is

19:54.500 --> 20:00.940
Test that was when we used to put the PlayStation disc and rip all of the sound files off of it

20:01.620 --> 20:06.980
How some of us found out that the demo disc for Jammer Lamy still had the health statement

20:07.820 --> 20:12.260
All right. Let's talk a little bit about moving on to Sonic Mania

20:12.820 --> 20:16.220
So obviously Sonic Mania was a huge game that came out a few weeks ago

20:16.220 --> 20:18.220
And in the last week when we weren't here

20:18.300 --> 20:22.200
They've released the PC version which a lot of people were looking forward to well

20:22.300 --> 20:28.340
Unfortunately, there was a little bit of a gotcha in the PC version that it was using a DRM system

20:28.340 --> 20:30.920
That's pretty controversial known as de nouveau

20:31.740 --> 20:39.100
Meaning that from what I understand usually this DRM kind of requires the game to always be online Allah Diablo 3

20:39.900 --> 20:44.080
Allah any MMO that's gonna be connected but Sonic Mania supposed to be a single-player experience

20:44.460 --> 20:51.320
So people were really not happy about that because you shouldn't have to be online to play a game like Sonic now to be fair

20:51.320 --> 20:53.580
Since the controversy from last week

20:53.580 --> 20:57.980
My understanding is that there has been an update the DRM is still being used

20:58.060 --> 21:02.920
But once you log in to activate it, you don't have to stay connected to steam anymore

21:02.920 --> 21:06.880
You can actually play it offline. That is the fix that went in place

21:07.620 --> 21:10.860
According to Sega on their face just don't put it in there in the first place

21:10.860 --> 21:14.460
How about that people really don't like their DRM on PC? That's for sure

21:14.460 --> 21:17.620
But I also I think it's also because that it's more of that

21:18.340 --> 21:24.860
That particular DRM like it basically it's almost like malware. It just it doesn't uninstall itself

21:25.340 --> 21:31.180
You know when you uninstall the game it's just it's a pain and they're even saying that with it enabled

21:31.980 --> 21:35.020
The performance of the game wasn't as good

21:37.100 --> 21:42.860
Alright so yeah, that's true when that's hogging up resources it can it can really clog up the game

21:42.860 --> 21:46.200
And yeah a pin and then on top of that. Here's the best part about it

21:46.340 --> 21:53.300
So because the game was delayed a week or something like that. Mm-hmm. They gave everybody on Steam, you know, hey, here's a copy of

21:53.660 --> 21:55.660
code for Sonic 1

21:56.700 --> 22:02.900
Well, guess what that actually con or that counted as the purchase date then on on

22:03.540 --> 22:09.840
This the game so then once the game finally did get released you had less time or no time to

22:10.300 --> 22:13.900
File a refund if you wanted to do that through Steam

22:15.540 --> 22:22.380
All right, yeah, and then also the other follow-up is that that whole DRM was cracked in eight days because of court

22:22.380 --> 22:27.180
You know what? They say hackers gonna hack, right? So they're only motivated when it's

22:27.980 --> 22:31.700
Yeah, so there you go. Anyway, that was a thing that happened now

22:31.700 --> 22:36.240
Let's move on to some positive news and I definitely wanted to mention this at some point towards the top of the show

22:36.240 --> 22:42.100
But obviously we have a lot of listeners out there that have been affected by these storms that have been going on around the country

22:42.740 --> 22:49.200
You know, obviously there's a lot of focus right now on Irma and what's happening with Florida and we have quite a few listeners in

22:49.240 --> 22:52.520
Florida area so of course, you know thinking about you guys, you know

22:52.520 --> 22:56.960
I'm talking to some of you on discord and on Twitter and I know everybody's doing what they need to do to stay safe

22:56.960 --> 23:01.340
So that's great. But still it's like just one of those like wow, this is really awful

23:01.340 --> 23:07.000
but I mean this is right on the heels of what happened in Houston and with with Harvey and

23:07.640 --> 23:13.720
Just seeing what happened there is is awful and you know believe it or not here in California in the 90s

23:13.720 --> 23:16.840
I lived in a neighborhood that flooded that was pretty bad

23:16.840 --> 23:17.720
and so, you know

23:17.720 --> 23:21.000
I kind of know what it's like and I'm not gonna say I know exactly what it's like

23:21.000 --> 23:25.680
I kind of know what it's like to go through something like that and it sucks like it really really sucks and it's scary

23:25.680 --> 23:27.480
and so

23:27.480 --> 23:34.640
But most importantly I just hope that everybody that listens to OLR is safe. That's the most important thing. Everything else is stuff

23:35.760 --> 23:39.960
Granted some of it is very sentimental stuff, but you know stuff at the end of the day

23:40.560 --> 23:46.240
It can be replaced you cannot so yeah, I hope everybody is safe and all that stuff

23:46.240 --> 23:51.960
so thinking about you guys and a lot of the gaming community coming together to do some good for support of

23:52.560 --> 23:54.920
victims and games done quick

23:55.520 --> 23:59.640
Which of course does though what awesome games done quick and they do

24:00.160 --> 24:04.200
Summer games don't quick is the other one. They really threw together a fast

24:04.920 --> 24:09.120
Marathon and they did it virtually which you know, of course you have to do if it's last-minute

24:09.120 --> 24:12.620
But they did a Harvey relief done quick and they raised

24:13.620 --> 24:19.060
$225,000 that's almost a quarter of a million dollars for the Houston food bank, which is really cool

24:19.060 --> 24:24.740
Houston food bank providing meals cleaning supplies disinfection product products for people that were

24:25.780 --> 24:31.020
Affected by Harvey's so really happy to hear about gamers doing that. I'm sad I wasn't able to catch any of it

24:31.460 --> 24:34.340
Obviously I was out of town this past weekend, but I heard it was a lot of fun

24:34.340 --> 24:38.380
So I didn't even know what's going on. Oh, no, because I would have watched it

24:38.380 --> 24:41.220
Well, I'm sure they archived it all and put it on Twitter and all that stuff

24:41.220 --> 24:45.740
And yeah, if you still want to donate I'm sure they would not be opposed to that. So check that out

24:46.500 --> 24:48.500
All right. So anyhow

24:49.580 --> 24:53.100
That was something else. I wanted to bring up at least some good news from the past week

24:53.100 --> 24:56.780
So that is that's what's been going on in gaming this past week

24:56.780 --> 24:58.940
We will get into this week's headlines

24:58.940 --> 25:04.780
But first I want to go around and check in with our hosts and talk a little bit about how was your gaming week?

25:04.780 --> 25:06.780
Dark soccer. How was your gaming week? Um

25:06.780 --> 25:08.300
Um

25:08.300 --> 25:15.620
What did I play I played some pinball I played Simpsons pinball party at a leather bar

25:17.100 --> 25:19.100
It was in bad shape

25:19.500 --> 25:21.500
I

25:23.340 --> 25:27.540
Actually back in Sims 4 I've been looking for houses by

25:29.740 --> 25:36.260
Good designers, but maybe not be super famous. Like I'm not doing Frank Lloyd Wright houses. I'm not doing falling water

25:36.820 --> 25:38.820
but I'm looking for

25:39.420 --> 25:46.860
Contemporary designers like 50s and up and trying to recreate their houses in the Sims and then trap the people inside the walls of said

25:46.860 --> 25:52.900
Houses know those people live on like a 20 by 20 lot in a square room that has no toilet. I

25:53.940 --> 25:57.820
Want to see and I'm sure it's been done because it's the internet. Of course

25:57.820 --> 26:04.420
I want to see someone recreate like the saw houses or saw like facilities and put the Sims in there

26:04.420 --> 26:10.140
I'm sure there's some mods or something. I'm sure somebody somewhere has done it or the Winchester Mystery House

26:10.140 --> 26:13.420
I'm sure has been done. Yeah, someone's done that if Jamie hasn't done it herself

26:13.420 --> 26:19.140
I don't have time for that, but someone else did it for Sims 3 and I had it downloaded for a while

26:19.140 --> 26:24.100
I love the Winchester Mystery House though. I've never been do you know that you're fixing this Rob?

26:24.780 --> 26:30.580
Underwhelming you think no, it's just it's not tall people friendly cuz miss Winchester was four foot nine

26:30.980 --> 26:36.340
For those that don't know it's it's like a two it's one of those tourist attractions in Northern California. It's in San Jose

26:36.340 --> 26:42.220
It's like the nutshell. Yeah, mrs. Winchester is the wife of the Winchester gun bang bang

26:42.220 --> 26:48.060
Yep, and she thought that she was being haunted by all the ghosts of the people killed by her husband's guns

26:48.500 --> 26:55.500
Hired a psychic who said the only way to prevent them from killing you is to never stop construction on the house

26:55.540 --> 26:57.600
When construction stops you die

26:58.600 --> 27:01.320
Ironically which sounds like a trap and saw

27:02.320 --> 27:09.880
But anyway, but there's there's a seance room that has a door that leads to nothing to the outside from the third story

27:10.400 --> 27:13.880
There are stairs that go up to the ceiling and go nowhere

27:14.560 --> 27:20.420
There's all kinds of weird ghost traps in there and all the stairs because she was very arthritic very old and four foot nine

27:20.420 --> 27:26.860
So there's a little teeny like two inch stairs all the way through the house and then her collection of Tiffany lamps

27:28.040 --> 27:29.120
so

27:29.120 --> 27:31.120
There you go. There's your

27:31.160 --> 27:33.800
architectural and crazy person history of the day and

27:35.360 --> 27:38.560
You and sorry we were talking about the Sims though before we got

27:39.160 --> 27:44.840
But someone took the time to do the full version of the Winchester mystery house

27:44.840 --> 27:48.420
The what was it seven stories before the earthquake in?

27:49.080 --> 27:54.520
1915 uh-huh wasn't that when that earthquake was with the big San Francisco one. Yeah, six six

27:55.000 --> 27:59.320
But yeah before that it had someone like seven or eight stories and now it's like at four yeah

27:59.960 --> 28:05.300
So they didn't rebuild all those and I've never been and they've also uncovered now other parts of the house

28:05.680 --> 28:11.160
And so I was watching this one person has like different revisions

28:11.480 --> 28:16.360
Based on different versions of the house, and then I I forgot and it's so weird too

28:16.360 --> 28:19.960
Cuz you think it would be like out in the middle of nowhere. It's right next to a movie theater

28:19.960 --> 28:25.360
It's like it is how well I mean movie theater the build-up around there the movie theater wasn't there when she built

28:26.760 --> 28:31.920
But it's just so weird to see like you kind of think spooky house on a hill or something like that. No

28:33.400 --> 28:38.840
Middle of downtown San Jose practically. Yeah, it's funny when because I went with with Kristen and

28:40.040 --> 28:41.720
we did like the

28:41.720 --> 28:47.320
The the full tour that took you under the house and everything too and the gardens and all that and then we went to see

28:47.320 --> 28:51.900
Pan's Labyrinth fun. I need to do one of the Halloween flashlight tours. I don't even like

28:52.160 --> 28:55.440
They do it on Halloween and every Friday the 13th. Ah

28:56.560 --> 29:03.720
Okay, but the one we did underground we had to wear hard hats and they did ghost stories. Oh boy

29:03.880 --> 29:05.880
Yeah, all right. All right

29:05.920 --> 29:08.600
Too spooky for me. I won't even go and see it

29:09.280 --> 29:15.400
I'm not gonna go see it because of what I heard that they did with the one minority character in it

29:15.760 --> 29:19.780
Hmm Alan really wants to see it cuz he likes scary movies, but I'm just like

29:21.320 --> 29:26.440
Brutal. Yeah, I don't wanna do jumpscares. All right. Anyway, let's get back to video games Loki. How was your gaming week?

29:26.440 --> 29:31.560
Um, I didn't play a whole ton of stuff. I did play some things. I went back and played Lewis Skyrim and

29:32.240 --> 29:34.240
I also played some

29:35.560 --> 29:38.640
The Lego movie game which is pretty fun and

29:39.120 --> 29:46.080
I also played some more of the office space. I don't clicker game on the phone because

29:46.680 --> 29:48.680
It's just on my phone and convenient

29:49.400 --> 29:51.400
but yes this week has been

29:53.200 --> 29:54.800
Like I

29:54.800 --> 30:00.560
Last weekend. I took a trip to the Lego store. I kind of wish I hadn't gone to the legos. Oh, I

30:01.080 --> 30:07.300
Bought a nice set is you know large. Let me guess for your kids knows from me

30:08.060 --> 30:12.780
No, I bought them their own sets but I I got this set for me I'm not ashamed that

30:13.620 --> 30:19.780
You know, I have a buzz it shouldn't be but it's just like it's like diving back into that whole like scene

30:19.780 --> 30:23.380
it's like wow, there's a lot of stuff out there, but

30:23.900 --> 30:26.820
yeah, and I don't want to go back to the story because it's

30:27.660 --> 30:29.500
There come my god

30:29.500 --> 30:34.900
And what's the $800 in the Millennium Falcon? Thank God. I'm not a star that big of a Star Wars fan now, however

30:35.580 --> 30:41.180
Then then Jago City looks pretty awesome and I'm not fanning Jago either but that's a pretty cool-looking set

30:42.420 --> 30:47.620
All right, anything else for your gaming week outside of all that Lego stuff? Uh, no, okay

30:48.220 --> 30:53.460
My gaming week, so I'm not a lot of new stuff. I've kind of been going back to stuff

30:53.460 --> 30:56.940
I used to play I did a stream earlier this week on no man's sky

30:56.940 --> 31:01.820
Which I'd kind of already done a couple weeks ago just kind of re-exploring kind of a lot of the changes

31:01.860 --> 31:06.780
So I started another new file from the very beginning on stream because I finally moved my PlayStation 4

31:06.860 --> 31:11.140
Into the office where I do the live streaming so I can actually stream from PlayStation 4

31:11.580 --> 31:15.380
Which I'm still trying to decide if I'm gonna do tonight or not. I'm on the fence about what I'm gonna stream tonight

31:16.260 --> 31:18.260
so yeah, there's that and

31:19.020 --> 31:21.700
Yeah, I've been playing PlayStation 4 games in there

31:21.700 --> 31:25.780
Otherwise, I've been playing like overwatch fall fancy 14 a lot of the same stuff

31:25.780 --> 31:29.300
I also randomly just kind of picked up heroes of the storm again

31:30.020 --> 31:35.620
Which I've been playing a lot of versus AI in heroes of the storm to get my little daily quest done

31:35.700 --> 31:40.520
So I could save up gold and I saved up 10,000 gold this past week and I bought diva

31:41.140 --> 31:46.060
Character for who's of course one of the big overwatch characters who was recently not that long ago

31:46.060 --> 31:48.700
Probably about a month or two ago put into heroes of the storm

31:48.700 --> 31:51.640
So I actually bought her so I could use her in play

31:51.700 --> 31:59.240
But I haven't really done a lot of player versus player just because I still feel like I'm I'm understanding the here's my thing

31:59.240 --> 32:03.040
With heroes of the storm and and a lot of MOBAs where I where I hit a wall in general

32:03.040 --> 32:03.760
I

32:03.760 --> 32:09.880
Understand kind of like the general rules how to play what to do what not to do and I kind of generally understand the operation

32:09.880 --> 32:10.680
my character

32:10.680 --> 32:15.960
What I'm still learning about that makes it very hard and I think to put my foot into the player versus player is that I'm not

32:15.960 --> 32:21.160
Familiar enough with what all the other players do because you know in a game like here's the storm

32:21.160 --> 32:26.040
There's like 40 different people you can pick from and I know the moves for the five or six ones that I like to play

32:26.120 --> 32:28.400
But then I'll be playing against somebody and I'm like, whoa

32:28.400 --> 32:31.400
He just did a move where he like froze me in place from across the battlefield

32:31.440 --> 32:34.520
How did that happen, you know, and I'm still kind of like learning about all that

32:34.520 --> 32:38.680
So I don't know when it's safe to you know, like Yolo and run in there

32:38.680 --> 32:40.760
And I don't know when I got a hold back. So there's a lot of that stuff

32:40.760 --> 32:42.760
I'm still learning about and you know when you get into

32:42.800 --> 32:46.880
When you get into some of the competitive stuff people get a lot more heated if you don't know your stuff

32:46.880 --> 32:50.040
so I've just been a little little sheepish and getting in there, but

32:50.600 --> 32:55.480
I'm gonna find somebody who plays a lot more than I do to take me under their wing and go maybe a

32:55.720 --> 32:57.840
Grandpa from courthouse plays a lot of heroes of the storm

32:57.840 --> 33:02.300
I don't know if you guys know but he's like level 400 probably so I'm gonna try to get him to

33:02.400 --> 33:04.400
take me into some matches and

33:04.840 --> 33:07.640
Check it out and play a little more of that. So that's

33:08.280 --> 33:09.560
that's

33:09.560 --> 33:12.440
You know pretty much a game that I've been playing quite a bit of this week

33:12.600 --> 33:15.280
But yeah, not really otherwise not a lot of new stuff

33:15.280 --> 33:21.720
I mean when I went to Dragon Con I played like enough Splatoon to have participated in the Splatfest

33:21.800 --> 33:23.800
Which we ended up losing anyway

33:23.880 --> 33:27.000
But at least the theme was better than the catch-up mayo thing

33:27.000 --> 33:31.960
At least this the invisibility of flight was like, okay flight one and that's not the team I picked

33:31.960 --> 33:33.960
But at least I'm not like offended by that

33:34.760 --> 33:36.000
Let's see

33:36.000 --> 33:40.780
and then I got to play some of the cool arcade stuff that they had Dragon Con cuz you know they get they have Tokyo

33:40.780 --> 33:47.100
Attack was there who brings a lot of Japanese and import arcade machines to conventions and then they have like a classic bar

33:47.420 --> 33:50.140
In the area brought in some classic arcade machines

33:50.140 --> 33:53.420
So I was able to play some of those too. Are they supposed to be bringing the table flipping game in there?

33:53.460 --> 33:56.380
Yeah, they had two at the table flipping game at Dragon Con. Yeah, it was cool

33:56.380 --> 34:01.120
I I never got around to playing that I was playing neon FM because it's the first time I'd seen a neon FM

34:01.240 --> 34:07.000
Neon FM that had Korean songs in it and I was like what so I had to play, you know, like mr

34:07.000 --> 34:10.000
Simple and some of the songs that I recognized, you know from what kpop

34:10.000 --> 34:14.720
I've been exposed to I had to play that stuff because I thought it was awesome that that was in neon FM

34:14.720 --> 34:21.760
So I hope that's in all the machines and not just the ones the Tokyo attack is moving around cuz I want to play all

34:21.760 --> 34:24.060
Those songs cuz yeah kpop is awesome

34:25.520 --> 34:30.560
What else I want to say, oh the classic arcade I will say this the classic arcade the the joystick bar

34:30.560 --> 34:35.280
I think it was called that brought these games in they had a Donkey Kong remix

34:35.680 --> 34:38.480
Machine and the Donkey Kong jr. Remix machine

34:38.480 --> 34:42.920
I didn't get to play jr. Somebody else is on that but I played Donkey Kong remix and basically

34:42.920 --> 34:46.720
I mean it feels like it's just a ROM hack basically of the original Donkey Kong

34:46.720 --> 34:53.480
But like with modified levels basically and it's it's flippin hard. I couldn't even get past like halfway

34:53.480 --> 34:55.720
You know, the first board is like climbing up

34:56.880 --> 35:00.760
You know the rafters and ladder I couldn't even get like halfway through that board

35:00.760 --> 35:02.200
I guess I'm not a real gamer

35:02.240 --> 35:07.200
But I couldn't even get like halfway through that board like it was crazy hard, so

35:07.960 --> 35:11.480
Yeah, so Donkey Kong remix means Donkey Kong hard as hell

35:12.080 --> 35:16.560
Basically, that's all about so but it was it was cool to have played one kaizo kong

35:18.440 --> 35:22.320
That would be a good alternate name for it, but that's uh, yeah, that's what it is

35:23.200 --> 35:25.160
All right. Anyhow, uh

35:25.160 --> 35:28.240
Let's see going to our chat over at live dot vog network comm act

35:28.240 --> 35:33.720
Def says that diva got introduced in heroes of the storm when the officer diva skin got introduced into overwatch

35:33.720 --> 35:39.000
Oh, that was a few months ago. I guess I've just been kind of out of it. Oh, yeah, Bobby Blackwolf reminds me

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
We did play pac-man vs

35:41.400 --> 35:46.560
Because he has the Namco thing on the switch and then I downloaded that app that lets you play

35:46.880 --> 35:50.880
Pac-man vs. So we played that on the switch. That was fun. I like that. That was a good party game

35:50.880 --> 35:52.760
So, I mean, it's a bummer

35:52.760 --> 35:57.260
We didn't get to play it with more people because it was just Bobby and I and then like two computer ghosts

35:57.340 --> 36:03.660
So wasn't as thrilling as I'm sure a room full of people is but we had fun. It was a fun game. So

36:04.180 --> 36:05.860
alright

36:05.860 --> 36:08.420
We're gonna move on to some other

36:09.340 --> 36:13.420
Announcements such as please follow us on twitter twitter.com slash olr

36:13.420 --> 36:18.640
We're also on facebook at orange lounge radio as far as upcoming shows off. I can't think of any

36:18.640 --> 36:20.520
I think we're gonna be here for the foreseeable future

36:20.520 --> 36:24.140
We'll probably take something off around the holiday, but no more conventions or anything like that

36:24.660 --> 36:29.780
Sadly I'm not I'm not even gonna go to magfest this next year sadly, and it's nothing against magfest. They're great

36:29.780 --> 36:31.780
I just go to dragcon with me next year. I

36:32.260 --> 36:34.340
I'd love to actually go to that at some point

36:34.340 --> 36:37.660
I just I have no more time off work after everything that happened over the summer

36:37.660 --> 36:40.060
I burned all my time off. So I have to make some cutbacks

36:40.060 --> 36:44.060
I had to take the time off to go to drag gun con had to take that unpaid

36:44.380 --> 36:48.940
So but it was worth it. It was totally worth it. I'm quitting Wow, you're quitting Wow

36:49.140 --> 36:53.500
Yeah, no one plays anymore and it's it's true not fun playing by myself

36:53.500 --> 36:58.140
Oh, well, what about what about trying to find a new posse to play with like, yeah

36:58.140 --> 37:03.260
I bet there's some great like like-minded gamers out there. Like well, here's the bummer

37:03.260 --> 37:09.940
I would say talk to the ladies from girls gone Wow, right like raven each other server. They would what's that international?

37:09.940 --> 37:11.980
They don't have an international server. That's the problem

37:11.980 --> 37:16.260
They don't have an international server because I bet those ladies would love to have super like flying around though

37:17.180 --> 37:23.340
If Final Fantasy 14 had flying around and not shitty, you know leveling system then I would go back

37:23.340 --> 37:26.020
You do have flying around in the later areas

37:26.020 --> 37:30.940
You know, you don't have jumping off of things and extending wings and getting into places. You're not supposed to go

37:33.220 --> 37:36.360
You do have jumping off of things with your wings in the later areas

37:36.360 --> 37:39.120
You have to get in heaven's ward, but you could do it, but it's your wings

37:39.700 --> 37:46.220
Yeah, you get a you get mounts that fly. I don't want a flying mount. I want like demon hunter powers

37:46.220 --> 37:47.540
Oh

37:47.540 --> 37:53.020
That type of demon hunters are fucking fun. No, then no, you don't have that in in file man

37:53.020 --> 37:59.320
Demon hunters are fucking fun. You need to I know you don't like first-person shooters, but in overwatch

38:00.080 --> 38:04.420
Mercy made me nauseously sick. Oh, that's a bummer because Mercy's getting a new ability

38:04.420 --> 38:07.860
It's gonna let her fly around anywhere and it's fun to play with and go to places

38:07.860 --> 38:12.420
You're not supposed to go to on the political show. So not nauseously sick. That's a bummer. Sorry to hear that

38:13.220 --> 38:16.120
They should consider a third-person mode that might help with that

38:16.620 --> 38:22.140
If it was third person, I could probably have no problem playing it see and it would I wouldn't think it would be that hard

38:22.140 --> 38:25.100
To implement because you can spectate other people

38:25.620 --> 38:30.860
Maybe or maybe there is a way to do it and I just don't know maybe our chatters know over at live dot vog network

38:31.180 --> 38:32.340
calm

38:32.340 --> 38:37.580
Let's see. I'm also looking at our chat. Oh, I remembered what other games we played

38:37.580 --> 38:41.700
Go ahead before we get into news we played we put we broke out the Neo Geo. Oh

38:42.380 --> 38:45.300
Yeah, I saw some your picture played summer. I should own two

38:45.300 --> 38:49.720
well ours is a Japanese once the summer my spirits to and the first summer I show down and

38:50.460 --> 38:52.460
I think some magician Lord

38:52.500 --> 38:59.500
So we played the Neo Geo with the huge cartridges the size of someone's head at least a small child's head

39:02.260 --> 39:06.580
About a little bigger than a baby a little bigger than a baby. All right

39:07.580 --> 39:13.060
Let's get into some gaming news and I'm gonna there's there's a lot of controversial stuff this week guys

39:13.060 --> 39:16.380
I I I guess this was the week where everything blew up

39:16.380 --> 39:23.380
So brace yourselves, but we're gonna be we're gonna be tactful as we dive into the controversy tonight starting with this whopper, right?

39:23.380 --> 39:26.620
Logie, so South Park factory hole is gonna be coming out

39:26.620 --> 39:29.920
I'm thinking next year now and so they've been doing some like kind of gaming

39:30.060 --> 39:34.860
It's actually in six weeks. If I if I remember I'd it's like six like end of October in it. I got delayed

39:34.860 --> 39:36.860
No, I thought I got delayed

39:37.060 --> 39:41.660
My will look into that just so we are accurate, but I thought I thought it had been delayed to this one

39:41.660 --> 39:45.260
I was looking forward to oh, maybe maybe I'm thinking that I don't know

39:45.260 --> 39:51.140
I know it's one I was looking forward to so maybe hopefully it's coming out soon, but it is yeah worldwide October 17th

39:51.140 --> 39:54.520
That's what I thought. Hey, you're getting yeah, you got confused because it was delayed

39:56.420 --> 39:58.420
It wouldn't be surprised if it's

39:59.220 --> 40:02.140
That's fair. It's fair. But yes, it's so

40:02.740 --> 40:04.620
Should be coming out soon and

40:04.620 --> 40:09.420
Of course, they're doing you know with that the whole media blitzing where their gameplay previews and stuff

40:09.420 --> 40:14.180
and so one of the very beginning parts of the game is creating your character and so like

40:14.580 --> 40:20.620
Unlike actually the first South Park game you can actually play as a girl or even a transgendered person in this one

40:20.740 --> 40:27.420
But there is a portion of the game where it's asking me to pick your skin color and it says with that, you know

40:28.100 --> 40:30.660
it's also your game difficulty and

40:31.140 --> 40:35.740
With Cartman says he actually makes a comment. Don't worry. This doesn't actually affect combat

40:35.740 --> 40:39.660
It's just every other aspect of your whole life, which I think is kind of funny

40:40.220 --> 40:45.140
So actually a pretty good commentary it to be crystal clear the easy mode

40:45.140 --> 40:48.740
You have light skin the difficult mode. You have dark skin now

40:49.900 --> 40:56.180
basically, it's gonna be it's gonna the way that's gonna work is it's a the amount of money that you get from

40:56.620 --> 41:01.560
You know different events and also how characters treat you in the game so

41:02.260 --> 41:06.220
There could be some hilarious, you know South Park stuff, you know with the police

41:06.220 --> 41:13.620
I'm sure you know like the whole Michael Jackson episode. Mmm. Well, you know, go ahead Darcyra. I honestly think that it's

41:15.980 --> 41:21.020
Not in there to be crass per se but it's in there as part of I think

41:21.500 --> 41:28.060
Commentary on current society, but they're also though. I mean they also have it in there where you can be a

41:28.980 --> 41:30.980
transgender character

41:32.100 --> 41:35.820
Yeah, after picking your skin color you meet with mr. Mackey who?

41:37.220 --> 41:39.220
okay about your

41:39.980 --> 41:47.380
Gender identification so that includes male female or other and then even after choosing one of those you can choose specify if your cisgender or

41:47.580 --> 41:52.780
Transgender and I guess he like if he calls your parents to confirm all that stuff as well

41:53.180 --> 41:58.380
Because there's they kind of played back to the joke, you know, cuz the original game all you could be is a boy in there

41:58.380 --> 42:04.380
Yeah, and so like that's so weird. You know, we thought this whole time that you were a boy. I mean

42:05.300 --> 42:12.660
It's just like kind of funny. Okay. Okay. I watched the scene where a person picked a cisgender female

42:12.780 --> 42:16.200
It's like you mean you knew she was a girl the whole time

42:17.000 --> 42:18.880
Yes

42:18.880 --> 42:20.880
Okay

42:20.920 --> 42:24.720
It was pretty funny so so here's the thing, you know what I got

42:24.720 --> 42:28.520
I'm gonna admit my gut reaction when I saw that whole like difficulty slider thing

42:28.520 --> 42:32.560
I was like, wow, that's fucked up. But then I was like, it's really fucked up in real life, too

42:32.560 --> 42:40.880
So that was that was pretty much my reaction to that, you know South Park doesn't really shy away from that type of stuff

42:40.880 --> 42:45.400
But and let me go to our chat over at live dot vog network comm cuz that guys you don't in our chat see

42:45.720 --> 42:50.840
Here's here's the part where I'm having difficulty because I I'm not black neither is Loki neither is darsakha

42:50.840 --> 42:54.040
But I know many of you we have many different colors out there that listen to the show, which is awesome

42:54.600 --> 43:00.920
And Kai's you don't in chat says I'm black and I find that hilarious and true. What's the controversy?

43:01.520 --> 43:04.320
Well from what you know because I haven't said a lot on this

43:04.320 --> 43:06.760
I've just been trying to read what other people have to say on this

43:07.080 --> 43:11.560
Some of what I'm seeing on Twitter from people of color just some of what I've seen, you know

43:11.560 --> 43:14.400
retweeted in my timeline and stuff some of the negative I'm seeing is that

43:14.920 --> 43:20.280
My or the the life experiences and I'm gonna try to summarize best I can here

43:20.280 --> 43:21.600
So, I'm sorry if I'm misrepresenting it

43:21.600 --> 43:25.920
But the life experiences and the things that I've gone through are not a joke

43:26.080 --> 43:31.920
Like this is not something to be belittled by a game type of thing. I don't know that it's in there is a joke

43:32.480 --> 43:34.400
But like even if it is a joke

43:34.400 --> 43:38.160
I don't think yeah, I get it that you're offended by it and great

43:38.160 --> 43:41.320
You can be offended by that but they make fun of everything

43:42.040 --> 43:46.320
Everything everybody everything is a joke everything. So

43:47.080 --> 43:52.560
Yeah, you'll be you'll be offended by this thing and then the next thing they do someone else is gonna be offended by that

43:52.560 --> 43:56.040
It's I mean what they had abortion jokes in the last game

43:56.040 --> 44:00.880
I mean, there's all sorts of I'm offended that sixth graders are bad guys

44:01.280 --> 44:06.720
There's all sorts of like jokes that are it's it's offensive and yes, it's okay to be offended

44:06.720 --> 44:10.760
It's not okay for you to expect them to change the game because you're offended by it

44:10.760 --> 44:12.040
I think you know

44:12.040 --> 44:17.380
It's it for me and you know kind of trying to think about this and process those sort of responses and try to weigh

44:17.380 --> 44:20.400
Like, you know the the negatives that I am hearing as well

44:20.400 --> 44:23.940
It's like the positives from people of color that like, you know, like I should have just said in chat

44:23.940 --> 44:26.880
Like what's the problem? This is you know funny or whatever

44:27.480 --> 44:28.680
so

44:28.680 --> 44:33.080
And when I come in turn away with that is that it kind of goes back to in my mind this whole video games are

44:33.080 --> 44:36.840
Art type of thing right and we've you know speaking of controversy

44:36.840 --> 44:41.080
That's been one of the age-old controversy in the video game community our video games art

44:41.360 --> 44:44.480
Well art is meant to provoke response

44:44.720 --> 44:51.040
So I would say in some ways, you know, he did this whole conversation that's happening right now is

44:51.640 --> 44:54.140
In a way and some people are gonna you know

44:54.140 --> 44:58.280
But but this is just honestly where my gut my gut is is going with this is that this whole conversation?

44:58.280 --> 45:03.560
We're having right now just kind of proves the fact that video games are art and the art may not be making a statement

45:03.560 --> 45:09.560
That you like but it's making a statement and it is a reflection on an art is a reflection on culture and it is

45:10.200 --> 45:16.460
Definitely a reflection on culture be it very a very sassy one, but it's you know, there's a lot of

45:17.240 --> 45:23.860
Serious fucking shit out there and reasons why there's things that exist like Black Lives Matter and so forth and to an extent

45:23.860 --> 45:27.080
I wonder why some people get offended

45:27.800 --> 45:34.960
About things that don't necessarily affect them. Does that make sense? Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah

45:36.160 --> 45:41.260
Call like I see it. I see all the time on tumblr all the time on tumblr not to say everybody on tumblr is bad

45:41.260 --> 45:45.760
That's not what I'm saying. But you get you get that stuff. We're like, um, what was that post?

45:45.760 --> 45:51.320
Oh some post that made its way onto like a Facebook screen cap where somebody

45:52.160 --> 45:58.140
Retweeted a picture of a little girl doing a Japanese tea ceremony and one tumblr user was like

45:58.480 --> 46:03.420
This is so effed up and it's cultural appropriation to the dot and then a person in Japan

46:03.840 --> 46:10.480
Responded to that saying actually we we love it type of thing kind of kind of similar with the Mexico and Mario

46:11.480 --> 46:14.500
Odyssey thing with a sombrero. It's like actually we kind of like it

46:14.500 --> 46:20.440
I will rather go on a limb and say though that there is a very very very long history

46:20.520 --> 46:22.520
of

46:22.720 --> 46:24.160
Japanese culture

46:24.160 --> 46:28.720
Adopting things from surrounding areas and making it something uniquely Japanese

46:29.040 --> 46:35.220
So I would think that seeing other countries do that may not be such a big deal, you know

46:37.920 --> 46:42.320
That being said what offended me is that number one the kimono was wrong

46:43.640 --> 46:45.640
It was done wrong

46:46.000 --> 46:49.560
All right, I'm gonna go to our chat because I do I was trying to make a joke

46:50.440 --> 46:54.200
I wasn't sure dark Sakura some things. I don't know. All right

46:54.920 --> 47:00.480
In in our chat over at live dog network calm Bobby black wolf says this and I think that this is a fair response

47:00.720 --> 47:07.760
by black wolf says controversy is this a black person who wants to play a character that looks like them has to either deal with

47:07.760 --> 47:11.600
The harder difficulty or play someone who doesn't look like them

47:11.800 --> 47:18.720
That's why some people are upset but it's not everything like to say it's it's just like money payouts in the game

47:18.720 --> 47:20.720
Yes, I get that. Yeah, I

47:21.040 --> 47:25.960
Kind of annoying it would be it would be nice if maybe after they make the point

47:25.960 --> 47:30.200
Then there's like something where it's like press square to change, you know

47:30.200 --> 47:36.020
So, you know, maybe maybe like after they make their point you can actually because I know the combat you can tweak how difficult the combat

47:36.020 --> 47:40.080
Is yeah, like you can make that easier or harder depending on and you can keep change that throughout the game

47:40.080 --> 47:45.200
Yeah, so and I don't know like honestly playing the game but like last time with the money and stuff

47:45.200 --> 47:50.320
I don't think you ever run into a problem with it's probably just gonna be very minor. Mm-hmm

47:50.320 --> 47:57.200
It's just more of like ha ha it's like a silly thing that we did some of the controversial some of the one

47:57.560 --> 48:03.160
Positive I was gonna mention is they mentioned that the game is not gonna be censored in any country

48:03.840 --> 48:09.640
Unlike it was last time Oh with the whole anal probing stuff. They're not gonna censor it. I'm in a country

48:09.640 --> 48:14.860
So Australia is probably not gonna sell it. So it's gonna be exactly, you know as it is in all countries

48:15.320 --> 48:20.500
Much love to our Australian listeners, but you know that they there's games that get censored there all the time

48:20.500 --> 48:27.960
So anyway, Mortal Kombat and all that. All right. Anyway, I also would like to go out on a limb if I may

48:27.960 --> 48:30.200
Yeah, where people talk about

48:33.120 --> 48:38.740
Issues of appropriation and things like that and trying to like in the case of the game, you know

48:38.920 --> 48:44.480
Taking something that's going on in real life and making it an undisputable undeniable factor

48:44.520 --> 48:47.400
I think the thing that people need to realize is that

48:48.920 --> 48:54.160
I'm trying to figure out how to say this the right way sure that everyone is gonna borrow from everybody

48:54.600 --> 48:58.400
That's the whole point of having multiple cultures in one place

48:58.400 --> 49:01.880
Yeah, when you live in a melting pot like America things are going to melt

49:03.040 --> 49:08.740
You know and and yes, I realize there's a lot going on on a much higher level and stuff that you know

49:08.740 --> 49:11.600
Makes you wonder sometimes if America really is a melting pot

49:11.600 --> 49:15.600
But I think there's a lot of us that love that part about America

49:15.600 --> 49:19.040
Well as a share 100 Matt makes a good phrase in here in the last game

49:19.040 --> 49:23.980
You could pick a Jew class it changed the way the game was played. You also got different payouts and story and stuff

49:24.800 --> 49:28.440
Hi. Yeah, you know, um, I

49:29.440 --> 49:33.880
Think that maybe we might need a little bit more of these things

49:34.380 --> 49:39.160
desensitizing people a little bit, you know bringing those things to light instead of putting it in a

49:39.520 --> 49:45.260
Convenient package that we can get offended about for five seconds argue on the internet and then

49:45.680 --> 49:53.080
Conveniently put aside in our lives, you know, I think that's the big thing is that we are so enamored with that moment of

49:53.720 --> 49:56.940
Being the right one being right being right, you know

49:57.680 --> 49:59.680
that after a while

50:00.760 --> 50:07.320
It becomes the focus instead of actually going out there and doing good. So I'm glad it's in the game

50:07.360 --> 50:12.080
I'm glad it's bringing attention to things that people should be talking about instead of just putting on the back burner

50:12.480 --> 50:18.360
All right, and you know what? I invite other responses out there too. Like I said, I think on a topic like this

50:18.360 --> 50:22.600
I'm just kind of trying to listen to the different perspectives and you know interpret the art that way

50:22.600 --> 50:26.240
So I certainly invite all the feedback if you don't feel like your point was represented here tonight

50:26.800 --> 50:30.640
Participate at orange lounge radio comm come on up to the table. Like I said earlier

50:30.640 --> 50:34.840
It's a big diner table and let's hear from all those different perspectives in the meantime, though

50:34.840 --> 50:37.900
I'd like to move on with some more gaming news because it is only a three-hour show

50:38.040 --> 50:41.920
so let's talk about something going on on the Nintendo switch and

50:42.520 --> 50:47.620
This is controversial in a much different way, but literally a gaming controversy really

50:48.000 --> 50:49.560
Here's the deal is that you know

50:49.560 --> 50:54.720
I think a lot of people were drawn to the whole cartridge idea of the switch because oh well

50:54.720 --> 50:56.040
Then I'm not gonna really you know

50:56.040 --> 50:56.800
It's okay

50:56.800 --> 51:02.600
if there's only 32 gigs of storage or whatever it is on the switch because I can get stuff on cartridges and it's not really

51:02.600 --> 51:07.000
Taking a memory and you know, it's it's different right when you had an old-school Super Nintendo

51:07.040 --> 51:11.560
You didn't have to have a cartridge based or I mean you didn't have to have any type of like on

51:11.720 --> 51:14.920
Board storage or anything like that, right? So anyhow, um

51:15.920 --> 51:17.000
Excuse me

51:17.000 --> 51:22.240
Well, it turns out that may not be the case and I want to thank our discord for submitting this to us if you want

51:22.240 --> 51:29.000
To join our discord server and bounce us ideas throughout the week. You can vog network comm slash discord will get you an invite

51:29.000 --> 51:29.800
It's an open server

51:29.800 --> 51:34.320
I think it was dungeon buster that submitted this and I'm sorry if I if I get this wrong

51:34.880 --> 51:36.640
so anyway

51:36.640 --> 51:43.080
In the future some switch games are going to require you to actually own a micro SD card in order to play

51:44.000 --> 51:50.560
NBA 2k 18 is going to be the first game that's gonna require that additional storage to be present

51:50.640 --> 51:56.200
So yep, you can't actually fit all of 2k NBA 2k 18 onto just the cartridge

51:56.400 --> 52:02.320
You're gonna have to actually install some of it to the extra micro SD card your storage card now

52:02.320 --> 52:06.260
Here's the deal a portion of the title will be available outside the box

52:06.640 --> 52:12.120
But you I guess slowly download the rest of it while you're actually playing

52:12.920 --> 52:16.840
Representative for Nintendo of America actually said in a quote that yes

52:16.840 --> 52:20.520
a micro SD card will be needed for certain Nintendo switch games that contain an

52:20.880 --> 52:25.920
Especially large amount of content and require additional storage for players to enjoy the full experience

52:25.920 --> 52:30.280
If you purchase a physical version of a game that requires an additional micro SD memory card

52:30.280 --> 52:35.600
You'll be able to play a portion of the game right out of the box specific levels or mode to enjoy the full game

52:36.160 --> 52:38.680
Downloading additional data is required. So

52:39.400 --> 52:42.360
Apparently cartridges won't hold the whole game sometime

52:42.360 --> 52:46.640
I'm sure they would but they just have to have to pay for more expensive cartridges that hold more data

52:47.000 --> 52:50.680
God forbid we do that because then that would cut into our margin

52:51.560 --> 52:52.760
Yeah

52:52.760 --> 52:54.980
maybe this optical media stuff was

52:56.120 --> 52:59.260
Maybe that's why they do it because it's so fucking cheap

53:00.240 --> 53:02.240
could

53:02.400 --> 53:10.120
G why is the whole industry doing that? I don't fucking know why well, but to be fair in a portable environment

53:10.120 --> 53:16.600
I mean it worked. All right on the PSP, I guess but maybe optimal reading and stuff isn't I mean even the Vita used cartridges

53:16.600 --> 53:18.600
for a reason so maybe

53:18.800 --> 53:24.440
Optical discs and things weren't really the best in a portable environment. I mean, I guess the PSP worked

53:24.440 --> 53:28.920
Okay, but I'm sure even it had its limitations and you could make it skip if you shook it hard enough

53:28.920 --> 53:32.100
You know, I mean, so it's never I'm just saying low key in that regard

53:32.840 --> 53:39.880
I'm not saying that those I don't think we're that easy to duplicate as well. Well, here's what here's what it is

53:39.880 --> 53:41.520
Loki, let's be right. Here's what it is

53:41.600 --> 53:49.040
This is more a commentary on the fact that Nintendo's default out-of-the-box on storage space is way too small

53:49.600 --> 53:56.160
Exactly. That's that's the real problem. Was it 32 gigs? Uh-huh, cuz 32 gigs with fucking too small in the Wii U

53:56.160 --> 54:02.760
No, it's still fucking too small with this shit if that's just ridiculous, but but never fear Loki

54:02.760 --> 54:07.520
they'll be the 2018 model of the switch that comes in neon red and

54:08.200 --> 54:11.800
Fluorescent green and it comes with 128 gigs of storage fuck

54:11.800 --> 54:16.240
No, it'll come with like 64 gigabytes of storage or like 48 gigabytes or something stupid

54:17.240 --> 54:24.200
Now SSG 100 Matt kind of thrown it back a little bit saying I remember sports games dating back to the Dreamcast days

54:24.760 --> 54:31.240
Required that you played with a memory card. You wouldn't be able to continue without having a memory card inserted

54:31.480 --> 54:32.840
Well, I

54:32.840 --> 54:38.420
Mean you missed a lot on the Dreamcast without those awesome little VM you things which by the way

54:38.420 --> 54:43.380
Happy birthday Dreamcast because yesterday nine nine, you know all the way back to nine nine ninety nine was the Dreamcast birthday

54:43.600 --> 54:47.320
But you would miss out on stuff without those little VM use

54:48.280 --> 54:50.240
Well, it's also I think that was more of like

54:50.240 --> 54:54.680
Cashy and stuff because that was the only storage that there was on that system. So it was I

54:55.680 --> 55:00.440
Kind of always felt we had Tamagotchi to thank a little bit for that that it was kind of

55:00.800 --> 55:04.000
Dark sacrifice just gave me the biggest no face in the world

55:04.000 --> 55:10.360
But I kind of feel like that was in a way from that, you know, no you don't agree. Not at all

55:10.360 --> 55:13.820
All right. What's your take on it? I think that they wanted

55:15.000 --> 55:19.040
Something that was gonna make the system more unique and offer a more interactive type of play

55:19.040 --> 55:25.300
Mm-hmm. I mean cuz things like that had existed for years. Anyway having the little you know digital toys

55:25.300 --> 55:28.320
I mean if you want to go really I

55:28.740 --> 55:32.120
Would probably put the origin more in those little tiger toys or

55:32.840 --> 55:34.640
the game and watch

55:34.640 --> 55:35.840
so

55:35.840 --> 55:39.920
We're looking much further back and Akuma JP correcting my pronunciation

55:40.840 --> 55:47.320
Tamagotchi, I think I think we got spoiled here in the USA in Tamagotchi not not because the whole like stupid American thing

55:47.320 --> 55:51.240
But like gotcha was really ingrained in the culture with Pokemon and all that stuff

55:51.240 --> 55:54.240
So I think a lot of people would say gotcha as opposed like, you know

55:54.240 --> 55:58.080
Cuz that's that's what we kind of knew with Pokemon. Anyway, I'm just excusing my ignorance. Sorry

55:58.480 --> 56:05.400
But Tamagotchi and it's so you know what the name it's it would be a portmanteau Tamago for egg and

56:08.240 --> 56:11.200
Now my brain just forgot Chi Tamado Chi Oh

56:12.120 --> 56:14.040
Doesn't friend. Oh

56:14.040 --> 56:17.960
Okay, it's an egg friend. Okay, see I didn't but I actually didn't know that

56:17.960 --> 56:22.480
Okay, and I'm sure that they had no idea from the get-go that this would be an issue

56:22.480 --> 56:25.720
And that's why it's never been mentioned up until this point

56:26.720 --> 56:31.960
That this was gonna be a necessity. It's funny how after everyone's purchases systems it. Oh by the way

56:33.200 --> 56:40.240
This isn't gonna work exactly how you thought. Oh and this oh and that oh and that one other thing, too

56:41.320 --> 56:44.640
Yeah, have you heard some of the rumors about Nintendo having I know this isn't on the show world

56:44.640 --> 56:48.000
I've heard some of the rumors about Nintendo having a direct this week. Have you seen some of that?

56:48.000 --> 56:50.760
I don't fucking care cuz Apple's doing a thing this week

56:50.760 --> 56:53.000
So, you know where Apple goes Nintendo missed

56:53.000 --> 56:57.800
They're gonna blow them on stage because I mean seriously I don't care this point well actually actually

56:58.720 --> 57:00.040
Don't count it out

57:00.040 --> 57:03.840
Nintendo has shown up on the Apple stage before when they did Super Mario run and we know

57:04.000 --> 57:07.080
Nintendo's cooking a Zelda game in an Animal Crossing game

57:07.320 --> 57:14.200
So it is possible that Nintendo could come out and blow to fully look forward to that Zelda game

57:14.200 --> 57:20.400
I'm sure that's gonna be fucking don't knock it. They tried it. No. Yeah. I'm not saying that's not it's not possible for them

57:20.400 --> 57:23.680
To do is all the game like that cuz like I said, you know the DS games the DS

57:23.680 --> 57:27.320
All the games were pretty good and you could do those with mostly just the touch screen

57:27.320 --> 57:29.320
So it had a good control system for that

57:29.960 --> 57:34.120
However, I feel that they're gonna be tempted by the current, you know

57:34.120 --> 57:39.920
Mobile game scene and you're gonna get like a tapper game or some shit like that. It's gonna be like well

57:40.000 --> 57:46.800
That's not what I wanted but I would rather they give us a tapper game then try to bring breath of the wild

57:47.120 --> 57:51.480
To the phone cuz like you're not gonna be able to control that with a phone. I'm sorry

57:51.480 --> 57:56.780
I would rather it just be a fucking tapper game if that's you know, wrote the phone to throw the boomerang

57:57.720 --> 58:02.280
All right, but okay. Look we're getting away from the point. So Apple's doing a thing on Tuesday

58:02.280 --> 58:04.200
We all know they're expected to announce phones

58:04.200 --> 58:05.480
That's what all the rumors say

58:05.480 --> 58:09.000
Which is good news for me because I'm ready to upgrade from my six

58:09.000 --> 58:10.800
So I eagerly anticipate what they're gonna say

58:10.840 --> 58:14.240
But anyway Nintendo is rumored to do one on Wednesday

58:14.320 --> 58:20.000
now some people are kind of taking the ball and running with it and saying oh, this is when they're gonna announce Netflix and

58:20.560 --> 58:25.400
All the other things that we've been waiting for we're bringing Netflix to consoles for the first time ever

58:26.280 --> 58:31.080
It's never been done ever before. Well, okay. Well on this console

58:32.040 --> 58:38.120
Loki you joke but Nintendo and I've said this before on the show because and when we went back to

58:38.600 --> 58:42.360
Is it a big deal that Netflix is on it or not? I said this in the beginning

58:42.360 --> 58:43.560
I think yes

58:43.560 --> 58:48.040
Nintendo can make a huge argument that with certain Netflix shows because you know

58:48.040 --> 58:50.320
You can download a good chunk of Netflix library, right?

58:50.440 --> 58:54.080
You can start watching it on TV and then oh I got to make the bus

58:54.560 --> 59:00.280
click a little snap and I'm gonna pick it up and watch it on the go and continue my Netflix without an internet connection because

59:00.280 --> 59:06.080
It's been downloading in the background as I'm watching it. Like yes, Nintendo could say this is an experience

59:06.080 --> 59:08.080
You can't really do right now

59:08.200 --> 59:11.480
Except on my phone that I have in my pocket that I can do the exact

59:12.720 --> 59:16.640
You know the whole pick it up and go, you know, there's a twist to it

59:16.640 --> 59:22.240
But my phone certainly doesn't have 32 gigabytes worth of storage. I mean, it's just a phone

59:22.240 --> 59:25.480
You can't possibly fit that much data into a phone. It's

59:26.000 --> 59:28.400
Clearly this console is the only thing could do that

59:29.760 --> 59:36.280
It's just how about how are you just instead of fucking announcing Netflix, which really should have been there from the get-go

59:36.440 --> 59:42.280
How do we announce all the fucking shit that also should have been there from the get-go console virtual console a

59:43.080 --> 59:48.840
Web browser does that thing even fucking have a web browser? Yes. Okay. How do you think the e-shop works?

59:49.800 --> 59:53.120
Yes, but can you actually use a web browser on it?

59:53.320 --> 59:58.640
My understanding is it's been hacked because the e-shop or no the the network

59:58.640 --> 59:58.840
Okay

59:58.840 --> 01:00:05.680
The network thing has okay cuz like when I okay when I wanted to log into the Wi-Fi at the hotel during dragoncon

01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:12.440
To do Splatfest it actually because the hotel Wi-Fi you have to log into that right because you have to put in either the passphrase

01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:15.360
Or your last name and your room number to use hotel Wi-Fi, right?

01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:17.800
So believe it or not you try to connect to the network

01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:22.360
The switch is smart enough which not all game systems the password smart enough

01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:25.880
It pops up a browser window and it has the Hyatt's little screen

01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:30.680
Please put in your information that it added and all that and then it closes it and you're connected to the internet

01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:31.240
So yes

01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:34.400
there is a web browser and my understanding is people have kind of backdoored that because

01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:40.160
What you do is you use that same trick except the web page that you put on your personal network that you present is

01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:44.400
Whatever website you're really trying to get on the switch, which could be a flash game, you know

01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:48.840
I don't know if it's flash game, but you know, like games or something something else. So that's

01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:53.420
Okay, so it doesn't have a web browser that you can just click an icon and it works

01:00:53.420 --> 01:00:59.200
Okay. No, but there is it is is there a web browser in there? Yes. Can you use it? Not really that's

01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:02.580
Fucking makes sense that makes all the sense of the world

01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:11.320
Fucking hell, I swear whatever. You know what SSJ 100 Matt says, can you use the web browser for porn?

01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:16.440
I'm asking for a friend. All right, of course if you if you see me real, let's be real

01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:19.560
Nintendo needs to just have the real talk

01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:24.520
All right, Nintendo needs to have the real talk and give the gamers what they really want. All right, here's what needs to happen

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.360
Excuse me

01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:30.720
Reggie fees and may needs to do a special 10 o'clock at night in Nintendo Direct

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:34.400
Okay, he's gonna come out on this Nintendo Direct and say listen guys. I

01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:37.400
Know what it is. You really want out of your web browser

01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:42.920
I know what it really what it is. You really want out of your consoles. We're gonna give you all the porn you want

01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:51.460
And here's is the web browser. Yes, the Nintendo switch what you do. It's gonna it's gonna jack into sites such as

01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:57.800
Porn hub. Okay the new porn hub app for the Nintendo switch so you can start new me verse

01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:00.160
But it's you can start watching ever

01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:05.200
Yeah, you the wee wee verse so you can start watching pornography on the big screen

01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:08.200
But then when you hear the garage door open that somebody's coming home

01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:13.000
Just take it off the and take it back into your bedroom and finish what you started. I

01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:16.160
Got you guys love Reggie fees and may

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:24.400
But in order to have a separate would sell billions. You'd have a separate phone app and fucking like all the tethering cables possible

01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:26.160
They

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:28.160
Would still find a way to fuck that up

01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:31.740
They would still find a way I know but seriously though like

01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:38.600
JD and chat says so Rob phones plus a Chromecast can pretty much already do this

01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:44.240
Well, you know what? Some people are gonna do it just because it's Nintendo. Let's be real

01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:52.840
Now we're cutting work cutting edge with you know, the 3d technology because you could view 3d porn on the 3ds

01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:55.600
Which is kind of cool. Yes. Yes, you could I mean granted

01:02:55.600 --> 01:03:02.240
It was just very low-res pictures in 3d, but it was 3d. I think I saw a blurry tit

01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:05.580
Kind of poked out. Yeah a little bit

01:03:05.580 --> 01:03:06.520
But no, seriously

01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:11.640
They just need to announce what the hell their fucking virtual console plans are because right now when the hell is that launching do we even?

01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:14.720
No, no, and I was again again

01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:21.640
I I am ready to accept the fact that virtual console my quote II fingers this time around is gamecube games and

01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:24.760
Maybe Nintendo Wii and Wii U stuff

01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:31.640
That's mostly just fucking make a stupid like fuck this NES classic bullshit

01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:36.120
And he has caught you know, the super NES classic just make a virtual console

01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:43.200
Done you plug it in your TV download all that shit. That's basically what it is. Anyway, here's here's what really okay

01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:47.640
So we've been talking for like five minutes about a rumored Nintendo Direct. We don't even know if it's happening or not

01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:53.240
Here's the thing guys lower them expectations lower them y'all cuz Mario Odyssey

01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:57.160
They got to get the pre-orders in for that. So I would bet if they're having a direct it's an expanded

01:03:57.160 --> 01:04:01.440
Look at Mario Odyssey. Oh, it's gonna be there fucking amiibo. There's a Metroid game out on Friday

01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:05.160
Did you hear so maybe it's gonna be an extended look at the new Metroid game, which by the way

01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:07.600
I think you all would want to know I

01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:15.120
Pre-ordered that Samus 3dsx. Yeah, you said no you ordered it. I ordered it and already gave them money. Yes

01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:17.120
All

01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:23.780
Right, anyhow, I just gave up my best smartass smile. Yeah, I see that a lot from you. All right, let's move on dark soccer

01:04:23.780 --> 01:04:27.800
Why don't you why don't you give us a story then and I'll be a smartass to you speaking of

01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:29.560
other

01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:36.080
Unnecessary prefixes. I'm only going to use the word once and then I will no longer use it so that you know what I'm referring to

01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:42.740
Microtransactions because they are a transaction. You don't need to quantify them with how big they are

01:04:43.580 --> 01:04:48.780
If I buy penny candy, is that a micro transaction? No, but I'm only spending pennies

01:04:49.420 --> 01:04:50.580
No

01:04:50.580 --> 01:04:52.580
That is just a transaction

01:04:52.740 --> 01:04:55.740
Okay, transactions are not necessarily quantifiable

01:04:57.820 --> 01:05:04.980
Except by the actual amount that you've spent on it anyway, so destiny fans are pissed. What else is new?

01:05:07.180 --> 01:05:09.780
They brought about this

01:05:10.460 --> 01:05:17.100
You know in-game stuff that you could buy for the original destiny and so they're bringing it back for destiny, too

01:05:17.100 --> 01:05:19.100
But this one is even

01:05:19.340 --> 01:05:24.780
Worse, I think they're selling shaders that you can change the color of your armor

01:05:25.580 --> 01:05:26.740
and

01:05:26.740 --> 01:05:28.740
then

01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:34.660
One I mean in the original game when the shaders were unlocked you could have them across all of your characters and

01:05:34.860 --> 01:05:41.260
Then delete them and pick them up later, but in destiny two shaders are one-time use they're consumable

01:05:41.260 --> 01:05:44.000
You would be spending money for a consumable

01:05:44.700 --> 01:05:50.780
That you will never have access to again real money for shit. You can't use again. I

01:05:51.460 --> 01:05:53.460
Will leave that there

01:05:56.420 --> 01:06:00.860
The only way you'd ever be able to get another one is either with like a blind loot box

01:06:01.860 --> 01:06:04.820
Again that you can get with real money

01:06:05.780 --> 01:06:08.980
Or buy them straight up. So yeah

01:06:09.900 --> 01:06:11.500
stupid and

01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:15.460
There are people who love to make their armor look certain ways. They would be buying it

01:06:17.020 --> 01:06:22.780
You can I mean you can earn them through leveling and chests and whatnot, but yeah people

01:06:24.420 --> 01:06:30.020
It's well, it's it's also the fact that in the first game it operated a lot differently than it does in this game

01:06:30.020 --> 01:06:35.920
That's that's what's really cheese and people it sounds like now granted. I haven't played destiny 2 yet

01:06:36.500 --> 01:06:39.640
I've been hearing actually outside of this controversy

01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:42.980
I'm hearing a lot of good things about destiny 2 and I'm really excited to check it out

01:06:42.980 --> 01:06:48.380
My only issue is that I I've already decided I want to get it on PC so I can keyboard and mouse it up

01:06:48.380 --> 01:06:54.940
But the PC release is a few weeks away. It's the end of October. Mm-hmm. So hmm. No destiny for me

01:06:55.260 --> 01:06:58.220
Excuse me yet. I did I did play I didn't talk about in my game

01:06:58.220 --> 01:07:02.000
I played like 20 minutes of the beta on PC because you know

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:06.140
The PC beta was like the night before my flight to Dragon Con at 6 in the morning

01:07:06.420 --> 01:07:12.220
So I played like 20 I downloaded like 14 gigs to play for 20 minutes and I did enjoy my 20 minutes with destiny 2

01:07:12.780 --> 01:07:14.780
also, I have to say that I

01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:18.700
Had the same thought that Bobby did just for my rendering classes

01:07:19.540 --> 01:07:21.520
He said when I first read the story

01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:28.800
I thought shaders was in the game was in the game development term for how your light sources get shaded and I was like wait

01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:34.400
You're paying for light source effects. And I was like that was the first thing that I thought of too, but it's more like color

01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:36.600
Yeah, it's basically like, you know

01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:41.560
how World of Warcraft you get a piece of armor from this dungeon a piece of armor for that dungeon and you look like like

01:07:41.700 --> 01:07:45.760
You look like a thrift store nightmare, right? Like you're mismatched all over the place, right?

01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:49.240
Well because of transmogrification some of that you don't you can fix that

01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:53.880
No, now everyone's got particular sets and you can still make the sets look like they match

01:07:53.880 --> 01:07:59.000
They just give you a particular type for your body type. Okay, we'll have different colors apply to it

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:05.360
Well in a nutshell imagine that wasn't the case you still had mismatched stuff a shader will let you just dye it all

01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:08.960
matching colors and stuff like right off the bat and usually they are

01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:13.240
Shinier colors than what you might see native and I think I didn't play the original game

01:08:13.240 --> 01:08:19.040
But isn't the original game like the shader was used for like everything wasn't the full set or was it?

01:08:19.320 --> 01:08:21.280
per-piece I

01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:25.560
From what I recall you did the whole set like once you unlocked it you had it

01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:28.720
Yeah, it was the whole set and you can use it as many times you want

01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:33.320
So if you upgrade your armor, you can just change it again and all that stuff now

01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:36.400
You have to use it purse per piece. It's

01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:38.920
You can't change it out

01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:39.840
It's you know

01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:41.080
Basically once you've used it

01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:46.080
It's gone to consumable and then on top of that the only way to get it is through these loot boxes

01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:48.560
That you have to pay real money for

01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:51.360
And I guess you get some of them in the game

01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:54.000
But that's not even really the whole thing that people are getting pissed off

01:08:54.000 --> 01:09:00.800
People are also getting pissed off that there's mods in here and the mods basically grant you abilities to help you play better

01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:03.520
And so in a sense, it's kind of pay to win

01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:06.740
Because obviously someone that has more disposable

01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:14.140
Income and spends money on this are gonna have better mods or more mods to be able to be more competitive in a PvP scenario

01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:22.960
So, yeah, all right. Well, I can see why people are irritated but we'll see, you know a blizzard an Activision

01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:26.820
I mean, I know blizzards not the makers of destiny 2 it's Bungie, but

01:09:27.460 --> 01:09:33.020
Because there's the PC release and it's on an Activision has been known to throw in loot boxes and shit in the game

01:09:33.020 --> 01:09:39.400
Yes fucking EA started that but um, but I I think they might listen to some of the feedback. We'll see. We'll see

01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:42.520
I mean, I don't think they're gonna do a 180 on the system, but they've been pretty odd

01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:48.840
They won't listen to the feedback because they've already made a comment on it regarding the thing and so their comment was

01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:54.280
Well, no one's complaining about it. It's just you know, it's just

01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:59.160
Appearances and you know, anyways, you're gonna be swimming in those shaders. So it's not a big deal

01:10:00.760 --> 01:10:03.620
That was basically their comment I'm paraphrasing obviously

01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:07.920
But all right, let's move on. All right, so, um

01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:13.120
Blizzard is building their own eSports arena. So, of course, you know

01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:19.240
Starcraft is pretty popular and the eSports realm and of course, you know hearth storm

01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:25.940
and pretty much a lot of their line, you know games overwatch all that so now they're gonna be creating I guess the

01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:31.800
Blizzard arena Los Angeles, which is gonna be located in Burbank Studios

01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:35.360
It's gonna be one of the first arenas in the u.s

01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:41.140
Built specifically with eSports in mind and they're gonna actually open it up not too long from now

01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:47.040
October 7th, and that's gonna launch with the overwatch contender season 1 playoffs

01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:53.280
So, so are we gonna go take a tour go go see something there go see a show

01:10:54.960 --> 01:11:00.680
I'm not driving down there. I'll just take the word for it. We go to Disneyland while we're there. Why not?

01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:03.920
That's cool

01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:05.880
All right

01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:11.960
Moving on virtual tour moving on in news that will surprise. Absolutely. No one and and just Loki

01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:16.280
I already know what you're gonna say. We don't need to relive this every week. All right, but look, here's the thing

01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:21.120
I'm just gonna get it out there. So Nintendo switch. It's selling really well, of course

01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:26.780
We all know that and good old Reggie fisa made me to comment this week in an interview with variety

01:11:27.300 --> 01:11:29.300
Talking about supply for this holiday

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:39.020
Certainly certainly the demand is there and our supply chain is there are we going to have enough for the holiday?

01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:41.240
That's what we're focused on

01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:46.120
Which was said in a way that makes it sound like it could actually be a challenge

01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:48.880
So, yep

01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:55.120
There that you may you may still have a problem getting enough of those on the shelves during the holidays now to be fair

01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:58.360
He didn't come out and say we're gonna have challenges during the holidays

01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:02.840
But the with the phrasing it kind of chose made it sound like he's not ready to guarantee it either

01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:06.880
Well, he's you know preparing people for that inevitability

01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:12.600
I'll be hopeful and hope that they do have enough supply but

01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:15.440
at this point it's like I

01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:18.800
Mean, I can't even be surprised by this. It's like

01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:21.760
like how

01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:24.800
How would you not get this yet? How do you not?

01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:32.720
Coordinate this stuff. Here we go. Here we go. I'm just shocked. I'm not like mad even I'm just like like bewildered

01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:39.200
Like how is it that company can't prepare like this? They you know, this part of the year is coming yet

01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:41.360
Yet somehow

01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:47.920
Well, we just can't do it then. Okay, my god, then maybe I don't know. I don't know what to do. I

01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:54.800
I'm just gonna send Nintendo my thoughts and prayers and see if that's as useful as

01:12:55.200 --> 01:13:01.200
This same thing that they've been pulling for 20 years. I'm just gonna I'm thoughts and prayers for Nintendo. It's like it's holidays

01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:04.040
I mean seriously, it seems intentional at this point

01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:09.120
I mean, they're they're either the most inept company when it comes to supply issues or

01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:11.760
They're doing it on purpose

01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:17.640
I mean because really that's really the only two options that there are right now because like how can you consider?

01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:19.360
consistently

01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:25.280
Not be prepared this many years in a row. I mean how many years has this been going on for?

01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:29.440
several years almost a decade if not more like

01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:37.680
How is it that you're just so ill-prepared for this every it's got to be fucking intentional. It's gotta be at this point

01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:43.960
There's no way that they're this dumb prove. It's not Reggie. It's seriously

01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:48.480
it's like I I don't want to feel if they're like this indicative company that's purposely doing this but

01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:51.320
Like going I don't know

01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:56.960
We'll certainly give it or we'll give it to college. Try. I mean like my god

01:13:57.560 --> 01:13:59.640
Bob coffee giving the fair

01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:04.960
Perspective here in Chad at live dog network comm saying might not be Nintendo's fault in this case

01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:13.000
Switch uses some of the same components smartphones use it's never their fault and with a lot of big smartphones coming out could be actual

01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:15.640
component shortages could it be Satan

01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:27.180
Yes, it's saying in a party like it's 1994 because

01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:31.200
They didn't know that you know

01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:38.240
Every year. I mean, I'm sorry it no, let's not we're not gonna blame other people for Nintendo's fault

01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:41.800
It's it's okay. What component shortages are there?

01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:48.360
They're used by smartphones that fucking super NES classic editions that are using because those have fucking supply problems, too

01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:50.520
That's not we're not gonna blame cell phones for this shit

01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:57.340
What we as they're going in the production again, they all have enough supply to fucking make those SNES classic editions

01:14:57.560 --> 01:14:59.560
What's the excuse there?

01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:04.560
JD in chat says it's the vegans fault

01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:11.200
If Nintendo would just go vegan and tell everybody that Satan so I mean stop it stop

01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:16.080
I know some wonderful vegans in my life. And yes, it was the church lady for

01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:23.500
The timing of you dropping that was was immaculate and caused MXC to say I love this show

01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:27.440
Well, we love you all that turn out every week and listen to know what else I love we do it for you, bro

01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:29.520
what I

01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:35.160
Don't know I don't have a heart I ripped it out and sacrificed it, you know, what else I love what tell me

01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:37.160
I don't know. I

01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:44.720
Love indifference. I love uncertainty. I love not knowing things. I love

01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:51.960
Keeping me. Thank you. Thank you. My keyboard kept my three keyboard cat moon shirt if you've never seen it

01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:58.000
I want to get a moon moon shirt a moo moo moon moon moon the stupid wolf moon moon

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:01.880
Do you do do you know I have an official three wolves crying at the moon shirt?

01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:08.560
Yeah, I have it somewhere in the big laundry pile in the other room the cats probably said I almost wore it to Dragon Con

01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:09.680
That was gonna be one of the outfits

01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:11.680
I was gonna wear one day to Dragon Con but then I was like

01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:17.880
People might think I'm like not I saw your daddy outfit. Did you see? Oh, yeah, we didn't get to talk about that

01:16:17.880 --> 01:16:24.120
My cosplay. Yeah Dragon Con my I didn't even play the game and I knew what it was my lazy fucking cosplay

01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:29.640
Okay, so I did end up bringing two cosplay outfits to Dragon Con both of them were not quite bare enough for that

01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:33.480
So the first one the first one I did was I did Sami Zayn

01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:38.240
Because everybody fucking tells me I look especially Rama's Rama out there Rama

01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:41.320
Rama tells me I look like Sami Zayn and

01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:45.800
Some of my friends in the Bay Area my good buddy Kath who lives in the Bay Area

01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:50.880
She tells me I look like Sami Zayn. So she actually was so far to buy me a shirt

01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:57.000
You know who Sami Zayn is Loki nope, the wrestler a wrestler world World WWE it's because of my hat

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.720
He wears gray cabbie hats like I do and has a red beard

01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:05.600
I don't think you look like him because of that were twinsies. So your nose isn't as big. Oh, thank you

01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:09.780
So anyway, I wore that and I was Sami Zayn for one day

01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:16.080
So but then the next day on Sunday, I did Brian from dream daddy who wears the green Hawaiian shirt

01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:20.240
I had a little pet corgi. They took her out on me. You're not quite that much of a bear

01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:22.480
Well, I'm getting I'm

01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:28.080
I'm not sure. I want Jamie to be like

01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:30.040
gay

01:17:30.040 --> 01:17:35.160
Categorizing me right now on olr. I we're not we're a show of non labels, okay

01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:40.880
You probably need another hundred on you. All right that well, I'm not sure whether to say thank you or not

01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:43.360
But Loki Loki, do you know the difference between a bear and a cub?

01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:49.380
Do you know I'm guessing its size? Yeah, or sometimes age age age, you know

01:17:49.900 --> 01:17:56.060
Bears or bears are big big men Harry usually big hairy men and I've obviously I'm you know

01:17:56.060 --> 01:18:01.500
No, not lacking in that department. But yeah, I'm I'm not big but I got fluff and stuff

01:18:02.140 --> 01:18:06.740
You're still younger gent. Yes, I guess I guess but I'm 39, honey

01:18:07.820 --> 01:18:09.820
At what age do I become a bear?

01:18:10.860 --> 01:18:12.860
70

01:18:14.220 --> 01:18:17.520
JD and chat says one day you'll be a daddy bear

01:18:20.140 --> 01:18:27.020
JD and chat says we ought to move on from this topic stop. He says how about a manther?

01:18:29.260 --> 01:18:33.420
My life heard man sir, but I kind of love it actually

01:18:34.420 --> 01:18:36.180
older gent version of the cougar

01:18:36.180 --> 01:18:41.420
I'm just like thinking of like I'm picturing welcome the orange tar with like, you know, like a panther body

01:18:41.420 --> 01:18:48.340
It's like the dude version of the cougar very fast yet awkward. You're Rob. What you're stiffers mom. What?

01:18:49.140 --> 01:18:55.740
Welcome to orange lounge radio rar. I'm your manthur in charge Rob Roberts now Rob's a furry

01:18:56.700 --> 01:19:02.700
There's nothing there's nothing wrong with furries. There's anything wrong with it. But now we know your fursona. I just you're the manthur

01:19:03.220 --> 01:19:08.420
I said there's nothing wrong first cuz I was about to follow that up with but I'm not a furry, you know. Mm-hmm. Yeah

01:19:09.460 --> 01:19:12.100
You heard it here first Rob's a manthur

01:19:13.260 --> 01:19:15.260
the white manthur I

01:19:16.260 --> 01:19:18.260
Hate everybody

01:19:18.540 --> 01:19:24.020
Well, it's it's really unfortunate that we couldn't make it to 700 but this is the end. Good night everybody

01:19:26.580 --> 01:19:28.580
All right, let's move on

01:19:29.260 --> 01:19:36.100
Dark soccer once tell us about another game a game that I am happy about and have been fucking waiting for two years for

01:19:36.860 --> 01:19:40.020
Do you hear me? What pumpkin man versus manthur? Oh

01:19:41.140 --> 01:19:43.140
Goddamn, I'm never gonna let that go now

01:19:44.100 --> 01:19:49.400
Who's who said that it's a stoppie stoppie stoppie should a trademark patent pending that shit

01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:52.780
And he we'd have to owe him a quarter every time we said it, but he didn't huh?

01:19:53.340 --> 01:19:55.100
so I

01:19:55.100 --> 01:19:57.940
Love my home stuck. I still love home stuck

01:19:57.940 --> 01:19:59.940
I have gone back and reread part of home stuck

01:19:59.940 --> 01:20:05.500
Even though it's like a rabbit hole that you can never get out of it's like a singularity of the Internet

01:20:06.860 --> 01:20:09.500
Well, we have a release date for hive swap

01:20:10.460 --> 01:20:15.420
Which is the game that was funded with like two million dollars on Kickstarter and

01:20:17.860 --> 01:20:20.580
So it is going to be a point-and-click

01:20:21.180 --> 01:20:26.700
Kind of adventure game that will not yell at you if you try to do these items will work together

01:20:27.620 --> 01:20:32.440
It has like a bajillion responses for many different things. You could do combinations of stuff

01:20:32.440 --> 01:20:38.540
So it's be really neat, but it's going to be out on September 14th. I am going to be playing the shit out of this game

01:20:39.100 --> 01:20:46.300
The music though is done by Toby Fox as an undertale who also did do stuff for

01:20:46.940 --> 01:20:49.260
Homestuck, so this is gonna be

01:20:50.060 --> 01:20:55.480
Megalovania came from Homestuck. So this is basically gonna be like the capital of meme. Yes

01:20:56.340 --> 01:21:00.380
okay, but you can play as a

01:21:02.340 --> 01:21:04.340
Couple of different characters in

01:21:04.740 --> 01:21:05.940
the

01:21:05.940 --> 01:21:10.180
The first part actually with the part one that comes out you play as Joey Claire

01:21:10.900 --> 01:21:14.060
Who is a teen girl trapped in her room in?

01:21:15.020 --> 01:21:22.020
1994 or as Jude Harley who is her bizarre who is her kid brother trapped in his treehouse

01:21:22.700 --> 01:21:24.700
Or you can play as a couple of trolls

01:21:25.460 --> 01:21:29.200
But what happens basically they get switched from planet to planet

01:21:29.740 --> 01:21:31.740
so she goes to

01:21:32.140 --> 01:21:34.140
Alternia which is the troll planet and

01:21:34.780 --> 01:21:36.780
Troll boys come to earth

01:21:37.620 --> 01:21:42.940
There you go and much fanfic was written and there was much wank and Faye go to being drunk

01:21:44.300 --> 01:21:46.300
and and

01:21:46.300 --> 01:21:48.380
Juggalos taking over the government

01:21:49.380 --> 01:21:53.260
You know a bunch of people lost their shit because the whole juggalo March

01:21:54.060 --> 01:21:59.260
Happening at the same time in Washington DC is some drunk bullshit. Yeah, I heard yeah and

01:21:59.940 --> 01:22:04.720
But there were a lot of homestucks that were like, oh it happened in the comics it's happening for real man

01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:07.600
Cuz it did cuz juggalos took over the government

01:22:09.900 --> 01:22:11.540
Whatever I

01:22:11.540 --> 01:22:14.420
Have a reason to bust out the Ben Nye again

01:22:14.420 --> 01:22:19.700
JD and chat says fanfic and wank are two sides of the same coin. That is that is correct

01:22:20.660 --> 01:22:22.120
All right

01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:27.740
Anyhow, I might be making scale mates again. Just a few more stories for you guys in the classic game of the week Loki

01:22:28.580 --> 01:22:32.060
So there's been a lot of issues with Shadow of War

01:22:32.900 --> 01:22:35.340
The new Lord of the Rings game that's gonna be coming out

01:22:36.020 --> 01:22:38.020
pretty shortly

01:22:38.160 --> 01:22:41.940
so one of that has to do well with this kind of

01:22:43.020 --> 01:22:46.340
commemoration of one of the producers on the game

01:22:47.260 --> 01:22:50.140
executive producer Michael forgery and

01:22:51.420 --> 01:22:52.780
he

01:22:52.780 --> 01:22:54.780
Our 4g I guess is

01:22:55.380 --> 01:23:03.420
Anyways, he apparently died of cancer on March 3rd. And so with that they were going to do this kind of

01:23:05.540 --> 01:23:12.560
Memorialize them as a character in the game. So there is gonna be a character called fourth hog orc Slayer

01:23:13.500 --> 01:23:16.860
who kind of be like the like in fallout they have the

01:23:17.860 --> 01:23:22.620
The mysterious stranger that appears randomly and will kill your enemies for you

01:23:22.780 --> 01:23:28.060
so he would kind of appear and you know kill an orc for you or something in the game and

01:23:28.900 --> 01:23:32.420
It was gonna be offered as DLC at launch

01:23:33.620 --> 01:23:35.620
now in

01:23:35.980 --> 01:23:40.500
Most scenarios you would assume that okay. This is gonna be some free DLC

01:23:40.500 --> 01:23:43.760
This is kind of a way that they're you know honoring their

01:23:44.620 --> 01:23:46.380
new fellow

01:23:46.380 --> 01:23:49.460
You know employee and stuff friend or whatever

01:23:50.500 --> 01:23:56.660
But then they decided that they're gonna charge $4.99 for the DLC because this is fucking Warner Brothers, but hey

01:23:56.660 --> 01:23:58.660
That's alright because we're gonna be donating

01:23:59.820 --> 01:24:01.220
$3.50 of that

01:24:01.220 --> 01:24:08.180
$4.99 to the family which to be fair not unheard of because like blizzard has done pets for Wow that are

01:24:08.380 --> 01:24:10.380
5050 for like make a wish or something like that

01:24:10.500 --> 01:24:15.880
Wasn't the first time something like that's been done and my assumption is that 350 is probably the cut they get

01:24:16.280 --> 01:24:20.660
After right the stores take their cut right so that that's fine to be fair. That's fine

01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:22.840
however

01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:29.300
There's fine print here as with a lot of things so the fine print that came under fire is well

01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:35.440
It's only valid actually in the United States so except for Alabama, Hawaii, Illinois

01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:38.080
Massachusetts, Mississippi and South Carolina

01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:42.720
Because apparently they have laws regarding fundraising and that type of thing

01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:45.320
and

01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:49.600
This DLC is not being sold just in the u.s.. It's being sold worldwide so

01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:55.920
They didn't come out and say that oh, we're gonna donate all the proceeds from like worldwide sales

01:24:55.920 --> 01:25:01.520
It's only for the sales that are in the US in these states that are not listed on this fine print

01:25:01.880 --> 01:25:06.400
So in a sense they are profiting from a dead person

01:25:07.620 --> 01:25:11.380
Okay, but didn't they come out on Twitter and say that's not like that

01:25:11.380 --> 01:25:14.300
They are not making any money off of this they said neither

01:25:14.820 --> 01:25:22.940
Warner Brothers interactive nor monolith will profit from any sales of Fort Hogg the orc slayer DLC regardless of the territory in which the

01:25:22.940 --> 01:25:28.020
DLC is sold so why can't we take that at face value? Why are we saying? Oh, they're profiting off?

01:25:28.020 --> 01:25:31.940
Why can't we just say okay? They can't advertise in these states because and

01:25:32.780 --> 01:25:33.900
You can't yes

01:25:33.900 --> 01:25:37.860
It is based off a law and I was when I saw this original story

01:25:37.900 --> 01:25:41.140
I was I was kind of floored that the law was not referenced in the story

01:25:41.260 --> 01:25:47.540
But there is it's not hard to Google you just Google those state names and charity law and there is a charity law that says

01:25:48.140 --> 01:25:52.880
Some states require what's called a CCV which is this whole split basically?

01:25:53.660 --> 01:25:57.500
Raising to register with the state Alabama, Massachusetts

01:25:57.780 --> 01:26:03.740
Specifically require bonds in the amounts of ten thousand dollars and twenty five thousand dollars respectively so in Massachusetts

01:26:03.740 --> 01:26:06.420
They would have to post a bond for twenty five thousand dollars to even do this fundraiser

01:26:06.420 --> 01:26:13.180
Well, they just do it in the way that we're gonna match the we're gonna match the sales of these DLCs in donation

01:26:13.180 --> 01:26:17.260
That way it's not tied to it. It's just them independently doing it

01:26:18.060 --> 01:26:23.060
You know and then they can do that with any state that would have been a way to get around that I would think or

01:26:23.060 --> 01:26:29.340
Just just they're gonna donate the money anyway wink wink nudge nudge. They just can't advertise it in these states

01:26:29.340 --> 01:26:32.660
They're doing what they're doing in these states keep themselves in the clear legally

01:26:33.500 --> 01:26:37.660
How much is not fucking charged for in the first place and just open up hey

01:26:38.340 --> 01:26:42.940
Well, we want to you know, we want to do something for this guy. We've opened up, you know

01:26:43.780 --> 01:26:48.260
It go fund me or something like that. You guys can donate to that. I again

01:26:48.860 --> 01:26:54.320
They've the idea of charity fundraisers and games through sales has kind of been done

01:26:54.380 --> 01:26:59.340
Like I said in Warcraft and there's other MMOs never been like controversial like this

01:26:59.340 --> 01:27:03.820
So that's the thing and I'll tell you actually actually I'm sorry but in Blizzard

01:27:03.820 --> 01:27:07.460
Yeah, because some people were like why only 50% going to make a wish

01:27:08.260 --> 01:27:12.380
Why why is Blizzard keeping the or Activision or whatever keeping the other 50%?

01:27:12.380 --> 01:27:16.340
So, I mean there it wasn't paying their designers and programmers, you know

01:27:16.340 --> 01:27:20.180
Well, it's the same with like humble bundle only a portion of that goes to these charities

01:27:20.180 --> 01:27:23.020
All right, I mean, I guess you could set it to be like the full thing

01:27:23.020 --> 01:27:28.900
but now granted there is also a difference between just general charity like in the sense of

01:27:29.340 --> 01:27:33.980
Make-a-wish or whatever. This is money that they weren't quote-unquote expecting or relying on or anything

01:27:33.980 --> 01:27:36.460
I think this is like it is literally a charitable donation

01:27:36.460 --> 01:27:42.520
But in this other case, like you said you have somebody who's passed that it might kind of I don't want to say

01:27:42.580 --> 01:27:47.180
Put a damper on the person's memory, but I think that's kind of the well conclusion

01:27:47.180 --> 01:27:50.820
I think you also here's the other reason why it's kind of skewing against them is because

01:27:50.900 --> 01:27:57.380
This is a game that everybody was looking forward to and then before this whole announcement because this is like the third announcement

01:27:58.020 --> 01:27:59.340
That they've made

01:27:59.340 --> 01:28:04.780
Regarding this game. The first one was oh, hey, by the way, you know that great single-player game that you have

01:28:05.300 --> 01:28:11.940
We're fucking put in loot boxes bitches. We're fucking put in loot boxes. And guess what? It's not just cosmetic shit

01:28:11.940 --> 01:28:18.500
It's fucking orcs and stuff stuff that you can get the aim basically pay the win. Oh, but don't worry

01:28:18.500 --> 01:28:20.660
It's not really pay the win because it's a single-player game

01:28:20.660 --> 01:28:26.220
Oh, but we got a multiplayer portion as well that you can use all this shit that you unlocked in your loot boxes

01:28:26.260 --> 01:28:30.420
And it's fucking like the whole meld your solid thing where they had, you know

01:28:30.420 --> 01:28:36.540
The bases that you would basically would be online and if they got attacked you could lose some of this stuff

01:28:36.540 --> 01:28:42.740
So it's basically this churning cycle of bullshit because they're fucking loot boxes. Once again a loot box

01:28:42.740 --> 01:28:43.720
They didn't need to be in a game

01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:49.180
Oh then by the way, we're gonna do also a fucking you know thing with Totino's pizza rolls because sure

01:28:49.380 --> 01:28:52.940
let's just do that and you can get codes and unlock shit and

01:28:53.940 --> 01:29:01.140
It's so it's all that greedy shit up front that's been in the headlines for the last few weeks and then this is like the

01:29:01.140 --> 01:29:02.260
fucking

01:29:02.260 --> 01:29:04.700
you know the end of it they announce this shit and it's like

01:29:05.540 --> 01:29:06.580
Really?

01:29:06.580 --> 01:29:11.940
You know, I mean you're charging for it. What the fuck? I mean, it's just it's a big mess

01:29:11.940 --> 01:29:17.860
I think there's better ways they could have done it and it doesn't help that this bullshit about their whole

01:29:18.020 --> 01:29:22.340
Blue box and DLC shit came out wait before all this happened

01:29:22.340 --> 01:29:26.660
Okay, you know you're getting some comments and chat over at live dog network calm stop

01:29:26.660 --> 01:29:30.380
He says in that case with what you're saying. Why do we need the DLC at all?

01:29:30.380 --> 01:29:36.900
Why can't gamers be generous to someone without expecting DLC in return? Exactly. I don't think they do you need to just say

01:29:37.500 --> 01:29:40.860
Say hey, you know what? We feel bad for this guy and his family

01:29:40.860 --> 01:29:46.500
We want to help out if you want to help out, you know, you you enjoy this game, you know think about you know

01:29:46.860 --> 01:29:53.760
Donating to you know his family with through this thing. This is how you can donate they get it done after a blog post done

01:29:54.380 --> 01:29:57.860
There's nothing that they need to do and then later on if they wanted to you know

01:29:57.860 --> 01:30:01.820
Because we really love this guy. We want to memorialize them, you know, we can put them in the game

01:30:01.820 --> 01:30:04.820
Like for example all those people that like played, you know in

01:30:05.380 --> 01:30:11.340
World of Warcraft and stuff that were hardcore of that and there's a few that died and became characters in the game

01:30:11.340 --> 01:30:16.340
They have fucking charge for DLC for that character. It was just something that they put in the game

01:30:16.380 --> 01:30:19.220
A lot of them are NPCs and statues exactly

01:30:19.220 --> 01:30:20.620
They're just NPCs or something

01:30:20.620 --> 01:30:26.620
like why did it have to be this big old playable character thing that you invested money on just like

01:30:27.140 --> 01:30:31.180
Why can't you do something nice to be nice instead of fucking charging for it?

01:30:31.300 --> 01:30:35.860
like I get I can will assume that your intentions were noble, but

01:30:37.100 --> 01:30:43.780
It just doesn't look good after you know, you're asking people to pay for money that shit was free before I just I

01:30:44.780 --> 01:30:47.460
Don't know it's not it just doesn't look good

01:30:48.660 --> 01:30:55.100
Bobby Blackwell and Chad says I probably wouldn't have donated straight like that for someone I never met but I probably would buy DLC like

01:30:55.100 --> 01:31:00.140
This so, you know another perspective. All right anyway in the interest of time. I'm gonna go ahead and move on

01:31:00.620 --> 01:31:05.100
Because we're already how far into the show are we like an hour and a half into the show and I already know a part

01:31:05.100 --> 01:31:09.340
A so in the interest of time, I'm gonna move on and I want to talk quickly about this one more here

01:31:09.340 --> 01:31:17.080
Another story that was submitted from our discord server about the Nintendo Wii. Yes that system from 2006

01:31:17.820 --> 01:31:23.660
Apparently has infringed a Dallas inventors patent and a jury has awarded

01:31:24.620 --> 01:31:28.720
10.1 million to this Dallas medical motion detection company

01:31:28.720 --> 01:31:33.380
I life is the name of the company who sued Nintendo in 2013 after they filed lawsuits

01:31:33.820 --> 01:31:40.580
In 2012 against four other companies it did go to trial in Dallas and the verdict found that Nintendo did infringe on the patent

01:31:40.580 --> 01:31:42.580
first filed in 1999

01:31:42.580 --> 01:31:46.300
describing systems and methods for evaluating movement of a body

01:31:46.820 --> 01:31:54.380
Relative to an environment this 10.1 million was less than 10% of what I life's attorneys were asking for

01:31:54.380 --> 01:31:56.460
They wanted a hundred and forty four million

01:31:56.460 --> 01:31:59.940
That was how much the lawsuit was basically for at this point

01:31:59.980 --> 01:32:04.620
And of course Nintendo has said it will appeal the verdict the company told

01:32:06.300 --> 01:32:08.900
Glixel which is the Rolling Stones video game arm

01:32:09.380 --> 01:32:15.140
Nintendo disagrees with the decision as Nintendo does not infringe I life's patent and the patent is invalid

01:32:15.300 --> 01:32:18.740
Nintendo looks forward to raising those issues with the district court and with the court of appeals

01:32:18.980 --> 01:32:21.380
So don't expect Nintendo to write a check just yet

01:32:21.380 --> 01:32:27.840
But it is sure fascinated that this system came out over ten years ago. And here we are still arguing over patents

01:32:27.880 --> 01:32:29.400
I don't know the details of that patent

01:32:29.400 --> 01:32:33.920
but just sounding like it sounds like one of those patent roll pan patents that they have, you know, just I

01:32:34.560 --> 01:32:39.160
Don't know it to me and I know like in Texas. There's a there's a certain districts in there

01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:43.700
I'm not I don't think this is one of them that a lot of these patent troll cases go to yeah

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.120
Sounds it sounds fishy, but

01:32:48.760 --> 01:32:54.800
Whatever they're gonna write it out until they get you know, they've got more money than this dude does I'm sure so yep

01:32:54.960 --> 01:32:58.000
Just bleed them dry they'll write it out

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:04.240
And I think it's just more goes to show that and if it wasn't that case we would have had enough switches for holiday

01:33:04.800 --> 01:33:06.560
God, damn it

01:33:06.560 --> 01:33:10.820
Yeah, it's technically that technology existed in the Wii U is too as well didn't it? So

01:33:12.240 --> 01:33:16.600
Anyway, let's go back to a simpler time when patent trolls didn't exist

01:33:18.100 --> 01:33:23.780
Okay, maybe they did but I just like to think they didn't it's a simpler time when dark soccer is gonna walk into the gaming

01:33:23.780 --> 01:33:25.900
Vault and find a game that she thinks hey

01:33:26.580 --> 01:33:30.180
you little brats stop swinging your Wii around and

01:33:31.040 --> 01:33:35.420
Come play this game. Hey come into the sewer grate over here. I got a game for you to play

01:33:36.020 --> 01:33:40.660
It's the classic game of the week dark soccer. Oh, what is the classic game of the week this week?

01:33:41.300 --> 01:33:47.660
Excalibur 2097 the whole reason I picked this is because I went on like a 90s music rampage

01:33:47.660 --> 01:33:49.660
It was listening to a lot of psychosonic

01:33:50.660 --> 01:33:56.300
Which I loved psychosonic a whole lot when I was in early college and

01:33:56.680 --> 01:34:04.220
They did the soundtrack for the American version of this game. So in Japan, it was called sword maniac had a completely different soundtrack

01:34:05.220 --> 01:34:12.820
But in the u.s. It was called Excalibur 2097 had kind of a different story and the soundtrack was done by psychosonic

01:34:13.620 --> 01:34:18.740
Which if anyone bothered with anything about Mortal Kombat Annihilation

01:34:19.100 --> 01:34:22.180
They were one of the artists from that soundtrack

01:34:24.340 --> 01:34:31.020
Really just dance the electronic music really good stuff. Let me turn this up a little bit just for our listeners to hear

01:34:36.980 --> 01:34:39.820
This is actually the version of welcome to my mind

01:34:43.060 --> 01:34:45.060
Awesome anyway

01:34:46.260 --> 01:34:49.780
The game is also fairly interesting

01:34:51.580 --> 01:34:56.740
Basically you've got a big ton of different characters that are in this but it is

01:34:58.820 --> 01:35:06.680
It's notable for being a side-scrolling adventure game where at the same time though

01:35:07.320 --> 01:35:09.000
You

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:13.800
Had your boss fights kind of turn it into a fighting game. It was pretty interesting

01:35:14.920 --> 01:35:21.240
But really I mean the biggest thing is notable is that either there was this involvement with a major with a major

01:35:23.440 --> 01:35:25.440
Band I should say at the time

01:35:27.480 --> 01:35:35.040
You feeling okay over there yeah, I am I'm trying to find something because one of my links I forgot to send you oh

01:35:36.940 --> 01:35:38.940
But it's okay a

01:35:40.840 --> 01:35:46.140
Couple of the things about it is that the art style in it was pretty dark

01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:50.540
But you had all kinds of just neat different characters

01:35:50.540 --> 01:35:57.480
You could you would pick up along the way, but you started off playing in the American version this someone named slash

01:35:58.280 --> 01:35:59.960
who basically

01:35:59.960 --> 01:36:04.680
went around to make peace and order of the world with his sword and

01:36:04.680 --> 01:36:06.240
And

01:36:06.240 --> 01:36:07.680
then

01:36:07.680 --> 01:36:12.280
You also could pick well. There's also like you rescued his

01:36:13.240 --> 01:36:17.480
partner Alex who was taken hostage and she then

01:36:17.880 --> 01:36:24.700
Like gets possessed and all kinds of stuff and there's all kinds of you know different characters in there you have to beat so

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
It was a pretty neat game

01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:34.280
You know fairly average for side-scrolling, but I think it was the soundtrack that was the most notable thing about it, so there you go

01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:38.880
All right there. It is your classic game of the week Excalibur

01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:43.480
2097 known as sword me sword mani sword mania X

01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:49.760
Mania X just kidding, but that's what it was called over in Japan play sword mania X

01:36:49.840 --> 01:36:56.680
You know what's funny is that in YouTube on that audio YouTube recommends the killer instinct theme as a related video

01:36:56.680 --> 01:37:00.640
And it's kind of because I actually kind of hear that whole like killer in so if you want to play just a few

01:37:00.760 --> 01:37:02.760
Seconds though of what the song came from

01:37:03.520 --> 01:37:06.400
Although if people listen to the show all the way through they'll

01:37:07.120 --> 01:37:11.480
Yes, I can hear it play a little bit of what inspired that here. Let's listen to oh

01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:22.560
My god ultimate dance party right there on the night

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:30.800
Well that's not killer instinct, but yeah, it's still still that was that was like

01:37:31.360 --> 01:37:36.440
1994 for me that's like the original song of what we heard in the other game, so yeah the Excalibur

01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:40.800
Yeah, all right, so so there you go sweet all right there. It is your classic

01:37:41.640 --> 01:37:47.560
Okay, game, but hey it's that whole era of cyberpunk game cyberpunk games, so I got you

01:37:47.560 --> 01:37:48.720

01:39:55.420 --> 01:39:59.800
Do I still have my special report break music? I think I have it here

01:39:59.800 --> 01:40:03.640
Let me see if we have our special report breaking news theme while news is shattering

01:40:04.280 --> 01:40:06.280
Yes

01:40:06.440 --> 01:40:08.440
a

01:40:08.880 --> 01:40:15.800
Breaking news on this Sunday just a few hours before we went live here at orange lounge radio a

01:40:16.640 --> 01:40:22.340
Incredibly popular youtuber who has over millions and millions of subscribers on YouTube

01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:26.380
He dropped the n-word while using a stream dot while doing a stream today

01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:35.320
His name is it Matt it's like p.u. I'm eating a pie or something like that. Oh, so

01:40:36.440 --> 01:40:41.480
Not the first time that man's mouth's gotten him into a little bit of trouble and you know

01:40:42.920 --> 01:40:48.800
Didn't even really apologize for it like the moment that it happened because it just man

01:40:48.800 --> 01:40:53.720
I debated if I should play the clip or not, and I'm not gonna because I don't want to promote this person but

01:40:54.800 --> 01:41:00.760
Just the way that that word just kind of just fell out of that guy's mouth when it really probably shouldn't be a part of

01:41:00.760 --> 01:41:05.040
his vocabulary is a little bit worrisome, especially with as many followers as he has and

01:41:06.040 --> 01:41:10.880
You know that people learn that behavior from somewhere, and you know what he's doing um

01:41:12.480 --> 01:41:14.440
And the way he kind of played it off

01:41:14.440 --> 01:41:19.120
He kind of did a little oh, sorry you know kind of like under his breath or whatever is kind of well

01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:25.460
It's kind of crap. Let's be real and again not the first time this guy has done something so I would also

01:41:25.920 --> 01:41:29.120
Like to know why do we keep making stupid people famous?

01:41:29.240 --> 01:41:34.080
You know what what is it about our culture that we keep because unfortunately this guy's

01:41:34.840 --> 01:41:39.000
Name was trending on Twitter after the incident which I yes

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:40.960
I realized a lot of it was negative and so forth

01:41:40.960 --> 01:41:45.960
But it's like it's just so irritating to me because there's so many hard-working independent streamers

01:41:45.960 --> 01:41:51.440
And I'm not not even myself like I'm I'm fortunate to have more followers than some other people out there

01:41:51.440 --> 01:41:53.440
we're probably better at it than I am and

01:41:54.160 --> 01:41:59.880
And yet these people aren't the ones getting recognition. It's guys like this guy that are so

01:42:00.520 --> 01:42:05.100
I don't know when this guy's gonna get cancelled, but it didn't happen the last time

01:42:05.100 --> 01:42:08.440
I doubt it's gonna happen this time either. I don't know stop watching him

01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:12.800
I don't like the way he talks. I mean that that's what I wish people would stop doing

01:42:13.540 --> 01:42:18.840
Let's see Bob coffee and chat says shocking news racist little shit is a racist little shit mmm

01:42:19.880 --> 01:42:23.140
Kai's you don't chat says he did that before and got in trouble

01:42:23.800 --> 01:42:25.800
Yep, all right

01:42:26.480 --> 01:42:28.480
anyway

01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:31.000
Let's move on that was some late-breaking news

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:36.360
Let's do some rapid-fire news and hopefully something a little more positive right Loki. Yeah, so this week

01:42:36.360 --> 01:42:40.720
They made an announcement regarding LA noir, which is like what?

01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:47.680
Rocks are what so LA noir is being remastered for the Nintendo switch

01:42:48.740 --> 01:42:54.680
PlayStation 4 and VR and it's not just one game, but actually three different games

01:42:55.040 --> 01:43:00.280
So LA noir the VR case files will be coming to the HTC vive and

01:43:01.080 --> 01:43:03.080
apparently it's gonna be

01:43:03.200 --> 01:43:09.340
Seven of the original cases from the LA noir game, and then they've of course adapted those for VR

01:43:09.840 --> 01:43:16.480
LA noir is gonna be coming to the switch with unique game features all additional content

01:43:17.080 --> 01:43:22.040
Joycon mode with gyroscopic and gesture based controls and in rumble and all that fun stuff

01:43:22.040 --> 01:43:24.940
And of course LA noir for PlayStation 4 and Xbox one

01:43:25.080 --> 01:43:30.680
It's gonna be remastered there have 4k for the PlayStation 4 Pro and Xbox 1x

01:43:30.920 --> 01:43:34.220
And yeah, and that's gonna be coming out

01:43:34.920 --> 01:43:38.880
Later, although I don't think they have a date on that yet. I never 14

01:43:38.880 --> 01:43:43.520
I guess it's neat that it's coming to switch but that game's kind of old old blank

01:43:43.520 --> 01:43:46.800
I I hope that's not some freakin benchmark for

01:43:47.480 --> 01:43:52.760
Rockstar on how they can do on the switch because this isn't exactly the greatest litmus test to my well

01:43:52.760 --> 01:43:56.640
It's it's an okay title. Like it wasn't one I ever got into

01:43:57.240 --> 01:43:58.600
I

01:43:58.600 --> 01:44:03.640
Don't know. It's not as action-packed as like say a Red Dead Redemption or Grand Theft Auto

01:44:03.960 --> 01:44:09.320
It would be cool to see like a Grand Theft Auto 4 remaster or something like that come to the switch

01:44:09.320 --> 01:44:11.600
But yes, I think that's asking a little too much

01:44:12.400 --> 01:44:19.160
With those with that data problem that they're having fitting all that content on to you know cartridge

01:44:20.800 --> 01:44:25.200
Why don't they just do multiple cartridges, you know, like back in the room you probably have to switch back and forth

01:44:25.200 --> 01:44:28.900
It probably won't look so well expensive. Yeah, maybe I don't know what else Loki

01:44:29.360 --> 01:44:35.820
And then of course, I'm speaking of more remasters. This is more of a rumored port, but you know

01:44:36.580 --> 01:44:39.820
Bayonetta and Vanquish were just remastered on PC

01:44:39.820 --> 01:44:47.760
Well, the rumors are that it's gonna be coming to PlayStation 4 and Xbox one as well. So they haven't announced it yet, but

01:44:48.740 --> 01:44:54.360
Soon apparently there are some retail listings that have appeared for it. Oh my god, Loki

01:44:54.360 --> 01:45:00.220
Does this mean Bayonetta 2 and and here's the best part about it. It's a 2-pack. So it's actually gonna be both games together

01:45:00.980 --> 01:45:02.720
For 60 bucks. No, I'm just kidding

01:45:02.720 --> 01:45:06.120
We don't know we don't know how much yet, but probably probably not that much but there's rock start

01:45:06.120 --> 01:45:11.980
So I think Bayonetta on Steam is only what was it 15 bucks 20 bucks. It wasn't it wasn't 30

01:45:12.320 --> 01:45:14.680
Yeah, so right now it's as expected in

01:45:15.320 --> 01:45:18.400
2017 but I don't know it's

01:45:19.960 --> 01:45:26.240
It'd be interesting to see what happens with that and although I joke with Loki don't expect Bayonetta 2 again Nintendo

01:45:26.520 --> 01:45:30.120
You know, they may they may have a time thing on it

01:45:30.120 --> 01:45:31.960
Like it may be like after five years

01:45:31.960 --> 01:45:37.920
But I would assume that five years is the minimum on that sort of agreement when did Bayonetta 2 come out was it?

01:45:38.960 --> 01:45:42.040
2015 at this point, so it's gonna see still got a few more years to wait

01:45:42.800 --> 01:45:46.120
Before something like that would happen. So anyway

01:45:46.680 --> 01:45:52.920
Moving on a story that you heard referenced in our introduction that actually also came from discord this week

01:45:52.920 --> 01:45:57.560
Thanks to you folks that use our discord over a vog network comm slash discord

01:45:57.560 --> 01:46:04.900
But apparently a new newly updated official Japanese language profile about Mario

01:46:05.720 --> 01:46:09.960
Has made it clear that he's retired from the world of plumbing. He is no longer a plumber

01:46:10.880 --> 01:46:16.720
The profile explains all-around sporty whether it's tennis or baseball soccer or car racing

01:46:16.760 --> 01:46:19.560
He does everything cool as a matter of fact

01:46:19.560 --> 01:46:23.400
He also seems to have worked as a plumber a long time ago

01:46:23.400 --> 01:46:29.400
Hence the past tense of worked now if you want to get technical back when Mario was known as jump man

01:46:29.520 --> 01:46:32.780
When he was in Donkey Kong, he was a carpenter in that game

01:46:32.780 --> 01:46:36.440
But you know, I know a lot of people that have worked several different types of jobs in their lives

01:46:36.640 --> 01:46:39.240
But it seems like Mario has retired from the world of plumbing

01:46:39.600 --> 01:46:45.920
My assumption would be that after all the times that he's rescued Princess Peach when you know, she's not helping herself out

01:46:46.440 --> 01:46:48.960
That she must be a sugar mama or something, right?

01:46:48.960 --> 01:46:56.480
He's got he's got he's getting some of that castle money some of that Mushroom Kingdom coin that happening. No. Yeah. All right

01:46:56.480 --> 01:46:59.320
I mean got it. It's easy to make the joke that he's

01:47:00.920 --> 01:47:02.920
Plumbed the princess but no

01:47:04.440 --> 01:47:06.440
Who cares I mean

01:47:07.440 --> 01:47:11.840
It's a really good question who fucking cares fucking cares. I mean, it's like I

01:47:12.600 --> 01:47:18.440
Do Loki I need the background for my fan. I can't enjoy this if I know that he's a plumber

01:47:18.520 --> 01:47:21.720
I don't like thing. So why he did play, you know

01:47:22.360 --> 01:47:28.080
He'll be he'll who gives a shit who gives a shit when his fucking

01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:34.360
Occupations because it never is once played into the game aside from the fact that he's in pipes and sewers and Jake

01:47:34.360 --> 01:47:41.520
He's a pipe and the movie Loki the movie a pipe in overall enthusiasts. Okay, he just likes that sort of shit

01:47:42.040 --> 01:47:45.040
He's an urban explorer. Let's make him like all

01:47:46.040 --> 01:47:53.920
Dark Sakura has your world been turned upside down by the news that Mario is no longer a plumber whoopty shit

01:47:56.440 --> 01:48:02.760
Brad from pod culture in our chat who by the way also celebrating a birthday today. So happy birthday, buddy Brad from bog cod

01:48:03.440 --> 01:48:11.240
Blah blah blah, maybe I could pronounce the fucking name on his birthday Brad from pod culture says Mario has laid enough pipe

01:48:11.600 --> 01:48:12.480
You

01:48:12.480 --> 01:48:17.840
Know Mario is huh? He's a fucking cold-hearted murderer is what he is because he just wow

01:48:18.360 --> 01:48:23.240
Indiscriminately kills all sorts of creatures in the Mushroom Kingdom and he trapped that poor gorilla

01:48:24.320 --> 01:48:28.840
And tried to electrocute his child. I mean, he's a fucking sociopath

01:48:28.840 --> 01:48:33.000
So that is what he fucking is Mario Mars a fucking asshole

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:37.760
Oh, but we don't pay attention to all the death and murder. It's what is his occupation?

01:48:37.760 --> 01:48:42.840
I know that death death and murder is fine as long as he doesn't have sex better yet

01:48:42.840 --> 01:48:48.160
Since this came from Japan did his blood type change too? Because that is very important information. I need to know his blood type

01:48:48.160 --> 01:48:50.160
I need to know it

01:48:51.480 --> 01:48:57.280
Orange right in chat says he caused that turtle to bounce between those two pipes for eternity

01:48:57.280 --> 01:49:01.700
What about Luigi? Is he a plumber or is he now a ghost hunter because you know

01:49:02.220 --> 01:49:06.700
One of those a legitimate job one is not a legitimate job. I

01:49:07.420 --> 01:49:09.420
Mean, what's Luigi?

01:49:10.220 --> 01:49:17.060
Wow, everybody everybody in chat just fucking let it out when it comes to Mario fifth dream says he has a shitty mustache

01:49:17.580 --> 01:49:20.220
What about Waluigi and Wario?

01:49:20.220 --> 01:49:25.860
There's all these people that are not plumbers, but it sure is a hell a lot of fucking overalls and shit going on

01:49:26.580 --> 01:49:30.420
Maybe that's just the fashion in the mushroom. So if he's not a plumber

01:49:30.420 --> 01:49:33.340
Then he's just a guy that likes swimming in the fucking sewer

01:49:33.380 --> 01:49:38.000
He just loves diving down pipes of shit and jumping around the sewer

01:49:39.580 --> 01:49:41.580
And none of this makes any sense anymore

01:49:42.180 --> 01:49:44.980
Who thought it would be a good I mean, okay

01:49:45.100 --> 01:49:51.180
So I get it that he's not plumber now because honestly the guy's been taking quite the vacation from his job

01:49:51.180 --> 01:49:57.300
So that may probably got fired. He's like, well, he isn't he he's been missing for fucking decades now

01:49:57.300 --> 01:49:59.300
I'm assuming the guy's dead

01:49:59.340 --> 01:50:00.780
probably on a

01:50:00.780 --> 01:50:02.820
Meth binge or something like that. Who knows?

01:50:04.340 --> 01:50:06.340
Moving on

01:50:06.540 --> 01:50:12.740
Speaking of Mario shroom head just despite all your fucking issues with Mario. Everybody's suddenly venting

01:50:12.740 --> 01:50:18.020
Yeah, I always hated that guy. Fuck Mario. Everybody's just coming out and airing their grievances with Mario

01:50:18.460 --> 01:50:21.940
I know you're all still excited about Mario Odyssey. Don't fucking lie

01:50:22.420 --> 01:50:25.260
Mario Odyssey is coming out of course on the switch in October and

01:50:25.740 --> 01:50:30.260
some more information has come out including I guess the box art is out there now and

01:50:30.780 --> 01:50:33.700
Also some new kingdoms have been announced in the game

01:50:33.700 --> 01:50:38.700
so there's a video floating around there on the internet and you can check out some of the new kingdoms in the game as

01:50:38.700 --> 01:50:42.540
Well as a brand new move called the hip drop jump. That's right

01:50:42.540 --> 01:50:45.500
You jump in the air after doing a ground pound

01:50:45.500 --> 01:50:49.600
So you use the momentum you get from the ground pound to jump a little bit higher

01:50:49.600 --> 01:50:53.940
The princess is very familiar with this move the hip the hip drop jump

01:50:54.540 --> 01:50:57.180
After you do a ground pound you gotta jump over here

01:51:00.700 --> 01:51:07.980
Dar Sakura save me fucking porn star now man with all those kind of moves save me from this discussion. How about balls? No

01:51:10.420 --> 01:51:12.220
Pinball fx3

01:51:12.220 --> 01:51:19.380
Is getting a release date. Whoo. It'll be out on September 26 for our PlayStation 4 Xbox one and PC and

01:51:20.100 --> 01:51:22.100
comes with the Universal Classics

01:51:22.460 --> 01:51:25.700
Set jaws back to the future and et

01:51:26.420 --> 01:51:27.980
Yay

01:51:27.980 --> 01:51:30.300
I can play pinball at home for real

01:51:30.740 --> 01:51:36.560
Yeah, but I like these I still like these RK because I think that's the new thing right 4k

01:51:37.700 --> 01:51:39.700
For is it 4k?

01:51:39.780 --> 01:51:41.780
Is it 4k?

01:51:42.700 --> 01:51:49.900
And there's also a demo out for a 16-bit version of Resident Evil for the Sega Megadrive slash

01:51:50.860 --> 01:51:52.860
Genesis

01:51:53.300 --> 01:51:57.380
Bobby black wolf and chat by the way saying not all of us can play it at home for real

01:51:57.860 --> 01:52:04.140
Start soccer. You're like dark soccer. You need to check your pinball privilege. You know what what people could just come to my house

01:52:04.740 --> 01:52:06.740
So Bobby's invited to your house

01:52:07.460 --> 01:52:10.840
Come on out Bobby. So he can't use that excuse anymore

01:52:12.980 --> 01:52:19.240
That sounds fair there's nothing wrong with this plan a little bit of an aside huh at coin up they have Lexi light speed

01:52:20.080 --> 01:52:26.120
No Lexi light speed is supposed to it's a prototype modular pinball table that has a

01:52:27.920 --> 01:52:34.280
Monitor built into the play field so you can reprogram the monitor and change out the modular parts and then make it a new game

01:52:35.040 --> 01:52:39.720
But just saying for folks in this area go to quite up and play Lexi light speed

01:52:40.080 --> 01:52:44.940
Bobby has also and he's talked about this on his show. He's moved into a new house

01:52:45.380 --> 01:52:46.500
That

01:52:46.500 --> 01:52:52.940
Is soon to be he will have that basement full of pinball stuff, so he's he's complaining now

01:52:52.940 --> 01:52:54.940
But later I don't think it's gonna be an issue

01:52:54.940 --> 01:52:57.340
And I still one of these days one of these days are sorry

01:52:57.340 --> 01:53:02.740
I will have my baby pac-man machine one of these days. We looked at one. Did you really it was like six grand?

01:53:03.260 --> 01:53:07.900
Six grand for baby pac-man for working fully shopped. Oh my god

01:53:08.540 --> 01:53:11.660
It can wear again pimple pimple prices have gone way up

01:53:12.340 --> 01:53:16.580
Like you could get a medieval madness for maybe five grand

01:53:17.060 --> 01:53:25.300
Eight nine now Wow seriously all right on the anyway a 16-bit Resident Evil blah blah blah in the meantime pinball FX will work

01:53:25.940 --> 01:53:29.020
That was the other story, but that was it that was it

01:53:30.860 --> 01:53:33.900
16-bit Resident Evil blah blah cares pinball

01:53:34.700 --> 01:53:36.700
Rob we need to do the pinball cast

01:53:37.420 --> 01:53:41.440
I'm not as a pinball as you are it needs to be called look at my balls

01:53:42.860 --> 01:53:44.860
I'll call it that why not

01:53:45.380 --> 01:53:47.380
shiny balls I

01:53:47.580 --> 01:53:52.780
Think I think you should find another surely there are other female pinball enthusiasts out there

01:53:52.860 --> 01:53:58.220
You should all band together and do a cast a lady cast a lady called look at my balls

01:54:00.380 --> 01:54:04.680
Show of hands in chat would you listen to a lady pinball cast called look at my balls?

01:54:05.680 --> 01:54:07.680
Look at my shiny balls

01:54:09.320 --> 01:54:13.860
They would they'd listen to it ever since you were young boy. Did you play the silver ball?

01:54:16.480 --> 01:54:21.960
It only works if you sing it it doesn't it doesn't work right if you just recite it all right

01:54:22.960 --> 01:54:30.560
So just just just to say the website doing that Resident Evil 16-bit PS CD. Are you?

01:54:31.560 --> 01:54:34.120
To visit those types of places at your own risk, but

01:54:34.640 --> 01:54:40.120
There's a demo for the Sega Mega Drive slash Genesis of basically a remake of Resident Evil

01:54:40.120 --> 01:54:44.460
But in 16-bit, I thought you would have been into that dark Sakura, but you got distracted by pin

01:54:44.460 --> 01:54:50.860
I got distracted by balls all right by the way balls some comments in chat Brad says best name ever

01:54:51.600 --> 01:54:56.240
Let's see Brad also says fuck. Yes, that's two and I'm at says yes for three says yes

01:54:56.360 --> 01:55:01.480
Rage Nader says sign me up come on Noel Gus says sounds like Manthur daddy needs a sugar daddy

01:55:01.960 --> 01:55:04.000
When it comes to my baby Batman machine

01:55:04.880 --> 01:55:08.960
Why now do I have Hedvig in my head? Oh my god? I got a

01:55:09.560 --> 01:55:13.960
Tangent time I got a snapchat from our pal Victoria who has she ever been on this show

01:55:13.960 --> 01:55:18.480
Maybe once like a long time ago, cuz she doesn't really play a lot of game. Well. She'll tell you she's now the cosplay Queen

01:55:18.480 --> 01:55:20.600
Okay, she'll tell you she doesn't play video games

01:55:20.600 --> 01:55:24.860
But then she'll be like I just ran an all-female D&D campaign where we do

01:55:24.860 --> 01:55:29.260
I'm like bitch you play games you play games up. Yeah, so anyway um

01:55:30.100 --> 01:55:35.540
But she sent me a snap she was watching Hedwig earlier today and exposing one of her friends to it

01:55:35.540 --> 01:55:38.700
And if you've never seen this movie called Hedwig is a good word for it

01:55:38.700 --> 01:55:42.460
It's it's like one of the greatest movies one of my absolute favorite movies ever

01:55:42.460 --> 01:55:46.900
It's a few years old at this point, and they did a Broadway revival that was well known with Neil Patrick Harris

01:55:47.180 --> 01:55:51.660
But the movie is great too, so that was my tangent. Thank you very much

01:55:52.180 --> 01:55:53.820
All right

01:55:53.860 --> 01:56:00.560
Bobby black wolf and chat says I write an actual factual thing that's neat about pinball fx3 and it gets ignored for man

01:56:00.560 --> 01:56:05.380
They're baby. Oh hi this must be your first episode of orange launch radio welcome to the show as I mentioned

01:56:05.380 --> 01:56:08.460
We're three friends that all met playing DDR fine. Here's the comment

01:56:09.060 --> 01:56:15.220
Blackwell says the great thing about pinball fx3 is that they have a game mode that actually teaches you the way to play

01:56:15.740 --> 01:56:19.880
Proper pinball today as in how to do the objectives and stuff

01:56:20.760 --> 01:56:24.360
Keep the ball in play as long as possible ball flips that's right

01:56:25.120 --> 01:56:30.240
All right if anyone wants to see a really good multi ball run

01:56:30.240 --> 01:56:34.100
I did put video up of Dan playing cactus Canyon continued

01:56:34.100 --> 01:56:39.800
And you don't always hit both flippers at the same time. That's a total fucking noob move

01:56:40.520 --> 01:56:44.040
You hit one or the other maybe once in a while you hit both

01:56:44.040 --> 01:56:49.800
But two rules right now what look at the layout of the field and don't play the Simpsons pinball party at the ball

01:56:49.800 --> 01:56:51.800
bolt

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:58.120
If there are two things I know about bit ball that could be the first episode there's two things

01:56:58.120 --> 01:57:03.600
I know look we're gonna talk about my two balls my two big balls right at the top of the show

01:57:04.420 --> 01:57:10.460
Number one look at the play field number two don't play Simpsons party at the bolt now

01:57:10.460 --> 01:57:12.460
I know that may be low-hanging balls there

01:57:13.380 --> 01:57:15.380

01:57:16.500 --> 01:57:19.300
Y'all are on fire tonight, what's that we take a week off

01:57:19.480 --> 01:57:24.260

You might know that as Pro Evo soccer, which is probably coming out in Europe, but I'll wait for Jamie to confirm that

01:59:25.200 --> 01:59:29.960
It doesn't pick up again till September the 21st so that Pro Evo doesn't sound like it's actually on the Vita this week

01:59:30.040 --> 01:59:36.520
But on the switch this week winning post 8 2017 and champion jockey special are out this week

02:01:44.680 --> 02:01:48.600
Got my Raspberry Pi in case a few days after the first email

02:01:48.600 --> 02:01:52.080
I wrote it was really easy to set up only took a few hours now

02:01:52.080 --> 02:01:57.200
I have a mini classic system the place way more than 30 games actually about 200 times more

02:01:57.720 --> 02:02:03.360
So far with a lot of room for another few thousand. I've been enjoying some other three a couple of Metroid games

02:02:03.360 --> 02:02:09.040
I missed in the past and some gamer 80d fueled random classic arcade game sessions

02:02:09.040 --> 02:02:11.640
I just thought I'd let you guys know it was up and running

02:02:11.640 --> 02:02:19.040
I encourage anyone who missed out on Nintendo's minis or anyone who does love classic games to give it a go and put one of

02:02:19.040 --> 02:02:21.920
These together themselves. They're great. Thanks again fifth dream

02:02:22.360 --> 02:02:25.940
By the way fifth dreams in chat right now saying we never did read the original email

02:02:25.940 --> 02:02:28.000
It must it must have come in the week that we were gone

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:31.560
So well, I look I've actually been following his saga a little bit on Twitter and Facebook

02:02:31.560 --> 02:02:35.080
I'm sure I did cuz I was like, but I have one

02:02:35.600 --> 02:02:41.240
But anyway, well, we'll summarize a little bit. So it's quick. I'll read it. Okay. Okay. Hope you guys did it

02:02:41.320 --> 02:02:46.480
I hope you're proud of yourselves. You finally pushed me over the edge to purchase a Raspberry Pi kit to make a classic gaming rig

02:02:46.480 --> 02:02:52.100
I really wanted the NES classic the games on it were great and it was worth the price to get the games officially and legally

02:02:52.100 --> 02:02:57.460
But of course, I couldn't obtain one. I'm I'm mildly considered a Raspberry Pi but never bothered

02:02:57.460 --> 02:03:02.300
I wasn't really interested in this NES classic and after hearing the effery

02:03:02.880 --> 02:03:04.120
effery

02:03:04.120 --> 02:03:06.120
involving that system too and

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:12.860
The discussion of last episode you guys convinced me to look into the pie is an alternative for easy retro gaming on my TV

02:03:13.160 --> 02:03:16.720
It doesn't seem too complicated and I have a little extra money at the moment

02:03:16.720 --> 02:03:20.600
So I went for it as an actual if you did intend to cue the F you music

02:03:20.600 --> 02:03:26.160
I also you don't have to Rob. I also had it ready to go. I had it ready to go. I

02:03:27.200 --> 02:03:32.380
Also purchased a case for it that looks like a mini nest if Nintendo won't let me buy the thing from them

02:03:32.380 --> 02:03:34.380
I'll have to go ahead and make my own

02:03:34.500 --> 02:03:40.180
Anyway, thanks guys for inspiring me to take the plunge and do this soon. I'll be gaming like it's 1985

02:03:40.180 --> 02:03:44.220
I'm a brand new homemade classic system fifth dream. Don't blame me. I

02:03:46.100 --> 02:03:50.820
Bought one I I think it would have been great if Nintendo would have made enough of them

02:03:50.820 --> 02:03:55.020
So you didn't feel you had to turn to this route, but seeing as they didn't and you did

02:03:56.060 --> 02:04:00.140
I'm glad to hear it's running. Well, I'm glad it's working for you, but I

02:04:01.140 --> 02:04:03.820
Don't know I have I've got ever drive

02:04:03.820 --> 02:04:08.200
So as long as you as long as you did that put the guardian legend on it for me, bro

02:04:08.460 --> 02:04:10.900
Put the guardian ledges you put the guardian legend on it for three

02:04:10.900 --> 02:04:15.260
Did you see speaking of the guardian legend and I should have fucking brought this up

02:04:15.900 --> 02:04:20.700
There is an alpha build of a guardian legend kind of remix

02:04:21.980 --> 02:04:26.220
Oh, yes. I saw it floating around your Facebook. I think actually yeah

02:04:26.260 --> 02:04:34.100
I'm chatted with one of the testers of it over YouTube and I'm actually pretty pretty impressed with it

02:04:34.100 --> 02:04:37.880
I haven't had a chance to sit down and play it yet. Just given, you know work and everything

02:04:38.700 --> 02:04:40.700
especially next week

02:04:40.740 --> 02:04:45.940
But I I have it downloaded and the music is really good

02:04:46.540 --> 02:04:49.940
it looks like it's got some preliminary issues with collision detection and

02:04:50.660 --> 02:04:55.940
Tweaking the difficulty level some but it's an early fan made game. It's gonna have it looks really good. That's great

02:04:56.700 --> 02:05:02.060
All right, too bad that franchise can't seem to live on officially. I want the guys saying it compile

02:05:02.060 --> 02:05:04.980
I want the guys who made blaster master zero to get their hands on this

02:05:05.180 --> 02:05:10.100
Like who do I have to blow to make that happen the entirety of compile?

02:05:10.980 --> 02:05:13.920
Line them up all three people left for the company line them up

02:05:15.500 --> 02:05:17.500
All right

02:05:18.020 --> 02:05:20.020
Anyway

02:05:20.100 --> 02:05:26.180
That's it for the mailbag if you want to send us an email for a future week participate at orange lounge radio.com

02:05:26.420 --> 02:05:29.860
We do have some more news stories for you guys, and then we're gonna open up the skype line

02:05:29.860 --> 02:05:31.860
Yes, Skype is back tonight. Yay

02:05:32.380 --> 02:05:35.320
Orange lounge radio all one word on Skype Loki you first though

02:05:36.220 --> 02:05:38.220
alright, so

02:05:38.580 --> 02:05:40.580
Let's talk a little bit about

02:05:42.580 --> 02:05:44.060
YouTube again

02:05:44.060 --> 02:05:48.220
Unfortunately, so there's a whole csgo gambling foot of fiasco

02:05:48.220 --> 02:05:54.180
I guess with these different independent run gambling sites that basically allowed you to bet on

02:05:54.180 --> 02:05:56.180
our

02:05:56.900 --> 02:06:00.380
Different like loot boxes and stuff and all that so

02:06:01.060 --> 02:06:03.500
the the problem was that there's these two guys a

02:06:04.460 --> 02:06:10.900
Trevor Martin or a T T Martin and Thomas syndicate castle who were running

02:06:11.500 --> 02:06:14.860
These sites and they were also promoting them on their YouTube channels

02:06:14.860 --> 02:06:21.380
But not necessarily showing that they you know that disclosing that they own these sites in fact

02:06:21.420 --> 02:06:26.700
They even faked videos showing that oh, yeah, they're winning all this valuable loot and basically kind of promoting this stuff

02:06:26.940 --> 02:06:29.900
So they did run afoul with the FTC

02:06:30.500 --> 02:06:37.220
However, there was no penalty because FTC said it normally can't find defendants for a first offense

02:06:37.780 --> 02:06:40.340
however, it did say that they could face up to

02:06:41.460 --> 02:06:48.020
More than 40,000 per violation if they fail to clearly and conspicuously disclose any future activity

02:06:48.140 --> 02:06:53.140
Of course a lot of people aren't too happy about that because they feel that these guys have already deceived

02:06:53.380 --> 02:06:59.900
Quite a few people, but I guess they get a warning for now, and hopefully they discontinue their activities

02:07:02.620 --> 02:07:07.340
You've been warned you've been given a stern warning don't do it again

02:07:07.340 --> 02:07:11.080
Even though you write millions of dollars on this don't do it anymore

02:07:12.820 --> 02:07:14.660
Right

02:07:14.660 --> 02:07:21.380
So moving over to Nintendo and something that I think a lot of us have been asking Nintendo for for some time not everybody

02:07:21.380 --> 02:07:26.300
Though to be fair is an achievement system on Nintendo's console obviously

02:07:26.300 --> 02:07:30.420
You know Xbox the 360 and one have the achievement points system

02:07:31.100 --> 02:07:38.380
The Sony PlayStation has the trophy thing, but Nintendo systems don't have anything at least not for now

02:07:38.900 --> 02:07:44.620
What's kind of interesting is that there was a ask me anything that happened this past week and one of the developers?

02:07:44.660 --> 02:07:50.100
From crunching koalas was doing an ask me anything over the Nintendo switch game at licked spear

02:07:50.100 --> 02:07:53.760
I hope I said that right now apparently as part of this AMA

02:07:54.180 --> 02:07:58.620
He may have let it slip that there is actually an achievement system coming out

02:07:59.740 --> 02:08:04.480
See I'm trying to find the specific quote here in the AMA thread where it is

02:08:06.780 --> 02:08:08.780
He said

02:08:09.620 --> 02:08:11.540
That

02:08:11.580 --> 02:08:15.040
Sorry I didn't have it up as soon as I was ready to go to the story here

02:08:15.040 --> 02:08:20.260
I here we go so he was responding to somebody who asked does your game have online rankings and he replied and said

02:08:20.580 --> 02:08:26.720
Nintendo doesn't have an official support for achievements and leaderboards like Sony or Microsoft, but we know that they're working on it

02:08:26.860 --> 02:08:29.780
We'll see how it goes and we'll add the rankings along the way

02:08:30.260 --> 02:08:36.140
Also the game has multiple levels game modes difficulty levels etc etc so he said we know they're working on it now

02:08:36.180 --> 02:08:41.020
Could this be that this is something that's about to get unveiled when Nintendo wants your money?

02:08:42.500 --> 02:08:47.860
It's the first time ever that achievements have been brought to consoles Nintendo is such an innovator

02:08:49.180 --> 02:08:50.940
well

02:08:50.940 --> 02:08:54.460
They could put I I said this a long time ago

02:08:54.460 --> 02:09:00.740
Is that Nintendo could do it like coins and you could actually like you get coins when you do stuff in games?

02:09:00.740 --> 02:09:02.560
I guess this is kind of like the mind Nintendo system

02:09:02.560 --> 02:09:08.580
But then you could actually use those coins for dinky rewards or maybe heck tie it into the mind Nintendo system

02:09:08.580 --> 02:09:13.780
Why not me Tomo I remember that was one of the big reasons to play me Tomo is you actually got coins

02:09:13.980 --> 02:09:19.220
From doing stuff that you could buy like it was really it was mostly dippy stuff

02:09:19.220 --> 02:09:22.260
It was like backgrounds and 3ds themes

02:09:22.580 --> 02:09:29.580
You know, but but it's still something and I think at one point they gave away like for a thousand of those coins

02:09:29.580 --> 02:09:31.140
You could get p-cross

02:09:31.140 --> 02:09:35.500
Zelda version of 3ds like there was actual like games you could get now see it

02:09:36.060 --> 02:09:39.380
Yes, Nintendo actually would be groundbreaking if they did stuff like that

02:09:39.380 --> 02:09:44.460
I'm not gonna hold my breath, but even a basic achievement system would be more than they've got now. I

02:09:46.060 --> 02:09:48.060
Agree with you. However

02:09:49.020 --> 02:09:50.420
however

02:09:50.420 --> 02:09:56.220
Microsoft used to do that with the Xbox achievements where certain achievements would unlock stuff for your

02:09:56.580 --> 02:09:59.540
Avatars, all right movie and stuff. So it's been done

02:10:00.460 --> 02:10:04.940
Okay, that's true, but I'm sure they would like to tout themselves as groundbreaking with some stupid shit like that

02:10:04.940 --> 02:10:10.500
Yes, I mean, but I also realize not everybody out there is into the achievement thing and that's cool

02:10:10.500 --> 02:10:12.920
But I think Nintendo has such a rich catalog

02:10:13.500 --> 02:10:18.760
Especially if they are gonna go back if they're gonna go back and update 8-bit games like balloon fight

02:10:18.760 --> 02:10:23.580
Let's say to play online then if they're gonna be in there having to update it to do online

02:10:23.580 --> 02:10:26.540
Anyway, then why not sneak in some achievements while you're at it

02:10:26.540 --> 02:10:33.380
I mean, I realize this is not something that could be done for the entire catalog, but you know some of your biggest classics

02:10:33.940 --> 02:10:41.600
Why not? I don't know. Yeah, we'll see Oh rage nator says I can you buy stuff with you play achievements, too

02:10:41.600 --> 02:10:43.600
That is true. You play has that

02:10:44.420 --> 02:10:45.460
actually

02:10:45.460 --> 02:10:51.500
Pretty useful. Yeah, you can get like dance remixes and just dance and things like that. All right, so I use it

02:10:51.500 --> 02:10:54.820
I use why did use it for South Park Oh

02:10:55.820 --> 02:11:03.260
Costume unlocks, right? Okay. Well, maybe okay, so Nintendo wouldn't necessarily be innovative in this department, but it would be Nintendo

02:11:03.260 --> 02:11:05.260
So you all wouldn't care trust

02:11:06.100 --> 02:11:08.100
Dark saga. What do you have for us?

02:11:09.660 --> 02:11:18.540
Well, it's a little tiny bone thrown out to to Silent Hill fans, but in an interview

02:11:19.180 --> 02:11:20.140
A

02:11:20.140 --> 02:11:27.940
Kiriyama Oka was saying that he would love to work on another Silent Hill title if the series was revived and he said

02:11:28.220 --> 02:11:33.200
Several times that he really wanted to work on another Silent Hill game

02:11:34.500 --> 02:11:38.840
It was mentioned at gamescom. He said I am NOT against it, but it's hard to say

02:11:39.380 --> 02:11:43.060
Because everyone has evolved and maybe the mindset has changed as well

02:11:43.820 --> 02:11:45.820
so

02:11:46.500 --> 02:11:48.500
At least we know we can count on somebody

02:11:49.020 --> 02:11:50.580
for Silent Hill

02:11:50.580 --> 02:11:57.060
Well, I guess if a Bomberman revival happened any and DDR still chugging along over there Konami anything's possible

02:11:57.220 --> 02:12:00.720
But I'm just not gonna hold my breath. I'm not gonna get my hopes up over anything

02:12:01.100 --> 02:12:04.340
Yeah, I still need to watch that Castlevania anime though. I just

02:12:04.900 --> 02:12:08.100
So much to do so little time to do it when I need to nap. I

02:12:09.940 --> 02:12:13.060
Was I was too busy watching the Twin Peaks revival

02:12:13.060 --> 02:12:16.020
I don't know. I don't know what I'm gonna do tonight after my live stream

02:12:16.020 --> 02:12:18.620
There's no more Twin Peaks revival to watch it ended last week

02:12:18.620 --> 02:12:22.140
Did you know that and I had to wait I had to wait till Monday to see it

02:12:22.140 --> 02:12:27.540
I had to avoid Twitter for 24 hours because I was worried about being spoiled. Oops. I know I know

02:12:28.180 --> 02:12:33.860
Sacrifices, I know the sacrifices I make my eyes hurt now anyway from rolling

02:12:34.340 --> 02:12:41.420
But I will give a shout out to John from critical myth because he wrote a great review of the finale on our website

02:12:41.420 --> 02:12:47.020
vog network.com there. He has the whole little section there and him and his staff for the TV reviews and

02:12:47.820 --> 02:12:50.940
He did a great one for the Twin Peaks finale. It's filled with spoilers

02:12:50.940 --> 02:12:55.280
So don't read it unless you unless you never plan to watch it or you don't care about

02:12:55.420 --> 02:12:59.580
Probably watch it then cuz I'm not gonna watch it. Yeah, but he did a really good review

02:12:59.580 --> 02:13:05.320
I thought so good. I just want to give I just want to give props where props is due. All right

02:13:05.980 --> 02:13:09.420
And act deft and chat says spoilers it ends

02:13:12.260 --> 02:13:14.020
I don't know if that's true

02:13:14.020 --> 02:13:15.340
anyway

02:13:15.340 --> 02:13:20.740
Loki what do you have for us? All right, so apparently steam has been blocked in Malaysia

02:13:21.500 --> 02:13:26.860
And the reason it was blocked is because there's this game that's actually on steam right now

02:13:27.500 --> 02:13:34.340
Called fight of the gods and so it's an early access and basically stars different god type characters

02:13:34.660 --> 02:13:36.060
From different

02:13:36.060 --> 02:13:42.400
Mythologies fighting against each other. So you have Jesus Christ versus Zeus versus Odin versus

02:13:43.340 --> 02:13:49.220
This doesn't sound controversial whatsoever. And they also have like Moses and wait, isn't this right?

02:13:50.060 --> 02:13:56.560
Huh? Isn't this might you're describing? I don't know. It's a joke. It's a joke. But yeah, it looks like it's a silly fighting game

02:13:57.200 --> 02:13:59.820
but of course, you know they took offense to it because

02:14:00.460 --> 02:14:06.260
You know Jesus in a fighting game is offensive to some people yes. Yes. Yeah, so basically yeah, I

02:14:08.140 --> 02:14:10.140
Like there

02:14:10.360 --> 02:14:12.660
They have like I guess they're saying that

02:14:13.780 --> 02:14:18.420
His fight introduction and there's a voice-over result. I'm back for the people

02:14:18.460 --> 02:14:23.940
He rips his himself off the cross and uses like I guess some of the blocks of wood still

02:14:24.340 --> 02:14:26.520
You know nailed to his hands as weapons

02:14:26.520 --> 02:14:28.520
Wow

02:14:29.040 --> 02:14:31.040
Well, you know what

02:14:32.280 --> 02:14:36.680
Hey people are free to make whatever game they want sounds I mean the game itself

02:14:36.680 --> 02:14:41.140
I mean, it's not you know, it's still very early. It's rough

02:14:41.880 --> 02:14:46.440
Bobby black wolf says in chat the trailer says he's back and he's cross

02:14:52.720 --> 02:14:54.720
Okay

02:14:55.720 --> 02:14:56.880
Anyhow

02:14:56.880 --> 02:15:01.800
Yeah, some country some countries don't appreciate that type of stuff. So if he really wants to piss people off

02:15:02.400 --> 02:15:04.520
He'll put the Prophet Muhammad in there, too

02:15:06.520 --> 02:15:08.520
Don't go there. All right

02:15:09.280 --> 02:15:14.760
Moving on one more story JD says Bobby real really nailed that one and Bobby's like no

02:15:14.760 --> 02:15:19.000
I'm not kidding. Like that wasn't a joke. That was really really in the trailer. All right

02:15:19.600 --> 02:15:26.520
Moving on one more story for you guys tonight our last story tonight, and I hope there is a particular listener of ours

02:15:26.520 --> 02:15:32.240
That's paying attention to this story that I'm about to talk about because I don't bring this game up very often on the show

02:15:32.380 --> 02:15:34.660
But I felt it was worthy to bring up tonight

02:15:35.300 --> 02:15:42.440
Magic the gathering that's right Wizards of the coast unveiled this week magic the gathering arena. It's a free-to-play title

02:15:42.440 --> 02:15:47.520
So I think this listener it's like two favorite things combined magic the gathering and free

02:15:47.540 --> 02:15:51.480
So it's a free-to-play title and it's being made by digital games studio

02:15:51.480 --> 02:15:57.380
If you would like you can get in the closed beta, which you can get into a magic wizards calm

02:15:58.040 --> 02:16:02.640
Slash en slash MTG arena or you can probably google it and you'll find it that way

02:16:02.720 --> 02:16:06.940
The game is targeting a PC release, but they're looking to do other platforms as well

02:16:07.480 --> 02:16:14.720
The beta is going to start with constructed play where you can build decks using all 279 cards from the upcoming expansion set

02:16:14.720 --> 02:16:16.440
I

02:16:16.440 --> 02:16:18.160
Shall on am I saying that right?

02:16:18.160 --> 02:16:23.160
It's I X a la n but I think when you have an X in that context between two vowels is the noise, right?

02:16:23.160 --> 02:16:25.160
I think each along

02:16:25.480 --> 02:16:32.400
draft draft and ranked constructed are coming later the goal for launch to include all standard legal magic cards

02:16:32.680 --> 02:16:37.720
The focused of the arena game will be on the newest cards and game mode because of this

02:16:37.720 --> 02:16:41.920
We know that magic online which is a library of nearly every card ever printed from the game's entire history

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:45.960
Will continue to offer experiences to players that are unique to magic online

02:16:46.780 --> 02:16:51.360
Development on magic online will continue with new card sets new updates and ongoing tournaments

02:16:51.360 --> 02:16:54.600
So you there's both games that are going to be covered there

02:16:54.840 --> 02:17:01.520
They are trying to go after live streaming with this and they are hoping that MTG arena will be one of the most viewed streams

02:17:01.520 --> 02:17:04.880
On twitch and I gotta say looking at the layout of this game

02:17:05.600 --> 02:17:09.900
they definitely know some of the things that work well with Hearthstone because um

02:17:10.660 --> 02:17:15.340
I'm kind of reminded of it. But to be fair Hearthstone owes a lot to magic the gathering as well

02:17:15.340 --> 02:17:21.300
So it's kind of neat that how these two games have kind of helped each other out. So imagine the gathering arena

02:17:21.300 --> 02:17:23.300
I like the free

02:17:23.540 --> 02:17:27.700
Portion of that that definitely is motivating to check that out. So check that out

02:17:27.940 --> 02:17:34.040
Alright, we're gonna open up the skype line right now orange lounge radio all one word on skype

02:17:34.040 --> 02:17:39.260
and by the way, if you didn't catch the reference their rage inator who calls into this show likes free games and

02:17:39.980 --> 02:17:41.460
Often talks about magic the gathering

02:17:41.460 --> 02:17:43.220
So if you didn't catch the joke just just you know

02:17:43.220 --> 02:17:45.220
I just wanna explain it for you guys one of our frequent caller

02:17:45.340 --> 02:17:51.780
If you want to be a frequent caller or a first-time caller orange lounge radio all one word on skype and sure enough

02:17:51.780 --> 02:17:56.060
Wow, it's lighting up right now. So let's get to it. We have some calls coming in coming in

02:17:56.060 --> 02:18:00.500
We're gonna start with this one higher on orange launch radio. Who's this? Hey, what's going on? Everyone? It's Ron

02:18:00.500 --> 02:18:06.780
Hey Rama, good to talk to you. How are you? I'm good. I'm relaxing. I've done all my adult chores

02:18:06.780 --> 02:18:13.780
I'm kicking back with an adult beverage. Good job. You adulthood do something adult. Mm-hmm. All right, what's on your mind, buddy?

02:18:14.140 --> 02:18:16.460
Well first things first, you know, I totally forgot about

02:18:17.860 --> 02:18:23.540
Metroid coming out. I know bad gamer bad gamer. It's so there's a lot happening. So it's okay

02:18:23.540 --> 02:18:27.060
I am so I'm trying to track down a copy of the

02:18:28.900 --> 02:18:32.620
Deluxe the deluxe edition. I'm hoping that target pulls through for me on this

02:18:32.620 --> 02:18:33.940
Yeah

02:18:33.940 --> 02:18:36.700
Yeah, you know what? I couldn't find a deluxe edition either

02:18:36.700 --> 02:18:41.480
So I just I ended up ordering the regular one because I don't think there was that big a difference between the deluxe and the

02:18:41.480 --> 02:18:46.500
Regular I think it's extra because of the CD soundtrack is some other stuff. If anything I just go to a GameStop

02:18:46.500 --> 02:18:48.500
You know how they do know

02:18:48.740 --> 02:18:52.700
Yeah, they'll just kind of like be like, alright here you go. If we don't we didn't sell them all or whatever

02:18:53.300 --> 02:18:57.580
There you go. But um, this is something I want to call in and talk about real quick

02:18:57.580 --> 02:19:03.060
I don't know. This has been this has been talked about but this is my theory on the whole

02:19:03.820 --> 02:19:07.020
Microsoft Sony Nintendo cross-platform gaming thing

02:19:07.260 --> 02:19:08.580
We haven't talked about it tonight

02:19:08.580 --> 02:19:13.640
but this has definitely come up in previous episodes, especially when games like rocket league come up and I think

02:19:13.860 --> 02:19:19.380
Specifically that one because of the fact that rocket league will be out on Nintendo platforms before the end of the year

02:19:19.380 --> 02:19:21.380
So what are your thoughts? Oh

02:19:22.300 --> 02:19:27.960
First things first now when you play on Xbox Live, those are centralized Microsoft servers

02:19:27.960 --> 02:19:32.420
They handle all of that first party third party. They handle all of that. Yep

02:19:32.700 --> 02:19:35.500
This is the main reason why you can't PC play

02:19:35.780 --> 02:19:40.420
whereas on PC the third party companies handle their own servers and

02:19:40.700 --> 02:19:47.780
Also when it comes to Sony you connect to their central servers first before you go out to the PC servers now

02:19:48.260 --> 02:19:49.340
for

02:19:49.340 --> 02:19:56.300
Unified play you would need a Microsoft account. It's what whatever email address you use to log in with Xbox Live

02:19:56.300 --> 02:19:57.660
That's your Microsoft account

02:19:57.660 --> 02:20:02.980
So you could tie that to your Nintendo account and if you notice on various sites

02:20:02.980 --> 02:20:07.780
You could tie your Nintendo account to your Facebook account your Google account, whatever

02:20:08.420 --> 02:20:15.420
That that's all said and good and I believe that is the main reason why Sony does not want to play with Nintendo like that

02:20:15.700 --> 02:20:21.220
Because they don't want people tying their Sony IDs to the Microsoft accounts

02:20:21.220 --> 02:20:27.380
I feel that they don't want Sony they don't want Microsoft to deal with the services. They can't handling everything

02:20:27.380 --> 02:20:34.220
You know what I'm saying? Yeah my game my rules, but isn't it interesting that Final Fantasy 14 exists now granted. It's not on

02:20:34.740 --> 02:20:38.540
Xbox one, but it's Sony and PC cross play true

02:20:38.540 --> 02:20:43.540
But when I'm just saying when that time comes when it comes out on on Xbox one

02:20:44.540 --> 02:20:49.380
We will not be able to play together because that's separate separate centralized servers unless

02:20:50.220 --> 02:20:54.540
Sony or square whoever decide to you know, let's try to make this work

02:20:54.540 --> 02:20:58.980
Well square is flat-out said if they won't do that, then they're not releasing it done

02:20:58.980 --> 02:21:04.940
They're not gonna release on Xbox unless they drop that whole thing. And that's what it is. That's that

02:21:05.540 --> 02:21:07.300
Microsoft is not gonna let that happen

02:21:07.300 --> 02:21:14.780
But yet well they but they did with Final Fantasy 11 which was cross play between Xbox 360 and PlayStation 2 granted

02:21:14.780 --> 02:21:20.100
I know that was years ago, but it is still an example of they can make it work true

02:21:20.100 --> 02:21:25.980
Maybe my theory is it worked. Well, but probably higher up. So Microsoft will just wasn't feeling it

02:21:26.100 --> 02:21:30.020
Maybe it was a deal. Maybe I don't know it was absolutely it was absolutely deal

02:21:30.020 --> 02:21:36.300
It was we want square on Microsoft platform. So fucking badly. We will do anything

02:21:36.460 --> 02:21:43.860
Oh, how about our MMO that we could make more money off of with your platform that caters to the America audience

02:21:43.860 --> 02:21:47.500
How about that? And yep. Okay. Sounds good. Yep. Great MMO 360

02:21:47.500 --> 02:21:53.300
Let's do it and they didn't give a fuck about the PC and PlayStation element because they finally got a square release on their console

02:21:53.300 --> 02:21:58.340
That's why I did it and I think with with FF 11 once you connected the Microsoft servers

02:21:58.340 --> 02:22:01.300
You bounced off to the square servers to play

02:22:01.300 --> 02:22:08.740
Yes, which ironically play online at the time play online doesn't really exist anymore at least not in that form but

02:22:09.900 --> 02:22:16.100
Play online was a joint venture between Square and Sony. So you were it was like you were using a Sony service on your

02:22:16.740 --> 02:22:19.260
Xbox 360 I'm stretching it a little bit

02:22:19.260 --> 02:22:25.460
But still it's it's not the type of thing that would exist today and it's weird to think that just what God that was what?

02:22:25.860 --> 02:22:32.800
Treasures of Otter gone was maybe a 2008 release. This wasn't a horrifically long time ago pretty much. Yeah

02:22:33.980 --> 02:22:41.340
They could make it work if they want to well my isn't minecraft. Haven't they also said that minecraft will be playable between

02:22:42.620 --> 02:22:46.540
It's basically everything but Sony. Yeah, cuz it's pretty much

02:22:47.340 --> 02:22:49.580
When when Microsoft when it comes out for the switch

02:22:49.900 --> 02:22:55.300
You're gonna be connecting to Microsoft servers logging in with a Microsoft account to keep it all together

02:22:55.820 --> 02:23:01.420
Because the majority of players are pretty much PC Xbox and you play on the PC

02:23:01.420 --> 02:23:07.300
you're logging in with your Microsoft account there or if you if you if you've been playing micro for a long time and

02:23:07.840 --> 02:23:13.540
You get it for the switch and you see a login says log with your Microsoft account that person will be like, oh easy

02:23:13.540 --> 02:23:16.820
I don't have to create no new account. No, I could just jump right in and play. Yep

02:23:16.820 --> 02:23:18.820
Yeah

02:23:19.540 --> 02:23:26.700
It's gonna be interesting but you know people people don't seem to be threatened by Nintendo when it comes to the online space fancy that

02:23:27.340 --> 02:23:31.180
Cuz nobody's ever like fu Nintendo. You can't join in on this

02:23:31.300 --> 02:23:37.380
Well, usually it's Nintendo your system is incapable of joining in on this but with the switch some of that seems to be changing

02:23:37.380 --> 02:23:40.980
I guess between rocket League and minecraft and whatever else

02:23:41.900 --> 02:23:46.680
Slowly, but surely but I am getting impressed by the switch. Am I getting one?

02:23:46.900 --> 02:23:52.540
Not just yet. I'm still waiting. Will you be able to get one when you want one thoughts and prayers?

02:23:53.460 --> 02:23:55.460
Something like that, but I will say this

02:23:56.100 --> 02:24:00.260
The next my next console will be an Xbox one. Will it be an S or an X?

02:24:00.420 --> 02:24:02.420
We will see as the holidays come down

02:24:03.940 --> 02:24:07.580
Might also depend on is crackdown 3 out yet, right? Yeah

02:24:08.100 --> 02:24:14.300
And like I said, the only reason why I'm getting an Xbox one as as you've always said it's the golden rule of games

02:24:14.300 --> 02:24:20.200
It's the only reason why my first next-gen console at time was an Xbox 360 that console has all the games

02:24:20.200 --> 02:24:24.860
I will sit there and play the fuck out of yes, sir. That's the most important if it has the games you want

02:24:25.420 --> 02:24:28.380
Absolutely. All right, my friend. I'm gonna let you go to see if we get any more calls

02:24:28.380 --> 02:24:30.460
but thank you as always for the call and

02:24:31.060 --> 02:24:34.820
Everybody should check out anime jam session, even if none of you went to Dragon Con

02:24:35.580 --> 02:24:41.180
No, but what one of my staffers it you go. She did go and I told her to find you that weekend

02:24:41.260 --> 02:24:44.100
Go down to the podcasting tracks find a vlog staff

02:24:44.780 --> 02:24:50.840
Give Rob a hug. Oh, I I did not run into her sadly, but Dragon Con is a huge 80,000 people this year

02:24:51.420 --> 02:24:57.340
She's quite a precious little cinnamon roll. Well, there's always next year cuz we I will be back next year

02:24:58.660 --> 02:25:01.740
Might just see a unlockable character come down next year

02:25:01.740 --> 02:25:06.780
Oh, I miss actually I think I'm allowed to say this because I think has he said it on Twitter

02:25:06.780 --> 02:25:08.660
All right, maybe I'll get in trouble, but I'm gonna say it

02:25:08.660 --> 02:25:12.100
anyway, my understanding is that Travis Donovan's back next year and

02:25:12.980 --> 02:25:19.860
This is a this is a big fucking deal. Just see so I so I heard I think we need to get the all of Bob

02:25:19.860 --> 02:25:22.780
Together, you know if we're gonna do it we're gonna do it up

02:25:23.340 --> 02:25:27.300
Yeah, hell yeah who wants to get Raven and EJ plane tickets?

02:25:29.060 --> 02:25:31.180
Get girls gone Wow represented and

02:25:31.860 --> 02:25:36.780
Dark Sakura, I know I you I've been begging you to come to Dragon Con. I don't have money

02:25:36.780 --> 02:25:42.920
I know I know it's it's something you got to save and plan for it's shall I make a go fund me

02:25:43.660 --> 02:25:45.660
I will throw money towards it

02:25:46.140 --> 02:25:48.140
We'll see. All right

02:25:48.340 --> 02:25:53.100
Alright, I'm gonna let you go to get more calls. But thank you so much for the call. No problem. Stay fabulous Rob

02:25:53.100 --> 02:25:55.100
Thank you. Stay stay stay

02:25:55.940 --> 02:25:57.880
Stay safe

02:25:57.880 --> 02:26:00.220
Well, I'm trying to think of something new to tell you

02:26:00.900 --> 02:26:04.660
Okay, I thought you was trying not to say to because you might be offensive you forget

02:26:04.660 --> 02:26:09.580
I'm the hardest person to offend in this world. No, no stay black is the longest-running joke in all our history

02:26:09.580 --> 02:26:15.060
I'm just trying to we're coming up on episode 700 Rama. We got to we got to innovate a little bit here. I

02:26:18.900 --> 02:26:25.500
Guess you say stay we bitch or whatever because you know, that's how I am. I'm idle trash. Weeb trash. Whatever. No, I got it

02:26:25.500 --> 02:26:27.500
I got it. Stay drunk

02:26:30.060 --> 02:26:32.060
All right, take care buddy

02:26:32.340 --> 02:26:34.340
Bye

02:26:35.020 --> 02:26:36.180
Alright

02:26:36.180 --> 02:26:41.300
Bobby Blackwell says stay plumbing because he's no longer a plumber because he dresses as Luigi

02:26:41.300 --> 02:26:47.060
I like that that was good orange lounge radio all one word on Skype light before I take another call here

02:26:47.060 --> 02:26:49.780
Um any last-minute stories we want to get out Loki. Yes

02:26:49.780 --> 02:26:54.720
There's a rumor that the 2018 Call of Duty game is gonna be set in the modern setting

02:26:54.720 --> 02:26:59.500
The reason for that is because Treyarch has a job posting for some, you know

02:26:59.540 --> 02:27:06.080
Combat designer with triple-a competitive shooter experience deep knowledge of firearms and modern military

02:27:06.660 --> 02:27:13.260
Technology and you also have to be prestige one or above in black ops 3 multiplayer. So maybe another modern warfare game

02:27:13.260 --> 02:27:18.260
Let's just hope it's not North Korea cuz I might hit a little close to home right now with all that's going on in

02:27:18.260 --> 02:27:20.260
The world just saying IJS

02:27:21.020 --> 02:27:24.700
Let's get to another call. Hello. You're on orange launch radio. Who's this?

02:27:25.500 --> 02:27:27.160
Hi

02:27:27.160 --> 02:27:30.360
Hi, this is Regenator. Hey, Regenator. What's up, buddy? I

02:27:31.640 --> 02:27:36.240
You know, I can't hear me we can hear you. Can you hear us? Oh, yeah

02:27:36.240 --> 02:27:42.120
Sorry, I thought I hit the mute button for whatever reason. That's all right. Yeah, what's on your mind tonight, buddy?

02:27:42.560 --> 02:27:49.000
Well, you know, I heard a certain someone say my two favorite words free in magic

02:27:50.240 --> 02:27:52.120
Yeah

02:27:52.160 --> 02:27:55.440
Yeah, no, I figure you know when

02:27:56.080 --> 02:27:59.960
If you mention it, but do you know when this the magic arena is coming out?

02:27:59.960 --> 02:28:02.620
I don't think they've announced a date

02:28:02.620 --> 02:28:06.720
my assumption is that most this kind of stuff you usually want to get out by holiday, but

02:28:07.080 --> 02:28:10.880
free to play games are usually kind of held to a different standard because you know

02:28:10.880 --> 02:28:13.640
They it's supposed to be like kind of ongoing continuous income

02:28:13.760 --> 02:28:15.440
So, you know

02:28:15.440 --> 02:28:20.880
You would hope that something like this if they're trying to target the mobile market would try to be out by the time that

02:28:21.240 --> 02:28:27.280
Apple's new devices are out which you know times running out because they're likely to announce new phones next week

02:28:27.280 --> 02:28:31.380
And what it's usually only about two weeks after the announcement for those bad boys come out. So

02:28:32.040 --> 02:28:36.320
But I don't think it's gonna be that fast with the fact that they're trying to do this whole beta. So

02:28:37.080 --> 02:28:40.520
Hell for all we know it could be next spring before this thing is out

02:28:40.520 --> 02:28:42.520
It just really depends on what the developers want to do

02:28:43.280 --> 02:28:48.600
Well, I just hope this comes to steam cuz now he is anyone on my friends list gonna

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:55.840
Test ooh, I played the ever-living crap out of the previous magic the gallery games. I mean

02:28:56.840 --> 02:28:58.840
collectively I may put

02:28:59.320 --> 02:29:04.920
Good news rage in our houses and say PC is what they're targeting. So they're not even really actually targeting right now

02:29:05.440 --> 02:29:11.800
The the actual mobile market PC's what they're targeting. They haven't said steam per se, but does it matter?

02:29:13.080 --> 02:29:18.460
Yeah, really exactly. That's what I thought. That's like as long as this PC somewhere. I think you're gonna be okay

02:29:18.960 --> 02:29:26.200
Yeah, no for the main reason that I was gonna initially call before you even brought up magic the gallery. Sure

02:29:27.680 --> 02:29:28.840
No

02:29:28.840 --> 02:29:32.800
You know, it's a safe to say that the three of you are at least

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:35.800
somewhat familiar with

02:29:35.800 --> 02:29:37.880
the RPG maker series

02:29:38.920 --> 02:29:40.200
available

02:29:40.200 --> 02:29:46.040
Available. Oh, sorry. I know I'm familiar with it RPG maker you guys you guys probably all know it

02:29:46.040 --> 02:29:48.040
I mean, I've seen it in yeah, I just didn't have

02:29:48.600 --> 02:29:51.640
Patience for it as I say I was gonna ask if any of you guys have ever used it

02:29:51.640 --> 02:29:57.800
I'm aware of a long time ago. Okay, so I never have like I I probably picked it up in a humble thing at some

02:29:57.800 --> 02:30:02.600
Way, but I've played things that were a result of that because I believe to the moon was out of that

02:30:02.640 --> 02:30:07.040
Yeah that RPG maker right? So I've seen what it can do. Let's put it that way

02:30:07.040 --> 02:30:09.860
So that's about my familiarity with it. But have I done a game in it? No

02:30:10.520 --> 02:30:12.280
All right. Well, I

02:30:12.280 --> 02:30:17.080
The main reason I'm big enough is I got two questions regarding that

02:30:17.080 --> 02:30:19.080
um first now

02:30:19.760 --> 02:30:21.840
hypothetically speaking now if I were to

02:30:22.640 --> 02:30:27.120
Make it make a game, you know be a decent game or crappy one

02:30:28.640 --> 02:30:34.440
And would I be you know legally allowed to let's say hand it off to

02:30:35.440 --> 02:30:38.320
So I involved a lot to play with that

02:30:38.360 --> 02:30:44.360
No, and be if I would do that dude, they you know, where'd they be able to play the game?

02:30:44.920 --> 02:30:48.760
Just with the file itself that I make or where they need

02:30:49.480 --> 02:30:54.580
the actual RPG maker software to actually write them like using like

02:30:55.400 --> 02:30:58.540
For like a better almost like every later

02:30:58.800 --> 02:31:03.600
Okay, my assumption and chats gonna have to help me out here because I'm not familiar enough with the RPG maker

02:31:03.640 --> 02:31:09.980
But my assumption is that there's probably like a really cheap version that would allow you to make games

02:31:10.020 --> 02:31:15.980
But not really publish them and then there's probably a more expensive version that does allow you to publish them where you can run the

02:31:15.980 --> 02:31:22.820
exe is independently now obviously RPG maker has to have some sort of functionality like that somewhere because we've seen games like to the

02:31:22.820 --> 02:31:27.180
Moon come out as opposed to how much does it cost to make something like that? That's the part

02:31:27.180 --> 02:31:28.660
I'm not sure of okay

02:31:28.660 --> 02:31:33.500
Bobby says RPG maker has a binary on PC so you can distribute the game

02:31:33.500 --> 02:31:39.820
So whatever it is that you make you would be able to distribute on PC and you'd have to kind of carefully read the license

02:31:39.820 --> 02:31:43.780
Agreement, I don't know what you're allowed to sell and so forth

02:31:44.260 --> 02:31:46.940
But if you're gonna give it to a friend

02:31:47.180 --> 02:31:52.060
That you know through vog or something that are posted on our discord for people to freely download or something

02:31:52.060 --> 02:31:55.820
I think that's actually encouraged like RPG maker like wants you to do that

02:31:55.820 --> 02:31:59.500
That's what it's for like it would kind of be stupid if you built this whole game

02:31:59.500 --> 02:32:06.480
Then you couldn't share it with somebody so I think usually the sticky situations get into but then you profit off it

02:32:06.520 --> 02:32:08.520
And I'm not sure what happens from there

02:32:08.640 --> 02:32:11.760
I'd have to see the license agreement a little more carefully with that

02:32:11.760 --> 02:32:16.960
But yeah, if you want to just design something for friends to play like that's that's what the shit is for

02:32:17.640 --> 02:32:22.360
Absolutely do it. Oh, oh, all right. That's great cuz no, no, I

02:32:23.360 --> 02:32:29.200
Honestly picked up one of the versions of RPG maker from humble bundles some time ago

02:32:29.200 --> 02:32:34.600
I haven't really touched yet, but I've been thinking of doing something now

02:32:35.120 --> 02:32:37.120
With it throwing a whole bunch of

02:32:38.040 --> 02:32:43.260
vog references in it like what you did with the head off one

02:32:44.080 --> 02:32:47.600
Thing you did for typing up the dead. No, like put in

02:32:48.520 --> 02:32:53.680
Quotes and like they're like have a character like Bobby. They were mentioned

02:32:54.160 --> 02:32:59.120
No, VR, you know have another character they would say

02:32:59.200 --> 02:33:03.160
Yeah, we checked off, you know reject false icons stuff like that

02:33:03.160 --> 02:33:06.840
No, you want it you want to do a vog parody RPG of some sort?

02:33:07.560 --> 02:33:09.560
Basically, yeah. Well, I'm flattered

02:33:09.960 --> 02:33:16.880
But here's here's my honest suggestion to you with all that and this is the total opposite of what Loki does but listen to me

02:33:18.040 --> 02:33:21.000
Don't start off with your most ambitious project

02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:28.040
I would say what you need to start with since I know you love dick and fart jokes make a five-minute fart joke RPG

02:33:28.400 --> 02:33:33.700
Just so you can get in there and do it and make something and feel like you've accomplished something

02:33:33.840 --> 02:33:38.560
Because if you try to take on the most ambitious project first, you'll probably never finish it

02:33:42.640 --> 02:33:45.800
Well, honestly, I can't work here just yet cuz

02:33:46.840 --> 02:33:53.540
Frankly, I've been PC issues. I won't get into that here. But once I get that resolved

02:33:53.540 --> 02:34:00.980
I'll start working on and chances are once it all that is being said and done chances are

02:34:02.260 --> 02:34:05.820
I'll give my project down long before time to car comes out

02:34:06.860 --> 02:34:09.360
Say sorry Loki had to throw that shit out

02:34:09.740 --> 02:34:12.840
By the way, Bobby black will found you might want to link us to the website

02:34:12.840 --> 02:34:17.980
You got this from to Bobby, but he did find this whole can I sell my games created with RPG maker?

02:34:17.980 --> 02:34:19.740
Thank you for doing the research. I

02:34:19.740 --> 02:34:21.740
Couldn't do because I'm trying to talk to

02:34:22.020 --> 02:34:24.680
Our caller but can I sell my games?

02:34:24.680 --> 02:34:25.620
The answer is yes

02:34:25.620 --> 02:34:33.140
You can distribute games you created with RPG maker or IG maker using its included or add-on materials as freeware or commercial wear

02:34:33.140 --> 02:34:37.420
You're also add allowed to modify the materials with other software like Photoshop provided

02:34:37.420 --> 02:34:41.980
They are only used within RPG maker or IG maker software and not sold or distributed

02:34:41.980 --> 02:34:47.720
So anyway, Bobby linked an FAQ to you check it out and read it and I think all your concerns will be resolved

02:34:48.080 --> 02:34:53.800
All right, cool, thanks, I'll definitely walk into that you're welcome anybody listening podcast who's curious

02:34:53.800 --> 02:34:56.980
It's all part of their official website RPG maker web.com

02:34:58.680 --> 02:35:05.800
Well, thanks again, and I guess I'll clear up the line just in case act after someone else wants to call him no worries

02:35:06.520 --> 02:35:11.320
But have a nice night though. You too. Good luck with your game. See ya. Yep. Yep. Bye. Bye

02:35:11.800 --> 02:35:16.880
You know, I seem to remember years ago and I feel terrible because I forget the listeners name

02:35:16.920 --> 02:35:21.280
But he stopped listening some time ago. He made like a text adventure RPG

02:35:21.280 --> 02:35:24.280
Do you remember that somebody made a text adventure RPG?

02:35:24.280 --> 02:35:28.400
We actually had it on the olr website for a time and I played it and it was cute

02:35:28.400 --> 02:35:34.480
It wasn't even it wasn't even done in like twine because this show is so fucking old. I don't think twine existed yet

02:35:35.840 --> 02:35:37.840
Yeah, I just looked now

02:35:37.840 --> 02:35:43.040
Apparently I've gotten in a few of those RPG maker bundles because I have 2003 and VX ace. Yeah

02:35:44.040 --> 02:35:50.200
Yeah, I'm pretty I'm pretty sure at some point I would have picked one up to have like a game guru like his game

02:35:50.200 --> 02:35:56.160
Guru is like the shittiest like build your own game engine like a lot of shit. I mean, it's just shit

02:35:56.160 --> 02:36:00.400
Yeah, but you can make a first-person shooter game with it, but it'll be shit

02:36:00.400 --> 02:36:03.520
Should we do should we do an RPG maker game jam at some point?

02:36:04.280 --> 02:36:08.640
Sounds like a lot of hard that it's complicated. All right listeners

02:36:08.640 --> 02:36:13.080
Tell me RPGs are probably the hardest thing to make because they're very complicated

02:36:13.080 --> 02:36:18.840
Yeah, Bobby Black Wolf and chats is what we need to have another game jam. I actually yes, we do need another game

02:36:18.840 --> 02:36:23.600
I feel a little more encouraged or something like RPG maker than I do like or we could do like

02:36:23.600 --> 02:36:29.120
Would you do what like what they do down here in Sacramento with the IGDA is the progressive game jam?

02:36:29.120 --> 02:36:32.880
Well, it's a longer period of time like that you work on shit

02:36:32.880 --> 02:36:35.600
I bet you if we did want to actually do another game jam

02:36:35.600 --> 02:36:40.960
I bet those guys would support us a thousand percent. I bet they would it's like I would totally get in on their progressive game

02:36:40.960 --> 02:36:44.000
Jam stuff because that way I think we've been more motivating because you're with other people

02:36:44.320 --> 02:36:48.120
The problem is I can't meet every Saturday or yeah

02:36:48.120 --> 02:36:51.200
I'll I think they meet one Saturday a month, which isn't so bad

02:36:51.200 --> 02:36:54.480
But it's hard enough for me to get away from the house. So I

02:36:55.000 --> 02:37:00.160
Yeah, I get it. I get it. I would love to do something like that. I want to be motivated

02:37:00.160 --> 02:37:03.200
It's just it's hard like this week like actually the last two weeks

02:37:03.200 --> 02:37:07.480
It's been car shopping just car shopping car shopping car shopping. So that was

02:37:08.480 --> 02:37:14.520
Unfortunately, what's been taking up my time there? All right. Well, I think the I think the

02:37:14.960 --> 02:37:19.640
Skypline is dying. Nobody else is calling in but if you want to send us something after the fact

02:37:19.640 --> 02:37:23.480
