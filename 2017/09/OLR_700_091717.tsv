28000	32000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	34000	Hello my friends out there on the internet
34000	38000	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice
38000	44000	It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 700
44000	51000	That is 700 of our program for this September the 17th of 2017
51000	56000	My name is Rob Roberts here with my co-hosts in Studio N7
56000	61000	Based out of Sacramento, California here to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle
61000	64000	Hello hello, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers
64000	65000	Poop
65000	66000	How are you?
66000	67000	Poop
67000	68000	Woop? Woot?
68000	70000	That's all you have to say after 700 episodes?
70000	71000	I said poop
71000	72000	Oh poop?
72000	76000	Well I guess talking poop emojis are the rage this week so why not?
76000	77000	Oh my god
77000	79000	Nah I'm doing okay
79000	83000	I'm just looking at wish.com and this site is such a train wreck
83000	85000	What is that?
85000	88000	It's like where you can buy stuff for cheap and you really never know what you're gonna get
88000	90000	That sounds awful
90000	93000	First off I don't want to give them free advertising but that's
93000	94000	So wait you just
94000	96000	Am I hearing this right?
96000	101000	You give somebody money and you're saying give me a treat and you don't know what treat you're gonna get
101000	103000	No no no you pick you can pick the item
103000	104000	Oh okay
104000	113000	But it's like I've gotten like stuff for like very very drag things and cosplay stuff from here so
113000	119000	I was gonna say I could just imagine where it's like you know I give money and it's like I like Metroid and then they gift me
119000	121000	Oh you get a copy of Metroid Federation Force
121000	122000	No
122000	123000	No
123000	124000	That's not what I meant
124000	125000	That's not how it works
125000	126000	Okay good good
126000	130000	Also joining us of course as he does every week say hello to tech master Loki
130000	131000	Hello
131000	132000	Hi Loki how are you?
132000	133000	Fine
133000	135000	Yeah you went to a little show with the kid yesterday right?
135000	136000	Yeah
136000	137000	One of the kids
137000	142000	Went to this like it's like Disney on Ice for people that like superheroes I guess
142000	146000	But without the ice and so it's it's like a
146000	147000	Disney on pavement
147000	148000	Sort of
148000	159000	It's Marvel Universe Live so I tried to take my son to it a while ago when he was much younger and he was afraid so we took him again
159000	165000	And he sat through it and complained but he enjoyed it he says
165000	167000	I don't know
167000	169000	He may or may not have been being truthful
169000	175000	He's a little too old for like he's kind of like you know he knows that they're just people in costumes he's not really like you know
175000	177000	It's like okay I know
177000	181000	So he was too young before and now he's too old this time like it's really
181000	185000	Well he's very sensitive because like they have explosions and fireworks and stuff
185000	189000	Like you know stage effects you know little fire things and stuff
189000	195000	This year because I we didn't really watch last the last time it came through but
195000	199000	From what I saw online and what like the few five minutes that we were there
199000	204000	It was a lot more like elaborate stunts going on versus this year is very tame
204000	208000	Would it have been more exciting if it was on ice
208000	209000	No
209000	211000	It would have been weird
211000	212000	All right
212000	224000	And hello to all of you in our chat room because we do tape live every Sunday night at the voice geeks network vog network dot com six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show six ish Pacific
224000	231000	I think we're getting a start at 615 tonight because Bobby ran a little long but we don't mind because he always has us on at the end of his show so sometimes that's why it goes a little long
231000	236000	But you guys can chat along with us of course in our chat room at live dot vog network dot com
236000	240000	Where Mega Man X 400 starts us off tonight saying
240000	242000	Grats you old bitches
242000	245000	I can think of no better comment to start off tonight's show
245000	250000	Thank you very much and there's been a lot of kind words on Twitter and places like that
250000	253000	People saying congratulations on 700 episodes
253000	266000	I wish I could say we have a special great grand thing for you tonight but after 100 200 300 for it look I don't want to sound like that guy but I guess I am a little bit it's kind of like you get to a point where you're like
266000	273000	You know maybe we should just keep doing what works best and what keeps people coming to the show every week so we'll just kind of do our do our normal show
273000	276000	Or we procrastinate too long to plan a thing so fuck it
276000	283000	Yeah that too we got a little old we're a little slower to move now that we're older that's that's just the way it goes sometimes
283000	288000	But I really do truly want to thank you know those of you guys that do take the time out to listen to this show
288000	298000	Sometimes I see the tweets and emails and chat comments and stuff from people that say this has been a part of my Sunday night for 10 years 15 years you know even five years whatever
298000	307000	And I'm always really humbled that you know people have kind of made this a part of their Sunday nights as we have and I just really can't thank you guys enough
307000	316000	And some of you guys maybe have just recently discovered the show in the past few weeks and I think that's awesome too that you know people are still discovering this and deciding to try it out for a little while
316000	323000	So just you know big thanks all around I do want to of course give a couple other thank yous that are that are so important
324000	330000	I'm always afraid I'm going to miss people when I do these types of things but I know there's a few people that this show just would not be here without
330000	344000	I think I have to give a big big big big thank you and props to Jason or VX JasonXV not only does he do that intro that you hear every week without fail or without me like begging and pleading he just does it because he wants to and all that
344000	354000	But I mean a lot of the technical stuff like having a website to handle the traffic that will that large mp3 files generate like Jason's always taking care of us in that regard
354000	369000	So I again cannot really I cannot undersell the amount of the amount of stuff that Jason has done for Orange Launch Radio that the show just like would not be here if it wasn't for him so thank you so much for Jason
370000	379000	And of course I would have to give big big thank yous to Mr. Bobby Blackwolf he likes to call himself the opening act to Orange Launch Radio as he has been for many years
379000	397000	We like to think of it more as like a dual headliner act sort of thing but big thank you of course to Bobby just has been you know a partner in things like the Voice of Geeks Network and so forth and just very very like minded as to us as to why we're podcasting in the first place and what this whole thing is about so you know I can't really thank him enough
397000	413000	And of course my pal Travis who started under Station Live which in some ways this show is a spin off of in some ways so you know I can never say enough thanks to Travis for really really introducing me to the concept that any idiot can do this
413000	419000	Thank you Travis for being that idiot and exposing this to me and I say that with big hearts and thank yous
420000	435000	And yes as Tigerclaw points out in chat Travis is starting a brand new show yes I have heard the rumors I've heard the discussion on that I don't really know anything that you guys don't so I'm excited to hear that Travis is considering coming back to the radio
435000	444000	He's apparently considering coming back to Dragon Con so there's a lot I'm very excited about but I will let Travis talk about that when Travis is ready it's not really my place to
444000	458000	So there you go that's oh and I should of course I think one more person I have to say thank you that we don't thank enough is I have to say thank you to Midihead who does the intro to this show that you've heard for god a good 500 episodes now at least
458000	462000	Like that little opening riff that you've heard has been a part of this show for a long time
462000	463000	We don't have anybody else to remake it
463000	465000	Well I mean but there's
465000	467000	We had somebody and that fell through
467000	476000	It goes a long way to say that like we kind of don't need anybody the only reason we would do it is because then we sit here and realize sometimes you want to repaint the house
476000	480000	I'd take a new intro from Zircon
480000	496000	Well whoever whoever would be willing to do it we'll look at that but rest assured this Midihead intro we've had has worked for 500 episodes and that's great and you know he didn't charge us for it or anything he just did it because he knew that we were big supporters of music based games
496000	503000	Music based games and that he was a part of those at the time if you recognize that name he did some remixes that were in DDRXBox and I think he had a song in Beatmania
503000	513000	One of those crossed over to Beatmania 2DX at one point I think my memory is getting a little fuzzy at this point but I think one of his Sana remixes ended up in Beatmania 2DX at one point so there you go
513000	529000	Alright so as promised last week Dark Sakura got us a cake so what kind of oh she's taking a picture because that's what you do to food these days is you take pictures of it so I will try to describe it to you guys because she's actually got candles
529000	531000	700 candles
531000	536000	700 candles on this cake I kept telling Dark Sakura it's not our birthday
536000	537000	We got a butt cake
537000	538000	It is a butt cake
538000	539000	It's a bunt cake
539000	543000	Actually you need to talk about the cake while I take a picture and put it on the OLR twitter
543000	546000	And take one before and after the lights are lit
546000	560000	So anyway there is a place in Sacramento that I think they're actually all over the place but it's called Everything Bunt Cakes and I like them because they are a good company
560000	572000	They support many good charities and are fairly well they don't care who you like to shtup when it comes to making a cake I'll put it that way
572000	577000	Oh yes I forgot we have cake politics in this country but yes I mean it's important
577000	579000	So let the candle so we can take pictures of that too
579000	580000	Okay I will hold on
580000	581000	So it can be on fire
581000	584000	Well I have to post this on twitter it's very important you have to describe the cake
584000	586000	It is a chocolate bunt cake
586000	587000	Yes
587000	588000	8 inches
588000	589000	Yes
589000	590000	And
590000	591000	And it looks like an asshole
591000	595000	Like that's the other thing that's the other thing you're neglecting to say it looks like an asshole
595000	596000	It's a butt cake
596000	597000	It is a butt cake
597000	598000	It's a chocolate circle
598000	600000	It's a chocolate butt cake with white frosting on it
600000	607000	It's got frosting on the inside and then streams of like frosting tentacles coming out
607000	608000	Frosting tentacles
608000	610000	From the sphincter of the butt cake
610000	614000	It looks delicious and kind of gross at the same time
614000	624000	But I figured it's an occasion and occasions are always the best reason to have cake
624000	627000	Especially delicious semi pricey cake
627000	628000	So
628000	631000	I'm lighting candles there is fire in the OLR studio
631000	634000	Rob's extending fire from his grasped hands
634000	636000	These candles are hard to open
636000	638000	Fire is not very effective on those candles
638000	640000	Oh Rob
640000	642000	Okay can we try not to burn down the house though
642000	644000	Alright everybody get your pictures in
644000	646000	Hold on I gotta go and take
646000	648000	Yeah your turn
648000	651000	Seven almost looks like a one it might be confusing to some people
651000	654000	Okay who's blowing it out
654000	660000	This is the worst radio us trying to blow out a cake
660000	661000	Okay here we go
661000	662000	Make a wish
662000	663000	You can listen to us all blow
663000	664000	Make a wish here we go
664000	665000	One
665000	666000	Two
666000	667000	Five
667000	670000	I blew from over here I'm sure I was doing something
671000	673000	Yay
673000	676000	So see as we promised last episode there is indeed cake
676000	678000	Yes and it's all for us
678000	682000	Alright we'll try to get those pictures posted on the twitter shortly
682000	685000	But first it is a video game podcast believe it or not
685000	687000	So we should get into some gaming topics
687000	689000	There was a lot of Nintendo news this week
689000	692000	Loki did you take a minute to watch the Nintendo direct that happened this week
692000	695000	Yeah I did it was alright
695000	698000	I mean they talked a lot about different things coming out
698000	703000	There wasn't really a whole lot of surprising stuff except for I think you know the whole minecraft thing coming to 3DS
703000	707000	Say hey by the way minecraft is coming to 3DS and it's out now
707000	709000	Go check it out I mean so that was pretty big
709000	711000	That little it's out now surprise was cute
711000	718000	I mean that's pretty major and at least digitally they're going to release a physical version not too far away from now
718000	723000	Then they just a lot of announcements of different things in the pipeline
723000	731000	So for example they talked about Skyrim and how they have it dated now when it's going to be coming out
731000	739000	And then of course they were saying that along with that they're also announcing that Doom is going to get a port to the Switch as well
739000	748000	And even Wolfenstein 2 the new colossus will be coming so lots of stuff which is pretty cool
748000	754000	Yeah that's what Bob Coffee in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says the big story is Doom on Switch
754000	757000	And Dungeon Buster says Wolf 2 coming to the Switch was surprising
757000	760000	And I would agree I thought those were kind of the biggest headlines from the whole event for me
760000	764000	Is that how Bethesda is really you know supporting the Switch in a big way
764000	768000	When we haven't had Skyrim go on sale yet
768000	773000	And I don't know about you guys but I'm not expecting Skyrim to perform super well
773000	779000	But maybe maybe I'm underestimating the power of people that only buy Nintendo consoles
779000	785000	You know maybe or the fact that sure enough they did put in a little homage to Zelda in it
785000	787000	You know with the amiibo
787000	789000	Did you notice the fine print I might add
789000	790000	Uh oh
790000	794000	So there is fine print here just in case if you think that you need to purchase certain things
794000	796000	You know the amiibo stuff that they have for Zelda
796000	798000	Oh they're elsewhere in the game right
798000	799000	Yes
799000	801000	They said that in the direct they did say that in the direct
801000	803000	They said it was they would be in dungeons
803000	807000	So you don't necessarily feel that you have to go purchase those amiibos
807000	811000	You can still unlock the stuff so I think that's nice that they're doing that
811000	814000	Instead of locking stuff behind a paywall type thing
814000	819000	Um I'm curious to see though how it's gonna run and what it's gonna look like
819000	822000	Cause I feel that with like especially Wolfenstein and stuff
822000	826000	I'm wondering what kind of a downgrade we're gonna get on those
826000	831000	Well some of the folks were looking at Doom and comparing it to Playstation 4
831000	833000	And saying you don't really notice it
833000	838000	So that's especially considering you can pick it up and go on portable that's pretty exciting
838000	840000	Yeah so that'd be cool
840000	843000	Lots of lots of 3DS stuff as well
843000	846000	I mean even still we can talk about the Switch as well
846000	848000	So just kind of some of the stuff
848000	850000	Lots of remakes I've been noticing
850000	853000	And you know kind of one of the things I was worried about even with the Switch was that
853000	856000	Oh shit there's gonna be a lot of stuff that they're just gonna kind of remaster
856000	860000	But even that's kind of going along with um
860000	862000	Even with the 3DS and stuff
862000	867000	So you got like Mario and Luigi Superstar Saga being remade that's coming out October 6
867000	870000	Um you know they're talking a little bit about you know
870000	873000	They have uh what is it?
873000	877000	Kirby Battle Royale now is a new thing that's gonna be coming to the 3DS
877000	879000	Yep so 3DS is still going
879000	882000	A new orange 2DS XL
882000	888000	Um there's of course Mario Party they're doing a top 100 best minigames
888000	890000	And that's coming out on 3DS which
890000	893000	I was like why isn't that on the Switch?
893000	896000	Like that should be a Switch game I would think
896000	898000	Well that's what a lot of people are saying about the new Metroid game
898000	901000	Which I'll you know I'll talk about the new Metroid game a little later
901000	903000	Cause you bet your ass I played that this week
903000	906000	And um you know I'll get into it during our gaming weeks
906000	909000	But I know there's been some people I've seen on Twitter that have said
909000	912000	I'm not buying this on the 3DS cause I'm waiting for the Switch version
912000	916000	And I don't know if there's gonna be a Switch version I gotta say
916000	917000	Like I
917000	920000	They're gonna at some point gonna get desperate for content
920000	922000	And you're gonna see a lot of ports of stuff
922000	924000	I mean cause we've already seen that for the Wii U
924000	926000	I don't know I just and I
926000	929000	Look I was as much as anybody else saying
929000	931000	Nintendo needs to just bury the 3DS
931000	934000	And fully invest in Switch at this point
934000	936000	But Nintendo clearly does not want to do that
936000	937000	For whatever the reasons
937000	938000	Just indecisive
938000	940000	Yeah well I don't know if it's just indecisive
940000	944000	As much as they're like well we still have all these 3DSs that are everywhere
944000	947000	So we can make software that can still sell to all these
947000	949000	You know millions of people that have them
949000	952000	While we still face the hardware challenges with the Switch
952000	954000	And something else to just think about
954000	956000	You know that may be coming into play
956000	958000	Is that we do have to remember that
958000	961000	Nintendo exists in more countries than just
961000	962000	You know the US and Canada
962000	964000	You know and even Japan
964000	967000	Except Brazil cause that's where the Sega Master System is still alive
967000	970000	Well okay but you say that tongue in cheek
970000	971000	But in reality
971000	974000	Maybe there's something about the fact that the 3DS
974000	976000	With as old as that system is
976000	979000	Is much easier to get in other countries
979000	981000	That aren't usually the ones that get the first wave of games
981000	984000	No one's saying that they don't have to develop for the 3DS
984000	986000	I'm just saying why wouldn't they develop for both systems
986000	988000	I would think that that would be a title that would
988000	991000	You know do well on the Switch
991000	992000	I mean
992000	994000	It probably would but I will say this
994000	996000	The Metroid you know not to spoil my gaming too bad
996000	997000	But I'm going to
997000	1003000	The Metroid game on 3DS has the best 3D on the system
1003000	1004000	Period
1004000	1005000	That I've seen
1005000	1008000	So it's weird because I thought at one point
1008000	1011000	Nintendo was moving away from 3D
1011000	1015000	With these 2DS's and the fact that it was barely in Pokemon Sun and Moon
1015000	1018000	3D for the Minecraft works pretty well too
1018000	1021000	Yeah but the 3D in this new Metroid game
1021000	1023000	Is pretty fucking mind blowing
1023000	1024000	Like it's really good
1024000	1027000	And it's what makes it work
1027000	1030000	It's the right amount of 3D
1030000	1031000	It's a 2D game
1031000	1034000	But it does 3D effects when it needs to
1034000	1035000	That work really well
1035000	1037000	So there is that
1037000	1039000	So and if you put that on the Switch
1039000	1040000	You're not going to have the same 3D effects
1040000	1042000	Of course you can play this Metroid game in 2D mode
1042000	1044000	And probably still get as much out of it
1044000	1046000	That's not going to you know like if you're like
1046000	1048000	I don't like 3D or I can't see 3D
1048000	1050000	I still think you'll get a lot of the Metroid game
1050000	1052000	But I mean for those that do enjoy the 3D
1052000	1054000	Like this game does it very well
1054000	1057000	The other thing was for the Switch
1057000	1060000	Of course they talked a little bit about Xenoblade Chronicles 2
1060000	1062000	Which will be coming out in December
1062000	1064000	Snipperclips is getting a new release
1064000	1067000	And they're getting new DLC
1067000	1070000	So it's kind of like a game of the year edition
1070000	1071000	A remaster
1071000	1074000	Not a remaster but it's like kind of like you know
1074000	1077000	The bundle with the DLC thing that's going to be coming out
1077000	1080000	So that's something Project Octopath Traveler
1080000	1082000	Which looks pretty cool
1082000	1088000	It's kind of how I think they should do all the 2D RPGs honestly
1088000	1091000	That was another one of those today surprises with the demo
1091000	1094000	I didn't get to play the demo yet
1094000	1096000	I'm hearing really positive things about it
1096000	1098000	I just haven't gotten around to it myself yet sadly
1098000	1104000	Of course they announced along with the new trailer for Super Mario Odyssey
1104000	1107000	That they have a Super Mario Odyssey Switch bundle
1107000	1109000	That's going to be coming to Red Joy-Cons
1109000	1111000	At the end of October
1111000	1117000	And then they showed off some new worlds for Mario Odyssey
1117000	1119000	Which looks alright
1119000	1123000	Dragon Quest Builders was something that's going to be coming to the Switch in the spring
1123000	1126000	So lots of stuff kind of announced
1126000	1130000	A lot of it thankfully was for this year
1130000	1132000	But I don't know
1132000	1135000	I was hoping for some more new announcements
1136000	1138000	I know they're going to end with Mario
1138000	1141000	Well you got to be careful with these directs
1141000	1144000	Don't ever set your expectations too high
1144000	1146000	Because you're only going to leave disappointed
1146000	1148000	I'm sure there were a lot of us that were thinking
1148000	1150000	Oh this is what they're going to do
1150000	1151000	I did, I will say this
1151000	1154000	I was expecting they were going to announce a Bayonetta remaster
1154000	1156000	To go with the rumors we were hearing about last week
1156000	1158000	With the Playstation 4 and Xbox One and all that
1158000	1160000	That didn't happen
1160000	1161000	And that was a little disappointing
1161000	1162000	But then I have to go
1162000	1164000	Rob don't set your expectations
1164000	1166000	Because they're never going to be met
1166000	1168000	That's just the way Nintendo works
1168000	1170000	I think a lot of people
1170000	1172000	Way too many people were hedging bets on
1172000	1174000	Smash 4 being announced
1174000	1176000	Smash for Switch being announced
1176000	1178000	Now was not the time to do that
1178000	1180000	Maybe Tokyo Game Show
1180000	1182000	Although Nintendo doesn't participate in Tokyo Game Show
1182000	1184000	That doesn't mean they won't participate in the news cycle
1184000	1186000	That comes that same week
1186000	1188000	But we'll see
1188000	1192000	Nintendo announced a system in January
1192000	1194000	Which was not what people usually do
1194000	1198000	So Nintendo clearly marches to the beat of their own drummer
1198000	1200000	Who may or may not have rhythm
1200000	1202000	And it works for them
1202000	1204000	So bless their hearts
1204000	1207000	But you forgot the biggest thing that came out of the Direct Logie
1207000	1210000	You forgot the biggest thing that set Twitter ablaze
1210000	1212000	Mario's titties
1212000	1216000	That was the thing that everybody is talking about on Twitter
1216000	1218000	Which even, I got to admit
1218000	1220000	Even I'm looking at this going
1220000	1222000	What's the big deal?
1222000	1224000	What is the big deal
1224000	1226000	About Mario's titties?
1226000	1228000	That's the thing, the big deal is
1228000	1230000	It wasn't necessarily this
1230000	1232000	That was a big deal
1232000	1234000	Other characters
1234000	1236000	I think it was from Fire Emblem
1236000	1238000	Or something else that had some sort of swimsuit
1238000	1240000	Costume thing
1240000	1242000	They had basically
1242000	1244000	Censored the nipples out of it
1244000	1246000	Like male nipples
1246000	1248000	In the US
1248000	1250000	For some reason
1250000	1252000	I don't know why
1252000	1254000	I really don't care
1254000	1256000	But it's like, why
1256000	1258000	Why did you do that?
1258000	1260000	It's such a weird thing
1260000	1262000	People don't like seeing nipples
1262000	1264000	But Mario, they're just like
1264000	1266000	Flipping out
1266000	1268000	Jamie, did you get a look at Mario's titties?
1268000	1270000	For five seconds I was like, okay
1270000	1272000	Who cares?
1272000	1274000	Apparently people with no life
1274000	1276000	Apparently the entire internet
1277000	1279000	I just
1279000	1281000	I was just surprised that Mario shaves his chest
1281000	1283000	That was the thing that struck me
1283000	1285000	As most like, wow, he manscapes
1285000	1287000	Apparently
1287000	1289000	Is something that he does, so there you go
1289000	1291000	Well it would have been very awkward if it was just like
1291000	1293000	Fucking Ron Jeremy type shit
1293000	1295000	Well somebody
1295000	1297000	There was some tweet floating around where somebody actually
1297000	1299000	Photoshopped all the chest hair into it
1299000	1301000	Of course there is
1301000	1303000	I was like, that looks a little more realistic
1303000	1305000	But whatever
1307000	1309000	To register participation for this week's episode of
1309000	1311000	Orange Challenge Radio at vognetwork.com
1311000	1313000	Use the passphrase, bucket
1313000	1316000	Going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com
1316000	1318000	MegaManX400 says
1318000	1320000	Mark my words
1320000	1322000	Smash 4 is coming
1322000	1324000	They're waiting to announce their online first
1324000	1326000	And Act F says at this point we'll probably see Smash 5
1326000	1328000	Oh, thank you for reminding me
1328000	1330000	That was the other thing that was sorely missing
1330000	1332000	From this
1332000	1334000	Where the fuck is the Virtual Console?
1334000	1336000	Where the fuck is whatever else we're calling it?
1336000	1338000	Where the fuck is the online?
1338000	1340000	No mention of that whatsoever
1340000	1342000	I think expecting that to come out
1342000	1344000	In 2017, you might as well forget it
1344000	1346000	I do think at this point
1346000	1348000	We will hear about it in January of 2018
1348000	1350000	I think
1350000	1352000	Virtual Console is not something
1352000	1354000	We're going to hear about this year
1354000	1356000	Get over it or don't
1356000	1358000	I mean they had other things they announced
1358000	1360000	Regarding that stuff, so they have like
1360000	1362000	The arcade stuff
1362000	1364000	That's sort of like Virtual Console
1364000	1366000	But it's not Virtual Console
1366000	1368000	It's just arcade versions
1368000	1370000	I'm with you on that
1370000	1372000	That shit's a little weird
1372000	1374000	The arcade archive things
1374000	1376000	I mean, don't get me wrong
1376000	1378000	I love the original Mario Brothers
1378000	1380000	I think it's really underrated
1380000	1382000	As an arcade classic
1382000	1384000	Because it's something that's really, really fun
1384000	1386000	Two player mode
1386000	1388000	And remember that game is really old
1388000	1390000	The original Mario Brothers is a very, very old game
1390000	1392000	You know, the animals that come out of the pipes
1392000	1394000	And that was a lot of fun
1394000	1396000	With two people, because that was one of the first games
1396000	1398000	That I really remember from the back of the day
1398000	1400000	Where you could really screw your friends
1400000	1402000	Like playing that game, right?
1402000	1404000	They could be running to get a crab
1404000	1406000	And you knock the floor to make the crab awake again
1406000	1408000	And kill your friend
1408000	1410000	I remember that game is great
1410000	1412000	And I think a really good addition
1412000	1414000	As much as we've seen that game
1414000	1416000	A lot from Nintendo over the years
1416000	1418000	Because every time they did a
1418000	1420000	Super Mario Brothers Advance
1420000	1422000	Or whatever that series
1422000	1424000	That game was included one way or another
1424000	1426000	But I think it's a good thing to kind of have on the Switch
1426000	1428000	However, where things kind of
1428000	1430000	Start to get weird with that
1430000	1432000	Was when they start talking about the whole
1432000	1434000	Yeah, like Super Mario Brothers versus
1434000	1436000	Which, okay, for those that don't know
1436000	1438000	When they had that Pay Choice 10
1438000	1440000	Which was like the Nintendo in the arcade
1440000	1442000	With games already loaded onto it
1442000	1444000	A lot of times
1444000	1446000	You would have
1446000	1448000	Versus Super Mario Brothers
1448000	1450000	Or Versus Excitebike
1450000	1452000	I think was one of the other ones
1452000	1454000	And basically what it was, it was the same game
1454000	1456000	But it was harder
1456000	1458000	And I think with Versus Super Mario Brothers
1458000	1460000	I think, I want to say
1460000	1462000	It's more like the second quest
1462000	1464000	Of Mario Brothers
1464000	1466000	Where the turtles are all the beetle guys instead
1466000	1468000	And I feel like there's
1468000	1470000	Some things that are removed
1470000	1472000	To make some of the jumps harder
1472000	1474000	There's just very subtle changes in the game
1474000	1476000	On levels 2, I think might have been a thing
1476000	1478000	Somebody in chat might know the difference
1478000	1480000	Yeah, it is pretty minor
1480000	1482000	All things considered
1482000	1484000	So it is weird that that is coming
1484000	1486000	When we still don't know about the virtual console
1486000	1488000	Plans for just regular Super Mario Brothers
1488000	1490000	But then there was a lot of other games in that montage
1490000	1492000	They talked about Versus Pinball
1492000	1494000	Versus Clu Clu Land
1494000	1496000	I'm sorry, but that's really
1496000	1498000	Offloading the dump truck
1498000	1500000	Is that them trying to double dip
1500000	1502000	On that shit, so it's basically
1502000	1504000	They're trying to release this shit now
1504000	1506000	It's not exactly the NES stuff
1506000	1508000	But you may just buy it because you're tired of waiting
1508000	1510000	And then they announce this new paid service
1510000	1512000	And then you're like, okay we'll do that too
1512000	1514000	And they get you twice
1514000	1516000	Yes and no
1516000	1518000	The double dipping thing wouldn't surprise me at all
1518000	1520000	But if it's true
1520000	1522000	That you're going to be paying
1522000	1524000	For this Nintendo online
1524000	1526000	And with it you will get certain games
1526000	1528000	Like free or whatever
1528000	1530000	I would imagine that Super Mario Brothers
1530000	1532000	Will be one of those games
1532000	1534000	And so you're not going to have to double dip so to speak
1534000	1536000	Because one of them you'll pay for with this arcade archives
1536000	1538000	The other one will be included
1538000	1540000	With your soul
1540000	1542000	With Nintendo's online thing
1542000	1544000	So that's my thought
1544000	1546000	But I don't know
1546000	1548000	Yeah, I mean
1548000	1550000	I'll probably buy Mario Brothers
1550000	1552000	It depends on the price
1552000	1554000	If they want way too much money for it then I won't
1554000	1556000	But I'll probably buy the Mario Brothers
1556000	1558000	And the Versus Super Mario Brothers
1558000	1560000	Stuff like Versus Clu Clu Land
1560000	1562000	That shit's a stretch
1562000	1564000	Was it Versus Pinball?
1564000	1566000	Nintendo Pinball
1566000	1568000	There was better
1568000	1570000	There was better Pinball on the NES
1570000	1572000	Than Nintendo Pinball
1572000	1574000	Nintendo Pinball was an early title
1574000	1576000	But it was before Pinbot
1576000	1578000	And Roller Ball
1578000	1580000	What were the other big Pinball games on Nintendo?
1580000	1582000	There's another one I'm trying to think of
1582000	1584000	Pinball Quest
1584000	1586000	That game wasn't actually good
1586000	1588000	It was just a good idea
1588000	1590000	They just need to seriously at this point
1590000	1592000	Just mark that shit
1592000	1594000	I mean they've made their money back
1594000	1596000	A ton like
1596000	1598000	Many dozens
1598000	1600000	Hundreds of times over already
1600000	1602000	Just drop that shit
1602000	1604000	Down to where it's like impulsive
1604000	1606000	Bundling by that's just like
1606000	1608000	Oh shit you know that's like 99 cents
1608000	1610000	You'd sell like a ton of that shit
1610000	1612000	Even stuff that's like garbage
1612000	1614000	Like NES Pinball
1614000	1616000	Paying 5 fucking dollars for that shit
1616000	1618000	I bought Balloon Fight for 30 cents on Wii U
1618000	1620000	Exactly that's a price
1620000	1622000	That would be worth it
1622000	1624000	I would buy it and you know it may not be
1624000	1626000	Something I'm interested in but I'd buy it because
1626000	1628000	It ain't 30 cents
1628000	1630000	I still have Animal Crossing for GameCube
1630000	1632000	Exactly that is the fucking Nintendo
1632000	1634000	I liked where it's like hey
1634000	1636000	Enjoy our classic games
1636000	1638000	Hey guess what you purchase that game
1638000	1640000	The Game Boy Advance version of this Metroid game
1640000	1642000	You can link it up or you know
1642000	1644000	Game Boy Advance some version of
1644000	1646000	You know Metroid or something
1646000	1648000	You can hook up your
1648000	1650000	Game Boy Advance and you can
1650000	1652000	Play the original Metroid on or something
1652000	1654000	That is how you do it
1654000	1656000	You've made your money back on those
1656000	1658000	Stop trying to pretend they're still worth
1658000	1660000	5 dollars
1660000	1662000	They're fucking old I get it
1662000	1664000	People still like them
1664000	1666000	But you cannot say that
1666000	1668000	This game is still worth 5 fucking dollars
1668000	1670000	Again
1670000	1672000	Like after I bought it dozens of times
1672000	1674000	Alright one other thing
1674000	1676000	I want to say about the Nintendo Direct
1676000	1678000	That I think will be worth 60 dollars
1678000	1680000	Xenoblade Chronicles 2
1680000	1682000	I just want to make sure I get that out there
1682000	1684000	I really enjoyed what I saw from that game
1684000	1686000	And I look forward to playing it on the Switch
1686000	1688000	That is true
1688000	1690000	But their presentation was
1690000	1692000	Fucking boring
1692000	1694000	That was the most boring fucking
1694000	1696000	Presentation
1696000	1698000	I got what I needed out of it
1698000	1700000	I was fine I don't always need somebody
1700000	1702000	That's like super hyped up
1702000	1704000	It's just like the explaining like
1704000	1706000	Just the gameplay
1706000	1708000	Explaining it
1708000	1710000	How would you have explained it Loki?
1710000	1712000	Show me a fucking trailer done
1712000	1714000	Not just sit there explaining
1714000	1716000	Here's some fucking fire and there's robots and bang
1716000	1718000	Just show an extended trailer
1718000	1720000	Instead of fucking explaining about
1720000	1722000	This system you do this and this system
1722000	1724000	This happens and you have these classes
1724000	1726000	And blah blah blah
1726000	1728000	That's fucking boring
1756000	1758000	Next month before the holiday but I guess
1758000	1760000	What would be the point?
1760000	1762000	There's nothing really left to explain
1762000	1764000	They've detailed all their holiday releases
1764000	1766000	I would have liked little treats here
1766000	1768000	Mario Odyssey amiibo announcements which they did by the way
1768000	1770000	Announced more amiibos for that shit
1770000	1772000	Big surprise
1772000	1774000	I think they're gonna wait till January to just talk about next year at this point
1774000	1776000	I think that's probably
1776000	1778000	Probably it
1778000	1780000	Alright
1780000	1782000	Anyway
1782000	1784000	That's pretty much all we're gonna say about Nintendo Direct
1784000	1786000	What are your gaming weeks?
1786000	1788000	The types of video games we have been playing this week
1788000	1790000	Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
1790000	1792000	What have you been playing this week?
1792000	1794000	I downloaded Ragnarok
1794000	1796000	Online for Steam
1796000	1798000	I started playing Ragnarok Online again
1798000	1800000	Did it go free to play?
1800000	1802000	Wow
1802000	1804000	Talk about blast from the past
1804000	1806000	Is anyone moderating the game?
1806000	1808000	I'm sure there's mods
1808000	1810000	They changed the whole
1810000	1812000	Introductory level
1812000	1814000	It kinda is crappy
1814000	1816000	I might go back and find another free server
1816000	1818000	That does the old style RO
1818000	1820000	I don't know
1820000	1822000	But that whole thing started
1822000	1824000	Because thanks to Tiara
1824000	1826000	I downloaded this game called
1826000	1828000	Idle Pouring on my iPhone
1828000	1830000	Which is basically
1830000	1832000	You're just running the whole time
1832000	1834000	Killing things
1834000	1836000	Then you level while it's idle
1836000	1838000	And then you can do the daily quests and PvP
1838000	1840000	It's a fucking clicker game?
1840000	1842000	That's the first one that finally drew me in
1842000	1844000	Good job
1844000	1846000	Rama in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says
1846000	1848000	Wasn't Ragnarok Online free to play
1848000	1850000	For years on Steam?
1850000	1852000	News to me
1852000	1854000	I didn't even care to look before this
1854000	1856000	I haven't exactly followed Ragnarok Online
1856000	1858000	I played RO2 on Steam before I played it
1858000	1860000	I still have that picture of
1860000	1862000	Both of our characters
1862000	1864000	And you with your little mage with the ribbon in his hair
1864000	1866000	That was great
1866000	1868000	MXC wants to know the name of this again
1868000	1870000	Idle Pouring
1870000	1872000	P O R I N G
1872000	1874000	Ideally?
1874000	1876000	Not like American Idol
1876000	1878000	It's pretty fun
1878000	1880000	I've been enjoying it
1880000	1882000	Can we not?
1882000	1884000	It is
1884000	1886000	And can we not?
1886000	1888000	I also got Hive Swap
1888000	1890000	Which is the homestuck game
1890000	1892000	That we've been fucking waiting for
1892000	1894000	It was really good
1894000	1896000	It was pretty short but it's just the first episode
1896000	1902000	And it's all point and click goodness with cutscenes
1902000	1904000	And it has everything
1904000	1906000	A point and click game fan
1906000	1908000	Would want plus homestuck
1908000	1910000	And
1910000	1912000	I spent the whole first part
1912000	1914000	Analyzing every scene
1914000	1916000	You can look at the pictures
1916000	1918000	In everyone's houses slash their hives
1918000	1920000	Because trolls live in hives
1920000	1922000	And you can
1922000	1924000	There's certain
1924000	1926000	There's certain
1926000	1928000	Places that indicate where this fits in continuity
1928000	1934000	And although I did then go back and like completely reread almost the entire homestuck wiki
1934000	1938000	Just to make sure that I had my head straight as to what universe this was
1938000	1940000	Because there are many universes
1940000	1942000	So
1942000	1944000	It was really good
1944000	1946000	I'm gonna play it again
1946000	1948000	Alright
1948000	1950000	And of course Pokemon Go
1950000	1952000	Miitomo
1952000	1954000	The usual
1954000	1956000	Blah
1956000	1958000	Alright then Loki
1958000	1960000	How was your gaming week?
1960000	1962000	I didn't play a whole ton of stuff
1962000	1964000	I finished the Lego movie video game
1964000	1966000	On PC
1966000	1968000	Because
1968000	1970000	I don't know
1970000	1972000	I like that movie
1972000	1974000	The game's alright
1974000	1976000	And then now I'm just kind of doing the 100% stuff
1976000	1978000	It's just kind of
1978000	1980000	I don't know it's a mindless game
1980000	1982000	Just some mobile clicker stuff
1982000	1984000	I'm kind of getting out of it
1984000	1986000	But I did play that this week
1986000	1988000	It's still the office space one
1990000	1992000	I don't know, that's it
1992000	1994000	I didn't really play any console stuff, thought about it
1994000	1996000	Just haven't gotten around to it
1996000	1998000	I need to play VR
1998000	2000000	I purchased a while back
2000000	2002000	I think she's a while back now
2002000	2004000	Superhot VR and I do want to try that
2004000	2006000	Oh I saw that game
2006000	2008000	I didn't really play it myself
2008000	2010000	But I saw it at Dragon Con because Bobby brought it
2010000	2012000	And one of his buddies was playing it
2012000	2014000	It looked neat, I like the whole concept of
2014000	2016000	Things only move when you're actually moving
2016000	2018000	I thought that was kind of neat
2018000	2020000	This is what it would be like to be in the matrix
2020000	2022000	What's great about those
2022000	2024000	After you do play that
2024000	2026000	Because you can play it very slowly
2026000	2028000	You can play it back at full speed when you're done
2028000	2030000	Like an instant replay
2030000	2032000	So it's like fucking John Woo shit
2032000	2034000	You're tossing the guns up in the air
2034000	2036000	That's rad, I like that
2036000	2038000	What's great though is I've seen some play throughs online
2038000	2040000	And there's different scenes
2040000	2042000	That kind of teleport you to different areas
2042000	2044000	So if you've played it enough and you know where those are
2044000	2046000	You can throw your guns to yourself
2046000	2048000	In the next area, which is great
2048000	2050000	So you'll throw an Uzi into the air
2050000	2052000	And you hop to the next scene
2052000	2054000	And catch it and then just shoot the guy in the face
2054000	2056000	It's just awesome
2056000	2058000	All the different options there
2058000	2060000	So yeah, I'm gonna
2060000	2062000	Probably have to check that out
2062000	2064000	Once again, I'm getting them in the Lego
2064000	2066000	Stuff they like watching Ninjago
2066000	2068000	Which I thought when I first saw that
2068000	2070000	It looked stupid, but the Ninjago movie
2070000	2072000	Is coming out and with that they have a game
2072000	2074000	So maybe I'll pick that up
2074000	2076000	If they have the Lego Marvel 2 then I'll be
2076000	2078000	Picking up later
2078000	2080000	I don't know, it's been Lego
2080000	2082000	Obsessive in my household
2082000	2084000	Lately, mainly which is me
2084000	2086000	Alright, my gaming week
2086000	2088000	After last week's show I played
2088000	2090000	Some Mighty No. 9 live on stream
2090000	2092000	So I got out a lot of my thoughts
2092000	2094000	During the stream
2094000	2096000	I liked it more than I thought I would
2096000	2098000	I think in the Mega Man
2098000	2100000	Wars
2100000	2102000	Or whatever you want to call it on Steam right now
2102000	2104000	I think I preferred 20XDX overall
2104000	2106000	But I did really like
2106000	2108000	Mighty No. 9 enough
2108000	2110000	It was hard
2110000	2112000	The first time I played through I was getting killed a lot
2112000	2114000	And I was getting really frustrated
2114000	2116000	Because I had to go all the way back
2116000	2118000	But then when I really was thinking about it
2118000	2120000	I was like this was part of what the original
2120000	2122000	Mega Man games were all about
2122000	2124000	You have to memorize patterns
2124000	2126000	And even the people that were watching were noticing
2126000	2128000	The second time I went through this level
2128000	2130000	I did way better and I beat it
2130000	2132000	Because this time I knew exactly what to expect
2132000	2134000	And it was completely different that time
2134000	2136000	I don't know
2136000	2138000	The game lacks a certain polish
2138000	2140000	I think in a way
2140000	2142000	It was fine enough
2142000	2144000	I can understand where
2144000	2146000	Fans get a little frustrated
2146000	2148000	The internet in general kind of shits on that game
2148000	2150000	A little more than it deserves
2150000	2152000	I suppose the whole Kickstarter element puts it in a unique category
2152000	2154000	But it's well enough
2154000	2156000	And that game you can catch it on sale
2156000	2158000	Here and there and everywhere
2158000	2160000	So if you find it
2160000	2162000	At a price that you're willing to pay for it
2162000	2164000	Then go for it!
2164000	2166000	Other games that I played this week
2166000	2168000	I played
2168000	2170000	With my new 3DS
2170000	2172000	I finally
2172000	2174000	Was convinced to buy a new 3DS
2174000	2176000	And you know what convinced me to finally buy a new 3DS?
2176000	2178000	All they had to do
2178000	2180000	Was to put Samus on it
2180000	2182000	That's exactly what they did
2182000	2184000	And as soon as they put Samus on it
2184000	2186000	I bought it
2186000	2188000	So I bought that new 3DS with Samus
2188000	2190000	So I had to do a transfer
2190000	2192000	And I learned some things doing a transfer
2192000	2194000	So I had the Link Between Worlds
2194000	2196000	DS before
2196000	2198000	So I had a 32GB
2198000	2200000	SD memory card in that thing
2200000	2202000	But unfortunately it's not as easy
2202000	2204000	As putting your 32GB
2204000	2206000	SD card into your
2206000	2208000	New 3DS
2208000	2210000	Why? Because the new 3DS
2210000	2212000	Takes micro
2212000	2214000	SD cards
2214000	2216000	So I had to buy a 32GB micro
2216000	2218000	SD card
2218000	2220000	Those are like 10 bucks now you can get those dirt cheap
2220000	2222000	I got one on Amazon Now
2222000	2224000	Because I was like I don't want to leave the house
2224000	2226000	It's Friday, Amazon Now fucking delivered one here in two hours
2226000	2228000	Like that
2228000	2230000	That's the pinnacle of laziness
2230000	2232000	I was like
2232000	2234000	I'm not putting pants on god dammit
2234000	2236000	That's pretty sweet
2236000	2238000	So anyway
2238000	2240000	So there was that
2240000	2242000	So finally that gets delivered
2242000	2244000	I'm like okay well I'll do this transfer
2244000	2246000	Now yes before I get the emails and the chat comments
2246000	2248000	I'm aware you can do a PC transfer
2248000	2250000	You can do a PC based transfer
2250000	2252000	And in retrospect that is exactly what I should have done
2252000	2254000	I should have also ordered an SD
2254000	2256000	Card reader via USB
2256000	2258000	Because my computer doesn't have one anymore
2258000	2260000	My new one doesn't
2260000	2262000	I should have ordered one of those damn card readers
2262000	2264000	And did it that way
2264000	2266000	Because I did it DS to DS
2266000	2268000	The transfer, it took
2268000	2270000	I started it at 7 PM
2270000	2272000	Do you know when the transfer finished finally?
2272000	2274000	4 AM
2274000	2276000	Is when the transfer finished
2276000	2278000	Now in retrospect I would have
2278000	2280000	Purged, well for one
2280000	2282000	I know that 32GB card was not full
2282000	2284000	Like it's probably not even a quarter full
2284000	2286000	Do I have a lot of shit on my 3DS?
2286000	2288000	Yes, but you can fit a lot in 32GB
2288000	2290000	Of DS software
2290000	2292000	In retrospect
2292000	2294000	I would have deleted
2294000	2296000	Every single demo off of my old
2296000	2298000	3DS before I started the transfer
2298000	2300000	Now see since space was never a concern
2300000	2302000	I never really deleted the demos
2302000	2304000	They were just kind of sitting there
2304000	2306000	But I should have got rid of them
2306000	2308000	The DS thing warned me that it would take 4 hours
2308000	2310000	To do the transfer, it took 9
2310000	2312000	Okay so it finally finished at 4 AM
2312000	2314000	So
2314000	2316000	I was a little frustrated by that
2316000	2318000	But finally, whatever, it was done
2318000	2320000	Over
2320000	2322000	And then finally I got to sit down and play
2322000	2324000	Metroid Samus Returns
2324000	2326000	On my new Samus 3DS
2326000	2328000	And it's great
2328000	2330000	I'm so happy Nintendo
2330000	2332000	Just in time for Loki's birthday
2332000	2334000	And to celebrate episode 700 of our program
2334000	2336000	Decided to release a new Metroid game
2336000	2338000	The way Metroid ought to be
2338000	2340000	2D
2340000	2342000	But with 3D flair in it
2342000	2344000	And as I mentioned earlier
2344000	2346000	The 3D in this game works very well
2346000	2348000	It's not a 3D Metroid
2348000	2350000	It's a 2D Metroid
2350000	2352000	But the 3D elements work very well
2352000	2354000	I realized they outsource the development of this game
2354000	2356000	To a company in Spain
2356000	2358000	And I don't remember the name of it right now
2358000	2360000	Do you remember the name?
2360000	2362000	Somebody in chat will yell it out here in a minute
2362000	2364000	But they did a good job
2364000	2366000	My understanding is that they had some Castlevania titles
2366000	2368000	Previously that were kind of it
2368000	2370000	Which goes to show you
2370000	2372000	I mean we saw this with Retro Studios
2372000	2374000	Even before
2374000	2376000	I don't know if they were
2376000	2378000	I would assume that they were independent from Nintendo
2378000	2380000	Before they kind of brought on as a second party
2380000	2382000	But
2382000	2384000	Other companies can develop your properties
2384000	2386000	For you and do a great job on it
2386000	2388000	Thank you Act F, Mercury Steam
2388000	2390000	That's the name of it
2390000	2392000	Can we get the people that did Blaster Master Zero
2392000	2394000	To do a new Metroid game?
2394000	2396000	Hello? That would be fucking awesome
2396000	2398000	I would trust those guys
2398000	2400000	Yeah well that's who I want
2400000	2402000	That's at the top of my wish list for a new Guardian Legend game
2402000	2404000	Actually it would be those guys, Inti Creates
2404000	2406000	I think this is the name of them
2406000	2408000	They're at the top of my list for a Guardian Legend
2408000	2410000	Reimagining right now
2410000	2412000	They don't need to do Metroid because Mercury
2412000	2414000	This Mercury Steam just did a fucking
2414000	2416000	Phenomenal job with it so
2416000	2418000	They get to make all the Metroids now
2418000	2420000	As far as I'm concerned
2420000	2422000	And I think with the critical reception this game is getting
2422000	2424000	I think it's very likely
2424000	2426000	These guys are going to get to make more games
2426000	2428000	And maybe those that were hoping this
2428000	2430000	Would be on the Switch
2430000	2432000	Maybe you'll get your wish of a
2432000	2434000	Metroid game by these guys on the Switch
2434000	2436000	If you didn't know this game
2436000	2438000	Metroid Samus Returns, it's a reimagining
2438000	2440000	Of Metroid Part 2
2440000	2442000	Or what do they call it, Metroid 2 Return of Samus
2442000	2444000	Was the Game Boy name
2444000	2446000	It takes some of the plot elements
2446000	2448000	Like the fact that there are 40 Metroids
2448000	2450000	On the planet you have to kill
2450000	2452000	As you kill more Metroids
2452000	2454000	More parts of the planet become accessible
2454000	2456000	They've kind of done their own thing with it
2456000	2458000	Because for one
2458000	2460000	That tiny little Game Boy screen
2460000	2462000	Is now a widescreen
2462000	2464000	And so that means, you know, right off the bat
2464000	2466000	More stuff is viewable
2466000	2468000	So that kind of changes a lot of things right there
2468000	2470000	Excuse me, and they've done things like
2470000	2472000	You can aim the gun up and down
2472000	2474000	Kind of like in Super Metroid
2474000	2476000	You can aim the gun up and down
2476000	2478000	But it's free, because the circle pad
2478000	2480000	As you hold L, it's free range
2480000	2482000	But it actually works really well because
2482000	2484000	When you're about to connect with an enemy
2484000	2486000	The yellow beam turns red
2486000	2488000	So you know when you're lined up correctly
2488000	2490000	And then they have this whole melee thing
2490000	2492000	Where when an enemy is about to attack you
2492000	2494000	You can hit the X button
2494000	2496000	And you do like a Falcon Punch type of thing
2496000	2498000	And you kind of knock it
2498000	2500000	Yeah, you do like a counter and it knocks the enemy on its ass
2500000	2502000	And then your gun immediately targets it
2502000	2504000	You don't have to sit there and retarget it
2504000	2506000	Your gun immediately targets it
2506000	2508000	So you can start blasting it
2508000	2510000	Which is a pretty cool effect when it's done
2510000	2512000	I'm not sure how I feel about it
2512000	2514000	It is very, it does kind of disrupt
2514000	2516000	The usual Metroid flow that I know
2516000	2518000	But I'm getting used to it
2518000	2520000	It's growing on me the more I play the game
2520000	2522000	It was just a little weird to use it in some of those
2522000	2524000	Early Metroid encounters
2524000	2526000	But yeah, I mean
2526000	2528000	Honestly, that's a very small kind of hesitation
2528000	2530000	And what otherwise I think is a pretty
2530000	2532000	It's a pretty fantastic Metroid game
2532000	2534000	Like anybody that was worried
2534000	2536000	After Other M and all this stuff
2536000	2538000	Like, you don't need to worry
2538000	2540000	This is a worthy successor to
2540000	2542000	Metroid Zero Mission
2542000	2544000	Which would have really been, I guess, the last 2D Metroid game
2544000	2546000	If you don't count Other M
2546000	2548000	Because Other M was kind of 3D
2548000	2550000	Kind of not
2550000	2552000	So if you just kind of throw that one away
2552000	2554000	This is really the next 2D game that they've had
2554000	2556000	And it's great, I recommend it
2556000	2558000	If you're a Metroid fan and you have a 3DS
2558000	2560000	You need to check it out
2560000	2562000	There you go
2562000	2564000	Some comments in our chat over at
2564000	2566000	live.vognetwork.com
2566000	2568000	Metroid is so fucking good
2568000	2570000	Kaijuto says the new 3DS is flawless
2570000	2572000	I will point out, look
2572000	2574000	I was not convinced to upgrade to a new 3DS
2574000	2576000	For the longest time
2576000	2578000	But now that I've done it
2578000	2580000	I do like that head tracking for the 3D an awful lot
2580000	2582000	Like it really does work very well
2582000	2584000	And being able to kind of keep the 3D
2584000	2586000	Whereas like if you have an old 3DS
2586000	2588000	And you kind of look to the side just a little too much
2588000	2590000	Like the 3D completely breaks up
2590000	2592000	It doesn't happen on the new 3DS
2592000	2594000	So that alone is a pretty neat feature
2594000	2596000	I've thrown out my perfectly capable old 3DS
2596000	2598000	Paid $200 for a new one for
2598000	2600000	Not until they put Samus on it
2600000	2602000	Let's see
2602000	2604000	Tigerclaw in chat says
2604000	2606000	With Metroid Samus Returns
2606000	2608000	Do you think Nintendo will remake
2608000	2610000	Super Metroid? I think they should
2610000	2612000	They can make it better
2612000	2614000	How do you perfect perfection
2614000	2616000	Tigerclaw? That's my only concern
2616000	2618000	Like Metroid 2
2618000	2620000	Was a decent Metroid game
2620000	2622000	But I think Metroid 2
2622000	2624000	Was kind of always limited by its hardware
2624000	2626000	The old school Game Boy
2626000	2628000	In retrospect
2628000	2630000	Was kind of like it wasn't the greatest
2630000	2632000	Hardware in the world right
2632000	2634000	It was groundbreaking at the time
2634000	2636000	Because it was portable games and it was done well
2636000	2638000	But it wasn't the hardware really limited
2638000	2640000	What you could do on that thing right
2640000	2642000	So I can see why
2642000	2644000	They kind of went back and redid Metroid 2
2644000	2646000	Does Super Metroid need a remake?
2646000	2648000	No
2648000	2650000	I think
2650000	2652000	I think we can explore a new Metroid
2652000	2654000	Title and that would be just fine
2654000	2656000	But they've changed enough
2656000	2658000	With this that it doesn't feel like a rehash
2658000	2660000	Of Metroid 2 but then again
2660000	2662000	I never did get around to playing that AM2R
2662000	2664000	I would be very curious
2664000	2666000	What people who played it Oh god it was so good though
2666000	2668000	Now see I would be very curious
2668000	2670000	What your take is on
2670000	2672000	This new Metroid game
2672000	2674000	The AM2R developers have been very kind
2674000	2676000	To it and they want to see it do well
2676000	2678000	Which is good
2678000	2680000	That they're not being bitter betties
2680000	2682000	About the cease and desist and all that
2682000	2684000	I'll have to play it
2684000	2686000	I mean I've got the game I just haven't played it yet
2686000	2688000	Cool that'll be good
2688000	2690000	Let's see going to some other comments in our chat
2690000	2692000	Over at live.vognetwork.com
2692000	2694000	Let's see Tigerclaw says you perfect
2694000	2696000	Perfection by making it look better
2696000	2698000	Play better and add a ton of new features
2698000	2700000	Like what they did in Samus Returns
2700000	2702000	Again
2702000	2704000	I just don't know if it needs it
2704000	2706000	I guess if they want to put a fresh
2706000	2708000	Coat of paint on it
2708000	2710000	Like if they want to give it the Starcraft
2710000	2712000	HD thing to it
2712000	2714000	Where they redo the graphics but they don't
2714000	2716000	Fucking touch the game
2716000	2718000	Then I might be on board for it
2718000	2720000	But again I don't know
2720000	2722000	I don't know
2722000	2724000	I would have some hesitation
2724000	2726000	I would like to see Mercury Steam just be able to do
2726000	2728000	Their own Metroid game now
2728000	2730000	Like whatever they want to do with it
2730000	2732000	They've proven themselves with this game
2732000	2734000	Let them do whatever they want to do
2734000	2736000	Obviously Nintendo can still oversee it
2736000	2738000	And thumbs up or thumbs down whatever they want
2738000	2740000	But that's what I would do
2740000	2742000	In that case
2742000	2744000	Anyway I've talked enough about that game
2744000	2746000	But obviously as a long time Metroid fan
2746000	2748000	I've been very excited about that game's release
2748000	2750000	So we're going to get into some gaming news
2750000	2752000	But first some quick announcements
2752000	2754000	Again thanks you guys for tuning in for
2754000	2756000	700 episodes whether this is your first episode
2756000	2758000	Or your 700th
2758000	2760000	Thanks for being a part of our family here Sunday nights
2760000	2762000	At the Boise Geeks Network
2762000	2764000	Twitter.com slash O-L-R
2764000	2766000	You can also follow us on Facebook
2766000	2768000	Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio
2768000	2770000	No shows off
2770000	2772000	That I'm aware of in the foreseeable future
2772000	2774000	Although I'm looking to maybe
2774000	2776000	Do a trip with the long weekend
2776000	2778000	Coming up for Veterans Day
2778000	2780000	But something like
2780000	2782000	It's going to be something like L.A. or something
2782000	2784000	It's not going to be something I have to get on a plane for
2784000	2786000	I might go to L.A. that weekend
2786000	2788000	Because I have some friends in L.A. I haven't seen in a while
2788000	2790000	That's kind of what I'm leaning towards right now
2790000	2792000	Maybe that's what I'll do Veterans Day weekend
2792000	2794000	So I may not be back in time for the show that Sunday
2794000	2796000	But that's not until November
2796000	2798000	So in the meantime though we'll see you every Sunday night
2798000	2800000	Let's get into some gaming news
2800000	2802000	Loki
2802000	2804000	So this is kind of funny
2804000	2806000	Recently
2806000	2808000	It had been discovered that
2808000	2810000	There was a NES
2810000	2812000	Emulator inside the Switch firmware
2812000	2814000	Which they were calling
2814000	2816000	Flog
2816000	2818000	And along with that though
2818000	2820000	They found that there's also a ROM in there as well
2820000	2822000	So golf for the NES
2822000	2824000	Is in there
2824000	2826000	Which is kind of weird though
2826000	2828000	Because they're saying
2828000	2830000	They're not sure if it's an accident
2830000	2832000	They're probably not
2832000	2834000	But they found that the emulator
2834000	2836000	I guess the emulator version
2836000	2838000	Works on this Flog emulator
2838000	2840000	And it even has
2840000	2842000	Joy-Con controller icons
2842000	2844000	So it's compatible
2844000	2846000	With this emulator
2847000	2849000	There's not really a way to launch the game
2849000	2851000	Though via a system menu
2851000	2853000	But it might be something that's in development
2853000	2856000	Has anybody tried putting up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, start into their Switch
2856000	2858000	To see if this game pops up
2858000	2860000	No
2860000	2862000	Are there Nintendo codes out there?
2862000	2864000	Maybe that's the trick
2864000	2866000	Maybe there's a button code you have to push and you get this
2866000	2868000	Or maybe it's just
2868000	2870000	In there waiting to be unlocked
2870000	2872000	At some point when they unleash other
2872000	2874000	Virtual console type games
2874000	2876000	And I think the most exciting thing about this
2876000	2878000	Is the fact that they have
2878000	2880000	Gone back and they've
2880000	2882000	Changed the ROM
2882000	2884000	Essentially in a way to
2884000	2886000	Account for motion controls
2886000	2888000	Well here's the other thing too if you think about it
2888000	2890000	It's pointed out Flog
2890000	2892000	The name of the emulator is Golf Backwards
2892000	2894000	No shit Sherlock
2894000	2896000	So it's just kind of weird though
2896000	2898000	That I don't know
2898000	2900000	I don't know what this is
2900000	2902000	Golf is also one of those games
2902000	2904000	Where it's in the same bucket as like
2904000	2906000	Clu Clu Land and Pinball
2906000	2908000	And some of those things you were talking about earlier
2908000	2910000	I like Clu Clu Land
2910000	2912000	It's one of those games where it's like
2912000	2914000	If Loki gets upset about
2914000	2916000	Paying five bucks for Super Mario
2916000	2918000	Brothers he really is gonna
2918000	2920000	Get upset if Nintendo tries to charge five dollars
2920000	2922000	For golf which I think they actually did on the Wii U
2922000	2924000	But I digress
2924000	2926000	Golf is kind of like if Nintendo's gonna give one away
2926000	2928000	Golf's a safe one to give away
2928000	2930000	Well this is kind of weird too like here's some of the
2930000	2932000	They're talking about the controls so they're saying that
2932000	2934000	You know the controls are the
2934000	2936000	D-pad buttons
2936000	2938000	And the stick however motion
2938000	2940000	Control while holding the Z
2940000	2942000	L-R button is also supported
2942000	2944000	Instead of using the buttons so they're having
2944000	2946000	Motion control being
2946000	2948000	Added to NES games
2948000	2950000	But see you know what's
2950000	2952000	Exciting about that for me like as
2952000	2954000	Hokie as that might be although
2954000	2956000	Don't underestimate the power of that shit
2956000	2958000	I mean where as a lot of us like
2958000	2960000	For lack of a better term hardcore gamers
2960000	2962000	It's the power of love again
2962000	2964000	Okay look as much as some of us might
2964000	2966000	Roll our eyes at it I think there are some people
2966000	2968000	That are gonna think that's really cool
2968000	2970000	That you can go back to the old school games and you can
2970000	2972000	Control them a whole new way so don't
2972000	2974000	Don't underestimate little shit like that
2974000	2976000	But what is exciting
2976000	2978000	About that for me Loki
2978000	2980000	Is that they have gone back
2980000	2982000	And they have edited old games
2982000	2984000	To do new things
2984000	2986000	That's the very exciting part Loki
2986000	2988000	They have edited emulators to do new things
2988000	2990000	So is it possible
2990000	2992000	Big question mark
2992000	2994000	Is it possible
2994000	2996000	That these
2996000	2998000	The next wave of virtual console
2998000	3000000	Will not only have the online support
3000000	3002000	But maybe things like achievements
3002000	3004000	Leaderboards
3004000	3006000	Things that they've gone back
3006000	3008000	And they've updated these old ROMs to be able to do
3008000	3010000	Flog kind of shows
3010000	3012000	That Nintendo is going that
3012000	3014000	Direction of more than
3014000	3016000	Just a fucking straight up emulation
3016000	3018000	Of an old fucking game
3018000	3020000	Does that make sense?
3020000	3022000	We'll see
3022000	3024000	Yes JD in chat says
3024000	3026000	What was this about not getting your hopes up Rob
3026000	3028000	When it comes to Nintendo? You're right
3028000	3030000	I gotta keep that shit in check but
3030000	3032000	Still this is
3032000	3034000	It is a fact that this has been found
3034000	3036000	And that there is more to it
3036000	3038000	Than just a straight up emulation
3038000	3040000	So I don't think I'm getting my hopes too far up
3040000	3042000	In making that connection
3042000	3044000	Well if they're doing it for flog
3044000	3046000	Then maybe they're gonna do it for some other stuff too
3046000	3048000	Which by the way I should point out also JD
3048000	3050000	In chat says mmm flogging
3050000	3052000	Look
3052000	3054000	Folsom Street Fair if I remember right is next weekend
3054000	3056000	But I hope you all have a good one
3056000	3058000	For those that are checking that out
3058000	3060000	Let's see
3060000	3062000	Although today was the leather walk
3062000	3064000	There's
3064000	3066000	There's events every weekend for something
3066000	3068000	I need a better calendar
3068000	3070000	I attended
3070000	3072000	The election of Mr. Bolt Leather
3072000	3074000	For the year
3074000	3076000	And it was a very nice event
3076000	3078000	Good
3078000	3080000	Did you get to vote? I played pinball
3080000	3082000	Was the audience voted? No they had judges
3082000	3084000	But I played pinball
3084000	3086000	Alright
3086000	3088000	Rama in chat says you know there's a Folsom
3088000	3090000	Street Fair East
3090000	3092000	Where do they even do that?
3092000	3094000	Is that a P-Town thing?
3094000	3096000	Anyway
3096000	3098000	Oh it's in New York
3098000	3100000	Thank you I've
3100000	3102000	Clearly my calendar is not up to date
3102000	3104000	My invite got lost in the mail I suppose
3104000	3106000	Alright
3106000	3108000	Let's move on from flogging to Final Fantasy
3108000	3110000	And someday maybe those worlds
3110000	3112000	Will collide but for now
3112000	3114000	The world
3114000	3116000	Soon enough
3116000	3118000	Thanks to Final Fantasy 15 modding
3118000	3120000	Support

3144000	3146000	I can't
3146000	3148000	I can't fucking wait for
3148000	3150000	Mods to be unleashed on Final Fantasy
3150000	3152000	15 it's like
3152000	3154000	Dark Sakura
3154000	3156000	Look years and years and years
3156000	3158000	Of having it always be the women
3158000	3160000	Being objectified in these games
3160000	3162000	And in the modding communities
3162000	3164000	And the titties hanging out and all this stuff
3164000	3166000	Years and years of that is finally
3166000	3168000	Gonna be rectified and caught up with
3168000	3170000	With Final Fantasy 15
3170000	3172000	Here I am playing Final Fantasy
3172000	3174000	Dongs everywhere
3174000	3176000	I'm fighting a giant dick with a dick
3176000	3178000	In my hand and I'm shaped like a dick
3178000	3180000	It comes from
3180000	3182000	11 with the man harness
3182000	3184000	You know what I mean
3184000	3186000	Oh yeah the armor
3186000	3188000	Yes Final Fantasy 11
3188000	3190000	And 14 were some of the first games
3190000	3192000	To be like slut
3192000	3194000	The men were just as slutty as the women
3194000	3196000	And what's his face who I hate?
3196000	3198000	I don't know
3198000	3200000	You ate everybody
3200000	3202000	No who had the logo?
3202000	3204000	Bobby Blackwolf?
3204000	3206000	No in Final Fantasy 14
3206000	3208000	I was gonna say was it the 11th?
3208000	3210000	Hildebrandt
3210000	3212000	The 11th sublegar
3212000	3214000	That's it
3214000	3216000	That's what I was trying to think of the name
3216000	3218000	Let's see
3218000	3220000	Rama in chat says Rob Roberts starring
3220000	3222000	In Leather Dream Daddy
3222000	3224000	Did you see my cosplay for DragonCon?
3224000	3226000	Did you just catch that?
3226000	3228000	I got recognized by two people
3228000	3230000	JD in chat says
3230000	3232000	Final Fantasy 15 Conan Exiles
3232000	3234000	Version, anything's possible
3234000	3236000	Anyway all that talk aside
3236000	3238000	Here's the thing
3238000	3240000	The Legend of Zelda
3240000	3242000	Breath of the Wild has clearly had
3242000	3244000	An influence upon the Final Fantasy
3244000	3246000	Team in a quote from
3246000	3248000	Director Hajime Tabata the director
3248000	3250000	Of Final Fantasy 15 he's talking about
3250000	3252000	Zelda saying quote I've heard a lot
3252000	3254000	From the dev team and their reactions to having
3254000	3256000	Played Zelda but just from hearing
3256000	3258000	The stories and the feedback you know
3258000	3260000	We can tell that it's a really complete game
3260000	3262000	It's very polished almost a perfect game
3262000	3264000	In that regard and our goals
3264000	3266000	Are probably to take that experience
3266000	3268000	That players felt with Breath of the Wild
3268000	3270000	But with our own technology and our own
3270000	3272000	Know how we have in our disposal
3272000	3274000	To create a very very high
3274000	3276000	Quality game with a strong visual
3276000	3278000	Element to it while creating a world
3278000	3280000	That's really immersive and really beautiful
3280000	3282000	That's probably our goals in terms of
3282000	3284000	What we want to be with our next project
3284000	3286000	It was kind of interesting hearing about
3286000	3288000	The influence of you know Zelda
3288000	3290000	Breath of the Wild and what it kind of you know did for
3290000	3292000	That series and now we're hearing that other
3292000	3294000	Developers are getting influenced by it but man
3294000	3296000	You know I know it's a little early
3296000	3298000	To talk about Final Fantasy 16
3298000	3300000	But my assumption is that
3300000	3302000	Is something that has to happen eventually right
3302000	3304000	We have to talk about Final Fantasy 16
3304000	3306000	Eventually right
3306000	3308000	If not now then maybe the next E3
3308000	3310000	I mean maybe
3310000	3312000	Square is still kind of on the hook to like
3312000	3314000	Actually release the Final Fantasy 7
3314000	3316000	Remake first before we can really talk about
3316000	3318000	16 but here's my thing is that
3318000	3320000	And I think I've talked about this a little bit
3320000	3322000	Before but if you want to talk about like the open world
3322000	3324000	Expansiveness Final Fantasy 15
3324000	3326000	Kind of did that
3326000	3328000	In parts you know right
3328000	3330000	We all know that one of the chapters
3330000	3332000	Can go on forever because you just do
3332000	3334000	Side quests after side quests
3334000	3336000	Final Fantasy kind of had that 15 to an extent
3336000	3338000	Can you imagine
3338000	3340000	A game in Final Fantasy 15's engine
3340000	3342000	But
3342000	3344000	All the characters
3344000	3346000	All the land
3346000	3348000	All the story and all the universe
3348000	3350000	Is like Final Fantasy 9
3350000	3352000	But in Final Fantasy 15's engine
3352000	3354000	Like how fucking rad would that be
3354000	3356000	And the reason why I specifically call out 9
3356000	3358000	Is because 9 was kind of that call back
3358000	3360000	To the classic Final Fantasy era right
3360000	3362000	Like you know 7 and 8
3362000	3364000	Were kind of the more like
3364000	3366000	There were modern settings they were different
3366000	3368000	8 not as much but it was just very different
3368000	3370000	It didn't look like you know the classic Final Fantasy games
3370000	3372000	But characters like Vivi and stuff
3372000	3374000	In Final Fantasy 9 really kind of gave it
3374000	3376000	That classic Final Fantasy look so imagine
3376000	3378000	That in Final Fantasy 15's engine
3378000	3380000	And then it's like open and immersive
3380000	3382000	And not like
3382000	3384000	Necessarily as tunnel visioned as the old
3384000	3386000	Final Fantasy games because if you think about it
3386000	3388000	The original Final Fantasy like
3388000	3390000	And a lot of the even later
3390000	3392000	Final Fantasy's they're very fucking tunnel visioned
3392000	3394000	Aren't they like you know
3394000	3396000	You need the canoe to get to the river
3396000	3398000	And then you need the airship to cross the mountains
3398000	3400000	Like it is very
3400000	3402000	It's great it's still a great game but it was
3402000	3404000	Kind of you know tunnel vision
3404000	3406000	So I think it would be just awesome to see
3406000	3408000	Something like that in like a very
3408000	3410000	Open world you know quest
3410000	3412000	Type setting like Final Fantasy 15
3412000	3414000	Maybe that's part of the reason
3414000	3416000	I like 14 so much
3416000	3418000	Because even though it's online
3418000	3420000	It does feel a lot of that
3420000	3422000	It's a really good start in that direction anyway
3422000	3424000	Something you want to say with that Logie?
3424000	3426000	I'd rather just remake 6
3426000	3428000	I guess
3428000	3430000	I guess but remakes have to
3430000	3432000	You know go on the back burner at some point
3432000	3434000	They're already remaking 7 whether we like it
3434000	3436000	Or not I don't know is
3436000	3438000	Dark Sakura before we get to your story
3438000	3440000	With the Final Fantasy 7 remake
3440000	3442000	Are you apprehensive
3442000	3444000	About it or are you looking forward to
3444000	3446000	Killing Aerith in HD
3446000	3448000	Over and over again
3448000	3450000	Oh that bitch is dead
3450000	3452000	I'm gonna omni slash her
3452000	3454000	What if they
3454000	3456000	What would you do if in the remake they
3456000	3458000	Changed it so that you could bring her back to life
3458000	3460000	That bitch ain't getting my
3460000	3462000	You know resurrection
3462000	3464000	Phoenix down not for you
3464000	3466000	Phoenix up
3468000	3470000	No I know it's referring
3470000	3472000	To the down on the feathers
3472000	3474000	I know I know
3474000	3476000	Phoenix up is still funny
3476000	3478000	That's a good name for a band and rock band
3478000	3480000	Phoenix up
3480000	3482000	You don't get Phoenix down
3482000	3484000	You get Reaper down
3484000	3486000	Or as Bobby Blackwolf in our chat says
3486000	3488000	Phoenix up yours Aerith
3488000	3490000	I just don't like her
3490000	3492000	You don't say
3492000	3494000	After 700 episodes of this show
3494000	3496000	I haven't fucking figured that out
3496000	3498000	She's a man stealing hoe bag
3500000	3502000	Dungeon Buster in chat says
3502000	3504000	Forget Aerith I want a fantasy star classic
3504000	3506000	Revival with the return of Nae
3506000	3508000	Actually
3508000	3510000	How about since we didn't get
3510000	3512000	Since we didn't get into this with the Nintendo Direct
3512000	3514000	Now that you've opened that Pandora's box
3514000	3516000	Dungeon Buster
3516000	3518000	Here's the thing
3518000	3520000	Where the fuck is
3520000	3522000	Fantasy Star Online 2 in the US?
3522000	3524000	Did you know that during
3524000	3526000	Japan's Nintendo Direct
3526000	3528000	This week they got the announcement
3528000	3530000	The Fantasy Star Online 2 cloud
3530000	3532000	Or whatever is coming to the Switch
3532000	3534000	So they get Fantasy Star Online on their TV and on the go
3534000	3536000	You know what we've got with Fantasy Star Online?
3536000	3538000	Jack shit
3540000	3542000	What is Sega's
3542000	3544000	Fucking problem with this game?
3544000	3546000	Not wanting to release it in the US
3546000	3548000	What's your damage Sega?
3548000	3550000	What did we do to you?
3550000	3552000	Release
3552000	3554000	PSO 2
3554000	3556000	In the US
3556000	3558000	I should re-download that and re-patch it
3558000	3560000	It was fun
3560000	3562000	Before y'all get started on
3562000	3564000	Yes there's a patch
3564000	3566000	It would be nice to get some
3566000	3568000	Fucking official recognition from Sega
3568000	3570000	That there are PSO fans that want
3570000	3572000	To play this game here
3572000	3574000	Yes I understand the Switch
3574000	3576000	Is region free but that doesn't mean the servers
3576000	3578000	Are gonna be region free
3578000	3580000	Is having Sega
3580000	3582000	Give us a hug
3582000	3584000	Too much to ask
3584000	3586000	Apparently it is
3586000	3588000	Anyway
3588000	3590000	I'm sorry
3590000	3592000	I got disrupted by a chat
3592000	3594000	Comment there that got me wound up on a Loki rant
3594000	3596000	How about you Dark Soccer do you have something
3596000	3598000	Positive to share with us in the news
3598000	3600000	Tonight?
3600000	3602000	Positively
3602000	3604000	So we had talked about this a couple of times
3604000	3606000	In the past but
3606000	3608000	This is actually coming from
3608000	3610000	CPN coverage
3610000	3612000	Which is pretty
3612000	3614000	Sorry CBS
3614000	3616000	CBS coverage I was thinking news and then the end
3616000	3618000	Came out
3618000	3620000	But they were having some coverage
3620000	3622000	About more colleges now
3622000	3624000	Are rolling out scholarships
3624000	3626000	For varsity video game players
3626000	3628000	Several schools now
3628000	3630000	It looks like have their own
3630000	3632000	Esports team
3632000	3634000	And I think it was
3634000	3636000	I'm trying to find it in here because it listed
3636000	3638000	What school it was
3638000	3640000	One of the UC's just built an Esports arena
3640000	3642000	UC Irvine
3642000	3644000	Did it
3644000	3646000	And that now
3646000	3648000	More and more schools are opening up
3648000	3650000	Their own
3650000	3654000	Esports teams
3654000	3656000	Like multiple teams per school
3656000	3658000	And that actually
3658000	3660000	It has
3660000	3662000	It's almost now
3662000	3664000	Surpassed
3664000	3666000	Sports like physical sports
3666000	3668000	Activity in schools and they're offering
3668000	3670000	More and more scholarships to that
3670000	3672000	So
3672000	3674000	And people are like yeah it
3674000	3676000	Rebuilds a sense of community
3676000	3678000	And it's especially good for people who maybe
3678000	3680000	Can't get into the physicality of
3680000	3682000	You know like football or
3682000	3684000	Baseball or something like that
3684000	3686000	So I think it's pretty neat
3686000	3688000	All those people who made fun of us
3688000	3690000	For being nerds
3690000	3692000	Now people are going to college
3692000	3694000	For being nerds
3694000	3696000	You kids today
3696000	3698000	You don't know how easy you have it
3698000	3700000	You get a full scholarship for college
3700000	3702000	Because you're good at a video game
3702000	3704000	Back in my day that got you canned
3704000	3706000	I would have killed for that
3706000	3708000	What video game would you have gone
3708000	3710000	To college on a scholarship for at our sakura
3710000	3712000	What video game would have gotten you a full
3712000	3714000	Scholarship
3714000	3716000	Guardian legend at the time
3716000	3718000	No I'm serious I was really good at it
3718000	3720000	It makes me laugh though just imagining
3720000	3722000	The guardian legend is an esport
3722000	3724000	But it deserves it
3724000	3726000	Well I mean the era that I was going into college
3726000	3728000	Though it was Super Nintendo era
3728000	3730000	When I was first going into school so
3730000	3732000	I think that at that point
3732000	3734000	It would have been like Kirby's
3734000	3736000	Avalanche
3736000	3738000	I was really good at Puyo Puyo
3738000	3740000	Really good at Puyo Puyo
3740000	3742000	Not as good as I was
3742000	3744000	Loki what about you
3744000	3746000	You would have gone to college a full scholarship
3746000	3748000	On what game?
3748000	3750000	Well if we were talking college it would have been Mario Kart 64
3750000	3752000	Maybe
3752000	3754000	Damn you because you stole my answer
3754000	3756000	Well you sort of stole my answer
3756000	3758000	My answer was going to be Super Mario Kart
3758000	3760000	On the Super Nintendo because in the college dorms
3760000	3762000	The Playstation and the
3762000	3764000	N64 had just come out
3764000	3766000	But college kids couldn't really afford it
3766000	3768000	So I still had the last gen of games
3768000	3770000	So the guys used to come over
3770000	3772000	And we would play Super Mario Kart
3772000	3774000	And it got brutal
3774000	3776000	With that game
3776000	3778000	But I always fucking won
3778000	3780000	I'm not as good now
3780000	3782000	As I used to be
3782000	3784000	I'm sure my recent streams are evidence of that
3784000	3786000	With the new fangled Mario games
3786000	3788000	But there's always that
3788000	3790000	Alright but Mario Kart 64
3790000	3792000	For you Loki
3792000	3794000	I guess I don't know
3794000	3796000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat was in a similar place
3796000	3798000	I got it in 64
3798000	3800000	Pretty early and my dorm was the Mario Kart 64 dorm
3800000	3802000	People came into my room
3802000	3804000	Just to play four player battle mode
3804000	3806000	Actually it wasn't me
3806000	3808000	That got the Nintendo 64 first
3808000	3810000	It was the guys right upstairs
3810000	3812000	If we're talking like it's not technically a video game
3812000	3814000	But the best game
3814000	3816000	Or the game that I was the best at
3816000	3818000	At that time would have been
3818000	3820000	Q's are laser tag
3820000	3822000	Oh that would have been your scholarship
3822000	3824000	Right there with Q's are
3824000	3826000	I've been awesome
3826000	3828000	Anyway and I don't know if your
3828000	3830000	I don't know if your college
3830000	3832000	Was anything like mine Bobby
3832000	3834000	But those guys upstairs that used to play Mario Kart
3834000	3836000	They used to get so
3836000	3838000	Fucking high before they would play Mario Kart
3838000	3840000	Like it was
3840000	3842000	That room was just like a giant fucking cloud
3842000	3844000	And then
3844000	3846000	Mario Kart 64
3846000	3848000	Something about the colors I'm sure
3848000	3850000	Now when I was actually in college though
3850000	3852000	Totally World Cup Soccer 94 pinball
3852000	3854000	Which is why I
3854000	3856000	I own one now
3856000	3858000	The other game that we played in the dorms all the time
3858000	3860000	Was since we all had our own phone lines
3860000	3862000	I know I've told this story on OLR
3862000	3864000	Since we all had our own phone lines in those little rooms
3864000	3866000	We used to
3866000	3868000	And it was still dial up back then
3868000	3870000	The high speed hadn't hit the dorms yet
3870000	3872000	So we were still doing dial up
3872000	3874000	So we would dial into the college internet
3874000	3876000	And we would play Duke Nukem 3D
3876000	3878000	Over the phones
3878000	3880000	That was my first LAN game
3880000	3882000	On Friday nights we would leave our doors open
3882000	3884000	And we would be playing Duke Nukem 3D
3884000	3886000	Over the phone basically
3886000	3888000	It was good times
3888000	3890000	Did you ever do the voice macros?
3890000	3892000	Where you could hit it and go
3892000	3894000	I came here to kick ass and chew bubble gum
3894000	3896000	And I'm all out of gum
3896000	3898000	My face was your face, your ass
3898000	3900000	What's the difference?
3900000	3902000	I remember all that stuff
3902000	3904000	Good times
3904000	3906000	Anyhow
3906000	3908000	So let's move on, Loki what do you have for us?
3908000	3910000	Maybe another game that kids can go to college on
3910000	3912000	Yes it's the new game
3912000	3914000	Well it's not so much the game of the week anymore
3914000	3916000	But it's a popular game
3916000	3918000	Or one of the popular games
3918000	3920000	Player Unknown's Battlegrounds is now the most
3920000	3922000	Played game on steam
3922000	3924000	Of all time
3924000	3926000	That's right it's hit the record
3926000	3928000	Of um
3928000	3930000	1.349
3930000	3932000	Million players
3934000	3936000	That's it's peak
3936000	3938000	Previous record which of course
3938000	3940000	And Dota 2
3940000	3942000	That was March of last year
3942000	3944000	They were 1.291
3944000	3946000	So not bad
3946000	3948000	And of course also
3948000	3950000	Across the 15 million concurrent
3950000	3952000	Steam users
3952000	3954000	Or steam had just crossed that
3954000	3956000	The other thing of course they're doing with it
3956000	3958000	They're tweaking
3958000	3960000	It is kind of becoming a problem
3960000	3962000	In the game with people idle farming
3962000	3964000	So like in
3964000	3966000	Counter Strike Go
3966000	3968000	You can
3968000	3970000	Get different items
3970000	3972000	In the game, loot boxes
3972000	3974000	Or whatever and you can sell those items on the steam marketplace
3974000	3976000	To make money
3976000	3978000	And so people were just going idle
3978000	3980000	In the game because they would still earn the currency
3980000	3982000	In the game to
3982000	3984000	You know be able to
3984000	3986000	Oh no you should get kicked out if you're inactive
3986000	3988000	So now they've got more things
3988000	3990000	In place to basically check to see
3990000	3992000	If they're just sitting there
3992000	3994000	It's going to be harder for people to do that
3994000	3996000	So that is something
3996000	3998000	That they're working on as well
3998000	4000000	Stoppy in chat says
4000000	4002000	It's crazy the guy who made the game is the black sheep of his family
4002000	4004000	Now he's set for life and taking care of his parents
4004000	4006000	Amazing success story
4006000	4008000	No good I mean good for him
4008000	4010000	You know it's hard to hate on somebody who's made a successful game
4010000	4012000	Even if I don't really play it
4012000	4014000	Well here's my question
4014000	4016000	Actually
4016000	4018000	And those of you that are familiar with this game
4018000	4020000	I would think this answer is pretty easy
4020000	4022000	But maybe it's not
4022000	4024000	Are you able to just set up a game
4024000	4026000	Where it's nobody
4026000	4028000	It's nothing but people you know
4028000	4030000	Like you can set up a friends only game
4030000	4032000	It's like 100 people are playing
4032000	4034000	Yeah but can I play like a lower version
4034000	4036000	Can I play like an 8 player version
4036000	4038000	Where it's just people we know
4038000	4040000	I think right now because I'm on a laptop
4040000	4042000	And I don't really have like the keyboard mouse
4042000	4044000	Set up like I can't do
4044000	4046000	Mouse and keyboard basically
4046000	4048000	Because I'm just not used to that
4048000	4050000	I'm used to playing on a controller
4051000	4053000	Well Xbox has got you covered
4053000	4055000	For the years up
4055000	4057000	But it's interesting
4057000	4059000	Like I was watching there was an article
4059000	4061000	Kind of looking at some of the stuff today
4061000	4063000	About people are speed hacking in the game
4063000	4065000	And so running around really fast
4065000	4067000	Because they're saying you know right now
4067000	4069000	They're anti cheating systems
4069000	4071000	Not perfect but they're showing
4071000	4073000	Like one of the guys is like
4073000	4075000	He's a big CSGO player
4075000	4077000	And the guy's like speed hacking just running past him
4077000	4079000	He just takes him out
4079000	4081000	Just knocks him out
4081000	4083000	He's like I'm too good for this shit
4083000	4085000	So that was kind of fun
4085000	4087000	See MXC in chat says you can set up your own team
4087000	4089000	But I think that is still online against a mass of players
4089000	4091000	That's not really good enough for me
4091000	4093000	I would like to have a mode that's kind of more like private
4093000	4095000	So that I could just play with other people
4095000	4097000	Like me and my skill set
4097000	4099000	And other like vlog people
4099000	4101000	And twitter people and stuff like have our own
4101000	4103000	I think a lot of people aren't that great on it
4103000	4105000	I mean I don't think it's a lot of
4105000	4107000	There are some people that are good at it
4107000	4109000	There's a lot of factors that's kind of random too
4109000	4111000	Because it depends on where you drop
4111000	4113000	Where the center of everything
4113000	4115000	The arena is going to be
4115000	4117000	Plus they have new maps now
4117000	4119000	So there's a lot of
4119000	4121000	Random factors in there that may affect it
4121000	4123000	Alright
4123000	4125000	I think I need to check this game out
4125000	4127000	How much is it? It's not a full 50
4127000	4129000	It's like 40 bucks I think
4129000	4131000	I think I need to check this game out
4131000	4133000	I do
4133000	4135000	I'm apprehensive because first person shooter
4135000	4137000	Right yeah it's hard
4137000	4139000	Like coming into something like that
4139000	4141000	And even like Overwatch for me
4141000	4143000	It's kind of hard to like
4143000	4145000	You have to really be like doing this constantly
4145000	4147000	To be any good at it
4147000	4149000	But I don't know
4149000	4151000	I guess I'm a filthy casual now
4151000	4153000	Let's see going to our chat
4153000	4155000	Bobby Blackwell says you're going to find PUBG modes
4155000	4157000	I keep wanting to say
4157000	4159000	PUBG modes
4159000	4161000	Even though I'm getting the letters reversed
4161000	4163000	You're going to find PUBG modes
4163000	4165000	In all the AAA games now
4165000	4167000	Fortnite has a PUBG mode already
4167000	4169000	GTA online already has something
4169000	4171000	It'll just be like
4171000	4173000	Horde mode in Gears of War
4173000	4175000	Like every game
4175000	4177000	Mass Effect got something like that
4177000	4179000	You know what you'd probably like actually
4179000	4181000	That's kind of similar
4181000	4183000	It's basically Hunger Games
4183000	4185000	The Hunger Game mod is in
4185000	4187000	Minecraft
4187000	4189000	It's pretty low
4189000	4191000	You don't have to be a super expert player
4191000	4193000	It's literally
4193000	4195000	Hacking people with pickaxes
4195000	4197000	There's not a whole lot of skill there
4197000	4199000	But that looks a lot of fun
4199000	4201000	Every time I've seen people play that
4201000	4203000	I do play Overwatch
4203000	4205000	So it's not like I'm completely apprehensive
4205000	4207000	To first person games
4207000	4209000	The thing I'm really learning about Overwatch
4209000	4211000	As much as I like to play characters
4211000	4213000	Like Sombra and Pharah
4213000	4215000	Honestly, I just have the best luck
4215000	4217000	When I play Mercy
4217000	4219000	I don't want to say I'm good at Mercy
4219000	4221000	But I'm
4221000	4223000	I play Mercy well enough
4223000	4225000	Where I really feel like I'm pulling my weight
4225000	4227000	As opposed to certain other characters
4227000	4229000	What we really need is
4229000	4231000	We need an actual
4231000	4233000	Umm
4233000	4235000	What is it
4235000	4237000	Umm
4237000	4239000	What the fuck
4239000	4241000	The movie that started it all
4241000	4243000	Not Hunger Games
4243000	4245000	Battle Royale
4245000	4247000	We need an actual Battle Royale game
4247000	4249000	We said that years ago
4249000	4251000	Fuck the Imitators, we need the actual Battle Royale game
4251000	4253000	Didn't we have a, Dark Tetsuya
4253000	4255000	Didn't we have a list list
4255000	4257000	Years ago
4257000	4259000	That was
4259000	4261000	What movie do we need to make a game out of
4261000	4263000	And tell me
4263000	4265000	Battle Royale wasn't in the top 3
4265000	4267000	Had to have been
4267000	4269000	Had to have been
4269000	4271000	Maybe it's on the wiki somewhere
4271000	4273000	Everybody's trying to be Battle Royale
4273000	4275000	Battle Royale is just Battle Royale
4275000	4277000	S.H.O. 100 Matt says good thing Overwatch
4277000	4279000	Doesn't have commands like heal please
4279000	4281000	Protect please, oh no
4281000	4283000	Oh no S.H.O. 100 Matt
4283000	4285000	It does
4285000	4287000	You can hit I need healing
4287000	4289000	Or I need armor
4289000	4291000	Look
4291000	4293000	I fucking know you need healing
4293000	4295000	I'm playing a healer
4295000	4297000	Sometimes you're fucking hiding behind a wall
4297000	4299000	How am I supposed to fly to you if you're hiding behind the fucking wall
4299000	4301000	And the other thing that pisses me off
4301000	4303000	Is when I'm playing Torbjorn
4303000	4305000	I need armor
4305000	4307000	I will fucking throw you
4307000	4309000	All the fucking armors in the world
4309000	4311000	When I have enough scrap
4311000	4313000	But if you want to get mad at somebody
4313000	4315000	Get mad at the person that keeps
4315000	4317000	Picking it up off the ground when they don't really need it
4317000	4319000	I'll even try to like not
4319000	4321000	Throw the armor in front of that person
4321000	4323000	But they still run over and get it
4323000	4325000	Unfortunately
4325000	4327000	Totally doesn't work in that game
4327000	4329000	Dark Tetsuya says
4329000	4331000	Episode 66
4331000	4333000	Movie that most needs a video game
4333000	4335000	Okay, this is the scientific list list
4335000	4337000	Process here on OLR
4337000	4339000	The official answer is from our list list
4339000	4341000	Number 3, Kill Bill
4341000	4343000	That was a good choice, that was a very good choice
4343000	4345000	Number 2, Clerks
4345000	4347000	Can't imagine how that would work
4347000	4349000	I don't know what we were thinking
4349000	4351000	At that time, but it's kind of funny
4351000	4353000	If it's based off the animated series that'd be fun
4353000	4355000	I think the animated series was still kind of
4355000	4357000	New in our minds at that time
4357000	4359000	And then number 1, Battle Royale
4359000	4361000	So sure enough
4361000	4363000	On episode 66, we said they should make
4363000	4365000	A game out of Battle Royale
4365000	4367000	So Pugbee guy needs to pay up
4367000	4369000	Hey, I still won the Paper Plate Battle Royale
4369000	4371000	Alright
4371000	4373000	Let's move on
4373000	4375000	More stories for you guys here on episode number 700
4375000	4377000	Let's talk about a new game
4377000	4379000	That's been announced for the Nintendo Switch
4379000	4381000	Although, I think this is actually a
4381000	4383000	I want to say it's like a
4383000	4385000	Re-updating or something
4385000	4387000	Of a Apple TV game
4387000	4389000	And of course the site I'm trying to pull this story from
4389000	4391000	Is now not working, so I'm going to do this best for my memory
4391000	4393000	But Super Beat Sports
4393000	4395000	Is a harmonics game
4395000	4397000	And they have announced that that is going to be coming out on
4397000	4399000	The Nintendo Switch
4399000	4401000	This game was originally out for the Apple TV
4401000	4403000	But I don't think a ton of people
4403000	4405000	Are gaming on there
4405000	4407000	Some are, but just obviously the Apple TV
4407000	4409000	Is not a gaming device
4409000	4411000	So I think their audience is limited
4411000	4413000	It's kind of cool, they have some pictures of their official site
4413000	4415000	SuperBeatsports.com
4415000	4417000	So you can play these different sports
4417000	4419000	It's harmonics, music, games
4419000	4421000	And now it's going to be on the Switch
4421000	4423000	Yeah, they've got like five mini games
4423000	4425000	So based on familiar sports they said like
4425000	4427000	Tennis, hockey, golf, and volleyball
4427000	4429000	You play with up to three players
4429000	4431000	Or four players I guess
4431000	4433000	Motion controls
4433000	4435000	They're saying, you know
4435000	4437000	Or non-motion controls
4437000	4439000	I don't know, neat
4439000	4441000	Looks like a little Wii Sports
4441000	4443000	Type of game
4443000	4445000	As I saw a bit of the game on their live stream
4445000	4447000	It looked neat, yeah, I know they were live streaming
4447000	4449000	Some of it earlier this week, so that's pretty cool
4449000	4451000	So, alright
4451000	4453000	Alright, well let's move on
4453000	4455000	With some more news, DarkSakura
4455000	4457000	A computer gaming legend, right?
4457000	4459000	Oh yes
4459000	4461000	Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?
4461000	4463000	Why are you not playing the music? In my pants
4463000	4465000	Not your pants
4465000	4467000	I didn't
4467000	4469000	Unless Carmen also
4469000	4471000	Is now you know
4471000	4473000	Anyway
4473000	4475000	I need the music, Rob
4475000	4477000	It has to happen
4477000	4479000	But anyway
4479000	4481000	Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?
4481000	4483000	Was
4483000	4485000	An animated series in the past
4485000	4487000	And it was a fun
4487000	4489000	Game show
4489000	4491000	And
4491000	4493000	I think
4495000	4497000	Best theme song ever
4497000	4499000	Anyway, Netflix
4499000	4501000	This shit didn't exist from
4501000	4503000	I first played Carmen Sandiego on the
4503000	4505000	Apple 2E
4505000	4507000	This is what you babies
4507000	4509000	Got into in the 90's
4509000	4511000	No, no, no, Rob
4511000	4513000	It was all about where in time is Carmen
4513000	4515000	Sandiego
4515000	4517000	That was my jam
4517000	4519000	You know me, history nerd
4519000	4521000	As much as I love that theme as well
4521000	4523000	It's all about the chief
4523000	4525000	On the Carmen Sandiego
4525000	4527000	She didn't give no shit
4527000	4529000	Anyway
4529000	4531000	Netflix has said
4531000	4533000	Okay, you missed it, great
4533000	4535000	They've greenlit a new
4535000	4537000	Animated series with 20
4537000	4539000	22 minute episodes
4539000	4541000	That are coming out in 2019
4541000	4543000	So
4543000	4545000	Apparently
4545000	4547000	Gina Rodriguez is going to be Carmen
4547000	4549000	Sandiego and Finn
4549000	4551000	Wolfhard is going to be
4551000	4553000	Her accomplice named
4553000	4555000	Player
4555000	4557000	So even though this has to do with
4557000	4559000	A TV show
4559000	4561000	A cartoon, a Netflix revival
4561000	4563000	Maybe it will cause
4563000	4565000	A revival of the computer games
4565000	4567000	Because I think people forget that the game
4567000	4569000	Show came from computer games
4569000	4571000	Or maybe updating the computer games
4571000	4573000	That might have more modern
4573000	4575000	References to real countries
4575000	4577000	That exist
4577000	4579000	Kids today need to never be able to fucking find her
4579000	4581000	Sorry, Czechoslovakia doesn't exist anymore as a country
4581000	4583000	Oh, good point
4583000	4585000	The USSR doesn't exist
4585000	4587000	As a country
4587000	4589000	The world has changed
4589000	4591000	The world has changed
4591000	4593000	And then
4593000	4595000	Carmen is keeping herself alive through
4595000	4597000	Secret rituals
4597000	4599000	Involving the blood of every past gumshoe
4599000	4601000	That she's defeated
4601000	4603000	She's now a vampire
4603000	4605000	cannibal
4605000	4607000	That is being produced by
4607000	4609000	Houghton Mifflin Harcourt
4609000	4611000	Which is a name I haven't seen since I was like
4611000	4613000	In high school
4613000	4615000	Reading my schoolbooks
4615000	4617000	So, yay
4617000	4619000	Yay
4619000	4621000	Now we have to listen to the theme song the whole rest of the show
4621000	4623000	No, because I think there's
4623000	4625000	Copyrights that prevent that from happening
4625000	4627000	Anyway, by the way
4627000	4629000	Before we get to our next story, taking a step back
4629000	4631000	Real quick, Bobby Blackwolf decided
4631000	4633000	To jump in and look at the complete
4633000	4635000	Listless archive just because he was bored
4635000	4637000	And thinking about that segment
4637000	4639000	Are we really boring him that much? I think so
4639000	4641000	This is relevant, this is important
4641000	4643000	Bobby Blackwolf says we did a listless
4643000	4645000	In 2014 that was
4645000	4647000	What are we most looking forward to
4647000	4649000	At E3 2014
4649000	4651000	The number two answer
4651000	4653000	You ready for it? The number two answer that night?
4653000	4655000	Fantasy Star Online 2 on the Wii U
4657000	4659000	Here we are three years later
4659000	4661000	Let's go home, we're done
4661000	4663000	Sega can suck a fuck
4663000	4665000	Yes, I'm gonna use that phrase
4665000	4667000	Because I can't think of anything more appropriate
4667000	4669000	Than the anger I'm feeling at Sega
4669000	4671000	Sega, suck a fuck
4671000	4673000	And besides, I think we're owed some reparations
4673000	4675000	For the fucking Sonic the Hedgehog series
4675000	4677000	I mean
4677000	4679000	But they did kind of redeem themselves with Sonic Mania
4679000	4681000	And Sonic Generations was good
4681000	4683000	It's a start
4683000	4685000	Are we to forget all the other games that they made?
4685000	4687000	Rob, they can eat a sack of dicks
4687000	4689000	Zombie dicks
4689000	4691000	Real zombie dicks
4691000	4693000	Pulsating
4693000	4695000	With the occasional, you know, fly attached to it
4695000	4697000	She's
4697000	4699000	Flying around the world to steal zombie dicks
4699000	4701000	All the zombie dicks
4701000	4703000	Act Deft in chat
4703000	4705000	Act Deft in chat says
4705000	4707000	We need a new list list, how can Sega go
4707000	4709000	And fuck themselves for PSO
4713000	4715000	Moving on
4715000	4717000	Just a few more stories than the classic game
4717000	4719000	Of the week
4719000	4721000	Loki
4721000	4723000	So, it was very
4723000	4725000	Exciting to see that Journey
4725000	4727000	I mean, a totally different game
4727000	4729000	Not Journey, but totally Journey
4729000	4731000	Coming to Apple
4731000	4733000	TV, iPad, and iPhones
4733000	4735000	From that game company
4735000	4737000	It's called Sky
4737000	4739000	And it's like if you replace sand
4739000	4741000	With clouds in its journey
4741000	4743000	But it looks good
4743000	4745000	Well, we don't know until we play it
4745000	4747000	It's totally related
4747000	4749000	I would be really interested to try it out
4749000	4751000	On my Apple TV
4751000	4753000	What I played on my Apple TV to date
4753000	4755000	Is Sonic CD
4755000	4757000	With the right soundtrack, Bobby
4757000	4759000	The Japanese one
4759000	4761000	But, um
4761000	4763000	And it's episode 700
4763000	4765000	So you're gonna let her have her moment
4765000	4767000	And not cry tonight
4767000	4769000	Yeah
4769000	4771000	Anyway, so
4771000	4773000	It's creatures that look humanoid
4773000	4775000	But they're like floating
4775000	4777000	And kind of flying
4777000	4779000	And they have things that cause them
4779000	4781000	And there's
4781000	4783000	There's a big thing in the distance
4783000	4785000	It has a beam of light
4785000	4787000	It's fucking Journey
4787000	4789000	But whatever, it looks cool
4789000	4791000	I'll invest in it when it comes out
4791000	4793000	I can't wait to play it on my
4793000	4795000	Apple TV
4795000	4797000	I can't wait to play it on my $1000 iPhone
4797000	4799000	Because yes, the fuck I am buying
4799000	4801000	Across the room, high five
4801000	4803000	Yes, I am fucking buying that iPhone X
4803000	4805000	And you can miss me with that Android shit
4805000	4807000	10
4807000	4809000	I didn't watch the press conference, I just read all that
4809000	4811000	You can miss me with all that Android comparison shit, okay
4811000	4813000	My husband has an Android
4813000	4815000	So I get to see what's going on over there
4815000	4817000	We're a bi-phonal household
4817000	4819000	And that's the way we like it
4819000	4821000	And get that sweet new screen into my hands
4821000	4823000	Oh, girl
4823000	4825000	I was watching that keynote
4825000	4827000	And I'm like, yeah
4827000	4829000	I don't need to pay off
4829000	4831000	My student loan this year
4831000	4833000	Thank you, because Act F says buy phones
4833000	4835000	There it is
4835000	4837000	Alright, anyway
4837000	4839000	S2100 Matt says, but that's so much money
4839000	4841000	I don't know if that's said tongue in cheek
4841000	4843000	We so don't care
4843000	4845000	Well, isn't the Note 8 or whatever
4845000	4847000	One of those Android, it's $950
4847000	4849000	Something like that
4849000	4851000	I already put down
4851000	4853000	and priced what it's going to cost me for
4853000	4855000	the 256 gigabyte model
4855000	4857000	No, real talk for a minute
4857000	4859000	And I don't care if you're iPhone or Android
4859000	4861000	I really don't, it's your money
4861000	4863000	Spend it on whatever makes you happy
4863000	4865000	I'm going to let you know
4865000	4867000	Do whatever you want
4867000	4869000	Here's my thing, really, at the end of the day
4869000	4871000	When it comes to my phone
4871000	4873000	I'm at a point where
4873000	4875000	I wouldn't have thought this 15 years ago when OLR first started
4875000	4877000	I was using my shitty little flip phone
4877000	4879000	that had the little tiny
4879000	4881000	little 20 pixel big TV
4881000	4883000	It looked like a Dreamcast VMU
4883000	4885000	on the front that you'd use to take selfies
4885000	4887000	I can maybe play NES problems on this
4887000	4889000	Right?
4889000	4891000	So 15 years ago I would have never thought this about my phone
4891000	4893000	But the reality is, here we are living in this world
4893000	4895000	I use my phone more than anything else
4895000	4897000	Even my desktop PC
4897000	4899000	That's how much I use my phone
4899000	4901000	Especially with, you know, you guys know I do gaming
4901000	4903000	with Pokemon Go and Ingress and all that other stuff too
4903000	4905000	It's not even just that
4905000	4907000	I use my phone everywhere
4907000	4909000	So, honestly, I know
4909000	4911000	Yes, a thousand dollars is a lot of money
4911000	4913000	Of course it's a lot of money, but that's why
4913000	4915000	I haven't upgraded my phone in three years
4915000	4917000	So I've been saving money knowing that I'm probably
4917000	4919000	going to have to spend a lot of money to get a new phone
4919000	4921000	And it's like, I probably paid more than that
4921000	4923000	for my computer
4923000	4925000	Which in reality I use less
4925000	4927000	So
4927000	4929000	Anyway
4929000	4931000	Don't let anybody tell you how to spend your money
4931000	4933000	You want to go buy a new Android phone? Go you
4933000	4935000	That's awesome
4935000	4937000	You want to go buy an iPhone SE?
4937000	4939000	Because you don't need any of this new shit
4939000	4941000	You just want a fucking phone? Awesome!
4941000	4943000	Go you, get the phone that works for you
4943000	4945000	But don't tell other people what to do
4945000	4947000	Alright, moving on
4947000	4949000	Let's see, what do we have next?
4949000	4951000	Oh, oh, this is
4951000	4953000	This is not good, but I guess a learning
4953000	4955000	experience for everybody in this situation
4955000	4957000	So Destiny 2, which I
4957000	4959000	really, really want to play Destiny 2
4959000	4961000	But I'm waiting for the PC version
4961000	4963000	Because I just, I want my mouse and
4963000	4965000	keyboard support, so I'm waiting on
4965000	4967000	the PC version, so
4967000	4969000	But I'm hearing a lot of good things from the people
4969000	4971000	that are playing it on Playstation 4 and Xbox One
4971000	4973000	right now, but one of the not so good things
4973000	4975000	I'm hearing about is that
4975000	4977000	Oh, some armor snuck
4977000	4979000	its way into the game that was
4979000	4981000	Oh, it was kind of a reference to
4981000	4983000	white supremacy. Whoops
4983000	4985000	Somebody screwed up on that one
4985000	4987000	So, here's what, and a lot of people
4987000	4989000	wanted to know, how the fuck did this happen?
4989000	4991000	Like, how did this get into the game?
4991000	4993000	And basically, it was one of those things where
4993000	4995000	Bungie wrote this explanation about how
4995000	4997000	they do draw from real world
4997000	4999000	art iconography and other
4999000	5001000	design elements, and what happened is that
5001000	5003000	I guess the original meme
5003000	5005000	kind of came to their attention. You know how sometimes
5005000	5007000	memes get repurposed by
5007000	5009000	other crowds for bad things?
5009000	5011000	Isn't that what kind of happened to the frog?
5011000	5013000	Anyway,
5013000	5015000	Yes, because the frog is actually, it's a
5015000	5017000	children's book. Yeah, okay, so
5017000	5019000	So what happened is that they found, I guess
5019000	5021000	the way I'm reading it from Bungie is
5021000	5023000	they found the meme, but their own
5023000	5025000	internal team did not realize that that had been
5025000	5027000	repurposed into this flag
5027000	5029000	that represented something completely different
5029000	5031000	So, you know, Bungie apologized
5031000	5033000	and basically promised to do better, and they are
5033000	5035000	working to, I guess they did some
5035000	5037000	recent maintenance where they've really kind of
5037000	5039000	they haven't been able to scrub it completely
5039000	5041000	from the game, but they've like
5041000	5043000	they've changed it enough so that you don't
5043000	5045000	really recognize what it was anymore
5045000	5047000	and soon it will be completely
5047000	5049000	scrubbed from the game. That is what they're
5049000	5051000	doing there, so
5051000	5053000	There you go!
5053000	5055000	Dungeonbuster in chat says, wow, I play Destiny 2
5055000	5057000	and I never heard about this. Well, my understanding
5057000	5059000	is that ninjas went in the middle of the night
5059000	5061000	during one of the maintenance periods and
5061000	5063000	got rid of this from the game
5063000	5065000	and that's what happened, so
5065000	5067000	Bungie says, sorry about that, and it
5067000	5069000	won't happen again, but it just, it also goes
5069000	5071000	to show that the internet is a huge place
5071000	5073000	and you gotta be careful sometimes because
5073000	5075000	you know, you may not know that something you're saying
5075000	5077000	Yeah, I mean, it's not like, it's not overt like
5077000	5079000	oh, it's a swastika or something like that
5079000	5081000	Yeah, it wasn't something obvious
5081000	5083000	It looks kind of sporty
5083000	5085000	like, it's like a sports
5085000	5087000	thing, I mean
5087000	5089000	I don't know, like a
5089000	5091000	bike tracksuit type thing
5091000	5093000	But now that we know what it is, it's not okay
5093000	5095000	just to be clear
5095000	5097000	Okay, just to be clear
5097000	5099000	Anyway, let's
5099000	5101000	get to a, go back to a time
5101000	5103000	and a place when games weren't so fucking
5103000	5105000	complicated
5105000	5107000	It's the classic game of the week, and Dark Soccer
5107000	5109000	is gonna step into the gaming vault tonight
5109000	5111000	and pick a game that she says, hey
5111000	5113000	brats
5113000	5115000	you should be checking out this game
5115000	5117000	We've been telling you for a while
5117000	5119000	Now Dark Soccer, you've actually
5119000	5121000	talked about a while, we started classic
5121000	5123000	game of the week in what, episode number 250?
5123000	5125000	Something like that
5125000	5127000	So this would be, if I can math correctly
5127000	5129000	this would be the 450th classic
5129000	5131000	game of the week, give or take
5131000	5133000	Not necessarily because of
5133000	5135000	Marathon show, some one-offs
5135000	5137000	And the classic console
5137000	5139000	Oh, I forgot about the consoles
5139000	5141000	Okay, so give or take the
5141000	5143000	450th classic something something of the
5143000	5145000	week, so the rules
5145000	5147000	of the classic game of the week that
5147000	5149000	was established some time ago is that a game
5149000	5151000	must be 10 years older or more
5151000	5153000	to be the classic game of the week
5153000	5155000	But Dark Soccer, before I
5155000	5157000	unveil tonight's classic game of the week and before
5157000	5159000	somebody in chat says, that
5159000	5161000	game didn't come out till November
5161000	5163000	so it's not 10 years
5163000	5165000	old Well fuck you, it's my segment, my
5165000	5167000	rules
5167000	5169000	So that is the official statement for Dark
5169000	5171000	Soccer, it's my house
5171000	5173000	And if you don't like it
5173000	5175000	And I believe that my intent was that if it
5175000	5177000	came out that year, and it wouldn't be
5177000	5179000	the first time I've done it because I have done something like a month
5179000	5181000	before
5181000	5183000	So precedent has been set
5183000	5185000	So take your opinion, shine
5185000	5187000	it up real nice
5187000	5189000	Turn it sideways and shove it up your candy
5189000	5191000	ass, to quote
5191000	5193000	Sir Rock
5193000	5195000	But look, you don't want to taint this game
5195000	5197000	with, you just know that people are gonna
5197000	5199000	say something to chat about it
5199000	5201000	So what is the classic game of the week?
5201000	5203000	It's Mass Effect, duh
5203000	5205000	Can you believe
5205000	5207000	it's been 10 years though? I can't
5207000	5209000	actually, that's crazy to me
5209000	5211000	Oh, but this theme
5211000	5213000	This theme is so fucking good
5213000	5215000	I know
5217000	5219000	It's sad because I just think about
5219000	5221000	the ending scene, well I won't get ahead
5221000	5223000	of myself, but anyway
5223000	5225000	I always would let this go until Garrosh showed up on
5225000	5227000	the screen and then I would start
5227000	5229000	You can't
5229000	5231000	start until your title screen has been blessed
5231000	5233000	by Garrosh. Garrosh is space husband
5233000	5235000	number two. Fair enough
5235000	5237000	You don't know who space husband number one is
5237000	5239000	in my fandom
5239000	5241000	in my head
5241000	5243000	Your own husband, Dan?
5243000	5245000	Dan's not from space
5245000	5247000	I'm talking about space husband. Technically this planet
5247000	5249000	is in space, therefore he's from space
5249000	5251000	Are you sure he didn't fall from space and hatch out of
5251000	5253000	an egg? No, because he's not orc
5253000	5255000	He's not aging
5255000	5257000	and he doesn't drink orange juice through his finger rub
5257000	5259000	Anyway
5259000	5261000	Mass Effect, yes it did
5261000	5263000	come out in November
5263000	5265000	2007, but fuck it
5265000	5267000	But it was probably gold in September
5267000	5269000	It was in beta
5269000	5271000	The critics had it, sure
5271000	5273000	It was
5273000	5275000	originally released for
5275000	5277000	Xbox 360 in
5277000	5279000	2007, and it
5279000	5281000	of course is the first. It was intended
5281000	5283000	from the start to be
5283000	5285000	a multiple
5285000	5287000	chapter series
5287000	5289000	So we knew there would be more
5289000	5291000	They left it open for more
5291000	5293000	But you assume the role of
5293000	5295000	Commander Shepard, who there's only
5295000	5297000	one Commander Shepard in my heart
5297000	5299000	Sorry Mark Meer, but Jennifer Hale forever
5299000	5301000	Who was modeled first?
5301000	5303000	True story
5303000	5305000	We had FemShep first
5305000	5307000	But basically it was
5307000	5309000	So FemShep existed in September
5309000	5311000	MaleShep did not
5311000	5313000	Or something like that
5313000	5315000	Anyway
5315000	5317000	It used the Unreal Engine
5317000	5319000	3 for its groundwork
5319000	5321000	and
5321000	5323000	basically it was just
5323000	5325000	built from the ground up
5325000	5327000	to be an awesome
5327000	5329000	piece of video game
5329000	5331000	gorgeousness
5331000	5333000	And of course now we've got wonderful high res mods
5333000	5335000	and people are still
5335000	5337000	I was talking to
5337000	5339000	Becky the other day and she just finished it again
5339000	5341000	So, good job
5341000	5343000	Anyway you play as
5343000	5345000	Commander Shepard
5345000	5347000	Who you decide everything about
5347000	5349000	her or him
5349000	5351000	That looks like within the reasons of the game
5351000	5353000	And then you bust out the mod manager
5353000	5355000	And you change all of it
5355000	5357000	And then
5357000	5359000	you can take all your different
5359000	5361000	specialties
5361000	5363000	You can do different classes
5363000	5365000	Either biotic or non-biotic
5365000	5367000	And then you travel across the galaxy
5367000	5369000	Chasing a
5369000	5371000	completely, obviously
5371000	5373000	looking
5373000	5375000	messed up
5375000	5377000	looking turian guy
5377000	5379000	Who, I mean
5379000	5381000	How can you look at him and go
5381000	5383000	Oh he's not completely taken over
5383000	5385000	by an
5385000	5387000	inorganic species? No
5387000	5389000	Not with his face looking like
5389000	5391000	that and the circuitry
5391000	5393000	peeking out of his body. No
5393000	5395000	Saren's not evil. Saren's a nice guy
5395000	5397000	He gives presents to small children
5397000	5399000	And, you know, raises
5399000	5401000	money for orphanages, I guess
5401000	5403000	Anyway
5403000	5405000	So you take the Normandy
5405000	5407000	all the way across
5407000	5409000	Spending the entire game thinking about how you're gonna
5409000	5411000	fuck that turian
5411000	5413000	Wow
5413000	5415000	No
5415000	5417000	You have your romance options
5417000	5419000	Which were just three people
5419000	5421000	really, if you were
5421000	5423000	a dude you could romance Ashley
5423000	5425000	or Liara
5425000	5427000	And if you were
5427000	5429000	FemShep, you could romance
5429000	5431000	Kaden or Liara
5431000	5433000	Sorry, I'm just picturing in my head
5433000	5435000	DarkSakura having a YouTube channel
5435000	5437000	Hey guys, welcome to my YouTube playthrough
5437000	5439000	of Mass Effect where I'm gonna fuck that
5439000	5441000	turian
5441000	5443000	Well, it's pretty much the theme of my Tumblr
5443000	5445000	Anyway
5445000	5447000	Um
5447000	5449000	You've got more options
5449000	5451000	in later games, thank God
5451000	5453000	Cause, it wasn't
5453000	5455000	very fair, I thought
5455000	5457000	You know, dudes should have been able to
5457000	5459000	strip Kaden
5459000	5461000	Sorry, right from the beginning
5461000	5463000	But no, you had to wait until the third game for that
5463000	5465000	Sorry guys
5465000	5467000	It was worth the payoff though, in the end
5467000	5469000	It was kind of sweet, even though I still think he's too nice
5469000	5471000	Oh my god, Liara
5471000	5473000	in the first game pissed me off so much
5473000	5475000	Because she's like
5475000	5477000	Oh, I'm 106 years old
5477000	5479000	But she's really, that's like
5479000	5481000	being 15
5481000	5483000	in Asari years
5483000	5485000	Oh god, I do not have time
5485000	5487000	for all of my rants
5487000	5489000	Anyway, real time battles, those are fun
5489000	5491000	You have
5491000	5493000	your health bar, you can keep your squad
5493000	5495000	members alive, you also have
5495000	5497000	a morality system
5497000	5499000	that
5499000	5501000	leads you more toward
5501000	5503000	the polite and selfless
5503000	5505000	versus aggressive and hostile
5505000	5507000	Which is now
5507000	5509000	It can be known as
5509000	5511000	Paragon or Renegade
5511000	5513000	Paragon being how to charm people
5513000	5515000	and Renegade being to intimidate them
5515000	5517000	But yes
5517000	5519000	I could go more and more
5519000	5521000	and more and more and more about the game
5521000	5523000	And
5523000	5525000	I wasn't really into it when it first
5525000	5527000	came out, it took me a while
5527000	5529000	Same, same
5529000	5531000	Well, wasn't I also the one that kind of told you
5531000	5533000	you had to play it, give it a second chance
5533000	5535000	I think I even said
5535000	5537000	you'd be into the Tumblr fandom
5537000	5539000	And then I heard Garrus' voice and it was
5539000	5541000	over
5541000	5543000	His voice actor
5543000	5545000	is a very handsome fellow
5545000	5547000	Kind of goofy, but
5547000	5549000	I saw the episode of Buffy he was in and it wasn't
5549000	5551000	a good episode, I'm sorry that such a
5551000	5553000	talented actor had to be in that episode
5553000	5555000	of Buffy, it was not good
5555000	5557000	Anyway
5557000	5559000	I really don't
5559000	5561000	know how much more
5561000	5563000	I can say about it
5563000	5565000	This since had
5565000	5567000	the first game had
5567000	5569000	more DLC, Bring Down the Sky
5569000	5571000	and then
5571000	5573000	what was it, when
5573000	5575000	Pinnacle Station, that one was
5575000	5577000	okay, I didn't care for it
5577000	5579000	because it had like all the
5579000	5581000	deathmatch and capture the flag stuff
5581000	5583000	that I don't think is fun
5583000	5585000	But the
5585000	5587000	game got really
5587000	5589000	great reviews across the board
5589000	5591000	For
5591000	5593000	For the Xbox 360 version
5593000	5595000	when it came out, Metacritic gave it a 91 out
5595000	5597000	of 100, so that's definitely not bad
5597000	5599000	But as far
5599000	5601000	as other
5601000	5603000	things, it won
5603000	5605000	for the year it came out, it won
5605000	5607000	Best RPG for the Spike Video Game
5607000	5609000	Awards, Teambox
5609000	5611000	Game Awards gave it Best Role Playing
5611000	5613000	Game of the Year, Best Story, Best Game of the Year
5613000	5615000	IGN, you know
5615000	5617000	it won across the board
5617000	5619000	on a lot of different
5619000	5621000	best of's
5621000	5623000	And of course now, He Who
5623000	5625000	Shall Not Be Named, right?
5625000	5627000	Honestly enough
5627000	5629000	he kind of ended a controversy about
5629000	5631000	this game
5631000	5633000	Wouldn't necessarily end the controversy, but he
5633000	5635000	he shot something down
5635000	5637000	Basically, there was a neo-conservator
5637000	5639000	blogger named Kevin McCollod
5639000	5641000	Remember that, Rob?
5641000	5643000	No. Anyway, he was
5643000	5645000	you know, going on saying
5645000	5647000	it had virtual
5647000	5649000	orgasmic rape and blah blah blah
5649000	5651000	blah blah, and
5651000	5653000	He Who Shall Not Be Named
5653000	5655000	literally
5655000	5657000	said, this contrived
5657000	5659000	controversy is absolutely ridiculous
5659000	5661000	and it made the other guy shut up
5661000	5663000	The guy who is the enemy of gamers
5663000	5665000	everywhere
5665000	5667000	A certain lawyer named Jack Voldemort, if I remember correctly
5667000	5669000	Told this guy to shut
5669000	5671000	the fuck up, and he shut the fuck up
5671000	5673000	He apologized
5673000	5675000	but said he's still considered the material offensive
5675000	5677000	And it's basically people talking
5677000	5679000	about shit in the game, who never fucking played
5679000	5681000	the game, who were being assholes
5681000	5683000	about it. Anyway
5683000	5685000	So, eventually we have
5685000	5687000	had other releases of
5687000	5689000	this game
5689000	5691000	Of course, I played it on PC
5691000	5693000	which, you know, I also
5693000	5695000	like modding the crap out of my game
5695000	5697000	We had
5697000	5699000	the Xbox 360 release
5699000	5701000	Did it come out on
5701000	5703000	It came out on PS3
5703000	5705000	Um
5705000	5707000	Eventually, you had to wait
5707000	5709000	for the Mass Effect trilogy, I think
5709000	5711000	for it to finally happen, but yeah
5711000	5713000	And then it came out on Wii U
5713000	5715000	Not the original Mass Effect
5715000	5717000	Mass Effect 3 did
5717000	5719000	The original Mass Effect was only on
5719000	5721000	PS3, Xbox 360
5721000	5723000	Xbox One backwards compatibility, and PC
5723000	5725000	Yeah, which I, you know, like I said
5725000	5727000	I played it on PC, modded the fuck out of it
5727000	5729000	So that it has like
5729000	5731000	The textures in my game
5731000	5733000	look better than Mass Effect 3
5733000	5735000	did when it came out, so
5735000	5737000	Those space dicks
5737000	5739000	looked so space dicky
5739000	5741000	That hot Turian dicking in HD
5741000	5743000	No, they didn't give us
5743000	5745000	naked Turians. They had models for it
5745000	5747000	Did you know that? Didn't put it in the game?
5747000	5749000	No, I did not know that
5749000	5751000	They had models for it
5751000	5753000	Anyway, and because of this game
5753000	5755000	I mean, now I've got a blog
5755000	5757000	that is quite literally
5757000	5759000	six people away from hitting 10,000
5759000	5761000	followers. Nerd
5761000	5763000	Fuck, I don't know how that happened
5763000	5765000	I didn't think I was that funny
5765000	5767000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says
5767000	5769000	There was this classic Fox News segment where Jeff Keighley
5769000	5771000	was talking about it, Mass Effect
5771000	5773000	And the opposing person admitted she had never even heard
5773000	5775000	of the game until about five minutes before going on the
5775000	5777000	air, and issued an apology
5777000	5779000	after being actually shown the scene in question
5779000	5781000	I do, I remember that controversy
5781000	5783000	Yeah, about what?
5783000	5785000	The sex scenes?
5785000	5787000	Yeah, the sex scenes in the game, basically
5787000	5789000	Casefully done, I'm on some fun
5789000	5791000	It was basically
5791000	5793000	Liara's space butt
5793000	5795000	Oh god
5795000	5797000	And so
5797000	5799000	But I mean
5799000	5801000	Yeah, actually
5801000	5803000	it's even brought up
5803000	5805000	The
5805000	5807000	Anchor's name was Martha McCollum
5807000	5809000	was her name
5809000	5811000	Anyway, anyway
5813000	5815000	It's just an awesome game
5815000	5817000	If you haven't played it, why the fuck not
5817000	5819000	if you've been listening to this show
5819000	5821000	the whole time
5821000	5823000	It's just really good, really fun
5823000	5825000	and really accessible
5825000	5827000	You can still get it on Steam
5827000	5829000	Or, I don't think it actually is on Origin
5829000	5831000	believe it or not
5831000	5833000	Because I bought mine only through Steam
5833000	5835000	I think it is on Origin now
5835000	5837000	Maybe now, but I think it took it a while for Origin
5837000	5839000	to actually update it since it
5839000	5841000	I think they had some license thing with Steam
5841000	5843000	Anyway, anyway
5843000	5845000	And of course, if anyone is interested
5845000	5847000	my Tumblr is
5847000	5849000	Mass Effecting
5849000	5851000	ing.tumblr.com
5851000	5853000	You can look at my stupid captions
5853000	5855000	that I've been doing for fuck knows
5855000	5857000	how long
5857000	5859000	And apparently, a few people like it
5859000	5861000	So
5861000	5863000	And if any of my Tumblr followers
5863000	5865000	are listening to this show, thank you for listening to the
5865000	5867000	episode

5983000	5985000	Welcome back everybody to Orange
5985000	5987000	Lounge Radio live tonight, episode
5987000	5989000	number 700 for
5989000	5991000	this, September the 17th of
5991000	5993000	2017, we've had a fun
5993000	5995000	show, fun show
5995000	5997000	so far tonight when I'm not getting tongue tied
5997000	5999000	where there was even cake and
5999000	6001000	fire, and cakes on fire
6001000	6003000	but we made a wish
6003000	6005000	Cake fire, what did you wish
6005000	6007000	for Dark Sakura when you blew out the
6007000	6009000	candles? If I tell you, then it won't come true
6009000	6011000	Well, let's be real, it's not going to come true anyway
6011000	6013000	because this is just a lie
6013000	6015000	that we tell little kids
6015000	6017000	I wished for impeachment
6019000	6021000	Or safe
6021000	6023000	Impeachment of me from the show?
6023000	6025000	No, you're not an official
6025000	6027000	Oh, you're right, that's right
6027000	6029000	I'm a cheer tater
6029000	6031000	Either that or you know
6031000	6033000	anvil, piano, the same thing I
6033000	6035000	want for Pat Robertson
6035000	6037000	Alright, we're going to get back into some more
6037000	6039000	gaming news, but I want to
6039000	6041000	thank you guys again for being here tonight
6041000	6043000	over in chat, over at live.vognetwork.com
6043000	6045000	JD in chat actually says, elect Rob
6045000	6047000	to public office 2018
6047000	6049000	You know I've thought about it, and I know I've said this
6049000	6051000	on the show before, because you guys know I've been with Alan
6051000	6053000	for over seven years, but before I was with Alan
6053000	6055000	a couple years before that
6055000	6057000	and I don't remember if he would have been on this show because
6057000	6059000	OLR was happening, but
6059000	6061000	I actually dated a guy for about a year and a half
6061000	6063000	who was a, well
6063000	6065000	he had run for state assembly, he didn't
6065000	6067000	win, thank god, but
6067000	6069000	he had won, he had run for public office
6069000	6071000	and I think I've said this before, from dating
6071000	6073000	him and the experiences that I went through
6073000	6075000	during that, I learned that
6075000	6077000	any idiot can run for office
6077000	6079000	and I think what you saw happen last
6079000	6081000	year probably just accentuates
6081000	6083000	that point, but any
6083000	6085000	idiot can run for office
6085000	6087000	Did you hear though that Eddie Izzard is running?
6087000	6089000	I did not. In the UK.
6089000	6091000	I did not. For, I think
6091000	6093000	for, not for PM
6093000	6095000	I'll have to look it up again, but still
6095000	6097000	there's a big article I posted
6097000	6099000	about it not too long ago, but Eddie Izzard
6099000	6101000	is running. Well and then don't forget our pal
6101000	6103000	Travis Donovan ran for
6103000	6105000	I think it was mayor of Killeen, where he
6105000	6107000	was, I think, so
6107000	6109000	remember he ran for office, unfortunately he didn't
6109000	6111000	it might have been city council, I forget, sorry, in retrospect
6111000	6113000	I know it was like a very local race
6113000	6115000	but it was cool to hear him go through that and talk
6115000	6117000	about that on his show
6117000	6119000	I've thought about it, but
6119000	6121000	I'm torn because
6121000	6123000	on one hand I'm like
6123000	6125000	okay, with all the footage
6125000	6127000	that's probably out there of me from the
6127000	6129000	Rocky Horror Picture Show and some of the like weird
6129000	6131000	shit I've said on stage, like I don't
6131000	6133000	know if I ever could get elected to public
6133000	6135000	office, or the vast 700
6135000	6137000	episode library of this program
6137000	6139000	somebody will take something out
6139000	6141000	of context and put it out there and
6141000	6143000	try to fuck with me if I were to run for office
6143000	6145000	but then... He's running for
6145000	6147000	parliament by the way. They had to listen to 700 episodes
6147000	6149000	of that show. Yeah, then
6149000	6151000	what great promotion for this show, but
6151000	6153000	then we elected a guy president
6153000	6155000	who said, you know, he was gonna grab
6155000	6157000	what did he say? Grabbing pussies. Grab him by
6157000	6159000	the pussy. Grab him by the pussy and that guy
6159000	6161000	got elected president. So then there's a part of me that's like
6161000	6163000	I guess it doesn't matter if I've said something stupid
6163000	6165000	that gets taken out of context. Well he probably didn't really want to get voted for
6165000	6167000	president, he just ended up becoming
6167000	6169000	president. Anyway, I didn't mean to make this political
6169000	6171000	but the story is really supposed to be that
6171000	6173000	yes, any idiot can run for
6173000	6175000	office and I've considered it
6175000	6177000	I think it would be interesting, I think it would be fun
6177000	6179000	I think I do
6179000	6181000	a good job listening to people and
6181000	6183000	playing mediators sometimes because
6183000	6185000	again, even though people might
6185000	6187000	try to take some of the stuff out of context that I've
6187000	6189000	done with Rocky Horror Picture Show
6189000	6191000	do you know how much fucking drama
6191000	6193000	there is in theater troupes?
6193000	6195000	Do you know how much fucking drama
6195000	6197000	has to be mediated when you're running a fucking
6197000	6199000	theater troupe?
6199000	6201000	And for a while
6201000	6203000	I did mediate that drama. I finally
6203000	6205000	passed that on to somebody else who mediates
6205000	6207000	it now and there's been no shortage
6207000	6209000	of drama but
6209000	6211000	for the years I did it
6211000	6213000	I did mediate a lot of drama and so
6213000	6215000	I think that's a skill that can be used
6215000	6217000	in public office quite frankly
6217000	6219000	so, anyway
6219000	6221000	there it is. Going into chat
6221000	6223000	over at live.vognetwork.com
6225000	6227000	actdeftinchat says are you really worried
6227000	6229000	about people taking you out of context
6229000	6231000	considering the lots of OLR edits there
6231000	6233000	are even done by yourselves
6235000	6237000	Editing is a powerful thing
6237000	6239000	and a powerful tool and I think it would be very easy
6239000	6241000	to take something I've said on this show out of context
6241000	6243000	and somebody could apply it to
6243000	6245000	a totally different thing that wasn't
6245000	6247000	about a video game or something
6247000	6249000	you know, that's just a reality
6249000	6251000	tigercolonchat says California did elect
6251000	6253000	an actor as its governor at one time
6253000	6255000	at two times actually
6255000	6257000	there wasn't just Schwarzenegger
6257000	6259000	one of those actors became president
6259000	6261000	Ronald Reagan was also an actor
6261000	6263000	way back in the day so was governor of California
6263000	6265000	Who's president of the United States?
6265000	6267000	Ronald Reagan, the actor?
6267000	6269000	and there's your Back to the Future reference
6269000	6271000	there it is, yes
6271000	6273000	alright, let's get back
6273000	6275000	into some actual video game talk now
6275000	6277000	we do have some games to get to
6277000	6279000	there's politicians out there
6279000	6281000	that play video games, you bet the guy I used to
6281000	6283000	date I think met his new boyfriend
6283000	6285000	husband, whatever, on World of Warcraft
6285000	6287000	so, maybe
6287000	6289000	they're married, I don't know, who cares? Alright, moving on
6289000	6291000	Loki, what do you have for us in games?
6291000	6293000	alright, so
6293000	6295000	this is kind of out of nowhere
6295000	6297000	but Okami HD
6297000	6299000	was announced for Playstation 4
6299000	6301000	Xbox One and PC
6301000	6303000	it's going to be coming out in December
6303000	6305000	it's going to feature 4K support
6305000	6307000	and
6307000	6309000	also widescreen as the original game
6309000	6311000	was just 4x3
6311000	6313000	so they'll be coming out December 12
6313000	6315000	digital and retail for
6315000	6317000	$19.99
6317000	6319000	that's a good price, yeah, looks pretty nice
6319000	6321000	nice
6321000	6323000	the game was kind of artistic anyway
6323000	6325000	so it's
6325000	6327000	maybe the best 4K game, but
6327000	6329000	it'll look nice, I'm sure
6329000	6331000	and then of course, because everyone's
6331000	6333000	up in arms, everybody
6333000	6335000	loves the new look of Mario without a shirt
6335000	6337000	and everything, so
6337000	6339000	now of course, take it
6339000	6341000	to modders
6341000	6343000	see, this is what happens when you trust
6343000	6345000	modders, they're going to remove clothing
6345000	6347000	and so now for
6347000	6349000	Super Smash Brothers
6349000	6351000	on the Wii U, they have a mod
6351000	6353000	where it's shirtless Mario
6353000	6355000	you can play as shirtless Mario
6355000	6357000	of course, of course
6357000	6359000	complete with Mario titty?
6359000	6361000	complete with Mario titties
6361000	6363000	as was meant to be
6363000	6365000	per Nintendo's own direct, clearly
6365000	6367000	alright, well, speaking of things
6367000	6369000	that Nintendo has changed
6369000	6371000	and apparently they have metal shirtless Mario as well
6371000	6373000	metal titties
6373000	6375000	even better, cut right through ya
6375000	6377000	moving on to other news out of Nintendo
6377000	6379000	hey, their Switch app
6379000	6381000	which was, it's kind of a mess
6381000	6383000	y'all, that Switch app was kind of a mess
6383000	6385000	but they're trying to fix some of the issues
6385000	6387000	with it, and one of the big ones
6387000	6389000	was fixed this week, the 1.10
6389000	6391000	update is out for the Nintendo
6391000	6393000	Switch app, and voice chat
6393000	6395000	will now work while in
6395000	6397000	the background, and while other apps
6397000	6399000	are up front and center, you know, just like
6399000	6401000	Skype and Discord and stuff have worked
6401000	6403000	forever, so Nintendo Switch app
6403000	6405000	finally moving into 2017
6405000	6407000	there ya go
6407000	6409000	so, anyway, it hasn't fixed
6409000	6411000	everything, but that was probably one of the biggest
6411000	6413000	problems with it, so congratulations
6413000	6415000	etc.
6415000	6417000	a little less congratulations
6417000	6419000	and more sadness towards the
6419000	6421000	fans of Battleborn
6421000	6423000	and probably hearing that the game is
6423000	6425000	pretty much done at this point, they're not pulling the plug
6425000	6427000	they're not taking the servers offline
6427000	6429000	but after the upcoming fall update
6429000	6431000	according to creative director Randy Varnell
6431000	6433000	the servers will stick
6433000	6435000	around for the foreseeable future, but
6435000	6437000	it's just going to be pretty much a static
6437000	6439000	game at that point, now in the fall update
6439000	6441000	there will be skins, there will be balance patches
6441000	6443000	but this is pretty much it
6443000	6445000	the game is really only about
6445000	6447000	not even a year and a half old, and it's been
6447000	6449000	free to play for three months, what happened
6449000	6451000	to Battleborn? Well, a little game
6451000	6453000	called Overwatch that came out around the same
6453000	6455000	time happened to Battleborn, so
6455000	6457000	Battleborn,
6457000	6459000	yeah, didn't do so great as a result
6459000	6461000	so there it is, Battleborn
6461000	6463000	is no longer going to really
6463000	6465000	be supported after
6465000	6467000	this next patch in the fall, but it'll still
6467000	6469000	be up if you're still playing it
6469000	6471000	moving on, Dark Soccer, what do you have for us in rapid fire
6471000	6473000	news? Oh, just some stuff
6473000	6475000	so a new
6475000	6477000	character is
6477000	6479000	been announced for Dragon Ball
6479000	6481000	Fighter Z, going on with
6481000	6483000	Yamcha and Tenshinhan
6483000	6485000	is going to be an original character
6485000	6487000	Jinzo Ningen 21
6487000	6489000	or
6489000	6491000	Nijuuji
6491000	6493000	she's got glasses
6493000	6495000	wears an interesting outfit
6495000	6497000	and is nowhere in
6497000	6499000	the series except this game
6499000	6501000	but she's going to figure into story mode
6501000	6503000	so, hey
6503000	6505000	I'm pretty excited, I like how she looks
6505000	6507000	she might be cosplay worthy
6507000	6509000	and then in
6509000	6511000	older news, there
6511000	6513000	is
6513000	6515000	Wonder Boy the Dragon's
6515000	6517000	Trap on
6517000	6519000	Nintendo Switch has outsold
6519000	6521000	all the other versions combined
6521000	6523000	so
6523000	6525000	and it's a really good game
6525000	6527000	it is, it's a great remake
6527000	6529000	although I wish that the
6529000	6531000	animal forms had like lady
6531000	6533000	forms to go with Wonder Girl
6533000	6535000	oh, I didn't even realize that that was missing
6535000	6537000	well, Wonder Girl is in there, just
6537000	6539000	no, I know Wonder Girl is there, but yeah
6539000	6541000	but every form is still like the fish man, the mouse man
6541000	6543000	I see, yeah
6543000	6545000	okay, well
6545000	6547000	the lion one's the coolest though because he drags the sword behind him
6547000	6549000	I love the whole you can hit a button
6549000	6551000	and instantly switch between like the Sega Master System
6551000	6553000	well, look, it's not
6553000	6555000	a direct port of the Master System game
6555000	6557000	because it's still on widescreen, no, it's a complete remake
6557000	6559000	yeah, but it looks
6559000	6561000	you wouldn't be able to tell the difference, really
6561000	6563000	you know, unless you are
6563000	6565000	really, really a careful eye, and it has
6565000	6567000	the FM music from the
6567000	6569000	Master System version, nice, which even
6569000	6571000	the cartridge, if you play it through an FM
6571000	6573000	capable one, the US cartridge
6573000	6575000	won't play it, nice
6575000	6577000	so, it's a good way to
6577000	6579000	get some of the stuff that we
6579000	6581000	lost back
6581000	6583000	going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com
6583000	6585000	Orange Right says
6585000	6587000	it's really great to play that on a portable
6587000	6589000	the Switch difference, with a trademark sign
6589000	6591000	around that, I think, I bought
6591000	6593000	Dragon's Trap on the Switch, and yeah
6593000	6595000	I mean, the Switch makes a compelling argument
6595000	6597000	for if it's the exact same game
6597000	6599000	that's being sold on Playstation 4
6599000	6601000	and Xbox One, the Switch makes a compelling argument
6601000	6603000	for, I can pick this up and play on the go, if I buy it here
6603000	6605000	that's why I kind of kicked myself
6605000	6607000	when I got Sonic Mania on Playstation 4
6607000	6609000	I mean, don't get me wrong, you know, it works
6609000	6611000	great on Playstation 4, and the game is still good
6611000	6613000	but I literally forgot it was coming out
6613000	6615000	on Switch, and I wish I'd bought it there
6615000	6617000	so, yeah
6617000	6619000	it'll be interesting to see what
6619000	6621000	Sony and Microsoft, if they choose
6621000	6623000	to do anything in response, well I guess Microsoft
6623000	6625000	kind of has the whole Windows 10 thing
6625000	6627000	so, it'll be interesting to see if Sony brings back the Vita
6627000	6629000	just kidding, I don't think they're going to do that
6629000	6631000	they'll probably just rely on the more power
6631000	6633000	that's in that system, as opposed to the Switch
6633000	6635000	I mean, let's be real, the Switch
6635000	6637000	is not capable of doing a game like
6637000	6639000	Horizon Zero Dawn, so the
6639000	6641000	Playstation 4 does always have that
6641000	6643000	Alright, let's travel around and check out
6643000	6645000	what is coming out in stores this week
6645000	6647000	Loki, what's going to be on shelves this week?

6699000	6701000	I don't know what that is

6741000	6743000	In Japan, it's actually a pretty similar story this week
6743000	6745000	for the Japanese releases
6745000	6747000	Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite
6747000	6749000	also gets its Japanese release this week

6755000	6757000	We already had that here in the US
6757000	6759000	Looks like it was a couple weeks later in Japan
6759000	6761000	So the Patapon PS4 releases this week
6761000	6763000	And Project Cars 2
6763000	6765000	also getting a Japanese release this week
6765000	6767000	All that on the Playstation 4
6767000	6769000	Over on the Nintendo Switch, just one release
6769000	6771000	this week, but it's a pretty big one
6771000	6773000	It's the Dragon Quest X all-in-one package
6773000	6775000	Speaking of online games
6775000	6777000	I would really like to see
6777000	6779000	make it released
6779000	6781000	out here, that's one of them
6781000	6783000	But also, actually I believe the Pokken Tournament
6783000	6785000	is also being released in Japan
6785000	6787000	Yes, it is, just a day later
6787000	6789000	That's why I missed it at the first glance
6789000	6791000	But Pokken Tournament does have the same day
6791000	6793000	release as in the US and
6793000	6795000	as even Europe as Star Soccer
6795000	6797000	I'll get into it in a moment
6797000	6799000	Certainly not leastly, on the Nintendo 3DS
6799000	6801000	this week, Pocket Monster
6801000	6803000	Gold and Silver
6803000	6805000	is going to be released on the 3DS
6805000	6807000	Of course, that is Pokemon Gold and Silver
6807000	6809000	There are actually going to be little
6809000	6811000	cards that you can buy in stores
6811000	6813000	to then do on the eShop
6813000	6815000	if you wanted to do it that way for whatever reason
6815000	6817000	That is what you have to look forward to
6817000	6819000	on the 3DS
6819000	6821000	How about the UK Dark Soccer? I may have spoiled
6821000	6823000	one of them, sorry, but that's a worldwide release
6823000	6825000	On the 18th we have Echo for PC
6825000	6827000	and PS4
6827000	6829000	On the 19th, Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite
6829000	6831000	for Xbox One, PlayStation 4
6831000	6833000	and PC
6833000	6835000	On the 22nd, we have Pokemon Gold and Silver
6835000	6837000	Pokken Tournament DX
6837000	6839000	The Lego Ninja Go
6839000	6841000	video game
6841000	6843000	on a bunch of stuff, and there you go
6843000	6845000	Alright, now we're going to
6845000	6847000	get to the mailbag
6847000	6849000	Music
6849000	6851000	Music
6851000	6853000	Music
6853000	6855000	Every week you guys email us your favorite

6857000	6859000	participate at orangeloungeradio.com
6859000	6861000	Sometimes it's feedback for the show
6861000	6863000	Sometimes it's, I don't know
6863000	6865000	a pat on the ass and a job well done
6865000	6867000	Sometimes it's
6867000	6869000	uh, fuck you, you fucking fuck
6869000	6871000	Sometimes it's got cake in the subject
6871000	6873000	line
6873000	6875000	Let's get to tonight's
6875000	6877000	email, Dark Soccer
6877000	6879000	Greetings peoples, this week
6879000	6881000	I had a truly unique experience at work
6881000	6883000	I talked to somebody
6883000	6885000	Lately I've been taking my Nintendo
6885000	6887000	Switch to work with me and playing Mario
6887000	6889000	plus Rabbids
6889000	6891000	One of my fellow employees
6891000	6893000	saw me playing the game and asked me what kind of game I was playing
6893000	6895000	I explained Mario plus Rabbids
6895000	6897000	like this. It's like chess
6897000	6899000	You have different kinds of pieces that can move and attack
6899000	6901000	in different ways. There's also two sides
6901000	6903000	who fight each other using tactics
6903000	6905000	and strategy along the way
6905000	6907000	Also there are Rabbids on acid
6907000	6909000	I thought this was a good
6909000	6911000	way to describe Mario plus Rabbids
6911000	6913000	Given how my coworker reacted
6913000	6915000	he must have thought differently
6915000	6917000	This experience brought up the following
6917000	6919000	question that I'd like your input on
6919000	6921000	What should I, why should I
6921000	6923000	continue talking to people? I mean
6923000	6925000	you all claim to be
6925000	6927000	sentient creatures, but some of you lack the sense
6927000	6929000	lack the sense the demigod
6929000	6931000	gave yeast. Stay drunk
6931000	6933000	or entertainment
6933000	6935000	Is that a flying spaghetti
6935000	6937000	monster reference? I'm not sure
6937000	6939000	It might be
6939000	6941000	So why should I
6941000	6943000	continue talking to people? That's the question for us
6943000	6945000	this week. Don't
6945000	6947000	If you don't want to talk to people
6947000	6949000	don't. Don't do anything you don't
6949000	6951000	want to do. I will say this
6951000	6953000	that people who don't talk to other people in an
6953000	6955000	office environment tend to
6955000	6957000	get the piss
6957000	6959000	end of reviews and
6959000	6961000	you know aren't as well
6961000	6963000	referred to because networking
6963000	6965000	in your office is the way you
6965000	6967000	You might be labeled a bitch if you don't
6967000	6969000	smile. Or just the weird girl
6969000	6971000	who sits in that cube with her headphones
6971000	6973000	Well that was me. I was the weird girl
6973000	6975000	that would sit in the cube with headphones
6975000	6977000	Um
6977000	6979000	But I actually hit my current job
6979000	6981000	I fit right in with everybody else
6981000	6983000	So, or you know what?
6983000	6985000	Find a job that has cool people at it
6985000	6987000	Find a job where you don't have to talk if you don't want to talk
6987000	6989000	Although I think it would be a good idea
6989000	6991000	You do want to like at least talk to yourself
6991000	6993000	in the mirror. Practice with your
6993000	6995000	voice once in a while. Say it with me
6995000	6997000	I'm good enough
6997000	6999000	I'm smart enough and doggone it
6999000	7001000	if people like me. Of course you should
7001000	7003000	Just to make sure you don't like forget how to talk
7003000	7005000	or that your voice doesn't go out or something like that
7005000	7007000	You should still practice. And to be fair
7007000	7009000	entertainment
7009000	7011000	Some people might be pretty cool if you give them a chance
7011000	7013000	and talk to them. So
7013000	7015000	You know. There is a person underneath the suit
7015000	7017000	That's right. Don't do anything you don't want to do
7017000	7019000	But at the same time, take a risk
7019000	7021000	Sometimes it can work out to your advantage
7021000	7023000	Say hi to somebody new today
7023000	7025000	And then listen for blackmail
7025000	7027000	Say hi to a stranger
7027000	7029000	No. Don't say hi to a stranger
7029000	7031000	Cause they'll just give you a weird look and try to shoot you
7031000	7033000	What if they have candy?
7033000	7035000	Next email
7035000	7037000	Hello LR. I write tonight
7037000	7039000	not to respond to something on last week's show
7039000	7041000	Not to plug anything of mine
7041000	7043000	And not to shower you with bad puns
7043000	7045000	Instead the reason for this email
7045000	7047000	Is two fold. First off
7047000	7049000	I want to congratulate you guys on your latest milestone
7049000	7051000	Thank you. Thank you
7051000	7053000	700 episodes sounds like a lot
7053000	7055000	Because it is. It is
7055000	7057000	It represents an enormous amount of work
7057000	7059000	Literal thousands of hours
7059000	7061000	Of headlines, insights, interviews
7061000	7063000	And discussions. Plus the occasional
7063000	7065000	Rant and the frequent food tangents
7065000	7067000	Ok. Just to
7067000	7069000	Math. I don't mean to bring math
7069000	7071000	Into this. But I'm going to. Cause I know there's at least
7071000	7073000	A couple math nerds out there. Now
7073000	7075000	If I take 700 episodes
7075000	7077000	And I multiply that by
7077000	7079000	3 hours an episode
7079000	7081000	Except our earlier ones were
7081000	7083000	The earlier episodes were 2 and lately
7083000	7085000	Our shows have been running like 2 and a half hours
7085000	7087000	But
7087000	7089000	We had marathon shows
7089000	7091000	We did E3 specials that weren't numbered
7091000	7093000	Technically we've
7093000	7095000	I should be able to count the spinoff shows like courthouse 2
7095000	7097000	So we're going to just say to make it easy
7097000	7099000	3 hours. 3 hours an episode
7099000	7101000	3 hour trainwrecks
7101000	7103000	You could count
7103000	7105000	The show you did on OLR where you did
7105000	7107000	Pub of the volume. Thank you
7107000	7109000	I'd love to bring that back if we had some licensing
7109000	7111000	Well. Or look at
7111000	7113000	Doing remixes
7113000	7115000	Of overclocked or something. I don't know. Who knows
7115000	7117000	Alright anyway. So that's 2100 hours
7117000	7119000	Ok. So I'm going to divide that
7119000	7121000	By how many hours in a day
7121000	7123000	24
7123000	7125000	87 and a half
7125000	7127000	Straight days of content
7127000	7129000	Geez
7129000	7131000	So you would
7131000	7133000	To marathon this entire show would take
7133000	7135000	About 3 months
7135000	7137000	Just something to think about there
7137000	7139000	For a minute
7139000	7141000	You've built a community and kept it quite
7141000	7143000	Entertained. As a part of that community
7143000	7145000	Allow me to say thanks very much
7145000	7147000	Not only for the massive body of work
7147000	7149000	But also for continuing to put
7149000	7151000	On this show each and every week
7151000	7153000	For our enjoyment. Seriously thank you so much
7153000	7155000	We'll keep meeting you at that dinner table
7155000	7157000	This is a direct comparison
7157000	7159000	But if we look at TV
7159000	7161000	One of the stats I like to
7161000	7163000	Point out a while back was
7163000	7165000	The longest running
7165000	7167000	Primetime television show
7167000	7169000	The Simpsons
7169000	7171000	618 episodes
7171000	7173000	We've passed The Simpsons now
7173000	7175000	South Park 278
7175000	7177000	Gunsmoke 635
7177000	7179000	Lassie
7179000	7181000	We have more episodes on Lassie
7181000	7183000	Fuck that dog
7183000	7185000	Alright so moving on
7185000	7187000	Second I wanted to tell you that in working
7187000	7189000	On the UI for super multitasking
7189000	7191000	I discovered something, something
7191000	7193000	Unbelievable. A fact that has been in front of my eyes
7193000	7195000	For years in front of all of our eyes
7195000	7197000	Actually but I never noticed it. Maybe none
7197000	7199000	Of us did. So here it is
7199000	7201000	The shift key on the right side of the standard PC
7201000	7203000	Keyboard is whiter than the shift key
7203000	7205000	On the left side of the standard PC keyboard
7205000	7207000	This seems to apply to every keyboard I
7207000	7209000	Have except for keyboards built into Mac laptops
7209000	7211000	Where the shift keys are the same size
7211000	7213000	He's right
7213000	7215000	Like I've never noticed. I'm looking at the key
7215000	7217000	And here I am looking at my Mac to confirm
7217000	7219000	That they're the same
7219000	7221000	Cause I'm on a Macbook Pro 2014
7221000	7223000	Ok well the studio computer, I have a little
7223000	7225000	Microsoft keyboard here that's probably as old as this show
7225000	7227000	But sure enough the shift key on the right
7227000	7229000	Is bigger than the one on the left
7229000	7231000	Is that the same thing on a PC laptop?
7231000	7233000	Yeah my laptop's like that
7233000	7235000	Huh
7235000	7237000	You know in about a couple
7237000	7239000	More years we're gonna have more episodes in the
7239000	7241000	My life too
7241000	7243000	If we make it that long
7243000	7245000	The show could end at any time
7245000	7247000	Any time kids
7247000	7249000	Any time
7249000	7251000	Well am I the only one who didn't realize
7251000	7253000	This up until now? Or is this a shocking
7253000	7255000	Revelation for everyone present?
7255000	7257000	Chatters! Press 1 if
7257000	7259000	Your mind has been blown
7259000	7261000	And by the way, yes Jamie
7261000	7263000	I have been double spacing in between sentences
7263000	7265000	For as long as I can remember
7265000	7267000	I did take a keyboarding class in high school
7267000	7269000	And I honestly can't remember whether I started doing that
7269000	7271000	Before or after
7271000	7273000	And there you have it! Have a great week everyone
7273000	7275000	Erin Yyr
7275000	7277000	Yeah it's something that's like
7277000	7279000	A very common thing for people
7279000	7281000	Who took typing
7281000	7283000	Or had teachers who
7283000	7285000	Used for computer classes
7285000	7287000	Or nuns who would smack you with a ruler
7287000	7289000	When you didn't do it the way you were supposed to
7289000	7291000	Whatever. The double spacing is
7291000	7293000	Let's see
7293000	7295000	We have two, we have one
7295000	7297000	We have a dash
7297000	7299000	I always knew, I knew always
7299000	7301000	Says fifth dream
7301000	7303000	Come on buntiful cakes
7303000	7305000	Says mind blown
7305000	7307000	There you go
7307000	7309000	What I'm curious about is
7309000	7311000	How did that come into
7311000	7313000	How did you find that out doing multitasking?
7313000	7315000	I mean I imagine the shift key does something in your game
7315000	7317000	But how did that become important
7317000	7319000	That the left key was not as big as the right key?
7319000	7321000	I'm curious now
7321000	7323000	Well I think that the reason why is that on the standard PC
7323000	7325000	It's done to line up with the enter key
7325000	7327000	Yeah
7327000	7329000	Because it's as long as the enter if I'm right
7329000	7331000	Right you're right, not on mine
7331000	7333000	Not on mine it is
7333000	7335000	Well and I was looking at my mac
7335000	7337000	And those two were the same but my return key
7337000	7339000	Is the same size as my caps lock
7339000	7341000	So the whole thing is fairly symmetrical
7341000	7343000	Until you get to the arrow buttons
7343000	7345000	Doesn't have to do with where your pinky
7345000	7347000	Or your fourth finger goes when you hit the shift key
7347000	7349000	Like if it doesn't stick out
7349000	7351000	Far enough on the right side you might not hit it
7351000	7353000	I don't know but now I need to
7353000	7355000	Look at my iMac keyboard
7355000	7357000	And see if it's set up the same way
7357000	7359000	Because Mavis Beacon taught me how to type
7359000	7361000	Who?
7361000	7363000	Mavis Beacon
7363000	7365000	Like the grandma of internet typing
7365000	7367000	Right whatever
7367000	7369000	I learned to type getting into
7369000	7371000	A speed contest with my roommate at the time
7371000	7373000	Because
7373000	7375000	I wanted to be able to keep up with the AOL chat room
7375000	7377000	Never forget
7377000	7379000	F F F space J J J J
7379000	7381000	Space F F F F space
7381000	7383000	J J J J
7383000	7385000	Guess you didn't take typing
7385000	7387000	I didn't take typing
7387000	7389000	Mavis Beacon taught me
7389000	7391000	I learned on my own time
7391000	7393000	I didn't formally
7393000	7395000	Or through any type of instruction
7395000	7397000	Learn to touch type
7397000	7399000	I was kind of typing already
7399000	7401000	But then I was like well maybe I should like learn to type faster
7401000	7403000	So I started doing Mavis Beacon
7403000	7405000	Teaches typing and I got faster
7405000	7407000	Okay
7407000	7409000	I learned through AOL
7411000	7413000	Because of reasons
7413000	7415000	And that's it for emails?

7431000	7433000	Alright but keep it classy
7433000	7435000	Doesn't have to be a clean joke but keep it classy
7435000	7437000	Alright
7437000	7439000	Let's get back into some gaming news. Loki
7439000	7441000	Alright
7441000	7443000	So I'll try to be positive
7443000	7445000	Because we're talking about Nintendo
7445000	7447000	Good luck with that
7447000	7449000	We're talking about some classic systems
7449000	7451000	Sending prayers
7451000	7453000	So Reggie basically said
7453000	7455000	Hey
7455000	7457000	We know that the demand
7457000	7459000	Is really high on these systems
7459000	7461000	However I strongly urge you
7461000	7463000	To overbid on SNES classic system
7463000	7465000	On any auction sites
7465000	7467000	You shouldn't have to pay more than
7467000	7469000	$79.99 he says
7469000	7471000	And promising that they're going to have
7471000	7473000	More systems
7473000	7475000	Available at launch
7475000	7477000	That you know
7477000	7479000	Okay not maybe plentiful
7479000	7481000	But it will be
7481000	7483000	Easier to find them
7483000	7485000	So
7485000	7487000	Don't buy from scalpers
7487000	7489000	Which really is good advice you should buy from scalpers
7489000	7491000	But kind of unheard of
7491000	7493000	That they also announced
7493000	7495000	That in 2018
7495000	7497000	They're bringing back the NES classic
7497000	7499000	So apparently you know
7499000	7501000	There is a huge response obviously
7501000	7503000	The demand is so high for the system
7503000	7505000	That they decided that they're going to be bringing it back
7505000	7507000	Summer of 2018
7507000	7509000	With brand new shipments
7509000	7511000	So
7511000	7513000	Interesting. Wonder if it's going to have different games with it this time
7513000	7515000	Probably not
7515000	7517000	I think the only thing that will
7517000	7519000	Probably have changed on that system
7519000	7521000	Is however they hacked into that the first time
7521000	7523000	Will probably be patched up
7523000	7525000	And I can't believe nobody else is bringing this up
7525000	7527000	At least not that I've read
7527000	7529000	Like people are either going the route that you're going
7529000	7531000	Or like oh maybe it'll be a 2.0 with new games
7531000	7533000	Which ain't going to happen
7533000	7535000	Or it's just the whole
7535000	7537000	Oh they're finally remaking what they did before
7537000	7539000	I don't think so
7539000	7541000	I think there will be a change in that firmware
7541000	7543000	And it's going to block whatever method they were using
7543000	7545000	Now don't get me wrong
7545000	7547000	I'm not stupid enough to say that
7547000	7549000	But I'm just
7549000	7551000	I am saying they're going to block whatever
7551000	7553000	Has been doing
7553000	7555000	Whatever is the method now
7555000	7557000	A good indicator will be the SNES classic edition
7557000	7559000	When that comes out to see
7559000	7561000	What's capable of that
7561000	7563000	I'm assuming that will be hacked immediately
7563000	7565000	I would assume the same would be the NES classic
7565000	7567000	Honestly I don't know
7567000	7569000	Like I get it
7569000	7571000	That people like to do that stuff
7571000	7573000	But you know what the people like to do that stuff
7573000	7575000	They probably would still
7575000	7577000	They're not going to not buy
7577000	7579000	It's just that they like all their stuff
7579000	7581000	In one spot
7581000	7583000	Although they're classic games in one spot
7583000	7585000	Take the fucking hint
7585000	7587000	Perhaps release the virtual console
7587000	7589000	Perhaps you could even make
7589000	7591000	A virtual console
7591000	7593000	Since you're dicking around with a virtual console on the Switch
7593000	7595000	Make a system that's like the NES classic edition
7595000	7597000	That hey guess what
7597000	7599000	It looks all retro and shit
7599000	7601000	And it connects to the internet
7601000	7603000	It connects the fucking ROMs to it
7603000	7605000	And make it affordable
7605000	7607000	Stopy in chat says yes
7607000	7609000	I too expect a patch to combat hacking
7609000	7611000	Original ones will still go for money because of it
7611000	7613000	Over at live.vognetware.com
7613000	7615000	It is a little weird that they're suddenly
7615000	7617000	Coming out and saying they're going to make more of them
7617000	7619000	But at the same time
7619000	7621000	Is it super surprising? Not really
7621000	7623000	I'd be curious to see how many
7623000	7625000	Are going to make how readily available they're going to be
7625000	7627000	And if companies like GameStop or
7627000	7629000	ThinkGeek lock them behind
7629000	7631000	Like a paywall to get that shit
7631000	7633000	I'm also going to say this to Reggie's credit
7633000	7635000	I know it's very easy to be cynical
7635000	7637000	About what he's saying and believe me
7637000	7639000	There's a large part of me that's very
7639000	7641000	Cynical as well and I definitely feel
7641000	7643000	Actions speak louder than words Reggie
7643000	7645000	So if that's Super Nintendo
7645000	7647000	If pre-orders are not supposed to be
7647000	7649000	The barometer for availability for this thing
7649000	7651000	Then I hope you're able to prove it
7651000	7653000	Day one, actions speak louder than words
7653000	7655000	But at the same time
7655000	7657000	I'm hopeful that that action
7657000	7659000	Is coming based on the fact that
7659000	7661000	He said anything at all
7661000	7663000	Cause let's be real
7663000	7665000	He didn't have to say a goddamn thing
7665000	7667000	So there's a part of me that's thinking
7667000	7669000	Maybe there is
7669000	7671000	Hope for people
7671000	7673000	That do not yet have a Super Nintendo
7673000	7675000	Pre-order but still want
7675000	7677000	To get one of these. I mean that is a pretty
7677000	7679000	Powerful statement for Reggie
7679000	7681000	To come out and say, don't buy from
7681000	7683000	Scalpers, we gotcha
7683000	7685000	Now again
7685000	7687000	I wouldn't
7687000	7689000	I come from a place of pre-order
7689000	7691000	Privilege with this because
7691000	7693000	I do have a pre-order, at least right now
7693000	7695000	I still have my pre-order with Best Buy
7695000	7697000	But I like to think that even
7697000	7699000	If I didn't have that pre-order secured right now
7699000	7701000	I would
7701000	7703000	Feel a little better about
7703000	7705000	This but I'd probably still be going right
7705000	7707000	At 8 AM or whenever the store
7707000	7709000	Opens the day these things come out
7709000	7711000	I still don't think they're gonna be that plentiful
7711000	7713000	But maybe instead
7713000	7715000	Of stores only getting
7715000	7717000	24 of them or whatever it was
7717000	7719000	Last time, I have to ask Allen how many it was when he went
7719000	7721000	Remember when he camped out at Best Buy and still couldn't get one?
7721000	7723000	Maybe
7723000	7725000	Instead of 24 per store
7725000	7727000	Maybe there will be
7727000	7729000	72. You know, maybe the number's
7729000	7731000	Gonna be a lot higher
7731000	7733000	And something where people that do line up
7733000	7735000	And bother to wait
7735000	7737000	Will get one. So we'll see
7737000	7739000	We'll see
7739000	7741000	Alright
7741000	7743000	SHA 100 Mountain Chat says
7743000	7745000	Rumor is that
7745000	7747000	Targets are getting 30-90 stocks
7747000	7749000	Of Super Nintendo Classic
7749000	7751000	I'll believe it when I see it
7751000	7753000	Alright, let's move on to
7753000	7755000	Some more stories
7755000	7757000	Including a story about Final Fantasy 14
7757000	7759000	No, I'm not gonna be
7759000	7761000	Doing a big commercial for the MMO
7761000	7763000	But I do think it's kinda neat
7763000	7765000	That because of the hurricanes that have happened
7765000	7767000	Recently here in the US, namely of course
7767000	7769000	Harvey and Irma
7769000	7771000	Which, you know, obviously those images
7771000	7773000	Of the things that Harvey did in Houston
7773000	7775000	And what Irma was doing to the keys
7775000	7777000	You know, is really horrible what's going on
7777000	7779000	And we talked about that last week
7779000	7781000	Well, I don't know if you know this, but in Final Fantasy 14
7781000	7783000	If you don't log into the game
7783000	7785000	And go into your house
7785000	7787000	Every something like 45-90 days
7787000	7789000	I think it is
7789000	7791000	I can't remember exactly how many days it is
7791000	7793000	I wanna say it's as far as 90 days
7793000	7795000	But it might be as low as 45
7795000	7797000	But if you don't go into the house regularly
7797000	7799000	It is demolished and the space
7799000	7801000	Can be sold off to somebody else
7801000	7803000	You get all the junk that was in your house
7803000	7805000	Go to like a refund vendor
7805000	7807000	Or something that you can still do for 30 days
7807000	7809000	And you get some of the guild reimbursed
7809000	7811000	But not all of it, but this system's in place
7811000	7813000	We'll have to ask Allen about it because
7813000	7815000	He didn't log into the game for so long, his house got demolished
7815000	7817000	I was on
7817000	7819000	When the demolition notice popped up
7819000	7821000	I'm sure mine is long ago
7821000	7823000	Well, did you ever buy a house?
7823000	7825000	No, I just have a guild room
7825000	7827000	Then you're fine
7827000	7829000	Those don't go away unless I delete it
7829000	7831000	Or whoever, no because you went to a different guild
7831000	7833000	I went to a different guild
7833000	7835000	Whoever your guild master is, as long as they didn't delete it
7835000	7837000	Or kick you out of the guild then you still have it
7837000	7839000	But anyway
7839000	7841000	My point with all that is that
7841000	7843000	Final Fantasy XIV and Square Enix
7843000	7845000	They actually put a stay on that
7845000	7847000	So right now they did a patch last night
7847000	7849000	That stopped the clock
7849000	7851000	Or not last night, it was Thursday night
7851000	7853000	They did a patch that stops the clock
7853000	7855000	It's been two weeks
7855000	7857000	Yeah, two weeks starting on September 15th
7857000	7859000	So there will be a two week grace period
7859000	7861000	With no demolitions
7861000	7863000	So this way people that are without power
7863000	7865000	Or not able to log into the game for other reasons right now
7865000	7867000	Will have an additional two weeks
7867000	7869000	To get to a computer, log in
7869000	7871000	And be able to keep their game
7871000	7873000	And keep the house going and all that stuff
7873000	7875000	I would imagine a lot of people just had
7875000	7877000	A friend log in on their behalf
7877000	7879000	But of course that involves giving your password away
7879000	7881000	Which you're not supposed to do
7881000	7883000	I'd be lying if I said I haven't done it in a similar scenario
7883000	7885000	So somebody I really really trust
7885000	7887000	Alright, there you go
7887000	7889000	I just think that's kind of neat
7889000	7891000	That the MMO is changing its rules to accommodate for
7891000	7893000	The real world scenario
7893000	7895000	Alright, Stoppy in chat says
7895000	7897000	More like Final Foreclosure
7897000	7899000	Am I right? Yes, yes you're right
7899000	7901000	Alright, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
7901000	7903000	Stuff
7903000	7905000	Actually this one is
7905000	7907000	Another way that video games
7907000	7909000	Have done good things for people
7909000	7911000	And actually this comes from
7911000	7913000	Rome actually
7913000	7915000	A Serbian father
7915000	7917000	Who was living in
7917000	7919000	Italy
7919000	7921000	Actually had his thirteen year old daughter
7921000	7923000	Trapped for four years
7923000	7925000	To sell her
7925000	7927000	To a buyer in France for
7927000	7929000	Eighteen thousand dollars
7929000	7931000	Yeah, good dad there
7931000	7933000	And she
7933000	7935000	Actually used
7935000	7937000	A video game
7937000	7939000	To help herself escape
7939000	7941000	Um
7941000	7943000	So I'm trying to find exactly
7943000	7945000	What it was
7945000	7947000	Um
7947000	7949000	She was being groomed
7949000	7951000	To be a child bride
7951000	7953000	And um
7953000	7955000	She
7955000	7957000	Oh, hold on
7957000	7959000	I'm sorry this is taking me a moment
7959000	7961000	Anyway
7961000	7963000	She had
7963000	7965000	Been in school until she was thirteen
7965000	7967000	And then she was locked up
7967000	7969000	But she had
7969000	7971000	A video game on a
7971000	7973000	Simless cell phone
7973000	7975000	That she would play
7975000	7977000	But one day she got an alert
7977000	7979000	That she had
7979000	7981000	A weak
7981000	7983000	Password free wifi network
7983000	7985000	Near her
7985000	7987000	And so she used the wifi network
7987000	7989000	On the video game to find
7989000	7991000	A multiplayer feature on the game
7991000	7993000	That she used
7993000	7995000	To help
7995000	7997000	Call for help
7997000	7999000	She said that a lot of people ignored her
7999000	8001000	Until they took it seriously
8001000	8003000	And she gave the person the information
8003000	8005000	And then the police were able to track her down
8005000	8007000	So um
8007000	8009000	She's under police protection
8009000	8011000	Her asshole dad is in jail
8011000	8013000	I hope the guy in France who was trying to buy her
8013000	8015000	Is in jail
8015000	8017000	Because that shit is not cool
8017000	8019000	Yeah
8019000	8021000	But um she used a video game
8021000	8023000	It's interesting you know these stories
8023000	8025000	Sometimes we've heard the dark side about how MMOs
8025000	8027000	Result in really bad
8027000	8029000	Situations for people when maybe young
8029000	8031000	People meet people they met online
8031000	8033000	On an MMO or something we've heard kind of the bad side of that
8033000	8035000	So it's nice to hear the good side
8035000	8037000	Too not that this story is necessarily
8037000	8039000	Good because we get into this whole
8039000	8041000	Element of human trafficking which is a really
8041000	8043000	You know sick thing that's happening in our society
8043000	8045000	And it's one of those things where it's like
8045000	8047000	I think a lot of us don't realize that this
8047000	8049000	Shit happens in the world and it's pretty sick
8049000	8051000	But the good news is that
8051000	8053000	This girl was saved
8053000	8055000	Because of whatever it's curious that they
8055000	8057000	Don't name the game she was playing
8057000	8059000	But perhaps it's nothing we would recognize anyway
8059000	8061000	Since she was in Italy right
8061000	8063000	So you know it could be a game that was localized
8063000	8065000	For you know Italian audiences anyway
8065000	8067000	But it sounds like it was something where you could
8067000	8069000	Interact with other players so thanks
8069000	8071000	To the chat in the game you know she
8071000	8073000	Got rescued she was able to put out that call for help
8073000	8075000	So that's that's great
8075000	8077000	And that's great that her dad was too stupid
8077000	8079000	To think of that that that could be a possibility
8079000	8081000	Yeah so
8081000	8083000	Good on her yep
8083000	8085000	Hope she's able to
8085000	8087000	Turn life around and have a
8087000	8089000	Great life in spite of that
8089000	8091000	Really really really truly her hideous
8091000	8093000	Experience yeah so
8093000	8095000	Alright anyway
8095000	8097000	Let's see going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com
8097000	8099000	Kind of an interesting
8099000	8101000	Story again about kind of like the good things
8101000	8103000	Of gaming and you know kind of piggybacking on
8103000	8105000	The Final Fantasy story
8105000	8107000	We had a minute ago as Joe and Hunter Matt says
8107000	8109000	I remember when Hurricane Sandy hit
8109000	8111000	New York there was a mall in Connecticut
8111000	8113000	That had power and offered free
8113000	8115000	High-speed internet for people who are without power
8115000	8117000	From the storm I remember seeing a
8117000	8119000	Dude with his PC rig hooked up in the food
8119000	8121000	Court of this mall doing his
8121000	8123000	Wow dailies
8123000	8125000	Maybe not what was
8125000	8127000	Intended the Wi-Fi to be used for
8127000	8129000	But people have their priorities
8129000	8131000	All over the place actually when I
8131000	8133000	Was in Alabama a couple years ago
8133000	8135000	I went to the Dunkin Donuts
8135000	8137000	And someone was there
8137000	8139000	Two people were there with a full PC rig
8139000	8141000	Playing MMOs
8141000	8143000	You know and in spite of
8143000	8145000	I'm sure some could make an argument that
8145000	8147000	The internet traffic maybe shouldn't have
8147000	8149000	Been taken up by that but at the same token
8149000	8151000	You know in times
8151000	8153000	Of crisis like people's mental
8153000	8155000	Health is a very serious thing and maybe
8155000	8157000	If this is what this guy kind of had
8157000	8159000	To do to
8159000	8161000	Take a mental break from the stress
8161000	8163000	Of the situation then
8163000	8165000	Is it really that bad
8165000	8167000	As long as everybody else's internet was working then
8167000	8169000	You know so be it right
8169000	8171000	Anyway let's move on
8171000	8173000	Just a couple more stories for you guys then we're gonna
8173000	8175000	Open up the Skype line if any of you want to call in
8175000	8177000	And say hello here on episode 700
8177000	8179000	You'll have that ability shortly at
8179000	8181000	Orange Lounge Radio all one word on Skype
8181000	8183000	Please if you've never called the show
8183000	8185000	Before give Echo123
8185000	8187000	A call first just to test your connection
8187000	8189000	Meanwhile Loki
8189000	8191000	I'm excited to see CEOs step down
8191000	8193000	From their posts but
8193000	8195000	I'm gonna have to report
8195000	8197000	That CEO Kazurai
8197000	8199000	The parody account on Twitter
8199000	8201000	Is gonna be retiring
8201000	8203000	2018
8203000	8205000	Just uh
8205000	8207000	The parody account
8207000	8209000	The parody account yes
8209000	8211000	It'd be funny if he came back it's like
8211000	8213000	Somebody else like another CEO
8213000	8215000	Well did you read the letter from the guy
8215000	8217000	Who was running it and kind of
8217000	8219000	You know I guess the gist I got
8219000	8221000	From it was that well the joke's running out
8221000	8223000	And I don't really have the motivation
8223000	8225000	That I once had yeah it was basically
8225000	8227000	No here's what he says
8227000	8229000	For over eight years now
8229000	8231000	I've been running this Twitter account originally started
8231000	8233000	Because I wanted to make jokes about video game news
8233000	8235000	Rumors press conferences but I knew
8235000	8237000	Nobody in real life would have
8237000	8239000	Um knew
8239000	8241000	Nobody in real life that would have gotten them
8241000	8243000	Um between then and
8243000	8245000	Now I have somehow
8245000	8247000	Really managed to gain over
8247000	8249000	100,000 followers
8249000	8251000	Uh this has included people in the games media
8251000	8253000	That I read on a daily basis
8253000	8255000	People that I have worked with
8255000	8257000	Some of my favorite games and most importantly
8257000	8259000	Of all um Shuhei Yoshida
8259000	8261000	And um you know
8261000	8263000	Just it's been fun from the very start
8263000	8265000	Ton of fun but it's been um
8265000	8267000	You know looks like it's getting hard
8267000	8269000	You know recently though I've been tweeting a lot less often
8269000	8271000	Um you know
8271000	8273000	I still play spend plenty of time playing
8273000	8275000	I spend a lot less time following video game news
8275000	8277000	Um basically saying
8277000	8279000	Therefore I've decided to
8279000	8281000	That in 2018 will be the last year of the Twitter account
8281000	8283000	Um
8283000	8285000	So he says I want to do an account
8285000	8287000	For one more for
8287000	8289000	E3 I also want to give myself
8289000	8291000	To do a proper ending
8291000	8293000	For the account I just don't know what it is
8293000	8295000	Going to be yet and
8295000	8297000	I'm rubbish at giving things up
8297000	8299000	So be interesting
8299000	8301000	He used the word rubbish
8301000	8303000	Must be overseas
8303000	8305000	But all joking
8305000	8307000	Aside and sleuthing on who might be running
8307000	8309000	It aside
8309000	8311000	It's interesting that there's such a
8311000	8313000	Lead time on this you know what I mean
8313000	8315000	I'm ending it after the next
8315000	8317000	E3 which is still a good nine months away
8317000	8319000	So
8319000	8321000	That would be like me saying Orange Lounge
8321000	8323000	Radio is going to be done in the
8323000	8325000	Year 2020
8325000	8327000	It's just quite a lead time
8327000	8329000	Yeah it's I don't know
8329000	8331000	Don't take me serious I don't
8331000	8333000	This show is going to keep going
8333000	8335000	Until it doesn't
8335000	8337000	That's what I pretty much always said
8337000	8339000	Alright
8339000	8341000	Anyhow
8341000	8343000	One more story for you guys before we
8343000	8345000	Call it a night here and get to your calls
8345000	8347000	Let's talk about Mario 64
8347000	8349000	How about a new mod
8349000	8351000	For Mario 64
8351000	8353000	Well I don't know if I would call it a mod
8353000	8355000	It's kind of weird because I don't think they exactly
8355000	8357000	Modded the cartridge I think what they had to do
8357000	8359000	They went in here and they actually like
8359000	8361000	Did a patch for the emulator
8361000	8363000	I think they like mod the emulator
8363000	8365000	So instead of just hacking the ROM this tool for
8365000	8367000	Mario 64 will let you
8367000	8369000	Go into the virtual
8369000	8371000	RAM of the emulator and then
8371000	8373000	It shares information
8373000	8375000	So that you can play
8375000	8377000	Super Mario 64 online
8377000	8379000	That's right up to
8379000	8381000	24 people playing
8381000	8383000	Super Mario 64 online
8383000	8385000	With each other
8385000	8387000	You can play as other characters too
8387000	8389000	You can play as Waluigi which I think is very important
8389000	8391000	To point out
8391000	8393000	Princess Peach, Rosalina
8393000	8395000	And what's great is they all play differently
8395000	8397000	Like Princess Peach has her floaty
8397000	8399000	That you would expect right
8399000	8401000	And Wario's in there and a lot of the other Mario characters
8401000	8403000	Toad it looked like he ran really fast
8403000	8405000	And you control each other
8405000	8407000	What's that?
8407000	8409000	Oh you control each other too?
8409000	8411000	You can beat up each other and kill each other
8411000	8413000	Oh that's awesome
8414000	8416000	Well they already did against his first video that he put up
8416000	8418000	Kinda yeah like the video got
8418000	8420000	Taken down for the music
8420000	8422000	Because they did use the music from
8422000	8424000	Mario 64 in the trailer at least
8424000	8426000	IGN because I guess IGN
8426000	8428000	Doesn't get strikes on their channel because it looks like they
8428000	8430000	Reposted it they just reposted the video on their channel
8430000	8432000	And it's up it's fine you can see it
8432000	8434000	So yeah just do check it out
8434000	8436000	I do know that they had like a
8436000	8438000	Website that's dedicated to their forms
8438000	8440000	Or whatever that you should probably check out
8440000	8442000	Just because I'm assuming that you know all these
8442000	8444000	He has the links to the downloads
8444000	8446000	In the actual videos
8446000	8448000	But you know if you want to check out the forms
8448000	8450000	It's sm64o.com
8450000	8452000	And
8452000	8454000	You know check out the updates on there
8454000	8456000	But yeah I watched some gameplay of it today
8456000	8458000	And it looks fucking hilarious
8458000	8460000	Just like even watching people like there's
8460000	8462000	I saw two people doing a
8462000	8464000	120 star run or whatever
8464000	8466000	And like during it
8466000	8468000	One of the guys like was sitting there
8468000	8470000	Doing like an animation or something
8471000	8473000	And he put them behind it was funny
8473000	8475000	It's just I don't know it's really cool
8475000	8477000	You can see each other but it's not entirely
8477000	8479000	In sync so you'll see like
8479000	8481000	For example like when you're throwing the bomb king
8481000	8483000	Or whatever off the mountain you'll see kind
8483000	8485000	Of Mario spinning around there's like he's holding
8485000	8487000	Nothing it's just like kind of spinning around
8487000	8489000	But it's it's neat I don't know
8489000	8491000	The 24 players at one time that
8491000	8493000	I want to see some
8493000	8495000	Awesome games done quick with that
8495000	8497000	Nobody asked for this
8497000	8499000	Before we open up the skype line which we're about
8499000	8501000	To get to here so if you want to give us a call
8501000	8503000	Orange Lounge Radio all one word
8503000	8504000	On skype
8504000	8506000	JD in our chat says regarding
8506000	8508000	The last story about the
8508000	8510000	Advanced notice of ending the account
8510000	8512000	JD says I don't know in some ways
8512000	8514000	It's kind of nice to give your fans some warning
8514000	8516000	If it's possible though
8516000	8518000	You know it may in some cases
8518000	8520000	It's not always possible you know
8520000	8522000	I don't know what will happen with OLR
8522000	8524000	I don't like to think about ending the show right now
8524000	8526000	It's just kind of one of those that's why I say it'll be done
8526000	8528000	When it'll be done if we can give notice
8528000	8530000	I think we will but if we can't
8530000	8531000	Putting you on notice
8531000	8533000	Then we're not going to be able to
8533000	8535000	It just kind of depends on what the situation is you know
8535000	8537000	I just think but maybe
8537000	8539000	Do you think maybe there's too much
8539000	8541000	Notice
8541000	8543000	Nine months
8543000	8545000	That's a lot of notice
8545000	8546000	Just saying
8546000	8547000	Yeah so anyway
8547000	8549000	I don't know it's not necessarily a bad thing
8549000	8551000	I guess didn't Lost
8551000	8553000	Set their series finale like two
8553000	8555000	Years in advance because Lost was kind of
8555000	8557000	Starting to fall up it's own ass a bit
8557000	8559000	So they the ABC was like
8559000	8561000	We're going to set the end date now so that you know
8561000	8563000	When the story needs to be wrapped up
8563000	8565000	We also know like
8565000	8567000	Game of Thrones is going to be the end too
8567000	8569000	Yeah that's true
8569000	8571000	We've known that for a while but that's Game of Thrones is also
8571000	8573000	Based on books even though the books aren't done
8573000	8575000	They've so deviated
8575000	8577000	Yeah well yeah at this point
8577000	8579000	Hasn't George RR Martin kind of told them what's
8579000	8581000	Supposed to happen in the books not that I guess that it matters
8581000	8583000	They do deviate from the books but
8583000	8585000	Not as much as Walking Dead deviates
8585000	8587000	Though right? Doesn't Walking Dead deviate
8587000	8589000	A lot more? I don't know
8589000	8591000	I don't know because I don't care about Walking Dead
8591000	8593000	Well and those shows are all on Sunday night
8593000	8595000	Yeah
8595000	8597000	I mean I was able to watch the entire run
8597000	8599000	Of Twin Peaks but the whole on demand
8599000	8601000	Element of that really helped so there was that
8601000	8603000	Alright
8603000	8605000	The Skype line is open right now
8605000	8607000	Over at Orange Lounge Radio
8607000	8609000	All one word on Skype
8609000	8611000	If you'd like to give us a call you can do that right now
8611000	8613000	In the meantime I'm going to check in
8613000	8615000	While we wait for some calls and see if Loki has any
8615000	8617000	Last minute stories
8617000	8619000	Yes apparently there is some modders that are
8619000	8621000	Making a demake of Half Life 2
8621000	8623000	In Half Life 1's engine
8623000	8625000	Called Half Life 2 Classic
8625000	8627000	And it looks
8627000	8629000	Old
8629000	8631000	As Half Life 1 would look
8631000	8633000	But yeah
8633000	8635000	So apparently they have
8635000	8637000	A demo that's available on ModDB
8637000	8639000	So go search for Half Life 2 Classic
8639000	8641000	And you can check out what they've got so far
8641000	8643000	Which
8643000	8645000	I don't know
8645000	8647000	The fans continuing to
8647000	8649000	Deliver on Half Life when Valve will not
8649000	8651000	You know
8651000	8653000	They never asked if
8653000	8655000	Whether they could it's just whether
8655000	8657000	They should have
8657000	8659000	Dungeon Buster in chat pointing out
8659000	8661000	Regarding TV
8661000	8663000	The Americans is also ending in a season or two
8663000	8665000	I don't even know that show
8665000	8667000	I have to look to Critical Myth reviews
8667000	8669000	To tell me what's popular on
8669000	8671000	TV right now because a lot of times I don't know
8671000	8673000	But I just look at whatever John and his team is writing
8673000	8675000	About Dungeon Buster in chat
8675000	8677000	Also says this last season of
8677000	8679000	Game of Thrones isn't based on any book
8679000	8681000	Just a general outline
8681000	8683000	By Martin and then Bob
8683000	8685000	Coffee caught your reference that I also
8685000	8687000	Caught with what you just said saying life
8687000	8689000	Finds a way
8689000	8691000	Orange Lounge Radio
8691000	8693000	Again all one word on Skype
8693000	8695000	If you want to give us a call here on our 700th
8695000	8697000	Episode not that I'm guilting you
8697000	8699000	Into it but
8699000	8701000	Or is Skype working?
8701000	8703000	Hopefully somebody in chat if somebody
8703000	8705000	Is trying to call and is not getting through
8705000	8707000	Let me know because I know
8707000	8709000	Bobby was having calls
8709000	8711000	C Rama says we're not answering
8711000	8713000	This happened earlier
8713000	8715000	On another note speaking of Mario 64
8715000	8717000	So apparently there's another guy
8717000	8719000	I think the guy that was maybe doing
8719000	8721000	I don't know if this is the same one that did the editor
8721000	8723000	Like the Mario thing but he made
8723000	8725000	Infinite size levels
8725000	8727000	For Super Mario 64
8727000	8729000	So he's got like a level that's like
8729000	8731000	Mario Kart or something that Mario is running in
8731000	8733000	That's ridiculous
8733000	8735000	Oh it's in the WooHoo Island is actually where he's running around
8735000	8737000	Wow that's crazy
8737000	8739000	All these mods man
8739000	8741000	So apparently
8741000	8743000	Some of our listeners
8743000	8745000	I was worried about this because remember how Bobby tried to call us
8745000	8747000	At the end of the show and it wouldn't work
8747000	8749000	But I'm on right now
8749000	8751000	And I got the little green check mark
8751000	8753000	Did you close it and open it again?
8753000	8755000	I'm turning it off and then on again
8755000	8757000	I have turned it off
8757000	8759000	And I've now turned it back on
8759000	8761000	So we'll see if it'll work
8761000	8763000	And what we'll do there
8763000	8765000	We'll give it a minute just to see if anyone gets through
8765000	8767000	If not shoot
8767000	8769000	I should have had Plan B
8769000	8771000	Up and ready to go
8771000	8773000	But I didn't
8773000	8775000	But we can always I guess field questions from chat
8775000	8777000	If we have to do it that way but that's going to frustrate me
8777000	8779000	Because that's even worse
8779000	8781000	That's even worse than when Skype wouldn't work at all
8781000	8783000	At least I could kind of see that
8783000	8785000	So wait a minute
8785000	8787000	Did the recent count just go up?
8789000	8791000	Am I just not seeing the calls
8791000	8793000	Come through because I see that this person
8793000	8795000	Has tried to call twice
8799000	8801000	Do they have a way to turn off notifications or something?
8801000	8803000	I'm not sure
8803000	8805000	I'm not sure
8809000	8811000	It's that wonderful window
8811000	8813000	I went into tools options
8813000	8815000	And it's like think think think
8815000	8817000	I'm trying to go into and this is the beauty of radio
8817000	8819000	Everybody is that sometimes
8819000	8821000	Let's see uh yes
8821000	8823000	I don't want sounds but notification setting
8823000	8825000	When somebody tries to
8825000	8827000	Call me
8827000	8829000	Yes I should see that
8829000	8831000	Ugh
8831000	8833000	That's awful
8835000	8837000	Alright well
8837000	8839000	On our 700th episode
8839000	8841000	How appropriate that everything
8841000	8843000	Shutting down
8843000	8845000	I'm going to see
8845000	8847000	If I can quickly put together plan B
8847000	8849000	Can you guys fill like two minutes?
8849000	8851000	Sure
8851000	8853000	Let me sign out of Skype here
8853000	8855000	While I put together plan B
8855000	8857000	The joys of live radio
8857000	8859000	Take it away low key in our soundtrack
8859000	8861000	Do you have any stories we haven't covered?
8861000	8863000	No I have not
8863000	8865000	It's very slow
8865000	8867000	Well I can see what I can dig up
8867000	8869000	Umm
8869000	8871000	I've been building with Legos
8871000	8873000	While we've been doing this
8873000	8875000	See because they have wonderful programs
8875000	8877000	One through Bricklink which is called
8877000	8879000	Stud.io or Studio
8879000	8881000	And you can actually build stuff
8881000	8883000	With digital Legos basically
8883000	8885000	And what's kind of cool about it though
8885000	8887000	Is when you're done building it
8887000	8889000	You can build parts
8889000	8891000	So I decided as an experiment
8891000	8893000	Just to kind of learn the editor for this
8893000	8895000	I'm building my house
8895000	8897000	And so it's just been
8897000	8899000	Laying out floor plans
8899000	8901000	And stuff like that right now until I can
8901000	8903000	Get something that looks proportionally
8903000	8905000	Correct
8905000	8907000	Are you going to put your house in your house?
8907000	8909000	Yes
8909000	8911000	Actually my idea
8911000	8913000	My idea was if I can make
8913000	8915000	You know some good
8915000	8917000	Box that I would give them
8917000	8919000	To my kids as Christmas gifts
8919000	8921000	Because they would have
8921000	8923000	Their own set and it would be cool
8923000	8925000	Cause one of the ones I was going to do
8925000	8927000	Cause I really like the Lego movie
8927000	8929000	Stuff where they had kind of the remix sets
8929000	8931000	So like they have one that's a fire
8931000	8933000	Truck mech
8933000	8935000	And so my
8935000	8937000	Son wanted a garbage truck
8937000	8939000	Mech and I found a garbage truck
8939000	8941000	Design that's one of their
8941000	8943000	Official sets that I thought that could work
8943000	8945000	Well for that with just a little bit of tweaking
8945000	8947000	And so I'm
8947000	8949000	Going to do that eventually but right now
8949000	8951000	While I'm learning
8951000	8953000	How to actually use the editor I was going to start with something
8953000	8955000	Easier like my house
8955000	8957000	Which would be cool cause I just built
8957000	8959000	One of the creator sets
8959000	8961000	The fish
8961000	8963000	Was the old fish shack or something like that
8963000	8965000	Fish store
8965000	8967000	And that was pretty sweet
8967000	8969000	Kind of gave me a lot of fun ideas
8969000	8971000	This is all part of the stupid obsession crap that I have now
8971000	8973000	God damn Legos man
8973000	8975000	I swear to god
8975000	8977000	Such a mistake to
8977000	8979000	Shouldn't have gone to the Lego store
8979000	8981000	Should not have gone to the Lego store
8981000	8983000	But now I'm just like
8983000	8985000	Running low on money because of stupid Legos
8985000	8987000	I keep looking at that Millennium Falcon
8987000	8989000	It's so expensive
8989000	8991000	And not really worth it
8991000	8993000	I mean it's worth it if you're a fan of
8993000	8995000	Star Wars I'm not that big of a fan of
8995000	8997000	Star Wars
8997000	8999000	And here's the other problem too with those
8999000	9001000	A lot of the collector sets like the modular buildings
9001000	9003000	One they're way overpriced
9003000	9005000	And two like
9005000	9007000	For like my kids plan like I wanted
9007000	9009000	I have the choice between
9009000	9011000	One of the modular buildings
9011000	9013000	Or the fish store
9013000	9015000	One that I got
9015000	9017000	And I went with the fish store one cause my son wanted a
9017000	9019000	Diving mask for the mini figs
9019000	9021000	And they had tons of them in there
9021000	9023000	And so the only problem with the fish store
9023000	9025000	Is it's meant as more of a
9025000	9027000	Display piece
9027000	9029000	Than being able to play with it
9029000	9031000	Cause it's too tight to get your hand
9031000	9033000	In there to actually move the
9033000	9035000	Figures around or even the moveset
9035000	9037000	It's just such a cramped thing
9037000	9039000	And they even designed like the staircase going up to the office
9039000	9041000	Where a mini fig can't even fit through there
9041000	9043000	So I wanted to make something
9043000	9045000	More that they can actually
9045000	9047000	It's open and they can play with but it looks nice
9047000	9049000	Okay I have Skype Plan B set up
9049000	9051000	Alright cool
9051000	9053000	I'm gonna hope it works
9053000	9055000	But I don't know until we get a call
9056000	9058000	So instead of Skype natively running through the computer
9058000	9060000	What I've done is I went and grabbed my iPad
9060000	9062000	Which is a new iPad
9062000	9064000	It looks like it might be working so we're gonna see right now
9064000	9066000	If this actually works
9066000	9068000	If I hook it up this way taking the call through my iPad
9068000	9070000	I'm trying to take this call
9070000	9072000	And let's see if it works
9072000	9074000	Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio who's this?
9074000	9076000	Yay Plan B works
9076000	9078000	Yay Plan B

9080000	9082000	And we didn't need a prescription
9082000	9084000	Thank God for Plan B
9084000	9086000	Hey friend
9086000	9088000	Oh wait wait are we playing a cam game now?
9088000	9090000	Are we really doing it?
9090000	9092000	We're on the iPad
9092000	9094000	I got video
9094000	9096000	Hey he can see you too
9096000	9098000	The official alcoholic temperature
9098000	9100000	Of Orange Launch Radio and the vlog
9100000	9102000	Fireball
9102000	9104000	I think that is
9104000	9106000	Ewww veto
9106000	9108000	I think that is part of
9108000	9110000	That might actually be a Brad reference
9110000	9112000	Brad from Pod Culture reference
9112000	9114000	Let me check
9114000	9116000	I'm gonna check our audio out
9116000	9118000	When it's running here
9118000	9120000	Sorry Rama can you tell us a little more
9120000	9122000	About your drink that you're having there

9210000	9212000	I'm not
9212000	9214000	I'm surprised you don't have a bottle of wine there
9214000	9216000	I'm kinda surprised I don't either
9216000	9218000	But maybe I think something about
9218000	9220000	I'm actually gonna be giving you my bottles of
9220000	9222000	Moscato when I can't drink them anymore
9222000	9224000	Oh darn free wine what am I gonna do

9230000	9232000	Well Rama anything else you
9232000	9234000	Want to say here on episode 700 I appreciate
9234000	9236000	You beta testing this whole
9236000	9238000	Plan B setup but
9238000	9240000	At least we know it works now
9240000	9242000	In IT a beta test is
9242000	9244000	Generally the real deal so it's all or nothing
9244000	9246000	As a
9246000	9248000	Famous YouTube viral clip once
9248000	9250000	Said fuck it we'll do it live
9250000	9252000	There you go and by the way
9252000	9254000	Metroid returns
9254000	9256000	Samus is fucking amazing
9256000	9258000	That game is awesome and since we
9258000	9260000	Are on video I have a chance to show
9260000	9262000	The listeners that call in tonight the beauty
9262000	9264000	Of my Samus 3DS
9264000	9266000	Which is amazing
9266000	9268000	And I love it so
9268000	9270000	And I have to say I can't
9270000	9272000	Give GameStop as much shit as I used
9272000	9274000	To because I got
9274000	9276000	A collector's edition from their store
9276000	9278000	On Saturday you can give them as much shit
9278000	9280000	As you want okay what's the I have to admit
9280000	9282000	I missed the collector's edition so what is

9324000	9326000	And when I
9326000	9328000	Went looking online just to see if I could
9328000	9330000	Make sure I could find it it seems in the UK
9330000	9332000	They got the legacy
9332000	9334000	Edition which was more stuff I'm like
9334000	9336000	Fuck yeah I thought I saw something on Twitter
9336000	9338000	Where like this guy had like a ton
9338000	9340000	Of that stuff it was like
9340000	9342000	There was a sculpture
9342000	9344000	Amiibo it was all this crap
9344000	9346000	This is awesome art book
9346000	9348000	Yeah but you know what
9348000	9350000	From GameStop I got a box
9350000	9352000	Of Reese's Puff cereal can't top that
9352000	9354000	Why?
9354000	9356000	I don't know I have a couple friends that work at
9356000	9358000	GameStop I guess when you
9358000	9360000	Picked up your copy of Metroid you got
9360000	9362000	No no Ramy you don't need to answer that
9362000	9364000	Why the fuck not Loki
9364000	9366000	That's weird
9366000	9368000	Why the fuck not
9368000	9370000	Because it's weird
9370000	9372000	No it's not weird
9372000	9374000	Peanut butter is amazing in all forms and should be encouraged
9374000	9376000	There's a bottle
9376000	9378000	There's a thing of Jif right on top of my microwave
9378000	9380000	Okay crunchy style
9380000	9382000	Good times good times
9382000	9384000	Alright my friend I'm gonna let you go to try and squeeze in some more calls since we lost some time here
9384000	9386000	With the skype segment but
9386000	9388000	I appreciate you as always hearts
9388000	9390000	And good luck with everything on anime jam session this week
9390000	9392000	Oh you got it you take care
9392000	9394000	Yeah bro and play more Metroid
9394000	9396000	Duh you don't have to tell me twice
9396000	9398000	Alright see you my friend
9398000	9400000	Alright bye
9400000	9402000	So skype now works if you want to give us a call
9402000	9404000	At
9404000	9406000	Orange Lounge Radio all one word on skype
9406000	9408000	And we figured that out so again it is hooking up
9408000	9410000	At my ipad
9410000	9412000	Through my mixing board and what was happening
9412000	9414000	There earlier is that I had him plugged into
9414000	9416000	A port where admittedly it was the left channel
9416000	9418000	Only but that's because only on
9418000	9420000	Some things will it work on the
9420000	9422000	Left and the right channel where it's mono
9422000	9424000	And I fixed all that so
9424000	9426000	Now they said the only bummer
9426000	9428000	Is that if you don't actually catch a call
9428000	9430000	You're gonna hear the ringing noise
9430000	9432000	I thought I'd picked up a call
9432000	9434000	But apparently that didn't happen
9434000	9436000	So if that person wants to call right back
9436000	9438000	We'll try to get them on
9438000	9440000	Again it's Orange Lounge Radio all one word on skype
9440000	9442000	I think the bummer about the ipad
9442000	9444000	Is it takes a minute to connect
9444000	9446000	Versus the other one
9446000	9448000	Takes a minute to come through
9449000	9451000	Live on our 700th episode
9451000	9453000	Of Orange Lounge Radio
9455000	9457000	Whew
9457000	9459000	So house-ception I only overheard part of that conversation
9459000	9461000	You're gonna give it to your kids someday
9461000	9463000	Well I thought about like it would be cool to like
9463000	9465000	Design a set
9465000	9467000	For my kids that's like unique
9467000	9469000	I like that
9469000	9471000	That's a good idea alright let's see if maybe this call
9471000	9473000	Is coming through now I think it is
9473000	9475000	Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this
9475000	9477000	Hi this is Elliot B
9477000	9479000	Are you calling all the way from overseas
9479000	9481000	Or are you still in New York now
9481000	9483000	No I'm still in New York although it is a bit late here
9483000	9485000	It's a little bit later but not like crazy later
9485000	9487000	Well welcome to the show thanks for being here
9487000	9489000	Yeah hey it's great to see you guys on camera
9489000	9491000	Thank you
9491000	9493000	Happy 700th
9493000	9495000	We weren't supposed to be but things being as they are
9495000	9497000	That's how it worked
9497000	9499000	So thank you very much
9499000	9501000	What's on your mind tonight
9501000	9503000	It was actually my birthday today
9503000	9505000	One minute left of it
9505000	9507000	Happy birthday
9507000	9509000	It is my good pal
9509000	9511000	It's his birthday today too
9511000	9513000	He was one of the hosts of Koopa Club
9513000	9515000	When that show was still around
9515000	9517000	So toast to birthdays
9519000	9521000	What's on your mind tonight
9521000	9523000	Well so I actually want to talk music games
9523000	9525000	Please
9525000	9527000	I managed to find
9527000	9529000	I was in a second hand game shop
9529000	9531000	In New York
9531000	9533000	And found a second hand copy
9533000	9535000	For $20
9535000	9537000	Did it have the controller with it too?
9537000	9539000	Right so not only
9539000	9541000	Did it come with a controller it came with two
9541000	9543000	Turn tables and a mic
9543000	9545000	Oh nice
9545000	9547000	Bexong two turn tables and a microphone
9547000	9549000	That was like a collector's edition at one point
9549000	9551000	Wasn't there like a collector's edition you could buy
9551000	9553000	They had the one that was
9553000	9555000	The collector's edition
9555000	9557000	Actually had like a case
9557000	9559000	That turned into a table
9559000	9561000	So it had like a fold out thing
9561000	9563000	To put the actual turn tables on
9563000	9565000	That is a
9565000	9567000	DJ Hero 2 is like severely
9567000	9569000	Underrated as far as music games
9569000	9571000	Go too because well have you had a chance to play it?
9571000	9573000	Yeah yeah quite a bit
9573000	9575000	What do you think? I was playing it this weekend
9575000	9577000	I really like it I mean it's very very technical
9577000	9579000	I was surprised by how
9579000	9581000	How complex the controls are how many
9581000	9583000	Buttons and knobs and
9583000	9585000	Sliders there are
9585000	9587000	You know there's so many kind of things
9587000	9589000	I'm used to kind of you know Guitar Hero
9589000	9591000	Where you're just like you've got five notes
9591000	9593000	And then maybe the hammer-ons and stuff
9593000	9595000	And here you've got like you've got a crossfade
9595000	9597000	And you've got to turn the dial
9597000	9599000	And you've got to scratch in different ways
9599000	9601000	And yeah
9601000	9603000	Yeah it's very different it's not like Beatmania
9603000	9605000	2DX which is really easy to compare
9605000	9607000	To be right there's a lot of other stuff
9607000	9609000	That goes on but I think
9609000	9611000	That game is tragically underrated
9611000	9613000	Really and it just kind of it kind of fell
9613000	9615000	Out because they oversaturated
9615000	9617000	What was going on with Guitar Hero
9617000	9619000	And Band Hero and all that stuff kind of
9619000	9621000	Kind of oversaturated that market
9621000	9623000	And it's a real bummer that DJ Hero kind of paid
9623000	9625000	The price for that because that series is awesome
9625000	9627000	And I really love the concept of
9627000	9629000	Mixing the two songs together I think some of the
9629000	9631000	Remixes that came out of those games are like the best
9631000	9633000	I don't remember if it was in the game itself
9633000	9635000	Or it was DLC but there is like a
9635000	9637000	There's a Mary J. Blige versus
9637000	9639000	Queen it's
9639000	9641000	It's all of
9641000	9643000	Me and Radio Gaga I think
9643000	9645000	That is such a good mix
9645000	9647000	It's so good
9647000	9649000	Like that is like
9649000	9651000	That song is like one of my favorite things to come out of
9651000	9653000	A music game ever
9653000	9655000	Oh I have to look out for that no I don't think I've unlocked it yet
9655000	9657000	Yeah either it might be
9657000	9659000	See I feel like it might have been in DLC but
9659000	9661000	Hopefully the DLC is still out there
9661000	9663000	Yeah I really like the fact
9663000	9665000	That it likes to do freestyle and stuff
9665000	9667000	The improvisational aspects
9667000	9669000	Like is missing from so many music
9669000	9671000	Games there's no creation going on
9671000	9673000	Right and you know it may just be
9673000	9675000	Like playing samples to a beat
9675000	9677000	But that bit is so much fun
9677000	9679000	It's so rewarding
9679000	9681000	Oh yeah it's great and yeah
9681000	9683000	The fact that some music games that are done today
9683000	9685000	Are kind of done a little bit lazier
9685000	9687000	Where they're not really key sounded
9687000	9689000	And I think with DJ Hero you had those key sounds
9689000	9691000	So it's like if you were playing things off beat
9691000	9693000	Or you are freestyling the key sounds
9693000	9695000	Would kind of come out in the game and I think it's
9695000	9697000	So much more effective than some of these lazier
9697000	9699000	Music games that don't really
9699000	9701000	Like you don't notice when you make mistakes if that makes sense
9701000	9703000	Yeah exactly
9703000	9705000	Well Elliot I'm very jealous
9705000	9707000	Of your fine there
9707000	9709000	Only 20 bucks for that
9709000	9711000	I'm going to have to keep my eye out at some of the local thrift stores
9711000	9713000	And see if maybe I can find a version of that
9713000	9715000	Of course I don't even
9715000	9717000	GameStop has that stuff
9717000	9719000	Do they?
9719000	9721000	I bought DJ Hero 2 because I already had the turntables
9721000	9723000	I bought a copy for like 2 dollars
9723000	9725000	I bought mine really cheap too
9725000	9727000	At a dimple
9727000	9729000	I wish there was a way to play it on Xbox One
9729000	9731000	But see there's been too many changes
9731000	9733000	With the last gen
9733000	9735000	Was it on PC?
9735000	9737000	No well it was wireless
9737000	9739000	I have a
9739000	9741000	I had a demo
9741000	9743000	Controller
9743000	9745000	So one of my controllers is wireless
9745000	9747000	One of them is wired
9747000	9749000	Which they never made a wired controller for that
9749000	9751000	But I bought the
9751000	9753000	Was it the
9753000	9755000	Demo unit because I got it early
9755000	9757000	With 3 songs
9757000	9759000	Alright well we'll have to keep our eyes peeled
9759000	9761000	But Elliot it's good to hear from you
9761000	9763000	Thanks for calling in on this episode tonight
9763000	9765000	Yeah congrats, happy anniversary
9765000	9767000	Isn't anniversary? Happy big number
9767000	9769000	Happy big number, I think that's a good way to put it
9769000	9771000	There was cake, happy cake
9771000	9773000	Indeed, yeah
9773000	9775000	It was weird cake, I saw it on Twitter
9775000	9777000	Awesome, alright you take care my friend, thanks for calling
9777000	9779000	Bye, have a good night
9779000	9781000	Alright, Orange Lounge Radio
9781000	9783000	All one word on Skype if you want to get through
9783000	9785000	I could probably squeeze in one more call here
9785000	9787000	Before we wrap things up for the night
9787000	9789000	And I think we have one coming in right now
9789000	9791000	So I'm going to try to take it
9791000	9793000	If it will connect, if the video will go through
9793000	9795000	Of course I'm hitting the button
9795000	9797000	And the iPad takes a little bit longer than the PC
9797000	9799000	Does to do this, but when the PC doesn't work
9799000	9801000	This is what you use, but I think we're finally connected
9801000	9803000	Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
9803000	9805000	Hey this is Raginator
9805000	9807000	Hey Raginator, good to hear from you, what's up my friend?
9807000	9809000	Not much, well first
9809000	9811000	Just want to say happy
9811000	9813000	700
9813000	9815000	And with any luck
9815000	9817000	You guys will make it to at least
9819000	9821000	1337
9821000	9823000	So we can officially be elite
9823000	9825000	Yeah, how many, let's see
9825000	9827000	If it took us 15 years to get this far
9827000	9829000	Then it would probably take us about another 15 years
9829000	9831000	To get that far
9831000	9833000	So we would be looking at
9833000	9835000	First off I would be pushing
9835000	9837000	I would be 54 years old
9837000	9839000	At that point
9839000	9841000	And it would be the year 2032
9841000	9843000	If I'm not mistaken
9843000	9845000	And Half Life 3 still won't be out
9845000	9847000	And Half Life 3 still won't be out
9847000	9849000	So
9849000	9851000	Now
9851000	9853000	I did have a
9853000	9855000	Question in my
9855000	9857000	Right now
9857000	9859000	It's kind of eluding me
9859000	9861000	While I was trying to conduct
9861000	9863000	But
9863000	9865000	Now
9865000	9867000	I know
9867000	9869000	This is going to be really
9869000	9871000	I'm making a
9871000	9873000	Lousy radio
9873000	9875000	Because I'm doing picture
9875000	9877000	But I mean
9877000	9879000	No secret that
9879000	9881000	I've been having PC
9881000	9883000	PC problems
9883000	9885000	Yeah
9885000	9887000	This is the kind of connector that
9887000	9889000	My new fan
9889000	9891000	Found on my computer
9891000	9893000	It looks like there's a tiny little plug
9893000	9895000	With three pins on it
9895000	9897000	And a big old honking
9897000	9899000	Four pins on it
9899000	9901000	Let's see if I can
9901000	9903000	Aim it on the inside of my computer
9903000	9905000	I don't see many places
9905000	9907000	Where I can plug
9907000	9909000	This is totally
9909000	9911000	This is totally a tech support call
9911000	9913000	Going on right now
9913000	9915000	Yeah I don't see anything
9915000	9917000	Right where that fan
9917000	9919000	Can plug in
9919000	9921000	Do you?
9921000	9923000	No because it's too fucking dark
9923000	9925000	I can't see anything in that picture
9925000	9927000	They plug in out of the power supply
9927000	9929000	So if you have a modular power supply
9929000	9931000	You may be able to do that
9931000	9933000	Or the other thing you can do too
9933000	9935000	Is you can buy just at a PC store
9935000	9937000	Like a splitter
9937000	9939000	So it will have a splitter that will be able to
9939000	9941000	You plug it in and you can split it off
9941000	9943000	To build
9943000	9945000	You may not have
9945000	9947000	See on yours
9947000	9949000	If you're using a modular supply with like
9949000	9951000	SATA drives
9951000	9953000	You may not have the old molex connectors
9953000	9955000	Because they don't use those anymore
9955000	9957000	For the SATA drives
9957000	9959000	I would check if you still have
9959000	9961000	If it is a modular
9961000	9963000	Power supply
9963000	9965000	You may have some cables
9965000	9967000	For those molex connectors
9967000	9969000	They should have something or at the very least
9969000	9971000	There's
9971000	9973000	Something you can
9973000	9975000	Possibly buy to split it
9975000	9977000	Or if you really want to you can cut it
9977000	9979000	And splice it in there
9979000	9981000	Hey look you're getting offers from our chat
9981000	9983000	Rama says if you send the photos
9983000	9985000	He'll link you to everything you need
9985000	9987000	Chatters helping chatters
9987000	9989000	I love it
9989000	9991000	Now to try to bring this
9991000	9993000	Call back to actual gaming
9993000	9995000	Not tech support
9995000	9997000	Now
9997000	9999000	Now
9999000	10001000	One thing
10001000	10003000	You may have been noticing
10003000	10005000	Is that
10005000	10007000	Is the way I've been talking more and more
10007000	10009000	About
10009000	10011000	GLG.com and probably
10011000	10013000	A little bit less about Steam
10013000	10015000	Not to have anything
10015000	10017000	Against Steam you know I love
10017000	10019000	A lot of you got me started on
10019000	10021000	Steam
10021000	10023000	Is there any
10023000	10025000	On games on
10025000	10027000	GOG that may not
10027000	10029000	Necessarily be on Steam
10029000	10031000	That you would recommend
10031000	10033000	That you know either I
10033000	10035000	Or
10035000	10037000	Listeners in general may be
10037000	10039000	Overlooking
10067000	10069000	Good old Civilization game
10069000	10071000	Especially the original if not some of the sequels
10071000	10073000	I really wish those would show up on
10073000	10075000	Good old games
10075000	10077000	I know Colonization showed up
10077000	10079000	Which is pretty good
10079000	10081000	I haven't played that one through GOG myself
10081000	10083000	But that is
10083000	10085000	I think they have not only
10085000	10087000	The actual original
10087000	10089000	Colonization game from the late 90's
10089000	10091000	But I think they have the reimagining
10091000	10093000	They did around Civ IV
10093000	10095000	Because Civ IV they did like a
10095000	10097000	Colonization but yeah
10097000	10099000	Anything with Sid Meier's name in the title I'd recommend
10099000	10101000	I think Alpha Centauri is on Good old games too
10101000	10103000	Yeah I'm not
10103000	10105000	Actually I'm not
10105000	10107000	Too terribly positive
10107000	10109000	But I'm
10109000	10111000	Just like
10111000	10113000	64 chance
10113000	10115000	In favor of at least
10115000	10117000	Civ III be on
10117000	10119000	GOG
10119000	10121000	You know I'm
10121000	10123000	Reasonably sure that
10123000	10125000	They did have a
10125000	10127000	Promotion where
10127000	10129000	Now you can
10129000	10131000	Buy it
10131000	10133000	Add it
10133000	10135000	On the
10135000	10137000	Front page
10137000	10139000	Yeah
10139000	10141000	I'm noticing too some other recommendations
10141000	10143000	From chat where Dungeon Buster says the gold
10143000	10145000	Box series from SSI on GOG
10145000	10147000	Is good but is really hardcore
10147000	10149000	CRPG's
10149000	10151000	There you go
10151000	10153000	I think again the old
10153000	10155000	Oh Castles
10155000	10157000	Is another old game I bought on there because I used to play that game on PC
10157000	10159000	Like a long time ago I think it was actually Castles 2
10159000	10161000	But yeah
10161000	10163000	Dip in the archive of old
10163000	10165000	Shit from the 90's you're gonna find a gold mine
10165000	10167000	Alright
10167000	10169000	Well I'm sure
10169000	10171000	I'm taking up way too much of your time
10171000	10173000	There's probably some other people
10173000	10175000	That want to call but
10175000	10177000	Have a nice day and thanks for all the years
10177000	10179000	That you've been doing the show
10179000	10181000	Definitely been making my Sunday nights
10181000	10183000	You are most welcome
10183000	10185000	My friend appreciate the call
10185000	10187000	In and good luck with Rama
10187000	10189000	Solving the tech support issue which now Rama is offering
10189000	10191000	To do a live tech support show
10191000	10193000	Here at VoG I think it would be great
10193000	10195000	I'd love it so alright take care my friend
10195000	10197000	Alright have a good one bye
10197000	10199000	Actually you know if there's not enough calls for tech
10199000	10201000	Support oops if I don't mute it then you guys
10201000	10203000	Hear all the Skype noises sorry
10203000	10205000	What you're using Skype this is totally
10205000	10207000	Unprofessional man
10207000	10209000	I don't listen to this show anymore
10209000	10211000	So yeah I mean you guys
10211000	10213000	If they were to do a show like that I think it would be
10213000	10215000	Hilarious even if they didn't just do tech support
10215000	10217000	Cause you know there's probably not gonna be enough people
10217000	10219000	Listening really in all realness
10219000	10221000	To fix all the tech problems but
10221000	10223000	They could do you know tech advice
10223000	10225000	And tech help and
10225000	10227000	Life hacks if you will
10227000	10229000	Or computer hacks I don't know anyway
10229000	10231000	So I don't think we're gonna
10231000	10233000	Get any other calls so I think I'm gonna go ahead and shut off
10233000	10235000	The Skype line for now which I guess to do that
10235000	10237000	I would just swipe up there it is
10237000	10239000	Skype is done alright
10239000	10241000	So that's gonna do it for the Skype line tonight
10241000	10243000	Thanks for those that called in I'm very sorry
10243000	10245000	If you didn't get through especially if it was because of all the
10245000	10247000	Technical failures we were having early on
10247000	10249000	But you live you learn that'll be
10249000	10251000	The theme of 700 more episodes
10251000	10253000	Hopefully of Orange Lounge
10253000	10255000	Radio I don't think we had
10255000	10257000	Any other last minute stories right Loki?
10257000	10259000	So I think it's about time for us to wrap up hey
10259000	10261000	I wanna thank you guys for listening
10261000	10263000	To Orange Lounge Radio over these years
10263000	10265000	Thank you again so much for
10265000	10267000	Everything over these last 700 episodes
10267000	10269000	And we're gonna keep going right on going with
10269000	10271000	Episode 701 next week
10271000	10273000	Cause who needs a life?
10273000	10275000	And Dark Sakura is missing
10275000	10277000	People smacking each other with leather
10277000	10279000	To be here next
10279000	10281000	Week so y'all better respect that so

10295000	10297000	To be participating with the show
10297000	10299000	A nice five star review on a place like iTunes
10299000	10301000	Or Google Play or wherever you found this show
10301000	10303000	Those all go a long long way
10303000	10305000	As well
10305000	10307000	I wanna say this that if you want to honor
10307000	10309000	Our episode 700
10309000	10311000	Then everyone take at least
10311000	10313000	Seven dollars
10313000	10315000	And donate it to your local LGBTQ
10315000	10317000	Center
10317000	10319000	Do that for us
10319000	10321000	Hey I like that idea
10321000	10323000	Or buy me booze
10323000	10325000	No I'm just kidding
10325000	10327000	Dark Sakura's got a way better suggestion
10327000	10329000	I'm just gonna give you booze
10329000	10331000	Dungeon Buster in chat says thank you for spending your gaming
10331000	10333000	Passion and time with us
10333000	10335000	Thank you, you're welcome
10335000	10337000	Alright let's go right into everybody's final
10337000	10339000	Thoughts for tonight and then we'll bring it back
10339000	10341000	With episode 701 next week
10341000	10343000	I guess I'll go first and my final thought is
10343000	10345000	I really need to hang these lights up already
10345000	10347000	The Dark Sakura bought me like two months ago
10347000	10349000	But I'm really lazy y'all
10349000	10351000	I need a complete
10351000	10353000	Actually this whole studio needs to be redecorated
10353000	10355000	Because seriously we got posters up
10355000	10357000	You never did put up the thing that the poster I gave you either
10357000	10359000	The scroll
10359000	10361000	The Mega Man scroll
10361000	10363000	Oh yeah I haven't hung anything new up in here
10363000	10365000	I've still got a poster for Final Fantasy 11
10365000	10367000	Online
10367000	10369000	What is that? That's a poster for Pop and Music 11
10369000	10371000	On the Playstation 2
10371000	10373000	But it's autographed
10373000	10375000	No it just looks like it is
10375000	10377000	I think it's autographed
10377000	10379000	The Borderlands one is autographed
10379000	10381000	This is Cody got us this Borderlands one
10381000	10383000	He met all that team locally
10383000	10385000	Anyway let's get around
10385000	10387000	And get final thoughts from everybody else
10387000	10389000	That was mine so Loki your final thought
10389000	10391000	I guess I'm building
10391000	10393000	Or playing the Lego thing tonight
10393000	10395000	Yay Lego thing tonight
10395000	10397000	And lastly
