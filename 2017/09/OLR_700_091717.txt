Orange Lounge Radio
Hello my friends out there on the internet
Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice
It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 700
That is 700 of our program for this September the 17th of 2017
My name is Rob Roberts here with my co-hosts in Studio N7
Based out of Sacramento, California here to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle
Hello hello, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers
Poop
How are you?
Poop
Woop? Woot?
That's all you have to say after 700 episodes?
I said poop
Oh poop?
Well I guess talking poop emojis are the rage this week so why not?
Oh my god
Nah I'm doing okay
I'm just looking at wish.com and this site is such a train wreck
What is that?
It's like where you can buy stuff for cheap and you really never know what you're gonna get
That sounds awful
First off I don't want to give them free advertising but that's
So wait you just
Am I hearing this right?
You give somebody money and you're saying give me a treat and you don't know what treat you're gonna get
No no no you pick you can pick the item
Oh okay
But it's like I've gotten like stuff for like very very drag things and cosplay stuff from here so
I was gonna say I could just imagine where it's like you know I give money and it's like I like Metroid and then they gift me
Oh you get a copy of Metroid Federation Force
No
No
That's not what I meant
That's not how it works
Okay good good
Also joining us of course as he does every week say hello to tech master Loki
Hello
Hi Loki how are you?
Fine
Yeah you went to a little show with the kid yesterday right?
Yeah
One of the kids
Went to this like it's like Disney on Ice for people that like superheroes I guess
But without the ice and so it's it's like a
Disney on pavement
Sort of
It's Marvel Universe Live so I tried to take my son to it a while ago when he was much younger and he was afraid so we took him again
And he sat through it and complained but he enjoyed it he says
I don't know
He may or may not have been being truthful
He's a little too old for like he's kind of like you know he knows that they're just people in costumes he's not really like you know
It's like okay I know
So he was too young before and now he's too old this time like it's really
Well he's very sensitive because like they have explosions and fireworks and stuff
Like you know stage effects you know little fire things and stuff
This year because I we didn't really watch last the last time it came through but
From what I saw online and what like the few five minutes that we were there
It was a lot more like elaborate stunts going on versus this year is very tame
Would it have been more exciting if it was on ice
No
It would have been weird
All right
And hello to all of you in our chat room because we do tape live every Sunday night at the voice geeks network vog network dot com six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show six ish Pacific
I think we're getting a start at 615 tonight because Bobby ran a little long but we don't mind because he always has us on at the end of his show so sometimes that's why it goes a little long
But you guys can chat along with us of course in our chat room at live dot vog network dot com
Where Mega Man X 400 starts us off tonight saying
Grats you old bitches
I can think of no better comment to start off tonight's show
Thank you very much and there's been a lot of kind words on Twitter and places like that
People saying congratulations on 700 episodes
I wish I could say we have a special great grand thing for you tonight but after 100 200 300 for it look I don't want to sound like that guy but I guess I am a little bit it's kind of like you get to a point where you're like
You know maybe we should just keep doing what works best and what keeps people coming to the show every week so we'll just kind of do our do our normal show
Or we procrastinate too long to plan a thing so fuck it
Yeah that too we got a little old we're a little slower to move now that we're older that's that's just the way it goes sometimes
But I really do truly want to thank you know those of you guys that do take the time out to listen to this show
Sometimes I see the tweets and emails and chat comments and stuff from people that say this has been a part of my Sunday night for 10 years 15 years you know even five years whatever
And I'm always really humbled that you know people have kind of made this a part of their Sunday nights as we have and I just really can't thank you guys enough
And some of you guys maybe have just recently discovered the show in the past few weeks and I think that's awesome too that you know people are still discovering this and deciding to try it out for a little while
So just you know big thanks all around I do want to of course give a couple other thank yous that are that are so important
I'm always afraid I'm going to miss people when I do these types of things but I know there's a few people that this show just would not be here without
I think I have to give a big big big big thank you and props to Jason or VX JasonXV not only does he do that intro that you hear every week without fail or without me like begging and pleading he just does it because he wants to and all that
But I mean a lot of the technical stuff like having a website to handle the traffic that will that large mp3 files generate like Jason's always taking care of us in that regard
So I again cannot really I cannot undersell the amount of the amount of stuff that Jason has done for Orange Launch Radio that the show just like would not be here if it wasn't for him so thank you so much for Jason
And of course I would have to give big big thank yous to Mr. Bobby Blackwolf he likes to call himself the opening act to Orange Launch Radio as he has been for many years
We like to think of it more as like a dual headliner act sort of thing but big thank you of course to Bobby just has been you know a partner in things like the Voice of Geeks Network and so forth and just very very like minded as to us as to why we're podcasting in the first place and what this whole thing is about so you know I can't really thank him enough
And of course my pal Travis who started under Station Live which in some ways this show is a spin off of in some ways so you know I can never say enough thanks to Travis for really really introducing me to the concept that any idiot can do this
Thank you Travis for being that idiot and exposing this to me and I say that with big hearts and thank yous
And yes as Tigerclaw points out in chat Travis is starting a brand new show yes I have heard the rumors I've heard the discussion on that I don't really know anything that you guys don't so I'm excited to hear that Travis is considering coming back to the radio
He's apparently considering coming back to Dragon Con so there's a lot I'm very excited about but I will let Travis talk about that when Travis is ready it's not really my place to
So there you go that's oh and I should of course I think one more person I have to say thank you that we don't thank enough is I have to say thank you to Midihead who does the intro to this show that you've heard for god a good 500 episodes now at least
Like that little opening riff that you've heard has been a part of this show for a long time
We don't have anybody else to remake it
Well I mean but there's
We had somebody and that fell through
It goes a long way to say that like we kind of don't need anybody the only reason we would do it is because then we sit here and realize sometimes you want to repaint the house
I'd take a new intro from Zircon
Well whoever whoever would be willing to do it we'll look at that but rest assured this Midihead intro we've had has worked for 500 episodes and that's great and you know he didn't charge us for it or anything he just did it because he knew that we were big supporters of music based games
Music based games and that he was a part of those at the time if you recognize that name he did some remixes that were in DDRXBox and I think he had a song in Beatmania
One of those crossed over to Beatmania 2DX at one point I think my memory is getting a little fuzzy at this point but I think one of his Sana remixes ended up in Beatmania 2DX at one point so there you go
Alright so as promised last week Dark Sakura got us a cake so what kind of oh she's taking a picture because that's what you do to food these days is you take pictures of it so I will try to describe it to you guys because she's actually got candles
700 candles
700 candles on this cake I kept telling Dark Sakura it's not our birthday
We got a butt cake
It is a butt cake
It's a bunt cake
Actually you need to talk about the cake while I take a picture and put it on the OLR twitter
And take one before and after the lights are lit
So anyway there is a place in Sacramento that I think they're actually all over the place but it's called Everything Bunt Cakes and I like them because they are a good company
They support many good charities and are fairly well they don't care who you like to shtup when it comes to making a cake I'll put it that way
Oh yes I forgot we have cake politics in this country but yes I mean it's important
So let the candle so we can take pictures of that too
Okay I will hold on
So it can be on fire
Well I have to post this on twitter it's very important you have to describe the cake
It is a chocolate bunt cake
Yes
8 inches
Yes
And
And it looks like an asshole
Like that's the other thing that's the other thing you're neglecting to say it looks like an asshole
It's a butt cake
It is a butt cake
It's a chocolate circle
It's a chocolate butt cake with white frosting on it
It's got frosting on the inside and then streams of like frosting tentacles coming out
Frosting tentacles
From the sphincter of the butt cake
It looks delicious and kind of gross at the same time
But I figured it's an occasion and occasions are always the best reason to have cake
Especially delicious semi pricey cake
So
I'm lighting candles there is fire in the OLR studio
Rob's extending fire from his grasped hands
These candles are hard to open
Fire is not very effective on those candles
Oh Rob
Okay can we try not to burn down the house though
Alright everybody get your pictures in
Hold on I gotta go and take
Yeah your turn
Seven almost looks like a one it might be confusing to some people
Okay who's blowing it out
This is the worst radio us trying to blow out a cake
Okay here we go
Make a wish
You can listen to us all blow
Make a wish here we go
One
Two
Five
I blew from over here I'm sure I was doing something
Yay
So see as we promised last episode there is indeed cake
Yes and it's all for us
Alright we'll try to get those pictures posted on the twitter shortly
But first it is a video game podcast believe it or not
So we should get into some gaming topics
There was a lot of Nintendo news this week
Loki did you take a minute to watch the Nintendo direct that happened this week
Yeah I did it was alright
I mean they talked a lot about different things coming out
There wasn't really a whole lot of surprising stuff except for I think you know the whole minecraft thing coming to 3DS
Say hey by the way minecraft is coming to 3DS and it's out now
Go check it out I mean so that was pretty big
That little it's out now surprise was cute
I mean that's pretty major and at least digitally they're going to release a physical version not too far away from now
Then they just a lot of announcements of different things in the pipeline
So for example they talked about Skyrim and how they have it dated now when it's going to be coming out
And then of course they were saying that along with that they're also announcing that Doom is going to get a port to the Switch as well
And even Wolfenstein 2 the new colossus will be coming so lots of stuff which is pretty cool
Yeah that's what Bob Coffee in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says the big story is Doom on Switch
And Dungeon Buster says Wolf 2 coming to the Switch was surprising
And I would agree I thought those were kind of the biggest headlines from the whole event for me
Is that how Bethesda is really you know supporting the Switch in a big way
When we haven't had Skyrim go on sale yet
And I don't know about you guys but I'm not expecting Skyrim to perform super well
But maybe maybe I'm underestimating the power of people that only buy Nintendo consoles
You know maybe or the fact that sure enough they did put in a little homage to Zelda in it
You know with the amiibo
Did you notice the fine print I might add
Uh oh
So there is fine print here just in case if you think that you need to purchase certain things
You know the amiibo stuff that they have for Zelda
Oh they're elsewhere in the game right
Yes
They said that in the direct they did say that in the direct
They said it was they would be in dungeons
So you don't necessarily feel that you have to go purchase those amiibos
You can still unlock the stuff so I think that's nice that they're doing that
Instead of locking stuff behind a paywall type thing
Um I'm curious to see though how it's gonna run and what it's gonna look like
Cause I feel that with like especially Wolfenstein and stuff
I'm wondering what kind of a downgrade we're gonna get on those
Well some of the folks were looking at Doom and comparing it to Playstation 4
And saying you don't really notice it
So that's especially considering you can pick it up and go on portable that's pretty exciting
Yeah so that'd be cool
Lots of lots of 3DS stuff as well
I mean even still we can talk about the Switch as well
So just kind of some of the stuff
Lots of remakes I've been noticing
And you know kind of one of the things I was worried about even with the Switch was that
Oh shit there's gonna be a lot of stuff that they're just gonna kind of remaster
But even that's kind of going along with um
Even with the 3DS and stuff
So you got like Mario and Luigi Superstar Saga being remade that's coming out October 6
Um you know they're talking a little bit about you know
They have uh what is it?
Kirby Battle Royale now is a new thing that's gonna be coming to the 3DS
Yep so 3DS is still going
A new orange 2DS XL
Um there's of course Mario Party they're doing a top 100 best minigames
And that's coming out on 3DS which
I was like why isn't that on the Switch?
Like that should be a Switch game I would think
Well that's what a lot of people are saying about the new Metroid game
Which I'll you know I'll talk about the new Metroid game a little later
Cause you bet your ass I played that this week
And um you know I'll get into it during our gaming weeks
But I know there's been some people I've seen on Twitter that have said
I'm not buying this on the 3DS cause I'm waiting for the Switch version
And I don't know if there's gonna be a Switch version I gotta say
Like I
They're gonna at some point gonna get desperate for content
And you're gonna see a lot of ports of stuff
I mean cause we've already seen that for the Wii U
I don't know I just and I
Look I was as much as anybody else saying
Nintendo needs to just bury the 3DS
And fully invest in Switch at this point
But Nintendo clearly does not want to do that
For whatever the reasons
Just indecisive
Yeah well I don't know if it's just indecisive
As much as they're like well we still have all these 3DSs that are everywhere
So we can make software that can still sell to all these
You know millions of people that have them
While we still face the hardware challenges with the Switch
And something else to just think about
You know that may be coming into play
Is that we do have to remember that
Nintendo exists in more countries than just
You know the US and Canada
You know and even Japan
Except Brazil cause that's where the Sega Master System is still alive
Well okay but you say that tongue in cheek
But in reality
Maybe there's something about the fact that the 3DS
With as old as that system is
Is much easier to get in other countries
That aren't usually the ones that get the first wave of games
No one's saying that they don't have to develop for the 3DS
I'm just saying why wouldn't they develop for both systems
I would think that that would be a title that would
You know do well on the Switch
I mean
It probably would but I will say this
The Metroid you know not to spoil my gaming too bad
But I'm going to
The Metroid game on 3DS has the best 3D on the system
Period
That I've seen
So it's weird because I thought at one point
Nintendo was moving away from 3D
With these 2DS's and the fact that it was barely in Pokemon Sun and Moon
3D for the Minecraft works pretty well too
Yeah but the 3D in this new Metroid game
Is pretty fucking mind blowing
Like it's really good
And it's what makes it work
It's the right amount of 3D
It's a 2D game
But it does 3D effects when it needs to
That work really well
So there is that
So and if you put that on the Switch
You're not going to have the same 3D effects
Of course you can play this Metroid game in 2D mode
And probably still get as much out of it
That's not going to you know like if you're like
I don't like 3D or I can't see 3D
I still think you'll get a lot of the Metroid game
But I mean for those that do enjoy the 3D
Like this game does it very well
The other thing was for the Switch
Of course they talked a little bit about Xenoblade Chronicles 2
Which will be coming out in December
Snipperclips is getting a new release
And they're getting new DLC
So it's kind of like a game of the year edition
A remaster
Not a remaster but it's like kind of like you know
The bundle with the DLC thing that's going to be coming out
So that's something Project Octopath Traveler
Which looks pretty cool
It's kind of how I think they should do all the 2D RPGs honestly
That was another one of those today surprises with the demo
I didn't get to play the demo yet
I'm hearing really positive things about it
I just haven't gotten around to it myself yet sadly
Of course they announced along with the new trailer for Super Mario Odyssey
That they have a Super Mario Odyssey Switch bundle
That's going to be coming to Red Joy-Cons
At the end of October
And then they showed off some new worlds for Mario Odyssey
Which looks alright
Dragon Quest Builders was something that's going to be coming to the Switch in the spring
So lots of stuff kind of announced
A lot of it thankfully was for this year
But I don't know
I was hoping for some more new announcements
I know they're going to end with Mario
Well you got to be careful with these directs
Don't ever set your expectations too high
Because you're only going to leave disappointed
I'm sure there were a lot of us that were thinking
Oh this is what they're going to do
I did, I will say this
I was expecting they were going to announce a Bayonetta remaster
To go with the rumors we were hearing about last week
With the Playstation 4 and Xbox One and all that
That didn't happen
And that was a little disappointing
But then I have to go
Rob don't set your expectations
Because they're never going to be met
That's just the way Nintendo works
I think a lot of people
Way too many people were hedging bets on
Smash 4 being announced
Smash for Switch being announced
Now was not the time to do that
Maybe Tokyo Game Show
Although Nintendo doesn't participate in Tokyo Game Show
That doesn't mean they won't participate in the news cycle
That comes that same week
But we'll see
Nintendo announced a system in January
Which was not what people usually do
So Nintendo clearly marches to the beat of their own drummer
Who may or may not have rhythm
And it works for them
So bless their hearts
But you forgot the biggest thing that came out of the Direct Logie
You forgot the biggest thing that set Twitter ablaze
Mario's titties
That was the thing that everybody is talking about on Twitter
Which even, I got to admit
Even I'm looking at this going
What's the big deal?
What is the big deal
About Mario's titties?
That's the thing, the big deal is
It wasn't necessarily this
That was a big deal
Other characters
I think it was from Fire Emblem
Or something else that had some sort of swimsuit
Costume thing
They had basically
Censored the nipples out of it
Like male nipples
In the US
For some reason
I don't know why
I really don't care
But it's like, why
Why did you do that?
It's such a weird thing
People don't like seeing nipples
But Mario, they're just like
Flipping out
Jamie, did you get a look at Mario's titties?
For five seconds I was like, okay
Who cares?
Apparently people with no life
Apparently the entire internet
I just
I was just surprised that Mario shaves his chest
That was the thing that struck me
As most like, wow, he manscapes
Apparently
Is something that he does, so there you go
Well it would have been very awkward if it was just like
Fucking Ron Jeremy type shit
Well somebody
There was some tweet floating around where somebody actually
Photoshopped all the chest hair into it
Of course there is
I was like, that looks a little more realistic
But whatever
To register participation for this week's episode of
Orange Challenge Radio at vognetwork.com
Use the passphrase, bucket
Going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com
MegaManX400 says
Mark my words
Smash 4 is coming
They're waiting to announce their online first
And Act F says at this point we'll probably see Smash 5
Oh, thank you for reminding me
That was the other thing that was sorely missing
From this
Where the fuck is the Virtual Console?
Where the fuck is whatever else we're calling it?
Where the fuck is the online?
No mention of that whatsoever
I think expecting that to come out
In 2017, you might as well forget it
I do think at this point
We will hear about it in January of 2018
I think
Virtual Console is not something
We're going to hear about this year
Get over it or don't
I mean they had other things they announced
Regarding that stuff, so they have like
The arcade stuff
That's sort of like Virtual Console
But it's not Virtual Console
It's just arcade versions
I'm with you on that
That shit's a little weird
The arcade archive things
I mean, don't get me wrong
I love the original Mario Brothers
I think it's really underrated
As an arcade classic
Because it's something that's really, really fun
Two player mode
And remember that game is really old
The original Mario Brothers is a very, very old game
You know, the animals that come out of the pipes
And that was a lot of fun
With two people, because that was one of the first games
That I really remember from the back of the day
Where you could really screw your friends
Like playing that game, right?
They could be running to get a crab
And you knock the floor to make the crab awake again
And kill your friend
I remember that game is great
And I think a really good addition
As much as we've seen that game
A lot from Nintendo over the years
Because every time they did a
Super Mario Brothers Advance
Or whatever that series
That game was included one way or another
But I think it's a good thing to kind of have on the Switch
However, where things kind of
Start to get weird with that
Was when they start talking about the whole
Yeah, like Super Mario Brothers versus
Which, okay, for those that don't know
When they had that Pay Choice 10
Which was like the Nintendo in the arcade
With games already loaded onto it
A lot of times
You would have
Versus Super Mario Brothers
Or Versus Excitebike
I think was one of the other ones
And basically what it was, it was the same game
But it was harder
And I think with Versus Super Mario Brothers
I think, I want to say
It's more like the second quest
Of Mario Brothers
Where the turtles are all the beetle guys instead
And I feel like there's
Some things that are removed
To make some of the jumps harder
There's just very subtle changes in the game
On levels 2, I think might have been a thing
Somebody in chat might know the difference
Yeah, it is pretty minor
All things considered
So it is weird that that is coming
When we still don't know about the virtual console
Plans for just regular Super Mario Brothers
But then there was a lot of other games in that montage
They talked about Versus Pinball
Versus Clu Clu Land
I'm sorry, but that's really
Offloading the dump truck
Is that them trying to double dip
On that shit, so it's basically
They're trying to release this shit now
It's not exactly the NES stuff
But you may just buy it because you're tired of waiting
And then they announce this new paid service
And then you're like, okay we'll do that too
And they get you twice
Yes and no
The double dipping thing wouldn't surprise me at all
But if it's true
That you're going to be paying
For this Nintendo online
And with it you will get certain games
Like free or whatever
I would imagine that Super Mario Brothers
Will be one of those games
And so you're not going to have to double dip so to speak
Because one of them you'll pay for with this arcade archives
The other one will be included
With your soul
With Nintendo's online thing
So that's my thought
But I don't know
Yeah, I mean
I'll probably buy Mario Brothers
It depends on the price
If they want way too much money for it then I won't
But I'll probably buy the Mario Brothers
And the Versus Super Mario Brothers
Stuff like Versus Clu Clu Land
That shit's a stretch
Was it Versus Pinball?
Nintendo Pinball
There was better
There was better Pinball on the NES
Than Nintendo Pinball
Nintendo Pinball was an early title
But it was before Pinbot
And Roller Ball
What were the other big Pinball games on Nintendo?
There's another one I'm trying to think of
Pinball Quest
That game wasn't actually good
It was just a good idea
They just need to seriously at this point
Just mark that shit
I mean they've made their money back
A ton like
Many dozens
Hundreds of times over already
Just drop that shit
Down to where it's like impulsive
Bundling by that's just like
Oh shit you know that's like 99 cents
You'd sell like a ton of that shit
Even stuff that's like garbage
Like NES Pinball
Paying 5 fucking dollars for that shit
I bought Balloon Fight for 30 cents on Wii U
Exactly that's a price
That would be worth it
I would buy it and you know it may not be
Something I'm interested in but I'd buy it because
It ain't 30 cents
I still have Animal Crossing for GameCube
Exactly that is the fucking Nintendo
I liked where it's like hey
Enjoy our classic games
Hey guess what you purchase that game
The Game Boy Advance version of this Metroid game
You can link it up or you know
Game Boy Advance some version of
You know Metroid or something
You can hook up your
Game Boy Advance and you can
Play the original Metroid on or something
That is how you do it
You've made your money back on those
Stop trying to pretend they're still worth
5 dollars
They're fucking old I get it
People still like them
But you cannot say that
This game is still worth 5 fucking dollars
Again
Like after I bought it dozens of times
Alright one other thing
I want to say about the Nintendo Direct
That I think will be worth 60 dollars
Xenoblade Chronicles 2
I just want to make sure I get that out there
I really enjoyed what I saw from that game
And I look forward to playing it on the Switch
That is true
But their presentation was
Fucking boring
That was the most boring fucking
Presentation
I got what I needed out of it
I was fine I don't always need somebody
That's like super hyped up
It's just like the explaining like
Just the gameplay
Explaining it
How would you have explained it Loki?
Show me a fucking trailer done
Not just sit there explaining
Here's some fucking fire and there's robots and bang
Just show an extended trailer
Instead of fucking explaining about
This system you do this and this system
This happens and you have these classes
And blah blah blah
That's fucking boring
Next month before the holiday but I guess
What would be the point?
There's nothing really left to explain
They've detailed all their holiday releases
I would have liked little treats here
Mario Odyssey amiibo announcements which they did by the way
Announced more amiibos for that shit
Big surprise
I think they're gonna wait till January to just talk about next year at this point
I think that's probably
Probably it
Alright
Anyway
That's pretty much all we're gonna say about Nintendo Direct
What are your gaming weeks?
The types of video games we have been playing this week
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
What have you been playing this week?
I downloaded Ragnarok
Online for Steam
I started playing Ragnarok Online again
Did it go free to play?
Wow
Talk about blast from the past
Is anyone moderating the game?
I'm sure there's mods
They changed the whole
Introductory level
It kinda is crappy
I might go back and find another free server
That does the old style RO
I don't know
But that whole thing started
Because thanks to Tiara
I downloaded this game called
Idle Pouring on my iPhone
Which is basically
You're just running the whole time
Killing things
Then you level while it's idle
And then you can do the daily quests and PvP
It's a fucking clicker game?
That's the first one that finally drew me in
Good job
Rama in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says
Wasn't Ragnarok Online free to play
For years on Steam?
News to me
I didn't even care to look before this
I haven't exactly followed Ragnarok Online
I played RO2 on Steam before I played it
I still have that picture of
Both of our characters
And you with your little mage with the ribbon in his hair
That was great
MXC wants to know the name of this again
Idle Pouring
P O R I N G
Ideally?
Not like American Idol
It's pretty fun
I've been enjoying it
Can we not?
It is
And can we not?
I also got Hive Swap
Which is the homestuck game
That we've been fucking waiting for
It was really good
It was pretty short but it's just the first episode
And it's all point and click goodness with cutscenes
And it has everything
A point and click game fan
Would want plus homestuck
And
I spent the whole first part
Analyzing every scene
You can look at the pictures
In everyone's houses slash their hives
Because trolls live in hives
And you can
There's certain
There's certain
Places that indicate where this fits in continuity
And although I did then go back and like completely reread almost the entire homestuck wiki
Just to make sure that I had my head straight as to what universe this was
Because there are many universes
So
It was really good
I'm gonna play it again
Alright
And of course Pokemon Go
Miitomo
The usual
Blah
Alright then Loki
How was your gaming week?
I didn't play a whole ton of stuff
I finished the Lego movie video game
On PC
Because
I don't know
I like that movie
The game's alright
And then now I'm just kind of doing the 100% stuff
It's just kind of
I don't know it's a mindless game
Just some mobile clicker stuff
I'm kind of getting out of it
But I did play that this week
It's still the office space one
I don't know, that's it
I didn't really play any console stuff, thought about it
Just haven't gotten around to it
I need to play VR
I purchased a while back
I think she's a while back now
Superhot VR and I do want to try that
Oh I saw that game
I didn't really play it myself
But I saw it at Dragon Con because Bobby brought it
And one of his buddies was playing it
It looked neat, I like the whole concept of
Things only move when you're actually moving
I thought that was kind of neat
This is what it would be like to be in the matrix
What's great about those
After you do play that
Because you can play it very slowly
You can play it back at full speed when you're done
Like an instant replay
So it's like fucking John Woo shit
You're tossing the guns up in the air
That's rad, I like that
What's great though is I've seen some play throughs online
And there's different scenes
That kind of teleport you to different areas
So if you've played it enough and you know where those are
You can throw your guns to yourself
In the next area, which is great
So you'll throw an Uzi into the air
And you hop to the next scene
And catch it and then just shoot the guy in the face
It's just awesome
All the different options there
So yeah, I'm gonna
Probably have to check that out
Once again, I'm getting them in the Lego
Stuff they like watching Ninjago
Which I thought when I first saw that
It looked stupid, but the Ninjago movie
Is coming out and with that they have a game
So maybe I'll pick that up
If they have the Lego Marvel 2 then I'll be
Picking up later
I don't know, it's been Lego
Obsessive in my household
Lately, mainly which is me
Alright, my gaming week
After last week's show I played
Some Mighty No. 9 live on stream
So I got out a lot of my thoughts
During the stream
I liked it more than I thought I would
I think in the Mega Man
Wars
Or whatever you want to call it on Steam right now
I think I preferred 20XDX overall
But I did really like
Mighty No. 9 enough
It was hard
The first time I played through I was getting killed a lot
And I was getting really frustrated
Because I had to go all the way back
But then when I really was thinking about it
I was like this was part of what the original
Mega Man games were all about
You have to memorize patterns
And even the people that were watching were noticing
The second time I went through this level
I did way better and I beat it
Because this time I knew exactly what to expect
And it was completely different that time
I don't know
The game lacks a certain polish
I think in a way
It was fine enough
I can understand where
Fans get a little frustrated
The internet in general kind of shits on that game
A little more than it deserves
I suppose the whole Kickstarter element puts it in a unique category
But it's well enough
And that game you can catch it on sale
Here and there and everywhere
So if you find it
At a price that you're willing to pay for it
Then go for it!
Other games that I played this week
I played
With my new 3DS
I finally
Was convinced to buy a new 3DS
And you know what convinced me to finally buy a new 3DS?
All they had to do
Was to put Samus on it
That's exactly what they did
And as soon as they put Samus on it
I bought it
So I bought that new 3DS with Samus
So I had to do a transfer
And I learned some things doing a transfer
So I had the Link Between Worlds
DS before
So I had a 32GB
SD memory card in that thing
But unfortunately it's not as easy
As putting your 32GB
SD card into your
New 3DS
Why? Because the new 3DS
Takes micro
SD cards
So I had to buy a 32GB micro
SD card
Those are like 10 bucks now you can get those dirt cheap
I got one on Amazon Now
Because I was like I don't want to leave the house
It's Friday, Amazon Now fucking delivered one here in two hours
Like that
That's the pinnacle of laziness
I was like
I'm not putting pants on god dammit
That's pretty sweet
So anyway
So there was that
So finally that gets delivered
I'm like okay well I'll do this transfer
Now yes before I get the emails and the chat comments
I'm aware you can do a PC transfer
You can do a PC based transfer
And in retrospect that is exactly what I should have done
I should have also ordered an SD
Card reader via USB
Because my computer doesn't have one anymore
My new one doesn't
I should have ordered one of those damn card readers
And did it that way
Because I did it DS to DS
The transfer, it took
I started it at 7 PM
Do you know when the transfer finished finally?
4 AM
Is when the transfer finished
Now in retrospect I would have
Purged, well for one
I know that 32GB card was not full
Like it's probably not even a quarter full
Do I have a lot of shit on my 3DS?
Yes, but you can fit a lot in 32GB
Of DS software
In retrospect
I would have deleted
Every single demo off of my old
3DS before I started the transfer
Now see since space was never a concern
I never really deleted the demos
They were just kind of sitting there
But I should have got rid of them
The DS thing warned me that it would take 4 hours
To do the transfer, it took 9
Okay so it finally finished at 4 AM
So
I was a little frustrated by that
But finally, whatever, it was done
Over
And then finally I got to sit down and play
Metroid Samus Returns
On my new Samus 3DS
And it's great
I'm so happy Nintendo
Just in time for Loki's birthday
And to celebrate episode 700 of our program
Decided to release a new Metroid game
The way Metroid ought to be
2D
But with 3D flair in it
And as I mentioned earlier
The 3D in this game works very well
It's not a 3D Metroid
It's a 2D Metroid
But the 3D elements work very well
I realized they outsource the development of this game
To a company in Spain
And I don't remember the name of it right now
Do you remember the name?
Somebody in chat will yell it out here in a minute
But they did a good job
My understanding is that they had some Castlevania titles
Previously that were kind of it
Which goes to show you
I mean we saw this with Retro Studios
Even before
I don't know if they were
I would assume that they were independent from Nintendo
Before they kind of brought on as a second party
But
Other companies can develop your properties
For you and do a great job on it
Thank you Act F, Mercury Steam
That's the name of it
Can we get the people that did Blaster Master Zero
To do a new Metroid game?
Hello? That would be fucking awesome
I would trust those guys
Yeah well that's who I want
That's at the top of my wish list for a new Guardian Legend game
Actually it would be those guys, Inti Creates
I think this is the name of them
They're at the top of my list for a Guardian Legend
Reimagining right now
They don't need to do Metroid because Mercury
This Mercury Steam just did a fucking
Phenomenal job with it so
They get to make all the Metroids now
As far as I'm concerned
And I think with the critical reception this game is getting
I think it's very likely
These guys are going to get to make more games
And maybe those that were hoping this
Would be on the Switch
Maybe you'll get your wish of a
Metroid game by these guys on the Switch
If you didn't know this game
Metroid Samus Returns, it's a reimagining
Of Metroid Part 2
Or what do they call it, Metroid 2 Return of Samus
Was the Game Boy name
It takes some of the plot elements
Like the fact that there are 40 Metroids
On the planet you have to kill
As you kill more Metroids
More parts of the planet become accessible
They've kind of done their own thing with it
Because for one
That tiny little Game Boy screen
Is now a widescreen
And so that means, you know, right off the bat
More stuff is viewable
So that kind of changes a lot of things right there
Excuse me, and they've done things like
You can aim the gun up and down
Kind of like in Super Metroid
You can aim the gun up and down
But it's free, because the circle pad
As you hold L, it's free range
But it actually works really well because
When you're about to connect with an enemy
The yellow beam turns red
So you know when you're lined up correctly
And then they have this whole melee thing
Where when an enemy is about to attack you
You can hit the X button
And you do like a Falcon Punch type of thing
And you kind of knock it
Yeah, you do like a counter and it knocks the enemy on its ass
And then your gun immediately targets it
You don't have to sit there and retarget it
Your gun immediately targets it
So you can start blasting it
Which is a pretty cool effect when it's done
I'm not sure how I feel about it
It is very, it does kind of disrupt
The usual Metroid flow that I know
But I'm getting used to it
It's growing on me the more I play the game
It was just a little weird to use it in some of those
Early Metroid encounters
But yeah, I mean
Honestly, that's a very small kind of hesitation
And what otherwise I think is a pretty
It's a pretty fantastic Metroid game
Like anybody that was worried
After Other M and all this stuff
Like, you don't need to worry
This is a worthy successor to
Metroid Zero Mission
Which would have really been, I guess, the last 2D Metroid game
If you don't count Other M
Because Other M was kind of 3D
Kind of not
So if you just kind of throw that one away
This is really the next 2D game that they've had
And it's great, I recommend it
If you're a Metroid fan and you have a 3DS
You need to check it out
There you go
Some comments in our chat over at
live.vognetwork.com
Metroid is so fucking good
Kaijuto says the new 3DS is flawless
I will point out, look
I was not convinced to upgrade to a new 3DS
For the longest time
But now that I've done it
I do like that head tracking for the 3D an awful lot
Like it really does work very well
And being able to kind of keep the 3D
Whereas like if you have an old 3DS
And you kind of look to the side just a little too much
Like the 3D completely breaks up
It doesn't happen on the new 3DS
So that alone is a pretty neat feature
I've thrown out my perfectly capable old 3DS
Paid $200 for a new one for
Not until they put Samus on it
Let's see
Tigerclaw in chat says
With Metroid Samus Returns
Do you think Nintendo will remake
Super Metroid? I think they should
They can make it better
How do you perfect perfection
Tigerclaw? That's my only concern
Like Metroid 2
Was a decent Metroid game
But I think Metroid 2
Was kind of always limited by its hardware
The old school Game Boy
In retrospect
Was kind of like it wasn't the greatest
Hardware in the world right
It was groundbreaking at the time
Because it was portable games and it was done well
But it wasn't the hardware really limited
What you could do on that thing right
So I can see why
They kind of went back and redid Metroid 2
Does Super Metroid need a remake?
No
I think
I think we can explore a new Metroid
Title and that would be just fine
But they've changed enough
With this that it doesn't feel like a rehash
Of Metroid 2 but then again
I never did get around to playing that AM2R
I would be very curious
What people who played it Oh god it was so good though
Now see I would be very curious
What your take is on
This new Metroid game
The AM2R developers have been very kind
To it and they want to see it do well
Which is good
That they're not being bitter betties
About the cease and desist and all that
I'll have to play it
I mean I've got the game I just haven't played it yet
Cool that'll be good
Let's see going to some other comments in our chat
Over at live.vognetwork.com
Let's see Tigerclaw says you perfect
Perfection by making it look better
Play better and add a ton of new features
Like what they did in Samus Returns
Again
I just don't know if it needs it
I guess if they want to put a fresh
Coat of paint on it
Like if they want to give it the Starcraft
HD thing to it
Where they redo the graphics but they don't
Fucking touch the game
Then I might be on board for it
But again I don't know
I don't know
I would have some hesitation
I would like to see Mercury Steam just be able to do
Their own Metroid game now
Like whatever they want to do with it
They've proven themselves with this game
Let them do whatever they want to do
Obviously Nintendo can still oversee it
And thumbs up or thumbs down whatever they want
But that's what I would do
In that case
Anyway I've talked enough about that game
But obviously as a long time Metroid fan
I've been very excited about that game's release
So we're going to get into some gaming news
But first some quick announcements
Again thanks you guys for tuning in for
700 episodes whether this is your first episode
Or your 700th
Thanks for being a part of our family here Sunday nights
At the Boise Geeks Network
Twitter.com slash O-L-R

No shows off
That I'm aware of in the foreseeable future
Although I'm looking to maybe
Do a trip with the long weekend
Coming up for Veterans Day
But something like
It's going to be something like L.A. or something
It's not going to be something I have to get on a plane for
I might go to L.A. that weekend
Because I have some friends in L.A. I haven't seen in a while
That's kind of what I'm leaning towards right now
Maybe that's what I'll do Veterans Day weekend
So I may not be back in time for the show that Sunday
But that's not until November
So in the meantime though we'll see you every Sunday night
Let's get into some gaming news
Loki
So this is kind of funny
Recently
It had been discovered that
There was a NES
Emulator inside the Switch firmware
Which they were calling
Flog
And along with that though
They found that there's also a ROM in there as well
So golf for the NES
Is in there
Which is kind of weird though
Because they're saying
They're not sure if it's an accident
They're probably not
But they found that the emulator
I guess the emulator version
Works on this Flog emulator
And it even has
Joy-Con controller icons
So it's compatible
With this emulator
There's not really a way to launch the game
Though via a system menu
But it might be something that's in development
Has anybody tried putting up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, start into their Switch
To see if this game pops up
No
Are there Nintendo codes out there?
Maybe that's the trick
Maybe there's a button code you have to push and you get this
Or maybe it's just
In there waiting to be unlocked
At some point when they unleash other
Virtual console type games
And I think the most exciting thing about this
Is the fact that they have
Gone back and they've
Changed the ROM
Essentially in a way to
Account for motion controls
Well here's the other thing too if you think about it
It's pointed out Flog
The name of the emulator is Golf Backwards
No shit Sherlock
So it's just kind of weird though
That I don't know
I don't know what this is
Golf is also one of those games
Where it's in the same bucket as like
Clu Clu Land and Pinball
And some of those things you were talking about earlier
I like Clu Clu Land
It's one of those games where it's like
If Loki gets upset about
Paying five bucks for Super Mario
Brothers he really is gonna
Get upset if Nintendo tries to charge five dollars
For golf which I think they actually did on the Wii U
But I digress
Golf is kind of like if Nintendo's gonna give one away
Golf's a safe one to give away
Well this is kind of weird too like here's some of the
They're talking about the controls so they're saying that
You know the controls are the
D-pad buttons
And the stick however motion
Control while holding the Z
L-R button is also supported
Instead of using the buttons so they're having
Motion control being
Added to NES games
But see you know what's
Exciting about that for me like as
Hokie as that might be although
Don't underestimate the power of that shit
I mean where as a lot of us like
For lack of a better term hardcore gamers
It's the power of love again
Okay look as much as some of us might
Roll our eyes at it I think there are some people
That are gonna think that's really cool
That you can go back to the old school games and you can
Control them a whole new way so don't
Don't underestimate little shit like that
But what is exciting
About that for me Loki
Is that they have gone back
And they have edited old games
To do new things
That's the very exciting part Loki
They have edited emulators to do new things
So is it possible
Big question mark
Is it possible
That these
The next wave of virtual console
Will not only have the online support
But maybe things like achievements
Leaderboards
Things that they've gone back
And they've updated these old ROMs to be able to do
Flog kind of shows
That Nintendo is going that
Direction of more than
Just a fucking straight up emulation
Of an old fucking game
Does that make sense?
We'll see
Yes JD in chat says
What was this about not getting your hopes up Rob
When it comes to Nintendo? You're right
I gotta keep that shit in check but
Still this is
It is a fact that this has been found
And that there is more to it
Than just a straight up emulation
So I don't think I'm getting my hopes too far up
In making that connection
Well if they're doing it for flog
Then maybe they're gonna do it for some other stuff too
Which by the way I should point out also JD
In chat says mmm flogging
Look
Folsom Street Fair if I remember right is next weekend
But I hope you all have a good one
For those that are checking that out
Let's see
Although today was the leather walk
There's
There's events every weekend for something
I need a better calendar
I attended
The election of Mr. Bolt Leather
For the year
And it was a very nice event
Good
Did you get to vote? I played pinball
Was the audience voted? No they had judges
But I played pinball
Alright
Rama in chat says you know there's a Folsom
Street Fair East
Where do they even do that?
Is that a P-Town thing?
Anyway
Oh it's in New York
Thank you I've
Clearly my calendar is not up to date
My invite got lost in the mail I suppose
Alright
Let's move on from flogging to Final Fantasy
And someday maybe those worlds
Will collide but for now
The world
Soon enough
Thanks to Final Fantasy 15 modding
Support
Ooh Gladio Leather Daddy
Ooh
Oh honey
Please this is Square Enix
Please be respectful of the characters
Don't do anything
Don't make the naughty mods
No naughty mods
We trust you
Oh god why do we trust you
Meanwhile have you seen the hairdresser?
I can't
I can't fucking wait for
Mods to be unleashed on Final Fantasy
15 it's like
Dark Sakura
Look years and years and years
Of having it always be the women
Being objectified in these games
And in the modding communities
And the titties hanging out and all this stuff
Years and years of that is finally
Gonna be rectified and caught up with
With Final Fantasy 15
Here I am playing Final Fantasy
Dongs everywhere
I'm fighting a giant dick with a dick
In my hand and I'm shaped like a dick
It comes from
11 with the man harness
You know what I mean
Oh yeah the armor
Yes Final Fantasy 11
And 14 were some of the first games
To be like slut
The men were just as slutty as the women
And what's his face who I hate?
I don't know
You ate everybody
No who had the logo?
Bobby Blackwolf?
No in Final Fantasy 14
I was gonna say was it the 11th?
Hildebrandt
The 11th sublegar
That's it
That's what I was trying to think of the name
Let's see
Rama in chat says Rob Roberts starring
In Leather Dream Daddy
Did you see my cosplay for DragonCon?
Did you just catch that?
I got recognized by two people
JD in chat says
Final Fantasy 15 Conan Exiles
Version, anything's possible
Anyway all that talk aside
Here's the thing
The Legend of Zelda
Breath of the Wild has clearly had
An influence upon the Final Fantasy
Team in a quote from
Director Hajime Tabata the director
Of Final Fantasy 15 he's talking about
Zelda saying quote I've heard a lot
From the dev team and their reactions to having
Played Zelda but just from hearing
The stories and the feedback you know
We can tell that it's a really complete game
It's very polished almost a perfect game
In that regard and our goals
Are probably to take that experience
That players felt with Breath of the Wild
But with our own technology and our own
Know how we have in our disposal
To create a very very high
Quality game with a strong visual
Element to it while creating a world
That's really immersive and really beautiful
That's probably our goals in terms of
What we want to be with our next project
It was kind of interesting hearing about
The influence of you know Zelda
Breath of the Wild and what it kind of you know did for
That series and now we're hearing that other
Developers are getting influenced by it but man
You know I know it's a little early
To talk about Final Fantasy 16
But my assumption is that
Is something that has to happen eventually right
We have to talk about Final Fantasy 16
Eventually right
If not now then maybe the next E3
I mean maybe
Square is still kind of on the hook to like
Actually release the Final Fantasy 7
Remake first before we can really talk about
16 but here's my thing is that
And I think I've talked about this a little bit
Before but if you want to talk about like the open world
Expansiveness Final Fantasy 15
Kind of did that
In parts you know right
We all know that one of the chapters
Can go on forever because you just do
Side quests after side quests
Final Fantasy kind of had that 15 to an extent
Can you imagine
A game in Final Fantasy 15's engine
But
All the characters
All the land
All the story and all the universe
Is like Final Fantasy 9
But in Final Fantasy 15's engine
Like how fucking rad would that be
And the reason why I specifically call out 9
Is because 9 was kind of that call back
To the classic Final Fantasy era right
Like you know 7 and 8
Were kind of the more like
There were modern settings they were different
8 not as much but it was just very different
It didn't look like you know the classic Final Fantasy games
But characters like Vivi and stuff
In Final Fantasy 9 really kind of gave it
That classic Final Fantasy look so imagine
That in Final Fantasy 15's engine
And then it's like open and immersive
And not like
Necessarily as tunnel visioned as the old
Final Fantasy games because if you think about it
The original Final Fantasy like
And a lot of the even later
Final Fantasy's they're very fucking tunnel visioned
Aren't they like you know
You need the canoe to get to the river
And then you need the airship to cross the mountains
Like it is very
It's great it's still a great game but it was
Kind of you know tunnel vision
So I think it would be just awesome to see
Something like that in like a very
Open world you know quest
Type setting like Final Fantasy 15
Maybe that's part of the reason
I like 14 so much
Because even though it's online
It does feel a lot of that
It's a really good start in that direction anyway
Something you want to say with that Logie?
I'd rather just remake 6
I guess
I guess but remakes have to
You know go on the back burner at some point
They're already remaking 7 whether we like it
Or not I don't know is
Dark Sakura before we get to your story
With the Final Fantasy 7 remake
Are you apprehensive
About it or are you looking forward to
Killing Aerith in HD
Over and over again
Oh that bitch is dead
I'm gonna omni slash her
What if they
What would you do if in the remake they
Changed it so that you could bring her back to life
That bitch ain't getting my
You know resurrection
Phoenix down not for you
Phoenix up
No I know it's referring
To the down on the feathers
I know I know
Phoenix up is still funny
That's a good name for a band and rock band
Phoenix up
You don't get Phoenix down
You get Reaper down
Or as Bobby Blackwolf in our chat says
Phoenix up yours Aerith
I just don't like her
You don't say
After 700 episodes of this show
I haven't fucking figured that out
She's a man stealing hoe bag
Dungeon Buster in chat says
Forget Aerith I want a fantasy star classic
Revival with the return of Nae
Actually
How about since we didn't get
Since we didn't get into this with the Nintendo Direct
Now that you've opened that Pandora's box
Dungeon Buster
Here's the thing
Where the fuck is
Fantasy Star Online 2 in the US?
Did you know that during
Japan's Nintendo Direct
This week they got the announcement
The Fantasy Star Online 2 cloud
Or whatever is coming to the Switch
So they get Fantasy Star Online on their TV and on the go
You know what we've got with Fantasy Star Online?
Jack shit
What is Sega's
Fucking problem with this game?
Not wanting to release it in the US
What's your damage Sega?
What did we do to you?
Release
PSO 2
In the US
I should re-download that and re-patch it
It was fun
Before y'all get started on
Yes there's a patch
It would be nice to get some
Fucking official recognition from Sega
That there are PSO fans that want
To play this game here
Yes I understand the Switch
Is region free but that doesn't mean the servers
Are gonna be region free
Is having Sega
Give us a hug
Too much to ask
Apparently it is
Anyway
I'm sorry
I got disrupted by a chat
Comment there that got me wound up on a Loki rant
How about you Dark Soccer do you have something
Positive to share with us in the news
Tonight?
Positively
So we had talked about this a couple of times
In the past but
This is actually coming from
CPN coverage
Which is pretty
Sorry CBS
CBS coverage I was thinking news and then the end
Came out
But they were having some coverage
About more colleges now
Are rolling out scholarships
For varsity video game players
Several schools now
It looks like have their own
Esports team
And I think it was
I'm trying to find it in here because it listed
What school it was
One of the UC's just built an Esports arena
UC Irvine
Did it
And that now
More and more schools are opening up
Their own
Esports teams
Like multiple teams per school
And that actually
It has
It's almost now
Surpassed
Sports like physical sports
Activity in schools and they're offering
More and more scholarships to that
So
And people are like yeah it
Rebuilds a sense of community
And it's especially good for people who maybe
Can't get into the physicality of
You know like football or
Baseball or something like that
So I think it's pretty neat
All those people who made fun of us
For being nerds
Now people are going to college
For being nerds
You kids today
You don't know how easy you have it
You get a full scholarship for college
Because you're good at a video game
Back in my day that got you canned
I would have killed for that
What video game would you have gone
To college on a scholarship for at our sakura
What video game would have gotten you a full
Scholarship
Guardian legend at the time
No I'm serious I was really good at it
It makes me laugh though just imagining
The guardian legend is an esport
But it deserves it
Well I mean the era that I was going into college
Though it was Super Nintendo era
When I was first going into school so
I think that at that point
It would have been like Kirby's
Avalanche
I was really good at Puyo Puyo
Really good at Puyo Puyo
Not as good as I was
Loki what about you
You would have gone to college a full scholarship
On what game?
Well if we were talking college it would have been Mario Kart 64
Maybe
Damn you because you stole my answer
Well you sort of stole my answer
My answer was going to be Super Mario Kart
On the Super Nintendo because in the college dorms
The Playstation and the
N64 had just come out
But college kids couldn't really afford it
So I still had the last gen of games
So the guys used to come over
And we would play Super Mario Kart
And it got brutal
With that game
But I always fucking won
I'm not as good now
As I used to be
I'm sure my recent streams are evidence of that
With the new fangled Mario games
But there's always that
Alright but Mario Kart 64
For you Loki
I guess I don't know
Bobby Blackwolf in chat was in a similar place
I got it in 64
Pretty early and my dorm was the Mario Kart 64 dorm
People came into my room
Just to play four player battle mode
Actually it wasn't me
That got the Nintendo 64 first
It was the guys right upstairs
If we're talking like it's not technically a video game
But the best game
Or the game that I was the best at
At that time would have been
Q's are laser tag
Oh that would have been your scholarship
Right there with Q's are
I've been awesome
Anyway and I don't know if your
I don't know if your college
Was anything like mine Bobby
But those guys upstairs that used to play Mario Kart
They used to get so
Fucking high before they would play Mario Kart
Like it was
That room was just like a giant fucking cloud
And then
Mario Kart 64
Something about the colors I'm sure
Now when I was actually in college though
Totally World Cup Soccer 94 pinball
Which is why I
I own one now
The other game that we played in the dorms all the time
Was since we all had our own phone lines
I know I've told this story on OLR
Since we all had our own phone lines in those little rooms
We used to
And it was still dial up back then
The high speed hadn't hit the dorms yet
So we were still doing dial up
So we would dial into the college internet
And we would play Duke Nukem 3D
Over the phones
That was my first LAN game
On Friday nights we would leave our doors open
And we would be playing Duke Nukem 3D
Over the phone basically
It was good times
Did you ever do the voice macros?
Where you could hit it and go
I came here to kick ass and chew bubble gum
And I'm all out of gum
My face was your face, your ass
What's the difference?
I remember all that stuff
Good times
Anyhow
So let's move on, Loki what do you have for us?
Maybe another game that kids can go to college on
Yes it's the new game
Well it's not so much the game of the week anymore
But it's a popular game
Or one of the popular games
Player Unknown's Battlegrounds is now the most
Played game on steam
Of all time
That's right it's hit the record
Of um
1.349
Million players
That's it's peak
Previous record which of course
And Dota 2
That was March of last year
They were 1.291
So not bad
And of course also
Across the 15 million concurrent
Steam users
Or steam had just crossed that
The other thing of course they're doing with it
They're tweaking
It is kind of becoming a problem
In the game with people idle farming
So like in
Counter Strike Go
You can
Get different items
In the game, loot boxes
Or whatever and you can sell those items on the steam marketplace
To make money
And so people were just going idle
In the game because they would still earn the currency
In the game to
You know be able to
Oh no you should get kicked out if you're inactive
So now they've got more things
In place to basically check to see
If they're just sitting there
It's going to be harder for people to do that
So that is something
That they're working on as well
Stoppy in chat says
It's crazy the guy who made the game is the black sheep of his family
Now he's set for life and taking care of his parents
Amazing success story
No good I mean good for him
You know it's hard to hate on somebody who's made a successful game
Even if I don't really play it
Well here's my question
Actually
And those of you that are familiar with this game
I would think this answer is pretty easy
But maybe it's not
Are you able to just set up a game
Where it's nobody
It's nothing but people you know
Like you can set up a friends only game
It's like 100 people are playing
Yeah but can I play like a lower version
Can I play like an 8 player version
Where it's just people we know
I think right now because I'm on a laptop
And I don't really have like the keyboard mouse
Set up like I can't do
Mouse and keyboard basically
Because I'm just not used to that
I'm used to playing on a controller
Well Xbox has got you covered
For the years up
But it's interesting
Like I was watching there was an article
Kind of looking at some of the stuff today
About people are speed hacking in the game
And so running around really fast
Because they're saying you know right now
They're anti cheating systems
Not perfect but they're showing
Like one of the guys is like
He's a big CSGO player
And the guy's like speed hacking just running past him
He just takes him out
Just knocks him out
He's like I'm too good for this shit
So that was kind of fun
See MXC in chat says you can set up your own team
But I think that is still online against a mass of players
That's not really good enough for me
I would like to have a mode that's kind of more like private
So that I could just play with other people
Like me and my skill set
And other like vlog people
And twitter people and stuff like have our own
I think a lot of people aren't that great on it
I mean I don't think it's a lot of
There are some people that are good at it
There's a lot of factors that's kind of random too
Because it depends on where you drop
Where the center of everything
The arena is going to be
Plus they have new maps now
So there's a lot of
Random factors in there that may affect it
Alright
I think I need to check this game out
How much is it? It's not a full 50
It's like 40 bucks I think
I think I need to check this game out
I do
I'm apprehensive because first person shooter
Right yeah it's hard
Like coming into something like that
And even like Overwatch for me
It's kind of hard to like
You have to really be like doing this constantly
To be any good at it
But I don't know
I guess I'm a filthy casual now
Let's see going to our chat
Bobby Blackwell says you're going to find PUBG modes
I keep wanting to say
PUBG modes
Even though I'm getting the letters reversed
You're going to find PUBG modes
In all the AAA games now
Fortnite has a PUBG mode already
GTA online already has something
It'll just be like
Horde mode in Gears of War
Like every game
Mass Effect got something like that
You know what you'd probably like actually
That's kind of similar
It's basically Hunger Games
The Hunger Game mod is in
Minecraft
It's pretty low
You don't have to be a super expert player
It's literally
Hacking people with pickaxes
There's not a whole lot of skill there
But that looks a lot of fun
Every time I've seen people play that
I do play Overwatch
So it's not like I'm completely apprehensive
To first person games
The thing I'm really learning about Overwatch
As much as I like to play characters
Like Sombra and Pharah
Honestly, I just have the best luck
When I play Mercy
I don't want to say I'm good at Mercy
But I'm
I play Mercy well enough
Where I really feel like I'm pulling my weight
As opposed to certain other characters
What we really need is
We need an actual
Umm
What is it
Umm
What the fuck
The movie that started it all
Not Hunger Games
Battle Royale
We need an actual Battle Royale game
We said that years ago
Fuck the Imitators, we need the actual Battle Royale game
Didn't we have a, Dark Tetsuya
Didn't we have a list list
Years ago
That was
What movie do we need to make a game out of
And tell me
Battle Royale wasn't in the top 3
Had to have been
Had to have been
Maybe it's on the wiki somewhere
Everybody's trying to be Battle Royale
Battle Royale is just Battle Royale
S.H.O. 100 Matt says good thing Overwatch
Doesn't have commands like heal please
Protect please, oh no
Oh no S.H.O. 100 Matt
It does
You can hit I need healing
Or I need armor
Look
I fucking know you need healing
I'm playing a healer
Sometimes you're fucking hiding behind a wall
How am I supposed to fly to you if you're hiding behind the fucking wall
And the other thing that pisses me off
Is when I'm playing Torbjorn
I need armor
I will fucking throw you
All the fucking armors in the world
When I have enough scrap
But if you want to get mad at somebody
Get mad at the person that keeps
Picking it up off the ground when they don't really need it
I'll even try to like not
Throw the armor in front of that person
But they still run over and get it
Unfortunately
Totally doesn't work in that game
Dark Tetsuya says
Episode 66
Movie that most needs a video game
Okay, this is the scientific list list
Process here on OLR
The official answer is from our list list
Number 3, Kill Bill
That was a good choice, that was a very good choice
Number 2, Clerks
Can't imagine how that would work
I don't know what we were thinking
At that time, but it's kind of funny
If it's based off the animated series that'd be fun
I think the animated series was still kind of
New in our minds at that time
And then number 1, Battle Royale
So sure enough
On episode 66, we said they should make
A game out of Battle Royale
So Pugbee guy needs to pay up
Hey, I still won the Paper Plate Battle Royale
Alright
Let's move on
More stories for you guys here on episode number 700
Let's talk about a new game
That's been announced for the Nintendo Switch
Although, I think this is actually a
I want to say it's like a
Re-updating or something
Of a Apple TV game
And of course the site I'm trying to pull this story from
Is now not working, so I'm going to do this best for my memory
But Super Beat Sports
Is a harmonics game
And they have announced that that is going to be coming out on
The Nintendo Switch
This game was originally out for the Apple TV
But I don't think a ton of people
Are gaming on there
Some are, but just obviously the Apple TV
Is not a gaming device
So I think their audience is limited
It's kind of cool, they have some pictures of their official site
SuperBeatsports.com
So you can play these different sports
It's harmonics, music, games
And now it's going to be on the Switch
Yeah, they've got like five mini games
So based on familiar sports they said like
Tennis, hockey, golf, and volleyball
You play with up to three players
Or four players I guess
Motion controls
They're saying, you know
Or non-motion controls
I don't know, neat
Looks like a little Wii Sports
Type of game
As I saw a bit of the game on their live stream
It looked neat, yeah, I know they were live streaming
Some of it earlier this week, so that's pretty cool
So, alright
Alright, well let's move on
With some more news, DarkSakura
A computer gaming legend, right?
Oh yes
Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?
Why are you not playing the music? In my pants
Not your pants
I didn't
Unless Carmen also
Is now you know
Anyway
I need the music, Rob
It has to happen
But anyway
Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?
Was
An animated series in the past
And it was a fun
Game show
And
I think
Best theme song ever
Anyway, Netflix
This shit didn't exist from
I first played Carmen Sandiego on the
Apple 2E
This is what you babies
Got into in the 90's
No, no, no, Rob
It was all about where in time is Carmen
Sandiego
That was my jam
You know me, history nerd
As much as I love that theme as well
It's all about the chief
On the Carmen Sandiego
She didn't give no shit
Anyway
Netflix has said
Okay, you missed it, great
They've greenlit a new
Animated series with 20
22 minute episodes
That are coming out in 2019
So
Apparently
Gina Rodriguez is going to be Carmen
Sandiego and Finn
Wolfhard is going to be
Her accomplice named
Player
So even though this has to do with
A TV show
A cartoon, a Netflix revival
Maybe it will cause
A revival of the computer games
Because I think people forget that the game
Show came from computer games
Or maybe updating the computer games
That might have more modern
References to real countries
That exist
Kids today need to never be able to fucking find her
Sorry, Czechoslovakia doesn't exist anymore as a country
Oh, good point
The USSR doesn't exist
As a country
The world has changed
The world has changed
And then
Carmen is keeping herself alive through
Secret rituals
Involving the blood of every past gumshoe
That she's defeated
She's now a vampire
cannibal
That is being produced by
Houghton Mifflin Harcourt
Which is a name I haven't seen since I was like
In high school
Reading my schoolbooks
So, yay
Yay
Now we have to listen to the theme song the whole rest of the show
No, because I think there's
Copyrights that prevent that from happening
Anyway, by the way
Before we get to our next story, taking a step back
Real quick, Bobby Blackwolf decided
To jump in and look at the complete
Listless archive just because he was bored
And thinking about that segment
Are we really boring him that much? I think so
This is relevant, this is important
Bobby Blackwolf says we did a listless
In 2014 that was
What are we most looking forward to
At E3 2014
The number two answer
You ready for it? The number two answer that night?
Fantasy Star Online 2 on the Wii U
Here we are three years later
Let's go home, we're done
Sega can suck a fuck
Yes, I'm gonna use that phrase
Because I can't think of anything more appropriate
Than the anger I'm feeling at Sega
Sega, suck a fuck
And besides, I think we're owed some reparations
For the fucking Sonic the Hedgehog series
I mean
But they did kind of redeem themselves with Sonic Mania
And Sonic Generations was good
It's a start
Are we to forget all the other games that they made?
Rob, they can eat a sack of dicks
Zombie dicks
Real zombie dicks
Pulsating
With the occasional, you know, fly attached to it
She's
Flying around the world to steal zombie dicks
All the zombie dicks
Act Deft in chat
Act Deft in chat says
We need a new list list, how can Sega go
And fuck themselves for PSO
Moving on
Just a few more stories than the classic game
Of the week
Loki
So, it was very
Exciting to see that Journey
I mean, a totally different game
Not Journey, but totally Journey
Coming to Apple
TV, iPad, and iPhones
From that game company
It's called Sky
And it's like if you replace sand
With clouds in its journey
But it looks good
Well, we don't know until we play it
It's totally related
I would be really interested to try it out
On my Apple TV
What I played on my Apple TV to date
Is Sonic CD
With the right soundtrack, Bobby
The Japanese one
But, um
And it's episode 700
So you're gonna let her have her moment
And not cry tonight
Yeah
Anyway, so
It's creatures that look humanoid
But they're like floating
And kind of flying
And they have things that cause them
And there's
There's a big thing in the distance
It has a beam of light
It's fucking Journey
But whatever, it looks cool
I'll invest in it when it comes out
I can't wait to play it on my
Apple TV
I can't wait to play it on my $1000 iPhone
Because yes, the fuck I am buying
Across the room, high five
Yes, I am fucking buying that iPhone X
And you can miss me with that Android shit
10
I didn't watch the press conference, I just read all that
You can miss me with all that Android comparison shit, okay
My husband has an Android
So I get to see what's going on over there
We're a bi-phonal household
And that's the way we like it
And get that sweet new screen into my hands
Oh, girl
I was watching that keynote
And I'm like, yeah
I don't need to pay off
My student loan this year
Thank you, because Act F says buy phones
There it is
Alright, anyway
S2100 Matt says, but that's so much money
I don't know if that's said tongue in cheek
We so don't care
Well, isn't the Note 8 or whatever
One of those Android, it's $950
Something like that
I already put down
and priced what it's going to cost me for
the 256 gigabyte model
No, real talk for a minute
And I don't care if you're iPhone or Android
I really don't, it's your money
Spend it on whatever makes you happy
I'm going to let you know
Do whatever you want
Here's my thing, really, at the end of the day
When it comes to my phone
I'm at a point where
I wouldn't have thought this 15 years ago when OLR first started
I was using my shitty little flip phone
that had the little tiny
little 20 pixel big TV
It looked like a Dreamcast VMU
on the front that you'd use to take selfies
I can maybe play NES problems on this
Right?
So 15 years ago I would have never thought this about my phone
But the reality is, here we are living in this world
I use my phone more than anything else
Even my desktop PC
That's how much I use my phone
Especially with, you know, you guys know I do gaming
with Pokemon Go and Ingress and all that other stuff too
It's not even just that
I use my phone everywhere
So, honestly, I know
Yes, a thousand dollars is a lot of money
Of course it's a lot of money, but that's why
I haven't upgraded my phone in three years
So I've been saving money knowing that I'm probably
going to have to spend a lot of money to get a new phone
And it's like, I probably paid more than that
for my computer
Which in reality I use less
So
Anyway
Don't let anybody tell you how to spend your money
You want to go buy a new Android phone? Go you
That's awesome
You want to go buy an iPhone SE?
Because you don't need any of this new shit
You just want a fucking phone? Awesome!
Go you, get the phone that works for you
But don't tell other people what to do
Alright, moving on
Let's see, what do we have next?
Oh, oh, this is
This is not good, but I guess a learning
experience for everybody in this situation
So Destiny 2, which I
really, really want to play Destiny 2
But I'm waiting for the PC version
Because I just, I want my mouse and
keyboard support, so I'm waiting on
the PC version, so
But I'm hearing a lot of good things from the people
that are playing it on Playstation 4 and Xbox One
right now, but one of the not so good things
I'm hearing about is that
Oh, some armor snuck
its way into the game that was
Oh, it was kind of a reference to
white supremacy. Whoops
Somebody screwed up on that one
So, here's what, and a lot of people
wanted to know, how the fuck did this happen?
Like, how did this get into the game?
And basically, it was one of those things where
Bungie wrote this explanation about how
they do draw from real world
art iconography and other
design elements, and what happened is that
I guess the original meme
kind of came to their attention. You know how sometimes
memes get repurposed by
other crowds for bad things?
Isn't that what kind of happened to the frog?
Anyway,
Yes, because the frog is actually, it's a
children's book. Yeah, okay, so
So what happened is that they found, I guess
the way I'm reading it from Bungie is
they found the meme, but their own
internal team did not realize that that had been
repurposed into this flag
that represented something completely different
So, you know, Bungie apologized
and basically promised to do better, and they are
working to, I guess they did some
recent maintenance where they've really kind of
they haven't been able to scrub it completely
from the game, but they've like
they've changed it enough so that you don't
really recognize what it was anymore
and soon it will be completely
scrubbed from the game. That is what they're
doing there, so
There you go!
Dungeonbuster in chat says, wow, I play Destiny 2
and I never heard about this. Well, my understanding
is that ninjas went in the middle of the night
during one of the maintenance periods and
got rid of this from the game
and that's what happened, so
Bungie says, sorry about that, and it
won't happen again, but it just, it also goes
to show that the internet is a huge place
and you gotta be careful sometimes because
you know, you may not know that something you're saying
Yeah, I mean, it's not like, it's not overt like
oh, it's a swastika or something like that
Yeah, it wasn't something obvious
It looks kind of sporty
like, it's like a sports
thing, I mean
I don't know, like a
bike tracksuit type thing
But now that we know what it is, it's not okay
just to be clear
Okay, just to be clear
Anyway, let's
get to a, go back to a time
and a place when games weren't so fucking
complicated
It's the classic game of the week, and Dark Soccer
is gonna step into the gaming vault tonight
and pick a game that she says, hey
brats
you should be checking out this game
We've been telling you for a while
Now Dark Soccer, you've actually
talked about a while, we started classic
game of the week in what, episode number 250?
Something like that
So this would be, if I can math correctly
this would be the 450th classic
game of the week, give or take
Not necessarily because of
Marathon show, some one-offs
And the classic console
Oh, I forgot about the consoles
Okay, so give or take the
450th classic something something of the
week, so the rules
of the classic game of the week that
was established some time ago is that a game
must be 10 years older or more
to be the classic game of the week
But Dark Soccer, before I
unveil tonight's classic game of the week and before
somebody in chat says, that
game didn't come out till November
so it's not 10 years
old Well fuck you, it's my segment, my
rules
So that is the official statement for Dark
Soccer, it's my house
And if you don't like it
And I believe that my intent was that if it
came out that year, and it wouldn't be
the first time I've done it because I have done something like a month
before
So precedent has been set
So take your opinion, shine
it up real nice
Turn it sideways and shove it up your candy
ass, to quote
Sir Rock
But look, you don't want to taint this game
with, you just know that people are gonna
say something to chat about it
So what is the classic game of the week?
It's Mass Effect, duh
Can you believe
it's been 10 years though? I can't
actually, that's crazy to me
Oh, but this theme
This theme is so fucking good
I know
It's sad because I just think about
the ending scene, well I won't get ahead
of myself, but anyway
I always would let this go until Garrosh showed up on
the screen and then I would start
You can't
start until your title screen has been blessed
by Garrosh. Garrosh is space husband
number two. Fair enough
You don't know who space husband number one is
in my fandom
in my head
Your own husband, Dan?
Dan's not from space
I'm talking about space husband. Technically this planet
is in space, therefore he's from space
Are you sure he didn't fall from space and hatch out of
an egg? No, because he's not orc
He's not aging
and he doesn't drink orange juice through his finger rub
Anyway
Mass Effect, yes it did
come out in November
2007, but fuck it
But it was probably gold in September
It was in beta
The critics had it, sure
It was
originally released for
Xbox 360 in
2007, and it
of course is the first. It was intended
from the start to be
a multiple
chapter series
So we knew there would be more
They left it open for more
But you assume the role of
Commander Shepard, who there's only
one Commander Shepard in my heart
Sorry Mark Meer, but Jennifer Hale forever
Who was modeled first?
True story
We had FemShep first
But basically it was
So FemShep existed in September
MaleShep did not
Or something like that
Anyway
It used the Unreal Engine
3 for its groundwork
and
basically it was just
built from the ground up
to be an awesome
piece of video game
gorgeousness
And of course now we've got wonderful high res mods
and people are still
I was talking to
Becky the other day and she just finished it again
So, good job
Anyway you play as
Commander Shepard
Who you decide everything about
her or him
That looks like within the reasons of the game
And then you bust out the mod manager
And you change all of it
And then
you can take all your different
specialties
You can do different classes
Either biotic or non-biotic
And then you travel across the galaxy
Chasing a
completely, obviously
looking
messed up
looking turian guy
Who, I mean
How can you look at him and go
Oh he's not completely taken over
by an
inorganic species? No
Not with his face looking like
that and the circuitry
peeking out of his body. No
Saren's not evil. Saren's a nice guy
He gives presents to small children
And, you know, raises
money for orphanages, I guess
Anyway
So you take the Normandy
all the way across
Spending the entire game thinking about how you're gonna
fuck that turian
Wow
No
You have your romance options
Which were just three people
really, if you were
a dude you could romance Ashley
or Liara
And if you were
FemShep, you could romance
Kaden or Liara
Sorry, I'm just picturing in my head
DarkSakura having a YouTube channel
Hey guys, welcome to my YouTube playthrough
of Mass Effect where I'm gonna fuck that
turian
Well, it's pretty much the theme of my Tumblr
Anyway
Um
You've got more options
in later games, thank God
Cause, it wasn't
very fair, I thought
You know, dudes should have been able to
strip Kaden
Sorry, right from the beginning
But no, you had to wait until the third game for that
Sorry guys
It was worth the payoff though, in the end
It was kind of sweet, even though I still think he's too nice
Oh my god, Liara
in the first game pissed me off so much
Because she's like
Oh, I'm 106 years old
But she's really, that's like
being 15
in Asari years
Oh god, I do not have time
for all of my rants
Anyway, real time battles, those are fun
You have
your health bar, you can keep your squad
members alive, you also have
a morality system
that
leads you more toward
the polite and selfless
versus aggressive and hostile
Which is now
It can be known as
Paragon or Renegade
Paragon being how to charm people
and Renegade being to intimidate them
But yes
I could go more and more
and more and more and more about the game
And
I wasn't really into it when it first
came out, it took me a while
Same, same
Well, wasn't I also the one that kind of told you
you had to play it, give it a second chance
I think I even said
you'd be into the Tumblr fandom
And then I heard Garrus' voice and it was
over
His voice actor
is a very handsome fellow
Kind of goofy, but
I saw the episode of Buffy he was in and it wasn't
a good episode, I'm sorry that such a
talented actor had to be in that episode
of Buffy, it was not good
Anyway
I really don't
know how much more
I can say about it
This since had
the first game had
more DLC, Bring Down the Sky
and then
what was it, when
Pinnacle Station, that one was
okay, I didn't care for it
because it had like all the
deathmatch and capture the flag stuff
that I don't think is fun
But the
game got really
great reviews across the board
For
For the Xbox 360 version
when it came out, Metacritic gave it a 91 out
of 100, so that's definitely not bad
But as far
as other
things, it won
for the year it came out, it won
Best RPG for the Spike Video Game
Awards, Teambox
Game Awards gave it Best Role Playing
Game of the Year, Best Story, Best Game of the Year
IGN, you know
it won across the board
on a lot of different
best of's
And of course now, He Who
Shall Not Be Named, right?
Honestly enough
he kind of ended a controversy about
this game
Wouldn't necessarily end the controversy, but he
he shot something down
Basically, there was a neo-conservator
blogger named Kevin McCollod
Remember that, Rob?
No. Anyway, he was
you know, going on saying
it had virtual
orgasmic rape and blah blah blah
blah blah, and
He Who Shall Not Be Named
literally
said, this contrived
controversy is absolutely ridiculous
and it made the other guy shut up
The guy who is the enemy of gamers
everywhere
A certain lawyer named Jack Voldemort, if I remember correctly
Told this guy to shut
the fuck up, and he shut the fuck up
He apologized
but said he's still considered the material offensive
And it's basically people talking
about shit in the game, who never fucking played
the game, who were being assholes
about it. Anyway
So, eventually we have
had other releases of
this game
Of course, I played it on PC
which, you know, I also
like modding the crap out of my game
We had
the Xbox 360 release
Did it come out on
It came out on PS3
Um
Eventually, you had to wait
for the Mass Effect trilogy, I think
for it to finally happen, but yeah
And then it came out on Wii U
Not the original Mass Effect
Mass Effect 3 did
The original Mass Effect was only on
PS3, Xbox 360
Xbox One backwards compatibility, and PC
Yeah, which I, you know, like I said
I played it on PC, modded the fuck out of it
So that it has like
The textures in my game
look better than Mass Effect 3
did when it came out, so
Those space dicks
looked so space dicky
That hot Turian dicking in HD
No, they didn't give us
naked Turians. They had models for it
Did you know that? Didn't put it in the game?
No, I did not know that
They had models for it
Anyway, and because of this game
I mean, now I've got a blog
that is quite literally
six people away from hitting 10,000
followers. Nerd
Fuck, I don't know how that happened
I didn't think I was that funny
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says
There was this classic Fox News segment where Jeff Keighley
was talking about it, Mass Effect
And the opposing person admitted she had never even heard
of the game until about five minutes before going on the
air, and issued an apology
after being actually shown the scene in question
I do, I remember that controversy
Yeah, about what?
The sex scenes?
Yeah, the sex scenes in the game, basically
Casefully done, I'm on some fun
It was basically
Liara's space butt
Oh god
And so
But I mean
Yeah, actually
it's even brought up
The
Anchor's name was Martha McCollum
was her name
Anyway, anyway
It's just an awesome game
If you haven't played it, why the fuck not
if you've been listening to this show
the whole time
It's just really good, really fun
and really accessible
You can still get it on Steam
Or, I don't think it actually is on Origin
believe it or not
Because I bought mine only through Steam
I think it is on Origin now
Maybe now, but I think it took it a while for Origin
to actually update it since it
I think they had some license thing with Steam
Anyway, anyway
And of course, if anyone is interested
my Tumblr is
Mass Effecting
ing.tumblr.com
You can look at my stupid captions
that I've been doing for fuck knows
how long
And apparently, a few people like it
So
And if any of my Tumblr followers
are listening to this show, thank you for listening to the
episode
And shout out to y'all
Mass Effect is the best game ever
Alright, there it is
your classic game of the week
Mass Effect
A game you knew was coming eventually
here at Orange Lounge Radio, so why not episode 700
Alright, we're going to take a quick break
guys, when we come back there is more Orange Lounge Radio
to come, including your calls at Orange Lounge
Radio on Skype
We're going to get to the mailbag, we're going to talk about what
Reggie had to say about the Super Nintendo Classic
this week, and we'll talk
a little bit about a parody account that's going away
on Twitter
More Orange Lounge Radio with all that
and even more when we come back after this
quick break
The
Starboard Power Coupling Podcast returns next week
with weekly episodes
Join Captain Matt, Commander Eddie and Dr. Ken
as we do record googling, the news
and of course, structure discovery
away missions
And we have one chance to get it right
Welcome back everybody to Orange
Lounge Radio live tonight, episode
number 700 for
this, September the 17th of
2017, we've had a fun
show, fun show
so far tonight when I'm not getting tongue tied
where there was even cake and
fire, and cakes on fire
but we made a wish
Cake fire, what did you wish
for Dark Sakura when you blew out the
candles? If I tell you, then it won't come true
Well, let's be real, it's not going to come true anyway
because this is just a lie
that we tell little kids
I wished for impeachment
Or safe
Impeachment of me from the show?
No, you're not an official
Oh, you're right, that's right
I'm a cheer tater
Either that or you know
anvil, piano, the same thing I
want for Pat Robertson
Alright, we're going to get back into some more
gaming news, but I want to
thank you guys again for being here tonight
over in chat, over at live.vognetwork.com
JD in chat actually says, elect Rob
to public office 2018
You know I've thought about it, and I know I've said this
on the show before, because you guys know I've been with Alan
for over seven years, but before I was with Alan
a couple years before that
and I don't remember if he would have been on this show because
OLR was happening, but
I actually dated a guy for about a year and a half
who was a, well
he had run for state assembly, he didn't
win, thank god, but
he had won, he had run for public office
and I think I've said this before, from dating
him and the experiences that I went through
during that, I learned that
any idiot can run for office
and I think what you saw happen last
year probably just accentuates
that point, but any
idiot can run for office
Did you hear though that Eddie Izzard is running?
I did not. In the UK.
I did not. For, I think
for, not for PM
I'll have to look it up again, but still
there's a big article I posted
about it not too long ago, but Eddie Izzard
is running. Well and then don't forget our pal
Travis Donovan ran for
I think it was mayor of Killeen, where he
was, I think, so
remember he ran for office, unfortunately he didn't
it might have been city council, I forget, sorry, in retrospect
I know it was like a very local race
but it was cool to hear him go through that and talk
about that on his show
I've thought about it, but
I'm torn because
on one hand I'm like
okay, with all the footage
that's probably out there of me from the
Rocky Horror Picture Show and some of the like weird
shit I've said on stage, like I don't
know if I ever could get elected to public
office, or the vast 700
episode library of this program
somebody will take something out
of context and put it out there and
try to fuck with me if I were to run for office
but then... He's running for
parliament by the way. They had to listen to 700 episodes
of that show. Yeah, then
what great promotion for this show, but
then we elected a guy president
who said, you know, he was gonna grab
what did he say? Grabbing pussies. Grab him by
the pussy. Grab him by the pussy and that guy
got elected president. So then there's a part of me that's like
I guess it doesn't matter if I've said something stupid
that gets taken out of context. Well he probably didn't really want to get voted for
president, he just ended up becoming
president. Anyway, I didn't mean to make this political
but the story is really supposed to be that
yes, any idiot can run for
office and I've considered it
I think it would be interesting, I think it would be fun
I think I do
a good job listening to people and
playing mediators sometimes because
again, even though people might
try to take some of the stuff out of context that I've
done with Rocky Horror Picture Show
do you know how much fucking drama
there is in theater troupes?
Do you know how much fucking drama
has to be mediated when you're running a fucking
theater troupe?
And for a while
I did mediate that drama. I finally
passed that on to somebody else who mediates
it now and there's been no shortage
of drama but
for the years I did it
I did mediate a lot of drama and so
I think that's a skill that can be used
in public office quite frankly
so, anyway
there it is. Going into chat
over at live.vognetwork.com
actdeftinchat says are you really worried
about people taking you out of context
considering the lots of OLR edits there
are even done by yourselves
Editing is a powerful thing
and a powerful tool and I think it would be very easy
to take something I've said on this show out of context
and somebody could apply it to
a totally different thing that wasn't
about a video game or something
you know, that's just a reality
tigercolonchat says California did elect
an actor as its governor at one time
at two times actually
there wasn't just Schwarzenegger
one of those actors became president
Ronald Reagan was also an actor
way back in the day so was governor of California
Who's president of the United States?
Ronald Reagan, the actor?
and there's your Back to the Future reference
there it is, yes
alright, let's get back
into some actual video game talk now
we do have some games to get to
there's politicians out there
that play video games, you bet the guy I used to
date I think met his new boyfriend
husband, whatever, on World of Warcraft
so, maybe
they're married, I don't know, who cares? Alright, moving on
Loki, what do you have for us in games?
alright, so
this is kind of out of nowhere
but Okami HD
was announced for Playstation 4
Xbox One and PC
it's going to be coming out in December
it's going to feature 4K support
and
also widescreen as the original game
was just 4x3
so they'll be coming out December 12
digital and retail for
$19.99
that's a good price, yeah, looks pretty nice
nice
the game was kind of artistic anyway
so it's
maybe the best 4K game, but
it'll look nice, I'm sure
and then of course, because everyone's
up in arms, everybody
loves the new look of Mario without a shirt
and everything, so
now of course, take it
to modders
see, this is what happens when you trust
modders, they're going to remove clothing
and so now for
Super Smash Brothers
on the Wii U, they have a mod
where it's shirtless Mario
you can play as shirtless Mario
of course, of course
complete with Mario titty?
complete with Mario titties
as was meant to be
per Nintendo's own direct, clearly
alright, well, speaking of things
that Nintendo has changed
and apparently they have metal shirtless Mario as well
metal titties
even better, cut right through ya
moving on to other news out of Nintendo
hey, their Switch app
which was, it's kind of a mess
y'all, that Switch app was kind of a mess
but they're trying to fix some of the issues
with it, and one of the big ones
was fixed this week, the 1.10
update is out for the Nintendo
Switch app, and voice chat
will now work while in
the background, and while other apps
are up front and center, you know, just like
Skype and Discord and stuff have worked
forever, so Nintendo Switch app
finally moving into 2017
there ya go
so, anyway, it hasn't fixed
everything, but that was probably one of the biggest
problems with it, so congratulations
etc.
a little less congratulations
and more sadness towards the
fans of Battleborn
and probably hearing that the game is
pretty much done at this point, they're not pulling the plug
they're not taking the servers offline
but after the upcoming fall update
according to creative director Randy Varnell
the servers will stick
around for the foreseeable future, but
it's just going to be pretty much a static
game at that point, now in the fall update
there will be skins, there will be balance patches
but this is pretty much it
the game is really only about
not even a year and a half old, and it's been
free to play for three months, what happened
to Battleborn? Well, a little game
called Overwatch that came out around the same
time happened to Battleborn, so
Battleborn,
yeah, didn't do so great as a result
so there it is, Battleborn
is no longer going to really
be supported after
this next patch in the fall, but it'll still
be up if you're still playing it
moving on, Dark Soccer, what do you have for us in rapid fire
news? Oh, just some stuff
so a new
character is
been announced for Dragon Ball
Fighter Z, going on with
Yamcha and Tenshinhan
is going to be an original character
Jinzo Ningen 21
or
Nijuuji
she's got glasses
wears an interesting outfit
and is nowhere in
the series except this game
but she's going to figure into story mode
so, hey
I'm pretty excited, I like how she looks
she might be cosplay worthy
and then in
older news, there
is
Wonder Boy the Dragon's
Trap on
Nintendo Switch has outsold
all the other versions combined
so
and it's a really good game
it is, it's a great remake
although I wish that the
animal forms had like lady
forms to go with Wonder Girl
oh, I didn't even realize that that was missing
well, Wonder Girl is in there, just
no, I know Wonder Girl is there, but yeah
but every form is still like the fish man, the mouse man
I see, yeah
okay, well
the lion one's the coolest though because he drags the sword behind him
I love the whole you can hit a button
and instantly switch between like the Sega Master System
well, look, it's not
a direct port of the Master System game
because it's still on widescreen, no, it's a complete remake
yeah, but it looks
you wouldn't be able to tell the difference, really
you know, unless you are
really, really a careful eye, and it has
the FM music from the
Master System version, nice, which even
the cartridge, if you play it through an FM
capable one, the US cartridge
won't play it, nice
so, it's a good way to
get some of the stuff that we
lost back
going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com
Orange Right says
it's really great to play that on a portable
the Switch difference, with a trademark sign
around that, I think, I bought
Dragon's Trap on the Switch, and yeah
I mean, the Switch makes a compelling argument
for if it's the exact same game
that's being sold on Playstation 4
and Xbox One, the Switch makes a compelling argument
for, I can pick this up and play on the go, if I buy it here
that's why I kind of kicked myself
when I got Sonic Mania on Playstation 4
I mean, don't get me wrong, you know, it works
great on Playstation 4, and the game is still good
but I literally forgot it was coming out
on Switch, and I wish I'd bought it there
so, yeah
it'll be interesting to see what
Sony and Microsoft, if they choose
to do anything in response, well I guess Microsoft
kind of has the whole Windows 10 thing
so, it'll be interesting to see if Sony brings back the Vita
just kidding, I don't think they're going to do that
they'll probably just rely on the more power
that's in that system, as opposed to the Switch
I mean, let's be real, the Switch
is not capable of doing a game like
Horizon Zero Dawn, so the
Playstation 4 does always have that
Alright, let's travel around and check out
what is coming out in stores this week
Loki, what's going to be on shelves this week?
Quite a bit, so we've got the Solus
project on Playstation
4 and the
Playstation VR
We have Muv Luv Alternative
on PC
Zing The Land Beyond
on PC, Playstation 4

I don't know what that is
It's just a thing
Steam World Dig 2 on the Switch
Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2
on the Switch
Guild Wars 2 Path of Fire

The Lego Ninjago movie video game
on PC, Switch, Playstation 4
and Xbox One
And
Caveman Warriors
on PC, the Switch, Playstation 4
and Xbox One
And that's it
In Japan, it's actually a pretty similar story this week
for the Japanese releases
Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite
also gets its Japanese release this week
A couple days later on the 21st
is when the releases are coming out in Japan
Patapon gets its Playstation 4 release
We already had that here in the US
Looks like it was a couple weeks later in Japan
So the Patapon PS4 releases this week
And Project Cars 2
also getting a Japanese release this week
All that on the Playstation 4
Over on the Nintendo Switch, just one release
this week, but it's a pretty big one
It's the Dragon Quest X all-in-one package
Speaking of online games
I would really like to see
make it released
out here, that's one of them
But also, actually I believe the Pokken Tournament
is also being released in Japan
Yes, it is, just a day later
That's why I missed it at the first glance
But Pokken Tournament does have the same day
release as in the US and
as even Europe as Star Soccer
I'll get into it in a moment
Certainly not leastly, on the Nintendo 3DS
this week, Pocket Monster
Gold and Silver
is going to be released on the 3DS
Of course, that is Pokemon Gold and Silver
There are actually going to be little
cards that you can buy in stores
to then do on the eShop
if you wanted to do it that way for whatever reason
That is what you have to look forward to
on the 3DS
How about the UK Dark Soccer? I may have spoiled
one of them, sorry, but that's a worldwide release
On the 18th we have Echo for PC
and PS4
On the 19th, Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite
for Xbox One, PlayStation 4
and PC
On the 22nd, we have Pokemon Gold and Silver
Pokken Tournament DX

a pat on the ass and a job well done
Sometimes it's
uh, fuck you, you fucking fuck
Sometimes it's got cake in the subject
line
Let's get to tonight's
email, Dark Soccer
Greetings peoples, this week
I had a truly unique experience at work
I talked to somebody
Lately I've been taking my Nintendo
Switch to work with me and playing Mario
plus Rabbids
One of my fellow employees
saw me playing the game and asked me what kind of game I was playing
I explained Mario plus Rabbids
like this. It's like chess
You have different kinds of pieces that can move and attack
in different ways. There's also two sides
who fight each other using tactics
and strategy along the way
Also there are Rabbids on acid
I thought this was a good
way to describe Mario plus Rabbids
Given how my coworker reacted
he must have thought differently
This experience brought up the following
question that I'd like your input on
What should I, why should I
continue talking to people? I mean
you all claim to be
sentient creatures, but some of you lack the sense
lack the sense the demigod
gave yeast. Stay drunk
or entertainment
Is that a flying spaghetti
monster reference? I'm not sure
It might be
So why should I
continue talking to people? That's the question for us
this week. Don't
If you don't want to talk to people
don't. Don't do anything you don't
want to do. I will say this
that people who don't talk to other people in an
office environment tend to
get the piss
end of reviews and
you know aren't as well
referred to because networking
in your office is the way you
You might be labeled a bitch if you don't
smile. Or just the weird girl
who sits in that cube with her headphones
Well that was me. I was the weird girl
that would sit in the cube with headphones
Um
But I actually hit my current job
I fit right in with everybody else
So, or you know what?
Find a job that has cool people at it
Find a job where you don't have to talk if you don't want to talk
Although I think it would be a good idea
You do want to like at least talk to yourself
in the mirror. Practice with your
voice once in a while. Say it with me
I'm good enough
I'm smart enough and doggone it
if people like me. Of course you should
Just to make sure you don't like forget how to talk
or that your voice doesn't go out or something like that
You should still practice. And to be fair
entertainment
Some people might be pretty cool if you give them a chance
and talk to them. So
You know. There is a person underneath the suit
That's right. Don't do anything you don't want to do
But at the same time, take a risk
Sometimes it can work out to your advantage
Say hi to somebody new today
And then listen for blackmail
Say hi to a stranger
No. Don't say hi to a stranger
Cause they'll just give you a weird look and try to shoot you
What if they have candy?
Next email
Hello LR. I write tonight
not to respond to something on last week's show
Not to plug anything of mine
And not to shower you with bad puns
Instead the reason for this email
Is two fold. First off
I want to congratulate you guys on your latest milestone
Thank you. Thank you
700 episodes sounds like a lot
Because it is. It is
It represents an enormous amount of work
Literal thousands of hours
Of headlines, insights, interviews
And discussions. Plus the occasional
Rant and the frequent food tangents
Ok. Just to
Math. I don't mean to bring math
Into this. But I'm going to. Cause I know there's at least
A couple math nerds out there. Now
If I take 700 episodes
And I multiply that by
3 hours an episode
Except our earlier ones were
The earlier episodes were 2 and lately
Our shows have been running like 2 and a half hours
But
We had marathon shows
We did E3 specials that weren't numbered
Technically we've
I should be able to count the spinoff shows like courthouse 2
So we're going to just say to make it easy
3 hours. 3 hours an episode
3 hour trainwrecks
You could count
The show you did on OLR where you did
Pub of the volume. Thank you
I'd love to bring that back if we had some licensing
Well. Or look at
Doing remixes
Of overclocked or something. I don't know. Who knows
Alright anyway. So that's 2100 hours
Ok. So I'm going to divide that
By how many hours in a day
24
87 and a half
Straight days of content
Geez
So you would
To marathon this entire show would take
About 3 months
Just something to think about there
For a minute
You've built a community and kept it quite
Entertained. As a part of that community
Allow me to say thanks very much
Not only for the massive body of work
But also for continuing to put
On this show each and every week
For our enjoyment. Seriously thank you so much
We'll keep meeting you at that dinner table
This is a direct comparison
But if we look at TV
One of the stats I like to
Point out a while back was
The longest running
Primetime television show
The Simpsons
618 episodes
We've passed The Simpsons now
South Park 278
Gunsmoke 635
Lassie
We have more episodes on Lassie
Fuck that dog
Alright so moving on
Second I wanted to tell you that in working
On the UI for super multitasking
I discovered something, something
Unbelievable. A fact that has been in front of my eyes
For years in front of all of our eyes
Actually but I never noticed it. Maybe none
Of us did. So here it is
The shift key on the right side of the standard PC
Keyboard is whiter than the shift key
On the left side of the standard PC keyboard
This seems to apply to every keyboard I
Have except for keyboards built into Mac laptops
Where the shift keys are the same size
He's right
Like I've never noticed. I'm looking at the key
And here I am looking at my Mac to confirm
That they're the same
Cause I'm on a Macbook Pro 2014
Ok well the studio computer, I have a little
Microsoft keyboard here that's probably as old as this show
But sure enough the shift key on the right
Is bigger than the one on the left
Is that the same thing on a PC laptop?
Yeah my laptop's like that
Huh
You know in about a couple
More years we're gonna have more episodes in the
My life too
If we make it that long
The show could end at any time
Any time kids
Any time
Well am I the only one who didn't realize
This up until now? Or is this a shocking
Revelation for everyone present?
Chatters! Press 1 if
Your mind has been blown
And by the way, yes Jamie
I have been double spacing in between sentences
For as long as I can remember
I did take a keyboarding class in high school
And I honestly can't remember whether I started doing that
Before or after
And there you have it! Have a great week everyone
Erin Yyr
Yeah it's something that's like
A very common thing for people
Who took typing
Or had teachers who
Used for computer classes
Or nuns who would smack you with a ruler
When you didn't do it the way you were supposed to
Whatever. The double spacing is
Let's see
We have two, we have one
We have a dash
I always knew, I knew always
Says fifth dream
Come on buntiful cakes
Says mind blown
There you go
What I'm curious about is
How did that come into
How did you find that out doing multitasking?
I mean I imagine the shift key does something in your game
But how did that become important
That the left key was not as big as the right key?
I'm curious now
Well I think that the reason why is that on the standard PC
It's done to line up with the enter key
Yeah
Because it's as long as the enter if I'm right
Right you're right, not on mine
Not on mine it is
Well and I was looking at my mac
And those two were the same but my return key
Is the same size as my caps lock
So the whole thing is fairly symmetrical
Until you get to the arrow buttons
Doesn't have to do with where your pinky
Or your fourth finger goes when you hit the shift key
Like if it doesn't stick out
Far enough on the right side you might not hit it
I don't know but now I need to
Look at my iMac keyboard
And see if it's set up the same way
Because Mavis Beacon taught me how to type
Who?
Mavis Beacon
Like the grandma of internet typing
Right whatever
I learned to type getting into
A speed contest with my roommate at the time
Because
I wanted to be able to keep up with the AOL chat room
Never forget
F F F space J J J J
Space F F F F space
J J J J
Guess you didn't take typing
I didn't take typing
Mavis Beacon taught me
I learned on my own time
I didn't formally
Or through any type of instruction
Learn to touch type
I was kind of typing already
But then I was like well maybe I should like learn to type faster
So I started doing Mavis Beacon
Teaches typing and I got faster
Okay
I learned through AOL
Because of reasons
And that's it for emails?

Alright but keep it classy
Doesn't have to be a clean joke but keep it classy
Alright
Let's get back into some gaming news. Loki
Alright
So I'll try to be positive
Because we're talking about Nintendo
Good luck with that
We're talking about some classic systems
Sending prayers
So Reggie basically said
Hey
We know that the demand
Is really high on these systems
However I strongly urge you
To overbid on SNES classic system
On any auction sites
You shouldn't have to pay more than
$79.99 he says
And promising that they're going to have
More systems
Available at launch
That you know
Okay not maybe plentiful
But it will be
Easier to find them
So
Don't buy from scalpers
Which really is good advice you should buy from scalpers
But kind of unheard of
That they also announced
That in 2018
They're bringing back the NES classic
So apparently you know
There is a huge response obviously
The demand is so high for the system
That they decided that they're going to be bringing it back
Summer of 2018
With brand new shipments
So
Interesting. Wonder if it's going to have different games with it this time
Probably not
I think the only thing that will
Probably have changed on that system
Is however they hacked into that the first time
Will probably be patched up
And I can't believe nobody else is bringing this up
At least not that I've read
Like people are either going the route that you're going
Or like oh maybe it'll be a 2.0 with new games
Which ain't going to happen
Or it's just the whole
Oh they're finally remaking what they did before
I don't think so
I think there will be a change in that firmware
And it's going to block whatever method they were using
Now don't get me wrong
I'm not stupid enough to say that
But I'm just
I am saying they're going to block whatever
Has been doing
Whatever is the method now
A good indicator will be the SNES classic edition
When that comes out to see
What's capable of that
I'm assuming that will be hacked immediately
I would assume the same would be the NES classic
Honestly I don't know
Like I get it
That people like to do that stuff
But you know what the people like to do that stuff
They probably would still
They're not going to not buy
It's just that they like all their stuff
In one spot
Although they're classic games in one spot
Take the fucking hint
Perhaps release the virtual console
Perhaps you could even make
A virtual console
Since you're dicking around with a virtual console on the Switch
Make a system that's like the NES classic edition
That hey guess what
It looks all retro and shit
And it connects to the internet
It connects the fucking ROMs to it
And make it affordable
Stopy in chat says yes
I too expect a patch to combat hacking
Original ones will still go for money because of it
Over at live.vognetware.com
It is a little weird that they're suddenly
Coming out and saying they're going to make more of them
But at the same time
Is it super surprising? Not really
I'd be curious to see how many
Are going to make how readily available they're going to be
And if companies like GameStop or
ThinkGeek lock them behind
Like a paywall to get that shit
I'm also going to say this to Reggie's credit
I know it's very easy to be cynical
About what he's saying and believe me
There's a large part of me that's very
Cynical as well and I definitely feel
Actions speak louder than words Reggie
So if that's Super Nintendo
If pre-orders are not supposed to be
The barometer for availability for this thing
Then I hope you're able to prove it
Day one, actions speak louder than words
But at the same time
I'm hopeful that that action
Is coming based on the fact that
He said anything at all
Cause let's be real
He didn't have to say a goddamn thing
So there's a part of me that's thinking
Maybe there is
Hope for people
That do not yet have a Super Nintendo
Pre-order but still want
To get one of these. I mean that is a pretty
Powerful statement for Reggie
To come out and say, don't buy from
Scalpers, we gotcha
Now again
I wouldn't
I come from a place of pre-order
Privilege with this because
I do have a pre-order, at least right now
I still have my pre-order with Best Buy
But I like to think that even
If I didn't have that pre-order secured right now
I would
Feel a little better about
This but I'd probably still be going right
At 8 AM or whenever the store
Opens the day these things come out
I still don't think they're gonna be that plentiful
But maybe instead
Of stores only getting
24 of them or whatever it was
Last time, I have to ask Allen how many it was when he went
Remember when he camped out at Best Buy and still couldn't get one?
Maybe
Instead of 24 per store
Maybe there will be
72. You know, maybe the number's
Gonna be a lot higher
And something where people that do line up
And bother to wait
Will get one. So we'll see
We'll see
Alright
SHA 100 Mountain Chat says
Rumor is that
Targets are getting 30-90 stocks
Of Super Nintendo Classic
I'll believe it when I see it
Alright, let's move on to
Some more stories
Including a story about Final Fantasy 14
No, I'm not gonna be
Doing a big commercial for the MMO
But I do think it's kinda neat
That because of the hurricanes that have happened
Recently here in the US, namely of course
Harvey and Irma
Which, you know, obviously those images
Of the things that Harvey did in Houston
And what Irma was doing to the keys
You know, is really horrible what's going on
And we talked about that last week
Well, I don't know if you know this, but in Final Fantasy 14
If you don't log into the game
And go into your house
Every something like 45-90 days
I think it is
I can't remember exactly how many days it is
I wanna say it's as far as 90 days
But it might be as low as 45
But if you don't go into the house regularly
It is demolished and the space
Can be sold off to somebody else
You get all the junk that was in your house
Go to like a refund vendor
Or something that you can still do for 30 days
And you get some of the guild reimbursed
But not all of it, but this system's in place
We'll have to ask Allen about it because
He didn't log into the game for so long, his house got demolished
I was on
When the demolition notice popped up
I'm sure mine is long ago
Well, did you ever buy a house?
No, I just have a guild room
Then you're fine
Those don't go away unless I delete it
Or whoever, no because you went to a different guild
I went to a different guild
Whoever your guild master is, as long as they didn't delete it
Or kick you out of the guild then you still have it
But anyway
My point with all that is that
Final Fantasy XIV and Square Enix
They actually put a stay on that
So right now they did a patch last night
That stopped the clock
Or not last night, it was Thursday night
They did a patch that stops the clock
It's been two weeks
Yeah, two weeks starting on September 15th
So there will be a two week grace period
With no demolitions
So this way people that are without power
Or not able to log into the game for other reasons right now
Will have an additional two weeks
To get to a computer, log in
And be able to keep their game
And keep the house going and all that stuff
I would imagine a lot of people just had
A friend log in on their behalf
But of course that involves giving your password away
Which you're not supposed to do
I'd be lying if I said I haven't done it in a similar scenario
So somebody I really really trust
Alright, there you go
I just think that's kind of neat
That the MMO is changing its rules to accommodate for
The real world scenario
Alright, Stoppy in chat says
More like Final Foreclosure
Am I right? Yes, yes you're right
Alright, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
Stuff
Actually this one is
Another way that video games
Have done good things for people
And actually this comes from
Rome actually
A Serbian father
Who was living in
Italy
Actually had his thirteen year old daughter
Trapped for four years
To sell her
To a buyer in France for
Eighteen thousand dollars
Yeah, good dad there
And she
Actually used
A video game
To help herself escape
Um
So I'm trying to find exactly
What it was
Um
She was being groomed
To be a child bride
And um
She
Oh, hold on
I'm sorry this is taking me a moment
Anyway
She had
Been in school until she was thirteen
And then she was locked up
But she had
A video game on a
Simless cell phone
That she would play
But one day she got an alert
That she had
A weak
Password free wifi network
Near her
And so she used the wifi network
On the video game to find
A multiplayer feature on the game
That she used
To help
Call for help
She said that a lot of people ignored her
Until they took it seriously
And she gave the person the information
And then the police were able to track her down
So um
She's under police protection
Her asshole dad is in jail
I hope the guy in France who was trying to buy her
Is in jail
Because that shit is not cool
Yeah
But um she used a video game
It's interesting you know these stories
Sometimes we've heard the dark side about how MMOs
Result in really bad
Situations for people when maybe young
People meet people they met online
On an MMO or something we've heard kind of the bad side of that
So it's nice to hear the good side
Too not that this story is necessarily
Good because we get into this whole
Element of human trafficking which is a really
You know sick thing that's happening in our society
And it's one of those things where it's like
I think a lot of us don't realize that this
Shit happens in the world and it's pretty sick
But the good news is that
This girl was saved
Because of whatever it's curious that they
Don't name the game she was playing
But perhaps it's nothing we would recognize anyway
Since she was in Italy right
So you know it could be a game that was localized
For you know Italian audiences anyway
But it sounds like it was something where you could
Interact with other players so thanks
To the chat in the game you know she
Got rescued she was able to put out that call for help
So that's that's great
And that's great that her dad was too stupid
To think of that that that could be a possibility
Yeah so
Good on her yep
Hope she's able to
Turn life around and have a
Great life in spite of that
Really really really truly her hideous
Experience yeah so
Alright anyway
Let's see going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com
Kind of an interesting
Story again about kind of like the good things
Of gaming and you know kind of piggybacking on
The Final Fantasy story
We had a minute ago as Joe and Hunter Matt says
I remember when Hurricane Sandy hit
New York there was a mall in Connecticut
That had power and offered free
High-speed internet for people who are without power
From the storm I remember seeing a
Dude with his PC rig hooked up in the food
Court of this mall doing his
Wow dailies
Maybe not what was
Intended the Wi-Fi to be used for
But people have their priorities
All over the place actually when I
Was in Alabama a couple years ago
I went to the Dunkin Donuts
And someone was there
Two people were there with a full PC rig
Playing MMOs
You know and in spite of
I'm sure some could make an argument that
The internet traffic maybe shouldn't have
Been taken up by that but at the same token
You know in times
Of crisis like people's mental
Health is a very serious thing and maybe
If this is what this guy kind of had
To do to
Take a mental break from the stress
Of the situation then
Is it really that bad
As long as everybody else's internet was working then
You know so be it right
Anyway let's move on
Just a couple more stories for you guys then we're gonna
Open up the Skype line if any of you want to call in
And say hello here on episode 700
You'll have that ability shortly at
Orange Lounge Radio all one word on Skype
Please if you've never called the show
Before give Echo123
A call first just to test your connection
Meanwhile Loki
I'm excited to see CEOs step down
From their posts but
I'm gonna have to report
That CEO Kazurai
The parody account on Twitter
Is gonna be retiring
2018
Just uh
The parody account
The parody account yes
It'd be funny if he came back it's like
Somebody else like another CEO
Well did you read the letter from the guy
Who was running it and kind of
You know I guess the gist I got
From it was that well the joke's running out
And I don't really have the motivation
That I once had yeah it was basically
No here's what he says
For over eight years now
I've been running this Twitter account originally started
Because I wanted to make jokes about video game news
Rumors press conferences but I knew
Nobody in real life would have
Um knew
Nobody in real life that would have gotten them
Um between then and
Now I have somehow
Really managed to gain over
100,000 followers
Uh this has included people in the games media
That I read on a daily basis
People that I have worked with
Some of my favorite games and most importantly
Of all um Shuhei Yoshida
And um you know
Just it's been fun from the very start
Ton of fun but it's been um
You know looks like it's getting hard
You know recently though I've been tweeting a lot less often
Um you know
I still play spend plenty of time playing
I spend a lot less time following video game news
Um basically saying
Therefore I've decided to
That in 2018 will be the last year of the Twitter account
Um
So he says I want to do an account
For one more for
E3 I also want to give myself
To do a proper ending
For the account I just don't know what it is
Going to be yet and
I'm rubbish at giving things up
So be interesting
He used the word rubbish
Must be overseas
But all joking
Aside and sleuthing on who might be running
It aside
It's interesting that there's such a
Lead time on this you know what I mean
I'm ending it after the next
E3 which is still a good nine months away
So
That would be like me saying Orange Lounge
Radio is going to be done in the
Year 2020
It's just quite a lead time
Yeah it's I don't know
Don't take me serious I don't
This show is going to keep going
Until it doesn't
That's what I pretty much always said
Alright
Anyhow
One more story for you guys before we
Call it a night here and get to your calls
Let's talk about Mario 64
How about a new mod
For Mario 64
Well I don't know if I would call it a mod
It's kind of weird because I don't think they exactly
Modded the cartridge I think what they had to do
They went in here and they actually like
Did a patch for the emulator
I think they like mod the emulator
So instead of just hacking the ROM this tool for
Mario 64 will let you
Go into the virtual
RAM of the emulator and then
It shares information
So that you can play
Super Mario 64 online
That's right up to
24 people playing
Super Mario 64 online
With each other
You can play as other characters too
You can play as Waluigi which I think is very important
To point out
Princess Peach, Rosalina
And what's great is they all play differently
Like Princess Peach has her floaty
That you would expect right
And Wario's in there and a lot of the other Mario characters
Toad it looked like he ran really fast
And you control each other
What's that?
Oh you control each other too?
You can beat up each other and kill each other
Oh that's awesome
Well they already did against his first video that he put up
Kinda yeah like the video got
Taken down for the music
Because they did use the music from
Mario 64 in the trailer at least
IGN because I guess IGN
Doesn't get strikes on their channel because it looks like they
Reposted it they just reposted the video on their channel
And it's up it's fine you can see it
So yeah just do check it out
I do know that they had like a
Website that's dedicated to their forms
Or whatever that you should probably check out
Just because I'm assuming that you know all these
He has the links to the downloads
In the actual videos
But you know if you want to check out the forms
It's sm64o.com
And
You know check out the updates on there
But yeah I watched some gameplay of it today
And it looks fucking hilarious
Just like even watching people like there's
I saw two people doing a
120 star run or whatever
And like during it
One of the guys like was sitting there
Doing like an animation or something
And he put them behind it was funny
It's just I don't know it's really cool
You can see each other but it's not entirely
In sync so you'll see like
For example like when you're throwing the bomb king
Or whatever off the mountain you'll see kind
Of Mario spinning around there's like he's holding
Nothing it's just like kind of spinning around
But it's it's neat I don't know
The 24 players at one time that
I want to see some
Awesome games done quick with that
Nobody asked for this
Before we open up the skype line which we're about
To get to here so if you want to give us a call
Orange Lounge Radio all one word
On skype
JD in our chat says regarding
The last story about the
Advanced notice of ending the account
JD says I don't know in some ways
It's kind of nice to give your fans some warning
If it's possible though
You know it may in some cases
It's not always possible you know
I don't know what will happen with OLR
I don't like to think about ending the show right now
It's just kind of one of those that's why I say it'll be done
When it'll be done if we can give notice
I think we will but if we can't
Putting you on notice
Then we're not going to be able to
It just kind of depends on what the situation is you know
I just think but maybe
Do you think maybe there's too much
Notice
Nine months
That's a lot of notice
Just saying
Yeah so anyway
I don't know it's not necessarily a bad thing
I guess didn't Lost
Set their series finale like two
Years in advance because Lost was kind of
Starting to fall up it's own ass a bit
So they the ABC was like
We're going to set the end date now so that you know
When the story needs to be wrapped up
We also know like
Game of Thrones is going to be the end too
Yeah that's true
We've known that for a while but that's Game of Thrones is also
Based on books even though the books aren't done
They've so deviated
Yeah well yeah at this point
Hasn't George RR Martin kind of told them what's
Supposed to happen in the books not that I guess that it matters
They do deviate from the books but
Not as much as Walking Dead deviates
Though right? Doesn't Walking Dead deviate
A lot more? I don't know
I don't know because I don't care about Walking Dead
Well and those shows are all on Sunday night
Yeah
I mean I was able to watch the entire run
Of Twin Peaks but the whole on demand
Element of that really helped so there was that
Alright
The Skype line is open right now
Over at Orange Lounge Radio
All one word on Skype
If you'd like to give us a call you can do that right now
In the meantime I'm going to check in
While we wait for some calls and see if Loki has any
Last minute stories
Yes apparently there is some modders that are
Making a demake of Half Life 2
In Half Life 1's engine
Called Half Life 2 Classic
And it looks
Old
As Half Life 1 would look
But yeah
So apparently they have
A demo that's available on ModDB
So go search for Half Life 2 Classic
And you can check out what they've got so far
Which
I don't know
The fans continuing to
Deliver on Half Life when Valve will not
You know
They never asked if
Whether they could it's just whether
They should have
Dungeon Buster in chat pointing out
Regarding TV
The Americans is also ending in a season or two
I don't even know that show
I have to look to Critical Myth reviews
To tell me what's popular on
TV right now because a lot of times I don't know
But I just look at whatever John and his team is writing
About Dungeon Buster in chat
Also says this last season of
Game of Thrones isn't based on any book
Just a general outline
By Martin and then Bob
Coffee caught your reference that I also
Caught with what you just said saying life
Finds a way
Orange Lounge Radio
Again all one word on Skype
If you want to give us a call here on our 700th
Episode not that I'm guilting you
Into it but
Or is Skype working?
Hopefully somebody in chat if somebody
Is trying to call and is not getting through
Let me know because I know
Bobby was having calls
C Rama says we're not answering
This happened earlier
On another note speaking of Mario 64
So apparently there's another guy
I think the guy that was maybe doing
I don't know if this is the same one that did the editor
Like the Mario thing but he made
Infinite size levels
For Super Mario 64
So he's got like a level that's like
Mario Kart or something that Mario is running in
That's ridiculous
Oh it's in the WooHoo Island is actually where he's running around
Wow that's crazy
All these mods man
So apparently
Some of our listeners
I was worried about this because remember how Bobby tried to call us
At the end of the show and it wouldn't work
But I'm on right now
And I got the little green check mark
Did you close it and open it again?
I'm turning it off and then on again
I have turned it off
And I've now turned it back on
So we'll see if it'll work
And what we'll do there
We'll give it a minute just to see if anyone gets through
If not shoot
I should have had Plan B
Up and ready to go
But I didn't
But we can always I guess field questions from chat
If we have to do it that way but that's going to frustrate me
Because that's even worse
That's even worse than when Skype wouldn't work at all
At least I could kind of see that
So wait a minute
Did the recent count just go up?
Am I just not seeing the calls
Come through because I see that this person
Has tried to call twice
Do they have a way to turn off notifications or something?
I'm not sure
I'm not sure
It's that wonderful window
I went into tools options
And it's like think think think
I'm trying to go into and this is the beauty of radio
Everybody is that sometimes
Let's see uh yes
I don't want sounds but notification setting
When somebody tries to
Call me
Yes I should see that
Ugh
That's awful
Alright well
On our 700th episode
How appropriate that everything
Shutting down
I'm going to see
If I can quickly put together plan B
Can you guys fill like two minutes?
Sure
Let me sign out of Skype here
While I put together plan B
The joys of live radio
Take it away low key in our soundtrack
Do you have any stories we haven't covered?
No I have not
It's very slow
Well I can see what I can dig up
Umm
I've been building with Legos
While we've been doing this
See because they have wonderful programs
One through Bricklink which is called
Stud.io or Studio
And you can actually build stuff
With digital Legos basically
And what's kind of cool about it though
Is when you're done building it
You can build parts
So I decided as an experiment
Just to kind of learn the editor for this
I'm building my house
And so it's just been
Laying out floor plans
And stuff like that right now until I can
Get something that looks proportionally
Correct
Are you going to put your house in your house?
Yes
Actually my idea
My idea was if I can make
You know some good
Box that I would give them
To my kids as Christmas gifts
Because they would have
Their own set and it would be cool
Cause one of the ones I was going to do
Cause I really like the Lego movie
Stuff where they had kind of the remix sets
So like they have one that's a fire
Truck mech
And so my
Son wanted a garbage truck
Mech and I found a garbage truck
Design that's one of their
Official sets that I thought that could work
Well for that with just a little bit of tweaking
And so I'm
Going to do that eventually but right now
While I'm learning
How to actually use the editor I was going to start with something
Easier like my house
Which would be cool cause I just built
One of the creator sets
The fish
Was the old fish shack or something like that
Fish store
And that was pretty sweet
Kind of gave me a lot of fun ideas
This is all part of the stupid obsession crap that I have now
God damn Legos man
I swear to god
Such a mistake to
Shouldn't have gone to the Lego store
Should not have gone to the Lego store
But now I'm just like
Running low on money because of stupid Legos
I keep looking at that Millennium Falcon
It's so expensive
And not really worth it
I mean it's worth it if you're a fan of
Star Wars I'm not that big of a fan of
Star Wars
And here's the other problem too with those
A lot of the collector sets like the modular buildings
One they're way overpriced
And two like
For like my kids plan like I wanted
I have the choice between
One of the modular buildings
Or the fish store
One that I got
And I went with the fish store one cause my son wanted a
Diving mask for the mini figs
And they had tons of them in there
And so the only problem with the fish store
Is it's meant as more of a
Display piece
Than being able to play with it
Cause it's too tight to get your hand
In there to actually move the
Figures around or even the moveset
It's just such a cramped thing
And they even designed like the staircase going up to the office
Where a mini fig can't even fit through there
So I wanted to make something
More that they can actually
It's open and they can play with but it looks nice
Okay I have Skype Plan B set up
Alright cool
I'm gonna hope it works
But I don't know until we get a call
So instead of Skype natively running through the computer
What I've done is I went and grabbed my iPad
Which is a new iPad
It looks like it might be working so we're gonna see right now
If this actually works
If I hook it up this way taking the call through my iPad
I'm trying to take this call
And let's see if it works
Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio who's this?
Yay Plan B works
Yay Plan B
Thank God
And we didn't need a prescription
Thank God for Plan B
Hey friend
Oh wait wait are we playing a cam game now?
Are we really doing it?
We're on the iPad
I got video
Hey he can see you too
The official alcoholic temperature
Of Orange Launch Radio and the vlog
Fireball
I think that is
Ewww veto
I think that is part of
That might actually be a Brad reference
Brad from Pod Culture reference
Let me check
I'm gonna check our audio out
When it's running here
Sorry Rama can you tell us a little more
About your drink that you're having there
Oh
Actually you are not even coming through
The recording at all
So
Our podcasters
Aren't even gonna hear them at all
That's so stupid
Alright let's try this I'm gonna move them over here
Oh
Oh no
I know what it is
I know what it is
Yes it's live radio what can I say
I'm having to go to Plan B
How about now
Now we can't hear them at all
Oh my God this is the worst day ever
No it's a great day
It is a great day
Cause we ate cake
Line L mono
On 910
Now how can we hear them
That is a lovely
Studio you got there going Rob
Yay it worked ok and it's coming through on both channels
Thank God
And I love this shirt as well
Oh well thank you I appreciate that
I didn't even dress to I'm wearing a shirt from
Labyrinth and I didn't dress to be video
Tonight so
I don't think anybody do but you know
We gotta put it on our best face
That's right
And now this shot of
Fireball is to commemorate
700 amazing episodes
Thank you so much my friend
I'll take a shot of
Water or is it water
I'm not
I'm surprised you don't have a bottle of wine there
I'm kinda surprised I don't either
But maybe I think something about
I'm actually gonna be giving you my bottles of
Moscato when I can't drink them anymore
Oh darn free wine what am I gonna do
It's good wine too
No she'll come over and help you drink that
Wine
Well Rama anything else you
Want to say here on episode 700 I appreciate
You beta testing this whole
Plan B setup but
At least we know it works now
In IT a beta test is
Generally the real deal so it's all or nothing
As a
Famous YouTube viral clip once
Said fuck it we'll do it live
There you go and by the way
Metroid returns
Samus is fucking amazing
That game is awesome and since we
Are on video I have a chance to show
The listeners that call in tonight the beauty
Of my Samus 3DS
Which is amazing
And I love it so
And I have to say I can't
Give GameStop as much shit as I used
To because I got
A collector's edition from their store
On Saturday you can give them as much shit
As you want okay what's the I have to admit
I missed the collector's edition so what is
In the collector's edition that's not in the regular
Edition hold on let me see if I
Can find it sure why not we'll do it live
Here we go
Alright he found it yep
He's got his collector's edition he found
The 3DS and act F
In chat also says I'll still give them shit
Okay so it's one of those little paper boxes
But you know what they gave me
The collector's edition which is
The soundtrack to the game nice
Oh can you drop box me that
I got you
Alright thank you thank you
And it's a normal
Cover but
Oh that's where the flippy cover
Is huh yep
Reversible so you can make it an original
Gameboy yeah I saw that
And when I
Went looking online just to see if I could
Make sure I could find it it seems in the UK
They got the legacy
Edition which was more stuff I'm like
Fuck yeah I thought I saw something on Twitter
Where like this guy had like a ton
Of that stuff it was like
There was a sculpture
Amiibo it was all this crap
This is awesome art book
Yeah but you know what
From GameStop I got a box
Of Reese's Puff cereal can't top that
Why?
I don't know I have a couple friends that work at
GameStop I guess when you
Picked up your copy of Metroid you got
No no Ramy you don't need to answer that
Why the fuck not Loki
That's weird
Why the fuck not
Because it's weird
No it's not weird
Peanut butter is amazing in all forms and should be encouraged
There's a bottle
There's a thing of Jif right on top of my microwave
Okay crunchy style
Good times good times
Alright my friend I'm gonna let you go to try and squeeze in some more calls since we lost some time here
With the skype segment but
I appreciate you as always hearts
And good luck with everything on anime jam session this week
Oh you got it you take care
Yeah bro and play more Metroid
Duh you don't have to tell me twice
Alright see you my friend
Alright bye
So skype now works if you want to give us a call
At
Orange Lounge Radio all one word on skype
And we figured that out so again it is hooking up
At my ipad
Through my mixing board and what was happening
There earlier is that I had him plugged into
A port where admittedly it was the left channel
Only but that's because only on
Some things will it work on the
Left and the right channel where it's mono
And I fixed all that so
Now they said the only bummer
Is that if you don't actually catch a call
You're gonna hear the ringing noise
I thought I'd picked up a call
But apparently that didn't happen
So if that person wants to call right back
We'll try to get them on
Again it's Orange Lounge Radio all one word on skype
I think the bummer about the ipad
Is it takes a minute to connect
Versus the other one
Takes a minute to come through
Live on our 700th episode
Of Orange Lounge Radio
Whew
So house-ception I only overheard part of that conversation
You're gonna give it to your kids someday
Well I thought about like it would be cool to like
Design a set
For my kids that's like unique
I like that
That's a good idea alright let's see if maybe this call
Is coming through now I think it is
Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this
Hi this is Elliot B
Are you calling all the way from overseas
Or are you still in New York now
No I'm still in New York although it is a bit late here
It's a little bit later but not like crazy later
Well welcome to the show thanks for being here
Yeah hey it's great to see you guys on camera
Thank you
Happy 700th
We weren't supposed to be but things being as they are
That's how it worked
So thank you very much
What's on your mind tonight
It was actually my birthday today
One minute left of it
Happy birthday
It is my good pal
It's his birthday today too
He was one of the hosts of Koopa Club
When that show was still around
So toast to birthdays
What's on your mind tonight
Well so I actually want to talk music games
Please
I managed to find
I was in a second hand game shop
In New York
And found a second hand copy
For $20
Did it have the controller with it too?
Right so not only
Did it come with a controller it came with two
Turn tables and a mic
Oh nice
Bexong two turn tables and a microphone
That was like a collector's edition at one point
Wasn't there like a collector's edition you could buy
They had the one that was
The collector's edition
Actually had like a case
That turned into a table
So it had like a fold out thing
To put the actual turn tables on
That is a
DJ Hero 2 is like severely
Underrated as far as music games
Go too because well have you had a chance to play it?
Yeah yeah quite a bit
What do you think? I was playing it this weekend
I really like it I mean it's very very technical
I was surprised by how
How complex the controls are how many
Buttons and knobs and
Sliders there are
You know there's so many kind of things
I'm used to kind of you know Guitar Hero
Where you're just like you've got five notes
And then maybe the hammer-ons and stuff
And here you've got like you've got a crossfade
And you've got to turn the dial
And you've got to scratch in different ways
And yeah
Yeah it's very different it's not like Beatmania
2DX which is really easy to compare
To be right there's a lot of other stuff
That goes on but I think
That game is tragically underrated
Really and it just kind of it kind of fell
Out because they oversaturated
What was going on with Guitar Hero
And Band Hero and all that stuff kind of
Kind of oversaturated that market
And it's a real bummer that DJ Hero kind of paid
The price for that because that series is awesome
And I really love the concept of
Mixing the two songs together I think some of the
Remixes that came out of those games are like the best
I don't remember if it was in the game itself
Or it was DLC but there is like a
There's a Mary J. Blige versus
Queen it's
It's all of
Me and Radio Gaga I think
That is such a good mix
It's so good
Like that is like
That song is like one of my favorite things to come out of
A music game ever
Oh I have to look out for that no I don't think I've unlocked it yet
Yeah either it might be
See I feel like it might have been in DLC but
Hopefully the DLC is still out there
Yeah I really like the fact
That it likes to do freestyle and stuff
The improvisational aspects
Like is missing from so many music
Games there's no creation going on
Right and you know it may just be
Like playing samples to a beat
But that bit is so much fun
It's so rewarding
Oh yeah it's great and yeah
The fact that some music games that are done today
Are kind of done a little bit lazier
Where they're not really key sounded
And I think with DJ Hero you had those key sounds
So it's like if you were playing things off beat
Or you are freestyling the key sounds
Would kind of come out in the game and I think it's
So much more effective than some of these lazier
Music games that don't really
Like you don't notice when you make mistakes if that makes sense
Yeah exactly
Well Elliot I'm very jealous
Of your fine there
Only 20 bucks for that
I'm going to have to keep my eye out at some of the local thrift stores
And see if maybe I can find a version of that
Of course I don't even
GameStop has that stuff
Do they?
I bought DJ Hero 2 because I already had the turntables
I bought a copy for like 2 dollars
I bought mine really cheap too
At a dimple
I wish there was a way to play it on Xbox One
But see there's been too many changes
With the last gen
Was it on PC?
No well it was wireless
I have a
I had a demo
Controller
So one of my controllers is wireless
One of them is wired
Which they never made a wired controller for that
But I bought the
Was it the
Demo unit because I got it early
With 3 songs
Alright well we'll have to keep our eyes peeled
But Elliot it's good to hear from you
Thanks for calling in on this episode tonight
Yeah congrats, happy anniversary
Isn't anniversary? Happy big number
Happy big number, I think that's a good way to put it
There was cake, happy cake
Indeed, yeah
It was weird cake, I saw it on Twitter
Awesome, alright you take care my friend, thanks for calling
Bye, have a good night
Alright, Orange Lounge Radio
All one word on Skype if you want to get through
I could probably squeeze in one more call here
Before we wrap things up for the night
And I think we have one coming in right now
So I'm going to try to take it
If it will connect, if the video will go through
Of course I'm hitting the button
And the iPad takes a little bit longer than the PC
Does to do this, but when the PC doesn't work
This is what you use, but I think we're finally connected
Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
Hey this is Raginator
Hey Raginator, good to hear from you, what's up my friend?
Not much, well first
Just want to say happy
700
And with any luck
You guys will make it to at least
1337
So we can officially be elite
Yeah, how many, let's see
If it took us 15 years to get this far
Then it would probably take us about another 15 years
To get that far
So we would be looking at
First off I would be pushing
I would be 54 years old
At that point
And it would be the year 2032
If I'm not mistaken
And Half Life 3 still won't be out
And Half Life 3 still won't be out
So
Now
I did have a
Question in my
Right now
It's kind of eluding me
While I was trying to conduct
But
Now
I know
This is going to be really
I'm making a
Lousy radio
Because I'm doing picture
But I mean
No secret that
I've been having PC
PC problems
Yeah
This is the kind of connector that
My new fan
Found on my computer
It looks like there's a tiny little plug
With three pins on it
And a big old honking
Four pins on it
Let's see if I can
Aim it on the inside of my computer
I don't see many places
Where I can plug
This is totally
This is totally a tech support call
Going on right now
Yeah I don't see anything
Right where that fan
Can plug in
Do you?
No because it's too fucking dark
I can't see anything in that picture
They plug in out of the power supply
So if you have a modular power supply
You may be able to do that
Or the other thing you can do too
Is you can buy just at a PC store
Like a splitter
So it will have a splitter that will be able to
You plug it in and you can split it off
To build
You may not have
See on yours
If you're using a modular supply with like
SATA drives
You may not have the old molex connectors
Because they don't use those anymore
For the SATA drives
I would check if you still have
If it is a modular
Power supply
You may have some cables
For those molex connectors
They should have something or at the very least
There's
Something you can
Possibly buy to split it
Or if you really want to you can cut it
And splice it in there
Hey look you're getting offers from our chat
Rama says if you send the photos
He'll link you to everything you need
Chatters helping chatters
I love it
Now to try to bring this
Call back to actual gaming
Not tech support
Now
Now
One thing
You may have been noticing
Is that
Is the way I've been talking more and more
About
GLG.com and probably
A little bit less about Steam
Not to have anything
Against Steam you know I love
A lot of you got me started on
Steam
Is there any
On games on
GOG that may not
Necessarily be on Steam
That you would recommend
That you know either I
Or
Listeners in general may be
Overlooking
Good old Civilization game
Especially the original if not some of the sequels
I really wish those would show up on
Good old games
I know Colonization showed up
Which is pretty good
I haven't played that one through GOG myself
But that is
I think they have not only
The actual original
Colonization game from the late 90's
But I think they have the reimagining
They did around Civ IV
Because Civ IV they did like a
Colonization but yeah
Anything with Sid Meier's name in the title I'd recommend
I think Alpha Centauri is on Good old games too
Yeah I'm not
Actually I'm not
Too terribly positive
But I'm
Just like
64 chance
In favor of at least
Civ III be on
GOG
You know I'm
Reasonably sure that
They did have a
Promotion where
Now you can
Buy it
Add it
On the
Front page
Yeah
I'm noticing too some other recommendations
From chat where Dungeon Buster says the gold
Box series from SSI on GOG
Is good but is really hardcore
CRPG's
There you go
I think again the old
Oh Castles
Is another old game I bought on there because I used to play that game on PC
Like a long time ago I think it was actually Castles 2
But yeah
Dip in the archive of old
Shit from the 90's you're gonna find a gold mine
Alright
Well I'm sure
I'm taking up way too much of your time
There's probably some other people
That want to call but
Have a nice day and thanks for all the years
That you've been doing the show
Definitely been making my Sunday nights
You are most welcome
My friend appreciate the call
In and good luck with Rama
Solving the tech support issue which now Rama is offering
To do a live tech support show
Here at VoG I think it would be great
I'd love it so alright take care my friend
Alright have a good one bye
Actually you know if there's not enough calls for tech
Support oops if I don't mute it then you guys
Hear all the Skype noises sorry
What you're using Skype this is totally
Unprofessional man
I don't listen to this show anymore
So yeah I mean you guys
If they were to do a show like that I think it would be
Hilarious even if they didn't just do tech support
Cause you know there's probably not gonna be enough people
Listening really in all realness
To fix all the tech problems but
They could do you know tech advice
And tech help and
Life hacks if you will
Or computer hacks I don't know anyway
So I don't think we're gonna
Get any other calls so I think I'm gonna go ahead and shut off
The Skype line for now which I guess to do that
I would just swipe up there it is
Skype is done alright
So that's gonna do it for the Skype line tonight
Thanks for those that called in I'm very sorry
If you didn't get through especially if it was because of all the
Technical failures we were having early on
But you live you learn that'll be
The theme of 700 more episodes
Hopefully of Orange Lounge
Radio I don't think we had
Any other last minute stories right Loki?
So I think it's about time for us to wrap up hey
I wanna thank you guys for listening
To Orange Lounge Radio over these years
Thank you again so much for
Everything over these last 700 episodes
And we're gonna keep going right on going with
Episode 701 next week

To be here next
Week so y'all better respect that so

Passion and time with us
Thank you, you're welcome
Alright let's go right into everybody's final
Thoughts for tonight and then we'll bring it back
With episode 701 next week
I guess I'll go first and my final thought is
I really need to hang these lights up already
The Dark Sakura bought me like two months ago
But I'm really lazy y'all
I need a complete
Actually this whole studio needs to be redecorated
Because seriously we got posters up
You never did put up the thing that the poster I gave you either
The scroll
The Mega Man scroll
Oh yeah I haven't hung anything new up in here
I've still got a poster for Final Fantasy 11
Online
What is that? That's a poster for Pop and Music 11
On the Playstation 2
But it's autographed
No it just looks like it is
I think it's autographed
The Borderlands one is autographed
This is Cody got us this Borderlands one
He met all that team locally
Anyway let's get around
And get final thoughts from everybody else
That was mine so Loki your final thought
I guess I'm building
Or playing the Lego thing tonight
Yay Lego thing tonight
