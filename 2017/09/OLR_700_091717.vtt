00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice

00:38.000 --> 00:44.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 700

00:44.000 --> 00:51.000
That is 700 of our program for this September the 17th of 2017

00:51.000 --> 00:56.000
My name is Rob Roberts here with my co-hosts in Studio N7

00:56.000 --> 01:01.000
Based out of Sacramento, California here to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
Hello hello, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Poop

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
How are you?

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
Poop

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Woop? Woot?

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
That's all you have to say after 700 episodes?

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
I said poop

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
Oh poop?

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
Well I guess talking poop emojis are the rage this week so why not?

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Oh my god

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
Nah I'm doing okay

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
I'm just looking at wish.com and this site is such a train wreck

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
What is that?

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
It's like where you can buy stuff for cheap and you really never know what you're gonna get

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
That sounds awful

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
First off I don't want to give them free advertising but that's

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
So wait you just

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
Am I hearing this right?

01:36.000 --> 01:41.000
You give somebody money and you're saying give me a treat and you don't know what treat you're gonna get

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
No no no you pick you can pick the item

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
Oh okay

01:44.000 --> 01:53.000
But it's like I've gotten like stuff for like very very drag things and cosplay stuff from here so

01:53.000 --> 01:59.000
I was gonna say I could just imagine where it's like you know I give money and it's like I like Metroid and then they gift me

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
Oh you get a copy of Metroid Federation Force

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
No

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
No

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
That's not what I meant

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
That's not how it works

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
Okay good good

02:06.000 --> 02:10.000
Also joining us of course as he does every week say hello to tech master Loki

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Hello

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
Hi Loki how are you?

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
Fine

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
Yeah you went to a little show with the kid yesterday right?

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
Yeah

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
One of the kids

02:17.000 --> 02:22.000
Went to this like it's like Disney on Ice for people that like superheroes I guess

02:22.000 --> 02:26.000
But without the ice and so it's it's like a

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
Disney on pavement

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
Sort of

02:28.000 --> 02:39.000
It's Marvel Universe Live so I tried to take my son to it a while ago when he was much younger and he was afraid so we took him again

02:39.000 --> 02:45.000
And he sat through it and complained but he enjoyed it he says

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
I don't know

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
He may or may not have been being truthful

02:49.000 --> 02:55.000
He's a little too old for like he's kind of like you know he knows that they're just people in costumes he's not really like you know

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
It's like okay I know

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
So he was too young before and now he's too old this time like it's really

03:01.000 --> 03:05.000
Well he's very sensitive because like they have explosions and fireworks and stuff

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
Like you know stage effects you know little fire things and stuff

03:09.000 --> 03:15.000
This year because I we didn't really watch last the last time it came through but

03:15.000 --> 03:19.000
From what I saw online and what like the few five minutes that we were there

03:19.000 --> 03:24.000
It was a lot more like elaborate stunts going on versus this year is very tame

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
Would it have been more exciting if it was on ice

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
No

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
It would have been weird

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
All right

03:32.000 --> 03:44.000
And hello to all of you in our chat room because we do tape live every Sunday night at the voice geeks network vog network dot com six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show six ish Pacific

03:44.000 --> 03:51.000
I think we're getting a start at 615 tonight because Bobby ran a little long but we don't mind because he always has us on at the end of his show so sometimes that's why it goes a little long

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
But you guys can chat along with us of course in our chat room at live dot vog network dot com

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
Where Mega Man X 400 starts us off tonight saying

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
Grats you old bitches

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
I can think of no better comment to start off tonight's show

04:05.000 --> 04:10.000
Thank you very much and there's been a lot of kind words on Twitter and places like that

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
People saying congratulations on 700 episodes

04:13.000 --> 04:26.000
I wish I could say we have a special great grand thing for you tonight but after 100 200 300 for it look I don't want to sound like that guy but I guess I am a little bit it's kind of like you get to a point where you're like

04:26.000 --> 04:33.000
You know maybe we should just keep doing what works best and what keeps people coming to the show every week so we'll just kind of do our do our normal show

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
Or we procrastinate too long to plan a thing so fuck it

04:36.000 --> 04:43.000
Yeah that too we got a little old we're a little slower to move now that we're older that's that's just the way it goes sometimes

04:43.000 --> 04:48.000
But I really do truly want to thank you know those of you guys that do take the time out to listen to this show

04:48.000 --> 04:58.000
Sometimes I see the tweets and emails and chat comments and stuff from people that say this has been a part of my Sunday night for 10 years 15 years you know even five years whatever

04:58.000 --> 05:07.000
And I'm always really humbled that you know people have kind of made this a part of their Sunday nights as we have and I just really can't thank you guys enough

05:07.000 --> 05:16.000
And some of you guys maybe have just recently discovered the show in the past few weeks and I think that's awesome too that you know people are still discovering this and deciding to try it out for a little while

05:16.000 --> 05:23.000
So just you know big thanks all around I do want to of course give a couple other thank yous that are that are so important

05:24.000 --> 05:30.000
I'm always afraid I'm going to miss people when I do these types of things but I know there's a few people that this show just would not be here without

05:30.000 --> 05:44.000
I think I have to give a big big big big thank you and props to Jason or VX JasonXV not only does he do that intro that you hear every week without fail or without me like begging and pleading he just does it because he wants to and all that

05:44.000 --> 05:54.000
But I mean a lot of the technical stuff like having a website to handle the traffic that will that large mp3 files generate like Jason's always taking care of us in that regard

05:54.000 --> 06:09.000
So I again cannot really I cannot undersell the amount of the amount of stuff that Jason has done for Orange Launch Radio that the show just like would not be here if it wasn't for him so thank you so much for Jason

06:10.000 --> 06:19.000
And of course I would have to give big big thank yous to Mr. Bobby Blackwolf he likes to call himself the opening act to Orange Launch Radio as he has been for many years

06:19.000 --> 06:37.000
We like to think of it more as like a dual headliner act sort of thing but big thank you of course to Bobby just has been you know a partner in things like the Voice of Geeks Network and so forth and just very very like minded as to us as to why we're podcasting in the first place and what this whole thing is about so you know I can't really thank him enough

06:37.000 --> 06:53.000
And of course my pal Travis who started under Station Live which in some ways this show is a spin off of in some ways so you know I can never say enough thanks to Travis for really really introducing me to the concept that any idiot can do this

06:53.000 --> 06:59.000
Thank you Travis for being that idiot and exposing this to me and I say that with big hearts and thank yous

07:00.000 --> 07:15.000
And yes as Tigerclaw points out in chat Travis is starting a brand new show yes I have heard the rumors I've heard the discussion on that I don't really know anything that you guys don't so I'm excited to hear that Travis is considering coming back to the radio

07:15.000 --> 07:24.000
He's apparently considering coming back to Dragon Con so there's a lot I'm very excited about but I will let Travis talk about that when Travis is ready it's not really my place to

07:24.000 --> 07:38.000
So there you go that's oh and I should of course I think one more person I have to say thank you that we don't thank enough is I have to say thank you to Midihead who does the intro to this show that you've heard for god a good 500 episodes now at least

07:38.000 --> 07:42.000
Like that little opening riff that you've heard has been a part of this show for a long time

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
We don't have anybody else to remake it

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
Well I mean but there's

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
We had somebody and that fell through

07:47.000 --> 07:56.000
It goes a long way to say that like we kind of don't need anybody the only reason we would do it is because then we sit here and realize sometimes you want to repaint the house

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
I'd take a new intro from Zircon

08:00.000 --> 08:16.000
Well whoever whoever would be willing to do it we'll look at that but rest assured this Midihead intro we've had has worked for 500 episodes and that's great and you know he didn't charge us for it or anything he just did it because he knew that we were big supporters of music based games

08:16.000 --> 08:23.000
Music based games and that he was a part of those at the time if you recognize that name he did some remixes that were in DDRXBox and I think he had a song in Beatmania

08:23.000 --> 08:33.000
One of those crossed over to Beatmania 2DX at one point I think my memory is getting a little fuzzy at this point but I think one of his Sana remixes ended up in Beatmania 2DX at one point so there you go

08:33.000 --> 08:49.000
Alright so as promised last week Dark Sakura got us a cake so what kind of oh she's taking a picture because that's what you do to food these days is you take pictures of it so I will try to describe it to you guys because she's actually got candles

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
700 candles

08:51.000 --> 08:56.000
700 candles on this cake I kept telling Dark Sakura it's not our birthday

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
We got a butt cake

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
It is a butt cake

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
It's a bunt cake

08:59.000 --> 09:03.000
Actually you need to talk about the cake while I take a picture and put it on the OLR twitter

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
And take one before and after the lights are lit

09:06.000 --> 09:20.000
So anyway there is a place in Sacramento that I think they're actually all over the place but it's called Everything Bunt Cakes and I like them because they are a good company

09:20.000 --> 09:32.000
They support many good charities and are fairly well they don't care who you like to shtup when it comes to making a cake I'll put it that way

09:32.000 --> 09:37.000
Oh yes I forgot we have cake politics in this country but yes I mean it's important

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
So let the candle so we can take pictures of that too

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
Okay I will hold on

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
So it can be on fire

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
Well I have to post this on twitter it's very important you have to describe the cake

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
It is a chocolate bunt cake

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
Yes

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
8 inches

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
Yes

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
And

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
And it looks like an asshole

09:51.000 --> 09:55.000
Like that's the other thing that's the other thing you're neglecting to say it looks like an asshole

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
It's a butt cake

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
It is a butt cake

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
It's a chocolate circle

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
It's a chocolate butt cake with white frosting on it

10:00.000 --> 10:07.000
It's got frosting on the inside and then streams of like frosting tentacles coming out

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
Frosting tentacles

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
From the sphincter of the butt cake

10:10.000 --> 10:14.000
It looks delicious and kind of gross at the same time

10:14.000 --> 10:24.000
But I figured it's an occasion and occasions are always the best reason to have cake

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
Especially delicious semi pricey cake

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
So

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
I'm lighting candles there is fire in the OLR studio

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
Rob's extending fire from his grasped hands

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
These candles are hard to open

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Fire is not very effective on those candles

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Oh Rob

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
Okay can we try not to burn down the house though

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
Alright everybody get your pictures in

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
Hold on I gotta go and take

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
Yeah your turn

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
Seven almost looks like a one it might be confusing to some people

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
Okay who's blowing it out

10:54.000 --> 11:00.000
This is the worst radio us trying to blow out a cake

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
Okay here we go

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
Make a wish

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
You can listen to us all blow

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
Make a wish here we go

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
One

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
Two

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
Five

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
I blew from over here I'm sure I was doing something

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
Yay

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
So see as we promised last episode there is indeed cake

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Yes and it's all for us

11:18.000 --> 11:22.000
Alright we'll try to get those pictures posted on the twitter shortly

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
But first it is a video game podcast believe it or not

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
So we should get into some gaming topics

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
There was a lot of Nintendo news this week

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
Loki did you take a minute to watch the Nintendo direct that happened this week

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
Yeah I did it was alright

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
I mean they talked a lot about different things coming out

11:38.000 --> 11:43.000
There wasn't really a whole lot of surprising stuff except for I think you know the whole minecraft thing coming to 3DS

11:43.000 --> 11:47.000
Say hey by the way minecraft is coming to 3DS and it's out now

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
Go check it out I mean so that was pretty big

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
That little it's out now surprise was cute

11:51.000 --> 11:58.000
I mean that's pretty major and at least digitally they're going to release a physical version not too far away from now

11:58.000 --> 12:03.000
Then they just a lot of announcements of different things in the pipeline

12:03.000 --> 12:11.000
So for example they talked about Skyrim and how they have it dated now when it's going to be coming out

12:11.000 --> 12:19.000
And then of course they were saying that along with that they're also announcing that Doom is going to get a port to the Switch as well

12:19.000 --> 12:28.000
And even Wolfenstein 2 the new colossus will be coming so lots of stuff which is pretty cool

12:28.000 --> 12:34.000
Yeah that's what Bob Coffee in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says the big story is Doom on Switch

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
And Dungeon Buster says Wolf 2 coming to the Switch was surprising

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
And I would agree I thought those were kind of the biggest headlines from the whole event for me

12:40.000 --> 12:44.000
Is that how Bethesda is really you know supporting the Switch in a big way

12:44.000 --> 12:48.000
When we haven't had Skyrim go on sale yet

12:48.000 --> 12:53.000
And I don't know about you guys but I'm not expecting Skyrim to perform super well

12:53.000 --> 12:59.000
But maybe maybe I'm underestimating the power of people that only buy Nintendo consoles

12:59.000 --> 13:05.000
You know maybe or the fact that sure enough they did put in a little homage to Zelda in it

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
You know with the amiibo

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
Did you notice the fine print I might add

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
Uh oh

13:10.000 --> 13:14.000
So there is fine print here just in case if you think that you need to purchase certain things

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
You know the amiibo stuff that they have for Zelda

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
Oh they're elsewhere in the game right

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
Yes

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
They said that in the direct they did say that in the direct

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
They said it was they would be in dungeons

13:23.000 --> 13:27.000
So you don't necessarily feel that you have to go purchase those amiibos

13:27.000 --> 13:31.000
You can still unlock the stuff so I think that's nice that they're doing that

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
Instead of locking stuff behind a paywall type thing

13:34.000 --> 13:39.000
Um I'm curious to see though how it's gonna run and what it's gonna look like

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
Cause I feel that with like especially Wolfenstein and stuff

13:42.000 --> 13:46.000
I'm wondering what kind of a downgrade we're gonna get on those

13:46.000 --> 13:51.000
Well some of the folks were looking at Doom and comparing it to Playstation 4

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
And saying you don't really notice it

13:53.000 --> 13:58.000
So that's especially considering you can pick it up and go on portable that's pretty exciting

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
Yeah so that'd be cool

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
Lots of lots of 3DS stuff as well

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
I mean even still we can talk about the Switch as well

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
So just kind of some of the stuff

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
Lots of remakes I've been noticing

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
And you know kind of one of the things I was worried about even with the Switch was that

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
Oh shit there's gonna be a lot of stuff that they're just gonna kind of remaster

14:16.000 --> 14:20.000
But even that's kind of going along with um

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
Even with the 3DS and stuff

14:22.000 --> 14:27.000
So you got like Mario and Luigi Superstar Saga being remade that's coming out October 6

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
Um you know they're talking a little bit about you know

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
They have uh what is it?

14:33.000 --> 14:37.000
Kirby Battle Royale now is a new thing that's gonna be coming to the 3DS

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
Yep so 3DS is still going

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
A new orange 2DS XL

14:42.000 --> 14:48.000
Um there's of course Mario Party they're doing a top 100 best minigames

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
And that's coming out on 3DS which

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
I was like why isn't that on the Switch?

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
Like that should be a Switch game I would think

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
Well that's what a lot of people are saying about the new Metroid game

14:58.000 --> 15:01.000
Which I'll you know I'll talk about the new Metroid game a little later

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
Cause you bet your ass I played that this week

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
And um you know I'll get into it during our gaming weeks

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
But I know there's been some people I've seen on Twitter that have said

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
I'm not buying this on the 3DS cause I'm waiting for the Switch version

15:12.000 --> 15:16.000
And I don't know if there's gonna be a Switch version I gotta say

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
Like I

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
They're gonna at some point gonna get desperate for content

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
And you're gonna see a lot of ports of stuff

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
I mean cause we've already seen that for the Wii U

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
I don't know I just and I

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
Look I was as much as anybody else saying

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
Nintendo needs to just bury the 3DS

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
And fully invest in Switch at this point

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
But Nintendo clearly does not want to do that

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
For whatever the reasons

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
Just indecisive

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
Yeah well I don't know if it's just indecisive

15:40.000 --> 15:44.000
As much as they're like well we still have all these 3DSs that are everywhere

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
So we can make software that can still sell to all these

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
You know millions of people that have them

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
While we still face the hardware challenges with the Switch

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
And something else to just think about

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
You know that may be coming into play

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
Is that we do have to remember that

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
Nintendo exists in more countries than just

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
You know the US and Canada

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
You know and even Japan

16:04.000 --> 16:07.000
Except Brazil cause that's where the Sega Master System is still alive

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
Well okay but you say that tongue in cheek

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
But in reality

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
Maybe there's something about the fact that the 3DS

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
With as old as that system is

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
Is much easier to get in other countries

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
That aren't usually the ones that get the first wave of games

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
No one's saying that they don't have to develop for the 3DS

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
I'm just saying why wouldn't they develop for both systems

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
I would think that that would be a title that would

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
You know do well on the Switch

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
I mean

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
It probably would but I will say this

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
The Metroid you know not to spoil my gaming too bad

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
But I'm going to

16:37.000 --> 16:43.000
The Metroid game on 3DS has the best 3D on the system

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
Period

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
That I've seen

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
So it's weird because I thought at one point

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
Nintendo was moving away from 3D

16:51.000 --> 16:55.000
With these 2DS's and the fact that it was barely in Pokemon Sun and Moon

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
3D for the Minecraft works pretty well too

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
Yeah but the 3D in this new Metroid game

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
Is pretty fucking mind blowing

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
Like it's really good

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
And it's what makes it work

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
It's the right amount of 3D

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
It's a 2D game

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
But it does 3D effects when it needs to

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
That work really well

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
So there is that

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
So and if you put that on the Switch

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
You're not going to have the same 3D effects

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
Of course you can play this Metroid game in 2D mode

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
And probably still get as much out of it

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
That's not going to you know like if you're like

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
I don't like 3D or I can't see 3D

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
I still think you'll get a lot of the Metroid game

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
But I mean for those that do enjoy the 3D

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
Like this game does it very well

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
The other thing was for the Switch

17:37.000 --> 17:40.000
Of course they talked a little bit about Xenoblade Chronicles 2

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
Which will be coming out in December

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
Snipperclips is getting a new release

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
And they're getting new DLC

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
So it's kind of like a game of the year edition

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
A remaster

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
Not a remaster but it's like kind of like you know

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
The bundle with the DLC thing that's going to be coming out

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
So that's something Project Octopath Traveler

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
Which looks pretty cool

18:02.000 --> 18:08.000
It's kind of how I think they should do all the 2D RPGs honestly

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
That was another one of those today surprises with the demo

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
I didn't get to play the demo yet

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
I'm hearing really positive things about it

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
I just haven't gotten around to it myself yet sadly

18:18.000 --> 18:24.000
Of course they announced along with the new trailer for Super Mario Odyssey

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
That they have a Super Mario Odyssey Switch bundle

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
That's going to be coming to Red Joy-Cons

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
At the end of October

18:31.000 --> 18:37.000
And then they showed off some new worlds for Mario Odyssey

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
Which looks alright

18:39.000 --> 18:43.000
Dragon Quest Builders was something that's going to be coming to the Switch in the spring

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
So lots of stuff kind of announced

18:46.000 --> 18:50.000
A lot of it thankfully was for this year

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
But I don't know

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
I was hoping for some more new announcements

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
I know they're going to end with Mario

18:58.000 --> 19:01.000
Well you got to be careful with these directs

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
Don't ever set your expectations too high

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Because you're only going to leave disappointed

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
I'm sure there were a lot of us that were thinking

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
Oh this is what they're going to do

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
I did, I will say this

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
I was expecting they were going to announce a Bayonetta remaster

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
To go with the rumors we were hearing about last week

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
With the Playstation 4 and Xbox One and all that

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
That didn't happen

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
And that was a little disappointing

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
But then I have to go

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
Rob don't set your expectations

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
Because they're never going to be met

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
That's just the way Nintendo works

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
I think a lot of people

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
Way too many people were hedging bets on

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Smash 4 being announced

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
Smash for Switch being announced

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
Now was not the time to do that

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
Maybe Tokyo Game Show

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Although Nintendo doesn't participate in Tokyo Game Show

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
That doesn't mean they won't participate in the news cycle

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
That comes that same week

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
But we'll see

19:48.000 --> 19:52.000
Nintendo announced a system in January

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
Which was not what people usually do

19:54.000 --> 19:58.000
So Nintendo clearly marches to the beat of their own drummer

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
Who may or may not have rhythm

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
And it works for them

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
So bless their hearts

20:04.000 --> 20:07.000
But you forgot the biggest thing that came out of the Direct Logie

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
You forgot the biggest thing that set Twitter ablaze

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
Mario's titties

20:12.000 --> 20:16.000
That was the thing that everybody is talking about on Twitter

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
Which even, I got to admit

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Even I'm looking at this going

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
What's the big deal?

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
What is the big deal

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
About Mario's titties?

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
That's the thing, the big deal is

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
It wasn't necessarily this

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
That was a big deal

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
Other characters

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
I think it was from Fire Emblem

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
Or something else that had some sort of swimsuit

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
Costume thing

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
They had basically

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
Censored the nipples out of it

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
Like male nipples

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
In the US

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
For some reason

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
I don't know why

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
I really don't care

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
But it's like, why

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
Why did you do that?

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
It's such a weird thing

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
People don't like seeing nipples

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
But Mario, they're just like

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
Flipping out

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
Jamie, did you get a look at Mario's titties?

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
For five seconds I was like, okay

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
Who cares?

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
Apparently people with no life

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
Apparently the entire internet

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
I just

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
I was just surprised that Mario shaves his chest

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
That was the thing that struck me

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
As most like, wow, he manscapes

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
Apparently

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
Is something that he does, so there you go

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
Well it would have been very awkward if it was just like

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
Fucking Ron Jeremy type shit

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
Well somebody

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
There was some tweet floating around where somebody actually

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
Photoshopped all the chest hair into it

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
Of course there is

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
I was like, that looks a little more realistic

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
But whatever

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
To register participation for this week's episode of

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
Orange Challenge Radio at vognetwork.com

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
Use the passphrase, bucket

21:53.000 --> 21:56.000
Going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
MegaManX400 says

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
Mark my words

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
Smash 4 is coming

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
They're waiting to announce their online first

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
And Act F says at this point we'll probably see Smash 5

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
Oh, thank you for reminding me

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
That was the other thing that was sorely missing

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
From this

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
Where the fuck is the Virtual Console?

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
Where the fuck is whatever else we're calling it?

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Where the fuck is the online?

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
No mention of that whatsoever

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
I think expecting that to come out

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
In 2017, you might as well forget it

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
I do think at this point

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
We will hear about it in January of 2018

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
I think

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
Virtual Console is not something

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
We're going to hear about this year

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
Get over it or don't

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
I mean they had other things they announced

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
Regarding that stuff, so they have like

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
The arcade stuff

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
That's sort of like Virtual Console

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
But it's not Virtual Console

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
It's just arcade versions

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
I'm with you on that

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
That shit's a little weird

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
The arcade archive things

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
I mean, don't get me wrong

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
I love the original Mario Brothers

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
I think it's really underrated

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
As an arcade classic

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
Because it's something that's really, really fun

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
Two player mode

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
And remember that game is really old

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
The original Mario Brothers is a very, very old game

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
You know, the animals that come out of the pipes

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
And that was a lot of fun

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
With two people, because that was one of the first games

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
That I really remember from the back of the day

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
Where you could really screw your friends

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
Like playing that game, right?

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
They could be running to get a crab

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
And you knock the floor to make the crab awake again

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
And kill your friend

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
I remember that game is great

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
And I think a really good addition

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
As much as we've seen that game

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
A lot from Nintendo over the years

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
Because every time they did a

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
Super Mario Brothers Advance

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
Or whatever that series

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
That game was included one way or another

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
But I think it's a good thing to kind of have on the Switch

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
However, where things kind of

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
Start to get weird with that

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
Was when they start talking about the whole

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
Yeah, like Super Mario Brothers versus

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
Which, okay, for those that don't know

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
When they had that Pay Choice 10

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
Which was like the Nintendo in the arcade

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
With games already loaded onto it

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
A lot of times

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
You would have

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
Versus Super Mario Brothers

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
Or Versus Excitebike

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
I think was one of the other ones

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
And basically what it was, it was the same game

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
But it was harder

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
And I think with Versus Super Mario Brothers

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
I think, I want to say

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
It's more like the second quest

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
Of Mario Brothers

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
Where the turtles are all the beetle guys instead

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
And I feel like there's

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
Some things that are removed

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
To make some of the jumps harder

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
There's just very subtle changes in the game

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
On levels 2, I think might have been a thing

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
Somebody in chat might know the difference

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
Yeah, it is pretty minor

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
All things considered

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
So it is weird that that is coming

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
When we still don't know about the virtual console

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
Plans for just regular Super Mario Brothers

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
But then there was a lot of other games in that montage

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
They talked about Versus Pinball

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
Versus Clu Clu Land

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
I'm sorry, but that's really

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
Offloading the dump truck

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
Is that them trying to double dip

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
On that shit, so it's basically

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
They're trying to release this shit now

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
It's not exactly the NES stuff

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
But you may just buy it because you're tired of waiting

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
And then they announce this new paid service

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
And then you're like, okay we'll do that too

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
And they get you twice

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
Yes and no

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
The double dipping thing wouldn't surprise me at all

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
But if it's true

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
That you're going to be paying

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
For this Nintendo online

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
And with it you will get certain games

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
Like free or whatever

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
I would imagine that Super Mario Brothers

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
Will be one of those games

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
And so you're not going to have to double dip so to speak

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
Because one of them you'll pay for with this arcade archives

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
The other one will be included

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
With your soul

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
With Nintendo's online thing

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
So that's my thought

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
But I don't know

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
Yeah, I mean

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
I'll probably buy Mario Brothers

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
It depends on the price

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
If they want way too much money for it then I won't

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
But I'll probably buy the Mario Brothers

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
And the Versus Super Mario Brothers

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
Stuff like Versus Clu Clu Land

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
That shit's a stretch

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
Was it Versus Pinball?

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
Nintendo Pinball

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
There was better

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
There was better Pinball on the NES

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
Than Nintendo Pinball

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
Nintendo Pinball was an early title

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
But it was before Pinbot

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
And Roller Ball

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
What were the other big Pinball games on Nintendo?

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
There's another one I'm trying to think of

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
Pinball Quest

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
That game wasn't actually good

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
It was just a good idea

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
They just need to seriously at this point

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
Just mark that shit

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
I mean they've made their money back

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
A ton like

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
Many dozens

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
Hundreds of times over already

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
Just drop that shit

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
Down to where it's like impulsive

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
Bundling by that's just like

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
Oh shit you know that's like 99 cents

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
You'd sell like a ton of that shit

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
Even stuff that's like garbage

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
Like NES Pinball

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
Paying 5 fucking dollars for that shit

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
I bought Balloon Fight for 30 cents on Wii U

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
Exactly that's a price

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
That would be worth it

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
I would buy it and you know it may not be

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
Something I'm interested in but I'd buy it because

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
It ain't 30 cents

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
I still have Animal Crossing for GameCube

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
Exactly that is the fucking Nintendo

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
I liked where it's like hey

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
Enjoy our classic games

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
Hey guess what you purchase that game

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
The Game Boy Advance version of this Metroid game

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
You can link it up or you know

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
Game Boy Advance some version of

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
You know Metroid or something

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
You can hook up your

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
Game Boy Advance and you can

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
Play the original Metroid on or something

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
That is how you do it

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
You've made your money back on those

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Stop trying to pretend they're still worth

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
5 dollars

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
They're fucking old I get it

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
People still like them

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
But you cannot say that

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
This game is still worth 5 fucking dollars

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
Again

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
Like after I bought it dozens of times

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
Alright one other thing

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
I want to say about the Nintendo Direct

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
That I think will be worth 60 dollars

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
Xenoblade Chronicles 2

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
I just want to make sure I get that out there

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
I really enjoyed what I saw from that game

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
And I look forward to playing it on the Switch

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
That is true

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
But their presentation was

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
Fucking boring

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
That was the most boring fucking

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
Presentation

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
I got what I needed out of it

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
I was fine I don't always need somebody

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
That's like super hyped up

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
It's just like the explaining like

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
Just the gameplay

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
Explaining it

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
How would you have explained it Loki?

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
Show me a fucking trailer done

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
Not just sit there explaining

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
Here's some fucking fire and there's robots and bang

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
Just show an extended trailer

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
Instead of fucking explaining about

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
This system you do this and this system

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
This happens and you have these classes

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
And blah blah blah

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
That's fucking boring

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
Next month before the holiday but I guess

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
What would be the point?

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
There's nothing really left to explain

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
They've detailed all their holiday releases

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
I would have liked little treats here

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
Mario Odyssey amiibo announcements which they did by the way

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
Announced more amiibos for that shit

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
Big surprise

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
I think they're gonna wait till January to just talk about next year at this point

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
I think that's probably

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
Probably it

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
Alright

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
Anyway

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
That's pretty much all we're gonna say about Nintendo Direct

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
What are your gaming weeks?

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
The types of video games we have been playing this week

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
What have you been playing this week?

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
I downloaded Ragnarok

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
Online for Steam

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
I started playing Ragnarok Online again

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
Did it go free to play?

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
Wow

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
Talk about blast from the past

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
Is anyone moderating the game?

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
I'm sure there's mods

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
They changed the whole

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
Introductory level

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
It kinda is crappy

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
I might go back and find another free server

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
That does the old style RO

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
I don't know

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
But that whole thing started

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
Because thanks to Tiara

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
I downloaded this game called

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
Idle Pouring on my iPhone

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
Which is basically

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
You're just running the whole time

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
Killing things

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
Then you level while it's idle

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
And then you can do the daily quests and PvP

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
It's a fucking clicker game?

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
That's the first one that finally drew me in

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
Good job

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
Rama in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
Wasn't Ragnarok Online free to play

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
For years on Steam?

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
News to me

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
I didn't even care to look before this

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
I haven't exactly followed Ragnarok Online

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
I played RO2 on Steam before I played it

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
I still have that picture of

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
Both of our characters

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
And you with your little mage with the ribbon in his hair

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
That was great

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
MXC wants to know the name of this again

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
Idle Pouring

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
P O R I N G

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
Ideally?

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
Not like American Idol

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
It's pretty fun

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
I've been enjoying it

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
Can we not?

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
It is

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
And can we not?

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
I also got Hive Swap

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
Which is the homestuck game

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
That we've been fucking waiting for

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
It was really good

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
It was pretty short but it's just the first episode

31:36.000 --> 31:42.000
And it's all point and click goodness with cutscenes

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
And it has everything

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
A point and click game fan

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
Would want plus homestuck

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
And

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
I spent the whole first part

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
Analyzing every scene

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
You can look at the pictures

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
In everyone's houses slash their hives

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
Because trolls live in hives

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
And you can

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
There's certain

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
There's certain

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
Places that indicate where this fits in continuity

32:08.000 --> 32:14.000
And although I did then go back and like completely reread almost the entire homestuck wiki

32:14.000 --> 32:18.000
Just to make sure that I had my head straight as to what universe this was

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
Because there are many universes

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
So

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
It was really good

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
I'm gonna play it again

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
Alright

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
And of course Pokemon Go

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
Miitomo

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
The usual

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
Blah

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
Alright then Loki

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
How was your gaming week?

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
I didn't play a whole ton of stuff

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
I finished the Lego movie video game

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
On PC

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
Because

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
I don't know

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
I like that movie

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
The game's alright

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
And then now I'm just kind of doing the 100% stuff

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
It's just kind of

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
I don't know it's a mindless game

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
Just some mobile clicker stuff

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
I'm kind of getting out of it

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
But I did play that this week

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
It's still the office space one

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
I don't know, that's it

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
I didn't really play any console stuff, thought about it

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
Just haven't gotten around to it

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
I need to play VR

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
I purchased a while back

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
I think she's a while back now

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
Superhot VR and I do want to try that

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
Oh I saw that game

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
I didn't really play it myself

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
But I saw it at Dragon Con because Bobby brought it

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
And one of his buddies was playing it

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
It looked neat, I like the whole concept of

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
Things only move when you're actually moving

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
I thought that was kind of neat

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
This is what it would be like to be in the matrix

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
What's great about those

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
After you do play that

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
Because you can play it very slowly

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
You can play it back at full speed when you're done

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
Like an instant replay

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
So it's like fucking John Woo shit

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
You're tossing the guns up in the air

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
That's rad, I like that

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
What's great though is I've seen some play throughs online

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
And there's different scenes

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
That kind of teleport you to different areas

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
So if you've played it enough and you know where those are

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
You can throw your guns to yourself

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
In the next area, which is great

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
So you'll throw an Uzi into the air

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
And you hop to the next scene

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
And catch it and then just shoot the guy in the face

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
It's just awesome

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
All the different options there

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
So yeah, I'm gonna

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
Probably have to check that out

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
Once again, I'm getting them in the Lego

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
Stuff they like watching Ninjago

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
Which I thought when I first saw that

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
It looked stupid, but the Ninjago movie

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
Is coming out and with that they have a game

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
So maybe I'll pick that up

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
If they have the Lego Marvel 2 then I'll be

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
Picking up later

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
I don't know, it's been Lego

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
Obsessive in my household

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
Lately, mainly which is me

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
Alright, my gaming week

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
After last week's show I played

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
Some Mighty No. 9 live on stream

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
So I got out a lot of my thoughts

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
During the stream

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
I liked it more than I thought I would

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
I think in the Mega Man

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
Wars

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
Or whatever you want to call it on Steam right now

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
I think I preferred 20XDX overall

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
But I did really like

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
Mighty No. 9 enough

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
It was hard

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
The first time I played through I was getting killed a lot

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
And I was getting really frustrated

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
Because I had to go all the way back

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
But then when I really was thinking about it

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
I was like this was part of what the original

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
Mega Man games were all about

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
You have to memorize patterns

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
And even the people that were watching were noticing

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
The second time I went through this level

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
I did way better and I beat it

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
Because this time I knew exactly what to expect

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
And it was completely different that time

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
I don't know

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
The game lacks a certain polish

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
I think in a way

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
It was fine enough

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
I can understand where

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
Fans get a little frustrated

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
The internet in general kind of shits on that game

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
A little more than it deserves

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
I suppose the whole Kickstarter element puts it in a unique category

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
But it's well enough

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
And that game you can catch it on sale

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
Here and there and everywhere

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
So if you find it

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
At a price that you're willing to pay for it

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
Then go for it!

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
Other games that I played this week

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
I played

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
With my new 3DS

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
I finally

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
Was convinced to buy a new 3DS

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
And you know what convinced me to finally buy a new 3DS?

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
All they had to do

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
Was to put Samus on it

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
That's exactly what they did

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
And as soon as they put Samus on it

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
I bought it

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
So I bought that new 3DS with Samus

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
So I had to do a transfer

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
And I learned some things doing a transfer

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
So I had the Link Between Worlds

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
DS before

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
So I had a 32GB

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
SD memory card in that thing

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
But unfortunately it's not as easy

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
As putting your 32GB

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
SD card into your

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
New 3DS

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
Why? Because the new 3DS

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
Takes micro

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
SD cards

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
So I had to buy a 32GB micro

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
SD card

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
Those are like 10 bucks now you can get those dirt cheap

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
I got one on Amazon Now

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
Because I was like I don't want to leave the house

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
It's Friday, Amazon Now fucking delivered one here in two hours

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
Like that

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
That's the pinnacle of laziness

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
I was like

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
I'm not putting pants on god dammit

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
That's pretty sweet

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
So anyway

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
So there was that

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
So finally that gets delivered

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
I'm like okay well I'll do this transfer

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
Now yes before I get the emails and the chat comments

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
I'm aware you can do a PC transfer

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
You can do a PC based transfer

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
And in retrospect that is exactly what I should have done

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
I should have also ordered an SD

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
Card reader via USB

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
Because my computer doesn't have one anymore

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
My new one doesn't

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
I should have ordered one of those damn card readers

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
And did it that way

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
Because I did it DS to DS

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
The transfer, it took

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
I started it at 7 PM

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
Do you know when the transfer finished finally?

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
4 AM

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
Is when the transfer finished

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
Now in retrospect I would have

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
Purged, well for one

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
I know that 32GB card was not full

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
Like it's probably not even a quarter full

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
Do I have a lot of shit on my 3DS?

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
Yes, but you can fit a lot in 32GB

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
Of DS software

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
In retrospect

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
I would have deleted

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
Every single demo off of my old

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
3DS before I started the transfer

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
Now see since space was never a concern

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
I never really deleted the demos

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
They were just kind of sitting there

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
But I should have got rid of them

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
The DS thing warned me that it would take 4 hours

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
To do the transfer, it took 9

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
Okay so it finally finished at 4 AM

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
So

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
I was a little frustrated by that

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
But finally, whatever, it was done

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
Over

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
And then finally I got to sit down and play

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
Metroid Samus Returns

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
On my new Samus 3DS

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
And it's great

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
I'm so happy Nintendo

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
Just in time for Loki's birthday

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
And to celebrate episode 700 of our program

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
Decided to release a new Metroid game

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
The way Metroid ought to be

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
2D

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
But with 3D flair in it

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
And as I mentioned earlier

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
The 3D in this game works very well

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
It's not a 3D Metroid

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
It's a 2D Metroid

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
But the 3D elements work very well

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
I realized they outsource the development of this game

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
To a company in Spain

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
And I don't remember the name of it right now

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
Do you remember the name?

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
Somebody in chat will yell it out here in a minute

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
But they did a good job

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
My understanding is that they had some Castlevania titles

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
Previously that were kind of it

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
Which goes to show you

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
I mean we saw this with Retro Studios

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
Even before

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
I don't know if they were

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
I would assume that they were independent from Nintendo

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
Before they kind of brought on as a second party

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
But

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
Other companies can develop your properties

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
For you and do a great job on it

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
Thank you Act F, Mercury Steam

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
That's the name of it

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
Can we get the people that did Blaster Master Zero

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
To do a new Metroid game?

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
Hello? That would be fucking awesome

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
I would trust those guys

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
Yeah well that's who I want

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
That's at the top of my wish list for a new Guardian Legend game

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
Actually it would be those guys, Inti Creates

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
I think this is the name of them

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
They're at the top of my list for a Guardian Legend

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
Reimagining right now

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
They don't need to do Metroid because Mercury

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
This Mercury Steam just did a fucking

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
Phenomenal job with it so

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
They get to make all the Metroids now

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
As far as I'm concerned

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
And I think with the critical reception this game is getting

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
I think it's very likely

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
These guys are going to get to make more games

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
And maybe those that were hoping this

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
Would be on the Switch

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
Maybe you'll get your wish of a

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
Metroid game by these guys on the Switch

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
If you didn't know this game

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
Metroid Samus Returns, it's a reimagining

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
Of Metroid Part 2

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
Or what do they call it, Metroid 2 Return of Samus

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
Was the Game Boy name

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
It takes some of the plot elements

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
Like the fact that there are 40 Metroids

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
On the planet you have to kill

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
As you kill more Metroids

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
More parts of the planet become accessible

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
They've kind of done their own thing with it

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
Because for one

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
That tiny little Game Boy screen

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
Is now a widescreen

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
And so that means, you know, right off the bat

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
More stuff is viewable

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
So that kind of changes a lot of things right there

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
Excuse me, and they've done things like

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
You can aim the gun up and down

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
Kind of like in Super Metroid

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
You can aim the gun up and down

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
But it's free, because the circle pad

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
As you hold L, it's free range

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
But it actually works really well because

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
When you're about to connect with an enemy

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
The yellow beam turns red

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
So you know when you're lined up correctly

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
And then they have this whole melee thing

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
Where when an enemy is about to attack you

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
You can hit the X button

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
And you do like a Falcon Punch type of thing

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
And you kind of knock it

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
Yeah, you do like a counter and it knocks the enemy on its ass

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
And then your gun immediately targets it

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
You don't have to sit there and retarget it

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
Your gun immediately targets it

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
So you can start blasting it

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
Which is a pretty cool effect when it's done

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
I'm not sure how I feel about it

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
It is very, it does kind of disrupt

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
The usual Metroid flow that I know

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
But I'm getting used to it

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
It's growing on me the more I play the game

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
It was just a little weird to use it in some of those

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
Early Metroid encounters

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
But yeah, I mean

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
Honestly, that's a very small kind of hesitation

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
And what otherwise I think is a pretty

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
It's a pretty fantastic Metroid game

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
Like anybody that was worried

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
After Other M and all this stuff

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
Like, you don't need to worry

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
This is a worthy successor to

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
Metroid Zero Mission

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
Which would have really been, I guess, the last 2D Metroid game

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
If you don't count Other M

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
Because Other M was kind of 3D

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
Kind of not

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
So if you just kind of throw that one away

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
This is really the next 2D game that they've had

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
And it's great, I recommend it

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
If you're a Metroid fan and you have a 3DS

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
You need to check it out

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
There you go

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
Some comments in our chat over at

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
live.vognetwork.com

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
Metroid is so fucking good

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
Kaijuto says the new 3DS is flawless

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
I will point out, look

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
I was not convinced to upgrade to a new 3DS

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
For the longest time

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
But now that I've done it

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
I do like that head tracking for the 3D an awful lot

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
Like it really does work very well

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
And being able to kind of keep the 3D

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
Whereas like if you have an old 3DS

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
And you kind of look to the side just a little too much

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
Like the 3D completely breaks up

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
It doesn't happen on the new 3DS

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
So that alone is a pretty neat feature

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
I've thrown out my perfectly capable old 3DS

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
Paid $200 for a new one for

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
Not until they put Samus on it

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
Let's see

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
Tigerclaw in chat says

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
With Metroid Samus Returns

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
Do you think Nintendo will remake

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
Super Metroid? I think they should

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
They can make it better

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
How do you perfect perfection

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
Tigerclaw? That's my only concern

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
Like Metroid 2

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
Was a decent Metroid game

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
But I think Metroid 2

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
Was kind of always limited by its hardware

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
The old school Game Boy

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
In retrospect

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
Was kind of like it wasn't the greatest

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
Hardware in the world right

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
It was groundbreaking at the time

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
Because it was portable games and it was done well

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
But it wasn't the hardware really limited

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
What you could do on that thing right

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
So I can see why

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
They kind of went back and redid Metroid 2

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
Does Super Metroid need a remake?

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
No

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
I think

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
I think we can explore a new Metroid

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
Title and that would be just fine

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
But they've changed enough

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
With this that it doesn't feel like a rehash

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
Of Metroid 2 but then again

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
I never did get around to playing that AM2R

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
I would be very curious

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
What people who played it Oh god it was so good though

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
Now see I would be very curious

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
What your take is on

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
This new Metroid game

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
The AM2R developers have been very kind

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
To it and they want to see it do well

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
Which is good

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
That they're not being bitter betties

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
About the cease and desist and all that

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
I'll have to play it

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
I mean I've got the game I just haven't played it yet

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
Cool that'll be good

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
Let's see going to some other comments in our chat

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
Over at live.vognetwork.com

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
Let's see Tigerclaw says you perfect

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
Perfection by making it look better

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
Play better and add a ton of new features

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
Like what they did in Samus Returns

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
Again

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
I just don't know if it needs it

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
I guess if they want to put a fresh

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
Coat of paint on it

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
Like if they want to give it the Starcraft

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
HD thing to it

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
Where they redo the graphics but they don't

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
Fucking touch the game

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
Then I might be on board for it

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
But again I don't know

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
I don't know

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
I would have some hesitation

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
I would like to see Mercury Steam just be able to do

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
Their own Metroid game now

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
Like whatever they want to do with it

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
They've proven themselves with this game

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
Let them do whatever they want to do

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
Obviously Nintendo can still oversee it

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
And thumbs up or thumbs down whatever they want

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
But that's what I would do

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
In that case

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
Anyway I've talked enough about that game

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
But obviously as a long time Metroid fan

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
I've been very excited about that game's release

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
So we're going to get into some gaming news

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
But first some quick announcements

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
Again thanks you guys for tuning in for

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
700 episodes whether this is your first episode

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
Or your 700th

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
Thanks for being a part of our family here Sunday nights

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
At the Boise Geeks Network

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
You can also follow us on Facebook

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
No shows off

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
That I'm aware of in the foreseeable future

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
Although I'm looking to maybe

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
Do a trip with the long weekend

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
Coming up for Veterans Day

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
But something like

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
It's going to be something like L.A. or something

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
It's not going to be something I have to get on a plane for

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
I might go to L.A. that weekend

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
Because I have some friends in L.A. I haven't seen in a while

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
That's kind of what I'm leaning towards right now

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
Maybe that's what I'll do Veterans Day weekend

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
So I may not be back in time for the show that Sunday

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
But that's not until November

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
So in the meantime though we'll see you every Sunday night

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
Let's get into some gaming news

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
Loki

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
So this is kind of funny

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
Recently

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
It had been discovered that

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
There was a NES

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
Emulator inside the Switch firmware

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
Which they were calling

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
Flog

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
And along with that though

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
They found that there's also a ROM in there as well

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
So golf for the NES

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
Is in there

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
Which is kind of weird though

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
Because they're saying

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
They're not sure if it's an accident

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
They're probably not

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
But they found that the emulator

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
I guess the emulator version

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
Works on this Flog emulator

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
And it even has

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
Joy-Con controller icons

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
So it's compatible

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
With this emulator

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
There's not really a way to launch the game

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
Though via a system menu

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
But it might be something that's in development

47:33.000 --> 47:36.000
Has anybody tried putting up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, start into their Switch

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
To see if this game pops up

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
No

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
Are there Nintendo codes out there?

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
Maybe that's the trick

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
Maybe there's a button code you have to push and you get this

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
Or maybe it's just

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
In there waiting to be unlocked

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
At some point when they unleash other

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
Virtual console type games

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
And I think the most exciting thing about this

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
Is the fact that they have

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
Gone back and they've

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
Changed the ROM

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
Essentially in a way to

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
Account for motion controls

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
Well here's the other thing too if you think about it

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
It's pointed out Flog

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
The name of the emulator is Golf Backwards

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
No shit Sherlock

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
So it's just kind of weird though

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
That I don't know

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
I don't know what this is

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
Golf is also one of those games

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
Where it's in the same bucket as like

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
Clu Clu Land and Pinball

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
And some of those things you were talking about earlier

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
I like Clu Clu Land

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
It's one of those games where it's like

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
If Loki gets upset about

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
Paying five bucks for Super Mario

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
Brothers he really is gonna

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
Get upset if Nintendo tries to charge five dollars

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
For golf which I think they actually did on the Wii U

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
But I digress

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
Golf is kind of like if Nintendo's gonna give one away

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
Golf's a safe one to give away

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
Well this is kind of weird too like here's some of the

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
They're talking about the controls so they're saying that

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
You know the controls are the

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
D-pad buttons

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
And the stick however motion

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
Control while holding the Z

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
L-R button is also supported

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
Instead of using the buttons so they're having

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
Motion control being

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
Added to NES games

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
But see you know what's

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
Exciting about that for me like as

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
Hokie as that might be although

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
Don't underestimate the power of that shit

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
I mean where as a lot of us like

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
For lack of a better term hardcore gamers

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
It's the power of love again

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
Okay look as much as some of us might

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
Roll our eyes at it I think there are some people

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
That are gonna think that's really cool

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
That you can go back to the old school games and you can

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
Control them a whole new way so don't

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
Don't underestimate little shit like that

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
But what is exciting

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
About that for me Loki

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
Is that they have gone back

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
And they have edited old games

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
To do new things

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
That's the very exciting part Loki

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
They have edited emulators to do new things

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
So is it possible

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
Big question mark

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
Is it possible

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
That these

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
The next wave of virtual console

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
Will not only have the online support

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
But maybe things like achievements

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
Leaderboards

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
Things that they've gone back

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
And they've updated these old ROMs to be able to do

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
Flog kind of shows

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
That Nintendo is going that

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
Direction of more than

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
Just a fucking straight up emulation

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
Of an old fucking game

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
Does that make sense?

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
We'll see

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
Yes JD in chat says

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
What was this about not getting your hopes up Rob

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
When it comes to Nintendo? You're right

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
I gotta keep that shit in check but

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
Still this is

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
It is a fact that this has been found

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
And that there is more to it

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
Than just a straight up emulation

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
So I don't think I'm getting my hopes too far up

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
In making that connection

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
Well if they're doing it for flog

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
Then maybe they're gonna do it for some other stuff too

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
Which by the way I should point out also JD

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
In chat says mmm flogging

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
Look

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
Folsom Street Fair if I remember right is next weekend

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
But I hope you all have a good one

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
For those that are checking that out

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
Let's see

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
Although today was the leather walk

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
There's

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
There's events every weekend for something

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
I need a better calendar

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
I attended

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
The election of Mr. Bolt Leather

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
For the year

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
And it was a very nice event

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
Good

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
Did you get to vote? I played pinball

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
Was the audience voted? No they had judges

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
But I played pinball

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
Alright

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
Rama in chat says you know there's a Folsom

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
Street Fair East

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
Where do they even do that?

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
Is that a P-Town thing?

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
Anyway

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
Oh it's in New York

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
Thank you I've

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
Clearly my calendar is not up to date

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
My invite got lost in the mail I suppose

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
Alright

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
Let's move on from flogging to Final Fantasy

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
And someday maybe those worlds

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
Will collide but for now

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
The world

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
Soon enough

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
Thanks to Final Fantasy 15 modding

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
Support

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
Ooh Gladio Leather Daddy

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
Ooh

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
Oh honey

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
Please this is Square Enix

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
Please be respectful of the characters

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
Don't do anything

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
Don't make the naughty mods

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
No naughty mods

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
We trust you

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
Oh god why do we trust you

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
Meanwhile have you seen the hairdresser?

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
I can't

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
I can't fucking wait for

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
Mods to be unleashed on Final Fantasy

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
15 it's like

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
Dark Sakura

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
Look years and years and years

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
Of having it always be the women

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
Being objectified in these games

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
And in the modding communities

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
And the titties hanging out and all this stuff

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
Years and years of that is finally

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
Gonna be rectified and caught up with

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
With Final Fantasy 15

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
Here I am playing Final Fantasy

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
Dongs everywhere

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
I'm fighting a giant dick with a dick

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
In my hand and I'm shaped like a dick

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
It comes from

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
11 with the man harness

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
You know what I mean

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
Oh yeah the armor

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
Yes Final Fantasy 11

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
And 14 were some of the first games

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
To be like slut

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
The men were just as slutty as the women

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
And what's his face who I hate?

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
I don't know

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
You ate everybody

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
No who had the logo?

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
Bobby Blackwolf?

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
No in Final Fantasy 14

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
I was gonna say was it the 11th?

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
Hildebrandt

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
The 11th sublegar

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
That's it

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
That's what I was trying to think of the name

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
Let's see

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
Rama in chat says Rob Roberts starring

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
In Leather Dream Daddy

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
Did you see my cosplay for DragonCon?

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
Did you just catch that?

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
I got recognized by two people

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
JD in chat says

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
Final Fantasy 15 Conan Exiles

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
Version, anything's possible

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
Anyway all that talk aside

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
Here's the thing

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
The Legend of Zelda

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
Breath of the Wild has clearly had

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
An influence upon the Final Fantasy

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
Team in a quote from

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
Director Hajime Tabata the director

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
Of Final Fantasy 15 he's talking about

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
Zelda saying quote I've heard a lot

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
From the dev team and their reactions to having

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
Played Zelda but just from hearing

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
The stories and the feedback you know

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
We can tell that it's a really complete game

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
It's very polished almost a perfect game

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
In that regard and our goals

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
Are probably to take that experience

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
That players felt with Breath of the Wild

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
But with our own technology and our own

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
Know how we have in our disposal

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
To create a very very high

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
Quality game with a strong visual

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
Element to it while creating a world

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
That's really immersive and really beautiful

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
That's probably our goals in terms of

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
What we want to be with our next project

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
It was kind of interesting hearing about

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
The influence of you know Zelda

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
Breath of the Wild and what it kind of you know did for

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
That series and now we're hearing that other

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
Developers are getting influenced by it but man

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
You know I know it's a little early

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
To talk about Final Fantasy 16

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
But my assumption is that

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
Is something that has to happen eventually right

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
We have to talk about Final Fantasy 16

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
Eventually right

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
If not now then maybe the next E3

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
I mean maybe

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
Square is still kind of on the hook to like

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
Actually release the Final Fantasy 7

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
Remake first before we can really talk about

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
16 but here's my thing is that

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
And I think I've talked about this a little bit

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
Before but if you want to talk about like the open world

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
Expansiveness Final Fantasy 15

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
Kind of did that

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
In parts you know right

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
We all know that one of the chapters

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
Can go on forever because you just do

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
Side quests after side quests

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
Final Fantasy kind of had that 15 to an extent

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
Can you imagine

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
A game in Final Fantasy 15's engine

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
But

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
All the characters

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
All the land

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
All the story and all the universe

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
Is like Final Fantasy 9

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
But in Final Fantasy 15's engine

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
Like how fucking rad would that be

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
And the reason why I specifically call out 9

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
Is because 9 was kind of that call back

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
To the classic Final Fantasy era right

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
Like you know 7 and 8

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
Were kind of the more like

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
There were modern settings they were different

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
8 not as much but it was just very different

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
It didn't look like you know the classic Final Fantasy games

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
But characters like Vivi and stuff

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
In Final Fantasy 9 really kind of gave it

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
That classic Final Fantasy look so imagine

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
That in Final Fantasy 15's engine

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
And then it's like open and immersive

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
And not like

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
Necessarily as tunnel visioned as the old

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
Final Fantasy games because if you think about it

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
The original Final Fantasy like

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
And a lot of the even later

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
Final Fantasy's they're very fucking tunnel visioned

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
Aren't they like you know

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
You need the canoe to get to the river

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
And then you need the airship to cross the mountains

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
Like it is very

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
It's great it's still a great game but it was

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
Kind of you know tunnel vision

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
So I think it would be just awesome to see

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
Something like that in like a very

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
Open world you know quest

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
Type setting like Final Fantasy 15

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
Maybe that's part of the reason

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
I like 14 so much

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
Because even though it's online

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
It does feel a lot of that

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
It's a really good start in that direction anyway

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
Something you want to say with that Logie?

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
I'd rather just remake 6

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
I guess

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
I guess but remakes have to

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
You know go on the back burner at some point

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
They're already remaking 7 whether we like it

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
Or not I don't know is

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
Dark Sakura before we get to your story

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
With the Final Fantasy 7 remake

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
Are you apprehensive

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
About it or are you looking forward to

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
Killing Aerith in HD

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
Over and over again

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
Oh that bitch is dead

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
I'm gonna omni slash her

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
What if they

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
What would you do if in the remake they

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
Changed it so that you could bring her back to life

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
That bitch ain't getting my

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
You know resurrection

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
Phoenix down not for you

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
Phoenix up

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
No I know it's referring

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
To the down on the feathers

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
I know I know

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
Phoenix up is still funny

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
That's a good name for a band and rock band

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
Phoenix up

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
You don't get Phoenix down

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
You get Reaper down

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
Or as Bobby Blackwolf in our chat says

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
Phoenix up yours Aerith

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
I just don't like her

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
You don't say

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
After 700 episodes of this show

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
I haven't fucking figured that out

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
She's a man stealing hoe bag

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
Dungeon Buster in chat says

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
Forget Aerith I want a fantasy star classic

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
Revival with the return of Nae

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
Actually

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
How about since we didn't get

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
Since we didn't get into this with the Nintendo Direct

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
Now that you've opened that Pandora's box

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
Dungeon Buster

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
Here's the thing

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
Where the fuck is

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
Fantasy Star Online 2 in the US?

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
Did you know that during

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
Japan's Nintendo Direct

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
This week they got the announcement

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
The Fantasy Star Online 2 cloud

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
Or whatever is coming to the Switch

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
So they get Fantasy Star Online on their TV and on the go

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
You know what we've got with Fantasy Star Online?

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
Jack shit

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
What is Sega's

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
Fucking problem with this game?

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
Not wanting to release it in the US

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
What's your damage Sega?

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
What did we do to you?

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
Release

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
PSO 2

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
In the US

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
I should re-download that and re-patch it

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
It was fun

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
Before y'all get started on

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
Yes there's a patch

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
It would be nice to get some

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
Fucking official recognition from Sega

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
That there are PSO fans that want

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
To play this game here

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
Yes I understand the Switch

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
Is region free but that doesn't mean the servers

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
Are gonna be region free

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
Is having Sega

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
Give us a hug

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
Too much to ask

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
Apparently it is

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
Anyway

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
I'm sorry

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
I got disrupted by a chat

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
Comment there that got me wound up on a Loki rant

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
How about you Dark Soccer do you have something

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
Positive to share with us in the news

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Tonight?

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Positively

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
So we had talked about this a couple of times

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
In the past but

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
This is actually coming from

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
CPN coverage

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Which is pretty

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Sorry CBS

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
CBS coverage I was thinking news and then the end

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Came out

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
But they were having some coverage

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
About more colleges now

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Are rolling out scholarships

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
For varsity video game players

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Several schools now

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
It looks like have their own

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Esports team

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
And I think it was

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
I'm trying to find it in here because it listed

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
What school it was

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
One of the UC's just built an Esports arena

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
UC Irvine

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Did it

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
And that now

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
More and more schools are opening up

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Their own

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Esports teams

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Like multiple teams per school

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
And that actually

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
It has

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
It's almost now

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Surpassed

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Sports like physical sports

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Activity in schools and they're offering

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
More and more scholarships to that

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
So

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
And people are like yeah it

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Rebuilds a sense of community

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
And it's especially good for people who maybe

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Can't get into the physicality of

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
You know like football or

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Baseball or something like that

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
So I think it's pretty neat

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
All those people who made fun of us

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
For being nerds

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Now people are going to college

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
For being nerds

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
You kids today

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
You don't know how easy you have it

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
You get a full scholarship for college

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Because you're good at a video game

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Back in my day that got you canned

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
I would have killed for that

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
What video game would you have gone

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
To college on a scholarship for at our sakura

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
What video game would have gotten you a full

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Scholarship

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Guardian legend at the time

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
No I'm serious I was really good at it

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
It makes me laugh though just imagining

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
The guardian legend is an esport

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
But it deserves it

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Well I mean the era that I was going into college

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Though it was Super Nintendo era

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
When I was first going into school so

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
I think that at that point

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
It would have been like Kirby's

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Avalanche

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
I was really good at Puyo Puyo

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Really good at Puyo Puyo

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
Not as good as I was

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Loki what about you

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
You would have gone to college a full scholarship

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
On what game?

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
Well if we were talking college it would have been Mario Kart 64

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Maybe

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Damn you because you stole my answer

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
Well you sort of stole my answer

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
My answer was going to be Super Mario Kart

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
On the Super Nintendo because in the college dorms

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
The Playstation and the

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
N64 had just come out

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
But college kids couldn't really afford it

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
So I still had the last gen of games

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
So the guys used to come over

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
And we would play Super Mario Kart

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
And it got brutal

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
With that game

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
But I always fucking won

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
I'm not as good now

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
As I used to be

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
I'm sure my recent streams are evidence of that

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
With the new fangled Mario games

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
But there's always that

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Alright but Mario Kart 64

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
For you Loki

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
I guess I don't know

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat was in a similar place

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
I got it in 64

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Pretty early and my dorm was the Mario Kart 64 dorm

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
People came into my room

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Just to play four player battle mode

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Actually it wasn't me

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
That got the Nintendo 64 first

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
It was the guys right upstairs

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
If we're talking like it's not technically a video game

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
But the best game

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Or the game that I was the best at

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
At that time would have been

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Q's are laser tag

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Oh that would have been your scholarship

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Right there with Q's are

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
I've been awesome

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Anyway and I don't know if your

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
I don't know if your college

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
Was anything like mine Bobby

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
But those guys upstairs that used to play Mario Kart

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
They used to get so

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
Fucking high before they would play Mario Kart

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Like it was

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
That room was just like a giant fucking cloud

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
And then

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Mario Kart 64

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Something about the colors I'm sure

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Now when I was actually in college though

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
Totally World Cup Soccer 94 pinball

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Which is why I

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
I own one now

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
The other game that we played in the dorms all the time

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Was since we all had our own phone lines

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
I know I've told this story on OLR

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Since we all had our own phone lines in those little rooms

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
We used to

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
And it was still dial up back then

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
The high speed hadn't hit the dorms yet

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
So we were still doing dial up

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
So we would dial into the college internet

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
And we would play Duke Nukem 3D

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Over the phones

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
That was my first LAN game

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
On Friday nights we would leave our doors open

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
And we would be playing Duke Nukem 3D

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Over the phone basically

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
It was good times

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Did you ever do the voice macros?

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Where you could hit it and go

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
I came here to kick ass and chew bubble gum

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
And I'm all out of gum

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
My face was your face, your ass

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
What's the difference?

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
I remember all that stuff

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Good times

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Anyhow

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
So let's move on, Loki what do you have for us?

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Maybe another game that kids can go to college on

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Yes it's the new game

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Well it's not so much the game of the week anymore

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
But it's a popular game

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Or one of the popular games

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Player Unknown's Battlegrounds is now the most

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Played game on steam

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Of all time

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
That's right it's hit the record

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Of um

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
1.349

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Million players

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
That's it's peak

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Previous record which of course

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
And Dota 2

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
That was March of last year

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
They were 1.291

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
So not bad

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
And of course also

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
Across the 15 million concurrent

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Steam users

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Or steam had just crossed that

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
The other thing of course they're doing with it

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
They're tweaking

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
It is kind of becoming a problem

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
In the game with people idle farming

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
So like in

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
Counter Strike Go

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
You can

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Get different items

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
In the game, loot boxes

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Or whatever and you can sell those items on the steam marketplace

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
To make money

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
And so people were just going idle

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
In the game because they would still earn the currency

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
In the game to

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
You know be able to

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Oh no you should get kicked out if you're inactive

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
So now they've got more things

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
In place to basically check to see

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
If they're just sitting there

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
It's going to be harder for people to do that

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
So that is something

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
That they're working on as well

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Stoppy in chat says

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
It's crazy the guy who made the game is the black sheep of his family

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Now he's set for life and taking care of his parents

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
Amazing success story

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
No good I mean good for him

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
You know it's hard to hate on somebody who's made a successful game

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Even if I don't really play it

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Well here's my question

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
Actually

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
And those of you that are familiar with this game

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
I would think this answer is pretty easy

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
But maybe it's not

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Are you able to just set up a game

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Where it's nobody

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
It's nothing but people you know

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
Like you can set up a friends only game

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
It's like 100 people are playing

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Yeah but can I play like a lower version

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Can I play like an 8 player version

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Where it's just people we know

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
I think right now because I'm on a laptop

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
And I don't really have like the keyboard mouse

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Set up like I can't do

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Mouse and keyboard basically

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
Because I'm just not used to that

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
I'm used to playing on a controller

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Well Xbox has got you covered

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
For the years up

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
But it's interesting

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Like I was watching there was an article

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
Kind of looking at some of the stuff today

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
About people are speed hacking in the game

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
And so running around really fast

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
Because they're saying you know right now

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
They're anti cheating systems

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
Not perfect but they're showing

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
Like one of the guys is like

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
He's a big CSGO player

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
And the guy's like speed hacking just running past him

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
He just takes him out

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
Just knocks him out

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
He's like I'm too good for this shit

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
So that was kind of fun

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
See MXC in chat says you can set up your own team

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
But I think that is still online against a mass of players

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
That's not really good enough for me

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
I would like to have a mode that's kind of more like private

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
So that I could just play with other people

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
Like me and my skill set

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
And other like vlog people

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
And twitter people and stuff like have our own

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
I think a lot of people aren't that great on it

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
I mean I don't think it's a lot of

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
There are some people that are good at it

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
There's a lot of factors that's kind of random too

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Because it depends on where you drop

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Where the center of everything

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
The arena is going to be

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Plus they have new maps now

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
So there's a lot of

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Random factors in there that may affect it

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Alright

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
I think I need to check this game out

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
How much is it? It's not a full 50

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
It's like 40 bucks I think

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
I think I need to check this game out

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
I do

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
I'm apprehensive because first person shooter

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Right yeah it's hard

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
Like coming into something like that

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
And even like Overwatch for me

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
It's kind of hard to like

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
You have to really be like doing this constantly

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
To be any good at it

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
But I don't know

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
I guess I'm a filthy casual now

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Let's see going to our chat

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
Bobby Blackwell says you're going to find PUBG modes

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
I keep wanting to say

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
PUBG modes

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
Even though I'm getting the letters reversed

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
You're going to find PUBG modes

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
In all the AAA games now

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
Fortnite has a PUBG mode already

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
GTA online already has something

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
It'll just be like

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
Horde mode in Gears of War

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
Like every game

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
Mass Effect got something like that

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
You know what you'd probably like actually

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
That's kind of similar

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
It's basically Hunger Games

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
The Hunger Game mod is in

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Minecraft

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
It's pretty low

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
You don't have to be a super expert player

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
It's literally

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Hacking people with pickaxes

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
There's not a whole lot of skill there

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
But that looks a lot of fun

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Every time I've seen people play that

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
I do play Overwatch

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
So it's not like I'm completely apprehensive

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
To first person games

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
The thing I'm really learning about Overwatch

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
As much as I like to play characters

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
Like Sombra and Pharah

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
Honestly, I just have the best luck

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
When I play Mercy

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
I don't want to say I'm good at Mercy

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
But I'm

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
I play Mercy well enough

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
Where I really feel like I'm pulling my weight

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
As opposed to certain other characters

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
What we really need is

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
We need an actual

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
Umm

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
What is it

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Umm

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
What the fuck

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
The movie that started it all

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
Not Hunger Games

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
Battle Royale

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
We need an actual Battle Royale game

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
We said that years ago

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
Fuck the Imitators, we need the actual Battle Royale game

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
Didn't we have a, Dark Tetsuya

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
Didn't we have a list list

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
Years ago

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
That was

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
What movie do we need to make a game out of

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
And tell me

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
Battle Royale wasn't in the top 3

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Had to have been

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
Had to have been

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
Maybe it's on the wiki somewhere

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
Everybody's trying to be Battle Royale

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
Battle Royale is just Battle Royale

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
S.H.O. 100 Matt says good thing Overwatch

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
Doesn't have commands like heal please

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Protect please, oh no

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
Oh no S.H.O. 100 Matt

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
It does

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
You can hit I need healing

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
Or I need armor

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Look

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
I fucking know you need healing

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
I'm playing a healer

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
Sometimes you're fucking hiding behind a wall

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
How am I supposed to fly to you if you're hiding behind the fucking wall

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
And the other thing that pisses me off

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
Is when I'm playing Torbjorn

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
I need armor

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
I will fucking throw you

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
All the fucking armors in the world

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
When I have enough scrap

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
But if you want to get mad at somebody

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
Get mad at the person that keeps

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
Picking it up off the ground when they don't really need it

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
I'll even try to like not

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Throw the armor in front of that person

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
But they still run over and get it

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
Unfortunately

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
Totally doesn't work in that game

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
Dark Tetsuya says

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
Episode 66

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
Movie that most needs a video game

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
Okay, this is the scientific list list

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
Process here on OLR

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
The official answer is from our list list

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
Number 3, Kill Bill

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
That was a good choice, that was a very good choice

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
Number 2, Clerks

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
Can't imagine how that would work

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
I don't know what we were thinking

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
At that time, but it's kind of funny

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
If it's based off the animated series that'd be fun

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
I think the animated series was still kind of

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
New in our minds at that time

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
And then number 1, Battle Royale

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
So sure enough

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
On episode 66, we said they should make

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
A game out of Battle Royale

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
So Pugbee guy needs to pay up

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
Hey, I still won the Paper Plate Battle Royale

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
Alright

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Let's move on

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
More stories for you guys here on episode number 700

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Let's talk about a new game

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
That's been announced for the Nintendo Switch

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
Although, I think this is actually a

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
I want to say it's like a

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
Re-updating or something

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
Of a Apple TV game

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
And of course the site I'm trying to pull this story from

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Is now not working, so I'm going to do this best for my memory

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
But Super Beat Sports

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
Is a harmonics game

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
And they have announced that that is going to be coming out on

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
The Nintendo Switch

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
This game was originally out for the Apple TV

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
But I don't think a ton of people

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
Are gaming on there

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
Some are, but just obviously the Apple TV

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Is not a gaming device

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
So I think their audience is limited

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
It's kind of cool, they have some pictures of their official site

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
SuperBeatsports.com

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
So you can play these different sports

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
It's harmonics, music, games

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
And now it's going to be on the Switch

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
Yeah, they've got like five mini games

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
So based on familiar sports they said like

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Tennis, hockey, golf, and volleyball

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
You play with up to three players

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
Or four players I guess

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Motion controls

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
They're saying, you know

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
Or non-motion controls

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
I don't know, neat

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
Looks like a little Wii Sports

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
Type of game

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
As I saw a bit of the game on their live stream

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
It looked neat, yeah, I know they were live streaming

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Some of it earlier this week, so that's pretty cool

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
So, alright

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
Alright, well let's move on

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
With some more news, DarkSakura

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
A computer gaming legend, right?

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
Oh yes

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
Why are you not playing the music? In my pants

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Not your pants

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
I didn't

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
Unless Carmen also

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
Is now you know

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Anyway

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
I need the music, Rob

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
It has to happen

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
But anyway

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
Was

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
An animated series in the past

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
And it was a fun

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
Game show

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
And

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
I think

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
Best theme song ever

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
Anyway, Netflix

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
This shit didn't exist from

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
I first played Carmen Sandiego on the

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
Apple 2E

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
This is what you babies

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
Got into in the 90's

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
No, no, no, Rob

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
It was all about where in time is Carmen

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
Sandiego

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
That was my jam

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
You know me, history nerd

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
As much as I love that theme as well

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
It's all about the chief

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
On the Carmen Sandiego

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
She didn't give no shit

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
Anyway

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
Netflix has said

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
Okay, you missed it, great

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
They've greenlit a new

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
Animated series with 20

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
22 minute episodes

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
That are coming out in 2019

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
So

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
Apparently

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
Gina Rodriguez is going to be Carmen

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
Sandiego and Finn

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
Wolfhard is going to be

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
Her accomplice named

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
Player

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
So even though this has to do with

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
A TV show

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
A cartoon, a Netflix revival

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
Maybe it will cause

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
A revival of the computer games

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
Because I think people forget that the game

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
Show came from computer games

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
Or maybe updating the computer games

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
That might have more modern

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
References to real countries

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
That exist

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
Kids today need to never be able to fucking find her

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
Sorry, Czechoslovakia doesn't exist anymore as a country

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
Oh, good point

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
The USSR doesn't exist

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
As a country

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
The world has changed

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
The world has changed

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
And then

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
Carmen is keeping herself alive through

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
Secret rituals

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
Involving the blood of every past gumshoe

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
That she's defeated

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
She's now a vampire

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
cannibal

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
That is being produced by

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
Houghton Mifflin Harcourt

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
Which is a name I haven't seen since I was like

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
In high school

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
Reading my schoolbooks

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
So, yay

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
Yay

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
Now we have to listen to the theme song the whole rest of the show

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
No, because I think there's

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
Copyrights that prevent that from happening

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
Anyway, by the way

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
Before we get to our next story, taking a step back

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
Real quick, Bobby Blackwolf decided

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
To jump in and look at the complete

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
Listless archive just because he was bored

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
And thinking about that segment

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
Are we really boring him that much? I think so

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
This is relevant, this is important

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
Bobby Blackwolf says we did a listless

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
In 2014 that was

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
What are we most looking forward to

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
At E3 2014

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
The number two answer

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
You ready for it? The number two answer that night?

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
Fantasy Star Online 2 on the Wii U

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
Here we are three years later

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
Let's go home, we're done

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
Sega can suck a fuck

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
Yes, I'm gonna use that phrase

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
Because I can't think of anything more appropriate

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
Than the anger I'm feeling at Sega

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
Sega, suck a fuck

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
And besides, I think we're owed some reparations

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
For the fucking Sonic the Hedgehog series

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
I mean

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
But they did kind of redeem themselves with Sonic Mania

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
And Sonic Generations was good

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
It's a start

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
Are we to forget all the other games that they made?

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
Rob, they can eat a sack of dicks

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
Zombie dicks

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
Real zombie dicks

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
Pulsating

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
With the occasional, you know, fly attached to it

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
She's

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
Flying around the world to steal zombie dicks

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
All the zombie dicks

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
Act Deft in chat

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
Act Deft in chat says

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
We need a new list list, how can Sega go

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
And fuck themselves for PSO

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
Moving on

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
Just a few more stories than the classic game

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
Of the week

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
Loki

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
So, it was very

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
Exciting to see that Journey

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
I mean, a totally different game

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
Not Journey, but totally Journey

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
Coming to Apple

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
TV, iPad, and iPhones

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
From that game company

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
It's called Sky

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
And it's like if you replace sand

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
With clouds in its journey

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
But it looks good

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
Well, we don't know until we play it

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
It's totally related

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
I would be really interested to try it out

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
On my Apple TV

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
What I played on my Apple TV to date

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
Is Sonic CD

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
With the right soundtrack, Bobby

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
The Japanese one

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
But, um

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
And it's episode 700

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
So you're gonna let her have her moment

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
And not cry tonight

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
Yeah

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
Anyway, so

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
It's creatures that look humanoid

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
But they're like floating

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
And kind of flying

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
And they have things that cause them

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
And there's

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
There's a big thing in the distance

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
It has a beam of light

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
It's fucking Journey

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
But whatever, it looks cool

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
I'll invest in it when it comes out

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
I can't wait to play it on my

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
Apple TV

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
I can't wait to play it on my $1000 iPhone

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
Because yes, the fuck I am buying

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
Across the room, high five

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
Yes, I am fucking buying that iPhone X

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
And you can miss me with that Android shit

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
10

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
I didn't watch the press conference, I just read all that

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
You can miss me with all that Android comparison shit, okay

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
My husband has an Android

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
So I get to see what's going on over there

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
We're a bi-phonal household

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
And that's the way we like it

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
And get that sweet new screen into my hands

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
Oh, girl

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
I was watching that keynote

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
And I'm like, yeah

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
I don't need to pay off

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
My student loan this year

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
Thank you, because Act F says buy phones

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
There it is

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
Alright, anyway

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
S2100 Matt says, but that's so much money

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
I don't know if that's said tongue in cheek

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
We so don't care

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
Well, isn't the Note 8 or whatever

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
One of those Android, it's $950

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
Something like that

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
I already put down

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
and priced what it's going to cost me for

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
the 256 gigabyte model

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
No, real talk for a minute

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
And I don't care if you're iPhone or Android

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
I really don't, it's your money

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
Spend it on whatever makes you happy

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
I'm going to let you know

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
Do whatever you want

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
Here's my thing, really, at the end of the day

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
When it comes to my phone

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
I'm at a point where

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
I wouldn't have thought this 15 years ago when OLR first started

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
I was using my shitty little flip phone

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
that had the little tiny

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
little 20 pixel big TV

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
It looked like a Dreamcast VMU

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
on the front that you'd use to take selfies

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
I can maybe play NES problems on this

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
Right?

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
So 15 years ago I would have never thought this about my phone

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
But the reality is, here we are living in this world

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
I use my phone more than anything else

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
Even my desktop PC

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
That's how much I use my phone

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
Especially with, you know, you guys know I do gaming

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
with Pokemon Go and Ingress and all that other stuff too

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
It's not even just that

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
I use my phone everywhere

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
So, honestly, I know

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
Yes, a thousand dollars is a lot of money

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
Of course it's a lot of money, but that's why

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
I haven't upgraded my phone in three years

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
So I've been saving money knowing that I'm probably

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
going to have to spend a lot of money to get a new phone

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
And it's like, I probably paid more than that

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
for my computer

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
Which in reality I use less

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
So

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
Anyway

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
Don't let anybody tell you how to spend your money

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
You want to go buy a new Android phone? Go you

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
That's awesome

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
You want to go buy an iPhone SE?

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
Because you don't need any of this new shit

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
You just want a fucking phone? Awesome!

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
Go you, get the phone that works for you

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
But don't tell other people what to do

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
Alright, moving on

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
Let's see, what do we have next?

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
Oh, oh, this is

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
This is not good, but I guess a learning

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
experience for everybody in this situation

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
So Destiny 2, which I

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
really, really want to play Destiny 2

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
But I'm waiting for the PC version

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
Because I just, I want my mouse and

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
keyboard support, so I'm waiting on

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
the PC version, so

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
But I'm hearing a lot of good things from the people

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
that are playing it on Playstation 4 and Xbox One

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
right now, but one of the not so good things

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
I'm hearing about is that

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
Oh, some armor snuck

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
its way into the game that was

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
Oh, it was kind of a reference to

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
white supremacy. Whoops

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
Somebody screwed up on that one

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
So, here's what, and a lot of people

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
wanted to know, how the fuck did this happen?

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Like, how did this get into the game?

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
And basically, it was one of those things where

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
Bungie wrote this explanation about how

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
they do draw from real world

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
art iconography and other

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
design elements, and what happened is that

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
I guess the original meme

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
kind of came to their attention. You know how sometimes

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
memes get repurposed by

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
other crowds for bad things?

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
Isn't that what kind of happened to the frog?

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
Anyway,

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
Yes, because the frog is actually, it's a

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
children's book. Yeah, okay, so

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
So what happened is that they found, I guess

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
the way I'm reading it from Bungie is

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
they found the meme, but their own

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
internal team did not realize that that had been

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
repurposed into this flag

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
that represented something completely different

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
So, you know, Bungie apologized

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
and basically promised to do better, and they are

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
working to, I guess they did some

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
recent maintenance where they've really kind of

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
they haven't been able to scrub it completely

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
from the game, but they've like

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
they've changed it enough so that you don't

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
really recognize what it was anymore

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
and soon it will be completely

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
scrubbed from the game. That is what they're

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
doing there, so

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
There you go!

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
Dungeonbuster in chat says, wow, I play Destiny 2

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
and I never heard about this. Well, my understanding

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
is that ninjas went in the middle of the night

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
during one of the maintenance periods and

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
got rid of this from the game

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
and that's what happened, so

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
Bungie says, sorry about that, and it

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
won't happen again, but it just, it also goes

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
to show that the internet is a huge place

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
and you gotta be careful sometimes because

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
you know, you may not know that something you're saying

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
Yeah, I mean, it's not like, it's not overt like

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
oh, it's a swastika or something like that

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
Yeah, it wasn't something obvious

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
It looks kind of sporty

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
like, it's like a sports

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
thing, I mean

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
I don't know, like a

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
bike tracksuit type thing

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
But now that we know what it is, it's not okay

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
just to be clear

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
Okay, just to be clear

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
Anyway, let's

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
get to a, go back to a time

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
and a place when games weren't so fucking

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
complicated

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
It's the classic game of the week, and Dark Soccer

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
is gonna step into the gaming vault tonight

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
and pick a game that she says, hey

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
brats

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
you should be checking out this game

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
We've been telling you for a while

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
Now Dark Soccer, you've actually

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
talked about a while, we started classic

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
game of the week in what, episode number 250?

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
Something like that

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
So this would be, if I can math correctly

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
this would be the 450th classic

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
game of the week, give or take

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
Not necessarily because of

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
Marathon show, some one-offs

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
And the classic console

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
Oh, I forgot about the consoles

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
Okay, so give or take the

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
450th classic something something of the

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
week, so the rules

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
of the classic game of the week that

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
was established some time ago is that a game

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
must be 10 years older or more

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
to be the classic game of the week

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
But Dark Soccer, before I

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
unveil tonight's classic game of the week and before

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
somebody in chat says, that

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
game didn't come out till November

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
so it's not 10 years

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
old Well fuck you, it's my segment, my

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
rules

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
So that is the official statement for Dark

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
Soccer, it's my house

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
And if you don't like it

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
And I believe that my intent was that if it

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
came out that year, and it wouldn't be

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
the first time I've done it because I have done something like a month

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
before

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
So precedent has been set

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
So take your opinion, shine

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
it up real nice

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
Turn it sideways and shove it up your candy

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
ass, to quote

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
Sir Rock

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
But look, you don't want to taint this game

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
with, you just know that people are gonna

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
say something to chat about it

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
So what is the classic game of the week?

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
It's Mass Effect, duh

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
Can you believe

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
it's been 10 years though? I can't

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
actually, that's crazy to me

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
Oh, but this theme

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
This theme is so fucking good

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
I know

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
It's sad because I just think about

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
the ending scene, well I won't get ahead

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
of myself, but anyway

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
I always would let this go until Garrosh showed up on

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
the screen and then I would start

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
You can't

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
start until your title screen has been blessed

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
by Garrosh. Garrosh is space husband

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
number two. Fair enough

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
You don't know who space husband number one is

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
in my fandom

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
in my head

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
Your own husband, Dan?

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
Dan's not from space

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
I'm talking about space husband. Technically this planet

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
is in space, therefore he's from space

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
Are you sure he didn't fall from space and hatch out of

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
an egg? No, because he's not orc

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
He's not aging

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
and he doesn't drink orange juice through his finger rub

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
Anyway

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
Mass Effect, yes it did

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
come out in November

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
2007, but fuck it

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
But it was probably gold in September

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
It was in beta

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
The critics had it, sure

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
It was

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
originally released for

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
Xbox 360 in

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
2007, and it

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
of course is the first. It was intended

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
from the start to be

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
a multiple

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
chapter series

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
So we knew there would be more

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
They left it open for more

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
But you assume the role of

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
Commander Shepard, who there's only

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
one Commander Shepard in my heart

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
Sorry Mark Meer, but Jennifer Hale forever

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
Who was modeled first?

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
True story

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
We had FemShep first

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
But basically it was

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
So FemShep existed in September

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
MaleShep did not

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
Or something like that

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
Anyway

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
It used the Unreal Engine

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
3 for its groundwork

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
and

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
basically it was just

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
built from the ground up

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
to be an awesome

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
piece of video game

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
gorgeousness

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
And of course now we've got wonderful high res mods

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
and people are still

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
I was talking to

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
Becky the other day and she just finished it again

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
So, good job

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
Anyway you play as

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
Commander Shepard

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
Who you decide everything about

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
her or him

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
That looks like within the reasons of the game

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
And then you bust out the mod manager

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
And you change all of it

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
And then

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
you can take all your different

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
specialties

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
You can do different classes

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
Either biotic or non-biotic

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
And then you travel across the galaxy

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
Chasing a

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
completely, obviously

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
looking

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
messed up

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
looking turian guy

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
Who, I mean

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
How can you look at him and go

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
Oh he's not completely taken over

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
by an

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
inorganic species? No

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
Not with his face looking like

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
that and the circuitry

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
peeking out of his body. No

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
Saren's not evil. Saren's a nice guy

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
He gives presents to small children

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
And, you know, raises

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
money for orphanages, I guess

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
Anyway

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
So you take the Normandy

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
all the way across

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
Spending the entire game thinking about how you're gonna

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
fuck that turian

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
Wow

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
No

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
You have your romance options

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
Which were just three people

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
really, if you were

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
a dude you could romance Ashley

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
or Liara

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
And if you were

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
FemShep, you could romance

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
Kaden or Liara

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
Sorry, I'm just picturing in my head

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
DarkSakura having a YouTube channel

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
Hey guys, welcome to my YouTube playthrough

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
of Mass Effect where I'm gonna fuck that

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
turian

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
Well, it's pretty much the theme of my Tumblr

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
Anyway

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
Um

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
You've got more options

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
in later games, thank God

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
Cause, it wasn't

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
very fair, I thought

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
You know, dudes should have been able to

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
strip Kaden

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
Sorry, right from the beginning

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
But no, you had to wait until the third game for that

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
Sorry guys

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
It was worth the payoff though, in the end

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
It was kind of sweet, even though I still think he's too nice

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
Oh my god, Liara

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
in the first game pissed me off so much

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
Because she's like

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
Oh, I'm 106 years old

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
But she's really, that's like

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
being 15

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
in Asari years

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
Oh god, I do not have time

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
for all of my rants

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
Anyway, real time battles, those are fun

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
You have

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
your health bar, you can keep your squad

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
members alive, you also have

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
a morality system

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
that

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
leads you more toward

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
the polite and selfless

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
versus aggressive and hostile

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
Which is now

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
It can be known as

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
Paragon or Renegade

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
Paragon being how to charm people

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
and Renegade being to intimidate them

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
But yes

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
I could go more and more

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
and more and more and more about the game

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
And

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
I wasn't really into it when it first

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
came out, it took me a while

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
Same, same

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
Well, wasn't I also the one that kind of told you

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
you had to play it, give it a second chance

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
I think I even said

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
you'd be into the Tumblr fandom

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
And then I heard Garrus' voice and it was

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
over

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
His voice actor

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
is a very handsome fellow

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
Kind of goofy, but

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
I saw the episode of Buffy he was in and it wasn't

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
a good episode, I'm sorry that such a

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
talented actor had to be in that episode

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
of Buffy, it was not good

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
Anyway

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
I really don't

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
know how much more

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
I can say about it

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
This since had

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
the first game had

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
more DLC, Bring Down the Sky

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
and then

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
what was it, when

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
Pinnacle Station, that one was

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
okay, I didn't care for it

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
because it had like all the

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
deathmatch and capture the flag stuff

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
that I don't think is fun

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
But the

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
game got really

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
great reviews across the board

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
For

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
For the Xbox 360 version

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
when it came out, Metacritic gave it a 91 out

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
of 100, so that's definitely not bad

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
But as far

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
as other

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
things, it won

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
for the year it came out, it won

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
Best RPG for the Spike Video Game

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
Awards, Teambox

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
Game Awards gave it Best Role Playing

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
Game of the Year, Best Story, Best Game of the Year

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
IGN, you know

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
it won across the board

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
on a lot of different

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
best of's

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
And of course now, He Who

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
Shall Not Be Named, right?

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
Honestly enough

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
he kind of ended a controversy about

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
this game

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
Wouldn't necessarily end the controversy, but he

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
he shot something down

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
Basically, there was a neo-conservator

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
blogger named Kevin McCollod

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
Remember that, Rob?

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
No. Anyway, he was

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
you know, going on saying

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
it had virtual

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
orgasmic rape and blah blah blah

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
blah blah, and

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
He Who Shall Not Be Named

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
literally

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
said, this contrived

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
controversy is absolutely ridiculous

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
and it made the other guy shut up

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
The guy who is the enemy of gamers

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
everywhere

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
A certain lawyer named Jack Voldemort, if I remember correctly

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
Told this guy to shut

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
the fuck up, and he shut the fuck up

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
He apologized

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
but said he's still considered the material offensive

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
And it's basically people talking

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
about shit in the game, who never fucking played

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
the game, who were being assholes

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
about it. Anyway

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
So, eventually we have

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
had other releases of

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
this game

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
Of course, I played it on PC

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
which, you know, I also

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
like modding the crap out of my game

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
We had

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
the Xbox 360 release

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
Did it come out on

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
It came out on PS3

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
Um

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
Eventually, you had to wait

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
for the Mass Effect trilogy, I think

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
for it to finally happen, but yeah

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
And then it came out on Wii U

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
Not the original Mass Effect

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
Mass Effect 3 did

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
The original Mass Effect was only on

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
PS3, Xbox 360

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
Xbox One backwards compatibility, and PC

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
Yeah, which I, you know, like I said

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
I played it on PC, modded the fuck out of it

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
So that it has like

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
The textures in my game

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
look better than Mass Effect 3

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
did when it came out, so

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
Those space dicks

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
looked so space dicky

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
That hot Turian dicking in HD

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
No, they didn't give us

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
naked Turians. They had models for it

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
Did you know that? Didn't put it in the game?

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
No, I did not know that

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
They had models for it

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
Anyway, and because of this game

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
I mean, now I've got a blog

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
that is quite literally

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
six people away from hitting 10,000

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
followers. Nerd

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
Fuck, I don't know how that happened

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
I didn't think I was that funny

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
There was this classic Fox News segment where Jeff Keighley

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
was talking about it, Mass Effect

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
And the opposing person admitted she had never even heard

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
of the game until about five minutes before going on the

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
air, and issued an apology

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
after being actually shown the scene in question

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
I do, I remember that controversy

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
Yeah, about what?

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
The sex scenes?

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
Yeah, the sex scenes in the game, basically

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
Casefully done, I'm on some fun

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
It was basically

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
Liara's space butt

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
Oh god

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
And so

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
But I mean

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
Yeah, actually

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
it's even brought up

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
The

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
Anchor's name was Martha McCollum

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
was her name

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
Anyway, anyway

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
It's just an awesome game

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
If you haven't played it, why the fuck not

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
if you've been listening to this show

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
the whole time

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
It's just really good, really fun

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
and really accessible

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
You can still get it on Steam

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
Or, I don't think it actually is on Origin

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
believe it or not

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
Because I bought mine only through Steam

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
I think it is on Origin now

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
Maybe now, but I think it took it a while for Origin

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
to actually update it since it

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
I think they had some license thing with Steam

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
Anyway, anyway

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
And of course, if anyone is interested

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
my Tumblr is

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
Mass Effecting

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
ing.tumblr.com

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
You can look at my stupid captions

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
that I've been doing for fuck knows

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
how long

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
And apparently, a few people like it

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
So

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
And if any of my Tumblr followers

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
are listening to this show, thank you for listening to the

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
episode

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
And shout out to y'all

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
Mass Effect is the best game ever

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
Alright, there it is

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
your classic game of the week

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
Mass Effect

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
A game you knew was coming eventually

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
here at Orange Lounge Radio, so why not episode 700

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
Alright, we're going to take a quick break

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
guys, when we come back there is more Orange Lounge Radio

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
Radio on Skype

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
We're going to get to the mailbag, we're going to talk about what

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
Reggie had to say about the Super Nintendo Classic

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
this week, and we'll talk

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
a little bit about a parody account that's going away

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
on Twitter

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
More Orange Lounge Radio with all that

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
and even more when we come back after this

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
quick break

01:38:49.000 --> 01:39:15.000
The

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
Starboard Power Coupling Podcast returns next week

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000

Join Captain Matt, Commander Eddie and Dr. Ken

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000

and of course, structure discovery

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
away missions

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
And we have one chance to get it right

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
Welcome back everybody to Orange

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
Lounge Radio live tonight, episode

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
number 700 for

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
this, September the 17th of

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
2017, we've had a fun

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
show, fun show

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
so far tonight when I'm not getting tongue tied

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
where there was even cake and

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
fire, and cakes on fire

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
but we made a wish

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
Cake fire, what did you wish

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
for Dark Sakura when you blew out the

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
candles? If I tell you, then it won't come true

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
Well, let's be real, it's not going to come true anyway

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
because this is just a lie

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
that we tell little kids

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
I wished for impeachment

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
Or safe

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
Impeachment of me from the show?

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
No, you're not an official

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
Oh, you're right, that's right

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
I'm a cheer tater

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
Either that or you know

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
anvil, piano, the same thing I

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
want for Pat Robertson

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
Alright, we're going to get back into some more

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
gaming news, but I want to

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
thank you guys again for being here tonight

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
over in chat, over at live.vognetwork.com

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
JD in chat actually says, elect Rob

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
to public office 2018

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
You know I've thought about it, and I know I've said this

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
on the show before, because you guys know I've been with Alan

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
for over seven years, but before I was with Alan

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
a couple years before that

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
and I don't remember if he would have been on this show because

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
OLR was happening, but

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
I actually dated a guy for about a year and a half

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
who was a, well

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
he had run for state assembly, he didn't

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
win, thank god, but

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
he had won, he had run for public office

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
and I think I've said this before, from dating

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
him and the experiences that I went through

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
during that, I learned that

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
any idiot can run for office

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
and I think what you saw happen last

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
year probably just accentuates

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
that point, but any

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
idiot can run for office

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
Did you hear though that Eddie Izzard is running?

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
I did not. In the UK.

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
I did not. For, I think

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
for, not for PM

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
I'll have to look it up again, but still

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
there's a big article I posted

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
about it not too long ago, but Eddie Izzard

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
is running. Well and then don't forget our pal

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
Travis Donovan ran for

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
I think it was mayor of Killeen, where he

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
was, I think, so

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
remember he ran for office, unfortunately he didn't

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
it might have been city council, I forget, sorry, in retrospect

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
I know it was like a very local race

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
but it was cool to hear him go through that and talk

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
about that on his show

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
I've thought about it, but

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
I'm torn because

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
on one hand I'm like

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
okay, with all the footage

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
that's probably out there of me from the

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
Rocky Horror Picture Show and some of the like weird

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
shit I've said on stage, like I don't

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
know if I ever could get elected to public

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
office, or the vast 700

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
episode library of this program

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
somebody will take something out

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
of context and put it out there and

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
try to fuck with me if I were to run for office

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
but then... He's running for

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
parliament by the way. They had to listen to 700 episodes

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
of that show. Yeah, then

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
what great promotion for this show, but

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
then we elected a guy president

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
who said, you know, he was gonna grab

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
what did he say? Grabbing pussies. Grab him by

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
the pussy. Grab him by the pussy and that guy

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
got elected president. So then there's a part of me that's like

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
I guess it doesn't matter if I've said something stupid

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
that gets taken out of context. Well he probably didn't really want to get voted for

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
president, he just ended up becoming

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
president. Anyway, I didn't mean to make this political

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
but the story is really supposed to be that

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
yes, any idiot can run for

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
office and I've considered it

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
I think it would be interesting, I think it would be fun

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
I think I do

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
a good job listening to people and

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
playing mediators sometimes because

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
again, even though people might

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
try to take some of the stuff out of context that I've

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
done with Rocky Horror Picture Show

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
do you know how much fucking drama

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
there is in theater troupes?

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
Do you know how much fucking drama

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
has to be mediated when you're running a fucking

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
theater troupe?

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
And for a while

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
I did mediate that drama. I finally

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
passed that on to somebody else who mediates

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
it now and there's been no shortage

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
of drama but

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
for the years I did it

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
I did mediate a lot of drama and so

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
I think that's a skill that can be used

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
in public office quite frankly

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
so, anyway

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
there it is. Going into chat

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
over at live.vognetwork.com

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
actdeftinchat says are you really worried

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
about people taking you out of context

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
considering the lots of OLR edits there

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
are even done by yourselves

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
Editing is a powerful thing

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
and a powerful tool and I think it would be very easy

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
to take something I've said on this show out of context

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
and somebody could apply it to

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
a totally different thing that wasn't

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
about a video game or something

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
you know, that's just a reality

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
tigercolonchat says California did elect

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
an actor as its governor at one time

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
at two times actually

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
there wasn't just Schwarzenegger

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
one of those actors became president

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
Ronald Reagan was also an actor

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000
way back in the day so was governor of California

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
Who's president of the United States?

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
Ronald Reagan, the actor?

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
and there's your Back to the Future reference

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
there it is, yes

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
alright, let's get back

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000
into some actual video game talk now

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
we do have some games to get to

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
there's politicians out there

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
that play video games, you bet the guy I used to

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
date I think met his new boyfriend

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
husband, whatever, on World of Warcraft

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
so, maybe

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
they're married, I don't know, who cares? Alright, moving on

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
Loki, what do you have for us in games?

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
alright, so

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
this is kind of out of nowhere

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
but Okami HD

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
was announced for Playstation 4

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
Xbox One and PC

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
it's going to be coming out in December

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
it's going to feature 4K support

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
and

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
also widescreen as the original game

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
was just 4x3

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
so they'll be coming out December 12

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
digital and retail for

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
$19.99

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
that's a good price, yeah, looks pretty nice

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
nice

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
the game was kind of artistic anyway

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
so it's

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
maybe the best 4K game, but

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
it'll look nice, I'm sure

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
and then of course, because everyone's

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
up in arms, everybody

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
loves the new look of Mario without a shirt

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
and everything, so

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
now of course, take it

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
to modders

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
see, this is what happens when you trust

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
modders, they're going to remove clothing

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
and so now for

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
Super Smash Brothers

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
on the Wii U, they have a mod

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
where it's shirtless Mario

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
you can play as shirtless Mario

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
of course, of course

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
complete with Mario titty?

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
complete with Mario titties

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
as was meant to be

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
per Nintendo's own direct, clearly

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
alright, well, speaking of things

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
that Nintendo has changed

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
and apparently they have metal shirtless Mario as well

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
metal titties

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
even better, cut right through ya

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
moving on to other news out of Nintendo

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
hey, their Switch app

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
which was, it's kind of a mess

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
y'all, that Switch app was kind of a mess

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
but they're trying to fix some of the issues

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
with it, and one of the big ones

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
was fixed this week, the 1.10

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
update is out for the Nintendo

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
Switch app, and voice chat

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
will now work while in

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
the background, and while other apps

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
are up front and center, you know, just like

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
Skype and Discord and stuff have worked

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
forever, so Nintendo Switch app

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
finally moving into 2017

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
there ya go

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
so, anyway, it hasn't fixed

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
everything, but that was probably one of the biggest

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
problems with it, so congratulations

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
etc.

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
a little less congratulations

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
and more sadness towards the

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
fans of Battleborn

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
and probably hearing that the game is

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
pretty much done at this point, they're not pulling the plug

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
they're not taking the servers offline

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
but after the upcoming fall update

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
according to creative director Randy Varnell

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
the servers will stick

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
around for the foreseeable future, but

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
it's just going to be pretty much a static

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
game at that point, now in the fall update

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
there will be skins, there will be balance patches

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
but this is pretty much it

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
the game is really only about

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
not even a year and a half old, and it's been

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
free to play for three months, what happened

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
to Battleborn? Well, a little game

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
called Overwatch that came out around the same

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
time happened to Battleborn, so

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
Battleborn,

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
yeah, didn't do so great as a result

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
so there it is, Battleborn

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
is no longer going to really

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
be supported after

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
this next patch in the fall, but it'll still

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
be up if you're still playing it

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
moving on, Dark Soccer, what do you have for us in rapid fire

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
news? Oh, just some stuff

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
so a new

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
character is

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
been announced for Dragon Ball

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
Fighter Z, going on with

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
Yamcha and Tenshinhan

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
is going to be an original character

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
Jinzo Ningen 21

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
or

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
Nijuuji

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
she's got glasses

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
wears an interesting outfit

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
and is nowhere in

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
the series except this game

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
but she's going to figure into story mode

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
so, hey

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
I'm pretty excited, I like how she looks

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
she might be cosplay worthy

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
and then in

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
older news, there

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
is

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
Wonder Boy the Dragon's

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
Trap on

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
Nintendo Switch has outsold

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
all the other versions combined

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
so

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
and it's a really good game

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
it is, it's a great remake

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
although I wish that the

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
animal forms had like lady

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
forms to go with Wonder Girl

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
oh, I didn't even realize that that was missing

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
well, Wonder Girl is in there, just

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
no, I know Wonder Girl is there, but yeah

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
but every form is still like the fish man, the mouse man

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
I see, yeah

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
okay, well

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
the lion one's the coolest though because he drags the sword behind him

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
I love the whole you can hit a button

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
and instantly switch between like the Sega Master System

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
well, look, it's not

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
a direct port of the Master System game

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
because it's still on widescreen, no, it's a complete remake

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
yeah, but it looks

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
you wouldn't be able to tell the difference, really

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
you know, unless you are

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
really, really a careful eye, and it has

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
the FM music from the

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
Master System version, nice, which even

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
the cartridge, if you play it through an FM

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
capable one, the US cartridge

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
won't play it, nice

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
so, it's a good way to

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
get some of the stuff that we

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
lost back

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
Orange Right says

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
it's really great to play that on a portable

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
the Switch difference, with a trademark sign

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
around that, I think, I bought

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
Dragon's Trap on the Switch, and yeah

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
I mean, the Switch makes a compelling argument

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
for if it's the exact same game

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
that's being sold on Playstation 4

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
and Xbox One, the Switch makes a compelling argument

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
for, I can pick this up and play on the go, if I buy it here

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
that's why I kind of kicked myself

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
when I got Sonic Mania on Playstation 4

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
I mean, don't get me wrong, you know, it works

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
great on Playstation 4, and the game is still good

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
but I literally forgot it was coming out

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
on Switch, and I wish I'd bought it there

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
so, yeah

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
it'll be interesting to see what

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
Sony and Microsoft, if they choose

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
to do anything in response, well I guess Microsoft

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
kind of has the whole Windows 10 thing

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
so, it'll be interesting to see if Sony brings back the Vita

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
just kidding, I don't think they're going to do that

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
they'll probably just rely on the more power

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
that's in that system, as opposed to the Switch

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
I mean, let's be real, the Switch

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
is not capable of doing a game like

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
Horizon Zero Dawn, so the

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
Playstation 4 does always have that

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
Alright, let's travel around and check out

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
what is coming out in stores this week

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
Loki, what's going to be on shelves this week?

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
Quite a bit, so we've got the Solus

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
project on Playstation

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000

and Xbox One

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
Mary Skelter Nightmares

NBA 2K18

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
on PC, the Switch

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
Xbox 360, Playstation 4

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
and Xbox One

Pan Capu

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
on, looks like

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
Playstation 4 and Xbox One

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
Yeah, Pan Capu

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
Okay, I don't know

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
I don't know what that is

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
It's just a thing

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
Steam World Dig 2 on the Switch

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
on the Switch

Guild Wars 2 Path of Fire

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
on PC

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
Steam Tournament DX on the Switch

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
Project Cars 2

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
on PC, Playstation 4

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
and Xbox One

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
Also, Steam World Dig will be making it out to

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
PC, Mac and Linux

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
The Lego Ninjago movie video game

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
on PC, Switch, Playstation 4

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
and Xbox One

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
And

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000
Caveman Warriors

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
on PC, the Switch, Playstation 4

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
and Xbox One

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000
And that's it

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000
In Japan, it's actually a pretty similar story this week

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
for the Japanese releases

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
also gets its Japanese release this week

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000
A couple days later on the 21st

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000
is when the releases are coming out in Japan

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000
Patapon gets its Playstation 4 release

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
We already had that here in the US

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000
Looks like it was a couple weeks later in Japan

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000
So the Patapon PS4 releases this week

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
And Project Cars 2

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
also getting a Japanese release this week

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
All that on the Playstation 4

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
Over on the Nintendo Switch, just one release

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
this week, but it's a pretty big one

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000
It's the Dragon Quest X all-in-one package

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000
Speaking of online games

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000
I would really like to see

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000
make it released

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
out here, that's one of them

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
But also, actually I believe the Pokken Tournament

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
is also being released in Japan

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000
Yes, it is, just a day later

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
That's why I missed it at the first glance

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
But Pokken Tournament does have the same day

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000
release as in the US and

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000
as even Europe as Star Soccer

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000
I'll get into it in a moment

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000
Certainly not leastly, on the Nintendo 3DS

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000
this week, Pocket Monster

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000
Gold and Silver

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
is going to be released on the 3DS

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
Of course, that is Pokemon Gold and Silver

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
There are actually going to be little

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
cards that you can buy in stores

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000
to then do on the eShop

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
if you wanted to do it that way for whatever reason

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000
That is what you have to look forward to

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000
on the 3DS

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
How about the UK Dark Soccer? I may have spoiled

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
one of them, sorry, but that's a worldwide release

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
On the 18th we have Echo for PC

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000
and PS4

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000
On the 19th, Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000
for Xbox One, PlayStation 4

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000
and PC

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
On the 22nd, we have Pokemon Gold and Silver

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000
Pokken Tournament DX

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000
The Lego Ninja Go

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
video game

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000
on a bunch of stuff, and there you go

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
Alright, now we're going to

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000
get to the mailbag

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000
Music

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000
Music

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
Music

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000
Every week you guys email us your favorite

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
stuff over at

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
participate at orangeloungeradio.com

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000
Sometimes it's feedback for the show

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000
Sometimes it's, I don't know

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000
a pat on the ass and a job well done

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000
Sometimes it's

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000
uh, fuck you, you fucking fuck

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
Sometimes it's got cake in the subject

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
line

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000
Let's get to tonight's

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000
email, Dark Soccer

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000
Greetings peoples, this week

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
I had a truly unique experience at work

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000
I talked to somebody

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000
Lately I've been taking my Nintendo

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000
Switch to work with me and playing Mario

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
plus Rabbids

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000
One of my fellow employees

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000
saw me playing the game and asked me what kind of game I was playing

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000
I explained Mario plus Rabbids

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000
like this. It's like chess

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000
You have different kinds of pieces that can move and attack

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000
in different ways. There's also two sides

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000
who fight each other using tactics

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000
and strategy along the way

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000
Also there are Rabbids on acid

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000
I thought this was a good

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000
way to describe Mario plus Rabbids

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000
Given how my coworker reacted

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000
he must have thought differently

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
This experience brought up the following

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000
question that I'd like your input on

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000
What should I, why should I

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000
continue talking to people? I mean

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000
you all claim to be

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000
sentient creatures, but some of you lack the sense

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000
lack the sense the demigod

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000
gave yeast. Stay drunk

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000
or entertainment

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000
Is that a flying spaghetti

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000
monster reference? I'm not sure

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000
It might be

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000
So why should I

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000
continue talking to people? That's the question for us

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000
this week. Don't

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
If you don't want to talk to people

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000
don't. Don't do anything you don't

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000
want to do. I will say this

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000
that people who don't talk to other people in an

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000
office environment tend to

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000
get the piss

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000
end of reviews and

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000
you know aren't as well

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000
referred to because networking

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000
in your office is the way you

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000
You might be labeled a bitch if you don't

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000
smile. Or just the weird girl

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
who sits in that cube with her headphones

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000
Well that was me. I was the weird girl

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000
that would sit in the cube with headphones

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000
Um

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000
But I actually hit my current job

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000
I fit right in with everybody else

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000
So, or you know what?

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000
Find a job that has cool people at it

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000
Find a job where you don't have to talk if you don't want to talk

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000
Although I think it would be a good idea

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000
You do want to like at least talk to yourself

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
in the mirror. Practice with your

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000
voice once in a while. Say it with me

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
I'm good enough

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000
I'm smart enough and doggone it

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000
if people like me. Of course you should

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000
Just to make sure you don't like forget how to talk

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000
or that your voice doesn't go out or something like that

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000
You should still practice. And to be fair

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000
entertainment

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000
Some people might be pretty cool if you give them a chance

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.000
and talk to them. So

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000
You know. There is a person underneath the suit

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000
That's right. Don't do anything you don't want to do

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000
But at the same time, take a risk

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000
Sometimes it can work out to your advantage

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000
Say hi to somebody new today

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000
And then listen for blackmail

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000
Say hi to a stranger

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.000
No. Don't say hi to a stranger

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000
Cause they'll just give you a weird look and try to shoot you

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000
What if they have candy?

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000
Next email

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000
Hello LR. I write tonight

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000
not to respond to something on last week's show

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000
Not to plug anything of mine

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000
And not to shower you with bad puns

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000
Instead the reason for this email

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
Is two fold. First off

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000
I want to congratulate you guys on your latest milestone

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000
Thank you. Thank you

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000
700 episodes sounds like a lot

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000
Because it is. It is

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000
It represents an enormous amount of work

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000
Literal thousands of hours

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000
Of headlines, insights, interviews

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000
And discussions. Plus the occasional

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000
Rant and the frequent food tangents

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000
Ok. Just to

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
Math. I don't mean to bring math

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000
Into this. But I'm going to. Cause I know there's at least

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.000
A couple math nerds out there. Now

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000
If I take 700 episodes

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.000
And I multiply that by

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000
3 hours an episode

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000
Except our earlier ones were

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000
The earlier episodes were 2 and lately

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.000
Our shows have been running like 2 and a half hours

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000
But

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000
We had marathon shows

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000
We did E3 specials that weren't numbered

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000
Technically we've

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000
I should be able to count the spinoff shows like courthouse 2

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000
So we're going to just say to make it easy

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000
3 hours. 3 hours an episode

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000
3 hour trainwrecks

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000
You could count

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000
The show you did on OLR where you did

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000
Pub of the volume. Thank you

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000
I'd love to bring that back if we had some licensing

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000
Well. Or look at

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000
Doing remixes

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000
Of overclocked or something. I don't know. Who knows

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000
Alright anyway. So that's 2100 hours

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000
Ok. So I'm going to divide that

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000
By how many hours in a day

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000
24

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000
87 and a half

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000
Straight days of content

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
Geez

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000
So you would

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000
To marathon this entire show would take

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000
About 3 months

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.000
Just something to think about there

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.000
For a minute

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.000
You've built a community and kept it quite

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.000
Entertained. As a part of that community

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:05.000
Allow me to say thanks very much

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000
Not only for the massive body of work

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:09.000
But also for continuing to put

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000
On this show each and every week

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.000
For our enjoyment. Seriously thank you so much

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.000
We'll keep meeting you at that dinner table

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.000
This is a direct comparison

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.000
But if we look at TV

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.000
One of the stats I like to

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:23.000
Point out a while back was

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000
The longest running

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000
Primetime television show

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:29.000
The Simpsons

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000
618 episodes

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000
We've passed The Simpsons now

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000
South Park 278

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000
Gunsmoke 635

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:39.000
Lassie

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:41.000
We have more episodes on Lassie

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.000
Fuck that dog

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.000
Alright so moving on

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.000
Second I wanted to tell you that in working

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:49.000
On the UI for super multitasking

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:51.000
I discovered something, something

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.000
Unbelievable. A fact that has been in front of my eyes

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:55.000
For years in front of all of our eyes

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.000
Actually but I never noticed it. Maybe none

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.000
Of us did. So here it is

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000
The shift key on the right side of the standard PC

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.000
Keyboard is whiter than the shift key

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:05.000
On the left side of the standard PC keyboard

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:07.000
This seems to apply to every keyboard I

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:09.000
Have except for keyboards built into Mac laptops

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
Where the shift keys are the same size

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.000
He's right

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:15.000
Like I've never noticed. I'm looking at the key

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:17.000
And here I am looking at my Mac to confirm

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.000
That they're the same

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.000
Cause I'm on a Macbook Pro 2014

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.000
Ok well the studio computer, I have a little

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.000
Microsoft keyboard here that's probably as old as this show

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.000
But sure enough the shift key on the right

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000
Is bigger than the one on the left

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000
Is that the same thing on a PC laptop?

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000
Yeah my laptop's like that

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.000
Huh

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000
You know in about a couple

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000
More years we're gonna have more episodes in the

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.000
My life too

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.000
If we make it that long

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.000
The show could end at any time

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000
Any time kids

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000
Any time

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.000
Well am I the only one who didn't realize

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.000
This up until now? Or is this a shocking

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.000
Revelation for everyone present?

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.000
Chatters! Press 1 if

02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.000
Your mind has been blown

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000
And by the way, yes Jamie

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.000
I have been double spacing in between sentences

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000
For as long as I can remember

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000
I did take a keyboarding class in high school

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.000
And I honestly can't remember whether I started doing that

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.000
Before or after

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:13.000
And there you have it! Have a great week everyone

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.000
Erin Yyr

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.000
Yeah it's something that's like

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:19.000
A very common thing for people

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.000
Who took typing

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:23.000
Or had teachers who

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000
Used for computer classes

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.000
Or nuns who would smack you with a ruler

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:29.000
When you didn't do it the way you were supposed to

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:31.000
Whatever. The double spacing is

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000
Let's see

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.000
We have two, we have one

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.000
We have a dash

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:39.000
I always knew, I knew always

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:41.000
Says fifth dream

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:43.000
Come on buntiful cakes

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:45.000
Says mind blown

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:47.000
There you go

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.000
What I'm curious about is

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.000
How did that come into

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000
How did you find that out doing multitasking?

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000
I mean I imagine the shift key does something in your game

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:57.000
But how did that become important

02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.000
That the left key was not as big as the right key?

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000
I'm curious now

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.000
Well I think that the reason why is that on the standard PC

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.000
It's done to line up with the enter key

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.000
Yeah

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.000
Because it's as long as the enter if I'm right

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:11.000
Right you're right, not on mine

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.000
Not on mine it is

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:15.000
Well and I was looking at my mac

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000
And those two were the same but my return key

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.000
Is the same size as my caps lock

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:21.000
So the whole thing is fairly symmetrical

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000
Until you get to the arrow buttons

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000
Doesn't have to do with where your pinky

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.000
Or your fourth finger goes when you hit the shift key

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000
Like if it doesn't stick out

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000
Far enough on the right side you might not hit it

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000
I don't know but now I need to

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000
Look at my iMac keyboard

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000
And see if it's set up the same way

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:39.000
Because Mavis Beacon taught me how to type

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000
Who?

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000
Mavis Beacon

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000
Like the grandma of internet typing

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000
Right whatever

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000
I learned to type getting into

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.000
A speed contest with my roommate at the time

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:53.000
Because

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:55.000
I wanted to be able to keep up with the AOL chat room

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.000
Never forget

02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:59.000
F F F space J J J J

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:01.000
Space F F F F space

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.000
J J J J

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000
Guess you didn't take typing

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.000
I didn't take typing

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:09.000
Mavis Beacon taught me

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:11.000
I learned on my own time

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000
I didn't formally

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.000
Or through any type of instruction

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.000
Learn to touch type

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000
I was kind of typing already

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.000
But then I was like well maybe I should like learn to type faster

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:23.000
So I started doing Mavis Beacon

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.000
Teaches typing and I got faster

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:27.000
Okay

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:29.000
I learned through AOL

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.000
Because of reasons

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:35.000
And that's it for emails?

Doesn't have to be a clean joke but keep it classy

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:57.000
Alright

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.000
Let's get back into some gaming news. Loki

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.000
Alright

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.000
So I'll try to be positive

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:05.000
Because we're talking about Nintendo

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.000
Good luck with that

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.000
We're talking about some classic systems

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.000
Sending prayers

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:13.000
So Reggie basically said

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:15.000
Hey

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:17.000
We know that the demand

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000
Is really high on these systems

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:21.000
However I strongly urge you

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:23.000
To overbid on SNES classic system

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:25.000
On any auction sites

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:27.000
You shouldn't have to pay more than

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:29.000
$79.99 he says

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.000
And promising that they're going to have

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:33.000
More systems

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:35.000
Available at launch

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.000
That you know

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:39.000
Okay not maybe plentiful

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:41.000
But it will be

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:43.000
Easier to find them

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000
So

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.000
Don't buy from scalpers

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.000
Which really is good advice you should buy from scalpers

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:51.000
But kind of unheard of

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:53.000
That they also announced

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:55.000
That in 2018

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:57.000
They're bringing back the NES classic

02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.000
So apparently you know

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000
There is a huge response obviously

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:03.000
The demand is so high for the system

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:05.000
That they decided that they're going to be bringing it back

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:07.000
Summer of 2018

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:09.000
With brand new shipments

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:11.000
So

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:13.000
Interesting. Wonder if it's going to have different games with it this time

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.000
Probably not

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:17.000
I think the only thing that will

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:19.000
Probably have changed on that system

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.000
Is however they hacked into that the first time

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:23.000
Will probably be patched up

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:25.000
And I can't believe nobody else is bringing this up

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:27.000
At least not that I've read

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.000
Like people are either going the route that you're going

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:31.000
Or like oh maybe it'll be a 2.0 with new games

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:33.000
Which ain't going to happen

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:35.000
Or it's just the whole

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:37.000
Oh they're finally remaking what they did before

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:39.000
I don't think so

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:41.000
I think there will be a change in that firmware

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:43.000
And it's going to block whatever method they were using

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:45.000
Now don't get me wrong

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.000
I'm not stupid enough to say that

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:49.000
But I'm just

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:51.000
I am saying they're going to block whatever

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:53.000
Has been doing

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:55.000
Whatever is the method now

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:57.000
A good indicator will be the SNES classic edition

02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:59.000
When that comes out to see

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:01.000
What's capable of that

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:03.000
I'm assuming that will be hacked immediately

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:05.000
I would assume the same would be the NES classic

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:07.000
Honestly I don't know

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:09.000
Like I get it

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:11.000
That people like to do that stuff

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:13.000
But you know what the people like to do that stuff

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:15.000
They probably would still

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:17.000
They're not going to not buy

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:19.000
It's just that they like all their stuff

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:21.000
In one spot

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:23.000
Although they're classic games in one spot

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:25.000
Take the fucking hint

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:27.000
Perhaps release the virtual console

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:29.000
Perhaps you could even make

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:31.000
A virtual console

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:33.000
Since you're dicking around with a virtual console on the Switch

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:35.000
Make a system that's like the NES classic edition

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:37.000
That hey guess what

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:39.000
It looks all retro and shit

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:41.000
And it connects to the internet

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.000
It connects the fucking ROMs to it

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:45.000
And make it affordable

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:47.000
Stopy in chat says yes

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:49.000
I too expect a patch to combat hacking

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:51.000
Original ones will still go for money because of it

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:53.000
Over at live.vognetware.com

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:55.000
It is a little weird that they're suddenly

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:57.000
Coming out and saying they're going to make more of them

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:59.000
But at the same time

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:01.000
Is it super surprising? Not really

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:03.000
I'd be curious to see how many

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:05.000
Are going to make how readily available they're going to be

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:07.000
And if companies like GameStop or

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.000
ThinkGeek lock them behind

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:11.000
Like a paywall to get that shit

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:13.000
I'm also going to say this to Reggie's credit

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:15.000
I know it's very easy to be cynical

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:17.000
About what he's saying and believe me

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:19.000
There's a large part of me that's very

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:21.000
Cynical as well and I definitely feel

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:23.000
Actions speak louder than words Reggie

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:25.000
So if that's Super Nintendo

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:27.000
If pre-orders are not supposed to be

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:29.000
The barometer for availability for this thing

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:31.000
Then I hope you're able to prove it

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:33.000
Day one, actions speak louder than words

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:35.000
But at the same time

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:37.000
I'm hopeful that that action

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:39.000
Is coming based on the fact that

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:41.000
He said anything at all

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:43.000
Cause let's be real

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:45.000
He didn't have to say a goddamn thing

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:47.000
So there's a part of me that's thinking

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:49.000
Maybe there is

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:51.000
Hope for people

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.000
That do not yet have a Super Nintendo

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:55.000
Pre-order but still want

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.000
To get one of these. I mean that is a pretty

02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:59.000
Powerful statement for Reggie

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:01.000
To come out and say, don't buy from

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:03.000
Scalpers, we gotcha

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:05.000
Now again

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:07.000
I wouldn't

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:09.000
I come from a place of pre-order

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:11.000
Privilege with this because

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:13.000
I do have a pre-order, at least right now

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:15.000
I still have my pre-order with Best Buy

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:17.000
But I like to think that even

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:19.000
If I didn't have that pre-order secured right now

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:21.000
I would

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:23.000
Feel a little better about

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:25.000
This but I'd probably still be going right

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:27.000
At 8 AM or whenever the store

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.000
Opens the day these things come out

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.000
I still don't think they're gonna be that plentiful

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:33.000
But maybe instead

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:35.000
Of stores only getting

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:37.000
24 of them or whatever it was

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:39.000
Last time, I have to ask Allen how many it was when he went

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:41.000
Remember when he camped out at Best Buy and still couldn't get one?

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:43.000
Maybe

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:45.000
Instead of 24 per store

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:47.000
Maybe there will be

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:49.000
72. You know, maybe the number's

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:51.000
Gonna be a lot higher

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:53.000
And something where people that do line up

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:55.000
And bother to wait

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:57.000
Will get one. So we'll see

02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:59.000
We'll see

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:01.000
Alright

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:03.000
SHA 100 Mountain Chat says

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:05.000
Rumor is that

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:07.000
Targets are getting 30-90 stocks

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:09.000
Of Super Nintendo Classic

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:11.000
I'll believe it when I see it

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:13.000
Alright, let's move on to

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:15.000
Some more stories

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:17.000
Including a story about Final Fantasy 14

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:19.000
No, I'm not gonna be

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:21.000
Doing a big commercial for the MMO

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:23.000
But I do think it's kinda neat

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:25.000
That because of the hurricanes that have happened

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.000
Recently here in the US, namely of course

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:29.000
Harvey and Irma

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:31.000
Which, you know, obviously those images

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:33.000
Of the things that Harvey did in Houston

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:35.000
And what Irma was doing to the keys

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:37.000
You know, is really horrible what's going on

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:39.000
And we talked about that last week

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:41.000
Well, I don't know if you know this, but in Final Fantasy 14

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:43.000
If you don't log into the game

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:45.000
And go into your house

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:47.000
Every something like 45-90 days

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:49.000
I think it is

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:51.000
I can't remember exactly how many days it is

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:53.000
I wanna say it's as far as 90 days

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:55.000
But it might be as low as 45

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:57.000
But if you don't go into the house regularly

02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:59.000
It is demolished and the space

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:01.000
Can be sold off to somebody else

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.000
You get all the junk that was in your house

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:05.000
Go to like a refund vendor

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:07.000
Or something that you can still do for 30 days

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:09.000
And you get some of the guild reimbursed

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:11.000
But not all of it, but this system's in place

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:13.000
We'll have to ask Allen about it because

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:15.000
He didn't log into the game for so long, his house got demolished

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:17.000
I was on

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:19.000
When the demolition notice popped up

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000
I'm sure mine is long ago

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:23.000
Well, did you ever buy a house?

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:25.000
No, I just have a guild room

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:27.000
Then you're fine

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:29.000
Those don't go away unless I delete it

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:31.000
Or whoever, no because you went to a different guild

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:33.000
I went to a different guild

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:35.000
Whoever your guild master is, as long as they didn't delete it

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:37.000
Or kick you out of the guild then you still have it

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:39.000
But anyway

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:41.000
My point with all that is that

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:43.000
Final Fantasy XIV and Square Enix

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:45.000
They actually put a stay on that

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:47.000
So right now they did a patch last night

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:49.000
That stopped the clock

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:51.000
Or not last night, it was Thursday night

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:53.000
They did a patch that stops the clock

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.000
It's been two weeks

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:57.000
Yeah, two weeks starting on September 15th

02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:59.000
So there will be a two week grace period

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:01.000
With no demolitions

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:03.000
So this way people that are without power

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:05.000
Or not able to log into the game for other reasons right now

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:07.000
Will have an additional two weeks

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:09.000
To get to a computer, log in

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:11.000
And be able to keep their game

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:13.000
And keep the house going and all that stuff

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:15.000
I would imagine a lot of people just had

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:17.000
A friend log in on their behalf

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:19.000
But of course that involves giving your password away

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:21.000
Which you're not supposed to do

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:23.000
I'd be lying if I said I haven't done it in a similar scenario

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:25.000
So somebody I really really trust

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:27.000
Alright, there you go

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.000
I just think that's kind of neat

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:31.000
That the MMO is changing its rules to accommodate for

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:33.000
The real world scenario

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:35.000
Alright, Stoppy in chat says

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:37.000
More like Final Foreclosure

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:39.000
Am I right? Yes, yes you're right

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:41.000
Alright, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:43.000
Stuff

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:45.000
Actually this one is

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:47.000
Another way that video games

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.000
Have done good things for people

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:51.000
And actually this comes from

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:53.000
Rome actually

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.000
A Serbian father

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:57.000
Who was living in

02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:59.000
Italy

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:01.000
Actually had his thirteen year old daughter

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:03.000
Trapped for four years

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:05.000
To sell her

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:07.000
To a buyer in France for

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:09.000
Eighteen thousand dollars

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:11.000
Yeah, good dad there

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:13.000
And she

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:15.000
Actually used

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:17.000
A video game

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:19.000
To help herself escape

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:21.000
Um

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:23.000
So I'm trying to find exactly

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:25.000
What it was

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:27.000
Um

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:29.000
She was being groomed

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:31.000
To be a child bride

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:33.000
And um

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:35.000
She

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:37.000
Oh, hold on

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:39.000
I'm sorry this is taking me a moment

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:41.000
Anyway

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:43.000
She had

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:45.000
Been in school until she was thirteen

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:47.000
And then she was locked up

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:49.000
But she had

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.000
A video game on a

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:53.000
Simless cell phone

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:55.000
That she would play

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:57.000
But one day she got an alert

02:12:57.000 --> 02:12:59.000
That she had

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:01.000
A weak

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:03.000
Password free wifi network

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:05.000
Near her

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:07.000
And so she used the wifi network

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:09.000
On the video game to find

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:11.000
A multiplayer feature on the game

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:13.000
That she used

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:15.000
To help

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:17.000
Call for help

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:19.000
She said that a lot of people ignored her

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:21.000
Until they took it seriously

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:23.000
And she gave the person the information

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:25.000
And then the police were able to track her down

02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:27.000
So um

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:29.000
She's under police protection

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:31.000
Her asshole dad is in jail

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:33.000
I hope the guy in France who was trying to buy her

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:35.000
Is in jail

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:37.000
Because that shit is not cool

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:39.000
Yeah

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:41.000
But um she used a video game

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:43.000
It's interesting you know these stories

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:45.000
Sometimes we've heard the dark side about how MMOs

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:47.000
Result in really bad

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:49.000
Situations for people when maybe young

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:51.000
People meet people they met online

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:53.000
On an MMO or something we've heard kind of the bad side of that

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:55.000
So it's nice to hear the good side

02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:57.000
Too not that this story is necessarily

02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:59.000
Good because we get into this whole

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:01.000
Element of human trafficking which is a really

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:03.000
You know sick thing that's happening in our society

02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:05.000
And it's one of those things where it's like

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:07.000
I think a lot of us don't realize that this

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:09.000
Shit happens in the world and it's pretty sick

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:11.000
But the good news is that

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:13.000
This girl was saved

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:15.000
Because of whatever it's curious that they

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:17.000
Don't name the game she was playing

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:19.000
But perhaps it's nothing we would recognize anyway

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:21.000
Since she was in Italy right

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:23.000
So you know it could be a game that was localized

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:25.000
For you know Italian audiences anyway

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:27.000
But it sounds like it was something where you could

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:29.000
Interact with other players so thanks

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:31.000
To the chat in the game you know she

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:33.000
Got rescued she was able to put out that call for help

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:35.000
So that's that's great

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:37.000
And that's great that her dad was too stupid

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:39.000
To think of that that that could be a possibility

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:41.000
Yeah so

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:43.000
Good on her yep

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:45.000
Hope she's able to

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:47.000
Turn life around and have a

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.000
Great life in spite of that

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:51.000
Really really really truly her hideous

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:53.000
Experience yeah so

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:55.000
Alright anyway

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:57.000
Let's see going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com

02:14:57.000 --> 02:14:59.000
Kind of an interesting

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:01.000
Story again about kind of like the good things

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:03.000
Of gaming and you know kind of piggybacking on

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:05.000
The Final Fantasy story

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:07.000
We had a minute ago as Joe and Hunter Matt says

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:09.000
I remember when Hurricane Sandy hit

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:11.000
New York there was a mall in Connecticut

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:13.000
That had power and offered free

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:15.000
High-speed internet for people who are without power

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:17.000
From the storm I remember seeing a

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:19.000
Dude with his PC rig hooked up in the food

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:21.000
Court of this mall doing his

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:23.000
Wow dailies

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:25.000
Maybe not what was

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:27.000
Intended the Wi-Fi to be used for

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:29.000
But people have their priorities

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:31.000
All over the place actually when I

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:33.000
Was in Alabama a couple years ago

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:35.000
I went to the Dunkin Donuts

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:37.000
And someone was there

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:39.000
Two people were there with a full PC rig

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:41.000
Playing MMOs

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:43.000
You know and in spite of

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:45.000
I'm sure some could make an argument that

02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:47.000
The internet traffic maybe shouldn't have

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:49.000
Been taken up by that but at the same token

02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:51.000
You know in times

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:53.000
Of crisis like people's mental

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:55.000
Health is a very serious thing and maybe

02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:57.000
If this is what this guy kind of had

02:15:57.000 --> 02:15:59.000
To do to

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:01.000
Take a mental break from the stress

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:03.000
Of the situation then

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:05.000
Is it really that bad

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:07.000
As long as everybody else's internet was working then

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:09.000
You know so be it right

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:11.000
Anyway let's move on

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:13.000
Just a couple more stories for you guys then we're gonna

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:15.000
Open up the Skype line if any of you want to call in

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:17.000
And say hello here on episode 700

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:19.000
You'll have that ability shortly at

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:21.000
Orange Lounge Radio all one word on Skype

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:23.000
Please if you've never called the show

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:25.000
Before give Echo123

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:27.000
A call first just to test your connection

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:29.000
Meanwhile Loki

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:31.000
I'm excited to see CEOs step down

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:33.000
From their posts but

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:35.000
I'm gonna have to report

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:37.000
That CEO Kazurai

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:39.000
The parody account on Twitter

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:41.000
Is gonna be retiring

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:43.000
2018

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:45.000
Just uh

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:47.000
The parody account

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:49.000
The parody account yes

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:51.000
It'd be funny if he came back it's like

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:53.000
Somebody else like another CEO

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:55.000
Well did you read the letter from the guy

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:57.000
Who was running it and kind of

02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:59.000
You know I guess the gist I got

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:01.000
From it was that well the joke's running out

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:03.000
And I don't really have the motivation

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:05.000
That I once had yeah it was basically

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:07.000
No here's what he says

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:09.000
For over eight years now

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:11.000
I've been running this Twitter account originally started

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:13.000
Because I wanted to make jokes about video game news

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:15.000
Rumors press conferences but I knew

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:17.000
Nobody in real life would have

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:19.000
Um knew

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:21.000
Nobody in real life that would have gotten them

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:23.000
Um between then and

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:25.000
Now I have somehow

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:27.000
Really managed to gain over

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:29.000
100,000 followers

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:31.000
Uh this has included people in the games media

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:33.000
That I read on a daily basis

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:35.000
People that I have worked with

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:37.000
Some of my favorite games and most importantly

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:39.000
Of all um Shuhei Yoshida

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:41.000
And um you know

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:43.000
Just it's been fun from the very start

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:45.000
Ton of fun but it's been um

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:47.000
You know looks like it's getting hard

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:49.000
You know recently though I've been tweeting a lot less often

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:51.000
Um you know

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:53.000
I still play spend plenty of time playing

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:55.000
I spend a lot less time following video game news

02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:57.000
Um basically saying

02:17:57.000 --> 02:17:59.000
Therefore I've decided to

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:01.000
That in 2018 will be the last year of the Twitter account

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:03.000
Um

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:05.000
So he says I want to do an account

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:07.000
For one more for

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:09.000
E3 I also want to give myself

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:11.000
To do a proper ending

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:13.000
For the account I just don't know what it is

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:15.000
Going to be yet and

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:17.000
I'm rubbish at giving things up

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:19.000
So be interesting

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:21.000
He used the word rubbish

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:23.000
Must be overseas

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:25.000
But all joking

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:27.000
Aside and sleuthing on who might be running

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:29.000
It aside

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:31.000
It's interesting that there's such a

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:33.000
Lead time on this you know what I mean

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:35.000
I'm ending it after the next

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:37.000
E3 which is still a good nine months away

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:39.000
So

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:41.000
That would be like me saying Orange Lounge

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:43.000
Radio is going to be done in the

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:45.000
Year 2020

02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:47.000
It's just quite a lead time

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:49.000
Yeah it's I don't know

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:51.000
Don't take me serious I don't

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:53.000
This show is going to keep going

02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:55.000
Until it doesn't

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:57.000
That's what I pretty much always said

02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:59.000
Alright

02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:01.000
Anyhow

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:03.000
One more story for you guys before we

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:05.000
Call it a night here and get to your calls

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:07.000
Let's talk about Mario 64

02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:09.000
How about a new mod

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:11.000
For Mario 64

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:13.000
Well I don't know if I would call it a mod

02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:15.000
It's kind of weird because I don't think they exactly

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:17.000
Modded the cartridge I think what they had to do

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:19.000
They went in here and they actually like

02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:21.000
Did a patch for the emulator

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:23.000
I think they like mod the emulator

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:25.000
So instead of just hacking the ROM this tool for

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:27.000
Mario 64 will let you

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:29.000
Go into the virtual

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:31.000
RAM of the emulator and then

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:33.000
It shares information

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:35.000
So that you can play

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:37.000
Super Mario 64 online

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:39.000
That's right up to

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:41.000
24 people playing

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:43.000
Super Mario 64 online

02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:45.000
With each other

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:47.000
You can play as other characters too

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:49.000
You can play as Waluigi which I think is very important

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:51.000
To point out

02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:53.000
Princess Peach, Rosalina

02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:55.000
And what's great is they all play differently

02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:57.000
Like Princess Peach has her floaty

02:19:57.000 --> 02:19:59.000
That you would expect right

02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:01.000
And Wario's in there and a lot of the other Mario characters

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:03.000
Toad it looked like he ran really fast

02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:05.000
And you control each other

02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:07.000
What's that?

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:09.000
Oh you control each other too?

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:11.000
You can beat up each other and kill each other

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:13.000
Oh that's awesome

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:16.000
Well they already did against his first video that he put up

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:18.000
Kinda yeah like the video got

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:20.000
Taken down for the music

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:22.000
Because they did use the music from

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:24.000
Mario 64 in the trailer at least

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.000
IGN because I guess IGN

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:28.000
Doesn't get strikes on their channel because it looks like they

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:30.000
Reposted it they just reposted the video on their channel

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:32.000
And it's up it's fine you can see it

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.000
So yeah just do check it out

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
I do know that they had like a

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000
Website that's dedicated to their forms

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:40.000
Or whatever that you should probably check out

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:42.000
Just because I'm assuming that you know all these

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.000
He has the links to the downloads

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:46.000
In the actual videos

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.000
But you know if you want to check out the forms

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:50.000
It's sm64o.com

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:52.000
And

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.000
You know check out the updates on there

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:56.000
But yeah I watched some gameplay of it today

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:58.000
And it looks fucking hilarious

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:00.000
Just like even watching people like there's

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:02.000
I saw two people doing a

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:04.000
120 star run or whatever

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:06.000
And like during it

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:08.000
One of the guys like was sitting there

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:10.000
Doing like an animation or something

02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:13.000
And he put them behind it was funny

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:15.000
It's just I don't know it's really cool

02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:17.000
You can see each other but it's not entirely

02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:19.000
In sync so you'll see like

02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:21.000
For example like when you're throwing the bomb king

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:23.000
Or whatever off the mountain you'll see kind

02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:25.000
Of Mario spinning around there's like he's holding

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:27.000
Nothing it's just like kind of spinning around

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:29.000
But it's it's neat I don't know

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:31.000
The 24 players at one time that

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:33.000
I want to see some

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:35.000
Awesome games done quick with that

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:37.000
Nobody asked for this

02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:39.000
Before we open up the skype line which we're about

02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:41.000
To get to here so if you want to give us a call

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:43.000
Orange Lounge Radio all one word

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:44.000
On skype

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:46.000
JD in our chat says regarding

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:48.000
The last story about the

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:50.000
Advanced notice of ending the account

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:52.000
JD says I don't know in some ways

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:54.000
It's kind of nice to give your fans some warning

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:56.000
If it's possible though

02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:58.000
You know it may in some cases

02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:00.000
It's not always possible you know

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:02.000
I don't know what will happen with OLR

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:04.000
I don't like to think about ending the show right now

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:06.000
It's just kind of one of those that's why I say it'll be done

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:08.000
When it'll be done if we can give notice

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:10.000
I think we will but if we can't

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:11.000
Putting you on notice

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:13.000
Then we're not going to be able to

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:15.000
It just kind of depends on what the situation is you know

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:17.000
I just think but maybe

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:19.000
Do you think maybe there's too much

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:21.000
Notice

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:23.000
Nine months

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:25.000
That's a lot of notice

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:26.000
Just saying

02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:27.000
Yeah so anyway

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:29.000
I don't know it's not necessarily a bad thing

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:31.000
I guess didn't Lost

02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:33.000
Set their series finale like two

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:35.000
Years in advance because Lost was kind of

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:37.000
Starting to fall up it's own ass a bit

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:39.000
So they the ABC was like

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:41.000
We're going to set the end date now so that you know

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:43.000
When the story needs to be wrapped up

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:45.000
We also know like

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:47.000
Game of Thrones is going to be the end too

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:49.000
Yeah that's true

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:51.000
We've known that for a while but that's Game of Thrones is also

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:53.000
Based on books even though the books aren't done

02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:55.000
They've so deviated

02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:57.000
Yeah well yeah at this point

02:22:57.000 --> 02:22:59.000
Hasn't George RR Martin kind of told them what's

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:01.000
Supposed to happen in the books not that I guess that it matters

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:03.000
They do deviate from the books but

02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:05.000
Not as much as Walking Dead deviates

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:07.000
Though right? Doesn't Walking Dead deviate

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:09.000
A lot more? I don't know

02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:11.000
I don't know because I don't care about Walking Dead

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:13.000
Well and those shows are all on Sunday night

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:15.000
Yeah

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:17.000
I mean I was able to watch the entire run

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:19.000
Of Twin Peaks but the whole on demand

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:21.000
Element of that really helped so there was that

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:23.000
Alright

02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:25.000
The Skype line is open right now

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:27.000
Over at Orange Lounge Radio

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:29.000
All one word on Skype

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:31.000
If you'd like to give us a call you can do that right now

02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:33.000
In the meantime I'm going to check in

02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:35.000
While we wait for some calls and see if Loki has any

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:37.000
Last minute stories

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:39.000
Yes apparently there is some modders that are

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:41.000
Making a demake of Half Life 2

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:43.000
In Half Life 1's engine

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:45.000
Called Half Life 2 Classic

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:47.000
And it looks

02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:49.000
Old

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:51.000
As Half Life 1 would look

02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:53.000
But yeah

02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:55.000
So apparently they have

02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:57.000
A demo that's available on ModDB

02:23:57.000 --> 02:23:59.000
So go search for Half Life 2 Classic

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:01.000
And you can check out what they've got so far

02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:03.000
Which

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:05.000
I don't know

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:07.000
The fans continuing to

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:09.000
Deliver on Half Life when Valve will not

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:11.000
You know

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:13.000
They never asked if

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:15.000
Whether they could it's just whether

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:17.000
They should have

02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:19.000
Dungeon Buster in chat pointing out

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:21.000
Regarding TV

02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:23.000
The Americans is also ending in a season or two

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:25.000
I don't even know that show

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:27.000
I have to look to Critical Myth reviews

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:29.000
To tell me what's popular on

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:31.000
TV right now because a lot of times I don't know

02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:33.000
But I just look at whatever John and his team is writing

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:35.000
About Dungeon Buster in chat

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:37.000
Also says this last season of

02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:39.000
Game of Thrones isn't based on any book

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:41.000
Just a general outline

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:43.000
By Martin and then Bob

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:45.000
Coffee caught your reference that I also

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:47.000
Caught with what you just said saying life

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:49.000
Finds a way

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:51.000
Orange Lounge Radio

02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:53.000
Again all one word on Skype

02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:55.000
If you want to give us a call here on our 700th

02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:57.000
Episode not that I'm guilting you

02:24:57.000 --> 02:24:59.000
Into it but

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:01.000
Or is Skype working?

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:03.000
Hopefully somebody in chat if somebody

02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:05.000
Is trying to call and is not getting through

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:07.000
Let me know because I know

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:09.000
Bobby was having calls

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:11.000
C Rama says we're not answering

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:13.000
This happened earlier

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:15.000
On another note speaking of Mario 64

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:17.000
So apparently there's another guy

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:19.000
I think the guy that was maybe doing

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:21.000
I don't know if this is the same one that did the editor

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:23.000
Like the Mario thing but he made

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:25.000
Infinite size levels

02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:27.000
For Super Mario 64

02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:29.000
So he's got like a level that's like

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:31.000
Mario Kart or something that Mario is running in

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:33.000
That's ridiculous

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:35.000
Oh it's in the WooHoo Island is actually where he's running around

02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:37.000
Wow that's crazy

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:39.000
All these mods man

02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:41.000
So apparently

02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:43.000
Some of our listeners

02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:45.000
I was worried about this because remember how Bobby tried to call us

02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:47.000
At the end of the show and it wouldn't work

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:49.000
But I'm on right now

02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:51.000
And I got the little green check mark

02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:53.000
Did you close it and open it again?

02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:55.000
I'm turning it off and then on again

02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:57.000
I have turned it off

02:25:57.000 --> 02:25:59.000
And I've now turned it back on

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:01.000
So we'll see if it'll work

02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:03.000
And what we'll do there

02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:05.000
We'll give it a minute just to see if anyone gets through

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:07.000
If not shoot

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:09.000
I should have had Plan B

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:11.000
Up and ready to go

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:13.000
But I didn't

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:15.000
But we can always I guess field questions from chat

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:17.000
If we have to do it that way but that's going to frustrate me

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:19.000
Because that's even worse

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:21.000
That's even worse than when Skype wouldn't work at all

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:23.000
At least I could kind of see that

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:25.000
So wait a minute

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:27.000
Did the recent count just go up?

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:31.000
Am I just not seeing the calls

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:33.000
Come through because I see that this person

02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:35.000
Has tried to call twice

02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:41.000
Do they have a way to turn off notifications or something?

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:43.000
I'm not sure

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:45.000
I'm not sure

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:51.000
It's that wonderful window

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:53.000
I went into tools options

02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:55.000
And it's like think think think

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:57.000
I'm trying to go into and this is the beauty of radio

02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:59.000
Everybody is that sometimes

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:01.000
Let's see uh yes

02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:03.000
I don't want sounds but notification setting

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:05.000
When somebody tries to

02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:07.000
Call me

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:09.000
Yes I should see that

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:11.000
Ugh

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:13.000
That's awful

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:17.000
Alright well

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:19.000
On our 700th episode

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:21.000
How appropriate that everything

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:23.000
Shutting down

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:25.000
I'm going to see

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:27.000
If I can quickly put together plan B

02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:29.000
Can you guys fill like two minutes?

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:31.000
Sure

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:33.000
Let me sign out of Skype here

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:35.000
While I put together plan B

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:37.000
The joys of live radio

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:39.000
Take it away low key in our soundtrack

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:41.000
Do you have any stories we haven't covered?

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:43.000
No I have not

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:45.000
It's very slow

02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:47.000
Well I can see what I can dig up

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:49.000
Umm

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:51.000
I've been building with Legos

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:53.000
While we've been doing this

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:55.000
See because they have wonderful programs

02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:57.000
One through Bricklink which is called

02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:59.000
Stud.io or Studio

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:01.000
And you can actually build stuff

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:03.000
With digital Legos basically

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:05.000
And what's kind of cool about it though

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:07.000
Is when you're done building it

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:09.000
You can build parts

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:11.000
So I decided as an experiment

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:13.000
Just to kind of learn the editor for this

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:15.000
I'm building my house

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:17.000
And so it's just been

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:19.000
Laying out floor plans

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:21.000
And stuff like that right now until I can

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:23.000
Get something that looks proportionally

02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:25.000
Correct

02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:27.000
Are you going to put your house in your house?

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:29.000
Yes

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:31.000
Actually my idea

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:33.000
My idea was if I can make

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:35.000
You know some good

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:37.000
Box that I would give them

02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:39.000
To my kids as Christmas gifts

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:41.000
Because they would have

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:43.000
Their own set and it would be cool

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:45.000
Cause one of the ones I was going to do

02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:47.000
Cause I really like the Lego movie

02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:49.000
Stuff where they had kind of the remix sets

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:51.000
So like they have one that's a fire

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:53.000
Truck mech

02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:55.000
And so my

02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:57.000
Son wanted a garbage truck

02:28:57.000 --> 02:28:59.000
Mech and I found a garbage truck

02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:01.000
Design that's one of their

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:03.000
Official sets that I thought that could work

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:05.000
Well for that with just a little bit of tweaking

02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:07.000
And so I'm

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:09.000
Going to do that eventually but right now

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:11.000
While I'm learning

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:13.000
How to actually use the editor I was going to start with something

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:15.000
Easier like my house

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:17.000
Which would be cool cause I just built

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:19.000
One of the creator sets

02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:21.000
The fish

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:23.000
Was the old fish shack or something like that

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:25.000
Fish store

02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:27.000
And that was pretty sweet

02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:29.000
Kind of gave me a lot of fun ideas

02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:31.000
This is all part of the stupid obsession crap that I have now

02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:33.000
God damn Legos man

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:35.000
I swear to god

02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:37.000
Such a mistake to

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:39.000
Shouldn't have gone to the Lego store

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:41.000
Should not have gone to the Lego store

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:43.000
But now I'm just like

02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:45.000
Running low on money because of stupid Legos

02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:47.000
I keep looking at that Millennium Falcon

02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:49.000
It's so expensive

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:51.000
And not really worth it

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:53.000
I mean it's worth it if you're a fan of

02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:55.000
Star Wars I'm not that big of a fan of

02:29:55.000 --> 02:29:57.000
Star Wars

02:29:57.000 --> 02:29:59.000
And here's the other problem too with those

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:01.000
A lot of the collector sets like the modular buildings

02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:03.000
One they're way overpriced

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:05.000
And two like

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:07.000
For like my kids plan like I wanted

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:09.000
I have the choice between

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:11.000
One of the modular buildings

02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:13.000
Or the fish store

02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:15.000
One that I got

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:17.000
And I went with the fish store one cause my son wanted a

02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:19.000
Diving mask for the mini figs

02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:21.000
And they had tons of them in there

02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:23.000
And so the only problem with the fish store

02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:25.000
Is it's meant as more of a

02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:27.000
Display piece

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:29.000
Than being able to play with it

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:31.000
Cause it's too tight to get your hand

02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:33.000
In there to actually move the

02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:35.000
Figures around or even the moveset

02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:37.000
It's just such a cramped thing

02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:39.000
And they even designed like the staircase going up to the office

02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:41.000
Where a mini fig can't even fit through there

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:43.000
So I wanted to make something

02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:45.000
More that they can actually

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:47.000
It's open and they can play with but it looks nice

02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:49.000
Okay I have Skype Plan B set up

02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:51.000
Alright cool

02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:53.000
I'm gonna hope it works

02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:55.000
But I don't know until we get a call

02:30:56.000 --> 02:30:58.000
So instead of Skype natively running through the computer

02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:00.000
What I've done is I went and grabbed my iPad

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:02.000
Which is a new iPad

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:04.000
It looks like it might be working so we're gonna see right now

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:06.000
If this actually works

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:08.000
If I hook it up this way taking the call through my iPad

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:10.000
I'm trying to take this call

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:12.000
And let's see if it works

02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:14.000
Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio who's this?

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:16.000
Yay Plan B works

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:18.000
Yay Plan B

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:20.000
Thank God

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:22.000
And we didn't need a prescription

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:24.000
Thank God for Plan B

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:26.000
Hey friend

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:28.000
Oh wait wait are we playing a cam game now?

02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:30.000
Are we really doing it?

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:32.000
We're on the iPad

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:34.000
I got video

02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:36.000
Hey he can see you too

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:38.000
The official alcoholic temperature

02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:40.000
Of Orange Launch Radio and the vlog

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:42.000
Fireball

02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:44.000
I think that is

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:46.000
Ewww veto

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:48.000
I think that is part of

02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:50.000
That might actually be a Brad reference

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:52.000
Brad from Pod Culture reference

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:54.000
Let me check

02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:56.000
I'm gonna check our audio out

02:31:56.000 --> 02:31:58.000
When it's running here

02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:00.000
Sorry Rama can you tell us a little more

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:02.000
About your drink that you're having there

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:06.000
Oh

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:08.000
Actually you are not even coming through

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:10.000
The recording at all

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:12.000
So

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:14.000
Our podcasters

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:16.000
Aren't even gonna hear them at all

02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:18.000
That's so stupid

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:20.000
Alright let's try this I'm gonna move them over here

02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:22.000
Oh

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:24.000
Oh no

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:26.000
I know what it is

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:28.000
I know what it is

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:30.000
Yes it's live radio what can I say

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:32.000
I'm having to go to Plan B

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:34.000
How about now

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:38.000
Now we can't hear them at all

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:42.000
Oh my God this is the worst day ever

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:44.000
No it's a great day

02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:46.000
It is a great day

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:48.000
Cause we ate cake

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:50.000
Line L mono

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:52.000

Labyrinth and I didn't dress to be video

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:12.000
Tonight so

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:14.000
I don't think anybody do but you know

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:16.000
We gotta put it on our best face

02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:18.000
That's right

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:20.000
And now this shot of

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:22.000
Fireball is to commemorate

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:30.000
Water or is it water

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:32.000
I'm not

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:34.000
I'm surprised you don't have a bottle of wine there

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:36.000
I'm kinda surprised I don't either

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:38.000
But maybe I think something about

02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:40.000
I'm actually gonna be giving you my bottles of

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:42.000
Moscato when I can't drink them anymore

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:44.000
Oh darn free wine what am I gonna do

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:46.000
It's good wine too

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:48.000
No she'll come over and help you drink that

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:50.000
Wine

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:52.000
Well Rama anything else you

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:54.000
Want to say here on episode 700 I appreciate

02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:56.000
You beta testing this whole

02:33:56.000 --> 02:33:58.000
Plan B setup but

02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:00.000
At least we know it works now

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:02.000
In IT a beta test is

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:04.000
Generally the real deal so it's all or nothing

02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:06.000
As a

02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:08.000
Famous YouTube viral clip once

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:10.000
Said fuck it we'll do it live

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:12.000
There you go and by the way

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:14.000
Metroid returns

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:16.000
Samus is fucking amazing

02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:18.000
That game is awesome and since we

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:20.000
Are on video I have a chance to show

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:22.000
The listeners that call in tonight the beauty

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:24.000
Of my Samus 3DS

02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:26.000
Which is amazing

02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:28.000
And I love it so

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:30.000
And I have to say I can't

02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:32.000
Give GameStop as much shit as I used

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:34.000
To because I got

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:36.000
A collector's edition from their store

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:38.000
On Saturday you can give them as much shit

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:40.000
As you want okay what's the I have to admit

02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:42.000
I missed the collector's edition so what is

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:44.000
In the collector's edition that's not in the regular

02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:46.000
Edition hold on let me see if I

02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:48.000
Can find it sure why not we'll do it live

02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:50.000
Here we go

02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:52.000
Alright he found it yep

02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:54.000
He's got his collector's edition he found

In chat also says I'll still give them shit

02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:00.000
Okay so it's one of those little paper boxes

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:02.000
But you know what they gave me

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:04.000
The collector's edition which is

02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:06.000
The soundtrack to the game nice

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:08.000
Oh can you drop box me that

02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:10.000

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:12.000
Alright thank you thank you

02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:14.000
And it's a normal

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:16.000
Cover but

02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:18.000
Oh that's where the flippy cover

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:20.000
Is huh yep

02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:22.000
Reversible so you can make it an original

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:24.000
Gameboy yeah I saw that

02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:26.000
And when I

02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:28.000
Went looking online just to see if I could

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:30.000
Make sure I could find it it seems in the UK

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:32.000
They got the legacy

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:34.000
Edition which was more stuff I'm like

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:36.000
Fuck yeah I thought I saw something on Twitter

02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:38.000
Where like this guy had like a ton

02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:40.000
Of that stuff it was like

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:42.000
There was a sculpture

02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:44.000
Amiibo it was all this crap

02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:46.000
This is awesome art book

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:48.000
Yeah but you know what

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:50.000
From GameStop I got a box

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:52.000
Of Reese's Puff cereal can't top that

02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:54.000
Why?

02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:56.000
I don't know I have a couple friends that work at

02:35:56.000 --> 02:35:58.000
GameStop I guess when you

02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:00.000
Picked up your copy of Metroid you got

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:02.000
No no Ramy you don't need to answer that

02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:04.000
Why the fuck not Loki

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:06.000
That's weird

02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:08.000
Why the fuck not

02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:10.000
Because it's weird

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:12.000
No it's not weird

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:14.000
Peanut butter is amazing in all forms and should be encouraged

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:16.000
There's a bottle

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:18.000
There's a thing of Jif right on top of my microwave

02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:20.000
Okay crunchy style

02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:22.000
Good times good times

02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:24.000
Alright my friend I'm gonna let you go to try and squeeze in some more calls since we lost some time here

02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:26.000
With the skype segment but

02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:28.000
I appreciate you as always hearts

02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:30.000
And good luck with everything on anime jam session this week

02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:32.000
Oh you got it you take care

02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:34.000
Yeah bro and play more Metroid

02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:36.000
Duh you don't have to tell me twice

02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:38.000
Alright see you my friend

02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:40.000
Alright bye

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:42.000
So skype now works if you want to give us a call

02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:44.000
At

02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:46.000
Orange Lounge Radio all one word on skype

02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:48.000
And we figured that out so again it is hooking up

02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:50.000
At my ipad

02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:52.000
Through my mixing board and what was happening

02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:54.000
There earlier is that I had him plugged into

02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:56.000
A port where admittedly it was the left channel

02:36:56.000 --> 02:36:58.000
Only but that's because only on

02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:00.000
Some things will it work on the

02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:02.000
Left and the right channel where it's mono

02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:04.000
And I fixed all that so

02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:06.000
Now they said the only bummer

02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:08.000
Is that if you don't actually catch a call

02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:10.000
You're gonna hear the ringing noise

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:12.000
I thought I'd picked up a call

02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:14.000
But apparently that didn't happen

02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:16.000
So if that person wants to call right back

02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:18.000
We'll try to get them on

02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:20.000
Again it's Orange Lounge Radio all one word on skype

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:22.000
I think the bummer about the ipad

02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:24.000
Is it takes a minute to connect

02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:26.000
Versus the other one

02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:28.000
Takes a minute to come through

02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:31.000
Live on our 700th episode

02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:33.000
Of Orange Lounge Radio

02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:37.000
Whew

02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:39.000
So house-ception I only overheard part of that conversation

02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:41.000
You're gonna give it to your kids someday

02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:43.000
Well I thought about like it would be cool to like

02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:45.000
Design a set

02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:47.000
For my kids that's like unique

02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:49.000
I like that

02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:51.000
That's a good idea alright let's see if maybe this call

02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:53.000
Is coming through now I think it is

02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:55.000
Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this

02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:57.000
Hi this is Elliot B

02:37:57.000 --> 02:37:59.000
Are you calling all the way from overseas

02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:01.000
Or are you still in New York now

02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:03.000
No I'm still in New York although it is a bit late here

02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:05.000
It's a little bit later but not like crazy later

02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:07.000
Well welcome to the show thanks for being here

02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:09.000
Yeah hey it's great to see you guys on camera

02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:11.000
Thank you

02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:13.000
Happy 700th

02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:15.000
We weren't supposed to be but things being as they are

02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:17.000
That's how it worked

02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:19.000
So thank you very much

02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:21.000
What's on your mind tonight

02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:23.000
It was actually my birthday today

02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:25.000
One minute left of it

02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:27.000
Happy birthday

02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:29.000
It is my good pal

02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:31.000
It's his birthday today too

02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:33.000
He was one of the hosts of Koopa Club

02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:35.000
When that show was still around

02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:37.000
So toast to birthdays

02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:41.000
What's on your mind tonight

02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:43.000
Well so I actually want to talk music games

02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:45.000
Please

02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:47.000
I managed to find

02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:49.000
I was in a second hand game shop

02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:51.000
In New York

02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:53.000
And found a second hand copy

02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:55.000
For $20

02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:57.000
Did it have the controller with it too?

02:38:57.000 --> 02:38:59.000
Right so not only

02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:01.000
Did it come with a controller it came with two

02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:03.000
Turn tables and a mic

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:05.000
Oh nice

02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:07.000
Bexong two turn tables and a microphone

02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:09.000
That was like a collector's edition at one point

02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:11.000
Wasn't there like a collector's edition you could buy

02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:13.000
They had the one that was

02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:15.000
The collector's edition

02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:17.000
Actually had like a case

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:19.000
That turned into a table

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:21.000
So it had like a fold out thing

02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:23.000
To put the actual turn tables on

02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:25.000
That is a

02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:27.000
DJ Hero 2 is like severely

02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:29.000
Underrated as far as music games

02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:31.000
Go too because well have you had a chance to play it?

02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:33.000
Yeah yeah quite a bit

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:35.000
What do you think? I was playing it this weekend

02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:37.000
I really like it I mean it's very very technical

02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:39.000
I was surprised by how

02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:41.000
How complex the controls are how many

02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:43.000
Buttons and knobs and

02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:45.000
Sliders there are

02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:47.000
You know there's so many kind of things

02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:49.000
I'm used to kind of you know Guitar Hero

02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:51.000
Where you're just like you've got five notes

02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:53.000
And then maybe the hammer-ons and stuff

02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:55.000
And here you've got like you've got a crossfade

02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:57.000
And you've got to turn the dial

02:39:57.000 --> 02:39:59.000
And you've got to scratch in different ways

02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:01.000
And yeah

02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:03.000
Yeah it's very different it's not like Beatmania

02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:05.000
2DX which is really easy to compare

02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:07.000
To be right there's a lot of other stuff

02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:09.000
That goes on but I think

02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:11.000
That game is tragically underrated

02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:13.000
Really and it just kind of it kind of fell

02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:15.000
Out because they oversaturated

02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:17.000
What was going on with Guitar Hero

02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:19.000
And Band Hero and all that stuff kind of

02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:21.000
Kind of oversaturated that market

02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:23.000
And it's a real bummer that DJ Hero kind of paid

02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:25.000
The price for that because that series is awesome

02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:27.000
And I really love the concept of

02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:29.000
Mixing the two songs together I think some of the

02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:31.000
Remixes that came out of those games are like the best

02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:33.000
I don't remember if it was in the game itself

02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:35.000
Or it was DLC but there is like a

02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:37.000
There's a Mary J. Blige versus

02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:39.000
Queen it's

02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:41.000
It's all of

02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:43.000
Me and Radio Gaga I think

02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:45.000
That is such a good mix

02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:47.000
It's so good

02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:49.000
Like that is like

02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:51.000
That song is like one of my favorite things to come out of

02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:53.000
A music game ever

02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:55.000
Oh I have to look out for that no I don't think I've unlocked it yet

02:40:55.000 --> 02:40:57.000
Yeah either it might be

02:40:57.000 --> 02:40:59.000
See I feel like it might have been in DLC but

02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:01.000
Hopefully the DLC is still out there

02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:03.000
Yeah I really like the fact

02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:05.000
That it likes to do freestyle and stuff

02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:07.000
The improvisational aspects

02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:09.000
Like is missing from so many music

02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:11.000
Games there's no creation going on

02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:13.000
Right and you know it may just be

02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:15.000
Like playing samples to a beat

02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:17.000
But that bit is so much fun

02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:19.000
It's so rewarding

02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:21.000
Oh yeah it's great and yeah

02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:23.000
The fact that some music games that are done today

02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:25.000
Are kind of done a little bit lazier

02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:27.000
Where they're not really key sounded

02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:29.000
And I think with DJ Hero you had those key sounds

02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:31.000
So it's like if you were playing things off beat

02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:33.000
Or you are freestyling the key sounds

02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:35.000
Would kind of come out in the game and I think it's

02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:37.000
So much more effective than some of these lazier

02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:39.000
Music games that don't really

02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:41.000
Like you don't notice when you make mistakes if that makes sense

02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:43.000
Yeah exactly

02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:45.000
Well Elliot I'm very jealous

02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:47.000
Of your fine there

02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:49.000
Only 20 bucks for that

02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:51.000
I'm going to have to keep my eye out at some of the local thrift stores

02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:53.000
And see if maybe I can find a version of that

02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:55.000
Of course I don't even

02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:57.000
GameStop has that stuff

02:41:57.000 --> 02:41:59.000
Do they?

02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:01.000
I bought DJ Hero 2 because I already had the turntables

02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:03.000
I bought a copy for like 2 dollars

02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:05.000
I bought mine really cheap too

02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:07.000
At a dimple

02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:09.000
I wish there was a way to play it on Xbox One

02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:11.000
But see there's been too many changes

02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:13.000
With the last gen

02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:15.000
Was it on PC?

02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:17.000
No well it was wireless

02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:19.000
I have a

02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:21.000
I had a demo

02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:23.000
Controller

02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:25.000
So one of my controllers is wireless

02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:27.000
One of them is wired

02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:29.000
Which they never made a wired controller for that

02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:31.000
But I bought the

02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:33.000
Was it the

02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:35.000
Demo unit because I got it early

02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:37.000
With 3 songs

02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:39.000
Alright well we'll have to keep our eyes peeled

02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:41.000
But Elliot it's good to hear from you

02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:43.000
Thanks for calling in on this episode tonight

02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:45.000
Yeah congrats, happy anniversary

02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:47.000
Isn't anniversary? Happy big number

02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:49.000
Happy big number, I think that's a good way to put it

02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:51.000
There was cake, happy cake

02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:53.000
Indeed, yeah

02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:55.000
It was weird cake, I saw it on Twitter

02:42:55.000 --> 02:42:57.000
Awesome, alright you take care my friend, thanks for calling

02:42:57.000 --> 02:42:59.000
Bye, have a good night

02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:01.000
Alright, Orange Lounge Radio

02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:03.000
All one word on Skype if you want to get through

02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:05.000
I could probably squeeze in one more call here

02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:07.000
Before we wrap things up for the night

02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:09.000
And I think we have one coming in right now

02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:11.000
So I'm going to try to take it

02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:13.000
If it will connect, if the video will go through

02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:15.000
Of course I'm hitting the button

02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:17.000
And the iPad takes a little bit longer than the PC

02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:19.000
Does to do this, but when the PC doesn't work

02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:21.000
This is what you use, but I think we're finally connected

02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:23.000
Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:25.000
Hey this is Raginator

02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:27.000
Hey Raginator, good to hear from you, what's up my friend?

02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:29.000
Not much, well first

02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:31.000
Just want to say happy

02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:33.000
700

02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:35.000
And with any luck

02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:37.000
You guys will make it to at least

02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:41.000
1337

02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:43.000
So we can officially be elite

02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:45.000
Yeah, how many, let's see

02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:47.000
If it took us 15 years to get this far

02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:49.000
Then it would probably take us about another 15 years

02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:51.000
To get that far

02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:53.000
So we would be looking at

02:43:53.000 --> 02:43:55.000
First off I would be pushing

02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:57.000
I would be 54 years old

02:43:57.000 --> 02:43:59.000
At that point

02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:01.000
And it would be the year 2032

02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:03.000
If I'm not mistaken

02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:05.000
And Half Life 3 still won't be out

02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:07.000
And Half Life 3 still won't be out

02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:09.000
So

02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:11.000
Now

02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:13.000
I did have a

02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:15.000
Question in my

02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:17.000
Right now

02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:19.000
It's kind of eluding me

02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:21.000
While I was trying to conduct

02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:23.000
But

02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:25.000
Now

02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:27.000
I know

02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:29.000
This is going to be really

02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:31.000
I'm making a

02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:33.000
Lousy radio

02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:35.000
Because I'm doing picture

02:44:35.000 --> 02:44:37.000
But I mean

02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:39.000
No secret that

02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:41.000
I've been having PC

02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:43.000
PC problems

02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:45.000
Yeah

02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:47.000
This is the kind of connector that

02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:49.000
My new fan

02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:51.000
Found on my computer

02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:53.000
It looks like there's a tiny little plug

02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:55.000
With three pins on it

02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:57.000
And a big old honking

02:44:57.000 --> 02:44:59.000
Four pins on it

02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:01.000
Let's see if I can

02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:03.000
Aim it on the inside of my computer

02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:05.000
I don't see many places

02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:07.000
Where I can plug

02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:09.000
This is totally

02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:11.000
This is totally a tech support call

02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:13.000
Going on right now

02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:15.000
Yeah I don't see anything

02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:17.000
Right where that fan

02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:19.000
Can plug in

02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:21.000
Do you?

02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:23.000
No because it's too fucking dark

02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:25.000
I can't see anything in that picture

02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:27.000
They plug in out of the power supply

02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:29.000
So if you have a modular power supply

02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:31.000
You may be able to do that

02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:33.000
Or the other thing you can do too

02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:35.000
Is you can buy just at a PC store

02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:37.000
Like a splitter

02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:39.000
So it will have a splitter that will be able to

02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:41.000
You plug it in and you can split it off

02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:43.000
To build

02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:45.000
You may not have

02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:47.000
See on yours

02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:49.000
If you're using a modular supply with like

02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:51.000
SATA drives

02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:53.000
You may not have the old molex connectors

02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:55.000
Because they don't use those anymore

02:45:55.000 --> 02:45:57.000
For the SATA drives

02:45:57.000 --> 02:45:59.000
I would check if you still have

02:45:59.000 --> 02:46:01.000
If it is a modular

02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:03.000
Power supply

02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:05.000
You may have some cables

02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:07.000
For those molex connectors

02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:09.000
They should have something or at the very least

02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:11.000
There's

02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:13.000
Something you can

02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:15.000
Possibly buy to split it

02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:17.000
Or if you really want to you can cut it

02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:19.000
And splice it in there

02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:21.000
Hey look you're getting offers from our chat

02:46:21.000 --> 02:46:23.000
Rama says if you send the photos

02:46:23.000 --> 02:46:25.000
He'll link you to everything you need

02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:27.000
Chatters helping chatters

02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:29.000
I love it

02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:31.000
Now to try to bring this

02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:33.000
Call back to actual gaming

02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:35.000
Not tech support

02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:37.000
Now

02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:39.000
Now

02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:41.000
One thing

02:46:41.000 --> 02:46:43.000
You may have been noticing

02:46:43.000 --> 02:46:45.000
Is that

02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:47.000
Is the way I've been talking more and more

02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:49.000
About

02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:51.000
GLG.com and probably

02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:53.000
A little bit less about Steam

02:46:53.000 --> 02:46:55.000
Not to have anything

02:46:55.000 --> 02:46:57.000
Against Steam you know I love

02:46:57.000 --> 02:46:59.000
A lot of you got me started on

02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:01.000
Steam

02:47:01.000 --> 02:47:03.000
Is there any

02:47:03.000 --> 02:47:05.000
On games on

02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:07.000
GOG that may not

02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:09.000
Necessarily be on Steam

02:47:09.000 --> 02:47:11.000
That you would recommend

02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:13.000
That you know either I

02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:15.000
Or

02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:17.000
Listeners in general may be

02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:19.000
Overlooking

02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:49.000
Good old Civilization game

02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:51.000
Especially the original if not some of the sequels

02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:53.000
I really wish those would show up on

02:47:53.000 --> 02:47:55.000
Good old games

02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:57.000
I know Colonization showed up

02:47:57.000 --> 02:47:59.000
Which is pretty good

02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:01.000
I haven't played that one through GOG myself

02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:03.000
But that is

02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:05.000
I think they have not only

02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:07.000
The actual original

02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:09.000
Colonization game from the late 90's

02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:11.000
But I think they have the reimagining

02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:13.000
They did around Civ IV

02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:15.000
Because Civ IV they did like a

02:48:15.000 --> 02:48:17.000
Colonization but yeah

02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:19.000
Anything with Sid Meier's name in the title I'd recommend

02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:21.000
I think Alpha Centauri is on Good old games too

02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:23.000
Yeah I'm not

02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:25.000
Actually I'm not

02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:27.000
Too terribly positive

02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:29.000
But I'm

02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:31.000
Just like

02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:33.000
64 chance

02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:35.000
In favor of at least

02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:37.000
Civ III be on

02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:39.000
GOG

02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:41.000
You know I'm

02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:43.000
Reasonably sure that

02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:45.000
They did have a

02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:47.000
Promotion where

02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:49.000
Now you can

02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:51.000
Buy it

02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:53.000
Add it

02:48:53.000 --> 02:48:55.000
On the

02:48:55.000 --> 02:48:57.000
Front page

02:48:57.000 --> 02:48:59.000
Yeah

02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:01.000
I'm noticing too some other recommendations

02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:03.000
From chat where Dungeon Buster says the gold

02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:05.000
Box series from SSI on GOG

02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:07.000
Is good but is really hardcore

02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:09.000
CRPG's

02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:11.000
There you go

02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:13.000
I think again the old

02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:15.000
Oh Castles

02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:17.000
Is another old game I bought on there because I used to play that game on PC

02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:19.000
Like a long time ago I think it was actually Castles 2

02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:21.000
But yeah

02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:23.000
Dip in the archive of old

02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:25.000
Shit from the 90's you're gonna find a gold mine

02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:27.000
Alright

02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:29.000
Well I'm sure

02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:31.000
I'm taking up way too much of your time

02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:33.000
There's probably some other people

02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:35.000
That want to call but

02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:37.000
Have a nice day and thanks for all the years

02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:39.000
That you've been doing the show

02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:41.000
Definitely been making my Sunday nights

02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:43.000
You are most welcome

02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:45.000
My friend appreciate the call

02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:47.000
In and good luck with Rama

02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:49.000
Solving the tech support issue which now Rama is offering

02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:51.000
To do a live tech support show

02:49:51.000 --> 02:49:53.000
Here at VoG I think it would be great

02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:55.000
I'd love it so alright take care my friend

02:49:55.000 --> 02:49:57.000
Alright have a good one bye

02:49:57.000 --> 02:49:59.000
Actually you know if there's not enough calls for tech

02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:01.000
Support oops if I don't mute it then you guys

02:50:01.000 --> 02:50:03.000
Hear all the Skype noises sorry

02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:05.000
What you're using Skype this is totally

02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:07.000
Unprofessional man

02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:09.000
I don't listen to this show anymore

02:50:09.000 --> 02:50:11.000
So yeah I mean you guys

02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:13.000
If they were to do a show like that I think it would be

02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:15.000
Hilarious even if they didn't just do tech support

02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:17.000
Cause you know there's probably not gonna be enough people

02:50:17.000 --> 02:50:19.000
Listening really in all realness

02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:21.000
To fix all the tech problems but

02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:23.000
They could do you know tech advice

02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:25.000
And tech help and

02:50:25.000 --> 02:50:27.000
Life hacks if you will

02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:29.000
Or computer hacks I don't know anyway

02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:31.000
So I don't think we're gonna

02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:33.000
Get any other calls so I think I'm gonna go ahead and shut off

02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:35.000
The Skype line for now which I guess to do that

02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:37.000
I would just swipe up there it is

02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:39.000
Skype is done alright

02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:41.000
So that's gonna do it for the Skype line tonight

02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:43.000
Thanks for those that called in I'm very sorry

02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:45.000
If you didn't get through especially if it was because of all the

02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:47.000
Technical failures we were having early on

02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:49.000
But you live you learn that'll be

02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:51.000
The theme of 700 more episodes

02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:53.000
Hopefully of Orange Lounge

02:50:53.000 --> 02:50:55.000
Radio I don't think we had

02:50:55.000 --> 02:50:57.000
Any other last minute stories right Loki?

02:50:57.000 --> 02:50:59.000
So I think it's about time for us to wrap up hey

02:50:59.000 --> 02:51:01.000
I wanna thank you guys for listening

02:51:01.000 --> 02:51:03.000
To Orange Lounge Radio over these years

02:51:03.000 --> 02:51:05.000
Thank you again so much for

02:51:05.000 --> 02:51:07.000
Everything over these last 700 episodes

02:51:07.000 --> 02:51:09.000
And we're gonna keep going right on going with

02:51:09.000 --> 02:51:11.000
Episode 701 next week

02:51:11.000 --> 02:51:13.000
Cause who needs a life?

02:51:13.000 --> 02:51:15.000
And Dark Sakura is missing

02:51:15.000 --> 02:51:17.000
People smacking each other with leather

02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:19.000
To be here next

02:51:19.000 --> 02:51:21.000
Week so y'all better respect that so

02:51:21.000 --> 02:51:23.000
Anyway

02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:25.000
Thank you for listening to Orange Lounge Radio

02:51:25.000 --> 02:51:27.000
If you enjoyed what you heard here at the show

02:51:27.000 --> 02:51:29.000
Please consider telling a friend or five

02:51:29.000 --> 02:51:31.000
About the show help us spread the word

02:51:31.000 --> 02:51:33.000
Because we are the show where every gamer has a voice

02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:35.000
But only if the voices are here

02:51:35.000 --> 02:51:37.000
To be participating with the show

02:51:37.000 --> 02:51:39.000
A nice five star review on a place like iTunes

02:51:39.000 --> 02:51:41.000
Or Google Play or wherever you found this show

02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:43.000
Those all go a long long way

02:51:43.000 --> 02:51:45.000
As well

02:51:45.000 --> 02:51:47.000
I wanna say this that if you want to honor

02:51:47.000 --> 02:51:49.000
Our episode 700

02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:51.000
Then everyone take at least

02:51:51.000 --> 02:51:53.000
Seven dollars

02:51:53.000 --> 02:51:55.000
And donate it to your local LGBTQ

02:51:55.000 --> 02:51:57.000
Center

02:51:57.000 --> 02:51:59.000
Do that for us

02:51:59.000 --> 02:52:01.000
Hey I like that idea

02:52:01.000 --> 02:52:03.000
Or buy me booze

02:52:03.000 --> 02:52:05.000
No I'm just kidding

02:52:05.000 --> 02:52:07.000
Dark Sakura's got a way better suggestion

02:52:07.000 --> 02:52:09.000
I'm just gonna give you booze

02:52:09.000 --> 02:52:11.000
Dungeon Buster in chat says thank you for spending your gaming

02:52:11.000 --> 02:52:13.000
Passion and time with us

02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:15.000
Thank you, you're welcome

02:52:15.000 --> 02:52:17.000
Alright let's go right into everybody's final

02:52:17.000 --> 02:52:19.000
Thoughts for tonight and then we'll bring it back

02:52:19.000 --> 02:52:21.000
With episode 701 next week

02:52:21.000 --> 02:52:23.000
I guess I'll go first and my final thought is

02:52:23.000 --> 02:52:25.000
I really need to hang these lights up already

02:52:25.000 --> 02:52:27.000
The Dark Sakura bought me like two months ago

02:52:27.000 --> 02:52:29.000
But I'm really lazy y'all

02:52:29.000 --> 02:52:31.000
I need a complete

02:52:31.000 --> 02:52:33.000
Actually this whole studio needs to be redecorated

02:52:33.000 --> 02:52:35.000
Because seriously we got posters up

02:52:35.000 --> 02:52:37.000
You never did put up the thing that the poster I gave you either

02:52:37.000 --> 02:52:39.000
The scroll

02:52:39.000 --> 02:52:41.000
The Mega Man scroll

02:52:41.000 --> 02:52:43.000
Oh yeah I haven't hung anything new up in here

02:52:43.000 --> 02:52:45.000
I've still got a poster for Final Fantasy 11

02:52:45.000 --> 02:52:47.000
Online

02:52:47.000 --> 02:52:49.000
What is that? That's a poster for Pop and Music 11

02:52:49.000 --> 02:52:51.000
On the Playstation 2

02:52:51.000 --> 02:52:53.000
But it's autographed

02:52:53.000 --> 02:52:55.000
No it just looks like it is

02:52:55.000 --> 02:52:57.000
I think it's autographed

02:52:57.000 --> 02:52:59.000
The Borderlands one is autographed

02:52:59.000 --> 02:53:01.000
This is Cody got us this Borderlands one

02:53:01.000 --> 02:53:03.000
He met all that team locally

02:53:03.000 --> 02:53:05.000
Anyway let's get around

02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:07.000
And get final thoughts from everybody else

02:53:07.000 --> 02:53:09.000
That was mine so Loki your final thought

02:53:09.000 --> 02:53:11.000
I guess I'm building

02:53:11.000 --> 02:53:13.000
Or playing the Lego thing tonight

02:53:13.000 --> 02:53:15.000
Yay Lego thing tonight

02:53:15.000 --> 02:53:17.000
And lastly

02:53:17.000 --> 02:53:19.000
But not leastly Dark Sakura

02:53:19.000 --> 02:53:21.000
I don't know

02:53:21.000 --> 02:53:23.000
I don't know

02:53:23.000 --> 02:53:25.000
What a perfect note to end on

02:53:25.000 --> 02:53:27.000
We'll see you next time with

02:53:27.000 --> 02:53:29.000
