00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
This week Sega does what Nintendo and improves it with an official collaboration between Sonic Forces and Hooters

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Hopefully this goes better than when they partner with Soap Shoes

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We have plenty more news from The Week in Gaming and it all starts right now on the show where every gamer has a voice

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Live tonight with episode number 701 for this September the 24th of 2017

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me on Twitter at Skie

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I am joined in studio every week, each and every week with DarkSakura usually

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
But sadly she's not here tonight, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers is recovering from a cold

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Some type of sick, I think it was a cold, I'm a bad friend, I don't remember exactly what it is she had

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I think it was summer flu or something

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So whatever it was, it sounded like it was bad so we hope she feels better soon

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
She said she's feeling better today but she's still kind of like, I don't really want to get you guys sick

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And you know, doing the show, it does take a little bit of energy and so forth

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So DarkSakura just wants to take the night off to get better and we understand that

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
And the voice you just heard there of course joining me here, Techmaster Loki

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Hello, I'm here

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Hi Loki, how are you?

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm fine

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Yeah? Not sick, that's good right?

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I think just allergies but other than that

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
What else is new living here in lovely Sacramento, California where our show is based

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
That would be the capital folks if you've never heard of it

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Arnold Schwarzenegger once had a job here, it was in the news for that anyway

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So you're full of breadsticks tonight

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Yep

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Once again, they're quoting 20 minutes and it takes 40 minutes for them to make fucking breadsticks

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I know it takes 5 minutes to make

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It's because they're under, well they're going to be under new management

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
They had a sign that said they got sold to another corporation

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Yeah I was going to say, when was the last time you were there you said I'm not going back there anymore

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Well I wasn't going to go back there yet and I decided

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Because I was going to pick something else to eat

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And then I was like I can't decide what I want so I was like ok I'll just do breadsticks

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'll give them another go

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And sure enough they fuck it up again

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It's like, dude you guys come on

41
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I can see you guys back there just fucking off

42
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You're just like talking and not hurting, there's no hustle

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Something the listeners should understand is that you're not just being one of those

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'd like to speak to your manager individuals but you actually used to work at the same pizza chain

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Yes I used to work

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
That was your minimum wage job

47
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It wasn't at this particular round table but it was another one

48
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I did everything from washing dishes to working the counter to making pizzas

49
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
To breaking down the oven and cleaning it

50
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You did it all

51
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
To management, I was a shift manager at one time

52
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Oh my god guys can you imagine Loki as your boss

53
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I yelled a lot yes

54
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It was a mutual understanding

55
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So we do tape live every Sunday night at the voice of geeks network

56
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
vognetwork.com

57
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show

58
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And speaking of Bobby, he was having a conversation on his show tonight

59
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
He was talking about a big topic in gaming tonight which we'll get into a little bit later

60
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
About the whole deal that's going on with Player Unknown Battlegrounds

61
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Which is a game that obviously I've seen that it's popular on Twitch

62
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Only $29.99 apparently

63
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And usually when I drop in on streams I'm kind of like, I don't really get it

64
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
But I've had more and more people especially since we have a Discord server now

65
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
That's actually been fairly active

66
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
And if you want to join our Discord server please

67
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Over at vognetwork.com slash Discord you can join in

68
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
More and more people are saying like Rob you should really check this game out

69
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Well sadly I didn't do that this week

70
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
But I did go and I watched some more streamers

71
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And I kind of made myself watch a little more of it

72
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
And I was like okay, I get this game a little more

73
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
But something that Bobby brought up on his show tonight was the whole tagline that you get for winning

74
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
The winner winner chicken dinner

75
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
That's a common saying out there

76
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Is that like a regional thing?

77
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Do they say that far and wide?

78
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Would they know what I mean in Canada

79
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
If I said that little jingle

80
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I don't know, is that worldwide? I don't know

81
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
But I was thinking in your case Loki

82
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Maybe the game should allow you to customize

83
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Maybe that could be a micro transaction

84
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
That you could pick your own dinner

85
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And so Loki when you win in PUBG

86
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You could get winner winner breadstick dinner

87
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm fine with chicken, it's more sense

88
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
We don't need to appeal to a mass audience here

89
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
What about a winner winner turducken dinner

90
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Winner winner bacon dinner

91
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I feel like there's a market here

92
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
That PUBG creators should be listening to

93
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
No, no

94
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Because they already have micro transactions in the game

95
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Well as I said we do tape live Sunday nights at the voice geeks network

96
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And you guys can chat along with us and participate with our show

97
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Because we are the show where every gamer has a voice

98
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And we invite you guys to sit down with us every week

99
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Over at live.vognetwork.com

100
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Where we do have our live chatters going

101
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Come on Nolga starts us off tonight saying

102
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I can relate Loki

103
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I used to work at a Starbucks and I can't stand

104
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
When baristas don't steam milk

105
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
The way that they are trained to do it

106
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Oh man I went into a Starbucks once with my friend

107
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
That used to work at one and I swear

108
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
She was about to have a breakdown

109
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Because everything was disorganized in the store

110
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Stuff was everywhere and she was like

111
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
How the fuck are they getting away with this order

112
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It usually works to their benefit

113
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Because I'm more patient because I understand

114
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I've been there I'm not gonna get mad at you

115
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Because it's not in your control

116
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
But dude I mean come on

117
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
There's a guy like he's like I need a box

118
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I just need a small box

119
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
And the guy that's like cutting you know the pizzas

120
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And putting them boxes just staring right at him

121
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It's like are you gonna fucking do something

122
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Like maybe ask him what he wants

123
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Are you gonna say hey there's someone at the counter

124
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Maybe someone back here that's fucking around

125
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Maybe like go help him

126
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I think one of these days you need to put on your old

127
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Uniform under what you're wearing

128
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Oh I don't have any more

129
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Dude those uniforms are fucking

130
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Crusted full like nasty ass

131
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You know pizza sauce

132
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's just like it

133
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
No it's not a thing that I would

134
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Want to wear again but

135
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
No those got thrown out a while ago

136
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
No seriously it's

137
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I get it I get it

138
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's like you guys may or may not know

139
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I trained for a call center for many many years

140
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
This was the job that I did

141
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
And so when I call

142
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Like call centers I usually have a lot of patience

143
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
From people on the line because I know you know what they're

144
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Going through and so forth and I never lose

145
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
My shit with somebody on the phone

146
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
If even if I'm upset I'm gonna

147
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'm gonna start off by saying like

148
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'm really upset that this is happening

149
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I know it's not your fault but is there anything

150
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You can do to help me like I always you know kind of

151
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Be nice about it like I'm pissed but I'm not pissed

152
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
At you which trust me those folks

153
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Really appreciate

154
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
But I get it but then when I get like the really

155
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Lazy where it's like I totally

156
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Know this person is like trying to shoo me off the line

157
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Doesn't care does it like I get

158
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Really frustrated and I never

159
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I never yell I still don't yell I'm not that type

160
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I just hang up and call back and get somebody else

161
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Right like they were cool like last

162
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Time that that happened you know they

163
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
The manager actually did call me and leave a message

164
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Later on and like he was probably

165
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Gonna like they already caught me that one

166
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Time so I was like that's fine

167
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You took care of it then I don't need to talk to your

168
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Manager to say hey

169
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You guys are slow in this particular instance

170
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I don't like I don't like to make a fuss

171
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
There's no point in doing that it's not gonna accomplish anything

172
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
But some people love to make a fuss and it's always like oh god

173
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Oh yeah I know I know

174
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
So awkward stop making a fuss

175
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
So many I know the owner

176
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And they would come in like they would

177
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Fucking like there's one family

178
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
They claim they knew the owner

179
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
They did know the owner and we

180
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Knew them all like everybody in the store

181
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Knew them cause every time they'd come in

182
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
They would complain about their pizza

183
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Doesn't matter what they ordered

184
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
They would have a complaint about it cause they were trying to get it for free

185
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Every time

186
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
So fucking annoying

187
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
But yes those people do exist

188
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Alright we will get to video games

189
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I promise but I wanted to read some more comments

190
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
And chat over at live.voggenetwork.com

191
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Let's see

192
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Tigerclaw asks why does it always have to be chicken dinner

193
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
What if you want a steak dinner?

194
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
That's what I'm saying

195
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Like you know a steak dinner that's a reward

196
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Like when I get to go to Ruth Chris

197
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Like I'm putting on my slacks

198
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
To go out to the restaurant

199
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Like this is fine dining tonight

200
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
So yeah I'm good for steak dinner

201
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Let's see

202
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Somebody is oh yeah Dungeon Buster suggested

203
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Loki on the next undercover boss

204
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And come on Noel Gus says

205
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Loki's game needs to be a food service worker

206
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
VR simulator

207
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Well that's kind of I mean I guess they have job simulator

208
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
But that's kind of that's different

209
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It's already been done so well

210
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
That's a perfect example recent example

211
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Of food service worker VR game

212
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
That's fucking weird because

213
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
We haven't had a food

214
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
A weird food service game in a while since like

215
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Sneak King but if anyone's

216
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Watched videos of the VR

217
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
KFC

218
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Chicken Fry game that is

219
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Fucking weird and I need a full game

220
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Of that because that's just like crazy

221
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
That came up on the show a couple weeks ago yeah

222
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
There's a really fun game that one of my

223
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Buddies on Twitch streams and I can't

224
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Remember the name of it which is horrible

225
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
But it's like one of those food service games

226
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And you have the ingredients that and people

227
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Come up to the table and you have to put it all together

228
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And all that stuff and that was you know it kind of reminded

229
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Me of that only job simulator where you can just fuck it

230
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
All up because you know it's a robot

231
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It was something that started with an O

232
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
And it would be not overcooked not that one

233
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It's something else had like a four three or four word

234
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Title and this was like part two and it was

235
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Something new so maybe maybe no

236
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It wasn't overcooked unfortunate something else

237
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I know that one um yeah anyway

238
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Sorry I can't I don't always

239
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Remember the name of every single game out there

240
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Is that it yes MXC

241
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Is right it's cook serve delicious that is the name

242
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Of it it was cook good job MXC

243
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Winner winner steak dinner MXC

244
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It's cook serve delicious that's the name of it

245
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
So yeah that one's uh

246
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
That one looked fun so that's one you could try

247
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Because not only do you have to cook the food

248
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
But then all of a sudden like instead of a food order coming in

249
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It'll come in and go bing the toilet's backed

250
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Up you gotta go fix it bing

251
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
The dumpsters full out back

252
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
So you have to go and like the part of the keystrokes you do is like

253
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Stomp the dumpster down

254
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Like everything so I thought it was funny

255
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Or the rat traps have to be

256
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Reset or just like other like random shit

257
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Comes in in addition to the food and I thought that was

258
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Funny so yeah I watched a

259
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Buddy of mine playing it on twitch and I was like oh maybe I'll

260
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Get this this will be fun so

261
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Alright anyhow

262
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Guys you don't suggest

263
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Overwatch no that's a different game

264
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
We'll get into that during gaming weeks but

265
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
First let's get to our kickoff topic tonight

266
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Believe it or not we're not just going to talk about

267
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Food service but we want to talk a little bit about

268
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Tokyo Game Show was this past week

269
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Which was mainly

270
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
A Sony affair I mean

271
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Not exclusively obviously you have a lot of

272
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Third party developers showing the stuff

273
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
They're doing for maybe mobile phones

274
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
And so forth but um

275
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
With Microsoft you know in

276
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Japan not really being a thing and

277
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Nintendo sitting out Tokyo Game Show

278
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It really is Sony's to kind of drive so that's

279
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Why they did a big press conference which was

280
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
What it was Tuesday in Japan

281
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Right but it was yeah like Tuesday at 6

282
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Third time but it was Monday at midnight

283
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
For us yeah and I didn't

284
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Like this is one of those rare occasions where I have to

285
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Really thank Twitter because I

286
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Excuse me I totally forgot that this was

287
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
The thing that was going to be on until

288
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Twitter was like hey here's the YouTube stream

289
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Stream with the English translation

290
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Of the people on stage didn't translate

291
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
The trailers but it was enough you could understand

292
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
What was going on so I actually watched

293
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I mean I only missed the very very beginning

294
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Where I guess they had some type of song or something

295
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I totally missed that thing but I saw

296
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Yeah it was just a sizzle reel

297
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Yeah I saw the bulk of it and I was I

298
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I liked it dare I say I was more

299
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Engaged than I was with E3

300
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Because I felt like we saw

301
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
More like new things

302
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
As opposed to you know my disappointment

303
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
With this year's E3 is that it really felt like it was

304
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Shorter and it was like it was kind of like an update

305
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
A thon but you know there were updates

306
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
In this too don't get me wrong but there were some other things

307
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I saw in it where I was like ooh cat butt

308
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I want to see how they're going to do that which obviously I'm talking about

309
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Nicole Atsume is getting a VR version

310
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Which that was kind of out of left field

311
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I mean I don't think there were a lot of like huge surprises

312
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Well actually no I take that back there were kind of some big surprises

313
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Like Zone of the Enders

314
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Getting a VR release

315
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
That's a very interesting direction from Konami

316
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Where you have to think

317
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
At this point that Konami

318
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Is well aware of

319
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
What's going on on the internet

320
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Like somebody at this point

321
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Has found out that Konami is not popular

322
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
People are saying fuck you Konami

323
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
This is brand new information

324
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
They are not happy with the way we are doing things

325
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
So I do feel like

326
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Konami is kind of like

327
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I feel like in a way they might be doing

328
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Some soul searching right now

329
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
What isn't working for us

330
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Fucking over Hideo Kojima that's not working for us

331
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
What is working for us

332
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Making the old shit new again

333
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Right and that's why you see

334
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Well I mean it's working in television too

335
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Like fucking Will and Grace is back on TV this week

336
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
But anyway

337
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
What was I going to say

338
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Everything is old is new again

339
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Final Fantasy 9

340
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Nah not just that dammit

341
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I lost my train of thought

342
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
No Zone of the Enders Konami

343
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Oh Bomberman the Bomberman thing on Switch

344
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
That came out not that long ago right

345
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
And they began supporting that

346
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
What have they been supporting it with

347
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Pyramid Head

348
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
And now I think they just announced

349
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
The franchise is delivered again

350
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Right but I do feel like Konami

351
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Is trying to like tap into like what do we have

352
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Left to salvage this relationship

353
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
And to be fair

354
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Their arcade division is still kind of

355
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Chugging along like you know

356
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
U-Beat is still like I see lines for that at

357
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Conventions and 2DX is trucking along

358
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Dance Dance Revolution is school

359
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I would like to see another Dance Dance Revolution come home

360
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I understand that's not a very profitable thing

361
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I would just like to see fucking Beatmania 2DX come home

362
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Like yes I know it's a special controller

363
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Come on come on

364
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Just release something that

365
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Is playable on a regular controller

366
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Yes I know it'll suck but

367
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Release like a special third party

368
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Old school controller that will work on

369
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
PlayStation 4 like

370
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Why do you keep robbing me of this because there's so

371
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Many songs from what was the last one they did

372
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I keep wanting to say Princess but I think it was

373
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Empress 2DX Empress all the way through now

374
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
That's like that's like eight or nine

375
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Versions of the game that have never

376
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Come home you know anyway

377
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
But I don't know maybe some people are like

378
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Beatmania 2DX is kind of an old

379
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
It's an old game but yet it's still going in the arcade

380
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I mean there's an audience for it somewhere

381
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Right I don't know anyway

382
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I just I mean people are if they're worried about

383
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Like the price points and you know selling that

384
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Stuff I mean a lot of times people are buying

385
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Like these collector's editions they're like $200

386
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
And what comes with a shitty statue

387
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I mean

388
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Fuck I'm sure you can manage to make a controller

389
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Cheap or just you know

390
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
What I know this may not be the popular

391
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Idea but it's better than nothing

392
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Why not just release Beatmania

393
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Online and it comes with

394
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Like three songs for free

395
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
And the whole thing is free just to make the game

396
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Free and it comes with like

397
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
The staple Konami songs like

398
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
20 November and you know like

399
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Old Konami shit for free like three

400
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Konami originals for free that you just download for free

401
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
And then just charge for song packs

402
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Like mobile phone games do

403
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I think there would be a lot of people that would play

404
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Like a 2DX Unlimited type of thing

405
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
And that might even worry I mean

406
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I would hope they would release it in the US

407
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
But I guess if it's region free I don't know

408
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I just I feel like that could happen

409
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Why not like um

410
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
DJ Max

411
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Is very very very

412
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Similar and is

413
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Out and I've played it thanks

414
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
To Shane doing the import thing on his

415
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Playstation 4 and it's

416
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
It's fun I like it and I

417
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Can't wait for some of the DLC that they're going to put out

418
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Because I really want to play like

419
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
They have like a Hatsune Miku game that's like that too

420
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I thought they had a free one

421
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
They do it's

422
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Hatsune Miku so it's not the falling notes

423
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Yeah yeah they do

424
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It's like one song that comes with that one

425
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
It's like two songs one from each pack

426
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
It's like a I don't remember the exact names

427
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
It's like Sun and Moon type of thing

428
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
You can download big I think

429
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
It's like Future Tone somebody in channel yell it out

430
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
But I think one of them

431
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Is like older songs and one of them is like newer

432
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
From the arcade songs is kind of how it

433
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Yeah Act F says

434
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Hatsune Miku Future Tone

435
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
There you go

436
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Dartetsuya in chat says

437
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
They have that the BeatMania 2DX thing I'm talking about

438
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
But it's not free that's right I forgot about this

439
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
He says it's called Infinitas

440
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
But it doesn't use the song pack model

441
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
They charge monthly for a Picelli

442
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Or whatever okay then

443
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
It ain't on console so

444
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Scrap it and start over

445
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
My controversial thought

446
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Anyway sorry we deviated a little bit

447
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
We were supposed to be talking about Tokyo Game Show and Sony's press conference

448
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
And it turned into a whole I wish Konami would do this thing

449
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
But I think the

450
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
The moral of the story is

451
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I think the Gears are

452
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Taking at Konami and they realize

453
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
They're not loved

454
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
And cherished right now

455
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
So you're probably going to see them try to do

456
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Some weird things over the next couple of years

457
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
To try to win people's favor back

458
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Like that new Metal Gear Solid game

459
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I think they will put out a new Silent Hill

460
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Even though obviously

461
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
PT and what we saw there

462
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
That should have been it I think Konami will put out a new Silent Hill

463
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I think they will

464
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Hopefully it's before this

465
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
New Kojima game comes out

466
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Because that's going to fucking

467
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Destroy whatever they want

468
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Well obviously it would be ridiculous to release them the same day

469
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
But assuming

470
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
The Hideo Kojima game is a next year

471
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Release that would seem

472
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
It would seem like 2018 is a good time for that to come out

473
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Well I'm not surprised

474
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I was kind of hoping we'd see a new trailer

475
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
For that

476
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
But I guess we'll have to wait until December

477
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
For Death Stranding

478
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
That also might be a little played out at the PlayStation events right now

479
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
We haven't had one

480
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
There wasn't a trailer at E3

481
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
So it's been a while since December

482
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Was the last time we had a trailer

483
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I guess that's true

484
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
The next thing we see ought to be gameplay

485
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
And you do mention December

486
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Obviously Sony has their big

487
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Company event

488
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
The Sony experience

489
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
And there's also the video game awards

490
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Usually Geoff Keighley is chummy

491
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
With Kojima

492
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Usually they have something there

493
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
And Nintendo yeah

494
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
So he usually gets some stuff for that

495
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Death Stranding starring Mario

496
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Mamma Mia

497
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
This is weird

498
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I don't know what's going on here

499
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Suddenly I'm shirtless and the world is adoring my titties

500
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Anyway let's talk about some other stuff

501
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
That was in Sony's press conference

502
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Now I have to see someone recreate

503
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
The Death Stranding trailer

504
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
But CG characters from Mario

505
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Replacing the characters

506
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I'm pretty sure that had to have been done

507
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
It's not done yet but that would be hilarious

508
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I would love to see that

509
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
What were some other things we got here

510
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
We got the Call of Duty World War 2 trailer

511
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Ni No Kuni 2 trailer

512
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Right up your alley

513
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Earth Defense Force

514
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I would have been more excited about Earth Defense Force 5

515
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
If they hadn't already announced that

516
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
So that was alright

517
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Pretty soon

518
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
The one I was more excited about was the other Earth Defense Force game

519
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Which was Earth Defense Force Iron Rain

520
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Which is a brand new game

521
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
That's using a different engine

522
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
By a different developer

523
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
So I'm very interested in that

524
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
How do you feel about that whole different developer thing?

525
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
It was fine

526
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
The one that they did, Insect Armageddon

527
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
It was different

528
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I liked it, it was alright

529
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
It got kind of boring after a while

530
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
The only reason that game was boring

531
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Was because it had two levels in it

532
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
And it was also kind of hard to

533
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Level up

534
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Whereas the other games you kind of get weapons

535
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
By just grinding the levels

536
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Whereas this you had to grind money to buy weapons

537
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
And that kind of sucked

538
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
But

539
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I'll play it

540
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I still haven't played much of Earth Defense

541
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I need to go back to Earth Defense Force 4

542
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Or 4.1

543
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Because I have that and I have the DLC for it

544
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I just haven't really played much into it

545
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I'll do that this week because I need to go back

546
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
You know Gabe, our buddy from

547
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I almost said Niantic

548
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Nascent Games

549
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Gave here locally, he loves that series

550
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Yeah, we'll have to seriously

551
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
That was the other thing

552
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
The co-op

553
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
In 4.1 they have 4 player co-op

554
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
But that was the first game that had

555
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
More than just

556
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
2 player co-op and same screen

557
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
So that was kind of fun

558
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I hate to backtrack a little bit

559
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
It's just the two of us tonight

560
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
And it's going to be a shorter show if I don't do some tangents

561
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
So I'm reading the comments in chat

562
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
And they're talking a little bit about Death Stranding

563
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
And now I'm stuck on this

564
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
As long as we're talking about this

565
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Art, avant-garde, fucking weird ass video game

566
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Here's the fucking dream team collaboration

567
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I want to see

568
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
The Guillermo del Toro and Hideo Kojima thing

569
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I'm here for that, that's going to be awesome

570
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I want to see a game that fucking David Lynch makes

571
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Can you fucking imagine

572
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
A David Lynch video game

573
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Would that be like a David Cage game?

574
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
You know like the

575
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Detroit, was it

576
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Oh

577
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
It's some Detroit, I can't remember

578
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Even, no I think

579
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I can't remember the name, but the androids or whatever

580
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I think it would be even weirder than that

581
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Like Heavy Rain

582
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Like press X to go to the next level

583
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
And then you press X, you press the O button

584
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
You are dead, like it's just weird shit that would happen

585
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
And then everybody would talk back

586
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Fuck you, I pushed X

587
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Tigerclaw suggests

588
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
maybe a Twin Peaks game, I don't know if I would

589
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
want it to be that direct

590
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I feel like, how about a

591
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Lost Highway game

592
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Because that movie was fucked up

593
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
So maybe something like that, I don't know

594
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
We'll see

595
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
S200mad says I don't think our minds can process

596
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
a David Lynch game, it would have to be

597
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
a point and click adventure

598
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Raginator suggests David Lynch and David Hader

599
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Yes, perfect, perfect

600
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
All the Davids in a game, anyway

601
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I apologize for my tangent

602
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
It was a thought I had to get out of my system

603
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Alright

604
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
So let's follow that up with

605
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Idolmaster, Stella Stage

606
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
is going to be out at the end of the year, December 31st in Japan

607
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
How about the big

608
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
It's out now moment

609
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Which was ruined a little bit by a

610
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
rating that was out there earlier in the day

611
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
But eh, Final Fantasy 9

612
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
was the surprise release

613
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
And here they kind of did

614
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Kinda, I was more like Final Fantasy 16

615
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
should be Final Fantasy 15's engine

616
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
but a Final Fantasy 9 type story

617
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
And here's Final Fantasy 9

618
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I liked, see that's what I kind of liked about

619
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
8 a little bit and even 7

620
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Well actually probably 6, 7 and 8

621
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
It was that whole

622
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
fantasy

623
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
It's kind of like a technology

624
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
and a fantasy setting type thing

625
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
That was one of the things that drew me into 6

626
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Oh shit, it's like fucking Final Fantasy

627
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Like it's all fantasy saying but then there's mechs

628
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
and you know, guns

629
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
and magic and that was kind of cool

630
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
that mix

631
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I'm not feeling so much of the magic and guns and shit

632
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
modern day but whatever

633
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
What was the name of that? Was that the uh

634
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Was that, that was one of that

635
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
that thing they showed right? The new Left Alive

636
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Was that it? Or is that, no

637
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
What was that? Left Alive is a, yeah

638
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
That's the new game that I know has artwork by the guy

639
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
that did Melior Solid

640
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Yoshi Shinkawa, and it's a shooter

641
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
from Square Enix. I just remember because you know

642
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
we're talking a lot about like oh it's kind of updates

643
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
and things but there was some new stuff

644
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
that they showed at this and that was one of them

645
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
And they showed a new trailer for

646
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Dissidia NT

647
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Which now of course, no big surprise

648
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
They have characters from Final Fantasy 15

649
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
in it so

650
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Noctis I think, yeah

651
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
A lot of impressive VR stuff too

652
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
They showed, the VR segment

653
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
was pretty meaty

654
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
That was kind of nice to see Sony really

655
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I think that's part of why I walked away

656
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
feeling favorable from what I saw at Tokyo Game Show

657
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
because I really feel like okay, Sony

658
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
is really investing in VR

659
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
It kind of showed in a way

660
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
It's not a Vita

661
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Yeah, yeah, well yeah

662
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
That's kind of why I'm happy

663
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Sony really is planning these other things

664
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
And I guess it felt maybe more exciting for me

665
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
than like E3 which is when we found

666
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
out the Final Fantasy game was fishing

667
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
They just really needed to bring the hardware price down

668
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
They did, in Japan

669
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I think they did recently here too

670
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
So it is coming down

671
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
They need to push it more because I think it would be

672
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
you know, get more people involved in it

673
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Let's see, Arc Park

674
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
was something that they were showing on VR

675
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Gran Turismo Sport which obviously is going to be beautiful

676
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
The Zone of the Inner's thing we talked about

677
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Niko Atsume which I joked about earlier

678
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Let's see, Niko Niko

679
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
which is, you know, it's not really big here

680
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
but it's a YouTube, Twitch-esque

681
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
type of thing that they have in Japan

682
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
A lot of events happen on there

683
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I couldn't believe that series is still around

684
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
A-Train has been around since like the...

685
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I hope they release that over here

686
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
They've done some A-Train games

687
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
have been out over here

688
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Train Sims are way

689
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Train Sims are way bigger in Japan

690
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I'm surprised Farm Sim hasn't gone

691
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
VR yet, but that might be something coming

692
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Gran Turismo Sport looks cool though

693
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Let's see, and

694
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
which I thought was something interesting

695
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
they also were pushing a Japan Studio

696
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
VR music festival and digital

697
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
theatre where you could be like in a concert

698
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
in PlayStation VR

699
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
so PlayStation VR starting

700
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
to kind of nudge itself a little bit into that

701
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
life space which

702
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
you know, not to bring up an old conversation

703
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
but I will, which is why

704
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
we speculate Facebook had bought Oculus

705
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
all that time ago is that maybe it was not just

706
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
that VR is for gaming, but VR is for life

707
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
experiences and being able to

708
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
be right in the middle of an experience

709
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
so now you see kind of Sony doing that a little bit

710
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
with PlayStation VR and this is something

711
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
you know, this is an entry

712
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
level VR thing for a lot of people

713
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
and so it's kind of neat that they're selling this

714
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
kind of different experience, this is in addition to

715
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
3-ray Blu-rays, they don't really make

716
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
movies in 360 degree just yet

717
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
but maybe Sony will have

718
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
a live show at a Sony theatre

719
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
and I'm not just talking about concerts, maybe like, I don't know

720
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
a Cirque du Soleil or a stage play

721
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
or something that maybe they'll put in VR someday

722
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
We'll see, could be interesting

723
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
could be interesting, or what about

724
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
what about y'all

725
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
if the next E3

726
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Sony does their press conference

727
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
but you can watch it in VR

728
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
and like you're there

729
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
in the actual arena

730
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
maybe, yeah

731
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I'd still rather watch it on screen because it's mostly trailers

732
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
but yeah

733
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I still think doing home on PlayStation VR

734
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
is something they should do

735
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
but what would be cool is if in those trailers

736
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
like VR trailers, it's VR

737
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
like how they have the 3D trailers at the movies

738
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
where those trailers are in 3D

739
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
where some are not in 3D

740
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Bobby Blackwolf, speaking of home, is pointing out in chat

741
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
over at live.fognetwork.com

742
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Hey Loki, did you notice that SteamVR Home

743
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
now allows you to put the

744
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
trophies you earn in games

745
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
into your home space? Valve is greater than Sony

746
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
First off, I didn't realize there was a SteamVR Home

747
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
and yes, yes

748
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
they win obviously

749
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
because they were able to fulfill a promise

750
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
the only thing I worry about

751
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
well, I guess you can put select trophies in there

752
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
because if it's all trophies, there's some of these games nowadays

753
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
that just kick out trophies like

754
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
like crazy, so

755
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
you're just like, ah shit, there's trophies all over me

756
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
but

757
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
yeah, it's cool that you can put that stuff in there

758
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
can you visit other people's homes in there?

759
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I mean, is there a point to it? Can you do a clubhouse

760
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
type of thing in SteamVR because that was

761
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
always, I felt like, a really missed opportunity

762
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
within PlayStation Home

763
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
well actually later on, I remember when we had that

764
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
listener, and I don't think he listens anymore, we had that guy

765
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
who set up a really fancy VOG clubhouse

766
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
and I was like, oh this is pretty cool, but like

767
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
it would be even cooler if I could

768
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
inject my own pictures into this

769
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
or audio, so we could play audio clips

770
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
from OLR or something in other

771
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
VOG shows when you're visiting the space

772
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
like, why

773
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
and I suppose they're probably worried

774
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
well, if we let people upload any old pictures

775
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
there'll just be titties everywhere

776
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
and if we let people upload audio, it'll be a copyright nightmare

777
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
but, you know

778
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
YouTube does it somehow

779
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
and it works, so it was somewhat

780
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
barely, anyway

781
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
yeah, and Bobby Blackwolf says

782
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
yes, you can visit others, you can start up a

783
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
SteamVR space and anybody can join it, or you can make your

784
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
friends only, you can even make a

785
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
custom SteamVR space, it uses

786
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Workshop, so there you go

787
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
anyway, it's not supposed to be all about

788
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Valve right now, it's supposed to be about Sony

789
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
but, um

790
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
well it's not my fault if Sony is not supporting

791
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
certain things that they promised several years ago

792
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
that they would support, there was an update on

793
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Detroit, which looks like an awesome game, I'm excited

794
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
about that, a Virtual On

795
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
crossover, which I thought was

796
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
yeah, that was weird, yeah

797
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
and then, let's see

798
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
a new channel called Animax

799
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
which is going to be on the Playstation 4

800
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
which is, I guess, anime, all day every day

801
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
is it anime and skinimax?

802
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
mixed together? one can hope

803
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
maybe Animax After Dark, who knows

804
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
and last but not least, the last big thing

805
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
they showed for the day was

806
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Monster Hunter World, and the big reveal

807
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
of the release date, January 26th

808
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
next year, obviously

809
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
2018, and it is going to be a

810
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
simultaneous worldwide release

811
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
so US, Europe, all the other

812
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
places, getting it the exact same

813
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
day, there will be a Monster Hunter

814
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Playstation 4 Pro released

815
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
in Japan, that I think comes out a little

816
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
sooner, I don't think it actually comes out, I think comes out

817
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
like in the next couple months, so

818
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
you know, if you're an ultimate Monster Hunter fan

819
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
you can get something a little bit sooner, so

820
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
yeah, that was some of the big stuff out of Tokyo Game

821
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Show, so that's one of those shows

822
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
I'd love to go to someday, maybe

823
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
maybe, maybe

824
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
alright, I'm fine, I'm a little worried

825
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
about the fact that, you know, I don't speak a lick of

826
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Japanese, but hopefully I'd have a friend or something

827
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
that could help me out that does speak it

828
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
and, you know, so I don't get lost

829
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
okay, so one of the other things I was gonna mention too

830
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
that they were showing off, I think was that

831
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
PlayLink stuff, so that was the

832
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
where you use your cell phones as a controller, basically

833
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
oh, yeah, yeah, they brought them, so they had

834
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
a hidden agenda, which is a new game

835
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
as it did, that was, okay, here's the thing

836
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
that was at E3, but

837
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
do you remember how they had like an hour

838
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
or a half hour, like

839
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
pre-game before the press conference?

840
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
hidden agenda was in the pre-game

841
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
remember one of our big complaints about E3 was that

842
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
like, all the rad stuff was in the pre-game

843
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
that's when they announced Undertale was coming to Playstation 4

844
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
but that was all in the pre-game, so hidden agenda was in

845
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
that pre-game, but this was

846
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
its first Japanese unveiling, I guess

847
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
or confirmation

848
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
yeah, no, I mean, the game looks really cool

849
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
and like, it was showing the whole concept where like

850
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
one person is a traitor on the team, right

851
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
trying to

852
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
skim through a lot of that

853
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
that's okay, hence the name hidden agenda

854
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
one of the players is trying to screw all the others

855
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
so it's that, it's betrayal at House on the Hill

856
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
so it's you don't know Jack!

857
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
yeah, kind of

858
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
so, yeah, anyway

859
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I enjoyed the Sony press conference and considering that

860
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
I was ready to just kind of go, oh, it's gonna be

861
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
you know, it's gonna be a lot of the Japan

862
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
games and stuff we never get to play here

863
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
considering I was kind of going into it with that mindset

864
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
that I wasn't really gonna see anything, I didn't even

865
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
think I'd end up watching the whole thing, I figured I'd turn it off

866
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
after 20 minutes, but I watched the whole thing

867
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
and I was like, oh, this is a really good show

868
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
good job, Sony

869
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
I felt better going out of that than I did at E3

870
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
so, I was happy

871
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
alright, we'll get into some

872
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
more stories in just a moment, but first

873
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I wanna talk about our gaming weeks

874
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
and the types of video games that you've been playing

875
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
this week, DarkSakura not here to share

876
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
her week with us, but I'm sure it involved

877
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
lots of Dragon Ball

878
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
what is the one she's playing

879
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
online, I can't remember

880
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Z2, oh, no, I'll tell you what

881
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
she's playing is that idle pouring game still

882
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
she got me fucking playing it too

883
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
yeah, and joining her guild, it's the

884
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Ragnarok clicker game

885
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
but you don't really click in it

886
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
but anyway, so that

887
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
yeah, that's like

888
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
mine, it's, you know what, I'll say this

889
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
for one of those clicker games, it's pretty well done

890
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
although the translation

891
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
is a little hit and miss, but you can follow it

892
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
well enough, so you like join guilds?

893
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
yeah, you can join guilds with other people

894
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
and yeah, leaderboards and stuff like that

895
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
so there's a lot of in-depth to it

896
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
but of course it's all more ways

897
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
to have more items that you need the special currency

898
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
to buy, but I haven't spent any real

899
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
money on it yet, and don't plan to, so we'll see

900
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
anyway, but that's enough about that

901
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
how about your gaming week, Logie?

902
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
so I mainly, well this is funny enough

903
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
that we talk about idle games, I mainly played

904
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
the office space idle game, and I've actually

905
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
finished it, so

906
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
basically the whole objective of the

907
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
main game is to get to level 100 where you

908
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
become the CEO of Inateck, and

909
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
I've done that, and so

910
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
now it's just

911
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
why do I need to play this game anymore?

912
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
I don't, so

913
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I've been playing, like they do these little events

914
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
and stuff, so you play like

915
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
almost like a separate game, where they kind of

916
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
change up the rules a little bit

917
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
and so I've been doing that to unlock more

918
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
cards, because you can assign

919
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
characters to each of your floors

920
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
and you get different bonuses

921
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
based on which characters are in the

922
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
floors, so

923
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
it's kind of a little bit like

924
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I don't know, there's not much clicking with

925
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
in fact, actually they've really

926
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
nerfed any of the clicking in the game

927
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
so it's, you may do that

928
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
in the beginning, or do

929
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
that for your daily, trying to get 100

930
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
critical clicks or whatever

931
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
but aside from that, you're not

932
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
really, it's more of just management

933
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
and just trying to

934
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
you know, I don't know

935
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
strategy, and there's a lot of strategy involved

936
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
with it, so I played that

937
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
I didn't play

938
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
a whole ton of console games, it's mainly just

939
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
played a little bit more of the Lego movie

940
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
game

941
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
but I'm probably gonna stop playing that

942
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
because I finished it already, and I don't really

943
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
want Grind to get all the extra characters, because I

944
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
just don't care, but

945
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Fair enough. I mean, I kind of wanted the

946
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
achievements for it, but

947
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
You don't want to platinum that bad, huh?

948
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Well, it's not even on the PlayStation

949
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
it's on Steam, so I

950
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
I don't care, it doesn't really matter

951
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
but, yeah, it was fun

952
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
I thought about getting the Ninjago game

953
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
because it came out bad, because the movie just came out

954
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
but I think I'll just wait for the Lego Marvel

955
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
2 game that's gonna be coming out in the fall

956
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
and then of course South Park's in like a couple weeks

957
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
so, yeah

958
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
I probably will end up playing that next

959
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
but yeah, like I said, I need

960
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
to go back to Earth Defense Force 4.1

961
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
so I'll probably end up doing that, because

962
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
I haven't played that in a while

963
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
I do need to play some more VR, though

964
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I need to finish, or actually play

965
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Superhot VR

966
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
because I have that now

967
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I've been meaning to try it, but every time I go

968
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
I don't really want to set it up

969
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
so, it's just laziness

970
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
that's preventing me from playing that

971
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
That's it. Alright

972
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
My gaming week, I gotta admit

973
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
not a lot of new stuff this week

974
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
I did play Super Metroid after the

975
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
show last week, and

976
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I actually did do a follow-up stream

977
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
so, not everybody probably saw it

978
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
because it was late at night on Wednesday or Thursday, but I did do a follow-up stream

979
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
and I got so lost

980
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
and I was kind of embarrassed, because I'm like

981
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
for as much as I love this game, it was like, wow

982
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I was really running around in circles

983
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
I was like, I could not fucking remember what I had to do

984
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
at one point, so

985
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
I think I need to make it a goal to

986
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
play through that game once a year

987
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
to just keep my

988
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
skills up and remember where

989
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
everything is and stuff, and not be like

990
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
is this when I get the ice beam?

991
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
So anyway, so I did have

992
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
fun with that, and I've been playing a little bit of

993
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Overwatch this week, because they had the

994
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
free weekend going on, and I just

995
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
I don't know, I was into it. I actually downloaded it on

996
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Xbox One. I've been meaning to try

997
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
because I think it went free to play

998
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
was that whole Fortnite

999
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
do they have the battle royale Fortnite that's

1000
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
out now? That's something I should

1001
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
probably check out, because that's free. Isn't that free on consoles too?

1002
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I think it does have a

1003
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
free to play version, I think the battle royale thing

1004
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
is in early access, we'll get into that in a little while

1005
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
but it's going to come up in the news later

1006
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
but anyway, yeah

1007
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
free to play is great, but Overwatch

1008
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
not free to play, but they did have a free weekend

1009
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
so I finally downloaded it to my Xbox One

1010
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
so I can say I've played it on

1011
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
every system that it's on now

1012
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
so I've played PlayStation 4, I've played PC

1013
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
I didn't buy it on Xbox One, sorry

1014
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
it's not really cheap enough for me to

1015
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
triple dip on Overwatch, but

1016
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I just thought it would be fun to download it

1017
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
and I got all my loot boxes from the Twitch Prime

1018
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
thing, they just showed up automatically

1019
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
on Xbox, so that was kind of cool

1020
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
so yeah, there was that

1021
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
that was something I played this week

1022
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
and then I played a lot of Pokemon Go today

1023
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
because of the Equinox event

1024
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
so I played

1025
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
yeah, I played a lot of that

1026
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
and got Stardust and did like

1027
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
four raids today, so

1028
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
busy with that

1029
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
yeah, that's really

1030
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
continuing to do some Heroes of the Storm

1031
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
but otherwise, that's pretty much been my game of the week

1032
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
alright

1033
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
nothing really new this week, sadly

1034
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
going to our chat over at

1035
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
live.vognetwork.com, tigercaw in chat says

1036
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
have you been playing Samus Returns?

1037
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
thank you for bringing that up

1038
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
not enough, I need to play more of it

1039
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
but I just, yeah

1040
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
when I, like the time for me to play

1041
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
DS games is when I'm like lying in bed

1042
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
about ready to go to sleep and maybe I'll play a game

1043
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
before I go to sleep, but lately

1044
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
this week it's just been, I'm gonna lie down and

1045
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
snore

1046
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
so I don't ever really get around to playing the game

1047
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I need to kind of like force myself to just sit down

1048
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
and spend more time with Samus Returns

1049
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
because I really did enjoy the part of

1050
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
what I played

1051
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Corkay is in our chat right now saying

1052
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Fortnite is not free yet

1053
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
they still want you to buy the early access stuff

1054
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
but I think that's in the

1055
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
long term plan

1056
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
I thought the Battle Royale portion was free to play

1057
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
I think it will be, I don't think it is yet

1058
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
alright, let's get into some

1059
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
housekeeping real quick and then we will do

1060
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000

I want to mention the Discord too, I think I did earlier

1066
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
in the show but I realized last week on our

1067
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000

Discord with the invite code because you don't need an invite

1073
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
it's open though, you don't need like a special

1074
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
invitation, this is your special invitation

1075
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
go to vognetwork.com slash Discord and you can join

1076
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
and you get updates on the

1077
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
shows and you can also like submit

1078
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
stories and there's just like some general

1079
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
chat and when we were doing, I was sad

1080
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
because I archived the DragonCon channel today

1081
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
but when we were at DragonCon, you know

1082
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
we were posting pictures and live updates from that

1083
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
so it's been a lot of fun, it's been a good experiment

1084
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
so yeah, check that out

1085
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
and then also some of our

1086
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
streamers are using it for their

1087
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
voice chat, like when I was doing

1088
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
I did an impromptu late night

1089
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Overwatch stream on Twitch

1090
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Friday night or Saturday night

1091
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
I don't remember

1092
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
I didn't start the stream until like midnight

1093
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
it was like an Insomniac feed

1094
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
but Flaco was up and so we started playing

1095
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
together and we were having a hilarious time because he was playing

1096
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
on PC because it's the free weekend on PC

1097
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
so he just joined the voice chat

1098
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
on the VoG Discord and we were able to both talk

1099
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
and you know, can be heard on the feed

1100
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
so it was fun!

1101
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Cool. So there's that.

1102
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Another thing I want to give a plug for

1103
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
real quick is I want to give a shout out to

1104
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
the Pokemon Go podcast

1105
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
because you know

1106
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Charles, who's one of the hosts over there

1107
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
and I know Joe too

1108
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Charles and I have been talking

1109
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
for a while about me doing some type of like

1110
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
segment thing on the show

1111
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
so I did a segment this week

1112
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
so you can check that out on their latest episode, episode 62

1113
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
so I did like a little 5 minute segment

1114
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
about, since I have played

1115
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
a lot of Ingress, I kind of

1116
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
still keep tabs on what's going on there

1117
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
and kind of talking about what happening there

1118
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
and how that might relate to Pokemon Go

1119
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
so yeah, it was fun

1120
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
and they were very nice and they played it on the show

1121
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
so check it out, so it's episode 62

1122
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
I think is where that shows up

1123
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
and I'm hoping to do that, if not every week

1124
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
if there's not enough news every week, maybe every other week

1125
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
I have a little segment there that I'll be

1126
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
sending over to those guys

1127
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
so big shout out and thank you to them!

1128
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Alright, let's move on

1129
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
for some gaming news, Loki!

1130
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
So Steam is changing up

1131
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
how they're doing

1132
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
their review scores

1133
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
basically

1134
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
what's been happening lately

1135
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
with a lot of different games is

1136
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
they've been getting review bombed

1137
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
so for example, when

1138
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
there was the announcement that

1139
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
there was going to be the in-game

1140
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
microtransactions with

1141
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
the new Shadow of War game

1142
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
when there was

1143
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
the whole backlash

1144
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
with the Firewatch devs

1145
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Campo Santo

1146
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
basically saying that we're going to flag

1147
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
PewDiePie because of his

1148
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
racist comments

1149
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
there was a backlash against that

1150
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
where fans of PewDiePie

1151
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
were going and review

1152
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
bombing Firewatch

1153
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
or

1154
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
NBA 2K 18

1155
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
because of their microtransactions

1156
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
and that kind of stuff

1157
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
basically what this is going to do

1158
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
is it's going to kind of give you a history

1159
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
so they call it a histogram

1160
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
where it kind of shows you

1161
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
where the

1162
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
reviews kind of went down

1163
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
where it's fluctuated

1164
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
so for example, you can see

1165
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
this was tied with this event

1166
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
and so on and so forth

1167
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
so it's still going to show those negative reviews

1168
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
it's just going to kind of give you a bigger picture

1169
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
to see, oh was this because

1170
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
a recent patch has always been negative

1171
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
what's

1172
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
kind of the case with this?

1173
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
do you think it's going to help

1174
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
the review bombing or whatever?

1175
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
no, I don't think it's going to do anything

1176
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
much like anything Steam does

1177
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
it doesn't really help

1178
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Steam is such a

1179
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
it's such a mess now

1180
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
I think in some ways Steam is a victim of its own success

1181
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
I don't really know how to eloquently

1182
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
more put it than that

1183
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
but I feel like Steam kind of needs to find its focus

1184
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Steam has kind of been trying to bite off

1185
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
a lot

1186
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
between the whole, they started to build streaming

1187
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
remember how Steam has streaming in it?

1188
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
and with the workshop

1189
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
and the reviews

1190
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
and the curators

1191
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
there's so many elements to Steam

1192
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
I really feel like Steam needs to have a whole

1193
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
what are we

1194
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
going to be first and foremost?

1195
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
are we a store? or are we a social network?

1196
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
I don't know

1197
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
they're working on lots of different changes

1198
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
but I don't know

1199
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
it doesn't seem like a lot of it helps

1200
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
but at the very least

1201
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
the whole Campo Santo thing

1202
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
that's kind of unfair I feel

1203
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
the backlash with that

1204
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
however the shadow of war

1205
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
and the 2K18 stuff

1206
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
sorry

1207
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
maybe if you didn't do dickish things

1208
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
people wouldn't act like dicks to you

1209
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
so I don't feel bad for them

1210
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
but it's fine

1211
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
why doesn't Steam

1212
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
and I realize Steam calls out

1213
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
this is somebody who actually bought the game

1214
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
or has a key or whatever

1215
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
the only way the people who have actually bought the game

1216
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
they really should

1217
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
well because I guess you could

1218
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
theoretically purchase it on our platform

1219
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
or like another

1220
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
non-Steam

1221
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
platform or something

1222
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
but who cares?

1223
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
I know this is going to be controversial but tough titty

1224
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
just only allow the people

1225
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
that bought it on Steam

1226
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
not even the promo keys

1227
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
only the people who bought it on Steam spent money

1228
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
get to write reviews that are weighted

1229
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
let anybody write

1230
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
a review for whatever

1231
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
but only the ones who actually bought it on Steam

1232
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
are weighted

1233
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
and you know what?

1234
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
what would be the problem with that?

1235
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
oh no

1236
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
people are going to review bomb my game

1237
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
by buying the game over and over again

1238
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
and leaving reviews

1239
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
I'm saying don't let the codes either

1240
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
and I fully realize

1241
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
that this is going to screw Kickstarter stuff

1242
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
because a lot of Kickstarter stuff

1243
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
goes through

1244
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Kickstarter campaigns

1245
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
but you know what?

1246
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
as the old saying goes

1247
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
you can't make an omelet without breaking eggs

1248
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
like the Steam store

1249
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
and the whole review system is kind of screwed up

1250
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
and so

1251
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
I think they just need to make some decisions that may not be popular

1252
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
but I think we'll clean it up

1253
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
a lot

1254
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
this kind of shit happens on iOS and Android

1255
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
and their review sites and everything

1256
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
so it's like

1257
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
grow up, you're a publisher

1258
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
publishing a game

1259
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
fucking grow up and deal with this shit

1260
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
so what?

1261
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
people don't like a decision you make

1262
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
hmm, maybe take that to the bank and figure out

1263
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
oh, maybe we shouldn't do that next time

1264
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
how about that?

1265
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
because even in the case of

1266
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
the Firewatch devs

1267
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
yeah, you know

1268
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
you are well within your right to, I guess

1269
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
copyright strike something

1270
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
however, it's kind of

1271
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
fucked up being that on your website

1272
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
you say, oh, you can go ahead and use our stuff

1273
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
and it's kind of silly to do that

1274
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
for a video that he made

1275
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
a long time ago, it wasn't like

1276
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
he was playing that game and then he dropped the

1277
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
N-bomb, it was a totally

1278
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
different, it's just, it's such a weird

1279
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
that video still generates revenue

1280
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
and so, you know

1281
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
they don't want to be associated with him, you know

1282
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
I think people forget that a lot of these

1283
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
game companies are doing a favor

1284
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
I don't think they would think that they're

1285
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
associated with him, so he played one of their games

1286
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
big deal, you could just say

1287
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
I think, you know, what he said was terrible

1288
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
leave it at that, done

1289
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
no one, you don't have to go

1290
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
any further, you were just an angry person

1291
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
using the system incorrectly

1292
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
because it's not a copyright strike

1293
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
you gave

1294
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
express copyright to these people

1295
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
so

1296
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
I'm sorry, you

1297
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
get upset, that's it

1298
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
I want to move on, but respectfully

1299
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
I disagree because, again, I think

1300
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
a lot, I think this whole

1301
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
streaming situation could be a lot worse

1302
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
when it comes to the copyrights than it is

1303
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
I think a lot, I mean, look at what Nintendo does

1304
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
I think Nintendo's an example of, you know, kind of

1305
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
doing a lot of the worst of it, and a lot

1306
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
of game companies could be doing that, but they're not

1307
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
because I think they do realize, for the most

1308
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
part, there's a lot of great publicity that comes from

1309
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
gaming, but at the same time

1310
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
we have a real fucking

1311
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
big problem in this industry

1312
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
right now with the toxic culture in gaming

1313
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
and that particular

1314
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
streamer is an excellent

1315
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
example of that problem

1316
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
and so for a game company to put their foot

1317
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
down and say, you know what, fuck this

1318
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
we're not going to be associated with this toxic shit

1319
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
no matter if it's

1320
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
you know, dated or whatever

1321
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
the semantics may be

1322
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
I'm okay with them

1323
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
having done that, because

1324
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
I stream video games

1325
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
I kind of think the game developers are

1326
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
doing us a big favor by letting us get away

1327
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
with it, and making the amount of money

1328
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
we do off games, and if someday

1329
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
they come down and say, you know what Rob, you're going to have to

1330
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
share a bigger chunk of

1331
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
your revenue with the game makers, I'll be

1332
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
fine with it, I'm not going to throw a hissy fit

1333
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
as long as it's

1334
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
as long as it is transparent

1335
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
and clear, and the rules

1336
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
are known, and you know

1337
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
if a competitor has different rules then they are

1338
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
known, as long as everything is

1339
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
you know, out there

1340
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
then I'm fine with it

1341
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
you know what though, even if they do that kind of stuff

1342
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
there's plenty of other games out there, there's so many

1343
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
indie developers that would love the exposure

1344
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
yeah, too bad

1345
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
you know, you want to be a dick about it, and you're a big publisher

1346
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
we don't need a player game

1347
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
you don't need the exposure, you've already basically stated that

1348
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
alright, anyway, I want to move on

1349
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
and try to get back to the topic

1350
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
at hand, which was the Steam reviews

1351
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
and let's see, I want to

1352
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
so, what were they saying here in chat

1353
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
over at live.vognetware.com

1354
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
SG100Matt says, can't they in theory

1355
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
buy the game, review it, and request a refund

1356
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
isn't that something that they're doing?

1357
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
well, if they refund it, pull the review

1358
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
but I think if you're going to abuse

1359
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
that, you know, if you're going to

1360
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
abuse that system, then

1361
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
they may

1362
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
revoke your privileges and do that

1363
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
sorry, MXC says, I don't

1364
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
believe you can review a game if it's not in your Steam

1365
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
library, at least I can't do it when trying to

1366
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
review a random, non-owned game

1367
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
so, but I think you can

1368
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
can't you like, add it through another process

1369
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
you can add it into your Steam library through another

1370
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
process or something like that

1371
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
yeah, I don't know if you can still leave reviews

1372
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
for that

1373
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
alright, anyhow, let's move on

1374
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
in the interest of time, let's talk a little bit about

1375
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
the drama that was going on this week between

1376
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Player Unknown Battlegrounds and

1377
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Fortnite, with the whole

1378
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
battle royale mode, and

1379
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
I'm sure a lot of you guys are reading the blogs, you've

1380
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
probably heard about this a little bit, but Fortnite

1381
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
obviously is in an early stage of release

1382
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
going to be going to early access

1383
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
and they said, you know, kind of this week

1384
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
they were talking about how they're dropping

1385
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
a battle royale mode in this

1386
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
and I've actually seen people streaming this, this is

1387
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
something you can already play basically

1388
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
well, the folks that

1389
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
were behind Player Unknown Battlegrounds

1390
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
not happy about what Epic

1391
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
did, saying quote, we've also

1392
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
noticed that Epic Games references Player Unknown

1393
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Battlegrounds in the promotion of Fortnite

1394
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
to their community and in communications with the

1395
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
press, this was never discussed with us

1396
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
and we don't feel it's right

1397
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
and so on and so on, so this

1398
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
kind of caused a conversation on Twitter

1399
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
and some places about the whole like

1400
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
what are these Fortnite, or excuse me

1401
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
what are these Player Unknown Battlegrounds guys doing?

1402
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Like, they don't necessarily

1403
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
own the entire genre

1404
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
competition is a good thing, blah blah blah

1405
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
this concept was around

1406
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
before you, blah blah blah

1407
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
It's not necessarily that they're saying that they're

1408
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
stealing the battle royale idea

1409
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
what their problem is, is that they

1410
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
licensed the Unreal Engine from

1411
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Epic Games, and

1412
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Epic is basically

1413
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
gonna be making

1414
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
their version of this and they're

1415
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
basically relying on Epic

1416
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
for hardware

1417
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
troubleshooting and that type of stuff

1418
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
troubleshooting with their engine

1419
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
and so they're, I think, worried that

1420
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
I don't know, that basically they're

1421
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
either gonna steal ideas or

1422
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
they're gonna make improvements to the engine

1423
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
and not let this company

1424
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
in on those improvements, I don't know

1425
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
it sounded like a whole bunch of worrying about nothing

1426
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
to me, I mean, it sounded like

1427
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
they're just whining because there's another company

1428
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
trying to come in, but like, exactly

1429
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
the thing, it's like, dude

1430
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Player Unknown Battlegrounds

1431
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
H1Z1, King of the Kill

1432
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
was like a thing way before that

1433
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Well, I do want to clarify, because part of what you're

1434
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
pulling from there was a clarification

1435
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
that came out, and I think it's important to say

1436
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
there was a follow-up with

1437
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
the dev team with Player Unknown Battlegrounds

1438
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
that follows up this a little bit, that came out a couple days ago

1439
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
there was an interview with PC Gamer

1440
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
where they say, quote, the first thing, and this is

1441
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
actually an interview with, what's the name

1442
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
CH Kim, who

1443
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
is

1444
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
one of the

1445
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
I think one of the developers of the game

1446
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
oh no, there it is, executive producer, thank you

1447
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
that's Blue Holes VP

1448
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
as well, so CH Kim said, quote

1449
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
the first thing I'd like to clarify is that

1450
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
this is not about the battle royale mode itself

1451
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
there were other BR game modes

1452
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
earlier this year that were released, like Last Man Standing

1453
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
or Grand Theft Auto 5's battle royale game mode

1454
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
and we never raised an issue, and I think it's great

1455
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
that there's more competition and everyone

1456
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
should be able to create their own battle royale game mode

1457
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
it's not about the idea itself, it's

1458
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
about epic games, and that

1459
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
wasn't really clear, so that was a very

1460
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
interesting clarification, which yeah, leads into

1461
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
this whole talk about the Unreal Engine

1462
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
and some of these other points that you brought up, so

1463
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
just to be clear, because I feel like social media

1464
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
didn't capture that follow-up

1465
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
as much as they did the original story

1466
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
and even one of the things that

1467
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Brendan Greene was saying is, he said

1468
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
other companies of course will come out and

1469
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
enter the marketplace, I just hope that they put

1470
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
their own spin on the game mode and not just

1471
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
make a carbon copy, and honestly

1472
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
I feel that

1473
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Fortnite has, because they have the whole

1474
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
building aspect of it, you can

1475
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
build a base, although

1476
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
I gotta be honest, with this type of

1477
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
gameplay, it's pretty fast paced

1478
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
it seems like, I don't know if I'm gonna be just

1479
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
hunkered down in a base I build and it's like

1480
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
shit, the battlefield got smaller

1481
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
I guess it's cool for like throwing up some

1482
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
cover or something like that, but

1483
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
you're not gonna get too intricate in building a base

1484
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
and stuff. I watched somebody playing a stream of it

1485
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
the Fortnite Battle Royale, and yeah, they were

1486
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
in a house and they kept taking the roof

1487
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
off the house to kind of see if they could see

1488
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
where the snipers were or what have you, and

1489
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
then they would kind of like, they'd take the roof off a different

1490
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
part of the house, they were kind of like rebuilding the house as they were

1491
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
moving, and then finally some guy came

1492
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
up the stairs in the house and killed him

1493
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
because the guy was too preoccupied with

1494
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
trying to find the other people through the roof

1495
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
so yeah, but it was kind of interesting

1496
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
and I was like, well, what I just described

1497
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
that whole taking off the roof, and again

1498
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
I don't think you could do that.

1499
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Yeah, so there you go

1500
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
that's how it's a little different. You know what's also

1501
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
interesting, Loki, is I can't help but be reminded

1502
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
of, you know, going back in time

1503
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
the old discussion we used to have on the show

1504
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
about DDR vs. In the Groove, right?

1505
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Remember that whole thing when In the Groove first

1506
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
came out, and you know, in all

1507
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
honesty, you know, when the game first came out

1508
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
I wasn't a big fan of it, because I felt it was

1509
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
very reductive with DDR.

1510
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Now, much like

1511
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
people's feelings evolve on things

1512
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
and having talked to Kyle over the years

1513
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
and so forth, my views on In the Groove

1514
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
evolved significantly, and I understand

1515
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
why it was important

1516
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
and how it filled the void that Konami was

1517
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
making, basically, by themselves.

1518
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
But anyway, I digress.

1519
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
I feel that if they didn't have the building

1520
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
stuff aspect of Fortnite

1521
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
and it was just, okay, it's in this

1522
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
art style now, but we're basically copying

1523
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
the gameplay, then yeah, I could see

1524
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
them taking issue with it more, because, okay,

1525
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
this is, you're just basically carbon copying

1526
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
this, you just changed the art style now.

1527
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
But they have more

1528
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
gameplay aspects to it, and

1529
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
you know, it kind of goes back

1530
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
to, like, even Street Fighter 2

1531
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
and, like, the old fighting games.

1532
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
People got pissed, or

1533
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
companies got pissed off because, oh, now

1534
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
there's Mortal Kombat, and now there's all these

1535
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
other fighting games that are basically kind of

1536
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
stealing, if you will,

1537
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
the style of the game, but

1538
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
they're all different, but yeah, they're all kind of

1539
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
the same in certain ways as well.

1540
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Just like this, I mean,

1541
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
there's always been last man standing

1542
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
game types and everything, from, like, Call of Duty

1543
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
to somebody brought up something on the

1544
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Intellivision, like Armor Battle,

1545
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
so this is not a new thing, and like,

1546
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
let's be honest, I mean, Battle Royale,

1547
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
that whole concept, anyways, that's from a

1548
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
fucking movie. You guys

1549
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
all fucking copied that bullshit, so

1550
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
stop fucking saying, oh, your idea is

1551
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
fucking original. This is not an original

1552
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
idea. It's a well-done implementation.

1553
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Exactly. So, you know what?

1554
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Like, Mortal Kombat, the,

1555
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
MortalKombat.X

1556
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
is a well-done fighting game. So, here's what

1557
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
you do, because this is what companies do

1558
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
when there's competition. You make the best

1559
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
fucking product you can, and stop bitching

1560
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
about it. Stop whining that

1561
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
fucking competition's coming, and step

1562
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
up your fucking game and make a better

1563
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
game. That's how you fucking win this.

1564
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Alright, I want to get to chat. Bobby Blackwolf

1565
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
in chat, trying to kind of explain this in

1566
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
his style, says, the biggest worry is that

1567
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Epic, who makes Unreal Engine, from which

1568
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
PUBG uses,

1569
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
PUBG, should I just say PUBG? PUBG, yeah.

1570
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
I do want to say PUG, like a little pug, but it's PUBG.

1571
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
PUBG. PUBG. Can't I say PUGBEE?

1572
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Can't I get it backwards?

1573
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Alright. Who makes Unreal

1574
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Engine, which PUBG uses,

1575
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
will start with holding updates they

1576
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
make to the engine from PUBG in order to make

1577
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Fortnite better. They'll make an update to the

1578
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
engine for Fortnite and not share it with PUBG.

1579
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Granted, they haven't even

1580
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
spoken to Epic about this. They went

1581
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
straight to the press. And certainly

1582
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
there's an issue with that as well, is

1583
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
taking your case to the court

1584
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
of public opinion. Well, let's be honest

1585
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
here. You're going to make updates to the

1586
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
engine anyway, because I don't believe the engine supports

1587
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
100 player multiplayer. That's probably

1588
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
something that you added in there. That's not something

1589
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
that's stock in there. So you're making

1590
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
updates to the engine too. So

1591
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
yeah, they may make updates to the engine for

1592
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
their game, much like you're

1593
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
doing the same thing, but it's not like

1594
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
they're going to be releasing it letting everybody else

1595
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
have that update and not your company.

1596
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
That's stupid.

1597
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
And so what? So what? They

1598
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
make updates to the engine for their particular

1599
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
game. Wah!

1600
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Make a better fucking game. I don't understand

1601
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
what the problem is.

1602
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
I think it's inevitable that, you know,

1603
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
a consistently top three

1604
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
games streamed on Twitch is

1605
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
going to bring challengers that won a piece

1606
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
of that pie, just like what

1607
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
League of Legends now has

1608
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Heroes of the Storm, Smite,

1609
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
you know, things that are very similar in nature, which are

1610
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
all Defense of the Ancients. Yes, I know. But

1611
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
you know, League of Legends is kind of the first one that

1612
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Twitch was really taking off there. You know, but

1613
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
here's the fascinating thing.

1614
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
All those games,

1615
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
League of Legends, Heroes of the Storm, Smite,

1616
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
they all do very well on Twitch and they all do very

1617
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
well for themselves in different ways.

1618
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Despite the fact that at its core, they're all

1619
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
lane defense games.

1620
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
It's just, you just make

1621
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
a better game. Just make the best game you

1622
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
can and let the,

1623
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
let everybody decide.

1624
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
And learn from it. Just like

1625
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
learn, don't whine about

1626
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
it, because if you whine about it, it just

1627
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
comes off as fucking weak.

1628
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
People

1629
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
are doing the same thing as we are.

1630
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Yeah, like anyone who wasn't going to copy your idea,

1631
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
that's how it fucking works. But do you think people

1632
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
like, now that you hear this clarification about

1633
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
it wasn't about the Battle Royale,

1634
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
it was about Epic.

1635
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Doesn't that make you kind of feel like, okay, maybe

1636
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
people on Twitter were going to,

1637
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
and so forth, were going too far with it?

1638
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Like with this whole thing, like, but at the

1639
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
same time, if they went to the

1640
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
press and not Epic Games

1641
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
to begin with, then they kind of only

1642
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
set themselves up for this misunderstanding.

1643
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
You know, I get it that they are worried that

1644
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
they're going to make updates to the engine, but you know what?

1645
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
If they don't release an update, you

1646
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
can speculate whatever updates

1647
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
that they're making on their side.

1648
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
You can speculate all day long,

1649
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
but I mean, eventually

1650
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
they're going to release updates to it if it's

1651
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
going to be beneficial for everybody using

1652
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
that product because they want to sell the product.

1653
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
But,

1654
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
to think that

1655
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
they're just going to purposely hold back

1656
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
updates so that your game fails

1657
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
is stupid.

1658
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
You know what? You've done well enough by

1659
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
yourself before that

1660
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
they've released all this stuff. I don't understand

1661
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
what the problem is.

1662
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Alright, going to Stoppy in our chat over at

1663
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
live.hognetwork.com says, I think Sky's on to something.

1664
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Player Unknown's ground battles

1665
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
make more sense. There's no combat

1666
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
at sea or in air. See? Pugby.

1667
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
It's not a puppy, it's a

1668
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
pugby. Anyway.

1669
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
You know what? I'll say this at the end of the day.

1670
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
I remain interested

1671
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
in both those games right now.

1672
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
You know, I've watched a little bit of both on Twitch,

1673
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
and I'm kind of interested in both of them.

1674
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
So, I mean, when?

1675
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Question mark?

1676
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Alright, anyway.

1677
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Let's move on to another story for now.

1678
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Loki. So,

1679
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
unfortunately there are some now

1680
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
apps that aren't working with iOS

1681
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
11. One of those apps

1682
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
being the very popular, time-wasting

1683
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
game Flappy Bird.

1684
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
So, if you

1685
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
update to iOS

1686
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
11, it's not going to work because it's a 32-bit

1687
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
app and not a 64-bit

1688
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
app. And no plans from the

1689
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
creator who walked away from that

1690
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
game so long ago

1691
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
to update it. That's too bad. I mean,

1692
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
if only there were some

1693
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
more Flappy Bird clones on

1694
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
the iOS storefront. I mean,

1695
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
it's too bad that no one's ever made one.

1696
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
So, jeez. You know what? You could really

1697
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
corner the market on this. It's too bad there

1698
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
wasn't one right at vognetwork.com.

1699
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
It's like the whole pub.

1700
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Which did you hear apparently no longer

1701
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
works in most browsers. Oh, darn.

1702
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Bobby got into it on his show tonight.

1703
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
I'll let you go listen to that. It's like

1704
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
the whole PUBG situation. Man,

1705
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
that sucks that they're the only game

1706
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
out there and only will be the only game

1707
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
ever. But yeah,

1708
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
that's unfortunate.

1709
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
I guess Android wins in this case. Well,

1710
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
you know, guys, I think I found the trick

1711
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
because right now,

1712
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
right now, in the studio

1713
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
on my phone,

1714
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
I'm playing Flappy Bird

1715
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
right now on my phone. That's right.

1716
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Oops, I died. On my

1717
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
iOS phone, I'm playing.

1718
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
You know how I did it? I didn't

1719
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
upgrade to iOS 11 and I can still

1720
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
play Flappy Bird. So,

1721
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
if you want to still play that stuff, nobody's really

1722
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
forcing you to upgrade. Now, look. Here's

1723
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
the other thing. It's not really

1724
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
just about Flappy Bird. Although,

1725
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
I'm a little sad he's gonna update it, but you're right.

1726
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
There's tons of clones and games out there that

1727
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
have taken this formula and improved

1728
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
on it. It was planned obsolescence. It's Apple

1729
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
conspiring against Flappy Bird

1730
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
because they're gonna release their own

1731
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Flappy Bird and it's gonna complete the

1732
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
marketplace and they're gonna

1733
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Flapple. Flapple Bird.

1734
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
It's not a

1735
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
bird anymore. It's a community.

1736
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
It's a meeting hub. A coffee

1737
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
shop, if you will. Not so much

1738
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
of a bird. It's you, actually.

1739
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
It's you. It's your soul.

1740
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Yes.

1741
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Flapple.

1742
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
It flaps the soul.

1743
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Perfect.

1744
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Anyway.

1745
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
But no, the real reason is

1746
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
the iOS updates are notorious

1747
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
for always being buggy

1748
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
when they first come out. Like, they drain your battery

1749
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
or something happens. So, I'm sorry. I've learned

1750
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
I didn't upgrade right away.

1751
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
And some people will say, you're an idiot, Rob. Well,

1752
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
okay. Cool.

1753
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
But my phone still works and I'm playing

1754
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Flappy Bird and you're not.

1755
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
But, also, just case

1756
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
and point, obviously I'm a big Pokemon Go

1757
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
player. I mentioned that earlier in the show with

1758
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
what I was playing today. There's, of course,

1759
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
a huge bug with the Plus, the Bluetooth

1760
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
thing, where there's like a three second

1761
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
delay for people that are on iOS 11 where

1762
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
it doesn't work right. So, I'm like,

1763
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
you know what? For that reason alone,

1764
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
with as much Pokemon Go as I play,

1765
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
I'm not exactly in a hurry to upgrade

1766
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
to the newest iOS on my

1767
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
three-year-old device, the iPhone 6

1768
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Plus. So, anyway.

1769
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Well, how will you swipe up

1770
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
to do shit?

1771
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
You just won't be able to.

1772
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Oh, no. It won't be as intuitive.

1773
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
I won't be able to record my screen

1774
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
because I'm sure that's fucking smooth

1775
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
on the

1776
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
6 Plus. It probably works great

1777
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
on the iPhone 8 and the iPhone 10

1778
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
and all this, but it's just not, you know,

1779
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
and as I said before, look, as much as

1780
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
I'm giving this a little crap here,

1781
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
I fully plan to buy the iPhone 10.

1782
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
I'm three years due for an upgrade

1783
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
now. I'm gonna get that iPhone 10

1784
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
and that fancy new screen, but

1785
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
I'll just wait till then

1786
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
for iOS 11. I don't need it now.

1787
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
How good Flappy Bird

1788
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
could look on that screen?

1789
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Sadly, the potential will never be realized.

1790
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Well, maybe what I'll probably do is that I'll

1791
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
upgrade, you know, I'll get the iPhone 10 and then

1792
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
what happens to my iPhone 6 Plus? It's basically

1793
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
an iPad or an iPod

1794
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Touch at that point, right? There's no cell service

1795
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
on it anymore. It's Wi-Fi. But I will forever

1796
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
have this device to play

1797
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Flappy Bird on. This phone in my hand

1798
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
will be in a fucking museum someday

1799
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
because I didn't upgrade it to iOS 11.

1800
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Marked my words.

1801
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
He stood up to Apple and said,

1802
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
fuck you, I'm not updating.

1803
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
I will not go to

1804
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
11. Come on, NoelGus

1805
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
in chat talking about my problems with

1806
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Pokemon Go and iOS

1807
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
11 says that's Niantic, though.

1808
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Well, yeah, it is, but it's also just a

1809
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
problem of what happens

1810
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
with new OSes. They kind of

1811
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
break some things that developers

1812
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
would want to do. YYR in chat

1813
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
says none of this should come as a surprise

1814
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
for months now. Opening such apps on iOS

1815
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
10 would display a warning. That is true

1816
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
and you can still go in

1817
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
and see

1818
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
you can actually go into

1819
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
I think it was, what is it? I'm looking at my phone right now.

1820
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
You go into settings and I think it's like

1821
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
what is it? General

1822
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
and

1823
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
I don't remember what it is

1824
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
from here. Somebody in chat will probably yell it out.

1825
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Is it software update? No, because I don't

1826
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
want to update. Oh shit, I don't want to update.

1827
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Accessibility, maybe?

1828
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
I don't remember what it is, but there's something you go into

1829
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
and it actually shows you what

1830
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
apps on your phone are not

1831
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
going to upgrade. And what's interesting is that

1832
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
ReRave, another music

1833
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
game, is one of them that will not

1834
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
upgrade, but

1835
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
they put out ReRave Plus some time ago

1836
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
so the old ReRave is kind of

1837
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
done anyway. It's all about ReRave Plus at this

1838
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
point, but I remember that was like the other big one

1839
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
that showed up on the list.

1840
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Alright.

1841
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
ActDeftInChat speculates

1842
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
that phones without iOS 11 will be

1843
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
valuable like PlayStation 4 with

1844
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
PT. Ooh.

1845
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Good point, good point. Alright.

1846
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Didn't they try that though?

1847
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Like people were selling their phones with

1848
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Flappy Bird when it got removed. I think

1849
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
it was working for some people too.

1850
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
It's kind of crazy what people will buy.

1851
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Anyway, speaking of

1852
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
things that only crazy people will buy,

1853
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
the original Xbox

1854
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
controller is coming back. The X-Brick

1855
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
controller, that gigantic

1856
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
did you ever have the original Xbox

1857
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
with that gigantic freaking

1858
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
controller? Check

1859
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
it out. Look at a YouTube or something if you've never seen

1860
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
it, but there was a gigantic controller for this

1861
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
and it seems like it might be coming

1862
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
back, sort of. The nickname for this

1863
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
controller, the Duke, apparently

1864
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
one of the original designers has actually

1865
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
been trying to put the Duke back on

1866
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Xbox One and Windows 10.

1867
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Microsoft just gave it

1868
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
the green light from Xbox designer

1869
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Sheamus Blackley.

1870
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
They had the Duke on the 360.

1871
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Well now it's coming back for the Xbox One.

1872
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
And an appropriate time too because

1873
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
we know that original original Xbox

1874
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
games are going to be playable on Xbox One

1875
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
like Crimson Skies, right? So what

1876
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
better time for this controller to come back. However

1877
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
I do want to state out this will not be a Microsoft

1878
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
product. This will be a peripheral

1879
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
from Hyperkin who puts out

1880
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
a lot of that stuff. Apparently they're now doing

1881
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
that center thing that was like a jewel

1882
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
thing with the Xbox logo. It's not going to be an

1883
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
OLED screen. So that might be kind of neat.

1884
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Maybe they'll do some different stuff with that.

1885
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
I mean not that there's any like really

1886
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
official second screen support within the

1887
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Xbox because

1888
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
what the hell? I don't even remember

1889
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
the name of it. That app that

1890
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
they had? Is that dead? It's clearly dead.

1891
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
I don't even remember the fucking name of it.

1892
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Screenplay? Screen?

1893
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Oh my god.

1894
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
I can't even remember. That's how dead that thing is.

1895
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
But obviously it won't be supported

1896
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
within the controller. But smart glass.

1897
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Thank you ActDeft. Winner winner

1898
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Smart glass dinner.

1899
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
There it is.

1900
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Speaking of dead things.

1901
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Microsoft wants to

1902
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
sell you a camera.

1903
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
They're testing USB

1904
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
camera support for

1905
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
streaming use on the Xbox One.

1906
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Because after all there's been

1907
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
no cameras released for the Xbox

1908
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
One. Ever. Ever.

1909
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
I mean Kinect but will

1910
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
not. But Kinect got shoved in a

1911
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
closet and locked. Let's forget

1912
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
that even happened. We'll never be heard from again.

1913
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
But yes they're gonna support that so you can

1914
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
do like facecam and stuff like that on

1915
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
you know your game

1916
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
stream. Oh so that thing that we hoped

1917
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
the Xbox One would do when they first

1918
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
removed Kinect a couple years ago.

1919
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Right? They're finally gonna

1920
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
maybe do. I saw Kinect for the Xbox 360

1921
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
for 8 bucks at Goodwill the other day.

1922
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Wow really? I almost bought it.

1923
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Oh wait for the 360 not for the one.

1924
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Oh ok I was like if that was for Xbox One

1925
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
I might have actually went and bought it for Xbox One.

1926
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
8 bucks?

1927
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
I could do without pumpkin spice

1928
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
fraps for a couple days to do that.

1929
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Yeah I don't think it was the Xbox One. Oh bummer.

1930
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Bummer bummer. Not bad though.

1931
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
YYR in chat says

1932
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Kinect may never be heard from again

1933
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
but it will keep listening.

1934
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
I think that was some people's concerns

1935
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
with that device actually.

1936
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Alright. And

1937
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
come on Noel Gus pointing out that Apple bought

1938
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
the sensor company that made Kinect.

1939
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Hmm. Maybe

1940
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
Apple Kinect.

1941
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Anyway moving on

1942
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
to another story. This makes me

1943
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
like really sad actually and that is

1944
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
news that the Chinese

1945
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Room which is a studio

1946
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
in Britain that makes video

1947
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
games such as probably their most

1948
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
well known games are Everybody's Gone to the

1949
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Rapture and Dear Esther

1950
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
have laid off their staff

1951
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
and they are going dark for a few months.

1952
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
The co-founder of the Chinese

1953
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Room Dan Pinchbeck made

1954
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
a big blog post that talks about what's going on

1955
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
saying that this is a temporary closure

1956
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
it is something that's been in the works since earlier

1957
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
in the year. The decision has to do with

1958
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
financial pressures following a

1959
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
health scare. Yikes.

1960
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
And so they're pausing things to recharge.

1961
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
He put quote to cut a long

1962
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
story short the situation between

1963
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
financial pressures trying to keep the lights

1964
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
on for the employed team the stress

1965
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
of end of development health issues

1966
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
just wasn't a tenable thing anymore.

1967
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
It was time to take a break recharge recover

1968
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
and have a good think about the

1969
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
future. Chinese Room still

1970
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
has two games in the works The 13th

1971
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Interior and Little Orpheus

1972
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
it was assured in

1973
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
the blog post that these titles are still going to

1974
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
release as planned. He will interact

1975
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
with the community through social media but the studio

1976
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
is no longer in full active

1977
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
development. The studio did assist

1978
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
employees in trying to secure positions

1979
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
elsewhere since I guess they'd known

1980
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
for some time.

1981
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Trying to end on a happy note

1982
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
Is it the end of the Chinese room? No

1983
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
I don't think so but it's the end of a chapter

1984
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
and we hope you all can be patient with us whilst

1985
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
we figure out what happens next. And that makes

1986
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
me sad because I thought everybody's gone

1987
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
to the rapture was a brilliant game

1988
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
and I understand not everybody's into the

1989
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
walking simulators which you know

1990
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
but I also think the internet has

1991
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
kind of like a lot of mob

1992
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
mentality online has really

1993
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
given the walking simulator type

1994
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
stuff like like it's just it's a well

1995
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
done story at the end of the day

1996
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
everybody's gone to the rapture is a really good story at the end

1997
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
of the day and it's you know you can draw your own

1998
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
conclusions from it you can either get

1999
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
a lot of exposition or very little depending

2000
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
on how you know thorough you are with the exploring

2001
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
and so forth I think the soundtrack

2002
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
is one of the most gorgeous soundtracks in a

2003
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
video game so

2004
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
there's an awful lot I really like about the game

2005
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
so I think it sucks that you know the internet kind of

2006
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
shits on this genre sometimes

2007
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
when there's you know brilliant art

2008
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
that comes out of it like this game and

2009
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
you know I really hope that

2010
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
backlash or whatever you want to call it I really hope

2011
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
that didn't play into

2012
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
what's happening to the studio now

2013
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
it sounds like there may be some other issues

2014
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
such as the health issues and so forth that are a lot more

2015
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
scarier you know that are that are much bigger

2016
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
than a video game and so forth so I get it from that

2017
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
standpoint but hopefully

2018
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
the upcoming releases the 13th

2019
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
interior a little Orpheus

2020
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
hopefully they're good you know

2021
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
you know I'm not gonna be so

2022
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
nice if the games aren't good but I if

2023
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
the games are good which you know I enjoyed their other

2024
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
games so I would hope I'd like these games to if

2025
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
the games are good I hope it brings them the success

2026
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
that they deserve to be able to do more

2027
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
games in the future although it's gonna be weird if

2028
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
they can't really have the same development team you know

2029
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
so or maybe they'll be able to come back I don't know

2030
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
so anyhow

2031
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
little sad about that and the fact that

2032
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
that developer is

2033
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
kind of going through a big change right

2034
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
now all right before we get to the classic

2035
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
game of the week which I will be doing tonight in

2036
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Dark Sakura's Absence we have one more story from

2037
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
Loki yes and this is kind of hopefully

2038
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
the end of a

2039
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
long stretch of stories we've been talking about

2040
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
so going back to last

2041
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
week we were mentioning that you know

2042
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
first there was an NES emulator

2043
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
that was found randomly within

2044
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
the firmware of the

2045
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
or yeah the

2046
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
firmware of the NES

2047
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Switch or the Switch and

2048
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
they also had the NES game Golf

2049
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
in there as well that was part of the Switch

2050
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
and everyone's just wondering what the hell is this

2051
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
why why is this in here

2052
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
is this like something that's going to be coming out

2053
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
you know are they going to have this

2054
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
release or something well apparently

2055
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
there is a little bit more to the

2056
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
story so they figured it out

2057
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
they figured it out yeah so

2058
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
and almost by accident

2059
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
someone had somehow launched

2060
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Golf actually without any sort

2061
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
of hacks and launched the game and they're

2062
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
like wait how did you do that

2063
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
you know no one believed them at first

2064
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
and then they found all this stuff

2065
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
so what happened was apparently

2066
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
on July 11th

2067
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
which is the

2068
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
anniversary of

2069
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
Awana's death

2070
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
if on July 11th

2071
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
if you make the

2072
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
the little motion

2073
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
the direct to you motion

2074
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
the open hands

2075
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
kind of going forward yeah if you

2076
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
make that motion with the

2077
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Switch controllers

2078
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
it'll launch the game

2079
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
and it's only on July 11th

2080
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
and it actually has to be on July 11th

2081
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
if it's connected to the internet because it does check

2082
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
you know the time against the internet

2083
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
someone has managed to capture

2084
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
this on video because he had a

2085
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Switch that wasn't connected to the internet

2086
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
yet and so he set the date to

2087
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
July 11th did the gesture

2088
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
and sure enough it booted up

2089
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Golf that's awesome that's a really

2090
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
neat truth you know some people were kind of weirded

2091
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
out though by the fact that they did his date of death

2092
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
as a tribute and not

2093
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
like his birthday or you know

2094
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
celebrating a type of other notable release

2095
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
or just any time but

2096
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
you know I think that's also maybe like a culture

2097
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
thing as well like you know maybe it's a little

2098
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
weird in our culture but in other

2099
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
cultures sometimes

2100
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
that's how you celebrate or

2101
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
I think it was I was reading something about it like

2102
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
it's almost like a good luck thing like

2103
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
if you have that inspiration that's in your

2104
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
console that it's actually or you know whatever it is

2105
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
you develop that's actually like a good luck thing

2106
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
but like you know in some cultures what we have like

2107
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
we have holidays to celebrate dead people

2108
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
like that's you know that's what happens so it's

2109
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
it's interesting I wonder

2110
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
if this would have ever been found

2111
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
well I get I mean I get

2112
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
this was the way it was supposed to happen I suppose

2113
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
some guy randomly accidentally

2114
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
gets it on July 11th and posts to a

2115
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
message board nobody believes him

2116
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
but then finally somebody digs in the OS and

2117
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
finds no this guy there's something to it right

2118
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
so I guess next

2119
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
year on July 11th a lot of people are going to be

2120
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
playing golf yeah

2121
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
Dartetsuya in chat says I learned in Japan they

2122
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
called it a Oma Mori a good luck

2123
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
charm yeah Dartetsuya

2124
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
says that's the term they were throwing around over on

2125
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Japanese Twitter so there it is and of course

2126
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
golf Iwata had made

2127
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
golf just like he made yeah

2128
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
I guess no there's a lot of people

2129
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
that refuse to work on that game because they couldn't

2130
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
fit it within the cartridge size but

2131
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
somehow he managed to get the code to fit

2132
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
alright well that's that is

2133
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
that is awesome so I don't have a

2134
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
clever follow up for that leading into our

2135
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
classic game of the week so let's just get to our

2136
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
classic game of the week

2137
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
now every week

2138
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Dark Soccer dives into the video game vault and finds

2139
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
a game that she thinks hey you little brats

2140
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
you should be playing this game this week

2141
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
but she's not here

2142
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
so I'm taking over tonight because I thought

2143
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
it would be good tonight to do a timely

2144
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
submission perhaps a little bit for the classic

2145
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
game of the week and I don't even know if Loki's

2146
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
ever played this but we'll find out so the classic

2147
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
game of the week nope sorry guys not Halo

2148
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
classic game of the week is something a little timely

2149
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
this week there's a very specific reason

2150
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
why I picked this today

2151
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
so the classic game of the week let's see if we can get

2152
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
some of the voice synthesizer

2153
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
in here to play

2154
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
that's right

2155
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
it is Star Trek

2156
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
the 1982

2157
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
release from Sega in

2158
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
the arcades this is the Star Trek

2159
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
strategic operations

2160
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
simulator and it was

2161
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
an arcade release in 1982 from

2162
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Sega but it was ported to a variety

2163
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
of systems I know I had played

2164
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
it on the Commodore 64 when I was

2165
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
younger and it was also

2166
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
on I think it was on the

2167
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Apple as well

2168
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
it was on the Vectrex

2169
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
I think it was on Atari 2600 as well

2170
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
no I don't think it was on the Vectrex it was on the ColecoVision I know

2171
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
that what's interesting about this game

2172
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
it looks like

2173
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Star Wars which was around

2174
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
the same time but Star Wars was

2175
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
Atari if I remember right

2176
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
these just both happen to be vector based games

2177
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
but the interesting thing that made

2178
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Star Trek a little bit different is that in

2179
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
the Star Trek arcade game you actually

2180
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
had like a split screen thing

2181
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
going on you had a map in the upper right

2182
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
you had in the upper left like a

2183
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
bar that showed how many photon torpedoes

2184
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
you had and how many like laser beams and all that stuff

2185
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
you had and then you had your actual

2186
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
like view play was on the bottom

2187
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
and so remember this was 1982

2188
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
in the arcades this is a little bit unheard

2189
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
of at the time to basically have like

2190
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
second screen type of stuff that was built

2191
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
into the game or actually tertiary screens

2192
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
in this case

2193
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
so that's kind of what made this game unique

2194
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
I don't think that this game was ever as popular

2195
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
as Star Wars was

2196
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
which was around

2197
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
the same year or the year later but

2198
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
I think it was pretty cool just how like involved

2199
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
this game was so

2200
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
what you did in this game you got multiple views

2201
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
of the play field and of course

2202
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
you have to use and manage your shield energy

2203
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
and photon torpedoes and warp energy

2204
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
you can replenish these by docking with

2205
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
star bases but the Klingons

2206
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
aren't only attacking you

2207
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
they're actually attacking the

2208
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
star base as well so you have to be careful

2209
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
and you can actually kill your star base by friendly

2210
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
fire so you have to be careful

2211
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
this game was actually controlled with a weighted

2212
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
spinner so it wasn't really like a joystick

2213
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
you actually had a little spinner and that's how you use the ship

2214
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
heading control and then you have buttons

2215
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
to do the impulse engines, warp engines

2216
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
phasers and photon

2217
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
torpedoes the warp button

2218
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
was set a little bit away from the other

2219
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
buttons that way you had

2220
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
to actually like you intentionally

2221
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
go and hit it and you wouldn't be hitting it on accident

2222
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
especially if you're in the moment

2223
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
you want to make sure you don't accidentally hit that

2224
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
so there you go and then

2225
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
this was translated on a variety of

2226
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
different systems an early

2227
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
review in the magazine Electronic Games

2228
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
said that this is sure to be a top

2229
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
grocer in the arcades this year if you can

2230
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
squeeze through the crowd around the machine you may

2231
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
never want to leave I

2232
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
don't I mean again I can

2233
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
only go back by my old memory

2234
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
but I don't think this game

2235
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
ended up being as popular in

2236
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
the arcades at the time but I remember

2237
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
it was a game it seemed like a lot of people did have

2238
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
on like home consoles and stuff like

2239
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
obviously we added on Commodore 64

2240
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
it was on Atari 2600, Apple II

2241
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
you know kind of those early

2242
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
YYR

2243
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
and Chad is like freaking out going

2244
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
holy shit I played a Commodore 64 version of this

2245
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
and didn't remember it at all until

2246
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
just now see there you go classic

2247
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
game of the week awakening memories

2248
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
deep inside you even some you may not

2249
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
want since 2002

2250
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
the

2251
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
designer of this game Sam

2252
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
Palihannuk I hope I said that

2253
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
right who did this for Sega

2254
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
which ended up developing and publishing the game

2255
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
and

2256
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
there you go I don't know what else to say about it

2257
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
but obviously I have picked this game

2258
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
tonight because of the fact that

2259
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
I know many people are probably not

2260
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
listening to OLR tonight because they're watching

2261
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
the Star Trek Discovery which is the new

2262
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
TV series is airing tonight

2263
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
which is a little bit controversial

2264
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
because I know it's going on the CBS all

2265
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
access thing and people are like I don't

2266
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
really want to pay for another

2267
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
$10 a month thing

2268
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
but you know despite that controversy

2269
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
I do think it's great that Star Trek

2270
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
you'll just have to do what Game of Thrones fans do

2271
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
and pirate it probably pirate the shit out of it

2272
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
but anyway I just think it's great that Star Trek

2273
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
is coming back to television and of course

2274
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
I'm going to leave the rest of that discussion to our

2275
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
friends at the Starboard Power Coupling

2276
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
podcast we played their commercial last week

2277
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
and they are very excited to be back this week

2278
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
with their discussion on the first

2279
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
maybe first two episodes actually because I believe

2280
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
not you get the first episode on TV

2281
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
but then on CBS all access the first two episodes

2282
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
are going to be there so I think they may discuss both

2283
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
this week on Starboard Power Coupling

2284
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
so look forward to

2285
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
that. Anyway there it is

2286
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
your classic game of the week Star Trek the arcade game

2287
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
from 1982 a strategical

2288
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
operations simulator and I'm being very specific

2289
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
because there's been like 50 Star Trek games

2290
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
so that's the one specifically I'm

2291
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
calling out.

2292
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
To register participation for

2293
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
this week's episode of Orange Island Radio at

2294
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
vognetwork.com use the pass phrase

2295
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
Sprout.

2296
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat saying the Orville

2297
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
greater than Discovery

2298
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
you know what I haven't seen either one

2299
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
and I don't think you've seen Discovery

2300
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
yet so I think it's a little early to say that

2301
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
but I do think it's

2302
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
interesting that the Orville

2303
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
the reason why people seem to

2304
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
like it is that it has a lot

2305
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
of the essence of what people really like about

2306
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Star Trek I mean granted it's in a separate universe

2307
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
or what have you but it's interesting

2308
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
because it is on Fox which is over the

2309
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
air and it's kind of doing something that Star Trek

2310
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Discovery isn't and I just I really

2311
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
hope that decision by CBS doesn't

2312
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
like fuck Star Trek

2313
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
forever because of this decision

2314
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
so I'm kind

2315
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
of hoping because I don't know if you know this

2316
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
but in every other country but the

2317
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
US maybe Canada as well

2318
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
I can't remember what the deal is in Canada but

2319
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
I think every other country besides those two

2320
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
Netflix is going to have the Star Trek show

2321
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
so in every other country you'll be able to watch it

2322
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
on Netflix and

2323
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
so yeah you don't have to worry about getting a separate

2324
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
service because it'll be on the one that most people have

2325
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
so I wonder if this show isn't going to do

2326
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
very very very well in other countries

2327
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
but I guess CBS

2328
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
already made a good like they spent like eight

2329
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
million dollars on this show well six

2330
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
million of it came from the Netflix deal so

2331
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
yeah right anyway

2332
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
alright

2333
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
oh yeah that's right and somebody did explain this

2334
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
to me Bob Blackwell says it airs on cable

2335
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
TV in Canada so they have like

2336
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
a cable TV channel up there I think

2337
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
one of my buddies up there I think was even telling me about this

2338
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
and I just forgot because I don't have a good memory

2339
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
alright

2340
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
and Kaijuto in chat points out I use

2341
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
CBS access for Big Brother it's cool

2342
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
you can watch a lot of crap on it and admittedly

2343
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
yeah I got CBS all

2344
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
access for Big Brother as well and

2345
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
do you know how lit that celebrity version

2346
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
of Big Brother is going to be I mean it's

2347
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
it's Olympics counter programming so it's going to be on

2348
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
the same time when a lot of people are distracted

2349
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
by the Olympics but instead of

2350
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
just trying to air these shows that nobody's going to

2351
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
watch because the Olympics are on CBS is going to try to

2352
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
do you know celebrity Big Brother which stands

2353
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
but that's going to be on it'll

2354
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
be on TV but the live feeds will be on

2355
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
CBS all access and that's going to be nuts

2356
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
because that's celebrities

2357
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
you know in the big well I say

2358
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
celebrities but it's going to be celebrities

2359
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
if rumors are to be believed

2360
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
Tiffany Pollard

2361
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
or New York who's one of my faves

2362
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
I think she'll do fantastic

2363
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
Lance Bass

2364
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Dog the Bounty Hunter

2365
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
some gal from Mob Wives but again

2366
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
these are rumors and who knows what's

2367
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
going to change before this is really on TV

2368
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
so it'll be interesting but

2369
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
I mean maybe if celebrity Big Brother

2370
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
brings people to CBS all access then

2371
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
people will be like oh shit this is the Star Trek thing too

2372
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
I guess I should watch this but I feel like

2373
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
most of the Star Trek fans will have just pirated

2374
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
it before that that's just the reality

2375
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
I don't know we'll see

2376
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000

myself and Loki with you here tonight

2392
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Dark Soccer is out sick

2393
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
but I hope she feels better a lot soon

2394
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
although I notice over

2395
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
where Dark Soccer usually sits

2396
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
during the show I notice my husband Alan

2397
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
has his ASMR

2398
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
stuff all set up do you know what this is

2399
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
Loki the ASMR have you heard of this?

2400
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
this is something I've just been learning more about

2401
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
recently is it's this whole okay so I guess

2402
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
like there's this um you can find these YouTube

2403
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
videos out there and it's um you know

2404
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
it's people that are talking they're talking

2405
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
very softly into a

2406
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
microphone and uh

2407
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
what the way they talk the way they talk

2408
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
it's supposed to like make chills go

2409
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
down your spine and like

2410
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
but they'll do things like it's not just the talking but then it's like

2411
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
they'll like rub things they'll

2412
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
rub the microphone it's like this I guess

2413
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
supposed to be like and people say it's like a massage

2414
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
for the brain I know I understand I know the

2415
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
feeling but like I don't know

2416
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
well the first video I ever saw was this lady who

2417
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
eats a pickle really slowly and

2418
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
like you know she's

2419
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
and this is like the noise of the pickle

2420
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
is like but like see some people that would

2421
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
drive them nuts that noise

2422
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
because like you know some people don't like to hear other

2423
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
people eat like I have a friend who really hates that

2424
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
but um you know I just I can't help

2425
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
but you know think of that but anyway so

2426
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
so Alan has likes to

2427
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
watch these videos and I guess I guess

2428
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
some people feel it and some people don't so

2429
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Alan's kind of one of the people that feels it and

2430
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
but now he makes he likes to

2431
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
make the uh slime stuff he sees

2432
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
in some of the videos cause that's

2433
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
I guess gives him that texture type feedback

2434
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
so if you ever wondered what

2435
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
happens to Jamie's spot during the week when

2436
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
she's not here it turns into

2437
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
I keep calling it ass master

2438
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
cause ASMR turns into

2439
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
it's ass mister it's ass mister

2440
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
I like that better it's cause cause people

2441
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
are gonna get a different impression if I say Jamie's

2442
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
share turns into ass master when she's not here

2443
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
but no it's it's ASMR headquarters

2444
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
uh ass mister so there it is

2445
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
so uh going to our chat over

2446
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
at live dot vog network

2447
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
dot com uh active to chat says

2448
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000

2449
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
money those YouTubes make

2450
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
like if you do like that

2451
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
that lady who makes the pickles that

2452
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
that video probably has millions of hits

2453
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
like she could probably fucking retire

2454
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
off eating pickles on YouTube like it's crazy

2455
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
it's people that play toys yeah

2456
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
play with toys and film it

2457
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
and my son watches the shit out of that crap

2458
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
it's so like oh my gosh it's so

2459
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
and it's a never ending cycle

2460
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
too cause you get your kid to play

2461
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
with toys and then the companies pay

2462
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
you know that

2463
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
or pay you for that and then they also send you free

2464
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
toys to promote it never ends

2465
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
I need to do that Legos

2466
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
I need to do it seriously Legos

2467
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
have been like crack I am a fucking crack

2468
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
addict when it comes to that shit

2469
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
that might be a fun thing to stream is Lego

2470
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
building like stream it on Twitch and then archive

2471
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
it on YouTube they do that

2472
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
sometimes they'll do speed builds and stuff

2473
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
but like yeah but it's not me I'm funny

2474
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
I mean it

2475
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
takes a long time though like the last I put together

2476
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
took 12 hours wow

2477
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
cause it was a big set uh let's see

2478
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
Bobby Blackwolf points out there was a guys on

2479
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
a show episode about people chewing one

2480
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
now you know which one of my friends I was referring to a moment ago

2481
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
alright anyhow people

2482
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
chewing I don't remember guys on a show episode

2483
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
about chewing I don't remember I don't remember

2484
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
I think it was I think it was like the discussion

2485
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
at the top of the show I don't think that was the main topic

2486
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
of the show but I think it came up at some point

2487
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
during the show anyway I missed that show

2488
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
I do really want to bring it back you guys but you know

2489
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
Xverse has just been really busy as have I

2490
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
so I don't want to go

2491
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
too far down this road but I did mention

2492
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
at Dragon Con I was you know finding a lot of inspiration

2493
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
and it's part of the reason why I

2494
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
want to get more motivated to do this segment

2495
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
for you know Pogo Podcast I'm doing

2496
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
but I am

2497
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
considering adding another podcast to the

2498
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
platter I'm in that mode now

2499
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
where I think I have an idea in my

2500
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
head and the little hamster

2501
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
gears are turning so we'll see

2502
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
anyway alright

2503
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
let's move on

2504
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
we're going to get into

2505
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
some more news rapid fire news

2506
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
in fact starting with Loki

2507
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
so here's a mobile game we haven't heard of in a while

2508
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
but Super Mario Run

2509
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
is getting an update that's right

2510
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
they're adding a whole new world

2511
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
don't you dare close

2512
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
your eyes a whole new world

2513
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
I see no right as I said that I was like oh my god

2514
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
he's going to do that and sure

2515
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
enough not disappointed whatsoever

2516
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
have I

2517
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
become predictable after 700 episodes

2518
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
of this show?

2519
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
no I'm just using my

2520
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
wife doing that kind of crap

2521
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
so the new one is going to be

2522
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
they said it's going to

2523
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
have like a remix 10

2524
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
is what it's called so

2525
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
it's

2526
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
basically bite sized sections

2527
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
of the game's current levels with new bonus

2528
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
medals so they have repeatable

2529
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
challenges and they're also adding a new playable

2530
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
character Princess Daisy will become

2531
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
a playable character as well

2532
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
and so also with that you're going to be able to

2533
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
play your own music in the background

2534
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
instead of the game music

2535
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
and when you do

2536
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
that your characters will

2537
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
they'll wear headphones so they have a picture

2538
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
of Mario with headphones on

2539
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
headphone Mario

2540
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
beats by Bowser

2541
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
I like that beats by Bowser

2542
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
and then of course if you haven't jumped into the game yet

2543
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
they're going to be marking it on sale

2544
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
September 29th it's going to be half price

2545
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
so $5 instead of $10

2546
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
so check it out

2547
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
alright and then

2548
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
with the prevalence

2549
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
of Wii U emulators

2550
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
there is

2551
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
a whole ton of shit

2552
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
that they've been doing with the whole

2553
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
Wii emulation or Wii U emulation scene

2554
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
and of course one of the games that's

2555
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
gotten a lot of focus is

2556
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
the whole Breath

2557
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
of the Wild so

2558
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
Breath of the Wild runs fantastic in emulators

2559
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
in fact they've gotten it to run 4K and all sorts

2560
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
of things and now modding has

2561
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
become a part of that so

2562
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
all sorts of mods in there there's a few new character

2563
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
mods including putting

2564
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
CJ or Carl Johnson from

2565
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
Grand Theft Auto San Andreas

2566
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
in the game or Steve from Minecraft

2567
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
and they have

2568
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
a picture with Link wearing Cappy

2569
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
and a mustache

2570
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
as well do they have the mod like

2571
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
they have in Skyrim for like maybe

2572
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
when the red moon happens it's Macho Man

2573
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
starts playing no

2574
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
they don't have that yet but I mean it's

2575
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
it's interesting and then the moon turns into

2576
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Randy Macho Man Savage oh yeah

2577
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
see all these different mods for the game

2578
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
I want to see some for Mario Kart

2579
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
I wonder if they've got some for that but

2580
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
yeah I haven't played

2581
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
on my emulator in a while

2582
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
but it runs really well in my system

2583
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
so I need to maybe go back

2584
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
and check that out again

2585
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
I'm having a laugh at this conversation in chat

2586
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
YYR in chat says is Headphone Mario wearing

2587
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
anything besides the headphones

2588
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
and Corky follows that up with yes

2589
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
his mustache

2590
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
alright moving on to some other rapid fire

2591
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
stories for the week you know I

2592
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
didn't miss this one you guys from Tokyo Game

2593
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
Show it's not specifically about

2594
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
Sony but I'm very excited to

2595
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
hear about Kunio-kun the world

2596
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
classics collection it's going to come out on

2597
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch

2598
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
and PC it's 11

2599
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
Kunio-kun classics

2600
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
and if you don't know what Kunio-kun is

2601
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
well then let me tell you about the four

2602
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
western games also

2603
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
included as bonus titles that weren't released

2604
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
in Japan that are part of this collection

2605
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
and you'll know real quick what Kunio-kun

2606
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
is Renegade

2607
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
Super Dodgeball

2608
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
River City Ransom and Crash and the

2609
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
Boy Street Challenge that's right it's the

2610
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
little characters from River City Ransom and Super Dodgeball

2611
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
so of course they've had some more games

2612
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
that have been released over in Japan there's

2613
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
like several dodgeball games there's a hockey

2614
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
game a soccer game so anyhow all

2615
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
the games in the Kunio-kun collection will have support

2616
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
for online play as you clear

2617
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
missions in the title you can customize your avatar

2618
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
and your game screen and

2619
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
additional replayability elements as well so

2620
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
that's really exciting especially I'm very excited to hear it's

2621
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
coming out on Switch because

2622
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
then that's something that you can take with you on the go

2623
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
as well and you know these are

2624
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
older games anyway so it's not like you're gonna

2625
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
need the biggest technology to play them

2626
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
so that's very very cool

2627
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
what else could be cool

2628
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
speaking of the Nintendo Switch

2629
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
apparently a Netflix customer

2630
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
service rep so take it

2631
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
with a grain of salt cause it's not like it's you know

2632
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
a director of you know

2633
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
publicity or something a Netflix

2634
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
customer service rep told Go Nintendo

2635
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
or a user at that site anyway

2636
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
that Netflix is locked

2637
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
and loaded for the Nintendo Switch

2638
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
Netflix been trying to get permission

2639
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
from Nintendo to launch the app on the

2640
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
console but no results yet

2641
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
once Nintendo approves it

2642
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
the Netflix Nintendo Switch app will launch

2643
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
and be added to the eShop I honestly

2644
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
but no surprise here I think the only

2645
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
surprise out of this is that somebody

2646
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
at Netflix is saying something about it

2647
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
but you guys customer

2648
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
service sometimes is outsourced

2649
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
to other companies so

2650
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
with all due respect this

2651
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
person may have no

2652
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
additional information that you or I have

2653
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
usually the customer service

2654
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
reps the thing is that those positions you know

2655
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
phones they tend to be very high attrition

2656
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
so people come and go basically you know

2657
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
so you don't always give them the secrets

2658
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
because they're the folks that tend to leave

2659
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
and go somewhere else you know what I mean

2660
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
so they usually find things out

2661
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
the day everybody else finds them out so

2662
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
it's a little weird to me that they

2663
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
would know about this but you know

2664
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
they might know a guy in another department

2665
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
or something you know but regardless

2666
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
it was probably inappropriate of them to say

2667
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
something about this on the outside

2668
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
but at the same time

2669
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
is this really shocking news

2670
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
that Netflix is probably

2671
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
not the holdout about

2672
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
Netflix being on the Switch

2673
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
does that surprise you Loki to hear that

2674
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
Netflix is not the problem with

2675
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
Netflix on the Switch is not Netflix

2676
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
does that surprise you

2677
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
yeah it does? no

2678
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
oh okay I was like

2679
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
surely you're being sarcastic

2680
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
of course I am Loki don't fuck with me tonight

2681
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
I'm not in a good mood alright just kidding

2682
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
uh yeah

2683
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
says I'm sure Netflix

2684
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
on Switch is inevitable

2685
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
says I think it would be more shocking

2686
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
if Netflix didn't have an app

2687
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
ready I'm just curious again

2688
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
I know I've said this a thousand times but I'm

2689
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
very curious about the whole fact like will you

2690
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
really be able to pick it up and take it on the

2691
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
go with you I mean in the house certainly

2692
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
it would still work off wifi but

2693
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
I mean like something like Riverdale

2694
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
which you can download to your device

2695
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
can I pick that up and leave the house

2696
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
and watch it because maybe it's buffered

2697
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
in the background like at a certain point

2698
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
the Switch will tell me like boom

2699
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
the episode's completely downloaded and I can pick it up

2700
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
and take it with me on public

2701
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
transit wherever I want to go

2702
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
oh no we'll see

2703
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
sounds like it's up to Nintendo to tell

2704
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
us that you can download it to the Switch's

2705
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
massive 32 gigabytes of storage

2706
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
well believe it or not those movies

2707
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
are not very big there may be

2708
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
less than a gigabyte so

2709
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
you know you could download a couple things

2710
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
you can't download a lot but you get to have one or two things

2711
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
at a time that's not crazy so

2712
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
anyhow let's go

2713
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
and travel around the world and check out some

2714
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
video games coming out in other countries

2715
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
like the US to start Loki

2716
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
yes and so this is probably a game that

2717
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
Jamie is playing Danganronpa

2718
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000

2732
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
Megaton Rainfall which is on PlayStation 4

2733
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000

Gundam Versus on PlayStation 4

2763
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
This isn't really counted as a release but because

2764
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
you know the whole Super NES

2765
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
Classic Edition is coming out on Friday

2766
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
they also mention Star Fox 2

2767
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
which I guess technically is being released

2768
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
but that's kind of a stretch

2769
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
That is a little bit of a stretch but I guess

2770
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
I did want to mention though, since you're a fan

2771
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
Cults of

2772
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
Revolt is coming out the following week

2773
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
on 3DS

2774
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
I am excited about that

2775
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
I know they were promoting that a little bit on

2776
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
it has its own little

2777
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
3DS collectible puzzle piece

2778
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
thing and all that

2779
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
too, so that's pretty exciting

2780
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
Alright, let's travel to Japan and check out

2781
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
what is going to be coming out in Japan

2782
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
and let's see, looking at

2783
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
the list for

2784
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
September the 28th

2785
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
we have coming out Fire Emblem Musou

2786
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
is out in Japan, I believe that is on

2787
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
PlayStation 4

2788
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
I'm sorry, that is a new

2789
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
Nintendo 3DS game, sorry my list

2790
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
this week doesn't have it separated by

2791
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
what platform they're on

2792
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
so it's a little more challenging for me

2793
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
so that is on the new 3DS this week

2794
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
also coming out this week we have

2795
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
NAC 2, gets its Japanese release on the

2796
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
28th, there's also

2797
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
Fire Emblem Musou in a premium box

2798
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
so that is something to look forward to as well

2799
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
which is on the Switch as well as the 3DS

2800
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
they have a game called

2801
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
Nora Princess and Stray Cat

2802
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
comes out this week

2803
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
and that is on the PlayStation Vita

2804
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
looks like it might be based off an anime

2805
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
and then also in Japan

2806
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
Fallout 4 gets a new game of the year edition

2807
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
so it's like a price reduction

2808
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
so that is coming out as well

2809
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
that's basically the game and DLC

2810
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
they're releasing over here too

2811
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
that whole thing is out in Japan as well

2812
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
and then of course FIFA 18 will be a big release

2813
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
and that is out on the PlayStation 4 this week

2814
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
let's take a trip over to the UK

2815
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
Loki

2816
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000

on PC called

2824
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
Twickles

2825
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
I guess

2826
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
Picross S on the Switch and

2827
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
Blue Reflection on PC

2828
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
Alright, let's go to the mailbag

2829
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
because you guys

2830
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
sometimes you send us emails

2831
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000

2832
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000

Usually DarkSakura is here to read your emails

2837
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
but since she's under the weather tonight

2838
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
I will be filling in those duties in her place

2839
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
Let's start with an email from Martin

2840
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
the Belgian who emails us this week

2841
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
Dearest OLR, congratulations

on reaching 700 episodes

2843
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
It is an epic milestone and not

2844
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
many podcasts will ever reach that many episodes

2845
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
It is a testament to how committed

2846
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
you guys are and it is great to see

2847
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
you have built a real sense of community

2848
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
for so many listeners every Sunday night

2849
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
Like gathering with a group of friends

2850
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
around a campfire and sharing stories

2851
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
Perfect. I have been listening to

2852
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
this show for probably close to 10 years

2853
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
at this point and it has definitely become a part

2854
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
of my Monday mornings as I wake up at work

2855
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
and listen to the podcast. Thank you for always

2856
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
being there to provide some Monday morning

2857
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
entertainment. Rob, it was great meeting you

2858
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
in person at DragonCon. Having listened

2859
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
to you guys for so long I was definitely a little

2860
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
nervous and starstruck

2861
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
meeting you and Bobby in person

2862
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
Sorry if I was a bit awkward. Next year we

2863
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
should go and have some shots of Stroopwafel

2864
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
together. Keep up the great show

2865
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
as always. Hugs, Martin the Belgian

2866
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
You didn't strike me as nervous or

2867
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
awkward at all. So

2868
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
I'm actually only regretful

2869
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
I didn't get to spend more time

2870
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
with people but they were kind of

2871
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
for logistical reasons I don't fault

2872
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
them for it at all. They kind of had to shoo us off the stage

2873
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
to prep the next panel

2874
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
Right? So

2875
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
What we really need to do I think one of the best things

2876
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
we ever did was remember the year

2877
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
we went to PAX in Seattle

2878
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
That was 2008. That was the year I was really sick

2879
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
So we went to PAX in Seattle and we were with

2880
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
All Games then

2881
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
Wasn't the All Games broadcast

2882
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
going the whole time? I think

2883
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
Bobby was doing them. Yeah they had this whole

2884
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
side table thing that was in the hallway

2885
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
And other shows that were on the network at the time

2886
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
were coming and going. So that was the whole thing we were doing that year

2887
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
And the reason why I bring it up is that

2888
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
one thing I remember we did is we did like a dinner

2889
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
Somewhere one night where we actually

2890
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
Yeah I remember that. Yeah it sounded like

2891
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
an Asian restaurant. Yeah and we got

2892
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
to meet a bunch of listeners and it was like

2893
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
hey we're going to go to this dinner place

2894
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
Of course then when the check came out it was a nightmare

2895
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
to split but

2896
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
maybe we could find a counter diner place or something

2897
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
we could find a place to go eat at

2898
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
together and say we're going to have the

2899
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
vog dinner at XYZ time

2900
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
during Dragon Con. I think that would be really cool

2901
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
except for the fact that Dragon Con is so fucking crowded

2902
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
to do something like that you probably

2903
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
have to go like a ways away from

2904
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
the main center venue. But I don't know

2905
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
you know my fifth year at Dragon

2906
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
Con I'm learning more tricks about where

2907
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
to eat and that if you walk a certain

2908
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
direction just like two blocks away

2909
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
you're going to find restaurants with no weight

2910
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
whatsoever because like everybody is

2911
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
in that fucking peach tree center or

2912
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
you know wherever so

2913
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
yeah so anyway I bring that up because

2914
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
I think it would be really cool to maybe do something like that

2915
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
in a future year like

2916
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
next year because we already have

2917
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
vog suite booked for 2018

2918
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
so we're coming back

2919
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
next year and hopefully we'll still get to be a part

2920
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
of the podcast track and that will be

2921
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
awesome and you know I say to

2922
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
people that meet us for the first time like

2923
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
realistically like first

2924
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
off there's no need to be starstruck we're gaming

2925
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
fans just like you guys we just started this show

2926
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
so long ago but I'm very honored that

2927
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
people like get excited you know

2928
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
since I also kind of get it like you've been

2929
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
listening to us but you've never met us for maybe

2930
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
10 years that's a very long time so

2931
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
like I get it but you know trust me

2932
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
we're not we

2933
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
don't pay our bills with anything we

2934
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
make from this show so until we're at that level

2935
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
I don't think we're really that famous so

2936
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
we're probably just as starstruck to meet you

2937
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
as you are to meet us for what it's

2938
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
worth but yeah my coworker the other day I like

2939
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
told him about how we had 700 episodes like

2940
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
so you guys making money off of that I'm like

2941
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
no why not

2942
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
you should other podcasts do look at

2943
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
like Joe Rogan's like

2944
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
yes yeah

2945
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
Joe Rogan

2946
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
I don't think it works like that you can't just like

2947
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
just do that

2948
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
okay I'm just gonna make money now

2949
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
maybe you can but like eh

2950
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
sorry

2951
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
I'm laughing cause in chat act

2952
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
deft in chat says winner winner chicken

2953
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
dinner and that's what we can have at DragonCon

2954
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
I love it

2955
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
only if it can be like southern fried

2956
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
chicken there you go alright

2957
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
moving on one more email this week

2958
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
from Sam it's short and sweet

2959
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
but I'm gonna read this anyway from Sam

2960
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
hello OLR crew show 700

2961
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
was very special just because it was

2962
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
a regular show good call

2963
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
do any of you think well first off thank you for

2964
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
that you know like I

2965
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
I somehow sometimes I think that's the best way

2966
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
to do it to just acknowledge the

2967
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
big event and then do what people

2968
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
show up for every week you know I think if we

2969
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
had spent three hours just talking about ourselves

2970
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
or doing a retrospective

2971
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
or something it just wouldn't that's not the show

2972
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
you guys necessarily signed up to hear

2973
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
um retrospectives are good though

2974
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
don't get me wrong but those can be like

2975
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
specials or something like and sometimes

2976
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
we do those too remember we did that marathon show

2977
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
for nine hours that was pretty great alright anyway

2978
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
um so moving

2979
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
on with Sam's email do any of you

2980
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
think Nintendo should have put the

2981
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
NES and SNES classic systems

2982
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
on the Switch to increase

2983
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
sales thank you Sam

2984
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
uh well Sam I think that's kind of a

2985
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
common complaint here at Orange Lounge Radio

2986
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
uh is kind of one of those

2987
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
what are they doing when we see that the NES

2988
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
and the Super Nintendo games they're on the Wii

2989
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
they're on the Wii U but for whatever reason

2990
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
they're not on the Switch um and

2991
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
I think I've said this before on the show and I'm going to say it

2992
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
again is that don't get your hopes

2993
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
up that those NES and SNES classic games

2994
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
are going to show up on the Switch at least

2995
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
not in the same way um

2996
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
we know that Nintendo is working on

2997
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
something with this whole online system that they're

2998
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
doing that you're going to be able to play games

2999
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
uh it sounds like NES games like

3000
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
Balloon Fight I think is one that they've kind of shown

3001
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
that you'll be able to play it across the internet

3002
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
okay basically and that's going to be the new thing

3003
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
the thing we said virtual consoles should have done like

3004
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
ten years ago they're finally going to be bringing

3005
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
into that but that may not

3006
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
be virtual console

3007
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
I think if Nintendo does

3008
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
virtual console for Switch it's going to

3009
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
be Gabe Cube games

3010
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
maybe Wii games if

3011
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
that you know the HD

3012
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
you know the control system kind of works with

3013
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
Wii if they emulate that alright um

3014
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
you'll have that

3015
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
uh but like GameCube games and like

3016
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
the newer Nintendo games I don't think

3017
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
you're going to have the older stuff that is

3018
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
going to be reserved for the online component

3019
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
um which

3020
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
will because you're going to be paying a monthly

3021
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
fee for that uh it may or may not

3022
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
overlap really with the NES and

3023
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
the SNES classics yeah I think

3024
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
we've been sitting here for a while going it would

3025
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
be great if Nintendo just

3026
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
releases a bundle on the Switch that's

3027
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
all these classic games and I think

3028
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
people would be very happy um

3029
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
but Nintendo is gonna

3030
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
Nintendo and sometimes the things

3031
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
that they do don't always make sense to us

3032
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
well at least from what

3033
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
I've been hearing just following the whole

3034
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
SNES classic thing it does sound like

3035
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
that they are getting a lot more systems

3036
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
per location

3037
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
at least everybody that's been posting

3038
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
online they've said you know my

3039
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
GameStop only got nine NES

3040
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
classic editions they're getting 30 of

3041
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
the SNES so and a lot of

3042
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
the other locations like Walmart and Best Buy

3043
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
are getting you know double digit

3044
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
numbers you know significant double

3045
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
digit numbers so okay

3046
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
hopefully that's a good sign

3047
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
so fingers crossed this may be

3048
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
I'm actually gonna try I'm just gonna

3049
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
for the fuck of it I'm just gonna stop by Walmart

3050
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
on that day

3051
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
just to see if it's there just to see

3052
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
and I'm not getting my hopes up or whatever

3053
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
I'm just gonna see is it is curious

3054
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
here's my question is it limited

3055
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
to the places that Nintendo was saying

3056
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
or like would you be able to find

3057
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
it at more independent stores or maybe

3058
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
even other chains like Fries

3059
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
is one that comes to mind because Fries maybe

3060
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
I always forget that Fries has the

3061
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
same fucking games everybody else does Fries

3062
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
maybe I would think like big box

3063
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
stores are gonna probably have it independent chains

3064
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
are usually third rate

3065
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
when it comes to publishers

3066
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
so they're gonna supply the big box

3067
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
stores first actdeft in chat says

3068
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
you'll probably have better luck at Target and you

3069
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
know what I tend to agree you'll probably have

3070
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
better luck at Target you know what

3071
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
I don't know if the Target app still does it but it

3072
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
used to cause that's how I found a Wii U

3073
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
you could go into the Target app and it'll tell you

3074
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
like it's in stock at this store or it's not

3075
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
I may try that

3076
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
just for fun

3077
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
I'm curious I you know

3078
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
if you're gonna go to Walmart I'm gonna tell you

3079
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
exactly which one to go to I don't mean to get too local

3080
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
but do you know how we joke about the Walmart

3081
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
in the middle of nowhere

3082
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
the one over by Anatolia

3083
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
no it's not over there it's over like you gotta

3084
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
go like um okay so

3085
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
oh yeah yeah

3086
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
you go but you go the other way

3087
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
down and there's a Walmart out there where you're like

3088
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
where's the fucking people out here there's no

3089
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
people try that one

3090
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
cause that would be the one I would try

3091
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
that's a little out of my way but

3092
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
yeah I just figured I'd try the one by my house

3093
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
since it's right by my house

3094
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
ooh SSU100Matt with a good point

3095
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
in chat saying doesn't help that this Friday is

3096
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
Yom Kippur oh I didn't

3097
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
realize that but that's right

3098
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
some people are gonna be doing

3099
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
things related to that and they can't necessarily

3100
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
just go out shopping so hmm interesting

3101
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
alright

3102
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
anyway oh YYR points out though it's Friday

3103
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
night into Saturday so I guess maybe

3104
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
you could go out in the morning but you're not gonna

3105
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
be able to maybe hunt all day long so

3106
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
alright anyhow that was it for emails

3107
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
tonight thank you guys for the emails

3108
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
send us more for next week participate

3109
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
at Orangeloungeradio.com

3110
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
if you wanna participate with Mailbag next week

3111
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
we do have some more news for you guys before we get

3112
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
to the Skype line at Orangeloungeradio

3113
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
let's get to Loki with the next story

3114
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
so as we were talking about the whole steam review changes

3115
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
and stuff and how people are review bombing stuff

3116
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
one of the games that came out of course was NBA 2K18

3117
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
there was a huge backlash after

3118
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
their whole virtual currency

3119
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
this is literally what they call it because they

3120
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
couldn't think of anything creative to call it

3121
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
was kind of fuck

3122
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
fake money didn't fly

3123
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
it was kind of fucking up everything because

3124
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
one of the big gripes with this they've been doing

3125
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
virtual currency since 2K13 but one of the big

3126
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
gripes is that the

3127
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
virtual currency this time around they're really

3128
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
whoring that shit so like

3129
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
it would take several games

3130
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
of actually planning to earn that virtual currency

3131
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
to actually level up and that's only if you

3132
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
like got the best stats in the game

3133
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
whereas it could take several

3134
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
hours of grinding

3135
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
on top of that the stuff that you get

3136
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
and unlock the different customizables

3137
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
they're

3138
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
not transferable between

3139
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
your characters and like the haircuts in the game

3140
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
instead of actually unlocking the haircut

3141
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
they'll toggle it on and off and stuff

3142
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
they're going the whole Destiny 2 route

3143
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
and they are

3144
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
consumables so you get your haircut

3145
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
which originally was costing

3146
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
you know I think

3147
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
it was like 500 VC or something

3148
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
like that so it was one game

3149
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
but now they've dropped the price

3150
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
of the actual haircuts down to

3151
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
100 VC

3152
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
oh haircut I'm sorry it was 1500

3153
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
originally so they would give you like

3154
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
I think five or six thousand to begin with

3155
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
and then now they're

3156
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
kind of dropping the prices of all that

3157
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
because people aren't too happy with it

3158
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
and they're looking to see about maybe changing

3159
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
some of the other balancing it still sucks

3160
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
so that they're doing this and don't support it

3161
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
well I guess at least the company's

3162
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
kind of listening to the feedback for better

3163
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
a little bit but like I mean they've been doing it this long

3164
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
they just have to find the right balance

3165
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
between fucking over their

3166
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
consumers and them noticing

3167
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
alright

3168
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
well moving on this week a lot of people's

3169
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
childhoods

3170
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
got a harsh taste of

3171
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
reality this week and I'm sure you all

3172
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
know

3173
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
it's a little quiet and coming through but

3174
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
the Toys R Us song

3175
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
I don't want to grow up I'm a Toys R Us kid

3176
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
well you're going to have to grow up and face the facts

3177
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
that sometimes when you don't pay your bills you go bankrupt

3178
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
so that

3179
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
is what's happening with Toys R Us and it's unfortunate

3180
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
because you know

3181
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
I think a lot of us have fond memories

3182
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
of going to Toys R Us

3183
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
and pulling the tag for a game

3184
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
do you know did I tell you when

3185
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
Shane and I went to Chico because he was

3186
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
hunting for Power Rangers when we drove up to Chico

3187
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
which is like a good 90 minutes two hours away from here

3188
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
we drove up there on a search for some

3189
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
damn Power Rangers toys

3190
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
but we freaked out when we went to the gaming section

3191
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
because we were like oh my god they still have tags

3192
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
here that you pulled to take up to the front

3193
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
what the fuck this is a time capsule

3194
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
there weren't a whole lot of department

3195
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
stores like it wasn't like this

3196
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
this is before like the whole Walmart

3197
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
and Target thing I mean Toys R Us

3198
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
was like the fucking

3199
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
big ass toy store

3200
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
it was a fucking event to go

3201
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
to see Toys R Us

3202
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
now to be clear they just filed for

3203
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
bankruptcy so they're not and Bobby's

3204
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
kind of yelling at us in chat

3205
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
they're not closing all their stores or anything like that

3206
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
not yet anyway but

3207
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
this isn't necessarily a very good sign

3208
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
that they have filed for bankruptcy

3209
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
however what does this

3210
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
have to do with gaming well some of you get your games there

3211
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
but some people were wondering

3212
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
with some of the news about how suppliers

3213
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
were not even letting Toys R Us

3214
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
buy from them unless Toys R Us

3215
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
basically paid cash up front

3216
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
some people were wondering is Toys R

3217
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
Us still going to get the Super Nintendo Mini

3218
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
and the answer is yes

3219
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
there will be a limited supply

3220
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
of the console remember Toys R Us

3221
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
didn't do preorders so there will be a limited

3222
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
supply of the console but Super Nintendo

3223
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
Minis may still be available to purchase

3224
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
excuse me will still be available to purchase

3225
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
if your store got enough

3226
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
from launch day which is September

3227
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
29th

3228
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
stores will open at normal time and have

3229
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
limited inventory of the console

3230
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
so we encourage customers to get in line before

3231
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
doors open on Friday morning for the chance

3232
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
to scoop up this hot item

3233
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
so maybe the one takeaway with this is that

3234
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
some people were maybe thinking

3235
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
Toys R Us was going to be their best bet

3236
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
because they didn't take preorders

3237
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
but it sounds like Toys R Us may just

3238
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
not have a very healthy stock

3239
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
of these so you may be risking it

3240
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
going to Toys R Us so you are going to

3241
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
my honest advice to you is like

3242
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
try to split up and

3243
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
hit like if you are in a household that's

3244
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
more than one person and one is going to

3245
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
be enough for you because most of these places are probably going to limit

3246
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
one per customer but if one is going to be enough for

3247
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
your household you go one store

3248
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
have your partner go to another

3249
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
store you know have

3250
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
a friend that doesn't really

3251
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
care but will help you out go to a third

3252
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
store spread out divide and conquer

3253
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
that might be the best way to do it

3254
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
alright

3255
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
rama in chat over at live.voggenetwork.com

3256
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
points out this isn't the first time Toys R

3257
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
Us has filed for bankruptcy well Toys

3258
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
R Us isn't quite the event that it

3259
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
used to be right it's not

3260
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
do your kids get excited about Toys R Us trips?

3261
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
They like going there every now and then although

3262
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
the one time that

3263
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
we can go to the bookstore

3264
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
or we can go to Toys R Us which one are you going to want to

3265
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
oh I get a bookstore why because we want to

3266
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
play at the train table there like if there's

3267
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
a train table over at

3268
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
which I don't understand either because they have

3269
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
a fucking train table

3270
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
in our house Loki most parents

3271
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
would be thrilled that their kids want to go read books

3272
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
fuck no I want to look at goddamn

3273
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
Legos and there's more Legos

3274
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
there oh this isn't about

3275
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
them it's about you no it's about my crack addict

3276
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
okay

3277
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
it's not about the kids it's about me

3278
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
needing to sniff the crack okay

3279
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
tell

3280
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
tell them you know what tell them

3281
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
next time they want to go to Barnes and Noble to play

3282
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
with the train set just tell them Barnes and Noble

3283
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
threw it in the trash

3284
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
see what happens

3285
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
no they

3286
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
play at the train table and stuff and I occasionally

3287
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
look at the Legos and I

3288
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
balk at how everything is so expensive but I want

3289
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
it and that's usually

3290
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
alright moving on

3291
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
Loki how about some more gaming news

3292
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
alright so Minecraft is

3293
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
still continuing on their Better Together

3294
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
updates so now it's available now

3295
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
on most of the Legacy devices

3296
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
so right now

3297
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
that update of course the one that

3298
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
allows you to play across multiple

3299
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
devices different platforms

3300
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
they have that drop now on

3301
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
Xbox One, Windows 10, Mobile

3302
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
VR and the Switch version

3303
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
will be coming soon

3304
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
but that's pretty exciting I still have yet to go

3305
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
back in there and actually try it on Windows 10

3306
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
version I'm curious to see how that

3307
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
is

3308
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
yeah I mean

3309
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
great news if everybody wants to play

3310
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
together I think that we have to do that

3311
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
in the realms area so I'm

3312
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
sorry it also offers the ability

3313
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
to share invites invite links

3314
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
to the realms which is basically their

3315
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
version of like servers

3316
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
which I still think that costs

3317
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
money each month but it's kind of interesting

3318
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
it'd be interesting to go back to that

3319
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
I remember when we ran a server if it wasn't such a

3320
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
pain in the ass I'd still do it

3321
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
it was just you know even it wasn't that

3322
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
expensive it was like $5 a month but

3323
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
it was just kind of a pain

3324
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
in the ass to do updates especially when you have mods

3325
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
in doing updates it's just a pain in the

3326
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
ass to do that but maybe vanilla

3327
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
we could do vanilla I don't know

3328
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
yeah the VOG Minecraft server was

3329
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
a fun thing for a little while

3330
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
but I would maybe be more willing to do

3331
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
this because in this way a lot

3332
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
more people I would think maybe hopefully be able to

3333
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
play because it's on console and you can just go

3334
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
check it out there

3335
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
I bet that would be awesome

3336
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
also some awesome news from Nintendo

3337
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
catching up with the digital age

3338
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
this is great there is now a

3339
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
new app authenticator for Nintendo

3340
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
so you can actually get two factor

3341
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
authentication on your Nintendo account

3342
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
which you know in this day and age

3343
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
when we have stolen passwords left

3344
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
and right from break-ins and what have you

3345
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
I shit you not this week I had

3346
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
text messages while I was sleeping

3347
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
on Wednesday or Thursday night

3348
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
my Blizzard account got

3349
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
like 5 text messages

3350
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
your Blizzard authenticator code is

3351
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
in this code they came in

3352
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
somebody was fucking trying to get into my Blizzard

3353
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
account and I guess had somehow

3354
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
figured out my password which isn't this

3355
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
interesting I use a unique password

3356
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
for Blizzard that I don't use anywhere else

3357
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
so not only

3358
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
do I use a unique password I don't use anywhere

3359
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
else but I also have two factor authentication

3360
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
on and somehow somebody got the Blizzard password

3361
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
I'd really like to know how that happened because

3362
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
I don't have to log into

3363
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
Blizzard anything anywhere like ever

3364
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
so it's very strange

3365
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
to me that that happened

3366
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
but anyway for whatever reason I got a bunch

3367
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
of Blizzard so I went in and changed my password

3368
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
but thankfully two factor authentication

3369
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
saved somebody going in there

3370
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
and you know probably trying to get into my WOW

3371
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
account although joke's on them I cancelled that a while

3372
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
ago so anyway

3373
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
maybe you don't want somebody getting

3374
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
into your Nintendo account and you know

3375
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
buying stuff that they turn around and sell

3376
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
like what was the big thing on Xbox

3377
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
it's the fake money shit

3378
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
like NBA 2K18

3379
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
stuff that's the stuff they get in there

3380
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
and they buy a bunch of it and sell it so anyway

3381
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
good news Nintendo's

3382
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
catching up to this maybe because of

3383
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
NBA 2K18 who knows but

3384
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
yeah I would definitely recommend

3385
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
you enable the two factor authentication I think

3386
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
that'd be a great idea to enable it you

3387
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
go to Nintendo's login web

3388
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
portal over at accounts.nintendo.com

3389
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
slash login and then you're gonna

3390
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
check out the sign in and security section

3391
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
you have to verify your email

3392
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
address and then you can enable the two factor

3393
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
authentication every

3394
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
new login from your Nintendo account requires

3395
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
authorization from you besides

3396
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
just the login and password via

3397
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
an app or a code

3398
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
texted to you which is kind of the modern way

3399
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
of how most of these things work so

3400
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
good job Nintendo getting on that TFA

3401
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
before you start charging people

3402
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
for online good job

3403
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
just a couple more stories for you

3404
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
guys and then it'll be Skype line time

3405
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
but first Loki alright and then

3406
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
this is a shock to no one

3407
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
but hey remember that Mario

3408
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
Super Mario 64 online

3409
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
game yeah there was no

3410
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
way that wasn't gonna get a copyright

3411
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
strike and of course that's what happened

3412
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
they've been copyright striking

3413
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
the crap out of any videos that were posted

3414
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
on there on

3415
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
YouTube at least with it and

3416
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
of course you know apparently

3417
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
the developer of the

3418
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
online game has been

3419
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
you know basically stating that

3420
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
it's gonna take a break from it for a little bit

3421
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
until after Super Mario

3422
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
Odyssey comes out and they're gonna

3423
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
hopefully release some updates

3424
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
after that but

3425
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
yep I'm not surprised

3426
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
that this happened I mean

3427
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
why not

3428
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
makes sense yeah I don't think a lot

3429
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
of us are very surprised at this at all

3430
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
but it's just the videos so far they've been taken down

3431
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
I don't think they've actually tried to

3432
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
ah the Patreon's gone too I'm pretty sure

3433
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
well

3434
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
no cause they're I don't

3435
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
know if the Patreon's gone yet but

3436
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
I think it was I think that was the big problem

3437
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
see here this is the guy making money off it

3438
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
oh yes okay so they did

3439
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
a strike against the Patreon thing

3440
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
and the YouTube videos were down he hasn't

3441
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
received the cease and desist yet

3442
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
but it may come to that if he

3443
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
doesn't stop updating it but

3444
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
it's out there now so there's it's too late

3445
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
honestly the Patreon was

3446
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
the real problem here I think Nintendo kinda would've

3447
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
done this eventually anyway especially with all the blog

3448
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
coverage it was getting but the Patreon

3449
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
like made it happen faster because

3450
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
the fact that the guy was getting money off of it

3451
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
I mean no matter what

3452
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
you wanna say the reality is

3453
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
Nintendo was gonna say he's making money

3454
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
off of our character and that's a no

3455
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
no you know there's

3456
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
yeah there's only so many ways you can

3457
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
spin that I mean I thought the mod was

3458
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
great and I wish he could work on the mod

3459
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
but he's gonna have to find other ways to get

3460
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
compensation from people

3461
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
Nintendo can you please carry forward with this idea

3462
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
right that would be awesome

3463
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
to see like old games with like a twist

3464
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
like this I know I kinda love it

3465
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
well like even like they went back

3466
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
and they redid Excitebike not that long

3467
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
ago where it's like online now

3468
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
you know it's just a little shitty thing but it was

3469
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
cool for a week

3470
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
you know so I think it would be neat to

3471
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
go back to Mario 64 and add some of this stuff

3472
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
into it so

3473
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
or maybe these games just need to find new

3474
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
collaborations such as they did

3475
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
in our last story tonight with

3476
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
Sonic Forces

3477
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
that's right at an announcement at Tokyo Game Show

3478
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
2017 there is going to be an official collaboration

3479
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
between Sonic Forces and

3480
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
Hooters

3481
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
that's right but this is Hooters in Japan

3482
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
I didn't even know Hooters was in Japan

3483
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
is Hooters in Japan a class year joint or is it

3484
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
what's the difference

3485
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
I've never been to Hooters in Japan

3486
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
maybe the menu items

3487
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
I don't know hopefully their food doesn't suck

3488
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
has anyone in chat ever been to Hooters

3489
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
I feel like the okay so here's the thing

3490
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
we didn't have Hooters in California for the

3491
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
longest time right

3492
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
it was like a thing where it was like oh we've heard of this but that's like

3493
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
I think they've closed down all the Hooters over here

3494
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
the only one that I know of that's still running is

3495
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
the one in Rancho is still open no it's not

3496
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
it's not yeah it's closed oh shit

3497
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
maybe they are all closed

3498
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
it's infidel yeah it's gone

3499
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
oh shit no that was still open not that long

3500
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
ago oh maybe they are all gone

3501
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
I don't know but anyway well I guess they're gone

3502
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
well here's the thing like you know when they first

3503
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
finally came to California after all this time it was like

3504
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
oh let's go to Hooters and then I think everybody

3505
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
realized oh wow their food sucks

3506
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
the food sucks

3507
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
and you know I was always

3508
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
you know obviously I've made no secret

3509
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
that I'm gay on this show so you know

3510
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
the ladies at Hooters don't really do it for me

3511
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
but I always thought they were really nice and friendly

3512
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
they were very friendly it was a little

3513
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
weird I mean it was just kind of like

3514
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
hey why are you sitting down at my table to take my order

3515
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
that's a little weird

3516
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
I always thought it was

3517
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
I get it that you're trying to be friendly and busty but you know

3518
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
it's just it's weird

3519
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
and it wasn't that we I remember we went to

3520
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
the one that was

3521
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
with Annie and Jim actually

3522
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
we hadn't gone and we went there

3523
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
Flaco Jones and wife yes

3524
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
Flaco Jones and wife so we went there and

3525
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
I remember I

3526
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
got a hamburger and the hamburger was kind of

3527
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
crap and then I was like okay well

3528
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
everybody says the wings are good so

3529
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
I'm gonna try the wings it took an hour to get

3530
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
wings and

3531
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
they were not good I did not

3532
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
like them but then again to be fair I don't like

3533
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
buffalo wings but

3534
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
they I've tried

3535
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
their wings in different sauces

3536
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
other hooter locations

3537
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
and I've been the three or four different

3538
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
ones not liking any of them

3539
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
their food was just no thanks

3540
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
wow sure enough

3541
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
so I'm looking I'm looking at the news from the SACB

3542
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
on June 9th the Hooters and Rancho Cordova

3543
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
closed uh the second

3544
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
Hooters closing in a year because the one over by

3545
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
Arden Mall closed I'm sorry I know this is a worldwide

3546
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
podcast which you didn't have to this involves

3547
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
our hooters local news okay but

3548
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
it involves our hooters and so this is important

3549
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
um so anyway

3550
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
uh this was a decision made by the landlord

3551
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
as they exercised the right to terminate

3552
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
the lease pursuing a different direction

3553
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
with the property so they

3554
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
didn't want to hooters there anymore that's dumb

3555
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
it was kind of dumb I thought

3556
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
it was just because that's what happened to Ferrell's

3557
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
you know that turned into Old Spaghetti Factory recently

3558
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
cause that place Ferrell's was

3559
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
always fucking hopping we don't like ice

3560
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
cream fuck you guys

3561
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
it's just this kind of clientele

3562
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
is not good for us

3563
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
oh my we want hooters there

3564
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
uh the one in

3565
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
Arden did you know what it's getting turned

3566
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
into I had no idea the one in Arden

3567
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
a sizzler

3568
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
hahaha

3569
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
that's funny

3570
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
yeah in April it was announced that the site

3571
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
would become a sizzler

3572
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
hahaha

3573
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
fuck this hooters nonsense

3574
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
but the SACB does point

3575
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
out there is one remaining

3576
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
hooters and it's the one

3577
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
in Natomas the one by the movies in Natomas

3578
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
how ironic

3579
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
there it is

3580
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
alright now you're all up to speed

3581
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
on the local hooters drama

3582
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
but good old

3583
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
dar to see ya in our chat room found us

3584
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
a hooters of japan menu

3585
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
so they have such things like

3586
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
salads with cob salad

3587
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
shrimp and spinach salad this is all

3588
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
the same shit you can get here right there's nothing really

3589
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
I don't think I see anything that's

3590
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
out of the norm really

3591
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
do they have all these sandwiches and stuff

3592
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
muscle with garlic butter that sounds

3593
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
fancy for seafood so maybe

3594
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
they have a couple extra items but not really

3595
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
so sounds kind of very

3596
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
similar to what we have here anyway where the fuck

3597
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
were we oh yeah Sonic the Hedgehog in

3598
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
hooters hahaha

3599
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
they're going to be doing a collaboration

3600
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
but the collaboration starts

3601
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
in the middle of October and further information

3602
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
is to come they didn't really say what it's

3603
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
going to be and if Amy will

3604
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
be involved but I somehow

3605
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
think not what do you think

3606
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
what do you think the Sonic and hooters collaboration

3607
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
will be I would say tweets

3608
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
from the Sonic the Hedgehog account for sure

3609
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
what

3610
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
well the only thing I can think that has

3611
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
that's in common with hooters

3612
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
and Sonic the Hedgehog is

3613
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
the hooters food

3614
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
makes you gotta go fast

3615
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
so

3616
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
I mean that's kind of a

3617
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
tie in right there

3618
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
other than that

3619
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
I have no idea but you know what

3620
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
good night everybody

3621
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
show's cancelled kids need

3622
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
more kids need to come to hooters

3623
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
I guess because it's awkward

3624
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
it's such a kids restaurant

3625
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
it's all about owls everybody loves owls

3626
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
everybody loves owls Sonic the Hedgehog

3627
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
is not an owl last time I checked

3628
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
oh he's getting another friend

3629
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000

we wait to see if a call comes in I do have skype

3640
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
running I have to do the whole ipad

3641
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
thing again tonight but I think it should work

3642
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
so anyway meanwhile

3643
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
I'm going to check in with loki and see if there's any last minute stories

3644
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
I didn't really have anything last minute but did you

3645
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
get to catch the new trailer for the new

3646
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
Tomb Raider oh the movie

3647
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
yes I did I did watch it and I totally

3648
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
recognize scenes from the game like the whole thing in the boat that was

3649
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
the beginning of the game yeah it looked kind of cool except for the

3650
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
clicking in the background of the trailer

3651
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
but I know that was for artistic

3652
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
effect was it I don't even

3653
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
really pick that up it's neat

3654
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
I look better

3655
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
better than some of the other Tomb Raider movies

3656
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
yeah yeah so yeah no I would go

3657
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
see it I mean I never seem to get to go to

3658
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
movies anymore but I would go see it for sure

3659
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
so anyway we do have a call coming

3660
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
in so I'm going to try to pick this up here and

3661
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
connect on our skype line and we will get

3662
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
to the telephones

3663
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
uh hello you're on orange lounge radio who's this

3664
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
uh this is

3665
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
yyr hey yyr how you doing

3666
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
I'm doing okay I guess the

3667
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
ipad is working yes the ipad is

3668
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
where it's a little slower to connect which I don't like

3669
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
but it works it gets the job done

3670
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
ipad therefore I am

3671
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
uh well

3672
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
uh actually the main reason why I'm calling

3673
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
is because I wanted to

3674
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
answer your inquiry from last week

3675
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
which you may or may not actually remember

3676
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
um I guess

3677
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
I can see the expression on your face

3678
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
means I should probably remind you

3679
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
shit I forgot I forgot that we have a

3680
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
camera now because of this ipad alright

3681
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
now you

3682
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
you have nothing to be ashamed of it's a fine

3683
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
looking face so um

3684
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
anyway

3685
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
um yes it was

3686
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
was mentioning that

3687
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
you know I came to this realization about

3688
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
the shift keys on a typical

3689
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
keyboard not being the same size

3690
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
yes because I was working on the

3691
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
interface for super multitasking

3692
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
and you were wondering why does

3693
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
that matter what does this have to do

3694
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
with the interface so

3695
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
so yeah uh as you

3696
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
may recall super multitasking is a

3697
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
game which has you playing

3698
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
multiple games at the same time

3699
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
in various areas of the screen

3700
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
and now there's nothing I

3701
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
can do to make this easier but what I

3702
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
did want to do is give the player

3703
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
uh as many tools

3704
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
as possible to

3705
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
make playing it

3706
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
at least as

3707
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
frustration free as possible so that

3708
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
they can focus on actually trying to

3709
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
multitask so and one

3710
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
way I do that is by

3711
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
in each area of the screen where a game can

3712
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
appear I label what controls

3713
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
are used in that area

3714
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
for example in that left side

3715
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
slot where you can use the left

3716
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
stick or the d-pad I have

3717
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
visual representation of both

3718
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
the left stick and the d-pad

3719
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
you know so just in case you know

3720
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
oh uh there's a game over there what

3721
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
do I play it with again oh yeah

3722
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
so now here's the thing

3723
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
this is the first version of this game that allows

3724
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
you to use the keyboard as

3725
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
well as a controller

3726
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
but not just that I don't

3727
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
just set up a configuration

3728
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
and force you to use it you can

3729
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
define any key configuration

3730
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
you want

3731
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
good man because accessibility

3732
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
very important but I still

3733
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
wanted to visually represent

3734
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
the keys that you have selected

3735
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
no matter what keys they

3736
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
were so I wanted to

3737
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
visually represent all of the different keys

3738
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
in the background and

3739
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
since some keys are wider than others

3740
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
if you want to do that properly

3741
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
well let's just say I measured

3742
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
all of the key widths on

3743
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
a couple of different keyboards

3744
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
and uh yeah

3745
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
so

3746
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
what did you think of the realization

3747
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
that some shift keys are

3748
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
larger but some are not

3749
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
I think it's

3750
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
kind of like a metaphor

3751
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
for life really

3752
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
mostly about penis sizes

3753
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
uh yeah I think

3754
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
you're just going to have to do your best with

3755
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
that representation YYR and

3756
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
it is what it is in that regard and if somebody

3757
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
really sends you an email that says you

3758
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
did not accurately represent the shift key

3759
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
on my keyboard then just take that email

3760
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
and throw it away

3761
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
I'll just say I did the best I could

3762
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
I mean I hope that

3763
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
there are a few people that are like

3764
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
wow that is some crazy attention to

3765
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
detail there so

3766
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
we know we need to all review bomb

3767
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
multitasking by saying the

3768
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
shift key no it's a positive

3769
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
it's going to be an uplifting review bomb to say

3770
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
the shift key was appropriately

3771
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
represented

3772
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
well I just believe in equal

3773
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
representation for all my keys

3774
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
good good for you you're a good man

3775
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
YYR any hints

3776
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
on when we might be playing

3777
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
multitasking for ourselves?

3778
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
I am feverishly trying to complete

3779
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
all of the various and sundry

3780
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
things on my list some of which

3781
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
weren't there a day ago but I just

3782
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
keep finding things that I meant to do

3783
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
anyway but never actually

3784
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
wrote down so I

3785
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
originally had said fall

3786
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
I think fall officially ended three

3787
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
two days ago something like

3788
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
fall just started two days ago

3789
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
oh no

3790
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
I meant oh summer oh you're right

3791
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
yeah summer I had said summer

3792
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
so fall just started and I missed

3793
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
I missed summer so I'm

3794
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
now saying fall and I hope

3795
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
I will be able to complete it and release it

3796
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,000
during the fall so otherwise

3797
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
it will be my own fall that's alright

3798
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
fingers and toes crossed for you that you can

3799
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
do it it's you know what you're not the first

3800
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
developer to ever have to delay a release date

3801
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,000
so at least you can you know feel that

3802
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
and you know insert

3803
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
something about a bad game is bad forever

3804
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
blah blah blah perfect you

3805
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000

3806
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
release the game and the shift the shift

3807
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
key was not right

3808
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
shift gate

3809
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
shift

3810
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
gate

3811
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000

meh talking about the tomb raider thing we were talking about

3848
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
before that last call dungeon

3849
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000

3850
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
neat the poster was meh

3851
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
there you go

3852
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
let's see mxc in chat

3853
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
says I have so many xbox live indie

3854
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
game titles yeah I had

3855
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
quite a few too but I haven't

3856
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,000
plugged in my xbox 360 in the longest

3857
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
time it's sad but there's just

3858
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
not a lot I mean with the backwards compatibility now

3859
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
on xbox one there's very little that

3860
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
I would need the 360 to play and it's

3861
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
like I've got enough between

3862
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
xbox or

3863
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
between the playstation 4 the switch

3864
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
xbox one I've got enough so that I'm not

3865
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
on 360 so

3866
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
they have a game that just hit early access

3867
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
ballistic ng

3868
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
which you may not recognize that but it is

3869
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
a wipe out

3870
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
type clone that's on

3871
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
steam like the racing game yeah and it has

3872
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
I think I want to say

3873
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
market or the steam

3874
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
I think you can do customized

3875
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
stuff in there maybe not I don't know

3876
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
they have a modding api so that's kind of cool

3877
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
but you can check it out it's five

3878
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
dollars oh that's not bad

3879
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
yeah that's a good price all right

3880
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000

yes they do all right

3895
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
well I am not hearing our skype line light up

3896
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
so I think that is going to do it for the skype line tonight

3897
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
um sorry if you were trying

3898
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
and you couldn't get through for whatever reason but you can

3899
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
always um you know you can always uh

3900
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
send us an email at participate at orange

3901
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
lounge radio dot com or uh you can

02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
always send us a tweet twitter dot com

3903
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
slash o l r but I guess for tonight

3904
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
we are going to wrap up I know it was a little bit of a shorter

3905
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
show tonight but we didn't have dark soccer tonight and

3906
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
well you know it's a little just just not as

3907
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
much to say tonight some weeks are just a little slower

3908
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
than others but uh that's all right we'll be

3909
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
back again to do it in seven days uh if you liked

3910
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
what you did hear we did fill a good two hours here

3911
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
at orange lounge radio tonight so if you did like what

3912
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
you heard here at orange lounge radio tell a friend

3913
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
or two about the show help us spread the word

3914
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
because we are the show where every gamer has a voice

3915
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
but um you know if the voices aren't here we can't

3916
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
really hear them so a nice five star review on a site

3917
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,000
like itunes google play or

3918
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
wherever it is you found this show goes an awful

3919
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
long way um

3920
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
I think uh

3921
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
we should probably wrap it up with some final thoughts

3922
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
loki your final thought tonight

3923
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
uh my final thought is

3924
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
I'm gonna work on more

3925
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
lego stuff this week actually I've been using a lot

3926
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
of the digital designer so it's been fun

3927
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
I've been trying to do a mock of my

3928
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
house but the problem is it's so

3929
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
huge um

3930
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
it's just like it's gonna take up four base plates

3931
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
so that's that's way too big

3932
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
that's gonna take up like a whole table so

3933
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
I need I'm trying to shrink it down

3934
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
but it's hard to shrink down

3935
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,000
uh floor plan on my house

3936
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
alright and uh my final

3937
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
thought tonight is uh I need to make sure

3938
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
I play something new this week I'm enjoying playing

3939
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,000

3940
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,000
stuff I need to make sure I play something new this week

3941
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
so I will uh I will do that

3942
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
