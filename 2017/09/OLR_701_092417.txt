Orange Lounge Radio
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
This week Sega does what Nintendo and improves it with an official collaboration between Sonic Forces and Hooters
Hopefully this goes better than when they partner with Soap Shoes
We have plenty more news from The Week in Gaming and it all starts right now on the show where every gamer has a voice
Orange Lounge Radio
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice
It is Orange Lounge Radio
Live tonight with episode number 701 for this September the 24th of 2017
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me on Twitter at Skie
I am joined in studio every week, each and every week with DarkSakura usually
But sadly she's not here tonight, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers is recovering from a cold
Some type of sick, I think it was a cold, I'm a bad friend, I don't remember exactly what it is she had
I think it was summer flu or something
So whatever it was, it sounded like it was bad so we hope she feels better soon
She said she's feeling better today but she's still kind of like, I don't really want to get you guys sick
And you know, doing the show, it does take a little bit of energy and so forth
So DarkSakura just wants to take the night off to get better and we understand that
And the voice you just heard there of course joining me here, Techmaster Loki
Hello, I'm here
Hi Loki, how are you?
I'm fine
Yeah? Not sick, that's good right?
I think just allergies but other than that
What else is new living here in lovely Sacramento, California where our show is based
That would be the capital folks if you've never heard of it
Arnold Schwarzenegger once had a job here, it was in the news for that anyway
So you're full of breadsticks tonight
Yep
Once again, they're quoting 20 minutes and it takes 40 minutes for them to make fucking breadsticks
I know it takes 5 minutes to make
It's because they're under, well they're going to be under new management
They had a sign that said they got sold to another corporation
Yeah I was going to say, when was the last time you were there you said I'm not going back there anymore
Well I wasn't going to go back there yet and I decided
Because I was going to pick something else to eat
And then I was like I can't decide what I want so I was like ok I'll just do breadsticks
I'll give them another go
And sure enough they fuck it up again
It's like, dude you guys come on
I can see you guys back there just fucking off
You're just like talking and not hurting, there's no hustle
Something the listeners should understand is that you're not just being one of those
I'd like to speak to your manager individuals but you actually used to work at the same pizza chain
Yes I used to work
That was your minimum wage job
It wasn't at this particular round table but it was another one
I did everything from washing dishes to working the counter to making pizzas
To breaking down the oven and cleaning it
You did it all
To management, I was a shift manager at one time
Oh my god guys can you imagine Loki as your boss
I yelled a lot yes
It was a mutual understanding
So we do tape live every Sunday night at the voice of geeks network
vognetwork.com
It's 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show
And speaking of Bobby, he was having a conversation on his show tonight
He was talking about a big topic in gaming tonight which we'll get into a little bit later
About the whole deal that's going on with Player Unknown Battlegrounds
Which is a game that obviously I've seen that it's popular on Twitch
Only $29.99 apparently
And usually when I drop in on streams I'm kind of like, I don't really get it
But I've had more and more people especially since we have a Discord server now
That's actually been fairly active
And if you want to join our Discord server please
Over at vognetwork.com slash Discord you can join in
More and more people are saying like Rob you should really check this game out
Well sadly I didn't do that this week
But I did go and I watched some more streamers
And I kind of made myself watch a little more of it
And I was like okay, I get this game a little more
But something that Bobby brought up on his show tonight was the whole tagline that you get for winning
The winner winner chicken dinner
That's a common saying out there
Is that like a regional thing?
Do they say that far and wide?
Would they know what I mean in Canada
If I said that little jingle
I don't know, is that worldwide? I don't know
But I was thinking in your case Loki
Maybe the game should allow you to customize
Maybe that could be a micro transaction
That you could pick your own dinner
And so Loki when you win in PUBG
You could get winner winner breadstick dinner
I'm fine with chicken, it's more sense
We don't need to appeal to a mass audience here
What about a winner winner turducken dinner
Winner winner bacon dinner
I feel like there's a market here
That PUBG creators should be listening to
No, no
Because they already have micro transactions in the game
Well as I said we do tape live Sunday nights at the voice geeks network
And you guys can chat along with us and participate with our show
Because we are the show where every gamer has a voice
And we invite you guys to sit down with us every week
Over at live.vognetwork.com
Where we do have our live chatters going
Come on Nolga starts us off tonight saying
I can relate Loki
I used to work at a Starbucks and I can't stand
When baristas don't steam milk
The way that they are trained to do it
Oh man I went into a Starbucks once with my friend
That used to work at one and I swear
She was about to have a breakdown
Because everything was disorganized in the store
Stuff was everywhere and she was like
How the fuck are they getting away with this order
It usually works to their benefit
Because I'm more patient because I understand
I've been there I'm not gonna get mad at you
Because it's not in your control
But dude I mean come on
There's a guy like he's like I need a box
I just need a small box
And the guy that's like cutting you know the pizzas
And putting them boxes just staring right at him
It's like are you gonna fucking do something
Like maybe ask him what he wants
Are you gonna say hey there's someone at the counter
Maybe someone back here that's fucking around
Maybe like go help him
I think one of these days you need to put on your old
Uniform under what you're wearing
Oh I don't have any more
Dude those uniforms are fucking
Crusted full like nasty ass
You know pizza sauce
It's just like it
No it's not a thing that I would
Want to wear again but
No those got thrown out a while ago
No seriously it's
I get it I get it
It's like you guys may or may not know
I trained for a call center for many many years
This was the job that I did
And so when I call
Like call centers I usually have a lot of patience
From people on the line because I know you know what they're
Going through and so forth and I never lose
My shit with somebody on the phone
If even if I'm upset I'm gonna
I'm gonna start off by saying like
I'm really upset that this is happening
I know it's not your fault but is there anything
You can do to help me like I always you know kind of
Be nice about it like I'm pissed but I'm not pissed
At you which trust me those folks
Really appreciate
But I get it but then when I get like the really
Lazy where it's like I totally
Know this person is like trying to shoo me off the line
Doesn't care does it like I get
Really frustrated and I never
I never yell I still don't yell I'm not that type
I just hang up and call back and get somebody else
Right like they were cool like last
Time that that happened you know they
The manager actually did call me and leave a message
Later on and like he was probably
Gonna like they already caught me that one
Time so I was like that's fine
You took care of it then I don't need to talk to your
Manager to say hey
You guys are slow in this particular instance
I don't like I don't like to make a fuss
There's no point in doing that it's not gonna accomplish anything
But some people love to make a fuss and it's always like oh god
Oh yeah I know I know
So awkward stop making a fuss
So many I know the owner
And they would come in like they would
Fucking like there's one family
They claim they knew the owner
They did know the owner and we
Knew them all like everybody in the store
Knew them cause every time they'd come in
They would complain about their pizza
Doesn't matter what they ordered
They would have a complaint about it cause they were trying to get it for free
Every time
So fucking annoying
But yes those people do exist
Alright we will get to video games
I promise but I wanted to read some more comments
And chat over at live.voggenetwork.com
Let's see
Tigerclaw asks why does it always have to be chicken dinner
What if you want a steak dinner?
That's what I'm saying
Like you know a steak dinner that's a reward
Like when I get to go to Ruth Chris
Like I'm putting on my slacks
To go out to the restaurant
Like this is fine dining tonight
So yeah I'm good for steak dinner
Let's see
Somebody is oh yeah Dungeon Buster suggested
Loki on the next undercover boss
And come on Noel Gus says
Loki's game needs to be a food service worker
VR simulator
Well that's kind of I mean I guess they have job simulator
But that's kind of that's different
It's already been done so well
That's a perfect example recent example
Of food service worker VR game
That's fucking weird because
We haven't had a food
A weird food service game in a while since like
Sneak King but if anyone's
Watched videos of the VR
KFC
Chicken Fry game that is
Fucking weird and I need a full game
Of that because that's just like crazy
That came up on the show a couple weeks ago yeah
There's a really fun game that one of my
Buddies on Twitch streams and I can't
Remember the name of it which is horrible
But it's like one of those food service games
And you have the ingredients that and people
Come up to the table and you have to put it all together
And all that stuff and that was you know it kind of reminded
Me of that only job simulator where you can just fuck it
All up because you know it's a robot
It was something that started with an O
And it would be not overcooked not that one
It's something else had like a four three or four word
Title and this was like part two and it was
Something new so maybe maybe no
It wasn't overcooked unfortunate something else
I know that one um yeah anyway
Sorry I can't I don't always
Remember the name of every single game out there
Is that it yes MXC
Is right it's cook serve delicious that is the name
Of it it was cook good job MXC
Winner winner steak dinner MXC
It's cook serve delicious that's the name of it
So yeah that one's uh
That one looked fun so that's one you could try
Because not only do you have to cook the food
But then all of a sudden like instead of a food order coming in
It'll come in and go bing the toilet's backed
Up you gotta go fix it bing
The dumpsters full out back
So you have to go and like the part of the keystrokes you do is like
Stomp the dumpster down
Like everything so I thought it was funny
Or the rat traps have to be
Reset or just like other like random shit
Comes in in addition to the food and I thought that was
Funny so yeah I watched a
Buddy of mine playing it on twitch and I was like oh maybe I'll
Get this this will be fun so
Alright anyhow
Guys you don't suggest
Overwatch no that's a different game
We'll get into that during gaming weeks but
First let's get to our kickoff topic tonight
Believe it or not we're not just going to talk about
Food service but we want to talk a little bit about
Tokyo Game Show was this past week
Which was mainly
A Sony affair I mean
Not exclusively obviously you have a lot of
Third party developers showing the stuff
They're doing for maybe mobile phones
And so forth but um
With Microsoft you know in
Japan not really being a thing and
Nintendo sitting out Tokyo Game Show
It really is Sony's to kind of drive so that's
Why they did a big press conference which was
What it was Tuesday in Japan
Right but it was yeah like Tuesday at 6
Third time but it was Monday at midnight
For us yeah and I didn't
Like this is one of those rare occasions where I have to
Really thank Twitter because I
Excuse me I totally forgot that this was
The thing that was going to be on until
Twitter was like hey here's the YouTube stream
Stream with the English translation
Of the people on stage didn't translate
The trailers but it was enough you could understand
What was going on so I actually watched
I mean I only missed the very very beginning
Where I guess they had some type of song or something
I totally missed that thing but I saw
Yeah it was just a sizzle reel
Yeah I saw the bulk of it and I was I
I liked it dare I say I was more
Engaged than I was with E3
Because I felt like we saw
More like new things
As opposed to you know my disappointment
With this year's E3 is that it really felt like it was
Shorter and it was like it was kind of like an update
A thon but you know there were updates
In this too don't get me wrong but there were some other things
I saw in it where I was like ooh cat butt
I want to see how they're going to do that which obviously I'm talking about
Nicole Atsume is getting a VR version
Which that was kind of out of left field
I mean I don't think there were a lot of like huge surprises
Well actually no I take that back there were kind of some big surprises
Like Zone of the Enders
Getting a VR release
That's a very interesting direction from Konami
Where you have to think
At this point that Konami
Is well aware of
What's going on on the internet
Like somebody at this point
Has found out that Konami is not popular
People are saying fuck you Konami
This is brand new information
They are not happy with the way we are doing things
So I do feel like
Konami is kind of like
I feel like in a way they might be doing
Some soul searching right now
What isn't working for us
Fucking over Hideo Kojima that's not working for us
What is working for us
Making the old shit new again
Right and that's why you see
Well I mean it's working in television too
Like fucking Will and Grace is back on TV this week
But anyway
What was I going to say
Everything is old is new again
Final Fantasy 9
Nah not just that dammit
I lost my train of thought
No Zone of the Enders Konami
Oh Bomberman the Bomberman thing on Switch
That came out not that long ago right
And they began supporting that
What have they been supporting it with
Pyramid Head
And now I think they just announced
The franchise is delivered again
Right but I do feel like Konami
Is trying to like tap into like what do we have
Left to salvage this relationship
And to be fair
Their arcade division is still kind of
Chugging along like you know
U-Beat is still like I see lines for that at
Conventions and 2DX is trucking along
Dance Dance Revolution is school
I would like to see another Dance Dance Revolution come home
I understand that's not a very profitable thing
I would just like to see fucking Beatmania 2DX come home
Like yes I know it's a special controller
Come on come on
Just release something that
Is playable on a regular controller
Yes I know it'll suck but
Release like a special third party
Old school controller that will work on
PlayStation 4 like
Why do you keep robbing me of this because there's so
Many songs from what was the last one they did
I keep wanting to say Princess but I think it was
Empress 2DX Empress all the way through now
That's like that's like eight or nine
Versions of the game that have never
Come home you know anyway
But I don't know maybe some people are like
Beatmania 2DX is kind of an old
It's an old game but yet it's still going in the arcade
I mean there's an audience for it somewhere
Right I don't know anyway
I just I mean people are if they're worried about
Like the price points and you know selling that
Stuff I mean a lot of times people are buying
Like these collector's editions they're like $200
And what comes with a shitty statue
I mean
Fuck I'm sure you can manage to make a controller
Cheap or just you know
What I know this may not be the popular
Idea but it's better than nothing
Why not just release Beatmania
Online and it comes with
Like three songs for free
And the whole thing is free just to make the game
Free and it comes with like
The staple Konami songs like
20 November and you know like
Old Konami shit for free like three
Konami originals for free that you just download for free
And then just charge for song packs
Like mobile phone games do
I think there would be a lot of people that would play
Like a 2DX Unlimited type of thing
And that might even worry I mean
I would hope they would release it in the US
But I guess if it's region free I don't know
I just I feel like that could happen
Why not like um
DJ Max
Is very very very
Similar and is
Out and I've played it thanks
To Shane doing the import thing on his
Playstation 4 and it's
It's fun I like it and I
Can't wait for some of the DLC that they're going to put out
Because I really want to play like
They have like a Hatsune Miku game that's like that too
I thought they had a free one
They do it's
Hatsune Miku so it's not the falling notes
Yeah yeah they do
It's like one song that comes with that one
It's like two songs one from each pack
It's like a I don't remember the exact names
It's like Sun and Moon type of thing
You can download big I think
It's like Future Tone somebody in channel yell it out
But I think one of them
Is like older songs and one of them is like newer
From the arcade songs is kind of how it
Yeah Act F says
Hatsune Miku Future Tone
There you go
Dartetsuya in chat says
They have that the BeatMania 2DX thing I'm talking about
But it's not free that's right I forgot about this
He says it's called Infinitas
But it doesn't use the song pack model
They charge monthly for a Picelli
Or whatever okay then
It ain't on console so
Scrap it and start over
My controversial thought
Anyway sorry we deviated a little bit
We were supposed to be talking about Tokyo Game Show and Sony's press conference
And it turned into a whole I wish Konami would do this thing
But I think the
The moral of the story is
I think the Gears are
Taking at Konami and they realize
They're not loved
And cherished right now
So you're probably going to see them try to do
Some weird things over the next couple of years
To try to win people's favor back
Like that new Metal Gear Solid game
I think they will put out a new Silent Hill
Even though obviously
PT and what we saw there
That should have been it I think Konami will put out a new Silent Hill
I think they will
Hopefully it's before this
New Kojima game comes out
Because that's going to fucking
Destroy whatever they want
Well obviously it would be ridiculous to release them the same day
But assuming
The Hideo Kojima game is a next year
Release that would seem
It would seem like 2018 is a good time for that to come out
Well I'm not surprised
I was kind of hoping we'd see a new trailer
For that
But I guess we'll have to wait until December
For Death Stranding
That also might be a little played out at the PlayStation events right now
We haven't had one
There wasn't a trailer at E3
So it's been a while since December
Was the last time we had a trailer
I guess that's true
The next thing we see ought to be gameplay
And you do mention December
Obviously Sony has their big
Company event
The Sony experience
And there's also the video game awards
Usually Geoff Keighley is chummy
With Kojima
Usually they have something there
And Nintendo yeah
So he usually gets some stuff for that
Death Stranding starring Mario
Mamma Mia
This is weird
I don't know what's going on here
Suddenly I'm shirtless and the world is adoring my titties
Anyway let's talk about some other stuff
That was in Sony's press conference
Now I have to see someone recreate
The Death Stranding trailer
But CG characters from Mario
Replacing the characters
I'm pretty sure that had to have been done
It's not done yet but that would be hilarious
I would love to see that
What were some other things we got here
We got the Call of Duty World War 2 trailer
Ni No Kuni 2 trailer
Right up your alley
Earth Defense Force
I would have been more excited about Earth Defense Force 5
If they hadn't already announced that
So that was alright
Pretty soon
The one I was more excited about was the other Earth Defense Force game
Which was Earth Defense Force Iron Rain
Which is a brand new game
That's using a different engine
By a different developer
So I'm very interested in that
How do you feel about that whole different developer thing?
It was fine
The one that they did, Insect Armageddon
It was different
I liked it, it was alright
It got kind of boring after a while
The only reason that game was boring
Was because it had two levels in it
And it was also kind of hard to
Level up
Whereas the other games you kind of get weapons
By just grinding the levels
Whereas this you had to grind money to buy weapons
And that kind of sucked
But
I'll play it
I still haven't played much of Earth Defense
I need to go back to Earth Defense Force 4
Or 4.1
Because I have that and I have the DLC for it
I just haven't really played much into it
I'll do that this week because I need to go back
You know Gabe, our buddy from
I almost said Niantic
Nascent Games
Gave here locally, he loves that series
Yeah, we'll have to seriously
That was the other thing
The co-op
In 4.1 they have 4 player co-op
But that was the first game that had
More than just
2 player co-op and same screen
So that was kind of fun
I hate to backtrack a little bit
It's just the two of us tonight
And it's going to be a shorter show if I don't do some tangents
So I'm reading the comments in chat
And they're talking a little bit about Death Stranding
And now I'm stuck on this
As long as we're talking about this
Art, avant-garde, fucking weird ass video game
Here's the fucking dream team collaboration
I want to see
The Guillermo del Toro and Hideo Kojima thing
I'm here for that, that's going to be awesome
I want to see a game that fucking David Lynch makes
Can you fucking imagine
A David Lynch video game
Would that be like a David Cage game?
You know like the
Detroit, was it
Oh
It's some Detroit, I can't remember
Even, no I think
I can't remember the name, but the androids or whatever
I think it would be even weirder than that
Like Heavy Rain
Like press X to go to the next level
And then you press X, you press the O button
You are dead, like it's just weird shit that would happen
And then everybody would talk back
Fuck you, I pushed X
Tigerclaw suggests
maybe a Twin Peaks game, I don't know if I would
want it to be that direct
I feel like, how about a
Lost Highway game
Because that movie was fucked up
So maybe something like that, I don't know
We'll see
S200mad says I don't think our minds can process
a David Lynch game, it would have to be
a point and click adventure
Raginator suggests David Lynch and David Hader
Yes, perfect, perfect
All the Davids in a game, anyway
I apologize for my tangent
It was a thought I had to get out of my system
Alright
So let's follow that up with
Idolmaster, Stella Stage
is going to be out at the end of the year, December 31st in Japan
How about the big
It's out now moment
Which was ruined a little bit by a
rating that was out there earlier in the day
But eh, Final Fantasy 9
was the surprise release
And here they kind of did
Kinda, I was more like Final Fantasy 16
should be Final Fantasy 15's engine
but a Final Fantasy 9 type story
And here's Final Fantasy 9
I liked, see that's what I kind of liked about
8 a little bit and even 7
Well actually probably 6, 7 and 8
It was that whole
fantasy
It's kind of like a technology
and a fantasy setting type thing
That was one of the things that drew me into 6
Oh shit, it's like fucking Final Fantasy
Like it's all fantasy saying but then there's mechs
and you know, guns
and magic and that was kind of cool
that mix
I'm not feeling so much of the magic and guns and shit
modern day but whatever
What was the name of that? Was that the uh
Was that, that was one of that
that thing they showed right? The new Left Alive
Was that it? Or is that, no
What was that? Left Alive is a, yeah
That's the new game that I know has artwork by the guy
that did Melior Solid
Yoshi Shinkawa, and it's a shooter
from Square Enix. I just remember because you know
we're talking a lot about like oh it's kind of updates
and things but there was some new stuff
that they showed at this and that was one of them
And they showed a new trailer for
Dissidia NT
Which now of course, no big surprise
They have characters from Final Fantasy 15
in it so
Noctis I think, yeah
A lot of impressive VR stuff too
They showed, the VR segment
was pretty meaty
That was kind of nice to see Sony really
I think that's part of why I walked away
feeling favorable from what I saw at Tokyo Game Show
because I really feel like okay, Sony
is really investing in VR
It kind of showed in a way
It's not a Vita
Yeah, yeah, well yeah
That's kind of why I'm happy
Sony really is planning these other things
And I guess it felt maybe more exciting for me
than like E3 which is when we found
out the Final Fantasy game was fishing
They just really needed to bring the hardware price down
They did, in Japan
I think they did recently here too
So it is coming down
They need to push it more because I think it would be
you know, get more people involved in it
Let's see, Arc Park
was something that they were showing on VR
Gran Turismo Sport which obviously is going to be beautiful
The Zone of the Inner's thing we talked about
Niko Atsume which I joked about earlier
Let's see, Niko Niko
which is, you know, it's not really big here
but it's a YouTube, Twitch-esque
type of thing that they have in Japan
A lot of events happen on there
I couldn't believe that series is still around
A-Train has been around since like the...
I hope they release that over here
They've done some A-Train games
have been out over here
Train Sims are way
Train Sims are way bigger in Japan
I'm surprised Farm Sim hasn't gone
VR yet, but that might be something coming
Gran Turismo Sport looks cool though
Let's see, and
which I thought was something interesting
they also were pushing a Japan Studio
VR music festival and digital
theatre where you could be like in a concert
in PlayStation VR
so PlayStation VR starting
to kind of nudge itself a little bit into that
life space which
you know, not to bring up an old conversation
but I will, which is why
we speculate Facebook had bought Oculus
all that time ago is that maybe it was not just
that VR is for gaming, but VR is for life
experiences and being able to
be right in the middle of an experience
so now you see kind of Sony doing that a little bit
with PlayStation VR and this is something
you know, this is an entry
level VR thing for a lot of people
and so it's kind of neat that they're selling this
kind of different experience, this is in addition to
3-ray Blu-rays, they don't really make
movies in 360 degree just yet
but maybe Sony will have
a live show at a Sony theatre
and I'm not just talking about concerts, maybe like, I don't know
a Cirque du Soleil or a stage play
or something that maybe they'll put in VR someday
We'll see, could be interesting
could be interesting, or what about
what about y'all
if the next E3
Sony does their press conference
but you can watch it in VR
and like you're there
in the actual arena
maybe, yeah
I'd still rather watch it on screen because it's mostly trailers
but yeah
I still think doing home on PlayStation VR
is something they should do
but what would be cool is if in those trailers
like VR trailers, it's VR
like how they have the 3D trailers at the movies
where those trailers are in 3D
where some are not in 3D
Bobby Blackwolf, speaking of home, is pointing out in chat
over at live.fognetwork.com
Hey Loki, did you notice that SteamVR Home
now allows you to put the
trophies you earn in games
into your home space? Valve is greater than Sony
First off, I didn't realize there was a SteamVR Home
and yes, yes
they win obviously
because they were able to fulfill a promise
the only thing I worry about
well, I guess you can put select trophies in there
because if it's all trophies, there's some of these games nowadays
that just kick out trophies like
like crazy, so
you're just like, ah shit, there's trophies all over me
but
yeah, it's cool that you can put that stuff in there
can you visit other people's homes in there?
I mean, is there a point to it? Can you do a clubhouse
type of thing in SteamVR because that was
always, I felt like, a really missed opportunity
within PlayStation Home
well actually later on, I remember when we had that
listener, and I don't think he listens anymore, we had that guy
who set up a really fancy VOG clubhouse
and I was like, oh this is pretty cool, but like
it would be even cooler if I could
inject my own pictures into this
or audio, so we could play audio clips
from OLR or something in other
VOG shows when you're visiting the space
like, why
and I suppose they're probably worried
well, if we let people upload any old pictures
there'll just be titties everywhere
and if we let people upload audio, it'll be a copyright nightmare
but, you know
YouTube does it somehow
and it works, so it was somewhat
barely, anyway
yeah, and Bobby Blackwolf says
yes, you can visit others, you can start up a
SteamVR space and anybody can join it, or you can make your
friends only, you can even make a
custom SteamVR space, it uses
Workshop, so there you go
anyway, it's not supposed to be all about
Valve right now, it's supposed to be about Sony
but, um
well it's not my fault if Sony is not supporting
certain things that they promised several years ago
that they would support, there was an update on
Detroit, which looks like an awesome game, I'm excited
about that, a Virtual On
crossover, which I thought was
yeah, that was weird, yeah
and then, let's see
a new channel called Animax
which is going to be on the Playstation 4
which is, I guess, anime, all day every day
is it anime and skinimax?
mixed together? one can hope
maybe Animax After Dark, who knows
and last but not least, the last big thing
they showed for the day was
Monster Hunter World, and the big reveal
of the release date, January 26th
next year, obviously
2018, and it is going to be a
simultaneous worldwide release
so US, Europe, all the other
places, getting it the exact same
day, there will be a Monster Hunter
Playstation 4 Pro released
in Japan, that I think comes out a little
sooner, I don't think it actually comes out, I think comes out
like in the next couple months, so
you know, if you're an ultimate Monster Hunter fan
you can get something a little bit sooner, so
yeah, that was some of the big stuff out of Tokyo Game
Show, so that's one of those shows
I'd love to go to someday, maybe
maybe, maybe
alright, I'm fine, I'm a little worried
about the fact that, you know, I don't speak a lick of
Japanese, but hopefully I'd have a friend or something
that could help me out that does speak it
and, you know, so I don't get lost
okay, so one of the other things I was gonna mention too
that they were showing off, I think was that
PlayLink stuff, so that was the
where you use your cell phones as a controller, basically
oh, yeah, yeah, they brought them, so they had
a hidden agenda, which is a new game
as it did, that was, okay, here's the thing
that was at E3, but
do you remember how they had like an hour
or a half hour, like
pre-game before the press conference?
hidden agenda was in the pre-game
remember one of our big complaints about E3 was that
like, all the rad stuff was in the pre-game
that's when they announced Undertale was coming to Playstation 4
but that was all in the pre-game, so hidden agenda was in
that pre-game, but this was
its first Japanese unveiling, I guess
or confirmation
yeah, no, I mean, the game looks really cool
and like, it was showing the whole concept where like
one person is a traitor on the team, right
trying to
skim through a lot of that
that's okay, hence the name hidden agenda
one of the players is trying to screw all the others
so it's that, it's betrayal at House on the Hill
so it's you don't know Jack!
yeah, kind of
so, yeah, anyway
I enjoyed the Sony press conference and considering that
I was ready to just kind of go, oh, it's gonna be
you know, it's gonna be a lot of the Japan
games and stuff we never get to play here
considering I was kind of going into it with that mindset
that I wasn't really gonna see anything, I didn't even
think I'd end up watching the whole thing, I figured I'd turn it off
after 20 minutes, but I watched the whole thing
and I was like, oh, this is a really good show
good job, Sony
I felt better going out of that than I did at E3
so, I was happy
alright, we'll get into some
more stories in just a moment, but first
I wanna talk about our gaming weeks
and the types of video games that you've been playing
this week, DarkSakura not here to share
her week with us, but I'm sure it involved
lots of Dragon Ball
what is the one she's playing
online, I can't remember
Z2, oh, no, I'll tell you what
she's playing is that idle pouring game still
she got me fucking playing it too
yeah, and joining her guild, it's the
Ragnarok clicker game
but you don't really click in it
but anyway, so that
yeah, that's like
mine, it's, you know what, I'll say this
for one of those clicker games, it's pretty well done
although the translation
is a little hit and miss, but you can follow it
well enough, so you like join guilds?
yeah, you can join guilds with other people
and yeah, leaderboards and stuff like that
so there's a lot of in-depth to it
but of course it's all more ways
to have more items that you need the special currency
to buy, but I haven't spent any real
money on it yet, and don't plan to, so we'll see
anyway, but that's enough about that
how about your gaming week, Logie?
so I mainly, well this is funny enough
that we talk about idle games, I mainly played
the office space idle game, and I've actually
finished it, so
basically the whole objective of the
main game is to get to level 100 where you
become the CEO of Inateck, and
I've done that, and so
now it's just
why do I need to play this game anymore?
I don't, so
I've been playing, like they do these little events
and stuff, so you play like
almost like a separate game, where they kind of
change up the rules a little bit
and so I've been doing that to unlock more
cards, because you can assign
characters to each of your floors
and you get different bonuses
based on which characters are in the
floors, so
it's kind of a little bit like
I don't know, there's not much clicking with
in fact, actually they've really
nerfed any of the clicking in the game
so it's, you may do that
in the beginning, or do
that for your daily, trying to get 100
critical clicks or whatever
but aside from that, you're not
really, it's more of just management
and just trying to
you know, I don't know
strategy, and there's a lot of strategy involved
with it, so I played that
I didn't play
a whole ton of console games, it's mainly just
played a little bit more of the Lego movie
game
but I'm probably gonna stop playing that
because I finished it already, and I don't really
want Grind to get all the extra characters, because I
just don't care, but
Fair enough. I mean, I kind of wanted the
achievements for it, but
You don't want to platinum that bad, huh?
Well, it's not even on the PlayStation
it's on Steam, so I
I don't care, it doesn't really matter
but, yeah, it was fun
I thought about getting the Ninjago game
because it came out bad, because the movie just came out
but I think I'll just wait for the Lego Marvel
2 game that's gonna be coming out in the fall
and then of course South Park's in like a couple weeks
so, yeah
I probably will end up playing that next
but yeah, like I said, I need
to go back to Earth Defense Force 4.1
so I'll probably end up doing that, because
I haven't played that in a while
I do need to play some more VR, though
I need to finish, or actually play
Superhot VR
because I have that now
I've been meaning to try it, but every time I go
I don't really want to set it up
so, it's just laziness
that's preventing me from playing that
That's it. Alright
My gaming week, I gotta admit
not a lot of new stuff this week
I did play Super Metroid after the
show last week, and
I actually did do a follow-up stream
so, not everybody probably saw it
because it was late at night on Wednesday or Thursday, but I did do a follow-up stream
and I got so lost
and I was kind of embarrassed, because I'm like
for as much as I love this game, it was like, wow
I was really running around in circles
I was like, I could not fucking remember what I had to do
at one point, so
I think I need to make it a goal to
play through that game once a year
to just keep my
skills up and remember where
everything is and stuff, and not be like
is this when I get the ice beam?
So anyway, so I did have
fun with that, and I've been playing a little bit of
Overwatch this week, because they had the
free weekend going on, and I just
I don't know, I was into it. I actually downloaded it on
Xbox One. I've been meaning to try
because I think it went free to play
was that whole Fortnite
do they have the battle royale Fortnite that's
out now? That's something I should
probably check out, because that's free. Isn't that free on consoles too?
I think it does have a
free to play version, I think the battle royale thing
is in early access, we'll get into that in a little while
but it's going to come up in the news later
but anyway, yeah
free to play is great, but Overwatch
not free to play, but they did have a free weekend
so I finally downloaded it to my Xbox One
so I can say I've played it on
every system that it's on now
so I've played PlayStation 4, I've played PC
I didn't buy it on Xbox One, sorry
it's not really cheap enough for me to
triple dip on Overwatch, but
I just thought it would be fun to download it
and I got all my loot boxes from the Twitch Prime
thing, they just showed up automatically
on Xbox, so that was kind of cool
so yeah, there was that
that was something I played this week
and then I played a lot of Pokemon Go today
because of the Equinox event
so I played
yeah, I played a lot of that
and got Stardust and did like
four raids today, so
busy with that
yeah, that's really
continuing to do some Heroes of the Storm
but otherwise, that's pretty much been my game of the week
alright
nothing really new this week, sadly
going to our chat over at
live.vognetwork.com, tigercaw in chat says
have you been playing Samus Returns?
thank you for bringing that up
not enough, I need to play more of it
but I just, yeah
when I, like the time for me to play
DS games is when I'm like lying in bed
about ready to go to sleep and maybe I'll play a game
before I go to sleep, but lately
this week it's just been, I'm gonna lie down and
snore
so I don't ever really get around to playing the game
I need to kind of like force myself to just sit down
and spend more time with Samus Returns
because I really did enjoy the part of
what I played
Corkay is in our chat right now saying
Fortnite is not free yet
they still want you to buy the early access stuff
but I think that's in the
long term plan
I thought the Battle Royale portion was free to play
I think it will be, I don't think it is yet
alright, let's get into some
housekeeping real quick and then we will do
some news, housekeeping this week
follow us on Twitter, twitter.com
slash o-l-r, we're also on Facebook
facebook.com slash orange lounge
radio
I want to mention the Discord too, I think I did earlier
in the show but I realized last week on our
big 700th episode, I forgot to freaking mention it
so we do have a new Discord server
check it out at vognetwork.com
slash Discord, that's just gonna
that just forwards you to the
Discord with the invite code because you don't need an invite
it's open though, you don't need like a special
invitation, this is your special invitation
go to vognetwork.com slash Discord and you can join
and you get updates on the
shows and you can also like submit
stories and there's just like some general
chat and when we were doing, I was sad
because I archived the DragonCon channel today
but when we were at DragonCon, you know
we were posting pictures and live updates from that
so it's been a lot of fun, it's been a good experiment
so yeah, check that out
and then also some of our
streamers are using it for their
voice chat, like when I was doing
I did an impromptu late night
Overwatch stream on Twitch
Friday night or Saturday night
I don't remember
I didn't start the stream until like midnight
it was like an Insomniac feed
but Flaco was up and so we started playing
together and we were having a hilarious time because he was playing
on PC because it's the free weekend on PC
so he just joined the voice chat
on the VoG Discord and we were able to both talk
and you know, can be heard on the feed
so it was fun!
Cool. So there's that.
Another thing I want to give a plug for
real quick is I want to give a shout out to
the Pokemon Go podcast
because you know
Charles, who's one of the hosts over there
and I know Joe too
Charles and I have been talking
for a while about me doing some type of like
segment thing on the show
so I did a segment this week
so you can check that out on their latest episode, episode 62
so I did like a little 5 minute segment
about, since I have played
a lot of Ingress, I kind of
still keep tabs on what's going on there
and kind of talking about what happening there
and how that might relate to Pokemon Go
so yeah, it was fun
and they were very nice and they played it on the show
so check it out, so it's episode 62
I think is where that shows up
and I'm hoping to do that, if not every week
if there's not enough news every week, maybe every other week
I have a little segment there that I'll be
sending over to those guys
so big shout out and thank you to them!
Alright, let's move on
for some gaming news, Loki!
So Steam is changing up
how they're doing
their review scores
basically
what's been happening lately
with a lot of different games is
they've been getting review bombed
so for example, when
there was the announcement that
there was going to be the in-game
microtransactions with
the new Shadow of War game
when there was
the whole backlash
with the Firewatch devs
Campo Santo
basically saying that we're going to flag
PewDiePie because of his
racist comments
there was a backlash against that
where fans of PewDiePie
were going and review
bombing Firewatch
or
NBA 2K 18
because of their microtransactions
and that kind of stuff
basically what this is going to do
is it's going to kind of give you a history
so they call it a histogram
where it kind of shows you
where the
reviews kind of went down
where it's fluctuated
so for example, you can see
this was tied with this event
and so on and so forth
so it's still going to show those negative reviews
it's just going to kind of give you a bigger picture
to see, oh was this because
a recent patch has always been negative
what's
kind of the case with this?
do you think it's going to help
the review bombing or whatever?
no, I don't think it's going to do anything
much like anything Steam does
it doesn't really help
Steam is such a
it's such a mess now
I think in some ways Steam is a victim of its own success
I don't really know how to eloquently
more put it than that
but I feel like Steam kind of needs to find its focus
Steam has kind of been trying to bite off
a lot
between the whole, they started to build streaming
remember how Steam has streaming in it?
and with the workshop
and the reviews
and the curators
there's so many elements to Steam
I really feel like Steam needs to have a whole
what are we
going to be first and foremost?
are we a store? or are we a social network?
I don't know
they're working on lots of different changes
but I don't know
it doesn't seem like a lot of it helps
but at the very least
the whole Campo Santo thing
that's kind of unfair I feel
the backlash with that
however the shadow of war
and the 2K18 stuff
sorry
maybe if you didn't do dickish things
people wouldn't act like dicks to you
so I don't feel bad for them
but it's fine
why doesn't Steam
and I realize Steam calls out
this is somebody who actually bought the game
or has a key or whatever
the only way the people who have actually bought the game
they really should
well because I guess you could
theoretically purchase it on our platform
or like another
non-Steam
platform or something
but who cares?
I know this is going to be controversial but tough titty
just only allow the people
that bought it on Steam
not even the promo keys
only the people who bought it on Steam spent money
get to write reviews that are weighted
let anybody write
a review for whatever
but only the ones who actually bought it on Steam
are weighted
and you know what?
what would be the problem with that?
oh no
people are going to review bomb my game
by buying the game over and over again
and leaving reviews
I'm saying don't let the codes either
and I fully realize
that this is going to screw Kickstarter stuff
because a lot of Kickstarter stuff
goes through
Kickstarter campaigns
but you know what?
as the old saying goes
you can't make an omelet without breaking eggs
like the Steam store
and the whole review system is kind of screwed up
and so
I think they just need to make some decisions that may not be popular
but I think we'll clean it up
a lot
this kind of shit happens on iOS and Android
and their review sites and everything
so it's like
grow up, you're a publisher
publishing a game
fucking grow up and deal with this shit
so what?
people don't like a decision you make
hmm, maybe take that to the bank and figure out
oh, maybe we shouldn't do that next time
how about that?
because even in the case of
the Firewatch devs
yeah, you know
you are well within your right to, I guess
copyright strike something
however, it's kind of
fucked up being that on your website
you say, oh, you can go ahead and use our stuff
and it's kind of silly to do that
for a video that he made
a long time ago, it wasn't like
he was playing that game and then he dropped the
N-bomb, it was a totally
different, it's just, it's such a weird
that video still generates revenue
and so, you know
they don't want to be associated with him, you know
I think people forget that a lot of these
game companies are doing a favor
I don't think they would think that they're
associated with him, so he played one of their games
big deal, you could just say
I think, you know, what he said was terrible
leave it at that, done
no one, you don't have to go
any further, you were just an angry person
using the system incorrectly
because it's not a copyright strike
you gave
express copyright to these people
so
I'm sorry, you
get upset, that's it
I want to move on, but respectfully
I disagree because, again, I think
a lot, I think this whole
streaming situation could be a lot worse
when it comes to the copyrights than it is
I think a lot, I mean, look at what Nintendo does
I think Nintendo's an example of, you know, kind of
doing a lot of the worst of it, and a lot
of game companies could be doing that, but they're not
because I think they do realize, for the most
part, there's a lot of great publicity that comes from
gaming, but at the same time
we have a real fucking
big problem in this industry
right now with the toxic culture in gaming
and that particular
streamer is an excellent
example of that problem
and so for a game company to put their foot
down and say, you know what, fuck this
we're not going to be associated with this toxic shit
no matter if it's
you know, dated or whatever
the semantics may be
I'm okay with them
having done that, because
I stream video games
I kind of think the game developers are
doing us a big favor by letting us get away
with it, and making the amount of money
we do off games, and if someday
they come down and say, you know what Rob, you're going to have to
share a bigger chunk of
your revenue with the game makers, I'll be
fine with it, I'm not going to throw a hissy fit
as long as it's
as long as it is transparent
and clear, and the rules
are known, and you know
if a competitor has different rules then they are
known, as long as everything is
you know, out there
then I'm fine with it
you know what though, even if they do that kind of stuff
there's plenty of other games out there, there's so many
indie developers that would love the exposure
yeah, too bad
you know, you want to be a dick about it, and you're a big publisher
we don't need a player game
you don't need the exposure, you've already basically stated that
alright, anyway, I want to move on
and try to get back to the topic
at hand, which was the Steam reviews
and let's see, I want to
so, what were they saying here in chat
over at live.vognetware.com
SG100Matt says, can't they in theory
buy the game, review it, and request a refund
isn't that something that they're doing?
well, if they refund it, pull the review
but I think if you're going to abuse
that, you know, if you're going to
abuse that system, then
they may
revoke your privileges and do that
sorry, MXC says, I don't
believe you can review a game if it's not in your Steam
library, at least I can't do it when trying to
review a random, non-owned game
so, but I think you can
can't you like, add it through another process
you can add it into your Steam library through another
process or something like that
yeah, I don't know if you can still leave reviews
for that
alright, anyhow, let's move on
in the interest of time, let's talk a little bit about
the drama that was going on this week between
Player Unknown Battlegrounds and
Fortnite, with the whole
battle royale mode, and
I'm sure a lot of you guys are reading the blogs, you've
probably heard about this a little bit, but Fortnite
obviously is in an early stage of release
going to be going to early access
and they said, you know, kind of this week
they were talking about how they're dropping
a battle royale mode in this
and I've actually seen people streaming this, this is
something you can already play basically
well, the folks that
were behind Player Unknown Battlegrounds
not happy about what Epic
did, saying quote, we've also
noticed that Epic Games references Player Unknown
Battlegrounds in the promotion of Fortnite
to their community and in communications with the
press, this was never discussed with us
and we don't feel it's right
and so on and so on, so this
kind of caused a conversation on Twitter
and some places about the whole like
what are these Fortnite, or excuse me
what are these Player Unknown Battlegrounds guys doing?
Like, they don't necessarily
own the entire genre
competition is a good thing, blah blah blah
this concept was around
before you, blah blah blah
It's not necessarily that they're saying that they're
stealing the battle royale idea
what their problem is, is that they
licensed the Unreal Engine from
Epic Games, and
Epic is basically
gonna be making
their version of this and they're
basically relying on Epic
for hardware
troubleshooting and that type of stuff
troubleshooting with their engine
and so they're, I think, worried that
I don't know, that basically they're
either gonna steal ideas or
they're gonna make improvements to the engine
and not let this company
in on those improvements, I don't know
it sounded like a whole bunch of worrying about nothing
to me, I mean, it sounded like
they're just whining because there's another company
trying to come in, but like, exactly
the thing, it's like, dude
Player Unknown Battlegrounds
H1Z1, King of the Kill
was like a thing way before that
Well, I do want to clarify, because part of what you're
pulling from there was a clarification
that came out, and I think it's important to say
there was a follow-up with
the dev team with Player Unknown Battlegrounds
that follows up this a little bit, that came out a couple days ago
there was an interview with PC Gamer
where they say, quote, the first thing, and this is
actually an interview with, what's the name
CH Kim, who
is
one of the
I think one of the developers of the game
oh no, there it is, executive producer, thank you
that's Blue Holes VP
as well, so CH Kim said, quote
the first thing I'd like to clarify is that
this is not about the battle royale mode itself
there were other BR game modes
earlier this year that were released, like Last Man Standing
or Grand Theft Auto 5's battle royale game mode
and we never raised an issue, and I think it's great
that there's more competition and everyone
should be able to create their own battle royale game mode
it's not about the idea itself, it's
about epic games, and that
wasn't really clear, so that was a very
interesting clarification, which yeah, leads into
this whole talk about the Unreal Engine
and some of these other points that you brought up, so
just to be clear, because I feel like social media
didn't capture that follow-up
as much as they did the original story
and even one of the things that
Brendan Greene was saying is, he said
other companies of course will come out and
enter the marketplace, I just hope that they put
their own spin on the game mode and not just
make a carbon copy, and honestly
I feel that
Fortnite has, because they have the whole
building aspect of it, you can
build a base, although
I gotta be honest, with this type of
gameplay, it's pretty fast paced
it seems like, I don't know if I'm gonna be just
hunkered down in a base I build and it's like
shit, the battlefield got smaller
I guess it's cool for like throwing up some
cover or something like that, but
you're not gonna get too intricate in building a base
and stuff. I watched somebody playing a stream of it
the Fortnite Battle Royale, and yeah, they were
in a house and they kept taking the roof
off the house to kind of see if they could see
where the snipers were or what have you, and
then they would kind of like, they'd take the roof off a different
part of the house, they were kind of like rebuilding the house as they were
moving, and then finally some guy came
up the stairs in the house and killed him
because the guy was too preoccupied with
trying to find the other people through the roof
so yeah, but it was kind of interesting
and I was like, well, what I just described
that whole taking off the roof, and again
I don't think you could do that.
Yeah, so there you go
that's how it's a little different. You know what's also
interesting, Loki, is I can't help but be reminded
of, you know, going back in time
the old discussion we used to have on the show
about DDR vs. In the Groove, right?
Remember that whole thing when In the Groove first
came out, and you know, in all
honesty, you know, when the game first came out
I wasn't a big fan of it, because I felt it was
very reductive with DDR.
Now, much like
people's feelings evolve on things
and having talked to Kyle over the years
and so forth, my views on In the Groove
evolved significantly, and I understand
why it was important
and how it filled the void that Konami was
making, basically, by themselves.
But anyway, I digress.
I feel that if they didn't have the building
stuff aspect of Fortnite
and it was just, okay, it's in this
art style now, but we're basically copying
the gameplay, then yeah, I could see
them taking issue with it more, because, okay,
this is, you're just basically carbon copying
this, you just changed the art style now.
But they have more
gameplay aspects to it, and
you know, it kind of goes back
to, like, even Street Fighter 2
and, like, the old fighting games.
People got pissed, or
companies got pissed off because, oh, now
there's Mortal Kombat, and now there's all these
other fighting games that are basically kind of
stealing, if you will,
the style of the game, but
they're all different, but yeah, they're all kind of
the same in certain ways as well.
Just like this, I mean,
there's always been last man standing
game types and everything, from, like, Call of Duty
to somebody brought up something on the
Intellivision, like Armor Battle,
so this is not a new thing, and like,
let's be honest, I mean, Battle Royale,
that whole concept, anyways, that's from a
fucking movie. You guys
all fucking copied that bullshit, so
stop fucking saying, oh, your idea is
fucking original. This is not an original
idea. It's a well-done implementation.
Exactly. So, you know what?
Like, Mortal Kombat, the,
MortalKombat.X
is a well-done fighting game. So, here's what
you do, because this is what companies do
when there's competition. You make the best
fucking product you can, and stop bitching
about it. Stop whining that
fucking competition's coming, and step
up your fucking game and make a better
game. That's how you fucking win this.
Alright, I want to get to chat. Bobby Blackwolf
in chat, trying to kind of explain this in
his style, says, the biggest worry is that
Epic, who makes Unreal Engine, from which
PUBG uses,
PUBG, should I just say PUBG? PUBG, yeah.
I do want to say PUG, like a little pug, but it's PUBG.
PUBG. PUBG. Can't I say PUGBEE?
Can't I get it backwards?
Alright. Who makes Unreal
Engine, which PUBG uses,
will start with holding updates they
make to the engine from PUBG in order to make
Fortnite better. They'll make an update to the
engine for Fortnite and not share it with PUBG.
Granted, they haven't even
spoken to Epic about this. They went
straight to the press. And certainly
there's an issue with that as well, is
taking your case to the court
of public opinion. Well, let's be honest
here. You're going to make updates to the
engine anyway, because I don't believe the engine supports
100 player multiplayer. That's probably
something that you added in there. That's not something
that's stock in there. So you're making
updates to the engine too. So
yeah, they may make updates to the engine for
their game, much like you're
doing the same thing, but it's not like
they're going to be releasing it letting everybody else
have that update and not your company.
That's stupid.
And so what? So what? They
make updates to the engine for their particular
game. Wah!
Make a better fucking game. I don't understand
what the problem is.
I think it's inevitable that, you know,
a consistently top three
games streamed on Twitch is
going to bring challengers that won a piece
of that pie, just like what
League of Legends now has
Heroes of the Storm, Smite,
you know, things that are very similar in nature, which are
all Defense of the Ancients. Yes, I know. But
you know, League of Legends is kind of the first one that
Twitch was really taking off there. You know, but
here's the fascinating thing.
All those games,
League of Legends, Heroes of the Storm, Smite,
they all do very well on Twitch and they all do very
well for themselves in different ways.
Despite the fact that at its core, they're all
lane defense games.
It's just, you just make
a better game. Just make the best game you
can and let the,
let everybody decide.
And learn from it. Just like
learn, don't whine about
it, because if you whine about it, it just
comes off as fucking weak.
People
are doing the same thing as we are.
Yeah, like anyone who wasn't going to copy your idea,
that's how it fucking works. But do you think people
like, now that you hear this clarification about
it wasn't about the Battle Royale,
it was about Epic.
Doesn't that make you kind of feel like, okay, maybe
people on Twitter were going to,
and so forth, were going too far with it?
Like with this whole thing, like, but at the
same time, if they went to the
press and not Epic Games
to begin with, then they kind of only
set themselves up for this misunderstanding.
You know, I get it that they are worried that
they're going to make updates to the engine, but you know what?
If they don't release an update, you
can speculate whatever updates
that they're making on their side.
You can speculate all day long,
but I mean, eventually
they're going to release updates to it if it's
going to be beneficial for everybody using
that product because they want to sell the product.
But,
to think that
they're just going to purposely hold back
updates so that your game fails
is stupid.
You know what? You've done well enough by
yourself before that
they've released all this stuff. I don't understand
what the problem is.
Alright, going to Stoppy in our chat over at
live.hognetwork.com says, I think Sky's on to something.
Player Unknown's ground battles
make more sense. There's no combat
at sea or in air. See? Pugby.
It's not a puppy, it's a
pugby. Anyway.
You know what? I'll say this at the end of the day.
I remain interested
in both those games right now.
You know, I've watched a little bit of both on Twitch,
and I'm kind of interested in both of them.
So, I mean, when?
Question mark?
Alright, anyway.
Let's move on to another story for now.
Loki. So,
unfortunately there are some now
apps that aren't working with iOS
11. One of those apps
being the very popular, time-wasting
game Flappy Bird.
So, if you
update to iOS
11, it's not going to work because it's a 32-bit
app and not a 64-bit
app. And no plans from the
creator who walked away from that
game so long ago
to update it. That's too bad. I mean,
if only there were some
more Flappy Bird clones on
the iOS storefront. I mean,
it's too bad that no one's ever made one.
So, jeez. You know what? You could really
corner the market on this. It's too bad there
wasn't one right at vognetwork.com.
It's like the whole pub.
Which did you hear apparently no longer
works in most browsers. Oh, darn.
Bobby got into it on his show tonight.
I'll let you go listen to that. It's like
the whole PUBG situation. Man,
that sucks that they're the only game
out there and only will be the only game
ever. But yeah,
that's unfortunate.
I guess Android wins in this case. Well,
you know, guys, I think I found the trick
because right now,
right now, in the studio
on my phone,
I'm playing Flappy Bird
right now on my phone. That's right.
Oops, I died. On my
iOS phone, I'm playing.
You know how I did it? I didn't
upgrade to iOS 11 and I can still
play Flappy Bird. So,
if you want to still play that stuff, nobody's really
forcing you to upgrade. Now, look. Here's
the other thing. It's not really
just about Flappy Bird. Although,
I'm a little sad he's gonna update it, but you're right.
There's tons of clones and games out there that
have taken this formula and improved
on it. It was planned obsolescence. It's Apple
conspiring against Flappy Bird
because they're gonna release their own
Flappy Bird and it's gonna complete the
marketplace and they're gonna
Flapple. Flapple Bird.
It's not a
bird anymore. It's a community.
It's a meeting hub. A coffee
shop, if you will. Not so much
of a bird. It's you, actually.
It's you. It's your soul.
Yes.
Flapple.
It flaps the soul.
Perfect.
Anyway.
But no, the real reason is
the iOS updates are notorious
for always being buggy
when they first come out. Like, they drain your battery
or something happens. So, I'm sorry. I've learned
I didn't upgrade right away.
And some people will say, you're an idiot, Rob. Well,
okay. Cool.
But my phone still works and I'm playing
Flappy Bird and you're not.
But, also, just case
and point, obviously I'm a big Pokemon Go
player. I mentioned that earlier in the show with
what I was playing today. There's, of course,
a huge bug with the Plus, the Bluetooth
thing, where there's like a three second
delay for people that are on iOS 11 where
it doesn't work right. So, I'm like,
you know what? For that reason alone,
with as much Pokemon Go as I play,
I'm not exactly in a hurry to upgrade
to the newest iOS on my
three-year-old device, the iPhone 6
Plus. So, anyway.
Well, how will you swipe up
to do shit?
You just won't be able to.
Oh, no. It won't be as intuitive.
I won't be able to record my screen
because I'm sure that's fucking smooth
on the
6 Plus. It probably works great
on the iPhone 8 and the iPhone 10
and all this, but it's just not, you know,
and as I said before, look, as much as
I'm giving this a little crap here,
I fully plan to buy the iPhone 10.
I'm three years due for an upgrade
now. I'm gonna get that iPhone 10
and that fancy new screen, but
I'll just wait till then
for iOS 11. I don't need it now.
How good Flappy Bird
could look on that screen?
Sadly, the potential will never be realized.
Well, maybe what I'll probably do is that I'll
upgrade, you know, I'll get the iPhone 10 and then
what happens to my iPhone 6 Plus? It's basically
an iPad or an iPod
Touch at that point, right? There's no cell service
on it anymore. It's Wi-Fi. But I will forever
have this device to play
Flappy Bird on. This phone in my hand
will be in a fucking museum someday
because I didn't upgrade it to iOS 11.
Marked my words.
He stood up to Apple and said,
fuck you, I'm not updating.
I will not go to
11. Come on, NoelGus
in chat talking about my problems with
Pokemon Go and iOS
11 says that's Niantic, though.
Well, yeah, it is, but it's also just a
problem of what happens
with new OSes. They kind of
break some things that developers
would want to do. YYR in chat
says none of this should come as a surprise
for months now. Opening such apps on iOS
10 would display a warning. That is true
and you can still go in
and see
you can actually go into
I think it was, what is it? I'm looking at my phone right now.
You go into settings and I think it's like
what is it? General
and
I don't remember what it is
from here. Somebody in chat will probably yell it out.
Is it software update? No, because I don't
want to update. Oh shit, I don't want to update.
Accessibility, maybe?
I don't remember what it is, but there's something you go into
and it actually shows you what
apps on your phone are not
going to upgrade. And what's interesting is that
ReRave, another music
game, is one of them that will not
upgrade, but
they put out ReRave Plus some time ago
so the old ReRave is kind of
done anyway. It's all about ReRave Plus at this
point, but I remember that was like the other big one
that showed up on the list.
Alright.
ActDeftInChat speculates
that phones without iOS 11 will be
valuable like PlayStation 4 with
PT. Ooh.
Good point, good point. Alright.
Didn't they try that though?
Like people were selling their phones with
Flappy Bird when it got removed. I think
it was working for some people too.
It's kind of crazy what people will buy.
Anyway, speaking of
things that only crazy people will buy,
the original Xbox
controller is coming back. The X-Brick
controller, that gigantic
did you ever have the original Xbox
with that gigantic freaking
controller? Check
it out. Look at a YouTube or something if you've never seen
it, but there was a gigantic controller for this
and it seems like it might be coming
back, sort of. The nickname for this
controller, the Duke, apparently
one of the original designers has actually
been trying to put the Duke back on
Xbox One and Windows 10.
Microsoft just gave it
the green light from Xbox designer
Sheamus Blackley.
They had the Duke on the 360.
Well now it's coming back for the Xbox One.
And an appropriate time too because
we know that original original Xbox
games are going to be playable on Xbox One
like Crimson Skies, right? So what
better time for this controller to come back. However
I do want to state out this will not be a Microsoft
product. This will be a peripheral
from Hyperkin who puts out
a lot of that stuff. Apparently they're now doing
that center thing that was like a jewel
thing with the Xbox logo. It's not going to be an
OLED screen. So that might be kind of neat.
Maybe they'll do some different stuff with that.
I mean not that there's any like really
official second screen support within the
Xbox because
what the hell? I don't even remember
the name of it. That app that
they had? Is that dead? It's clearly dead.
I don't even remember the fucking name of it.
Screenplay? Screen?
Oh my god.
I can't even remember. That's how dead that thing is.
But obviously it won't be supported
within the controller. But smart glass.
Thank you ActDeft. Winner winner
Smart glass dinner.
There it is.
Speaking of dead things.
Microsoft wants to
sell you a camera.
They're testing USB
camera support for
streaming use on the Xbox One.
Because after all there's been
no cameras released for the Xbox
One. Ever. Ever.
I mean Kinect but will
not. But Kinect got shoved in a
closet and locked. Let's forget
that even happened. We'll never be heard from again.
But yes they're gonna support that so you can
do like facecam and stuff like that on
you know your game
stream. Oh so that thing that we hoped
the Xbox One would do when they first
removed Kinect a couple years ago.
Right? They're finally gonna
maybe do. I saw Kinect for the Xbox 360
for 8 bucks at Goodwill the other day.
Wow really? I almost bought it.
Oh wait for the 360 not for the one.
Oh ok I was like if that was for Xbox One
I might have actually went and bought it for Xbox One.
8 bucks?
I could do without pumpkin spice
fraps for a couple days to do that.
Yeah I don't think it was the Xbox One. Oh bummer.
Bummer bummer. Not bad though.
YYR in chat says
Kinect may never be heard from again
but it will keep listening.
I think that was some people's concerns
with that device actually.
Alright. And
come on Noel Gus pointing out that Apple bought
the sensor company that made Kinect.
Hmm. Maybe
Apple Kinect.
Anyway moving on
to another story. This makes me
like really sad actually and that is
news that the Chinese
Room which is a studio
in Britain that makes video
games such as probably their most
well known games are Everybody's Gone to the
Rapture and Dear Esther
have laid off their staff
and they are going dark for a few months.
The co-founder of the Chinese
Room Dan Pinchbeck made
a big blog post that talks about what's going on
saying that this is a temporary closure
it is something that's been in the works since earlier
in the year. The decision has to do with
financial pressures following a
health scare. Yikes.
And so they're pausing things to recharge.
He put quote to cut a long
story short the situation between
financial pressures trying to keep the lights
on for the employed team the stress
of end of development health issues
just wasn't a tenable thing anymore.
It was time to take a break recharge recover
and have a good think about the
future. Chinese Room still
has two games in the works The 13th
Interior and Little Orpheus
it was assured in
the blog post that these titles are still going to
release as planned. He will interact
with the community through social media but the studio
is no longer in full active
development. The studio did assist
employees in trying to secure positions
elsewhere since I guess they'd known
for some time.
Trying to end on a happy note
Is it the end of the Chinese room? No
I don't think so but it's the end of a chapter
and we hope you all can be patient with us whilst
we figure out what happens next. And that makes
me sad because I thought everybody's gone
to the rapture was a brilliant game
and I understand not everybody's into the
walking simulators which you know
but I also think the internet has
kind of like a lot of mob
mentality online has really
given the walking simulator type
stuff like like it's just it's a well
done story at the end of the day
everybody's gone to the rapture is a really good story at the end
of the day and it's you know you can draw your own
conclusions from it you can either get
a lot of exposition or very little depending
on how you know thorough you are with the exploring
and so forth I think the soundtrack
is one of the most gorgeous soundtracks in a
video game so
there's an awful lot I really like about the game
so I think it sucks that you know the internet kind of
shits on this genre sometimes
when there's you know brilliant art
that comes out of it like this game and
you know I really hope that
backlash or whatever you want to call it I really hope
that didn't play into
what's happening to the studio now
it sounds like there may be some other issues
such as the health issues and so forth that are a lot more
scarier you know that are that are much bigger
than a video game and so forth so I get it from that
standpoint but hopefully
the upcoming releases the 13th
interior a little Orpheus
hopefully they're good you know
you know I'm not gonna be so
nice if the games aren't good but I if
the games are good which you know I enjoyed their other
games so I would hope I'd like these games to if
the games are good I hope it brings them the success
that they deserve to be able to do more
games in the future although it's gonna be weird if
they can't really have the same development team you know
so or maybe they'll be able to come back I don't know
so anyhow
little sad about that and the fact that
that developer is
kind of going through a big change right
now all right before we get to the classic
game of the week which I will be doing tonight in
Dark Sakura's Absence we have one more story from
Loki yes and this is kind of hopefully
the end of a
long stretch of stories we've been talking about
so going back to last
week we were mentioning that you know
first there was an NES emulator
that was found randomly within
the firmware of the
or yeah the
firmware of the NES
Switch or the Switch and
they also had the NES game Golf
in there as well that was part of the Switch
and everyone's just wondering what the hell is this
why why is this in here
is this like something that's going to be coming out
you know are they going to have this
release or something well apparently
there is a little bit more to the
story so they figured it out
they figured it out yeah so
and almost by accident
someone had somehow launched
Golf actually without any sort
of hacks and launched the game and they're
like wait how did you do that
you know no one believed them at first
and then they found all this stuff
so what happened was apparently
on July 11th
which is the
anniversary of
Awana's death
if on July 11th
if you make the
the little motion
the direct to you motion
the open hands
kind of going forward yeah if you
make that motion with the
Switch controllers
it'll launch the game
and it's only on July 11th
and it actually has to be on July 11th
if it's connected to the internet because it does check
you know the time against the internet
someone has managed to capture
this on video because he had a
Switch that wasn't connected to the internet
yet and so he set the date to
July 11th did the gesture
and sure enough it booted up
Golf that's awesome that's a really
neat truth you know some people were kind of weirded
out though by the fact that they did his date of death
as a tribute and not
like his birthday or you know
celebrating a type of other notable release
or just any time but
you know I think that's also maybe like a culture
thing as well like you know maybe it's a little
weird in our culture but in other
cultures sometimes
that's how you celebrate or
I think it was I was reading something about it like
it's almost like a good luck thing like
if you have that inspiration that's in your
console that it's actually or you know whatever it is
you develop that's actually like a good luck thing
but like you know in some cultures what we have like
we have holidays to celebrate dead people
like that's you know that's what happens so it's
it's interesting I wonder
if this would have ever been found
well I get I mean I get
this was the way it was supposed to happen I suppose
some guy randomly accidentally
gets it on July 11th and posts to a
message board nobody believes him
but then finally somebody digs in the OS and
finds no this guy there's something to it right
so I guess next
year on July 11th a lot of people are going to be
playing golf yeah
Dartetsuya in chat says I learned in Japan they
called it a Oma Mori a good luck
charm yeah Dartetsuya
says that's the term they were throwing around over on
Japanese Twitter so there it is and of course
golf Iwata had made
golf just like he made yeah
I guess no there's a lot of people
that refuse to work on that game because they couldn't
fit it within the cartridge size but
somehow he managed to get the code to fit
alright well that's that is
that is awesome so I don't have a
clever follow up for that leading into our
classic game of the week so let's just get to our
classic game of the week
now every week
Dark Soccer dives into the video game vault and finds
a game that she thinks hey you little brats
you should be playing this game this week
but she's not here
so I'm taking over tonight because I thought
it would be good tonight to do a timely
submission perhaps a little bit for the classic
game of the week and I don't even know if Loki's
ever played this but we'll find out so the classic
game of the week nope sorry guys not Halo
classic game of the week is something a little timely
this week there's a very specific reason
why I picked this today
so the classic game of the week let's see if we can get
some of the voice synthesizer
in here to play
that's right
it is Star Trek
the 1982
release from Sega in
the arcades this is the Star Trek
strategic operations
simulator and it was
an arcade release in 1982 from
Sega but it was ported to a variety
of systems I know I had played
it on the Commodore 64 when I was
younger and it was also
on I think it was on the
Apple as well
it was on the Vectrex
I think it was on Atari 2600 as well
no I don't think it was on the Vectrex it was on the ColecoVision I know
that what's interesting about this game
it looks like
Star Wars which was around
the same time but Star Wars was
Atari if I remember right
these just both happen to be vector based games
but the interesting thing that made
Star Trek a little bit different is that in
the Star Trek arcade game you actually
had like a split screen thing
going on you had a map in the upper right
you had in the upper left like a
bar that showed how many photon torpedoes
you had and how many like laser beams and all that stuff
you had and then you had your actual
like view play was on the bottom
and so remember this was 1982
in the arcades this is a little bit unheard
of at the time to basically have like
second screen type of stuff that was built
into the game or actually tertiary screens
in this case
so that's kind of what made this game unique
I don't think that this game was ever as popular
as Star Wars was
which was around
the same year or the year later but
I think it was pretty cool just how like involved
this game was so
what you did in this game you got multiple views
of the play field and of course
you have to use and manage your shield energy
and photon torpedoes and warp energy
you can replenish these by docking with
star bases but the Klingons
aren't only attacking you
they're actually attacking the
star base as well so you have to be careful
and you can actually kill your star base by friendly
fire so you have to be careful
this game was actually controlled with a weighted
spinner so it wasn't really like a joystick
you actually had a little spinner and that's how you use the ship
heading control and then you have buttons
to do the impulse engines, warp engines
phasers and photon
torpedoes the warp button
was set a little bit away from the other
buttons that way you had
to actually like you intentionally
go and hit it and you wouldn't be hitting it on accident
especially if you're in the moment
you want to make sure you don't accidentally hit that
so there you go and then
this was translated on a variety of
different systems an early
review in the magazine Electronic Games
said that this is sure to be a top
grocer in the arcades this year if you can
squeeze through the crowd around the machine you may
never want to leave I
don't I mean again I can
only go back by my old memory
but I don't think this game
ended up being as popular in
the arcades at the time but I remember
it was a game it seemed like a lot of people did have
on like home consoles and stuff like
obviously we added on Commodore 64
it was on Atari 2600, Apple II
you know kind of those early
YYR
and Chad is like freaking out going
holy shit I played a Commodore 64 version of this
and didn't remember it at all until
just now see there you go classic
game of the week awakening memories
deep inside you even some you may not
want since 2002
the
designer of this game Sam
Palihannuk I hope I said that
right who did this for Sega
which ended up developing and publishing the game
and
there you go I don't know what else to say about it
but obviously I have picked this game
tonight because of the fact that
I know many people are probably not
listening to OLR tonight because they're watching
the Star Trek Discovery which is the new
TV series is airing tonight
which is a little bit controversial
because I know it's going on the CBS all
access thing and people are like I don't
really want to pay for another
$10 a month thing
but you know despite that controversy
I do think it's great that Star Trek
you'll just have to do what Game of Thrones fans do
and pirate it probably pirate the shit out of it
but anyway I just think it's great that Star Trek
is coming back to television and of course
I'm going to leave the rest of that discussion to our
friends at the Starboard Power Coupling
podcast we played their commercial last week
and they are very excited to be back this week
with their discussion on the first
maybe first two episodes actually because I believe
not you get the first episode on TV
but then on CBS all access the first two episodes
are going to be there so I think they may discuss both
this week on Starboard Power Coupling
so look forward to
that. Anyway there it is
your classic game of the week Star Trek the arcade game
from 1982 a strategical
operations simulator and I'm being very specific
because there's been like 50 Star Trek games
so that's the one specifically I'm
calling out.
To register participation for
this week's episode of Orange Island Radio at
vognetwork.com use the pass phrase
Sprout.
Bobby Blackwolf in chat saying the Orville
greater than Discovery
you know what I haven't seen either one
and I don't think you've seen Discovery
yet so I think it's a little early to say that
but I do think it's
interesting that the Orville
the reason why people seem to
like it is that it has a lot
of the essence of what people really like about
Star Trek I mean granted it's in a separate universe
or what have you but it's interesting
because it is on Fox which is over the
air and it's kind of doing something that Star Trek
Discovery isn't and I just I really
hope that decision by CBS doesn't
like fuck Star Trek
forever because of this decision
so I'm kind
of hoping because I don't know if you know this
but in every other country but the
US maybe Canada as well
I can't remember what the deal is in Canada but
I think every other country besides those two
Netflix is going to have the Star Trek show
so in every other country you'll be able to watch it
on Netflix and
so yeah you don't have to worry about getting a separate
service because it'll be on the one that most people have
so I wonder if this show isn't going to do
very very very well in other countries
but I guess CBS
already made a good like they spent like eight
million dollars on this show well six
million of it came from the Netflix deal so
yeah right anyway
alright
oh yeah that's right and somebody did explain this
to me Bob Blackwell says it airs on cable
TV in Canada so they have like
a cable TV channel up there I think
one of my buddies up there I think was even telling me about this
and I just forgot because I don't have a good memory
alright
and Kaijuto in chat points out I use
CBS access for Big Brother it's cool
you can watch a lot of crap on it and admittedly
yeah I got CBS all
access for Big Brother as well and
do you know how lit that celebrity version
of Big Brother is going to be I mean it's
it's Olympics counter programming so it's going to be on
the same time when a lot of people are distracted
by the Olympics but instead of
just trying to air these shows that nobody's going to
watch because the Olympics are on CBS is going to try to
do you know celebrity Big Brother which stands
but that's going to be on it'll
be on TV but the live feeds will be on
CBS all access and that's going to be nuts
because that's celebrities
you know in the big well I say
celebrities but it's going to be celebrities
if rumors are to be believed
Tiffany Pollard
or New York who's one of my faves
I think she'll do fantastic
Lance Bass
Dog the Bounty Hunter
some gal from Mob Wives but again
these are rumors and who knows what's
going to change before this is really on TV
so it'll be interesting but
I mean maybe if celebrity Big Brother
brings people to CBS all access then
people will be like oh shit this is the Star Trek thing too
I guess I should watch this but I feel like
most of the Star Trek fans will have just pirated
it before that that's just the reality
I don't know we'll see
anyhow we're going to
take a break you guys when we come back we have plenty
more Orange Lounge Radio to come including
rapid fire news as well as
your emails at participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
and your phone calls we will have
Skype tonight at Orange Lounge Radio and more
gaming news so we will take a break
we'll be right back after this break with more of
Orange Lounge Radio
Welcome back everybody
to Orange Lounge Radio
live tonight episode number
701 in progress for this
September the 24th of 2017
myself and Loki with you here tonight
Dark Soccer is out sick
but I hope she feels better a lot soon
although I notice over
where Dark Soccer usually sits
during the show I notice my husband Alan
has his ASMR
stuff all set up do you know what this is
Loki the ASMR have you heard of this?
this is something I've just been learning more about
recently is it's this whole okay so I guess
like there's this um you can find these YouTube
videos out there and it's um you know
it's people that are talking they're talking
very softly into a
microphone and uh
what the way they talk the way they talk
it's supposed to like make chills go
down your spine and like
but they'll do things like it's not just the talking but then it's like
they'll like rub things they'll
rub the microphone it's like this I guess
supposed to be like and people say it's like a massage
for the brain I know I understand I know the
feeling but like I don't know
well the first video I ever saw was this lady who
eats a pickle really slowly and
like you know she's
and this is like the noise of the pickle
is like but like see some people that would
drive them nuts that noise
because like you know some people don't like to hear other
people eat like I have a friend who really hates that
but um you know I just I can't help
but you know think of that but anyway so
so Alan has likes to
watch these videos and I guess I guess
some people feel it and some people don't so
Alan's kind of one of the people that feels it and
but now he makes he likes to
make the uh slime stuff he sees
in some of the videos cause that's
I guess gives him that texture type feedback
so if you ever wondered what
happens to Jamie's spot during the week when
she's not here it turns into
I keep calling it ass master
cause ASMR turns into
it's ass mister it's ass mister
I like that better it's cause cause people
are gonna get a different impression if I say Jamie's
share turns into ass master when she's not here
but no it's it's ASMR headquarters
uh ass mister so there it is
so uh going to our chat over
at live dot vog network
dot com uh active to chat says
it's ASMOLR do you know how much
money those YouTubes make
like if you do like that
that lady who makes the pickles that
that video probably has millions of hits
like she could probably fucking retire
off eating pickles on YouTube like it's crazy
it's people that play toys yeah
play with toys and film it
and my son watches the shit out of that crap
it's so like oh my gosh it's so
and it's a never ending cycle
too cause you get your kid to play
with toys and then the companies pay
you know that
or pay you for that and then they also send you free
toys to promote it never ends
I need to do that Legos
I need to do it seriously Legos
have been like crack I am a fucking crack
addict when it comes to that shit
that might be a fun thing to stream is Lego
building like stream it on Twitch and then archive
it on YouTube they do that
sometimes they'll do speed builds and stuff
but like yeah but it's not me I'm funny
I mean it
takes a long time though like the last I put together
took 12 hours wow
cause it was a big set uh let's see
Bobby Blackwolf points out there was a guys on
a show episode about people chewing one
now you know which one of my friends I was referring to a moment ago
alright anyhow people
chewing I don't remember guys on a show episode
about chewing I don't remember I don't remember
I think it was I think it was like the discussion
at the top of the show I don't think that was the main topic
of the show but I think it came up at some point
during the show anyway I missed that show
I do really want to bring it back you guys but you know
Xverse has just been really busy as have I
so I don't want to go
too far down this road but I did mention
at Dragon Con I was you know finding a lot of inspiration
and it's part of the reason why I
want to get more motivated to do this segment
for you know Pogo Podcast I'm doing
but I am
considering adding another podcast to the
platter I'm in that mode now
where I think I have an idea in my
head and the little hamster
gears are turning so we'll see
anyway alright
let's move on
we're going to get into
some more news rapid fire news
in fact starting with Loki
so here's a mobile game we haven't heard of in a while
but Super Mario Run
is getting an update that's right
they're adding a whole new world
don't you dare close
your eyes a whole new world
I see no right as I said that I was like oh my god
he's going to do that and sure
enough not disappointed whatsoever
have I
become predictable after 700 episodes
of this show?
no I'm just using my
wife doing that kind of crap
so the new one is going to be
they said it's going to
have like a remix 10
is what it's called so
it's
basically bite sized sections
of the game's current levels with new bonus
medals so they have repeatable
challenges and they're also adding a new playable
character Princess Daisy will become
a playable character as well
and so also with that you're going to be able to
play your own music in the background
instead of the game music
and when you do
that your characters will
they'll wear headphones so they have a picture
of Mario with headphones on
headphone Mario
beats by Bowser
I like that beats by Bowser
and then of course if you haven't jumped into the game yet
they're going to be marking it on sale
September 29th it's going to be half price
so $5 instead of $10
so check it out
alright and then
with the prevalence
of Wii U emulators
there is
a whole ton of shit
that they've been doing with the whole
Wii emulation or Wii U emulation scene
and of course one of the games that's
gotten a lot of focus is
the whole Breath
of the Wild so
Breath of the Wild runs fantastic in emulators
in fact they've gotten it to run 4K and all sorts
of things and now modding has
become a part of that so
all sorts of mods in there there's a few new character
mods including putting
CJ or Carl Johnson from
Grand Theft Auto San Andreas
in the game or Steve from Minecraft
and they have
a picture with Link wearing Cappy
and a mustache
as well do they have the mod like
they have in Skyrim for like maybe
when the red moon happens it's Macho Man
starts playing no
they don't have that yet but I mean it's
it's interesting and then the moon turns into
Randy Macho Man Savage oh yeah
see all these different mods for the game
I want to see some for Mario Kart
I wonder if they've got some for that but
yeah I haven't played
on my emulator in a while
but it runs really well in my system
so I need to maybe go back
and check that out again
I'm having a laugh at this conversation in chat
YYR in chat says is Headphone Mario wearing
anything besides the headphones
and Corky follows that up with yes
his mustache
alright moving on to some other rapid fire
stories for the week you know I
didn't miss this one you guys from Tokyo Game
Show it's not specifically about
Sony but I'm very excited to
hear about Kunio-kun the world
classics collection it's going to come out on
PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch
and PC it's 11
Kunio-kun classics
and if you don't know what Kunio-kun is
well then let me tell you about the four
western games also
included as bonus titles that weren't released
in Japan that are part of this collection
and you'll know real quick what Kunio-kun
is Renegade
Super Dodgeball
River City Ransom and Crash and the
Boy Street Challenge that's right it's the
little characters from River City Ransom and Super Dodgeball
so of course they've had some more games
that have been released over in Japan there's
like several dodgeball games there's a hockey
game a soccer game so anyhow all
the games in the Kunio-kun collection will have support
for online play as you clear
missions in the title you can customize your avatar
and your game screen and
additional replayability elements as well so
that's really exciting especially I'm very excited to hear it's
coming out on Switch because
then that's something that you can take with you on the go
as well and you know these are
older games anyway so it's not like you're gonna
need the biggest technology to play them
so that's very very cool
what else could be cool
speaking of the Nintendo Switch
apparently a Netflix customer
service rep so take it
with a grain of salt cause it's not like it's you know
a director of you know
publicity or something a Netflix
customer service rep told Go Nintendo
or a user at that site anyway
that Netflix is locked
and loaded for the Nintendo Switch
Netflix been trying to get permission
from Nintendo to launch the app on the
console but no results yet
once Nintendo approves it
the Netflix Nintendo Switch app will launch
and be added to the eShop I honestly
but no surprise here I think the only
surprise out of this is that somebody
at Netflix is saying something about it
but you guys customer
service sometimes is outsourced
to other companies so
with all due respect this
person may have no
additional information that you or I have
usually the customer service
reps the thing is that those positions you know
phones they tend to be very high attrition
so people come and go basically you know
so you don't always give them the secrets
because they're the folks that tend to leave
and go somewhere else you know what I mean
so they usually find things out
the day everybody else finds them out so
it's a little weird to me that they
would know about this but you know
they might know a guy in another department
or something you know but regardless
it was probably inappropriate of them to say
something about this on the outside
but at the same time
is this really shocking news
that Netflix is probably
not the holdout about
Netflix being on the Switch
does that surprise you Loki to hear that
Netflix is not the problem with
Netflix on the Switch is not Netflix
does that surprise you
yeah it does? no
oh okay I was like
surely you're being sarcastic
of course I am Loki don't fuck with me tonight
I'm not in a good mood alright just kidding
uh yeah
says I'm sure Netflix
on Switch is inevitable
says I think it would be more shocking
if Netflix didn't have an app
ready I'm just curious again
I know I've said this a thousand times but I'm
very curious about the whole fact like will you
really be able to pick it up and take it on the
go with you I mean in the house certainly
it would still work off wifi but
I mean like something like Riverdale
which you can download to your device
can I pick that up and leave the house
and watch it because maybe it's buffered
in the background like at a certain point
the Switch will tell me like boom
the episode's completely downloaded and I can pick it up
and take it with me on public
transit wherever I want to go
oh no we'll see
sounds like it's up to Nintendo to tell
us that you can download it to the Switch's
massive 32 gigabytes of storage
well believe it or not those movies
are not very big there may be
less than a gigabyte so
you know you could download a couple things
you can't download a lot but you get to have one or two things
at a time that's not crazy so
anyhow let's go
and travel around the world and check out some
video games coming out in other countries
like the US to start Loki
yes and so this is probably a game that
Jamie is playing Danganronpa
V3 oh that's why she's not here
tonight Danganronpa
PlayStation 4 Vita and PC
DWVR on
PlayStation Vita
Fallout 4 Game of the Year edition
on PC, PlayStation 4 and
Xbox One
Hob on PC and PlayStation 4
Light Field
on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One
Light Tracer on
PlayStation 4
this one's kind of a cool looking game
Megaton Rainfall which is on PlayStation 4
PSVR it's a like
first person superhero game
in VR so that looks kind of cool
Pinball FX
number 3 and that's going to be coming out on
PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One
Raid World War 2
on PC
Ruiner on PC, PlayStation 4
and Xbox One
Senran Kangura
Peach Beach Splash on PlayStation 4
that's a pretty nice
title
Sina Mora EX on the Switch
Scene World Dig 2 on
PlayStation 4 and the Vita
Outcast Second Contact
on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One
The Legend of Heroes
Trails of Cold Steel 3
on PlayStation 4
Total War Warhammer 2
on PC
Cuphead on PC and Xbox One
FIFA 18 on
PC, the Switch, PlayStation 3
PlayStation 4, Xbox 360 and
Xbox One
Gundam Versus on PlayStation 4
This isn't really counted as a release but because
you know the whole Super NES
Classic Edition is coming out on Friday
they also mention Star Fox 2
which I guess technically is being released
but that's kind of a stretch
That is a little bit of a stretch but I guess
I did want to mention though, since you're a fan
Cults of
Revolt is coming out the following week
on 3DS
I am excited about that
I know they were promoting that a little bit on
it has its own little
3DS collectible puzzle piece
thing and all that
too, so that's pretty exciting
Alright, let's travel to Japan and check out
what is going to be coming out in Japan
and let's see, looking at
the list for
September the 28th
we have coming out Fire Emblem Musou
is out in Japan, I believe that is on
PlayStation 4
I'm sorry, that is a new
Nintendo 3DS game, sorry my list
this week doesn't have it separated by
what platform they're on
so it's a little more challenging for me
so that is on the new 3DS this week
also coming out this week we have
NAC 2, gets its Japanese release on the
28th, there's also
Fire Emblem Musou in a premium box
so that is something to look forward to as well
which is on the Switch as well as the 3DS
they have a game called
Nora Princess and Stray Cat
comes out this week
and that is on the PlayStation Vita
looks like it might be based off an anime
and then also in Japan
Fallout 4 gets a new game of the year edition
so it's like a price reduction
so that is coming out as well
that's basically the game and DLC
they're releasing over here too
that whole thing is out in Japan as well
and then of course FIFA 18 will be a big release
and that is out on the PlayStation 4 this week
let's take a trip over to the UK
Loki
Alright, so we have Evalkyrie Warzone
on PC and PlayStation 4
Lightfield on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One
Ruiner on PC, Xbox One, PlayStation 4
on the Switch
we have the original Mario Brothers
also a game
on PC called
Twickles
I guess
Picross S on the Switch and
Blue Reflection on PC
Alright, let's go to the mailbag
because you guys
sometimes you send us emails
and all the time
we like to read them
You can send us an email
by emailing us at participate at
orangeloungeradio.com
Usually DarkSakura is here to read your emails
but since she's under the weather tonight
I will be filling in those duties in her place
Let's start with an email from Martin
the Belgian who emails us this week
Dearest OLR, congratulations
on reaching 700 episodes
It is an epic milestone and not
many podcasts will ever reach that many episodes
It is a testament to how committed
you guys are and it is great to see
you have built a real sense of community
for so many listeners every Sunday night
Like gathering with a group of friends
around a campfire and sharing stories
Perfect. I have been listening to
this show for probably close to 10 years
at this point and it has definitely become a part
of my Monday mornings as I wake up at work
and listen to the podcast. Thank you for always
being there to provide some Monday morning
entertainment. Rob, it was great meeting you
in person at DragonCon. Having listened
to you guys for so long I was definitely a little
nervous and starstruck
meeting you and Bobby in person
Sorry if I was a bit awkward. Next year we
should go and have some shots of Stroopwafel
together. Keep up the great show
as always. Hugs, Martin the Belgian
You didn't strike me as nervous or
awkward at all. So
I'm actually only regretful
I didn't get to spend more time
with people but they were kind of
for logistical reasons I don't fault
them for it at all. They kind of had to shoo us off the stage
to prep the next panel
Right? So
What we really need to do I think one of the best things
we ever did was remember the year
we went to PAX in Seattle
That was 2008. That was the year I was really sick
So we went to PAX in Seattle and we were with
All Games then
Wasn't the All Games broadcast
going the whole time? I think
Bobby was doing them. Yeah they had this whole
side table thing that was in the hallway
And other shows that were on the network at the time
were coming and going. So that was the whole thing we were doing that year
And the reason why I bring it up is that
one thing I remember we did is we did like a dinner
Somewhere one night where we actually
Yeah I remember that. Yeah it sounded like
an Asian restaurant. Yeah and we got
to meet a bunch of listeners and it was like
hey we're going to go to this dinner place
Of course then when the check came out it was a nightmare
to split but
maybe we could find a counter diner place or something
we could find a place to go eat at
together and say we're going to have the
vog dinner at XYZ time
during Dragon Con. I think that would be really cool
except for the fact that Dragon Con is so fucking crowded
to do something like that you probably
have to go like a ways away from
the main center venue. But I don't know
you know my fifth year at Dragon
Con I'm learning more tricks about where
to eat and that if you walk a certain
direction just like two blocks away
you're going to find restaurants with no weight
whatsoever because like everybody is
in that fucking peach tree center or
you know wherever so
yeah so anyway I bring that up because
I think it would be really cool to maybe do something like that
in a future year like
next year because we already have
vog suite booked for 2018
so we're coming back
next year and hopefully we'll still get to be a part
of the podcast track and that will be
awesome and you know I say to
people that meet us for the first time like
realistically like first
off there's no need to be starstruck we're gaming
fans just like you guys we just started this show
so long ago but I'm very honored that
people like get excited you know
since I also kind of get it like you've been
listening to us but you've never met us for maybe
10 years that's a very long time so
like I get it but you know trust me
we're not we
don't pay our bills with anything we
make from this show so until we're at that level
I don't think we're really that famous so
we're probably just as starstruck to meet you
as you are to meet us for what it's
worth but yeah my coworker the other day I like
told him about how we had 700 episodes like
so you guys making money off of that I'm like
no why not
you should other podcasts do look at
like Joe Rogan's like
yes yeah
Joe Rogan
I don't think it works like that you can't just like
just do that
okay I'm just gonna make money now
maybe you can but like eh
sorry
I'm laughing cause in chat act
deft in chat says winner winner chicken
dinner and that's what we can have at DragonCon
I love it
only if it can be like southern fried
chicken there you go alright
moving on one more email this week
from Sam it's short and sweet
but I'm gonna read this anyway from Sam
hello OLR crew show 700
was very special just because it was
a regular show good call
do any of you think well first off thank you for
that you know like I
I somehow sometimes I think that's the best way
to do it to just acknowledge the
big event and then do what people
show up for every week you know I think if we
had spent three hours just talking about ourselves
or doing a retrospective
or something it just wouldn't that's not the show
you guys necessarily signed up to hear
um retrospectives are good though
don't get me wrong but those can be like
specials or something like and sometimes
we do those too remember we did that marathon show
for nine hours that was pretty great alright anyway
um so moving
on with Sam's email do any of you
think Nintendo should have put the
NES and SNES classic systems
on the Switch to increase
sales thank you Sam
uh well Sam I think that's kind of a
common complaint here at Orange Lounge Radio
uh is kind of one of those
what are they doing when we see that the NES
and the Super Nintendo games they're on the Wii
they're on the Wii U but for whatever reason
they're not on the Switch um and
I think I've said this before on the show and I'm going to say it
again is that don't get your hopes
up that those NES and SNES classic games
are going to show up on the Switch at least
not in the same way um
we know that Nintendo is working on
something with this whole online system that they're
doing that you're going to be able to play games
uh it sounds like NES games like
Balloon Fight I think is one that they've kind of shown
that you'll be able to play it across the internet
okay basically and that's going to be the new thing
the thing we said virtual consoles should have done like
ten years ago they're finally going to be bringing
into that but that may not
be virtual console
I think if Nintendo does
virtual console for Switch it's going to
be Gabe Cube games
maybe Wii games if
that you know the HD
you know the control system kind of works with
Wii if they emulate that alright um
you'll have that
uh but like GameCube games and like
the newer Nintendo games I don't think
you're going to have the older stuff that is
going to be reserved for the online component
um which
will because you're going to be paying a monthly
fee for that uh it may or may not
overlap really with the NES and
the SNES classics yeah I think
we've been sitting here for a while going it would
be great if Nintendo just
releases a bundle on the Switch that's
all these classic games and I think
people would be very happy um
but Nintendo is gonna
Nintendo and sometimes the things
that they do don't always make sense to us
well at least from what
I've been hearing just following the whole
SNES classic thing it does sound like
that they are getting a lot more systems
per location
at least everybody that's been posting
online they've said you know my
GameStop only got nine NES
classic editions they're getting 30 of
the SNES so and a lot of
the other locations like Walmart and Best Buy
are getting you know double digit
numbers you know significant double
digit numbers so okay
hopefully that's a good sign
so fingers crossed this may be
I'm actually gonna try I'm just gonna
for the fuck of it I'm just gonna stop by Walmart
on that day
just to see if it's there just to see
and I'm not getting my hopes up or whatever
I'm just gonna see is it is curious
here's my question is it limited
to the places that Nintendo was saying
or like would you be able to find
it at more independent stores or maybe
even other chains like Fries
is one that comes to mind because Fries maybe
I always forget that Fries has the
same fucking games everybody else does Fries
maybe I would think like big box
stores are gonna probably have it independent chains
are usually third rate
when it comes to publishers
so they're gonna supply the big box
stores first actdeft in chat says
you'll probably have better luck at Target and you
know what I tend to agree you'll probably have
better luck at Target you know what
I don't know if the Target app still does it but it
used to cause that's how I found a Wii U
you could go into the Target app and it'll tell you
like it's in stock at this store or it's not
I may try that
just for fun
I'm curious I you know
if you're gonna go to Walmart I'm gonna tell you
exactly which one to go to I don't mean to get too local
but do you know how we joke about the Walmart
in the middle of nowhere
the one over by Anatolia
no it's not over there it's over like you gotta
go like um okay so
oh yeah yeah
you go but you go the other way
down and there's a Walmart out there where you're like
where's the fucking people out here there's no
people try that one
cause that would be the one I would try
that's a little out of my way but
yeah I just figured I'd try the one by my house
since it's right by my house
ooh SSU100Matt with a good point
in chat saying doesn't help that this Friday is
Yom Kippur oh I didn't
realize that but that's right
some people are gonna be doing
things related to that and they can't necessarily
just go out shopping so hmm interesting
alright
anyway oh YYR points out though it's Friday
night into Saturday so I guess maybe
you could go out in the morning but you're not gonna
be able to maybe hunt all day long so
alright anyhow that was it for emails
tonight thank you guys for the emails
send us more for next week participate
at Orangeloungeradio.com
if you wanna participate with Mailbag next week
we do have some more news for you guys before we get
to the Skype line at Orangeloungeradio
let's get to Loki with the next story
so as we were talking about the whole steam review changes
and stuff and how people are review bombing stuff
one of the games that came out of course was NBA 2K18
there was a huge backlash after
their whole virtual currency
this is literally what they call it because they
couldn't think of anything creative to call it
was kind of fuck
fake money didn't fly
it was kind of fucking up everything because
one of the big gripes with this they've been doing
virtual currency since 2K13 but one of the big
gripes is that the
virtual currency this time around they're really
whoring that shit so like
it would take several games
of actually planning to earn that virtual currency
to actually level up and that's only if you
like got the best stats in the game
whereas it could take several
hours of grinding
on top of that the stuff that you get
and unlock the different customizables
they're
not transferable between
your characters and like the haircuts in the game
instead of actually unlocking the haircut
they'll toggle it on and off and stuff
they're going the whole Destiny 2 route
and they are
consumables so you get your haircut
which originally was costing
you know I think
it was like 500 VC or something
like that so it was one game
but now they've dropped the price
of the actual haircuts down to
100 VC
oh haircut I'm sorry it was 1500
originally so they would give you like
I think five or six thousand to begin with
and then now they're
kind of dropping the prices of all that
because people aren't too happy with it
and they're looking to see about maybe changing
some of the other balancing it still sucks
so that they're doing this and don't support it
well I guess at least the company's
kind of listening to the feedback for better
a little bit but like I mean they've been doing it this long
they just have to find the right balance
between fucking over their
consumers and them noticing
alright
well moving on this week a lot of people's
childhoods
got a harsh taste of
reality this week and I'm sure you all
know
it's a little quiet and coming through but
the Toys R Us song
I don't want to grow up I'm a Toys R Us kid
well you're going to have to grow up and face the facts
that sometimes when you don't pay your bills you go bankrupt
so that
is what's happening with Toys R Us and it's unfortunate
because you know
I think a lot of us have fond memories
of going to Toys R Us
and pulling the tag for a game
do you know did I tell you when
Shane and I went to Chico because he was
hunting for Power Rangers when we drove up to Chico
which is like a good 90 minutes two hours away from here
we drove up there on a search for some
damn Power Rangers toys
but we freaked out when we went to the gaming section
because we were like oh my god they still have tags
here that you pulled to take up to the front
what the fuck this is a time capsule
there weren't a whole lot of department
stores like it wasn't like this
this is before like the whole Walmart
and Target thing I mean Toys R Us
was like the fucking
big ass toy store
it was a fucking event to go
to see Toys R Us
now to be clear they just filed for
bankruptcy so they're not and Bobby's
kind of yelling at us in chat
they're not closing all their stores or anything like that
not yet anyway but
this isn't necessarily a very good sign
that they have filed for bankruptcy
however what does this
have to do with gaming well some of you get your games there
but some people were wondering
with some of the news about how suppliers
were not even letting Toys R Us
buy from them unless Toys R Us
basically paid cash up front
some people were wondering is Toys R
Us still going to get the Super Nintendo Mini
and the answer is yes
there will be a limited supply
of the console remember Toys R Us
didn't do preorders so there will be a limited
supply of the console but Super Nintendo
Minis may still be available to purchase
excuse me will still be available to purchase
if your store got enough
from launch day which is September
29th
stores will open at normal time and have
limited inventory of the console
so we encourage customers to get in line before
doors open on Friday morning for the chance
to scoop up this hot item
so maybe the one takeaway with this is that
some people were maybe thinking
Toys R Us was going to be their best bet
because they didn't take preorders
but it sounds like Toys R Us may just
not have a very healthy stock
of these so you may be risking it
going to Toys R Us so you are going to
my honest advice to you is like
try to split up and
hit like if you are in a household that's
more than one person and one is going to
be enough for you because most of these places are probably going to limit
one per customer but if one is going to be enough for
your household you go one store
have your partner go to another
store you know have
a friend that doesn't really
care but will help you out go to a third
store spread out divide and conquer
that might be the best way to do it
alright
rama in chat over at live.voggenetwork.com
points out this isn't the first time Toys R
Us has filed for bankruptcy well Toys
R Us isn't quite the event that it
used to be right it's not
do your kids get excited about Toys R Us trips?
They like going there every now and then although
the one time that
we can go to the bookstore
or we can go to Toys R Us which one are you going to want to
oh I get a bookstore why because we want to
play at the train table there like if there's
a train table over at
which I don't understand either because they have
a fucking train table
in our house Loki most parents
would be thrilled that their kids want to go read books
fuck no I want to look at goddamn
Legos and there's more Legos
there oh this isn't about
them it's about you no it's about my crack addict
okay
it's not about the kids it's about me
needing to sniff the crack okay
tell
tell them you know what tell them
next time they want to go to Barnes and Noble to play
with the train set just tell them Barnes and Noble
threw it in the trash
see what happens
no they
play at the train table and stuff and I occasionally
look at the Legos and I
balk at how everything is so expensive but I want
it and that's usually
alright moving on
Loki how about some more gaming news
alright so Minecraft is
still continuing on their Better Together
updates so now it's available now
on most of the Legacy devices
so right now
that update of course the one that
allows you to play across multiple
devices different platforms
they have that drop now on
Xbox One, Windows 10, Mobile
VR and the Switch version
will be coming soon
but that's pretty exciting I still have yet to go
back in there and actually try it on Windows 10
version I'm curious to see how that
is
yeah I mean
great news if everybody wants to play
together I think that we have to do that
in the realms area so I'm
sorry it also offers the ability
to share invites invite links
to the realms which is basically their
version of like servers
which I still think that costs
money each month but it's kind of interesting
it'd be interesting to go back to that
I remember when we ran a server if it wasn't such a
pain in the ass I'd still do it
it was just you know even it wasn't that
expensive it was like $5 a month but
it was just kind of a pain
in the ass to do updates especially when you have mods
in doing updates it's just a pain in the
ass to do that but maybe vanilla
we could do vanilla I don't know
yeah the VOG Minecraft server was
a fun thing for a little while
but I would maybe be more willing to do
this because in this way a lot
more people I would think maybe hopefully be able to
play because it's on console and you can just go
check it out there
I bet that would be awesome
also some awesome news from Nintendo
catching up with the digital age
this is great there is now a
new app authenticator for Nintendo
so you can actually get two factor
authentication on your Nintendo account
which you know in this day and age
when we have stolen passwords left
and right from break-ins and what have you
I shit you not this week I had
text messages while I was sleeping
on Wednesday or Thursday night
my Blizzard account got
like 5 text messages
your Blizzard authenticator code is
in this code they came in
somebody was fucking trying to get into my Blizzard
account and I guess had somehow
figured out my password which isn't this
interesting I use a unique password
for Blizzard that I don't use anywhere else
so not only
do I use a unique password I don't use anywhere
else but I also have two factor authentication
on and somehow somebody got the Blizzard password
I'd really like to know how that happened because
I don't have to log into
Blizzard anything anywhere like ever
so it's very strange
to me that that happened
but anyway for whatever reason I got a bunch
of Blizzard so I went in and changed my password
but thankfully two factor authentication
saved somebody going in there
and you know probably trying to get into my WOW
account although joke's on them I cancelled that a while
ago so anyway
maybe you don't want somebody getting
into your Nintendo account and you know
buying stuff that they turn around and sell
like what was the big thing on Xbox
it's the fake money shit
like NBA 2K18
stuff that's the stuff they get in there
and they buy a bunch of it and sell it so anyway
good news Nintendo's
catching up to this maybe because of
NBA 2K18 who knows but
yeah I would definitely recommend
you enable the two factor authentication I think
that'd be a great idea to enable it you
go to Nintendo's login web
portal over at accounts.nintendo.com
slash login and then you're gonna
check out the sign in and security section
you have to verify your email
address and then you can enable the two factor
authentication every
new login from your Nintendo account requires
authorization from you besides
just the login and password via
an app or a code
texted to you which is kind of the modern way
of how most of these things work so
good job Nintendo getting on that TFA
before you start charging people
for online good job
just a couple more stories for you
guys and then it'll be Skype line time
but first Loki alright and then
this is a shock to no one
but hey remember that Mario
Super Mario 64 online
game yeah there was no
way that wasn't gonna get a copyright
strike and of course that's what happened
they've been copyright striking
the crap out of any videos that were posted
on there on
YouTube at least with it and
of course you know apparently
the developer of the
online game has been
you know basically stating that
it's gonna take a break from it for a little bit
until after Super Mario
Odyssey comes out and they're gonna
hopefully release some updates
after that but
yep I'm not surprised
that this happened I mean
why not
makes sense yeah I don't think a lot
of us are very surprised at this at all
but it's just the videos so far they've been taken down
I don't think they've actually tried to
ah the Patreon's gone too I'm pretty sure
well
no cause they're I don't
know if the Patreon's gone yet but
I think it was I think that was the big problem
see here this is the guy making money off it
oh yes okay so they did
a strike against the Patreon thing
and the YouTube videos were down he hasn't
received the cease and desist yet
but it may come to that if he
doesn't stop updating it but
it's out there now so there's it's too late
honestly the Patreon was
the real problem here I think Nintendo kinda would've
done this eventually anyway especially with all the blog
coverage it was getting but the Patreon
like made it happen faster because
the fact that the guy was getting money off of it
I mean no matter what
you wanna say the reality is
Nintendo was gonna say he's making money
off of our character and that's a no
no you know there's
yeah there's only so many ways you can
spin that I mean I thought the mod was
great and I wish he could work on the mod
but he's gonna have to find other ways to get
compensation from people
Nintendo can you please carry forward with this idea
right that would be awesome
to see like old games with like a twist
like this I know I kinda love it
well like even like they went back
and they redid Excitebike not that long
ago where it's like online now
you know it's just a little shitty thing but it was
cool for a week
you know so I think it would be neat to
go back to Mario 64 and add some of this stuff
into it so
or maybe these games just need to find new
collaborations such as they did
in our last story tonight with
Sonic Forces
that's right at an announcement at Tokyo Game Show
2017 there is going to be an official collaboration
between Sonic Forces and
Hooters
that's right but this is Hooters in Japan
I didn't even know Hooters was in Japan
is Hooters in Japan a class year joint or is it
what's the difference
I've never been to Hooters in Japan
maybe the menu items
I don't know hopefully their food doesn't suck
has anyone in chat ever been to Hooters
I feel like the okay so here's the thing
we didn't have Hooters in California for the
longest time right
it was like a thing where it was like oh we've heard of this but that's like
I think they've closed down all the Hooters over here
the only one that I know of that's still running is
the one in Rancho is still open no it's not
it's not yeah it's closed oh shit
maybe they are all closed
it's infidel yeah it's gone
oh shit no that was still open not that long
ago oh maybe they are all gone
I don't know but anyway well I guess they're gone
well here's the thing like you know when they first
finally came to California after all this time it was like
oh let's go to Hooters and then I think everybody
realized oh wow their food sucks
the food sucks
and you know I was always
you know obviously I've made no secret
that I'm gay on this show so you know
the ladies at Hooters don't really do it for me
but I always thought they were really nice and friendly
they were very friendly it was a little
weird I mean it was just kind of like
hey why are you sitting down at my table to take my order
that's a little weird
I always thought it was
I get it that you're trying to be friendly and busty but you know
it's just it's weird
and it wasn't that we I remember we went to
the one that was
with Annie and Jim actually
we hadn't gone and we went there
Flaco Jones and wife yes
Flaco Jones and wife so we went there and
I remember I
got a hamburger and the hamburger was kind of
crap and then I was like okay well
everybody says the wings are good so
I'm gonna try the wings it took an hour to get
wings and
they were not good I did not
like them but then again to be fair I don't like
buffalo wings but
they I've tried
their wings in different sauces
other hooter locations
and I've been the three or four different
ones not liking any of them
their food was just no thanks
wow sure enough
so I'm looking I'm looking at the news from the SACB
on June 9th the Hooters and Rancho Cordova
closed uh the second
Hooters closing in a year because the one over by
Arden Mall closed I'm sorry I know this is a worldwide
podcast which you didn't have to this involves
our hooters local news okay but
it involves our hooters and so this is important
um so anyway
uh this was a decision made by the landlord
as they exercised the right to terminate
the lease pursuing a different direction
with the property so they
didn't want to hooters there anymore that's dumb
it was kind of dumb I thought
it was just because that's what happened to Ferrell's
you know that turned into Old Spaghetti Factory recently
cause that place Ferrell's was
always fucking hopping we don't like ice
cream fuck you guys
it's just this kind of clientele
is not good for us
oh my we want hooters there
uh the one in
Arden did you know what it's getting turned
into I had no idea the one in Arden
a sizzler
hahaha
that's funny
yeah in April it was announced that the site
would become a sizzler
hahaha
fuck this hooters nonsense
but the SACB does point
out there is one remaining
hooters and it's the one
in Natomas the one by the movies in Natomas
how ironic
there it is
alright now you're all up to speed
on the local hooters drama
but good old
dar to see ya in our chat room found us
a hooters of japan menu
so they have such things like
salads with cob salad
shrimp and spinach salad this is all
the same shit you can get here right there's nothing really
I don't think I see anything that's
out of the norm really
do they have all these sandwiches and stuff
muscle with garlic butter that sounds
fancy for seafood so maybe
they have a couple extra items but not really
so sounds kind of very
similar to what we have here anyway where the fuck
were we oh yeah Sonic the Hedgehog in
hooters hahaha
they're going to be doing a collaboration
but the collaboration starts
in the middle of October and further information
is to come they didn't really say what it's
going to be and if Amy will
be involved but I somehow
think not what do you think
what do you think the Sonic and hooters collaboration
will be I would say tweets
from the Sonic the Hedgehog account for sure
what
well the only thing I can think that has
that's in common with hooters
and Sonic the Hedgehog is
the hooters food
makes you gotta go fast
so
I mean that's kind of a
tie in right there
other than that
I have no idea but you know what
good night everybody
show's cancelled kids need
more kids need to come to hooters
I guess because it's awkward
it's such a kids restaurant
it's all about owls everybody loves owls
everybody loves owls Sonic the Hedgehog
is not an owl last time I checked
oh he's getting another friend
hootie the owl
alright
we're going to open up the
skype line it's time to hear from you guys
orange lounge radio all one
word on skype if you want to tell us
about your local hooters drama
we'd love to hear it orange
lounge radio all one word on skype if you want to give
us a call let me check in with loki while
we wait to see if a call comes in I do have skype
running I have to do the whole ipad
thing again tonight but I think it should work
so anyway meanwhile
I'm going to check in with loki and see if there's any last minute stories
I didn't really have anything last minute but did you
get to catch the new trailer for the new
Tomb Raider oh the movie
yes I did I did watch it and I totally
recognize scenes from the game like the whole thing in the boat that was
the beginning of the game yeah it looked kind of cool except for the
clicking in the background of the trailer
but I know that was for artistic
effect was it I don't even
really pick that up it's neat
I look better
better than some of the other Tomb Raider movies
yeah yeah so yeah no I would go
see it I mean I never seem to get to go to
movies anymore but I would go see it for sure
so anyway we do have a call coming
in so I'm going to try to pick this up here and
connect on our skype line and we will get
to the telephones
uh hello you're on orange lounge radio who's this
uh this is
yyr hey yyr how you doing
I'm doing okay I guess the
ipad is working yes the ipad is
where it's a little slower to connect which I don't like
but it works it gets the job done
ipad therefore I am
uh well
uh actually the main reason why I'm calling
is because I wanted to
answer your inquiry from last week
which you may or may not actually remember
um I guess
I can see the expression on your face
means I should probably remind you
shit I forgot I forgot that we have a
camera now because of this ipad alright
now you
you have nothing to be ashamed of it's a fine
looking face so um
anyway
um yes it was
was mentioning that
you know I came to this realization about
the shift keys on a typical
keyboard not being the same size
yes because I was working on the
interface for super multitasking
and you were wondering why does
that matter what does this have to do
with the interface so
so yeah uh as you
may recall super multitasking is a
game which has you playing
multiple games at the same time
in various areas of the screen
and now there's nothing I
can do to make this easier but what I
did want to do is give the player
uh as many tools
as possible to
make playing it
at least as
frustration free as possible so that
they can focus on actually trying to
multitask so and one
way I do that is by
in each area of the screen where a game can
appear I label what controls
are used in that area
for example in that left side
slot where you can use the left
stick or the d-pad I have
visual representation of both
the left stick and the d-pad
you know so just in case you know
oh uh there's a game over there what
do I play it with again oh yeah
so now here's the thing
this is the first version of this game that allows
you to use the keyboard as
well as a controller
but not just that I don't
just set up a configuration
and force you to use it you can
define any key configuration
you want
good man because accessibility
very important but I still
wanted to visually represent
the keys that you have selected
no matter what keys they
were so I wanted to
visually represent all of the different keys
in the background and
since some keys are wider than others
if you want to do that properly
well let's just say I measured
all of the key widths on
a couple of different keyboards
and uh yeah
so
what did you think of the realization
that some shift keys are
larger but some are not
I think it's
kind of like a metaphor
for life really
mostly about penis sizes
uh yeah I think
you're just going to have to do your best with
that representation YYR and
it is what it is in that regard and if somebody
really sends you an email that says you
did not accurately represent the shift key
on my keyboard then just take that email
and throw it away
I'll just say I did the best I could
I mean I hope that
there are a few people that are like
wow that is some crazy attention to
detail there so
we know we need to all review bomb
multitasking by saying the
shift key no it's a positive
it's going to be an uplifting review bomb to say
the shift key was appropriately
represented
well I just believe in equal
representation for all my keys
good good for you you're a good man
YYR any hints
on when we might be playing
multitasking for ourselves?
I am feverishly trying to complete
all of the various and sundry
things on my list some of which
weren't there a day ago but I just
keep finding things that I meant to do
anyway but never actually
wrote down so I
originally had said fall
I think fall officially ended three
two days ago something like
fall just started two days ago
oh no
I meant oh summer oh you're right
yeah summer I had said summer
so fall just started and I missed
I missed summer so I'm
now saying fall and I hope
I will be able to complete it and release it
during the fall so otherwise
it will be my own fall that's alright
fingers and toes crossed for you that you can
do it it's you know what you're not the first
developer to ever have to delay a release date
so at least you can you know feel that
and you know insert
something about a bad game is bad forever
blah blah blah perfect you
know what what if you guys what if you'd
release the game and the shift the shift
key was not right
shift gate
shift
gate
and with that we're going to end this
call but thank you yyr I really appreciate the phone
call you take care okay
I'm just going to throw in one more thing
if you'll allow me
xbox live indie games
delisting is this Friday
so I'm not just talking about
yyr games all
3000 plus of them so if there was
anything at any point that you were
interested in picking up do it now
because in five days it will all be
gone the clock is ticking y'all
and if you're listening on the podcast feed that's even
less time so this is
your last chance to get bungee ferret tossing at
least on the 360 because we're going to hope that
maybe yyr is able to move these games
somewhere else but you'll see it again
I guarantee it again good
good good alright well my friend
I'm going to let you go so we can try to take some more calls but thanks
so much I appreciate the update have a great
week everyone hey you too buddy take care
take it easy yep alright
that's yyr everybody here on the
skype line we are going to open it up for some more calls
orange lounge radio all one word on skype
if you would like to give us a call
check in with loki to see if there's any other things you want to
bring up there no I don't have anything
nothing else oh my gosh
let's see go into our chat over at
live.vog network.com actdef saying
I didn't like the trailer I found it
meh talking about the tomb raider thing we were talking about
before that last call dungeon
buster says the tomb raider trailer was
neat the poster was meh
there you go
let's see mxc in chat
says I have so many xbox live indie
game titles yeah I had
quite a few too but I haven't
plugged in my xbox 360 in the longest
time it's sad but there's just
not a lot I mean with the backwards compatibility now
on xbox one there's very little that
I would need the 360 to play and it's
like I've got enough between
xbox or
between the playstation 4 the switch
xbox one I've got enough so that I'm not
on 360 so
they have a game that just hit early access
ballistic ng
which you may not recognize that but it is
a wipe out
type clone that's on
steam like the racing game yeah and it has
I think I want to say
market or the steam
I think you can do customized
stuff in there maybe not I don't know
they have a modding api so that's kind of cool
but you can check it out it's five
dollars oh that's not bad
yeah that's a good price all right
one last call for calls is your last chance
orange lounge radio all one word on skype if you
want to give us a call and actually you know
look at this it's been up for a while my mistake I'm
just learning about now though good job Loki
we're just only about a year and two months
late uh yyr suggests if you want
to read up on xbox live indie games super
quickly try the
xb lig
xbox live indie games xb lig the
xb lig.com or indie
gamer chick.com both sites have
a ton of reviews
yes they do all right
well I am not hearing our skype line light up
so I think that is going to do it for the skype line tonight
um sorry if you were trying
and you couldn't get through for whatever reason but you can
always um you know you can always uh
send us an email at participate at orange
lounge radio dot com or uh you can
always send us a tweet twitter dot com
slash o l r but I guess for tonight
we are going to wrap up I know it was a little bit of a shorter
show tonight but we didn't have dark soccer tonight and
well you know it's a little just just not as
much to say tonight some weeks are just a little slower
than others but uh that's all right we'll be
back again to do it in seven days uh if you liked
what you did hear we did fill a good two hours here
at orange lounge radio tonight so if you did like what
you heard here at orange lounge radio tell a friend
or two about the show help us spread the word
because we are the show where every gamer has a voice
but um you know if the voices aren't here we can't
really hear them so a nice five star review on a site
like itunes google play or
wherever it is you found this show goes an awful
long way um
I think uh
we should probably wrap it up with some final thoughts
loki your final thought tonight
uh my final thought is
I'm gonna work on more
lego stuff this week actually I've been using a lot
of the digital designer so it's been fun
I've been trying to do a mock of my
house but the problem is it's so
huge um
it's just like it's gonna take up four base plates
so that's that's way too big
that's gonna take up like a whole table so
I need I'm trying to shrink it down
but it's hard to shrink down
uh floor plan on my house
alright and uh my final
thought tonight is uh I need to make sure
I play something new this week I'm enjoying playing
the same old games like overwatch and
stuff I need to make sure I play something new this week
so I will uh I will do that
so for now though we're gonna wrap
up we'll see you back here in seven days
hopefully dark soccer is back with us and believe it or not
we're gonna be in october by the next time
we're back time flies you guys
crazy anyway that's gonna do it for tonight
until next time thanks for listening to orange lounge
radio and good night
see you next week
you
