7000	13000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	21000	Tonight, prepare your brains for a huge retcon, one that takes Mario down a notch or two, allowing him to only be able to rely on the skills of his entire gaming history.
21000	27000	Stay tuned for this and the rest of the week's gaming news, hopefully not all as shocking, starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
27000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	37000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37000	45000	It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight on September the 10th of 2017, episode number 699 of our show.
45000	56000	Here to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with all of you guys out there on the entire internet, all of it, and my co-host here in studio, DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers up first.
56000	57000	Sup?
57000	58000	Hi, how are you?
58000	59000	I'm full now.
59000	62000	You're full? Full of garbage? I'm just kidding.
62000	64000	No, you ate my food and it was delicious.
64000	67000	Yes, yes. DarkSakura cooked a chicken or something. What was-
67000	69000	Well, Dan, I made Dan grill it, but I marinated it.
69000	71000	Oh, you worked together!
71000	72000	I made a marinade.
72000	75000	Aww, it was like a very husband-wife thing to do, cook together.
75000	76000	Yeah.
76000	77000	Aww.
77000	80000	Did you enjoy the week off? How was your labor day?
80000	81000	Laborious?
82000	88000	No, I was out in 105 degree weather watching Peppermint perform.
88000	96000	Yeah, yes, I missed all that. Well, I mean, the rainbow festival and all that that you were doing sounds like it was awesome, but the heat wave? No thanks.
96000	97000	I went home pretty sick.
97000	105000	I think it says something pretty strongly that Atlanta was having perfect weather. The humidity wasn't even that bad, or I'm just used to it now after five years of Dragon Con.
105000	113000	The humidity wasn't even that bad. When I was reading all the stuff back home about 115 degrees here in Sacramento, I was like, nope. No thanks.
113000	126000	I went out to work the rainbow festival, and it was nice doing something good for the community, but there were fewer vendors than there were last year. Last year was actually my first year going.
126000	144000	But I have to say, though, Taryn Through You was, of course, the hostess, local queen, who was always amazing to watch. And Mercury Rising performed, who's another local queen, who is also just a really nice person.
144000	150000	And then finally Peppermint came on stage and sang.
150000	151000	Oh nice.
151000	153000	Like legit sang, didn't lip sync.
153000	154000	Okay.
154000	167000	And it was a really good performance, but by the time I was done with it, I was way too hot. And so I couldn't get like cool until I got home under the cold tap.
167000	171000	So it was really bad. I got a little hot heat sick.
171000	177000	Yeah, the heat was no joke. I would not have wanted to been out in it if I was here. So I'm kind of really glad I missed it for that reason.
177000	181000	Yeah. Well, I also missed him. Say hello to Techmaster Loki. How are you doing?
181000	182000	I'm doing fine.
182000	189000	And happy birthday early. Tomorrow is Loki's birthday, for those that are unaware. What, 36?
189000	190000	37.
190000	191000	37?
191000	192000	In a row?
192000	196000	Oh, there we go. It's this year. Yay. In a row? Thank you, DarkSaga.
196000	205000	Well, happy early birthday to you. And I noticed that the misses kind of went in on a gift for you with you. Obviously, it's your money too.
205000	211000	Yeah. I mean, not to play it down or anything, we were shopping for a car. Anyways, it just happened that we found on this weekend.
211000	213000	Sure. So you got a new car.
213000	215000	Yeah, I got a brand new car.
215000	216000	Nice.
216000	221000	So I had a 2008 fit and I traded in for a 2017 fit.
221000	222000	There you go.
222000	224000	And now it's not red, it's white.
224000	231000	Okay. And the next one can be blue because America. Exactly. Even though it's a Japanese car. But I have something. I was going with some sort of-
231000	233000	I was going with Mexico, I think.
233000	239000	I was going with some sort of reference there. Great. Well, happy early birthday and glad to hear you got the new car.
239000	243000	We'll check in with everyone's gaming weeks in just a little bit and get into our kickoff topic.
243000	252000	But first, I want to say hello to our chatters over at live.vognetwork.com because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.
252000	256000	Six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
256000	267000	And some folks in chat tonight commenting that the quality of the show seems different, which is weird because I did not make any changes except I uninstalled and reinstalled Skype to get that to work.
267000	269000	Well, I also have a new microphone.
269000	274000	That's right. Loki does have a new microphone. So that might be worth mentioning because some of you guys were mentioning a couple weeks ago.
274000	279000	I think we found there was a short in the cable or something like that. So Loki may sound different. I would expect that.
279000	283000	But I wouldn't expect the entire quality of the show to be different. That's the weird-
283000	286000	God, no. Lower those expectations.
286000	293000	Well, we'll see. Hopefully the podcast sounds the same. Maybe it just has something to do with the live broadcasting or something. Who knows?
293000	297000	I don't know. Maybe it sounds better. I don't know. Anyway.
297000	310000	Hey, if you are discovering Orange Launch Radio because of Dragon Con and the podcast track of the Dragon Con event, I just want to say hi and welcome because the podcast track was awesome in having me on several panels this year.
310000	318000	And I got to do a lot of networking. I had a great time at Dragon Con. This was my fifth year there. And I almost feel like this is the best one yet in many ways.
318000	325000	And a lot of great motivation coming from Dragon Con and the podcast track. I really want to thank Brian Dunaway from Film Sack.
325000	331000	And I want to thank Charles McFall from Pokemon Go Podcast and everyone really involved in the podcast track.
331000	334000	Because I don't remember all the names and podcasts off the top of my head.
334000	343000	But I want to thank everybody for having me as a guest this year and letting me participate in panels because I'm sure it was very motivating for other people, but it was also very motivating for myself.
343000	350000	And yeah, I just had a great time. So welcome to our little show if it's your first time listening and you found out about it over at Dragon Con.
350000	358000	I'll give you the elevator pitch on Orange Launch Radio real quick. We're on episode 699 tonight. So we've been going for 15 years.
359000	365000	15 years ago, myself, Loki, and DarkSakura, we all met playing a little video game called Dance Dance Revolution.
365000	370000	Yes, where the arrows scroll up the screen and cheesy techno dance music plays all the time. But we loved it.
370000	377000	And there was a whole community around that game and all the music games that Konami was putting out around that time in a series known as Bamani Beat Mania.
377000	386000	So we all got together being fans of that. And we started this little show for that community to monitor the tournaments, to monitor the new releases of these games.
386000	392000	Because, you know, there were six or seven games in the series that were all getting new updates. So we were about music games in the beginning.
392000	403000	But as the Mamani series kind of started to slow down, we had a little lull before Guitar Hero 2 really took off and I think changed the industry kind of back into music games with that and rock band.
403000	413000	We kind of shifted to, it was right around the time podcasting got bigger. So we kind of shifted to a show that's now podcast about all video games.
413000	420000	Because it turns out there's more games we like than just DDR. Right, Dark Sakura? There were other games that you played back then besides just DDR.
420000	427000	Like you would use your dance mat to play Soul Calibur, right? I'm just kidding. I feel like you tried that at one point.
427000	428000	I did.
428000	429000	Yes, I knew it.
429000	432000	But I beat the game with Rod Calibur.
432000	434000	Nice. Okay. See, there you go. There you go.
434000	435000	It works best with Siegfried.
436000	450000	I remember you were the first one that ever introduced me to, well actually, when I was first getting into DDR, I mean, I always knew that obviously I knew gaming in Japan was a scene and that they had games that we did it and all that.
450000	464000	But it was really because of DDR and meeting people like Dark Sakura that like my eyes really got opened up to how like, oh, what do you mean it's called Bust a Move in Japan and all the songs are different and most of them are actually better.
464000	472000	And what do you mean that there's this whole Castlevania game that I never got to play here in the US and all this other stuff like my eyes really got opened all that.
472000	474000	So, you know, now here we are 15 years later.
474000	476000	Welcome to the world of imports.
476000	479000	Yeah. Right. Right. That was what it is. You taught me how to mod my first PlayStation.
479000	484000	Actually, it wasn't. You didn't really have to teach me much. You were like, here, I have like
484000	485000	Here's a paperclip.
485000	491000	No, here is this plug because I have 5000 extras. You put this plug in the back of your PlayStation. Have fun.
491000	496000	Yeah. Yours was the one that you use like the five point switch for.
496000	501000	But it still had the I.O. port in the back, which meant all you have to do is just use the plug.
501000	509000	Yes. We still have a first gen PlayStation that takes like you use a paperclip.
509000	512000	Yeah. Or a really stiff twist tie.
512000	515000	Just hold the button in and then switch your desks.
515000	520000	So, yeah. So we all learn from each other about this great gaming culture.
520000	524000	And we invite all you to do it every week because, you know, we used to play DDR.
524000	529000	And after we were done playing DDR, we'd all go to the food place out front of Roseville Golf Land.
529000	532000	And we'd sit there and have dinner and talk a little smack about our favorite hobbies.
532000	536000	So that's kind of this is the world's biggest diner table is how I envision it.
536000	539000	And we're just here to talk a little smack about gaming news.
539000	541000	I don't think we're going to break gaming news here.
541000	545000	I think there's plenty of blogs and Twitter and all that stuff that's going to break the news.
545000	550000	But we're going to we're going to discuss it and try to learn, you know, from each other's perspectives about it.
550000	553000	So there you go. That's Orange Launch Radio in a nutshell for those that are new.
553000	557000	I probably should have saved that spiel for next week, being that it's 700 next week.
557000	561000	But I can always just refer back. Go listen to last week's episode.
561000	563000	Talk more about what Orange Launch Radio is.
563000	570000	All right. Anyway, SSU100 Matt in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says you're just missing the mozzarella sticks.
570000	575000	And let me tell you, the mozzarella sticks at this place is it's I think it's a local chain called Brookfield's.
575000	579000	The mozzarella sticks, they're bomb. They're really good. Like some of the best.
579000	582000	So anyway, just saying, just saying. All right.
582000	590000	Let's get into our kickoff topic tonight, which actually for our kickoff topic tonight, we want to talk about some of the news that we missed while we were out.
590000	595000	So I picked three big headlines from last week leading into Labor Day that I thought we could talk about here at the top of the show.
595000	604000	First off, Nintendo announced last week, well, I don't think they really I guess they did announce it, but it was kind of obviously they don't want to make a big deal of it.
604000	613000	But they did mention that as of November 8th, Nintendo TV, Wii U chat and Miiverse will be discontinued.
613000	616000	Those services on the Wii U are no longer.
616000	625000	So effectively, the Wii U is being taken out back and shot on November 8th at three o'clock in the afternoon Japan time.
625000	631000	The official Miiverse site, including what you see on the Wii U and the 3DS even, are not going to be there.
631000	635000	However, Super Mario Maker, it says that will still be working.
635000	643000	Details to be announced later, but my assumption is they're going to do a patch that routes things a little differently and kind of removes that Miiverse element.
643000	647000	But everything else that associates with Miiverse is going to be closed.
647000	652000	There will be error codes when you try to access Miiverse, but it is gone.
652000	659000	TV, on the other hand, that was, you may not be aware, that already went away in North America.
659000	663000	TV is going to be leaving in Japan as well, where I think it's still been going.
663000	666000	But obviously Miiverse is kind of the big thing out of that.
666000	670000	So folks here in studio, folks in chat, what do you think?
670000	675000	Are you surprised to hear that Miiverse is sending hiccups this fast?
675000	685000	Or is it one of those things where you're like, not really surprised that Nintendo is quickly pulling the plug on a console that is just done, pretty much?
685000	690000	It's just kind of weird that they developed something like this and then didn't carry it over to the Switch.
690000	693000	And they have nothing to replace it.
693000	701000	Well, I mean, as far as nothing to replace it, what's interesting about the Switch is that it feels like it's built in to just games natively on the Switch.
701000	704000	Like Splatoon 2 kind of worked around it.
704000	707000	Like Splatoon 2 has this very Miiverse-esque thing in it.
707000	708000	Yeah, but it's all separate.
708000	709000	It is separate.
709000	716000	Miiverse was all kind of one community and now you're splitting everybody off in their own communities, which is kind of dumb.
716000	719000	But, was it a community worth saving?
719000	722000	Like, here's just real talk.
722000	725000	I mean, there was a lot I did like about Miiverse.
725000	729000	There was, I kind of feel like Nintendo kind of unlocked something a little bit charming with Miiverse.
729000	736000	But, it was kind of slow and clunky, not really fun to browse on the Wii U sometimes.
736000	740000	You know, just kind of had that Nintendo clunk to it when it comes to online.
740000	747000	So, it wasn't something where I was like, oh, I got to wake up and check Miiverse the same way I check Twitter or Facebook.
747000	753000	Like, it didn't really snap the same way, so it didn't encourage me to check Miiverse as often.
753000	758000	But, I mean, then why even carry it forward then in Splatoon 2 then?
758000	761000	Why even bother doing something like that if they're like, oh, this is terrible?
761000	763000	Because I think, well, okay, that's great.
763000	767000	Oh, it's terrible, but it's not terrible, but it's still terrible.
767000	770000	That's a good question, but maybe it's something that that team wanted to keep going.
770000	777000	Because I will admit, seeing some of the trends in the pictures and stuff that you get on Splatoon 2 have been kind of charming.
777000	781000	Like, there was the whole trend with all the furry stuff going on.
781000	786000	And then there was all the pro-trans stuff, which I thought was awesome that you were seeing a lot of that in the game.
786000	788000	And that was kind of, you know, there was about a week of that.
788000	793000	And then people were talking about the whole, I wish blank was real.
793000	799000	You know, like, it feels like Splatoon 2 is kind of like this meme play field for all these things.
799000	802000	Although, you know, we're talking about rights and stuff, that's not really a meme.
802000	808000	But you know what I mean, like, there's definitely like that topic of the week, be it a serious thing or a meme, that feels like it's going on in Splatoon 2.
808000	812000	And it's a fascinating thing to watch in that community, in my opinion. I don't know.
812000	814000	But you're right, it's me versus nothing.
814000	818000	But those are the same terrible people that were on Miiverse that are now in Splatoon 2, so.
818000	819000	But what's it-
819000	823000	It's just like, they want it both ways.
823000	829000	Well, but what's interesting about that is because of the way it's designed in Splatoon 2, the terrible stuff doesn't get elevated.
829000	836000	Because you can only like things, and the things with the most likes tend to get elevated. You can't dislike things.
836000	839000	You couldn't dislike things in Miiverse either.
840000	847000	I'm trying to think. No, you couldn't. But I think Splatoon, to be fair, I don't think anything's changed in that regard since Splatoon 1.
847000	850000	Splatoon 1 had all its memes that made it, you know, what it was too.
850000	856000	Alright, whatever. It's different. It's still the same. Whatever. It's terrible. Let's put it back in there.
856000	860000	Except don't lean on this game and separate everybody out.
860000	863000	Because this is what we think the consumer wants.
863000	868000	JD in chat says, you can also report things that are super bad. That's true.
868000	872000	JD also points out, my Nintendo account still gives bonuses for logging into Miiverse.
872000	875000	Well, I imagine that's going to be changing relatively soon.
875000	877000	I wonder what it's going to do to me, Tomo.
877000	879000	That's a- Ooh, that's a great-
879000	880000	Because there was just an update.
880000	884000	That's a very good question. But does Mi- Tomo isn't really powered by Miiverse.
884000	885000	Mi Tomo's a separate thing.
885000	886000	Does anybody still play that?
886000	887000	Yeah, Jamie does.
887000	889000	Okay, aside from Jamie.
889000	890000	Tons of people.
890000	892000	There's dozens of them.
892000	897000	Not as many as in the first week, but I know, like my buddy Jonko says, was trying to get me to check in on it.
897000	900000	So there's, there's other people that check in on it.
900000	908000	Well, um, at any rate, they just put out an update to go with the, um, I think some of the other Mi options for-
908000	912000	I'll have to look at the, the update history. There was an update just a week ago.
913000	914000	So.
914000	918000	Uh, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, more people play Mi Tomo than Pokemon Go.
918000	920000	That's probably not true.
920000	921000	I can't argue with that logic.
921000	925000	But, but I would bet more people play Mi Tomo than Ingress. That I would bet.
925000	929000	So, you know, you can't say that it's totally an itch thing.
929000	933000	Uh, anyway, let's see. Um, what was the other thing I wanted to say?
933000	938000	Oh, Kaizhudo in chat says, my Mi verse wasn't slow and clunky at all. Maybe your wi fi was janky.
938000	943000	Well, it runs this show okay. So I don't know. It just, it just didn't-
943000	948000	Like, you know how the internet just kind of snaps when you're on your phone, you bring up Facebook and snap, there's your feed.
948000	949000	Like in Mi verse, it was like-
949000	952000	Blum, blum, blum, blum, blum, blum, blum, blum, blum, blum, blum, blum, bling.
952000	954000	And then like you click into something else?
954000	956000	Blum, blum, blum, blum, blum, blum, blum, blum, blum, blum, blum, blum.
956000	961240	It's an invisible hamster right on the wheel. You just don't see the little hamster in my Wii U that powers
961240	965340	It doesn't have enough processing power to render the hamster. Like don't don't get me wrong
965340	971400	I'm not trying to dog on Miiverse like there was some good stuff that came out of it, but it wasn't perfect
971400	974920	You know and there's a lot of Nintendo's online ventures aren't but I mean
975020	981180	But Nintendo did it Nintendo's way and it brought some new things to the table as a result. So I'm
982420	984420	What?
984740	987260	For me it's it's like Nintendo
988580	990900	Throwing darts at a dartboard, you know
990900	996460	They have all these things that are gonna revolutionize something and it doesn't and it just doesn't do anything
996460	1001700	Or it's just not as like fantastic as they had talked it up to be like remember the whole
1002140	1007000	Wasn't the whole face chat thing with the Wii U wasn't that supposed to be like a revolutionary thing?
1007000	1011920	No that fucking went nowhere because they didn't leave supported. Well you first was that a revolutionary thing
1011960	1016560	Yeah for a short period of time and it went nowhere that way obviously nowhere enough to carry them
1016560	1020120	You know it to the next platform. You know what I will give you that
1020120	1025200	I do feel that Nintendo did kind of put out these features and then really did nothing to
1026120	1032820	Elevate it I think would be the right word because for example, like you say the the video chat on Wii U was pretty rad
1033440	1036000	Imagine if that could have been hooked in through 3ds somehow
1036000	1039620	I mean there's a lot of stuff and this goes back like even further than that
1039620	1043300	I mean if you talk about like the whole AR support with the 3ds
1043760	1048300	Fucking did nothing with that and to be fair Sony did fucking nothing with that either with the Vita
1048300	1051460	So right, I mean there's that it's not unique to Nintendo in that
1052180	1054180	so it's just I
1054260	1057820	Don't know like what's the newest thing that they're seeing is like revolutionary?
1057820	1061340	Okay, the switch being able to take it places and play with people and stuff like that. Mm-hmm
1061340	1064180	Okay, so how are they gonna fuck that up? I mean, I just got to figure it
1064180	1068580	Well, but but Loki you're you're assuming that Nintendo fucks everything up and I would say no
1068580	1074700	They don't because for example the the Wii itself was a gamble and the fact that you know the motion control
1074980	1076980	But I mean we tennis
1077660	1080580	Elevated that and sold the shit out of the yeah
1080580	1085380	They got lucky and they're trying to recapture that magic and they're just not it's not happening
1085380	1087380	that was that was a dart that connected and
1087900	1092620	TV on the other hand was a dart that missed but I think Nintendo really I
1092980	1097620	Think Nintendo missed out on trying to elevate the fact that you could participate in
1098100	1101020	TV along with shows like American Idol
1102540	1108380	Yeah, it was pretty cool and you could do it and like you would never know it because Nintendo was really bad at elevating that
1108540	1111660	So I that that's my criticism of Nintendo
1111660	1115900	We should do that now like have an app call it watch party and they have different things. Okay Game of Thrones
1115980	1118020	We're doing Game of Thrones tonight or something like that
1118820	1119860	Like
1119860	1124940	Why isn't that a thing? That's such a low-hanging fruit idea. No, I'm with you. I'm with you. I don't know
1124940	1129340	I am. All right. Anyway, let me look and see if there's any other comments in our chat room over at live
1130140	1132140	Vogue network comm let's see
1132260	1136380	Kaiju doing chat says Nintendo made the big mistake and forgot that most gamers over 12 years old or
1136700	1141460	Antisocial and like to play alone and not communicate. They only communicate when they want to complain about something
1142700	1146620	But now when I play with friends when I play with strangers, maybe but not when I play with friends
1146620	1147940	I want to talk a lot when I play the friend
1147940	1149740	I get it cuz I feel very
1149740	1153980	Antisocial when I want to play on like is I really I would like to just play friends
1153980	1155980	Mm-hmm. I don't really like playing with strangers
1158100	1161540	I'll do it. Like the only time is like if I'm you know, like even
1162060	1163680	Grand Theft Auto 4 was like a game
1163680	1169260	I really play heavily in or call of duty or something that play strangers just wasn't as fun as playing with friends
1169980	1171980	So I feel that
1172580	1179060	Let's see, I don't remember where this came up from but dungeon buster says more games should bring back the sound test feature
1179460	1182720	Why not? Yes. Yes, they should they should also have creepy
1183620	1189820	Hidden messages Allah sonic CD. Yes, or they should have these sounds that you play them in the sound test
1189820	1193500	You're like that wasn't in the fucking game. What is that? That's like a woman moaning. What is
1194500	1200940	Test that was when we used to put the PlayStation disc and rip all of the sound files off of it
1201620	1206980	How some of us found out that the demo disc for Jammer Lamy still had the health statement
1207820	1212260	All right. Let's talk a little bit about moving on to Sonic Mania
1212820	1216220	So obviously Sonic Mania was a huge game that came out a few weeks ago
1216220	1218220	And in the last week when we weren't here
1218300	1222200	They've released the PC version which a lot of people were looking forward to well
1222300	1228340	Unfortunately, there was a little bit of a gotcha in the PC version that it was using a DRM system
1228340	1230920	That's pretty controversial known as de nouveau
1231740	1239100	Meaning that from what I understand usually this DRM kind of requires the game to always be online Allah Diablo 3
1239900	1244080	Allah any MMO that's gonna be connected but Sonic Mania supposed to be a single-player experience
1244460	1251320	So people were really not happy about that because you shouldn't have to be online to play a game like Sonic now to be fair
1251320	1253580	Since the controversy from last week
1253580	1257980	My understanding is that there has been an update the DRM is still being used
1258060	1262920	But once you log in to activate it, you don't have to stay connected to steam anymore
1262920	1266880	You can actually play it offline. That is the fix that went in place
1267620	1270860	According to Sega on their face just don't put it in there in the first place
1270860	1274460	How about that people really don't like their DRM on PC? That's for sure
1274460	1277620	But I also I think it's also because that it's more of that
1278340	1284860	That particular DRM like it basically it's almost like malware. It just it doesn't uninstall itself
1285340	1291180	You know when you uninstall the game it's just it's a pain and they're even saying that with it enabled
1291980	1295020	The performance of the game wasn't as good
1297100	1302860	Alright so yeah, that's true when that's hogging up resources it can it can really clog up the game
1302860	1306200	And yeah a pin and then on top of that. Here's the best part about it
1306340	1313300	So because the game was delayed a week or something like that. Mm-hmm. They gave everybody on Steam, you know, hey, here's a copy of
1313660	1315660	code for Sonic 1
1316700	1322900	Well, guess what that actually con or that counted as the purchase date then on on
1323540	1329840	This the game so then once the game finally did get released you had less time or no time to
1330300	1333900	File a refund if you wanted to do that through Steam
1335540	1342380	All right, yeah, and then also the other follow-up is that that whole DRM was cracked in eight days because of court
1342380	1347180	You know what? They say hackers gonna hack, right? So they're only motivated when it's
1347980	1351700	Yeah, so there you go. Anyway, that was a thing that happened now
1351700	1356240	Let's move on to some positive news and I definitely wanted to mention this at some point towards the top of the show
1356240	1362100	But obviously we have a lot of listeners out there that have been affected by these storms that have been going on around the country
1362740	1369200	You know, obviously there's a lot of focus right now on Irma and what's happening with Florida and we have quite a few listeners in
1369240	1372520	Florida area so of course, you know thinking about you guys, you know
1372520	1376960	I'm talking to some of you on discord and on Twitter and I know everybody's doing what they need to do to stay safe
1376960	1381340	So that's great. But still it's like just one of those like wow, this is really awful
1381340	1387000	but I mean this is right on the heels of what happened in Houston and with with Harvey and
1387640	1393720	Just seeing what happened there is is awful and you know believe it or not here in California in the 90s
1393720	1396840	I lived in a neighborhood that flooded that was pretty bad
1396840	1397720	and so, you know
1397720	1401000	I kind of know what it's like and I'm not gonna say I know exactly what it's like
1401000	1405680	I kind of know what it's like to go through something like that and it sucks like it really really sucks and it's scary
1405680	1407480	and so
1407480	1414640	But most importantly I just hope that everybody that listens to OLR is safe. That's the most important thing. Everything else is stuff
1415760	1419960	Granted some of it is very sentimental stuff, but you know stuff at the end of the day
1420560	1426240	It can be replaced you cannot so yeah, I hope everybody is safe and all that stuff
1426240	1431960	so thinking about you guys and a lot of the gaming community coming together to do some good for support of
1432560	1434920	victims and games done quick
1435520	1439640	Which of course does though what awesome games done quick and they do
1440160	1444200	Summer games don't quick is the other one. They really threw together a fast
1444920	1449120	Marathon and they did it virtually which you know, of course you have to do if it's last-minute
1449120	1452620	But they did a Harvey relief done quick and they raised
1453620	1459060	$225,000 that's almost a quarter of a million dollars for the Houston food bank, which is really cool
1459060	1464740	Houston food bank providing meals cleaning supplies disinfection product products for people that were
1465780	1471020	Affected by Harvey's so really happy to hear about gamers doing that. I'm sad I wasn't able to catch any of it
1471460	1474340	Obviously I was out of town this past weekend, but I heard it was a lot of fun
1474340	1478380	So I didn't even know what's going on. Oh, no, because I would have watched it
1478380	1481220	Well, I'm sure they archived it all and put it on Twitter and all that stuff
1481220	1485740	And yeah, if you still want to donate I'm sure they would not be opposed to that. So check that out
1486500	1488500	All right. So anyhow
1489580	1493100	That was something else. I wanted to bring up at least some good news from the past week
1493100	1496780	So that is that's what's been going on in gaming this past week
1496780	1498940	We will get into this week's headlines
1498940	1504780	But first I want to go around and check in with our hosts and talk a little bit about how was your gaming week?
1504780	1506780	Dark soccer. How was your gaming week? Um
1506780	1508300	Um
1508300	1515620	What did I play I played some pinball I played Simpsons pinball party at a leather bar
1517100	1519100	It was in bad shape
1519500	1521500	I
1523340	1527540	Actually back in Sims 4 I've been looking for houses by
1529740	1536260	Good designers, but maybe not be super famous. Like I'm not doing Frank Lloyd Wright houses. I'm not doing falling water
1536820	1538820	but I'm looking for
1539420	1546860	Contemporary designers like 50s and up and trying to recreate their houses in the Sims and then trap the people inside the walls of said
1546860	1552900	Houses know those people live on like a 20 by 20 lot in a square room that has no toilet. I
1553940	1557820	Want to see and I'm sure it's been done because it's the internet. Of course
1557820	1564420	I want to see someone recreate like the saw houses or saw like facilities and put the Sims in there
1564420	1570140	I'm sure there's some mods or something. I'm sure somebody somewhere has done it or the Winchester Mystery House
1570140	1573420	I'm sure has been done. Yeah, someone's done that if Jamie hasn't done it herself
1573420	1579140	I don't have time for that, but someone else did it for Sims 3 and I had it downloaded for a while
1579140	1584100	I love the Winchester Mystery House though. I've never been do you know that you're fixing this Rob?
1584780	1590580	Underwhelming you think no, it's just it's not tall people friendly cuz miss Winchester was four foot nine
1590980	1596340	For those that don't know it's it's like a two it's one of those tourist attractions in Northern California. It's in San Jose
1596340	1602220	It's like the nutshell. Yeah, mrs. Winchester is the wife of the Winchester gun bang bang
1602220	1608060	Yep, and she thought that she was being haunted by all the ghosts of the people killed by her husband's guns
1608500	1615500	Hired a psychic who said the only way to prevent them from killing you is to never stop construction on the house
1615540	1617600	When construction stops you die
1618600	1621320	Ironically which sounds like a trap and saw
1622320	1629880	But anyway, but there's there's a seance room that has a door that leads to nothing to the outside from the third story
1630400	1633880	There are stairs that go up to the ceiling and go nowhere
1634560	1640420	There's all kinds of weird ghost traps in there and all the stairs because she was very arthritic very old and four foot nine
1640420	1646860	So there's a little teeny like two inch stairs all the way through the house and then her collection of Tiffany lamps
1648040	1649120	so
1649120	1651120	There you go. There's your
1651160	1653800	architectural and crazy person history of the day and
1655360	1658560	You and sorry we were talking about the Sims though before we got
1659160	1664840	But someone took the time to do the full version of the Winchester mystery house
1664840	1668420	The what was it seven stories before the earthquake in?
1669080	1674520	1915 uh-huh wasn't that when that earthquake was with the big San Francisco one. Yeah, six six
1675000	1679320	But yeah before that it had someone like seven or eight stories and now it's like at four yeah
1679960	1685300	So they didn't rebuild all those and I've never been and they've also uncovered now other parts of the house
1685680	1691160	And so I was watching this one person has like different revisions
1691480	1696360	Based on different versions of the house, and then I I forgot and it's so weird too
1696360	1699960	Cuz you think it would be like out in the middle of nowhere. It's right next to a movie theater
1699960	1705360	It's like it is how well I mean movie theater the build-up around there the movie theater wasn't there when she built
1706760	1711920	But it's just so weird to see like you kind of think spooky house on a hill or something like that. No
1713400	1718840	Middle of downtown San Jose practically. Yeah, it's funny when because I went with with Kristen and
1720040	1721720	we did like the
1721720	1727320	The the full tour that took you under the house and everything too and the gardens and all that and then we went to see
1727320	1731900	Pan's Labyrinth fun. I need to do one of the Halloween flashlight tours. I don't even like
1732160	1735440	They do it on Halloween and every Friday the 13th. Ah
1736560	1743720	Okay, but the one we did underground we had to wear hard hats and they did ghost stories. Oh boy
1743880	1745880	Yeah, all right. All right
1745920	1748600	Too spooky for me. I won't even go and see it
1749280	1755400	I'm not gonna go see it because of what I heard that they did with the one minority character in it
1755760	1759780	Hmm Alan really wants to see it cuz he likes scary movies, but I'm just like
1761320	1766440	Brutal. Yeah, I don't wanna do jumpscares. All right. Anyway, let's get back to video games Loki. How was your gaming week?
1766440	1771560	Um, I didn't play a whole ton of stuff. I did play some things. I went back and played Lewis Skyrim and
1772240	1774240	I also played some
1775560	1778640	The Lego movie game which is pretty fun and
1779120	1786080	I also played some more of the office space. I don't clicker game on the phone because
1786680	1788680	It's just on my phone and convenient
1789400	1791400	but yes this week has been
1793200	1794800	Like I
1794800	1800560	Last weekend. I took a trip to the Lego store. I kind of wish I hadn't gone to the legos. Oh, I
1801080	1807300	Bought a nice set is you know large. Let me guess for your kids knows from me
1808060	1812780	No, I bought them their own sets but I I got this set for me I'm not ashamed that
1813620	1819780	You know, I have a buzz it shouldn't be but it's just like it's like diving back into that whole like scene
1819780	1823380	it's like wow, there's a lot of stuff out there, but
1823900	1826820	yeah, and I don't want to go back to the story because it's
1827660	1829500	There come my god
1829500	1834900	And what's the $800 in the Millennium Falcon? Thank God. I'm not a star that big of a Star Wars fan now, however
1835580	1841180	Then then Jago City looks pretty awesome and I'm not fanning Jago either but that's a pretty cool-looking set
1842420	1847620	All right, anything else for your gaming week outside of all that Lego stuff? Uh, no, okay
1848220	1853460	My gaming week, so I'm not a lot of new stuff. I've kind of been going back to stuff
1853460	1856940	I used to play I did a stream earlier this week on no man's sky
1856940	1861820	Which I'd kind of already done a couple weeks ago just kind of re-exploring kind of a lot of the changes
1861860	1866780	So I started another new file from the very beginning on stream because I finally moved my PlayStation 4
1866860	1871140	Into the office where I do the live streaming so I can actually stream from PlayStation 4
1871580	1875380	Which I'm still trying to decide if I'm gonna do tonight or not. I'm on the fence about what I'm gonna stream tonight
1876260	1878260	so yeah, there's that and
1879020	1881700	Yeah, I've been playing PlayStation 4 games in there
1881700	1885780	Otherwise, I've been playing like overwatch fall fancy 14 a lot of the same stuff
1885780	1889300	I also randomly just kind of picked up heroes of the storm again
1890020	1895620	Which I've been playing a lot of versus AI in heroes of the storm to get my little daily quest done
1895700	1900520	So I could save up gold and I saved up 10,000 gold this past week and I bought diva
1901140	1906060	Character for who's of course one of the big overwatch characters who was recently not that long ago
1906060	1908700	Probably about a month or two ago put into heroes of the storm
1908700	1911640	So I actually bought her so I could use her in play
1911700	1919240	But I haven't really done a lot of player versus player just because I still feel like I'm I'm understanding the here's my thing
1919240	1923040	With heroes of the storm and and a lot of MOBAs where I where I hit a wall in general
1923040	1923760	I
1923760	1929880	Understand kind of like the general rules how to play what to do what not to do and I kind of generally understand the operation
1929880	1930680	my character
1930680	1935960	What I'm still learning about that makes it very hard and I think to put my foot into the player versus player is that I'm not
1935960	1941160	Familiar enough with what all the other players do because you know in a game like here's the storm
1941160	1946040	There's like 40 different people you can pick from and I know the moves for the five or six ones that I like to play
1946120	1948400	But then I'll be playing against somebody and I'm like, whoa
1948400	1951400	He just did a move where he like froze me in place from across the battlefield
1951440	1954520	How did that happen, you know, and I'm still kind of like learning about all that
1954520	1958680	So I don't know when it's safe to you know, like Yolo and run in there
1958680	1960760	And I don't know when I got a hold back. So there's a lot of that stuff
1960760	1962760	I'm still learning about and you know when you get into
1962800	1966880	When you get into some of the competitive stuff people get a lot more heated if you don't know your stuff
1966880	1970040	so I've just been a little little sheepish and getting in there, but
1970600	1975480	I'm gonna find somebody who plays a lot more than I do to take me under their wing and go maybe a
1975720	1977840	Grandpa from courthouse plays a lot of heroes of the storm
1977840	1982300	I don't know if you guys know but he's like level 400 probably so I'm gonna try to get him to
1982400	1984400	take me into some matches and
1984840	1987640	Check it out and play a little more of that. So that's
1988280	1989560	that's
1989560	1992440	You know pretty much a game that I've been playing quite a bit of this week
1992600	1995280	But yeah, not really otherwise not a lot of new stuff
1995280	2001720	I mean when I went to Dragon Con I played like enough Splatoon to have participated in the Splatfest
2001800	2003800	Which we ended up losing anyway
2003880	2007000	But at least the theme was better than the catch-up mayo thing
2007000	2011960	At least this the invisibility of flight was like, okay flight one and that's not the team I picked
2011960	2013960	But at least I'm not like offended by that
2014760	2016000	Let's see
2016000	2020780	and then I got to play some of the cool arcade stuff that they had Dragon Con cuz you know they get they have Tokyo
2020780	2027100	Attack was there who brings a lot of Japanese and import arcade machines to conventions and then they have like a classic bar
2027420	2030140	In the area brought in some classic arcade machines
2030140	2033420	So I was able to play some of those too. Are they supposed to be bringing the table flipping game in there?
2033460	2036380	Yeah, they had two at the table flipping game at Dragon Con. Yeah, it was cool
2036380	2041120	I I never got around to playing that I was playing neon FM because it's the first time I'd seen a neon FM
2041240	2047000	Neon FM that had Korean songs in it and I was like what so I had to play, you know, like mr
2047000	2050000	Simple and some of the songs that I recognized, you know from what kpop
2050000	2054720	I've been exposed to I had to play that stuff because I thought it was awesome that that was in neon FM
2054720	2061760	So I hope that's in all the machines and not just the ones the Tokyo attack is moving around cuz I want to play all
2061760	2064060	Those songs cuz yeah kpop is awesome
2065520	2070560	What else I want to say, oh the classic arcade I will say this the classic arcade the the joystick bar
2070560	2075280	I think it was called that brought these games in they had a Donkey Kong remix
2075680	2078480	Machine and the Donkey Kong jr. Remix machine
2078480	2082920	I didn't get to play jr. Somebody else is on that but I played Donkey Kong remix and basically
2082920	2086720	I mean it feels like it's just a ROM hack basically of the original Donkey Kong
2086720	2093480	But like with modified levels basically and it's it's flippin hard. I couldn't even get past like halfway
2093480	2095720	You know, the first board is like climbing up
2096880	2100760	You know the rafters and ladder I couldn't even get like halfway through that board
2100760	2102200	I guess I'm not a real gamer
2102240	2107200	But I couldn't even get like halfway through that board like it was crazy hard, so
2107960	2111480	Yeah, so Donkey Kong remix means Donkey Kong hard as hell
2112080	2116560	Basically, that's all about so but it was it was cool to have played one kaizo kong
2118440	2122320	That would be a good alternate name for it, but that's uh, yeah, that's what it is
2123200	2125160	All right. Anyhow, uh
2125160	2128240	Let's see going to our chat over at live dot vog network comm act
2128240	2133720	Def says that diva got introduced in heroes of the storm when the officer diva skin got introduced into overwatch
2133720	2139000	Oh, that was a few months ago. I guess I've just been kind of out of it. Oh, yeah, Bobby Blackwolf reminds me
2139000	2141000	We did play pac-man vs
2141400	2146560	Because he has the Namco thing on the switch and then I downloaded that app that lets you play
2146880	2150880	Pac-man vs. So we played that on the switch. That was fun. I like that. That was a good party game
2150880	2152760	So, I mean, it's a bummer
2152760	2157260	We didn't get to play it with more people because it was just Bobby and I and then like two computer ghosts
2157340	2163660	So wasn't as thrilling as I'm sure a room full of people is but we had fun. It was a fun game. So
2164180	2165860	alright
2165860	2168420	We're gonna move on to some other
2169340	2173420	Announcements such as please follow us on twitter twitter.com slash olr
2173420	2178640	We're also on facebook at orange lounge radio as far as upcoming shows off. I can't think of any
2178640	2180520	I think we're gonna be here for the foreseeable future
2180520	2184140	We'll probably take something off around the holiday, but no more conventions or anything like that
2184660	2189780	Sadly I'm not I'm not even gonna go to magfest this next year sadly, and it's nothing against magfest. They're great
2189780	2191780	I just go to dragcon with me next year. I
2192260	2194340	I'd love to actually go to that at some point
2194340	2197660	I just I have no more time off work after everything that happened over the summer
2197660	2200060	I burned all my time off. So I have to make some cutbacks
2200060	2204060	I had to take the time off to go to drag gun con had to take that unpaid
2204380	2208940	So but it was worth it. It was totally worth it. I'm quitting Wow, you're quitting Wow
2209140	2213500	Yeah, no one plays anymore and it's it's true not fun playing by myself
2213500	2218140	Oh, well, what about what about trying to find a new posse to play with like, yeah
2218140	2223260	I bet there's some great like like-minded gamers out there. Like well, here's the bummer
2223260	2229940	I would say talk to the ladies from girls gone Wow, right like raven each other server. They would what's that international?
2229940	2231980	They don't have an international server. That's the problem
2231980	2236260	They don't have an international server because I bet those ladies would love to have super like flying around though
2237180	2243340	If Final Fantasy 14 had flying around and not shitty, you know leveling system then I would go back
2243340	2246020	You do have flying around in the later areas
2246020	2250940	You know, you don't have jumping off of things and extending wings and getting into places. You're not supposed to go
2253220	2256360	You do have jumping off of things with your wings in the later areas
2256360	2259120	You have to get in heaven's ward, but you could do it, but it's your wings
2259700	2266220	Yeah, you get a you get mounts that fly. I don't want a flying mount. I want like demon hunter powers
2266220	2267540	Oh
2267540	2273020	That type of demon hunters are fucking fun. No, then no, you don't have that in in file man
2273020	2279320	Demon hunters are fucking fun. You need to I know you don't like first-person shooters, but in overwatch
2280080	2284420	Mercy made me nauseously sick. Oh, that's a bummer because Mercy's getting a new ability
2284420	2287860	It's gonna let her fly around anywhere and it's fun to play with and go to places
2287860	2292420	You're not supposed to go to on the political show. So not nauseously sick. That's a bummer. Sorry to hear that
2293220	2296120	They should consider a third-person mode that might help with that
2296620	2302140	If it was third person, I could probably have no problem playing it see and it would I wouldn't think it would be that hard
2302140	2305100	To implement because you can spectate other people
2305620	2310860	Maybe or maybe there is a way to do it and I just don't know maybe our chatters know over at live dot vog network
2311180	2312340	calm
2312340	2317580	Let's see. I'm also looking at our chat. Oh, I remembered what other games we played
2317580	2321700	Go ahead before we get into news we played we put we broke out the Neo Geo. Oh
2322380	2325300	Yeah, I saw some your picture played summer. I should own two
2325300	2329720	well ours is a Japanese once the summer my spirits to and the first summer I show down and
2330460	2332460	I think some magician Lord
2332500	2339500	So we played the Neo Geo with the huge cartridges the size of someone's head at least a small child's head
2342260	2346580	About a little bigger than a baby a little bigger than a baby. All right
2347580	2353060	Let's get into some gaming news and I'm gonna there's there's a lot of controversial stuff this week guys
2353060	2356380	I I I guess this was the week where everything blew up
2356380	2363380	So brace yourselves, but we're gonna be we're gonna be tactful as we dive into the controversy tonight starting with this whopper, right?
2363380	2366620	Logie, so South Park factory hole is gonna be coming out
2366620	2369920	I'm thinking next year now and so they've been doing some like kind of gaming
2370060	2374860	It's actually in six weeks. If I if I remember I'd it's like six like end of October in it. I got delayed
2374860	2376860	No, I thought I got delayed
2377060	2381660	My will look into that just so we are accurate, but I thought I thought it had been delayed to this one
2381660	2385260	I was looking forward to oh, maybe maybe I'm thinking that I don't know
2385260	2391140	I know it's one I was looking forward to so maybe hopefully it's coming out soon, but it is yeah worldwide October 17th
2391140	2394520	That's what I thought. Hey, you're getting yeah, you got confused because it was delayed
2396420	2398420	It wouldn't be surprised if it's
2399220	2402140	That's fair. It's fair. But yes, it's so
2402740	2404620	Should be coming out soon and
2404620	2409420	Of course, they're doing you know with that the whole media blitzing where their gameplay previews and stuff
2409420	2414180	and so one of the very beginning parts of the game is creating your character and so like
2414580	2420620	Unlike actually the first South Park game you can actually play as a girl or even a transgendered person in this one
2420740	2427420	But there is a portion of the game where it's asking me to pick your skin color and it says with that, you know
2428100	2430660	it's also your game difficulty and
2431140	2435740	With Cartman says he actually makes a comment. Don't worry. This doesn't actually affect combat
2435740	2439660	It's just every other aspect of your whole life, which I think is kind of funny
2440220	2445140	So actually a pretty good commentary it to be crystal clear the easy mode
2445140	2448740	You have light skin the difficult mode. You have dark skin now
2449900	2456180	basically, it's gonna be it's gonna the way that's gonna work is it's a the amount of money that you get from
2456620	2461560	You know different events and also how characters treat you in the game so
2462260	2466220	There could be some hilarious, you know South Park stuff, you know with the police
2466220	2473620	I'm sure you know like the whole Michael Jackson episode. Mmm. Well, you know, go ahead Darcyra. I honestly think that it's
2475980	2481020	Not in there to be crass per se but it's in there as part of I think
2481500	2488060	Commentary on current society, but they're also though. I mean they also have it in there where you can be a
2488980	2490980	transgender character
2492100	2495820	Yeah, after picking your skin color you meet with mr. Mackey who?
2497220	2499220	okay about your
2499980	2507380	Gender identification so that includes male female or other and then even after choosing one of those you can choose specify if your cisgender or
2507580	2512780	Transgender and I guess he like if he calls your parents to confirm all that stuff as well
2513180	2518380	Because there's they kind of played back to the joke, you know, cuz the original game all you could be is a boy in there
2518380	2524380	Yeah, and so like that's so weird. You know, we thought this whole time that you were a boy. I mean
2525300	2532660	It's just like kind of funny. Okay. Okay. I watched the scene where a person picked a cisgender female
2532780	2536200	It's like you mean you knew she was a girl the whole time
2537000	2538880	Yes
2538880	2540880	Okay
2540920	2544720	It was pretty funny so so here's the thing, you know what I got
2544720	2548520	I'm gonna admit my gut reaction when I saw that whole like difficulty slider thing
2548520	2552560	I was like, wow, that's fucked up. But then I was like, it's really fucked up in real life, too
2552560	2560880	So that was that was pretty much my reaction to that, you know South Park doesn't really shy away from that type of stuff
2560880	2565400	But and let me go to our chat over at live dot vog network comm cuz that guys you don't in our chat see
2565720	2570840	Here's here's the part where I'm having difficulty because I I'm not black neither is Loki neither is darsakha
2570840	2574040	But I know many of you we have many different colors out there that listen to the show, which is awesome
2574600	2580920	And Kai's you don't in chat says I'm black and I find that hilarious and true. What's the controversy?
2581520	2584320	Well from what you know because I haven't said a lot on this
2584320	2586760	I've just been trying to read what other people have to say on this
2587080	2591560	Some of what I'm seeing on Twitter from people of color just some of what I've seen, you know
2591560	2594400	retweeted in my timeline and stuff some of the negative I'm seeing is that
2594920	2600280	My or the the life experiences and I'm gonna try to summarize best I can here
2600280	2601600	So, I'm sorry if I'm misrepresenting it
2601600	2605920	But the life experiences and the things that I've gone through are not a joke
2606080	2611920	Like this is not something to be belittled by a game type of thing. I don't know that it's in there is a joke
2612480	2614400	But like even if it is a joke
2614400	2618160	I don't think yeah, I get it that you're offended by it and great
2618160	2621320	You can be offended by that but they make fun of everything
2622040	2626320	Everything everybody everything is a joke everything. So
2627080	2632560	Yeah, you'll be you'll be offended by this thing and then the next thing they do someone else is gonna be offended by that
2632560	2636040	It's I mean what they had abortion jokes in the last game
2636040	2640880	I mean, there's all sorts of I'm offended that sixth graders are bad guys
2641280	2646720	There's all sorts of like jokes that are it's it's offensive and yes, it's okay to be offended
2646720	2650760	It's not okay for you to expect them to change the game because you're offended by it
2650760	2652040	I think you know
2652040	2657380	It's it for me and you know kind of trying to think about this and process those sort of responses and try to weigh
2657380	2660400	Like, you know the the negatives that I am hearing as well
2660400	2663940	It's like the positives from people of color that like, you know, like I should have just said in chat
2663940	2666880	Like what's the problem? This is you know funny or whatever
2667480	2668680	so
2668680	2673080	And when I come in turn away with that is that it kind of goes back to in my mind this whole video games are
2673080	2676840	Art type of thing right and we've you know speaking of controversy
2676840	2681080	That's been one of the age-old controversy in the video game community our video games art
2681360	2684480	Well art is meant to provoke response
2684720	2691040	So I would say in some ways, you know, he did this whole conversation that's happening right now is
2691640	2694140	In a way and some people are gonna you know
2694140	2698280	But but this is just honestly where my gut my gut is is going with this is that this whole conversation?
2698280	2703560	We're having right now just kind of proves the fact that video games are art and the art may not be making a statement
2703560	2709560	That you like but it's making a statement and it is a reflection on an art is a reflection on culture and it is
2710200	2716460	Definitely a reflection on culture be it very a very sassy one, but it's you know, there's a lot of
2717240	2723860	Serious fucking shit out there and reasons why there's things that exist like Black Lives Matter and so forth and to an extent
2723860	2727080	I wonder why some people get offended
2727800	2734960	About things that don't necessarily affect them. Does that make sense? Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah
2736160	2741260	Call like I see it. I see all the time on tumblr all the time on tumblr not to say everybody on tumblr is bad
2741260	2745760	That's not what I'm saying. But you get you get that stuff. We're like, um, what was that post?
2745760	2751320	Oh some post that made its way onto like a Facebook screen cap where somebody
2752160	2758140	Retweeted a picture of a little girl doing a Japanese tea ceremony and one tumblr user was like
2758480	2763420	This is so effed up and it's cultural appropriation to the dot and then a person in Japan
2763840	2770480	Responded to that saying actually we we love it type of thing kind of kind of similar with the Mexico and Mario
2771480	2774500	Odyssey thing with a sombrero. It's like actually we kind of like it
2774500	2780440	I will rather go on a limb and say though that there is a very very very long history
2780520	2782520	of
2782720	2784160	Japanese culture
2784160	2788720	Adopting things from surrounding areas and making it something uniquely Japanese
2789040	2795220	So I would think that seeing other countries do that may not be such a big deal, you know
2797920	2802320	That being said what offended me is that number one the kimono was wrong
2803640	2805640	It was done wrong
2806000	2809560	All right, I'm gonna go to our chat because I do I was trying to make a joke
2810440	2814200	I wasn't sure dark Sakura some things. I don't know. All right
2814920	2820480	In in our chat over at live dog network calm Bobby black wolf says this and I think that this is a fair response
2820720	2827760	by black wolf says controversy is this a black person who wants to play a character that looks like them has to either deal with
2827760	2831600	The harder difficulty or play someone who doesn't look like them
2831800	2838720	That's why some people are upset but it's not everything like to say it's it's just like money payouts in the game
2838720	2840720	Yes, I get that. Yeah, I
2841040	2845960	Kind of annoying it would be it would be nice if maybe after they make the point
2845960	2850200	Then there's like something where it's like press square to change, you know
2850200	2856020	So, you know, maybe maybe like after they make their point you can actually because I know the combat you can tweak how difficult the combat
2856020	2860080	Is yeah, like you can make that easier or harder depending on and you can keep change that throughout the game
2860080	2865200	Yeah, so and I don't know like honestly playing the game but like last time with the money and stuff
2865200	2870320	I don't think you ever run into a problem with it's probably just gonna be very minor. Mm-hmm
2870320	2877200	It's just more of like ha ha it's like a silly thing that we did some of the controversial some of the one
2877560	2883160	Positive I was gonna mention is they mentioned that the game is not gonna be censored in any country
2883840	2889640	Unlike it was last time Oh with the whole anal probing stuff. They're not gonna censor it. I'm in a country
2889640	2894860	So Australia is probably not gonna sell it. So it's gonna be exactly, you know as it is in all countries
2895320	2900500	Much love to our Australian listeners, but you know that they there's games that get censored there all the time
2900500	2907960	So anyway, Mortal Kombat and all that. All right. Anyway, I also would like to go out on a limb if I may
2907960	2910200	Yeah, where people talk about
2913120	2918740	Issues of appropriation and things like that and trying to like in the case of the game, you know
2918920	2924480	Taking something that's going on in real life and making it an undisputable undeniable factor
2924520	2927400	I think the thing that people need to realize is that
2928920	2934160	I'm trying to figure out how to say this the right way sure that everyone is gonna borrow from everybody
2934600	2938400	That's the whole point of having multiple cultures in one place
2938400	2941880	Yeah, when you live in a melting pot like America things are going to melt
2943040	2948740	You know and and yes, I realize there's a lot going on on a much higher level and stuff that you know
2948740	2951600	Makes you wonder sometimes if America really is a melting pot
2951600	2955600	But I think there's a lot of us that love that part about America
2955600	2959040	Well as a share 100 Matt makes a good phrase in here in the last game
2959040	2963980	You could pick a Jew class it changed the way the game was played. You also got different payouts and story and stuff
2964800	2968440	Hi. Yeah, you know, um, I
2969440	2973880	Think that maybe we might need a little bit more of these things
2974380	2979160	desensitizing people a little bit, you know bringing those things to light instead of putting it in a
2979520	2985260	Convenient package that we can get offended about for five seconds argue on the internet and then
2985680	2993080	Conveniently put aside in our lives, you know, I think that's the big thing is that we are so enamored with that moment of
2993720	2996940	Being the right one being right being right, you know
2997680	2999680	that after a while
3000760	3007320	It becomes the focus instead of actually going out there and doing good. So I'm glad it's in the game
3007360	3012080	I'm glad it's bringing attention to things that people should be talking about instead of just putting on the back burner
3012480	3018360	All right, and you know what? I invite other responses out there too. Like I said, I think on a topic like this
3018360	3022600	I'm just kind of trying to listen to the different perspectives and you know interpret the art that way
3022600	3026240	So I certainly invite all the feedback if you don't feel like your point was represented here tonight
3026800	3030640	Participate at orange lounge radio comm come on up to the table. Like I said earlier
3030640	3034840	It's a big diner table and let's hear from all those different perspectives in the meantime, though
3034840	3037900	I'd like to move on with some more gaming news because it is only a three-hour show
3038040	3041920	so let's talk about something going on on the Nintendo switch and
3042520	3047620	This is controversial in a much different way, but literally a gaming controversy really
3048000	3049560	Here's the deal is that you know
3049560	3054720	I think a lot of people were drawn to the whole cartridge idea of the switch because oh well
3054720	3056040	Then I'm not gonna really you know
3056040	3056800	It's okay
3056800	3062600	if there's only 32 gigs of storage or whatever it is on the switch because I can get stuff on cartridges and it's not really
3062600	3067000	Taking a memory and you know, it's it's different right when you had an old-school Super Nintendo
3067040	3071560	You didn't have to have a cartridge based or I mean you didn't have to have any type of like on
3071720	3074920	Board storage or anything like that, right? So anyhow, um
3075920	3077000	Excuse me
3077000	3082240	Well, it turns out that may not be the case and I want to thank our discord for submitting this to us if you want
3082240	3089000	To join our discord server and bounce us ideas throughout the week. You can vog network comm slash discord will get you an invite
3089000	3089800	It's an open server
3089800	3094320	I think it was dungeon buster that submitted this and I'm sorry if I if I get this wrong
3094880	3096640	so anyway
3096640	3103080	In the future some switch games are going to require you to actually own a micro SD card in order to play
3104000	3110560	NBA 2k 18 is going to be the first game that's gonna require that additional storage to be present
3110640	3116200	So yep, you can't actually fit all of 2k NBA 2k 18 onto just the cartridge
3116400	3122320	You're gonna have to actually install some of it to the extra micro SD card your storage card now
3122320	3126260	Here's the deal a portion of the title will be available outside the box
3126640	3132120	But you I guess slowly download the rest of it while you're actually playing
3132920	3136840	Representative for Nintendo of America actually said in a quote that yes
3136840	3140520	a micro SD card will be needed for certain Nintendo switch games that contain an
3140880	3145920	Especially large amount of content and require additional storage for players to enjoy the full experience
3145920	3150280	If you purchase a physical version of a game that requires an additional micro SD memory card
3150280	3155600	You'll be able to play a portion of the game right out of the box specific levels or mode to enjoy the full game
3156160	3158680	Downloading additional data is required. So
3159400	3162360	Apparently cartridges won't hold the whole game sometime
3162360	3166640	I'm sure they would but they just have to have to pay for more expensive cartridges that hold more data
3167000	3170680	God forbid we do that because then that would cut into our margin
3171560	3172760	Yeah
3172760	3174980	maybe this optical media stuff was
3176120	3179260	Maybe that's why they do it because it's so fucking cheap
3180240	3182240	could
3182400	3190120	G why is the whole industry doing that? I don't fucking know why well, but to be fair in a portable environment
3190120	3196600	I mean it worked. All right on the PSP, I guess but maybe optimal reading and stuff isn't I mean even the Vita used cartridges
3196600	3198600	for a reason so maybe
3198800	3204440	Optical discs and things weren't really the best in a portable environment. I mean, I guess the PSP worked
3204440	3208920	Okay, but I'm sure even it had its limitations and you could make it skip if you shook it hard enough
3208920	3212100	You know, I mean, so it's never I'm just saying low key in that regard
3212840	3219880	I'm not saying that those I don't think we're that easy to duplicate as well. Well, here's what here's what it is
3219880	3221520	Loki, let's be right. Here's what it is
3221600	3229040	This is more a commentary on the fact that Nintendo's default out-of-the-box on storage space is way too small
3229600	3236160	Exactly. That's that's the real problem. Was it 32 gigs? Uh-huh, cuz 32 gigs with fucking too small in the Wii U
3236160	3242760	No, it's still fucking too small with this shit if that's just ridiculous, but but never fear Loki
3242760	3247520	they'll be the 2018 model of the switch that comes in neon red and
3248200	3251800	Fluorescent green and it comes with 128 gigs of storage fuck
3251800	3256240	No, it'll come with like 64 gigabytes of storage or like 48 gigabytes or something stupid
3257240	3264200	Now SSG 100 Matt kind of thrown it back a little bit saying I remember sports games dating back to the Dreamcast days
3264760	3271240	Required that you played with a memory card. You wouldn't be able to continue without having a memory card inserted
3271480	3272840	Well, I
3272840	3278420	Mean you missed a lot on the Dreamcast without those awesome little VM you things which by the way
3278420	3283380	Happy birthday Dreamcast because yesterday nine nine, you know all the way back to nine nine ninety nine was the Dreamcast birthday
3283600	3287320	But you would miss out on stuff without those little VM use
3288280	3290240	Well, it's also I think that was more of like
3290240	3294680	Cashy and stuff because that was the only storage that there was on that system. So it was I
3295680	3300440	Kind of always felt we had Tamagotchi to thank a little bit for that that it was kind of
3300800	3304000	Dark sacrifice just gave me the biggest no face in the world
3304000	3310360	But I kind of feel like that was in a way from that, you know, no you don't agree. Not at all
3310360	3313820	All right. What's your take on it? I think that they wanted
3315000	3319040	Something that was gonna make the system more unique and offer a more interactive type of play
3319040	3325300	Mm-hmm. I mean cuz things like that had existed for years. Anyway having the little you know digital toys
3325300	3328320	I mean if you want to go really I
3328740	3332120	Would probably put the origin more in those little tiger toys or
3332840	3334640	the game and watch
3334640	3335840	so
3335840	3339920	We're looking much further back and Akuma JP correcting my pronunciation
3340840	3347320	Tamagotchi, I think I think we got spoiled here in the USA in Tamagotchi not not because the whole like stupid American thing
3347320	3351240	But like gotcha was really ingrained in the culture with Pokemon and all that stuff
3351240	3354240	So I think a lot of people would say gotcha as opposed like, you know
3354240	3358080	Cuz that's that's what we kind of knew with Pokemon. Anyway, I'm just excusing my ignorance. Sorry
3358480	3365400	But Tamagotchi and it's so you know what the name it's it would be a portmanteau Tamago for egg and
3368240	3371200	Now my brain just forgot Chi Tamado Chi Oh
3372120	3374040	Doesn't friend. Oh
3374040	3377960	Okay, it's an egg friend. Okay, see I didn't but I actually didn't know that
3377960	3382480	Okay, and I'm sure that they had no idea from the get-go that this would be an issue
3382480	3385720	And that's why it's never been mentioned up until this point
3386720	3391960	That this was gonna be a necessity. It's funny how after everyone's purchases systems it. Oh by the way
3393200	3400240	This isn't gonna work exactly how you thought. Oh and this oh and that oh and that one other thing, too
3401320	3404640	Yeah, have you heard some of the rumors about Nintendo having I know this isn't on the show world
3404640	3408000	I've heard some of the rumors about Nintendo having a direct this week. Have you seen some of that?
3408000	3410760	I don't fucking care cuz Apple's doing a thing this week
3410760	3413000	So, you know where Apple goes Nintendo missed
3413000	3417800	They're gonna blow them on stage because I mean seriously I don't care this point well actually actually
3418720	3420040	Don't count it out
3420040	3423840	Nintendo has shown up on the Apple stage before when they did Super Mario run and we know
3424000	3427080	Nintendo's cooking a Zelda game in an Animal Crossing game
3427320	3434200	So it is possible that Nintendo could come out and blow to fully look forward to that Zelda game
3434200	3440400	I'm sure that's gonna be fucking don't knock it. They tried it. No. Yeah. I'm not saying that's not it's not possible for them
3440400	3443680	To do is all the game like that cuz like I said, you know the DS games the DS
3443680	3447320	All the games were pretty good and you could do those with mostly just the touch screen
3447320	3449320	So it had a good control system for that
3449960	3454120	However, I feel that they're gonna be tempted by the current, you know
3454120	3459920	Mobile game scene and you're gonna get like a tapper game or some shit like that. It's gonna be like well
3460000	3466800	That's not what I wanted but I would rather they give us a tapper game then try to bring breath of the wild
3467120	3471480	To the phone cuz like you're not gonna be able to control that with a phone. I'm sorry
3471480	3476780	I would rather it just be a fucking tapper game if that's you know, wrote the phone to throw the boomerang
3477720	3482280	All right, but okay. Look we're getting away from the point. So Apple's doing a thing on Tuesday
3482280	3484200	We all know they're expected to announce phones
3484200	3485480	That's what all the rumors say
3485480	3489000	Which is good news for me because I'm ready to upgrade from my six
3489000	3490800	So I eagerly anticipate what they're gonna say
3490840	3494240	But anyway Nintendo is rumored to do one on Wednesday
3494320	3500000	now some people are kind of taking the ball and running with it and saying oh, this is when they're gonna announce Netflix and
3500560	3505400	All the other things that we've been waiting for we're bringing Netflix to consoles for the first time ever
3506280	3511080	It's never been done ever before. Well, okay. Well on this console
3512040	3518120	Loki you joke but Nintendo and I've said this before on the show because and when we went back to
3518600	3522360	Is it a big deal that Netflix is on it or not? I said this in the beginning
3522360	3523560	I think yes
3523560	3528040	Nintendo can make a huge argument that with certain Netflix shows because you know
3528040	3530320	You can download a good chunk of Netflix library, right?
3530440	3534080	You can start watching it on TV and then oh I got to make the bus
3534560	3540280	click a little snap and I'm gonna pick it up and watch it on the go and continue my Netflix without an internet connection because
3540280	3546080	It's been downloading in the background as I'm watching it. Like yes, Nintendo could say this is an experience
3546080	3548080	You can't really do right now
3548200	3551480	Except on my phone that I have in my pocket that I can do the exact
3552720	3556640	You know the whole pick it up and go, you know, there's a twist to it
3556640	3562240	But my phone certainly doesn't have 32 gigabytes worth of storage. I mean, it's just a phone
3562240	3565480	You can't possibly fit that much data into a phone. It's
3566000	3568400	Clearly this console is the only thing could do that
3569760	3576280	It's just how about how are you just instead of fucking announcing Netflix, which really should have been there from the get-go
3576440	3582280	How do we announce all the fucking shit that also should have been there from the get-go console virtual console a
3583080	3588840	Web browser does that thing even fucking have a web browser? Yes. Okay. How do you think the e-shop works?
3589800	3593120	Yes, but can you actually use a web browser on it?
3593320	3598640	My understanding is it's been hacked because the e-shop or no the the network
3598640	3598840	Okay
3598840	3605680	The network thing has okay cuz like when I okay when I wanted to log into the Wi-Fi at the hotel during dragoncon
3605720	3612440	To do Splatfest it actually because the hotel Wi-Fi you have to log into that right because you have to put in either the passphrase
3612440	3615360	Or your last name and your room number to use hotel Wi-Fi, right?
3615480	3617800	So believe it or not you try to connect to the network
3617800	3622360	The switch is smart enough which not all game systems the password smart enough
3622360	3625880	It pops up a browser window and it has the Hyatt's little screen
3626120	3630680	Please put in your information that it added and all that and then it closes it and you're connected to the internet
3630680	3631240	So yes
3631240	3634400	there is a web browser and my understanding is people have kind of backdoored that because
3634480	3640160	What you do is you use that same trick except the web page that you put on your personal network that you present is
3640760	3644400	Whatever website you're really trying to get on the switch, which could be a flash game, you know
3644400	3648840	I don't know if it's flash game, but you know, like games or something something else. So that's
3649360	3653420	Okay, so it doesn't have a web browser that you can just click an icon and it works
3653420	3659200	Okay. No, but there is it is is there a web browser in there? Yes. Can you use it? Not really that's
3660200	3662580	Fucking makes sense that makes all the sense of the world
3665200	3671320	Fucking hell, I swear whatever. You know what SSJ 100 Matt says, can you use the web browser for porn?
3671320	3676440	I'm asking for a friend. All right, of course if you if you see me real, let's be real
3677600	3679560	Nintendo needs to just have the real talk
3679560	3684520	All right, Nintendo needs to have the real talk and give the gamers what they really want. All right, here's what needs to happen
3686000	3687360	Excuse me
3687360	3690720	Reggie fees and may needs to do a special 10 o'clock at night in Nintendo Direct
3690720	3694400	Okay, he's gonna come out on this Nintendo Direct and say listen guys. I
3695120	3697400	Know what it is. You really want out of your web browser
3697400	3702920	I know what it really what it is. You really want out of your consoles. We're gonna give you all the porn you want
3703640	3711460	And here's is the web browser. Yes, the Nintendo switch what you do. It's gonna it's gonna jack into sites such as
3712960	3717800	Porn hub. Okay the new porn hub app for the Nintendo switch so you can start new me verse
3717840	3720160	But it's you can start watching ever
3720160	3725200	Yeah, you the wee wee verse so you can start watching pornography on the big screen
3725320	3728200	But then when you hear the garage door open that somebody's coming home
3728200	3733000	Just take it off the and take it back into your bedroom and finish what you started. I
3733640	3736160	Got you guys love Reggie fees and may
3737000	3744400	But in order to have a separate would sell billions. You'd have a separate phone app and fucking like all the tethering cables possible
3744400	3746160	They
3746160	3748160	Would still find a way to fuck that up
3749080	3751740	They would still find a way I know but seriously though like
3753600	3758600	JD and chat says so Rob phones plus a Chromecast can pretty much already do this
3759480	3764240	Well, you know what? Some people are gonna do it just because it's Nintendo. Let's be real
3765080	3772840	Now we're cutting work cutting edge with you know, the 3d technology because you could view 3d porn on the 3ds
3772840	3775600	Which is kind of cool. Yes. Yes, you could I mean granted
3775600	3782240	It was just very low-res pictures in 3d, but it was 3d. I think I saw a blurry tit
3783640	3785580	Kind of poked out. Yeah a little bit
3785580	3786520	But no, seriously
3786520	3791640	They just need to announce what the hell their fucking virtual console plans are because right now when the hell is that launching do we even?
3791640	3794720	No, no, and I was again again
3794720	3801640	I I am ready to accept the fact that virtual console my quote II fingers this time around is gamecube games and
3802640	3804760	Maybe Nintendo Wii and Wii U stuff
3804880	3811640	That's mostly just fucking make a stupid like fuck this NES classic bullshit
3811640	3816120	And he has caught you know, the super NES classic just make a virtual console
3816520	3823200	Done you plug it in your TV download all that shit. That's basically what it is. Anyway, here's here's what really okay
3823200	3827640	So we've been talking for like five minutes about a rumored Nintendo Direct. We don't even know if it's happening or not
3827960	3833240	Here's the thing guys lower them expectations lower them y'all cuz Mario Odyssey
3833240	3837160	They got to get the pre-orders in for that. So I would bet if they're having a direct it's an expanded
3837160	3841440	Look at Mario Odyssey. Oh, it's gonna be there fucking amiibo. There's a Metroid game out on Friday
3841440	3845160	Did you hear so maybe it's gonna be an extended look at the new Metroid game, which by the way
3845160	3847600	I think you all would want to know I
3848680	3855120	Pre-ordered that Samus 3dsx. Yeah, you said no you ordered it. I ordered it and already gave them money. Yes
3855120	3857120	All
3857120	3863780	Right, anyhow, I just gave up my best smartass smile. Yeah, I see that a lot from you. All right, let's move on dark soccer
3863780	3867800	Why don't you why don't you give us a story then and I'll be a smartass to you speaking of
3868480	3869560	other
3869560	3876080	Unnecessary prefixes. I'm only going to use the word once and then I will no longer use it so that you know what I'm referring to
3877360	3882740	Microtransactions because they are a transaction. You don't need to quantify them with how big they are
3883580	3888780	If I buy penny candy, is that a micro transaction? No, but I'm only spending pennies
3889420	3890580	No
3890580	3892580	That is just a transaction
3892740	3895740	Okay, transactions are not necessarily quantifiable
3897820	3904980	Except by the actual amount that you've spent on it anyway, so destiny fans are pissed. What else is new?
3907180	3909780	They brought about this
3910460	3917100	You know in-game stuff that you could buy for the original destiny and so they're bringing it back for destiny, too
3917100	3919100	But this one is even
3919340	3924780	Worse, I think they're selling shaders that you can change the color of your armor
3925580	3926740	and
3926740	3928740	then
3928920	3934660	One I mean in the original game when the shaders were unlocked you could have them across all of your characters and
3934860	3941260	Then delete them and pick them up later, but in destiny two shaders are one-time use they're consumable
3941260	3944000	You would be spending money for a consumable
3944700	3950780	That you will never have access to again real money for shit. You can't use again. I
3951460	3953460	Will leave that there
3956420	3960860	The only way you'd ever be able to get another one is either with like a blind loot box
3961860	3964820	Again that you can get with real money
3965780	3968980	Or buy them straight up. So yeah
3969900	3971500	stupid and
3971500	3975460	There are people who love to make their armor look certain ways. They would be buying it
3977020	3982780	You can I mean you can earn them through leveling and chests and whatnot, but yeah people
3984420	3990020	It's well, it's it's also the fact that in the first game it operated a lot differently than it does in this game
3990020	3995920	That's that's what's really cheese and people it sounds like now granted. I haven't played destiny 2 yet
3996500	3999640	I've been hearing actually outside of this controversy
3999640	4002980	I'm hearing a lot of good things about destiny 2 and I'm really excited to check it out
4002980	4008380	My only issue is that I I've already decided I want to get it on PC so I can keyboard and mouse it up
4008380	4014940	But the PC release is a few weeks away. It's the end of October. Mm-hmm. So hmm. No destiny for me
4015260	4018220	Excuse me yet. I did I did play I didn't talk about in my game
4018220	4022000	I played like 20 minutes of the beta on PC because you know
4022000	4026140	The PC beta was like the night before my flight to Dragon Con at 6 in the morning
4026420	4032220	So I played like 20 I downloaded like 14 gigs to play for 20 minutes and I did enjoy my 20 minutes with destiny 2
4032780	4034780	also, I have to say that I
4035740	4038700	Had the same thought that Bobby did just for my rendering classes
4039540	4041520	He said when I first read the story
4041520	4048800	I thought shaders was in the game was in the game development term for how your light sources get shaded and I was like wait
4048800	4054400	You're paying for light source effects. And I was like that was the first thing that I thought of too, but it's more like color
4054720	4056600	Yeah, it's basically like, you know
4056600	4061560	how World of Warcraft you get a piece of armor from this dungeon a piece of armor for that dungeon and you look like like
4061700	4065760	You look like a thrift store nightmare, right? Like you're mismatched all over the place, right?
4065880	4069240	Well because of transmogrification some of that you don't you can fix that
4069240	4073880	No, now everyone's got particular sets and you can still make the sets look like they match
4073880	4079000	They just give you a particular type for your body type. Okay, we'll have different colors apply to it
4079000	4085360	Well in a nutshell imagine that wasn't the case you still had mismatched stuff a shader will let you just dye it all
4085720	4088960	matching colors and stuff like right off the bat and usually they are
4089560	4093240	Shinier colors than what you might see native and I think I didn't play the original game
4093240	4099040	But isn't the original game like the shader was used for like everything wasn't the full set or was it?
4099320	4101280	per-piece I
4101280	4105560	From what I recall you did the whole set like once you unlocked it you had it
4105560	4108720	Yeah, it was the whole set and you can use it as many times you want
4108720	4113320	So if you upgrade your armor, you can just change it again and all that stuff now
4114080	4116400	You have to use it purse per piece. It's
4117160	4118920	You can't change it out
4118920	4119840	It's you know
4119840	4121080	Basically once you've used it
4121080	4126080	It's gone to consumable and then on top of that the only way to get it is through these loot boxes
4126360	4128560	That you have to pay real money for
4129680	4131360	And I guess you get some of them in the game
4131360	4134000	But that's not even really the whole thing that people are getting pissed off
4134000	4140800	People are also getting pissed off that there's mods in here and the mods basically grant you abilities to help you play better
4140800	4143520	And so in a sense, it's kind of pay to win
4144400	4146740	Because obviously someone that has more disposable
4146920	4154140	Income and spends money on this are gonna have better mods or more mods to be able to be more competitive in a PvP scenario
4156160	4162960	So, yeah, all right. Well, I can see why people are irritated but we'll see, you know a blizzard an Activision
4162960	4166820	I mean, I know blizzards not the makers of destiny 2 it's Bungie, but
4167460	4173020	Because there's the PC release and it's on an Activision has been known to throw in loot boxes and shit in the game
4173020	4179400	Yes fucking EA started that but um, but I I think they might listen to some of the feedback. We'll see. We'll see
4179400	4182520	I mean, I don't think they're gonna do a 180 on the system, but they've been pretty odd
4182600	4188840	They won't listen to the feedback because they've already made a comment on it regarding the thing and so their comment was
4189280	4194280	Well, no one's complaining about it. It's just you know, it's just
4194800	4199160	Appearances and you know, anyways, you're gonna be swimming in those shaders. So it's not a big deal
4200760	4203620	That was basically their comment I'm paraphrasing obviously
4204320	4207920	But all right, let's move on. All right, so, um
4208920	4213120	Blizzard is building their own eSports arena. So, of course, you know
4213720	4219240	Starcraft is pretty popular and the eSports realm and of course, you know hearth storm
4219720	4225940	and pretty much a lot of their line, you know games overwatch all that so now they're gonna be creating I guess the
4226960	4231800	Blizzard arena Los Angeles, which is gonna be located in Burbank Studios
4232280	4235360	It's gonna be one of the first arenas in the u.s
4235360	4241140	Built specifically with eSports in mind and they're gonna actually open it up not too long from now
4241480	4247040	October 7th, and that's gonna launch with the overwatch contender season 1 playoffs
4249280	4253280	So, so are we gonna go take a tour go go see something there go see a show
4254960	4260680	I'm not driving down there. I'll just take the word for it. We go to Disneyland while we're there. Why not?
4262280	4263920	That's cool
4263920	4265880	All right
4265880	4271960	Moving on virtual tour moving on in news that will surprise. Absolutely. No one and and just Loki
4271960	4276280	I already know what you're gonna say. We don't need to relive this every week. All right, but look, here's the thing
4276280	4281120	I'm just gonna get it out there. So Nintendo switch. It's selling really well, of course
4281120	4286780	We all know that and good old Reggie fisa made me to comment this week in an interview with variety
4287300	4289300	Talking about supply for this holiday
4292000	4299020	Certainly certainly the demand is there and our supply chain is there are we going to have enough for the holiday?
4299240	4301240	That's what we're focused on
4301520	4306120	Which was said in a way that makes it sound like it could actually be a challenge
4306960	4308880	So, yep
4308880	4315120	There that you may you may still have a problem getting enough of those on the shelves during the holidays now to be fair
4315120	4318360	He didn't come out and say we're gonna have challenges during the holidays
4318360	4322840	But the with the phrasing it kind of chose made it sound like he's not ready to guarantee it either
4323560	4326880	Well, he's you know preparing people for that inevitability
4329200	4332600	I'll be hopeful and hope that they do have enough supply but
4333440	4335440	at this point it's like I
4336200	4338800	Mean, I can't even be surprised by this. It's like
4339760	4341760	like how
4342120	4344800	How would you not get this yet? How do you not?
4345800	4352720	Coordinate this stuff. Here we go. Here we go. I'm just shocked. I'm not like mad even I'm just like like bewildered
4352720	4359200	Like how is it that company can't prepare like this? They you know, this part of the year is coming yet
4359800	4361360	Yet somehow
4361360	4367920	Well, we just can't do it then. Okay, my god, then maybe I don't know. I don't know what to do. I
4368920	4374800	I'm just gonna send Nintendo my thoughts and prayers and see if that's as useful as
4375200	4381200	This same thing that they've been pulling for 20 years. I'm just gonna I'm thoughts and prayers for Nintendo. It's like it's holidays
4381200	4384040	I mean seriously, it seems intentional at this point
4384040	4389120	I mean, they're they're either the most inept company when it comes to supply issues or
4390500	4391760	They're doing it on purpose
4391760	4397640	I mean because really that's really the only two options that there are right now because like how can you consider?
4397960	4399360	consistently
4399360	4405280	Not be prepared this many years in a row. I mean how many years has this been going on for?
4405880	4409440	several years almost a decade if not more like
4410200	4417680	How is it that you're just so ill-prepared for this every it's got to be fucking intentional. It's gotta be at this point
4418440	4423960	There's no way that they're this dumb prove. It's not Reggie. It's seriously
4423960	4428480	it's like I I don't want to feel if they're like this indicative company that's purposely doing this but
4429320	4431320	Like going I don't know
4431680	4436960	We'll certainly give it or we'll give it to college. Try. I mean like my god
4437560	4439640	Bob coffee giving the fair
4440200	4444960	Perspective here in Chad at live dog network comm saying might not be Nintendo's fault in this case
4445280	4453000	Switch uses some of the same components smartphones use it's never their fault and with a lot of big smartphones coming out could be actual
4453080	4455640	component shortages could it be Satan
4463120	4467180	Yes, it's saying in a party like it's 1994 because
4469200	4471200	They didn't know that you know
4471920	4478240	Every year. I mean, I'm sorry it no, let's not we're not gonna blame other people for Nintendo's fault
4478240	4481800	It's it's okay. What component shortages are there?
4481840	4488360	They're used by smartphones that fucking super NES classic editions that are using because those have fucking supply problems, too
4488360	4490520	That's not we're not gonna blame cell phones for this shit
4490520	4497340	What we as they're going in the production again, they all have enough supply to fucking make those SNES classic editions
4497560	4499560	What's the excuse there?
4501560	4504560	JD in chat says it's the vegans fault
4505560	4511200	If Nintendo would just go vegan and tell everybody that Satan so I mean stop it stop
4511200	4516080	I know some wonderful vegans in my life. And yes, it was the church lady for
4518200	4523500	The timing of you dropping that was was immaculate and caused MXC to say I love this show
4523500	4527440	Well, we love you all that turn out every week and listen to know what else I love we do it for you, bro
4527680	4529520	what I
4529560	4535160	Don't know I don't have a heart I ripped it out and sacrificed it, you know, what else I love what tell me
4535160	4537160	I don't know. I
4537880	4544720	Love indifference. I love uncertainty. I love not knowing things. I love
4546720	4551960	Keeping me. Thank you. Thank you. My keyboard kept my three keyboard cat moon shirt if you've never seen it
4551960	4558000	I want to get a moon moon shirt a moo moo moon moon moon the stupid wolf moon moon
4558000	4561880	Do you do do you know I have an official three wolves crying at the moon shirt?
4562400	4568560	Yeah, I have it somewhere in the big laundry pile in the other room the cats probably said I almost wore it to Dragon Con
4568560	4569680	That was gonna be one of the outfits
4569680	4571680	I was gonna wear one day to Dragon Con but then I was like
4572100	4577880	People might think I'm like not I saw your daddy outfit. Did you see? Oh, yeah, we didn't get to talk about that
4577880	4584120	My cosplay. Yeah Dragon Con my I didn't even play the game and I knew what it was my lazy fucking cosplay
4584160	4589640	Okay, so I did end up bringing two cosplay outfits to Dragon Con both of them were not quite bare enough for that
4589680	4593480	So the first one the first one I did was I did Sami Zayn
4593840	4598240	Because everybody fucking tells me I look especially Rama's Rama out there Rama
4599320	4601320	Rama tells me I look like Sami Zayn and
4602160	4605800	Some of my friends in the Bay Area my good buddy Kath who lives in the Bay Area
4606400	4610880	She tells me I look like Sami Zayn. So she actually was so far to buy me a shirt
4610920	4617000	You know who Sami Zayn is Loki nope, the wrestler a wrestler world World WWE it's because of my hat
4617000	4619720	He wears gray cabbie hats like I do and has a red beard
4619720	4625600	I don't think you look like him because of that were twinsies. So your nose isn't as big. Oh, thank you
4626320	4629780	So anyway, I wore that and I was Sami Zayn for one day
4629920	4636080	So but then the next day on Sunday, I did Brian from dream daddy who wears the green Hawaiian shirt
4636080	4640240	I had a little pet corgi. They took her out on me. You're not quite that much of a bear
4640480	4642480	Well, I'm getting I'm
4645760	4648080	I'm not sure. I want Jamie to be like
4648880	4650040	gay
4650040	4655160	Categorizing me right now on olr. I we're not we're a show of non labels, okay
4655840	4660880	You probably need another hundred on you. All right that well, I'm not sure whether to say thank you or not
4660880	4663360	But Loki Loki, do you know the difference between a bear and a cub?
4663960	4669380	Do you know I'm guessing its size? Yeah, or sometimes age age age, you know
4669900	4676060	Bears or bears are big big men Harry usually big hairy men and I've obviously I'm you know
4676060	4681500	No, not lacking in that department. But yeah, I'm I'm not big but I got fluff and stuff
4682140	4686740	You're still younger gent. Yes, I guess I guess but I'm 39, honey
4687820	4689820	At what age do I become a bear?
4690860	4692860	70
4694220	4697520	JD and chat says one day you'll be a daddy bear
4700140	4707020	JD and chat says we ought to move on from this topic stop. He says how about a manther?
4709260	4713420	My life heard man sir, but I kind of love it actually
4714420	4716180	older gent version of the cougar
4716180	4721420	I'm just like thinking of like I'm picturing welcome the orange tar with like, you know, like a panther body
4721420	4728340	It's like the dude version of the cougar very fast yet awkward. You're Rob. What you're stiffers mom. What?
4729140	4735740	Welcome to orange lounge radio rar. I'm your manthur in charge Rob Roberts now Rob's a furry
4736700	4742700	There's nothing there's nothing wrong with furries. There's anything wrong with it. But now we know your fursona. I just you're the manthur
4743220	4748420	I said there's nothing wrong first cuz I was about to follow that up with but I'm not a furry, you know. Mm-hmm. Yeah
4749460	4752100	You heard it here first Rob's a manthur
4753260	4755260	the white manthur I
4756260	4758260	Hate everybody
4758540	4764020	Well, it's it's really unfortunate that we couldn't make it to 700 but this is the end. Good night everybody
4766580	4768580	All right, let's move on
4769260	4776100	Dark soccer once tell us about another game a game that I am happy about and have been fucking waiting for two years for
4776860	4780020	Do you hear me? What pumpkin man versus manthur? Oh
4781140	4783140	Goddamn, I'm never gonna let that go now
4784100	4789400	Who's who said that it's a stoppie stoppie stoppie should a trademark patent pending that shit
4789400	4792780	And he we'd have to owe him a quarter every time we said it, but he didn't huh?
4793340	4795100	so I
4795100	4797940	Love my home stuck. I still love home stuck
4797940	4799940	I have gone back and reread part of home stuck
4799940	4805500	Even though it's like a rabbit hole that you can never get out of it's like a singularity of the Internet
4806860	4809500	Well, we have a release date for hive swap
4810460	4815420	Which is the game that was funded with like two million dollars on Kickstarter and
4817860	4820580	So it is going to be a point-and-click
4821180	4826700	Kind of adventure game that will not yell at you if you try to do these items will work together
4827620	4832440	It has like a bajillion responses for many different things. You could do combinations of stuff
4832440	4838540	So it's be really neat, but it's going to be out on September 14th. I am going to be playing the shit out of this game
4839100	4846300	The music though is done by Toby Fox as an undertale who also did do stuff for
4846940	4849260	Homestuck, so this is gonna be
4850060	4855480	Megalovania came from Homestuck. So this is basically gonna be like the capital of meme. Yes
4856340	4860380	okay, but you can play as a
4862340	4864340	Couple of different characters in
4864740	4865940	the
4865940	4870180	The first part actually with the part one that comes out you play as Joey Claire
4870900	4874060	Who is a teen girl trapped in her room in?
4875020	4882020	1994 or as Jude Harley who is her bizarre who is her kid brother trapped in his treehouse
4882700	4884700	Or you can play as a couple of trolls
4885460	4889200	But what happens basically they get switched from planet to planet
4889740	4891740	so she goes to
4892140	4894140	Alternia which is the troll planet and
4894780	4896780	Troll boys come to earth
4897620	4902940	There you go and much fanfic was written and there was much wank and Faye go to being drunk
4904300	4906300	and and
4906300	4908380	Juggalos taking over the government
4909380	4913260	You know a bunch of people lost their shit because the whole juggalo March
4914060	4919260	Happening at the same time in Washington DC is some drunk bullshit. Yeah, I heard yeah and
4919940	4924720	But there were a lot of homestucks that were like, oh it happened in the comics it's happening for real man
4925200	4927600	Cuz it did cuz juggalos took over the government
4929900	4931540	Whatever I
4931540	4934420	Have a reason to bust out the Ben Nye again
4934420	4939700	JD and chat says fanfic and wank are two sides of the same coin. That is that is correct
4940660	4942120	All right
4942120	4947740	Anyhow, I might be making scale mates again. Just a few more stories for you guys in the classic game of the week Loki
4948580	4952060	So there's been a lot of issues with Shadow of War
4952900	4955340	The new Lord of the Rings game that's gonna be coming out
4956020	4958020	pretty shortly
4958160	4961940	so one of that has to do well with this kind of
4963020	4966340	commemoration of one of the producers on the game
4967260	4970140	executive producer Michael forgery and
4971420	4972780	he
4972780	4974780	Our 4g I guess is
4975380	4983420	Anyways, he apparently died of cancer on March 3rd. And so with that they were going to do this kind of
4985540	4992560	Memorialize them as a character in the game. So there is gonna be a character called fourth hog orc Slayer
4993500	4996860	who kind of be like the like in fallout they have the
4997860	5002620	The mysterious stranger that appears randomly and will kill your enemies for you
5002780	5008060	so he would kind of appear and you know kill an orc for you or something in the game and
5008900	5012420	It was gonna be offered as DLC at launch
5013620	5015620	now in
5015980	5020500	Most scenarios you would assume that okay. This is gonna be some free DLC
5020500	5023760	This is kind of a way that they're you know honoring their
5024620	5026380	new fellow
5026380	5029460	You know employee and stuff friend or whatever
5030500	5036660	But then they decided that they're gonna charge $4.99 for the DLC because this is fucking Warner Brothers, but hey
5036660	5038660	That's alright because we're gonna be donating
5039820	5041220	$3.50 of that
5041220	5048180	$4.99 to the family which to be fair not unheard of because like blizzard has done pets for Wow that are
5048380	5050380	5050 for like make a wish or something like that
5050500	5055880	Wasn't the first time something like that's been done and my assumption is that 350 is probably the cut they get
5056280	5060660	After right the stores take their cut right so that that's fine to be fair. That's fine
5061600	5062840	however
5062840	5069300	There's fine print here as with a lot of things so the fine print that came under fire is well
5069440	5075440	It's only valid actually in the United States so except for Alabama, Hawaii, Illinois
5076080	5078080	Massachusetts, Mississippi and South Carolina
5078760	5082720	Because apparently they have laws regarding fundraising and that type of thing
5083960	5085320	and
5085320	5089600	This DLC is not being sold just in the u.s.. It's being sold worldwide so
5090320	5095920	They didn't come out and say that oh, we're gonna donate all the proceeds from like worldwide sales
5095920	5101520	It's only for the sales that are in the US in these states that are not listed on this fine print
5101880	5106400	So in a sense they are profiting from a dead person
5107620	5111380	Okay, but didn't they come out on Twitter and say that's not like that
5111380	5114300	They are not making any money off of this they said neither
5114820	5122940	Warner Brothers interactive nor monolith will profit from any sales of Fort Hogg the orc slayer DLC regardless of the territory in which the
5122940	5128020	DLC is sold so why can't we take that at face value? Why are we saying? Oh, they're profiting off?
5128020	5131940	Why can't we just say okay? They can't advertise in these states because and
5132780	5133900	You can't yes
5133900	5137860	It is based off a law and I was when I saw this original story
5137900	5141140	I was I was kind of floored that the law was not referenced in the story
5141260	5147540	But there is it's not hard to Google you just Google those state names and charity law and there is a charity law that says
5148140	5152880	Some states require what's called a CCV which is this whole split basically?
5153660	5157500	Raising to register with the state Alabama, Massachusetts
5157780	5163740	Specifically require bonds in the amounts of ten thousand dollars and twenty five thousand dollars respectively so in Massachusetts
5163740	5166420	They would have to post a bond for twenty five thousand dollars to even do this fundraiser
5166420	5173180	Well, they just do it in the way that we're gonna match the we're gonna match the sales of these DLCs in donation
5173180	5177260	That way it's not tied to it. It's just them independently doing it
5178060	5183060	You know and then they can do that with any state that would have been a way to get around that I would think or
5183060	5189340	Just just they're gonna donate the money anyway wink wink nudge nudge. They just can't advertise it in these states
5189340	5192660	They're doing what they're doing in these states keep themselves in the clear legally
5193500	5197660	How much is not fucking charged for in the first place and just open up hey
5198340	5202940	Well, we want to you know, we want to do something for this guy. We've opened up, you know
5203780	5208260	It go fund me or something like that. You guys can donate to that. I again
5208860	5214320	They've the idea of charity fundraisers and games through sales has kind of been done
5214380	5219340	Like I said in Warcraft and there's other MMOs never been like controversial like this
5219340	5223820	So that's the thing and I'll tell you actually actually I'm sorry but in Blizzard
5223820	5227460	Yeah, because some people were like why only 50% going to make a wish
5228260	5232380	Why why is Blizzard keeping the or Activision or whatever keeping the other 50%?
5232380	5236340	So, I mean there it wasn't paying their designers and programmers, you know
5236340	5240180	Well, it's the same with like humble bundle only a portion of that goes to these charities
5240180	5243020	All right, I mean, I guess you could set it to be like the full thing
5243020	5248900	but now granted there is also a difference between just general charity like in the sense of
5249340	5253980	Make-a-wish or whatever. This is money that they weren't quote-unquote expecting or relying on or anything
5253980	5256460	I think this is like it is literally a charitable donation
5256460	5262520	But in this other case, like you said you have somebody who's passed that it might kind of I don't want to say
5262580	5267180	Put a damper on the person's memory, but I think that's kind of the well conclusion
5267180	5270820	I think you also here's the other reason why it's kind of skewing against them is because
5270900	5277380	This is a game that everybody was looking forward to and then before this whole announcement because this is like the third announcement
5278020	5279340	That they've made
5279340	5284780	Regarding this game. The first one was oh, hey, by the way, you know that great single-player game that you have
5285300	5291940	We're fucking put in loot boxes bitches. We're fucking put in loot boxes. And guess what? It's not just cosmetic shit
5291940	5298500	It's fucking orcs and stuff stuff that you can get the aim basically pay the win. Oh, but don't worry
5298500	5300660	It's not really pay the win because it's a single-player game
5300660	5306220	Oh, but we got a multiplayer portion as well that you can use all this shit that you unlocked in your loot boxes
5306260	5310420	And it's fucking like the whole meld your solid thing where they had, you know
5310420	5316540	The bases that you would basically would be online and if they got attacked you could lose some of this stuff
5316540	5322740	So it's basically this churning cycle of bullshit because they're fucking loot boxes. Once again a loot box
5322740	5323720	They didn't need to be in a game
5323720	5329180	Oh then by the way, we're gonna do also a fucking you know thing with Totino's pizza rolls because sure
5329380	5332940	let's just do that and you can get codes and unlock shit and
5333940	5341140	It's so it's all that greedy shit up front that's been in the headlines for the last few weeks and then this is like the
5341140	5342260	fucking
5342260	5344700	you know the end of it they announce this shit and it's like
5345540	5346580	Really?
5346580	5351940	You know, I mean you're charging for it. What the fuck? I mean, it's just it's a big mess
5351940	5357860	I think there's better ways they could have done it and it doesn't help that this bullshit about their whole
5358020	5362340	Blue box and DLC shit came out wait before all this happened
5362340	5366660	Okay, you know you're getting some comments and chat over at live dog network calm stop
5366660	5370380	He says in that case with what you're saying. Why do we need the DLC at all?
5370380	5376900	Why can't gamers be generous to someone without expecting DLC in return? Exactly. I don't think they do you need to just say
5377500	5380860	Say hey, you know what? We feel bad for this guy and his family
5380860	5386500	We want to help out if you want to help out, you know, you you enjoy this game, you know think about you know
5386860	5393760	Donating to you know his family with through this thing. This is how you can donate they get it done after a blog post done
5394380	5397860	There's nothing that they need to do and then later on if they wanted to you know
5397860	5401820	Because we really love this guy. We want to memorialize them, you know, we can put them in the game
5401820	5404820	Like for example all those people that like played, you know in
5405380	5411340	World of Warcraft and stuff that were hardcore of that and there's a few that died and became characters in the game
5411340	5416340	They have fucking charge for DLC for that character. It was just something that they put in the game
5416380	5419220	A lot of them are NPCs and statues exactly
5419220	5420620	They're just NPCs or something
5420620	5426620	like why did it have to be this big old playable character thing that you invested money on just like
5427140	5431180	Why can't you do something nice to be nice instead of fucking charging for it?
5431300	5435860	like I get I can will assume that your intentions were noble, but
5437100	5443780	It just doesn't look good after you know, you're asking people to pay for money that shit was free before I just I
5444780	5447460	Don't know it's not it just doesn't look good
5448660	5455100	Bobby Blackwell and Chad says I probably wouldn't have donated straight like that for someone I never met but I probably would buy DLC like
5455100	5460140	This so, you know another perspective. All right anyway in the interest of time. I'm gonna go ahead and move on
5460620	5465100	Because we're already how far into the show are we like an hour and a half into the show and I already know a part
5465100	5469340	A so in the interest of time, I'm gonna move on and I want to talk quickly about this one more here
5469340	5477080	Another story that was submitted from our discord server about the Nintendo Wii. Yes that system from 2006
5477820	5483660	Apparently has infringed a Dallas inventors patent and a jury has awarded
5484620	5488720	10.1 million to this Dallas medical motion detection company
5488720	5493380	I life is the name of the company who sued Nintendo in 2013 after they filed lawsuits
5493820	5500580	In 2012 against four other companies it did go to trial in Dallas and the verdict found that Nintendo did infringe on the patent
5500580	5502580	first filed in 1999
5502580	5506300	describing systems and methods for evaluating movement of a body
5506820	5514380	Relative to an environment this 10.1 million was less than 10% of what I life's attorneys were asking for
5514380	5516460	They wanted a hundred and forty four million
5516460	5519940	That was how much the lawsuit was basically for at this point
5519980	5524620	And of course Nintendo has said it will appeal the verdict the company told
5526300	5528900	Glixel which is the Rolling Stones video game arm
5529380	5535140	Nintendo disagrees with the decision as Nintendo does not infringe I life's patent and the patent is invalid
5535300	5538740	Nintendo looks forward to raising those issues with the district court and with the court of appeals
5538980	5541380	So don't expect Nintendo to write a check just yet
5541380	5547840	But it is sure fascinated that this system came out over ten years ago. And here we are still arguing over patents
5547880	5549400	I don't know the details of that patent
5549400	5553920	but just sounding like it sounds like one of those patent roll pan patents that they have, you know, just I
5554560	5559160	Don't know it to me and I know like in Texas. There's a there's a certain districts in there
5559160	5563700	I'm not I don't think this is one of them that a lot of these patent troll cases go to yeah
5565000	5567120	Sounds it sounds fishy, but
5568760	5574800	Whatever they're gonna write it out until they get you know, they've got more money than this dude does I'm sure so yep
5574960	5578000	Just bleed them dry they'll write it out
5578000	5584240	And I think it's just more goes to show that and if it wasn't that case we would have had enough switches for holiday
5584800	5586560	God, damn it
5586560	5590820	Yeah, it's technically that technology existed in the Wii U is too as well didn't it? So
5592240	5596600	Anyway, let's go back to a simpler time when patent trolls didn't exist
5598100	5603780	Okay, maybe they did but I just like to think they didn't it's a simpler time when dark soccer is gonna walk into the gaming
5603780	5605900	Vault and find a game that she thinks hey
5606580	5610180	you little brats stop swinging your Wii around and
5611040	5615420	Come play this game. Hey come into the sewer grate over here. I got a game for you to play
5616020	5620660	It's the classic game of the week dark soccer. Oh, what is the classic game of the week this week?
5621300	5627660	Excalibur 2097 the whole reason I picked this is because I went on like a 90s music rampage
5627660	5629660	It was listening to a lot of psychosonic
5630660	5636300	Which I loved psychosonic a whole lot when I was in early college and
5636680	5644220	They did the soundtrack for the American version of this game. So in Japan, it was called sword maniac had a completely different soundtrack
5645220	5652820	But in the u.s. It was called Excalibur 2097 had kind of a different story and the soundtrack was done by psychosonic
5653620	5658740	Which if anyone bothered with anything about Mortal Kombat Annihilation
5659100	5662180	They were one of the artists from that soundtrack
5664340	5671020	Really just dance the electronic music really good stuff. Let me turn this up a little bit just for our listeners to hear
5676980	5679820	This is actually the version of welcome to my mind
5683060	5685060	Awesome anyway
5686260	5689780	The game is also fairly interesting
5691580	5696740	Basically you've got a big ton of different characters that are in this but it is
5698820	5706680	It's notable for being a side-scrolling adventure game where at the same time though
5707320	5709000	You
5709000	5713800	Had your boss fights kind of turn it into a fighting game. It was pretty interesting
5714920	5721240	But really I mean the biggest thing is notable is that either there was this involvement with a major with a major
5723440	5725440	Band I should say at the time
5727480	5735040	You feeling okay over there yeah, I am I'm trying to find something because one of my links I forgot to send you oh
5736940	5738940	But it's okay a
5740840	5746140	Couple of the things about it is that the art style in it was pretty dark
5747360	5750540	But you had all kinds of just neat different characters
5750540	5757480	You could you would pick up along the way, but you started off playing in the American version this someone named slash
5758280	5759960	who basically
5759960	5764680	went around to make peace and order of the world with his sword and
5764680	5766240	And
5766240	5767680	then
5767680	5772280	You also could pick well. There's also like you rescued his
5773240	5777480	partner Alex who was taken hostage and she then
5777880	5784700	Like gets possessed and all kinds of stuff and there's all kinds of you know different characters in there you have to beat so
5785000	5787000	It was a pretty neat game
5787240	5794280	You know fairly average for side-scrolling, but I think it was the soundtrack that was the most notable thing about it, so there you go
5795200	5798880	All right there. It is your classic game of the week Excalibur
5799600	5803480	2097 known as sword me sword mani sword mania X
5804480	5809760	Mania X just kidding, but that's what it was called over in Japan play sword mania X
5809840	5816680	You know what's funny is that in YouTube on that audio YouTube recommends the killer instinct theme as a related video
5816680	5820640	And it's kind of because I actually kind of hear that whole like killer in so if you want to play just a few
5820760	5822760	Seconds though of what the song came from
5823520	5826400	Although if people listen to the show all the way through they'll
5827120	5831480	Yes, I can hear it play a little bit of what inspired that here. Let's listen to oh
5839440	5842560	My god ultimate dance party right there on the night
5847000	5850800	Well that's not killer instinct, but yeah, it's still still that was that was like
5851360	5856440	1994 for me that's like the original song of what we heard in the other game, so yeah the Excalibur
5856440	5860800	Yeah, all right, so so there you go sweet all right there. It is your classic
5861640	5867560	Okay, game, but hey it's that whole era of cyberpunk game cyberpunk games, so I got you
5867560	5868720	I got you all right

5989680	5990760	anyway
5990760	5995420	We have some late breaking news to get into tonight before we get into rapid-fire news
5995420	5999800	Do I still have my special report break music? I think I have it here
5999800	6003640	Let me see if we have our special report breaking news theme while news is shattering
6004280	6006280	Yes
6006440	6008440	a
6008880	6015800	Breaking news on this Sunday just a few hours before we went live here at orange lounge radio a
6016640	6022340	Incredibly popular youtuber who has over millions and millions of subscribers on YouTube
6022680	6026380	He dropped the n-word while using a stream dot while doing a stream today
6028640	6035320	His name is it Matt it's like p.u. I'm eating a pie or something like that. Oh, so
6036440	6041480	Not the first time that man's mouth's gotten him into a little bit of trouble and you know
6042920	6048800	Didn't even really apologize for it like the moment that it happened because it just man
6048800	6053720	I debated if I should play the clip or not, and I'm not gonna because I don't want to promote this person but
6054800	6060760	Just the way that that word just kind of just fell out of that guy's mouth when it really probably shouldn't be a part of
6060760	6065040	his vocabulary is a little bit worrisome, especially with as many followers as he has and
6066040	6070880	You know that people learn that behavior from somewhere, and you know what he's doing um
6072480	6074440	And the way he kind of played it off
6074440	6079120	He kind of did a little oh, sorry you know kind of like under his breath or whatever is kind of well
6079120	6085460	It's kind of crap. Let's be real and again not the first time this guy has done something so I would also
6085920	6089120	Like to know why do we keep making stupid people famous?
6089240	6094080	You know what what is it about our culture that we keep because unfortunately this guy's
6094840	6099000	Name was trending on Twitter after the incident which I yes
6099000	6100960	I realized a lot of it was negative and so forth
6100960	6105960	But it's like it's just so irritating to me because there's so many hard-working independent streamers
6105960	6111440	And I'm not not even myself like I'm I'm fortunate to have more followers than some other people out there
6111440	6113440	we're probably better at it than I am and
6114160	6119880	And yet these people aren't the ones getting recognition. It's guys like this guy that are so
6120520	6125100	I don't know when this guy's gonna get cancelled, but it didn't happen the last time
6125100	6128440	I doubt it's gonna happen this time either. I don't know stop watching him
6128440	6132800	I don't like the way he talks. I mean that that's what I wish people would stop doing
6133540	6138840	Let's see Bob coffee and chat says shocking news racist little shit is a racist little shit mmm
6139880	6143140	Kai's you don't chat says he did that before and got in trouble
6143800	6145800	Yep, all right
6146480	6148480	anyway
6148960	6151000	Let's move on that was some late-breaking news
6151000	6156360	Let's do some rapid-fire news and hopefully something a little more positive right Loki. Yeah, so this week
6156360	6160720	They made an announcement regarding LA noir, which is like what?
6161600	6167680	Rocks are what so LA noir is being remastered for the Nintendo switch
6168740	6174680	PlayStation 4 and VR and it's not just one game, but actually three different games
6175040	6180280	So LA noir the VR case files will be coming to the HTC vive and
6181080	6183080	apparently it's gonna be
6183200	6189340	Seven of the original cases from the LA noir game, and then they've of course adapted those for VR
6189840	6196480	LA noir is gonna be coming to the switch with unique game features all additional content
6197080	6202040	Joycon mode with gyroscopic and gesture based controls and in rumble and all that fun stuff
6202040	6204940	And of course LA noir for PlayStation 4 and Xbox one
6205080	6210680	It's gonna be remastered there have 4k for the PlayStation 4 Pro and Xbox 1x
6210920	6214220	And yeah, and that's gonna be coming out
6214920	6218880	Later, although I don't think they have a date on that yet. I never 14
6218880	6223520	I guess it's neat that it's coming to switch but that game's kind of old old blank
6223520	6226800	I I hope that's not some freakin benchmark for
6227480	6232760	Rockstar on how they can do on the switch because this isn't exactly the greatest litmus test to my well
6232760	6236640	It's it's an okay title. Like it wasn't one I ever got into
6237240	6238600	I
6238600	6243640	Don't know. It's not as action-packed as like say a Red Dead Redemption or Grand Theft Auto
6243960	6249320	It would be cool to see like a Grand Theft Auto 4 remaster or something like that come to the switch
6249320	6251600	But yes, I think that's asking a little too much
6252400	6259160	With those with that data problem that they're having fitting all that content on to you know cartridge
6260800	6265200	Why don't they just do multiple cartridges, you know, like back in the room you probably have to switch back and forth
6265200	6268900	It probably won't look so well expensive. Yeah, maybe I don't know what else Loki
6269360	6275820	And then of course, I'm speaking of more remasters. This is more of a rumored port, but you know
6276580	6279820	Bayonetta and Vanquish were just remastered on PC
6279820	6287760	Well, the rumors are that it's gonna be coming to PlayStation 4 and Xbox one as well. So they haven't announced it yet, but
6288740	6294360	Soon apparently there are some retail listings that have appeared for it. Oh my god, Loki
6294360	6300220	Does this mean Bayonetta 2 and and here's the best part about it. It's a 2-pack. So it's actually gonna be both games together
6300980	6302720	For 60 bucks. No, I'm just kidding
6302720	6306120	We don't know we don't know how much yet, but probably probably not that much but there's rock start
6306120	6311980	So I think Bayonetta on Steam is only what was it 15 bucks 20 bucks. It wasn't it wasn't 30
6312320	6314680	Yeah, so right now it's as expected in
6315320	6318400	2017 but I don't know it's
6319960	6326240	It'd be interesting to see what happens with that and although I joke with Loki don't expect Bayonetta 2 again Nintendo
6326520	6330120	You know, they may they may have a time thing on it
6330120	6331960	Like it may be like after five years
6331960	6337920	But I would assume that five years is the minimum on that sort of agreement when did Bayonetta 2 come out was it?
6338960	6342040	2015 at this point, so it's gonna see still got a few more years to wait
6342800	6346120	Before something like that would happen. So anyway
6346680	6352920	Moving on a story that you heard referenced in our introduction that actually also came from discord this week
6352920	6357560	Thanks to you folks that use our discord over a vog network comm slash discord
6357560	6364900	But apparently a new newly updated official Japanese language profile about Mario
6365720	6369960	Has made it clear that he's retired from the world of plumbing. He is no longer a plumber
6370880	6376720	The profile explains all-around sporty whether it's tennis or baseball soccer or car racing
6376760	6379560	He does everything cool as a matter of fact
6379560	6383400	He also seems to have worked as a plumber a long time ago
6383400	6389400	Hence the past tense of worked now if you want to get technical back when Mario was known as jump man
6389520	6392780	When he was in Donkey Kong, he was a carpenter in that game
6392780	6396440	But you know, I know a lot of people that have worked several different types of jobs in their lives
6396640	6399240	But it seems like Mario has retired from the world of plumbing
6399600	6405920	My assumption would be that after all the times that he's rescued Princess Peach when you know, she's not helping herself out
6406440	6408960	That she must be a sugar mama or something, right?
6408960	6416480	He's got he's got he's getting some of that castle money some of that Mushroom Kingdom coin that happening. No. Yeah. All right
6416480	6419320	I mean got it. It's easy to make the joke that he's
6420920	6422920	Plumbed the princess but no
6424440	6426440	Who cares I mean
6427440	6431840	It's a really good question who fucking cares fucking cares. I mean, it's like I
6432600	6438440	Do Loki I need the background for my fan. I can't enjoy this if I know that he's a plumber
6438520	6441720	I don't like thing. So why he did play, you know
6442360	6448080	He'll be he'll who gives a shit who gives a shit when his fucking
6448320	6454360	Occupations because it never is once played into the game aside from the fact that he's in pipes and sewers and Jake
6454360	6461520	He's a pipe and the movie Loki the movie a pipe in overall enthusiasts. Okay, he just likes that sort of shit
6462040	6465040	He's an urban explorer. Let's make him like all
6466040	6473920	Dark Sakura has your world been turned upside down by the news that Mario is no longer a plumber whoopty shit
6476440	6482760	Brad from pod culture in our chat who by the way also celebrating a birthday today. So happy birthday, buddy Brad from bog cod
6483440	6491240	Blah blah blah, maybe I could pronounce the fucking name on his birthday Brad from pod culture says Mario has laid enough pipe
6491600	6492480	You
6492480	6497840	Know Mario is huh? He's a fucking cold-hearted murderer is what he is because he just wow
6498360	6503240	Indiscriminately kills all sorts of creatures in the Mushroom Kingdom and he trapped that poor gorilla
6504320	6508840	And tried to electrocute his child. I mean, he's a fucking sociopath
6508840	6513000	So that is what he fucking is Mario Mars a fucking asshole
6513000	6517760	Oh, but we don't pay attention to all the death and murder. It's what is his occupation?
6517760	6522840	I know that death death and murder is fine as long as he doesn't have sex better yet
6522840	6528160	Since this came from Japan did his blood type change too? Because that is very important information. I need to know his blood type
6528160	6530160	I need to know it
6531480	6537280	Orange right in chat says he caused that turtle to bounce between those two pipes for eternity
6537280	6541700	What about Luigi? Is he a plumber or is he now a ghost hunter because you know
6542220	6546700	One of those a legitimate job one is not a legitimate job. I
6547420	6549420	Mean, what's Luigi?
6550220	6557060	Wow, everybody everybody in chat just fucking let it out when it comes to Mario fifth dream says he has a shitty mustache
6557580	6560220	What about Waluigi and Wario?
6560220	6565860	There's all these people that are not plumbers, but it sure is a hell a lot of fucking overalls and shit going on
6566580	6570420	Maybe that's just the fashion in the mushroom. So if he's not a plumber
6570420	6573340	Then he's just a guy that likes swimming in the fucking sewer
6573380	6578000	He just loves diving down pipes of shit and jumping around the sewer
6579580	6581580	And none of this makes any sense anymore
6582180	6584980	Who thought it would be a good I mean, okay
6585100	6591180	So I get it that he's not plumber now because honestly the guy's been taking quite the vacation from his job
6591180	6597300	So that may probably got fired. He's like, well, he isn't he he's been missing for fucking decades now
6597300	6599300	I'm assuming the guy's dead
6599340	6600780	probably on a
6600780	6602820	Meth binge or something like that. Who knows?
6604340	6606340	Moving on
6606540	6612740	Speaking of Mario shroom head just despite all your fucking issues with Mario. Everybody's suddenly venting
6612740	6618020	Yeah, I always hated that guy. Fuck Mario. Everybody's just coming out and airing their grievances with Mario
6618460	6621940	I know you're all still excited about Mario Odyssey. Don't fucking lie
6622420	6625260	Mario Odyssey is coming out of course on the switch in October and
6625740	6630260	some more information has come out including I guess the box art is out there now and
6630780	6633700	Also some new kingdoms have been announced in the game
6633700	6638700	so there's a video floating around there on the internet and you can check out some of the new kingdoms in the game as
6638700	6642540	Well as a brand new move called the hip drop jump. That's right
6642540	6645500	You jump in the air after doing a ground pound
6645500	6649600	So you use the momentum you get from the ground pound to jump a little bit higher
6649600	6653940	The princess is very familiar with this move the hip the hip drop jump
6654540	6657180	After you do a ground pound you gotta jump over here
6660700	6667980	Dar Sakura save me fucking porn star now man with all those kind of moves save me from this discussion. How about balls? No
6670420	6672220	Pinball fx3
6672220	6679380	Is getting a release date. Whoo. It'll be out on September 26 for our PlayStation 4 Xbox one and PC and
6680100	6682100	comes with the Universal Classics
6682460	6685700	Set jaws back to the future and et
6686420	6687980	Yay
6687980	6690300	I can play pinball at home for real
6690740	6696560	Yeah, but I like these I still like these RK because I think that's the new thing right 4k
6697700	6699700	For is it 4k?
6699780	6701780	Is it 4k?
6702700	6709900	And there's also a demo out for a 16-bit version of Resident Evil for the Sega Megadrive slash
6710860	6712860	Genesis
6713300	6717380	Bobby black wolf and chat by the way saying not all of us can play it at home for real
6717860	6724140	Start soccer. You're like dark soccer. You need to check your pinball privilege. You know what what people could just come to my house
6724740	6726740	So Bobby's invited to your house
6727460	6730840	Come on out Bobby. So he can't use that excuse anymore
6732980	6739240	That sounds fair there's nothing wrong with this plan a little bit of an aside huh at coin up they have Lexi light speed
6740080	6746120	No Lexi light speed is supposed to it's a prototype modular pinball table that has a
6747920	6754280	Monitor built into the play field so you can reprogram the monitor and change out the modular parts and then make it a new game
6755040	6759720	But just saying for folks in this area go to quite up and play Lexi light speed
6760080	6764940	Bobby has also and he's talked about this on his show. He's moved into a new house
6765380	6766500	That
6766500	6772940	Is soon to be he will have that basement full of pinball stuff, so he's he's complaining now
6772940	6774940	But later I don't think it's gonna be an issue
6774940	6777340	And I still one of these days one of these days are sorry
6777340	6782740	I will have my baby pac-man machine one of these days. We looked at one. Did you really it was like six grand?
6783260	6787900	Six grand for baby pac-man for working fully shopped. Oh my god
6788540	6791660	It can wear again pimple pimple prices have gone way up
6792340	6796580	Like you could get a medieval madness for maybe five grand
6797060	6805300	Eight nine now Wow seriously all right on the anyway a 16-bit Resident Evil blah blah blah in the meantime pinball FX will work
6805940	6809020	That was the other story, but that was it that was it
6810860	6813900	16-bit Resident Evil blah blah cares pinball
6814700	6816700	Rob we need to do the pinball cast
6817420	6821440	I'm not as a pinball as you are it needs to be called look at my balls
6822860	6824860	I'll call it that why not
6825380	6827380	shiny balls I
6827580	6832780	Think I think you should find another surely there are other female pinball enthusiasts out there
6832860	6838220	You should all band together and do a cast a lady cast a lady called look at my balls
6840380	6844680	Show of hands in chat would you listen to a lady pinball cast called look at my balls?
6845680	6847680	Look at my shiny balls
6849320	6853860	They would they'd listen to it ever since you were young boy. Did you play the silver ball?
6856480	6861960	It only works if you sing it it doesn't it doesn't work right if you just recite it all right
6862960	6870560	So just just just to say the website doing that Resident Evil 16-bit PS CD. Are you?
6871560	6874120	To visit those types of places at your own risk, but
6874640	6880120	There's a demo for the Sega Mega Drive slash Genesis of basically a remake of Resident Evil
6880120	6884460	But in 16-bit, I thought you would have been into that dark Sakura, but you got distracted by pin
6884460	6890860	I got distracted by balls all right by the way balls some comments in chat Brad says best name ever
6891600	6896240	Let's see Brad also says fuck. Yes, that's two and I'm at says yes for three says yes
6896360	6901480	Rage Nader says sign me up come on Noel Gus says sounds like Manthur daddy needs a sugar daddy
6901960	6904000	When it comes to my baby Batman machine
6904880	6908960	Why now do I have Hedvig in my head? Oh my god? I got a
6909560	6913960	Tangent time I got a snapchat from our pal Victoria who has she ever been on this show
6913960	6918480	Maybe once like a long time ago, cuz she doesn't really play a lot of game. Well. She'll tell you she's now the cosplay Queen
6918480	6920600	Okay, she'll tell you she doesn't play video games
6920600	6924860	But then she'll be like I just ran an all-female D&D campaign where we do
6924860	6929260	I'm like bitch you play games you play games up. Yeah, so anyway um
6930100	6935540	But she sent me a snap she was watching Hedwig earlier today and exposing one of her friends to it
6935540	6938700	And if you've never seen this movie called Hedwig is a good word for it
6938700	6942460	It's it's like one of the greatest movies one of my absolute favorite movies ever
6942460	6946900	It's a few years old at this point, and they did a Broadway revival that was well known with Neil Patrick Harris
6947180	6951660	But the movie is great too, so that was my tangent. Thank you very much
6952180	6953820	All right
6953860	6960560	Bobby black wolf and chat says I write an actual factual thing that's neat about pinball fx3 and it gets ignored for man
6960560	6965380	They're baby. Oh hi this must be your first episode of orange launch radio welcome to the show as I mentioned
6965380	6968460	We're three friends that all met playing DDR fine. Here's the comment
6969060	6975220	Blackwell says the great thing about pinball fx3 is that they have a game mode that actually teaches you the way to play
6975740	6979880	Proper pinball today as in how to do the objectives and stuff
6980760	6984360	Keep the ball in play as long as possible ball flips that's right
6985120	6990240	All right if anyone wants to see a really good multi ball run
6990240	6994100	I did put video up of Dan playing cactus Canyon continued
6994100	6999800	And you don't always hit both flippers at the same time. That's a total fucking noob move
7000520	7004040	You hit one or the other maybe once in a while you hit both
7004040	7009800	But two rules right now what look at the layout of the field and don't play the Simpsons pinball party at the ball
7009800	7011800	bolt
7013000	7018120	If there are two things I know about bit ball that could be the first episode there's two things
7018120	7023600	I know look we're gonna talk about my two balls my two big balls right at the top of the show
7024420	7030460	Number one look at the play field number two don't play Simpsons party at the bolt now
7030460	7032460	I know that may be low-hanging balls there
7033380	7035380	Good first topic
7036500	7039300	Y'all are on fire tonight, what's that we take a week off

7303160	7304680	deleted I
7304680	7308600	Got my Raspberry Pi in case a few days after the first email
7308600	7312080	I wrote it was really easy to set up only took a few hours now
7312080	7317200	I have a mini classic system the place way more than 30 games actually about 200 times more
7317720	7323360	So far with a lot of room for another few thousand. I've been enjoying some other three a couple of Metroid games
7323360	7329040	I missed in the past and some gamer 80d fueled random classic arcade game sessions
7329040	7331640	I just thought I'd let you guys know it was up and running
7331640	7339040	I encourage anyone who missed out on Nintendo's minis or anyone who does love classic games to give it a go and put one of
7339040	7341920	These together themselves. They're great. Thanks again fifth dream
7342360	7345940	By the way fifth dreams in chat right now saying we never did read the original email
7345940	7348000	It must it must have come in the week that we were gone
7348000	7351560	So well, I look I've actually been following his saga a little bit on Twitter and Facebook
7351560	7355080	I'm sure I did cuz I was like, but I have one
7355600	7361240	But anyway, well, we'll summarize a little bit. So it's quick. I'll read it. Okay. Okay. Hope you guys did it
7361320	7366480	I hope you're proud of yourselves. You finally pushed me over the edge to purchase a Raspberry Pi kit to make a classic gaming rig
7366480	7372100	I really wanted the NES classic the games on it were great and it was worth the price to get the games officially and legally
7372100	7377460	But of course, I couldn't obtain one. I'm I'm mildly considered a Raspberry Pi but never bothered
7377460	7382300	I wasn't really interested in this NES classic and after hearing the effery
7382880	7384120	effery
7384120	7386120	involving that system too and
7387000	7392860	The discussion of last episode you guys convinced me to look into the pie is an alternative for easy retro gaming on my TV
7393160	7396720	It doesn't seem too complicated and I have a little extra money at the moment
7396720	7400600	So I went for it as an actual if you did intend to cue the F you music
7400600	7406160	I also you don't have to Rob. I also had it ready to go. I had it ready to go. I
7407200	7412380	Also purchased a case for it that looks like a mini nest if Nintendo won't let me buy the thing from them
7412380	7414380	I'll have to go ahead and make my own
7414500	7420180	Anyway, thanks guys for inspiring me to take the plunge and do this soon. I'll be gaming like it's 1985
7420180	7424220	I'm a brand new homemade classic system fifth dream. Don't blame me. I
7426100	7430820	Bought one I I think it would have been great if Nintendo would have made enough of them
7430820	7435020	So you didn't feel you had to turn to this route, but seeing as they didn't and you did
7436060	7440140	I'm glad to hear it's running. Well, I'm glad it's working for you, but I
7441140	7443820	Don't know I have I've got ever drive
7443820	7448200	So as long as you as long as you did that put the guardian legend on it for me, bro
7448460	7450900	Put the guardian ledges you put the guardian legend on it for three
7450900	7455260	Did you see speaking of the guardian legend and I should have fucking brought this up
7455900	7460700	There is an alpha build of a guardian legend kind of remix
7461980	7466220	Oh, yes. I saw it floating around your Facebook. I think actually yeah
7466260	7474100	I'm chatted with one of the testers of it over YouTube and I'm actually pretty pretty impressed with it
7474100	7477880	I haven't had a chance to sit down and play it yet. Just given, you know work and everything
7478700	7480700	especially next week
7480740	7485940	But I I have it downloaded and the music is really good
7486540	7489940	it looks like it's got some preliminary issues with collision detection and
7490660	7495940	Tweaking the difficulty level some but it's an early fan made game. It's gonna have it looks really good. That's great
7496700	7502060	All right, too bad that franchise can't seem to live on officially. I want the guys saying it compile
7502060	7504980	I want the guys who made blaster master zero to get their hands on this
7505180	7510100	Like who do I have to blow to make that happen the entirety of compile?
7510980	7513920	Line them up all three people left for the company line them up
7515500	7517500	All right
7518020	7520020	Anyway
7520100	7526180	That's it for the mailbag if you want to send us an email for a future week participate at orange lounge radio.com
7526420	7529860	We do have some more news stories for you guys, and then we're gonna open up the skype line
7529860	7531860	Yes, Skype is back tonight. Yay
7532380	7535320	Orange lounge radio all one word on Skype Loki you first though
7536220	7538220	alright, so
7538580	7540580	Let's talk a little bit about
7542580	7544060	YouTube again
7544060	7548220	Unfortunately, so there's a whole csgo gambling foot of fiasco
7548220	7554180	I guess with these different independent run gambling sites that basically allowed you to bet on
7554180	7556180	our
7556900	7560380	Different like loot boxes and stuff and all that so
7561060	7563500	the the problem was that there's these two guys a
7564460	7570900	Trevor Martin or a T T Martin and Thomas syndicate castle who were running
7571500	7574860	These sites and they were also promoting them on their YouTube channels
7574860	7581380	But not necessarily showing that they you know that disclosing that they own these sites in fact
7581420	7586700	They even faked videos showing that oh, yeah, they're winning all this valuable loot and basically kind of promoting this stuff
7586940	7589900	So they did run afoul with the FTC
7590500	7597220	However, there was no penalty because FTC said it normally can't find defendants for a first offense
7597780	7600340	however, it did say that they could face up to
7601460	7608020	More than 40,000 per violation if they fail to clearly and conspicuously disclose any future activity
7608140	7613140	Of course a lot of people aren't too happy about that because they feel that these guys have already deceived
7613380	7619900	Quite a few people, but I guess they get a warning for now, and hopefully they discontinue their activities
7622620	7627340	You've been warned you've been given a stern warning don't do it again
7627340	7631080	Even though you write millions of dollars on this don't do it anymore
7632820	7634660	Right
7634660	7641380	So moving over to Nintendo and something that I think a lot of us have been asking Nintendo for for some time not everybody
7641380	7646300	Though to be fair is an achievement system on Nintendo's console obviously
7646300	7650420	You know Xbox the 360 and one have the achievement points system
7651100	7658380	The Sony PlayStation has the trophy thing, but Nintendo systems don't have anything at least not for now
7658900	7664620	What's kind of interesting is that there was a ask me anything that happened this past week and one of the developers?
7664660	7670100	From crunching koalas was doing an ask me anything over the Nintendo switch game at licked spear
7670100	7673760	I hope I said that right now apparently as part of this AMA
7674180	7678620	He may have let it slip that there is actually an achievement system coming out
7679740	7684480	See I'm trying to find the specific quote here in the AMA thread where it is
7686780	7688780	He said
7689620	7691540	That
7691580	7695040	Sorry I didn't have it up as soon as I was ready to go to the story here
7695040	7700260	I here we go so he was responding to somebody who asked does your game have online rankings and he replied and said
7700580	7706720	Nintendo doesn't have an official support for achievements and leaderboards like Sony or Microsoft, but we know that they're working on it
7706860	7709780	We'll see how it goes and we'll add the rankings along the way
7710260	7716140	Also the game has multiple levels game modes difficulty levels etc etc so he said we know they're working on it now
7716180	7721020	Could this be that this is something that's about to get unveiled when Nintendo wants your money?
7722500	7727860	It's the first time ever that achievements have been brought to consoles Nintendo is such an innovator
7729180	7730940	well
7730940	7734460	They could put I I said this a long time ago
7734460	7740740	Is that Nintendo could do it like coins and you could actually like you get coins when you do stuff in games?
7740740	7742560	I guess this is kind of like the mind Nintendo system
7742560	7748580	But then you could actually use those coins for dinky rewards or maybe heck tie it into the mind Nintendo system
7748580	7753780	Why not me Tomo I remember that was one of the big reasons to play me Tomo is you actually got coins
7753980	7759220	From doing stuff that you could buy like it was really it was mostly dippy stuff
7759220	7762260	It was like backgrounds and 3ds themes
7762580	7769580	You know, but but it's still something and I think at one point they gave away like for a thousand of those coins
7769580	7771140	You could get p-cross
7771140	7775500	Zelda version of 3ds like there was actual like games you could get now see it
7776060	7779380	Yes, Nintendo actually would be groundbreaking if they did stuff like that
7779380	7784460	I'm not gonna hold my breath, but even a basic achievement system would be more than they've got now. I
7786060	7788060	Agree with you. However
7789020	7790420	however
7790420	7796220	Microsoft used to do that with the Xbox achievements where certain achievements would unlock stuff for your
7796580	7799540	Avatars, all right movie and stuff. So it's been done
7800460	7804940	Okay, that's true, but I'm sure they would like to tout themselves as groundbreaking with some stupid shit like that
7804940	7810500	Yes, I mean, but I also realize not everybody out there is into the achievement thing and that's cool
7810500	7812920	But I think Nintendo has such a rich catalog
7813500	7818760	Especially if they are gonna go back if they're gonna go back and update 8-bit games like balloon fight
7818760	7823580	Let's say to play online then if they're gonna be in there having to update it to do online
7823580	7826540	Anyway, then why not sneak in some achievements while you're at it
7826540	7833380	I mean, I realize this is not something that could be done for the entire catalog, but you know some of your biggest classics
7833940	7841600	Why not? I don't know. Yeah, we'll see Oh rage nator says I can you buy stuff with you play achievements, too
7841600	7843600	That is true. You play has that
7844420	7845460	actually
7845460	7851500	Pretty useful. Yeah, you can get like dance remixes and just dance and things like that. All right, so I use it
7851500	7854820	I use why did use it for South Park Oh
7855820	7863260	Costume unlocks, right? Okay. Well, maybe okay, so Nintendo wouldn't necessarily be innovative in this department, but it would be Nintendo
7863260	7865260	So you all wouldn't care trust
7866100	7868100	Dark saga. What do you have for us?
7869660	7878540	Well, it's a little tiny bone thrown out to to Silent Hill fans, but in an interview
7879180	7880140	A
7880140	7887940	Kiriyama Oka was saying that he would love to work on another Silent Hill title if the series was revived and he said
7888220	7893200	Several times that he really wanted to work on another Silent Hill game
7894500	7898840	It was mentioned at gamescom. He said I am NOT against it, but it's hard to say
7899380	7903060	Because everyone has evolved and maybe the mindset has changed as well
7903820	7905820	so
7906500	7908500	At least we know we can count on somebody
7909020	7910580	for Silent Hill
7910580	7917060	Well, I guess if a Bomberman revival happened any and DDR still chugging along over there Konami anything's possible
7917220	7920720	But I'm just not gonna hold my breath. I'm not gonna get my hopes up over anything
7921100	7924340	Yeah, I still need to watch that Castlevania anime though. I just
7924900	7928100	So much to do so little time to do it when I need to nap. I
7929940	7933060	Was I was too busy watching the Twin Peaks revival
7933060	7936020	I don't know. I don't know what I'm gonna do tonight after my live stream
7936020	7938620	There's no more Twin Peaks revival to watch it ended last week
7938620	7942140	Did you know that and I had to wait I had to wait till Monday to see it
7942140	7947540	I had to avoid Twitter for 24 hours because I was worried about being spoiled. Oops. I know I know
7948180	7953860	Sacrifices, I know the sacrifices I make my eyes hurt now anyway from rolling
7954340	7961420	But I will give a shout out to John from critical myth because he wrote a great review of the finale on our website
7961420	7967020	vog network.com there. He has the whole little section there and him and his staff for the TV reviews and
7967820	7970940	He did a great one for the Twin Peaks finale. It's filled with spoilers
7970940	7975280	So don't read it unless you unless you never plan to watch it or you don't care about
7975420	7979580	Probably watch it then cuz I'm not gonna watch it. Yeah, but he did a really good review
7979580	7985320	I thought so good. I just want to give I just want to give props where props is due. All right
7985980	7989420	And act deft and chat says spoilers it ends
7992260	7994020	I don't know if that's true
7994020	7995340	anyway
7995340	8000740	Loki what do you have for us? All right, so apparently steam has been blocked in Malaysia
8001500	8006860	And the reason it was blocked is because there's this game that's actually on steam right now
8007500	8014340	Called fight of the gods and so it's an early access and basically stars different god type characters
8014660	8016060	From different
8016060	8022400	Mythologies fighting against each other. So you have Jesus Christ versus Zeus versus Odin versus
8023340	8029220	This doesn't sound controversial whatsoever. And they also have like Moses and wait, isn't this right?
8030060	8036560	Huh? Isn't this might you're describing? I don't know. It's a joke. It's a joke. But yeah, it looks like it's a silly fighting game
8037200	8039820	but of course, you know they took offense to it because
8040460	8046260	You know Jesus in a fighting game is offensive to some people yes. Yes. Yeah, so basically yeah, I
8048140	8050140	Like there
8050360	8052660	They have like I guess they're saying that
8053780	8058420	His fight introduction and there's a voice-over result. I'm back for the people
8058460	8063940	He rips his himself off the cross and uses like I guess some of the blocks of wood still
8064340	8066520	You know nailed to his hands as weapons
8066520	8068520	Wow
8069040	8071040	Well, you know what
8072280	8076680	Hey people are free to make whatever game they want sounds I mean the game itself
8076680	8081140	I mean, it's not you know, it's still very early. It's rough
8081880	8086440	Bobby black wolf says in chat the trailer says he's back and he's cross
8092720	8094720	Okay
8095720	8096880	Anyhow
8096880	8101800	Yeah, some country some countries don't appreciate that type of stuff. So if he really wants to piss people off
8102400	8104520	He'll put the Prophet Muhammad in there, too
8106520	8108520	Don't go there. All right
8109280	8114760	Moving on one more story JD says Bobby real really nailed that one and Bobby's like no
8114760	8119000	I'm not kidding. Like that wasn't a joke. That was really really in the trailer. All right
8119600	8126520	Moving on one more story for you guys tonight our last story tonight, and I hope there is a particular listener of ours
8126520	8132240	That's paying attention to this story that I'm about to talk about because I don't bring this game up very often on the show
8132380	8134660	But I felt it was worthy to bring up tonight
8135300	8142440	Magic the gathering that's right Wizards of the coast unveiled this week magic the gathering arena. It's a free-to-play title
8142440	8147520	So I think this listener it's like two favorite things combined magic the gathering and free
8147540	8151480	So it's a free-to-play title and it's being made by digital games studio
8151480	8157380	If you would like you can get in the closed beta, which you can get into a magic wizards calm
8158040	8162640	Slash en slash MTG arena or you can probably google it and you'll find it that way
8162720	8166940	The game is targeting a PC release, but they're looking to do other platforms as well
8167480	8174720	The beta is going to start with constructed play where you can build decks using all 279 cards from the upcoming expansion set
8174720	8176440	I
8176440	8178160	Shall on am I saying that right?
8178160	8183160	It's I X a la n but I think when you have an X in that context between two vowels is the noise, right?
8183160	8185160	I think each along
8185480	8192400	draft draft and ranked constructed are coming later the goal for launch to include all standard legal magic cards
8192680	8197720	The focused of the arena game will be on the newest cards and game mode because of this
8197720	8201920	We know that magic online which is a library of nearly every card ever printed from the game's entire history
8202000	8205960	Will continue to offer experiences to players that are unique to magic online
8206780	8211360	Development on magic online will continue with new card sets new updates and ongoing tournaments
8211360	8214600	So you there's both games that are going to be covered there
8214840	8221520	They are trying to go after live streaming with this and they are hoping that MTG arena will be one of the most viewed streams
8221520	8224880	On twitch and I gotta say looking at the layout of this game
8225600	8229900	they definitely know some of the things that work well with Hearthstone because um
8230660	8235340	I'm kind of reminded of it. But to be fair Hearthstone owes a lot to magic the gathering as well
8235340	8241300	So it's kind of neat that how these two games have kind of helped each other out. So imagine the gathering arena
8241300	8243300	I like the free
8243540	8247700	Portion of that that definitely is motivating to check that out. So check that out
8247940	8254040	Alright, we're gonna open up the skype line right now orange lounge radio all one word on skype
8254040	8259260	and by the way, if you didn't catch the reference their rage inator who calls into this show likes free games and
8259980	8261460	Often talks about magic the gathering
8261460	8263220	So if you didn't catch the joke just just you know
8263220	8265220	I just wanna explain it for you guys one of our frequent caller
8265340	8271780	If you want to be a frequent caller or a first-time caller orange lounge radio all one word on skype and sure enough
8271780	8276060	Wow, it's lighting up right now. So let's get to it. We have some calls coming in coming in
8276060	8280500	We're gonna start with this one higher on orange launch radio. Who's this? Hey, what's going on? Everyone? It's Ron
8280500	8286780	Hey Rama, good to talk to you. How are you? I'm good. I'm relaxing. I've done all my adult chores
8286780	8293780	I'm kicking back with an adult beverage. Good job. You adulthood do something adult. Mm-hmm. All right, what's on your mind, buddy?
8294140	8296460	Well first things first, you know, I totally forgot about
8297860	8303540	Metroid coming out. I know bad gamer bad gamer. It's so there's a lot happening. So it's okay
8303540	8307060	I am so I'm trying to track down a copy of the
8308900	8312620	Deluxe the deluxe edition. I'm hoping that target pulls through for me on this
8312620	8313940	Yeah
8313940	8316700	Yeah, you know what? I couldn't find a deluxe edition either
8316700	8321480	So I just I ended up ordering the regular one because I don't think there was that big a difference between the deluxe and the
8321480	8326500	Regular I think it's extra because of the CD soundtrack is some other stuff. If anything I just go to a GameStop
8326500	8328500	You know how they do know
8328740	8332700	Yeah, they'll just kind of like be like, alright here you go. If we don't we didn't sell them all or whatever
8333300	8337580	There you go. But um, this is something I want to call in and talk about real quick
8337580	8343060	I don't know. This has been this has been talked about but this is my theory on the whole
8343820	8347020	Microsoft Sony Nintendo cross-platform gaming thing
8347260	8348580	We haven't talked about it tonight
8348580	8353640	but this has definitely come up in previous episodes, especially when games like rocket league come up and I think
8353860	8359380	Specifically that one because of the fact that rocket league will be out on Nintendo platforms before the end of the year
8359380	8361380	So what are your thoughts? Oh
8362300	8367960	First things first now when you play on Xbox Live, those are centralized Microsoft servers
8367960	8372420	They handle all of that first party third party. They handle all of that. Yep
8372700	8375500	This is the main reason why you can't PC play
8375780	8380420	whereas on PC the third party companies handle their own servers and
8380700	8387780	Also when it comes to Sony you connect to their central servers first before you go out to the PC servers now
8388260	8389340	for
8389340	8396300	Unified play you would need a Microsoft account. It's what whatever email address you use to log in with Xbox Live
8396300	8397660	That's your Microsoft account
8397660	8402980	So you could tie that to your Nintendo account and if you notice on various sites
8402980	8407780	You could tie your Nintendo account to your Facebook account your Google account, whatever
8408420	8415420	That that's all said and good and I believe that is the main reason why Sony does not want to play with Nintendo like that
8415700	8421220	Because they don't want people tying their Sony IDs to the Microsoft accounts
8421220	8427380	I feel that they don't want Sony they don't want Microsoft to deal with the services. They can't handling everything
8427380	8434220	You know what I'm saying? Yeah my game my rules, but isn't it interesting that Final Fantasy 14 exists now granted. It's not on
8434740	8438540	Xbox one, but it's Sony and PC cross play true
8438540	8443540	But when I'm just saying when that time comes when it comes out on on Xbox one
8444540	8449380	We will not be able to play together because that's separate separate centralized servers unless
8450220	8454540	Sony or square whoever decide to you know, let's try to make this work
8454540	8458980	Well square is flat-out said if they won't do that, then they're not releasing it done
8458980	8464940	They're not gonna release on Xbox unless they drop that whole thing. And that's what it is. That's that
8465540	8467300	Microsoft is not gonna let that happen
8467300	8474780	But yet well they but they did with Final Fantasy 11 which was cross play between Xbox 360 and PlayStation 2 granted
8474780	8480100	I know that was years ago, but it is still an example of they can make it work true
8480100	8485980	Maybe my theory is it worked. Well, but probably higher up. So Microsoft will just wasn't feeling it
8486100	8490020	Maybe it was a deal. Maybe I don't know it was absolutely it was absolutely deal
8490020	8496300	It was we want square on Microsoft platform. So fucking badly. We will do anything
8496460	8503860	Oh, how about our MMO that we could make more money off of with your platform that caters to the America audience
8503860	8507500	How about that? And yep. Okay. Sounds good. Yep. Great MMO 360
8507500	8513300	Let's do it and they didn't give a fuck about the PC and PlayStation element because they finally got a square release on their console
8513300	8518340	That's why I did it and I think with with FF 11 once you connected the Microsoft servers
8518340	8521300	You bounced off to the square servers to play
8521300	8528740	Yes, which ironically play online at the time play online doesn't really exist anymore at least not in that form but
8529900	8536100	Play online was a joint venture between Square and Sony. So you were it was like you were using a Sony service on your
8536740	8539260	Xbox 360 I'm stretching it a little bit
8539260	8545460	But still it's it's not the type of thing that would exist today and it's weird to think that just what God that was what?
8545860	8552800	Treasures of Otter gone was maybe a 2008 release. This wasn't a horrifically long time ago pretty much. Yeah
8553980	8561340	They could make it work if they want to well my isn't minecraft. Haven't they also said that minecraft will be playable between
8562620	8566540	It's basically everything but Sony. Yeah, cuz it's pretty much
8567340	8569580	When when Microsoft when it comes out for the switch
8569900	8575300	You're gonna be connecting to Microsoft servers logging in with a Microsoft account to keep it all together
8575820	8581420	Because the majority of players are pretty much PC Xbox and you play on the PC
8581420	8587300	you're logging in with your Microsoft account there or if you if you if you've been playing micro for a long time and
8587840	8593540	You get it for the switch and you see a login says log with your Microsoft account that person will be like, oh easy
8593540	8596820	I don't have to create no new account. No, I could just jump right in and play. Yep
8596820	8598820	Yeah
8599540	8606700	It's gonna be interesting but you know people people don't seem to be threatened by Nintendo when it comes to the online space fancy that
8607340	8611180	Cuz nobody's ever like fu Nintendo. You can't join in on this
8611300	8617380	Well, usually it's Nintendo your system is incapable of joining in on this but with the switch some of that seems to be changing
8617380	8620980	I guess between rocket League and minecraft and whatever else
8621900	8626680	Slowly, but surely but I am getting impressed by the switch. Am I getting one?
8626900	8632540	Not just yet. I'm still waiting. Will you be able to get one when you want one thoughts and prayers?
8633460	8635460	Something like that, but I will say this
8636100	8640260	The next my next console will be an Xbox one. Will it be an S or an X?
8640420	8642420	We will see as the holidays come down
8643940	8647580	Might also depend on is crackdown 3 out yet, right? Yeah
8648100	8654300	And like I said, the only reason why I'm getting an Xbox one as as you've always said it's the golden rule of games
8654300	8660200	It's the only reason why my first next-gen console at time was an Xbox 360 that console has all the games
8660200	8664860	I will sit there and play the fuck out of yes, sir. That's the most important if it has the games you want
8665420	8668380	Absolutely. All right, my friend. I'm gonna let you go to see if we get any more calls
8668380	8670460	but thank you as always for the call and
8671060	8674820	Everybody should check out anime jam session, even if none of you went to Dragon Con
8675580	8681180	No, but what one of my staffers it you go. She did go and I told her to find you that weekend
8681260	8684100	Go down to the podcasting tracks find a vlog staff
8684780	8690840	Give Rob a hug. Oh, I I did not run into her sadly, but Dragon Con is a huge 80,000 people this year
8691420	8697340	She's quite a precious little cinnamon roll. Well, there's always next year cuz we I will be back next year
8698660	8701740	Might just see a unlockable character come down next year
8701740	8706780	Oh, I miss actually I think I'm allowed to say this because I think has he said it on Twitter
8706780	8708660	All right, maybe I'll get in trouble, but I'm gonna say it
8708660	8712100	anyway, my understanding is that Travis Donovan's back next year and
8712980	8719860	This is a this is a big fucking deal. Just see so I so I heard I think we need to get the all of Bob

8755940	8757880	Stay safe
8757880	8760220	Well, I'm trying to think of something new to tell you
8760900	8764660	Okay, I thought you was trying not to say to because you might be offensive you forget
8764660	8769580	I'm the hardest person to offend in this world. No, no stay black is the longest-running joke in all our history
8769580	8775060	I'm just trying to we're coming up on episode 700 Rama. We got to we got to innovate a little bit here. I
8778900	8785500	Guess you say stay we bitch or whatever because you know, that's how I am. I'm idle trash. Weeb trash. Whatever. No, I got it

8795020	8796180	Alright
8796180	8801300	Bobby Blackwell says stay plumbing because he's no longer a plumber because he dresses as Luigi
8801300	8807060	I like that that was good orange lounge radio all one word on Skype light before I take another call here
8807060	8809780	Um any last-minute stories we want to get out Loki. Yes
8809780	8814720	There's a rumor that the 2018 Call of Duty game is gonna be set in the modern setting
8814720	8819500	The reason for that is because Treyarch has a job posting for some, you know
8819540	8826080	Combat designer with triple-a competitive shooter experience deep knowledge of firearms and modern military
8826660	8833260	Technology and you also have to be prestige one or above in black ops 3 multiplayer. So maybe another modern warfare game
8833260	8838260	Let's just hope it's not North Korea cuz I might hit a little close to home right now with all that's going on in
8838260	8840260	The world just saying IJS
8841020	8844700	Let's get to another call. Hello. You're on orange launch radio. Who's this?
8845500	8847160	Hi
8847160	8850360	Hi, this is Regenator. Hey, Regenator. What's up, buddy? I
8851640	8856240	You know, I can't hear me we can hear you. Can you hear us? Oh, yeah
8856240	8862120	Sorry, I thought I hit the mute button for whatever reason. That's all right. Yeah, what's on your mind tonight, buddy?
8862560	8869000	Well, you know, I heard a certain someone say my two favorite words free in magic
8870240	8872120	Yeah
8872160	8875440	Yeah, no, I figure you know when
8876080	8879960	If you mention it, but do you know when this the magic arena is coming out?
8879960	8882620	I don't think they've announced a date
8882620	8886720	my assumption is that most this kind of stuff you usually want to get out by holiday, but
8887080	8890880	free to play games are usually kind of held to a different standard because you know
8890880	8893640	They it's supposed to be like kind of ongoing continuous income
8893760	8895440	So, you know
8895440	8900880	You would hope that something like this if they're trying to target the mobile market would try to be out by the time that
8901240	8907280	Apple's new devices are out which you know times running out because they're likely to announce new phones next week
8907280	8911380	And what it's usually only about two weeks after the announcement for those bad boys come out. So
8912040	8916320	But I don't think it's gonna be that fast with the fact that they're trying to do this whole beta. So
8917080	8920520	Hell for all we know it could be next spring before this thing is out
8920520	8922520	It just really depends on what the developers want to do
8923280	8928600	Well, I just hope this comes to steam cuz now he is anyone on my friends list gonna
8929000	8935840	Test ooh, I played the ever-living crap out of the previous magic the gallery games. I mean
8936840	8938840	collectively I may put
8939320	8944920	Good news rage in our houses and say PC is what they're targeting. So they're not even really actually targeting right now
8945440	8951800	The the actual mobile market PC's what they're targeting. They haven't said steam per se, but does it matter?
8953080	8958460	Yeah, really exactly. That's what I thought. That's like as long as this PC somewhere. I think you're gonna be okay
8958960	8966200	Yeah, no for the main reason that I was gonna initially call before you even brought up magic the gallery. Sure
8967680	8968840	No
8968840	8972800	You know, it's a safe to say that the three of you are at least
8974000	8975800	somewhat familiar with
8975800	8977880	the RPG maker series
8978920	8980200	available
8980200	8986040	Available. Oh, sorry. I know I'm familiar with it RPG maker you guys you guys probably all know it
8986040	8988040	I mean, I've seen it in yeah, I just didn't have
8988600	8991640	Patience for it as I say I was gonna ask if any of you guys have ever used it
8991640	8997800	I'm aware of a long time ago. Okay, so I never have like I I probably picked it up in a humble thing at some
8997800	9002600	Way, but I've played things that were a result of that because I believe to the moon was out of that
9002640	9007040	Yeah that RPG maker right? So I've seen what it can do. Let's put it that way
9007040	9009860	So that's about my familiarity with it. But have I done a game in it? No
9010520	9012280	All right. Well, I
9012280	9017080	The main reason I'm big enough is I got two questions regarding that
9017080	9019080	um first now
9019760	9021840	hypothetically speaking now if I were to
9022640	9027120	Make it make a game, you know be a decent game or crappy one
9028640	9034440	And would I be you know legally allowed to let's say hand it off to
9035440	9038320	So I involved a lot to play with that
9038360	9044360	No, and be if I would do that dude, they you know, where'd they be able to play the game?
9044920	9048760	Just with the file itself that I make or where they need
9049480	9054580	the actual RPG maker software to actually write them like using like
9055400	9058540	For like a better almost like every later
9058800	9063600	Okay, my assumption and chats gonna have to help me out here because I'm not familiar enough with the RPG maker
9063640	9069980	But my assumption is that there's probably like a really cheap version that would allow you to make games
9070020	9075980	But not really publish them and then there's probably a more expensive version that does allow you to publish them where you can run the
9075980	9082820	exe is independently now obviously RPG maker has to have some sort of functionality like that somewhere because we've seen games like to the
9082820	9087180	Moon come out as opposed to how much does it cost to make something like that? That's the part
9087180	9088660	I'm not sure of okay
9088660	9093500	Bobby says RPG maker has a binary on PC so you can distribute the game
9093500	9099820	So whatever it is that you make you would be able to distribute on PC and you'd have to kind of carefully read the license
9099820	9103780	Agreement, I don't know what you're allowed to sell and so forth
9104260	9106940	But if you're gonna give it to a friend
9107180	9112060	That you know through vog or something that are posted on our discord for people to freely download or something
9112060	9115820	I think that's actually encouraged like RPG maker like wants you to do that
9115820	9119500	That's what it's for like it would kind of be stupid if you built this whole game
9119500	9126480	Then you couldn't share it with somebody so I think usually the sticky situations get into but then you profit off it
9126520	9128520	And I'm not sure what happens from there
9128640	9131760	I'd have to see the license agreement a little more carefully with that
9131760	9136960	But yeah, if you want to just design something for friends to play like that's that's what the shit is for
9137640	9142360	Absolutely do it. Oh, oh, all right. That's great cuz no, no, I
9143360	9149200	Honestly picked up one of the versions of RPG maker from humble bundles some time ago
9149200	9154600	I haven't really touched yet, but I've been thinking of doing something now
9155120	9157120	With it throwing a whole bunch of
9158040	9163260	vog references in it like what you did with the head off one
9164080	9167600	Thing you did for typing up the dead. No, like put in
9168520	9173680	Quotes and like they're like have a character like Bobby. They were mentioned
9174160	9179120	No, VR, you know have another character they would say
9179200	9183160	Yeah, we checked off, you know reject false icons stuff like that
9183160	9186840	No, you want it you want to do a vog parody RPG of some sort?
9187560	9189560	Basically, yeah. Well, I'm flattered
9189960	9196880	But here's here's my honest suggestion to you with all that and this is the total opposite of what Loki does but listen to me
9198040	9201000	Don't start off with your most ambitious project
9201000	9208040	I would say what you need to start with since I know you love dick and fart jokes make a five-minute fart joke RPG
9208400	9213700	Just so you can get in there and do it and make something and feel like you've accomplished something
9213840	9218560	Because if you try to take on the most ambitious project first, you'll probably never finish it
9222640	9225800	Well, honestly, I can't work here just yet cuz
9226840	9233540	Frankly, I've been PC issues. I won't get into that here. But once I get that resolved
9233540	9240980	I'll start working on and chances are once it all that is being said and done chances are
9242260	9245820	I'll give my project down long before time to car comes out
9246860	9249360	Say sorry Loki had to throw that shit out
9249740	9252840	By the way, Bobby black will found you might want to link us to the website
9252840	9257980	You got this from to Bobby, but he did find this whole can I sell my games created with RPG maker?
9257980	9259740	Thank you for doing the research. I
9259740	9261740	Couldn't do because I'm trying to talk to
9262020	9264680	Our caller but can I sell my games?
9264680	9265620	The answer is yes
9265620	9273140	You can distribute games you created with RPG maker or IG maker using its included or add-on materials as freeware or commercial wear
9273140	9277420	You're also add allowed to modify the materials with other software like Photoshop provided
9277420	9281980	They are only used within RPG maker or IG maker software and not sold or distributed
9281980	9287720	So anyway, Bobby linked an FAQ to you check it out and read it and I think all your concerns will be resolved
9288080	9293800	All right, cool, thanks, I'll definitely walk into that you're welcome anybody listening podcast who's curious
9293800	9296980	It's all part of their official website RPG maker web.com
9298680	9305800	Well, thanks again, and I guess I'll clear up the line just in case act after someone else wants to call him no worries
9306520	9311320	But have a nice night though. You too. Good luck with your game. See ya. Yep. Yep. Bye. Bye
9311800	9316880	You know, I seem to remember years ago and I feel terrible because I forget the listeners name
9316920	9321280	But he stopped listening some time ago. He made like a text adventure RPG
9321280	9324280	Do you remember that somebody made a text adventure RPG?
9324280	9328400	We actually had it on the olr website for a time and I played it and it was cute
9328400	9334480	It wasn't even it wasn't even done in like twine because this show is so fucking old. I don't think twine existed yet
9335840	9337840	Yeah, I just looked now
9337840	9343040	Apparently I've gotten in a few of those RPG maker bundles because I have 2003 and VX ace. Yeah
9344040	9350200	Yeah, I'm pretty I'm pretty sure at some point I would have picked one up to have like a game guru like his game
9350200	9356160	Guru is like the shittiest like build your own game engine like a lot of shit. I mean, it's just shit
9356160	9360400	Yeah, but you can make a first-person shooter game with it, but it'll be shit
9360400	9363520	Should we do should we do an RPG maker game jam at some point?
9364280	9368640	Sounds like a lot of hard that it's complicated. All right listeners
9368640	9373080	Tell me RPGs are probably the hardest thing to make because they're very complicated
9373080	9378840	Yeah, Bobby Black Wolf and chats is what we need to have another game jam. I actually yes, we do need another game
9378840	9383600	I feel a little more encouraged or something like RPG maker than I do like or we could do like
9383600	9389120	Would you do what like what they do down here in Sacramento with the IGDA is the progressive game jam?
9389120	9392880	Well, it's a longer period of time like that you work on shit
9392880	9395600	I bet you if we did want to actually do another game jam
9395600	9400960	I bet those guys would support us a thousand percent. I bet they would it's like I would totally get in on their progressive game
9400960	9404000	Jam stuff because that way I think we've been more motivating because you're with other people
9404320	9408120	The problem is I can't meet every Saturday or yeah
9408120	9411200	I'll I think they meet one Saturday a month, which isn't so bad
9411200	9414480	But it's hard enough for me to get away from the house. So I
9415000	9420160	Yeah, I get it. I get it. I would love to do something like that. I want to be motivated
9420160	9423200	It's just it's hard like this week like actually the last two weeks
9423200	9427480	It's been car shopping just car shopping car shopping car shopping. So that was
9428480	9434520	Unfortunately, what's been taking up my time there? All right. Well, I think the I think the
