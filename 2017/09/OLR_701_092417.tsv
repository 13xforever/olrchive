7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	19000	This week Sega does what Nintendo and improves it with an official collaboration between Sonic Forces and Hooters
19000	22000	Hopefully this goes better than when they partner with Soap Shoes
22000	27000	We have plenty more news from The Week in Gaming and it all starts right now on the show where every gamer has a voice
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice
36000	38000	It is Orange Lounge Radio
38000	44000	Live tonight with episode number 701 for this September the 24th of 2017
44000	48000	My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me on Twitter at Skie
48000	54000	I am joined in studio every week, each and every week with DarkSakura usually
54000	58000	But sadly she's not here tonight, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers is recovering from a cold
58000	62000	Some type of sick, I think it was a cold, I'm a bad friend, I don't remember exactly what it is she had
62000	64000	I think it was summer flu or something
64000	68000	So whatever it was, it sounded like it was bad so we hope she feels better soon
68000	72000	She said she's feeling better today but she's still kind of like, I don't really want to get you guys sick
72000	75000	And you know, doing the show, it does take a little bit of energy and so forth
75000	80000	So DarkSakura just wants to take the night off to get better and we understand that
80000	84000	And the voice you just heard there of course joining me here, Techmaster Loki
84000	85000	Hello, I'm here
85000	86000	Hi Loki, how are you?
86000	87000	I'm fine
87000	89000	Yeah? Not sick, that's good right?
89000	92000	I think just allergies but other than that
92000	96000	What else is new living here in lovely Sacramento, California where our show is based
96000	99000	That would be the capital folks if you've never heard of it
99000	103000	Arnold Schwarzenegger once had a job here, it was in the news for that anyway
103000	106000	So you're full of breadsticks tonight
106000	107000	Yep
108000	113000	Once again, they're quoting 20 minutes and it takes 40 minutes for them to make fucking breadsticks
113000	115000	I know it takes 5 minutes to make
115000	119000	It's because they're under, well they're going to be under new management
119000	122000	They had a sign that said they got sold to another corporation
122000	126000	Yeah I was going to say, when was the last time you were there you said I'm not going back there anymore
126000	129000	Well I wasn't going to go back there yet and I decided
129000	133000	Because I was going to pick something else to eat
134000	137000	And then I was like I can't decide what I want so I was like ok I'll just do breadsticks
137000	139000	I'll give them another go
139000	142000	And sure enough they fuck it up again
142000	145000	It's like, dude you guys come on
145000	148000	I can see you guys back there just fucking off
148000	152000	You're just like talking and not hurting, there's no hustle
152000	155000	Something the listeners should understand is that you're not just being one of those
155000	159000	I'd like to speak to your manager individuals but you actually used to work at the same pizza chain
159000	160000	Yes I used to work
160000	161000	That was your minimum wage job
161000	166000	It wasn't at this particular round table but it was another one
166000	171000	I did everything from washing dishes to working the counter to making pizzas
171000	173000	To breaking down the oven and cleaning it
173000	174000	You did it all
174000	177000	To management, I was a shift manager at one time
177000	179000	Oh my god guys can you imagine Loki as your boss
179000	181000	I yelled a lot yes
181000	184000	It was a mutual understanding
184000	186000	So we do tape live every Sunday night at the voice of geeks network
187000	188000	vognetwork.com
188000	192000	It's 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show
192000	195000	And speaking of Bobby, he was having a conversation on his show tonight
195000	199000	He was talking about a big topic in gaming tonight which we'll get into a little bit later
199000	202000	About the whole deal that's going on with Player Unknown Battlegrounds
202000	208000	Which is a game that obviously I've seen that it's popular on Twitch
208000	209000	Only $29.99 apparently
209000	212000	And usually when I drop in on streams I'm kind of like, I don't really get it
212000	216000	But I've had more and more people especially since we have a Discord server now
216000	218000	That's actually been fairly active
218000	220000	And if you want to join our Discord server please
220000	222000	Over at vognetwork.com slash Discord you can join in
222000	225000	More and more people are saying like Rob you should really check this game out
225000	227000	Well sadly I didn't do that this week
227000	230000	But I did go and I watched some more streamers
230000	232000	And I kind of made myself watch a little more of it
232000	235000	And I was like okay, I get this game a little more
235000	239000	But something that Bobby brought up on his show tonight was the whole tagline that you get for winning
239000	241000	The winner winner chicken dinner
241000	244000	That's a common saying out there
244000	246000	Is that like a regional thing?
246000	249000	Do they say that far and wide?
249000	251000	Would they know what I mean in Canada
251000	253000	If I said that little jingle
253000	255000	I don't know, is that worldwide? I don't know
255000	257000	But I was thinking in your case Loki
257000	260000	Maybe the game should allow you to customize
260000	263000	Maybe that could be a micro transaction
263000	266000	That you could pick your own dinner
266000	268000	And so Loki when you win in PUBG
268000	270000	You could get winner winner breadstick dinner
270000	273000	I'm fine with chicken, it's more sense
273000	277000	We don't need to appeal to a mass audience here
277000	279000	What about a winner winner turducken dinner
279000	281000	Winner winner bacon dinner
281000	284000	I feel like there's a market here
284000	286000	That PUBG creators should be listening to
286000	288000	No, no
288000	290000	Because they already have micro transactions in the game
290000	293000	Well as I said we do tape live Sunday nights at the voice geeks network
293000	296000	And you guys can chat along with us and participate with our show
296000	298000	Because we are the show where every gamer has a voice
298000	300000	And we invite you guys to sit down with us every week
300000	302000	Over at live.vognetwork.com
302000	304000	Where we do have our live chatters going
304000	306000	Come on Nolga starts us off tonight saying
306000	308000	I can relate Loki
308000	310000	I used to work at a Starbucks and I can't stand
310000	312000	When baristas don't steam milk
312000	314000	The way that they are trained to do it
314000	316000	Oh man I went into a Starbucks once with my friend
316000	318000	That used to work at one and I swear
318000	320000	She was about to have a breakdown
320000	322000	Because everything was disorganized in the store
322000	324000	Stuff was everywhere and she was like
324000	326000	How the fuck are they getting away with this order
326000	328000	It usually works to their benefit
328000	330000	Because I'm more patient because I understand
330000	332000	I've been there I'm not gonna get mad at you
332000	334000	Because it's not in your control
334000	336000	But dude I mean come on
336000	338000	There's a guy like he's like I need a box
338000	340000	I just need a small box
340000	342000	And the guy that's like cutting you know the pizzas
342000	344000	And putting them boxes just staring right at him
344000	346000	It's like are you gonna fucking do something
346000	348000	Like maybe ask him what he wants
348000	350000	Are you gonna say hey there's someone at the counter
350000	352000	Maybe someone back here that's fucking around
352000	354000	Maybe like go help him
354000	356000	I think one of these days you need to put on your old
356000	358000	Uniform under what you're wearing
358000	360000	Oh I don't have any more
360000	362000	Dude those uniforms are fucking
362000	364000	Crusted full like nasty ass
364000	366000	You know pizza sauce
366000	368000	It's just like it
368000	370000	No it's not a thing that I would
370000	372000	Want to wear again but
372000	374000	No those got thrown out a while ago
374000	376000	No seriously it's
376000	378000	I get it I get it
378000	380000	It's like you guys may or may not know
380000	382000	I trained for a call center for many many years
382000	384000	This was the job that I did
384000	386000	And so when I call
386000	388000	Like call centers I usually have a lot of patience
388000	390000	From people on the line because I know you know what they're
390000	392000	Going through and so forth and I never lose
392000	394000	My shit with somebody on the phone
394000	396000	If even if I'm upset I'm gonna
396000	398000	I'm gonna start off by saying like
398000	400000	I'm really upset that this is happening
400000	402000	I know it's not your fault but is there anything
402000	404000	You can do to help me like I always you know kind of
404000	406000	Be nice about it like I'm pissed but I'm not pissed
406000	408000	At you which trust me those folks
408000	410000	Really appreciate
410000	412000	But I get it but then when I get like the really
412000	414000	Lazy where it's like I totally
414000	416000	Know this person is like trying to shoo me off the line
416000	418000	Doesn't care does it like I get
418000	420000	Really frustrated and I never
420000	422000	I never yell I still don't yell I'm not that type
422000	424000	I just hang up and call back and get somebody else
424000	426000	Right like they were cool like last
426000	428000	Time that that happened you know they
428000	430000	The manager actually did call me and leave a message
430000	432000	Later on and like he was probably
432000	434000	Gonna like they already caught me that one
434000	436000	Time so I was like that's fine
436000	438000	You took care of it then I don't need to talk to your
438000	440000	Manager to say hey
440000	442000	You guys are slow in this particular instance
442000	444000	I don't like I don't like to make a fuss
444000	446000	There's no point in doing that it's not gonna accomplish anything
446000	448000	But some people love to make a fuss and it's always like oh god
448000	450000	Oh yeah I know I know
450000	452000	So awkward stop making a fuss
452000	454000	So many I know the owner
454000	456000	And they would come in like they would
456000	458000	Fucking like there's one family
458000	460000	They claim they knew the owner
460000	462000	They did know the owner and we
462000	464000	Knew them all like everybody in the store
464000	466000	Knew them cause every time they'd come in
466000	468000	They would complain about their pizza
468000	470000	Doesn't matter what they ordered
470000	472000	They would have a complaint about it cause they were trying to get it for free
472000	474000	Every time
474000	476000	So fucking annoying
476000	478000	But yes those people do exist
478000	480000	Alright we will get to video games
480000	482000	I promise but I wanted to read some more comments
482000	484000	And chat over at live.voggenetwork.com
484000	486000	Let's see
486000	488000	Tigerclaw asks why does it always have to be chicken dinner
488000	490000	What if you want a steak dinner?
490000	492000	That's what I'm saying
492000	494000	Like you know a steak dinner that's a reward
494000	496000	Like when I get to go to Ruth Chris
496000	498000	Like I'm putting on my slacks
498000	500000	To go out to the restaurant
500000	502000	Like this is fine dining tonight
502000	504000	So yeah I'm good for steak dinner
504000	506000	Let's see
506000	508000	Somebody is oh yeah Dungeon Buster suggested
508000	510000	Loki on the next undercover boss
510000	512000	And come on Noel Gus says
512000	514000	Loki's game needs to be a food service worker
514000	516000	VR simulator
516000	518000	Well that's kind of I mean I guess they have job simulator
518000	520000	But that's kind of that's different
520000	522000	It's already been done so well
522000	524000	That's a perfect example recent example
524000	526000	Of food service worker VR game
526000	528000	That's fucking weird because
528000	530000	We haven't had a food
530000	532000	A weird food service game in a while since like
532000	534000	Sneak King but if anyone's
534000	536000	Watched videos of the VR
536000	538000	KFC
538000	540000	Chicken Fry game that is
540000	542000	Fucking weird and I need a full game
542000	544000	Of that because that's just like crazy
544000	546000	That came up on the show a couple weeks ago yeah
546000	548000	There's a really fun game that one of my
548000	550000	Buddies on Twitch streams and I can't
550000	552000	Remember the name of it which is horrible
552000	554000	But it's like one of those food service games
554000	556000	And you have the ingredients that and people
556000	558000	Come up to the table and you have to put it all together
558000	560000	And all that stuff and that was you know it kind of reminded
560000	562000	Me of that only job simulator where you can just fuck it
562000	564000	All up because you know it's a robot
564000	566000	It was something that started with an O
566000	568000	And it would be not overcooked not that one
568000	570000	It's something else had like a four three or four word
570000	572000	Title and this was like part two and it was
572000	574000	Something new so maybe maybe no
574000	576000	It wasn't overcooked unfortunate something else
576000	578000	I know that one um yeah anyway
578000	580000	Sorry I can't I don't always
580000	582000	Remember the name of every single game out there
582000	584000	Is that it yes MXC
584000	586000	Is right it's cook serve delicious that is the name
586000	588000	Of it it was cook good job MXC
588000	590000	Winner winner steak dinner MXC
590000	592000	It's cook serve delicious that's the name of it
592000	594000	So yeah that one's uh
594000	596000	That one looked fun so that's one you could try
596000	598000	Because not only do you have to cook the food
598000	600000	But then all of a sudden like instead of a food order coming in
600000	602000	It'll come in and go bing the toilet's backed
602000	604000	Up you gotta go fix it bing
604000	606000	The dumpsters full out back
606000	608000	So you have to go and like the part of the keystrokes you do is like
608000	610000	Stomp the dumpster down
610000	612000	Like everything so I thought it was funny
612000	614000	Or the rat traps have to be
614000	616000	Reset or just like other like random shit
616000	618000	Comes in in addition to the food and I thought that was
618000	620000	Funny so yeah I watched a
620000	622000	Buddy of mine playing it on twitch and I was like oh maybe I'll
622000	624000	Get this this will be fun so
624000	626000	Alright anyhow
626000	628000	Guys you don't suggest
628000	630000	Overwatch no that's a different game
630000	632000	We'll get into that during gaming weeks but
632000	634000	First let's get to our kickoff topic tonight
634000	636000	Believe it or not we're not just going to talk about
636000	638000	Food service but we want to talk a little bit about
638000	640000	Tokyo Game Show was this past week
640000	642000	Which was mainly
642000	644000	A Sony affair I mean
644000	646000	Not exclusively obviously you have a lot of
646000	648000	Third party developers showing the stuff
648000	650000	They're doing for maybe mobile phones
650000	652000	And so forth but um
652000	654000	With Microsoft you know in
654000	656000	Japan not really being a thing and
656000	658000	Nintendo sitting out Tokyo Game Show
658000	660000	It really is Sony's to kind of drive so that's
660000	662000	Why they did a big press conference which was
662000	664000	What it was Tuesday in Japan
664000	666000	Right but it was yeah like Tuesday at 6
666000	668000	Third time but it was Monday at midnight
668000	670000	For us yeah and I didn't
670000	672000	Like this is one of those rare occasions where I have to
672000	674000	Really thank Twitter because I
674000	676000	Excuse me I totally forgot that this was
676000	678000	The thing that was going to be on until
678000	680000	Twitter was like hey here's the YouTube stream
680000	682000	Stream with the English translation
682000	684000	Of the people on stage didn't translate
684000	686000	The trailers but it was enough you could understand
686000	688000	What was going on so I actually watched
688000	690000	I mean I only missed the very very beginning
690000	692000	Where I guess they had some type of song or something
692000	694000	I totally missed that thing but I saw
694000	696000	Yeah it was just a sizzle reel
696000	698000	Yeah I saw the bulk of it and I was I
698000	700000	I liked it dare I say I was more
700000	702000	Engaged than I was with E3
702000	704000	Because I felt like we saw
704000	706000	More like new things
706000	708000	As opposed to you know my disappointment
708000	710000	With this year's E3 is that it really felt like it was
710000	712000	Shorter and it was like it was kind of like an update
712000	714000	A thon but you know there were updates
714000	716000	In this too don't get me wrong but there were some other things
716000	718000	I saw in it where I was like ooh cat butt
719000	721000	I want to see how they're going to do that which obviously I'm talking about
721000	723000	Nicole Atsume is getting a VR version
723000	725000	Which that was kind of out of left field
725000	727000	I mean I don't think there were a lot of like huge surprises
727000	729000	Well actually no I take that back there were kind of some big surprises
729000	731000	Like Zone of the Enders
731000	733000	Getting a VR release
733000	735000	That's a very interesting direction from Konami
735000	737000	Where you have to think
737000	739000	At this point that Konami
739000	741000	Is well aware of
741000	743000	What's going on on the internet
743000	745000	Like somebody at this point
745000	747000	Has found out that Konami is not popular
748000	750000	People are saying fuck you Konami
750000	752000	This is brand new information
752000	754000	They are not happy with the way we are doing things
754000	756000	So I do feel like
756000	758000	Konami is kind of like
758000	760000	I feel like in a way they might be doing
760000	762000	Some soul searching right now
762000	764000	What isn't working for us
764000	766000	Fucking over Hideo Kojima that's not working for us
766000	768000	What is working for us
768000	770000	Making the old shit new again
770000	772000	Right and that's why you see
772000	774000	Well I mean it's working in television too
774000	776000	Like fucking Will and Grace is back on TV this week
776000	778000	But anyway
778000	780000	What was I going to say
782000	784000	Everything is old is new again
784000	786000	Final Fantasy 9
786000	788000	Nah not just that dammit
788000	790000	I lost my train of thought
790000	792000	No Zone of the Enders Konami
792000	794000	Oh Bomberman the Bomberman thing on Switch
794000	796000	That came out not that long ago right
796000	798000	And they began supporting that
798000	800000	What have they been supporting it with
800000	802000	Pyramid Head
802000	804000	And now I think they just announced
804000	806000	The franchise is delivered again
806000	808000	Right but I do feel like Konami
808000	810000	Is trying to like tap into like what do we have
810000	812000	Left to salvage this relationship
812000	814000	And to be fair
814000	816000	Their arcade division is still kind of
816000	818000	Chugging along like you know
818000	820000	U-Beat is still like I see lines for that at
820000	822000	Conventions and 2DX is trucking along
822000	824000	Dance Dance Revolution is school
824000	826000	I would like to see another Dance Dance Revolution come home
826000	828000	I understand that's not a very profitable thing
828000	830000	I would just like to see fucking Beatmania 2DX come home
830000	832000	Like yes I know it's a special controller
832000	834000	Come on come on
834000	836000	Just release something that
836000	838000	Is playable on a regular controller
838000	840000	Yes I know it'll suck but
840000	842000	Release like a special third party
842000	844000	Old school controller that will work on
844000	846000	PlayStation 4 like
846000	848000	Why do you keep robbing me of this because there's so
848000	850000	Many songs from what was the last one they did
850000	852000	I keep wanting to say Princess but I think it was
852000	854000	Empress 2DX Empress all the way through now
854000	856000	That's like that's like eight or nine
856000	858000	Versions of the game that have never
858000	860000	Come home you know anyway
860000	862000	But I don't know maybe some people are like
862000	864000	Beatmania 2DX is kind of an old
864000	866000	It's an old game but yet it's still going in the arcade
866000	868000	I mean there's an audience for it somewhere
868000	870000	Right I don't know anyway
870000	872000	I just I mean people are if they're worried about
872000	874000	Like the price points and you know selling that
874000	876000	Stuff I mean a lot of times people are buying
876000	878000	Like these collector's editions they're like $200
878000	880000	And what comes with a shitty statue
880000	882000	I mean
882000	884000	Fuck I'm sure you can manage to make a controller
884000	886000	Cheap or just you know
886000	888000	What I know this may not be the popular
888000	890000	Idea but it's better than nothing
890000	892000	Why not just release Beatmania
892000	894000	Online and it comes with
894000	896000	Like three songs for free
896000	898000	And the whole thing is free just to make the game
898000	900000	Free and it comes with like
900000	902000	The staple Konami songs like
902000	904000	20 November and you know like
904000	906000	Old Konami shit for free like three
906000	908000	Konami originals for free that you just download for free
908000	910000	And then just charge for song packs
910000	912000	Like mobile phone games do
912000	914000	I think there would be a lot of people that would play
914000	916000	Like a 2DX Unlimited type of thing
916000	918000	And that might even worry I mean
918000	920000	I would hope they would release it in the US
920000	922000	But I guess if it's region free I don't know
922000	924000	I just I feel like that could happen
924000	926000	Why not like um
926000	928000	DJ Max
928000	930000	Is very very very
930000	932000	Similar and is
932000	934000	Out and I've played it thanks
934000	936000	To Shane doing the import thing on his
936000	938000	Playstation 4 and it's
938000	940000	It's fun I like it and I
940000	942000	Can't wait for some of the DLC that they're going to put out
942000	944000	Because I really want to play like
944000	946000	They have like a Hatsune Miku game that's like that too
946000	948000	I thought they had a free one
948000	950000	They do it's
950000	952000	Hatsune Miku so it's not the falling notes
952000	954000	Yeah yeah they do
954000	956000	It's like one song that comes with that one
956000	958000	It's like two songs one from each pack
958000	960000	It's like a I don't remember the exact names
960000	962000	It's like Sun and Moon type of thing
962000	964000	You can download big I think
964000	966000	It's like Future Tone somebody in channel yell it out
966000	968000	But I think one of them
968000	970000	Is like older songs and one of them is like newer
970000	972000	From the arcade songs is kind of how it
972000	974000	Yeah Act F says
974000	976000	Hatsune Miku Future Tone
976000	978000	There you go
978000	980000	Dartetsuya in chat says
980000	982000	They have that the BeatMania 2DX thing I'm talking about
982000	984000	But it's not free that's right I forgot about this
984000	986000	He says it's called Infinitas
986000	988000	But it doesn't use the song pack model
988000	990000	They charge monthly for a Picelli
990000	992000	Or whatever okay then
992000	994000	It ain't on console so
994000	996000	Scrap it and start over
996000	998000	My controversial thought
998000	1000000	Anyway sorry we deviated a little bit
1000000	1002000	We were supposed to be talking about Tokyo Game Show and Sony's press conference
1002000	1004000	And it turned into a whole I wish Konami would do this thing
1004000	1006000	But I think the
1006000	1008000	The moral of the story is
1008000	1010000	I think the Gears are
1010000	1012000	Taking at Konami and they realize
1012000	1014000	They're not loved
1014000	1016000	And cherished right now
1016000	1018000	So you're probably going to see them try to do
1018000	1020000	Some weird things over the next couple of years
1020000	1022000	To try to win people's favor back
1022000	1024000	Like that new Metal Gear Solid game
1024000	1026000	I think they will put out a new Silent Hill
1026000	1028000	Even though obviously
1028000	1030000	PT and what we saw there
1030000	1032000	That should have been it I think Konami will put out a new Silent Hill
1032000	1034000	I think they will
1034000	1036000	Hopefully it's before this
1036000	1038000	New Kojima game comes out
1038000	1040000	Because that's going to fucking
1040000	1042000	Destroy whatever they want
1042000	1044000	Well obviously it would be ridiculous to release them the same day
1044000	1046000	But assuming
1046000	1048000	The Hideo Kojima game is a next year
1048000	1050000	Release that would seem
1050000	1052000	It would seem like 2018 is a good time for that to come out
1052000	1054000	Well I'm not surprised
1054000	1056000	I was kind of hoping we'd see a new trailer
1056000	1058000	For that
1058000	1060000	But I guess we'll have to wait until December
1060000	1062000	For Death Stranding
1062000	1064000	That also might be a little played out at the PlayStation events right now
1064000	1066000	We haven't had one
1066000	1068000	There wasn't a trailer at E3
1068000	1070000	So it's been a while since December
1070000	1072000	Was the last time we had a trailer
1072000	1074000	I guess that's true
1074000	1076000	The next thing we see ought to be gameplay
1076000	1078000	And you do mention December
1078000	1080000	Obviously Sony has their big
1080000	1082000	Company event
1082000	1084000	The Sony experience
1084000	1086000	And there's also the video game awards
1086000	1088000	Usually Geoff Keighley is chummy
1088000	1090000	With Kojima
1090000	1092000	Usually they have something there
1092000	1094000	And Nintendo yeah
1094000	1096000	So he usually gets some stuff for that
1096000	1098000	Death Stranding starring Mario
1098000	1100000	Mamma Mia
1100000	1102000	This is weird
1102000	1104000	I don't know what's going on here
1104000	1106000	Suddenly I'm shirtless and the world is adoring my titties
1106000	1108000	Anyway let's talk about some other stuff
1108000	1110000	That was in Sony's press conference
1110000	1112000	Now I have to see someone recreate
1112000	1114000	The Death Stranding trailer
1114000	1116000	But CG characters from Mario
1116000	1118000	Replacing the characters
1118000	1120000	I'm pretty sure that had to have been done
1120000	1122000	It's not done yet but that would be hilarious
1122000	1124000	I would love to see that
1124000	1126000	What were some other things we got here
1126000	1128000	We got the Call of Duty World War 2 trailer
1128000	1130000	Ni No Kuni 2 trailer
1130000	1132000	Right up your alley
1132000	1134000	Earth Defense Force
1134000	1136000	I would have been more excited about Earth Defense Force 5
1136000	1138000	If they hadn't already announced that
1138000	1140000	So that was alright
1140000	1142000	Pretty soon
1142000	1144000	The one I was more excited about was the other Earth Defense Force game
1144000	1146000	Which was Earth Defense Force Iron Rain
1146000	1148000	Which is a brand new game
1148000	1150000	That's using a different engine
1150000	1152000	By a different developer
1152000	1154000	So I'm very interested in that
1154000	1156000	How do you feel about that whole different developer thing?
1156000	1158000	It was fine
1158000	1160000	The one that they did, Insect Armageddon
1160000	1162000	It was different
1162000	1164000	I liked it, it was alright
1164000	1166000	It got kind of boring after a while
1166000	1168000	The only reason that game was boring
1168000	1170000	Was because it had two levels in it
1170000	1172000	And it was also kind of hard to
1172000	1174000	Level up
1174000	1176000	Whereas the other games you kind of get weapons
1176000	1178000	By just grinding the levels
1178000	1180000	Whereas this you had to grind money to buy weapons
1180000	1182000	And that kind of sucked
1182000	1184000	But
1184000	1186000	I'll play it
1186000	1188000	I still haven't played much of Earth Defense
1188000	1190000	I need to go back to Earth Defense Force 4
1190000	1192000	Or 4.1
1192000	1194000	Because I have that and I have the DLC for it
1194000	1196000	I just haven't really played much into it
1196000	1198000	I'll do that this week because I need to go back
1198000	1200000	You know Gabe, our buddy from
1200000	1202000	I almost said Niantic
1202000	1204000	Nascent Games
1204000	1206000	Gave here locally, he loves that series
1206000	1208000	Yeah, we'll have to seriously
1208000	1210000	That was the other thing
1210000	1212000	The co-op
1212000	1214000	In 4.1 they have 4 player co-op
1214000	1216000	But that was the first game that had
1216000	1218000	More than just
1218000	1220000	2 player co-op and same screen
1220000	1222000	So that was kind of fun
1222000	1224000	I hate to backtrack a little bit
1224000	1226000	It's just the two of us tonight
1226000	1228000	And it's going to be a shorter show if I don't do some tangents
1228000	1230000	So I'm reading the comments in chat
1230000	1232000	And they're talking a little bit about Death Stranding
1232000	1234000	And now I'm stuck on this
1234000	1236000	As long as we're talking about this
1236000	1238000	Art, avant-garde, fucking weird ass video game
1238000	1240000	Here's the fucking dream team collaboration
1240000	1242000	I want to see
1242000	1244000	The Guillermo del Toro and Hideo Kojima thing
1244000	1246000	I'm here for that, that's going to be awesome
1246000	1248000	I want to see a game that fucking David Lynch makes
1248000	1252000	Can you fucking imagine
1252000	1254000	A David Lynch video game
1254000	1256000	Would that be like a David Cage game?
1256000	1258000	You know like the
1258000	1260000	Detroit, was it
1260000	1262000	Oh
1262000	1264000	It's some Detroit, I can't remember
1264000	1266000	Even, no I think
1266000	1268000	I can't remember the name, but the androids or whatever
1268000	1270000	I think it would be even weirder than that
1270000	1272000	Like Heavy Rain
1272000	1274000	Like press X to go to the next level
1274000	1276000	And then you press X, you press the O button
1276000	1278000	You are dead, like it's just weird shit that would happen
1278000	1280000	And then everybody would talk back
1280000	1282000	Fuck you, I pushed X
1282000	1284000	Tigerclaw suggests
1284000	1286000	maybe a Twin Peaks game, I don't know if I would
1286000	1288000	want it to be that direct
1288000	1290000	I feel like, how about a
1290000	1292000	Lost Highway game
1292000	1294000	Because that movie was fucked up
1294000	1296000	So maybe something like that, I don't know
1296000	1298000	We'll see
1298000	1300000	S200mad says I don't think our minds can process
1300000	1302000	a David Lynch game, it would have to be
1302000	1304000	a point and click adventure
1304000	1306000	Raginator suggests David Lynch and David Hader
1306000	1308000	Yes, perfect, perfect
1308000	1310000	All the Davids in a game, anyway
1310000	1312000	I apologize for my tangent
1314000	1316000	It was a thought I had to get out of my system
1316000	1318000	Alright
1318000	1320000	So let's follow that up with
1320000	1322000	Idolmaster, Stella Stage
1322000	1324000	is going to be out at the end of the year, December 31st in Japan
1324000	1326000	How about the big
1326000	1328000	It's out now moment
1328000	1330000	Which was ruined a little bit by a
1330000	1332000	rating that was out there earlier in the day
1332000	1334000	But eh, Final Fantasy 9
1334000	1336000	was the surprise release
1337000	1339000	And here they kind of did
1339000	1341000	Kinda, I was more like Final Fantasy 16
1341000	1343000	should be Final Fantasy 15's engine
1343000	1345000	but a Final Fantasy 9 type story
1345000	1347000	And here's Final Fantasy 9
1347000	1349000	I liked, see that's what I kind of liked about
1349000	1351000	8 a little bit and even 7
1351000	1353000	Well actually probably 6, 7 and 8
1353000	1355000	It was that whole
1355000	1357000	fantasy
1357000	1359000	It's kind of like a technology
1359000	1361000	and a fantasy setting type thing
1361000	1363000	That was one of the things that drew me into 6
1363000	1365000	Oh shit, it's like fucking Final Fantasy
1365000	1367000	Like it's all fantasy saying but then there's mechs
1367000	1369000	and you know, guns
1369000	1371000	and magic and that was kind of cool
1371000	1373000	that mix
1373000	1375000	I'm not feeling so much of the magic and guns and shit
1375000	1377000	modern day but whatever
1377000	1379000	What was the name of that? Was that the uh
1379000	1381000	Was that, that was one of that
1381000	1383000	that thing they showed right? The new Left Alive
1383000	1385000	Was that it? Or is that, no
1385000	1387000	What was that? Left Alive is a, yeah
1387000	1389000	That's the new game that I know has artwork by the guy
1389000	1391000	that did Melior Solid
1391000	1393000	Yoshi Shinkawa, and it's a shooter
1393000	1395000	from Square Enix. I just remember because you know
1395000	1397000	we're talking a lot about like oh it's kind of updates
1397000	1399000	and things but there was some new stuff
1399000	1401000	that they showed at this and that was one of them
1401000	1403000	And they showed a new trailer for
1403000	1405000	Dissidia NT
1405000	1407000	Which now of course, no big surprise
1407000	1409000	They have characters from Final Fantasy 15
1409000	1411000	in it so
1411000	1413000	Noctis I think, yeah
1413000	1415000	A lot of impressive VR stuff too
1415000	1417000	They showed, the VR segment
1417000	1419000	was pretty meaty
1419000	1421000	That was kind of nice to see Sony really
1421000	1423000	I think that's part of why I walked away
1423000	1425000	feeling favorable from what I saw at Tokyo Game Show
1425000	1427000	because I really feel like okay, Sony
1427000	1429000	is really investing in VR
1429000	1431000	It kind of showed in a way
1431000	1433000	It's not a Vita
1433000	1435000	Yeah, yeah, well yeah
1435000	1437000	That's kind of why I'm happy
1437000	1439000	Sony really is planning these other things
1439000	1441000	And I guess it felt maybe more exciting for me
1441000	1443000	than like E3 which is when we found
1443000	1445000	out the Final Fantasy game was fishing
1445000	1447000	They just really needed to bring the hardware price down
1447000	1449000	They did, in Japan
1449000	1451000	I think they did recently here too
1451000	1453000	So it is coming down
1453000	1455000	They need to push it more because I think it would be
1455000	1457000	you know, get more people involved in it
1457000	1459000	Let's see, Arc Park
1459000	1461000	was something that they were showing on VR
1461000	1463000	Gran Turismo Sport which obviously is going to be beautiful
1463000	1465000	The Zone of the Inner's thing we talked about
1465000	1467000	Niko Atsume which I joked about earlier
1467000	1469000	Let's see, Niko Niko
1469000	1471000	which is, you know, it's not really big here
1471000	1473000	but it's a YouTube, Twitch-esque
1473000	1475000	type of thing that they have in Japan
1475000	1477000	A lot of events happen on there
1477000	1479000	I couldn't believe that series is still around
1479000	1481000	A-Train has been around since like the...
1481000	1483000	I hope they release that over here
1483000	1485000	They've done some A-Train games
1485000	1487000	have been out over here
1487000	1489000	Train Sims are way
1489000	1491000	Train Sims are way bigger in Japan
1491000	1493000	I'm surprised Farm Sim hasn't gone
1493000	1495000	VR yet, but that might be something coming
1495000	1497000	Gran Turismo Sport looks cool though
1497000	1499000	Let's see, and
1499000	1501000	which I thought was something interesting
1501000	1503000	they also were pushing a Japan Studio
1503000	1505000	VR music festival and digital
1505000	1507000	theatre where you could be like in a concert
1507000	1509000	in PlayStation VR
1509000	1511000	so PlayStation VR starting
1511000	1513000	to kind of nudge itself a little bit into that
1513000	1515000	life space which
1515000	1517000	you know, not to bring up an old conversation
1517000	1519000	but I will, which is why
1519000	1521000	we speculate Facebook had bought Oculus
1521000	1523000	all that time ago is that maybe it was not just
1523000	1525000	that VR is for gaming, but VR is for life
1525000	1527000	experiences and being able to
1527000	1529000	be right in the middle of an experience
1529000	1531000	so now you see kind of Sony doing that a little bit
1531000	1533000	with PlayStation VR and this is something
1533000	1535000	you know, this is an entry
1535000	1537000	level VR thing for a lot of people
1537000	1539000	and so it's kind of neat that they're selling this
1539000	1541000	kind of different experience, this is in addition to
1541000	1543000	3-ray Blu-rays, they don't really make
1543000	1545000	movies in 360 degree just yet
1545000	1547000	but maybe Sony will have
1547000	1549000	a live show at a Sony theatre
1549000	1551000	and I'm not just talking about concerts, maybe like, I don't know
1551000	1553000	a Cirque du Soleil or a stage play
1553000	1555000	or something that maybe they'll put in VR someday
1555000	1557000	We'll see, could be interesting
1557000	1559000	could be interesting, or what about
1559000	1561000	what about y'all
1561000	1563000	if the next E3
1563000	1565000	Sony does their press conference
1565000	1567000	but you can watch it in VR
1567000	1569000	and like you're there
1569000	1571000	in the actual arena
1571000	1573000	maybe, yeah
1573000	1575000	I'd still rather watch it on screen because it's mostly trailers
1575000	1577000	but yeah
1577000	1579000	I still think doing home on PlayStation VR
1579000	1581000	is something they should do
1581000	1583000	but what would be cool is if in those trailers
1583000	1585000	like VR trailers, it's VR
1585000	1587000	like how they have the 3D trailers at the movies
1587000	1589000	where those trailers are in 3D
1589000	1591000	where some are not in 3D
1591000	1593000	Bobby Blackwolf, speaking of home, is pointing out in chat
1593000	1595000	over at live.fognetwork.com
1595000	1597000	Hey Loki, did you notice that SteamVR Home
1597000	1599000	now allows you to put the
1599000	1601000	trophies you earn in games
1601000	1603000	into your home space? Valve is greater than Sony
1603000	1605000	First off, I didn't realize there was a SteamVR Home
1605000	1607000	and yes, yes
1607000	1609000	they win obviously
1609000	1611000	because they were able to fulfill a promise
1611000	1613000	the only thing I worry about
1613000	1615000	well, I guess you can put select trophies in there
1615000	1617000	because if it's all trophies, there's some of these games nowadays
1617000	1619000	that just kick out trophies like
1619000	1621000	like crazy, so
1621000	1623000	you're just like, ah shit, there's trophies all over me
1623000	1625000	but
1625000	1627000	yeah, it's cool that you can put that stuff in there
1627000	1629000	can you visit other people's homes in there?
1629000	1631000	I mean, is there a point to it? Can you do a clubhouse
1631000	1633000	type of thing in SteamVR because that was
1633000	1635000	always, I felt like, a really missed opportunity
1635000	1637000	within PlayStation Home
1637000	1639000	well actually later on, I remember when we had that
1639000	1641000	listener, and I don't think he listens anymore, we had that guy
1641000	1643000	who set up a really fancy VOG clubhouse
1643000	1645000	and I was like, oh this is pretty cool, but like
1645000	1647000	it would be even cooler if I could
1647000	1649000	inject my own pictures into this
1649000	1651000	or audio, so we could play audio clips
1651000	1653000	from OLR or something in other
1653000	1655000	VOG shows when you're visiting the space
1655000	1657000	like, why
1657000	1659000	and I suppose they're probably worried
1659000	1661000	well, if we let people upload any old pictures
1661000	1663000	there'll just be titties everywhere
1663000	1665000	and if we let people upload audio, it'll be a copyright nightmare
1665000	1667000	but, you know
1667000	1669000	YouTube does it somehow
1669000	1671000	and it works, so it was somewhat
1671000	1673000	barely, anyway
1673000	1675000	yeah, and Bobby Blackwolf says
1675000	1677000	yes, you can visit others, you can start up a
1677000	1679000	SteamVR space and anybody can join it, or you can make your
1679000	1681000	friends only, you can even make a
1681000	1683000	custom SteamVR space, it uses
1683000	1685000	Workshop, so there you go
1685000	1687000	anyway, it's not supposed to be all about
1687000	1689000	Valve right now, it's supposed to be about Sony
1689000	1691000	but, um
1691000	1693000	well it's not my fault if Sony is not supporting
1693000	1695000	certain things that they promised several years ago
1695000	1697000	that they would support, there was an update on
1697000	1699000	Detroit, which looks like an awesome game, I'm excited
1699000	1701000	about that, a Virtual On
1701000	1703000	crossover, which I thought was
1703000	1705000	yeah, that was weird, yeah
1705000	1707000	and then, let's see
1707000	1709000	a new channel called Animax
1709000	1711000	which is going to be on the Playstation 4
1711000	1713000	which is, I guess, anime, all day every day
1713000	1715000	is it anime and skinimax?
1715000	1717000	mixed together? one can hope
1717000	1719000	maybe Animax After Dark, who knows
1719000	1721000	and last but not least, the last big thing
1721000	1723000	they showed for the day was
1723000	1725000	Monster Hunter World, and the big reveal
1725000	1727000	of the release date, January 26th
1727000	1729000	next year, obviously
1729000	1731000	2018, and it is going to be a
1731000	1733000	simultaneous worldwide release
1733000	1735000	so US, Europe, all the other
1735000	1737000	places, getting it the exact same
1737000	1739000	day, there will be a Monster Hunter
1739000	1741000	Playstation 4 Pro released
1741000	1743000	in Japan, that I think comes out a little
1743000	1745000	sooner, I don't think it actually comes out, I think comes out
1745000	1747000	like in the next couple months, so
1747000	1749000	you know, if you're an ultimate Monster Hunter fan
1749000	1751000	you can get something a little bit sooner, so
1751000	1753000	yeah, that was some of the big stuff out of Tokyo Game
1753000	1755000	Show, so that's one of those shows
1755000	1757000	I'd love to go to someday, maybe
1757000	1759000	maybe, maybe
1759000	1761000	alright, I'm fine, I'm a little worried
1761000	1763000	about the fact that, you know, I don't speak a lick of
1763000	1765000	Japanese, but hopefully I'd have a friend or something
1765000	1767000	that could help me out that does speak it
1767000	1769000	and, you know, so I don't get lost
1769000	1771000	okay, so one of the other things I was gonna mention too
1771000	1773000	that they were showing off, I think was that
1773000	1775000	PlayLink stuff, so that was the
1775000	1777000	where you use your cell phones as a controller, basically
1777000	1779000	oh, yeah, yeah, they brought them, so they had
1779000	1781000	a hidden agenda, which is a new game
1781000	1783000	as it did, that was, okay, here's the thing
1783000	1785000	that was at E3, but
1785000	1787000	do you remember how they had like an hour
1787000	1789000	or a half hour, like
1789000	1791000	pre-game before the press conference?
1791000	1793000	hidden agenda was in the pre-game
1793000	1795000	remember one of our big complaints about E3 was that
1795000	1797000	like, all the rad stuff was in the pre-game
1797000	1799000	that's when they announced Undertale was coming to Playstation 4
1799000	1801000	but that was all in the pre-game, so hidden agenda was in
1801000	1803000	that pre-game, but this was
1803000	1805000	its first Japanese unveiling, I guess
1805000	1807000	or confirmation
1807000	1809000	yeah, no, I mean, the game looks really cool
1809000	1811000	and like, it was showing the whole concept where like
1811000	1813000	one person is a traitor on the team, right
1813000	1815000	trying to
1815000	1817000	skim through a lot of that
1817000	1819000	that's okay, hence the name hidden agenda
1819000	1821000	one of the players is trying to screw all the others
1821000	1823000	so it's that, it's betrayal at House on the Hill
1823000	1825000	so it's you don't know Jack!
1825000	1827000	yeah, kind of
1827000	1829000	so, yeah, anyway
1829000	1831000	I enjoyed the Sony press conference and considering that
1831000	1833000	I was ready to just kind of go, oh, it's gonna be
1833000	1835000	you know, it's gonna be a lot of the Japan
1835000	1837000	games and stuff we never get to play here
1837000	1839000	considering I was kind of going into it with that mindset
1839000	1841000	that I wasn't really gonna see anything, I didn't even
1841000	1843000	think I'd end up watching the whole thing, I figured I'd turn it off
1843000	1845000	after 20 minutes, but I watched the whole thing
1845000	1847000	and I was like, oh, this is a really good show
1847000	1849000	good job, Sony
1849000	1851000	I felt better going out of that than I did at E3
1851000	1853000	so, I was happy
1853000	1855000	alright, we'll get into some
1855000	1857000	more stories in just a moment, but first
1857000	1859000	I wanna talk about our gaming weeks
1859000	1861000	and the types of video games that you've been playing
1861000	1863000	this week, DarkSakura not here to share
1863000	1865000	her week with us, but I'm sure it involved
1865000	1867000	lots of Dragon Ball
1867000	1869000	what is the one she's playing
1869000	1871000	online, I can't remember
1871000	1873000	Z2, oh, no, I'll tell you what
1873000	1875000	she's playing is that idle pouring game still
1875000	1877000	she got me fucking playing it too
1877000	1879000	yeah, and joining her guild, it's the
1879000	1881000	Ragnarok clicker game
1881000	1883000	but you don't really click in it
1883000	1885000	but anyway, so that
1885000	1887000	yeah, that's like
1887000	1889000	mine, it's, you know what, I'll say this
1889000	1891000	for one of those clicker games, it's pretty well done
1891000	1893000	although the translation
1893000	1895000	is a little hit and miss, but you can follow it
1895000	1897000	well enough, so you like join guilds?
1897000	1899000	yeah, you can join guilds with other people
1899000	1901000	and yeah, leaderboards and stuff like that
1901000	1903000	so there's a lot of in-depth to it
1903000	1905000	but of course it's all more ways
1905000	1907000	to have more items that you need the special currency
1907000	1909000	to buy, but I haven't spent any real
1909000	1911000	money on it yet, and don't plan to, so we'll see
1911000	1913000	anyway, but that's enough about that
1913000	1915000	how about your gaming week, Logie?
1915000	1917000	so I mainly, well this is funny enough
1917000	1919000	that we talk about idle games, I mainly played
1919000	1921000	the office space idle game, and I've actually
1921000	1923000	finished it, so
1923000	1925000	basically the whole objective of the
1925000	1927000	main game is to get to level 100 where you
1927000	1929000	become the CEO of Inateck, and
1929000	1931000	I've done that, and so
1931000	1933000	now it's just
1933000	1935000	why do I need to play this game anymore?
1935000	1937000	I don't, so
1937000	1939000	I've been playing, like they do these little events
1939000	1941000	and stuff, so you play like
1941000	1943000	almost like a separate game, where they kind of
1943000	1945000	change up the rules a little bit
1945000	1947000	and so I've been doing that to unlock more
1947000	1949000	cards, because you can assign
1949000	1951000	characters to each of your floors
1951000	1953000	and you get different bonuses
1953000	1955000	based on which characters are in the
1955000	1957000	floors, so
1957000	1959000	it's kind of a little bit like
1959000	1961000	I don't know, there's not much clicking with
1961000	1963000	in fact, actually they've really
1963000	1965000	nerfed any of the clicking in the game
1965000	1967000	so it's, you may do that
1967000	1969000	in the beginning, or do
1969000	1971000	that for your daily, trying to get 100
1971000	1973000	critical clicks or whatever
1973000	1975000	but aside from that, you're not
1975000	1977000	really, it's more of just management
1977000	1979000	and just trying to
1979000	1981000	you know, I don't know
1981000	1983000	strategy, and there's a lot of strategy involved
1983000	1985000	with it, so I played that
1985000	1987000	I didn't play
1987000	1989000	a whole ton of console games, it's mainly just
1989000	1991000	played a little bit more of the Lego movie
1991000	1993000	game
1993000	1995000	but I'm probably gonna stop playing that
1995000	1997000	because I finished it already, and I don't really
1997000	1999000	want Grind to get all the extra characters, because I
1999000	2001000	just don't care, but
2001000	2003000	Fair enough. I mean, I kind of wanted the
2003000	2005000	achievements for it, but
2005000	2007000	You don't want to platinum that bad, huh?
2007000	2009000	Well, it's not even on the PlayStation
2009000	2011000	it's on Steam, so I
2011000	2013000	I don't care, it doesn't really matter
2013000	2015000	but, yeah, it was fun
2015000	2017000	I thought about getting the Ninjago game
2017000	2019000	because it came out bad, because the movie just came out
2019000	2021000	but I think I'll just wait for the Lego Marvel
2021000	2023000	2 game that's gonna be coming out in the fall
2023000	2025000	and then of course South Park's in like a couple weeks
2025000	2027000	so, yeah
2027000	2029000	I probably will end up playing that next
2029000	2031000	but yeah, like I said, I need
2031000	2033000	to go back to Earth Defense Force 4.1
2033000	2035000	so I'll probably end up doing that, because
2035000	2037000	I haven't played that in a while
2037000	2039000	I do need to play some more VR, though
2039000	2041000	I need to finish, or actually play
2041000	2043000	Superhot VR
2043000	2045000	because I have that now
2045000	2047000	I've been meaning to try it, but every time I go
2047000	2049000	I don't really want to set it up
2049000	2051000	so, it's just laziness
2051000	2053000	that's preventing me from playing that
2053000	2055000	That's it. Alright
2055000	2057000	My gaming week, I gotta admit
2057000	2059000	not a lot of new stuff this week
2059000	2061000	I did play Super Metroid after the
2061000	2063000	show last week, and
2063000	2065000	I actually did do a follow-up stream
2065000	2067000	so, not everybody probably saw it
2067000	2069000	because it was late at night on Wednesday or Thursday, but I did do a follow-up stream
2069000	2071000	and I got so lost
2071000	2073000	and I was kind of embarrassed, because I'm like
2073000	2075000	for as much as I love this game, it was like, wow
2075000	2077000	I was really running around in circles
2077000	2079000	I was like, I could not fucking remember what I had to do
2079000	2081000	at one point, so
2081000	2083000	I think I need to make it a goal to
2083000	2085000	play through that game once a year
2085000	2087000	to just keep my
2087000	2089000	skills up and remember where
2089000	2091000	everything is and stuff, and not be like
2091000	2093000	is this when I get the ice beam?
2093000	2095000	So anyway, so I did have
2095000	2097000	fun with that, and I've been playing a little bit of
2097000	2099000	Overwatch this week, because they had the
2099000	2101000	free weekend going on, and I just
2101000	2103000	I don't know, I was into it. I actually downloaded it on
2103000	2105000	Xbox One. I've been meaning to try
2105000	2107000	because I think it went free to play
2107000	2109000	was that whole Fortnite
2109000	2111000	do they have the battle royale Fortnite that's
2111000	2113000	out now? That's something I should
2113000	2115000	probably check out, because that's free. Isn't that free on consoles too?
2115000	2117000	I think it does have a
2117000	2119000	free to play version, I think the battle royale thing
2119000	2121000	is in early access, we'll get into that in a little while
2121000	2123000	but it's going to come up in the news later
2123000	2125000	but anyway, yeah
2125000	2127000	free to play is great, but Overwatch
2127000	2129000	not free to play, but they did have a free weekend
2129000	2131000	so I finally downloaded it to my Xbox One
2131000	2133000	so I can say I've played it on
2133000	2135000	every system that it's on now
2135000	2137000	so I've played PlayStation 4, I've played PC
2137000	2139000	I didn't buy it on Xbox One, sorry
2139000	2141000	it's not really cheap enough for me to
2141000	2143000	triple dip on Overwatch, but
2143000	2145000	I just thought it would be fun to download it
2145000	2147000	and I got all my loot boxes from the Twitch Prime
2147000	2149000	thing, they just showed up automatically
2149000	2151000	on Xbox, so that was kind of cool
2151000	2153000	so yeah, there was that
2153000	2155000	that was something I played this week
2155000	2157000	and then I played a lot of Pokemon Go today
2157000	2159000	because of the Equinox event
2159000	2161000	so I played
2161000	2163000	yeah, I played a lot of that
2163000	2165000	and got Stardust and did like
2165000	2167000	four raids today, so
2167000	2169000	busy with that
2169000	2171000	yeah, that's really
2171000	2173000	continuing to do some Heroes of the Storm
2173000	2175000	but otherwise, that's pretty much been my game of the week
2175000	2177000	alright
2177000	2179000	nothing really new this week, sadly
2179000	2181000	going to our chat over at
2181000	2183000	live.vognetwork.com, tigercaw in chat says
2183000	2185000	have you been playing Samus Returns?
2185000	2187000	thank you for bringing that up
2187000	2189000	not enough, I need to play more of it
2189000	2191000	but I just, yeah
2191000	2193000	when I, like the time for me to play
2193000	2195000	DS games is when I'm like lying in bed
2195000	2197000	about ready to go to sleep and maybe I'll play a game
2197000	2199000	before I go to sleep, but lately
2199000	2201000	this week it's just been, I'm gonna lie down and
2201000	2203000	snore
2203000	2205000	so I don't ever really get around to playing the game
2205000	2207000	I need to kind of like force myself to just sit down
2207000	2209000	and spend more time with Samus Returns
2209000	2211000	because I really did enjoy the part of
2211000	2213000	what I played
2213000	2215000	Corkay is in our chat right now saying
2215000	2217000	Fortnite is not free yet
2217000	2219000	they still want you to buy the early access stuff
2219000	2221000	but I think that's in the
2221000	2223000	long term plan
2223000	2225000	I thought the Battle Royale portion was free to play
2225000	2227000	I think it will be, I don't think it is yet
2227000	2229000	alright, let's get into some
2229000	2231000	housekeeping real quick and then we will do
2231000	2233000	some news, housekeeping this week
2233000	2235000	follow us on Twitter, twitter.com
2235000	2237000	slash o-l-r, we're also on Facebook
2237000	2239000	facebook.com slash orange lounge
2239000	2241000	radio
2241000	2243000	I want to mention the Discord too, I think I did earlier
2243000	2245000	in the show but I realized last week on our
2245000	2247000	big 700th episode, I forgot to freaking mention it
2247000	2249000	so we do have a new Discord server
2249000	2251000	check it out at vognetwork.com
2251000	2253000	slash Discord, that's just gonna
2253000	2255000	that just forwards you to the
2255000	2257000	Discord with the invite code because you don't need an invite
2257000	2259000	it's open though, you don't need like a special
2259000	2261000	invitation, this is your special invitation
2261000	2263000	go to vognetwork.com slash Discord and you can join
2263000	2265000	and you get updates on the
2265000	2267000	shows and you can also like submit
2267000	2269000	stories and there's just like some general
2269000	2271000	chat and when we were doing, I was sad
2271000	2273000	because I archived the DragonCon channel today
2273000	2275000	but when we were at DragonCon, you know
2275000	2277000	we were posting pictures and live updates from that
2277000	2279000	so it's been a lot of fun, it's been a good experiment
2279000	2281000	so yeah, check that out
2281000	2283000	and then also some of our
2283000	2285000	streamers are using it for their
2285000	2287000	voice chat, like when I was doing
2287000	2289000	I did an impromptu late night
2289000	2291000	Overwatch stream on Twitch
2291000	2293000	Friday night or Saturday night
2293000	2295000	I don't remember
2295000	2297000	I didn't start the stream until like midnight
2297000	2299000	it was like an Insomniac feed
2299000	2301000	but Flaco was up and so we started playing
2301000	2303000	together and we were having a hilarious time because he was playing
2303000	2305000	on PC because it's the free weekend on PC
2305000	2307000	so he just joined the voice chat
2307000	2309000	on the VoG Discord and we were able to both talk
2309000	2311000	and you know, can be heard on the feed
2311000	2313000	so it was fun!
2313000	2315000	Cool. So there's that.
2315000	2317000	Another thing I want to give a plug for
2317000	2319000	real quick is I want to give a shout out to
2319000	2321000	the Pokemon Go podcast
2321000	2323000	because you know
2323000	2325000	Charles, who's one of the hosts over there
2325000	2327000	and I know Joe too
2327000	2329000	Charles and I have been talking
2329000	2331000	for a while about me doing some type of like
2331000	2333000	segment thing on the show
2333000	2335000	so I did a segment this week
2335000	2337000	so you can check that out on their latest episode, episode 62
2337000	2339000	so I did like a little 5 minute segment
2339000	2341000	about, since I have played
2341000	2343000	a lot of Ingress, I kind of
2343000	2345000	still keep tabs on what's going on there
2345000	2347000	and kind of talking about what happening there
2347000	2349000	and how that might relate to Pokemon Go
2349000	2351000	so yeah, it was fun
2351000	2353000	and they were very nice and they played it on the show
2353000	2355000	so check it out, so it's episode 62
2355000	2357000	I think is where that shows up
2357000	2359000	and I'm hoping to do that, if not every week
2359000	2361000	if there's not enough news every week, maybe every other week
2361000	2363000	I have a little segment there that I'll be
2363000	2365000	sending over to those guys
2365000	2367000	so big shout out and thank you to them!
2367000	2369000	Alright, let's move on
2369000	2371000	for some gaming news, Loki!
2371000	2373000	So Steam is changing up
2373000	2375000	how they're doing
2375000	2377000	their review scores
2377000	2379000	basically
2379000	2381000	what's been happening lately
2381000	2383000	with a lot of different games is
2383000	2385000	they've been getting review bombed
2385000	2387000	so for example, when
2387000	2389000	there was the announcement that
2389000	2391000	there was going to be the in-game
2391000	2393000	microtransactions with
2393000	2395000	the new Shadow of War game
2395000	2397000	when there was
2397000	2399000	the whole backlash
2399000	2401000	with the Firewatch devs
2401000	2403000	Campo Santo
2403000	2405000	basically saying that we're going to flag
2405000	2407000	PewDiePie because of his
2407000	2409000	racist comments
2409000	2411000	there was a backlash against that
2411000	2413000	where fans of PewDiePie
2413000	2415000	were going and review
2415000	2417000	bombing Firewatch
2417000	2419000	or
2419000	2421000	NBA 2K 18
2421000	2423000	because of their microtransactions
2423000	2425000	and that kind of stuff
2425000	2427000	basically what this is going to do
2427000	2429000	is it's going to kind of give you a history
2429000	2431000	so they call it a histogram
2431000	2433000	where it kind of shows you
2433000	2435000	where the
2435000	2437000	reviews kind of went down
2437000	2439000	where it's fluctuated
2439000	2441000	so for example, you can see
2441000	2443000	this was tied with this event
2443000	2445000	and so on and so forth
2445000	2447000	so it's still going to show those negative reviews
2447000	2449000	it's just going to kind of give you a bigger picture
2449000	2451000	to see, oh was this because
2451000	2453000	a recent patch has always been negative
2453000	2455000	what's
2455000	2457000	kind of the case with this?
2457000	2459000	do you think it's going to help
2459000	2461000	the review bombing or whatever?
2461000	2463000	no, I don't think it's going to do anything
2463000	2465000	much like anything Steam does
2465000	2467000	it doesn't really help
2467000	2469000	Steam is such a
2469000	2471000	it's such a mess now
2471000	2473000	I think in some ways Steam is a victim of its own success
2473000	2475000	I don't really know how to eloquently
2475000	2477000	more put it than that
2477000	2479000	but I feel like Steam kind of needs to find its focus
2479000	2481000	Steam has kind of been trying to bite off
2481000	2483000	a lot
2483000	2485000	between the whole, they started to build streaming
2485000	2487000	remember how Steam has streaming in it?
2487000	2489000	and with the workshop
2489000	2491000	and the reviews
2491000	2493000	and the curators
2493000	2495000	there's so many elements to Steam
2495000	2497000	I really feel like Steam needs to have a whole
2497000	2499000	what are we
2499000	2501000	going to be first and foremost?
2501000	2503000	are we a store? or are we a social network?
2503000	2505000	I don't know
2505000	2507000	they're working on lots of different changes
2507000	2509000	but I don't know
2509000	2511000	it doesn't seem like a lot of it helps
2511000	2513000	but at the very least
2513000	2515000	the whole Campo Santo thing
2515000	2517000	that's kind of unfair I feel
2517000	2519000	the backlash with that
2519000	2521000	however the shadow of war
2521000	2523000	and the 2K18 stuff
2523000	2525000	sorry
2525000	2527000	maybe if you didn't do dickish things
2527000	2529000	people wouldn't act like dicks to you
2529000	2531000	so I don't feel bad for them
2531000	2533000	but it's fine
2533000	2535000	why doesn't Steam
2535000	2537000	and I realize Steam calls out
2537000	2539000	this is somebody who actually bought the game
2539000	2541000	or has a key or whatever
2541000	2543000	the only way the people who have actually bought the game
2543000	2545000	they really should
2545000	2547000	well because I guess you could
2547000	2549000	theoretically purchase it on our platform
2549000	2551000	or like another
2551000	2553000	non-Steam
2553000	2555000	platform or something
2555000	2557000	but who cares?
2557000	2559000	I know this is going to be controversial but tough titty
2559000	2561000	just only allow the people
2561000	2563000	that bought it on Steam
2563000	2565000	not even the promo keys
2565000	2567000	only the people who bought it on Steam spent money
2567000	2569000	get to write reviews that are weighted
2569000	2571000	let anybody write
2571000	2573000	a review for whatever
2573000	2575000	but only the ones who actually bought it on Steam
2575000	2577000	are weighted
2577000	2579000	and you know what?
2579000	2581000	what would be the problem with that?
2581000	2583000	oh no
2583000	2585000	people are going to review bomb my game
2585000	2587000	by buying the game over and over again
2587000	2589000	and leaving reviews
2589000	2591000	I'm saying don't let the codes either
2591000	2593000	and I fully realize
2593000	2595000	that this is going to screw Kickstarter stuff
2595000	2597000	because a lot of Kickstarter stuff
2597000	2599000	goes through
2599000	2601000	Kickstarter campaigns
2601000	2603000	but you know what?
2603000	2605000	as the old saying goes
2605000	2607000	you can't make an omelet without breaking eggs
2607000	2609000	like the Steam store
2609000	2611000	and the whole review system is kind of screwed up
2611000	2613000	and so
2613000	2615000	I think they just need to make some decisions that may not be popular
2615000	2617000	but I think we'll clean it up
2617000	2619000	a lot
2619000	2621000	this kind of shit happens on iOS and Android
2621000	2623000	and their review sites and everything
2623000	2625000	so it's like
2625000	2627000	grow up, you're a publisher
2627000	2629000	publishing a game
2629000	2631000	fucking grow up and deal with this shit
2631000	2633000	so what?
2633000	2635000	people don't like a decision you make
2635000	2637000	hmm, maybe take that to the bank and figure out
2637000	2639000	oh, maybe we shouldn't do that next time
2639000	2641000	how about that?
2641000	2643000	because even in the case of
2643000	2645000	the Firewatch devs
2645000	2647000	yeah, you know
2647000	2649000	you are well within your right to, I guess
2649000	2651000	copyright strike something
2651000	2653000	however, it's kind of
2653000	2655000	fucked up being that on your website
2655000	2657000	you say, oh, you can go ahead and use our stuff
2657000	2659000	and it's kind of silly to do that
2659000	2661000	for a video that he made
2661000	2663000	a long time ago, it wasn't like
2663000	2665000	he was playing that game and then he dropped the
2665000	2667000	N-bomb, it was a totally
2667000	2669000	different, it's just, it's such a weird
2669000	2671000	that video still generates revenue
2671000	2673000	and so, you know
2673000	2675000	they don't want to be associated with him, you know
2675000	2677000	I think people forget that a lot of these
2677000	2679000	game companies are doing a favor
2679000	2681000	I don't think they would think that they're
2681000	2683000	associated with him, so he played one of their games
2683000	2685000	big deal, you could just say
2685000	2687000	I think, you know, what he said was terrible
2687000	2689000	leave it at that, done
2689000	2691000	no one, you don't have to go
2691000	2693000	any further, you were just an angry person
2693000	2695000	using the system incorrectly
2695000	2697000	because it's not a copyright strike
2697000	2699000	you gave
2699000	2701000	express copyright to these people
2701000	2703000	so
2703000	2705000	I'm sorry, you
2705000	2707000	get upset, that's it
2707000	2709000	I want to move on, but respectfully
2709000	2711000	I disagree because, again, I think
2711000	2713000	a lot, I think this whole
2713000	2715000	streaming situation could be a lot worse
2715000	2717000	when it comes to the copyrights than it is
2717000	2719000	I think a lot, I mean, look at what Nintendo does
2719000	2721000	I think Nintendo's an example of, you know, kind of
2721000	2723000	doing a lot of the worst of it, and a lot
2723000	2725000	of game companies could be doing that, but they're not
2725000	2727000	because I think they do realize, for the most
2727000	2729000	part, there's a lot of great publicity that comes from
2729000	2731000	gaming, but at the same time
2731000	2733000	we have a real fucking
2733000	2735000	big problem in this industry
2735000	2737000	right now with the toxic culture in gaming
2737000	2739000	and that particular
2739000	2741000	streamer is an excellent
2741000	2743000	example of that problem
2743000	2745000	and so for a game company to put their foot
2745000	2747000	down and say, you know what, fuck this
2747000	2749000	we're not going to be associated with this toxic shit
2749000	2751000	no matter if it's
2751000	2753000	you know, dated or whatever
2753000	2755000	the semantics may be
2755000	2757000	I'm okay with them
2757000	2759000	having done that, because
2759000	2761000	I stream video games
2761000	2763000	I kind of think the game developers are
2763000	2765000	doing us a big favor by letting us get away
2765000	2767000	with it, and making the amount of money
2767000	2769000	we do off games, and if someday
2769000	2771000	they come down and say, you know what Rob, you're going to have to
2771000	2773000	share a bigger chunk of
2773000	2775000	your revenue with the game makers, I'll be
2775000	2777000	fine with it, I'm not going to throw a hissy fit
2777000	2779000	as long as it's
2779000	2781000	as long as it is transparent
2781000	2783000	and clear, and the rules
2783000	2785000	are known, and you know
2785000	2787000	if a competitor has different rules then they are
2787000	2789000	known, as long as everything is
2789000	2791000	you know, out there
2791000	2793000	then I'm fine with it
2793000	2795000	you know what though, even if they do that kind of stuff
2795000	2797000	there's plenty of other games out there, there's so many
2797000	2799000	indie developers that would love the exposure
2799000	2801000	yeah, too bad
2801000	2803000	you know, you want to be a dick about it, and you're a big publisher
2803000	2805000	we don't need a player game
2805000	2807000	you don't need the exposure, you've already basically stated that
2807000	2809000	alright, anyway, I want to move on
2809000	2811000	and try to get back to the topic
2811000	2813000	at hand, which was the Steam reviews
2813000	2815000	and let's see, I want to
2815000	2817000	so, what were they saying here in chat
2817000	2819000	over at live.vognetware.com
2819000	2821000	SG100Matt says, can't they in theory
2821000	2823000	buy the game, review it, and request a refund
2823000	2825000	isn't that something that they're doing?
2825000	2827000	well, if they refund it, pull the review
2827000	2829000	but I think if you're going to abuse
2829000	2831000	that, you know, if you're going to
2831000	2833000	abuse that system, then
2833000	2835000	they may
2835000	2837000	revoke your privileges and do that
2837000	2839000	sorry, MXC says, I don't
2839000	2841000	believe you can review a game if it's not in your Steam
2841000	2843000	library, at least I can't do it when trying to
2843000	2845000	review a random, non-owned game
2845000	2847000	so, but I think you can
2847000	2849000	can't you like, add it through another process
2849000	2851000	you can add it into your Steam library through another
2851000	2853000	process or something like that
2853000	2855000	yeah, I don't know if you can still leave reviews
2855000	2857000	for that
2857000	2859000	alright, anyhow, let's move on
2859000	2861000	in the interest of time, let's talk a little bit about
2861000	2863000	the drama that was going on this week between
2863000	2865000	Player Unknown Battlegrounds and
2865000	2867000	Fortnite, with the whole
2867000	2869000	battle royale mode, and
2869000	2871000	I'm sure a lot of you guys are reading the blogs, you've
2871000	2873000	probably heard about this a little bit, but Fortnite
2873000	2875000	obviously is in an early stage of release
2875000	2877000	going to be going to early access
2877000	2879000	and they said, you know, kind of this week
2879000	2881000	they were talking about how they're dropping
2881000	2883000	a battle royale mode in this
2883000	2885000	and I've actually seen people streaming this, this is
2885000	2887000	something you can already play basically
2887000	2889000	well, the folks that
2889000	2891000	were behind Player Unknown Battlegrounds
2891000	2893000	not happy about what Epic
2893000	2895000	did, saying quote, we've also
2895000	2897000	noticed that Epic Games references Player Unknown
2897000	2899000	Battlegrounds in the promotion of Fortnite
2899000	2901000	to their community and in communications with the
2901000	2903000	press, this was never discussed with us
2903000	2905000	and we don't feel it's right
2905000	2907000	and so on and so on, so this
2907000	2909000	kind of caused a conversation on Twitter
2909000	2911000	and some places about the whole like
2911000	2913000	what are these Fortnite, or excuse me
2913000	2915000	what are these Player Unknown Battlegrounds guys doing?
2915000	2917000	Like, they don't necessarily
2917000	2919000	own the entire genre
2919000	2921000	competition is a good thing, blah blah blah
2921000	2923000	this concept was around
2923000	2925000	before you, blah blah blah
2925000	2927000	It's not necessarily that they're saying that they're
2927000	2929000	stealing the battle royale idea
2929000	2931000	what their problem is, is that they
2931000	2933000	licensed the Unreal Engine from
2933000	2935000	Epic Games, and
2935000	2937000	Epic is basically
2937000	2939000	gonna be making
2939000	2941000	their version of this and they're
2941000	2943000	basically relying on Epic
2943000	2945000	for hardware
2945000	2947000	troubleshooting and that type of stuff
2947000	2949000	troubleshooting with their engine
2949000	2951000	and so they're, I think, worried that
2953000	2955000	I don't know, that basically they're
2955000	2957000	either gonna steal ideas or
2957000	2959000	they're gonna make improvements to the engine
2959000	2961000	and not let this company
2961000	2963000	in on those improvements, I don't know
2963000	2965000	it sounded like a whole bunch of worrying about nothing
2965000	2967000	to me, I mean, it sounded like
2967000	2969000	they're just whining because there's another company
2969000	2971000	trying to come in, but like, exactly
2971000	2973000	the thing, it's like, dude
2973000	2975000	Player Unknown Battlegrounds
2975000	2977000	H1Z1, King of the Kill
2977000	2979000	was like a thing way before that
2979000	2981000	Well, I do want to clarify, because part of what you're
2981000	2983000	pulling from there was a clarification
2983000	2985000	that came out, and I think it's important to say
2985000	2987000	there was a follow-up with
2987000	2989000	the dev team with Player Unknown Battlegrounds
2989000	2991000	that follows up this a little bit, that came out a couple days ago
2991000	2993000	there was an interview with PC Gamer
2993000	2995000	where they say, quote, the first thing, and this is
2995000	2997000	actually an interview with, what's the name
2997000	2999000	CH Kim, who
2999000	3001000	is
3001000	3003000	one of the
3003000	3005000	I think one of the developers of the game
3005000	3007000	oh no, there it is, executive producer, thank you
3007000	3009000	that's Blue Holes VP
3009000	3011000	as well, so CH Kim said, quote
3011000	3013000	the first thing I'd like to clarify is that
3013000	3015000	this is not about the battle royale mode itself
3015000	3017000	there were other BR game modes
3017000	3019000	earlier this year that were released, like Last Man Standing
3019000	3021000	or Grand Theft Auto 5's battle royale game mode
3021000	3023000	and we never raised an issue, and I think it's great
3023000	3025000	that there's more competition and everyone
3025000	3027000	should be able to create their own battle royale game mode
3027000	3029000	it's not about the idea itself, it's
3029000	3031000	about epic games, and that
3031000	3033000	wasn't really clear, so that was a very
3033000	3035000	interesting clarification, which yeah, leads into
3035000	3037000	this whole talk about the Unreal Engine
3037000	3039000	and some of these other points that you brought up, so
3039000	3041000	just to be clear, because I feel like social media
3041000	3043000	didn't capture that follow-up
3043000	3045000	as much as they did the original story
3045000	3047000	and even one of the things that
3047000	3049000	Brendan Greene was saying is, he said
3049000	3051000	other companies of course will come out and
3051000	3053000	enter the marketplace, I just hope that they put
3053000	3055000	their own spin on the game mode and not just
3055000	3057000	make a carbon copy, and honestly
3057000	3059000	I feel that
3059000	3061000	Fortnite has, because they have the whole
3061000	3063000	building aspect of it, you can
3063000	3065000	build a base, although
3065000	3067000	I gotta be honest, with this type of
3067000	3069000	gameplay, it's pretty fast paced
3069000	3071000	it seems like, I don't know if I'm gonna be just
3071000	3073000	hunkered down in a base I build and it's like
3073000	3075000	shit, the battlefield got smaller
3075000	3077000	I guess it's cool for like throwing up some
3077000	3079000	cover or something like that, but
3079000	3081000	you're not gonna get too intricate in building a base
3081000	3083000	and stuff. I watched somebody playing a stream of it
3083000	3085000	the Fortnite Battle Royale, and yeah, they were
3085000	3087000	in a house and they kept taking the roof
3087000	3089000	off the house to kind of see if they could see
3089000	3091000	where the snipers were or what have you, and
3091000	3093000	then they would kind of like, they'd take the roof off a different
3093000	3095000	part of the house, they were kind of like rebuilding the house as they were
3095000	3097000	moving, and then finally some guy came
3097000	3099000	up the stairs in the house and killed him
3099000	3101000	because the guy was too preoccupied with
3101000	3103000	trying to find the other people through the roof
3103000	3105000	so yeah, but it was kind of interesting
3105000	3107000	and I was like, well, what I just described
3107000	3109000	that whole taking off the roof, and again
3109000	3111000	I don't think you could do that.
3111000	3113000	Yeah, so there you go
3113000	3115000	that's how it's a little different. You know what's also
3115000	3117000	interesting, Loki, is I can't help but be reminded
3117000	3119000	of, you know, going back in time
3119000	3121000	the old discussion we used to have on the show
3121000	3123000	about DDR vs. In the Groove, right?
3123000	3125000	Remember that whole thing when In the Groove first
3125000	3127000	came out, and you know, in all
3127000	3129000	honesty, you know, when the game first came out
3129000	3131000	I wasn't a big fan of it, because I felt it was
3131000	3133000	very reductive with DDR.
3133000	3135000	Now, much like
3135000	3137000	people's feelings evolve on things
3137000	3139000	and having talked to Kyle over the years
3139000	3141000	and so forth, my views on In the Groove
3141000	3143000	evolved significantly, and I understand
3143000	3145000	why it was important
3145000	3147000	and how it filled the void that Konami was
3147000	3149000	making, basically, by themselves.
3149000	3151000	But anyway, I digress.
3151000	3153000	I feel that if they didn't have the building
3153000	3155000	stuff aspect of Fortnite
3155000	3157000	and it was just, okay, it's in this
3157000	3159000	art style now, but we're basically copying
3159000	3161000	the gameplay, then yeah, I could see
3161000	3163000	them taking issue with it more, because, okay,
3163000	3165000	this is, you're just basically carbon copying
3165000	3167000	this, you just changed the art style now.
3167000	3169000	But they have more
3169000	3171000	gameplay aspects to it, and
3173000	3175000	you know, it kind of goes back
3175000	3177000	to, like, even Street Fighter 2
3177000	3179000	and, like, the old fighting games.
3179000	3181000	People got pissed, or
3181000	3183000	companies got pissed off because, oh, now
3183000	3185000	there's Mortal Kombat, and now there's all these
3185000	3187000	other fighting games that are basically kind of
3187000	3189000	stealing, if you will,
3189000	3191000	the style of the game, but
3191000	3193000	they're all different, but yeah, they're all kind of
3193000	3195000	the same in certain ways as well.
3195000	3197000	Just like this, I mean,
3197000	3199000	there's always been last man standing
3199000	3201000	game types and everything, from, like, Call of Duty
3201000	3203000	to somebody brought up something on the
3203000	3205000	Intellivision, like Armor Battle,
3205000	3207000	so this is not a new thing, and like,
3207000	3209000	let's be honest, I mean, Battle Royale,
3209000	3211000	that whole concept, anyways, that's from a
3211000	3213000	fucking movie. You guys
3213000	3215000	all fucking copied that bullshit, so
3215000	3217000	stop fucking saying, oh, your idea is
3217000	3219000	fucking original. This is not an original
3219000	3221000	idea. It's a well-done implementation.
3221000	3223000	Exactly. So, you know what?
3223000	3225000	Like, Mortal Kombat, the,
3225000	3227000	MortalKombat.X
3227000	3229000	is a well-done fighting game. So, here's what
3229000	3231000	you do, because this is what companies do
3231000	3233000	when there's competition. You make the best
3233000	3235000	fucking product you can, and stop bitching
3235000	3237000	about it. Stop whining that
3237000	3239000	fucking competition's coming, and step
3239000	3241000	up your fucking game and make a better
3241000	3243000	game. That's how you fucking win this.
3243000	3245000	Alright, I want to get to chat. Bobby Blackwolf
3245000	3247000	in chat, trying to kind of explain this in
3247000	3249000	his style, says, the biggest worry is that
3249000	3251000	Epic, who makes Unreal Engine, from which
3251000	3253000	PUBG uses,
3253000	3255000	PUBG, should I just say PUBG? PUBG, yeah.
3255000	3257000	I do want to say PUG, like a little pug, but it's PUBG.
3257000	3259000	PUBG. PUBG. Can't I say PUGBEE?
3259000	3261000	Can't I get it backwards?
3261000	3263000	Alright. Who makes Unreal
3263000	3265000	Engine, which PUBG uses,
3265000	3267000	will start with holding updates they
3267000	3269000	make to the engine from PUBG in order to make
3269000	3271000	Fortnite better. They'll make an update to the
3271000	3273000	engine for Fortnite and not share it with PUBG.
3273000	3275000	Granted, they haven't even
3275000	3277000	spoken to Epic about this. They went
3277000	3279000	straight to the press. And certainly
3279000	3281000	there's an issue with that as well, is
3281000	3283000	taking your case to the court
3283000	3285000	of public opinion. Well, let's be honest
3285000	3287000	here. You're going to make updates to the
3287000	3289000	engine anyway, because I don't believe the engine supports
3289000	3291000	100 player multiplayer. That's probably
3291000	3293000	something that you added in there. That's not something
3293000	3295000	that's stock in there. So you're making
3295000	3297000	updates to the engine too. So
3297000	3299000	yeah, they may make updates to the engine for
3299000	3301000	their game, much like you're
3301000	3303000	doing the same thing, but it's not like
3303000	3305000	they're going to be releasing it letting everybody else
3305000	3307000	have that update and not your company.
3307000	3309000	That's stupid.
3309000	3311000	And so what? So what? They
3311000	3313000	make updates to the engine for their particular
3313000	3315000	game. Wah!
3315000	3317000	Make a better fucking game. I don't understand
3317000	3319000	what the problem is.
3319000	3321000	I think it's inevitable that, you know,
3321000	3323000	a consistently top three
3323000	3325000	games streamed on Twitch is
3325000	3327000	going to bring challengers that won a piece
3327000	3329000	of that pie, just like what
3329000	3331000	League of Legends now has
3331000	3333000	Heroes of the Storm, Smite,
3333000	3335000	you know, things that are very similar in nature, which are
3335000	3337000	all Defense of the Ancients. Yes, I know. But
3337000	3339000	you know, League of Legends is kind of the first one that
3339000	3341000	Twitch was really taking off there. You know, but
3341000	3343000	here's the fascinating thing.
3343000	3345000	All those games,
3345000	3347000	League of Legends, Heroes of the Storm, Smite,
3347000	3349000	they all do very well on Twitch and they all do very
3349000	3351000	well for themselves in different ways.
3351000	3353000	Despite the fact that at its core, they're all
3353000	3355000	lane defense games.
3355000	3357000	It's just, you just make
3357000	3359000	a better game. Just make the best game you
3359000	3361000	can and let the,
3361000	3363000	let everybody decide.
3363000	3365000	And learn from it. Just like
3365000	3367000	learn, don't whine about
3367000	3369000	it, because if you whine about it, it just
3369000	3371000	comes off as fucking weak.
3371000	3373000	People
3373000	3375000	are doing the same thing as we are.
3375000	3377000	Yeah, like anyone who wasn't going to copy your idea,
3377000	3379000	that's how it fucking works. But do you think people
3379000	3381000	like, now that you hear this clarification about
3381000	3383000	it wasn't about the Battle Royale,
3383000	3385000	it was about Epic.
3385000	3387000	Doesn't that make you kind of feel like, okay, maybe
3387000	3389000	people on Twitter were going to,
3389000	3391000	and so forth, were going too far with it?
3391000	3393000	Like with this whole thing, like, but at the
3393000	3395000	same time, if they went to the
3395000	3397000	press and not Epic Games
3397000	3399000	to begin with, then they kind of only
3399000	3401000	set themselves up for this misunderstanding.
3401000	3403000	You know, I get it that they are worried that
3403000	3405000	they're going to make updates to the engine, but you know what?
3405000	3407000	If they don't release an update, you
3407000	3409000	can speculate whatever updates
3409000	3411000	that they're making on their side.
3411000	3413000	You can speculate all day long,
3413000	3415000	but I mean, eventually
3415000	3417000	they're going to release updates to it if it's
3417000	3419000	going to be beneficial for everybody using
3419000	3421000	that product because they want to sell the product.
3421000	3423000	But,
3423000	3425000	to think that
3425000	3427000	they're just going to purposely hold back
3427000	3429000	updates so that your game fails
3429000	3431000	is stupid.
3431000	3433000	You know what? You've done well enough by
3433000	3435000	yourself before that
3435000	3437000	they've released all this stuff. I don't understand
3437000	3439000	what the problem is.
3439000	3441000	Alright, going to Stoppy in our chat over at
3441000	3443000	live.hognetwork.com says, I think Sky's on to something.
3443000	3445000	Player Unknown's ground battles
3445000	3447000	make more sense. There's no combat
3447000	3449000	at sea or in air. See? Pugby.
3449000	3451000	It's not a puppy, it's a
3451000	3453000	pugby. Anyway.
3453000	3455000	You know what? I'll say this at the end of the day.
3455000	3457000	I remain interested
3457000	3459000	in both those games right now.
3459000	3461000	You know, I've watched a little bit of both on Twitch,
3461000	3463000	and I'm kind of interested in both of them.
3463000	3465000	So, I mean, when?
3465000	3467000	Question mark?
3467000	3469000	Alright, anyway.
3469000	3471000	Let's move on to another story for now.
3471000	3473000	Loki. So,
3473000	3475000	unfortunately there are some now
3475000	3477000	apps that aren't working with iOS
3477000	3479000	11. One of those apps
3479000	3481000	being the very popular, time-wasting
3481000	3483000	game Flappy Bird.
3483000	3485000	So, if you
3485000	3487000	update to iOS
3487000	3489000	11, it's not going to work because it's a 32-bit
3489000	3491000	app and not a 64-bit
3491000	3493000	app. And no plans from the
3493000	3495000	creator who walked away from that
3495000	3497000	game so long ago
3497000	3499000	to update it. That's too bad. I mean,
3499000	3501000	if only there were some
3501000	3503000	more Flappy Bird clones on
3503000	3505000	the iOS storefront. I mean,
3505000	3507000	it's too bad that no one's ever made one.
3507000	3509000	So, jeez. You know what? You could really
3509000	3511000	corner the market on this. It's too bad there
3511000	3513000	wasn't one right at vognetwork.com.
3513000	3515000	It's like the whole pub.
3515000	3517000	Which did you hear apparently no longer
3517000	3519000	works in most browsers. Oh, darn.
3519000	3521000	Bobby got into it on his show tonight.
3521000	3523000	I'll let you go listen to that. It's like
3523000	3525000	the whole PUBG situation. Man,
3525000	3527000	that sucks that they're the only game
3527000	3529000	out there and only will be the only game
3529000	3531000	ever. But yeah,
3531000	3533000	that's unfortunate.
3533000	3535000	I guess Android wins in this case. Well,
3535000	3537000	you know, guys, I think I found the trick
3537000	3539000	because right now,
3539000	3541000	right now, in the studio
3541000	3543000	on my phone,
3543000	3545000	I'm playing Flappy Bird
3545000	3547000	right now on my phone. That's right.
3547000	3549000	Oops, I died. On my
3549000	3551000	iOS phone, I'm playing.
3551000	3553000	You know how I did it? I didn't
3553000	3555000	upgrade to iOS 11 and I can still
3555000	3557000	play Flappy Bird. So,
3557000	3559000	if you want to still play that stuff, nobody's really
3559000	3561000	forcing you to upgrade. Now, look. Here's
3561000	3563000	the other thing. It's not really
3563000	3565000	just about Flappy Bird. Although,
3565000	3567000	I'm a little sad he's gonna update it, but you're right.
3567000	3569000	There's tons of clones and games out there that
3569000	3571000	have taken this formula and improved
3571000	3573000	on it. It was planned obsolescence. It's Apple
3573000	3575000	conspiring against Flappy Bird
3575000	3577000	because they're gonna release their own
3577000	3579000	Flappy Bird and it's gonna complete the
3579000	3581000	marketplace and they're gonna
3581000	3583000	Flapple. Flapple Bird.
3583000	3585000	It's not a
3585000	3587000	bird anymore. It's a community.
3587000	3589000	It's a meeting hub. A coffee
3589000	3591000	shop, if you will. Not so much
3591000	3593000	of a bird. It's you, actually.
3593000	3595000	It's you. It's your soul.
3595000	3597000	Yes.
3597000	3599000	Flapple.
3599000	3601000	It flaps the soul.
3601000	3603000	Perfect.
3603000	3605000	Anyway.
3605000	3607000	But no, the real reason is
3607000	3609000	the iOS updates are notorious
3609000	3611000	for always being buggy
3611000	3613000	when they first come out. Like, they drain your battery
3613000	3615000	or something happens. So, I'm sorry. I've learned
3615000	3617000	I didn't upgrade right away.
3617000	3619000	And some people will say, you're an idiot, Rob. Well,
3619000	3621000	okay. Cool.
3621000	3623000	But my phone still works and I'm playing
3623000	3625000	Flappy Bird and you're not.
3625000	3627000	But, also, just case
3627000	3629000	and point, obviously I'm a big Pokemon Go
3629000	3631000	player. I mentioned that earlier in the show with
3631000	3633000	what I was playing today. There's, of course,
3633000	3635000	a huge bug with the Plus, the Bluetooth
3635000	3637000	thing, where there's like a three second
3637000	3639000	delay for people that are on iOS 11 where
3639000	3641000	it doesn't work right. So, I'm like,
3641000	3643000	you know what? For that reason alone,
3643000	3645000	with as much Pokemon Go as I play,
3645000	3647000	I'm not exactly in a hurry to upgrade
3647000	3649000	to the newest iOS on my
3649000	3651000	three-year-old device, the iPhone 6
3651000	3653000	Plus. So, anyway.
3653000	3655000	Well, how will you swipe up
3655000	3657000	to do shit?
3657000	3659000	You just won't be able to.
3659000	3661000	Oh, no. It won't be as intuitive.
3661000	3663000	I won't be able to record my screen
3663000	3665000	because I'm sure that's fucking smooth
3665000	3667000	on the
3667000	3669000	6 Plus. It probably works great
3669000	3671000	on the iPhone 8 and the iPhone 10
3671000	3673000	and all this, but it's just not, you know,
3673000	3675000	and as I said before, look, as much as
3675000	3677000	I'm giving this a little crap here,
3677000	3679000	I fully plan to buy the iPhone 10.
3679000	3681000	I'm three years due for an upgrade
3681000	3683000	now. I'm gonna get that iPhone 10
3683000	3685000	and that fancy new screen, but
3685000	3687000	I'll just wait till then
3687000	3689000	for iOS 11. I don't need it now.
3689000	3691000	How good Flappy Bird
3691000	3693000	could look on that screen?
3693000	3695000	Sadly, the potential will never be realized.
3695000	3697000	Well, maybe what I'll probably do is that I'll
3697000	3699000	upgrade, you know, I'll get the iPhone 10 and then
3699000	3701000	what happens to my iPhone 6 Plus? It's basically
3701000	3703000	an iPad or an iPod
3703000	3705000	Touch at that point, right? There's no cell service
3705000	3707000	on it anymore. It's Wi-Fi. But I will forever
3707000	3709000	have this device to play
3709000	3711000	Flappy Bird on. This phone in my hand
3711000	3713000	will be in a fucking museum someday
3713000	3715000	because I didn't upgrade it to iOS 11.
3715000	3717000	Marked my words.
3717000	3719000	He stood up to Apple and said,
3719000	3721000	fuck you, I'm not updating.
3721000	3723000	I will not go to
3723000	3725000	11. Come on, NoelGus
3725000	3727000	in chat talking about my problems with
3727000	3729000	Pokemon Go and iOS
3729000	3731000	11 says that's Niantic, though.
3731000	3733000	Well, yeah, it is, but it's also just a
3733000	3735000	problem of what happens
3735000	3737000	with new OSes. They kind of
3737000	3739000	break some things that developers
3739000	3741000	would want to do. YYR in chat
3741000	3743000	says none of this should come as a surprise
3743000	3745000	for months now. Opening such apps on iOS
3745000	3747000	10 would display a warning. That is true
3747000	3749000	and you can still go in
3749000	3751000	and see
3751000	3753000	you can actually go into
3753000	3755000	I think it was, what is it? I'm looking at my phone right now.
3755000	3757000	You go into settings and I think it's like
3757000	3759000	what is it? General
3759000	3761000	and
3761000	3763000	I don't remember what it is
3763000	3765000	from here. Somebody in chat will probably yell it out.
3765000	3767000	Is it software update? No, because I don't
3767000	3769000	want to update. Oh shit, I don't want to update.
3769000	3771000	Accessibility, maybe?
3771000	3773000	I don't remember what it is, but there's something you go into
3773000	3775000	and it actually shows you what
3775000	3777000	apps on your phone are not
3777000	3779000	going to upgrade. And what's interesting is that
3779000	3781000	ReRave, another music
3781000	3783000	game, is one of them that will not
3783000	3785000	upgrade, but
3785000	3787000	they put out ReRave Plus some time ago
3787000	3789000	so the old ReRave is kind of
3789000	3791000	done anyway. It's all about ReRave Plus at this
3791000	3793000	point, but I remember that was like the other big one
3793000	3795000	that showed up on the list.
3795000	3797000	Alright.
3797000	3799000	ActDeftInChat speculates
3799000	3801000	that phones without iOS 11 will be
3801000	3803000	valuable like PlayStation 4 with
3803000	3805000	PT. Ooh.
3805000	3807000	Good point, good point. Alright.
3807000	3809000	Didn't they try that though?
3809000	3811000	Like people were selling their phones with
3811000	3813000	Flappy Bird when it got removed. I think
3813000	3815000	it was working for some people too.
3815000	3817000	It's kind of crazy what people will buy.
3817000	3819000	Anyway, speaking of
3819000	3821000	things that only crazy people will buy,
3821000	3823000	the original Xbox
3823000	3825000	controller is coming back. The X-Brick
3825000	3827000	controller, that gigantic
3827000	3829000	did you ever have the original Xbox
3829000	3831000	with that gigantic freaking
3831000	3833000	controller? Check
3833000	3835000	it out. Look at a YouTube or something if you've never seen
3835000	3837000	it, but there was a gigantic controller for this
3837000	3839000	and it seems like it might be coming
3839000	3841000	back, sort of. The nickname for this
3841000	3843000	controller, the Duke, apparently
3843000	3845000	one of the original designers has actually
3845000	3847000	been trying to put the Duke back on
3847000	3849000	Xbox One and Windows 10.
3849000	3851000	Microsoft just gave it
3851000	3853000	the green light from Xbox designer
3853000	3855000	Sheamus Blackley.
3856000	3858000	They had the Duke on the 360.
3858000	3860000	Well now it's coming back for the Xbox One.
3860000	3862000	And an appropriate time too because
3862000	3864000	we know that original original Xbox
3864000	3866000	games are going to be playable on Xbox One
3866000	3868000	like Crimson Skies, right? So what
3868000	3870000	better time for this controller to come back. However
3870000	3872000	I do want to state out this will not be a Microsoft
3872000	3874000	product. This will be a peripheral
3874000	3876000	from Hyperkin who puts out
3876000	3878000	a lot of that stuff. Apparently they're now doing
3878000	3880000	that center thing that was like a jewel
3880000	3882000	thing with the Xbox logo. It's not going to be an
3882000	3884000	OLED screen. So that might be kind of neat.
3884000	3886000	Maybe they'll do some different stuff with that.
3886000	3888000	I mean not that there's any like really
3888000	3890000	official second screen support within the
3890000	3892000	Xbox because
3892000	3894000	what the hell? I don't even remember
3894000	3896000	the name of it. That app that
3896000	3898000	they had? Is that dead? It's clearly dead.
3898000	3900000	I don't even remember the fucking name of it.
3900000	3902000	Screenplay? Screen?
3902000	3904000	Oh my god.
3904000	3906000	I can't even remember. That's how dead that thing is.
3906000	3908000	But obviously it won't be supported
3908000	3910000	within the controller. But smart glass.
3910000	3912000	Thank you ActDeft. Winner winner
3912000	3914000	Smart glass dinner.
3914000	3916000	There it is.
3916000	3918000	Speaking of dead things.
3918000	3920000	Microsoft wants to
3920000	3922000	sell you a camera.
3922000	3924000	They're testing USB
3924000	3926000	camera support for
3926000	3928000	streaming use on the Xbox One.
3928000	3930000	Because after all there's been
3930000	3932000	no cameras released for the Xbox
3932000	3934000	One. Ever. Ever.
3934000	3936000	I mean Kinect but will
3936000	3938000	not. But Kinect got shoved in a
3938000	3940000	closet and locked. Let's forget
3940000	3942000	that even happened. We'll never be heard from again.
3942000	3944000	But yes they're gonna support that so you can
3944000	3946000	do like facecam and stuff like that on
3946000	3948000	you know your game
3948000	3950000	stream. Oh so that thing that we hoped
3950000	3952000	the Xbox One would do when they first
3952000	3954000	removed Kinect a couple years ago.
3954000	3956000	Right? They're finally gonna
3956000	3958000	maybe do. I saw Kinect for the Xbox 360
3958000	3960000	for 8 bucks at Goodwill the other day.
3960000	3962000	Wow really? I almost bought it.
3962000	3964000	Oh wait for the 360 not for the one.
3964000	3966000	Oh ok I was like if that was for Xbox One
3966000	3968000	I might have actually went and bought it for Xbox One.
3968000	3970000	8 bucks?
3970000	3972000	I could do without pumpkin spice
3972000	3974000	fraps for a couple days to do that.
3974000	3976000	Yeah I don't think it was the Xbox One. Oh bummer.
3976000	3978000	Bummer bummer. Not bad though.
3978000	3980000	YYR in chat says
3980000	3982000	Kinect may never be heard from again
3982000	3984000	but it will keep listening.
3984000	3986000	I think that was some people's concerns
3986000	3988000	with that device actually.
3988000	3990000	Alright. And
3990000	3992000	come on Noel Gus pointing out that Apple bought
3992000	3994000	the sensor company that made Kinect.
3994000	3996000	Hmm. Maybe
3996000	3998000	Apple Kinect.
3998000	4000000	Anyway moving on
4000000	4002000	to another story. This makes me
4002000	4004000	like really sad actually and that is
4004000	4006000	news that the Chinese
4006000	4008000	Room which is a studio
4008000	4010000	in Britain that makes video
4010000	4012000	games such as probably their most
4012000	4014000	well known games are Everybody's Gone to the
4014000	4016000	Rapture and Dear Esther
4016000	4018000	have laid off their staff
4018000	4020000	and they are going dark for a few months.
4020000	4022000	The co-founder of the Chinese
4022000	4024000	Room Dan Pinchbeck made
4024000	4026000	a big blog post that talks about what's going on
4026000	4028000	saying that this is a temporary closure
4028000	4030000	it is something that's been in the works since earlier
4030000	4032000	in the year. The decision has to do with
4032000	4034000	financial pressures following a
4034000	4036000	health scare. Yikes.
4036000	4038000	And so they're pausing things to recharge.
4038000	4040000	He put quote to cut a long
4040000	4042000	story short the situation between
4042000	4044000	financial pressures trying to keep the lights
4044000	4046000	on for the employed team the stress
4046000	4048000	of end of development health issues
4048000	4050000	just wasn't a tenable thing anymore.
4050000	4052000	It was time to take a break recharge recover
4052000	4054000	and have a good think about the
4054000	4056000	future. Chinese Room still
4056000	4058000	has two games in the works The 13th
4058000	4060000	Interior and Little Orpheus
4060000	4062000	it was assured in
4062000	4064000	the blog post that these titles are still going to
4064000	4066000	release as planned. He will interact
4066000	4068000	with the community through social media but the studio
4068000	4070000	is no longer in full active
4070000	4072000	development. The studio did assist
4072000	4074000	employees in trying to secure positions
4074000	4076000	elsewhere since I guess they'd known
4076000	4078000	for some time.
4078000	4080000	Trying to end on a happy note
4080000	4082000	Is it the end of the Chinese room? No
4082000	4084000	I don't think so but it's the end of a chapter
4084000	4086000	and we hope you all can be patient with us whilst
4086000	4088000	we figure out what happens next. And that makes
4088000	4090000	me sad because I thought everybody's gone
4090000	4092000	to the rapture was a brilliant game
4092000	4094000	and I understand not everybody's into the
4094000	4096000	walking simulators which you know
4096000	4098000	but I also think the internet has
4098000	4100000	kind of like a lot of mob
4100000	4102000	mentality online has really
4102000	4104000	given the walking simulator type
4104000	4106000	stuff like like it's just it's a well
4106000	4108000	done story at the end of the day
4108000	4110000	everybody's gone to the rapture is a really good story at the end
4110000	4112000	of the day and it's you know you can draw your own
4112000	4114000	conclusions from it you can either get
4114000	4116000	a lot of exposition or very little depending
4116000	4118000	on how you know thorough you are with the exploring
4118000	4120000	and so forth I think the soundtrack
4120000	4122000	is one of the most gorgeous soundtracks in a
4122000	4124000	video game so
4124000	4126000	there's an awful lot I really like about the game
4126000	4128000	so I think it sucks that you know the internet kind of
4128000	4130000	shits on this genre sometimes
4130000	4132000	when there's you know brilliant art
4132000	4134000	that comes out of it like this game and
4134000	4136000	you know I really hope that
4136000	4138000	backlash or whatever you want to call it I really hope
4138000	4140000	that didn't play into
4140000	4142000	what's happening to the studio now
4142000	4144000	it sounds like there may be some other issues
4144000	4146000	such as the health issues and so forth that are a lot more
4146000	4148000	scarier you know that are that are much bigger
4148000	4150000	than a video game and so forth so I get it from that
4150000	4152000	standpoint but hopefully
4152000	4154000	the upcoming releases the 13th
4154000	4156000	interior a little Orpheus
4156000	4158000	hopefully they're good you know
4158000	4160000	you know I'm not gonna be so
4160000	4162000	nice if the games aren't good but I if
4162000	4164000	the games are good which you know I enjoyed their other
4164000	4166000	games so I would hope I'd like these games to if
4166000	4168000	the games are good I hope it brings them the success
4168000	4170000	that they deserve to be able to do more
4170000	4172000	games in the future although it's gonna be weird if
4172000	4174000	they can't really have the same development team you know
4174000	4176000	so or maybe they'll be able to come back I don't know
4176000	4178000	so anyhow
4178000	4180000	little sad about that and the fact that
4180000	4182000	that developer is
4182000	4184000	kind of going through a big change right
4184000	4186000	now all right before we get to the classic
4186000	4188000	game of the week which I will be doing tonight in
4188000	4190000	Dark Sakura's Absence we have one more story from
4190000	4192000	Loki yes and this is kind of hopefully
4192000	4194000	the end of a
4194000	4196000	long stretch of stories we've been talking about
4196000	4198000	so going back to last
4198000	4200000	week we were mentioning that you know
4200000	4202000	first there was an NES emulator
4202000	4204000	that was found randomly within
4204000	4206000	the firmware of the
4206000	4208000	or yeah the
4208000	4210000	firmware of the NES
4210000	4212000	Switch or the Switch and
4212000	4214000	they also had the NES game Golf
4214000	4216000	in there as well that was part of the Switch
4216000	4218000	and everyone's just wondering what the hell is this
4218000	4220000	why why is this in here
4220000	4222000	is this like something that's going to be coming out
4222000	4224000	you know are they going to have this
4224000	4226000	release or something well apparently
4226000	4228000	there is a little bit more to the
4228000	4230000	story so they figured it out
4230000	4232000	they figured it out yeah so
4232000	4234000	and almost by accident
4234000	4236000	someone had somehow launched
4236000	4238000	Golf actually without any sort
4238000	4240000	of hacks and launched the game and they're
4240000	4242000	like wait how did you do that
4242000	4244000	you know no one believed them at first
4244000	4246000	and then they found all this stuff
4246000	4248000	so what happened was apparently
4248000	4250000	on July 11th
4250000	4252000	which is the
4252000	4254000	anniversary of
4254000	4256000	Awana's death
4256000	4258000	if on July 11th
4258000	4260000	if you make the
4260000	4262000	the little motion
4262000	4264000	the direct to you motion
4264000	4266000	the open hands
4266000	4268000	kind of going forward yeah if you
4268000	4270000	make that motion with the
4270000	4272000	Switch controllers
4272000	4274000	it'll launch the game
4274000	4276000	and it's only on July 11th
4276000	4278000	and it actually has to be on July 11th
4278000	4280000	if it's connected to the internet because it does check
4280000	4282000	you know the time against the internet
4282000	4284000	someone has managed to capture
4284000	4286000	this on video because he had a
4286000	4288000	Switch that wasn't connected to the internet
4288000	4290000	yet and so he set the date to
4290000	4292000	July 11th did the gesture
4292000	4294000	and sure enough it booted up
4294000	4296000	Golf that's awesome that's a really
4296000	4298000	neat truth you know some people were kind of weirded
4298000	4300000	out though by the fact that they did his date of death
4300000	4302000	as a tribute and not
4302000	4304000	like his birthday or you know
4304000	4306000	celebrating a type of other notable release
4306000	4308000	or just any time but
4308000	4310000	you know I think that's also maybe like a culture
4310000	4312000	thing as well like you know maybe it's a little
4312000	4314000	weird in our culture but in other
4314000	4316000	cultures sometimes
4316000	4318000	that's how you celebrate or
4318000	4320000	I think it was I was reading something about it like
4320000	4322000	it's almost like a good luck thing like
4322000	4324000	if you have that inspiration that's in your
4324000	4326000	console that it's actually or you know whatever it is
4326000	4328000	you develop that's actually like a good luck thing
4328000	4330000	but like you know in some cultures what we have like
4330000	4332000	we have holidays to celebrate dead people
4332000	4334000	like that's you know that's what happens so it's
4336000	4338000	it's interesting I wonder
4338000	4340000	if this would have ever been found
4340000	4342000	well I get I mean I get
4342000	4344000	this was the way it was supposed to happen I suppose
4344000	4346000	some guy randomly accidentally
4346000	4348000	gets it on July 11th and posts to a
4348000	4350000	message board nobody believes him
4350000	4352000	but then finally somebody digs in the OS and
4352000	4354000	finds no this guy there's something to it right
4354000	4356000	so I guess next
4356000	4358000	year on July 11th a lot of people are going to be
4358000	4360000	playing golf yeah
4360000	4362000	Dartetsuya in chat says I learned in Japan they
4362000	4364000	called it a Oma Mori a good luck
4364000	4366000	charm yeah Dartetsuya
4366000	4368000	says that's the term they were throwing around over on
4368000	4370000	Japanese Twitter so there it is and of course
4370000	4372000	golf Iwata had made
4372000	4374000	golf just like he made yeah
4374000	4376000	I guess no there's a lot of people
4376000	4378000	that refuse to work on that game because they couldn't
4378000	4380000	fit it within the cartridge size but
4380000	4382000	somehow he managed to get the code to fit
4382000	4384000	alright well that's that is
4384000	4386000	that is awesome so I don't have a
4386000	4388000	clever follow up for that leading into our
4388000	4390000	classic game of the week so let's just get to our
4390000	4392000	classic game of the week
4392000	4394000	now every week
4394000	4396000	Dark Soccer dives into the video game vault and finds
4396000	4398000	a game that she thinks hey you little brats
4398000	4400000	you should be playing this game this week
4400000	4402000	but she's not here
4402000	4404000	so I'm taking over tonight because I thought
4404000	4406000	it would be good tonight to do a timely
4406000	4408000	submission perhaps a little bit for the classic
4408000	4410000	game of the week and I don't even know if Loki's
4410000	4412000	ever played this but we'll find out so the classic
4412000	4414000	game of the week nope sorry guys not Halo
4414000	4416000	classic game of the week is something a little timely
4416000	4418000	this week there's a very specific reason
4418000	4420000	why I picked this today
4420000	4422000	so the classic game of the week let's see if we can get
4422000	4424000	some of the voice synthesizer
4424000	4426000	in here to play
4426000	4428000	that's right
4428000	4430000	it is Star Trek
4430000	4432000	the 1982
4432000	4434000	release from Sega in
4434000	4436000	the arcades this is the Star Trek
4436000	4438000	strategic operations
4438000	4440000	simulator and it was
4440000	4442000	an arcade release in 1982 from
4442000	4444000	Sega but it was ported to a variety
4444000	4446000	of systems I know I had played
4446000	4448000	it on the Commodore 64 when I was
4448000	4450000	younger and it was also
4450000	4452000	on I think it was on the
4452000	4454000	Apple as well
4454000	4456000	it was on the Vectrex
4456000	4458000	I think it was on Atari 2600 as well
4458000	4460000	no I don't think it was on the Vectrex it was on the ColecoVision I know
4460000	4462000	that what's interesting about this game
4462000	4464000	it looks like
4464000	4466000	Star Wars which was around
4466000	4468000	the same time but Star Wars was
4468000	4470000	Atari if I remember right
4470000	4472000	these just both happen to be vector based games
4472000	4474000	but the interesting thing that made
4474000	4476000	Star Trek a little bit different is that in
4476000	4478000	the Star Trek arcade game you actually
4478000	4480000	had like a split screen thing
4480000	4482000	going on you had a map in the upper right
4482000	4484000	you had in the upper left like a
4484000	4486000	bar that showed how many photon torpedoes
4486000	4488000	you had and how many like laser beams and all that stuff
4488000	4490000	you had and then you had your actual
4490000	4492000	like view play was on the bottom
4492000	4494000	and so remember this was 1982
4494000	4496000	in the arcades this is a little bit unheard
4496000	4498000	of at the time to basically have like
4498000	4500000	second screen type of stuff that was built
4500000	4502000	into the game or actually tertiary screens
4502000	4504000	in this case
4504000	4506000	so that's kind of what made this game unique
4506000	4508000	I don't think that this game was ever as popular
4508000	4510000	as Star Wars was
4510000	4512000	which was around
4512000	4514000	the same year or the year later but
4514000	4516000	I think it was pretty cool just how like involved
4516000	4518000	this game was so
4518000	4520000	what you did in this game you got multiple views
4520000	4522000	of the play field and of course
4522000	4524000	you have to use and manage your shield energy
4524000	4526000	and photon torpedoes and warp energy
4526000	4528000	you can replenish these by docking with
4528000	4530000	star bases but the Klingons
4530000	4532000	aren't only attacking you
4532000	4534000	they're actually attacking the
4534000	4536000	star base as well so you have to be careful
4536000	4538000	and you can actually kill your star base by friendly
4538000	4540000	fire so you have to be careful
4540000	4542000	this game was actually controlled with a weighted
4542000	4544000	spinner so it wasn't really like a joystick
4544000	4546000	you actually had a little spinner and that's how you use the ship
4546000	4548000	heading control and then you have buttons
4548000	4550000	to do the impulse engines, warp engines
4550000	4552000	phasers and photon
4552000	4554000	torpedoes the warp button
4554000	4556000	was set a little bit away from the other
4556000	4558000	buttons that way you had
4558000	4560000	to actually like you intentionally
4560000	4562000	go and hit it and you wouldn't be hitting it on accident
4562000	4564000	especially if you're in the moment
4564000	4566000	you want to make sure you don't accidentally hit that
4566000	4568000	so there you go and then
4568000	4570000	this was translated on a variety of
4570000	4572000	different systems an early
4572000	4574000	review in the magazine Electronic Games
4574000	4576000	said that this is sure to be a top
4576000	4578000	grocer in the arcades this year if you can
4578000	4580000	squeeze through the crowd around the machine you may
4580000	4582000	never want to leave I
4582000	4584000	don't I mean again I can
4584000	4586000	only go back by my old memory
4586000	4588000	but I don't think this game
4588000	4590000	ended up being as popular in
4590000	4592000	the arcades at the time but I remember
4592000	4594000	it was a game it seemed like a lot of people did have
4594000	4596000	on like home consoles and stuff like
4596000	4598000	obviously we added on Commodore 64
4598000	4600000	it was on Atari 2600, Apple II
4600000	4602000	you know kind of those early
4602000	4604000	YYR
4604000	4606000	and Chad is like freaking out going
4606000	4608000	holy shit I played a Commodore 64 version of this
4608000	4610000	and didn't remember it at all until
4610000	4612000	just now see there you go classic
4612000	4614000	game of the week awakening memories
4614000	4616000	deep inside you even some you may not
4616000	4618000	want since 2002
4618000	4620000	the
4620000	4622000	designer of this game Sam
4622000	4624000	Palihannuk I hope I said that
4624000	4626000	right who did this for Sega
4626000	4628000	which ended up developing and publishing the game
4628000	4630000	and
4630000	4632000	there you go I don't know what else to say about it
4632000	4634000	but obviously I have picked this game
4634000	4636000	tonight because of the fact that
4636000	4638000	I know many people are probably not
4638000	4640000	listening to OLR tonight because they're watching
4640000	4642000	the Star Trek Discovery which is the new
4642000	4644000	TV series is airing tonight
4644000	4646000	which is a little bit controversial
4646000	4648000	because I know it's going on the CBS all
4648000	4650000	access thing and people are like I don't
4650000	4652000	really want to pay for another
4652000	4654000	$10 a month thing
4654000	4656000	but you know despite that controversy
4656000	4658000	I do think it's great that Star Trek
4658000	4660000	you'll just have to do what Game of Thrones fans do
4660000	4662000	and pirate it probably pirate the shit out of it
4662000	4664000	but anyway I just think it's great that Star Trek
4664000	4666000	is coming back to television and of course
4666000	4668000	I'm going to leave the rest of that discussion to our
4668000	4670000	friends at the Starboard Power Coupling
4670000	4672000	podcast we played their commercial last week
4672000	4674000	and they are very excited to be back this week
4674000	4676000	with their discussion on the first
4676000	4678000	maybe first two episodes actually because I believe
4678000	4680000	not you get the first episode on TV
4680000	4682000	but then on CBS all access the first two episodes
4682000	4684000	are going to be there so I think they may discuss both
4684000	4686000	this week on Starboard Power Coupling
4686000	4688000	so look forward to
4688000	4690000	that. Anyway there it is
4690000	4692000	your classic game of the week Star Trek the arcade game
4692000	4694000	from 1982 a strategical
4694000	4696000	operations simulator and I'm being very specific
4696000	4698000	because there's been like 50 Star Trek games
4698000	4700000	so that's the one specifically I'm
4700000	4702000	calling out.
4702000	4704000	To register participation for
4704000	4706000	this week's episode of Orange Island Radio at
4706000	4708000	vognetwork.com use the pass phrase
4708000	4710000	Sprout.
4710000	4712000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat saying the Orville
4712000	4714000	greater than Discovery
4714000	4716000	you know what I haven't seen either one
4716000	4718000	and I don't think you've seen Discovery
4718000	4720000	yet so I think it's a little early to say that
4720000	4722000	but I do think it's
4722000	4724000	interesting that the Orville
4724000	4726000	the reason why people seem to
4726000	4728000	like it is that it has a lot
4728000	4730000	of the essence of what people really like about
4730000	4732000	Star Trek I mean granted it's in a separate universe
4732000	4734000	or what have you but it's interesting
4734000	4736000	because it is on Fox which is over the
4736000	4738000	air and it's kind of doing something that Star Trek
4738000	4740000	Discovery isn't and I just I really
4740000	4742000	hope that decision by CBS doesn't
4742000	4744000	like fuck Star Trek
4744000	4746000	forever because of this decision
4746000	4748000	so I'm kind
4748000	4750000	of hoping because I don't know if you know this
4750000	4752000	but in every other country but the
4752000	4754000	US maybe Canada as well
4754000	4756000	I can't remember what the deal is in Canada but
4756000	4758000	I think every other country besides those two
4758000	4760000	Netflix is going to have the Star Trek show
4760000	4762000	so in every other country you'll be able to watch it
4762000	4764000	on Netflix and
4764000	4766000	so yeah you don't have to worry about getting a separate
4766000	4768000	service because it'll be on the one that most people have
4768000	4770000	so I wonder if this show isn't going to do
4770000	4772000	very very very well in other countries
4772000	4774000	but I guess CBS
4774000	4776000	already made a good like they spent like eight
4776000	4778000	million dollars on this show well six
4778000	4780000	million of it came from the Netflix deal so
4780000	4782000	yeah right anyway
4782000	4784000	alright
4784000	4786000	oh yeah that's right and somebody did explain this
4786000	4788000	to me Bob Blackwell says it airs on cable
4788000	4790000	TV in Canada so they have like
4790000	4792000	a cable TV channel up there I think
4792000	4794000	one of my buddies up there I think was even telling me about this
4794000	4796000	and I just forgot because I don't have a good memory
4796000	4798000	alright
4798000	4800000	and Kaijuto in chat points out I use
4800000	4802000	CBS access for Big Brother it's cool
4802000	4804000	you can watch a lot of crap on it and admittedly
4804000	4806000	yeah I got CBS all
4806000	4808000	access for Big Brother as well and
4808000	4810000	do you know how lit that celebrity version
4810000	4812000	of Big Brother is going to be I mean it's
4812000	4814000	it's Olympics counter programming so it's going to be on
4814000	4816000	the same time when a lot of people are distracted
4816000	4818000	by the Olympics but instead of
4818000	4820000	just trying to air these shows that nobody's going to
4820000	4822000	watch because the Olympics are on CBS is going to try to
4822000	4824000	do you know celebrity Big Brother which stands
4824000	4826000	but that's going to be on it'll
4826000	4828000	be on TV but the live feeds will be on
4828000	4830000	CBS all access and that's going to be nuts
4830000	4832000	because that's celebrities
4832000	4834000	you know in the big well I say
4834000	4836000	celebrities but it's going to be celebrities
4836000	4838000	if rumors are to be believed
4838000	4840000	Tiffany Pollard
4840000	4842000	or New York who's one of my faves
4842000	4844000	I think she'll do fantastic
4844000	4846000	Lance Bass
4846000	4848000	Dog the Bounty Hunter
4848000	4850000	some gal from Mob Wives but again
4850000	4852000	these are rumors and who knows what's
4852000	4854000	going to change before this is really on TV
4854000	4856000	so it'll be interesting but
4856000	4858000	I mean maybe if celebrity Big Brother
4858000	4860000	brings people to CBS all access then
4860000	4862000	people will be like oh shit this is the Star Trek thing too
4862000	4864000	I guess I should watch this but I feel like
4864000	4866000	most of the Star Trek fans will have just pirated
4866000	4868000	it before that that's just the reality
4868000	4870000	I don't know we'll see
4870000	4872000	anyhow we're going to
4872000	4874000	take a break you guys when we come back we have plenty

4904000	4906000	myself and Loki with you here tonight
4906000	4908000	Dark Soccer is out sick
4908000	4910000	but I hope she feels better a lot soon
4910000	4912000	although I notice over
4912000	4914000	where Dark Soccer usually sits
4914000	4916000	during the show I notice my husband Alan
4916000	4918000	has his ASMR
4918000	4920000	stuff all set up do you know what this is
4920000	4922000	Loki the ASMR have you heard of this?
4922000	4924000	this is something I've just been learning more about
4924000	4926000	recently is it's this whole okay so I guess
4926000	4928000	like there's this um you can find these YouTube
4928000	4930000	videos out there and it's um you know
4930000	4932000	it's people that are talking they're talking
4932000	4934000	very softly into a
4934000	4936000	microphone and uh
4936000	4938000	what the way they talk the way they talk
4938000	4940000	it's supposed to like make chills go
4940000	4942000	down your spine and like
4942000	4944000	but they'll do things like it's not just the talking but then it's like
4944000	4946000	they'll like rub things they'll
4946000	4948000	rub the microphone it's like this I guess
4948000	4950000	supposed to be like and people say it's like a massage
4950000	4952000	for the brain I know I understand I know the
4952000	4954000	feeling but like I don't know
4954000	4956000	well the first video I ever saw was this lady who
4956000	4958000	eats a pickle really slowly and
4958000	4960000	like you know she's
4960000	4962000	and this is like the noise of the pickle
4962000	4964000	is like but like see some people that would
4964000	4966000	drive them nuts that noise
4966000	4968000	because like you know some people don't like to hear other
4968000	4970000	people eat like I have a friend who really hates that
4970000	4972000	but um you know I just I can't help
4972000	4974000	but you know think of that but anyway so
4974000	4976000	so Alan has likes to
4976000	4978000	watch these videos and I guess I guess
4978000	4980000	some people feel it and some people don't so
4980000	4982000	Alan's kind of one of the people that feels it and
4982000	4984000	but now he makes he likes to
4984000	4986000	make the uh slime stuff he sees
4986000	4988000	in some of the videos cause that's
4988000	4990000	I guess gives him that texture type feedback
4990000	4992000	so if you ever wondered what
4992000	4994000	happens to Jamie's spot during the week when
4994000	4996000	she's not here it turns into
4996000	4998000	I keep calling it ass master
4998000	5000000	cause ASMR turns into
5000000	5002000	it's ass mister it's ass mister
5002000	5004000	I like that better it's cause cause people
5004000	5006000	are gonna get a different impression if I say Jamie's
5006000	5008000	share turns into ass master when she's not here
5008000	5010000	but no it's it's ASMR headquarters
5010000	5012000	uh ass mister so there it is
5012000	5014000	so uh going to our chat over
5014000	5016000	at live dot vog network
5016000	5018000	dot com uh active to chat says
5018000	5020000	it's ASMOLR do you know how much
5020000	5022000	money those YouTubes make
5022000	5024000	like if you do like that
5024000	5026000	that lady who makes the pickles that
5026000	5028000	that video probably has millions of hits
5028000	5030000	like she could probably fucking retire
5030000	5032000	off eating pickles on YouTube like it's crazy
5032000	5034000	it's people that play toys yeah
5034000	5036000	play with toys and film it
5036000	5038000	and my son watches the shit out of that crap
5038000	5040000	it's so like oh my gosh it's so
5040000	5042000	and it's a never ending cycle
5042000	5044000	too cause you get your kid to play
5044000	5046000	with toys and then the companies pay
5046000	5048000	you know that
5048000	5050000	or pay you for that and then they also send you free
5050000	5052000	toys to promote it never ends
5052000	5054000	I need to do that Legos
5054000	5056000	I need to do it seriously Legos
5056000	5058000	have been like crack I am a fucking crack
5058000	5060000	addict when it comes to that shit
5060000	5062000	that might be a fun thing to stream is Lego
5062000	5064000	building like stream it on Twitch and then archive
5064000	5066000	it on YouTube they do that
5066000	5068000	sometimes they'll do speed builds and stuff
5068000	5070000	but like yeah but it's not me I'm funny
5070000	5072000	I mean it
5072000	5074000	takes a long time though like the last I put together
5074000	5076000	took 12 hours wow
5076000	5078000	cause it was a big set uh let's see
5078000	5080000	Bobby Blackwolf points out there was a guys on
5080000	5082000	a show episode about people chewing one
5082000	5084000	now you know which one of my friends I was referring to a moment ago
5084000	5086000	alright anyhow people
5086000	5088000	chewing I don't remember guys on a show episode
5088000	5090000	about chewing I don't remember I don't remember
5090000	5092000	I think it was I think it was like the discussion
5092000	5094000	at the top of the show I don't think that was the main topic
5094000	5096000	of the show but I think it came up at some point
5096000	5098000	during the show anyway I missed that show
5098000	5100000	I do really want to bring it back you guys but you know
5100000	5102000	Xverse has just been really busy as have I
5102000	5104000	so I don't want to go
5104000	5106000	too far down this road but I did mention
5106000	5108000	at Dragon Con I was you know finding a lot of inspiration
5108000	5110000	and it's part of the reason why I
5110000	5112000	want to get more motivated to do this segment
5112000	5114000	for you know Pogo Podcast I'm doing
5114000	5116000	but I am
5116000	5118000	considering adding another podcast to the
5118000	5120000	platter I'm in that mode now
5120000	5122000	where I think I have an idea in my
5122000	5124000	head and the little hamster
5124000	5126000	gears are turning so we'll see
5126000	5128000	anyway alright
5128000	5130000	let's move on
5130000	5132000	we're going to get into
5132000	5134000	some more news rapid fire news
5134000	5136000	in fact starting with Loki
5136000	5138000	so here's a mobile game we haven't heard of in a while
5138000	5140000	but Super Mario Run
5140000	5142000	is getting an update that's right
5142000	5144000	they're adding a whole new world
5144000	5146000	don't you dare close
5146000	5148000	your eyes a whole new world
5148000	5150000	I see no right as I said that I was like oh my god
5150000	5152000	he's going to do that and sure
5152000	5154000	enough not disappointed whatsoever
5154000	5156000	have I
5156000	5158000	become predictable after 700 episodes
5158000	5160000	of this show?
5160000	5162000	no I'm just using my
5162000	5164000	wife doing that kind of crap
5164000	5166000	so the new one is going to be
5166000	5168000	they said it's going to
5168000	5170000	have like a remix 10
5170000	5172000	is what it's called so
5172000	5174000	it's
5174000	5176000	basically bite sized sections
5176000	5178000	of the game's current levels with new bonus
5178000	5180000	medals so they have repeatable
5180000	5182000	challenges and they're also adding a new playable
5182000	5184000	character Princess Daisy will become
5184000	5186000	a playable character as well
5186000	5188000	and so also with that you're going to be able to
5188000	5190000	play your own music in the background
5190000	5192000	instead of the game music
5192000	5194000	and when you do
5194000	5196000	that your characters will
5196000	5198000	they'll wear headphones so they have a picture
5198000	5200000	of Mario with headphones on
5200000	5202000	headphone Mario
5202000	5204000	beats by Bowser
5204000	5206000	I like that beats by Bowser
5206000	5208000	and then of course if you haven't jumped into the game yet
5208000	5210000	they're going to be marking it on sale
5210000	5212000	September 29th it's going to be half price
5212000	5214000	so $5 instead of $10
5214000	5216000	so check it out
5216000	5218000	alright and then
5218000	5220000	with the prevalence
5220000	5222000	of Wii U emulators
5222000	5224000	there is
5224000	5226000	a whole ton of shit
5226000	5228000	that they've been doing with the whole
5228000	5230000	Wii emulation or Wii U emulation scene
5230000	5232000	and of course one of the games that's
5232000	5234000	gotten a lot of focus is
5234000	5236000	the whole Breath
5236000	5238000	of the Wild so
5238000	5240000	Breath of the Wild runs fantastic in emulators
5240000	5242000	in fact they've gotten it to run 4K and all sorts
5242000	5244000	of things and now modding has
5244000	5246000	become a part of that so
5246000	5248000	all sorts of mods in there there's a few new character
5248000	5250000	mods including putting
5250000	5252000	CJ or Carl Johnson from
5252000	5254000	Grand Theft Auto San Andreas
5254000	5256000	in the game or Steve from Minecraft
5256000	5258000	and they have
5258000	5260000	a picture with Link wearing Cappy
5260000	5262000	and a mustache
5262000	5264000	as well do they have the mod like
5264000	5266000	they have in Skyrim for like maybe
5266000	5268000	when the red moon happens it's Macho Man
5268000	5270000	starts playing no
5270000	5272000	they don't have that yet but I mean it's
5272000	5274000	it's interesting and then the moon turns into
5274000	5276000	Randy Macho Man Savage oh yeah
5276000	5278000	see all these different mods for the game
5278000	5280000	I want to see some for Mario Kart
5280000	5282000	I wonder if they've got some for that but
5282000	5284000	yeah I haven't played
5284000	5286000	on my emulator in a while
5286000	5288000	but it runs really well in my system
5288000	5290000	so I need to maybe go back
5290000	5292000	and check that out again
5292000	5294000	I'm having a laugh at this conversation in chat
5294000	5296000	YYR in chat says is Headphone Mario wearing
5296000	5298000	anything besides the headphones
5298000	5300000	and Corky follows that up with yes
5300000	5302000	his mustache
5304000	5306000	alright moving on to some other rapid fire
5306000	5308000	stories for the week you know I
5308000	5310000	didn't miss this one you guys from Tokyo Game
5310000	5312000	Show it's not specifically about
5312000	5314000	Sony but I'm very excited to
5314000	5316000	hear about Kunio-kun the world
5316000	5318000	classics collection it's going to come out on
5318000	5320000	PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch
5320000	5322000	and PC it's 11
5322000	5324000	Kunio-kun classics
5324000	5326000	and if you don't know what Kunio-kun is
5326000	5328000	well then let me tell you about the four
5328000	5330000	western games also
5330000	5332000	included as bonus titles that weren't released
5332000	5334000	in Japan that are part of this collection
5334000	5336000	and you'll know real quick what Kunio-kun
5336000	5338000	is Renegade
5338000	5340000	Super Dodgeball
5340000	5342000	River City Ransom and Crash and the
5342000	5344000	Boy Street Challenge that's right it's the
5344000	5346000	little characters from River City Ransom and Super Dodgeball
5346000	5348000	so of course they've had some more games
5348000	5350000	that have been released over in Japan there's
5350000	5352000	like several dodgeball games there's a hockey
5352000	5354000	game a soccer game so anyhow all
5354000	5356000	the games in the Kunio-kun collection will have support
5356000	5358000	for online play as you clear
5358000	5360000	missions in the title you can customize your avatar
5360000	5362000	and your game screen and
5362000	5364000	additional replayability elements as well so
5364000	5366000	that's really exciting especially I'm very excited to hear it's
5366000	5368000	coming out on Switch because
5368000	5370000	then that's something that you can take with you on the go
5370000	5372000	as well and you know these are
5372000	5374000	older games anyway so it's not like you're gonna
5374000	5376000	need the biggest technology to play them
5376000	5378000	so that's very very cool
5378000	5380000	what else could be cool
5380000	5382000	speaking of the Nintendo Switch
5382000	5384000	apparently a Netflix customer
5384000	5386000	service rep so take it
5386000	5388000	with a grain of salt cause it's not like it's you know
5388000	5390000	a director of you know
5390000	5392000	publicity or something a Netflix
5392000	5394000	customer service rep told Go Nintendo
5394000	5396000	or a user at that site anyway
5396000	5398000	that Netflix is locked
5398000	5400000	and loaded for the Nintendo Switch
5400000	5402000	Netflix been trying to get permission
5402000	5404000	from Nintendo to launch the app on the
5404000	5406000	console but no results yet
5406000	5408000	once Nintendo approves it
5408000	5410000	the Netflix Nintendo Switch app will launch
5410000	5412000	and be added to the eShop I honestly
5412000	5414000	but no surprise here I think the only
5414000	5416000	surprise out of this is that somebody
5416000	5418000	at Netflix is saying something about it
5418000	5420000	but you guys customer
5420000	5422000	service sometimes is outsourced
5422000	5424000	to other companies so
5424000	5426000	with all due respect this
5426000	5428000	person may have no
5428000	5430000	additional information that you or I have
5430000	5432000	usually the customer service
5432000	5434000	reps the thing is that those positions you know
5434000	5436000	phones they tend to be very high attrition
5436000	5438000	so people come and go basically you know
5438000	5440000	so you don't always give them the secrets
5440000	5442000	because they're the folks that tend to leave
5442000	5444000	and go somewhere else you know what I mean
5444000	5446000	so they usually find things out
5446000	5448000	the day everybody else finds them out so
5448000	5450000	it's a little weird to me that they
5450000	5452000	would know about this but you know
5452000	5454000	they might know a guy in another department
5454000	5456000	or something you know but regardless
5456000	5458000	it was probably inappropriate of them to say
5458000	5460000	something about this on the outside
5460000	5462000	but at the same time
5462000	5464000	is this really shocking news
5464000	5466000	that Netflix is probably
5466000	5468000	not the holdout about
5468000	5470000	Netflix being on the Switch
5470000	5472000	does that surprise you Loki to hear that
5472000	5474000	Netflix is not the problem with
5474000	5476000	Netflix on the Switch is not Netflix
5476000	5478000	does that surprise you
5478000	5480000	yeah it does? no
5480000	5482000	oh okay I was like
5482000	5484000	surely you're being sarcastic
5484000	5486000	of course I am Loki don't fuck with me tonight
5486000	5488000	I'm not in a good mood alright just kidding
5488000	5490000	uh yeah
5490000	5492000	says I'm sure Netflix
5492000	5494000	on Switch is inevitable
5494000	5496000	says I think it would be more shocking
5496000	5498000	if Netflix didn't have an app
5498000	5500000	ready I'm just curious again
5500000	5502000	I know I've said this a thousand times but I'm
5502000	5504000	very curious about the whole fact like will you
5504000	5506000	really be able to pick it up and take it on the
5506000	5508000	go with you I mean in the house certainly
5508000	5510000	it would still work off wifi but
5510000	5512000	I mean like something like Riverdale
5512000	5514000	which you can download to your device
5514000	5516000	can I pick that up and leave the house
5516000	5518000	and watch it because maybe it's buffered
5518000	5520000	in the background like at a certain point
5520000	5522000	the Switch will tell me like boom
5522000	5524000	the episode's completely downloaded and I can pick it up
5524000	5526000	and take it with me on public
5526000	5528000	transit wherever I want to go
5528000	5530000	oh no we'll see
5530000	5532000	sounds like it's up to Nintendo to tell
5532000	5534000	us that you can download it to the Switch's
5534000	5536000	massive 32 gigabytes of storage
5536000	5538000	well believe it or not those movies
5538000	5540000	are not very big there may be
5540000	5542000	less than a gigabyte so
5542000	5544000	you know you could download a couple things
5544000	5546000	you can't download a lot but you get to have one or two things
5546000	5548000	at a time that's not crazy so
5548000	5550000	anyhow let's go
5550000	5552000	and travel around the world and check out some
5552000	5554000	video games coming out in other countries
5554000	5556000	like the US to start Loki

5648000	5650000	Gundam Versus on PlayStation 4
5650000	5652000	This isn't really counted as a release but because
5652000	5654000	you know the whole Super NES
5654000	5656000	Classic Edition is coming out on Friday
5656000	5658000	they also mention Star Fox 2
5658000	5660000	which I guess technically is being released
5660000	5662000	but that's kind of a stretch
5662000	5664000	That is a little bit of a stretch but I guess
5664000	5666000	I did want to mention though, since you're a fan
5666000	5668000	Cults of
5668000	5670000	Revolt is coming out the following week
5670000	5672000	on 3DS
5672000	5674000	I am excited about that
5674000	5676000	I know they were promoting that a little bit on
5676000	5678000	it has its own little
5678000	5680000	3DS collectible puzzle piece
5680000	5682000	thing and all that
5682000	5684000	too, so that's pretty exciting
5684000	5686000	Alright, let's travel to Japan and check out
5686000	5688000	what is going to be coming out in Japan
5688000	5690000	and let's see, looking at
5690000	5692000	the list for
5692000	5694000	September the 28th
5694000	5696000	we have coming out Fire Emblem Musou
5696000	5698000	is out in Japan, I believe that is on
5698000	5700000	PlayStation 4
5700000	5702000	I'm sorry, that is a new
5702000	5704000	Nintendo 3DS game, sorry my list
5704000	5706000	this week doesn't have it separated by
5706000	5708000	what platform they're on
5708000	5710000	so it's a little more challenging for me
5710000	5712000	so that is on the new 3DS this week
5712000	5714000	also coming out this week we have
5714000	5716000	NAC 2, gets its Japanese release on the
5716000	5718000	28th, there's also
5718000	5720000	Fire Emblem Musou in a premium box
5720000	5722000	so that is something to look forward to as well
5722000	5724000	which is on the Switch as well as the 3DS
5724000	5726000	they have a game called
5726000	5728000	Nora Princess and Stray Cat
5728000	5730000	comes out this week
5730000	5732000	and that is on the PlayStation Vita
5732000	5734000	looks like it might be based off an anime
5734000	5736000	and then also in Japan
5736000	5738000	Fallout 4 gets a new game of the year edition
5738000	5740000	so it's like a price reduction
5740000	5742000	so that is coming out as well
5742000	5744000	that's basically the game and DLC
5744000	5746000	they're releasing over here too
5746000	5748000	that whole thing is out in Japan as well
5748000	5750000	and then of course FIFA 18 will be a big release
5750000	5752000	and that is out on the PlayStation 4 this week
5752000	5754000	let's take a trip over to the UK
5754000	5756000	Loki
5756000	5758000	Alright, so we have Evalkyrie Warzone
5758000	5760000	on PC and PlayStation 4
5760000	5762000	Lightfield on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One

5770000	5772000	on PC called
5772000	5774000	Twickles
5774000	5776000	I guess
5776000	5778000	Picross S on the Switch and
5778000	5780000	Blue Reflection on PC
5780000	5782000	Alright, let's go to the mailbag

5784000	5786000	sometimes you send us emails

5794000	5796000	by emailing us at participate at

5800000	5802000	but since she's under the weather tonight
5802000	5804000	I will be filling in those duties in her place
5804000	5806000	Let's start with an email from Martin
5806000	5808000	the Belgian who emails us this week
5808000	5810000	Dearest OLR, congratulations
5810000	5812000	on reaching 700 episodes
5812000	5814000	It is an epic milestone and not
5814000	5816000	many podcasts will ever reach that many episodes
5816000	5818000	It is a testament to how committed
5818000	5820000	you guys are and it is great to see
5820000	5822000	you have built a real sense of community
5822000	5824000	for so many listeners every Sunday night
5824000	5826000	Like gathering with a group of friends
5826000	5828000	around a campfire and sharing stories
5828000	5830000	Perfect. I have been listening to
5830000	5832000	this show for probably close to 10 years
5832000	5834000	at this point and it has definitely become a part
5834000	5836000	of my Monday mornings as I wake up at work
5836000	5838000	and listen to the podcast. Thank you for always
5838000	5840000	being there to provide some Monday morning
5840000	5842000	entertainment. Rob, it was great meeting you
5842000	5844000	in person at DragonCon. Having listened
5844000	5846000	to you guys for so long I was definitely a little
5846000	5848000	nervous and starstruck
5848000	5850000	meeting you and Bobby in person
5850000	5852000	Sorry if I was a bit awkward. Next year we
5852000	5854000	should go and have some shots of Stroopwafel
5854000	5856000	together. Keep up the great show
5856000	5858000	as always. Hugs, Martin the Belgian
5858000	5860000	You didn't strike me as nervous or
5860000	5862000	awkward at all. So
5862000	5864000	I'm actually only regretful
5864000	5866000	I didn't get to spend more time
5866000	5868000	with people but they were kind of
5868000	5870000	for logistical reasons I don't fault
5870000	5872000	them for it at all. They kind of had to shoo us off the stage
5872000	5874000	to prep the next panel
5874000	5876000	Right? So
5876000	5878000	What we really need to do I think one of the best things
5878000	5880000	we ever did was remember the year
5880000	5882000	we went to PAX in Seattle
5882000	5884000	That was 2008. That was the year I was really sick
5884000	5886000	So we went to PAX in Seattle and we were with
5886000	5888000	All Games then
5888000	5890000	Wasn't the All Games broadcast
5890000	5892000	going the whole time? I think
5892000	5894000	Bobby was doing them. Yeah they had this whole
5894000	5896000	side table thing that was in the hallway
5896000	5898000	And other shows that were on the network at the time
5898000	5900000	were coming and going. So that was the whole thing we were doing that year
5900000	5902000	And the reason why I bring it up is that
5902000	5904000	one thing I remember we did is we did like a dinner
5904000	5906000	Somewhere one night where we actually
5906000	5908000	Yeah I remember that. Yeah it sounded like
5908000	5910000	an Asian restaurant. Yeah and we got
5910000	5912000	to meet a bunch of listeners and it was like
5912000	5914000	hey we're going to go to this dinner place
5914000	5916000	Of course then when the check came out it was a nightmare
5916000	5918000	to split but
5918000	5920000	maybe we could find a counter diner place or something
5920000	5922000	we could find a place to go eat at
5922000	5924000	together and say we're going to have the
5924000	5926000	vog dinner at XYZ time
5926000	5928000	during Dragon Con. I think that would be really cool
5928000	5930000	except for the fact that Dragon Con is so fucking crowded
5930000	5932000	to do something like that you probably
5932000	5934000	have to go like a ways away from
5934000	5936000	the main center venue. But I don't know
5936000	5938000	you know my fifth year at Dragon
5938000	5940000	Con I'm learning more tricks about where
5940000	5942000	to eat and that if you walk a certain
5942000	5944000	direction just like two blocks away
5944000	5946000	you're going to find restaurants with no weight
5946000	5948000	whatsoever because like everybody is
5948000	5950000	in that fucking peach tree center or
5950000	5952000	you know wherever so
5952000	5954000	yeah so anyway I bring that up because
5954000	5956000	I think it would be really cool to maybe do something like that
5956000	5958000	in a future year like
5958000	5960000	next year because we already have
5960000	5962000	vog suite booked for 2018
5962000	5964000	so we're coming back
5964000	5966000	next year and hopefully we'll still get to be a part
5966000	5968000	of the podcast track and that will be
5968000	5970000	awesome and you know I say to
5970000	5972000	people that meet us for the first time like
5972000	5974000	realistically like first
5974000	5976000	off there's no need to be starstruck we're gaming
5976000	5978000	fans just like you guys we just started this show
5978000	5980000	so long ago but I'm very honored that
5980000	5982000	people like get excited you know
5982000	5984000	since I also kind of get it like you've been
5984000	5986000	listening to us but you've never met us for maybe
5986000	5988000	10 years that's a very long time so
5988000	5990000	like I get it but you know trust me
5990000	5992000	we're not we
5992000	5994000	don't pay our bills with anything we
5994000	5996000	make from this show so until we're at that level
5996000	5998000	I don't think we're really that famous so
5998000	6000000	we're probably just as starstruck to meet you
6000000	6002000	as you are to meet us for what it's
6002000	6004000	worth but yeah my coworker the other day I like
6004000	6006000	told him about how we had 700 episodes like
6006000	6008000	so you guys making money off of that I'm like
6008000	6010000	no why not
6010000	6012000	you should other podcasts do look at
6012000	6014000	like Joe Rogan's like
6014000	6016000	yes yeah
6016000	6018000	Joe Rogan
6018000	6020000	I don't think it works like that you can't just like
6020000	6022000	just do that
6022000	6024000	okay I'm just gonna make money now
6024000	6026000	maybe you can but like eh
6026000	6028000	sorry
6028000	6030000	I'm laughing cause in chat act
6030000	6032000	deft in chat says winner winner chicken
6032000	6034000	dinner and that's what we can have at DragonCon
6034000	6036000	I love it
6036000	6038000	only if it can be like southern fried
6038000	6040000	chicken there you go alright
6040000	6042000	moving on one more email this week
6042000	6044000	from Sam it's short and sweet
6044000	6046000	but I'm gonna read this anyway from Sam
6046000	6048000	hello OLR crew show 700
6048000	6050000	was very special just because it was
6050000	6052000	a regular show good call
6052000	6054000	do any of you think well first off thank you for
6054000	6056000	that you know like I
6056000	6058000	I somehow sometimes I think that's the best way
6058000	6060000	to do it to just acknowledge the
6060000	6062000	big event and then do what people
6062000	6064000	show up for every week you know I think if we
6064000	6066000	had spent three hours just talking about ourselves
6066000	6068000	or doing a retrospective
6068000	6070000	or something it just wouldn't that's not the show
6070000	6072000	you guys necessarily signed up to hear
6072000	6074000	um retrospectives are good though
6074000	6076000	don't get me wrong but those can be like
6076000	6078000	specials or something like and sometimes
6078000	6080000	we do those too remember we did that marathon show
6080000	6082000	for nine hours that was pretty great alright anyway
6082000	6084000	um so moving
6084000	6086000	on with Sam's email do any of you
6086000	6088000	think Nintendo should have put the
6088000	6090000	NES and SNES classic systems
6090000	6092000	on the Switch to increase
6092000	6094000	sales thank you Sam
6094000	6096000	uh well Sam I think that's kind of a
6096000	6098000	common complaint here at Orange Lounge Radio
6098000	6100000	uh is kind of one of those
6100000	6102000	what are they doing when we see that the NES
6102000	6104000	and the Super Nintendo games they're on the Wii
6104000	6106000	they're on the Wii U but for whatever reason
6106000	6108000	they're not on the Switch um and
6108000	6110000	I think I've said this before on the show and I'm going to say it
6110000	6112000	again is that don't get your hopes
6112000	6114000	up that those NES and SNES classic games
6114000	6116000	are going to show up on the Switch at least
6116000	6118000	not in the same way um
6118000	6120000	we know that Nintendo is working on
6120000	6122000	something with this whole online system that they're
6122000	6124000	doing that you're going to be able to play games
6124000	6126000	uh it sounds like NES games like
6126000	6128000	Balloon Fight I think is one that they've kind of shown
6128000	6130000	that you'll be able to play it across the internet
6130000	6132000	okay basically and that's going to be the new thing
6132000	6134000	the thing we said virtual consoles should have done like
6134000	6136000	ten years ago they're finally going to be bringing
6136000	6138000	into that but that may not
6138000	6140000	be virtual console
6140000	6142000	I think if Nintendo does
6142000	6144000	virtual console for Switch it's going to
6144000	6146000	be Gabe Cube games
6146000	6148000	maybe Wii games if
6148000	6150000	that you know the HD
6150000	6152000	you know the control system kind of works with
6152000	6154000	Wii if they emulate that alright um
6154000	6156000	you'll have that
6156000	6158000	uh but like GameCube games and like
6158000	6160000	the newer Nintendo games I don't think
6160000	6162000	you're going to have the older stuff that is
6162000	6164000	going to be reserved for the online component
6164000	6166000	um which
6166000	6168000	will because you're going to be paying a monthly
6168000	6170000	fee for that uh it may or may not
6170000	6172000	overlap really with the NES and
6172000	6174000	the SNES classics yeah I think
6174000	6176000	we've been sitting here for a while going it would
6176000	6178000	be great if Nintendo just
6178000	6180000	releases a bundle on the Switch that's
6180000	6182000	all these classic games and I think
6182000	6184000	people would be very happy um
6184000	6186000	but Nintendo is gonna
6186000	6188000	Nintendo and sometimes the things
6188000	6190000	that they do don't always make sense to us
6190000	6192000	well at least from what
6192000	6194000	I've been hearing just following the whole
6194000	6196000	SNES classic thing it does sound like
6196000	6198000	that they are getting a lot more systems
6198000	6200000	per location
6200000	6202000	at least everybody that's been posting
6202000	6204000	online they've said you know my
6204000	6206000	GameStop only got nine NES
6206000	6208000	classic editions they're getting 30 of
6208000	6210000	the SNES so and a lot of
6210000	6212000	the other locations like Walmart and Best Buy
6212000	6214000	are getting you know double digit
6214000	6216000	numbers you know significant double
6216000	6218000	digit numbers so okay
6218000	6220000	hopefully that's a good sign
6220000	6222000	so fingers crossed this may be
6222000	6224000	I'm actually gonna try I'm just gonna
6224000	6226000	for the fuck of it I'm just gonna stop by Walmart
6226000	6228000	on that day
6228000	6230000	just to see if it's there just to see
6230000	6232000	and I'm not getting my hopes up or whatever
6232000	6234000	I'm just gonna see is it is curious
6234000	6236000	here's my question is it limited
6236000	6238000	to the places that Nintendo was saying
6238000	6240000	or like would you be able to find
6240000	6242000	it at more independent stores or maybe
6242000	6244000	even other chains like Fries
6244000	6246000	is one that comes to mind because Fries maybe
6246000	6248000	I always forget that Fries has the
6248000	6250000	same fucking games everybody else does Fries
6250000	6252000	maybe I would think like big box
6252000	6254000	stores are gonna probably have it independent chains
6254000	6256000	are usually third rate
6256000	6258000	when it comes to publishers
6258000	6260000	so they're gonna supply the big box
6260000	6262000	stores first actdeft in chat says
6262000	6264000	you'll probably have better luck at Target and you
6264000	6266000	know what I tend to agree you'll probably have
6266000	6268000	better luck at Target you know what
6268000	6270000	I don't know if the Target app still does it but it
6270000	6272000	used to cause that's how I found a Wii U
6272000	6274000	you could go into the Target app and it'll tell you
6274000	6276000	like it's in stock at this store or it's not
6276000	6278000	I may try that
6278000	6280000	just for fun
6280000	6282000	I'm curious I you know
6282000	6284000	if you're gonna go to Walmart I'm gonna tell you
6284000	6286000	exactly which one to go to I don't mean to get too local
6286000	6288000	but do you know how we joke about the Walmart
6288000	6290000	in the middle of nowhere
6290000	6292000	the one over by Anatolia
6292000	6294000	no it's not over there it's over like you gotta
6294000	6296000	go like um okay so
6296000	6298000	oh yeah yeah
6298000	6300000	you go but you go the other way
6300000	6302000	down and there's a Walmart out there where you're like
6302000	6304000	where's the fucking people out here there's no
6304000	6306000	people try that one
6306000	6308000	cause that would be the one I would try
6308000	6310000	that's a little out of my way but
6310000	6312000	yeah I just figured I'd try the one by my house
6312000	6314000	since it's right by my house
6314000	6316000	ooh SSU100Matt with a good point
6316000	6318000	in chat saying doesn't help that this Friday is
6318000	6320000	Yom Kippur oh I didn't
6320000	6322000	realize that but that's right
6322000	6324000	some people are gonna be doing
6325000	6327000	things related to that and they can't necessarily
6327000	6329000	just go out shopping so hmm interesting
6329000	6331000	alright
6331000	6333000	anyway oh YYR points out though it's Friday
6333000	6335000	night into Saturday so I guess maybe
6335000	6337000	you could go out in the morning but you're not gonna
6337000	6339000	be able to maybe hunt all day long so
6339000	6341000	alright anyhow that was it for emails
6341000	6343000	tonight thank you guys for the emails
6343000	6345000	send us more for next week participate
6345000	6347000	at Orangeloungeradio.com
6347000	6349000	if you wanna participate with Mailbag next week
6349000	6351000	we do have some more news for you guys before we get
6351000	6353000	to the Skype line at Orangeloungeradio
6354000	6356000	let's get to Loki with the next story
6356000	6358000	so as we were talking about the whole steam review changes
6358000	6360000	and stuff and how people are review bombing stuff
6360000	6362000	one of the games that came out of course was NBA 2K18
6362000	6364000	there was a huge backlash after
6364000	6366000	their whole virtual currency
6366000	6368000	this is literally what they call it because they
6368000	6370000	couldn't think of anything creative to call it
6370000	6372000	was kind of fuck
6372000	6374000	fake money didn't fly
6374000	6376000	it was kind of fucking up everything because
6376000	6378000	one of the big gripes with this they've been doing
6378000	6380000	virtual currency since 2K13 but one of the big
6380000	6382000	gripes is that the
6382000	6384000	virtual currency this time around they're really
6384000	6386000	whoring that shit so like
6386000	6388000	it would take several games
6388000	6390000	of actually planning to earn that virtual currency
6390000	6392000	to actually level up and that's only if you
6392000	6394000	like got the best stats in the game
6394000	6396000	whereas it could take several
6396000	6398000	hours of grinding
6398000	6400000	on top of that the stuff that you get
6400000	6402000	and unlock the different customizables
6402000	6404000	they're
6404000	6406000	not transferable between
6406000	6408000	your characters and like the haircuts in the game
6408000	6410000	instead of actually unlocking the haircut
6410000	6412000	they'll toggle it on and off and stuff
6412000	6414000	they're going the whole Destiny 2 route
6414000	6416000	and they are
6416000	6418000	consumables so you get your haircut
6418000	6420000	which originally was costing
6420000	6422000	you know I think
6422000	6424000	it was like 500 VC or something
6424000	6426000	like that so it was one game
6426000	6428000	but now they've dropped the price
6428000	6430000	of the actual haircuts down to
6430000	6432000	100 VC
6432000	6434000	oh haircut I'm sorry it was 1500
6434000	6436000	originally so they would give you like
6436000	6438000	I think five or six thousand to begin with
6438000	6440000	and then now they're
6440000	6442000	kind of dropping the prices of all that
6442000	6444000	because people aren't too happy with it
6444000	6446000	and they're looking to see about maybe changing
6446000	6448000	some of the other balancing it still sucks
6448000	6450000	so that they're doing this and don't support it
6450000	6452000	well I guess at least the company's
6452000	6454000	kind of listening to the feedback for better
6454000	6456000	a little bit but like I mean they've been doing it this long
6456000	6458000	they just have to find the right balance
6458000	6460000	between fucking over their
6460000	6462000	consumers and them noticing
6462000	6464000	alright
6464000	6466000	well moving on this week a lot of people's
6466000	6468000	childhoods
6468000	6470000	got a harsh taste of
6470000	6472000	reality this week and I'm sure you all
6472000	6474000	know
6476000	6478000	it's a little quiet and coming through but
6478000	6480000	the Toys R Us song
6480000	6482000	I don't want to grow up I'm a Toys R Us kid
6482000	6484000	well you're going to have to grow up and face the facts
6484000	6486000	that sometimes when you don't pay your bills you go bankrupt
6486000	6488000	so that
6488000	6490000	is what's happening with Toys R Us and it's unfortunate
6490000	6492000	because you know
6492000	6494000	I think a lot of us have fond memories
6494000	6496000	of going to Toys R Us
6496000	6498000	and pulling the tag for a game
6498000	6500000	do you know did I tell you when
6500000	6502000	Shane and I went to Chico because he was
6502000	6504000	hunting for Power Rangers when we drove up to Chico
6504000	6506000	which is like a good 90 minutes two hours away from here
6506000	6508000	we drove up there on a search for some
6508000	6510000	damn Power Rangers toys
6510000	6512000	but we freaked out when we went to the gaming section
6512000	6514000	because we were like oh my god they still have tags
6514000	6516000	here that you pulled to take up to the front
6516000	6518000	what the fuck this is a time capsule
6518000	6520000	there weren't a whole lot of department
6520000	6522000	stores like it wasn't like this
6522000	6524000	this is before like the whole Walmart
6524000	6526000	and Target thing I mean Toys R Us
6526000	6528000	was like the fucking
6528000	6530000	big ass toy store
6530000	6532000	it was a fucking event to go
6532000	6534000	to see Toys R Us
6534000	6536000	now to be clear they just filed for
6536000	6538000	bankruptcy so they're not and Bobby's
6538000	6540000	kind of yelling at us in chat
6540000	6542000	they're not closing all their stores or anything like that
6542000	6544000	not yet anyway but
6544000	6546000	this isn't necessarily a very good sign
6546000	6548000	that they have filed for bankruptcy
6548000	6550000	however what does this
6550000	6552000	have to do with gaming well some of you get your games there
6552000	6554000	but some people were wondering
6554000	6556000	with some of the news about how suppliers
6556000	6558000	were not even letting Toys R Us
6558000	6560000	buy from them unless Toys R Us
6560000	6562000	basically paid cash up front
6562000	6564000	some people were wondering is Toys R
6564000	6566000	Us still going to get the Super Nintendo Mini
6566000	6568000	and the answer is yes
6568000	6570000	there will be a limited supply
6570000	6572000	of the console remember Toys R Us
6572000	6574000	didn't do preorders so there will be a limited
6574000	6576000	supply of the console but Super Nintendo
6576000	6578000	Minis may still be available to purchase
6578000	6580000	excuse me will still be available to purchase
6580000	6582000	if your store got enough
6582000	6584000	from launch day which is September
6584000	6586000	29th
6586000	6588000	stores will open at normal time and have
6588000	6590000	limited inventory of the console
6590000	6592000	so we encourage customers to get in line before
6592000	6594000	doors open on Friday morning for the chance
6594000	6596000	to scoop up this hot item
6596000	6598000	so maybe the one takeaway with this is that
6598000	6600000	some people were maybe thinking
6600000	6602000	Toys R Us was going to be their best bet
6602000	6604000	because they didn't take preorders
6604000	6606000	but it sounds like Toys R Us may just
6606000	6608000	not have a very healthy stock
6608000	6610000	of these so you may be risking it
6610000	6612000	going to Toys R Us so you are going to
6612000	6614000	my honest advice to you is like
6614000	6616000	try to split up and
6616000	6618000	hit like if you are in a household that's
6618000	6620000	more than one person and one is going to
6620000	6622000	be enough for you because most of these places are probably going to limit
6622000	6624000	one per customer but if one is going to be enough for
6624000	6626000	your household you go one store
6626000	6628000	have your partner go to another
6628000	6630000	store you know have
6630000	6632000	a friend that doesn't really
6632000	6634000	care but will help you out go to a third
6634000	6636000	store spread out divide and conquer
6636000	6638000	that might be the best way to do it
6638000	6640000	alright
6640000	6642000	rama in chat over at live.voggenetwork.com
6642000	6644000	points out this isn't the first time Toys R
6644000	6646000	Us has filed for bankruptcy well Toys
6646000	6648000	R Us isn't quite the event that it
6648000	6650000	used to be right it's not
6650000	6652000	do your kids get excited about Toys R Us trips?
6652000	6654000	They like going there every now and then although
6654000	6656000	the one time that
6656000	6658000	we can go to the bookstore
6658000	6660000	or we can go to Toys R Us which one are you going to want to
6660000	6662000	oh I get a bookstore why because we want to
6662000	6664000	play at the train table there like if there's
6664000	6666000	a train table over at
6666000	6668000	which I don't understand either because they have
6668000	6670000	a fucking train table
6670000	6672000	in our house Loki most parents
6672000	6674000	would be thrilled that their kids want to go read books
6674000	6676000	fuck no I want to look at goddamn
6676000	6678000	Legos and there's more Legos
6678000	6680000	there oh this isn't about
6680000	6682000	them it's about you no it's about my crack addict
6682000	6684000	okay
6684000	6686000	it's not about the kids it's about me
6686000	6688000	needing to sniff the crack okay
6688000	6690000	tell
6690000	6692000	tell them you know what tell them
6692000	6694000	next time they want to go to Barnes and Noble to play
6694000	6696000	with the train set just tell them Barnes and Noble
6696000	6698000	threw it in the trash
6698000	6700000	see what happens
6700000	6702000	no they
6702000	6704000	play at the train table and stuff and I occasionally
6704000	6706000	look at the Legos and I
6706000	6708000	balk at how everything is so expensive but I want
6708000	6710000	it and that's usually
6710000	6712000	alright moving on
6712000	6714000	Loki how about some more gaming news
6714000	6716000	alright so Minecraft is
6716000	6718000	still continuing on their Better Together
6718000	6720000	updates so now it's available now
6720000	6722000	on most of the Legacy devices
6722000	6724000	so right now
6724000	6726000	that update of course the one that
6726000	6728000	allows you to play across multiple
6728000	6730000	devices different platforms
6730000	6732000	they have that drop now on
6732000	6734000	Xbox One, Windows 10, Mobile
6734000	6736000	VR and the Switch version
6736000	6738000	will be coming soon
6738000	6740000	but that's pretty exciting I still have yet to go
6740000	6742000	back in there and actually try it on Windows 10
6742000	6744000	version I'm curious to see how that
6744000	6746000	is
6746000	6748000	yeah I mean
6748000	6750000	great news if everybody wants to play
6750000	6752000	together I think that we have to do that
6752000	6754000	in the realms area so I'm
6754000	6756000	sorry it also offers the ability
6756000	6758000	to share invites invite links
6758000	6760000	to the realms which is basically their
6760000	6762000	version of like servers
6762000	6764000	which I still think that costs
6764000	6766000	money each month but it's kind of interesting
6766000	6768000	it'd be interesting to go back to that
6768000	6770000	I remember when we ran a server if it wasn't such a
6770000	6772000	pain in the ass I'd still do it
6772000	6774000	it was just you know even it wasn't that
6774000	6776000	expensive it was like $5 a month but
6776000	6778000	it was just kind of a pain
6778000	6780000	in the ass to do updates especially when you have mods
6780000	6782000	in doing updates it's just a pain in the
6782000	6784000	ass to do that but maybe vanilla
6784000	6786000	we could do vanilla I don't know
6786000	6788000	yeah the VOG Minecraft server was
6788000	6790000	a fun thing for a little while
6790000	6792000	but I would maybe be more willing to do
6792000	6794000	this because in this way a lot
6794000	6796000	more people I would think maybe hopefully be able to
6796000	6798000	play because it's on console and you can just go
6798000	6800000	check it out there
6800000	6802000	I bet that would be awesome
6802000	6804000	also some awesome news from Nintendo
6804000	6806000	catching up with the digital age
6806000	6808000	this is great there is now a
6808000	6810000	new app authenticator for Nintendo
6810000	6812000	so you can actually get two factor
6812000	6814000	authentication on your Nintendo account
6814000	6816000	which you know in this day and age
6816000	6818000	when we have stolen passwords left
6818000	6820000	and right from break-ins and what have you
6820000	6822000	I shit you not this week I had
6822000	6824000	text messages while I was sleeping
6824000	6826000	on Wednesday or Thursday night
6826000	6828000	my Blizzard account got
6828000	6830000	like 5 text messages
6830000	6832000	your Blizzard authenticator code is
6832000	6834000	in this code they came in
6834000	6836000	somebody was fucking trying to get into my Blizzard
6836000	6838000	account and I guess had somehow
6838000	6840000	figured out my password which isn't this
6840000	6842000	interesting I use a unique password
6842000	6844000	for Blizzard that I don't use anywhere else
6844000	6846000	so not only
6846000	6848000	do I use a unique password I don't use anywhere
6848000	6850000	else but I also have two factor authentication
6850000	6852000	on and somehow somebody got the Blizzard password
6852000	6854000	I'd really like to know how that happened because
6854000	6856000	I don't have to log into
6856000	6858000	Blizzard anything anywhere like ever
6858000	6860000	so it's very strange
6860000	6862000	to me that that happened
6862000	6864000	but anyway for whatever reason I got a bunch
6864000	6866000	of Blizzard so I went in and changed my password
6866000	6868000	but thankfully two factor authentication
6868000	6870000	saved somebody going in there
6870000	6872000	and you know probably trying to get into my WOW
6872000	6874000	account although joke's on them I cancelled that a while
6874000	6876000	ago so anyway
6876000	6878000	maybe you don't want somebody getting
6878000	6880000	into your Nintendo account and you know
6880000	6882000	buying stuff that they turn around and sell
6882000	6884000	like what was the big thing on Xbox
6884000	6886000	it's the fake money shit
6886000	6888000	like NBA 2K18
6888000	6890000	stuff that's the stuff they get in there
6890000	6892000	and they buy a bunch of it and sell it so anyway
6892000	6894000	good news Nintendo's
6894000	6896000	catching up to this maybe because of
6896000	6898000	NBA 2K18 who knows but
6898000	6900000	yeah I would definitely recommend
6900000	6902000	you enable the two factor authentication I think
6902000	6904000	that'd be a great idea to enable it you
6904000	6906000	go to Nintendo's login web
6906000	6908000	portal over at accounts.nintendo.com
6908000	6910000	slash login and then you're gonna
6910000	6912000	check out the sign in and security section
6912000	6914000	you have to verify your email
6914000	6916000	address and then you can enable the two factor
6916000	6918000	authentication every
6918000	6920000	new login from your Nintendo account requires
6920000	6922000	authorization from you besides
6922000	6924000	just the login and password via
6924000	6926000	an app or a code
6926000	6928000	texted to you which is kind of the modern way
6928000	6930000	of how most of these things work so
6930000	6932000	good job Nintendo getting on that TFA
6932000	6934000	before you start charging people
6934000	6936000	for online good job
6936000	6938000	just a couple more stories for you
6938000	6940000	guys and then it'll be Skype line time
6940000	6942000	but first Loki alright and then
6942000	6944000	this is a shock to no one
6944000	6946000	but hey remember that Mario
6946000	6948000	Super Mario 64 online
6948000	6950000	game yeah there was no
6950000	6952000	way that wasn't gonna get a copyright
6952000	6954000	strike and of course that's what happened
6954000	6956000	they've been copyright striking
6956000	6958000	the crap out of any videos that were posted
6958000	6960000	on there on
6960000	6962000	YouTube at least with it and
6962000	6964000	of course you know apparently
6964000	6966000	the developer of the
6966000	6968000	online game has been
6968000	6970000	you know basically stating that
6970000	6972000	it's gonna take a break from it for a little bit
6972000	6974000	until after Super Mario
6974000	6976000	Odyssey comes out and they're gonna
6976000	6978000	hopefully release some updates
6978000	6980000	after that but
6980000	6982000	yep I'm not surprised
6982000	6984000	that this happened I mean
6984000	6986000	why not
6986000	6988000	makes sense yeah I don't think a lot
6988000	6990000	of us are very surprised at this at all
6990000	6992000	but it's just the videos so far they've been taken down
6992000	6994000	I don't think they've actually tried to
6994000	6996000	ah the Patreon's gone too I'm pretty sure
6996000	6998000	well
6998000	7000000	no cause they're I don't
7000000	7002000	know if the Patreon's gone yet but
7002000	7004000	I think it was I think that was the big problem
7004000	7006000	see here this is the guy making money off it
7006000	7008000	oh yes okay so they did
7008000	7010000	a strike against the Patreon thing
7010000	7012000	and the YouTube videos were down he hasn't
7012000	7014000	received the cease and desist yet
7014000	7016000	but it may come to that if he
7016000	7018000	doesn't stop updating it but
7018000	7020000	it's out there now so there's it's too late
7020000	7022000	honestly the Patreon was
7022000	7024000	the real problem here I think Nintendo kinda would've
7024000	7026000	done this eventually anyway especially with all the blog
7026000	7028000	coverage it was getting but the Patreon
7028000	7030000	like made it happen faster because
7030000	7032000	the fact that the guy was getting money off of it
7032000	7034000	I mean no matter what
7034000	7036000	you wanna say the reality is
7036000	7038000	Nintendo was gonna say he's making money
7038000	7040000	off of our character and that's a no
7040000	7042000	no you know there's
7042000	7044000	yeah there's only so many ways you can
7044000	7046000	spin that I mean I thought the mod was
7046000	7048000	great and I wish he could work on the mod
7048000	7050000	but he's gonna have to find other ways to get
7050000	7052000	compensation from people
7052000	7054000	Nintendo can you please carry forward with this idea
7054000	7056000	right that would be awesome
7056000	7058000	to see like old games with like a twist
7058000	7060000	like this I know I kinda love it
7060000	7062000	well like even like they went back
7062000	7064000	and they redid Excitebike not that long
7064000	7066000	ago where it's like online now
7066000	7068000	you know it's just a little shitty thing but it was
7068000	7070000	cool for a week
7070000	7072000	you know so I think it would be neat to
7072000	7074000	go back to Mario 64 and add some of this stuff
7074000	7076000	into it so
7076000	7078000	or maybe these games just need to find new
7078000	7080000	collaborations such as they did
7080000	7082000	in our last story tonight with
7082000	7084000	Sonic Forces
7084000	7086000	that's right at an announcement at Tokyo Game Show
7086000	7088000	2017 there is going to be an official collaboration
7088000	7090000	between Sonic Forces and
7090000	7092000	Hooters
7092000	7094000	that's right but this is Hooters in Japan
7094000	7096000	I didn't even know Hooters was in Japan
7096000	7098000	is Hooters in Japan a class year joint or is it
7098000	7100000	what's the difference
7100000	7102000	I've never been to Hooters in Japan
7102000	7104000	maybe the menu items
7104000	7106000	I don't know hopefully their food doesn't suck
7106000	7108000	has anyone in chat ever been to Hooters
7108000	7110000	I feel like the okay so here's the thing
7110000	7112000	we didn't have Hooters in California for the
7112000	7114000	longest time right
7114000	7116000	it was like a thing where it was like oh we've heard of this but that's like
7116000	7118000	I think they've closed down all the Hooters over here
7118000	7120000	the only one that I know of that's still running is
7120000	7122000	the one in Rancho is still open no it's not
7122000	7124000	it's not yeah it's closed oh shit
7124000	7126000	maybe they are all closed
7126000	7128000	it's infidel yeah it's gone
7128000	7130000	oh shit no that was still open not that long
7130000	7132000	ago oh maybe they are all gone
7132000	7134000	I don't know but anyway well I guess they're gone
7134000	7136000	well here's the thing like you know when they first
7136000	7138000	finally came to California after all this time it was like
7138000	7140000	oh let's go to Hooters and then I think everybody
7140000	7142000	realized oh wow their food sucks
7142000	7144000	the food sucks
7144000	7146000	and you know I was always
7146000	7148000	you know obviously I've made no secret
7148000	7150000	that I'm gay on this show so you know
7150000	7152000	the ladies at Hooters don't really do it for me
7152000	7154000	but I always thought they were really nice and friendly
7154000	7156000	they were very friendly it was a little
7156000	7158000	weird I mean it was just kind of like
7158000	7160000	hey why are you sitting down at my table to take my order
7160000	7162000	that's a little weird
7162000	7164000	I always thought it was
7164000	7166000	I get it that you're trying to be friendly and busty but you know
7166000	7168000	it's just it's weird
7168000	7170000	and it wasn't that we I remember we went to
7170000	7172000	the one that was
7172000	7174000	with Annie and Jim actually
7174000	7176000	we hadn't gone and we went there
7176000	7178000	Flaco Jones and wife yes
7178000	7180000	Flaco Jones and wife so we went there and
7180000	7182000	I remember I
7182000	7184000	got a hamburger and the hamburger was kind of
7184000	7186000	crap and then I was like okay well
7186000	7188000	everybody says the wings are good so
7188000	7190000	I'm gonna try the wings it took an hour to get
7190000	7192000	wings and
7192000	7194000	they were not good I did not
7194000	7196000	like them but then again to be fair I don't like
7196000	7198000	buffalo wings but
7198000	7200000	they I've tried
7200000	7202000	their wings in different sauces
7202000	7204000	other hooter locations
7204000	7206000	and I've been the three or four different
7206000	7208000	ones not liking any of them
7208000	7210000	their food was just no thanks
7210000	7212000	wow sure enough
7212000	7214000	so I'm looking I'm looking at the news from the SACB
7214000	7216000	on June 9th the Hooters and Rancho Cordova
7216000	7218000	closed uh the second
7218000	7220000	Hooters closing in a year because the one over by
7220000	7222000	Arden Mall closed I'm sorry I know this is a worldwide
7222000	7224000	podcast which you didn't have to this involves
7224000	7226000	our hooters local news okay but
7226000	7228000	it involves our hooters and so this is important
7228000	7230000	um so anyway
7230000	7232000	uh this was a decision made by the landlord
7232000	7234000	as they exercised the right to terminate
7234000	7236000	the lease pursuing a different direction
7236000	7238000	with the property so they
7238000	7240000	didn't want to hooters there anymore that's dumb
7240000	7242000	it was kind of dumb I thought
7242000	7244000	it was just because that's what happened to Ferrell's
7244000	7246000	you know that turned into Old Spaghetti Factory recently
7246000	7248000	cause that place Ferrell's was
7248000	7250000	always fucking hopping we don't like ice
7250000	7252000	cream fuck you guys
7252000	7254000	it's just this kind of clientele
7254000	7256000	is not good for us
7256000	7258000	oh my we want hooters there
7258000	7260000	uh the one in
7260000	7262000	Arden did you know what it's getting turned
7262000	7264000	into I had no idea the one in Arden
7264000	7266000	a sizzler
7266000	7268000	hahaha
7268000	7270000	that's funny
7270000	7272000	yeah in April it was announced that the site
7272000	7274000	would become a sizzler
7274000	7276000	hahaha
7276000	7278000	fuck this hooters nonsense
7278000	7280000	but the SACB does point
7280000	7282000	out there is one remaining
7282000	7284000	hooters and it's the one
7284000	7286000	in Natomas the one by the movies in Natomas
7286000	7288000	how ironic
7288000	7290000	there it is
7290000	7292000	alright now you're all up to speed
7292000	7294000	on the local hooters drama
7294000	7296000	but good old
7296000	7298000	dar to see ya in our chat room found us
7298000	7300000	a hooters of japan menu
7300000	7302000	so they have such things like
7302000	7304000	salads with cob salad
7304000	7306000	shrimp and spinach salad this is all
7306000	7308000	the same shit you can get here right there's nothing really
7308000	7310000	I don't think I see anything that's
7310000	7312000	out of the norm really
7312000	7314000	do they have all these sandwiches and stuff
7314000	7316000	muscle with garlic butter that sounds
7316000	7318000	fancy for seafood so maybe
7318000	7320000	they have a couple extra items but not really
7320000	7322000	so sounds kind of very
7322000	7324000	similar to what we have here anyway where the fuck
7324000	7326000	were we oh yeah Sonic the Hedgehog in
7326000	7328000	hooters hahaha
7328000	7330000	they're going to be doing a collaboration
7330000	7332000	but the collaboration starts
7332000	7334000	in the middle of October and further information
7334000	7336000	is to come they didn't really say what it's
7336000	7338000	going to be and if Amy will
7338000	7340000	be involved but I somehow
7340000	7342000	think not what do you think
7342000	7344000	what do you think the Sonic and hooters collaboration
7344000	7346000	will be I would say tweets
7346000	7348000	from the Sonic the Hedgehog account for sure
7348000	7350000	what
7350000	7352000	well the only thing I can think that has
7352000	7354000	that's in common with hooters
7354000	7356000	and Sonic the Hedgehog is
7356000	7358000	the hooters food
7358000	7360000	makes you gotta go fast
7360000	7362000	so
7362000	7364000	I mean that's kind of a
7364000	7366000	tie in right there
7368000	7370000	other than that
7370000	7372000	I have no idea but you know what
7372000	7374000	good night everybody
7374000	7376000	show's cancelled kids need
7376000	7378000	more kids need to come to hooters
7378000	7380000	I guess because it's awkward
7382000	7384000	it's such a kids restaurant
7384000	7386000	it's all about owls everybody loves owls
7386000	7388000	everybody loves owls Sonic the Hedgehog
7388000	7390000	is not an owl last time I checked
7390000	7392000	oh he's getting another friend
7392000	7394000	hootie the owl

7412000	7414000	us a call let me check in with loki while
7414000	7416000	we wait to see if a call comes in I do have skype
7416000	7418000	running I have to do the whole ipad
7418000	7420000	thing again tonight but I think it should work
7420000	7422000	so anyway meanwhile
7422000	7424000	I'm going to check in with loki and see if there's any last minute stories
7424000	7426000	I didn't really have anything last minute but did you
7426000	7428000	get to catch the new trailer for the new
7428000	7430000	Tomb Raider oh the movie
7430000	7432000	yes I did I did watch it and I totally
7432000	7434000	recognize scenes from the game like the whole thing in the boat that was
7434000	7436000	the beginning of the game yeah it looked kind of cool except for the
7436000	7438000	clicking in the background of the trailer
7438000	7440000	but I know that was for artistic
7440000	7442000	effect was it I don't even
7442000	7444000	really pick that up it's neat
7444000	7446000	I look better
7446000	7448000	better than some of the other Tomb Raider movies
7448000	7450000	yeah yeah so yeah no I would go
7450000	7452000	see it I mean I never seem to get to go to
7452000	7454000	movies anymore but I would go see it for sure
7454000	7456000	so anyway we do have a call coming
7456000	7458000	in so I'm going to try to pick this up here and
7458000	7460000	connect on our skype line and we will get
7460000	7462000	to the telephones
7462000	7464000	uh hello you're on orange lounge radio who's this
7464000	7466000	uh this is
7466000	7468000	yyr hey yyr how you doing
7468000	7470000	I'm doing okay I guess the
7470000	7472000	ipad is working yes the ipad is
7472000	7474000	where it's a little slower to connect which I don't like
7474000	7476000	but it works it gets the job done
7476000	7478000	ipad therefore I am
7478000	7480000	uh well
7480000	7482000	uh actually the main reason why I'm calling
7482000	7484000	is because I wanted to
7484000	7486000	answer your inquiry from last week
7486000	7488000	which you may or may not actually remember
7488000	7490000	um I guess
7490000	7492000	I can see the expression on your face
7492000	7494000	means I should probably remind you
7494000	7496000	shit I forgot I forgot that we have a
7496000	7498000	camera now because of this ipad alright
7498000	7500000	now you
7500000	7502000	you have nothing to be ashamed of it's a fine
7502000	7504000	looking face so um
7504000	7506000	anyway
7506000	7508000	um yes it was
7508000	7510000	was mentioning that
7510000	7512000	you know I came to this realization about
7512000	7514000	the shift keys on a typical
7514000	7516000	keyboard not being the same size
7516000	7518000	yes because I was working on the
7518000	7520000	interface for super multitasking
7520000	7522000	and you were wondering why does
7522000	7524000	that matter what does this have to do
7524000	7526000	with the interface so
7526000	7528000	so yeah uh as you
7528000	7530000	may recall super multitasking is a
7530000	7532000	game which has you playing
7532000	7534000	multiple games at the same time
7534000	7536000	in various areas of the screen
7536000	7538000	and now there's nothing I
7538000	7540000	can do to make this easier but what I
7540000	7542000	did want to do is give the player
7542000	7544000	uh as many tools
7544000	7546000	as possible to
7546000	7548000	make playing it
7548000	7550000	at least as
7550000	7552000	frustration free as possible so that
7552000	7554000	they can focus on actually trying to
7554000	7556000	multitask so and one
7556000	7558000	way I do that is by
7558000	7560000	in each area of the screen where a game can
7560000	7562000	appear I label what controls
7562000	7564000	are used in that area
7564000	7566000	for example in that left side
7566000	7568000	slot where you can use the left
7568000	7570000	stick or the d-pad I have
7570000	7572000	visual representation of both
7572000	7574000	the left stick and the d-pad
7574000	7576000	you know so just in case you know
7576000	7578000	oh uh there's a game over there what
7578000	7580000	do I play it with again oh yeah
7580000	7582000	so now here's the thing
7582000	7584000	this is the first version of this game that allows
7584000	7586000	you to use the keyboard as
7586000	7588000	well as a controller
7588000	7590000	but not just that I don't
7590000	7592000	just set up a configuration
7592000	7594000	and force you to use it you can
7594000	7596000	define any key configuration
7596000	7598000	you want
7598000	7600000	good man because accessibility
7600000	7602000	very important but I still
7602000	7604000	wanted to visually represent
7604000	7606000	the keys that you have selected
7606000	7608000	no matter what keys they
7608000	7610000	were so I wanted to
7610000	7612000	visually represent all of the different keys
7612000	7614000	in the background and
7614000	7616000	since some keys are wider than others
7616000	7618000	if you want to do that properly
7618000	7620000	well let's just say I measured
7620000	7622000	all of the key widths on
7622000	7624000	a couple of different keyboards
7624000	7626000	and uh yeah
7626000	7628000	so
7628000	7630000	what did you think of the realization
7630000	7632000	that some shift keys are
7632000	7634000	larger but some are not
7634000	7636000	I think it's
7636000	7638000	kind of like a metaphor
7638000	7640000	for life really
7640000	7642000	mostly about penis sizes
7642000	7644000	uh yeah I think
7644000	7646000	you're just going to have to do your best with
7646000	7648000	that representation YYR and
7648000	7650000	it is what it is in that regard and if somebody
7650000	7652000	really sends you an email that says you
7652000	7654000	did not accurately represent the shift key
7654000	7656000	on my keyboard then just take that email
7656000	7658000	and throw it away
7658000	7660000	I'll just say I did the best I could
7660000	7662000	I mean I hope that
7662000	7664000	there are a few people that are like
7664000	7666000	wow that is some crazy attention to
7666000	7668000	detail there so
7668000	7670000	we know we need to all review bomb
7670000	7672000	multitasking by saying the
7672000	7674000	shift key no it's a positive
7674000	7676000	it's going to be an uplifting review bomb to say
7676000	7678000	the shift key was appropriately
7678000	7680000	represented
7680000	7682000	well I just believe in equal
7682000	7684000	representation for all my keys
7684000	7686000	good good for you you're a good man
7686000	7688000	YYR any hints
7688000	7690000	on when we might be playing
7690000	7692000	multitasking for ourselves?
7692000	7694000	I am feverishly trying to complete
7694000	7696000	all of the various and sundry
7696000	7698000	things on my list some of which
7698000	7700000	weren't there a day ago but I just
7700000	7702000	keep finding things that I meant to do
7702000	7704000	anyway but never actually
7704000	7706000	wrote down so I
7706000	7708000	originally had said fall
7708000	7710000	I think fall officially ended three
7710000	7712000	two days ago something like
7712000	7714000	fall just started two days ago
7714000	7716000	oh no
7716000	7718000	I meant oh summer oh you're right
7718000	7720000	yeah summer I had said summer
7720000	7722000	so fall just started and I missed
7722000	7724000	I missed summer so I'm
7724000	7726000	now saying fall and I hope
7726000	7728000	I will be able to complete it and release it
7728000	7730000	during the fall so otherwise
7730000	7732000	it will be my own fall that's alright
7732000	7734000	fingers and toes crossed for you that you can
7734000	7736000	do it it's you know what you're not the first
7736000	7738000	developer to ever have to delay a release date
7738000	7740000	so at least you can you know feel that
7740000	7742000	and you know insert
7742000	7744000	something about a bad game is bad forever
7744000	7746000	blah blah blah perfect you
7746000	7748000	know what what if you guys what if you'd
7748000	7750000	release the game and the shift the shift
7750000	7752000	key was not right
7752000	7754000	shift gate
7754000	7756000	shift
7756000	7758000	gate
7758000	7760000	and with that we're going to end this

7832000	7834000	before that last call dungeon
7834000	7836000	buster says the tomb raider trailer was
7836000	7838000	neat the poster was meh
7838000	7840000	there you go
7840000	7842000	let's see mxc in chat
7842000	7844000	says I have so many xbox live indie
7844000	7846000	game titles yeah I had
7846000	7848000	quite a few too but I haven't
7848000	7850000	plugged in my xbox 360 in the longest
7850000	7852000	time it's sad but there's just
7852000	7854000	not a lot I mean with the backwards compatibility now
7854000	7856000	on xbox one there's very little that
7856000	7858000	I would need the 360 to play and it's
7858000	7860000	like I've got enough between
7860000	7862000	xbox or
7862000	7864000	between the playstation 4 the switch
7864000	7866000	xbox one I've got enough so that I'm not
7866000	7868000	on 360 so
7868000	7870000	they have a game that just hit early access
7870000	7872000	ballistic ng
7872000	7874000	which you may not recognize that but it is
7874000	7876000	a wipe out
7876000	7878000	type clone that's on
7878000	7880000	steam like the racing game yeah and it has
7880000	7882000	I think I want to say
7882000	7884000	market or the steam
7884000	7886000	I think you can do customized
7886000	7888000	stuff in there maybe not I don't know
7888000	7890000	they have a modding api so that's kind of cool
7890000	7892000	but you can check it out it's five
7892000	7894000	dollars oh that's not bad
7894000	7896000	yeah that's a good price all right
7896000	7898000	one last call for calls is your last chance
7898000	7900000	orange lounge radio all one word on skype if you
7900000	7902000	want to give us a call and actually you know

7908000	7910000	late uh yyr suggests if you want
7910000	7912000	to read up on xbox live indie games super
7912000	7914000	quickly try the
7914000	7916000	xb lig
7916000	7918000	xbox live indie games xb lig the
7918000	7920000	xb lig.com or indie
7920000	7922000	gamer chick.com both sites have
7922000	7924000	a ton of reviews
7924000	7926000	yes they do all right
7926000	7928000	well I am not hearing our skype line light up
7928000	7930000	so I think that is going to do it for the skype line tonight
7930000	7932000	um sorry if you were trying
7932000	7934000	and you couldn't get through for whatever reason but you can
7934000	7936000	always um you know you can always uh
7936000	7938000	send us an email at participate at orange
7938000	7940000	lounge radio dot com or uh you can
7940000	7942000	always send us a tweet twitter dot com
7942000	7944000	slash o l r but I guess for tonight
7944000	7946000	we are going to wrap up I know it was a little bit of a shorter
7946000	7948000	show tonight but we didn't have dark soccer tonight and
7948000	7950000	well you know it's a little just just not as
7950000	7952000	much to say tonight some weeks are just a little slower
7952000	7954000	than others but uh that's all right we'll be
7954000	7956000	back again to do it in seven days uh if you liked
7956000	7958000	what you did hear we did fill a good two hours here
7958000	7960000	at orange lounge radio tonight so if you did like what
7960000	7962000	you heard here at orange lounge radio tell a friend
7962000	7964000	or two about the show help us spread the word
7964000	7966000	because we are the show where every gamer has a voice
7966000	7968000	but um you know if the voices aren't here we can't
7968000	7970000	really hear them so a nice five star review on a site
7970000	7972000	like itunes google play or
7972000	7974000	wherever it is you found this show goes an awful
7974000	7976000	long way um
7976000	7978000	I think uh
7978000	7980000	we should probably wrap it up with some final thoughts
7980000	7982000	loki your final thought tonight
7982000	7984000	uh my final thought is
7984000	7986000	I'm gonna work on more
7986000	7988000	lego stuff this week actually I've been using a lot
7988000	7990000	of the digital designer so it's been fun
7990000	7992000	I've been trying to do a mock of my
7992000	7994000	house but the problem is it's so
7994000	7996000	huge um
7996000	7998000	it's just like it's gonna take up four base plates
7998000	8000000	so that's that's way too big
8000000	8002000	that's gonna take up like a whole table so
8002000	8004000	I need I'm trying to shrink it down
8004000	8006000	but it's hard to shrink down
8006000	8008000	uh floor plan on my house
8008000	8010000	alright and uh my final
